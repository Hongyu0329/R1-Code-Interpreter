    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Tissue Identification:** The image displays a section of the kidney cortex, evidenced by the presence of a glomerulus and surrounding renal tubules. The staining is Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), where nuclei are stained purple-blue and cytoplasm/extracellular matrix is pink.\n    2.  **Glomerular Examination:** The central structure is a glomerulus. The most striking abnormality is within Bowman's space (the space between the glomerular tuft and the outer capsule). This space is filled by a large, crescent-shaped proliferation of cells.\n    3.  **Crescent Characterization:** This proliferation is known as a \"crescent.\" It is composed primarily of cells with prominent nuclei, indicating it is a \"cellular crescent.\" Cellular crescents are formed by the proliferation of parietal epithelial cells of Bowman's capsule, along with an influx of inflammatory cells like macrophages. This is a reaction to severe glomerular injury, which causes breaks in the glomerular basement membrane and leakage of fibrin and inflammatory mediators into Bowman's space.\n    4.  **Glomerular Tuft Examination:** The glomerular tuft itself appears compressed by the crescent. It is also \"hypercellular,\" meaning it contains an abnormally high number of cells. This hypercellularity involves native glomerular cells (endothelial, mesangial) and infiltrating inflammatory cells.\n    5.  **Tubulointerstitial Examination:** The surrounding renal tubules show signs of injury, such as vacuolization of the cytoplasm in the tubule to the right. This is a common secondary finding in severe glomerulonephritis.\n    6.  **Synthesis of Findings:** The combination of glomerular hypercellularity and, most importantly, the formation of a large cellular crescent is the hallmark of Crescentic Glomerulonephritis. Clinically, this pathological finding corresponds to Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN).\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   The diagnosis of \"Crescentic Glomerulonephritis\" is a morphological description based on light microscopy.\n    *   Further sub-classification (e.g., anti-GBM disease, immune complex-mediated, or pauci-immune) would require immunofluorescence and serological testing.\n    *   The presence of a cellular crescent (as opposed to a fibrocellular or fibrous crescent) signifies an acute and aggressive disease process, but also one that may be more responsive to immunosuppressive therapy compared to more chronic, scarred lesions.\n    *   The key feature to identify is the extracapillary proliferation (the crescent) filling Bowman's space.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:** Based on the unmistakable presence of a large cellular crescent occupying Bowman's space and compressing the hypercellular glomerular tuft, the histopathological diagnosis is Crescentic Glomerulonephritis.\n\n<<<Crescentic Glomerulonephritis>>>"
