    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the context and the chemical structures.**\nThe question asks to identify which of the four depicted iridium(III) complexes will have shorter lifetimes when used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). All four complexes share a common core structure: they are cationic iridium(III) complexes of the type [Ir(C^N)₂(N^N)]⁺, where Ir is the central metal, C^N is a cyclometalating ligand (a phenylpyridine derivative), and N^N is a neutral bidentate ligand (4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine). The counterion for all complexes is hexafluorophosphate (PF₆⁻). The key difference between the four complexes lies in the substitution pattern of fluorine (F) atoms on the phenyl rings of the C^N ligands.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the primary factor affecting the lifetime of these emitters.**\nThe operational lifetime of phosphorescent organometallic emitters like these iridium complexes is primarily determined by their chemical stability in the excited state. A major and well-documented degradation pathway for fluorinated phenylpyridine-type ligands involves the C-F bond. Specifically, a fluorine atom located at the position *ortho* to the cyclometalating Ir-C bond is known to significantly decrease the stability of the complex. This C(ortho)-F bond becomes labile in the excited state, leading to bond cleavage and subsequent irreversible degradation of the emitter molecule. Therefore, the presence of an ortho-fluorine substituent is a strong indicator of a shorter operational lifetime.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze each complex for the presence of the destabilizing ortho-fluorine.**\nWe will inspect the C^N ligands of each complex to see if there is a fluorine atom directly adjacent to the carbon atom bonded to the iridium center (excluding the carbon that is part of the bond to the pyridine ring).\n\n*   **Complex 1:** Let's examine both C^N ligands. In each, the iridium is bonded to a carbon on the phenyl ring. The position ortho to this Ir-C bond (and not part of the link to the pyridine) is occupied by a hydrogen atom (i.e., it is unsubstituted). The fluorine atoms are located at the meta and para positions relative to the Ir-C bond. Since there are **no ortho-fluorines**, this complex is expected to be relatively stable and have a longer lifetime.\n\n*   **Complex 2:** This complex is heteroleptic, meaning it has two different C^N ligands.\n    *   The top ligand is a difluorophenylpyridine, identical to the ligands in Complex 1. It has **no ortho-fluorine**.\n    *   The bottom ligand is an unsubstituted phenylpyridine. It has no fluorine atoms at all.\n    *   Since neither of the two C^N ligands possesses an ortho-fluorine, Complex 2 is also expected to be relatively stable and have a longer lifetime.\n\n*   **Complex 3:** This complex is also heteroleptic.\n    *   The top ligand is again the same as in Complex 1, with **no ortho-fluorine**.\n    *   The bottom ligand, however, clearly shows a fluorine atom bonded to the carbon that is ortho to the Ir-C bond. The presence of this **ortho-fluorine** acts as a site for degradation.\n    *   Therefore, Complex 3 is expected to be unstable and exhibit a shorter lifetime.\n\n*   **Complex 4:** This complex has two identical C^N ligands.\n    *   Both the top and bottom ligands have a fluorine atom at the position ortho to the Ir-C bond. In fact, they are trifluorinated, with one of the fluorines being in the critical ortho position.\n    *   Since both ligands contain this destabilizing feature, Complex 4 is expected to be unstable and exhibit a shorter lifetime. It might be even less stable than Complex 3, which has only one such ligand.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude which complexes have shorter lifetimes.**\nBased on the analysis in Step 3, the complexes containing at least one C^N ligand with an ortho-fluorine substituent are [3] and [4]. These complexes are predicted to undergo faster degradation and thus have shorter operational lifetimes compared to complexes [1] and [2], which lack this feature.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe complexes expected to show shorter lifetimes are [3] and [4]. This corresponds to option J.\n\n<<<J>>>"
