**Product A:**
A tricyclic structure containing a fused pyrrolizidine core resulting from a [3+2] cycloaddition followed by rearrangement and acetylation. The structure is methyl (E)-2-(1-acetyl-8a-hydroxy-2,3,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-1H-indolizin-2-yl)acrylate.

**Product B:**
A complex polycyclic bridged lactam, specifically 4-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)-2-oxa-4-azatricyclo[5.2.2.0^1,5]undecane-3,6-dione. It is formed via an intramolecular cascade reaction of the starting material activated by acetic anhydride.

**Product C:**
A tricyclic lactam, 1-acetyl-hexahydro-dipyrrolo[1,2-a:1',2'-d]pyrazin-5(1H)-one, formed from an intramolecular condensation of the starting material, promoted by acetic anhydride.
