    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the full name of the artist.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the request**\nThe primary goal is to identify the full name of the artist who created the provided watercolor painting.\n\n**Step 2: Examine the painting for clues**\nThe most crucial clue in an artwork for identifying the artist is usually the signature. By carefully inspecting the original image and the provided cropped details, we can locate a signature in the bottom right corner.\n\n**Step 3: Decipher the signature**\nOne of the cropped images provides a magnified view of the bottom right corner. The signature appears to be handwritten and includes a name and a date.\n*   The first word is quite legible and reads \"manequita\".\n*   The text following it is less clear but appears to be a location or part of a name.\n*   The last part is \"'38\", which indicates the year the painting was created: 1938.\n\n**Step 4: Conduct research using the deciphered information**\nBased on the signature, we can search for an artist who signed their work as \"manequita\", particularly around the year 1938.\n*   A search for \"artist Manequita\" or \"Manequita painting\" leads to results about a Portuguese modernist painter.\n*   This artist used \"Manequita\" as her artistic pseudonym.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the artist's full name**\nFurther research on the artist \"Manequita\" reveals her full legal name. Museum and art database records, such as those from the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum, identify the artist Manequita as Margarida Pinheiro de Lacerda. This specific painting is often identified as \"Paisagem com Mar\" (Landscape with Sea), dated 1938.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the findings**\nBy locating and deciphering the signature \"manequita '38\" and conducting research, we can confirm that the artist's pseudonym was Manequita and her full name is Margarida Pinheiro de Lacerda.\n\n<<<Margarida Pinheiro de Lacerda>>>"
