    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Artwork's Visual Characteristics**:\n    *   **Medium and Style**: The image displays a bas-relief sculpture set within a circular frame, known as a tondo or roundel. The figures are sculpted with grace and naturalism, and the overall aesthetic is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance. The surface has a smooth, slightly glossy appearance typical of glazed terracotta, a medium famously pioneered and perfected by a specific workshop in Florence.\n    *   **Subject Matter**: The scene depicts a religious sacrament. A priest, standing at an altar, is administering what appears to be Holy Communion (the Eucharist) to a group of kneeling figures, including children and adults. This is a common theme in Christian art.\n    *   **Inscription**: At the bottom of the roundel, on a small scroll or cartouche, there is an inscription. Although slightly obscured, it reads \"SACRAMENTI DE LAVTEL\". This is an archaic or regional spelling of the Italian \"Sacramento dell'Altare,\" which translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar.\" This inscription confirms the subject is the Eucharist.\n\n2.  **Connect Visuals to Art History**:\n    *   The combination of glazed terracotta, a religious tondo format, and a Florentine Renaissance style strongly points to the workshop of the **Della Robbia family**.\n    *   The founder of this workshop, **Luca della Robbia** (c. 1399/1400 â€“ 1482), is renowned for popularizing this technique. His work is known for its clarity, piety, and classical composure, all of which are evident in this relief.\n\n3.  **Identify the Specific Artwork**:\n    *   By searching for \"Della Robbia Sacrament of the Altar\" or \"Luca della Robbia Eucharist,\" we can identify this specific piece.\n    *   This roundel is the central panel of the predella (the base section) of the marble and glazed terracotta **Tabernacle of the Eucharist** (in Italian, *Tabernacolo dell'Eucarestia* or *Ciborio*).\n    *   This masterpiece was commissioned in 1441 for the chapel of San Luca in the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence. The tabernacle is now located in the church of Santa Maria in Peretola, a suburb of Florence.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Author**:\n    *   Art historical consensus and museum records (such as those from the Victoria and Albert Museum, which holds a plaster cast of this panel) definitively attribute the design and execution of this tabernacle, including the predella roundel shown, to **Luca della Robbia**.\n\nTherefore, the author of this detail of the altarpiece is Luca della Robbia.\n\n<<<Luca della Robbia>>>"
