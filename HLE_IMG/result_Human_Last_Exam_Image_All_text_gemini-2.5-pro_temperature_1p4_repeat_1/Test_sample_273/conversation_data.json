    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Chiral Centers**\nFirst, we need to identify the chiral centers in the molecule. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In the given structure, there are three such centers. Let's number them for clarity from left to right as they appear in the drawing.\n\n*   **C-alpha (leftmost):** The carbon atom bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a methyl group (-CH3). It is also bonded to the rest of the carbon chain and an implied hydrogen atom. This is a chiral center.\n*   **C-beta (middle):** The carbon atom bonded to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). It is also bonded to the other two chiral centers and an implied hydrogen atom. This is a chiral center.\n*   **C-gamma (rightmost):** The carbon atom bonded to a methyl group (-CH3) and an aminomethyl group (-CH2NH2). It is also bonded to the central chiral carbon and an implied hydrogen atom. This is a a chiral center.\n\nLet's denote them Cα, Cβ, and Cγ for our analysis.\n```\n             Et\n            /\n      HO-Cα--Cβ--Cγ--CH2NH2\n         |      |\n         Me     Me\n```\n\n**2. Assign Priorities to Substituents for Each Chiral Center**\nWe use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules, which assign priority based on atomic number.\n\n**Analysis of C-beta (the middle chiral center):**\n*   **Groups:**\n    1.  The group containing Cα: -CH(OH)CH3\n    2.  The group containing Cγ: -CH(CH3)CH2NH2\n    3.  The ethyl group: -CH2CH3\n    4.  An implied hydrogen atom: -H\n*   **Priorities:**\n    1.  **-CH(OH)CH3**: The carbon Cα is bonded to (O, C, H). The highest atomic number is O(8).\n    2.  **-CH(CH3)CH2NH2**: The carbon Cγ is bonded to (C, C, H). The next atoms out from one of these carbons include an N atom.\n    3.  **-CH2CH3**: The carbon is bonded to (C, H, H).\n    Comparing the groups, -CH(OH)CH3 is the highest priority because of the oxygen atom. Between the other two carbon groups, we compare what those carbons are attached to. The Cγ group has a path leading to a nitrogen atom, while the ethyl group only has carbons and hydrogens. Therefore, the -CH(CH3)CH2NH2 group is second priority. The ethyl group is third. Hydrogen is last.\n    *   Priority 1: -CH(OH)CH3\n    *   Priority 2: -CH(CH3)CH2NH2\n    *   Priority 3: -CH2CH3\n    *   Priority 4: -H\n*   **Assign Configuration:**\n    *   In the drawing, the Cβ-Cα and Cβ-Cγ bonds are in the plane. The ethyl group (Priority 3) is on a wedge (pointing out). The implied hydrogen (Priority 4) is on a dash (pointing back).\n    *   With the lowest priority group (-H) in the back, we trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3.\n    *   The path from -CH(OH)CH3 (1, down-left) to -CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (2, down-right) to -CH2CH3 (3, up) is **clockwise**.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at **Cβ is R**.\n\n**Analysis of C-gamma (the rightmost chiral center):**\n*   **Groups:**\n    1.  The aminomethyl group: -CH2NH2\n    2.  The group containing Cβ: -CH(Et)CH(OH)CH3\n    3.  The methyl group: -CH3\n    4.  An implied hydrogen atom: -H\n*   **Priorities:**\n    1.  **-CH2NH2**: Carbon bonded to Nitrogen (atomic number 7).\n    2.  **-CH(...)**: Carbon bonded to three other carbons.\n    3.  **-CH3**: Carbon bonded to three hydrogens.\n    Based on the first point of difference, the nitrogen atom gives -CH2NH2 the highest priority. The complex alkyl group is second, methyl is third, and hydrogen is last.\n    *   Priority 1: -CH2NH2\n    *   Priority 2: -CH(Et)CH(OH)CH3\n    *   Priority 3: -CH3\n    *   Priority 4: -H\n*   **Assign Configuration:**\n    *   The bond to Cβ (Priority 2) and the bond to H (Priority 4) are in the plane. The -CH2NH2 group (Priority 1) is wedged (out). The -CH3 group (Priority 3) is dashed (back).\n    *   To determine the configuration, we can swap the group in the back (-CH3, #3) with the lowest priority group (-H, #4). This inverts the configuration.\n    *   In the swapped molecule, H is dashed (back), and CH3 is in the plane.\n    *   Now, view the swapped molecule. H (#4) is in the back. Trace the path 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   The path from -CH2NH2 (1, wedged) to the Cβ group (2, up-left in the plane) to -CH3 (3, down-left in the plane) is **counter-clockwise**.\n    *   So, the swapped molecule has an S configuration. Since we performed one swap, the original molecule must have the opposite configuration.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at **Cγ is R**.\n\n**Analysis of C-alpha (the leftmost chiral center):**\n*   The drawing for this center is unusual, with two dashed bonds (-OH and -CH3). This is geometrically impossible if the main chain is in the plane. This suggests the drawing represents a specific conformation viewed in perspective (e.g., a sawhorse or Newman projection view) or there is a typo. Let's interpret it as a sawhorse projection viewed along the Cβ-Cα bond. This implies a conformation where the hydrogen on Cα points \"up\" and away from Cβ, while both -OH and -CH3 point \"down\".\n*   **Groups:**\n    1.  The hydroxyl group: -OH\n    2.  The group containing Cβ: -CH(Et)CH(CH3)CH2NH2\n    3.  The methyl group: -CH3\n    4.  An implied hydrogen atom: -H\n*   **Priorities:**\n    1.  **-OH**: Oxygen (atomic number 8).\n    2.  **-CH(...)**: Carbon group.\n    3.  **-CH3**: Carbon group.\n    4.  **-H**: Hydrogen.\n    Comparing the two carbon groups, the complex Cβ group has higher priority than the simple methyl group.\n    *   Priority 1: -OH\n    *   Priority 2: -CH(Et)CH(CH3)CH2NH2\n    *   Priority 3: -CH3\n    *   Priority 4: -H\n*   **Assign Configuration:**\n    *   Based on the sawhorse interpretation that resolves the unusual bond drawing, the H atom (Priority 4) is pointing away from the viewer (in the back/up position).\n    *   We can view down the Cα-H bond.\n    *   The remaining groups are arranged clockwise or counter-clockwise. From this viewpoint, the path from -OH (1) to the Cβ group (2) to -CH3 (3) is **clockwise**.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group is in the back, a clockwise path indicates an R configuration.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at **Cα is R**.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\nAll three chiral centers have the R configuration. To report this in standard IUPAC format, we need to number the main chain. The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH), so it is named as an alcohol. The longest carbon chain containing the C-OH group is a pentan-2-ol, with a complex substituent at position 3. The IUPAC name is (2R,3R)-3-((1R)-2-amino-1-methylethyl)pentan-2-ol. The chiral centers correspond to C2, C3 of the main chain, and C1 of the side chain. All are R.\n\nThe configuration of the three chiral centers, from left to right in the drawing, is R, R, R.\n\nFinal determination:\n*   Center with OH group (Cα): R\n*   Center with Ethyl group (Cβ): R\n*   Center with CH2NH2 group (Cγ): R\n\nThe absolute configuration is (R, R, R) for the three chiral centers from left to right. If numbered according to IUPAC rules as 5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol, the chiral centers are C2, C3, and C4, and the configuration is (2R, 3R, 4R).\n\n<<<The absolute configuration of the three chiral centers, from left to right, is R, R, R.>>>"
