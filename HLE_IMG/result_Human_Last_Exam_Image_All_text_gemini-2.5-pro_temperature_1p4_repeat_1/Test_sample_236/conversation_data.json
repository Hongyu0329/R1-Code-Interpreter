    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the subject:** The central figure in the image is a small insect perched on a yellow flower.\n2.  **Observe the insect's physical characteristics:**\n    *   **Coloration:** The insect has a striking black and reddish-orange pattern. This type of bright coloration (aposematism) often serves as a warning to predators.\n    *   **Body Parts:** It has six black legs, two long black antennae, and a distinct head, thorax, and abdomen.\n    *   **Head:** The head is black with a prominent reddish-orange vertical line down the center.\n    *   **Thorax:** The pronotum (the dorsal plate of the first thoracic segment) is reddish-orange with some black markings.\n    *   **Wings/Abdomen:** The folded wings on its back show a pattern of black and reddish-orange patches.\n    *   **Size and Shape:** It has an elongated-oval body shape typical of many \"true bugs.\"\n3.  **Identify the plant:** The insect is on a cluster of small yellow flowers, which appears to be Goldenrod (*Solidago* species).\n4.  **Narrow down the classification:** Based on its body structure (especially the beak-like mouthparts characteristic of the order, though not clearly visible) and coloration, the insect is a \"true bug\" belonging to the order Hemiptera. The specific features strongly suggest it is a seed bug from the family Lygaeidae.\n5.  **Identify the specific species:** The unique combination of the black and reddish-orange markings, especially the line on the head and the pattern on the thorax and wings, are key identifiers for the Large Milkweed Bug.\n6.  **Determine the scientific name:** The scientific name for the Large Milkweed Bug is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*. This name accurately corresponds to the insect depicted.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
