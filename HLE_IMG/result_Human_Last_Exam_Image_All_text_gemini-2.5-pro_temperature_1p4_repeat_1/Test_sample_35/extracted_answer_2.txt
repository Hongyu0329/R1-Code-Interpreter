The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **V-domain of the RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products) receptor**.

This protein could be used as a **prognostic marker** in the pathology of neurological disorders. The diagram shows that S100B binding to RAGE activates signaling pathways (such as NFκβ and JNK/JUN) that directly lead to key events in disease progression: neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. A prognostic marker predicts the likely course or outcome of a disease. Since higher levels of S100B would drive more severe pathology, its concentration can be used to predict the future severity and rate of progression of the disorder, making it a valuable prognostic tool rather than solely an adjunct marker for diagnosis.
