    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Google Trends chart to determine the country.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the nature of the data**\nThe chart displays Google Trends data for three different topics (represented by the red, blue, and yellow lines) from December 2019 to late 2023. Google Trends shows the relative search interest in a topic over time. The most crucial feature of the graph is the presence of sharp, recurring spikes for each color. This pattern strongly suggests that the search terms are related to annual events, such as holidays or anniversaries of historical events.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the pattern for the Red Line**\n*   The red line shows a distinct spike in search interest every December. You can see this pattern repeating near the start of the chart in Dec 2019, and then again in late 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.\n*   This points to an event commemorated annually in December. A major historical event commemorated in the US in December is **Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day** on December 7th. This is a plausible candidate for the red line.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the pattern for the Blue Line**\n*   The blue line has consistent, sharp peaks that occur in the middle of each year, specifically around July.\n*   An annual commemoration in July strongly points to **Independence Day** (the 4th of July) in the United States. This is a cornerstone historical event for the country and is celebrated nationwide every year, which would account for the consistent search interest.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the pattern for the Yellow Line**\n*   The yellow line's pattern is the most revealing. It shows spikes in mid-year, around June.\n*   Critically, the interest level for the yellow line grows dramatically over the period shown. There's a small spike in June 2020, a larger one in June 2021, and then the largest spike on the entire chart (reaching the peak value of 100) occurs in June 2023 (just after the \"May 28, 2023\" mark on the axis).\n*   This pattern perfectly matches the recent history of **Juneteenth** (June 19th) in the United States. Juneteenth commemorates the end of slavery. While it has been celebrated for a long time, it was officially made a federal holiday in June 2021. The Google Trends data reflects this: rising public awareness and search interest, culminating in a massive peak after it became a major national holiday.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the findings and conclude**\n*   The red line corresponds to an event in December (likely Pearl Harbor Day).\n*   The blue line corresponds to an event in July (likely Independence Day).\n*   The yellow line corresponds to an event in June (very likely Juneteenth).\n\nAll three of these major historical events—the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Declaration of Independence, and the end of slavery commemorated by Juneteenth—are central to the history of the **United States**. The confluence of these three specific annual commemorations on a single graph points unequivocally to this country.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
