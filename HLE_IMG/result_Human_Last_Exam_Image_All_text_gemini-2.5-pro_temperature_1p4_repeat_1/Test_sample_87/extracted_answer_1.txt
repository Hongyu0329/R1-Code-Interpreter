**Product A (C₁₄H₂₀N₂O₃):**
The structure is methyl (9-acetyl-1,2,3,3a,4,9-hexahydro-8H-pyrrolo[2,1,5-cd]indolizin-8-yl)carboxylate. It is a tricyclic compound formed via decarboxylation, cycloaddition, Cope rearrangement, and finally N-acetylation.

*(Note: A 2D representation of this complex 3D structure is provided for connectivity. The 'Ac' is an acetyl group, and 'COOMe' is a methyl ester group. The core is a tricyclic pyrrolo[2,1,5-cd]indolizine skeleton.)*

 

**Product B (C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₃):**
The structure is a dehydrogenated lactam derivative of the Cope rearrangement product (P3). For example, a carbonyl group is introduced at the C1 position, and a double bond is formed in the six-membered ring system.

*(Note: A 2D representation of one possible isomer of this complex oxidized structure. The `C=O` indicates the lactam, and the double bond indicates dehydrogenation relative to the P3 intermediate.)*

 

**Product C (C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₃):**
The structure is (S)-1-(3-acetyl-4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid. It's the starting material acetylated on the dihydropyrrole ring.
