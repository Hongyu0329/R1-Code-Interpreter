    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the provided text:** The question describes a perceptual phenomenon with several key characteristics:\n    *   It is an **illusion**.\n    *   It is similar to the **Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity**. The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where a 2D line drawing can be perceived as a 3D cube from two different perspectives, and our perception can flip between them. This suggests the phenomenon in question involves the brain interpreting ambiguous or incomplete sensory information to create a stable perception.\n    *   It reveals a **common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability**. This means it's a process our brains do automatically and frequently in everyday life, likely without us noticing.\n\n2.  **Analyze the provided image:** The image consists of two graphs representing a sound over time.\n    *   The **top graph** is a spectrogram, showing frequency on the y-axis and time on the x-axis. We see a persistent horizontal line, indicating a continuous tone of a single frequency. This line is broken in the middle. At the point of the break, there is a vertical smear, which represents a burst of sound containing a wide range of frequencies, such as white noise or a cough.\n    *   The **bottom graph** is a waveform, showing amplitude on the y-axis and time on the x-axis. It shows a smooth sine wave (a pure tone), which is interrupted in the middle by a complex, irregular waveform (noise), after which the sine wave continues.\n\n3.  **Connect the text and the image:** The image depicts the physical stimulus for a well-known auditory illusion. The stimulus is a sound (a pure tone) that is physically cut off and replaced for a short duration by another sound (a burst of noise).\n    *   When people listen to this, they do not perceive a tone, then noise, then the tone again. Instead, they perceive the tone as continuing *uninterrupted* through the noise. The brain \"fills in\" the missing part of the tone.\n\n4.  **Relate to the clues:**\n    *   **Illusion:** Perceiving a sound that is not physically present is an illusion.\n    *   **Necker Cube Analogy:** The auditory system is presented with an ambiguous situation: did the tone stop, or was it simply masked by the louder noise? The brain resolves this ambiguity by choosing the more plausible real-world explanationâ€”that the tone continued but was temporarily obscured. This is a form of perceptual completion, similar to how the brain constructs a complete 3D cube from an ambiguous 2D drawing.\n    *   **Common, Unconscious Ability:** This auditory \"filling-in\" is a crucial process for understanding speech in noisy environments. Our brains constantly restore speech sounds (phonemes) that are masked by coughs, background noise, or other interruptions. This allows us to perceive a continuous stream of speech. This ability is foundational to communication and happens automatically.\n\n5.  **Identify the name:** This auditory illusion is known generally as the **auditory continuity illusion**. A specific and famous example of this, which precisely matches the description of a common ability used in everyday life, is the **phonemic restoration effect**. Discovered by Richard M. Warren, this effect describes the brain's ability to perceptually restore missing phonemes in a sentence when the gap is filled by noise. The image uses a simple tone to demonstrate the basic principle. Given the description, the question is pointing to this specific, named effect.\n\n<<<Phonemic restoration effect>>>"
