    "I have identified the plant in the image as *Trochetia blackburniana*, also known as the St. Helena redwood. This identification is based on its unique and prominent reticulated leaf venation, leaf shape, and shrub-like appearance. My plan is to research the native habitat of this specific plant to determine the island to which it was endemic. I will then write a simple Python script to print the name of this island.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the island to which the plant in the image,\n  Trochetia blackburniana, was endemic.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The plant identified from the image is Trochetia blackburniana.\n  # Research indicates this plant is endemic to a specific island in the South Atlantic Ocean.\n  island_name = \"Saint Helena\"\n  print(f\"The plant, Trochetia blackburniana, was endemic to the island of {island_name}.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Saint Helena>>>"
