    "To compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph, I will use a method based on graph decomposition. This method is often simpler than repeated application of the deletion-contraction theorem for the entire graph.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the graph structure:** I'll identify the vertices and edges of the graph, and look for notable subgraphs. The given graph `G` has 5 vertices. The subgraph `H` induced by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is a complete graph on four vertices (a K4) with the edge (2, 5) removed. The remaining vertex, 1, is connected only to vertices 2 and 5.\n2.  **Compute the chromatic polynomial of the subgraph H:** I will calculate `P(H, k)` using the property that `H = K4 - e` where `e` is the edge (2,5). The formula is `P(H, k) = P(K4, k) + P(H/e, k)`. The graph `H/e` (H with edge `e` contracted) is a K3.\n3.  **Use case analysis to find P(G, k):** The number of ways to color the full graph `G` depends on the colors assigned to vertices 2 and 5 in the subgraph `H`.\n    *   **Case 1:** Consider the colorings of `H` where `color(2) = color(5)`. For each such coloring, I'll determine the number of available colors for vertex 1.\n    *   **Case 2:** Consider the colorings of `H` where `color(2) â‰  color(5)`. Again, for each of these colorings, I'll find the number of choices for vertex 1.\n4.  **Sum the results:** The total chromatic polynomial `P(G, k)` is the sum of the number of valid colorings from both cases.\n5.  **Final Polynomial Expression:** I will provide a Python script using the `sympy` library to perform the polynomial arithmetic and print the step-by-step calculation, resulting in the final expanded polynomial. The final expression will explicitly show each coefficient as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_chromatic_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes and explains the chromatic polynomial for the given graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    k = sympy.Symbol('k')\n\n    # --- Explanation ---\n    print(\"Step-by-step derivation of the chromatic polynomial P(G, k):\")\n    print(\"Let G be the given graph.
