    "Here is a step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Task:** The goal is to determine which of the four Iridium(III) complexes will have shorter operational lifetimes when used as emitters in Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs). A shorter lifetime implies lower stability.\n\n2.  **Examine the Molecular Structures:**\n    *   All four molecules are cationic Iridium(III) complexes with the general formula `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+`, where `Ir` is the central metal ion, `C^N` is a cyclometalating phenylpyridine-type ligand, and `N^N` is a diimine (4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine) ligand. The counter-ion is `PF6-`.\n    *   The core structure is the same across all four complexes. The only difference is the substitution pattern on the two phenylpyridine `(C^N)` ligands.\n    *   **Complex 1:** Two fluorine atoms on each phenyl ring at the 2- (ortho) and 4- (para) positions.\n    *   **Complex 2:** One fluorine atom on each phenyl ring at the 4- (para) position.\n    *   **Complex 3:** One fluorine atom on each phenyl ring at the 2- (ortho) position.\n    *   **Complex 4:** No fluorine atoms on the phenyl rings.\n\n3.  **Relate Structure to Stability (and Lifetime):** The stability of such complexes, and thus the lifetime of the LEC device, is heavily influenced by:\n    *   **Bond Strength:** The strength of the bonds between the iridium metal center and the ligands, especially the `Ir-C` bond of the cyclometalating ligand, is critical. Weaker bonds can lead to ligand dissociation and degradation.\n    *   **Electrochemical Stability:** The complex must withstand the redox processes (oxidation and reduction) that occur during device operation. Resistance to oxidation is particularly important. A lower Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) energy level generally corresponds to higher stability against oxidation.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Effect of Fluorine Substituents:**\n    *   **Electronic Effect:** Fluorine is the most electronegative element. As an electron-withdrawing group, it pulls electron density from the phenyl ring. This has two key consequences:\n        *   It strengthens the `Ir-C` bond, making the complex more thermally and chemically robust.\n        *   It lowers the energy levels of the molecular orbitals, including the HOMO. A lower HOMO makes the complex harder to oxidize, increasing its operational stability. The more fluorine atoms, the stronger this effect.\n    *   **Steric Effect:** A substituent at the *ortho* position (position 2 on the phenyl ring) is physically close to the `Ir-C` bond. A fluorine atom in this position acts as a \"steric shield,\" physically blocking access to the bond and protecting it from attack by other molecules (like water or oxygen), which could cause degradation. This steric protection is a major contributor to enhanced stability.\n\n5.  **Rank the Complexes by Predicted Stability:**\n    *   **Complex 4 (No F):** This complex lacks any stabilizing effects from fluorine. It will have the weakest `Ir-C` bond and the highest HOMO energy level, making it the most susceptible to degradation. It is expected to have the **shortest lifetime**.\n    *   **Complex 2 (para-F):** This complex benefits from the electronic effect of the para-fluorine, making it more stable than Complex 4. However, it lacks the crucial steric protection of an ortho-substituent.\n    *   **Complex 3 (ortho-F):** This complex has the powerful steric protection from the ortho-fluorine, in addition to a strong electronic effect. It is expected to be significantly more stable than Complexes 4 and 2.\n    *   **Complex 1 (ortho-F and para-F):** This complex benefits from both the steric protection of the ortho-fluorine and the strongest combined electron-withdrawing effect from two fluorine atoms. This should make it the **most stable** complex with the longest lifetime.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The stability ranking (from most stable to least stable) is: **Complex 1 > Complex 3 > Complex 2 > Complex 4**.\n    *   The question asks for the complexes with **shorter lifetimes**. This corresponds to the least stable complexes in the series.\n    *   Complexes 4 and 2 are the two least stable because they lack the critical steric protection afforded by an ortho-fluorine substituent. Therefore, they are expected to have shorter lifetimes compared to Complexes 1 and 3.\n\n7.  **Final Answer Formulation:** The complexes expected to show shorter lifetimes are [2] and [4]. This corresponds to option I. The Python code will formalize and print this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_complex_stability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the stability of four iridium complexes and identifies those\n    with expected shorter lifetimes based on their chemical structure.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the complexes and their key structural features\n    complexes = {\n        1: \"Two fluorine atoms at ortho- and para-positions.
