# Based on the physical analysis of the band structure plots:
# Condition 1: Minimum hopping parameter (t). This corresponds to Simulation 3.
# The hopping parameter t scales the overall bandwidth. While plot 3 has a large energy range,
# this is primarily due to a large overlap 's'. Comparing the shapes and scales suggests t is smallest for plot 3 by elimination.
index_for_min_t = 3

# Condition 2: Minimum overlap magnitude (|s|). This corresponds to Simulation 2.
# The overlap magnitude |s| determines the asymmetry between the conduction and valence bands.
# Plot 2 shows the least asymmetry, indicating the smallest |s|.
index_for_min_s_mag = 2

# Condition 3: Unique sign of overlap (sign(s)). This corresponds to Simulation 4.
# The sign of 's' determines the direction of the band asymmetry. Plots 1, 2, and 3 show a downward shift/stretching (s>0),
# while Plot 4 shows an upward shift/stretching (s<0). Thus, Plot 4 has a unique sign.
index_for_unique_s_sign = 4

# Condition 4: Maximum overlap (s). This corresponds to Simulation 1.
# A larger positive 's' leads to greater asymmetry. Plot 1 exhibits the largest asymmetry among plots 1, 2, and 3 (which have positive s).
# Therefore, it corresponds to the maximum value of s.
index_for_max_s = 1

# The final answer is the sequence of indices corresponding to conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4.
