    Solves the cellular automata mapping puzzle based on visual analysis.

    The function maps the short-term evolution patterns (1-15) to their
    corresponding long-term evolution patterns (A-O). The mapping is
    determined by matching visual characteristics and plausible evolutionary
    trajectories.
