    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **IUPAC Naming**: First, I will determine the correct IUPAC name for the molecule. This involves identifying the principal functional group (alcohol has priority over amine), finding the longest carbon chain containing it, and numbering the chain to give the principal group the lowest possible locant.\n2.  **Identify Chiral Centers**: Based on the IUPAC name and structure, I will identify all stereocenters (chiral carbons) in the molecule. A carbon atom is chiral if it is bonded to four different groups.\n3.  **Assign Priorities**: For each chiral center, I will assign priorities (1-4) to the four attached groups based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules, where higher atomic numbers get higher priority.\n4.  **Determine R/S Configuration**: I will analyze the 3D arrangement of the groups as depicted by the wedge and dash notation in the image. By orienting the molecule so the lowest priority group (4) points away from the viewer, I will determine the direction of the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3. A clockwise path indicates an 'R' configuration, and a counter-clockwise path indicates an 'S' configuration. If the lowest priority group points towards the viewer, the result is reversed.\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script that programmatically follows these steps to determine the configuration for each chiral center and prints the final result. The script will hardcode the molecular structure and stereochemistry as interpreted from the drawing and apply the CIP rules logic to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# A helper class to capture print output for final formatting\nclass OutputCapture:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.captured_output = io.StringIO()\n        self.original_stdout = sys.stdout\n\n    def start(self):\n        sys.stdout = self.captured_output\n\n    def stop(self):\n        sys.stdout = self.original_stdout\n        return self.captured_output.getvalue()\n\ndef solve_absolute_configuration():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the absolute configuration of the molecule shown in the image.\n    It follows the IUPAC naming conventions and Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the molecule's structure based on analysis of the image.\n    # The structure is identified as 5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol.\n    # Stereochemistry is interpreted from the wedge/dash notation, resolving ambiguities\n    # by assuming a valid tetrahedral geometry for each carbon atom.\n    molecule = {\n        'name': '5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol',\n        'chiral_centers': {\n            'C2': {\n                'groups': ['OH', 'C1', 'C3', 'H'],\n                'stereo': {'OH': 'dash', 'C1': 'dash', 'C3': 'plane', 'H': 'wedge'},\n                'comment': \"Based on the drawing, OH and the adjacent CH3 (C1) are dashed.
