    # Step 2: Determine the sun's direction.
    # The problem states it's "before breakfast," so it's morning.
    # In the Northern Hemisphere (Canada), the sun rises in the East.
    sun_direction = "East"

    # Step 3: Explain the waggle dance principle.
    print("Logic Explanation:")
    print("1. The image shows a honeybee performing a 'waggle dance' to communicate the location of a nectar source to other bees.")
    print("2. Inside the dark hive, bees use the vertical direction ('up,' against gravity) on the honeycomb as a reference for the sun's position.")
    print("3. A dance performed straight up means 'fly towards the sun.' A dance straight down means 'fly away from the sun.' An angle from 'up' corresponds to the same angle from the sun's direction.")

    # Step 4: Analyze the dance in the image.
    observed_dance_direction = "upward"
    print(f"\n4. In the image, the blurred bee is performing the waggle run in an almost directly {observed_dance_direction} direction.")

    # Step 5: Combine the information to find the foraging direction.
    print(f"\n5. Since the dance is {observed_dance_direction}, the bees are being told to fly towards the sun.")
    print(f"6. It is {time_of_day}, so the sun is in the {sun_direction}.")
    
    food_source_direction = sun_direction
    print(f"7. Therefore, the bees are flying to the {food_source_direction}.")

    # The final answer is D.
