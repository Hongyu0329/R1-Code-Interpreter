    "This problem asks us to identify the two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions that occur in the given transformation.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Product:** We start with hexafluorobenzene (C6F6) and cyclobutene (C4H4). The reaction is driven by light (hv). The product is a complex tricyclic molecule.\n2.  **Propose a Mechanism:** The reaction is unlikely to be a single step. Since it's a photochemical reaction involving a benzene derivative, a common first step is the formation of a valence isomer.\n    *   **Step 1: Valence Isomerization.** Hexafluorobenzene, upon absorbing light, can rearrange to its high-energy valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This is a known photochemical process for benzene derivatives. This reaction can be classified as a pericyclic reaction.\n    *   **Step 2: Cycloaddition.** The resulting Dewar benzene is highly strained and much more reactive than the starting benzene ring. It has two double bonds and can readily react with cyclobutene in a cycloaddition reaction.\n3.  **Verify the Mechanism:** We will trace the atoms through this proposed two-step mechanism and compare the final structure to the product shown in the image. A key feature to check is the location of the double bond and the substituents (F and H atoms) in the final product.\n    *   The product of the proposed mechanism would be formed from a [2+2] cycloaddition between one of the double bonds of Dewar benzene and the double bond of cyclobutene. The other double bond of Dewar benzene (which has two fluorine atoms on it) would remain in the final product.\n    *   The image of the product shows a tricyclic structure with one double bond that has two fluorine substituents. This perfectly matches the prediction from our proposed mechanism. Alternative mechanisms, such as an initial cycloaddition followed by a rearrangement, predict a product where the double bond has hydrogen substituents, which contradicts the provided image.\n4.  **Classify the Reactions:**\n    *   **Reaction 1:** The valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to Dewar benzene is a pericyclic reaction involving the 6 pi-electrons of the benzene ring. It can be classified as a **6-pi electrocyclic reaction**. It is photochemically allowed (disrotatory).\n    *   **Reaction 2:** The reaction between Dewar benzene and cyclobutene involves two pi systems (one 2-electron system from each molecule) coming together to form a four-membered ring. This is a classic **[2+2] cycloaddition**. This reaction is also photochemically allowed.\n5.  **Final Output:** We will use a Python script to print the names of these two reactions, including the relevant numbers (6, 2, 2) as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction_mechanism():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and describes the two pericyclic reactions\n    involved in the transformation.\n    \"\"\"\n    reaction1_name = \"6-pi electrocyclic reaction\"\n    reaction1_number = 6\n    \n    reaction2_name = \"[2+2] cycloaddition\"\n    reaction2_numbers = (2, 2)\n    \n    print(\"The two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are:\")\n    print(f\"1.

A photochemical [{reaction2_numbers[0]}+{reaction2_numbers[1]}] cycloaddition (between Dewar benzene and cyclobutene).\")\n\nsolve_reaction_mechanism()\n```\n<<<A 6-pi electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition>>>"
