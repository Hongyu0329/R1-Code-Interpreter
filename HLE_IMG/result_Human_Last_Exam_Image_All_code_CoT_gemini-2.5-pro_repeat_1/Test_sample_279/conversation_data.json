    "My plan is to first analyze the provided image of the tooth lesion. I will identify the location of the decay on the tooth surface. Based on this location, I will apply the most common dental caries classification system, G.V. Black's Classification, to determine the correct code. The Python script will then print out the reasoning based on this system and provide the final classification.\n\n```python\ndef get_caries_classification():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the features of a dental lesion from an image and classifies it\n    according to G.V. Black's Classification system.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the lesion from the image.\")\n    print(\"- The tooth is a posterior tooth (a molar).\")\n    print(\"- There is an existing metallic (amalgam) filling.\")\n    print(\"- New decay (caries) is visible around the margin of the filling.\")\n    print(\"- The location of this decay is on the occlusal (chewing) surface, in the pits and fissures.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Applying G.V.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    According to the provided image, which caries classification code does this lesion correspond to?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
