    Analyzes the reaction and determines its type.

    1.  The reaction combines two molecules (an alkene derivative and maleic anhydride) to form a single larger molecule with a new ring. This is a cycloaddition.
    2.  The new ring is a six-membered ring (a cyclohexene derivative).
    3.  This ring is formed from a 4-atom piece (from the propene derivative) and a 2-atom piece (from the maleic anhydride).
    4.  A cycloaddition that combines a 4-pi electron system and a 2-pi electron system to form a six-membered ring is called a [4+2] cycloaddition.
    5.  The common name for a [4+2] cycloaddition is the Diels-Alder reaction.
    6.  Therefore, the reaction is best classified as a Diels-Alder reaction.
