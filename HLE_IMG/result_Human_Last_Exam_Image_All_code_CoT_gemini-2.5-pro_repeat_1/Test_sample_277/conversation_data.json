    "The image containing the molecules is missing. Therefore, I cannot definitively determine the relationship between them.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with a Python script that will guide you through the process of identifying the type of isomers once you have the molecular structures. This script works like a decision tree to help you classify the molecules based on their properties.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Check Molecular Formula:** The first step in comparing two molecules is to see if they have the same molecular formula. If they don't, they are not isomers.\n2.  **Check Connectivity (Constitution):** If the formulas are the same, the next step is to check if the atoms are connected in the same order. If the connectivity is different, they are **constitutional isomers**.\n3.  **Check Spatial Arrangement (Stereochemistry):** If the formulas and connectivity are the same, the molecules are **stereoisomers** (or identical). We then need to look at their 3D arrangement.\n    *   **Identical:** If the molecules are superimposable (meaning you can place one on top of the other and they match perfectly), they are identical.\n    *   **Conformers:** If the molecules can be interconverted simply by rotating around single bonds, they are conformational isomers, or **conformers**.\n    *   **Stereoisomers:** If they are not identical and cannot be interconverted by simple bond rotation, they are configurational stereoisomers.\n\nYou can run the following Python code and answer the questions to find the relationship between your molecules.\n\n```python\ndef classify_isomers():\n    \"\"\"\n    An interactive guide to classify the relationship between two molecules.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Isomer Classification Guide ---\")\n    print(\"Please have the structures of your two molecules (Molecule A and Molecule B) ready.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Check Molecular Formula\n    print(\"Step 1: Molecular Formula\")\n    print(\"An isomer must have the same molecular formula (e.g., both are C6H12O6).\")\n    formula_same = input(\"Do Molecule A and Molecule B have the same molecular formula?
