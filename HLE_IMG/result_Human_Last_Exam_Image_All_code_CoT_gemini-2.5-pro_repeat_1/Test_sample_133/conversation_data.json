    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided mass spectrum.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecular Ion (M+) Peak and Isotopic Pattern:**\n    *   The peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) are in the range of 260-266.\n    *   Let's examine the cluster: m/z 260 (I=34.8%), 262 (I=29.0%), 264 (I=12.9%), 266 (I=3.22%).\n    *   The relative intensities are approximately 100 : 83 : 37 : 9 (normalizing to m/z 260).\n    *   The theoretical isotopic pattern for a compound with three chlorine atoms (Cl3) is approximately M:M+2:M+4:M+6 = 100:98:32:3.5.\n    *   The observed pattern strongly matches the presence of **three chlorine atoms**. The monoisotopic molecular ion peak (containing only ³⁵Cl) is at **m/z 260**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   The mass of the molecule using the most common isotopes is 260 u.\n    *   The mass contributed by the three chlorine atoms is 3 × 35 u = 105 u.\n    *   The mass of the rest of the molecule (the non-halogen part) is 260 u - 105 u = 155 u.\n    *   We need to find a formula for a hydrocarbon fragment (CₓHᵧ) that has a mass of 155 u. Dividing by the mass of carbon (12 u): 155 / 12 ≈ 12.9. This suggests 12 carbon atoms.\n    *   Mass of 12 carbons (C₁₂) = 12 × 12 = 144 u.\n    *   Remaining mass for hydrogen = 155 - 144 = 11 u. This corresponds to 11 hydrogen atoms (H₁₁).\n    *   Therefore, the non-halogen part is **C₁₂H₁₁**.\n    *   The full molecular formula of the compound is **C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Key Fragment Peaks to Deduce the Structure:**\n    *   **Base Peak (m/z 225, I=100%):** The difference from the molecular ion is 260 - 225 = 35 u. This corresponds to the loss of one chlorine atom (`.Cl`). The base peak is the `[M-Cl]⁺` ion. Its high stability suggests the lost chlorine was attached to a position that allows for the formation of a highly stabilized carbocation (e.g., allylic or benzylic).\n    *   **Peak at m/z 190 (I=48.4%):** The difference from the molecular ion is 260 - 190 = 70 u. This could be loss of Cl₂. However, it's more likely a sequential loss of `.Cl` (35 u) and then `HCl` (36 u). 260 - 35 - 36 = 189. This is very close to 190, suggesting the peak is `[M-Cl-HCl]⁺`.\n    *   **Peak at m/z 145 (I=9.37%):** This mass corresponds to a dichlorophenyl cation, `[C₆H₃Cl₂]⁺` (6×12 + 3×1 + 2×35 = 72 + 3 + 70 = 145). This suggests the structure contains a dichlorophenyl group.\n\n4.  **Propose a Structure and IUPAC Name:**\n    *   Based on the evidence (formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃, a dichlorophenyl group, and fragmentation behavior), a plausible structure is a dichlorobenzene ring attached to a chlorocyclohexene ring.\n    *   A structure that fits all the data is **1-(2-chlorocyclohex-1-en-1-yl)-2,4-dichlorobenzene**.\n        *   **Formula Check:** The dichlorophenyl group is C₆H₃Cl₂. The attached 2-chlorocyclohex-1-enyl group is C₆H₈Cl. The total formula is C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃. Correct.\n        *   **Fragmentation Check:** Loss of the allylic chlorine from the cyclohexene ring forms a stable `[M-Cl]⁺` cation (m/z 225), explaining the base peak. Fission of the bond between the two rings gives the `[C₆H₃Cl₂]⁺` fragment (m/z 145).\n    *   The systematic IUPAC name for this structure, treating the benzene ring as the parent compound, is **1-(2-chlorocyclohex-1-en-1-yl)-2,4-dichlorobenzene**.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes these calculations to confirm the identity of the compound.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_mass(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the monoisotopic mass of a chemical formula using integer masses.\"\"\"\n    atomic_masses = {'C': 12, 'H': 1, 'Cl': 35, 'O': 16, 'N': 14}\n    mass = 0\n    import re\n    # Find all element-count pairs in the formula\n    for element, count in re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]?)(\\d*)', formula):\n        if count == '':\n            count = 1\n        else:\n            count = int(count)\n        mass += atomic_masses[element] * count\n    return mass\n\ndef analyze_mass_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided mass spectrum data to identify the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Mass Spectrum Analysis ---\")\n\n    # 1.
