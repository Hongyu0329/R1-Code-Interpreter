    full_circle = 12
    # A quarter turn is 12 / 4 = 3 hour-marks.
    quarter_turn = 3

    # The hour hand moves 3 hour-marks per tick.
    hour_hand_speed = 3
    # The minute hand gains 3 hour-marks on the hour hand per tick.
    # This is their relative speed.

    # --- Step 2: Calculate the number of ticks until they meet ---
    # The hands start together. They will meet again when the faster minute hand
    # has "lapped" the slower hour hand, meaning it has gained a full circle.
    # The equation is: Ticks_to_meet * Relative_Speed = Full_Circle

    # --- Step 3: Calculate the meeting position on the clock face ---
    # We find the position by tracking the hour hand's movement.
    # It starts at 12 (which is 0 in modulo 12 math).
    # The equation is: Position = (Hour_Hand_Speed * Ticks) mod 12
    position_calculation = (hour_hand_speed * ticks_to_meet)
    meeting_position_mod = position_calculation % full_circle

    # On a clock, a modulo result of 0 means the hand is at 12.
    meeting_position = 12 if meeting_position_mod == 0 else meeting_position_mod

    print("Next, we find the position on the clock where they meet.")

    print(f"A result of 0 corresponds to the 12 o'clock position.")

    # --- Step 4: State the final answer in the required format ---
    # The meeting position is at the 12 mark. When both hands point to 12,
    # the time is represented as 12:00.
