    # The new flagellum grows alongside the old one.
    # If we imagine looking from the posterior of the cell towards the anterior (the direction of view in images 2 and 3),
    # the new flagellum is positioned to the LEFT of the old flagellum.

    # Step 2: Apply the rule to Image 2.

    # Step 3: Apply the rule to Image 3.
    # Image 3 is also a transverse section viewed from posterior to anterior.
    # Similar to image 2, it has a left and a right flagellum.
    # Applying the same rule, the flagellum on the left must be the new one.
