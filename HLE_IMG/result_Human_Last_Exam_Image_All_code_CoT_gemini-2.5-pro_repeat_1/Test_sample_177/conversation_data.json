    "Here is a plan to calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled):\n\n1.  **Extract Data:** Pull all the necessary percentages and values from the \"Baseline\" (Table 1) and \"Proposed\" (Table 2) scenarios. This includes:\n    *   The share of total trips for each distance category (0-3, 3-5, 5-10, 10+ miles).\n    *   The average trip distance for each category.\n    *   The mode share for both car types ('car, 1 occupant' and 'car, with more than 2 occupants') for each distance category in both tables.\n\n2.  **Calculate Total Car VMT Index for Baseline:**\n    *   For each distance category, we'll calculate a weighted VMT. The formula for each category is: `(Share of Total Trips) * (Total Car Mode Share) * (Average Trip Distance)`.\n    *   The \"Total Car Mode Share\" is the sum of the mode shares for 'car, 1 occupant' and 'car, with more than 2 occupants'.\n    *   Sum the weighted VMT from all four distance categories to get the total Baseline VMT Index. This index represents the average miles traveled by car per trip across all trips.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Car VMT Index for Proposed:**\n    *   Repeat the same calculation as in step 2, but using the mode share data from the \"Proposed\" table.\n\n4.  **Calculate Percentage Reduction:**\n    *   Use the standard formula for percentage change:\n        `((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100`.\n\nThis will give us the final percentage reduction in Car VMT. Note that the \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" figures are not needed for calculating the Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), which measures the distance traveled by the vehicle itself, not the number of people in it.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef solve_vmt_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage reduction in Car VMT based on the provided tables.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the data from the tables\n    # Data is consistent across both tables unless specified\n    distance_categories = ['0-3 miles', '3-5 miles', '5-10 miles', '10+ miles']\n    share_of_total_trips = [0.48, 0.22, 0.14, 0.16]  # 48%, 22%, 14%, 16%\n    average_trip_distance = [1, 4, 7.5, 20]\n\n    # Baseline mode shares (Table 1)\n    baseline_car_1_occ = [0.25, 0.38, 0.40, 0.42]\n    baseline_car_gt2_occ = [0.28, 0.43, 0.45, 0.47]\n\n    # Proposed mode shares (Table 2)\n    proposed_car_1_occ = [0.01, 0.08, 0.14, 0.16]\n    proposed_car_gt2_occ = [0.02, 0.19, 0.27, 0.33]\n\n    # Combine car shares for total car mode share\n    baseline_total_car_share = [a + b for a, b in zip(baseline_car_1_occ, baseline_car_gt2_occ)]\n    proposed_total_car_share = [a + b for a, b in zip(proposed_car_1_occ, proposed_car_gt2_occ)]\n\n    # Step 2 & 3: Calculate VMT Index for Baseline and Proposed\n    baseline_vmt_terms = []\n    proposed_vmt_terms = []\n\n    for i in range(len(distance_categories)):\n        baseline_vmt_terms.append(share_of_total_trips[i] * baseline_total_car_share[i] * average_trip_distance[i])\n        proposed_vmt_terms.append(share_of_total_trips[i] * proposed_total_car_share[i] * average_trip_distance[i])\n    \n    baseline_vmt = sum(baseline_vmt_terms)\n    proposed_vmt = sum(proposed_vmt_terms)\n\n    # Print the calculation steps\n    print(\"This calculation determines a VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled) index, representing the average miles traveled by car per trip across the entire system.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Baseline Car VMT Index Calculation ---\")\n    baseline_eq = \" + \".join([f\"({sot:.2f} * {cs:.2f} * {d})\" for sot, cs, d in zip(share_of_total_trips, baseline_total_car_share, average_trip_distance)])\n    print(f\"Baseline VMT Index = {baseline_eq}\")\n    print(f\"                     = {' + '.join([f'{t:.4f}' for t in baseline_vmt_terms])}\")\n    print(f\"                     = {baseline_vmt:.4f}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Proposed Car VMT Index Calculation ---\")\n    proposed_eq = \" + \".join([f\"({sot:.2f} * {cs:.2f} * {d})\" for sot, cs, d in zip(share_of_total_trips, proposed_total_car_share, average_trip_distance)])\n    print(f\"Proposed VMT Index = {proposed_eq}\")\n    print(f\"                   = {' + '.join([f'{t:.4f}' for t in proposed_vmt_terms])}\")\n    print(f\"                   = {proposed_vmt:.4f}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the percentage reduction\n    vmt_reduction = baseline_vmt - proposed_vmt\n    percentage_reduction = (vmt_reduction / baseline_vmt) * 100\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Percentage Reduction Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"Reduction = (Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT\")\n    print(f\"          = (({baseline_vmt:.4f} - {proposed_vmt:.4f}) / {baseline_vmt:.4f}) * 100\")\n    print(f\"          = ({vmt_reduction:.4f} / {baseline_vmt:.4f}) * 100\")\n    print(f\"          = {percentage_reduction:.1f}%\")\n    \n    return percentage_reduction\n\n# Run the calculation and get the final answer\nfinal_answer = solve_vmt_reduction()\nprint(f\"\\nBy changing the composition of mode share, the Car VMT can be reduced by {final_answer:.1f}%.\")\nprint(f\"<<<{final_answer:.1f}>>>\")\n```"
