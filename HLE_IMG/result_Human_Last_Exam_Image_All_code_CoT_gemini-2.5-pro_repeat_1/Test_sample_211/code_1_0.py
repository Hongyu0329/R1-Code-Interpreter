    This function solves the visual identification task.
    By analyzing the unique feather patterns on the Sociable Weaver,
    we can re-identify the individual bird.

    1. The target image shows a bird with a specific scalloped pattern on its back.
    2. We need to find the image from A-I that has the identical pattern.
    3. Image C shows a bird with the exact same posture, lighting, and, most importantly,
       an identical arrangement of the scalloped feathers on the back and wings.
       Even the background elements (the dark post) align.
