    "I will identify the tick and assess the risk of Lyme disease based on its species.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Tick (a):** I will examine the visual characteristics of the tick in the image, such as its size, color, markings on its back (scutum), and the shape of its mouthparts. I will compare these features to known characteristics of common tick species found in North America. The ornate, whitish pattern on the scutum is a key feature.\n2.  **Assess Lyme Disease Risk (b):** Once the tick species is identified, I will determine if it is a known vector for Lyme disease (*Borrelia burgdorferi*). The primary vector for Lyme disease is the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*). I will state whether the identified tick transmits this disease.\n\n```python\ndef solve_tick_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the tick from the image and assesses the associated\n    risk of Lyme disease transmission.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Part (a): Identify the tick\n    tick_identification = (\n        \"(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (Dermacentor variabilis), \"\n        \"most likely an adult male.

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
