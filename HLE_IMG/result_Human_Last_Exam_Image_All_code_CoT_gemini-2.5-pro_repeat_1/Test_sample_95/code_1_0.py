# Step 1: Define known values
# ry is the radius of a yellow circle. Diameter is 1cm, so radius is 0.5cm.
ry = 0.5

# Step 2: Solve for R, the radius of a white circle.
# The equation (R + ry)^2 = R^2 + (R - ry)^2 represents the geometric relationship
# between a yellow circle nestled between two white circles.
# (R + 0.5)^2 = R^2 + (R - 0.5)^2
# R^2 + R + 0.25 = R^2 + R^2 - R + 0.25
# R = R^2 - R
# R^2 - 2R = 0
# R(R - 2) = 0
# Since R > 0, R must be 2.
R = 2.0

# Step 3: Determine the grid layout.
# The distance between centers of two tangent white circles is 2R = 4.
# Let the center coordinates be (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
# (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 = (2R)^2 = 16.
# Since all coordinates are multiples of 0.5, the differences (x2-x1) and (y2-y1) are also multiples of 0.5.
# Let x2-x1 = a/2 and y2-y1 = b/2. The equation becomes a^2 + b^2 = 64.
# The only integer solutions are (0, 8) and (8, 0).
# This means the coordinate offsets are (0, 4) or (4, 0).
# This proves the circles are on a square grid with spacing of 4 cm.
grid_spacing = 2 * R

print(f"The center-to-center spacing is 2 * R = {grid_spacing} cm.")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 4: Calculate the coordinates.
# Y-coordinate of the center of the bottom row (y1), derived from tangency with a yellow circle at y=0.5:
# (x_diff)^2 + (y1 - ry)^2 = (R + ry)^2. With x_diff=R=2 for square packing gap:
# 2^2 + (y1 - 0.5)^2 = 2.5^2
# 4 + (y1 - 0.5)^2 = 6.25
# (y1 - 0.5)^2 = 2.25 => y1 - 0.5 = 1.5 => y1 = 2.0
y1 = 2.0
y2 = y1 + grid_spacing
y3 = y2 + grid_spacing

# X-coordinate of the leftmost column, assuming tangency to the left wall (x=0):
x1 = R
x2 = x1 + grid_spacing
x3 = x2 + grid_spacing

# The right-most circles are in the column x = x3.
right_most_x = x3
# The question singles out one circle. In the image, the middle row is the one
# that extends furthest right. So we choose the y-coordinate of the middle row.
target_y = y2
