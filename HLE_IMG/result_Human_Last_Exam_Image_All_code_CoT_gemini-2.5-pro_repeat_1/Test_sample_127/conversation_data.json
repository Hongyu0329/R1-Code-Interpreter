    "To determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely, we need to analyze the steric hindrance around the single C-C bond that connects each phenyl ring to the main molecular structure.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify Potential Rotating Rings:** Rotation can occur around single bonds. The phenyl rings labeled G, H, J, K, and L are each connected to the larger ligand framework by a single C-C bond. Therefore, these are the candidates for free rotation. The rings A, B, C, D, E, and F are part of rigid, fused, or chelating systems and cannot rotate freely.\n\n2.  **Analyze Steric Hindrance for Each Ring:**\n    *   **Rings H and J:** Ring H is attached to position 4 of ring A. Ring J is attached to position 4 of ring C. These positions are \"para\" to the bond connecting to the pyridine rings (B and D) and \"meta\" to the Iridium-carbon bond. They point away from the bulky central metal complex. There is very little steric hindrance, so rings **H** and **J** can rotate freely.\n    *   **Ring G:** This ring is attached to position 6 of pyridine ring D. This position is \"ortho\" to the coordinating nitrogen atom. While this is closer to the metal center than H and J, the ring is still positioned to point away from the most congested areas of the complex. Therefore, ring **G** is also considered to be freely rotating.\n    *   **Rings K and L:** Ring K is attached to position 6 of ring A. Ring L is attached to position 6 of ring C. Position 6 on both rings A and C is the cyclometalation site, meaning it is directly bonded to the Iridium (Ir) atom. A phenyl group at this position is ortho to the bulky metal center and its other ligands (like rings E and F). This creates a very crowded environment, leading to a significant steric clash upon rotation. Therefore, the rotation of rings **K** and **L** is severely hindered.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, the phenyl rings that can rotate freely are G, J, and H.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this reasoning to arrive at the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ring_rotation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the rotation of phenyl rings in the given coordination complex.\n    \"\"\"\n    # All substituent phenyl rings are potential candidates for rotation.\n    substituent_rings = {'G', 'H', 'J', 'K', 'L'}\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify all substituent phenyl rings attached by single bonds.\")\n    print(f\"Candidates for free rotation: {sorted(list(substituent_rings))}\\n\")\n\n    # Rings K and L are attached at the cyclometalation sites (C6 of A and C),\n    # which are bonded directly to the central Iridium atom.\n    # This position is extremely sterically hindered.\n    hindered_rings = {'K', 'L'}\n    print(\"Step 2: Identify rings with hindered rotation due to severe steric clash.\")\n    print(\"Rings attached ortho to the C-Ir cyclometalation site are sterically hindered.\")\n    print(f\"Hindered rings: {sorted(list(hindered_rings))}\\n\")\n\n    # The freely rotating rings are the ones not in the hindered set.\n    freely_rotating_rings = substituent_rings - hindered_rings\n    print(\"Step 3: Determine the freely rotating rings by excluding the hindered ones.\")\n    print(\"The remaining rings (G, H, J) are attached at positions with low steric hindrance and can rotate freely.\")\n    \n    # Sort for consistent ordering before printing.\n    final_rings = sorted(list(freely_rotating_rings))\n    \n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(\"The phenyl rings that can rotate freely are:\")\n    # The prompt requires printing each \"number\" (in this case, letter) in the final answer.\n    print(f\"{', '.join(final_rings)}\")\n\nsolve_ring_rotation()\n<<<E>>>"
