    "Based on the heraldic elements present in the image, I can identify the city with a very similar coat of arms.\n\nHere is my step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Shield Colors and Division:** The shield is divided horizontally (\"per fess\"). The top field is blue (\"azure\"), and the bottom field is gold (\"or\").\n2.  **Charges (Symbols on the shield):**\n    *   The top blue field contains a crescent moon.\n    *   The bottom gold field contains a black crab.\n3.  **Supporters:** The shield is flanked by two branches: an olive branch on the left and an oak branch on the right.\n4.  **Crest:** A crown sits atop the shield.\n\nThis specific combination of a blue and gold shield, a crab, a moon, and olive/oak branch supporters is characteristic of the coat of arms of **Constanța**, a city in Romania. While the image shown has minor artistic differences from the official coat of arms (such as the style of the crown and the specific orientation of the moon), the core elements are a clear match.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the city.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the city based on its coat of arms.\n  The coat of arms in the image features:\n  - A shield divided horizontally: blue on top, gold on the bottom.\n  - A crescent moon in the blue section.\n  - A black crab in the gold section.\n  - An olive branch and an oak branch flanking the shield.\n  These elements are characteristic of the coat of arms of the city of Constanța, Romania.\n  \"\"\"\n  city_name = \"Constanța, Romania\"\n  print(f\"The city with a very similar coat of arms is: {city_name}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Constanța, Romania>>>"
