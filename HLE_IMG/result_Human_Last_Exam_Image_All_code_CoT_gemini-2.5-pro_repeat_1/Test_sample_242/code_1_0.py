    # Step 1: Analyze the structure of the product and the constraints.
    # The product has a quaternary carbon atom where R1 and R2 are attached.
    # A quaternary carbon must be bonded to four non-hydrogen atoms.
    # The starting material provides two methyl (Me) groups and various hydrogen (H) atoms for the R-group positions.
    # Therefore, two of the R-groups must be Me, and two must be H.

    # Step 2: Evaluate the answer choices based on the quaternary center.
    # Options C, D, and E state that R1 = H and R2 = H.
    # If R1 and R2 are both H, the carbon they are attached to would be a CH2 group, not a quaternary center.
    # This contradicts the product structure. So, C, D, and E are eliminated.
    print("Step 1: Analyzing the product structure.")
    print("The carbon with substituents R1 and R2 is a quaternary center.")
    print("Options C, D, and E state R1=H and R2=H, which would make it a CH2 group, not a quaternary center.")
    print("Therefore, options C, D, and E are incorrect.\n")

    # Step 3: We are left with options A, B, and F.
    # These options correctly identify R1 and R2 as Me groups and R3 and R4 as H groups.
    # The choice among A, B, and F depends on stereochemistry.
    print("Step 2: Analyzing the stereochemistry.")
    print("The starting material shows one methyl group pointing UP and another pointing DOWN.")
    print("This means the two methyl groups have an 'anti' relative stereochemistry.\n")
    
    # Step 4: Assume the relative stereochemistry is conserved during the reaction.
    # The product should also have the two methyl groups in an 'anti' configuration.
    print("Step 3: Evaluating the remaining options based on stereochemistry.")
    
    # Option A: R1 = Me UP, R2 = Me UP. Both are pointing UP, which is a 'syn' relationship. Incorrect.
    print("Option A: R1=Me UP, R2=Me UP. This is a 'syn' relationship. Incorrect.")
    
    # Option B: R1 = Me UP, R2 = Me UP. Both are pointing UP, which is a 'syn' relationship. Incorrect.
    print("Option B: R1=Me UP, R2=Me UP. This is a 'syn' relationship. Incorrect.")
    
    # Option F: R1 = Me UP, R2 = Me DOWN. One is UP, one is DOWN. This is an 'anti' relationship. Correct.
    print("Option F: R1=Me UP, R2=Me DOWN. This is an 'anti' relationship. This matches the starting material.\n")

    # Step 5: Final conclusion.
    final_answer = 'F'
    print("Conclusion: Option F is the only one that is consistent with both the product's quaternary center and the 'anti' stereochemistry of the methyl groups from the starting material.")
