# The user wants to identify the giraffe from the target image.
# By carefully comparing the unique spot patterns of each giraffe,
# we can determine the correct match.

# The pattern of spots on a giraffe is unique, like a human fingerprint.
# Let's analyze the target giraffe's pattern, focusing on the torso.
# There is a specific arrangement of large and small, irregularly shaped brown spots.

# Now, let's compare this pattern to the options:
# Giraffe A: The spots are lighter in color and the pattern does not match.
# Giraffe B: The arrangement and shapes of the spots are different.
# Giraffe C: The color is much lighter and the pattern is not the same.
# Giraffe D: The spots are very dark and the pattern is distinctly different.
# Giraffe E: The shapes, sizes, and arrangement of the spots on the torso are a clear and exact match to the target giraffe.
# Giraffe F: The spots appear more rounded and the pattern does not match the target.

# Conclusion: The spot pattern on giraffe E is identical to the target giraffe.
