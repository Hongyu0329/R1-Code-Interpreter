    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the thinking process to determine the Jones polynomial for the given knot.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** The knot displayed in the image is a composite knot known as the **square knot**. It's formed by the connected sum of a right-handed trefoil knot (denoted as `3_1`) and a left-handed trefoil knot (denoted as `-3_1` or `3_1*`). The diagram shows 10 crossings, which is a valid, though not minimal, representation of this knot.\n\n2.  **Recall Properties of the Jones Polynomial:** A key property of the Jones polynomial, `V(t)`, is that for a connected sum of two knots, `K1` and `K2`, the resulting polynomial is the product of their individual polynomials:\n    `V(K1 # K2) = V(K1) * V(K2)`\n\n3.  **Find the Polynomials for Trefoil Knots:**\n    *   Using the standard convention (as found on resources like the Knot Atlas), the Jones polynomial for the right-handed trefoil knot (`3_1`) is:\n        `V(3_1) = t⁻¹ + t⁻³ - t⁻⁴`\n    *   The polynomial for the mirror image of a knot is found by substituting `t` with `t⁻¹`. Therefore, for the left-handed trefoil knot (`-3_1`), the polynomial is:\n        `V(-3_1) = (t⁻¹)⁻¹ + (t⁻¹)⁻³ - (t⁻¹)⁻⁴ = t + t³ - t⁴`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Product:** To find the Jones polynomial for the square knot, we multiply the polynomials of its components:\n    `V(square knot) = V(3_1) * V(-3_1)`\n    `V(square knot) = (t⁻¹ + t⁻³ - t⁻⁴) * (t + t³ - t⁴)`\n\n5.  **Code the Calculation and Formatting:** I will use Python with the `sympy` library to perform the polynomial multiplication accurately and then format the resulting Laurent polynomial into a string, ordered by decreasing powers of `t`, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef get_knot_jones_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the Jones polynomial for the square knot.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable for the polynomial\n    t = sympy.Symbol('t')\n\n    # The Jones polynomial for the right-handed trefoil knot (3_1)\n    # according to the standard convention.\n    # V(3_1) = t^-1 + t^-3 - t^-4\n    V_3_1 = t**(-1) + t**(-3) - t**(-4)\n\n    # The knot in the image is the square knot (3_1 # -3_1).\n    # Its Jones polynomial is the product of the polynomials for the\n    # right-handed and left-handed trefoils. The polynomial for the\n    # left-handed trefoil is obtained by substituting t with 1/t.\n    V_neg_3_1 = V_3_1.subs(t, 1/t)\n\n    # Calculate the product of the two polynomials\n    V_square_knot = sympy.expand(V_3_1 * V_neg_3_1)\n\n    # Extract the terms of the resulting polynomial to sort and format them.\n    # A Poly object is useful for handling the terms.\n    # The domain ZZ[t, 1/t] is for Laurent polynomials with integer coefficients.\n    poly = sympy.Poly(V_square_knot, t, 1/t)\n    \n    # Get terms as a list of [((power_of_t, power_of_1/t), coefficient), ...]\n    terms = poly.terms()\n\n    # Sort terms by degree in descending order. The power is p_t - p_1/t.\n    sorted_terms = sorted(terms, key=lambda item: item[0][0] - item[0][1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Build the final string representation\n    result_string = \"\"\n    for i, term in enumerate(sorted_terms):\n        # The power is the difference between the power of t and the power of 1/t\n        power = term[0][0] - term[0][1]\n        coeff = term[1]\n\n        # Determine the sign to prepend (+, -, or nothing for the first term)\n        if i == 0:\n            sign = \"-\" if coeff < 0 else \"\"\n        else:\n            sign = \" - \" if coeff < 0 else \" + \"\n        \n        abs_coeff = abs(coeff)\n\n        # Format the coefficient part of the term\n        # Hide coefficient if it's 1, unless it's a constant term (power=0)\n        if abs_coeff == 1 and power != 0:\n            coeff_str = \"\"\n        else:\n            coeff_str = str(abs_coeff)\n\n        # Format the variable part of the term (t with its power)\n        if power == 0:\n            power_str = \"\" # Constant term\n        elif power == 1:\n            power_str = \"t\"\n        else:\n            power_str = f\"t^{power}\"\n            \n        result_string += f\"{sign}{coeff_str}{power_str}\"\n\n    print(result_string)\n\nget_knot_jones_polynomial()\n```\n<<<-t^3 + t^2 - t + 3 - t^-1 + t^-2 - t^-3>>>"
