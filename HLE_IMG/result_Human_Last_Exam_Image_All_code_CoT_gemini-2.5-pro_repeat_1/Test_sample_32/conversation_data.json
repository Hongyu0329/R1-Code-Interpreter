    "Based on my analysis of botanical information, the primary distinguishing feature between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* lies in the seta, which is the stalk that supports the spore capsule. I will use a Python script to print out a detailed explanation of this difference.\n\n```python\ndef distinguish_grimmia_species():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function prints the main difference between the sporophytes of\n  Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n  \"\"\"\n  \n  species_montana = \"Grimmia montana\"\n  species_curviseta = \"Grimmia curviseta\"\n  \n  seta_montana = \"a short, straight seta\"\n  capsule_montana = \"erect and typically immersed or emergent among the upper leaves\"\n  \n  seta_curviseta = \"a longer, distinctly curved (arcuate) seta\"\n  capsule_curviseta = \"nodding or bent to the side (cernuous)\"\n  \n  print(f\"The main difference in the sporophyte that helps distinguish {species_montana} and {species_curviseta} at a glance is the seta (the stalk holding the capsule):\\n\")\n  print(f\"1. {species_montana}: It has {seta_montana}, which holds the capsule in an {capsule_montana}.\")\n  print(f\"2. {species_curviseta}: Its name, 'curviseta', literally means 'curved seta'.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
