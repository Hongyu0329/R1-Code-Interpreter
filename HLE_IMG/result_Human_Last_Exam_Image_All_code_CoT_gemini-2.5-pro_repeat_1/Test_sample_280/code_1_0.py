# The provided Piet image is a known program that performs a specific calculation.
# This script will replicate that calculation to produce the program's output.

# Define the numbers used in the calculation
num1 = 4
num2 = 2
num3 = 1

# Perform the multiplication and subtraction as done by the Piet program
final_result = num1 * num2 - num3

# Print the full equation and the final answer
print(f"{num1} * {num2} - {num3} = {final_result}")
