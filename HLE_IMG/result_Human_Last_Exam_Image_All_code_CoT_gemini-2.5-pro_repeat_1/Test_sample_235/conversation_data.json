    "To determine the metric pattern of the erasure poem, we need to analyze its structure, primarily by counting the syllables. The poem reads: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\".\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Break down the poem into its constituent words.\n2.  Count the number of syllables in each word.\n3.  Sum the syllables to find the total count for the entire line.\n4.  Compare this total syllable count against the definitions of the metric patterns provided in the answer choices to find the best match.\n\n*   **Free verse:** Has no regular meter or syllable count.\n*   **Iambic pentameter:** 10 syllables per line.\n*   **Alexandrine:** 12 syllables per line.\n*   **Sapphic:** Composed of lines with 11 syllables (hendecasyllabic lines).\n*   **Loose iambic trimeter:** Approximately 6 syllables per line.\n*   **American sentence:** A single sentence of 17 syllables.\n\nThe following Python code will perform the syllable count and analysis.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef count_syllables(word):\n    \"\"\"A simple syllable counter for English words.\"\"\"\n    word = word.lower()\n    # Handle some known cases for this specific poem\n    if word in [\"lines\", \"rules\"]:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Basic vowel-based counting heuristic\n    syllable_count = 0\n    vowels = \"aeiouy\"\n    if word[0] in vowels:\n        syllable_count += 1\n    for index in range(1, len(word)):\n        if word[index] in vowels and word[index - 1] not in vowels:\n            syllable_count += 1\n    if word.endswith(\"e\"):\n        syllable_count -= 1\n    if word.endswith(\"le\") and len(word) > 2 and word[-3] not in vowels:\n        syllable_count += 1\n    if syllable_count == 0:\n        syllable_count = 1\n        \n    # Manual override for accuracy\n    manual_counts = {\n        \"rules\": 1,\n        \"lines\": 1,\n        \"intricate\": 3,\n        \"spider's\": 2,\n    }\n    return manual_counts.get(word, syllable_count)\n\n# The text of the erasure poem\npoem_text = \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n# Clean and split the text into words\nwords = re.findall(r'\\b\\w+\\'?\\w*\\b', poem_text)\n\n# Calculate syllables for each word\nsyllable_counts = [count_syllables(word) for word in words]\ntotal_syllables = sum(syllable_counts)\n\n# --- Output the analysis ---\nprint(\"Analyzing the poem: '{}'\".format(\" \".join(words)))\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Print the equation\nequation_parts = []\nfor word, count in zip(words, syllable_counts):\n    print(\"{:<12} -> {} syllable(s)\".format(word, count))\n    equation_parts.append(str(count))\n\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nfinal_equation = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\nprint(\"Syllable Calculation:\")\nprint(f\"{final_equation} = {total_syllables}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Compare with metric patterns\nprint(\"Comparing with metric pattern definitions:\")\nprint(f\"Iambic Pentameter: 10 syllables.
