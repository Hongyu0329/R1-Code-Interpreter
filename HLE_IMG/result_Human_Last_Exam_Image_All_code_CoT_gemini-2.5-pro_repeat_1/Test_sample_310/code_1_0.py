# Parameters for the missing simulation
# N is the initial degree of polymerization.
# m is the parameter for the degree of destruction.
N = 20
m = 5

# Calculate the degree of destruction, a.
a = m / 25

# For a linear polymer, the number-average degree of polymerization (Nn)
# is calculated using the formula: Nn = N / (1 + a * (N - 1))
N_minus_1 = N - 1
denominator = 1 + a * N_minus_1
Nn = N / denominator

# Print the equation with all the numerical values for clarity
