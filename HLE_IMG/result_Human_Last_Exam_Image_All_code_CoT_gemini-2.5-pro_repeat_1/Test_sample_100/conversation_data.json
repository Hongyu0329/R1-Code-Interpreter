    "To determine the molecular formula of the product, we will follow the reaction scheme step by step, calculating the change in atomic composition at each stage.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** First, we need to find the molecular formula of the starting material. The structure is a bicyclic lactam with a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group on the nitrogen and a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group on the double bond.\n    *   The core skeleton, 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one, has the formula C6H7NO.\n    *   A trifluoromethyl (CF3) group replaces a hydrogen atom. This changes the formula by +C, -H, +3F.\n    *   A p-methoxybenzyl (PMB, -CH2-C6H4-OCH3) group replaces the hydrogen on the nitrogen. The PMB group has the formula C8H9O. This changes the formula by +C8, +H9, +O, and -H.\n    *   Starting from C6H7NO:\n        *   Add CF3 group (replaces H): C becomes 6+1=7, H becomes 7-1=6. Formula: C7H6F3NO.\n        *   Add PMB group (replaces H on N): C becomes 7+8=15, H becomes 6-1+9=14, O becomes 1+1=2. Formula: C15H14F3NO2.\n\n2.  **Intermediate 1:** The first reaction uses Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN), which is a standard reagent for removing the PMB protecting group. The PMB group (C8H9O) is cleaved off, and a hydrogen atom is added back to the nitrogen.\n    *   Change: -C8, -H9, -O1, +H1.\n    *   Net change: -C8, -H8, -O1.\n    *   Formula of Intermediate 1: C(15-8) H(14-8) F3 N O(2-1) = C7H6F3NO.\n\n3.  **Intermediate 2:** The second reaction is a catalytic hydrogenation (Pd/C, H2), which reduces the carbon-carbon double bond to a single bond. This process adds two hydrogen atoms to the molecule.\n    *   Change: +H2.\n    *   Formula of Intermediate 2: C7 H(6+2) F3NO = C7H8F3NO.\n\n4.  **Product:** The final step is the hydrolysis of the lactam (a cyclic amide) using strong acid (HCl) and heat. This reaction opens the ring by adding one molecule of water (H2O).\n    *   Change: +H2, +O1.\n    *   Formula of the Product: C7 H(8+2) F3 N O(1+1) = C7H10F3NO2.\n\nThe following Python code performs these calculations to confirm the final molecular formula.\n\n```python\ndef solve_molecular_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product from the given reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the molecular formula of the starting material.\n    # Base structure (2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one): C6H7NO\n    # Add CF3 group (replaces one H): +C, -H, +3F -> C7H6F3NO\n    # Add PMB group (C8H9O) (replaces one H on N): +C8, +H9, +O, -H -> C15H14F3NO2\n    atoms = {'C': 15, 'H': 14, 'F': 3, 'N': 1, 'O': 2}\n    print(\"Starting Material Formula: C15H14F3NO2\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Reaction 1 -> Intermediate 1 (PMB deprotection)\n    # Remove PMB group (C8H9O) and add one H.\n    # Net change: -C8, -H8, -O1\n    atoms['C'] -= 8\n    atoms['H'] -= 8\n    atoms['O'] -= 1\n    # Intermediate 1: C7H6F3NO\n    \n    # Step 3: Reaction 2 -> Intermediate 2 (Hydrogenation)\n    # Add two H atoms to reduce the C=C bond.\n    atoms['H'] += 2\n    # Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO\n\n    # Step 4: Reaction 3 -> Product (Lactam Hydrolysis)\n    # Add one molecule of water (H2O).\n    atoms['H'] += 2\n    atoms['O'] += 1\n    # Product: C7H10F3NO2\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final product's molecular formula is calculated as follows:\")\n    # Using Hill system order (C, H, then alphabetical)\n    print(f\"Number of Carbon atoms: {atoms['C']}\")\n    print(f\"Number of Hydrogen atoms: {atoms['H']}\")\n    print(f\"Number of Fluorine atoms: {atoms['F']}\")\n    print(f\"Number of Nitrogen atoms: {atoms['N']}\")\n    print(f\"Number of Oxygen atoms: {atoms['O']}\")\n\n    final_formula = f\"C{atoms['C']}H{atoms['H']}F{atoms['F']}N{atoms['N']}O{atoms['O']}\"\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Molecular Formula: {final_formula}\")\n\nsolve_molecular_formula()\n```\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
