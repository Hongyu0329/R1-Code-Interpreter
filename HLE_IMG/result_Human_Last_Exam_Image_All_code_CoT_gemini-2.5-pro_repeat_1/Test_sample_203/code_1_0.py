    # Step 1: Analyze the polygon.
    # The figure shows three identical polygons. Each polygon is a non-convex dodecagon
    # constructed on an equilateral triangle grid.

    # Step 2: Check for central symmetry and tiling property.
    # By visual inspection, the polygon is centrally symmetric. This means if you rotate it
    # 180 degrees about its center, it remains unchanged. The "notches" on opposite sides
    # match, and the "teeth" on opposite sides also match.
    # A well-known theorem in geometry states that any centrally symmetric polygon
    # can tile the plane. This specific shape, an octiamond, is known to tile the plane
    # using copies of itself in its original orientation and rotated by 180 degrees.

    # Step 3: Determine the Heesch Number.
    # The Heesch number of a shape is the maximum number of layers of congruent copies
    # that can surround it. For any shape that can tile the plane, we can continue adding
    # layers infinitely. By definition, the Heesch number of a plane-tiling shape is infinity.

    # Step 4: Formulate the final answer.
    # Since the polygon tiles the plane, its Heesch number is infinity.
    # The image contains three identical copies of this polygon.
    # Therefore, the Heesch number for each polygon is infinity.
    
    # We represent infinity with the string "infinity" for clarity.
    heesch_number_1 = "infinity"
    heesch_number_2 = "infinity"
    heesch_number_3 = "infinity"

    # The problem asks for the answers in order, separated by commas.
    print(f"{heesch_number_1}, {heesch_number_2}, {heesch_number_3}")
