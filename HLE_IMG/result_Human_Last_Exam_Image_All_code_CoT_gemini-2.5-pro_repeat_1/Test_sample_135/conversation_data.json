    "This artwork is a detail from a larger altarpiece. The specific style, use of glazed terracotta, and the subject matter are characteristic of a famous Florentine Renaissance workshop. By identifying the specific altarpiece, we can determine its creator. The text \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\" (a variation of \"Sacrament of the Altar\") is a key clue.\n\nThis roundel is part of the \"Tabernacle of the Holy Sacrament\" located in the Cathedral of San Miniato al Tedesco. Art historical records attribute this masterpiece to the renowned sculptor Luca della Robbia.\n\nHere is a Python script that provides the author's name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the artist who created the\n    altarpiece detail shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The artwork is a detail from the \"Tabernacle of the Holy Sacrament\"\n    # in San Miniato al Tedesco.\n    author = \"Luca della Robbia\"\n    \n    # Print the final answer\n    print(f\"The author of this detail of the Altarpiece is: {author}\")\n\nsolve_task()\n```\n<<<Luca della Robbia>>>"
