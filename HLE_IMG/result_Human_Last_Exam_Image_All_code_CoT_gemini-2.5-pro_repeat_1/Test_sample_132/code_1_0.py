# Step 1 & 2: Define the path and calculate missing probabilities
# The conversation path is START -> Appreciation -> Solution -> END.
# Let's find the probabilities for this path.

# P(START -> Appreciation) is given in the diagram.
p_start_to_appreciation = 0.32

# P(Appreciation -> Solution) is missing.
# The sum of outgoing probabilities from 'Appreciation' must be 100%.
# We have P(Appreciation -> END) = 83% = 0.83.
# So, P(Appreciation -> Solution) = 100% - 83% = 17%.
p_appreciation_to_solution = 1.0 - 0.83

# P(Solution -> END) is given as 100% because it's the only outgoing transition.
p_solution_to_end = 1.0

# Step 3: Calculate the total probability of the path
total_probability = p_start_to_appreciation * p_appreciation_to_solution * p_solution_to_end

# Step 4: Display the results
print("The path of the conversation is determined as START -> Appreciation -> Solution -> END.")

print(f"1. START -> Appreciation: {p_start_to_appreciation:.2f}")
print(f"2. Appreciation -> Solution: 1.0 - 0.83 = {p_appreciation_to_solution:.2f}")
