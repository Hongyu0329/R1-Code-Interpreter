    # Structure of Product C
    # Formed by N-acetylation of the starting material.

    # Structure of Product A
    # Formed via a m√ºnchnone cycloaddition, followed by decarboxylation and hydrolysis of the imine.
    # Formula: C14H20N2O3.

    # Structure of Product B
    # Formed via Michael addition, intramolecular cyclization/lactamization, and dehydrogenation.
    # Formula: C12H14N2O3.
    # NMR shows a cis-vinyl group, no methyl ester, and no acetyl group, consistent with the proposed pathway.
