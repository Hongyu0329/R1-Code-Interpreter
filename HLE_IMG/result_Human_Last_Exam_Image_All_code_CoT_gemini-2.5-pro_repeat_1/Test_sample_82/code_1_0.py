    # The intramolecular Heck reaction involves three main steps:
    # 1. Oxidative addition of Pd(0) to the C9-Br bond.
    # 2. Migratory insertion: The C4=C5 double bond adds to the Pd complex.
    #    A new C9-C5 bond is formed, and the Pd atom moves to C4.
    # 3. Beta-hydride elimination: A hydrogen from a carbon adjacent to C4 is removed.
    #    The adjacent carbons are C3 and C5. Elimination from C5 is non-productive.
    #    Therefore, a hydrogen from C3 is eliminated, forming a new double bond.
