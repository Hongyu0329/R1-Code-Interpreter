The transformation involves two sequential pericyclic reactions. The first is a 4π-electron **electrocyclic ring opening** of the cyclobutene ring to form a cyclodeca-1,3,5,7,9-pentaene intermediate. This is followed by a 6π-electron **electrocyclic ring closing** of a hexatriene portion of the intermediate to give the final product.
