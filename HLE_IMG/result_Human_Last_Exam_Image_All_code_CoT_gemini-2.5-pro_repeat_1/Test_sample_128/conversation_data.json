    "This reaction is a three-component condensation known as the Davis-Beirut reaction. It involves an ortho-dialdehyde (o-phthalaldehyde), a primary amine (2-aminopyridine), and a cyanide source (TMSCN). The reaction proceeds through several steps to form a stable heterocyclic product.\n\n**Step-by-step mechanism:**\n\n1.  **Imine Formation:** The primary amino group of 2-aminopyridine reacts with one of the aldehyde groups of o-phthalaldehyde to form an imine intermediate.\n2.  **Strecker-type Addition:** The cyanide ion (CN-), generated from TMSCN with the help of the KF catalyst, attacks the electrophilic carbon of the imine. This forms an α-amino nitrile intermediate: `2-((cyano)(pyridin-2-ylamino)methyl)benzaldehyde`.\n3.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The remaining amino group's nitrogen atom attacks the second aldehyde group in an intramolecular fashion. This creates a five-membered ring, forming a cyclic hemiaminal: `3-cyano-2-(pyridin-2-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindol-1-ol`.\n4.  **Dehydration:** This hemiaminal intermediate readily loses a molecule of water. The initial product formed is a non-aromatic `3-cyano-2-(pyridin-2-yl)isoindolenine`.\n5.  **Tautomerization/Rearrangement:** The isoindolenine, which is not fully aromatic, undergoes a cyanide-catalyzed rearrangement. This process moves the cyano group from position 3 to position 1, resulting in the formation of a thermodynamically stable, fully aromatic `2H-isoindole` system.\n\nThe final product, **Compound A**, is **2-(pyridin-2-yl)-2H-isoindole-1-carbonitrile**.\n\nThe overall balanced chemical equation is:\nC₅H₆N₂ (2-aminopyridine) + C₈H₆O₂ (o-phthalaldehyde) + HCN (from TMSCN) → C₁₄H₉N₃ (Compound A) + 2 H₂O\n\nThe following Python code uses the RDKit library to represent the molecules involved, calculate their properties, and confirm the identity of Compound A.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\n    from rdkit.Chem import Descriptors, AllChem\n    from rdkit.Chem.rdMolDescriptors import CalcMolFormula\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"RDKit is not installed.
