    print("Step 2: Analyze each histogram.")
    print("  - Histogram A: The red curve shows a population that overlaps with the black unstained curve. This means many cells were not stained. Therefore, Antibody A did not stain all cells.")
    print("  - Histogram B: The red curve is completely shifted to the right of the black curve. This means all cells in the population were stained and became more fluorescent. Therefore, Antibody B stained all cells.")
    print("  - Histogram C: The red curve has a 'shoulder' on the left that overlaps with the black unstained curve. This means a subpopulation of cells was not stained. Therefore, Antibody C did not stain all cells.\n")

    print("Step 3: Conclude the findings.")
    print("Only antibody B resulted in a complete shift of the cell population to a higher fluorescence, indicating that all cells were stained.")
