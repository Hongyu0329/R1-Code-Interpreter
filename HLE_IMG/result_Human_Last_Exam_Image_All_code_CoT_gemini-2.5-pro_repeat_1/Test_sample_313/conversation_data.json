    "This is a two-part riddle. Let's break it down.\n\n**Part 1: The Image and the First Clue**\n*   **Clue:** \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   **Image Analysis:** The image is from the 2019 NHL Awards. The player on the right is Nikita Kucherov of the Tampa Bay Lightning. On that night, he won three major individual awards (Hart Trophy, Ted Lindsay Award, Art Ross Trophy).\n*   **Connection:** In sports, achieving three significant feats is known as a **\"hat trick\"**. This gives us a strong keyword: \"hat\".\n\n**Part 2: The Second Clue**\n*   **Clue:** \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   **Historical Context:** Mercury salts (specifically mercuric nitrate) were historically used in a process called \"carroting\" to make felt from fur. This felt was then used to create hats.\n*   **Connection:** The process was highly toxic and caused neurological damage to the workers (hatters), leading to the term \"mad as a hatter\". The object made through this toxic process, which is no longer produced this way, is a **\"felt hat\"**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe \"hat\" from Nikita Kucherov's \"hat trick\" of awards is a pun connecting to the \"felt hat\" from the historical clue. The two-word phrase \"X Y\" that fits both parts of the riddle is \"Felt Hat\".\n\nThe following Python code will print the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle by combining clues from the image and the text.\n\n    Clue 1: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n    - The event is the 2019 NHL Awards.\n    - The player, Nikita Kucherov, won three major awards, a feat known as a \"hat trick\".\n    - This points to the word \"hat\".\n\n    Clue 2: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n    - Mercury salts were used to make felt for hats.\n    - This process was toxic, and the resulting object was a \"felt hat\".\n\n    Solution: The pun connects the \"hat\" from \"hat trick\" to the \"felt hat\" from the mercury clue.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = \"Felt\"\n    y = \"Hat\"\n    \n    # The final answer is the combination of the two words.\n    answer = f\"{x} {y}\"\n    \n    print(answer)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Felt Hat>>>"
