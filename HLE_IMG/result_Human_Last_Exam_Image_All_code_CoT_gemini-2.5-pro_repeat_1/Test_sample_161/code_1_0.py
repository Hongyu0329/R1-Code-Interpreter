    This function identifies the name of the missing reactant in the given chemical synthesis.
    
    The reaction is an imidazole synthesis from an alpha-bromo ketone.
    Starting Material (from step 1): 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one
    Product (from step 2): tert-butyl (2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazol-1-yl)carbamate
    
    By comparing the starting material and the product, we deduce that the reactant must
    provide an N1 atom with an NH-Boc group, a C2 atom with an NH2 group, and an N3 atom.
    This corresponds to a specific isomer of Boc-protected aminoguanidine.
