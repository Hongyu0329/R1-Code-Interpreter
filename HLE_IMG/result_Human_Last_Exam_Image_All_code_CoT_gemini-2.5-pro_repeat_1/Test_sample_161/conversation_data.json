    "This is a multi-step organic synthesis problem. To find the missing reactant, we need to analyze the transformation from the starting material to the product in the second step.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **First Reaction (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** Butylbenzene reacts with 2-bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of AlCl₃. This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation. The butyl group is an ortho-, para-director. Due to steric hindrance, the acylation occurs at the para position, yielding 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This is the first product shown and the starting material for the next step.\n\n2.  **Second Reaction (Imidazole Synthesis):** The α-bromo ketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, reacts with an unknown \"Reactant\" to form a complex imidazole derivative. This type of reaction is a variation of the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis.\n\n3.  **Product Analysis:** The final product is `tert-butyl (2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazol-1-yl)carbamate`. Let's break down its structure:\n    *   An imidazole ring is the core.\n    *   The `4-(4-butylphenyl)` group is at position C4. This, along with the C4 and C5 atoms of the ring, comes from the α-bromo ketone.\n    *   An amino group (`-NH₂`) is at position C2.\n    *   A `tert-butoxycarbonylamino` group (`-NH-Boc` or `-NH-C(=O)-O-tBu`) is at position N1.\n\n4.  **Deducing the Reactant:** To form the product, the unknown reactant must provide the atoms that are not coming from the α-bromo ketone. We need to add the `N1-C2-N3` fragment to the `C5-C4` fragment of the ketone.\n    *   The reactant must provide: N1 (with an `-NH-Boc` substituent), C2 (with an `-NH₂` substituent), and N3.\n    *   This points to a derivative of aminoguanidine (`H₂N-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`). The reaction of an α-haloketone with aminoguanidine is a known method for synthesizing 1,2-diaminoimidazoles.\n    *   In this case, the product has a `-NH-Boc` group attached to N1, which means we need a Boc-protected aminoguanidine. Specifically, the Boc group must be on the hydrazine part to end up attached to N1 of the imidazole ring.\n    *   The required reactant is `N'-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine`, which has the structure `(CH₃)₃C-O-C(=O)-NH-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n\n5.  **Reaction Mechanism:** The likely mechanism involves condensation between the ketone of the α-bromo ketone and one of the amino groups of the Boc-aminoguanidine, followed by intramolecular cyclization and dehydration to form the aromatic imidazole ring. This pathway correctly places all the substituents as seen in the final product.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the required reactant.\n\n```python\ndef find_reactant_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the name of the missing reactant in the given chemical synthesis.\n    \n    The reaction is an imidazole synthesis from an alpha-bromo ketone.\n    Starting Material (from step 1): 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one\n    Product (from step 2): tert-butyl (2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazol-1-yl)carbamate\n    \n    By comparing the starting material and the product, we deduce that the reactant must\n    provide an N1 atom with an NH-Boc group, a C2 atom with an NH2 group, and an N3 atom.\n    This corresponds to a specific isomer of Boc-protected aminoguanidine.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The common name for the reactant with the structure (CH3)3C-O-C(=O)-NH-NH-C(=NH)-NH2\n    reactant_name = \"N'-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine\"\n    \n    print(reactant_name)\n\nfind_reactant_name()\n```\n<<<N'-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine>>>"
