The reason for the high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is the large steric difference between the C2 and C4 termini of the bicyclic münchnone intermediate. In contrast to the nearly symmetrical münchnone in Reaction 2, the münchnone from N-acetyl-proline has a highly hindered bridgehead carbon at C4 and a much less hindered C2. This steric difference forces the cycloaddition to proceed through a single, sterically favored pathway, where the bulkier end of the alkyne adds to the less hindered C2 terminus, resulting in a single regioisomeric product. The non-selective outcome of Reaction 2 demonstrates that without this steric bias, the reaction has no intrinsic regiochemical preference.
