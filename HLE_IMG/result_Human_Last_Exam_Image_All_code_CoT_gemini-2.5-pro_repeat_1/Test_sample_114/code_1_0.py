print("\n### Rationale for Regioselectivity ###")
print("The key to understanding the regioselectivity lies in comparing the structures of the reactive intermediates, which are m端nchnones (mesoionic 1,3-dipoles), formed in each reaction.")
print("\n1. Lack of Selectivity in Reaction 2:")
print("   - The m端nchnone formed from N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine in Reactions 1 and 2 has methyl groups at both of its reactive termini (C2 and C4).")
print("   - The 13C labeling experiment in Reaction 2 confirms that these two ends are so sterically and electronically similar that the incoming alkyne adds to either end with equal probability.")
print("   - This lack of preference results in no regioselectivity and a 1:1 mixture of products.")

print("\n2. High Selectivity in Reaction 3:")
print("   - The m端nchnone formed from N-acetyl-proline in Reaction 3 is a bicyclic system. Its C2 terminus has a methyl group, but its C4 terminus is a highly substituted bridgehead carbon, part of the fused pyrrolidine ring.")
print("   - This makes the two reactive termini of the dipole dramatically different, especially in terms of steric hindrance. The C4 position is far more crowded than the C2 position.")

print("\n3. Conclusion:")
print("   - The high regioselectivity observed in Reaction 3 is a direct result of this large steric difference. The cycloaddition proceeds via the transition state that minimizes steric repulsion.")
print("   - Consequently, the bulkier end of the alkyne (the -COOCH3 group) selectively attacks the less-hindered C2 terminus of the m端nchnone, leading to the formation of Product B as a single regioisomer.")
print("   - The results from Reactions 1 and 2 are critical because they provide the control experiment, demonstrating that without this significant, built-in steric bias, the reaction is unselective.")
