    "Here is my plan to determine the Roman numeral for measure 30:\n\n1.  **Identify the Key:** The sonata is in C minor, which has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭).\n2.  **Locate Measure 30:** Find measure 30 on the provided sheet music. It is the third measure of the second line, and it is helpfully circled.\n3.  **Identify the Notes:** I will list all the notes played simultaneously in measure 30 across both the treble and bass clefs.\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The notes are F♯, A, C, and E♭.\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The note is D, played as an octave.\n4.  **Determine the Chord:** Combining all notes gives us D, F♯, A, C, E♭. Stacking these notes in thirds from the root D reveals a D dominant seventh chord with a minor ninth (D-F♯-A-C-E♭). This chord is commonly written as D7(♭9).\n5.  **Analyze the Harmonic Function:** A dominant chord's function is to resolve to its tonic. A D7 chord is the dominant (V7) of G. Looking at the next measure (m. 31), we see a G minor chord (G-B♭-D).\n6.  **Formulate the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   The D7(♭9) chord in measure 30 is acting as the dominant chord leading to the G minor chord in measure 31.\n    *   In our home key of C minor, G minor is the minor dominant chord, represented by the Roman numeral 'v'.\n    *   Therefore, the D7(♭9) chord is the \"dominant of the dominant,\" also known as a secondary dominant.\n    *   The Roman numeral for this is written as V7/v (read as \"five-seven of five\"). The D in the bass confirms it's in root position.\n\nI will now write a Python script to print this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_measure_30():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the harmony of measure 30 from Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata, Mvt. 1,\n    and provides the correct Roman numeral.\n    \"\"\"\n    piece = \"Beethoven's 'Pathetique' Sonata, Op. 13, 1st Movement\"\n    measure = 30\n    home_key = \"C minor\"\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing Measure {measure} of {piece}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"1.
