def solve_chess_puzzle():
  """
  This function provides the solution to the "mate in 2 for black" chess puzzle.

  The solution is the sequence of moves for Black, leaving out White's intermediate move.
  The winning sequence is:

  1. Nf2+: Black moves the knight to f2, delivering check. White's only legal response is to
     capture the knight with the pawn (gxf2), as capturing with the bishop (Bxf2) is an
     illegal move that would expose the king to a discovered check from the queen on b1.

  2. Rxf1#: After White's forced move, Black's rook captures the bishop on f1. This is checkmate.
     The White king cannot capture the rook because the f1 square is guarded by the Black queen on b1.
