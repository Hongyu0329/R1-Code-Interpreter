    "Based on my analysis of the runic inscription and carving style, I can identify the specific runestone.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants to know the ID of the Ingvar runestone shown in the image fragment.\n2.  **Examine the Image:** The image displays runes carved in a distinct, formal style known as Pr4 or Pr5, common in the Mälaren Valley of Sweden during the late Viking Age. The runes are arranged neatly within bands.\n3.  **Transliterate the Runes:** I will attempt to read the visible runes, starting from the top row, left to right.\n    *   **Top Row:** The runes appear to be `... ᚦ ᚢ ᚱ ᚢ ᚦ ᚱ ...` which transliterates to `... þuruþr ...`. This is the name Þrúðr (Thrud).\n    *   **Middle Row:** The runes appear to be `... ᛋ ᛏ ᛅ ᛁ ᚾ ...` which transliterates to `... stain ...`, the Old Norse word for \"stone\".\n    *   **Bottom Row:** The runes appear to be `... ᛋ ᚢ ᚾ ᛁ ...` which transliterates to `... suni ...`, meaning \"sons\".\n4.  **Connect to \"Ingvar Runestones\":** The user specifies this is an \"Ingvar runestone\". This is a known set of about 26 runestones commemorating those who died on Ingvar the Far-Travelled's expedition. They are cataloged with Rundata IDs.\n5.  **Identify the Stone:** By searching for Ingvar runestones featuring the name Þrúðr (`þuruþr`) and the words \"stone\" (`stain`) and \"sons\" (`suni`), the evidence points directly to the runestone with the Rundata ID **Sö 9**. The full inscription of Sö 9 begins: \"*Þrúðr raised this stone in memory of her three sons... They travelled with Ingvarr...*\". The fragment shown in the image perfectly matches the upper-left portion of the Sö 9 runestone.\n\nThe ID of the runestone is Sö 9. I will now generate a Python script to output this answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the ID of the Ingvar runestone.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The runestone is identified by its inscription and style.\n    # The visible runes include \"þuruþr\" (the name Þrúðr), \"stain\" (stone), and \"suni\" (sons).\n    # This inscription belongs to one of the Ingvar runestones located in Södermanland, Sweden.\n    # The specific Rundata catalog ID for this stone is Sö 9.\n    \n    country_code = \"Sö\"  # Sö for Södermanland\n    stone_number = 9\n    \n    # The final ID is a combination of the code and the number.\n    runestone_id = f\"{country_code} {stone_number}\"\n    \n    print(f\"The ID of the Ingvar runestone is: {runestone_id}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Sö 9>>>"
