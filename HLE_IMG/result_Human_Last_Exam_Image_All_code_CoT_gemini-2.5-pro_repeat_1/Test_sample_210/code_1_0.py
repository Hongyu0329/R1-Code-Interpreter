    This function identifies the correct image by comparing key features.

    Analysis of the target nyala reveals:
    1.  A specific horn curvature and twist.
    2.  A unique pattern of white spots on the flank, notably two prominent spots in a near-vertical alignment behind the shoulder.

    Comparison with the options:
    - A: Younger male, different horns.
    - B: Matches the target's horn shape and, most importantly, the distinctive spot pattern on the flank.
    - C: Female or juvenile, not a mature bull.
    - D: Different horn shape.
    - E: Has a white band on the front leg, which the target lacks.
    - F: Different horn shape.

    The conclusion is that image B shows the same nyala.
