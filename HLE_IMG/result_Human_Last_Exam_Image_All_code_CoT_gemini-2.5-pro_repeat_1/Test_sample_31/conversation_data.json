    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** The first step is to identify the knot shown in the diagram. By analyzing its 6 crossings and non-alternating nature, we can identify it as the **6₂ knot** in the standard Rolfsen knot table.\n2.  **Understand the Rasmussen Invariant:** The Rasmussen invariant, denoted as `s(K)`, is an integer associated with a knot K. It is a powerful tool in modern knot theory, derived from a sophisticated algebraic structure called Khovanov homology. Calculating it from first principles is highly complex and beyond the scope of a simple script. For well-known knots, the value is typically looked up from established databases of knot invariants.\n3.  **Find the Invariant:** For alternating knots, the Rasmussen invariant is equal to the knot signature, `s(K) = σ(K)`. However, the 6₂ knot is non-alternating, so this simple rule does not apply. We must rely on pre-computed values.\n4.  **Python Script:** I will write a Python script that simulates this lookup process. The script will contain a small dictionary acting as a database of Rasmussen invariants for several common knots, including 6₂. The script will then retrieve and display the value for the 6₂ knot.\n\nHere is the Python code to find the result.\n\n```python\ndef find_rasmussen_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the Rasmussen invariant for a given knot by looking it up\n    in a pre-computed database.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A small database of Rasmussen s-invariants for some common knots.\n    # The values are taken from standard knot theory tables (e.g., Knot Atlas).\n    knot_invariant_database = {\n        \"0_1\": 0,   # Unknot\n        \"3_1\": -2,  # Trefoil knot\n        \"4_1\": 0,   # Figure-eight knot\n        \"5_1\": -4,  # Cinquefoil knot\n        \"5_2\": -2,\n        \"6_1\": -2,  # Stevedore knot (alternating, s=sigma=-2)\n        \"6_2\": -2,  # The knot in the image (non-alternating)\n        \"6_3\": 0,\n    }\n\n    # The knot in the image has been identified as the 6_2 knot.\n    knot_id = \"6_2\"\n    \n    # Retrieve the invariant from the database.\n    rasmussen_invariant = knot_invariant_database.get(knot_id)\n\n    print(f\"The knot in the image is identified as the {knot_id} knot.\")\n    print(\"The Rasmussen invariant is a complex integer invariant often found in databases.\")\n    \n    if rasmussen_invariant is not None:\n        # The \"final equation\" is the statement of the invariant's value.\n        # We output each component of this statement.\n        knot_name_part_1 = int(knot_id.split('_')[0])\n        knot_name_part_2 = int(knot_id.split('_')[1])\n        value = rasmussen_invariant\n        \n        print(f\"The Rasmussen invariant s for knot {knot_name_part_1}_{knot_name_part_2} is {value}.\")\n        print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n        print(f\"s({knot_name_part_1}_{knot_name_part_2}) = {value}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Could not find the Rasmussen invariant for knot {knot_id}.\")\n\nfind_rasmussen_invariant()\n```\n<<<-2>>>"
