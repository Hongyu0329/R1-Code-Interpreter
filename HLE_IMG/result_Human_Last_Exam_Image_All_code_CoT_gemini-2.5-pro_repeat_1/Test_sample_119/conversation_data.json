    "My thinking process to determine the IUPAC name of the compound is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z 135. An odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms (Nitrogen Rule). I'll assume one nitrogen.\n    *   The base peak is at m/z 30, which often corresponds to the [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ fragment, suggesting a primary amine with a -CH₂-NH₂ group.\n    *   Other significant peaks are at m/z 91 (tropylium ion, C₇H₇⁺, from a benzyl group) and m/z 105.\n\n2.  **Analyze the IR Spectrum:**\n    *   Peaks above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate aromatic C-H stretches.\n    *   Peaks just below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate aliphatic C-H stretches.\n    *   Two peaks are visible in the 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ region, characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretches of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   Peaks at ~1600 and ~1450 cm⁻¹ suggest an aromatic ring.\n\n3.  **Analyze the $^{13}$C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra:**\n    *   There are 7 unique carbon signals: 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm.\n    *   The four signals from 126-146 ppm are in the aromatic region. Due to symmetry in a monosubstituted benzene ring, these four signals represent six carbons (1 ipso-C, 2 ortho-CH, 2 meta-CH, 1 para-CH).\n    *   DEPT-135 shows one negative signal (CH₂) and five positive signals (CH and CH₃).\n    *   The signal at 145.1 ppm is absent in DEPT-135, confirming it's a quaternary (ipso) carbon.\n    *   The signals at 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm are positive, corresponding to the three types of aromatic CH groups.\n    *   This leaves two positive signals and one negative signal for the aliphatic part.\n    *   Aliphatic signals: 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm.\n        *   19.2 ppm is a typical CH₃ shift (positive).\n        *   This leaves 49.6 and 43.5 ppm. One is a CH (positive) and one is a CH₂ (negative).\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   From the analysis so far, the molecule contains:\n        *   A monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅)\n        *   An aliphatic CH group\n        *   An aliphatic CH₂ group\n        *   An aliphatic CH₃ group\n        *   A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n    *   Total carbons = 6 (aromatic) + 1 (CH) + 1 (CH₂) + 1 (CH₃) = 9 carbons.\n    *   Total hydrogens = 5 (aromatic) + 1 (CH) + 2 (CH₂) + 3 (CH₃) + 2 (NH₂) = 13 hydrogens.\n    *   Total nitrogens = 1.\n    *   Molecular Formula: C₉H₁₃N.\n    *   Molecular Weight = (9 * 12.01) + (13 * 1.01) + (1 * 14.01) = 108.09 + 13.13 + 14.01 = 135.23. This matches the M+ peak at m/z 135.\n\n5.  **Analyze the ¹H NMR and HSQC Spectra to Determine Connectivity:**\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   ~7.3 ppm (multiplet, 5H): Protons of the C₆H₅- group.\n        *   ~2.8 ppm (multiplet, 2H): Aliphatic protons.\n        *   ~2.7 ppm (multiplet, 1H): Aliphatic proton.\n        *   ~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H): CH₃ group coupled to one proton (a CH group). This tells us we have a -CH-CH₃ fragment.\n        *   ~1.1 ppm (broad, ~2H): -NH₂ protons.\n    *   **HSQC (correlates ¹H with attached ¹³C):**\n        *   ¹H at 1.2 ppm (the CH₃) correlates with ¹³C at 19.2 ppm.\n        *   ¹H at 2.8 ppm (the 2H signal) correlates with ¹³C at 43.5 ppm. This must be the CH₂ group.\n        *   ¹H at 2.7 ppm (the 1H signal) correlates with ¹³C at 49.6 ppm. This must be the CH group.\n    *   **Putting it all together:** We have a C₆H₅- group and a -CH₂(43.5 ppm)-CH(49.6 ppm)-CH₃(19.2 ppm) fragment, with an -NH₂ group to place.\n    *   There are two main possibilities for the structure:\n        *   **Structure A (1-phenylpropan-2-amine):** C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃\n        *   **Structure B (2-phenylpropan-1-amine):** C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂\n    *   **Differentiating A and B using ¹³C shifts:**\n        *   In Structure A, the CH₂ is benzylic (next to C₆H₅) and the CH is attached to the electronegative NH₂. We expect the CH carbon to be more downfield (higher ppm) than the CH₂ carbon. (Experimental: C(CH)=49.6, C(CH₂)=43.5). This matches.\n        *   In Structure B, the CH is benzylic and the CH₂ is attached to the NH₂. We would expect the shifts to be closer, or possibly reversed.\n    *   Therefore, the combined NMR evidence strongly supports Structure A.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion and IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The structure is 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n    *   To name it via IUPAC rules:\n        *   The longest carbon chain is 3 carbons long: propane.\n        *   The amine group is on carbon 2: propan-2-amine.\n        *   A phenyl group is attached to carbon 1: 1-phenyl.\n        *   The full name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Redirect stdout to capture print output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\nprint(\"Analysis of Spectroscopic Data to Determine IUPAC Name\")\nprint(\"=\"*60)\n\n# 1.
