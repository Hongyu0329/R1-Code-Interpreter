        "A prognostic marker helps predict the likely course and outcome of a disease. The diagram illustrates "
        "that the binding of S100B to RAGE activates downstream signaling cascades (such as JNK/JUN and NFÎºB). "
        "These pathways culminate in definitive pathological outcomes including:\n"
        "- Apoptosis (programmed cell death)\n"
        "- Neuroinflammation\n"
        "- Neuronal loss\n"
        "- Neurodegeneration\n\n"
        "Since the concentration of S100B is directly linked to the activation of these destructive processes, "
        "its levels can predict the severity and rate of disease progression. Higher levels of S100B would "
        "indicate a more aggressive disease course and, therefore, a poorer prognosis. While it might also serve "
        "as an adjunct marker for diagnosis, its direct role in driving the disease mechanisms makes it a powerful "
        "prognostic tool."
