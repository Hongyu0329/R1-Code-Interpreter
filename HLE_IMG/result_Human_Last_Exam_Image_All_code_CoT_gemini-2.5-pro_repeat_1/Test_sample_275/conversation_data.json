    "To find the total number of splice species from the RT-PCR results, we need to carefully analyze each gel panel and identify the unique RNA molecules (splice variants) they represent. A new splice species is counted when a band or set of bands indicates a splice pattern not accounted for by previous panels.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Panel B (E1F1/E4R):** This experiment shows two bands (190 bp and 159 bp). This means there are two distinct splice variants amplified by this primer pair. These are our first two species.\n    *   *Species count: 2*\n\n2.  **Panel C (E1F1/E5R):** This also shows two bands (584 bp and 553 bp). Since the primers are similar to panel B (same forward primer, different reverse primer downstream), and the size difference between the bands is the same (31 bp), these bands represent the same two splice variants found in panel B. No new species are identified.\n    *   *New species: 0. Total count: 2*\n\n3.  **Panel D (E1F2/E5R):** This experiment uses a special forward primer (E1F2) that spans the `929^3465` splice junction. The single band (551 bp) represents a new species that must contain this specific splice, making it different from the species in panel B.\n    *   *New species: 1. Total count: 2 + 1 = 3*\n\n4.  **Panels E & F (E1F1/L2R & E1F2/L2R):** Panel F confirms the species from Panel D exists and extends to the L2 region. Panel E, using a general primer, likely detects this same dominant species. No new species are identified.\n    *   *New species: 0. Total count: 3*\n\n5.  **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** This uses another special primer (E1F3) that spans the `929^3506` splice junction. It reveals two distinct bands (1,003 bp and 931 bp). Both of these are new species, defined by the `929^3506` splice and differing from each other in a second splicing event.\n    *   *New species: 2. Total count: 3 + 2 = 5*\n\n6.  **Panels H & I (E1F1/L1R):** These panels detect \"late\" transcripts, which involve a major splice connecting the early region (where E1F1 binds) to the late region (where L1R binds). These are fundamentally different from all previously identified \"early\" transcripts. Panel H shows two species (450 bp and 419 bp). Panel I, being more sensitive, reveals those two plus two additional, less common late species (378 bp and 187 bp). In total, this primer pair identifies four new late species.\n    *   *New species: 4. Total count: 5 + 4 = 9*\n\nBy summing up the unique species from each informative experiment, we can find the total.\n\n```python\ndef count_splice_species():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the total number of unique splice species based on the provided RT-PCR data.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the RT-PCR results to identify unique splice species:\")\n\n    # Panel B identifies two initial early splice variants.\n    species_from_B = 2\n    print(f\"- Panel B (E1F1/E4R) reveals {species_from_B} distinct early splice species.\")\n\n    # Panel D uses a splice-junction-specific primer (E1F2), identifying a new species.\n    species_from_D = 1\n    print(f\"- Panel D (E1F2/E5R) reveals {species_from_D} new early splice species, defined by the 929^3465 splice junction.\")\n\n    # Panel G uses another splice-junction-specific primer (E1F3), identifying two more new species.\n    species_from_G = 2\n    print(f\"- Panel G (E1F3/L2R) reveals {species_from_G} new early splice species, defined by the 929^3506 splice junction.\")\n\n    # Panels H and I together identify all late splice variants.\n    species_from_HI = 4\n    print(f\"- Panels H and I (E1F1/L1R) together reveal {species_from_HI} distinct late splice species.\")\n    \n    # The total number of species is the sum of unique species found in each key experiment.\n    total_species = species_from_B + species_from_D + species_from_G + species_from_HI\n\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the total number of unique splice species:\")\n    # The final equation prints each number explicitly as requested\n    print(f\"Total Species = {species_from_B} (from B) + {species_from_D} (from D) + {species_from_G} (from G) + {species_from_HI} (from H/I)\")\n    print(f\"Total Species = {total_species}\")\n\ncount_splice_species()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
