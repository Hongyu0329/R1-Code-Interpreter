    "An emission spectrum is a unique fingerprint for each element. To identify the element, we can compare the pattern of spectral lines in the image to the known spectra of different elements.\n\n1.  **Analyze the provided spectrum:** The image displays a series of bright, colored vertical lines on a dark background. We can see distinct lines in the red, yellow-orange, green, cyan, and blue-violet parts of the spectrum. The pattern is quite complex, with numerous lines.\n\n2.  **Compare with known spectra:**\n    *   **Hydrogen:** The visible spectrum of Hydrogen (the Balmer series) is relatively simple, with four main lines: a red line (656 nm), a cyan line (486 nm), a blue-violet line (434 nm), and a violet line (410 nm). The spectrum in the image is much more complex and notably includes a very bright yellow-orange line, which is absent in Hydrogen's spectrum.\n    *   **Helium:** The visible spectrum of Helium is more complex and features several bright lines across the spectrum, including: a prominent red line (~668 nm), a bright yellow line (~588 nm), several green/cyan lines (~502 nm, ~492 nm), and several blue-violet lines (~471 nm, ~447 nm).\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The pattern in the image, especially the presence of numerous lines including a bright yellow one, closely matches the known emission spectrum for Helium.\n\nThe following Python code simulates this identification process by comparing the observed features with the known spectral data for Hydrogen and Helium.\n\n```python\ndef identify_element_from_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies an element by comparing its spectral features to known elements.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Known prominent visible spectral lines (wavelengths in nanometers)\n    hydrogen_balmer_lines = {\n        'red': 656.3,\n        'cyan': 486.1,\n        'blue-violet': 434.1,\n        'violet': 410.2\n    }\n    \n    helium_lines = {\n        'red': 667.8,\n        'yellow': 587.6,\n        'green': 501.6,\n        'cyan': 492.2,\n        'blue-violet': 447.1\n    }\n\n    # Step 1: Describe the features observed in the provided spectrum image.\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the observed spectrum from the image.\")\n    print(\"The spectrum shows multiple bright lines including:\")\n    print(\"- Prominent red lines\")\n    print(\"- A prominent yellow-orange line\")\n    print(\"- Multiple green and cyan lines\")\n    print(\"- Several blue-violet lines\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Compare with Hydrogen\n    print(\"Step 2: Comparing with the spectrum of Hydrogen.\")\n    print(f\"Hydrogen's visible (Balmer) spectrum has four main lines at approximately:\")\n    print(f\"Red: {hydrogen_balmer_lines['red']} nm\")\n    print(f\"Cyan: {hydrogen_balmer_lines['cyan']} nm\")\n    print(f\"Blue-Violet: {hydrogen_balmer_lines['blue-violet']} nm\")\n    print(f\"Violet: {hydrogen_balmer_lines['violet']} nm\")\n    print(\"\\nConclusion for Hydrogen: The observed spectrum is much more complex and contains a bright yellow line, which is absent in Hydrogen's visible spectrum. Therefore, the element is not Hydrogen.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Compare with Helium\n    print(\"Step 3: Comparing with the spectrum of Helium.\")\n    print(\"Helium's visible spectrum has several prominent lines, including:\")\n    print(f\"Red: {helium_lines['red']} nm\")\n    print(f\"Yellow: {helium_lines['yellow']} nm\")\n    print(f\"Green: {helium_lines['green']} nm\")\n    print(f\"Cyan: {helium_lines['cyan']} nm\")\n    print(f\"Blue-Violet: {helium_lines['blue-violet']} nm\")\n    print(\"\\nConclusion for Helium: The pattern of lines observed in the image, including the bright red, yellow, green, and blue-violet lines, is a characteristic fingerprint of Helium.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Final Conclusion\n    print(\"Final Conclusion: Based on the comparison, the element that produces these spectral lines is Helium.\")\n\nidentify_element_from_spectrum()\n```\n<<<Helium>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
