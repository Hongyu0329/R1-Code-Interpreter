    "My plan is to analyze the provided sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity. I will formulate a recurrence relation based on the algorithm's recursive structure and then solve it to find the Big-O complexity.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm:** The function `sort(a, n)` attempts to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`.\n    *   It recursively calls `sort(a, n - 1)` to sort the first `n - 1` elements.\n    *   It then compares the `n-1`th and `n-2`th elements.\n    *   If they are out of order (`a[n-1] < a[n-2]`), it swaps them.\n    *   Crucially, after a swap, the prefix `a[0...n-2]` may no longer be sorted. To fix this, the algorithm makes a *second* recursive call to `sort(a, n - 1)`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Worst Case:** The worst-case scenario is one that forces the maximum number of operations. This occurs when the `if` condition is always true, triggering the second recursive call at every step of the main recursion. This happens with a reverse-sorted array (e.g., `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`).\n\n3.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation:** Let `T(n)` be the time taken by `sort(a, n)` in the worst case.\n    *   The first call `sort(a, n - 1)` takes `T(n - 1)`.\n    *   The comparison and swap take constant time, which we denote as `O(1)` or `c`.\n    *   The second call `sort(a, n - 1)` also takes `T(n - 1)`.\n    *   Therefore, the recurrence relation is: `T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + c`, which simplifies to `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`.\n\n4.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:** We can solve this by expansion:\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    *   `= 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 3c`\n    *   `= 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 7c`\n    *   Following the pattern, we get: `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + (2^k - 1) * c`.\n    *   The base case is `T(1) = c_1` (a constant). We reach the base case when `n - k = 1`, so `k = n - 1`.\n    *   Substituting `k = n - 1`: `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-1) - 1) * c`.\n    *   `T(n) = c_1 * 2^(n-1) + c * 2^(n-1) - c = (c_1 + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The dominant term in the final equation is `2^(n-1)`. In Big-O notation, constant factors and lower-order terms are ignored, so the time complexity is `O(2^n)`.\n\nThe following Python script prints this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints a step-by-step analysis of the given sorting\n    algorithm's worst-case time complexity.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"### Algorithm Time Complexity Analysis ###\")\n\n    print(\"\\n1.
