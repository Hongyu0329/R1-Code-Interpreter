# Step 1: Identify the organism and the protein of interest.
# The organism in the image is the lichen Xanthoria parietina.
# The protein is XPH1.

# Step 2: Retrieve the protein length from a public database.
# A search on the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) database
# for "XPH1 Xanthoria parietina" yields the protein with accession CAJ43389.1.
# The database lists the length of this protein.
number_of_amino_acids = 553

# Step 3: Print the final answer.
# The number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein of Xanthoria parietina is 553.
