    "This image illustrates a well-known auditory illusion. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what's happening and how we can identify the phenomenon:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The image displays two related graphs. The top graph is a spectrogram, which shows the frequency content of a sound over time. The bottom graph is the corresponding waveform.\n2.  **Identify the Sound Events:**\n    *   **Part 1 (Left):** The spectrogram shows a single, stable horizontal line, and the waveform is a regular sine wave. This represents a pure, continuous tone at a single frequency.\n    *   **Part 2 (Middle):** A brief, vertical bar appears in the spectrogram, indicating a burst of sound across a wide range of frequencies. This is characteristic of noise, like a burst of static or a cough. The waveform shows a complex, non-periodic signal during this time.\n    *   **Part 3 (Right):** After the burst of noise, the original pure tone appears to continue, as shown by the reappearance of the single horizontal line and the sine wave.\n3.  **Interpret the Illusion:** The setup demonstrates a situation where a continuous tone is interrupted by a short burst of noise. To a listener, the tone would not sound like it stops and starts again. Instead, the brain perceptually \"fills in\" the gap, creating the illusion that the tone continued seamlessly *behind* the noise.\n4.  **Name the Phenomenon:** This perceptual \"filling-in\" of an obscured sound is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**. It is a fundamental example of how our brains organize sensory information to perceive a continuous and stable world, even with incomplete data. A related effect, when the missing sounds are parts of speech, is called the Phonemic Restoration Effect.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following Python code will print the name of the phenomenon.\n\n```python\ndef solve_illusion():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the auditory illusion depicted in the image.\n    \n    The image shows a continuous tone being interrupted by a burst of noise.\n    The human brain perceives the tone as continuing through the noise,\n    an effect known as the Auditory Continuity Illusion.\n    \"\"\"\n    phenomenon_name = \"Auditory Continuity Illusion\"\n    print(f\"The name of this phenomenon is: {phenomenon_name}\")\n\nsolve_illusion()\n```\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion>>>"
