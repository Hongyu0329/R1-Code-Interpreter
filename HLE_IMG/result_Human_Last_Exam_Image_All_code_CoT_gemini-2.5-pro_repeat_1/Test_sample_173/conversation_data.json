    "To determine the time signature of the musical measure, we need to count the total duration of the notes within it. The time signature indicates how many beats are in a measure and what type of note gets one beat. We can analyze either the top (treble clef) or bottom (bass clef) staff, as they must have the same total duration.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Bass Clef (Bottom Staff):** This staff is rhythmically simpler. It contains four notes. Each of these notes is a quarter note. A quarter note typically represents one beat in common time signatures. So, we have 4 beats in total.\n    *   Calculation: 4 (notes) * 1 (beat per quarter note) = 4 beats.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Treble Clef (Top Staff):** This staff contains a series of sixteenth notes. By counting them, we can see there are 16 sixteenth notes in the measure. Since four sixteenth notes are equivalent to one quarter note (one beat), we can calculate the total number of beats.\n    *   Calculation: 16 (sixteenth notes) / 4 (sixteenths per beat) = 4 beats.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Both staves contain notes that add up to a total of four quarter-note beats. A time signature where there are four beats per measure and the quarter note gets the beat is written as 4/4.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef find_time_signature():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the time signature by analyzing the note durations in the provided musical measure.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To find the time signature, we sum the rhythmic values of the notes in the measure.\")\n    print(\"Let's define a quarter note as 1 beat.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Analysis of the Bass Clef (Bottom Staff) ---\n    print(\"Analyzing the Bass Clef (bottom staff):\")\n    num_quarter_notes = 4\n    beats_per_quarter_note = 1\n    total_beats_bass = num_quarter_notes * beats_per_quarter_note\n    print(f\"The staff contains {num_quarter_notes} quarter notes.\")\n    print(f\"Equation: {num_quarter_notes} (notes) * {beats_per_quarter_note} (beat/note) = {total_beats_bass} beats.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Analysis of the Treble Clef (Top Staff) ---\n    print(\"Analyzing the Treble Clef (top staff):\")\n    num_sixteenth_notes = 16\n    beats_per_sixteenth_note = 1/4  # A sixteenth note is 1/4 of a beat\n    total_beats_treble = num_sixteenth_notes * beats_per_sixteenth_note\n    print(f\"The staff contains {num_sixteenth_notes} sixteenth notes.\")\n    # For clearer output, we show the division\n    print(f\"Since 4 sixteenth notes equal 1 beat, we calculate:\")\n    print(f\"Equation: {num_sixteenth_notes} (notes) / 4 (notes/beat) = {int(total_beats_treble)} beats.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Final Conclusion ---\n    print(f\"Both staves add up to {int(total_beats_bass)} beats.\")\n    print(\"This means the measure has 4 beats, and the quarter note gets the beat.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the time signature is 4/4.\")\n\nfind_time_signature()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
