    "I will analyze the image to determine what the main character is holding.\n\n1.  **Examine the main image and the cropped details:** The character, a woman, is holding objects in both hands.\n2.  **Focus on the right hand (viewer's left):** She is holding a small, possibly golden or yellowish object. It could be a small fruit or a piece of confection.\n3.  **Focus on the left hand (viewer's right):** This hand is supporting a much larger arrangement. This arrangement is overflowing with items.\n4.  **Identify the items in the large arrangement:**\n    *   A large, prominent red flower, resembling a rose or peony.\n    *   Other smaller flowers of various colors.\n    *   A piece of fruit that looks like a pomegranate or a large apple.\n    *   The items are held within what appears to be a woven basket or horn-shaped container, characteristic of a cornucopia (a horn of plenty).\n5.  **Evaluate the given options:**\n    *   A. red roses: This is incomplete. While there is a large red flower, there are also other flowers and fruit.\n    *   B. fruit and flowers: This is correct but less specific. She is holding both.\n    *   C. a cornucopia of fruit and flowers: This is the most accurate and descriptive answer. A cornucopia is a symbol of abundance, often depicted as a horn-shaped container overflowing with produce, which matches the visual evidence in the image. The sheer volume and overflowing nature of the fruit and flowers she holds fit this description perfectly.\n    *   D. a teardrop: There is a large, clear, teardrop-shaped object near the flowers, but she is not holding it directly. It seems to be part of the larger arrangement.\n    *   E. a moth under glass: The moth is on her face, not held in her hands.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most fitting description of what the character is holding is a cornucopia of fruit and flowers.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to identify the object held by the main character in the image.\n# The image shows a woman holding a large, overflowing arrangement of flowers and fruit.\n# This type of arrangement is known as a cornucopia.\n# Let's review the options provided.\n# A. red roses: Incomplete, as there are also fruit and other flowers.\n# B. fruit and flowers: Correct, but less specific than option C.\n# C. a cornucopia of fruit and flowers: This is the most accurate and descriptive term for the object.\n# D. a teardrop: A teardrop-shaped object is present but not the primary item being held.\n# E. a moth under glass: Incorrect, the moth is on her face.\n\n# The best answer is C.\n\n# This script will print the reasoning and the final answer.\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the image and chooses the best answer from the given options.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Observe the image.
