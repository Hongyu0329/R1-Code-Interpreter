    "This problem describes an acid-catalyzed dehydration and rearrangement of a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol. This is a classic example of a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, specifically a \"backbone rearrangement\" that proceeds through a cascade of 1,2-shifts of methyl groups and hydride ions.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Propose a mechanism:** The reaction starts with the protonation of the alcohol (-OH) group, which then leaves as a water molecule (H₂O), forming a carbocation.\n2.  **Trace the rearrangement:** This initial carbocation is unstable and undergoes a series of [1,2] shifts to form more stable tertiary carbocations. The positive charge effectively migrates across the carbon skeleton. We will trace the movement of each methyl group (CH₃) and hydrogen atom (H) involved in this cascade.\n    *   A methyl group migrates from carbon 4 (C-4) to C-3.\n    *   A hydride (H⁻) migrates from C-5 to C-4.\n    *   A methyl group migrates from C-10 to C-5.\n    *   A hydride migrates from C-9 to C-10.\n    *   A methyl group migrates from C-8 to C-9.\n    *   A methyl group migrates from C-14 to C-8.\n    *   A hydride migrates from C-13 to C-14, leaving a carbocation at C-13.\n3.  **Determine the final product:** The rearrangement cascade terminates with an elimination step. A proton is removed from an adjacent carbon (C-18) to form a stable, tetrasubstituted double bond, yielding the final product.\n4.  **Identify substituents:** By carefully tracking which group moves where, we can determine the final substituent (either H or CH₃) at each of the numbered positions (1 through 5) in the product structure.\n\n### Execution:\nBased on the mechanism:\n*   **Position 1 (at C-4):** Initially has two CH₃ groups. One CH₃ moves to C-3, and an H from C-5 moves to C-4. Thus, C-4 is left with one CH₃ group and one H atom. The label '1' points to the remaining CH₃ group.\n*   **Position 2 (at C-10):** The original CH₃ group at C-10 moves to C-5. An H atom from C-9 moves to C-10. So, position 2 is now an H.\n*   **Position 3 (at C-9):** The original H atom at C-9 moves to C-10. A CH₃ group from C-8 moves to C-9. So, position 3 is now a CH₃.\n*   **Position 4 (at C-8):** The original CH₃ group at C-8 moves to C-9. A CH₃ group from C-14 moves to C-8. So, position 4 is now a CH₃.\n*   **Position 5 (at C-14):** The original CH₃ group at C-14 moves to C-8. An H atom from C-13 moves to C-14. So, position 5 is now an H.\n\nThe following Python code will print the final determination.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rearrangement():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the substituents at the numbered positions after the\n    acid-catalyzed backbone rearrangement of the triterpenoid alcohol.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Based on the mechanism of the Wagner-Meerwein backbone rearrangement:\n    substituents = {\n        1: \"CH3\",  # The methyl group at C-4 that does not migrate.\n        2: \"H\",      # The hydrogen that migrates from C-9 to C-10.\n        3: \"CH3\",  # The methyl group that migrates from C-8 to C-9.\n        4: \"CH3\",  # The methyl group that migrates from C-14 to C-8.\n        5: \"H\"       # The hydrogen that migrates from C-13 to C-14.\n    }\n\n    # Format the output string as requested\n    result = \", \".join([f\"{pos} = {sub}\" for pos, sub in substituents.items()])\n    print(result)\n\nsolve_rearrangement()\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
