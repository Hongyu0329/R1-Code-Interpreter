    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find the highest order of rotation that leaves the entire pattern unchanged. Let's analyze the pattern to find its centers of rotation.\n\n1.  **Identify Potential Rotation Centers**: The pattern is constructed from various polygons: dark blue hexagons, light yellow squares, and rhombuses. The centers of these shapes, or the vertices where they meet, are potential centers of rotation.\n\n2.  **Test for Different Symmetries**:\n    *   **4-fold symmetry**: If we pick the center of one of the light yellow squares, we can see that rotating the pattern by 90 degrees (360/4) around this point maps the tiling back onto itself. Thus, the pattern has 4-fold rotational symmetry.\n    *   **6-fold symmetry**: Let's consider the center of one of the dark blue hexagons. A regular hexagon itself has 6-fold symmetry. If we rotate the entire tiling by 60 degrees (360/6) around the center of a hexagon, the hexagon maps to itself, and all surrounding shapes map onto identical shapes in the new position. The entire pattern remains unchanged.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: The tiling has multiple centers of rotation, including 4-fold and 6-fold centers. The rotational symmetry of a tiling is defined by the highest order of rotation present. Since we have found points of 6-fold rotational symmetry, this is the symmetry of the tiling.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_rotational_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the rotational symmetry of the tiling shown in the image.\n\n    The tiling is composed of hexagons, squares, and rhombuses. We look for the\n    point of highest rotational symmetry.\n\n    1. The center of each light yellow square is a center of 4-fold rotation.\n       A rotation of 360 / 4 = 90 degrees leaves the pattern unchanged.\n\n    2. The center of each dark blue hexagon is a center of 6-fold rotation.\n       A rotation of 360 / 6 = 60 degrees leaves the pattern unchanged.\n\n    The overall rotational symmetry of a pattern is determined by the highest\n    order of rotation found. In this case, it is 6.\n    \"\"\"\n    highest_order_of_symmetry = 6\n    angle_of_rotation = 360 / highest_order_of_symmetry\n\n    print(f\"The analysis shows the presence of different rotation centers.\")\n    print(f\"The highest order of rotation is found at the center of the dark blue hexagons.\")\n    print(f\"The tiling remains unchanged after a rotation of 360 / {highest_order_of_symmetry} = {int(angle_of_rotation)} degrees.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the rotational symmetry of the tiling is {highest_order_of_symmetry}.\")\n\nfind_rotational_symmetry()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
