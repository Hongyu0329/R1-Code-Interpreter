    "Yes, there is clear evidence of insect activity in the image. The most prominent sign is the white, fuzzy, spherical growth on the oak twig. This structure is a type of insect gall, specifically a wool sower gall (also known as a woolly oak gall).\n\nGalls are abnormal growths on plants caused by insects or other organisms. In this case, a female gall wasp (*Callirhytis seminator*) laid her eggs in the tissue of the oak twig. The plant reacts to the chemical signals from the eggs or newly hatched larvae by forming this complex, woolly structure. The gall provides both food and protection for the developing wasp larvae, which are housed in seed-like structures within the fuzzy mass.\n\nTherefore, the insect that created this gall laid its eggs **inside the twig** at the location where the gall has formed.\n\nI will now provide a python script that prints this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef insect_activity_explanation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the evidence of insect activity in the provided image.\n    \"\"\"\n    evidence = \"Yes, there is strong evidence of insect activity.\"\n    gall_identification = \"The prominent white, fuzzy ball on the twig is a wool sower gall (or woolly oak gall).\"\n    cause = \"This gall is created by a type of tiny insect called a gall wasp.\"\n    egg_location_explanation = \"The female wasp lays her eggs by injecting them directly into the plant tissue of the twig.\"\n    gall_function = \"The plant then grows the gall structure around the developing larvae, which provides them with both food and protection.\"\n    conclusion = \"Therefore, the insect that caused this gall laid its eggs inside the oak twig.\"\n\n    print(evidence)\n    print(gall_identification)\n    print(cause)\n    print(egg_location_explanation)\n    print(gall_function)\n    print(conclusion)\n\ninsect_activity_explanation()\n```\n<<<Yes, there is evidence of insect activity. The large white, fuzzy growth on the twig is a wool sower gall. This gall was formed after a female gall wasp laid her eggs inside the tissue of the twig. The gall then grows around the developing larvae, providing them with food and shelter.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
