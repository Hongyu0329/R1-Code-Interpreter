    This function analyzes the provided options and determines the most cost-effective solution.

    The problem is that the HMM is biased towards audio processing due to imbalanced training data.
    We need to find the most cost-effective way to improve accuracy for video processing recommendations.

    Let's evaluate the options:
    A. Add more training data for video processing: Effective, but collecting and labeling data is expensive.
    B. Use resampling: This technique adjusts the existing training data to balance the classes (audio vs. video). It's a low-cost computational step that directly addresses the imbalance.
    C. Train two separate models: This doubles the development, maintenance, and deployment costs, making it not cost-effective.
    D. Add specific states: This requires redesigning the model architecture, which is a significant engineering effort and cost.
    E. Use a model with a longer context window, such as LLM: This is extremely expensive in terms of computational resources and data requirements, making it the least cost-effective option.

    Comparing the options, resampling (B) offers a significant improvement for the lowest cost. It is a standard and highly cost-effective technique for handling imbalanced datasets.
