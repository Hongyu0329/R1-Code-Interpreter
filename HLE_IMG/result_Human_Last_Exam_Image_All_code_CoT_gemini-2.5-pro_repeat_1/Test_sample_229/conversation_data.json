    "This is a great question that requires identifying a piece of music from its sheet music. Based on the melody, chord progression, and overall feel, I can identify the song for you.\n\nHere is my analysis:\n1.  **Melody:** The opening melodic phrase (C-E-G-A) is very distinctive.\n2.  **Chord Progression:** The chord changes shown (C, E7, F, Dm7, G7, etc.) are characteristic of a specific jazz standard.\n3.  **Style:** The rhythm and feel suggested by the notation are indicative of a Bossa Nova.\n\nBy combining these clues, I've identified the song. The Python code below will print out the details.\n\n```python\ndef get_song_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the information about the song\n    identified from the provided sheet music.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Ceora\"\n    musical_style = \"Bossa Nova / Latin Jazz\"\n    country_of_origin = \"USA (composed by American jazz trumpeter Lee Morgan)\"\n\n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Musical Style: {musical_style}\")\n    print(f\"Country of Origin: {country_of_origin}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_song_info()\n```\n<<<Title: Ceora, Musical Style: Bossa Nova / Latin Jazz, Country of Origin: USA>>>"
