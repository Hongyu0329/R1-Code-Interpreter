    "My plan is to analyze the recurring patterns in the provided Google Trends graph. Each colored line represents search interest for a specific topic, and the sharp, repeated spikes suggest these are annual events. By matching the timing of these spikes to major national holidays or significant historical events of a single country, I can deduce the country in question.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Yellow Line:** This line shows massive, sharp peaks every year around late January or early February. This timing is characteristic of the **Lunar New Year**, also known as the Spring Festival or Chinese New Year, which is the most important holiday in China.\n2.  **Analyze the Blue Line:** This line shows a smaller but very consistent spike in early April each year. This perfectly aligns with the **Qingming Festival** (Tomb-Sweeping Day), a traditional Chinese festival for honoring ancestors, which falls on April 4th or 5th.\n3.  **Analyze the Red Line:** This line is more complex. It has a massive, unprecedented spike at the very beginning of the timeline, in late December 2019 and January 2020. This corresponds exactly to the initial outbreak and global recognition of **COVID-19**, a historic event that originated in Wuhan, China. The subsequent, smaller annual peaks could represent anniversary-related searches or news about later waves.\n\nSince all three significant events—the Chinese New Year, the Qingming Festival, and the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic—are directly and strongly associated with **China**, it is the only country that fits all the data points.\n\n```python\ndef solve_country_mystery():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided Google Trends graph to identify the country.\n    It does so by correlating the timing of the search interest spikes with known\n    annual holidays and major historical events.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the Google Trends graph to identify the country...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Analysis of each trend line\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the Yellow Trend Line.\")\n    print(\"This line shows its highest peaks every year around late January to early February.\")\n    print(\"This timing perfectly matches the celebration of the Lunar New Year (Chinese New Year).\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the Blue Trend Line.\")\n    print(\"This line shows a consistent, sharp spike in early April of each year.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to the Qingming Festival (Tomb-Sweeping Day), a major holiday in China around April 4th or 5th.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyzing the Red Trend Line.\")\n    print(\"This line shows a massive, dominant spike at the very beginning of the graph (late 2019 - early 2020).\")\n    print(\"This timeline is the exact point when the COVID-19 outbreak began in Wuhan and became a global news story.\")\n    print(\"This represents a major 'historic event' originating from the country.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Conclusion\n    print(\"Step 4: Synthesizing the Findings.\")\n    print(\"The three events identified are:\")\n    print(\"  - Event 1 (Yellow): Chinese New Year\")\n    print(\"  - Event 2 (Blue): Qingming Festival\")\n    print(\"  - Event 3 (Red): The initial COVID-19 Outbreak\")\n    print(\"\\nAll three of these events are intrinsically linked to one country.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    country = \"China\"\n    print(f\"Conclusion: The country is {country}.\")\n\nsolve_country_mystery()\n<<<China>>>\n```"
