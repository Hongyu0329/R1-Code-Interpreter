    "This task requires a visual analysis of the provided graph to identify synchronized neuronal bursts and then calculate the average time interval between them.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** I will examine the raster plot to find time points where a large number of electrodes fire simultaneously. These appear as dense vertical bands.\n2.  **Estimate Timestamps:** I will estimate the center timestamp for each identified burst from the x-axis (Time in seconds).\n3.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** I will compute the time difference between each consecutive pair of burst timestamps.\n4.  **Calculate Average IBI:** I will calculate the mean of the inter-burst intervals.\n5.  **Round the Result:** The final average will be rounded to two significant figures as requested.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** The code will formalize these steps, printing out the identified timestamps, the calculation of the intervals, the average calculation, and the final result.\n\nBased on the visual analysis of the graph, the major synchronized bursts occur at approximately:\n*   Burst 1: 3.5 s\n*   Burst 2: 17.5 s\n*   Burst 3: 35.5 s\n*   Burst 4: 49.5 s\n\nNow, I will use Python to calculate the average inter-burst interval.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_average_ibi():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies timestamps of synchronized bursts from a graph,\n    calculates the inter-burst intervals (IBIs), and computes the average IBI.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the timestamps of the synchronized bursts from the graph.\n    burst_timestamps = [3.5, 17.5, 35.5, 49.5]\n    print(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs).\n    intervals = []\n    print(\"Calculating Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):\")\n    for i in range(len(burst_timestamps) - 1):\n        interval = burst_timestamps[i+1] - burst_timestamps[i]\n        intervals.append(interval)\n        print(f\"  Interval {i+1}: {burst_timestamps[i+1]} s - {burst_timestamps[i]} s = {interval:.1f} s\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the average IBI.\n    average_interval = np.mean(intervals)\n    print(\"Calculating the average IBI:\")\n    # Create the sum part of the equation string\n    sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, [f\"{i:.1f}\" for i in intervals]))\n    print(f\"  Average = ({sum_str}) / {len(intervals)}\")\n    print(f\"  Average = {sum(intervals):.1f} / {len(intervals)} = {average_interval:.3f} s\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 4: Round the result to two significant figures.\n    # For a number like 15.333..., the first two significant figures are 1 and 5.\n    # The next digit (3) is less than 5, so we round down.\n    final_answer = 15\n    print(f\"The average inter-burst interval rounded to two significant figures is: {final_answer} s\")\n\n    return final_answer\n\n# Run the calculation and print the final result in the specified format.\ncalculate_average_ibi()\n```\n<<<15>>>"
