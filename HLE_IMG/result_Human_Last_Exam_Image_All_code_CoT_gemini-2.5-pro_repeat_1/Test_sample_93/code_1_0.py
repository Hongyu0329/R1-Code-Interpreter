    **Analysis of the Problem:**

    The goal is to render a fluorescein molecule non-fluorescent (caged) and then restore its fluorescence (uncage) specifically in cells expressing a particular enzyme.

    1.  **Fluorescence Mechanism of Fluorescein:** The fluorescence of fluorescein is critically dependent on the deprotonation of its two phenolic hydroxyl (-OH) groups. When these groups are modified (e.g., protonated or converted to esters/ethers), the extended pi-conjugation of the fluorophore is disrupted, and the molecule becomes non-fluorescent. Modifying the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group has a much less significant impact on fluorescence. Therefore, the most effective caging strategy must target the -OH groups.

    2.  **Evaluating the Caging Strategies:**
        *   **Targeting -OH groups (Options A, B, E):** This is the correct approach.
        *   **Targeting -COOH or C-H groups (Options C, D, F):** These are incorrect or ineffective strategies. Modifying the -COOH group doesn't quench fluorescence well. C-H functionalization is non-specific and difficult to reverse with an enzyme.

    3.  **Comparing Strategies Targeting the -OH Groups:**
        *   **Option B (Acetylation):** Converting the -OH groups to acetyl esters is a classic and highly effective method for caging fluorescein. The resulting molecule (like fluorescein diacetate) is non-fluorescent. Ester bonds can be readily cleaved by esterase enzymes. By genetically introducing a specific esterase into target cells, the fluorescein can be released (uncaged) only in those cells, providing excellent cell-type specificity. This is a chemically sound and practical approach.
        *   **Option A (Conversion to Amine):** This proposes a complex, multi-step chemical conversion of -OH to -NH2, which is not a simple "caging" modification. The proposed EDC-NHS chemistry is also incorrectly applied.
        *   **Option E (Cyclopropyl Modification):** While modifying the -OH groups with cyclopropyl moieties would cage the molecule, the enzymatic cleavage of the resulting ether bond is a less common and more complex uncaging strategy than simple ester hydrolysis.

    **Conclusion:**

    Option B provides the most chemically sound and widely accepted strategy. It correctly identifies the phenolic hydroxyl groups as the caging site and proposes using a common, reversible ester modification that can be specifically cleaved by a genetically targeted enzyme.
