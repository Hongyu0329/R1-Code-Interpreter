    "The image displays a sequence of three micrographs (L, M, N) showing a filamentous structure, which is characteristic of a fungal hypha. I will analyze the sequence to determine the biological process being depicted.\n\n*   **Panel L:** Shows a relatively straight hypha divided into cells by cross-walls called septa. An arrowhead points to one of these septa.\n*   **Panel M:** Shows the same region of the hypha at a later time. A noticeable swelling or bulge has started to form at the location of the septum indicated by the arrowhead.\n*   **Panel N:** Shows the structure at an even later time. The bulge has developed further, causing a distinct bend in the hypha. This represents the initiation of a new growth axis from a subapical cell (the cell below the tip cell).\n\nThis sequence of events—the formation of a bulge near a septum that develops into a new growth point—is the process of **hyphal branching**. This is a fundamental mechanism for fungi to grow and form a complex network (mycelium) to explore their environment for nutrients.\n\n```python\ndef identify_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the name of the biological process\n  shown in the series of micrographs L, M, and N.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The images depict a fungal filament, or hypha.\n  # The sequence L -> M -> N shows the formation of a new growth point from the side of the main filament.\n  # This process is known as hyphal branching.\n  process_name = \"Hyphal branching\"\n  print(f\"The process being depicted in the image is: {process_name}\")\n\nidentify_process()\n```\n<<<Hyphal branching>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
