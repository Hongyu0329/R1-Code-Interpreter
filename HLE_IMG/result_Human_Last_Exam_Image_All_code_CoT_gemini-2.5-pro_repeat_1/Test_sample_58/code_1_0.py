# The problem asks for the relationship between h, r, and theta.
# Based on the geometric derivation, the formula is h = 2 * r * tan(theta).
# The code below will print this formula as a string.
# The number '2' is explicitly part of the equation.

# Define the variables symbolically for the print statement
h = 'h'
r = 'r'
theta = 'theta'
number = 2

# Print the final equation
print(f"{h} = {number} * {r} * tan({theta})")
