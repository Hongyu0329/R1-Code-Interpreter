# Plan:
# 1. Analyze the structure of each complex relative to a baseline (Complex 1).
# 2. Identify molecular features that contribute to device stability in LECs.
# 3. Compare the complexes based on these features to establish a stability ranking.
# 4. Interpret the question and select the most appropriate answer from the choices.

print("Step 1: Analyze the molecular structures of the three complexes.")
print("Complex 1, [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+, is a standard benchmark Iridium(III) complex. It serves as our baseline for stability.")
print("Complex 2 modifies the ancillary (N^N) ligand to be a larger, bulkier, and more rigid system compared to the simple bipyridine (bpy) in Complex 1.")
print("Complex 3 incorporates two well-known stability-enhancing modifications:")
print("  a) The ancillary ligand is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dtbbpy), which adds significant steric bulk.")
print("  b) The cyclometalating ligands are 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (dfppy), which adds electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms.")
print("-" * 20)

print("Step 2: Relate structural features to device stability.")
print("In light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), stability is improved by:")
print(" - Steric Hindrance: Bulky groups (like tert-butyl in Complex 3 or the large ligand in Complex 2) prevent molecular aggregation, which quenches luminescence and degrades the device.")
print(" - Electrochemical Stability: Electron-withdrawing groups (like the fluorine atoms in Complex 3) make the complex more resistant to oxidative degradation, a key failure mechanism.")
print("-" * 20)

print("Step 3: Compare the complexes and establish a stability ranking.")
print(" - Complex 1 is the least stable as it lacks these specific modifications.")
print(" - Complex 2 is more stable than Complex 1 due to the increased steric bulk and rigidity of its ancillary ligand.")
print(" - Complex 3 is expected to be the most stable. It benefits from BOTH significant steric hindrance (dtbbpy) and enhanced electrochemical stability (fluorination). This dual-pronged design is superior to the single modification in Complex 2.")
print("Therefore, the expected stability order is: Complex 3 > Complex 2 > Complex 1.")
print("-" * 20)

print("Step 4: Interpret the question and select the best answer.")
print("The question asks 'which of the two is expected to result in more stable devices?'.")
print("This phrasing is ambiguous. However, since both Complex 2 and Complex 3 are specifically designed to be more stable than the benchmark Complex 1, it is most reasonable to conclude that LECs based on both of them would be more stable than those based on Complex 1.")
print("Thus, the best answer is that complexes 2 and 3 result in more stable devices.")
print("-" * 20)

# Final Answer
# The question asks to identify the more stable systems. Based on the analysis,
# both Complex 2 and Complex 3 are engineered for higher stability than Complex 1.
# Therefore, the answer choice that includes both is the most appropriate.
final_answer = 'F'
print(f"Final Answer is Choice {final_answer}: LECs based on complex 2 and 3 are more stable")
