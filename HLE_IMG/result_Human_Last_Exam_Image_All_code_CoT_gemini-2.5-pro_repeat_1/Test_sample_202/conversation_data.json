    "I will identify the four rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n\n*   **Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and highly vesicular (full of holes). This appearance is characteristic of **Scoria**, a type of volcanic rock formed from frothy lava that cooled quickly.\n*   **Specimen I:** This specimen is composed of various angular rock fragments cemented together in a finer-grained matrix. This type of rock is known as **Breccia**.\n*   **Specimen J:** This is a light-colored, highly porous and vesicular rock. Its frothy, lightweight appearance is typical of **Pumice**, another volcanic rock that is so porous it can often float on water.\n*   **Specimen K:** This rock displays large, interlocking crystals of different minerals (light and dark). The coarse-grained, crystalline texture indicates it cooled slowly deep underground. This is characteristic of a **Pegmatite**, which is an intrusive igneous rock known for its very large crystals.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to list these identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Breccia',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for label, rock_type in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {label}: {rock_type}\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
