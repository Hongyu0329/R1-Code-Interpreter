    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the ECG Parameters**: I will first identify the paper speed from the text on the ECG strip, which is `25 mm/sec`. This is essential for converting distance on the grid to time.\n2.  **Calculate Time per Square**: The standard ECG grid has small squares of 1 mm. I will calculate the time duration that one small horizontal square represents.\n    *   Time per mm (small square) = 1 second / 25 mm = 0.04 seconds.\n3.  **Identify the Longest R-R Interval**: I will visually scan the entire rhythm strip to locate the longest gap between two consecutive R-waves (the peaks of the QRS complexes). This longest pause is clearly visible on the fourth line of the tracing, starting after the third QRS complex.\n4.  **Measure the Interval in Squares**: I will count the number of small horizontal squares between the peaks of the two R-waves that define this longest interval.\n    *   Looking closely at the fourth strip, the R-wave before the long pause lands on a thick vertical line.\n    *   The next R-wave lands 9 full large squares (which is 9 * 5 = 45 small squares) plus 4 additional small squares after that.\n    *   So, the total count is 45 + 4 = 49 small squares.\n5.  **Calculate the Interval in Seconds**: Finally, I will multiply the number of small squares by the time per square to get the duration of the longest R-R interval in seconds.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_longest_rr_interval():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the longest R-R interval in seconds from an ECG strip.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
