    Solves the Simplicity puzzle based on a logical interpretation of the rules.

    The puzzle is modeled as a 2x2 grid of large blocks on the 4x4 grid,
    as this fits the "4 pieces" and "4x4 grid" constraints. The red piece 'R'
    starts at the bottom-right. The goal is to move it to the top-left.

    The 'pushing' move on a full grid is interpreted as a row or column cycle.
