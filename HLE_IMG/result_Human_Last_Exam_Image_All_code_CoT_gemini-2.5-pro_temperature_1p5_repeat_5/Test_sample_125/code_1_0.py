# Number of steps to synthesize benzaldehyde from 1,4-difluoro-2-methylbenzene.
# 1. Oxidation of methyl to carboxylic acid.
# 2. Conversion to acid chloride.
# 3. Reduction to aldehyde (Rosenmund).
# 4. Reductive defluorination of first F.
# 5. Reductive defluorination of second F.

# 1. Reduction of acetyl to ethyl (Wolff-Kishner).
# 2. Removal of ethyl group (Hydrodealkylation).
