    "To identify the name of the provided alkaloid compound, I will follow these steps:\n1.  Analyze the chemical structure shown in the image. It is a tetracyclic (four-ring) system containing two nitrogen atoms and one carbonyl (C=O) group.\n2.  Recognize this specific ring skeleton as a derivative of sparteine, a type of quinolizidine alkaloid.\n3.  The presence of the carbonyl group at position 2 of the sparteine skeleton makes it 2-oxosparteine.\n4.  The common name for this widely known natural product is Lupanine.\n5.  I will create a Python script that stores this name in a variable and then prints it to the console.\n\n```python\n# The chemical structure provided is a well-known quinolizidine alkaloid.\n# It is characterized by its tetracyclic framework which includes two nitrogen atoms,\n# and a carbonyl group at the C-2 position.\n# This compound is commonly known as Lupanine.\n\ndef identify_alkaloid():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the name of the alkaloid compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    compound_name = \"Lupanine\"\n    print(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    identify_alkaloid()\n```\n<<<Lupanine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
