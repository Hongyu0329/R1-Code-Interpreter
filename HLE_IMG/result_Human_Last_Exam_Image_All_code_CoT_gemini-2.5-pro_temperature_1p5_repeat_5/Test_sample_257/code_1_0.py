    This function analyzes the reaction and the structure of Compound 1 to determine

    The reaction is an electrophilic aromatic sulfonation. The product, Compound 1,
    is the disulfonated version of the starting material, with sulfonic acid
    groups (-SO3H) added at the positions ortho to the ether oxygen.

    The most deshielded proton is the single proton on the central aromatic ring.
