    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the given knot:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** The knot diagram provided is a standard representation of the knot known as **7₄** in the Rolfsen (or Alexander-Briggs) notation. It is a knot with 7 crossings. We can also observe that it is an **alternating knot**, meaning the crossings alternate between over and under as you trace along the strand.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Theorem:** For any non-trivial alternating knot K, a major theorem by Jacob Rasmussen relates its Rasmussen invariant, s(K), to its classical signature, σ(K). The formula is:\n    s(K) = -2 * σ(K)\n\n3.  **Find the Signature (σ):** The next step is to find the signature of the 7₄ knot. While this can be calculated from the diagram using methods like the Goeritz matrix, it is a well-known, tabulated value. For the 7₄ knot, the signature is:\n    σ(7₄) = -2\n\n4.  **Calculate the Rasmussen Invariant (s):** Now, we can substitute the signature value into the formula from step 2.\n\n    s(7₄) = -2 * σ(7₄)\n    s(7₄) = -2 * (-2)\n    s(7₄) = 4\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rasmussen_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Rasmussen invariant for the 7_4 knot.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the knot and its properties.\n    knot_name = \"7_4\"\n    is_alternating = True\n\n    # Step 2: Provide the known signature for the 7_4 knot.\n    # The signature (sigma) is a well-tabulated knot invariant.\n    signature = -2\n\n    print(f\"The knot in the image is identified as the {knot_name} knot, which is an alternating knot.\")\n    print(\"For an alternating knot K, the Rasmussen invariant, s(K), is related to the knot signature, sigma(K), by the formula:\")\n    print(\"s(K) = -2 * sigma(K)\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"The signature of the {knot_name} knot is a known value:\")\n    print(f\"sigma({knot_name}) = {signature}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the Rasmussen invariant using the formula.\n    rasmussen_invariant = -2 * signature\n\n    print(\"Plugging the signature into the formula, we get:\")\n    # Print out each number in the final equation as requested\n    print(f\"s({knot_name}) = -2 * ({signature})\")\n    print(f\"s({knot_name}) = {rasmussen_invariant}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_rasmussen_invariant()\n\n```\n<<<4>>>"
