    "The images depict the process of **branch formation** (also known as branching) in a filamentous organism, likely a fungal hypha or an algal filament.\n\nThe sequence of panels L, M, and N illustrates the steps of this process:\n\n1.  **Panel L:** We see a straight filament of cells. The arrowhead points to a specific site on the cell wall, near a septum (the division between two cells), which is the future point of branching.\n2.  **Panel M:** At the location indicated by the arrowhead, the cell wall begins to bulge outwards. This is the initiation of the new branch, caused by localized weakening of the cell wall and internal turgor pressure.\n3.  **Panel N:** The bulge has grown significantly, forming a distinct new branch that is starting to elongate. This outgrowth causes the main filament to bend.\n\nTherefore, the entire sequence shows the morphological development of a new branch from an existing filament.\n\n<<<Branch formation>>>"
