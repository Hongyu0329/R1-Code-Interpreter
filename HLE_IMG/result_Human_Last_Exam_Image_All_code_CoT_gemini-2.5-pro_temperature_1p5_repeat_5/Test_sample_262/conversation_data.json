    "Answering this question requires knowledge of organometallic chemistry, specifically the factors affecting the stability and operational lifetime of iridium(III) complexes used in organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) and light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs).\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n1.  **Analyze the Structures:** All four molecules are cationic iridium(III) complexes. They share a common structure: `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+`, where `Ir` is the central iridium ion, `C^N` represents a cyclometalating phenylpyridine-based ligand, and `N^N` is a 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine ligand. The key difference between the four complexes lies in the fluorine substitution pattern on the two `C^N` ligands.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Factor for Lifetime:** The operational lifetime of such emitter molecules in a device is primarily determined by their chemical stability under electrical stress. A major degradation pathway for fluorinated phenylpyridine-type iridium complexes involves the cleavage of the carbon-fluorine (C-F) bond.\n\n3.  **Relate Bond Position to Stability:** The stability of a C-F bond is highly dependent on its position relative to the carbon-iridium (C-Ir) bond formed during cyclometalation. Scientific literature has extensively shown that a fluorine atom located at the *ortho* position to the C-Ir bond is particularly destabilizing. This ortho-C-F bond is a known weak point, prone to cleavage during device operation, which leads to the degradation of the emitter molecule and a shorter device lifetime.\n\n4.  **Examine Each Complex:**\n    *   **Complex 1:** The fluorine atoms on the phenyl rings are at the *meta* and *para* positions relative to the C-Ir bond. There are no fluorine atoms in the vulnerable *ortho* position. This configuration is relatively stable.\n    *   **Complex 2:** This is a heteroleptic complex with one fluorinated ligand (same as in Complex 1) and one non-fluorinated phenylpyridine ligand. Neither ligand has a fluorine atom in the *ortho* position. This complex is also expected to be stable.\n    *   **Complex 3:** In this complex, the `C^N` ligands each have a fluorine atom located *ortho* to the C-Ir bond. This structural feature makes the complex susceptible to degradation. Therefore, a shorter lifetime is expected.\n    *   **Complex 4:** Similar to Complex 3, the `C^N` ligands in this complex possess a fluorine atom *ortho* to the C-Ir bond (in addition to other fluorines at more stable positions). The presence of this ortho-fluorine is sufficient to predict instability. Therefore, a shorter lifetime is expected for this complex as well.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the presence of the destabilizing ortho-fluorine substituent, Complexes [3] and [4] are expected to have shorter operational lifetimes compared to Complexes [1] and [2].\n\nThis logic can be encapsulated in a simple Python script.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_complex_stability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the stability of four iridium complexes based on their structure.\n\n    The stability of these emitters in LECs is largely determined by the\n    presence of fluorine atoms ortho to the C-Ir bond.
