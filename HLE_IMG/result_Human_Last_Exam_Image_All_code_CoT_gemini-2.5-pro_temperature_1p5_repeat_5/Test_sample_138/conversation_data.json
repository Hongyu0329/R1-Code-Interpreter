    "To determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair, we will examine key morphological features known to differ between males and females in these Hymenopteran groups.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):**\n    *   The insect on the left belongs to the genus *Coelioxys*. It has a distinctly conical and pointed abdomen. This specialized abdomen is used by the female to pierce the nest provisions of its host and lay an egg, making this individual a female.\n    *   The insect on the right belongs to the genus *Triepeolus*. Its abdomen tip also shows a structure (a bi-lobed pygidial plate) characteristic of a female. Male abdomens in this group have a different terminal structure.\n    *   Therefore, pair A consists of a Female and a Female (F, F). This corresponds to option **2**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Pair B (Paper Wasps):**\n    *   A key feature for sexing paper wasps (*Polistes*) is the antennae. The wasp on the left has straight antennae. The wasp on the right has antennae that are distinctly curled or hooked at the tips.\n    *   Hooked antennae are a definitive characteristic of males, while straight antennae are characteristic of females.\n    *   Therefore, pair B consists of a Female and a Male (F, M). This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Pair C (Long-horned Bees):**\n    *   This group is named for the very long antennae of the males.\n    *   The bee on the left has extremely long antennae, a pale-colored face plate (clypeus), and is clearly a male.\n    *   The bee on the right has much shorter, more conventional antennae, identifying it as a female.\n    *   Therefore, pair C consists of a Male and a Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Final Combination:**\n*   A: F, F -> 2\n*   B: F, M -> 4\n*   C: M, F -> 3\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of these indices.\n\n```python\n# Based on the morphological analysis of the insects in each pair:\n# Pair A: The left insect (Coelioxys) has a pointed abdomen (female). The right insect (Triepeolus) also has female-specific abdominal structures. This is F, F.\nindex_A = 2\n\n# Pair B: The left paper wasp has straight antennae (female). The right paper wasp has curled antennae tips (male). This is F, M.\nindex_B = 4\n\n# Pair C: The left long-horned bee has very long antennae (male). The right long-horned bee has short antennae (female). This is M, F.\nindex_C = 3\n\n# Print the final answer in the specified format.\nprint(f\"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}\")\n```\n<<<2, 4, 3>>>"
