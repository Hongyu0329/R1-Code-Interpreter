    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the atomic arrangement of a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal when viewed along the [110] crystallographic direction. We will do this by generating the coordinates of atoms in an FCC lattice and then projecting them onto a 2D plane perpendicular to the [110] direction. The resulting 2D pattern can then be compared with the given images A, B, C, and D.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the FCC Lattice**: Start with the basis atoms of a conventional FCC unit cell. The basis atoms are at `(0, 0, 0)`, `(0.5, 0.5, 0)`, `(0.5, 0, 0.5)`, and `(0, 0.5, 0.5)`, in units of the lattice constant `a`.\n2.  **Generate a Supercell**: Create a larger crystal structure by translating the basis atoms to form a supercell. This helps in visualizing the repeating pattern.\n3.  **Project the Atoms**: Project the 3D coordinates `(x, y, z)` of each atom onto a 2D plane. For a [110] view, the viewing direction is parallel to the vector `v = (1, 1, 0)`. A suitable 2D projection plane is defined by the axes `u1 = (1, -1, 0)` and `u2 = (0, 0, 1)`. The projected coordinates `(x', y')` for an atom at `(x, y, z)` are therefore proportional to `(x - y, z)`.\n4.  **Analyze the Pattern**: Analyze the set of 2D projected points to identify the repeating pattern.\n5.  **Compare with Images**: Match the identified pattern with one of the provided images. The pattern for an FCC lattice viewed along [110] is known to be a **centered rectangular lattice**. This means the atoms form rectangles with an additional atom at the center of each rectangle.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to determine the pattern.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_fcc_110_projection():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the 2D projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction\n    and describes the resulting pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

Generate atom positions in a 2x2x2 supercell to see the repeating pattern.\n    atoms_3d = []\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            for k in range(2):\n                for b in basis:\n                    atoms_3d.append([b[0] + i, b[1] + j, b[2] + k])\n\n    # 3.

Analyze the resulting 2D pattern.\n    # An FCC lattice is defined by the rule that for any atom (x,y,z), the sum of its\n    # coordinates (in units of a) x+y+z is an integer. Let's rephrase. The atom positions\n    # (2x, 2y, 2z) must all be integers, and their sum must be an even number.\n    # This property leads to a specific projection pattern.
