        "The diagram shows that the S100B protein has a strong affinity for the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products, which is labeled as RAGE. "
        "Specifically, S100B binds to the extracellular portion of the RAGE receptor, which consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains: V (variable), C1 (constant type 1), and C2 (constant type 2). The arrow from S100B points directly to this V-C1-C2 complex, with the V-domain being the primary binding site for many RAGE ligands, including S100B.\n"

        "S100B should be considered a prognostic marker rather than solely an adjunct marker. Here is the justification:\n"
        "- A prognostic marker predicts the likely course or outcome of a disease. The provided information explicitly links S100B to key pathological events that determine the severity and progression of neurological disorders.\n"
        "- The activation of RAGE by S100B initiates downstream signaling through pathways like JNK/JUN and NF-ÎºB.\n"
        "- These pathways culminate in critical pathological outcomes: Apoptosis (cell death), production of proinflammatory cytokines, and, most importantly, Neuroinflammation, Neuronal loss, and Neurodegeneration.\n"
        "- Since the level of S100B directly drives these processes, its measurement can provide a forecast of the disease's progression. Higher levels of S100B would suggest a more aggressive disease course and a worse prognosis. This predictive capacity is the hallmark of a prognostic marker."
