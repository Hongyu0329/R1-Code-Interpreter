    "Based on a visual analysis of the provided emission spectrum, the task is to identify the corresponding element. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Spectrum Pattern:** The image displays a series of distinct, bright vertical lines on a dark background, which is characteristic of an atomic emission spectrum. I will observe the colors and relative positions of the most prominent lines, from violet on the left to red on the right. The key features are several lines in the violet/blue region, a particularly bright line in the green region, a pair of lines in the yellow-orange region, and some lines in the red region.\n2.  **Compare with Known Spectra:** This specific pattern is a well-known \"fingerprint\" for a particular element. I will compare this observed pattern against the known emission spectra of common elements.\n3.  **Identify the Element:** The spectrum, especially the very intense green line combined with the other visible lines, is uniquely characteristic of the element Mercury (Hg).\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script to formally present this conclusion. The script will define a data structure containing the prominent visible spectral lines of Mercury (wavelength and color) and then print out this information to confirm the identification.\n\n```python\ndef identify_element_from_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies an element by its emission spectrum based on a known pattern.\n\n    The provided image shows the emission spectrum of Mercury (Hg).

    "You are a helpful AI assistant.
