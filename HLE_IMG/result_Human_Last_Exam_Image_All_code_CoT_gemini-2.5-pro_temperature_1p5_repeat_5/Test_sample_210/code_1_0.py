    This function identifies the correct image by comparing key features.
    
    1.  **Target Analysis**: The target nyala has a unique pattern of white spots on its lower flank, a specific stripe pattern, and a distinct horn shape with pale tips.
    2.  **Option A**: Lacks the specific flank spot pattern.
    3.  **Option B**: Has a similar spot pattern, making it a potential match.
    4.  **Option C**: Has incorrect stripe thickness and coat color.
    5.  **Option D**: Shows a perfect match for the flank spot pattern, the horn shape and curvature, and the facial markings.
    6.  **Option E**: Has a different, more scattered spot pattern.
    7.  **Option F**: Is partially obscured, making a reliable comparison difficult.
    8.  **Conclusion**: Image D provides the most comprehensive and exact match across multiple key features (spots, horns, face), confirming it is the same individual.
