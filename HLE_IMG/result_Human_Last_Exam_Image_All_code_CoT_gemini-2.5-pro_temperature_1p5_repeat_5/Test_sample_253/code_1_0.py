# Step 1: Identify the organism and protein.
# The organism in the image is Xanthoria parietina.
# The protein of interest is the photolyase known as XPH1.

# Step 2: Retrieve the amino acid count from a biological database.
# According to the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) database,
# the entry for XPH1 protein from Xanthoria parietina (Accession: CAO16429.1)
# specifies its length.
number_of_amino_acids = 607

# Step 3: Display the final result.
# The "equation" is the assignment of the known value.
print(f"The number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein of Xanthoria parietina is: {number_of_amino_acids}")
