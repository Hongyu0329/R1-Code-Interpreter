    "Here is a step-by-step plan to identify the rock specimens:\n\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and highly vesicular (contains many small holes). This texture is characteristic of scoria, an extrusive igneous rock formed from gas-rich lava.\n2.  **Analyze Specimen I:** This specimen consists of various angular rock fragments cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This type of rock is a breccia. Given the likely volcanic context (paired with scoria and pumice), it is likely a volcanic breccia or tuff.\n3.  **Analyze Specimen J:** This is a light-colored, highly vesicular rock. It appears very porous and lightweight. This is a classic example of pumice, a volcanic rock so porous it can often float.\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:** This rock is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible. This coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture indicates it's an intrusive igneous rock that cooled slowly. The presence of large crystals, potentially quartz and feldspar, suggests it is a pegmatite.\n5.  **Create a Python Script:** I will create a script that stores these identifications in a dictionary and then prints them out in a formatted way.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Volcanic Breccia / Tuff',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for label, rock_type in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {label}: {rock_type}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    identify_rocks()\n```\n<<<Specimen H: Scoria\nSpecimen I: Volcanic Breccia / Tuff\nSpecimen J: Pumice\nSpecimen K: Pegmatite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
