# The user wants me to select the best-supported statement from a list of options.
# My analysis concluded that several statements (G, K, P, T) are strongly supported by the provided text and images.
# For example:
# - Statement P provides a comprehensive and accurate summary: "The left element is most likely a paralog whereas the right element is most likely a ortholog of CG14879, because of the number of CDSs is more parsimonious between species for the right element. The elements are likely part of separate genes." This aligns with the parsimony argument and the RNA-Seq data.
# - Statement T provides a correct description of the gene structures: "1a and 1b are alternatives within a single element, and CDS 2 is in a different element." This is a correct interpretation of the visuals and the RNA-seq evidence.
# Since at least two statements (P and T) are factually correct based on the provided information, the option "More than one answer is correct" becomes the most fitting choice.

final_answer = 'L'
