    "The black organisms visible in the photo, particularly on the surface of the larger shelf fungus, are a type of **Slime Mold**.\n\nThese are not insects or part of the fungus they are growing on. Slime molds (Myxomycetes) are fascinating organisms that exist as single-celled amoebae for part of their life cycle. When conditions are right, they aggregate into a large, mobile mass (a plasmodium) which then forms stationary, stalked fruiting bodies, like the ones seen here. These structures, called sporangia, produce and release spores. The specific genus is difficult to determine without microscopic analysis, but common examples that look like this include *Stemonitis* or *Comatricha*.\n\nI will provide a simple python script to output the name.\n\n```python\ndef identify_organism():\n  \"\"\"\n  Identifies the black organism in the image.\n  \"\"\"\n  organism_name = \"Slime mold\"\n  print(f\"The black organism in the photo is a type of {organism_name}.\")\n\nidentify_organism()\n```\n<<<Slime mold>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant.

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
