    Step-by-step Analysis of LEC Stability:

    1.  Introduction to LEC Stability:
        The operational stability of Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs) is largely determined by the chemical robustness of the emitter molecule. The primary degradation mechanisms for Iridium(III) complexes in these devices are ligand dissociation (especially of the neutral N^N ligand) and electrochemical breakdown under operational stress.

    2.  Analysis of Each Complex:
        *   Complex 1 ([Ir(ppy)₂(bpy)]PF₆): This is the benchmark complex. Its stability is considered standard but is often insufficient for long-term device operation due to the potential for ligand dissociation.
        
        *   Complex 2: This complex features a large, electronically complex N^N ligand. While the size might offer some protection, such modifications do not have a well-established record of improving stability and can sometimes introduce new, unforeseen degradation pathways.

        *   Complex 3 ([Ir(dfppy)₂(dtbbpy)]PF₆): This complex incorporates two powerful and proven design strategies to enhance stability:
            a) Fluorination (dfppy ligand): The fluorine atoms on the phenyl rings are strongly electron-withdrawing. This strengthens the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond, which is critical for the complex's overall integrity. A stronger bond leads to greater thermal and oxidative stability.
            b) Steric Hindrance (dtbbpy ligand): The bulky tert-butyl groups on the bipyridine ligand act as a protective shield. This steric bulk provides a kinetic barrier that significantly slows down the rate of ligand dissociation, which is a major failure mode. It also protects the Iridium center from attack by external species.

    3.  Conclusion:
        Complex 3 is explicitly engineered to combat the main degradation pathways. By strengthening the core Ir-C bond and physically blocking ligand dissociation, it is structurally superior in terms of stability. Therefore, LECs based on Complex 3 are expected to be the most stable.
