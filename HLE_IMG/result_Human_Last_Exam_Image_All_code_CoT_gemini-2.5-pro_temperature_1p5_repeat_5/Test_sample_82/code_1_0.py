    This function analyzes the provided intramolecular Heck reaction and determines the location of the new double bond.

    The Heck reaction proceeds via three main steps:
    1. Oxidative Addition: Pd(0) inserts into the C9-Br bond.
    2. Carbopalladation: The newly formed C9-Pd bond adds across the C4=C5 alkene. The product shows a new bond between C9 and C5. This means the Palladium atom attaches to C4.
    3. Beta-Hydride Elimination: The Pd atom at C4 is eliminated along with a hydrogen from an adjacent (beta) carbon. The beta carbons are C3 and C5. C5 is now quaternary (no H's), so elimination must occur from C3. This forms a new double bond between C3 and C4.
