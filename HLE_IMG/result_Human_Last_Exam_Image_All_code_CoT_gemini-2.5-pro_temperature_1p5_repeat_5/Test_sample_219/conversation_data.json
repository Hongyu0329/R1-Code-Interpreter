    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** I will visually inspect the provided raster plot to locate the synchronized network bursts. These bursts appear as distinct vertical bands of high-density firing across many electrodes. I will estimate the center timestamp for each of these bursts.\n2.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** I will compute the time difference between each consecutive pair of identified burst timestamps. This will give me a list of inter-burst intervals.\n3.  **Calculate the Average IBI:** I will calculate the arithmetic mean of all the inter-burst intervals.\n4.  **Format the Output:** I will present the final average rounded to two significant figures, as requested. The python code will explicitly show the identified timestamps, the calculated intervals, and the final averaging calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_average_ibi():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies burst timestamps from the graph, calculates the inter-burst intervals (IBIs),\n    and computes the average IBI.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Visually identify the approximate center timestamp for each synchronized burst.\n    # The bursts are the dense vertical bands of activity.\n    burst_timestamps = [3.0, 16.5, 25.5, 36.0, 49.0]\n    print(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the time difference between consecutive bursts (inter-burst intervals).\n    # Using np.diff is a concise way to do this.\n    intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\n    # The np.diff function returns a numpy array, we can convert it to a list for printing if desired\n    intervals_list = list(intervals)\n    print(f\"Calculated inter-burst intervals (s): {intervals_list}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the average of the intervals.\n    average_interval = np.mean(intervals)\n\n    # Step 4: Display the full calculation equation and the result.\n    # We construct the string for the equation to show how the average was calculated.\n    sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, intervals_list))\n    num_intervals = len(intervals_list)\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Calculation Details ---\")\n    print(f\"Average = ({sum_str}) / {num_intervals}\")\n    print(f\"Average = {sum(intervals_list)} / {num_intervals}\")\n    print(f\"Result = {average_interval:.3f} s\")\n\n    # Format the final answer to two significant figures as requested.\n    # The 'g' format specifier is used for significant figures.\n    formatted_average = f\"{average_interval:.2g}\"\n    print(f\"\\nThe average inter-burst interval to two significant figures is {formatted_average} s.\")\n\n# Run the function to perform the calculation and print the results.\ncalculate_average_ibi()\n```\n<<<12>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts in this graph of firing activity of a neuronal culture and calculate the average inter-burst interval to two significant figures.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
