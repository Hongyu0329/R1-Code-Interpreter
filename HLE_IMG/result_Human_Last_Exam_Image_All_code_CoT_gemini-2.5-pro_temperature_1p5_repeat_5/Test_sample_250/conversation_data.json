    "This piece of sheet music is a jazz standard. I can identify it by analyzing its unique chord progression.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n1.  **Key and Form:** The key signature has four flats, and the first chord is F minor (F-), which strongly indicates the key is F minor. The structure with the repeat signs suggests a standard form like AABA or ABAC, common in jazz.\n2.  **A-Section Harmony:** The most revealing part is the chord progression in the first four measures: `| F- | E-7b5 | Eb6 | Dbmaj7 |`. This progression, when transposed, is the signature A-section of the bebop standard \"Hot House\".\n3.  **Transposition:** \"Hot House\" is usually played in C minor. Its A-section chords are `| C- | B-7b5 | Bb6 | Abmaj7 |`. If we transpose this progression down a perfect fourth to the key of F minor, we get `| F- | E-7b5 | Eb6 | Dbmaj7 |`, which is an exact match for the sheet music.\n4.  **B-Section (Bridge) and Melody:** The bridge on this lead sheet (`| D-7b5 | G7 | C7 | F7 |...`) and the written melody are different from the most famous recording of \"Hot House\" (by Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker). However, in jazz, it is very common to substitute alternate bridges and for different melodies (called contrafacts) to be written over famous chord progressions.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The A-section harmony is so unique and strongly associated with \"Hot House\" that it is the definitive identifier for the tune. The composer of \"Hot House\" is the pianist and arranger Tadd Dameron.\n\nTherefore, the title is \"Hot House\" and the composer is Tadd Dameron. Here is a Python script to present the answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_jazz_standard():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the title and composer of the jazz standard\n    based on the provided sheet music.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Hot House\"\n    composer = \"Tadd Dameron\"\n    \n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nidentify_jazz_standard()\n```\n<<<Title: Hot House, Composer: Tadd Dameron>>>"
