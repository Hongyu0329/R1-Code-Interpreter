    "This task requires a two-step approach. First, I need to identify the plant shown in the image. Second, I need to determine the specific island to which this plant is endemic.\n\n**Step 1: Plant Identification**\nThe image displays a shrub with dark green, leathery leaves. The most striking feature is the prominent, pale green or whitish reticulated (net-like) venation on the leaves. This unique pattern is characteristic of a specific variety of Pittosporum. Through a search based on these features, the plant is identified as *Pittosporum illicioides* var. *reticulatum*, also known as *Pittosporum daphniphylloides* var. *reticulatum*.\n\n**Step 2: Determining the Endemic Location**\nNow that the plant is identified, I will research its native habitat. Botanical databases and horticultural sources state that while the species *Pittosporum daphniphylloides* is found in parts of mainland China, the specific variety *reticulatum* with this pronounced net-veined pattern is endemic to the island of Taiwan.\n\nI will now write a simple Python script to state this finding.\n\n```python\n# The plant in the image is identified as Pittosporum daphniphylloides var. reticulatum.\n# This plant variety is known for its distinct net-like leaf venation.\n# Research shows that this variety is endemic to a specific island.\n\nisland_name = \"Taiwan\"\n\nprint(f\"The plant in the image is endemic to the island of {island_name}.\")\n```\n<<<Taiwan>>>"
