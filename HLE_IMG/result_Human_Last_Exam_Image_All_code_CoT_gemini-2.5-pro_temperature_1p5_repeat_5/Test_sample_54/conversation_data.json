    "Here is a step-by-step plan to identify reagents A and B:\n\n1.  **Analyze Reaction A (Compound 1 → Compound 2):**\n    *   First, compare the structure of the starting material (1) with the product (2).\n    *   The key change is in the bottom heterocyclic ring. One of the ring oxygen atoms in compound 1 is replaced by an N-amino group (`>N-NH2`) in compound 2.\n    *   This type of transformation, where a ring oxygen in a pyrylium-like salt is replaced by a nitrogen group, is a classic reaction in heterocyclic chemistry.\n    *   The reagent required to introduce an `N-NH2` group is hydrazine (`H2N-NH2`).\n    *   Therefore, reagent A is hydrazine.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction B (Compound 2 → Compound 3):**\n    *   Next, compare the structure of compound 2 with the final product (3). Two significant transformations have occurred.\n    *   First, the N-amino group (`>N-NH2`) at the bottom of compound 2 has been converted to an N-H group in compound 3. This is a deamination reaction.\n    *   Second, the top-left portion of the molecule has undergone a major structural change. The two methoxy (`-OCH3`) groups have been removed, and a new six-membered ring containing a nitrogen atom with a propyl group (`-CH2CH2CH3`) has been formed via cyclization.\n    *   Reagent B must be the source of the `N-propyl` group. The simplest and most common chemical reagent for this purpose is **n-propylamine** (`CH3CH2CH2NH2`).\n    *   In this reaction, n-propylamine acts as a nucleophile to form the new ring and as a base, likely with heating, to facilitate the complex cyclization and the deamination.\n    *   Therefore, reagent B is n-propylamine.\n\n```python\ndef identify_reagents():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the reagents A and B in the provided chemical reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Reagent A ---\n    reagent_A = \"Hydrazine (H2N-NH2)\"\n    explanation_A = (\n        \"In the first step (1 -> 2), a ring oxygen atom is replaced by an N-amino group (>N-NH2). \"\n        \"This is a standard reaction to convert oxygen-containing heterocycles (like pyrylium salts) \"\n        \"into their N-amino pyridinium analogues.
