    This function identifies the correct image by analyzing visual features.
    
    Analysis:
    1.  The target bird has a distinct scalloped feather pattern on its back.
    2.  The white edges of the wing feathers form a unique set of curves.
    3.  There is a small, subtle dark patch/irregularity in the pattern on the upper back of the target bird.
    4.  The background of the target image contains a vertical black object.
    
    Comparison:
    - Image C exhibits the exact same scalloped pattern as the target.
    - The wing feather patterns are identical.
    - The unique dark patch on the upper back is present in image C.
    - The same black background object is visible in image C in the same relative position.
    
    Conclusion: Image C is a crop from the same photograph as the target image.
