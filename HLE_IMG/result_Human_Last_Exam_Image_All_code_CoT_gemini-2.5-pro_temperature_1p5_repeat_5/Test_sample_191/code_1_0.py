    This function assembles the answers to a multi-part question about Psalm 139:16.
    The questions cover the Masoretic ketiv/qere tradition and its reception in
    medieval Jewish translations (Saadia Gaon, Yefet ben Eli) and the Aramaic Targum.
    """

    # 1) The provided Hebrew verse uses וְלֹא ('and not'), which is the Qere (read) tradition.
    answer1 = "q"

    # 2) The alternative variant is the Ketiv (written) form. The consonants are ולו.
    # Following the vocalization and accentuation of the Qere (וְלֹ֖א), the Ketiv form is וְלֹ֖ו.
    # This represents 'velo', meaning "and for him" or "and to it".
    answer2 = "וְלֹ֖ו"

    # 3) Saadia Gaon's Arabic translation in the provided image reads "...לא ואחד..." (...lā wāḥid...),
    # meaning "...not one...". This negation follows the Qere.
    answer3 = "q"

    # 4) The decisive word in Saadia's translation is the negative particle 'lā'.
    # In modern Arabic script, this is written as 'لا'.
    answer4 = "لا"

    # 5) Yefet ben Eli, a Karaite commentator, was known to favor the Ketiv.
    # His translation and commentary on this verse are based on the Ketiv 'ולו'.
    answer5 = "k"

    # 6) To render the Ketiv 'ולו' ("and to him"), Yefet's Arabic translation uses 'وله' (wa-lahu).
    # This affirmative phrase is the decisive evidence.
    answer6 = "وله"

    # 7) According to the catalog of the National Library of Israel, manuscript NLI Ms. Heb. 291
    # contains Yefet's commentary on two sections of Psalms. The first section is Psalms 73-89.
    answer7 = "ps.073-089"

    # 8) The provided Aramaic Targum uses the phrase 'ולית' (v'let), meaning "and there is not".
    # This negation clearly reflects the meaning of the Qere.
    answer8 = "q"

    # 9) The most decisive word in the Targum is the Aramaic negation 'ולית'.
    answer9 = "ולית"
