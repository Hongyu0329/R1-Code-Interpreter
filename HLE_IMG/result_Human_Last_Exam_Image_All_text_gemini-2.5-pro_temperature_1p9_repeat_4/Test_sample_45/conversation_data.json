    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand Rotational Symmetry:** Rotational symmetry describes how many times a figure or pattern matches itself when rotated in a full 360-degree circle around a central point. If a pattern matches itself 'n' times, it has n-fold rotational symmetry. The angle of rotation for this is 360°/n.\n\n2.  **Examine the Tiling's Components:** The tiling is constructed from several types of polygons:\n    *   Dark blue heptagons (7-sided figures).\n    *   Light yellow squares (4-sided figures).\n    *   Light yellow pentagons (5-sided figures).\n    *   Small orange rhombi (4-sided figures).\n\n3.  **Identify Potential Centers of Rotation:** To find the rotational symmetry of the entire pattern, we need to find a point around which a rotation will map the entire tiling onto itself. Likely candidates for these centers are the geometric centers of the individual tiles or the vertices where multiple tiles meet.\n\n4.  **Test a Heptagon as a Center of Rotation:**\n    *   Let's select the center of one of the dark blue heptagons.\n    *   A regular heptagon itself has 7-fold symmetry. We need to check if the pattern surrounding it also respects this symmetry.\n    *   Each blue heptagon is surrounded by 7 light yellow pentagons. Furthermore, the gaps between these pentagons are filled by 7 orange rhombi, creating a larger star-shaped motif.\n    *   If we rotate this entire star-shaped motif by an angle of 360°/7 (approximately 51.4°), each element of the motif (heptagon, pentagon, rhombus) lands precisely on the position of an identical element.\n    *   Looking at the larger pattern, we see that these 7-fold symmetric motifs are repeated throughout. Therefore, rotating the entire tiling by 360°/7 around the center of any blue heptagon leaves the pattern unchanged.\n    *   This confirms that the tiling has **7-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n5.  **Test Other Potential Centers:**\n    *   **Center of a Square:** If we take the center of a light yellow square, we can see that rotating it by 360°/4 = 90° also maps the pattern onto itself. So, the tiling also has points of **4-fold rotational symmetry**.\n    *   **Vertices:** There are also points of **2-fold rotational symmetry** (a 180° turn), for example, at the vertices where two yellow pentagons and one orange rhombus meet.\n\n6.  **Determine the Overall Symmetry:** When a pattern has multiple orders of rotational symmetry, the question \"what is the rotational symmetry?\" typically refers to the highest order present, as this is the most defining characteristic of the pattern's symmetry group. In this case, we have found 2-fold, 4-fold, and 7-fold symmetries.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe highest order of rotational symmetry present in the tiling is 7-fold. This is a characteristic of a quasicrystalline tiling, which can have symmetries (like 5-fold, 7-fold, 8-fold) not allowed in standard periodic crystals.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It's important to look at the symmetry of the whole pattern, not just one tile in isolation. The arrangement of tiles around a central point determines the symmetry.\n*   Identify the highest order of symmetry, as this is typically what is meant by \"the\" symmetry of the pattern.\n*   Recognize that this is not a standard periodic wallpaper group pattern, as the 7-fold symmetry violates the crystallographic restriction theorem.\n\nThe final answer is the highest order of rotational symmetry found.\n\n<<<7>>>"
