    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and determine its molecular formula.**\n\n*   **Structure Identification:** The starting material is a bicyclic compound containing a lactam (cyclic amide). Based on its connectivity, it is a derivative of a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-en-3-one skeleton. A 7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hepten-2-one structure is ruled out because the carbonyl group would not be adjacent to the nitrogen, thus it would not be a lactam and would not undergo the final hydrolysis step.\n*   **Let's determine the formula of the core structure:** The parent unsubstituted lactam, 2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-en-3-one, consists of 7 carbon atoms, 1 nitrogen atom, 1 oxygen atom, and 9 hydrogen atoms. Its molecular formula is C7H9NO.\n    *   Let's verify the hydrogen count: The bridgehead carbons (C1, C4) each have one hydrogen. The carbons of the double bond (C5, C6) each have one hydrogen. The saturated bridge carbons (C7, C8) form a CH2-CH2 unit (4 hydrogens). The nitrogen atom has one hydrogen. Total H = 1 (C1) + 1 (C4) + 1 (C5) + 1 (C6) + 2 (C7) + 2 (C8) + 1 (N) = 9 hydrogens. This is correct.\n*   **Add the substituents to find the starting material's formula:**\n    1.  **PMB (para-methoxybenzyl) group:** This group, -CH2-C6H4-OCH3, has the formula C8H9O. It replaces the hydrogen on the nitrogen atom. So we subtract H and add C8H9O.\n    2.  **CF3 (trifluoromethyl) group:** This group replaces a hydrogen on the double bond (e.g., at C5). So we subtract H and add CF3.\n*   **Calculate the molecular formula of the starting material:**\n    *   Starting from the core C7H9NO:\n    *   Carbons (C): 7 (core) + 8 (PMB) + 1 (from CF3) = 16\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 9 (core) - 1 (for PMB) - 1 (for CF3) + 9 (from PMB) = 16\n    *   Nitrogens (N): 1\n    *   Oxygens (O): 1 (core) + 1 (PMB) = 2\n    *   Fluorines (F): 3\n    *   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C16H16F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the molecular formula of Intermediate 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material reacts with CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O. CAN is an oxidizing agent commonly used to cleave the N-PMB bond, removing the PMB protecting group and leaving an N-H bond.\n*   **Change in Formula:** The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed and replaced by a single hydrogen atom (H). The net change is the subtraction of a p-methoxybenzylidene group (-C8H8O).\n*   **Calculate the formula of Intermediate 1:**\n    *   Starting from C16H16F3NO2:\n    *   C: 16 - 8 = 8\n    *   H: 16 - 8 = 8\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   F: 3\n    *   The molecular formula of Intermediate 1 is **C8H8F3NO**. (This corresponds to 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-en-3-one).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the molecular formula of Intermediate 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Intermediate 1 is treated with Pd/C and H2 in MeOH. This is a standard catalytic hydrogenation which reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C). The lactam carbonyl (C=O) is typically not reduced under these mild conditions.\n*   **Change in Formula:** The hydrogenation of one C=C bond adds two hydrogen atoms (H2) to the molecule.\n*   **Calculate the formula of Intermediate 2:**\n    *   Starting from C8H8F3NO:\n    *   C: 8\n    *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 1\n    *   F: 3\n    *   The molecular formula of Intermediate 2 is **C8H10F3NO**. (This corresponds to the saturated lactam, 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-3-one).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the molecular formula of the final product.**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Intermediate 2 is heated with 4 N HCl. These are conditions for the acidic hydrolysis of a lactam (amide). The reaction opens the lactam ring by cleaving the amide C-N bond.\n*   **Change in Formula:** Hydrolysis involves the addition of one molecule of water (H2O). The carbonyl carbon becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and the nitrogen atom becomes an amino group (-NH2), which will be protonated to an ammonium group (-NH3+) in the acidic conditions. For the molecular formula of the neutral product, we consider the addition of H2O.\n*   **Calculate the formula of the Product:**\n    *   Starting from C8H10F3NO:\n    *   C: 8\n    *   H: 10 + 2 (from H2O) = 12\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 1 + 1 (from H2O) = 2\n    *   F: 3\n    *   The molecular formula of the final product is **C8H12F3NO2**. (This corresponds to an isomer of 4-amino-2-(trifluoromethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid).\n\nThe final molecular formula of the product is C8H12F3NO2.\n\n<<<C8H12F3NO2>>>"
