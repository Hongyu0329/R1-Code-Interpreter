The structures of the three products are:

*   **A: Acetamide**
    *   A primary amide with the structure CH₃-C(=O)-NH₂.

*   **B: Tetrahydro-3H-pyrrolizin-3-one**
    *   A bicyclic ketone. It consists of two five-membered rings fused together, sharing a bridgehead nitrogen atom. There is a carbonyl group (C=O) at the C3 position of the pyrrolizine ring system. A representative structure would be 1,2-dihydro-3H-pyrrolizin-3-one.
    *   Structure: A pyrrolidine ring is fused at the N-C5 bond to a second five-membered ring containing a ketone alpha to the nitrogen and a double bond.

*   **C: N-acetylpyrrolidine**
    *   A five-membered saturated ring containing a nitrogen atom (pyrrolidine), where the nitrogen atom is substituted with an acetyl group (-C(=O)CH₃).
