    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the substituents at the indicated positions.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reaction Type**\nThe reaction shows a complex polycyclic alcohol (a triterpenoid) reacting with catalytic hydrochloric acid (HCl) at a high temperature (110 Â°C). This is a classic acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction. The formation of a rearranged alkene product from an alcohol under these conditions strongly indicates a mechanism involving carbocation intermediates, which are prone to rearrangement. The question specifies that the rearrangement involves a number of [1,2] shifts, commonly known as a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement or a \"backbone rearrangement\" in terpene chemistry.\n\n**Step 2: Propose the Initial Step - Formation of a Carbocation**\n1.  The acid (HCl) protonates the hydroxyl (-OH) group on the starting material. The OH group is located at what is typically the C3 position in triterpenoid numbering.\n2.  The protonated hydroxyl group (-OH2+) is an excellent leaving group and departs as a molecule of water (H2O).\n3.  This departure leaves behind a positive charge on the carbon atom where the hydroxyl group was attached, forming a secondary carbocation at C3.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Rearrangement Cascade**\nA secondary carbocation is relatively unstable and will rearrange to form a more stable carbocation if possible. The final product's structure provides crucial clues about the rearrangement pathway.\n\n*   **Observation from the Product:** In the product molecule, the gem-dimethyl group at the C4 position (adjacent to the initial carbocation site) appears to be intact. One methyl group is explicitly labeled \"H3C\", and the other is indicated by the numbered position \"1\". This suggests that **position 1 is a methyl group (CH3)** and that the C4 carbon atom is not directly involved as a cation in the rearrangement cascade (otherwise, its substitution pattern would have changed).\n*   **Revised Mechanism - The \"Zipper\" Reaction:** For the C4 gem-dimethyl group to remain untouched, the positive charge must be transferred from C3 without involving a shift from C4. A standard [1,2]-hydride shift from C2 would lead to another secondary carbocation, which is not a favorable step. However, a transannular **[1,3]-hydride shift** from C5 to C3 is possible. This would transfer the positive charge directly to C5, forming a more stable tertiary carbocation. This is the key step that initiates the main cascade while preserving the C4 structure.\n*   **The Cascade of [1,2] shifts:** Now, starting from the tertiary carbocation at C5 (C5+), a cascade of [1,2] shifts proceeds along the fused ring system (the \"backbone\") toward the other end of the molecule. In each step, a neighboring group (either a hydrogen atom or a methyl group) migrates to the positively charged carbon, thus moving the positive charge to its original position.\n\nLet's trace the moving groups:\n1.  **Start:** Carbocation is at C5.\n2.  **Shift A:** The **CH3 group** at C10 migrates to C5. The positive charge moves to C10.\n    *   Result: The substituent at C5 (Position 2) is now **CH3**.\n3.  **Shift B:** The **H atom** at C9 migrates to C10. The positive charge moves to C9.\n    *   Result: The substituent at C10 (Position 3) is now **H**.\n4.  **Shift C:** The **CH3 group** at C8 migrates to C9. The positive charge moves to C8.\n    *   Result: The substituent at C9 (Position 4) is now **CH3**.\n5.  **Shift D:** The **H atom** at C13 migrates to C8. The positive charge moves to C13.\n    *   Result: The substituent at C8 (Position 5) is now **H**.\n\n**Step 4: Termination of the Reaction**\nThe cascade of shifts ends with the formation of a stable tertiary carbocation at C13. The reaction then terminates by an elimination step. A proton is removed from an adjacent carbon (C12), forming a stable tetrasubstituted double bond between C12 and C13, which is seen in the final product.\n\n**Step 5: Final Determination of Substituents**\nBased on the mechanism that is consistent with the product's structure:\n*   **Position 1 (at C4):** This position was part of the original gem-dimethyl group at C4, which was not involved in the rearrangement. Thus, the substituent is **CH3**.\n*   **Position 2 (at C5):** This position originally held an H atom but received a CH3 group from C10. Thus, the substituent is **CH3**.\n*   **Position 3 (at C10):** This position originally held a CH3 group but received an H atom from C9. Thus, the substituent is **H**.\n*   **Position 4 (at C9):** This position originally held an H atom but received a CH3 group from C8. Thus, the substituent is **CH3**.\n*   **Position 5 (at C8):** This position originally held a CH3 group but received an H atom from C13. Thus, the substituent is **H**.\n\nThe final assignment is:\n1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H.\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
