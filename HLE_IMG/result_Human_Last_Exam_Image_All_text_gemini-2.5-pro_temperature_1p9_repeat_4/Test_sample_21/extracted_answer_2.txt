In theory, the fiscal expansion will have no impact on the country's current account balance. The decrease in public saving caused by the debt-financed spending is completely nullified by an equal increase in private saving, leading to no change in national saving. Since the current account is the difference between national saving and investment, and neither changes, the current account balance remains unchanged.
