    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algorithm's Logic\n\nLet's break down the `sort(a, n)` function:\n1.  **`if n > 1:`**: This is the recursive condition. The base case is when `n <= 1` (an array of size 0 or 1 is already sorted), at which point the function does nothing and returns.\n2.  **`sort(a, n - 1)`**: This is the first recursive call. It attempts to sort the first `n-1` elements of the array, from index `0` to `n-2`.\n3.  **`if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:`**: After the first `n-1` elements are sorted, this line compares the last element (`a[n-1]`) with its immediate predecessor (`a[n-2]`).\n4.  **`swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`**: If the last element is smaller, it's swapped with its predecessor. This moves the larger of the two elements to the `(n-1)`th position.\n5.  **`sort(a, n - 1)`**: This is the crucial second recursive call. If a swap occurred, it means the new element at position `n-2` (which was the original `a[n-1]`) might be out of order with the rest of the `n-2` elements before it. To fix this, the algorithm re-sorts the entire prefix of `n-1` elements again.\n\nThis algorithm essentially works by sorting the first `n-1` elements, then placing the `n`th element. The placement method, however, can be very inefficient, potentially requiring a full re-sort of the prefix.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Recurrence Relation for Time Complexity\n\nLet `T(n)` represent the time complexity for sorting an array of size `n`.\nThe work done inside the function `sort(a, n)` for a single call (excluding the recursive calls) consists of a comparison and a potential swap. This takes constant time, which we can denote as `c` or `O(1)`.\n\nWe need to consider two cases for the recurrence relation:\n\n*   **Best Case:** If the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is false (e.g., the array is already sorted), the second recursive call is skipped. The recurrence is:\n    `T(n) = T(n - 1) + c`\n    This unfolds to `T(n) = O(n)`.\n\n*   **Worst Case:** We want the worst-case complexity, so we assume the scenario that leads to the maximum amount of work. The `if` condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is always met, triggering the expensive second recursive call at every level of recursion.\n    The recurrence relation for the worst case is:\n    `T(n) = T(n-1) + c + T(n-1)`\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n    The base case is `T(1) = c'` (a constant time operation).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Worst-Case Input\n\nThe worst-case scenario happens when an input forces the second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` to be executed at every step. This occurs when the smallest element is consistently found at the end of the sub-array being considered. A reverse-sorted array, like `[n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1]`, is a perfect example of such an input.\n\nLet's trace `sort([3, 2, 1], 3)`:\n1.  `sort(a, 3)` calls `sort(a, 2)`.\n    *   `sort(a, 2)` calls `sort(a, 1)` (returns). `a` is `[3, 2, 1]`.\n    *   `if a[1] < a[0]` (i.e., `2 < 3`) is true.\n    *   `swap(a[1], a[0])`. `a` becomes `[2, 3, 1]`.\n    *   `sort(a, 1)` is called again (returns).\n    *   `sort(a, 2)` finishes. The prefix of size 2 is now sorted (`[2, 3]`). The full array is `[2, 3, 1]`.\n2.  Back in `sort(a, 3)`, the first `sort(a, 2)` is done.\n3.  `if a[2] < a[1]` (i.e., `1 < 3`) is true.\n4.  `swap(a[2], a[1])`. `a` becomes `[2, 1, 3]`.\n5.  The second `sort(a, 2)` is called. This again performs the full work to sort `[2, 1]` into `[1, 2]`. The final array becomes `[1, 2, 3]`.\n\nAs you can see, the second recursive call was triggered at both `n=3` and `n=2`.\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Worst-Case Recurrence Relation\n\nWe need to solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`.\n\nLet's expand it:\n*   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n*   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n*   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n*   ... after `k` steps ...\n*   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) + ... + 1)`\n\nWe expand until we reach the base case `T(1)`. This happens when `n-k = 1`, so `k = n-1`.\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-2) + ... + 2^0)`\n\nThe term `(2^(n-2) + ... + 2^0)` is a geometric series with sum `(2^(n-1) - 1) / (2-1) = 2^(n-1) - 1`.\nSince `T(1)` is a constant, let's call it `c'`.\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c' + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n`T(n) = c' * 2^(n-1) + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n`T(n) = (c' + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\nIn Big-O notation, the constants are ignored, and the dominant term is `2^(n-1)`, which is of the order `O(2^n)`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe worst-case time complexity is determined by the recurrence `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + O(1)`, which solves to `O(2^n)`. This corresponds to an exponential time complexity.\n\nFinal check of options:\nA. O(n) - Best case, not worst case.\nB. O(n log n) - Typical for efficient comparison sorts (Merge Sort, Heap Sort).\nC. O(n^2) - Typical for simple sorts (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort).\nD. O(n^3) - Not indicated by the recurrence.\nE. O(2^n) - Matches our analysis.\nF. does not terminate - The algorithm terminates because the recursive parameter `n` decreases in each call.\n\nThe correct answer is O(2^n).\n\n<<<E>>>"
