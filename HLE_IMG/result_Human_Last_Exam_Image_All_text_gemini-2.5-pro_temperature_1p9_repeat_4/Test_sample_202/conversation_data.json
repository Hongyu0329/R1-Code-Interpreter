    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each rock specimen to determine its identity.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:**\n    *   **Color:** The rock is reddish-brown. This color is often due to the presence of oxidized iron.\n    *   **Texture:** The most prominent feature is its vesicular texture, meaning it is full of small, bubble-like cavities (vesicles). These are formed by gases escaping from lava as it cools. The rock appears rough and porous.\n    *   **Formation:** The vesicular texture indicates it's an extrusive igneous (volcanic) rock that cooled rapidly at the Earth's surface.\n    *   **Identification:** The combination of a vesicular texture and a mafic or intermediate composition (indicated by the darker, reddish color) is characteristic of **Scoria**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Specimen J:**\n    *   **Color:** The rock is very light-colored, ranging from white to light grey. This suggests a felsic composition, rich in silica.\n    *   **Texture:** Like specimen H, this rock is highly vesicular. However, it appears much more porous and frothy, almost like a sponge. It looks very lightweight.\n    *   **Formation:** It is also an extrusive igneous rock formed from gas-rich lava. The extreme porosity is a key feature.\n    *   **Identification:** A lightweight, highly vesicular, felsic (light-colored) volcanic rock is identified as **Pumice**. It is often so porous that it can float in water.\n\n3.  **Analyze Specimen I:**\n    *   **Composition:** This rock is clearly composed of many different pieces cemented together. These pieces, or clasts, vary in size, color, and type. The clasts are embedded in a fine-grained gray matrix.\n    *   **Texture:** This is a clastic rock. The defining feature of the clasts is their shape; they are angular and sharp-edged.\n    *   **Formation:** The angularity of the clasts indicates they were not transported far from their source before being cemented together, as transport tends to round rock fragments. A rock made of large, angular clasts cemented in a matrix is a breccia.\n    *   **Identification:** This specimen is **Breccia**. Given the potential volcanic context of the other samples, it might specifically be a volcanic breccia.\n\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:**\n    *   **Color:** The rock has a mix of light-colored (white, tan, grey) and dark-colored minerals. Overall, it is light-colored, suggesting a felsic to intermediate composition.\n    *   **Texture:** The rock is composed of large, interlocking mineral crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. This is known as a phaneritic (coarse-grained) texture. The crystals are exceptionally large.\n    *   **Formation:** A phaneritic texture indicates that the rock is intrusive igneous, meaning it cooled very slowly deep within the Earth's crust, which allowed large crystals time to grow.\n    *   **Identification:** An intrusive igneous rock with exceptionally large crystals is known as a **Pegmatite**. Pegmatites are distinguished by their very large crystal size, often with a composition similar to granite.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Pegmatite\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
