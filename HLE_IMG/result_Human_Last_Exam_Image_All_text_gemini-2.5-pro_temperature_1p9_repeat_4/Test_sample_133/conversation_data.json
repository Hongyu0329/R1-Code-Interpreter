    "**Step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecular Ion (M⁺) Cluster:**\n    *   The peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) are observed at m/z 262, 264, and 266. These likely represent the molecular ion cluster.\n    *   From the table, the relative intensities are:\n        *   m/z 262: I = 29.0%\n        *   m/z 264: I = 12.9%\n        *   m/z 266: I = 3.22%\n    *   The pattern of peaks separated by 2 mass units (M⁺, M+2, M+4) is characteristic of molecules containing chlorine or bromine.\n\n2.  **Determine the Number and Type of Halogen Atoms:**\n    *   The theoretical isotope ratio for one chlorine atom (³⁵Cl:³⁷Cl ≈ 3:1) would give a M⁺:M+2 ratio of 3:1.\n    *   The theoretical isotope ratio for two chlorine atoms is (3:1)² = 9:6:1 for M⁺:M+2:M+4.\n    *   The theoretical isotope ratio for one bromine atom (⁷⁹Br:⁸¹Br ≈ 1:1) would give a M⁺:M+2 ratio of 1:1.\n    *   The theoretical isotope ratio for two bromine atoms is (1:1)² = 1:2:1 for M⁺:M+2:M+4.\n    *   Let's analyze the observed ratio: 29.0 : 12.9 : 3.22. If we normalize to the M+4 peak (3.22), we get a ratio of (29.0/3.22) : (12.9/3.22) : 1, which is approximately **9.0 : 4.0 : 1**.\n    *   This is very close to the theoretical 9:6:1 pattern for a molecule containing **two chlorine atoms**. The intensity of the M+2 peak is lower than expected, which can sometimes happen, but the presence of the M+4 peak with an intensity of about 1/9 of the M⁺ peak is a strong indicator of a Cl₂-containing compound. The peak at m/z 262 is the molecular ion containing two ³⁵Cl isotopes.\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   The molecular weight of the molecule with two ³⁵Cl isotopes is 262 Da.\n    *   The mass of two chlorine atoms (2 × ³⁵Cl) is 70 Da.\n    *   The mass of the rest of the molecule (the non-halogen part, R) is 262 - 70 = 192 Da.\n    *   We need to find a plausible formula for a hydrocarbon skeleton (R = CₓHᵧ...) with a mass of 192.\n        *   Assuming R is composed of carbon and hydrogen (CₓHᵧ): 192 / 12 (mass of C) ≈ 16.\n        *   If x = 15, mass of carbon is 15 × 12 = 180. Remaining mass for hydrogen is 192 - 180 = 12. This gives a formula of **C₁₅H₁₂** for the radical R.\n    *   Therefore, the most likely molecular formula for the compound is **C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Major Fragmentation Peaks:**\n    *   **Base Peak:** The most intense peak in the spectrum (base peak) is at **m/z 225** (I = 100%).\n    *   **Major Fragments:** Other significant peaks are at m/z 227 (66.7%), m/z 190 (48.4%), m/z 118 (43.5%).\n    *   **Fragmentation Pathway:** Let's propose a pathway from the molecular ion (M⁺ = 262) to the base peak (225).\n        *   A common fragmentation is the loss of a halogen radical. Loss of a ³⁵Cl radical from M⁺ (262) gives a fragment at m/z = 262 - 35 = 227. There is a strong peak at m/z 227, which supports this step.\n        *   The fragment at m/z 227 corresponds to the [C₁₅H₁₂Cl]⁺ ion. We can verify this by checking its isotope peak. A fragment with one chlorine atom should have an isotope peak at [M+2] with about 1/3 the intensity. In the table, we see peaks at m/z 227 (I=66.7) and m/z 229 (I=22.2). The ratio 66.7 / 22.2 ≈ 3.0, which perfectly matches the 3:1 ratio for a single chlorine atom. This confirms the identity of the m/z 227 fragment.\n        *   The base peak is at m/z 225, which is 2 mass units less than the m/z 227 fragment. This corresponds to the loss of a neutral hydrogen molecule (H₂). [C₁₅H₁₂Cl]⁺ → [C₁₅H₁₀Cl]⁺ + H₂. The loss of H₂ is common in polycyclic aromatic compounds as it can lead to a more stable, highly conjugated or fully aromatic ion. This explains why the daughter ion at m/z 225 is more abundant than its precursor at m/z 227.\n        *   Now consider the next major fragment at m/z 190. The mass difference from the base peak (225) is 225 - 190 = 35. This corresponds to the loss of the remaining ³⁵Cl radical. [C₁₅H₁₀Cl]⁺ → [C₁₅H₁₀]⁺ + Cl˙.\n    *   This fragmentation pathway (M⁺ → [M-Cl]⁺ → [M-Cl-H₂]⁺ → [M-Cl-H₂-Cl]⁺) is highly consistent with the observed major peaks.\n\n5.  **Identify the Compound Structure and IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The analysis strongly suggests a molecule with the formula C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂. The fragmentation behavior (loss of H₂) points towards a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon core.\n    *   The C₁₅H₁₂ hydrocarbon framework can be attributed to a structure like methylphenanthrene or methylanthracene (C₁₄H₁₀ core + CH₃ group, requires removal of 1H for substitution, making it C₁₅H₁₂). However, this creates a fully aromatic system.\n    *   An even better fit for the observed fragmentation, particularly the facile loss of chlorine followed by stabilization, is a partially saturated structure. Let's consider a dihydrogenated anthracene core.\n    *   Parent structure: 9,10-dihydroanthracene (C₁₄H₁₂). Adding a methyl group gives methyl-9,10-dihydroanthracene (C₁₅H₁₄).\n    *   Adding two chlorine atoms by substitution (replacing two H atoms) gives C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂. For example, by placing the two chlorines on the saturated C9 and C10 positions.\n    *   Let's propose the structure: **9,10-dichloro-1-methyl-9,10-dihydroanthracene**.\n    *   The molecular formula is C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂. The exact mass for the C₁₅H₁₂³⁵Cl₂ isomer is 15*12.0000 + 12*1.0078 + 2*34.9689 = 180 + 12.0936 + 69.9378 = 262.0314. This matches the molecular ion peak at m/z 262.\n    *   This structure readily explains the fragmentation: facile loss of a chlorine atom from a saturated carbon, followed by loss of HCl to form a stable aromatic anthracene system (ion at m/z 226), which then loses a hydrogen radical to form the very stable aromatic cation at m/z 225. This pathway provides a strong rationale for m/z 225 being the base peak.\n\nThe systematic IUPAC name for this compound, assuming the methyl group is at position 1 and the chlorines are at positions 9 and 10, is 9,10-dichloro-1-methyl-9,10-dihydroanthracene.\n\n<<<9,10-dichloro-1-methyl-9,10-dihydroanthracene>>>"
