    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the jazz standard from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Key and Overall Form:**\n    *   The key signature has one flat (Bb), which typically indicates F major or D minor. However, the first chord is an F minor (F-), and the piece is centered around this chord. This suggests the key is F minor. Jazz charts sometimes simplify key signatures, relying on accidentals.\n    *   The form of the piece can be seen with the repeat signs and first/second endings. It has multiple distinct sections.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chord Progression (Harmony):**\n    *   The first section features a very distinctive chord progression with a descending chromatic bass line:\n        *   Bar 1: **F-** (F minor)\n        *   Bar 2: **E-7b5** (E half-diminished 7th)\n        *   Bar 3: **Eb-6** (E-flat minor 6th)\n        *   Bar 4: **Dbmaj7** followed by **G7**\n    *   This opening sequence with the bass line moving F -> E -> Eb is a strong harmonic fingerprint.\n    *   The middle section of the tune (starting around measure 11) transitions through a series of dominant chords and ii-V progressions: `D-7b5 | G7 | C7 | F7 | Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab...`. This type of progression, moving through different key centers, is common in the bridge sections of jazz standards from the hard bop era.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Melody:**\n    *   Let's transcribe the melody in the first few measures:\n        *   Bar 1: The notes are C, F, G, A♭.\n        *   Bar 2: G, F, E♮, E♭.\n        *   Bar 3: D, C, B♮, B♭.\n    *   This specific melodic contour, especially the descending pattern after the initial phrase, is highly recognizable.\n\n4.  **Identify the Tune:**\n    *   By combining the analysis of the harmony and melody, we can identify the composition.\n    *   The characteristic opening progression with the chromatic descending bass line (`F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6...`) and the specific melodic phrase are trademarks of the jazz standard **\"Nica's Dream\"**.\n    *   The composer of \"Nica's Dream\" is the renowned jazz pianist and composer **Horace Silver**.\n    *   The piece is written in what appears to be a handwritten \"lead sheet\" format, common in jazz fake books. This specific chart is in the key of F minor, while the tune is also very commonly played in Bb minor (its original key). The chords and melody in this chart are a direct transposition and accurate representation of the composition.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Key Transposition:** It's important to recognize that jazz standards are often played in multiple keys. This chart is in F minor, but searching for the tune might bring up versions in Bb minor. The musical relationships between chords and melody notes remain the same.\n*   **Chord Voicing/Variations:** Jazz charts, especially handwritten ones, can have slight variations in the chord symbols (e.g., F- vs F-7, Eb-6 vs Ab-6). The core harmony and root movement are the most critical elements for identification. The progression here is a common and correct representation of the tune's harmony.\n*   **Melody as a Key Identifier:** In this case, the melody is just as distinctive as the chords. Confirming that both match is the most reliable way to identify the tune.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the unique melodic content and the characteristic chromatic chord progression, the sheet music is for the jazz standard \"Nica's Dream\", composed by Horace Silver.\n\n<<<Title: Nica's Dream, Composer: Horace Silver>>>"
