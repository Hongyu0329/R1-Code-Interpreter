    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **VMT vs. PMT:** The question asks for the reduction in Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), not Person Miles Traveled (PMT). VMT measures the distance traveled by the vehicle itself.\n2.  **Car Occupancy:** Because we are calculating VMT, the number of occupants in a car is not directly relevant. One car trip counts as one vehicle trip, regardless of whether it has 1 occupant or is a carpool. Therefore, the data on \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" is not needed for this specific calculation.\n3.  **Total Car Share:** To find the total VMT for cars, we must combine the two car categories provided: \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\". The mode share for these two should be added together for each distance category.\n4.  **Weighted Calculation:** The total VMT is a weighted sum of the VMT from each distance category. The \"share of total trips\" for each distance band acts as the weight.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\nTo find the overall VMT, we will calculate a proportional VMT index for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios. This index is the sum of the VMT contributions from each of the four distance categories.\n\nThe formula for each category's contribution to the VMT index is:\n`VMT Contribution = (Share of Total Trips) × (Total Car Mode Share for the category) × (Average Trip Distance)`\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Baseline Car VMT Index (from Table 1)**\n\n*   **0-3 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 25% (1 occupant) + 28% (>2 occupants) = 53%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.48 (share of trips) × 0.53 (car share) × 1 (avg distance) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = 2.8480\n\n*   **Total Baseline VMT Index:**\n    *   0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Proposed Car VMT Index (from Table 2)**\n\n*   **0-3 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.48 × 0.03 × 1 = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = 1.5680\n\n*   **Total Proposed VMT Index:**\n    *   0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\nThe formula for percentage reduction is: `((Baseline - Proposed) / Baseline) × 100`\n\n*   VMT Reduction = Baseline VMT Index - Proposed VMT Index\n*   VMT Reduction = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n\n*   Percentage Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100\n*   Percentage Reduction = 0.52195... × 100\n*   Percentage Reduction ≈ 52.2%\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
