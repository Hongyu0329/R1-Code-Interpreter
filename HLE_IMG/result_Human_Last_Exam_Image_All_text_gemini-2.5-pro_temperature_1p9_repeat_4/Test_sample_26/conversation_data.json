    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n**1. Identify the Key Signature and Overall Tonality**\n*   The piece is Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor, Op. 13.\n*   The key signature for the first movement (Allegro di molto e con brio section) is C minor, which has three flats: B♭, E♭, and A♭. This establishes C as the tonic.\n\n**2. Locate Measure 30**\n*   The image provided shows several systems of music. The second system starts at measure 28.\n*   Measure 30 is the third measure of the second system. It is highlighted with a circle in the provided image.\n\n**3. Identify the Notes in Measure 30**\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The notes played are F#, A, C, and E♭. These are written as broken 16th-note figures.\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The notes played are D (as an octave with the D an octave below) on the first beat, followed by a held D. The lowest and most prominent bass note is D.\n\n**4. Assemble the Chord**\n*   Combining all the notes present in the measure, we have the following pitch collection: **D, F#, A, C, E♭**.\n\n**5. Determine the Root and Quality of the Chord**\n*   To identify the chord, we stack the notes into thirds. Starting with D as the root gives us:\n    *   **D** (Root)\n    *   **F#** (Major Third)\n    *   **A** (Perfect Fifth)\n    *   **C** (Minor Seventh)\n    *   **E♭** (Minor Ninth, or \"flat nine\")\n*   This forms a **D dominant seventh chord with a lowered ninth**, which is often notated as **D7(♭9)**. The F# is an accidental, not part of the C minor key signature, which is a strong indicator of a secondary or applied chord.\n\n**6. Analyze the Harmonic Function**\n*   In functional harmony, a dominant seventh chord typically resolves to a chord whose root is a perfect fifth below (or a perfect fourth above). A D7 chord has a strong tendency to resolve to a G chord.\n*   Let's examine the chord in the next measure, **measure 31**:\n    *   **Right Hand:** G, B♭, D\n    *   **Left Hand:** G (in octaves)\n*   These notes form a **G minor chord** (G-B♭-D).\n*   Now, we must relate this back to the home key of **C minor**. The G minor chord is the minor dominant chord in C minor. In Roman numerals, the dominant chord is represented by 'V'. Since it is a minor chord in this case, we denote it as **'v'**.\n*   The chord in measure 30, D7(♭9), is functioning as the dominant of the G minor chord in measure 31. This is a **secondary dominant** or **applied dominant**.\n*   We notate a secondary dominant as \"V of...\" the chord it resolves to. Since the G minor chord is the 'v' chord in C minor, the D7 chord is the **V7 of v**.\n\n**7. Check the Inversion**\n*   The root of the chord is D.\n*   The bass note (the lowest note played) in measure 30 is D.\n*   Since the root of the chord is in the bass, the chord is in **root position**. No inversion figures are needed after the main Roman numeral.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe chord in measure 30 is a root position secondary dominant seventh chord that resolves to the minor dominant (v) of C minor. Therefore, the correct Roman numeral is V7/v.\n\n<<<V7/v>>>"
