    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to identify the piece:\n\n1.  **Initial Observations:**\n    *   **Instrumentation:** The score is written on a grand staff (a treble clef staff and a bass clef staff connected by a brace), which is standard notation for piano music.\n    *   **Key Signature:** There are three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭) in the key signature. This indicates the key is either C minor or E♭ major. The piece begins with a clear C minor chord in the left hand (C-G-C), establishing C minor as the home key.\n    *   **Time Signature:** The time signature is common time (4/4).\n    *   **Tempo:** A tempo marking of `♩ = 80` (80 quarter notes per minute) is given, suggesting a moderate, flowing pace (Andante or Moderato).\n\n2.  **Musical Characteristics Analysis:**\n    *   **Dynamics:** There is a very wide and dramatic dynamic range. The piece starts *p* (piano, soft), then abruptly jumps to *f* (forte, loud) in the third measure. Other markings like *mp* (mezzo-piano) and *mf* (mezzo-forte) appear later, indicating frequent changes in volume and intensity.\n    *   **Texture and Rhythm:** The texture shifts dramatically. It begins with a lyrical melody over simple arpeggiated chords (measures 1-2). Then, it explodes into dense, thick chords played rapidly in sixteenth notes by both hands (measures 3 onwards). This virtuosic, chordal writing is a major clue.\n    *   **Harmony and Style:** The harmony is lush, complex, and highly chromatic, characteristic of the late Romantic era. The powerful, passionate mood, combined with the technical demands (large chords, fast passages), strongly suggests a Romantic piano concerto or a large-scale solo piano work.\n    *   **Melodic and Rhythmic Motifs:**\n        *   The quiet theme at the beginning is poignant and song-like.\n        *   The loud section is built on relentless, driving sixteenth-note chords, creating a feeling of immense power and urgency. This dramatic contrast is a key feature.\n        *   Measure 11 features a rapid, decorative arpeggio-like figure (a *gruppetto* or turn, followed by a fast scale), another hallmark of virtuosic piano writing.\n\n3.  **Connecting the Clues (Deduction):**\n    *   The combination of the key (C minor), the extreme dynamic contrasts, the massive chordal writing, the passionate character, and the high level of technical difficulty are all quintessential stylistic traits of the Russian composer **Sergei Rachmaninoff**.\n    *   His most famous work in C minor is the **Piano Concerto No. 2, Op. 18**.\n    *   Checking the score of this concerto, this exact passage appears in the first movement (Moderato). The quiet, lyrical theme is the movement's second subject, introduced by the piano. The subsequent fiery passage of sixteenth-note chords is the start of the development section, a famously challenging and exhilarating part for the pianist.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe piece is the first movement of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor, Op. 18. The sheet music provided is from a solo piano reduction of the full orchestral score.\n\n<<<Sergei Rachmaninoff - Piano Concerto No. 2 in C minor, Op. 18 (specifically, from the 1st Movement)>>>"
