1. The music modulates to the key of E major.
2. The original key of the piece is C# minor. The new key, E major, is the relative major of C# minor. They are closely related because they share the same key signature of four sharps. This modulation is a standard and common practice in minor-key compositions to introduce a contrasting section, often the second theme in sonata form.
3. The chord on the first beat of measure 11 is a B major chord. It functions as the dominant chord of the new key, E major. Since E major is the mediant (III) chord in the home key of C# minor, the correct Roman numeral analysis for this secondary dominant is V/III.
