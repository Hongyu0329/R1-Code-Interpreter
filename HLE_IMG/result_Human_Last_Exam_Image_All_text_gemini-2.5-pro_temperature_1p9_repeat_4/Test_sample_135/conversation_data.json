    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the author of the artwork detail.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the image's medium and style:** The image shows a relief sculpture. The surface is smooth and appears slightly reflective, even in this black-and-white photograph. This technique, a light-colored (often white or blue) glazed terracotta relief, is the signature medium of a specific family workshop from the Italian Renaissance. The style of the figures is graceful, serene, and classical, typical of the Florentine High Renaissance.\n\n2.  **Identify the subject matter:** The scene depicts a religious ceremony. A priest is giving a wafer (the Host) to a kneeling figure, with other figures kneeling in prayer. This is the Christian sacrament of the Eucharist or Holy Communion.\n\n3.  **Examine the text:** At the bottom of the roundel, within a small banner (cartouche), there is an inscription. The zoomed-in crops help to read it more clearly. The text reads \"SACRAMENT DE L'AVTEL\". This is an archaic form of French or a related Romance language, translating to \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" which explicitly confirms the subject is the Eucharist.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the clues:**\n    *   **Medium:** Glazed terracotta relief.\n    *   **Style:** Florentine High Renaissance.\n    *   **Subject:** Sacrament of the Altar (Eucharist).\n    These clues overwhelmingly point to the workshop of the **della Robbia** family in Florence, who perfected and were famous for this type of art.\n\n5.  **Identify the specific artist and artwork:** The della Robbia workshop was active for several generations. The founder was Luca della Robbia, but his nephew, **Andrea della Robbia** (1435â€“1525), continued the workshop and produced a vast number of works in this style. This specific roundel is a well-known detail from the **Altarpiece of the Seven Sacraments**. This altarpiece is located in the Pieve delle Sante Flora e Lucilla in Santa Fiora, Tuscany, and is attributed to Andrea della Robbia and his workshop, created around 1475-1480. This particular roundel depicts the Eucharist, one of the seven sacraments featured on the altarpiece.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Medium:** Recognizing the glazed terracotta is the most crucial first step, as it immediately narrows down the possible artists to the della Robbia workshop.\n*   **Text:** The inscription \"SACRAMENT DE L'AVTEL\" is a specific identifier that helps confirm the subject matter and can be used to search for this specific piece.\n*   **Format:** The roundel (or *tondo*) format was very popular in Renaissance Italy and frequently used by the della Robbia family for decorative elements on altarpieces, facades, and in private chapels.\n*   **Attribution:** While Luca della Robbia started the workshop, the style of this particular piece, with its specific blend of sweetness and complex composition, is highly characteristic of his nephew, Andrea della Robbia, who became the leading figure of the workshop in the latter half of the 15th century.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the distinct medium of glazed terracotta relief, the Renaissance style, the subject matter, and the specific inscription, the detail is from the Altarpiece of the Seven Sacraments, and its author is Andrea della Robbia.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
