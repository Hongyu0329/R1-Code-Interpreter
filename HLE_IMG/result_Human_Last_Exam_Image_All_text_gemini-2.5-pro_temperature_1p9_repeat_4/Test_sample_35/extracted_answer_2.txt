The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **V-domain** of the RAGE receptor. This is evident from the diagram where S100B is shown directly binding to this specific extracellular immunoglobulin-like domain.

S100B could be used as a **prognostic marker** in the pathology of neurological disorders. Its role extends beyond that of a mere adjunct marker because it is not just correlated with the disease state but is an active driver of the pathology. As shown in the signaling cascade, higher levels of S100B lead to increased activation of RAGE, which in turn enhances downstream pathways causing apoptosis (via JNK/JUN) and neuroinflammation/neurodegeneration (via NF-ÎºB). Therefore, the level of S100B expression would likely correlate with the severity and rate of progression of neuronal damage, providing valuable prognostic information about the patient's future clinical course.
