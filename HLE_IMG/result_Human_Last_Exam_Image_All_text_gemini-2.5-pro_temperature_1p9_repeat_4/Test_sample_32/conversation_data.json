    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to distinguish the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question and Key Terms**\nThe question asks for the **main difference** in the **sporophyte** that allows for distinguishing *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* **at a glance**.\n*   **Sporophyte:** In mosses, this is the diploid generation that produces spores. It consists primarily of the foot (which anchors it to the gametophyte), the seta (the stalk), and the capsule (which contains the spores).\n*   **At a glance:** This implies a macroscopic or easily visible feature that doesn't require high-powered magnification or detailed dissection.\n*   **The Species:** We need to compare *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Sporophyte of *Grimmia montana***\n*   **Seta (Stalk):** The seta of *Grimmia montana* is very short and **straight**.\n*   **Capsule Position:** Because the seta is short and straight, the capsule is **immersed** or **emergent**. This means it sits nestled down among the perichaetial leaves (the special leaves surrounding the base of the sporophyte) and does not project significantly beyond them.\n*   **Overall Appearance:** The capsules appear to be sitting directly on the cushion of the moss, without a noticeable stalk holding them up.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta***\n*   **Seta (Stalk):** The name itself gives a major clue: *curvi* (curved) + *seta* (stalk). The seta of *Grimmia curviseta* is distinctively **curved**. It is typically cygneous (S-shaped) or arcuate (arched like a bow), especially when moist.\n*   **Capsule Position:** The seta is also long enough to make the capsule **exserted**, meaning it is held well above the leafy part of the plant. Due to the curved seta, the capsule often hangs or nods to one side.\n*   **Overall Appearance:** The capsules are clearly held up and away from the moss cushion on a visibly bent stalk.\n\n**Step 4: Directly Compare the Two and Identify the Main Difference**\nBy comparing the two descriptions, the most striking and immediately obvious difference is the nature of the seta.\n\n*   ***G. montana***: Straight, short seta; immersed/emergent capsule.\n*   ***G. curviseta***: Curved, longer seta; exserted, often nodding capsule.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n1.  **Focus on the Seta:** The primary distinguishing feature is the seta's shape and length. All other differences (like capsule position) are consequences of this.\n2.  **Use the Name as a Hint:** The epithet \"*curviseta*\" literally means \"curved stalk,\" directly pointing to the key feature.\n3.  **Consider Specimen Condition:** The curvature of the seta in *G. curviseta* is most pronounced when the sporophyte is moist. When dry, it can straighten somewhat, but a distinct bend or arc is usually still visible.\n4.  **Observe Capsule Position:** The position of the capsule relative to the leaves (immersed vs. exserted) is an excellent proxy for observing the seta's characteristics, even if the seta itself is partially hidden.\n5.  **Visualizing the Difference:** Imagine one moss with its spore capsules sitting upright and tucked into the plant, and the other with its capsules held out on little curved \"shepherd's crooks.\" This is the \"at a glance\" difference.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe main difference in the sporophyte that distinguishes *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the seta. *G. montana* has a short, straight seta that results in an immersed capsule, while *G. curviseta* has a prominent, curved (cygneous or arcuate) seta that holds the capsule well above the leaves.\n\n<<<The main difference is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, making the capsule appear immersed within the leaves. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is longer and distinctly curved or S-shaped (cygneous), causing the capsule to be exserted and hang to the side."
