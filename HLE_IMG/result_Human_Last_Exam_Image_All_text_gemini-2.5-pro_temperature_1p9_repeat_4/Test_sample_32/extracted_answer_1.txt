The main difference is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, making the capsule appear immersed within the leaves. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is longer and distinctly curved or S-shaped (cygneous), causing the capsule to be exserted and hang to the side.
