    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the structure in the image.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The request asks to identify a \"square ancient structure\" shown in an aerial image, determine if it is a historic landmark, and provides specific geographic coordinates (29° 06' 18.75''N, 103° 47' 50.28''W). The term \"ancient\" may be relative; the structure could be from any past era.\n\n2.  **Locate the Structure in the Image:**\n    *   The provided image is an aerial or satellite view of a desert-like landscape. A paved road runs diagonally across the bottom right, with several dirt tracks also visible.\n    *   In the upper portion of the image, to the right of the center, a distinct square-shaped outline is visible on the ground. This appears to be the foundation or ruins of a building. It is surrounded by sparse vegetation.\n\n3.  **Use the Geographic Coordinates:**\n    *   Inputting the coordinates 29° 06' 18.75''N, 103° 47' 50.28''W into a mapping service (like Google Maps or Google Earth) pinpoints the exact location.\n    *   The location is in a remote area of Brewster County, Texas, USA, south of the city of Alpine and west of Big Bend National Park.\n    *   The major road visible in the image is Texas State Highway 118.\n    *   The satellite view on mapping services confirms that the square ruin in the image is at these precise coordinates.\n\n4.  **Research the Location and Structure:**\n    *   Searching for information about this specific location reveals that it is a known site.\n    *   The structure is the ruins of the **Pratt Lodge**, also sometimes referred to as the Gage Holland-Pratt Lodge.\n    *   It is not an \"ancient\" structure in the archaeological sense but a 20th-century ruin. It was built by Wallace E. Pratt, a highly influential petroleum geologist who worked for Humble Oil (which later became Exxon). Pratt was known for his love of the geology of West Texas and New Mexico.\n    *   The lodge was built as a stone residence for his family but is now in ruins, with only the foundation and parts of the lower stone walls remaining.\n\n5.  **Determine its Landmark Status:**\n    *   The site has clear historical significance due to its connection to Wallace E. Pratt, a key figure in the history of petroleum geology. It is a point of interest for tourists and photographers exploring the Big Bend region.\n    *   While Wallace Pratt's other home (Pratt Cabin in McKittrick Canyon, now part of Guadalupe Mountains National Park) is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, this specific Pratt Lodge ruin near Highway 118 does not appear to hold a similar official designation as a state or national historic landmark.\n    *   Therefore, it can be accurately described as a **historic ruin** and a **site of local historical interest**, but it is not an officially designated historic landmark.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe structure shown in the image is not ancient, but the 20th-century ruins of a stone building. It is a known historical site but lacks official landmark designation.\n\n***\n\nThe square structure shown in the image at the given coordinates is the **ruins of the Pratt Lodge**.\n\nIt is a **historic site** but not an officially designated historic landmark. It was built in the mid-20th century by Wallace E. Pratt, a prominent petroleum geologist. Today, only the stone foundations and some low walls of the lodge remain."
