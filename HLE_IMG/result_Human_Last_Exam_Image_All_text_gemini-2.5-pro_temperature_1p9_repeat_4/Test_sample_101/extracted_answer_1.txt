The structure of compound A is 2-((cyano)(phenylamino)methyl)pyridin-3-ol. The reaction is a Strecker synthesis variant. First, 3-hydroxy-pyridine-2-carbaldehyde reacts with aniline to form an imine. In the second step, cyanide (from NaCN) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the imine carbon. The presence of TFE helps to protonate the imine nitrogen, activating it for the nucleophilic attack. The final product is an Î±-aminonitrile. The structure is a pyridine ring with a hydroxyl group at position 3, and a `CH(CN)(NHPh)` group at position 2.
The final structure is as follows:
