    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation**\nThe image features an insect perched on a yellow flower. The insect is the central focus. The background consists of more yellow flowers and green foliage, which are out of focus. The insect itself is relatively small, with a distinct color pattern.\n\n**Step 2: Detailed Examination of the Insect's Morphology**\n*   **Order:** The insect has the general appearance of a true bug (Order Hemiptera). This is suggested by its body shape, long segmented antennae, and the structure of its wings (partially hardened, partially membranous, though not perfectly clear in this view).\n*   **Coloration:** The insect exhibits a striking pattern of black and bright red-orange. This type of coloration is often aposematic, meaning it serves as a warning to potential predators.\n*   **Specific Markings:**\n    *   **Head:** The head is predominantly black, with large, reddish eyes and some orange markings around the edge and potentially behind the eyes.\n    *   **Thorax:** The section just behind the head (the pronotum) is black with distinct red-orange borders and possibly a central line, though the angle makes it slightly difficult to see all three lines clearly.\n    *   **Wings (Hemelytra):** The wings are mostly black, but their outer edges are sharply defined by a red-orange line.\n    *   **Legs and Antennae:** These appear to be black.\n\n**Step 3: Identification based on Key Features**\nThe combination of these features—the black and red-orange coloration, the specific pattern of red-orange lines on the thorax and wings—is highly characteristic of the **Boxelder Bug**.\n\n**Step 4: Confirming the Identification**\n*   The name \"Boxelder Bug\" commonly refers to the species *Boisea trivittata*.\n*   The species name *trivittata* literally means \"three-striped,\" which refers to the three red longitudinal stripes on the pronotum (one on each side and one in the center). The markings on the insect in the photo are consistent with this description.\n*   Boxelder bugs are often found congregating on various plants, especially in sunny spots during the late summer and fall, which aligns with the image setting on a flowering plant (likely goldenrod, a common late-summer bloomer).\n\n**Step 5: Providing the Scientific Name**\nBased on the comprehensive visual evidence, the insect is identified as a Boxelder Bug. The scientific name for this species is *Boisea trivittata*.\n\n<<<Boisea trivittata>>>"
