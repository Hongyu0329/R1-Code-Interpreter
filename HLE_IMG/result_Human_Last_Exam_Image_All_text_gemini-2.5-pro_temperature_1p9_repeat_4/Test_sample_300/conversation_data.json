    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each artwork to determine its author.\n\n**Artwork 1 (Top Left):**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Chinese ink and color painting on paper depicting women from an ethnic minority, likely Yi or another group from Southwest China, at a market or festival. The style combines realistic figure depiction with expressive brushwork, characteristic of modern Chinese figure painting. The brushwork, color palette, and theme are hallmarks of the artist **Shi Guoliang (史国良)**, who is famous for his works portraying the lives of Chinese ethnic minorities.\n*   **Author:** Shi Guoliang\n\n**Artwork 2 (Top Middle):**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a black and white ink sketch of a landscape, featuring stylized buildings and trees. The artist uses abstract lines and forms to capture the essence of the scenery rather than its literal appearance. This approach, blending traditional Chinese ink with Western modernist abstraction, is the signature style of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**.\n*   **Author:** Wu Guanzhong\n\n**Artwork 3 (Top Right):**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in a powerful and uninhibited cursive script (草書, cǎoshū). The visible characters \"江山如此多娇\" (jiāngshān rúcǐ duō jiāo) are the famous opening lines of the poem \"Qinyuan Chun · Snow\" (沁园春·雪). Both the highly recognizable calligraphic style and the content of the poem identify the author as **Mao Zedong (毛泽东)**.\n*   **Author:** Mao Zedong\n\n**Artwork 4 (Middle Left):**\n*   **Analysis:** This is another work of Chinese calligraphy. The style is elegant, with a unique structure that is slender yet strong and fluid. This distinctive and widely influential calligraphic style is known as the \"Qi style\" (启体), created by the renowned 20th-century calligrapher, painter, and scholar **Qi Gong (启功)**.\n*   **Author:** Qi Gong\n\n**Artwork 5 (Center):**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a highly realistic oil painting of a young woman in a white shirt, holding a paintbrush and sketchbook. She stands before a larger painting that evokes traditional Chinese mural art. This masterpiece of Chinese contemporary realism, known for its soft lighting and delicate rendering, is one of the most famous works by **Chen Yifei (陈逸飞)**, titled \"Youth\" (《青年女歌手》).\n*   **Author:** Chen Yifei\n\n**Artwork 6 (Middle Right):**\n*   **Analysis:** This painting shows a woman with an elaborate headdress, her face rendered in a stylized manner with long features and dark outlines. The background is composed of leaves and birds, blending into the figure. This distinctive style, which synthesizes elements of Western Fauvism and Cubism with Chinese ink painting techniques, is the unmistakable work of **Lin Fengmian (林风眠)**, a pioneer of modern Chinese painting.\n*   **Author:** Lin Fengmian\n\n**Artwork 7 (Bottom Left):**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a colorful and lively painting depicting a village scene with hanging luffa gourds, laundry on a line, and a chicken in a basket. The use of vibrant colors, strong lines, and a composition that verges on abstract design, while capturing the spirit of rural life, is a signature style of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)** during his later career.\n*   **Author:** Wu Guanzhong\n\n**Artwork 8 (Bottom Middle):**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Chinese landscape painting (山水画, shān shuǐ huà) of a dramatic river gorge scene. It is characterized by the use of dense, layered ink (积墨, jī mò) to build up the monumental forms of the mountains, creating a powerful sense of weight and texture. This technique, along with the common motif of red-sailed boats adding a touch of color to the dark landscape, is a hallmark of **Li Keran (李可染)**.\n*   **Author:** Li Keran\n\n**Artwork 9 (Bottom Right):**\n*   **Analysis:** This painting depicts a lobster (or spiny lobster) created with just a few masterful brushstrokes. The ability to capture the form, texture, and vitality of creatures like shrimp, crabs, and insects with such simplicity and energy is the most celebrated skill of **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**. This is a classic example of his work.\n*   **Author:** Qi Baishi\n\n---\n**Final Answer (from left to right, top to bottom):**\n1.  Shi Guoliang\n2.  Wu Guanzhong\n3.  Mao Zedong\n4.  Qi Gong\n5.  Chen Yifei\n6.  Lin Fengmian\n7.  Wu Guanzhong\n8.  Li Keran\n9.  Qi Baishi\n\n<<<Shi Guoliang, Wu Guanzhong, Mao Zedong, Qi Gong, Chen Yifei, Lin Fengmian, Wu Guanzhong, Li Keran, Qi Baishi>>>"
