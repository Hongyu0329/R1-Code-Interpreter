    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the scene.**\n    The image is from an Ancient Greek red-figure vase. It depicts a chaotic scene centered around a chariot. We can see:\n    *   A nude male figure falling backward out of the chariot, his body contorted. He appears to be dead or dying.\n    *   Two figures remain in the chariot. One is the driver, holding the reins and a goad, wearing a decorated tunic and a Phrygian cap (a soft, conical cap associated with eastern peoples like the Phrygians or Trojans in Greek art). The other figure is heavily draped in cloth.\n    *   A winged figure, possibly Eros (the god of love) or Nike (the goddess of victory), hovers above the chariot.\n    *   The hindquarters of a white horse, suggesting the chariot is in motion.\n    *   Decorative patterns typical of Greek pottery, including a wave pattern at the bottom and palmettes on the side.\n\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the central action.**\n    The most dramatic action is the man falling from the chariot. The question \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\" most likely refers to this individual, who is being violently ejected. This is not a calm departure but a fatal accident or the result of a battle.\n\n*   **Step 3: Connect the scene to Greek mythology.**\n    A fatal chariot crash is a specific and famous story in Greek mythology. The myth that best fits this depiction is the death of Hippolytus.\n\n*   **Step 4: Recount the myth of Hippolytus.**\n    Hippolytus was the son of Theseus, king of Athens. He was a devout follower of Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, and lived a chaste life, scorning Aphrodite, the goddess of love. To punish him for this slight, Aphrodite caused his stepmother, Phaedra, to fall desperately in love with him. When Hippolytus rejected her, Phaedra killed herself, leaving a note falsely accusing him of attacking her. Enraged, Theseus used one of three curses he had received from his father, the sea god Poseidon, to bring about his son's death. As Hippolytus drove his chariot along the seashore, Poseidon sent a monstrous bull from the waves. The horses, terrified, bolted and overturned the chariot. Hippolytus became entangled in the reins and was dragged to his death.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the identification.**\n    The scene on the vase aligns perfectly with the death of Hippolytus. The falling nude male is Hippolytus, suffering his fatal chariot crash. The winged figure could be Eros, representing the power of Aphrodite who engineered the tragedy. The driver in the Phrygian cap might be a groom or a personification of the madness (Mania) that seized the horses. Therefore, the figure leaving the chariot is Hippolytus.\n\n<<<Hippolytus>>>"
