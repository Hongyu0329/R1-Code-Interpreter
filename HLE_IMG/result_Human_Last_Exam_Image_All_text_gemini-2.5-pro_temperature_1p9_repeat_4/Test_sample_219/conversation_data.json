    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the graph**\nThe provided image is a raster plot.\n*   The **y-axis** represents 128 different electrodes, each recording the electrical activity of neurons.\n*   The **x-axis** represents time in seconds (s).\n*   Each black dot on the plot represents a neuronal firing, or \"spike,\" detected by a specific electrode at a specific time.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the synchronized bursts**\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a period where many neurons (and thus, many electrodes) fire spikes in a short time window. Visually, these appear as dense vertical bands of black dots across a large number of electrodes.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must distinguish these major, network-wide events from smaller, less synchronized periods of activity. The prominent vertical columns are the synchronized bursts of interest.\n\n**Step 3: Estimate the timestamps of each synchronized burst**\nWe need to read the time on the x-axis for each burst. We can define the timestamp of a burst by its approximate starting time.\n*   **Burst 1:** The first dense vertical band starts at approximately **t₁ = 2 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The second dense vertical band starts at approximately **t₂ = 13 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** The third dense vertical band starts at approximately **t₃ = 24 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** The fourth dense vertical band starts at approximately **t₄ = 36 s**.\n*   **Burst 5:** The fifth dense vertical band starts at approximately **t₅ = 48 s**.\n*   **Careful Point:** The exact edge of a burst can be slightly ambiguous. However, the firing pattern is quite periodic, which gives confidence in these estimates. Using the start time is a consistent method for all bursts.\n\nThe timestamps of the synchronized bursts are approximately: **2 s, 13 s, 24 s, 36 s, and 48 s.**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time duration between the start of one burst and the start of the next consecutive burst. We have 5 bursts, which means there are 4 intervals between them.\n*   **IBI₁:** Time between Burst 2 and Burst 1 = t₂ - t₁ = 13 s - 2 s = **11 s**.\n*   **IBI₂:** Time between Burst 3 and Burst 2 = t₃ - t₂ = 24 s - 13 s = **11 s**.\n*   **IBI₃:** Time between Burst 4 and Burst 3 = t₄ - t₃ = 36 s - 24 s = **12 s**.\n*   **IBI₄:** Time between Burst 5 and Burst 4 = t₅ - t₄ = 48 s - 36 s = **12 s**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the average inter-burst interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual IBIs and divide by the number of intervals.\n*   Sum of IBIs = 11 s + 11 s + 12 s + 12 s = 46 s.\n*   Number of intervals = 4.\n*   Average IBI = 46 s / 4 = **11.5 s**.\n\n**Step 6: Round the final answer to two significant figures**\nThe question requires the final answer to be reported to two significant figures.\n*   The calculated average is 11.5 s.\n*   To round 11.5 to two significant figures, we look at the third digit. Since it is 5, we round up the second digit.\n*   Therefore, 11.5 s rounded to two significant figures is **12 s**.\n\n<<<12>>>"
