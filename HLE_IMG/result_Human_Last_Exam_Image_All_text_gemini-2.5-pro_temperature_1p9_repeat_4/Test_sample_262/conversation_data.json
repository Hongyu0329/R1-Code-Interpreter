    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question.**\nThe question asks to identify which of the four iridium complexes, used as emitters in Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs), would exhibit shorter operational lifetimes. Shorter lifetime in this context refers to faster degradation of the emitter molecule under operating conditions, leading to a decrease in device performance over time.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of the complexes.**\nAll four complexes are cationic Iridium(III) complexes with the general formula [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+[PF6]−.\n*   **Metal Center:** All have an Iridium(III) (Ir) center.\n*   **Ancillary Ligand (N^N):** All four complexes use the same ancillary ligand: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. Since this component is identical across all four complexes, it will not be the primary factor determining the difference in their lifetimes. The bulky tert-butyl groups primarily enhance solubility and film-forming properties.\n*   **Cyclometalating Ligands (C^N):** The key difference between the complexes lies in the cyclometalating 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligands. Specifically, the phenyl ring of the ppy ligand is substituted with a varying number of fluorine (F) atoms.\n    *   **Complex 1:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has **two** fluorine atoms per ligand.\n    *   **Complex 2:** The C^N ligand is 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has **one** fluorine atom per ligand.\n    *   **Complex 3:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has **one** fluorine atom per ligand.\n    *   **Complex 4:** The C^N ligand is a trifluorinated phenylpyridine (e.g., 2-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)pyridine). It has **three** fluorine atoms per ligand.\n*   **Counter-ion:** All use the hexafluorophosphate (PF6−) anion, which is a stable, non-coordinating anion. This is also not a differentiating factor.\n\n**Step 3: Relate molecular structure to stability and device lifetime.**\nThe operational stability (and thus lifetime) of these iridium complexes is strongly linked to the strength of the bonds within the molecule, particularly the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond of the cyclometalating ligand. This bond is often the weakest point and its cleavage is a major pathway for molecular degradation.\n\n*   **The Role of Fluorination:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative element. When attached to the phenyl ring of the C^N ligand, its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect strengthens the adjacent chemical bonds, including the critical Ir-C bond.\n*   **Principle:** A stronger Ir-C bond leads to a more robust and chemically stable complex. A more stable complex degrades more slowly under the electrical and thermal stress of device operation, resulting in a longer device lifetime.\n*   **Conclusion from Principle:** The stability of the complexes, and therefore their operational lifetimes, is expected to increase with the degree of fluorination on the cyclometalating ligand.\n\n**Step 4: Rank the complexes based on expected lifetime.**\nWe can rank the complexes from shortest to longest expected lifetime based on the number of fluorine atoms on each C^N ligand.\n*   **Lowest degree of fluorination:** Complexes 2 and 3 each have only **one** fluorine atom per C^N ligand. They are expected to have the weakest Ir-C bonds among the four and thus be the least stable.\n*   **Intermediate degree of fluorination:** Complex 1 has **two** fluorine atoms per C^N ligand. It is expected to be more stable than complexes 2 and 3.\n*   **Highest degree of fluorination:** Complex 4 has **three** fluorine atoms per C^N ligand. It is expected to be the most stable and have the longest lifetime.\n\nTherefore, the stability order is: Complex 4 > Complex 1 > Complex 2 & 3.\nThe order of lifetime is: Lifetime(4) > Lifetime(1) > Lifetime(2) & Lifetime(3).\n\n**Step 5: Identify the complexes with shorter lifetimes.**\nThe question asks for the complexes with shorter lifetimes. Based on our analysis, the least stable complexes are those with the lowest number of stabilizing fluorine groups. Both Complex 2 and Complex 3 fit this description, each having only one fluorine atom per cyclometalating ligand. Thus, they are expected to show the shortest lifetimes.\n\n**Step 6: Select the correct answer.**\nThe correct option is the one that lists both Complex 2 and Complex 3.\n\n<<<H>>>"
