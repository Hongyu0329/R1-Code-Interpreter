    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Image**\nThe image provided is an **emission spectrum**. This type of spectrum is generated when a gas is excited (for example, by passing an electric current through it), causing its atoms to emit light. The emitted light, when passed through a prism or diffraction grating, splits into a series of bright lines of specific colors. Each chemical element has a unique emission spectrum that acts as its \"fingerprint.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Spectral Features**\nWe need to carefully observe the pattern of the linesâ€”their colors (which correspond to wavelengths), their positions, their relative spacing, and their intensities (brightness).\n*   **Red Region (Right Side):** There is a very prominent, bright red line, along with a few other fainter red lines.\n*   **Yellow-Orange Region:** There is a distinct and very bright yellow line. This is a major characteristic feature.\n*   **Green-Cyan Region (Middle):** There are several lines in this region, including a prominent bright green line and a noticeable cyan (blue-green) line.\n*   **Blue-Violet Region (Left Side):** There are multiple lines in the blue and violet part of the spectrum. They appear more numerous and closer together than the lines in the red-yellow region.\n\n**Step 3: Compare with Known Elemental Spectra**\nNow, let's compare these observed features with the known spectra of some common elements.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** The visible spectrum of hydrogen (the Balmer series) is relatively simple, consisting of one strong red line (H-alpha), one cyan line (H-beta), and a couple of violet lines (H-gamma, H-delta). The spectrum in the image is much more complex, with many more lines, especially in the green and yellow regions. Therefore, it is not hydrogen.\n*   **Sodium (Na):** Sodium is famous for its incredibly bright, dominant doublet (two lines very close together) in the yellow part of the spectrum. While the image shows a yellow line, it also shows many other strong lines across the spectrum. A pure sodium spectrum would be overwhelmingly dominated by the yellow line. So, this is unlikely to be sodium.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** Neon signs glow with a characteristic red-orange color because its emission spectrum is heavily dominated by a large number of bright lines in the red, orange, and yellow parts of the spectrum. The spectrum in the image shows strong lines across the entire visible range, including prominent green, blue, and violet lines. This is not consistent with neon.\n*   **Helium (He):** Helium has a distinct and well-known spectrum. Its key features include:\n    *   A strong red line (~668 nm)\n    *   A very strong yellow line (~588 nm)\n    *   Several bright lines in the green and cyan regions (~502 nm, ~492 nm)\n    *   Several prominent blue and violet lines (~471 nm, ~447 nm)\nThis pattern perfectly matches the features we identified in the provided image: a strong red line, a very bright yellow line, multiple green/cyan lines, and a series of blue/violet lines.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe pattern of spectral lines in the image, characterized by a specific combination of prominent red, yellow, green, and blue-violet lines, is the unique fingerprint of the element Helium.\n\n<<<Helium>>>"
