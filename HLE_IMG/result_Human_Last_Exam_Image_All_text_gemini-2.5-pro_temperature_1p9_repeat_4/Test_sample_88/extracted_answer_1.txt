Product A: A tricyclic cycloadduct formed from the [3+2] reaction between the azomethine ylide of the starting material and methyl propiolate, which has been further functionalized by acetylation of the pyrroline substituent after tautomerization. Its molecular formula is C14H20N2O3.
Product B: An aromatic heterocyclic compound derived from the initial cycloadduct via oxidative aromatization (loss of 4 hydrogens and gain of 1 oxygen). Its molecular formula is C12H14N2O3.
Product C: The mixed anhydride formed from the reaction between the carboxylic acid group of the starting material and acetic anhydride. Its molecular formula is C11H16N2O3. A representative SMILES is `CC(=O)OC(=O)C1CCN(C2=NCCC2)C1`.
