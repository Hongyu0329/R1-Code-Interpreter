    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual information.** The image presents two plots, one above the other.\n    *   The top plot appears to be a spectrogram, which shows the intensity of different frequencies over time (time is on the horizontal axis, frequency on the vertical). We see a strong, stable horizontal line, representing a pure tone of a single frequency. This continuous tone is briefly interrupted by a vertical smear, which represents a short burst of sound containing a wide range of frequencies (i.e., noise). The horizontal line for the pure tone appears to continue *through* the noise burst, even though it's obscured.\n    *   The bottom plot is a waveform, which shows the amplitude of the sound signal over time. On the left, we see a clean, regular sine wave, corresponding to the pure tone. In the middle section, this regular pattern is replaced by a complex, irregular waveform, corresponding to the noise. After the noisy section, the clean sine wave pattern resumes. This representation shows that the tone is physically absent during the noise burst; it is *replaced* by the noise.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the textual information and connect it to the visuals.**\n    *   The question describes an \"illusion\" where the perception does not match the physical reality shown in the waveform. The illusion is that we perceive the tone as continuous.\n    *   It is compared to the \"Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity.\" The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where a 2D drawing of a cube can be perceived in two different 3D orientations. The brain switches between these two stable interpretations. This comparison suggests the phenomenon in question involves the brain actively interpreting incomplete or ambiguous sensory data to form a coherent perception.\n    *   It's described as a \"common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability.\" This implies it's something our brains do automatically in everyday life, for example, helping us understand speech in a noisy room by \"filling in\" parts of words that are obscured by other sounds.\n\n*   **Step 3: Synthesize the analysis to identify the phenomenon.**\n    *   The situation described is a classic psychoacoustic experiment. When a sound (like a tone) is interrupted by a brief, loud-enough burst of noise, listeners perceive the original sound as continuing uninterrupted \"behind\" the noise. The brain infers that the tone was likely continuous and was simply masked by the louder noise, so it perceptually \"restores\" the missing segment.\n    *   This effect is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion** or sometimes temporal induction. A famous specific example of this with speech sounds is the phonemic restoration effect. Given the visual representation of a pure tone, the most accurate general name is the Auditory Continuity Illusion.\n\n*   **Step 4: Final Conclusion.** The phenomenon where a sound that is physically interrupted by another sound (typically noise) is perceived as continuous is called the Auditory Continuity Illusion. This matches all the clues provided in the image and the text.\n\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion>>>"
