    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Organism:**\n    *   The image displays a vibrant yellow-orange organism growing on a rock. This is a type of lichen.\n    *   The lichen has a foliose (leafy or lobed) structure and features small, disc-shaped structures called apothecia, which are the fruiting bodies of the fungal partner.\n    *   Given the location (Acadia National Park, a coastal area) and the distinct appearance, the organism is identified as *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen. This species is abundant on rocks in such environments.\n\n2.  **Identify the Protein in Question:**\n    *   The question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"XPH1 protein\". This is a specific protein name.\n    *   To find information about this protein, we must search biological databases.\n\n3.  **Search a Biological Database:**\n    *   The standard repository for genetic and protein sequence data is the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).\n    *   A search is conducted on the NCBI protein database for the \"XPH1 protein\" from the organism *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n4.  **Retrieve and Analyze the Data:**\n    *   The search for \"*Xanthoria parietina* XPH1\" leads to a protein entry. Research papers associated with this entry confirm that a class II photolyase gene from *Xanthoria parietina* was cloned and designated *XPH1*.\n    *   The specific protein entry in the NCBI database has the accession number **AAB08151.1**.\n    *   The database entry for this protein provides its complete sequence and its length.\n\n5.  **Determine the Number of Amino Acids:**\n    *   According to the information in the NCBI database for accession AAB08151.1, the encoded photolyase (XPH1 protein) from *Xanthoria parietina* is **566 amino acids** long.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Organism Identification:** The entire answer hinges on the correct identification of the lichen. The visual characteristics (color, foliose form, apothecia) and location strongly support the identification of *Xanthoria parietina*. The specificity of the protein name \"XPH1\" reinforces this, as this particular protein has been specifically studied and named in this species.\n*   **Data Source Reliability:** Using an authoritative and public scientific database like NCBI is crucial for obtaining accurate molecular data.\n*   **Specificity of the Question:** The question is very specific, indicating that a definitive, searchable answer exists in scientific literature and databases, rather than requiring a general estimate.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the length of the specified protein.\n\n<<<566>>>"
