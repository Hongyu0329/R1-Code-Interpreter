    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to identify the opera.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Instrumentation and Language**\n*   The instrument list on the left is in German: `gr. Fl.` (große Flöten/flutes), `Hob.` (Oboe/oboe), `engl. Horn` (English Horn), `Fag.` (Fagott/bassoon), `Viol.` (Violinen/violins), `Br.` (Bratsche/viola), `Celli`.\n*   The use of a large orchestra, including an English Horn and divided strings (`1. Pult`, `2. Pult`, `Solo Br.`, `die übrigen`), points towards the late Romantic or early 20th-century repertoire.\n*   Other instructions are also in German: `mit Dämpfer` (\"with mute\") and `Vorhang` (\"curtain\").\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Musical Content and Instructions**\n*   **Key Instruction:** The text `1 (Vorhang)` above the first violin staff is a crucial clue. It indicates that the main curtain rises at this point, which aligns with the question stating this is the opening of the second act.\n*   **Harmony and Tonality:** The music lacks a traditional key signature and is highly chromatic. The harmony is complex, tense, and shifting, a hallmark of late Romantic German opera, particularly the works of Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss.\n*   **Melody and Motifs:** The most distinctive melodic line begins in the `I. Viol. / 1. Pult` part right at the `Vorhang` marking. This rising, yearning figure (F#-G#-A#-B-C#) is a very famous musical motif.\n*   **Orchestral Texture:** The texture is rich and detailed. Note the use of muted strings (`mit Dämpfer`) to create a soft, shimmering, and mysterious sound. There is a prominent solo viola (`Solo Br.`) part. Towards the end of the excerpt, there are `gliss.` (glissando) markings in the strings, adding to the lush, sweeping effect.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Opera**\n*   The combination of the German language, late-Romantic chromatic style, specific orchestral colors (muted strings, English horn), and the famous rising melodic motif points strongly to Richard Wagner.\n*   The specific motif in the first violins is known as the \"Sehnsuchtsmotiv\" (Yearning or Desire motif) from Wagner's opera **Tristan und Isolde**.\n*   This exact musical passage occurs at the very beginning of Act II. The act starts with a fiery orchestral prelude, and at the measure marked `(Vorhang)`, the curtain rises to reveal Isolde in a garden at night, impatiently waiting for Tristan. The music perfectly depicts the shimmering moonlight and her intense longing.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the highly characteristic chromatic style, the German text, the specific instrumentation, and the identifiable \"Sehnsuchtsmotiv,\" the piece of music is the beginning of Act II of Richard Wagner's opera, *Tristan und Isolde*.\n\n<<<Tristan und Isolde>>>"
