Yes, there is evidence of insect activity. The white, fuzzy object on the twig is a "wool sower gall," which is created by a cynipid wasp. The female wasp laid her eggs into the tissue of the twig, and this gall formed around the developing larvae to provide food and shelter. Therefore, the eggs were laid inside the twig, and the resulting larvae are developing within the gall.
