    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chemical structure and chiral centers.**\nFirst, we need to correctly interpret the chemical structure from the provided image. The drawing represents a molecule with a carbon backbone. Following standard organic chemistry drawing conventions, the zig-zag line represents the main carbon chain, and wedges/dashes indicate stereochemistry.\n\nLet's transcribe the structure and find the longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional group. The molecule contains a hydroxyl (-OH) group and an amino (-NH2) group. According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the alcohol (-OH) has higher priority than the amine (-NH2). Therefore, the molecule is named as an alcohol.\n\nThe longest carbon chain containing the carbon bonded to the -OH group is a pentane chain. We number the chain starting from the end that gives the -OH group the lowest possible number. This means we number from left to right.\n\n*   `CH3(1) - CH(2)(OH) - CH(3)(Et) - CH(4)(Me) - CH2(5)NH2`\n\nThe IUPAC name is **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**.\n\nThe chiral centers are the carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. In this molecule, the chiral centers are at positions C2, C3, and C4.\n*   **C2**: Bonded to -H, -OH, -CH3 (C1), and the rest of the chain (-C3...).\n*   **C3**: Bonded to -H, -CH2CH3 (ethyl), -C2 group, and -C4 group.\n*   **C4**: Bonded to -H, -CH3, -CH2NH2, and the -C3 group.\n\n**Step 2: Assign priorities to the substituents on each chiral center using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.**\n\n*   **At C2:**\n    1.  -OH (highest atomic number O=8)\n    2.  -C3 (C bonded to C, C, H)\n    3.  -CH3 (C1) (C bonded to H, H, H)\n    4.  -H (lowest atomic number)\n\n*   **At C3:**\n    1.  -CH(OH)CH3 (the C2 group; C bonded to O, C, H)\n    2.  -CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (the C4 group; C bonded to C, C, H) -> a tie initially. We must go further. C4 group path: -C-C-N. C2 group path: -C-O. Oxygen (8) beats Carbon (6). So C2 group is priority 1. Now comparing C4 group and Ethyl group.\n    3.  C4 group is -C(C,C,H). Ethyl group is -CH2CH3, which is -C(C,H,H). So C4 group > Ethyl group.\n        Priorities: 1: `-CH(OH)CH3` (C2 group), 2: `-CH(CH3)CH2NH2` (C4 group), 3: `-CH2CH3` (Ethyl), 4: `-H`\n\n*   **At C4:**\n    1.  -CH2NH2 (C is bonded to N, H, H). N (atomic number 7) beats C (6).\n    2.  -CH(Et)CH(OH)CH3 (the C3 group; C is bonded to C, C, H).\n    3.  -CH3 (C is bonded to H, H, H).\n    4.  -H\n\n**Step 3: Determine the R/S configuration for each chiral center.**\n\n*   **Configuration at C2:**\n    *   The structure shows the -OH group (priority 1) on a dash (away) and implies the -H (priority 4) is on a wedge (toward you).\n    *   With the lowest priority group (4) pointing toward the viewer, we determine the direction from 1 -> 2 -> 3 and reverse the result.\n    *   The path from -OH (1, back) -> C3-group (2, up-left in plane) -> -CH3 (3, down-left in plane) is clockwise (R).\n    *   Since H is pointing forward, we reverse the assignment from R to S. **Wait, let's use the swap rule to be certain.**\n    *   Swap H(4, wedge) and OH(1, dash). Now H is on a dash.\n    *   In the new arrangement, OH(1) is on a wedge. The sequence 1(wedge) -> 2(plane) -> 3(plane) is counter-clockwise (S).\n    *   Since we made one swap, the original configuration is the opposite. Thus, C2 is **R**.\n\n*   **Configuration at C3:**\n    *   The structure shows the ethyl group (priority 3) on a wedge (toward you) and implies the -H (priority 4) is on a dash (away).\n    *   This is the ideal orientation for assignment, with the lowest priority group in the back.\n    *   We trace the path from 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   The path from the C2-group (1, up-left) -> C4-group (2, down-right) -> ethyl group (3, front) is counter-clockwise.\n    *   Therefore, C3 is **S**.\n\n*   **Configuration at C4:**\n    *   The structure shows the -CH2NH2 group (priority 1) on a wedge, the -CH3 group (priority 3) on a dash, and the -H (priority 4) in the plane of the drawing.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (H) is in the plane, we can use the swap rule. Let's swap the position of H (4, plane) and -CH3 (3, dash).\n    *   Now, H is in the back (on a dash), which is the correct viewing position.\n    *   The substituents in the new (swapped) arrangement are: -CH2NH2 (1, wedge), C3-group (2, plane), and -CH3 (3, plane).\n    *   The path from 1 -> 2 -> 3 is clockwise (front -> left -> down). This configuration is R.\n    *   Since this is the configuration of the swapped molecule, the original configuration is the opposite. Thus, C4 is **S**.\n\n**Summary of Absolute Configurations:**\n*   C2 is R\n*   C3 is S\n*   C4 is S\n\nThe absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3S, 4S).\n\n<<<2R, 3S, 4S>>>"
