    "*   **Step 1: Initial Observation of the Artifact.**\n    The image displays a metallic, circular object, which appears to be a medallion or a phalera (a decorative disc worn as part of military or ceremonial attire). It has a tab at the top for attachment. The main decoration consists of two busts shown frontally.\n\n*   **Step 2: Iconographic Analysis.**\n    The two figures are male. The figure on the left is more clearly defined and wears a distinctive headdress featuring prominent, curled ram's horns. The figures have large, wide-open eyes staring forward, and their hair and features are rendered in a stylized manner. This artistic style is not typical of classical Greek or Roman naturalism. The horned headdress is a significant clue, often symbolizing divinity, power, or royalty in ancient Near Eastern cultures.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identification of Cultural Origin and Style.**\n    The specific style—strong frontality, large staring eyes, and the type of headdress—are characteristic features of Sasanian art. The Sasanian Empire ruled Persia (modern Iran) and surrounding territories from 224 to 651 A.D. The headdress with ram's horns is found on representations of Sasanian princes and dignitaries, symbolizing royal glory or *khvarenah*.\n\n*   **Step 4: Chronological Placement within the Sasanian Period.**\n    Art historians and archaeologists date Sasanian artifacts by comparing their style and iconography (especially royal crowns) with datable objects like coins and rock reliefs. The particular style of this phalera—its rigid frontality and the specific rendering of the facial features—is most closely associated with the middle Sasanian period. Experts in Sasanian metalwork, after comparing it to numerous other silver and gold objects, place this piece firmly within the 4th century A.D. This corresponds to a period of great power for the Sasanian Empire, particularly under the long reign of King Shapur II (r. 309–379 A.D.). This specific artifact is a well-known Sasanian phalera held in the Antikensammlung, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin.\n\n*   **Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\n    Based on the consensus of archaeological and art-historical analysis of its Sasanian style and iconography, the medallion is dated to the 4th century A.D.\n\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
