    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the sheet music.**\n    *   The music is written on a standard five-line staff with a treble clef.\n    *   The time signature is 4/4.\n    *   The key signature has no sharps or flats, indicating the key of C Major or A minor.\n    *   There are chord symbols written above the staff, such as C, E7, F, G7, C-, D-, A-. This format, known as a \"lead sheet,\" is common in jazz, pop, and other forms of popular music.\n    *   The rhythm is syncopated, featuring many eighth and sixteenth notes, as well as ties and rests, which gives it a rhythmic, \"swing\" feel.\n    *   There are structural markings like \"D.S. al Coda\" (indicated by the segno symbol ùÑã and the instruction \"To go out take D.S. to CODA\") and a \"CODA\" section. This structure is common in popular song forms.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the melody and harmony.**\n    *   The first full measure begins with the notes C, E, F, G.\n    *   The subsequent measure has the notes A, G, E, F.\n    *   The underlying chord progression in the first four bars is C | C | E7 | E7 | F... This is a very recognizable progression.\n    *   Combining the melody and the chord progression is the most effective way to identify the piece.\n\n*   **Step 3: Search and identify the song.**\n    *   A search for songs with the melodic sequence C-E-F-G-A-G-E-F and a chord progression starting with C to E7 to F quickly identifies the song as \"La Vie en Rose\". Comparing the sheet music in the image to known lead sheets for \"La Vie en Rose\" confirms the match in both melody and harmony.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the song's attributes.**\n    *   **Title:** The song is \"La Vie en Rose\".\n    *   **Musical Style:** The song's original genre is **Chanson**, a style of lyric-driven song from France. Due to its popularity and harmonic structure, it has been widely adopted by jazz musicians and is frequently performed as a **jazz ballad** or in a **swing** style. Both \"Chanson\" and \"jazz\" are appropriate descriptors.\n    *   **Country of Origin:** \"La Vie en Rose\" was written in 1945. The lyrics were written by French singer √âdith Piaf, and the music was composed by French composer Louiguy. Therefore, the country of origin is **France**.\n\n<<<Title: La Vie en Rose\nMusical Style: Chanson (French ballad), Jazz Standard\nCountry of Origin: France>>>"
