    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Visual and Textual Information from the Advertisement**\n*   **Visual Context:** The image shows a woman in work clothes (overalls, cap) working on a military tank in a factory setting.\n*   **Headline:** \"Women are winning the War - of Freedom\". This explicitly places the advertisement in the context of World War II, celebrating the contribution of women to the war effort on the home front.\n*   **Retailers:** The text at the bottom lists where the product was sold: \"BOOTS, TIMOTHY WHITES & TAYLORS, and other chemists, departmental stores, drapers. WOOLWORTH'S, MARKS & SPENCER LTD. and THE N.A.A.F.I.\" The presence of major chemists (pharmacies) like Boots and department stores like Marks & Spencer strongly suggests the product is in the category of health, beauty, or personal care.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Cues from the Question**\n*   **Time Period:** World War II Britain. This is confirmed by the ad's content.\n*   **Target Audience:** \"new workers,\" specifically the women who entered factories and other traditionally male roles.\n*   **Product's Claim:** It \"helped these workers overcome inherent limitations.\" In the context of the era, this was often framed not as a physical limitation, but a social or psychological one. The 'limitation' was the strain of hard, \"unfeminine\" labor and the risk of losing one's sense of self and femininity. Beauty products were marketed as a tool to maintain morale and personal identity.\n*   **Name Origin:** The product has a \"French-derived name.\"\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Clues to Identify the Product**\n*   The provided image is part of a very well-known and extensive advertising campaign that ran in Britain during WWII. The blank space on the left in the original advertisement would have contained the product's name and descriptive text.\n*   By searching for the phrase \"Women are winning the War advertisement,\" we can find the complete original ad.\n*   The campaign was for the cosmetics brand **Bourjois**, particularly its popular \"Evening in Paris\" (Soir de Paris) line of perfumes, powders, and lipsticks.\n*   Let's check this finding against the clues:\n    *   **WWII Britain / New Workers:** The campaign was aimed directly at women on the home front, linking beauty to the war effort. It fits perfectly.\n    *   **Overcoming Limitations:** The ads' slogan was often \"Beauty is a moral weapon.\" They argued that by using these products, women could maintain their femininity and morale despite the harsh conditions of war work, thus \"overcoming\" the psychological toll and contributing to victory.\n    *   **French-derived Name:** \"Bourjois\" is a French cosmetics house founded in Paris. This perfectly matches the final and most specific clue.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nThe advertisement is for the French cosmetics brand Bourjois.\n\n<<<Bourjois>>>"
