    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the painting:\n\n**Step 1: Visual Analysis of the Image Fragment**\n*   **Subject:** The central object is a large windmill, seemingly of a European, likely Dutch or Danish, design.\n*   **Atmosphere:** The scene is highly dramatic. The sky is dark and turbulent with storm clouds, but there is a contrasting patch of bright blue sky.\n*   **Action:** In the background to the right, a building is on fire, with bright flames and dark smoke billowing upwards. The fire illuminates the surroundings.\n*   **Composition:** The windmill is positioned on a rise, dominating the landscape. Its sails are skeletal, adding to the dramatic and perhaps derelict feel.\n*   **Style:** The brushwork is visible and expressive, not smooth or overly detailed. This painterly style, combined with the dramatic lighting (chiaroscuro) and emotional subject matter, is characteristic of the Romanticism movement in art.\n*   **Time Period:** The question specifies the painting is from the 19th century, which aligns perfectly with the peak of the Romantic movement (roughly 1800-1850).\n\n**Step 2: Forming a Hypothesis and Search Strategy**\n*   Based on the style and subject, the artist is likely a Northern European Romantic painter. The subject matter of a dramatic landscape with a windmill and a storm or fire was popular among artists influenced by the Dutch Golden Age, but with a new Romantic sensibility.\n*   A search query using keywords like \"19th-century romantic painting,\" \"windmill on fire,\" \"stormy sky,\" or \"dramatic windmill landscape\" should be effective.\n\n**Step 3: Identification of the Artist and Artwork**\n*   Image searches and art history knowledge point to the Norwegian artist **Johan Christian Dahl** (often abbreviated as J.C. Dahl). He is considered a key figure in Norwegian Romantic nationalism and a father of Norwegian landscape painting.\n*   Dahl created several versions of this exact scene. The composition—featuring the windmill, the stormy sky with a break of blue, and the fire in the background—is a signature motif of his.\n*   The painting series is generally known by titles that translate to \"The Burning Mill\" or \"A Mill on Fire\". One notable version from 1847 is titled *En mølle ved København i nattlig brann* (A Mill near Copenhagen on Fire at Night). Another, from 1830, is often simply titled *En brennende mølle* (A Burning Mill).\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n*   The painting is a 19th-century work by the Norwegian Romantic artist Johan Christian Dahl.\n*   The most common and accepted English title for this work is \"The Burning Mill\".\n\n<<<The Burning Mill>>>"
