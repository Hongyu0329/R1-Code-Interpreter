    "The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that helps distinguish them at a glance is the curvature of the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule).\n\n*   ***Grimmia montana*** has a **straight seta**. This means the capsule is held erect.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta***, as its name suggests, has an **arcuate (curved) seta**. This gives the capsule a bent or nodding appearance.\n\nWhile other sporophytic differences exist, such as the presence or absence of stomata on the capsule wall (*G. montana* lacks them), the straight versus curved seta is the most readily observable feature for a quick visual distinction.\n\n<<<The primary distinguishing feature of the sporophyte, visible at a glance, is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has an arcuate (curved) seta.>>>"
