    "The image was taken in the Netherlands. The distinctive building with the red and white checkered pattern on its gable is the historic Vismarkt (Fish Market) in Alkmaar. This landmark, along with the canal and cobblestone street, is characteristic of the city.\n\nThe Vismarkt is a national monument consisting of stone galleries and covered fish banks, dating back to the 16th century, though it was rebuilt in 1755. Historically, it was a bustling marketplace for fresh fish, and although the market ceased operations in 1998, the building remains a significant historical site.\n\nNearby is the Grote or Sint-Laurenskerk (Great, or St. Lawrence Church), another prominent landmark in Alkmaar. The area is known for its charming canalside houses and historic bridges.\n\n<<<Netherlands>>>"
