    "The sequence of moves for black to achieve a checkmate in two, without moving the queens, is as follows:\n\n1.  **Rf6+**\n2.  **Ne3#**\n\nThis sequence forces a win for black regardless of white's response. The first move, Rf6+, puts the white king in check. White's only legal move is to move the king to h1 (Kh1), as all other potential escape squares are either occupied or under attack.\n\nFollowing white's forced move, black plays Ne3#, resulting in a checkmate. The knight on e3 attacks the white king on h1. The king has no escape squares, as g2 is controlled by the black bishop on h3 and h2 is occupied by a white pawn. The knight delivering the check cannot be captured, and the check cannot be blocked.\n\n<<<1. Rf6+, 2. Ne3#>>>"
