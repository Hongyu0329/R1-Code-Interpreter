    "The epiphytic species seen in the image, characterized by its black, net-like growth pattern on the tree bark, is a fungus belonging to the genus ***Armillaria***.\n\nThis distinctive net-like structure is formed by rhizomorphs, which are black, shoestring-like fungal strands that grow on and under the bark of infected trees. *Armillaria*, commonly known as honey fungus, is a plant pathogen that causes root rot in a wide variety of trees and woody plants. The fungus can survive for many years on dead wood and spreads through these rhizomorphs, which can grow through the soil or along root surfaces to infect new hosts.\n\nWhile the fungus may eventually produce honey-colored mushrooms at the base of the tree, the black rhizomorphs seen here are a key diagnostic sign of an *Armillaria* infection. These structures are composed of tightly packed fungal hyphae and are responsible for the spread of the disease.\n\n<<<Armillaria>>>"
