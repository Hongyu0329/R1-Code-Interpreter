Golden Gardens Park is one of the few parks in Seattle where beach fires are permitted in designated fire pits. According to Seattle Parks and Recreation, the beach fire season for 2022 began on May 28th.\n*   **Landscape:** The photograph features a sandy beach bordered by a forest of evergreen trees, a characteristic landscape of the Pacific Northwest and specifically of Golden Gardens Park.\n\nThese elements strongly suggest that the image was taken at Golden Gardens Park.\n\n<<<Seattle>>>"
