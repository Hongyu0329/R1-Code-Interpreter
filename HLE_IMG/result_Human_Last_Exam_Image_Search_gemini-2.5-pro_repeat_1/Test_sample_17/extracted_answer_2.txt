Theoretically, the stress at the tip of the wedges (point A) is **infinite**.

This is due to the phenomenon of **stress concentration** in materials with geometric discontinuities. The sharp corners of the triangular wedges act as stress raisers. In the idealized case of a perfectly sharp corner, as depicted in the diagram, the radius of curvature at the tip is zero.

According to the principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics, the stress at the tip of a sharp notch or crack is theoretically infinite. [2, 5] This is because the stress is inversely proportional to the radius of curvature at the notch tip, and as this radius approaches zero, the calculated stress approaches infinity. [2] Real-world materials will exhibit some local plastic deformation at the tip, which can blunt the "sharp" corner and result in a finite, albeit very high, stress value. However, based on pure theoretical analysis of the geometry shown, the stress at point A is singular.
