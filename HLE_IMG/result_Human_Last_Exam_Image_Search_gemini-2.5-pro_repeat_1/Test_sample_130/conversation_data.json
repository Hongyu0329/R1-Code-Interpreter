    "The provided image displays the emission spectrum of Uranium. This is identifiable by the characteristic pattern of numerous spectral lines across the visible spectrum, from blue to red.\n\nEach element emits a unique pattern of spectral lines when excited, which acts as a \"fingerprint\" for that element. The complex and dense line spectrum in the image is a known characteristic of heavy elements like uranium. Scientific databases and research papers confirm this specific spectral pattern belongs to uranium. For instance, studies on uranium's emission spectra detail the presence of many lines in the visible range, which corresponds to the image provided.\n\n<<<Uranium>>>"
