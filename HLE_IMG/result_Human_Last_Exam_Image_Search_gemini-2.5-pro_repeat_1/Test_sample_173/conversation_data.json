    "To determine the time signature of the musical measure, we must count the total duration of the notes within it. The time signature indicates how many beats are in a measure and what kind of note gets one beat.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Bass Clef (Lower Staff):** The bass clef contains four distinct chords. Each chord is written with a filled-in notehead and a stem, which identifies them as quarter notes. Counting these notes, we have four quarter notes in the measure.\n2.  **Analyze the Treble Clef (Upper Staff):** The treble clef contains a more complex rhythmic pattern. However, the notes are grouped in a way that corresponds to the four chords in the bass clef, suggesting four main beats in the measure.\n3.  **Synthesize the Information:** A measure containing four quarter notes is the definition of a 4/4 time signature. The top number '4' indicates there are four beats per measure, and the bottom number '4' indicates that the quarter note gets one beat. While the rhythm in the right hand is complex, the left hand provides a clear and unambiguous foundation of four quarter-note beats.\n\nBased on the four quarter notes clearly visible in the bass clef, the time signature is 4/4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
