    "Yes, the animal in the image is an insect, specifically a species of longhorn beetle. Its scientific name is *Stictoleptura rubra*.\n\nThis beetle is commonly known as the red-brown longhorn beetle. The species exhibits significant sexual dimorphism, meaning males and females have different appearances. The beetle in the photograph, with its black head and thorax and reddish-orange elytra (wing covers), is a male. Females of the species are typically a more uniform reddish-brown color over their entire body.\n\nThe larvae of *Stictoleptura rubra* develop in the dead wood of coniferous trees like pine, fir, and spruce, with a life cycle lasting two to three years. The adult beetles are often found on flowers during the summer months, where they feed on nectar and pollen. This species is found across Europe, Russia, North Africa, and Turkey.\n\n<<<Stictoleptura rubra>>>"
