    "This picture was taken in Incheon, South Korea. The image displays the distinctive ceiling of Incheon International Airport's Terminal 2.\n\nThe ceiling is a notable feature of the airport's modern design, characterized by its geometric pattern of blue-green glass triangles and metal latticework. This design is part of a \"delicate skeleton of skylight structures\" with a \"flowing geometry\" that is visible through a \"light-filtering ceiling canopy.\" The architecture of Terminal 2, which opened in 2018, has been recognized with a domestic architecture award.\n\nThe overall design of the terminal, including its high ceilings, aims to create a spacious and open atmosphere for travelers. The architectural firm Gensler, in collaboration with Heerim Architects, designed the terminal with the goal of calming and refreshing passengers, and the winged roof shape is inspired by the mythical phoenix, a significant cultural symbol in Korea.<<<Incheon>>>"
