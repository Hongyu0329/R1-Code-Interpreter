    "The tiny black organism in the photo, which appears as pin-like structures growing on a larger fungus, is most likely a slime mold, possibly **Hemitrichia calyculata**, also known as the Push Pin Slime Mold.\n\nThe larger host fungus is a type of bracket fungus called *Trametes versicolor*, commonly known as the Turkey Tail. This fungus is very common and grows in tiered layers on dead wood like logs and stumps. It is characterized by its semi-circular, fan-like caps with distinct concentric rings of various colors, including browns, grays, and whites, resembling a turkey's tail feathers.\n\nThe tiny black \"pins\" are the fruiting bodies of the slime mold. Slime molds are unique organisms that are not actually fungi but exist as single-celled organisms that can come together to form visible structures for reproduction. Several types of slime mold are known to grow on and consume bacteria from the surface of fungi, including the Turkey Tail. *Hemitrichia calyculata* is known for its fruiting bodies that can resemble tiny pins or tassels.\n\nAnother possibility is that the growths are a type of parasitic fungus known as pin mold, which also forms hair-like stalks with spore-filled heads, but the specific appearance on a Turkey Tail fungus strongly suggests a slime mold.\n\n<<<Hemitrichia calyculata>>>"
