    "The figure being pulled into the chariot is **Persephone**.\n\nThis ancient Greek vase, an Apulian red-figure pelike dating from approximately 370-360 BC, depicts the mythological abduction of Persephone by Hades. The artwork is currently housed in the Antikensammlung Berlin.\n\nThe dramatic scene unfolds with several key figures from Greek mythology:\n*   **Hades**, the god of the Underworld, is the bearded figure driving the chariot. He is forcefully pulling Persephone into his domain to make her his queen.\n*   **Persephone**, the goddess of spring and daughter of Demeter, is the woman being lifted from the ground and into the chariot.\n*   A **winged figure**, identified as **Eros**, the god of love, flies above the scene wielding a whip to spur on the chariot's horses. His presence signifies the role of desire in the abduction.\n*   On the ground lies a fallen **companion of Persephone**, one of the nymphs who was with her when Hades emerged from the underworld.\n\nThe myth of the abduction of Persephone was a popular subject in Greek art, particularly on funerary vases in Southern Italy, as it symbolized the cycle of seasons and the transition between life and death.\n\n<<<Persephone>>>"
