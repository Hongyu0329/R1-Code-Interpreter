    "The flag snippet displays horizontal stripes of black, white, and red from top to bottom. While no current country officially has this flag, it matches the flag of Yemen when displayed upside down.\n\nThe official flag of Yemen consists of three equal horizontal stripes of red, white, and black. The colors are part of the pan-Arab colors and represent a bright future (white) and the blood of martyrs (red), while the black stripe symbolizes a dark past.\n\nSeveral other Arab nations, such as Egypt, Syria, and Iraq, use a similar red, white, and black tricolor, but their flags include emblems like the Eagle of Saladin or green stars in the center white stripe. The Yemeni flag is a simple tricolor without any emblems. Flipping the Yemeni flag upside down results in the black, white, and red arrangement seen in the image. Historically, this black, white, and red combination was used by the German Empire.\n\n<<<Yemen>>>"
