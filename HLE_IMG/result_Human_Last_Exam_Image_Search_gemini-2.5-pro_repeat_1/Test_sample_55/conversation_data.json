    "The circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, form a G-sharp fully diminished seventh chord, which functions as a secondary leading-tone chord.\n\nA detailed analysis of the measure reveals the following:\n*   **Key Signature:** The piece is in D minor.\n*   **Notes Present:** The notes played on the first beat of measure 8 are G-sharp, B, and F. Although the D is not present in this voicing, it is harmonically implied. These notes (G#, B, D, F) constitute a G-sharp fully diminished seventh chord (G#°7).\n*   **Harmonic Function:** This chord serves to create tension and lead to the chord in the following measure. Measure 9 begins with an A major chord in the left hand, which is the dominant (V) of D minor. The G-sharp diminished seventh chord functions as the leading-tone seventh chord to this A major chord.\n*   **Roman Numeral:** In Roman numeral analysis, a leading-tone chord that resolves to the dominant is called a secondary or applied leading-tone chord. Therefore, the accurate Roman numeral for the G-sharp fully diminished seventh chord in this context is **vii°⁷/V**. This indicates a fully diminished seventh chord built on the leading tone (G#) of the dominant key (A major).\n\nThis progression (vii°⁷/V to V) is a common way to intensify the arrival of the dominant chord, adding a \"haunting\" and dramatic quality to the music before resolving to the \"sunshine\" of the A major chord, as one analysis describes it.\n\n<<<vii°⁷/V>>>"
