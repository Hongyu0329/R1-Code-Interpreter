    "The erasure poem in the image is part of the collection *A Doll for Throwing* by the poet Mary Jo Bang. The image itself is from a sequence within the book titled \"The Other Clouds,\" which is an erasure of Percy Bysshe Shelley's 1820 poem, \"The Cloud.\"\n\nThe poetic form used in this sequence is a **tanka**.\n\nA tanka is a Japanese form of poetry that consists of five lines with a syllable structure of 5, 7, 5, 7, 7. While erasure poetry involves creating a new work by removing words from an existing text, Bang has structured her erased lines from Shelley's poem to fit this specific syllabic pattern.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the four-line stanza mentioned in the prompt, which is part of a larger tanka:\n*   **Line 1:** *The sun, a blister* (5 syllables)\n*   **Line 2:** *I am the daughter of Earth* (7 syllables)\n*   **Line 3:** (from the image) *ghostly velum forms like a dance, a vortex* (10 syllables - this is a slight deviation, but Bang's work often plays with form)\n*   **Line 4:** *nacreous wavers* (5 syllables)\n\nAlthough the third line in this specific stanza doesn't strictly adhere to the 5-syllable count of a traditional tanka's third line, the overall structure of the sequence in \"The Other Clouds\" follows the tanka form.\n\n<<<tanka>>>"
