    "To find the total current flowing from the voltage source in the provided circuit, we must first determine the total equivalent resistance of the circuit.\n\n### Circuit Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Components and Voltage:**\n    *   Voltage Source (V2): 1 V\n    *   Resistors: R1 = 3 Ω, R2 = 7 Ω, R3 = 9 Ω, R7 = 100 Ω, R8 = 100 Ω\n\n2.  **Analyze the Circuit Layout:**\n    The circuit consists of two main branches connected in parallel across the 1 V source.\n\n    *   **Left Branch:** Resistors R1, R2, and R3 are present here. A wire connects the node between R1 and R2 directly back to the positive terminal of the voltage source. This wire effectively short-circuits resistor R1, meaning no current will flow through it. Therefore, the resistance of this branch is the sum of R2 and R3, which are in series.\n        *   Resistance of Left Branch (R_left) = R2 + R3 = 7 Ω + 9 Ω = 16 Ω.\n\n    *   **Right Branch:** Resistors R7 and R8 are connected in series.\n        *   Resistance of Right Branch (R_right) = R7 + R8 = 100 Ω + 100 Ω = 200 Ω.\n\n### Calculation of Total Current\n\nThere are two methods to calculate the total current.\n\n**Method 1: Calculate Total Equivalent Resistance First**\n\nThe total equivalent resistance (R_eq) for the two parallel branches is calculated using the formula:\n`1 / R_eq = 1 / R_left + 1 / R_right`\n\n*   `1 / R_eq = 1 / 16 Ω + 1 / 200 Ω`\n*   `1 / R_eq = (25 / 400) + (2 / 400) = 27 / 400 Ω`\n*   `R_eq = 400 / 27 Ω` ≈ 14.81 Ω\n\nNow, using Ohm's Law (V = I × R), the total current (I_total) is:\n*   `I_total = V2 / R_eq`\n*   `I_total = 1 V / (400 / 27) Ω = 27 / 400 A`\n*   `I_total = 0.0675 A`\n\n**Method 2: Calculate Branch Currents and Sum Them**\n\nThe total current is the sum of the currents in each parallel branch.\n\n*   **Current in Left Branch (I_left):**\n    *   `I_left = V2 / R_left = 1 V / 16 Ω = 0.0625 A`\n\n*   **Current in Right Branch (I_right):**\n    *   `I_right = V2 / R_right = 1 V / 200 Ω = 0.005 A`\n\n*   **Total Current (I_total):**\n    *   `I_total = I_left + I_right`\n    *   `I_total = 0.0625 A + 0.005 A = 0.0675 A`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result. The total current can also be expressed as 67.5 mA.\n\n<<<0.0675>>>"
