    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reaction Scheme**\n\n1.  **Starting Material**\n    The starting material is a derivative of 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. It has a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group on the nitrogen atom and a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group on the double bond.\n    *   **Molecular Formula of Starting Material:** C16H15F3NO2\n\n2.  **Step 1: Deprotection of the PMB group**\n    *   **Reagents:** Ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) in acetonitrile (ACN) and water (H2O).\n    *   **Transformation:** CAN is a chemical oxidant commonly used to remove the p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group from nitrogen atoms. This reaction cleaves the bond between the nitrogen and the PMB group, replacing it with a hydrogen atom (N-H). The PMB group is converted to p-methoxybenzaldehyde.\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is the bicyclic core without the PMB group.\n    *   **Change in Molecular Formula:** A PMB group (C8H9O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen. The net change is the subtraction of C8H8O.\n    *   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 1:** C16H15F3NO2 - C8H8O = C8H7F3NO.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Hydrogenation**\n    *   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2) in methanol (MeOH).\n    *   **Transformation:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction, which reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the ring to a single bond (C-C). This involves the addition of two hydrogen atoms (H2) across the double bond.\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** The bicyclic ring system is now saturated.\n    *   **Change in Molecular Formula:** Addition of H2.\n    *   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 2:** C8H7F3NO + H2 = C8H9F3NO.\n\n4.  **Step 3: Lactam Hydrolysis**\n    *   **Reagents:** 4 N Hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 70 Â°C.\n    *   **Transformation:** These are conditions for strong acid hydrolysis. The cyclic amide (lactam) is hydrolyzed by the addition of one molecule of water (H2O). The C-N bond of the amide is cleaved, opening the ring to form a molecule containing both an amino group (-NH2, which will be protonated to -NH3+ in the acidic solution) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Product:** The bicyclic structure opens to form a substituted cyclopentane ring carrying an amino group, a carboxylic acid group, and the trifluoromethyl group.\n    *   **Change in Molecular Formula:** Addition of H2O.\n    *   **Molecular Formula of the Final Product:** C8H9F3NO + H2O = C8H11F3NO2.\n\n### **Final Determination of the Molecular Formula**\n\nTo confirm the result, we can count the atoms in the predicted final product structure, which is a cyclopentane ring substituted with an amino group, a carboxylic acid, and a trifluoromethyl group.\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 5 carbons in the cyclopentane ring, 1 carbon in the -COOH group, 1 carbon in the C-CF3 group, and 1 carbon in the methyl group. Let's re-examine the starting material. It is 6-trifluoromethyl-2-(4-methoxybenzyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. Let's count the carbons again.\n    *   Bicyclic Core: C1, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7 -> 6 carbons\n    *   CF3 group -> 1 carbon\n    *   PMB group -> 8 carbons\n    *   Total carbons in starting material: 6 + 1 + 8 = 15. So the formula is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n*   **Let's re-calculate:**\n    1.  **Starting Material:** C15H14F3NO2\n    2.  **Step 1 (CAN):** Remove PMB (C8H9O) and add H. Net change is -C8H8O.\n        *   Intermediate 1: C15-8 H14-8 F3 N O2-1 = **C7H6F3NO**\n    3.  **Step 2 (Pd/C, H2):** Add H2.\n        *   Intermediate 2: C7H6F3NO + H2 = **C7H8F3NO**\n    4.  **Step 3 (HCl, H2O):** Add H2O.\n        *   Product: C7H8F3NO + H2O = **C7H10F3NO2**\n\nThis revised calculation is consistent. The final product is a substituted aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid. Let's count the atoms for a final time.\n*   **Carbons:** 5 in the cyclopentane ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CF3 = 7 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogens:** 7 on the cyclopentane ring + 2 in -NH2 + 1 in -COOH = 10 hydrogens.\n*   **Fluorines:** 3 in -CF3.\n*   **Nitrogens:** 1 in -NH2.\n*   **Oxygens:** 2 in -COOH.\n\nThe final molecular formula is therefore C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
