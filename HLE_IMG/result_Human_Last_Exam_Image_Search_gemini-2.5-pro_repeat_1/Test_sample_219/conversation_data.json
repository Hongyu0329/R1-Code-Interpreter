    "Based on the visual analysis of the provided raster plot, the following steps were taken to identify the synchronized bursts and calculate the average inter-burst interval.\n\n### Identification of Synchronized Bursts\n\nSynchronized bursts are identifiable as the dense, vertical columns of dots, which indicate that a large number of neurons are firing in a short period. The approximate timestamps for the center of each of these bursts are:\n\n*   **Burst 1:** ~3 s\n*   **Burst 2:** ~16 s\n*   **Burst 3:** ~27 s\n*   **Burst 4:** ~37 s\n*   **Burst 5:** ~49 s\n\n### Calculation of the Average Inter-Burst Interval (IBI)\n\nThe inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between consecutive synchronized bursts.\n\n1.  **Interval 1 (Burst 2 - Burst 1):** 16 s - 3 s = 13 s\n2.  **Interval 2 (Burst 3 - Burst 2):** 27 s - 16 s = 11 s\n3.  **Interval 3 (Burst 4 - Burst 3):** 37 s - 27 s = 10 s\n4.  **Interval 4 (Burst 5 - Burst 4):** 49 s - 37 s = 12 s\n\nThese four intervals are then averaged:\n\nAverage IBI = (13 + 11 + 10 + 12) / 4 = 46 / 4 = 11.5 s\n\nWhen rounded to two significant figures, the average inter-burst interval is 12 s.\n\n<<<12 s>>>"
