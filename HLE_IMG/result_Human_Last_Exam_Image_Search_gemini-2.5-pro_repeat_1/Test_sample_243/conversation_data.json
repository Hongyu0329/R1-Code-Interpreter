    "The plant in the image is *Debregeasia saeneb*. This species is not endemic to a single island. Instead, its native range extends from northeast tropical Africa to the Indian Subcontinent.\n\nThis shrub or small tree is found in the subtropical biome, growing in moist climates at moderate elevations. Its distribution includes countries such as Eritrea and Ethiopia in Africa, stretching through the Arabian Peninsula (Saudi Arabia, Yemen) to the Indian Subcontinent, including Pakistan, India, Nepal, and parts of China.\n\nWhile some species within the *Debregeasia* genus are endemic to specific locations, such as *Debregeasia hekouensis* in Yunnan Province, China, *Debregeasia saeneb* has a much broader native distribution and is not restricted to one island.\n\n<<<Not endemic to an island>>>"
