    "The image provided is a fragment of the Ingvar runestone with the identifier **Sö 9**. This runestone is located in Lifsinge, Gnesta Municipality, Sweden.\n\nIt is one of approximately 26 to 30 Ingvar runestones, which were raised to commemorate those who died in a Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled. The inscription on Sö 9 was carved in memory of a man named Ulf, who died with Ingvar. It reads, in Old Norse: \"Bergviðr/Barkviðr ok þau Hælga ræistu stæin þannsi at Ulf, sun sinn. Hann ændaðis með Ingvari. Guð hialpi salu Ulfs.\" This translates to: \"Bergviðr/Barkviðr and Helga, they raised this stone in memory of Ulfr, their son. He met his end with Ingvarr. May God help Ulfr's soul.\"\n\nThe stone is made of granite, is about 2.05 meters tall, and features carvings in the Ringerike style. It was discovered broken in five pieces in 1857 and was reassembled and erected near its original location in 1934.\n\n<<<Sö 9>>>"
