    "This silver-gilt disc, or phalera, which was a form of military decoration, is part of a collection of artifacts known as the Vize Hoard. This hoard was discovered in Vize, a town in the Thracian region of modern-day Turkey.\n\nArchaeologists have dated the objects in the Vize Hoard, including this medallion, to the **1st century A.D.** The style of the artifacts suggests they were produced in the early Roman Imperial period.\n\nThe medallion features two confronted busts. The figure on the left, with ram's horns, is often identified as Zeus-Ammon, a syncretic deity, or a ruler, like Alexander the Great, depicted with the attributes of the god.\n\n<<<1st century A.D.>>>"
