    "To determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata, a harmonic analysis is necessary.\n\n**1. Key Signature:** The sonata's first movement is in the key of C minor. The key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭).\n\n**2. Chord Analysis:**\n*   **Measure 29:** This measure contains a C minor chord (C-E♭-G), which is the tonic chord in C minor, represented by the Roman numeral **i**.\n*   **Measure 30:** The circled measure features a D major triad (D-F♯-A) in the left hand. This chord is not diatonic (naturally occurring) in the key of C minor.\n*   **Measure 31:** The following measure contains a G major chord (G-B♮-D), which is the dominant chord of C minor, represented by the Roman numeral **V**.\n\n**3. Harmonic Function:** The D major chord in measure 30 strongly leads to the G major chord in measure 31. A major chord built on the second scale degree that resolves to the dominant (V) is known as a secondary dominant. In this case, D major is the dominant of G. This harmonic device creates a V-I relationship in the key of the dominant (G major), before resolving back to the home key of C minor. Some analyses also identify this as involving an augmented 6th chord, another type of chromatic harmony.\n\nTherefore, the D major chord in measure 30 functions as the \"dominant of the dominant.\"\n\n**4. Roman Numeral:** This \"dominant of the dominant\" relationship is represented by the Roman numeral **V/V** (read as \"five of five\").\n\n<<<V/V>>>"
