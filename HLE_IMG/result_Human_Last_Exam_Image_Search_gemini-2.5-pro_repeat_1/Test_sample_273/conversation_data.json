    "The absolute configuration of the molecule is determined by assigning the stereochemistry (R or S) to each of its chiral centers using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\nThe molecule shown is 5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol. It has three chiral centers at carbons C2, C3, and C4 (numbering from the alcohol end, which has the highest priority).\n\n1.  **Chiral Center C2 (bearing the -OH group):**\n    *   The groups attached are -OH, -CH(C2H5)CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (C3), -CH3 (C1), and -H.\n    *   The CIP priorities are: (1) -OH, (2) -C3, (3) -CH3, (4) -H.\n    *   In the drawing, the C1-C2 and C2-C3 bonds are in the plane. The -OH group is on a wedge (pointing out), which implies the -H atom is on a dash (pointing in).\n    *   With the lowest priority group (-H) pointing away, we look at the sequence of the remaining groups: 1 → 2 → 3 (-OH → -C3 → -CH3). This sequence proceeds in a clockwise direction.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C2 is **R**.\n\n2.  **Chiral Center C3 (bearing the ethyl group):**\n    *   The groups attached are -CH(OH)CH3 (C2), -CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (C4), -CH2CH3 (ethyl), and -H.\n    *   The CIP priorities are: (1) -C2 (carbon bonded to O), (2) -C4 (carbon bonded to C, C, and N via CH2NH2), (3) -CH2CH3 (carbon bonded to C and H), (4) -H.\n    *   In the drawing, the C2-C3 and C3-C4 bonds are in the plane. The ethyl group is on a wedge, so the implied -H is on a dash.\n    *   With the lowest priority group (-H) pointing away, the sequence 1 → 2 → 3 (-C2 → -C4 → -ethyl) is clockwise.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C3 is **R**.\n\n3.  **Chiral Center C4 (bearing the methyl and aminomethyl groups):**\n    *   The groups attached are -CH2NH2, -CH(C2H5)CH(OH)CH3 (C3), -CH3, and -H.\n    *   The CIP priorities are: (1) -CH2NH2 (carbon bonded to N), (2) -C3 (carbon bonded to other carbons), (3) -CH3, (4) -H.\n    *   In the drawing, the C3-C4 bond and the C4-CH2NH2 bond are in the plane. The -CH3 group is on a dash. This means the -H atom must be on a wedge.\n    *   With the lowest priority group (-H) pointing towards the viewer, we determine the direction and reverse the result. The sequence 1 → 2 → 3 (-CH2NH2 → -C3 → -CH3) is clockwise, which would normally indicate R.\n    *   However, since the lowest priority group is pointing out, we reverse the assignment.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C4 is **S**.\n\nCombining the configurations for all chiral centers, the absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3R, 4S).\n\n<<< (2R, 3R, 4S)>>>"
