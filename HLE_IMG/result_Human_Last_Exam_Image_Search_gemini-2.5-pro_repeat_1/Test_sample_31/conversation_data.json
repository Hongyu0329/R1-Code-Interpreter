    "The knot in the picture is the **8₁₉ knot** in the Rolfsen table. It is also known as the torus knot T(4,3) or the pretzel knot P(3,3,-2).\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant, also called the s-invariant, is a knot invariant that provides a lower bound for the smooth 4-genus of a knot. For the 8₁₉ knot, the Rasmussen s-invariant is **-6**.\n\n<<<−6>>>"
