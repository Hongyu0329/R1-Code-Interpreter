    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. It is a Pineapplefish, and its scientific name is *Cleidopus gloriamaris*.\n\nThis fish is easily identifiable by its distinct yellow to whitish scales with black rear margins, which create a striking pattern that resembles a pineapple. This unique appearance has also earned it other names like the Knightfish and the coat-of-mail fish, due to the armor-like scales covering its body. The name *Cleidopus gloriamaris* is derived from the Latin words \"gloria\" and \"maris,\" meaning \"glory of the sea.\"\n\nThe Pineapplefish can grow up to 22 cm (8.7 in) long and has a plump, rounded body. It is native to the coastal waters of Australia, specifically off Queensland, New South Wales, and Western Australia, where it inhabits reefs and harbors at depths of 6 to 200 meters.\n\nA fascinating feature of the Pineapplefish is its pair of bioluminescent organs on the lower jaw, which contain glowing bacteria. These organs emit a greenish light in young fish that turns more reddish as they age, and they are used to attract prey at night.\n\n<<<*Cleidopus gloriamaris*>>>"
