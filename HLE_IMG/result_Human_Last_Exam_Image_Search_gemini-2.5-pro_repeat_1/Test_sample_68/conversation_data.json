    "This coin does not originate from a single French colony but was intended for general circulation in various French territories.\n\nThe inscription \"COLONIES FRANÇOISES\" clearly indicates that these coins were minted for use across the French colonial empire. The coin pictured is a 9 Deniers piece featuring King Louis XV, as denoted by the \"LVD XV\" on the obverse. These copper coins were struck in 1721 and 1722.\n\nAn edict in June 1721 authorized the production of these 9 denier coins for the colonies. They were intended for circulation in French colonies in the Americas, including New France (which encompassed Louisiana, Acadie, and Canada) and the French West Indies. For instance, a large quantity was sent to Canada in 1722, but the colonists there were reluctant to use them, leading to most being returned to France. Subsequently, these same coins were sent to Louisiana. They were also sent to and well-received on Île Bourbon (modern-day Réunion).\n\nDue to its intended use in multiple locations, it is not possible to assign this coin to a single, specific French colony.\n\n<<<This coin was minted for general circulation in the French colonies, not one specific colony.>>>"
