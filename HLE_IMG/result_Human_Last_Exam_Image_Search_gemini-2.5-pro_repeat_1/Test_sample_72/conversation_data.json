    "Two pericyclic reactions occur in this transformation: a [2+2] cycloaddition followed by an electrocyclic ring opening.\n\nThe reaction proceeds in two distinct photochemically allowed steps:\n\n1.  **[2+2] Photocycloaddition**: The first step is a cycloaddition between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene. Under the influence of ultraviolet (UV) light (indicated by *hv*), a photochemically allowed [2π + 2π] cycloaddition occurs between one of the double bonds of the hexafluorobenzene ring and the double bond of cyclobutene. This reaction takes place at the 1,2-positions (ortho) of the benzene ring, leading to the formation of a tricyclic intermediate.\n\n2.  **Electrocyclic Ring Opening**: The tricyclic intermediate formed in the first step is unstable and rapidly undergoes a second pericyclic reaction. This step is a 4π-electron electrocyclic ring opening. The four-membered ring that was originally part of the cyclobutene reactant opens up. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for photochemical reactions, a 4π electrocyclic process proceeds in a disrotatory fashion. This ring-opening step relieves the strain in the tricyclic system and results in the final, more stable bicyclic product shown.\n\nTherefore, the two pericyclic reactions involved are a [2+2] cycloaddition and an electrocyclic ring opening.\n\n<<<[2+2] cycloaddition and electrocyclic ring opening>>>"
