    "Based on the clues provided, \"X Y\" is a **Mad Hatter**.\n\nThe image depicts an awards ceremony. While several awards were presented on June 20, 2019, including to Ron Klasko and Lee C. Forsblom, the image itself does not definitively identify the specific event or individuals shown.\n\nHowever, the second clue provides the critical information. The phrase \"mad as a hatter\" originated from the neurological symptoms suffered by hat makers from the 18th to the 20th centuries due to chronic mercury poisoning. They used mercuric nitrate to treat animal fur for making felt hats, a process called \"carroting\". This process involved poorly ventilated rooms where hatters would inhale the toxic mercury vapors. The use of mercury in hat making was eventually banned in the United States in 1941. This toxicological connection directly points to the \"Mad Hatter\".\n\n<<<Mad Hatter>>>"
