    "Based on the position from the provided image, here is the two-move checkmate for White:\n\n1.  **Rf2**\n    This initial move puts Black in a state of *zugzwang*, meaning any move they make will worsen their position. The Black King on e4 has no legal moves, as the Rook on f2 now covers the d3 and f3 escape squares. Black is forced to move their Queen or Rook.\n\n2.  **Nf5#**\n    Regardless of which piece Black moves (the Queen from d5 or the Rook from c6), White delivers checkmate by moving the Knight from e7 to f5. The Black King is attacked by the Knight and all of its potential escape squares are either blocked by its own pieces or attacked by White's pieces (Qa4, Rf2). The check cannot be blocked or the Knight captured.\n\nTherefore, the winning sequence is **1. Rf2**, followed by **2. Nf5#**.\n\n<<<1. Rf2, 2. Nf5#>>>"
