    "The tiling shown in the image is a periodic tiling composed of regular hexagons (dark blue), squares (light yellow), and rhombi (orange). Analysis of the pattern reveals multiple centers of rotational symmetry.\n\nThe centers of the blue hexagons are points of **6-fold rotational symmetry**. Rotating the entire pattern by 60 degrees (360°/6) around the center of any hexagon leaves the tiling unchanged.\n\nAdditionally, the centers of the light yellow squares act as points of **4-fold rotational symmetry**, where a 90-degree rotation (360°/4) preserves the tiling. The pattern also contains points of 3-fold and 2-fold rotational symmetry at various vertices.\n\nWhen asked for \"the\" rotational symmetry of a tiling, the convention is to state the highest order of rotation possible. In this case, the highest order of rotational symmetry is 6-fold. This type of tiling belongs to the p6m wallpaper group, which is characterized by having a 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\nTherefore, the rotational symmetry of the tiling is 6-fold.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
