    "To determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair, we must use visual cues and the information provided: the insects are pollinators from taxa without scopae (pollen-collecting hairs) on their legs, and both sexes feed on nectar.\n\n**Pair A: Cuckoo Bees**\n\nThese bees belong to taxa of cleptoparasitic (cuckoo) bees, which lay their eggs in the nests of other bees. Because they do not collect pollen, females lack scopae, fitting the prompt's description.\n\n*   **A (Left):** This bee is a *Coelioxys*, or sharp-tailed bee. The abdomen is strongly tapered to a sharp point. This cone-shaped abdomen is a key characteristic of females, which they use to pierce the nests of their hosts to lay eggs.\n*   **A (Right):** This is a *Triepeolus*, another type of cuckoo bee. Sexing this individual is more difficult without a clear view of the abdominal tip or antennae. However, cuckoo bees like *Triepeolus* often appear wasp-like and females lack scopae. Comparing it to the confirmed female on the left, and noting its robust build while actively foraging, it is most consistent with being a female as well. In many bee species, males and females can be distinguished by the number of antennal and abdominal segments, but this is not visible here.\n\n**Conclusion for A: Female, Female (2)**\n\n**Pair B: Paper Wasps**\n\nThese are wasps, likely from the genus *Polistes*. Wasps do not have scopae, as they do not collect pollen for their young (they hunt insects instead), so they fit the prompt's criteria. Both sexes feed on nectar.\n\n*   **B (Left):** This wasp has long antennae that are distinctly curled at the tips. This is a definitive characteristic of a male *Polistes* wasp.\n*   **B (Right):** This wasp has shorter, straight antennae. This is characteristic of a female.\n\n**Conclusion for B: Male, Female (3)**\n\n**Pair C: Bees without Leg Scopae**\n\nThe prompt specifies a taxon without *leg* scopae. This could include bees from the family Megachilidae (leafcutter and mason bees), where females have abdominal scopae.\n\n*   **C (Left):** This bee displays classic features of a male bee: extremely long antennae and a yellow-marked clypeus (the lower part of the face). While strongly resembling a long-horned bee (*Melissodes*), those belong to a taxon where females have prominent leg scopae. However, these male characteristics are also found in some Megachilid bees, which would fit the prompt's constraint. Therefore, this is a male.\n*   **C (Right):** This fuzzy bee has shorter antennae and a dark face, which are typical female characteristics. Its appearance is consistent with that of a female from a taxon like *Megachile*, which would carry pollen on an abdominal scopa (not visible from this angle).\n\n**Conclusion for C: Male, Female (3)**\n\nCombining the results for each pair:\n*   A: Female, Female (2)\n*   B: Male, Female (3)\n*   C: Male, Female (3)\n\n<<<2, 3, 3>>>"
