    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled).\n\n### 1. Understand the Goal\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage reduction in total miles traveled by cars when shifting from the \"Baseline\" (Table 1) mode share to the \"Proposed\" (Table 2) mode share.\n\n### 2. Formulate the Calculation\nVehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) is calculated by multiplying the number of trips by the distance of those trips. Since the tables provide shares and averages, we can calculate a representative VMT value for each scenario. We'll assume a total number of trips (e.g., 'N') which will cancel out during the final percentage calculation.\n\nThe formula for the total weighted VMT for each scenario is:\n`VMT = Σ (Share of Total Trips * (Car, 1 occupant Share + Car, >2 occupants Share) * Average Trip Distance)` for each distance category.\n\n### 3. Calculate Baseline Car VMT (Table 1)\nFirst, we calculate the total share of car trips for each distance category in the baseline scenario:\n*   **0-3 miles:** 25% + 28% = 53%\n*   **3-5 miles:** 38% + 43% = 81%\n*   **5-10 miles:** 40% + 45% = 85%\n*   **10+ miles:** 42% + 47% = 89%\n\nNext, we calculate the VMT for each category by multiplying the share of total trips, the total car share, and the average trip distance.\n*   **0-3 miles VMT:** 0.48 (share of trips) * 0.53 (car share) * 1 (avg distance) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles VMT:** 0.22 * 0.81 * 4 = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles VMT:** 0.14 * 0.85 * 7.5 = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles VMT:** 0.16 * 0.89 * 20 = 2.8480\n\n**Total Baseline VMT (proportional value):** 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n### 4. Calculate Proposed Car VMT (Table 2)\nSimilarly, we calculate the total share of car trips for each distance category in the proposed scenario:\n*   **0-3 miles:** 1% + 2% = 3%\n*   **3-5 miles:** 8% + 19% = 27%\n*   **5-10 miles:** 14% + 27% = 41%\n*   **10+ miles:** 16% + 33% = 49%\n\nNext, we calculate the VMT for each category in the proposed scenario:\n*   **0-3 miles VMT:** 0.48 (share of trips) * 0.03 (car share) * 1 (avg distance) = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles VMT:** 0.22 * 0.27 * 4 = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles VMT:** 0.14 * 0.41 * 7.5 = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles VMT:** 0.16 * 0.49 * 20 = 1.5680\n\n**Total Proposed VMT (proportional value):** 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n### 5. Calculate the Percentage Reduction\nFinally, we use the total VMT values to calculate the percentage reduction.\n\n*   **VMT Reduction:** Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction:** (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT) * 100\n*   **Percentage Reduction:** (2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100 ≈ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
