    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip, we must first understand the calibration of the ECG paper.\n\n*   **Paper Speed:** The strip indicates a speed of 25 mm/sec.\n*   **Grid Measurement:** On standard ECG paper at this speed, the horizontal axis represents time.\n    *   One small square (1 mm) corresponds to 0.04 seconds.\n    *   One large square (5 mm) corresponds to 0.20 seconds.\n\nThe R-R interval is the time between two consecutive R waves (the prominent peaks of the QRS complex). To find the longest interval, we need to visually scan the strip for the greatest distance between two R waves.\n\nA significant pause is visible in the fourth line of the rhythm strip (which starts near the timestamp `0:06:08`). The interval between the second and third QRS complexes in this line is clearly the longest on the entire strip.\n\nTo measure this interval:\n1.  Locate the peak of the second R wave in the fourth line. It aligns closely with a major vertical grid line.\n2.  Count the number of large squares to the peak of the next R wave. There are 8 full large squares.\n3.  After the 8 large squares, there are approximately 2 additional small squares before the peak of the third R wave.\n4.  The total distance is (8 large squares × 5 small squares/large square) + 2 small squares = 42 small squares.\n\nTo convert this distance to time in seconds:\n*   Time = Number of small squares × Time per small square\n*   Time = 42 × 0.04 seconds = 1.68 seconds\n\n<<<1.68>>>"
