The difference in regioselectivity arises because the reaction mechanism is dictated by the presence or absence of an α-hydrogen on the amino acid. Reaction 3, with N-acetyl-proline, has an α-hydrogen, allowing it to form a specific munchone intermediate via a standard cyclodehydration. The subsequent [3+2] cycloaddition of this well-defined munchone with methyl propiolate is highly regioselective, governed by electronic factors (FMO theory). In contrast, the N-acetyl-N-methyl-valine used in Reactions 1 and 2 lacks an α-hydrogen, blocking the standard pathway. This forces the reaction into an alternative, non-selective mechanism. As shown by the ¹³C labeling experiment in Reaction 2, the initial activation step involves equally probable deprotonation of either the acetyl methyl group or a methyl group on the isopropyl side chain, forming two different intermediates in a 1:1 ratio. This non-selective activation is the source of the observed 1:1 product ratio. Both of these pathways appear to converge, via a fragmentation of the isopropyl side chain, to a common intermediate that ultimately yields Product A. Therefore, the regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is a property of the cycloaddition step itself, while the lack of regioselectivity in Reactions 1 and 2 is a property of the initial, non-standard activation step.
