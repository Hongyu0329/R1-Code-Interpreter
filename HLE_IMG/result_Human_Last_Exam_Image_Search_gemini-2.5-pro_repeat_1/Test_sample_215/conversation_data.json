    "This home is part of the town of Choctaw.\n\nThe city of Choctaw is located in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, and had a population of 12,182 at the 2020 census. Current estimates place the population at around 12,266. This makes it the oldest chartered town in Oklahoma Territory.\n\nWhile some online listings may associate addresses on South Choctaw Road with the smaller nearby town of Washington due to postal code boundaries, the area is functionally a part of the greater Choctaw community. For instance, homes along South Choctaw Road are included in the Choctaw-Nicoma Park School District.\n\n<<<Choctaw>>>"
