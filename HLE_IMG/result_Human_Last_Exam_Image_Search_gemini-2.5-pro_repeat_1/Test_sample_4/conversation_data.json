    "The knot depicted in the image is known as the 9₄₂ knot, sometimes referred to as a Celtic knot. To determine its Jones polynomial, one can refer to knot theory resources that catalog the properties of various knots. The Jones polynomial is a significant invariant in knot theory, helping to distinguish different knots from one another.\n\nFor the 9₄₂ knot, the Jones polynomial, denoted as V(t), is:\n\nt⁻⁴ - t⁻³ + t⁻² - t⁻¹ + 1 - t + t²\n\nArranging this in decreasing degree order as requested, we get:\n\nt² - t + 1 - t⁻¹ + t⁻² - t⁻³ + t⁻⁴\n\nIt is noteworthy that the Jones polynomial for the 9₄₂ knot is the same as that for its mirror image.\n\n<<<t^2 - t + 1 - t^-1 + t^-2 - t^-3 + t^-4>>>"
