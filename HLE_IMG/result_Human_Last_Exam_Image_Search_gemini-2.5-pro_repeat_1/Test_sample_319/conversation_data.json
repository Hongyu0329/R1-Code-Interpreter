    "The phenomenon depicted in the image, where a sound is perceived as continuous even when parts of it are replaced by another sound like a noise burst, is known by several names. The most common and general terms are the **auditory continuity illusion** or **perceptual restoration**.\n\nThis auditory illusion demonstrates the brain's ability to \"fill in\" missing information. When a tone is interrupted by a short burst of noise that is loud enough to mask the gap, the auditory system perceives the tone as continuing uninterrupted through the noise. This perceptual completion is not limited to simple tones but also occurs with more complex and time-varying sounds like speech and music.\n\nSeveral key factors influence the strength of this illusion:\n*   The interrupting noise must be sufficiently loud to effectively mask the deleted portion of the sound.\n*   The gap in the original sound cannot be too long, or the illusion will fail.\n*   The transitions into and out of the gap should not be too abrupt.\n\nWhen this illusion occurs with speech, where a missing phoneme (a basic unit of sound in language) is replaced by a non-speech sound like a cough or static, it is more specifically called the **phonemic restoration effect**. Listeners often report hearing the complete word or sentence, and may not even notice that a sound was missing.\n\nThis perceptual ability is a fundamental aspect of hearing, allowing us to perceive continuous streams of sound, like speech or music, in noisy environments where parts of the sound signal may be momentarily obscured. The image provided, with its spectrogram and waveform, is a classic illustration used in auditory science to demonstrate this phenomenon.\n\nOther related terms for this effect include **temporal induction** and **auditory induction**.\n\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion (or Perceptual restoration)>>>"
