    "Based on a detailed visual analysis and supporting information, the rock specimens are identified as follows:\n\n*   **H: Scoria** This rock is reddish-brown and highly vesicular, meaning it is full of gas bubbles. Scoria is a type of volcanic rock that is typically dark in color (brown, black, or reddish) and has larger vesicles compared to pumice.\n\n*   **I: Breccia** This specimen is composed of large, angular fragments of other rocks cemented together. Rocks made of cemented, angular clasts are known as breccia. The angularity of the fragments suggests they were deposited close to their source with minimal transport.\n\n*   **J: Pumice** This is a light-colored, fine-grained, and highly vesicular volcanic rock. Pumice is known for its porous and frothy appearance, which results from a rapid cooling and depressurization process during a volcanic eruption. Unlike the similarly vesicular scoria, pumice is typically light-colored.\n\n*   **K: Pegmatite** This rock is distinguished by its very large, interlocking crystals. Pegmatite is an igneous rock with an exceptionally coarse-grained texture, with crystals often larger than 1 cm. It commonly has a composition similar to granite, consisting of minerals like quartz and feldspar.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
