    "The characters on the seal, written in a traditional seal script (篆書, zhuanshu), should be read from top to bottom, right to left.\n\nThe characters are:\n*   **Top Right:** 不 (bù) - meaning \"not\".\n*   **Bottom Right:** 爲 (wéi) - meaning \"for\" or \"to act as\". This is the traditional form of the character 为.\n*   **Top Left:** 富 (fù) - meaning \"wealth\" or \"riches\".\n*   **Bottom Left:** 貴 (guì) - meaning \"nobility\" or \"honor\". This is the traditional form of the character 贵.\n\nRead together, they form the phrase **不爲富貴** (bù wéi fù guì).\n\nIn simplified Chinese, this is written as **不为富贵**.\n\nThis phrase translates to \"not for wealth and honor,\" expressing a scholarly or artistic ideal of being indifferent to material riches and social rank, and pursuing one's endeavors for higher purposes. This is a common sentiment found on the seals of artists and intellectuals.\n\n<<<不为富贵>>>"
