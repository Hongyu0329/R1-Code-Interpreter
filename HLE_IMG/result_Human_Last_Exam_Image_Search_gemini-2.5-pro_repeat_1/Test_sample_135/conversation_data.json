    "This glazed terracotta tondo, depicting a scene of communion, is the work of **Jean-Timothée Bècle**, a sculptor from Lyon.\n\nThe relief, titled ***The Sacrament of the Altar*** **(Le Sacrement de l'Autel)**, was created between 1820 and 1830. It is stylistically inspired by the work of the Della Robbia family, famous for their enameled terracotta sculptures from the Italian Renaissance. The artwork is currently housed in the **Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon (Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon)**.\n\nThe scene portrays a priest giving communion to several kneeling figures, including children and adults, within a decorative round frame. The inscription \"SACRAMENT DE L'AUTEL\" is clearly visible at the bottom of the central image. This piece is a notable example of the revival of Della Robbia's style in 19th-century France.\n\n<<<Jean-Timothée Bècle>>>"
