    "The product featured in the advertisement is Bile Beans. This advertisement was part of a larger campaign during the 1940s that targeted women, who had entered the workforce in massive numbers to support the war effort.\n\nAdvertisements for Bile Beans claimed the product, a laxative and herbal tonic, could help women overcome the physical strain of men's work and what the campaign referred to as an \"inherent handicap\". The ingredients included common pharmacy items of the period such as cascara, rhubarb, liquorice, and menthol.\n\nWhile the product name \"Bile Beans\" is English, another product heavily marketed to women during that era with a French-derived name was the perfume Chanel No. 5, created by French couturier Gabrielle \"Coco\" Chanel. During World War II, it was a coveted souvenir for soldiers to bring home, and the company provided free bottles to American GIs at the end of the war.\n\nAnother product with a French-derived name is Marmite, which comes from the French word for a large cooking pot. It was also advertised during the war for its health benefits, specifically its concentration of B vitamins.\n\n<<<Bile Beans>>>"
