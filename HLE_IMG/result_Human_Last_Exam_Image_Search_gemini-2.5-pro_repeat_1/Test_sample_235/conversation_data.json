    "To determine the metric pattern of the words in the erasure poem, a step-by-step analysis is required.\n\nFirst, the words of the poem are identified as: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\".\n\nNext, the number of syllables in the phrase is counted:\n*   **rules**: 1\n*   **and**: 1\n*   **lines**: 1\n*   **an**: 1\n*   **in-tri-cate**: 3\n*   **spi-der's**: 2\n*   **web**: 1\n*   **work**: 1\nThe total syllable count is 11.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given answer choices based on this information:\n*   **A. free verse**: This poetic form is defined by its lack of a regular meter or rhyme scheme. The lines can be of any length and tend to follow the rhythms of natural speech. This remains a possibility.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter**: This meter consists of a line with five iambic feet, which amounts to 10 syllables in a pattern of unstressed followed by stressed. While an 11-syllable line can exist in iambic pentameter (called a feminine ending), the poem's stress pattern must still be predominantly iambic. The natural reading of the poem—\"RULES and LINES, an IN-tri-cate SPI-der's WEB WORK\"—does not follow a consistent unstressed-stressed pattern.\n*   **C. alexandrine**: This is a line of verse containing 12 syllables. The poem has 11 syllables, so this option is incorrect.\n*   **D. sapphic**: This refers to a specific four-line stanza form where the first three lines have 11 syllables and the fourth has five. The poem is a single phrase, not a four-line stanza, making this choice incorrect.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter**: This is a line with three iambic feet, totaling about six syllables. The poem's 11 syllables make it too long for a trimeter.\n*   **F. american sentence**: This is a form created by poet Allen Ginsberg, which is a single sentence of exactly 17 syllables. The poem has 11 syllables, so this is not an American sentence.\n\nSince the poem does not conform to the specific syllable counts or metrical patterns of iambic pentameter, alexandrine, sapphic, iambic trimeter, or the American sentence, and because its rhythm is irregular, the most accurate description is free verse. Poetry in free verse is not bound by strict rules of meter or rhyme.\n\n<<<A>>>"
