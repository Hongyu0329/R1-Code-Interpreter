    "The species that definitively indicates this photo was taken on the Atlantic rather than Pacific Coast is the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*.\n\nThis small marine snail is native to the northeastern Atlantic coasts of Europe. It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the mid-19th century, likely transported in the rock ballast of ships. Since its introduction, it has become one of the most abundant snails on the rocky shorelines of the North Atlantic, with a range extending from Labrador, Canada, down to Delaware or Maryland in the United States.\n\nWhile there have been scattered reports and isolated discoveries of *Littorina littorea* on the Pacific coast, these populations have generally not become established or widespread. The snail's overwhelming abundance and status as a key species in the intertidal community are characteristic features of the Atlantic coast, not the Pacific. The scene in the photograph, showing a dense population of these periwinkles among barnacles, is a classic North Atlantic intertidal ecosystem.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
