The total power delivered to the grid as a function of $P_{\text{wave}}$, $P_{c}$, and $P^{0}_{\text{wind}}$ is formulated as:
$P_{\text{grid}} = (P^{0}_{\text{wind}} + P_{\text{wave}} - P_c) - k(P^{0}_{\text{wind}} + P_{\text{wave}} - P_c)^2$

The optimal compensation power required to meet the grid demand while minimizing the undersea cable losses is:
$P{c}^{\text{opt}} = 1.05 \text{ MW}$

The total power delivered to the grid, including the effect of cable losses, is:
$P_{\text{grid}} = 12.004 \text{ MW}$
