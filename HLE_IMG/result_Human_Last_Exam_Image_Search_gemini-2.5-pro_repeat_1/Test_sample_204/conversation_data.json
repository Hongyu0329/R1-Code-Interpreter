    "Based on the visual evidence and knowledge of mineralogy, the specimens are identified and ordered by increasing silicate structure complexity as follows:\n\n*   **Specimen C: Olivine** - This mineral displays a characteristic olive-green color and a granular habit, typical of olivine. Olivine is a **nesosilicate** (isolated tetrahedra), which represents the simplest silicate structure. The silica tetrahedra (SiO4) are linked only by metal ions (iron and/or magnesium).\n\n*   **Specimen A: Pyroxene (likely Augite)** - This specimen is a dark, stout, prismatic crystal. This form is common for pyroxenes like augite. Pyroxenes are **inosilicates** characterized by single chains of silica tetrahedra. This single-chain structure is more complex than the isolated tetrahedra of olivine.\n\n*   **Specimen B: Mica** - This mineral's key feature is its perfect cleavage, allowing it to split into thin, flexible sheets. This physical property is a direct result of its atomic structure. Micas are **phyllosilicates** (sheet silicates), where tetrahedra are linked to form two-dimensional sheets. This sheet structure is more complex than the single chains of pyroxenes.\n\n*   **Specimen D: Quartz** - This transparent, brownish crystal exhibits the typical hexagonal crystal form and vitreous luster of quartz. The color suggests it is a variety known as smoky quartz. Quartz is a **tectosilicate** (framework silicate), where every oxygen atom of each tetrahedron is shared with a neighboring tetrahedron, creating a complete three-dimensional framework. This is the most complex of the silicate structures.\n\nThe order of increasing silicate structure complexity is:\nIsolated Tetrahedra → Single Chain → Sheet → Framework\n\nTherefore, the correct order for the specimens is C, A, B, D.\n\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
