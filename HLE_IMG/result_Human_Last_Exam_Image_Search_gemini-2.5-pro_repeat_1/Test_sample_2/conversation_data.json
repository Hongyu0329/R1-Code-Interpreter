    "To determine the time complexity of the provided algorithm, we need to analyze its recursive structure.\n\n### Algorithm Analysis\n\nThe pseudocode is for a recursive function `sort(a, n)`:\n```python\ndef sort(a, n):\n  if n > 1:\n    # 1. Recursive call on the first n-1 elements\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n\n    # 2. Constant time operations (comparison and potential swap)\n    if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n      swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])\n\n    # 3. Another recursive call on the first n-1 elements\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n```\n\nLet's define T(n) as the time complexity for an input of size `n`.\n\n1.  **Base Case:** When `n <= 1`, the function does nothing and returns. This takes constant time, T(1) = c.\n2.  **Recursive Step:** When `n > 1`, the function performs the following steps:\n    *   It makes one recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)`. This has a cost of T(n - 1).\n    *   It performs a comparison and a potential swap. These are constant time operations, O(1).\n    *   It makes a second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)`. This also has a cost of T(n - 1).\n\n### Recurrence Relation\n\nCombining these steps, we can write the recurrence relation for the time complexity as:\nT(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + O(1)\nT(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c (where c is a constant for the non-recursive work)\n\nThis relation holds regardless of the input data, so the worst-case, average-case, and best-case complexities are all the same.\n\n### Solving the Recurrence\n\nWe can solve this recurrence by expansion:\n*   T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c\n*   T(n) = 2 * [2 * T(n - 2) + c] + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c\n*   T(n) = 4 * [2 * T(n - 3) + c] + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c\n*   ...after k steps...\n*   T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)\n\nIf we let k = n - 1, we get:\n*   T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)\n*   T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c + c * 2^(n-1) - c\n*   T(n) = 2c * 2^(n-1) - c = c * 2^n - c\n\nThe dominant term in this expression is c * 2^n. Therefore, the time complexity is O(2^n). This exponential growth is due to each function call branching into two subproblems of a size that only decreases by one.\n\nComparing this result to the given answer choices:\nA. O(n)\nB. O(n log n)\nC. O(n^2)\nD. O(n^3)\nE. O(2^n)\nF. does not terminate\n\nThe calculated time complexity matches option E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
