    "The reaction shown is the acid-catalyzed dehydration of friedelan-3β-ol. This process initiates a complex series of intramolecular rearrangements known as a backbone rearrangement, which is common for pentacyclic triterpenoids. The reaction proceeds through the following steps:\n\n1.  **Protonation and Dehydration:** The hydroxyl group at C-3 is protonated by the catalytic acid (HCl) and subsequently eliminated as a water molecule. This generates a secondary carbocation at the C-3 position.\n\n2.  **Carbocation Rearrangements:** To achieve a more stable state, the molecule undergoes a cascade of-hydride (H⁻) and-methyl (CH₃⁻) shifts. This sequence is as follows:\n    *   A methyl group migrates from C-4 to C-3.\n    *   A hydride migrates from C-5 to C-4.\n    *   A methyl group migrates from C-10 to C-5.\n    *   A hydride migrates from C-9 to C-10.\n    *   A methyl group migrates from C-8 to C-9.\n    *   A methyl group migrates from C-14 to C-8.\n    *   A hydride migrates from C-13 to C-14, leaving a stable tertiary carbocation at C-13.\n\n3.  **Elimination:** Finally, a proton is removed from C-18, adjacent to the C-13 carbocation, to form the final alkene product, friedel-13(18)-ene.\n\nBased on this well-established mechanism, the identities of the substituents at the numbered positions in the final product are determined by tracking which group has migrated to that position or remained there.\n\n*   **Position 1 (at C-4):** This position originally held two methyl groups. One migrated to C-3, while the other remained. Thus, **1 = CH₃**.\n*   **Position 2 (at C-10):** This position originally had a methyl group, which migrated away. It was replaced by a hydride that shifted from C-9. Thus, **2 = H**.\n*   **Position 3 (at C-9):** This position originally held a hydrogen atom, which migrated away. It was replaced by a methyl group that shifted from C-8. Thus, **3 = CH₃**.\n*   **Position 4 (at C-8):** This position's original methyl group migrated to C-9. It was then replaced by a methyl group that shifted from C-14. Thus, **4 = CH₃**.\n*   **Position 5 (at C-14):** The original methyl group at this position migrated to C-8. It was replaced by a hydride that shifted from C-13. Thus, **5 = H**.\n\nTherefore, the final substitution pattern is:\n\n1 = CH₃, 2 = H, 3 = CH₃, 4 = CH₃, 5 = H\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
