    "The cuneiform sign shown is íÇç (√â), which in Sumerian means \"house\" or \"temple\". The image provided is a representation of this sign as it would have appeared in the third millennium BCE. An image on Wikipedia showing the evolution of this sign from a relief in Ur dated to 2500 BCE strongly corresponds to the drawing in the question.\n\nThe Sumerian term √â.GAL (íÇçíÉ≤), literally \"big house,\" was used to denote a city's main building or palace. The word for a scribal school, \"edubba,\" is a compound of the Sumerian words for \"house\" (√©) and \"tablet\" (dub). The significance of this sign is further seen in its use as a determinative or logogram in the names of many temples, such as the E-sag-il (\"temple that raises its head\"), the temple of Marduk in Babylon.\n\nTherefore, the correct meaning of the cuneiform sign is \"Home\".\n\n<<<D>>>"
