    "This image displays the kinase domain of the chicken proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src. The structure is identified in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the ID 1O4H.\n\nSrc is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that is crucial for regulating various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, motility, and survival. It is composed of several domains: an N-terminal myristoyl group, a unique segment, an SH3 domain, an SH2 domain, a protein-tyrosine kinase domain, and a C-terminal regulatory tail. The image shows the kinase domain (in dark blue) in a complex with an N-terminal segment (in light blue).\n\nThe activity of Src is tightly regulated. Phosphorylation at a specific site, Tyr527, by the C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) leads to an inactive state. In this inhibited conformation, the SH2 domain binds to the phosphorylated tail, and the SH3 domain interacts with the kinase domain, stabilizing a dormant state. Dephosphorylation of this site results in the activation of the kinase.\n\n<<<chicken Src protein kinase>>>"
