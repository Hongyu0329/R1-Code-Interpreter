    "Based on the recurring annual spikes and the timing of major peaks in the Google Trends data, the country in question is the United States. The three historical events represented by the colored lines can be identified by their patterns of search interest.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the events:\n*   **The red line represents the attack on Pearl Harbor.** This is indicated by the consistent, sharp spike in search interest that occurs in early December each year, corresponding with the anniversary of the December 7, 1941 event.\n*   **The blue line signifies the D-Day landings in Normandy.** This event, which took place on June 6, 1944, shows smaller but regular peaks in search interest around the beginning of June each year, aligning with its anniversary.\n*   **The yellow line corresponds to the War in Afghanistan.** This is evidenced by several key peaks. A massive spike is visible around August 2021, which aligns with the intense global interest in the fall of Kabul and the withdrawal of U.S. troops. Another significant peak occurs around Memorial Day in May 2023. This holiday is a time of remembrance for fallen soldiers, and the recent conclusion of the long war in Afghanistan would have made it a prominent subject of searches and reflection.\n\nThese three events are cornerstones of modern American history, and the patterns of public search interest on their anniversaries and during related major news events confirm their identity on the graph.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
