    "Based on the analysis of the provided sheet music, the opera is Alban Berg's \"Wozzeck\".\n\nThe key indicators in the score that lead to this conclusion are:\n\n*   **Atonal Language:** The music is highly chromatic and atonal, which is characteristic of the Second Viennese School, of which Alban Berg was a prominent member.\n*   **Instrumentation:** The score calls for a large orchestra, including parts for English horn and detailed divisi for the strings (e.g., \"1. Pult,\" \"2. Pult,\" \"Solo Br.\").\n*   **German Annotations:** The instructions in the score, such as \"2. Akt\" (Act 2), \"Vorhang\" (Curtain), \"(mit Dämpfer)\" (with mute), and the instrument names are all in German.\n*   **Specific Musical Features:** The opening of Act II of *Wozzeck* begins with a short orchestral introduction before the curtain rises, matching the \"Vorhang\" marking. The agitated string glissandi and the dense, complex textures are hallmarks of Berg's expressionistic style as found in this opera.\n\nA search for the score of Alban Berg's *Wozzeck* confirms that this exact music opens the second act of the opera. The opera, composed between 1914 and 1922, is based on the play *Woyzeck* by Georg Büchner and is considered a landmark of 20th-century music.\n\n<<<Wozzeck>>>"
