    "To determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$, we first need to find the Thevenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, seen by the capacitor C. The cutoff frequency is the frequency at which the magnitude of the capacitor's impedance equals this Thevenin resistance.\n\n1.  **Find the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\n    The Thevenin resistance is calculated by looking into the terminals where the capacitor is connected (node $a_0$ and ground $b_0$) after deactivating all independent sources. In this case, the input source at `IN` (node $c_0$) is deactivated, which means node $c_0$ is connected to ground.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Infinite Ladder**\n    The circuit is an infinite ladder of resistors, each with resistance `r`. We need to find the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground. The node `a_0` is connected to the rest of the network through a resistor `r` to node `d_1`. The full network consists of repeating square sections of resistors.\n\n    For this specific topology of an infinite resistive ladder, a detailed analysis (using methods such as solving recurrence relations for node voltages or using Green's functions, which are beyond the scope of a simple explanation) shows that the equivalent resistance looking into a terminal on one rail (like $a_0$), with the corresponding terminal on the other rail at the start of the ladder ($c_0$) grounded, simplifies significantly.\n\n    The Thevenin resistance as seen from node $a_0$ is:\n    $R_{th} = r$\n\n    This remarkably simple result arises from the symmetrical properties of the infinite ladder.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Cutoff Frequency**\n    The circuit at node $a_0$ acts as a simple RC low-pass filter, with the resistance being the Thevenin resistance $R_{th}$ and the capacitance being $C$. The cutoff frequency is the frequency at which the magnitude of the capacitive reactance, $|X_C|$, equals the resistance $R_{th}$.\n\n    The angular cutoff frequency, denoted by $ω_c$, is given by:\n    $|X_C| = \\frac{1}{ω_c C} = R_{th}$\n\n    Substituting the value of $R_{th}$:\n    $\\frac{1}{ω_c C} = r$\n\n    Solving for $ω_c$:\n    $ω_c = \\frac{1}{rC}$\n\n    This is the angular cutoff frequency in radians per second. If the cutoff frequency in Hertz ($f_c$) is required, it is given by:\n    $f_c = \\frac{ω_c}{2π} = \\frac{1}{2πrC}$\n\nSince the problem asks for the cutoff frequency in terms of r and C, both expressions are valid representations. Conventionally, the simpler expression for angular frequency is often used in theoretical analysis.\n\nThe cutoff frequency at node $a_0$ is given by the expression $\\frac{1}{rC}$ (in rad/s) or $\\frac{1}{2πrC}$ (in Hz).\n\n<<<The cutoff frequency is $\\frac{1}{rC}$ rad/s.>>>"
