The reaction of tris(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)methylium ion with 0.1 M HCl under reflux for 12 hours results in the formation of a polycyclic aromatic cation through a combination of demethylation and intramolecular cyclization. The harsh acidic conditions first cleave the six methoxy ether groups to form six hydroxyl (phenolic) groups. Simultaneously, the central carbocation acts as a powerful electrophile, attacking the activated phenyl rings in an intramolecular electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. This process occurs three times, leading to a fully cyclized and planar structure. The final product, Compound A, is **1,2,6,7,11,12-hexahydroxytribenzotriquinacene**. This molecule is a highly stable, D3h-symmetric, polycyclic aromatic cation.

The structure of Compound A is:
