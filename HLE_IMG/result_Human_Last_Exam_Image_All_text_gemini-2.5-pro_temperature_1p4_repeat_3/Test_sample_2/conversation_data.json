    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Structure**\n    The provided algorithm `sort(a, n)` is a recursive function. Let's break down its logic.\n    -   **Base Case:** The recursion stops when `n <= 1`. An array of size 1 or 0 is considered sorted. This takes constant time.\n    -   **Recursive Step (`n > 1`):**\n        1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: It first calls itself to sort the prefix of the array of size `n-1` (i.e., elements `a[0]` through `a[n-2]`).\n        2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: It then compares the last element of the current sub-array (`a[n-1]`) with the second to last element (`a[n-2]`).\n        3.  If the condition is true, it means the element at `a[n-1]` is out of place. It performs a `swap`.\n        4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: Because the swap may have disrupted the sorted order of the prefix `a[0...n-2]`, it calls `sort(a, n - 1)` again to re-sort this prefix.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time complexity of the algorithm for an input of size `n`.\n    -   The first call `sort(a, n - 1)` has a cost of `T(n-1)`.\n    -   The comparison `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` and the `swap` operation take constant time, which we can denote as `c` or `O(1)`.\n    -   The second call `sort(a, n - 1)` (which only occurs if the `if` condition is met) also has a cost of `T(n-1)`.\n\n    We are interested in the **worst-case** complexity. The worst case occurs when the `if` condition is true, as this triggers the second recursive call, maximizing the amount of work done.\n    Therefore, the worst-case recurrence relation is:\n    `T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-1) + O(1)`\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n\n    The base case is `T(1) = O(1)`, which we can denote as a constant `d`.\n\n3.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation**\n    Let's solve `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c` by expansion:\n    -   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n    -   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 2^2 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n    -   `T(n) = 2^2 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 2c + c = 2^3 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    -   ... after `k` expansions ...\n    -   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^{k-1} + 2^{k-2} + ... + 2^0)`\n\n    We expand until we reach the base case `T(1)`. Let `k = n-1`.\n    -   `T(n) = 2^{n-1} * T(1) + c * (2^{n-2} + ... + 1)`\n    The sum `1 + 2 + ... + 2^{n-2}` is a geometric series with sum `(2^{n-1} - 1) / (2-1) = 2^{n-1} - 1`.\n    -   `T(n) = 2^{n-1} * T(1) + c * (2^{n-1} - 1)`\n    Since `T(1)` is a constant `d`:\n    -   `T(n) = d * 2^{n-1} + c * 2^{n-1} - c`\n    -   `T(n) = (d + c) * 2^{n-1} - c`\n\n    The dominant term in this expression is `2^{n-1}`. In Big-O notation, we ignore constants and lower-order terms.\n    Therefore, `T(n) = O(2^{n-1}) = O(2^n)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n-   **Termination:** The recursive calls are always on a smaller problem size (`n-1`). Since `n` decreases by 1 at each step, it will eventually reach the base case `n=1`. Thus, the algorithm always terminates.\n-   **Worst-Case Input:** Does an input exist that actually triggers the worst-case behavior at every step? Yes. A reverse-sorted array (e.g., `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`) is a good candidate. For `sort(a, k)`, the first `sort(a, k-1)` call will sort the prefix, then the smallest element (`a[k-1]`) will be compared against the largest element of the prefix (`a[k-2]`), triggering the swap and the second recursive call. This ensures the worst-case path is taken.\n-   **Correctness:** The algorithm correctly sorts the array. The first call `sort(a, n-1)` sorts the prefix. The `if` block then correctly places the `n`-th element relative to the `(n-1)`-th. If a swap happens, the new element at `a[n-2]` might be smaller than other elements in the prefix, so the second `sort(a, n-1)` call is necessary to re-establish the sorted order of the prefix.\n-   **Comparison with other complexities:** `O(n^2)` (like Bubble Sort), `O(n log n)` (like Merge Sort), and `O(n)` are all much faster than `O(2^n)`. This algorithm is extremely inefficient due to its recursive structure where work is re-done unnecessarily.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe worst-case time complexity is described by the recurrence `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c`, which resolves to `O(2^n)`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
