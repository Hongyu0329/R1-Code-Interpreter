    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval from the provided graph.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph**\nThe image is a raster plot showing neuronal firing activity over time.\n*   **X-axis:** Time, measured in seconds (s), from 0 to 50 s.\n*   **Y-axis:** Electrode Number, representing 128 different recording sites in the neuronal culture.\n*   **Data Points:** Each black dot signifies an action potential (a \"spike\" or firing) detected at a specific electrode at a specific time.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts**\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a period where a large number of neurons fire in a coordinated and rapid fashion. In the raster plot, these appear as dense vertical bands of dots, indicating high firing activity across many electrodes at roughly the same time. We need to identify the time at which the center of each of these major bursts occurs.\n\nBy visually inspecting the plot, we can identify five prominent synchronized bursts:\n*   **Burst 1:** The first major burst is centered at approximately **t₁ = 3 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The second burst is clearly centered at **t₂ = 15 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** The third burst is centered at approximately **t₃ = 27 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** The fourth burst is centered at approximately **t₄ = 36 s**.\n*   **Burst 5:** The final prominent burst is centered near the end of the recording at approximately **t₅ = 49 s**.\n\n**Careful point:** The exact center of a burst can be subjective. The key is to be consistent in estimating the center of the dense activity for each event. The chosen timestamps represent a reasonable estimation of the peak of the network-wide firing for each burst.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time that elapses between the centers of two consecutive bursts. With 5 identified bursts, we can calculate 4 intervals.\n\n*   **Interval 1 (IBI₁):** Time between Burst 2 and Burst 1 = t₂ - t₁ = 15 s - 3 s = **12 s**.\n*   **Interval 2 (IBI₂):** Time between Burst 3 and Burst 2 = t₃ - t₂ = 27 s - 15 s = **12 s**.\n*   **Interval 3 (IBI₃):** Time between Burst 4 and Burst 3 = t₄ - t₃ = 36 s - 27 s = **9 s**.\n*   **Interval 4 (IBI₄):** Time between Burst 5 and Burst 4 = t₅ - t₄ = 49 s - 36 s = **13 s**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual intervals and divide by the number of intervals.\n\n*   **Sum of intervals:** 12 s + 12 s + 9 s + 13 s = 46 s\n*   **Number of intervals:** 4\n*   **Average IBI:** 46 s / 4 = **11.5 s**\n\n**Step 5: Round to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question requires the answer to be given to two significant figures.\n*   The calculated average is 11.5.\n*   The first two significant figures are 1 and 1.\n*   The third digit is 5. According to standard rounding rules, we round the preceding digit up.\n*   Therefore, 11.5 rounded to two significant figures is **12**.\n\nThe identified timestamps of the synchronized bursts are approximately 3 s, 15 s, 27 s, 36 s, and 49 s. The average inter-burst interval is 12 s.\n\n<<<12>>>"
