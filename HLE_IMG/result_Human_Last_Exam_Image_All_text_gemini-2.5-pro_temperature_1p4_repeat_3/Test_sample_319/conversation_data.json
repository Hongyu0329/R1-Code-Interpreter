    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the provided image.**\nThe image consists of two plots, one above the other.\n*   **Top Plot (Spectrogram):** This plot shows the frequency content of a sound over time. We can see a thin, continuous horizontal line, which represents a pure tone of a constant frequency. In the middle of the plot, this line is interrupted and replaced by a short, vertical, wider band. This vertical band represents a burst of sound containing a wide range of frequencies, which is characteristic of noise. This visual representation suggests a pure tone is playing, is then replaced by a burst of noise, and then resumes.\n*   **Bottom Plot (Waveform):** This plot shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time. On the left, we see a regular, smooth, oscillating patternâ€”a sine wave, which is the waveform of a pure tone. In the middle, the waveform becomes complex and irregular, which is the waveform for noise. Then, on the right, the sine wave pattern resumes. A careful look shows that the noise is actually *added on top* of the continuing sine wave, rather than replacing it entirely. However, the perceptual effect described happens even when the tone is completely removed and replaced by noise. This setup is a classic stimulus for demonstrating the illusion.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the question's description.**\nThe question provides several key clues:\n*   **It's an illusion:** The perception does not match the physical reality of the stimulus. In this case, one hears a continuous tone even when it's masked or replaced by noise.\n*   **Similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity:** The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where an ambiguous 2D drawing is perceived as a 3D cube. The brain can \"flip\" between two stable interpretations of its orientation. The similarity lies in the brain's active role in constructing a coherent and stable perception from incomplete or ambiguous sensory input.\n*   **Reveals a \"surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\":** This refers to the brain's ability to fill in missing information. We use this constantly in daily life to understand speech in noisy rooms or to perceive a melody as continuous even if briefly interrupted. It's a fundamental process of auditory scene analysis that usually happens automatically without our awareness.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the analysis.**\nThe visual stimulus (a tone interrupted by noise) and the description point to a specific type of auditory illusion. This illusion is about the perceptual \"restoration\" or \"completion\" of a sound that has been interrupted or masked. When the brain is presented with a tone that stops and is immediately followed by a burst of noise, and then the tone resumes, the auditory system often infers that the tone must have continued *behind* the noise. The result is the perception of an uninterrupted tone. This perceptual \"filling-in\" is the illusion.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the name of the phenomenon.**\nThis well-documented psychoacoustic phenomenon is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion** or **Tonal Continuity**. When the sound being restored is speech, it is often called the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**. The general principle is a form of perceptual completion or auditory induction. The most accurate and encompassing name for the phenomenon as depicted and described is the Auditory Continuity Illusion.\n\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion>>>"
