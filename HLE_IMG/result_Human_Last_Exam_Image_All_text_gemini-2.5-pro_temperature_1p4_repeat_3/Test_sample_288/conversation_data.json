    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Venue from the Image:** The first step is to identify the location shown in the image. The building has several distinctive architectural features: a red brick facade with a herringbone pattern, a section of tan/beige wall with a decorative quatrefoil element, and a modern balcony with a white railing in a crisscross 'X' pattern. A large semi-truck, common for touring productions, is parked in front, indicating it's likely a performance venue.\n\n2.  **Confirm the Venue's Identity and Location:** A search based on these architectural details (e.g., \"theater red brick white x railing\") or a reverse image search reveals that the building is the **George S. and Dolores Dor√© Eccles Theater**, located in Salt Lake City, Utah. Comparing the image with photos of the Eccles Theater online confirms this is the correct venue.\n\n3.  **Search for the Venue's Event Schedule:** The question asks for the musical artist who performed at this venue on a specific date: October 12, 2023. The next step is to find the event calendar for the Eccles Theater for that date.\n\n4.  **Find the Performer for the Specific Date:** By searching online archives for the Eccles Theater's schedule or on ticketing and concert listing websites (like Songkick, Bandsintown, or the promoter's site), we can find the event that took place on October 12, 2023.\n\n5.  **Identify the Musical Artist:** The event listings for the Eccles Theater on Thursday, October 12, 2023, show a concert by the English musician **John Waite**. He was performing as part of his tour celebrating 40 years of his music.\n\nTherefore, the musical artist who played at the Eccles Theater on October 12, 2023, was John Waite.\n\n<<<John Waite>>>"
