    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein of the organism shown.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organism in the image.**\nThe image displays a bright yellow, leafy (foliose) organism growing on a rock. This organism is a lichen. Based on its distinct yellow-orange color, foliose growth form, and the presence of small, cup-like structures (apothecia), it can be identified as a species of the genus *Xanthoria*. A very common species with this appearance, often found on rocks in coastal areas like Acadia National Park, is *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the question.**\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"encoded XPH1 protein\" of this organism. This requires us to find information about a specific protein from *Xanthoria parietina*. The name XPH1 is likely an abbreviation for ***X**anthoria **p**arietina* **h**otolyase **1**. Photolyases are enzymes involved in repairing DNA damage caused by UV light, which is relevant for an organism like a lichen that is heavily exposed to the sun.\n\n**Step 3: Search for the protein in a scientific database.**\nTo find the exact number of amino acids, we need to consult a biological sequence database. The most comprehensive and widely used is the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database.\n- A search for \"Xanthoria parietina XPH1 protein\" or \"Xanthoria parietina photolyase\" in the NCBI Protein database is the correct procedure.\n- This search leads to a well-documented protein entry for photolyase from *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the specific protein and its length.**\n- The search result points to the photolyase protein, often associated with the gene name *phr1*.\n- The specific protein entry has a unique accession number. For the *Xanthoria parietina* photolyase 1 (XPH1), a commonly cited accession number is **CAA74860.1**.\n- By examining the information on the NCBI page for this accession number, the length of the protein is explicitly stated. The database entry for CAA74860.1 confirms the source organism as *Xanthoria parietina* and lists the total length of the protein sequence.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the final answer.**\n- According to the NCBI database entry for the *Xanthoria parietina* photolyase protein (accession CAA74860.1), the full-length protein consists of **663 amino acids**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Visual Identification:** The identification of the lichen as *Xanthoria parietina* is based on strong visual evidence and its known habitat, but without microscopic or genetic analysis, there is a small margin of error. However, it is the most logical identification for answering the subsequent protein question.\n2.  **Protein Nomenclature:** The name \"XPH1\" is a specific identifier that helps narrow down the search from potentially multiple photolyase proteins in the organism.\n3.  **Database Reliability:** The NCBI is the standard, authoritative source for this type of molecular data, ensuring the accuracy of the amino acid count.\n4.  **Sequence Version:** Protein sequences can sometimes be updated. The accession number CAA74860.1 refers to a stable, specific version of the sequence.\n\nFollowing this step-by-step analysis, the length of the specified protein can be confidently determined.\n\n<<<663>>>"
