**Product A:** The structure is methyl 7-acetyl-6-(pyrrolidin-2-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolizine-1-carboxylate. It is a fused 5/5 ring system (dihydropyrrolizine). The nitrogen atom of the fused system is acetylated. At the position adjacent to the nitrogen, there is a C=C double bond within the five-membered ring. This double bond is substituted with the methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH3) and a proton. The other carbon atom adjacent to the nitrogen is substituted with a pyrrolidin-2-yl group.

**Product B:** The structure is methyl 1-acetyl-5-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxylate. It is a five-membered pyrrole ring. The nitrogen of the pyrrole ring is acetylated. At position C2, there is a methyl carboxylate group (-COOCH3). At position C5, there is a 2-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl) substituent. The protons at C3 and C4 of the pyrrole ring account for the vinyl doublets.

**Product C:** The structure is N-acetyl-2-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid. This is the starting material with the secondary amine on the pyrrolidine ring acetylated.
