    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the characters on the seal:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the nature of a seal.**\nA seal is carved in reverse, like a mirror image. To read its content, we must mentally flip the image horizontally to visualize what the impression on paper would look like. The traditional reading order for Chinese seals is from right to left, and from top to bottom.\n\n**Step 2: Flip the image and analyze the characters.**\nAfter flipping the image horizontally, we can analyze the four characters in their correct orientation. We will read them in the standard order: top-right, bottom-right, top-left, bottom-left.\n\n*   **Top-Right Character:** This character is 壽 (shòu). It is a stylized character often seen in calligraphy and seals, symbolizing longevity and a long life.\n*   **Bottom-Right Character:** This character is 康 (kāng). It means health and well-being.\n*   **Top-Left Character:** This character is 寧 (níng). It means peace, tranquility, or serenity.\n*   **Bottom-Left Character:** This character is 福 (fú). It represents blessings, fortune, and happiness.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the characters and convert to Simplified Chinese.**\nReading the characters in the correct order gives the traditional Chinese phrase 壽康寧福 (Shòu Kāng Níng Fú). This is a common four-character auspicious greeting, wishing someone longevity, health, peace, and blessings.\n\nNow, we convert these traditional characters to their simplified forms:\n*   壽 becomes 寿\n*   康 remains 康\n*   寧 becomes 宁\n*   福 remains 福\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion.**\nThe characters on the seal, when read in the proper order and converted to simplified Chinese, are 寿, 康, 宁, and 福. They form the auspicious phrase \"寿康宁福\".\n\n<<<寿康宁福>>>"
