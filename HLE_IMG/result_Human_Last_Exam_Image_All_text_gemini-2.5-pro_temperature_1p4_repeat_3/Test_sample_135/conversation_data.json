    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Artwork's Style and Medium:** The image displays a bas-relief sculpture set within a circular frame, known as a tondo. The material appears to be white glazed terracotta, a technique famously pioneered and popularized by the Della Robbia family workshop in Florence during the Italian Renaissance. The elegant composition, the graceful rendering of the figures, and their serene expressions are all hallmarks of this school.\n\n2.  **Identify the Subject Matter:** The scene depicts a religious ceremony. A priest, standing at an altar, is administering the Eucharist (Holy Communion) to a group of kneeling figures, including adults (who appear to be monks or friars) and a child. This theme is often referred to as \"The Sacrament of the Altar.\"\n\n3.  **Examine the Inscription:** At the bottom of the tondo, there is a partially visible inscription. The clearer crops show the text \"SACRAMENT DE L'AUTEL.\" This phrase is French for \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" confirming the subject matter.\n\n4.  **Connect the Clues:** The combination of the Della Robbia style (glazed terracotta) and the French inscription provides a crucial link. While the Della Robbia family was based in Florence, one of its members, **Girolamo della Robbia** (1488–1566), son of Andrea della Robbia, spent a large part of his career working in France. He was invited to the court of King Francis I and produced many works for the French monarchy.\n\n5.  **Identify the Specific Artwork and Author:** A search for \"Girolamo della Robbia\" and \"Sacrament de l'autel\" confirms the attribution. This tondo is a known work by Girolamo della Robbia. It is a predella panel (a panel from the base of an altarpiece) from an altarpiece he created, likely for the chapel of the Château de Cognac, around 1515-1520. The piece is now located at the Musée national de la Renaissance at the Château d'Écouen in France.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the distinctive glazed terracotta technique, the Florentine Renaissance style, and the French inscription pointing to a commission in France, the author of this altarpiece detail is Girolamo della Robbia.\n\n<<<Girolamo della Robbia>>>"
