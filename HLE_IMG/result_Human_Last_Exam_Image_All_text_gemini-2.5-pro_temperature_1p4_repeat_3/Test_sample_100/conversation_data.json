    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and determine its molecular formula.**\n*   The starting material is a bicyclic compound containing a lactam (cyclic amide), an alkene with a trifluoromethyl (CF₃) group, and a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group attached to the nitrogen atom.\n*   Let's count the atoms to find its molecular formula:\n    *   **Carbons (C):**\n        *   Bicyclic ring system (including the carbonyl carbon C3): 6 C\n        *   Trifluoromethyl group (CF₃): 1 C\n        *   PMB group (-CH₂-C₆H₄-OCH₃): Benzyl CH₂ (1 C) + Phenyl ring (6 C) + Methoxy CH₃ (1 C) = 8 C\n        *   Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 8 = 15 C\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):**\n        *   Bicyclic ring system: There are hydrogens at C1, C4, C6, and two at C7. Total = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5 H\n        *   PMB group: CH₂ (2 H) + C₆H₄ (4 H) + OCH₃ (3 H) = 9 H\n        *   Total Hydrogens = 5 + 9 = 14 H\n    *   **Fluorines (F):** 3 F from the CF₃ group.\n    *   **Nitrogens (N):** 1 N in the lactam ring.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** 1 O in the carbonyl group and 1 O in the methoxy group of PMB. Total = 2 O.\n*   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction to find the formula of Intermediate 1.**\n*   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H₂O.\n*   **Reaction:** CAN is a standard reagent for the oxidative deprotection of PMB groups from amines and alcohols. The PMB group is removed from the nitrogen.\n*   **Transformation:** The N-PMB bond is cleaved, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen, forming an N-H bond. The PMB group has a formula of -C₈H₉O. The transformation replaces -C₈H₉O with -H.\n*   **Change in formula:** -C₈H₉O + H = -C₈H₈O.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 1:** C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂ - C₈H₈O = **C₇H₆F₃NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction to find the formula of Intermediate 2.**\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H₂ in MeOH.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C).\n*   **Transformation:** The C=C double bond in the bicyclic ring is reduced. This involves the addition of two hydrogen atoms (H₂).\n*   **Change in formula:** + H₂.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 2:** C₇H₆F₃NO + H₂ = **C₇H₈F₃NO**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third reaction to find the formula of the final Product.**\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 °C.\n*   **Reaction:** These are harsh acidic conditions with heat, which cause the hydrolysis of amides. The substrate, Intermediate 2, is a lactam (a cyclic amide).\n*   **Transformation:** The lactam ring is opened by adding a water molecule (H₂O) across the C-N amide bond. This cleavage forms a carboxylic acid (-COOH) from the carbonyl group and an amino group (-NH₂) from the nitrogen atom.\n*   **Change in formula:** + H₂O.\n*   **Formula of Product:** C₇H₈F₃NO + H₂O = **C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂**.\n\nThe resulting product is an amino acid with a cyclopentane backbone, having the molecular formula C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
