    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Concept of Rotational Symmetry**\nRotational symmetry describes how many times an object or pattern looks identical when rotated through a full 360 degrees. The \"order\" of rotational symmetry is this number. For example, a square has 4-fold rotational symmetry because it looks the same after rotations of 90°, 180°, and 270°.\n\n**Step 2: Visually Inspect the Tiling for Symmetric Motifs**\nThe tiling is a complex pattern made of several distinct shapes:\n*   Dark blue regular hexagons.\n*   Light yellow squares.\n*   Orange rhombi (diamond shapes).\n*   Light yellow non-convex shapes (often called \"bow-ties\" or \"darts\").\n\nWe need to find points in the pattern around which we can rotate the entire tiling and have it map perfectly onto itself. Good places to look are the centers of the most symmetric-looking shapes or arrangements.\n\n**Step 3: Test Potential Centers of Rotation**\n\n*   **Analysis of the 5-Pointed Stars:**\n    *   **Observation:** There are prominent star-shaped motifs in the pattern. Let's focus on one near the center of the image. This star is formed by five orange rhombi and five light-yellow \"bow-tie\" shapes radiating from a single point.\n    *   **Test:** If we place a rotation point at the center of this star and rotate the entire tiling, will it look the same? Let's try rotating by 360° / 5 = 72°. Upon rotation by 72°, each orange rhombus moves into the position previously occupied by the next orange rhombus, and each yellow \"bow-tie\" moves into the position of the next \"bow-tie\". The surrounding pattern also aligns perfectly.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This confirms the existence of **5-fold rotational symmetry** at the centers of these star motifs.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Dark Blue Hexagons:**\n    *   **Observation:** The dark blue hexagons are regular hexagons, which by themselves have 6-fold symmetry. However, we must consider the entire tiling. Each hexagon is surrounded by six of the light-yellow \"bow-tie\" shapes.\n    *   **Test:** Let's try rotating by 360° / 6 = 60° around the hexagon's center. This would map the hexagon onto itself. However, looking at the tiles just beyond the \"bow-ties\", we see that they alternate between light yellow squares and orange rhombi. A 60° rotation would attempt to map a square onto a rhombus, which fails because they are different shapes/colors. Therefore, the tiling does not have 6-fold symmetry.\n    *   **Test for lower symmetry:** Let's try a 360° / 3 = 120° rotation. This rotation maps each square to the next square and each rhombus to the next rhombus in the ring surrounding the hexagon. This works.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The tiling has **3-fold rotational symmetry** at the centers of the dark blue hexagons.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Light Yellow Squares:**\n    *   **Observation:** The light yellow squares are standard squares.\n    *   **Test:** Rotating by 360° / 4 = 90° around the center of a square maps the square onto itself. The surrounding arrangement of orange rhombi and yellow \"bow-ties\" is also symmetrical under a 90° rotation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The tiling has **4-fold rotational symmetry** at the centers of the light yellow squares.\n\n**Step 4: Determine \"the\" Rotational Symmetry**\nThe tiling exhibits several different orders of rotational symmetry at different points (it also has 2-fold symmetry at other points). When a question asks for \"the\" rotational symmetry of such a pattern, it usually refers to the highest order of symmetry present, or the most characteristic one.\n\nThe presence of 5-fold rotational symmetry is particularly significant. According to the Crystallographic Restriction Theorem, a pattern that repeats periodically (like standard wallpaper) cannot have 5-fold rotational symmetry. This means the image shows an **aperiodic tiling**, also known as a quasicrystal. The 5-fold symmetry is its most defining and highest-order rotational feature.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe tiling has centers of 3-fold, 4-fold, and 5-fold rotational symmetry. The highest order of rotational symmetry found in the pattern is 5-fold.\n\n<<<5-fold rotational symmetry>>>"
