    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of splice species from the provided RT-PCR results.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Experimental Setup\nThe image displays results from Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) experiments. This technique detects specific mRNA transcripts (splice species).\n*   **Figure A (Genome Map):** Shows the layout of genes (E6, E7, E1, etc.) and the locations of primers used for PCR. The primers are designed to amplify specific regions of the transcripts.\n*   **Key Primers:**\n    *   Forward Primers: E1F1 (general early region), E1F2 (specific to 929^3465 splice), E1F3 (specific to 929^3506 splice).\n    *   Reverse Primers: E4R, E5R (detect \"early\" transcripts terminating at A_E), L2R (detects transcripts reading through A_E), L1R (detects \"late\" transcripts terminating at A_L).\n*   **Goal:** Each distinct band on the gel that results from a unique combination of splicing events and primer pairs represents a distinct splice species. We need to count all of them.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each RT-PCR Panel Individually\n\nWe will go through each panel and count the number of unique splice species identified.\n\n*   **Panel B: E1F1/E4R**\n    *   **Observation:** Two distinct bands are visible (band 1: 190 bp, band 2: 159 bp).\n    *   **Analysis:** This primer pair amplifies early transcripts. The two bands indicate two different splice variants in this region, differing by 31 bp. These are our first two splice species.\n    *   **Species Count:** 2\n\n*   **Panel C: E1F1/E5R**\n    *   **Observation:** Two bands (band 1: 584 bp, band 2: 553 bp), also differing by 31 bp.\n    *   **Analysis:** This confirms the existence of the two species found in Panel B, using a different reverse primer (E5R) in the same general region. It does not reveal any *new* species.\n    *   **Cumulative Species Count:** 2\n\n*   **Panel D: E1F2/E5R**\n    *   **Observation:** One distinct band (551 bp).\n    *   **Analysis:** The primer E1F2 is specific for transcripts containing the `929^3465` splice. The presence of this band identifies a new species characterized by this specific splice. It is distinct from the two found in Panel B.\n    *   **Cumulative Species Count:** 2 + 1 = 3\n\n*   **Panel E: E1F1/L2R**\n    *   **Observation:** One distinct band (1,005 bp).\n    *   **Analysis:** The reverse primer L2R is downstream of the early polyadenylation site (A_E). A product here means the transcript has \"read through\" the early stop signal. This read-through transcript is a different molecule than the early ones detected by E4R/E5R. Therefore, this represents a new species.\n    *   **Cumulative Species Count:** 3 + 1 = 4\n\n*   **Panel F: E1F2/L2R**\n    *   **Observation:** One distinct band (972 bp).\n    *   **Analysis:** This combines the features of panels D and E. It's a read-through transcript (detected by L2R) that also contains the specific `929^3465` splice (detected by E1F2). This unique combination makes it a distinct species.\n    *   **Cumulative Species Count:** 4 + 1 = 5\n\n*   **Panel G: E1F3/L2R**\n    *   **Observation:** Two distinct bands (band 1: 1,003 bp, band 2: 931 bp).\n    *   **Analysis:** The primer E1F3 is specific for a different splice junction (`929^3506`). This identifies a new class of transcripts. The fact that there are two bands shows that this class undergoes further alternative splicing (a 72 bp difference). These are two new, distinct species.\n    *   **Cumulative Species Count:** 5 + 2 = 7\n\n*   **Panel H: E1F1/L1R (20 cycles)**\n    *   **Observation:** Two distinct bands (band 1: 450 bp, band 2: 419 bp).\n    *   **Analysis:** The L1R primer detects \"late\" transcripts that use the late polyadenylation site (A_L). These are different from the \"early\" (Panel B/C/D) and \"read-through\" (Panel E/F/G) transcripts. The two bands show that late transcripts also exhibit the 31 bp alternative splice seen in the early transcripts (Panel B). These two late variants are distinct species.\n    *   **Cumulative Species Count:** 7 + 2 = 9\n\n*   **Panel I: E1F1/L1R (30 cycles)**\n    *   **Observation:** Four distinct bands (450 bp, 419 bp, 378 bp, and 187 bp).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a more sensitive amplification of the late transcripts from Panel H. It confirms the two species already counted (from the 450 bp and 419 bp bands). Importantly, it reveals two additional, less abundant late splice variants (the 378 bp and 187 bp bands). These are two new species.\n    *   **Cumulative Species Count:** 9 + 2 = 11\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBy systematically analyzing each experiment, we have identified a unique set of transcripts based on different splice junctions, alternative splicing events, and different 3' end processing (early, read-through, and late polyadenylation).\n\nThe total number of unique splice species found is the sum of all distinct species identified across all panels:\n*   Panel B: 2 species\n*   Panel D: 1 new species\n*   Panel E: 1 new species\n*   Panel F: 1 new species\n*   Panel G: 2 new species\n*   Panel H: 2 new species\n*   Panel I: 2 new species\n\nTotal = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 11.\n\nThere are 11 distinct splice species identifiable from the provided RT-PCR data.\n\n<<<11>>>"
