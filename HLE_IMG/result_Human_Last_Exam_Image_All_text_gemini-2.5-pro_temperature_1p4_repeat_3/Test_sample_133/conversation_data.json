    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Weight and Presence of Halogens**\n1.  **Identify the Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak:** The peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) appear to be in a cluster starting around m/z 260. The peaks are at m/z 260 (I=34.8%), 262 (I=29.0%), 264 (I=12.9%), and 266 (I=3.22%). This characteristic pattern of peaks separated by 2 mass units (M⁺, M+2, M+4, M+6) is indicative of the presence of chlorine atoms.\n2.  **Determine the Number of Chlorine Atoms:** The relative intensities of the isotope peaks for multiple chlorine atoms follow a predictable pattern based on the natural abundances of ³⁵Cl (~75.8%) and ³⁷Cl (~24.2%), which is roughly a 3:1 ratio.\n    *   For one Cl: M:(M+2) ratio is ~3:1.\n    *   For two Cl: M:(M+2):(M+4) ratio is ~9:6:1.\n    *   For three Cl: M:(M+2):(M+4):(M+6) ratio is ~(3)³ : 3*(3)²(1) : 3*(3)(1)² : (1)³ = 27:27:9:1. This is approximately a 1:1 ratio for M and M+2.\n    *   The observed intensities at m/z 260 and 262 are 34.8% and 29.0%, which is a ratio of approximately 1.2:1. This is a reasonably good match for the ~1:1 ratio expected for a compound with three chlorine atoms. Therefore, we can hypothesize that the molecular ion peak corresponding to the isotopologue with all ³⁵Cl atoms is at m/z 260, and the compound contains three chlorine atoms.\n3.  **Confirm the Molecular Weight:** The molecular weight of the compound (using the most common isotopes, ¹²C, ¹H, ³⁵Cl) is 260 amu.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula**\n1.  The molecule contains three chlorine atoms. The mass contribution of 3 x ³⁵Cl is 3 * 35 = 105 amu.\n2.  The mass of the rest of the molecule (the CₓHᵧ part) is 260 - 105 = 155 amu.\n3.  To find the formula of the CₓHᵧ fragment, we can divide its mass by the mass of carbon (12): 155 / 12 = 12 with a remainder of 11.\n4.  This suggests the fragment is C₁₂H₁₁.\n5.  Therefore, the molecular formula of the unknown compound is **C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃**.\n6.  The Nitrogen Rule: The molecular weight (260) is an even number, which is consistent with the molecule containing an even number of nitrogen atoms (including zero). Our proposed formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃ has zero nitrogen atoms, which agrees with the rule.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Major Fragmentation Peaks to Deduce the Structure**\n1.  **Base Peak (m/z 225):** The base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum (I=100%) and is located at m/z 225. The mass difference between the molecular ion and the base peak is 260 - 225 = 35 amu. This corresponds to the loss of a single chlorine atom ([M-Cl]⁺). The high intensity of this peak indicates that the resulting cation, [C₁₂H₁₁Cl₂]⁺, is particularly stable.\n2.  **Isotope Pattern of the Base Peak:** Let's verify the number of chlorines in the base peak fragment. There is a peak at m/z 227 with an intensity of 66.7%. The ratio of the M+2 peak to the M peak is I(227)/I(225) = 66.7/100 = 0.667. This is an excellent match for the theoretical ratio for a species with two chlorine atoms (~0.65). This confirms that the base peak results from the loss of one chlorine atom from the parent molecule.\n3.  **Sequential Loss of Chlorine (m/z 190 and m/z 155):**\n    *   There is a significant peak at m/z 190. The mass difference from the base peak is 225 - 190 = 35 amu. This indicates the loss of a second chlorine atom, forming the fragment [C₁₂H₁₁Cl]⁺.\n    *   There is another peak at m/z 155. The mass difference from the previous fragment is 190 - 155 = 35 amu. This suggests the loss of the third and final chlorine atom, leaving the hydrocarbon core [C₁₂H₁₁]⁺.\n4.  **Key Fragment at m/z 143:** There is a significant peak at m/z 143 (I=27.8%). This mass corresponds to the C₁₁H₁₁ fragment. This peak can be explained by the cleavage of a C-C bond in the original molecule, specifically the loss of a CCl₃ group from the molecular ion: M⁺ - CCl₃ = 260 - (12 + 3*35) = 260 - 117 = 143. This suggests the presence of a trichloromethyl (-CCl₃) group attached to a C₁₁H₁₁ moiety. However, the base peak being [M-Cl]⁺ and not [M-CCl₃]⁺ complicates this simple picture, but the presence of the m/z 143 peak is still a strong clue.\n\n**Step 4: Propose a Structure and IUPAC Name**\nBased on the evidence:\n*   Molecular Formula: C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃\n*   Fragmentation suggests a C₁₂H₁₁ core with three chlorine atoms attached in a way that allows sequential loss.\n*   The stability of the [M-Cl]⁺ fragment suggests the Cl is lost from a position that creates a stabilized carbocation (e.g., benzylic or allylic).\n*   The presence of m/z 143 suggests a possible -CCl₃ group.\n\nLet's try to construct a plausible structure. A C₁₂H₁₁ skeleton can be formed from a dihydronaphthalene ring (C₁₀H₁₀) and an ethyl side chain (C₂).\nConsider the structure **1-(2,2,2-trichloroethyl)-1,2-dihydronaphthalene**.\n*   **Formula Check:** The 1,2-dihydronaphthalene group is C₁₀H₁₀. Attaching a side chain at position 1 replaces one H, giving a C₁₀H₉ group. The side chain is 2,2,2-trichloroethyl, -CH₂-CCl₃. When we form the final molecule, we have C₁₀H₉-CH₂-CCl₃. Oh, this gives a C₁₁H₁₁Cl₃ formula. Let's re-evaluate.\n\nLet's reconsider the structure based on 1-(2,2,2-trichloroethyl)-1,2-dihydronaphthalene.\nThe 1,2-dihydronaphthalene part is C₁₀H₁₀. The trichloroethyl part is -C₂H₂Cl₃. Bonding them removes one H from each, forming C₁₀H₉-C₂H₁Cl₃... No, that's not right. The substituent is -CH₂CCl₃. Let's just assemble the atoms.\nA 1,2-dihydronaphthalene ring is C₁₀H₁₀. A 2,2,2-trichloroethyl substituent is -CH₂CCl₃. If we attach this to the ring, one H on the ring is substituted.\nThe formula for 1-(2,2,2-trichloroethyl)-1,2-dihydronaphthalene is indeed C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃. (C₁₀H₉)-(C₂H₂Cl₃).\nThis structure is consistent with the fragmentation:\n1.  **Loss of Cl:** The C-Cl bonds in the CCl₃ group are activated by the adjacent methylene and the aromatic/allylic system. Loss of one Cl atom would form a cation [C₁₂H₁₁Cl₂]⁺ which is stabilized by the adjacent dihydronaphthalene system, explaining the intense base peak at m/z 225.\n2.  **Loss of CCl₃:** Cleavage of the benzylic/allylic C-C bond could lead to the loss of the ·CCl₃ radical, leaving a stable [C₁₀H₉-CH₂]⁺ cation (a C₁₁H₁₁⁺ fragment). The mass of this ion is 143 amu, matching the observed peak.\n\nThis structure consistently explains all the major features of the mass spectrum.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe compound is an isomer of (2,2,2-trichloroethyl)dihydronaphthalene. A specific and plausible systematic IUPAC name is **1-(2,2,2-trichloroethyl)-1,2-dihydronaphthalene**.\n\n<<<1-(2,2,2-trichloroethyl)-1,2-dihydronaphthalene>>>"
