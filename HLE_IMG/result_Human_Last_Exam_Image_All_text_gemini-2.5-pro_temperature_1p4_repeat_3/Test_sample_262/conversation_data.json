    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the molecular structures of the four complexes.**\nAll four complexes are cationic iridium(III) complexes with a general structure of `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+`, where `C^N` represents a bidentate cyclometalating ligand (a substituted 2-phenylpyridine) and `N^N` represents a neutral bidentate ligand (a substituted 2,2'-bipyridine). The counter-anion is hexafluorophosphate (PF6-).\n\nThe key difference between the four complexes lies in the substitution pattern on the two `C^N` ligands. The `N^N` ligand is the same in all four complexes: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dtbbpy). Let's carefully examine the `C^N` ligands for each complex based on the provided image:\n\n*   **Complex 1:** This is a heteroleptic complex with respect to the `C^N` ligands. One ligand is an unsubstituted 2-phenylpyridine (ppy). The other ligand is a 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (F2ppy). The structure is `[Ir(ppy)(F2ppy)(dtbbpy)]+`.\n*   **Complex 2:** This is a homoleptic complex. Both `C^N` ligands are unsubstituted 2-phenylpyridine (ppy). The structure is `[Ir(ppy)2(dtbbpy)]+`.\n*   **Complex 3:** This is a homoleptic complex. Both `C^N` ligands are 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine (Fppy), with a fluorine atom at the ortho position of the phenyl ring relative to the Ir-C bond. The structure is `[Ir(Fppy)2(dtbbpy)]+`.\n*   **Complex 4:** This is a homoleptic complex. Both `C^N` ligands are 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (F2ppy). The structure is `[Ir(F2ppy)2(dtbbpy)]+`.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the factors affecting the lifetime of emitter complexes in LECs.**\nThe operational lifetime of a light-emitting device is critically dependent on the chemical and photochemical stability of the emitter molecule. For these iridium complexes, a primary degradation pathway involves the cleavage of the metal-ligand bonds, particularly the Ir-C bond of the cyclometalating ligand.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the effect of fluorine substitution on complex stability.**\nFluorine is a highly electronegative element. When substituted onto the phenyl ring of the `C^N` ligand, it has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect. This has two major consequences for stability:\n1.  **Strengthening of the Ir-C bond:** The electron withdrawal by fluorine atoms makes the carbon atom bonded to iridium more electron-deficient. This strengthens the covalent bond between the electron-rich Ir(III) center and the carbon atom. A stronger Ir-C bond makes the complex more resistant to thermal and chemical degradation, including bond cleavage.\n2.  **Increased robustness of the ligand:** The C-F bond is significantly stronger than the C-H bond it replaces. This makes the ligand itself less susceptible to chemical attack or abstraction reactions, which are potential degradation pathways.\n\nTherefore, increasing the degree of fluorination on the `C^N` ligands is a well-established strategy to improve the stability and operational lifetime of iridium-based emitters.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the four complexes and predict their relative lifetimes.**\nWe can rank the complexes based on the stability conferred by their `C^N` ligands. The presence of an unfluorinated `ppy` ligand acts as a \"weak link\" that limits the overall stability of the complex.\n\n*   **Complex 2 (`[Ir(ppy)2(dtbbpy)]+`):** This complex has two unfluorinated `ppy` ligands. It lacks any stabilization from fluorine substitution and is expected to have the lowest stability and the shortest lifetime.\n*   **Complex 1 (`[Ir(ppy)(F2ppy)(dtbbpy)]+`):** This complex has one unfluorinated `ppy` ligand and one di-fluorinated `F2ppy` ligand. While the `F2ppy` ligand is stable, the presence of the `ppy` \"weak link\" will make the complex susceptible to degradation. Its lifetime is expected to be longer than Complex 2 but significantly shorter than complexes that do not contain any `ppy` ligands.\n*   **Complex 3 (`[Ir(Fppy)2(dtbbpy)]+`):** This complex has two mono-fluorinated `Fppy` ligands. Both `C^N` ligands are stabilized by a fluorine atom, strengthening the Ir-C bonds. This complex is expected to be significantly more stable than Complexes 1 and 2.\n*   **Complex 4 (`[Ir(F2ppy)2(dtbbpy)]+`):** This complex has two di-fluorinated `F2ppy` ligands. The higher degree of fluorination provides even greater stabilization compared to Complex 3. This complex is expected to be the most stable and have the longest lifetime of the four.\n\nThe expected order of lifetimes is: Lifetime(2) < Lifetime(1) < Lifetime(3) < Lifetime(4).\n\n**Step 5: Final conclusion.**\nThe question asks which complexes are expected to show **shorter lifetimes**. Based on the analysis, Complexes 1 and 2, which both contain the less stable, unfluorinated `ppy` ligand, will be significantly less stable than Complexes 3 and 4. Therefore, Complexes 1 and 2 are the ones expected to have shorter lifetimes.\n\nThis corresponds to the answer choice that includes both [1] and [2].\n\n<<<E>>>"
