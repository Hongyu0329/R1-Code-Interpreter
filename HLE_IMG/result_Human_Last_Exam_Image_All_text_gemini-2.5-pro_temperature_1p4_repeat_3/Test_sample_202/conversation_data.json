    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the rock specimens:\n\n**Analysis of Specimen H**\n*   **Step 1: Observe the visual characteristics.** Specimen H is a reddish-brown rock with a rough surface. It is covered in small to medium-sized holes or cavities.\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the texture.** The presence of numerous holes, known as vesicles, indicates that the rock formed from lava that was full of trapped gas bubbles. This is called a vesicular texture. The rock matrix itself is fine-grained (aphanitic), as individual mineral crystals are not visible to the naked eye.\n*   **Step 3: Determine the rock type.** The vesicular and aphanitic texture points to an extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock. The reddish color suggests a mafic composition with iron oxidation. This type of vesicular, mafic volcanic rock is called **scoria**.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen J**\n*   **Step 1: Observe the visual characteristics.** Specimen J is a light-colored (white/light grey) rock that is extremely porous and appears very lightweight. It has a frothy, sponge-like texture with a high density of small vesicles.\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the texture.** This is another example of a vesicular, extrusive igneous rock. Its extremely high porosity and light color are key identifiers. The light color suggests a felsic (silica-rich) composition.\n*   **Step 3: Determine the rock type.** A felsic, highly vesicular volcanic rock that is very low in density (often able to float on water) is identified as **pumice**.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen I**\n*   **Step 1: Observe the visual characteristics.** This specimen is composed of various rock fragments (clasts) that are angular in shape. These fragments are of different colors and sizes and are cemented together in a fine-grained, light-colored matrix.\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the texture.** The rock is clearly clastic, meaning it's made of pieces of other rocks. The angular nature of the clasts and the ash-like consistency of the matrix point towards a pyroclastic origin, meaning it was formed from material ejected during an explosive volcanic eruption.\n*   **Step 3: Determine the rock type.** A rock formed from consolidated volcanic ash, which may or may not contain larger angular rock fragments (lapilli), is known as **tuff**. If the larger fragments dominate, it might be called a volcanic breccia, but tuff is a suitable identification for this specimen.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen K**\n*   **Step 1: Observe the visual characteristics.** This rock is composed of large, interlocking mineral crystals that are easily visible. There is a mixture of light-colored minerals (white, pink, and translucent grey) and darker minerals (black/dark green).\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the texture.** The coarse-grained texture, where individual crystals are clearly visible, is called phaneritic. This texture indicates that the magma cooled very slowly, deep beneath the Earth's surface.\n*   **Step 3: Determine the rock type.** A coarse-grained (phaneritic), intrusive igneous rock with a mix of light-colored minerals like quartz (grey) and feldspar (pink and white), and dark minerals like biotite or hornblende, is identified as **granite**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Tuff (or Volcanic Breccia)\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Granite\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Tuff\nJ: Pumice\nK: Granite>>>"
