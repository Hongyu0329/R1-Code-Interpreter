The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to the formation of a conformationally rigid, bicyclic Münchnone intermediate from N-acetyl-proline. In this intermediate, the two termini of the 1,3-dipole (C2, substituted with a methyl group, and C5, a bridgehead carbon) are sterically and electronically non-equivalent. This fixed asymmetry enforces a single, preferred orientation for the cycloaddition with methyl propiolate, resulting in one major product.

Reactions 1 and 2 demonstrate that while the cycloaddition step is intrinsically regioselective (Reaction 1), this selectivity is obscured if the dipole's termini are structurally similar enough to undergo rapid equilibration. The labeling study in Reaction 2 shows that when both substituents are methyl groups, a scrambling mechanism makes them equivalent before the cycloaddition occurs. The rigid structure of the proline-derived Münchnone in Reaction 3 prevents this scrambling, thus allowing the intrinsic regioselectivity of the reaction to be fully expressed.
