    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   The mass spectrum shows the molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 135.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** A molecular weight that is an odd number (135) indicates the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule. We can assume one nitrogen atom (N, atomic weight ≈ 14).\n*   **Molecular Formula Determination:**\n    *   Subtracting the mass of one nitrogen atom: 135 - 14 = 121. This remaining mass is due to carbon and hydrogen.\n    *   Dividing the remaining mass by 12 (mass of carbon): 121 / 12 = 10 remainder 1. This suggests 10 carbons and 1 hydrogen (C₁₀H₁N), which is not possible.\n    *   Let's try 9 carbons: 9 × 12 = 108. The remaining mass for hydrogen is 121 - 108 = 13.\n    *   This gives a plausible molecular formula of **C₉H₁₃N**.\n    *   Let's check the mass: (9 × 12.01) + (13 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) ≈ 108 + 13 + 14 = 135. This matches the molecular ion peak.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\n*   The formula for the degree of unsaturation is DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1.\n*   For C₉H₁₃N: DoU = 9 - (13/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 6.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 4.\n*   A DoU of 4 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring (which accounts for 3 double bonds and 1 ring).\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** There are two sharp peaks in this region. This is a characteristic feature of a primary amine (-NH₂), corresponding to the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretches. A secondary amine (-NH-) would show one peak, and a tertiary amine would show none.\n*   **>3000 cm⁻¹:** Peaks slightly above 3000 cm⁻¹ are for aromatic C(sp²)-H stretching.\n*   **<3000 cm⁻¹:** Peaks slightly below 3000 cm⁻¹ are for aliphatic C(sp³)-H stretching.\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹ and ~1450-1500 cm⁻¹:** These sharp peaks are characteristic of C=C bond stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂), an aromatic ring, and aliphatic groups.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra**\n*   **¹³C NMR signals (7 total):** δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n*   **DEPT-135 information:** 1 negative signal and 5 positive signals.\n    *   DEPT-135 shows CH and CH₃ as positive signals, CH₂ as negative signals, and does not show quaternary carbons (C).\n    *   This means there is **1 CH₂ group** (one negative signal) and **5 CH/CH₃ groups** (five positive signals).\n*   **Signal assignments:**\n    *   **Aromatic region (δ 100-160 ppm):** Four signals at 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm. Since a benzene ring has 6 carbons, 4 signals imply a monosubstituted ring where ortho (C2/C6) and meta (C3/C5) positions are equivalent.\n    *   The downfield signal at δ 145.1 ppm does not appear in the DEPT spectrum (since there are 6 carbons with H and 7 total signals, one must be quaternary). This is the ipso-carbon, the one attached to the substituent. The other 3 signals (128.5, 127.3, 126.3) are the CH carbons of the phenyl group.\n    *   **Aliphatic region (< 100 ppm):** Three signals at 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm. From DEPT-135, we know one is a CH₂, and the other two are CH or CH₃.\n\n**Step 5: Analysis of ¹H NMR and HSQC Spectra**\n*   **¹H NMR signals:**\n    *   **δ ~7.3 ppm:** A multiplet with an integration of 5H. This confirms the presence of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n    *   **δ ~1.2 ppm:** A doublet with an integration of ~3H. A 3H doublet indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (-CH-). This points to a -CH(X)-CH₃ fragment.\n    *   **δ ~2.85 ppm:** A multiplet with an integration of ~2H. This corresponds to a CH₂ group.\n    *   **δ ~2.7 ppm:** A multiplet with an integration of ~1H. This corresponds to a CH group.\n    *   The two protons of the -NH₂ group are likely a broad signal, possibly overlapping with other signals or the solvent residual peak.\n\n*   **Constructing the Side Chain:** The formula is C₉H₁₃N. The phenyl group is C₆H₅. The side chain is C₃H₈N. We know it contains a -NH₂ group, one CH, one CH₂, and one CH₃. The only two possibilities for arranging these fragments attached to a phenyl ring are:\n    1.  **C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃** (1-phenylpropan-2-amine)\n    2.  **C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂** (2-phenylpropan-1-amine)\n\n*   **HSQC Analysis (to distinguish isomers):** The HSQC spectrum correlates ¹H signals with the ¹³C signals of the carbons they are attached to.\n    *   The 3H doublet at **δ(¹H) ~1.2 ppm** correlates with the carbon signal at **δ(¹³C) ~19.2 ppm**. This assigns the **CH₃** group.\n    *   The 2H multiplet at **δ(¹H) ~2.85 ppm** correlates with the carbon signal at **δ(¹³C) ~43.5 ppm**. This assigns the **CH₂** group.\n    *   The 1H multiplet at **δ(¹H) ~2.7 ppm** correlates with the carbon signal at **δ(¹³C) ~49.6 ppm**. This assigns the **CH** group.\n\n*   **Final Structure Determination:** The key is to compare the chemical shifts of the CH₂ (43.5 ppm) and CH (49.6 ppm) carbons. The carbon atom directly attached to the electronegative nitrogen atom (-NH₂) will be the most deshielded (highest chemical shift) among the aliphatic carbons.\n    *   Since the CH carbon has a higher shift (49.6 ppm) than the CH₂ carbon (43.5 ppm), the CH group must be the one bonded to the nitrogen atom.\n    *   This corresponds to the structure **C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃**.\n\n**Step 6: IUPAC Naming**\n*   **Principal Functional Group:** Amine (-NH₂). The suffix is \"-amine\".\n*   **Parent Chain:** The longest carbon chain containing the amine group is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n*   **Numbering:** Number the propane chain to give the amine group the lowest possible number. The amine is on carbon 2. Thus, the parent name is **propan-2-amine**.\n*   **Substituent:** There is a phenyl group (C₆H₅-) attached to carbon 1 of the propane chain.\n*   **Final Name:** Putting it all together gives **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
