    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral centers and number the main carbon chain according to IUPAC rules.**\n\nFirst, we need to determine the principal functional group to name the parent chain correctly. According to IUPAC priority rules, the alcohol group (-OH) has higher priority than the amine group (-NH2). Therefore, the molecule is named as an alcohol.\n\nNext, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the carbon atom bonded to the -OH group.\nThe structure is: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH(Et)-CH(CH3)-CH2NH2`\nThe longest chain containing the `C-OH` carbon has 5 carbons. We number the chain to give the -OH group the lowest possible number. Numbering from the right end of the horizontal chain shown does not work well. Let's number from the `CH3` group on the left.\n\nThe main chain is `CH3-C(2)-C(3)-C(4)-C(5)`.\nLet's trace the full chain: `CH3(C1)-CH(OH)(C2)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH(CH3)(C4)-CH2NH2`. The longest chain here is 5 carbons.\nThe IUPAC name is **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**.\nThe chiral centers are C2, C3, and C4. We will determine the configuration (R or S) for each of these centers.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the configuration of the first chiral center (C2).**\n\nC2 is the carbon atom bonded to the -OH group.\n1.  **Identify the four groups attached to C2:**\n    *   -OH (hydroxyl group)\n    *   -CH3 (methyl group, C1)\n    *   -H (hydrogen, implied)\n    *   The rest of the chain starting with C3: -CH(Et)CH(Me)CH2NH2\n\n2.  **Assign priorities (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules):**\n    *   Priority 1: -OH (highest atomic number of the first atom, O=8)\n    *   Priority 2: -CH(Et)CH(Me)CH2NH2 (the C3 group, bonded to C,C,H)\n    *   Priority 3: -CH3 (the C1 group, bonded to H,H,H)\n    *   Priority 4: -H (lowest atomic number)\n\n3.  **Determine the configuration:**\n    *   In the drawing, the C1-C2-C3 backbone is in the plane. The -OH group is on a dash (pointing away from the viewer). Therefore, the implied -H atom must be on a wedge (pointing towards the viewer).\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (-H, #4) points towards the viewer, we determine the direction of the sequence 1 -> 2 -> 3 and then reverse the result.\n    *   The sequence 1(-OH, back) -> 2(C3, right) -> 3(C1, left) traces a counter-clockwise path.\n    *   Counter-clockwise normally means S. But since H is on a wedge, we reverse it to R.\n    *   **Alternative Method (Swapping):** Swap the H (wedge, #4) and OH (dash, #1). Now H is on a dash (away). The new arrangement is OH(wedge), C3(right), C1(left). The sequence 1(OH, front) -> 2(C3, right) -> 3(C1, left) is clockwise (R). Since we did one swap, the original configuration is the opposite, which is S.\n    *   Let's re-verify. Method 1 (view from front): H is wedge. 1(OH, back) -> 2(C3, right) -> 3(C1, left) is a counter-clockwise circle. Apparent S. Reverse for H wedge -> R. My first conclusion. Method 2 (swapping) gives S. There's a conflict. Let's trust the swap method which is less prone to visualization errors. Let's re-examine Method 1's conclusion. Back->Right->Left. This is counter-clockwise (S). H-wedge reverses it to R.\n    *   Let's try a third method: View along the C-H bond from behind the molecule. From this perspective, H is away. The original OH(dash) becomes a wedge (towards us). The original C3(right) becomes left. The original C1(left) becomes right. The sequence 1(OH, front) -> 2(C3, left) -> 3(C1, right) is counter-clockwise. So, the configuration is S.\n    *   Since two methods (swap and rear-view) confirm S, we conclude **C2 is (S)**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the configuration of the second chiral center (C3).**\n\nC3 is the carbon atom bonded to the ethyl group.\n1.  **Identify the four groups attached to C3:**\n    *   -CH(OH)CH3 (C2 group)\n    *   -CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (C4 group)\n    *   -CH2CH3 (ethyl group)\n    *   -H (hydrogen, implied)\n\n2.  **Assign priorities:**\n    *   Priority 1: -CH(OH)CH3 (C2 is bonded to O, C, H)\n    *   Priority 2: -CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (C4 is bonded to C, C, H)\n    *   Priority 3: -CH2CH3 (Ethyl's first C is bonded to C, H, H)\n    *   Priority 4: -H\n\n3.  **Determine the configuration:**\n    *   In the drawing, the C2-C3-C4 backbone is in the plane. The ethyl group is on a wedge (towards the viewer). Therefore, the implied -H atom must be on a dash (away from the viewer).\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (-H, #4) points away, we can directly determine the configuration from the sequence 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   The sequence 1(C2, left) -> 2(C4, right) -> 3(Ethyl, front/up) traces a counter-clockwise path.\n    *   Therefore, **C3 is (S)**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the configuration of the third chiral center (C4).**\n\nC4 is the carbon atom bonded to a methyl group and an aminomethyl group.\n1.  **Identify the four groups attached to C4:**\n    *   -CH2NH2 (aminomethyl group)\n    *   -CH(Et)CH(OH)CH3 (the rest of the chain, C3 group)\n    *   -CH3 (methyl group)\n    *   -H (hydrogen, implied)\n\n2.  **Assign priorities:**\n    *   Priority 1: -CH2NH2 (its C is bonded to N, H, H; N has higher atomic number than C)\n    *   Priority 2: -CH(Et)CH(OH)CH3 (its C, C3, is bonded to C, C, H)\n    *   Priority 3: -CH3 (its C is bonded to H, H, H)\n    *   Priority 4: -H\n\n3.  **Determine the configuration:**\n    *   In the drawing, the C3-C4 bond is in the plane. The -CH2NH2 group is on a wedge (front), and the -CH3 group is on a dash (back). This implies the implied -H atom is in the plane.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (-H, #4) is in the plane, it is best to use the swap method. Let's swap the positions of -H (#4) and -CH3 (#3, which is on a dash).\n    *   The new (swapped) molecule has -H on a dash (away). The -CH3 group is now in the plane.\n    *   Now, we determine the configuration for this swapped molecule. -H is away.\n    *   The sequence 1(-CH2NH2, front/wedge) -> 2(C3 group, left) -> 3(-CH3, in the plane) traces a counter-clockwise path.\n    *   The swapped molecule has an S configuration.\n    *   Since we performed one swap, the original molecule has the opposite configuration.\n    *   Therefore, **C4 is (R)**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the results.**\n\nThe absolute configurations of the chiral centers are:\n*   C2 is (S)\n*   C3 is (S)\n*   C4 is (R)\n\nThe full stereochemical name is (2S, 3S, 4R)-5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol. The question asks for the absolute configuration, which is this set of descriptors.\n\n<<<2S, 3S, 4R>>>"
