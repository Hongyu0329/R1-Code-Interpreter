    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the title and composer of the provided jazz standard.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Key and Time Signature:**\n    *   The key signature has one flat (Bb). This suggests the key of F Major or its relative minor, D minor.\n    *   However, the piece starts and ends on an F minor chord (F-), establishing F minor as the tonal center.\n    *   The time signature is 4/4, or common time, which is standard for many jazz tunes.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chord Progression:**\n    *   The most distinctive feature of this piece is the chord progression in the first four measures.\n    *   Measure 1: F- (F minor)\n    *   Measure 2: E-7b5 (E half-diminished 7)\n    *   Measure 3: Eb-6 (Eb minor 6)\n    *   Measure 4: Dbmaj7 (Db major 7)\n    *   This progression features a chromatically descending bass line: F -> E -> Eb -> Db. This type of progression, often called a \"line clich√©,\" is highly characteristic and a major clue for identification.\n    *   The B section (starting at measure 9) begins with a D-7b5, moving to G7, which is a ii-V progression leading to C. This sequence of ii-V's continues, which is also typical of many jazz standards.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Melody:**\n    *   The melody in the first four bars directly outlines the chords.\n    *   Over the F- chord, the melody plays C and F (the 5th and root).\n    *   Over the E-7b5 chord, the melody plays B and E (the 5th and root). Note that the B is natural, fitting the E-7b5 chord, not the key signature's Bb.\n    *   Over the Eb-6 chord, the melody plays Bb and Eb (the 5th and root).\n    *   Over the Dbmaj7 chord, the melody plays Ab and Db (the 5th and root).\n    *   This melodic pattern, following the chromatically descending harmony, is very recognizable.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Piece:**\n    *   The combination of the F minor tonality, the chromatically descending chord progression (F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7), and the corresponding melody are the definitive characteristics of the jazz standard **\"Nica's Dream\"**.\n    *   The composer of this influential hard bop classic is the pianist and bandleader **Horace Silver**. It was first recorded in 1956 by Art Blakey & The Jazz Messengers, a group co-led by Silver at the time.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Don't be misled by the key signature alone; the tonic chord is the most important indicator of the key.\n*   Recognize that written-out notes (like the B natural in measure 2) override the key signature.\n*   The unique chord progression in the first section (the \"A\" section) is the single biggest clue to identifying this particular tune.\n\nBased on this analysis, the title and composer can be confidently identified.\n\n<<<Title: Nica's Dream, Composer: Horace Silver>>>"
