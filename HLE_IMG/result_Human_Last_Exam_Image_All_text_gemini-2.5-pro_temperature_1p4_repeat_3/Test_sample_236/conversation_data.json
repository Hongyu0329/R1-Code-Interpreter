    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the subject and its environment.**\nThe image displays an insect perched on a cluster of small, bright yellow flowers. The insect is the central focus. The flowers have a distinct structure characteristic of goldenrod (genus *Solidago*). The presence of the insect on this specific plant can be a clue to its identity.\n\n**Step 2: Observe the insect's physical characteristics.**\nBy examining the original image and the provided crops, we can list the key features of the insect:\n*   **Coloration:** It has a striking color pattern of orange and black.\n*   **Head:** The head is black, with prominent compound eyes and a pair of long, black antennae.\n*   **Thorax:** The segment directly behind the head (the pronotum) is a bright orange-red color.\n*   **Wings:** The visible part of the wings (elytra, or wing covers) is also orange. The angle doesn't show the full wing pattern, but this coloration is a significant feature.\n*   **Legs:** The legs are long and black.\n*   **Body Shape:** The body is elongated, which is typical of certain beetle families. It doesn't have the characteristic triangular scutellum or crossed wing tips of many \"true bugs\" (Hemiptera). This suggests it is a beetle (Order Coleoptera).\n\n**Step 3: Formulate a hypothesis based on the observations.**\nThe combination of features—an orange and black, elongated beetle found on goldenrod flowers—strongly suggests it is a soldier beetle from the family Cantharidae. Specifically, it matches the description of the **Goldenrod Soldier Beetle**, also known as the Pennsylvania Leatherwing.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the identification and find the scientific name.**\nLet's compare our observations to the known characteristics of the Goldenrod Soldier Beetle:\n*   **Common Name:** Goldenrod Soldier Beetle. Its name directly links it to its common habitat, the goldenrod plant, which matches the image.\n*   **Scientific Name:** *Chauliognathus pensylvanicus*.\n*   **Appearance:** This beetle has a black head, an orange/yellow pronotum (sometimes with a black spot), and long, leathery orange/yellow elytra that have a black patch at the posterior end (not visible from this angle). Its legs and antennae are black. This description is a perfect match for the insect in the photograph.\n*   **Behavior:** They are commonly seen on goldenrod and other late-summer flowers, where they feed on pollen and nectar, and also prey on smaller insects like aphids.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the analysis.**\nBased on the distinctive coloration, body shape, and its presence on a goldenrod flower, the insect depicted in the center of the image is unequivocally the Goldenrod Soldier Beetle. Its scientific name is *Chauliognathus pensylvanicus*.\n\n<<<Chauliognathus pensylvanicus>>>"
