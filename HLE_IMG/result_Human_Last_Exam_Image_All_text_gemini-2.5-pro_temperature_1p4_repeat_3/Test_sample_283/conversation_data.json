    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph Structure:**\n    *   The graph is a Google Trends chart, showing relative search interest over time.\n    *   The **x-axis** represents time, spanning from December 1, 2019, to sometime after May 28, 2023.\n    *   The **y-axis** represents search interest, scaled from 0 to 100, where 100 is the point of maximum interest for any of the terms during the specified period.\n    *   There are **three lines** (red, blue, and yellow), each representing a different search term related to a historic event. The prompt states all three events occurred in the same country.\n\n2.  **Identify Patterns for Each Line:**\n    *   The most crucial feature of the graph is the presence of recurring, sharp peaks for all three lines. This cyclical pattern strongly suggests that the search terms are related to annual events, such as anniversaries or holidays.\n    *   **Red Line:** This line shows a significant peak every year around January. We can observe a peak shortly after December 2019 (i.e., January 2020), and this pattern repeats in early 2021, 2022, and 2023.\n    *   **Blue Line:** This line displays smaller but consistent peaks every year around May. We can see a peak just before the May 28, 2023 marker, and tracing backward, we see similar peaks in May 2022, 2021, and 2020.\n    *   **Yellow Line:** This line exhibits very sharp, high-intensity peaks every year around September. There is a peak after the August 29, 2021 marker (i.e., September 2021), and another major peak (the highest on the chart, reaching 100) occurs around September 2022.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Hypothesis based on the Annual Peaks:**\n    *   The task is to find a single country that has three significant historical events commemorated annually in January, May, and September.\n    *   Let's test the hypothesis that the country is **Russia**. A historian would be familiar with its major national commemorations.\n        *   **May (Blue Line):** This aligns perfectly with Russia's **Victory Day** on **May 9th**. It is one of the nation's most important holidays, celebrating the surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945 (known as the Great Patriotic War in Russia). This would cause a definite annual spike in search interest.\n        *   **September (Yellow Line):** This corresponds with the anniversary of the **Beslan school siege**, a tragic terror attack that took place from **September 1-3, 2004**. This event is a source of national trauma and is solemnly remembered every year, which would explain the sharp, high-interest peaks. The peak reaching 100 in September 2022 might be due to heightened media coverage on the 18th anniversary, especially within the context of other national events occurring that year.\n        *   **January (Red Line):** This aligns with the anniversary of the **death of Vladimir Lenin** on **January 21, 1924**. As the founder of the Soviet state, his death is a key date in Russian and Soviet history, and its anniversary is still noted and discussed, leading to annual search interest.\n\n4.  **Evaluate and Conclude:**\n    *   The three proposed Russian events—Lenin's Death (January), Victory Day (May), and the Beslan siege anniversary (September)—fit the timeline of the peaks shown in the graph perfectly.\n    *   These are all significant historical events tied to Russia and its predecessor state, the Soviet Union.\n    *   Testing other countries reveals a poorer fit. For example, major US anniversaries like Independence Day (July), Pearl Harbor Day (December), and 9/11 (September) do not match the January and May peaks.\n    *   Therefore, the combination of these three specific annual commemoration patterns makes it evident to a historian that the country in question is Russia.\n\n<<<Russia>>>"
