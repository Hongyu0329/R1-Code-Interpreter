    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the painting:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image Content and Style:** The image fragment displays a prominent windmill under a dramatic, stormy sky. There's a strong contrast between dark, turbulent clouds and a patch of clear blue sky. In the background to the right, a building is engulfed in flames. The overall mood is intense and chaotic. The brushwork and dramatic subject matter are characteristic of the Romanticism art movement, which flourished in the 19th century. The central subject is a windmill, likely of a Dutch or Northern European design.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Search Strategy:** The most effective method is to use a reverse image search on the provided fragment. Alternatively, one could search using descriptive keywords like \"19th-century Romantic painting windmill storm fire\".\n\n3.  **Identify the Artist and Artwork:** A reverse image search or a targeted keyword search points to the Russian Romantic painter Maxim Vorobiev (1787-1855). The specific artwork is a well-known piece from 1842.\n\n4.  **Verify the Details and Title:** The painting is indeed from the 19th century (1842). The fragment is a crop of the central and right portions of the full painting. The full composition reveals a large oak tree on the left, which has been struck and shattered by lightning. This key detail gives the painting its primary title. While it is sometimes known by other names like \"The Windmill\" or \"The Windmill in a Storm\" due to its prominent features, its most formal and recognized title is related to the damaged oak tree.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** The painting is by Maxim Vorobiev. The most accurate title, reflecting the entire composition, is \"Oak, Fractured by a Lightning Stroke\". It is also known as \"Oak Split by Lightning\".\n\n<<<Oak, Fractured by a Lightning Stroke>>>"
