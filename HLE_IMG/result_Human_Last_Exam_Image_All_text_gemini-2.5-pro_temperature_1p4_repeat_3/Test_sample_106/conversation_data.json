    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the substituents at the indicated positions.\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction Type**\nThe reaction starts with a tertiary alcohol and is treated with a strong acid (HCl) and heat. This is a classic E1 elimination reaction that proceeds through a carbocation intermediate. The complexity of the starting material, a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol, suggests that the intermediate carbocation will undergo a series of rearrangements to form a more stable carbocation before the final elimination step. These rearrangements are known as Wagner-Meerwein shifts, which are sequential [1,2] shifts of hydride (H⁻) or methyl (CH₃⁻) groups.\n\n**2. Propose the Reaction Mechanism**\n\n*   **Step A: Formation of the Initial Carbocation**\n    The hydroxyl (-OH) group is protonated by HCl to form a good leaving group, water (-OH₂⁺). The water molecule departs, generating a secondary carbocation at carbon C3.\n\n*   **Step B: Carbocation Rearrangement Cascade**\n    The initial secondary carbocation is unstable and will rearrange through a series of [1,2] shifts to form more stable carbocations (preferably tertiary). This process, often called a \"backbone rearrangement\" in steroid/terpenoid chemistry, continues until the positive charge reaches a position from which a stable alkene can be formed. Let's trace the movement of the positive charge and the migrating groups. We'll track the key carbons that correspond to positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the product.\n\n    Let's identify the carbons in the starting material that will become the locations of the numbered substituents in the product.\n    *   Position 1 is at carbon C4 (bearing two methyl groups).\n    *   Position 2 is at carbon C10 (bearing one methyl group).\n    *   Position 3 is at carbon C5 (bearing a hydrogen atom).\n    *   Position 4 is at carbon C8 (bearing a hydrogen atom).\n    *   Position 5 is at carbon C9 (bearing a hydrogen atom).\n\n    **The cascade of [1,2] shifts proceeds as follows:**\n\n    1.  **C3⁺ → C4⁺:** A methyl group (CH₃) shifts from C4 to C3. This forms a more stable tertiary carbocation at C4.\n        *   *Result for C4 (Pos 1):* Now has one CH₃ group and a positive charge.\n\n    2.  **C4⁺ → C5⁺:** A hydride (H⁻) shifts from C5 to C4. This forms another tertiary carbocation at C5.\n        *   *Result for C4 (Pos 1):* Has its remaining CH₃ group and the new H.\n        *   *Result for C5 (Pos 3):* Has lost its H and now has a positive charge.\n\n    3.  **C5⁺ → C10⁺:** A methyl group (CH₃) shifts from C10 to C5. This forms a tertiary carbocation at C10.\n        *   *Result for C5 (Pos 3):* Now has a CH₃ group (from C10).\n        *   *Result for C10 (Pos 2):* Has lost its CH₃ group and now has a positive charge.\n\n    4.  **C10⁺ → C9⁺:** A hydride (H⁻) shifts from C9 to C10. This forms a less stable secondary carbocation at C9, a necessary step in the cascade.\n        *   *Result for C10 (Pos 2):* Now has an H atom (from C9).\n        *   *Result for C9 (Pos 5):* Has lost its H and now has a positive charge.\n\n    5.  **C9⁺ → C8⁺:** A hydride (H⁻) shifts from C8 to C9. This forms a more stable tertiary carbocation at C8.\n        *   *Result for C9 (Pos 5):* Now has an H atom (from C8).\n        *   *Result for C8 (Pos 4):* Has lost its H and now has a positive charge.\n\n    6.  **C8⁺ → C14⁺:** A methyl group (CH₃) shifts from C14 to C8. This forms a tertiary carbocation at C14.\n        *   *Result for C8 (Pos 4):* Now has a CH₃ group (from C14).\n\n    7.  **C14⁺ → C13⁺:** A hydride (H⁻) shifts from C13 to C14. This forms a secondary carbocation at C13. This is the final carbocation before elimination.\n\n*   **Step C: Elimination**\n    The carbocation at C13 undergoes elimination. A proton is removed from the adjacent carbon C18. This results in the formation of a stable, tetrasubstituted double bond between C13 and C18, yielding the final product shown.\n\n**3. Determine the Substituents at Positions 1-5**\nBased on the tracking of the migrating groups during the rearrangement:\n\n*   **Position 1 (on C4):** This carbon started with two CH₃ groups. One CH₃ group migrated to C3. An H migrated from C5 to C4. The carbon is left with one of its original **CH₃** groups.\n*   **Position 2 (on C10):** This carbon started with a CH₃ group, which migrated to C5. Later, an H migrated from C9 to C10. The final substituent at this position is **H**.\n*   **Position 3 (on C5):** This carbon started with an H, which migrated to C4. Later, a CH₃ group migrated from C10 to C5. The final substituent at this position is **CH₃**.\n*   **Position 4 (on C8):** This carbon started with an H, which migrated to C9. Later, a CH₃ group migrated from C14 to C8. The final substituent at this position is **CH₃**.\n*   **Position 5 (on C9):** This carbon started with an H, which migrated to C10. Later, an H migrated from C8 to C9. The original H left and a new H arrived. The final substituent at this position is **H**.\n\n**Final Answer Construction**\nCombining the results for each position:\n1 = CH3\n2 = H\n3 = CH3\n4 = CH3\n5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
