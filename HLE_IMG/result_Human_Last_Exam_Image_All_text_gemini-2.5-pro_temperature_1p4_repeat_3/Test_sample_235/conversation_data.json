    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the erasure poem's metric pattern:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the text of the poem.**\nFirst, we must read the words that constitute the poem. The image is a collage, and the words are presented as separate cutouts placed on a larger illustration of a hand. The words are:\n- \"rules\"\n- \"and\"\n- \"lines,\"\n- \"an intricate spider's web\"\n- \"work\"\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the poem and count the syllables.**\nTo analyze the meter, we need to arrange these words into a readable form. A plausible reading, following a top-to-bottom flow while trying to form a coherent phrase, would be: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web, work.\"\nLet's count the syllables in this complete phrase:\n- rules (1)\n- and (1)\n- lines (1)\n- an (1)\n- in-tri-cate (3)\n- spi-der's (2)\n- web (1)\n- work (1)\nThe total syllable count for the entire poem is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11 syllables.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the provided answer choices based on the syllable count.**\nNow we can evaluate the given options against our findings:\n*   **A. free verse:** This form has no regular meter or rhyme scheme. This is a possibility if no other pattern fits.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter:** This form consists of a line with 10 syllables (five pairs of unstressed followed by stressed syllables). Our poem has 11 syllables. While an 11-syllable line can sometimes be iambic pentameter with a \"feminine ending\" (an extra unstressed syllable), we still need to check the stress pattern.\n*   **C. alexandrine:** This is a line of 12 syllables. Our poem has 11, so this is incorrect.\n*   **D. sapphic:** This refers to a specific four-line stanza form where the first three lines have 11 syllables and the last has 5. Our poem is a single phrase of 11 syllables, not a full Sapphic stanza.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** This form has lines of about 6 syllables (three iambic feet). The entire poem is only 11 syllables, and breaking it into lines (e.g., \"rules and lines,\" (3 syllables) / \"an intricate spider's web work\" (8 syllables)) does not produce lines of iambic trimeter.\n*   **F. american sentence:** This is a specific form created by Allen Ginsberg which is a single sentence of 17 syllables. Our poem has 11 syllables, so this is incorrect.\n\nBased on syllable count alone, we can eliminate C, E, and F. D is highly unlikely as it describes a stanza form. We are left with B (iambic pentameter) and A (free verse).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the stress pattern (scansion).**\nTo distinguish between iambic pentameter and free verse, we must analyze the pattern of stressed (S) and unstressed (U) syllables.\nIambic pentameter has a regular pattern of `U S | U S | U S | U S | U S`.\nLet's try to scan our line: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web, work.\"\nA natural reading would likely produce a stress pattern like this:\n`RULES and LINES, an IN-tri-cate SPI-der's WEB, WORK`\n`S U S U S U U S U S S`\nThis pattern is not regular and does not conform to the `U S` repetition of iambic meter. The group \"in-tri-cate\" (S U U) is a dactyl, which breaks the iambic flow. Forcing the line into an iambic pattern would result in unnatural pronunciations.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the analysis.**\nSince the poem does not have a consistent syllable count per line (it's best read as one phrase) and lacks a regular pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables, it does not fit any of the formal metric structures listed (B, C, D, E, F). The lack of a governing metrical rule is the defining characteristic of free verse. The visual arrangement of the words scattered across the page further reinforces this idea of freedom from traditional poetic constraints.\n\nTherefore, the metric pattern the words follow is free verse.\n\n<<<A>>>"
