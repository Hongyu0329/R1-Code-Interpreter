    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observations (Instrumentation, Key, Time, Tempo):**\n    *   **Instrumentation:** The music is written on a grand staff (treble and bass clefs), which is standard for solo piano music.\n    *   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4, also known as common time.\n    *   **Key Signature:** There are two sharps (F# and C#) in the key signature, which typically indicates either D major or B minor. However, the piece starts with a G major chord in the left hand and a melody based on the G Lydian mode (G-A-B-C#-D-E-F#). This suggests the key is more complex or modal.\n    *   **Tempo:** The tempo marking is quarter note = 80, a moderately slow and deliberate pace.\n\n2.  **Musical Characteristics and Structure:**\n    *   **Measures 1-2 (Introduction):** The piece begins softly (*p* - piano). The right hand plays a simple, ascending melodic line (G-A-B-C#...), while the left hand holds a sustained G major chord. This creates a calm, almost ethereal opening.\n    *   **Measure 3 (Sudden Shift):** There is an abrupt and dramatic change. The dynamic marking shifts to *f* (forte). The texture becomes much thicker and more aggressive. The right hand plays rapid sixteenth-note arpeggios based on an E minor chord, while the left hand plays powerful, low E octaves. This stark contrast is a major identifying feature of the piece.\n    *   **Measures 4-6 (Development of the Fast Section):** The pattern of fast arpeggios in the right hand over octaves in the left hand continues, moving through a distinct chord progression. The dynamic level drops to *mp* (mezzo-piano) but the intensity remains. The harmony is chromatic and complex, featuring chords like C# diminished and introducing more accidentals (A#, D#, G#).\n    *   **Measures 7-10:** The intensity builds again to *mf* (mezzo-forte) in measure 8. The texture becomes denser, with both hands playing thick, driving chords and sixteenth-note rhythms. This section feels powerful and rhythmically insistent.\n    *   **Measure 11 (Climax/Transition):** This measure features a very fast, virtuosic upward arpeggio (indicated by the small notes and the wavy line), likely a glissando, leading into more heavy chords. This reinforces the dramatic and technically demanding nature of the music.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Piece:**\n    *   The combination of a quiet, mysterious opening followed by a sudden, violent burst of fast, percussive piano writing is highly characteristic of modern dramatic music, often found in video games or film scores.\n    *   The specific arpeggio figure starting in measure 3 (an E minor chord) is a very famous motif.\n    *   This style is strongly associated with the composer Nobuo Uematsu and his work on the *Final Fantasy* series.\n    *   The musical passage is instantly recognizable as the piano arrangement of \"One-Winged Angel,\" the iconic final boss theme for Sephiroth from the video game *Final Fantasy VII*. This specific arrangement comes from the *Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII* album.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the dramatic dynamic shifts, the specific melodic and rhythmic motifs (especially the E minor arpeggios in measure 3), the virtuosic piano writing, and the overall epic feel, the piece is \"One-Winged Angel\" from *Final Fantasy VII*.\n\n<<<One-Winged Angel>>>"
