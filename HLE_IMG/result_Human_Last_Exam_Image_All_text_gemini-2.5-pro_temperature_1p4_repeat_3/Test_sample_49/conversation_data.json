    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency of the given circuit at node $a_0$. The circuit is an RC filter, specifically a low-pass filter, because the output is taken across a capacitor `C` that shunts high frequencies to ground. The cutoff frequency ($ω_c$ for angular frequency or $f_c$ for cyclical frequency) is the frequency at which the filter's output power is half its passband power, which for a first-order filter corresponds to the output voltage magnitude being $1/\\sqrt{2}$ times its DC value.\n\n**2. Formulate the Method**\nFor a simple RC low-pass filter, the cutoff angular frequency is given by the formula:\n$ω_c = \\frac{1}{τ}$\nwhere $τ$ is the time constant of the circuit, given by $τ = R_{th}C$.\n$R_{th}$ is the Thévenin equivalent resistance \"seen\" by the capacitor $C$.\nSo, our main task is to find the Thévenin resistance $R_{th}$ looking into the terminals across the capacitor, which are node $a_0$ and ground ($b_0$).\n\n**3. Calculate the Thévenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to turn off all independent sources in the circuit. The only independent source is the input voltage at node `IN` (which is connected to node $c_0$). Turning off a voltage source means replacing it with a short circuit, so we connect node $c_0$ to ground.\n$R_{th}$ is then the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground.\n\n**4. Analyze the Circuit for $R_{th}$**\nWith $c_0$ grounded, we look at the resistance from $a_0$ to ground.\nThe path is:\n- From $a_0$, there is a resistor $r$ to node $d_1$.\n- From $d_1$, the current flows into the rest of the infinite ladder network, eventually exiting at node $c_1$.\n- From $c_1$, there is a resistor $r$ to node $c_0$, which is grounded.\n\nThe structure suggests that the resistance from $a_0$ to ground is the series combination of three parts:\n1.  The resistor `r` between $a_0$ and $d_1$.\n2.  The equivalent resistance of the infinite ladder as seen from its terminals $d_1$ and $c_1$. Let's call this $Z_{in}$.\n3.  The resistor `r` between $c_1$ and $c_0$ (ground).\n\nSo, $R_{th} = r + Z_{in} + r = 2r + Z_{in}$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Input Impedance of the Infinite Ladder ($Z_{in}$)**\n$Z_{in}$ is the equivalent resistance of the infinite ladder looking into terminals $c_1$ and $d_1$. Due to the infinite and repeating nature of the ladder, the impedance looking into any stage `n` (terminals $c_n, d_n$) is the same. Let's call this $Z_{in}$.\n\nA single stage of the ladder (e.g., at terminals $c_n, d_n$) consists of:\n- A horizontal resistor `r` connected between $c_n$ and $d_n$.\n- A path through the next stage. This path consists of a vertical resistor `r` (from $c_n$ to $c_{n+1}$), the impedance of the rest of the ladder $Z_{in}$ (between $c_{n+1}$ and $d_{n+1}$), and another vertical resistor `r` (from $d_{n+1}$ to $d_n$).\n\nThe total impedance of a stage is the shunt resistor `r` in parallel with the series combination forming the path to the next stage. This gives us a recursive relationship:\n$Z_{in} = r \\parallel (r + Z_{in} + r) = r \\parallel (2r + Z_{in})$\n\n**6. Solve for $Z_{in}$**\nWe can solve this equation for $Z_{in}$:\n$Z_{in} = \\frac{r \\cdot (2r + Z_{in})}{r + (2r + Z_{in})} = \\frac{2r^2 + r Z_{in}}{3r + Z_{in}}$\n$Z_{in}(3r + Z_{in}) = 2r^2 + r Z_{in}$\n$3rZ_{in} + Z_{in}^2 = 2r^2 + r Z_{in}$\n$Z_{in}^2 + 2rZ_{in} - 2r^2 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for $Z_{in}$. Using the quadratic formula $Z_{in} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$Z_{in} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{(2r)^2 - 4(1)(-2r^2)}}{2(1)}$\n$Z_{in} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{4r^2 + 8r^2}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{12r^2}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}r}{2}$\n$Z_{in} = r(-1 \\pm \\sqrt{3})$\n\nSince resistance must be a positive physical quantity, we take the positive root:\n$Z_{in} = r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$\n\n**7. Final Calculation of $R_{th}$**\nNow we substitute the value of $Z_{in}$ back into the expression for $R_{th}$:\n$R_{th} = 2r + Z_{in} = 2r + r(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$\n$R_{th} = r(2 + \\sqrt{3} - 1) = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\n**8. Determine the Cutoff Frequency ($ω_c$)**\nFinally, we can find the cutoff angular frequency using the formula from Step 2:\n$ω_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\n$ω_c = \\frac{1}{r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThis expression gives the cutoff angular frequency in radians per second.\n\n<<<ω_c = 1 / ((1 + \\sqrt{3})rC)>>>"
