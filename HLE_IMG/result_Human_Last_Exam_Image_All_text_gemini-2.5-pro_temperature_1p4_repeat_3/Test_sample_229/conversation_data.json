    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to determine the song's title, musical style, and country of origin.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Musical Style Analysis:**\n    *   **Rhythm:** The melody is heavily syncopated, featuring many eighth notes and sixteenth notes with a distinct \"swing\" feel. This rhythmic characteristic is central to jazz music.\n    *   **Harmony:** The piece is a lead sheet, showing the melody with chord symbols above it (C, E7, F, G7, C-, A-, etc.). The chord progression uses standard jazz harmony, including a secondary dominant (E7, which is the V7 chord of A minor) and movement between major and minor chords (C to C-).\n    *   **Melody and Articulation:** The melody contains many slurs, grace notes, and arpeggiated figures. This suggests an improvisational and virtuosic style, often associated with solo instruments like the guitar or violin in a jazz context.\n    *   **Conclusion on Style:** The combination of swing rhythm, jazz chord progressions, and a virtuosic melodic line points directly to the **Gypsy Jazz** (also known as Jazz Manouche or Sinti Jazz) style.\n\n2.  **Song Identification (Title):**\n    *   The key signature is C major. The opening melodic phrase is very distinctive: G-G-C-B-A-G over a C major chord, followed by a phrase over an E7 chord.\n    *   This specific melody, along with the subsequent chord progression (C -> E7 -> F), is the clear signature of the jazz standard **\"Douce Ambiance\"**. While handwritten charts like this can have slight variations in the chords compared to official publications, the melody is an unmistakable match for this well-known tune.\n\n3.  **Country of Origin Analysis:**\n    *   The song \"Douce Ambiance\" was composed by the legendary guitarist **Django Reinhardt**.\n    *   Reinhardt, along with violinist St√©phane Grappelli, pioneered the Gypsy Jazz style in Paris with their group, the Quintette du Hot Club de France, in the 1930s and 1940s.\n    *   Given that the style was developed and the song was composed in Paris, the country of origin is **France**.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Handwritten Nature:** The sheet music is handwritten, which can lead to ambiguities (e.g., chord symbols might be written in a personal shorthand). However, the core musical information (notes, rhythms, main chords) is clear.\n*   **Lead Sheet Format:** This is not a full orchestral score but a lead sheet, common for jazz musicians. It provides the essential melody and harmony, leaving room for improvisation and interpretation by the performers.\n*   **Structural Markings:** The use of `D.S. al Coda` (indicated by \"TO GO OUT - TAKE ùÑã TO CODA\") is a standard musical instruction for navigating repeats and endings in a song.\n\nBy combining these points, we can confidently identify the details of the song.\n\n<<<Title: Douce Ambiance\nMusical Style: Gypsy Jazz (or Jazz Manouche)\nCountry of Origin: France>>>"
