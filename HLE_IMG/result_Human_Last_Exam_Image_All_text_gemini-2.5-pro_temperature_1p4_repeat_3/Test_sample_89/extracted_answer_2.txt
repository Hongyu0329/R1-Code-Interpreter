**Product A:** 
The structure is **2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole-6-carboxamide**. It consists of a five-membered pyrrolidine ring fused with a five-membered pyrrole ring, sharing a bridgehead nitrogen. A primary amide group (`-CONH2`) is attached to position 6 of the bicyclic system.

**Product B:**
The structure is **(Z)-1,2,3,6,7,8-hexahydro-pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazin-4-one**. It consists of a five-membered pyrrolidine ring fused to a six-membered dihydropyrazinone ring, sharing a bridgehead nitrogen and an adjacent carbon. A carbonyl group is present at position 4, and a double bond exists between positions 6 and 7 of the six-membered ring.

**Product C:**
The structure is **N-acetylsuccinimide** (also known as N-acetylpyrrolidine-2,5-dione). It is a five-membered succinimide ring (a pyrrolidine ring with carbonyl groups at positions 2 and 5) where the nitrogen atom is substituted with an acetyl group (`-COCH3`).
