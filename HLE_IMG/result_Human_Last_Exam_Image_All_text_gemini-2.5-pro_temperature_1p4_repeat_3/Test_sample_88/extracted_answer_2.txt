The three products A, B, and C have the following identities based on the reaction analysis:

*   **Product A (C14H20N2O3):** The [3+2] cycloaddition product of methyl propiolate and a C-acetylated azomethine ylide derived from the starting material. The azomethine ylide is formed via decarboxylation and is subsequently acetylated at its carbanionic center by acetic anhydride before cycloaddition.
*   **Product B (C12H14N2O3):** The oxidized product of the initial [3+2] cycloadduct. The azomethine ylide (formed via decarboxylation) reacts with methyl propiolate to give a primary adduct, which then undergoes dehydrogenation (loss of 4H) and N-oxidation of the substituent's imine nitrogen to yield product B.
*   **Product C (C11H16N2O3):** A side product formed from the acetylation of the starting material, without involving methyl propiolate. The amidine group of the starting material tautomerizes to an enamine, which is then acetylated on the nitrogen by acetic anhydride. Its structure is 1-(1-acetyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid.
