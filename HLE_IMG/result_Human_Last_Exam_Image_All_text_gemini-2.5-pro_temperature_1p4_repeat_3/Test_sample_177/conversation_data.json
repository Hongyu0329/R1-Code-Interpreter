    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Key Metric**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) when changing from the Baseline (Table 1) scenario to the Proposed (Table 2) scenario.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **VMT vs. PMT:** VMT stands for Vehicle Miles Traveled, which measures the distance traveled by vehicles. This is different from Person Miles Traveled (PMT), which measures the distance traveled by people. Since the question asks for VMT, the number of occupants in a car does not change the calculation for a single car trip. Therefore, the \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" data is not needed.\n*   **Car Modes:** We need to consider both car modes listed: \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\". The total car VMT is the sum of the VMT from these two modes.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Calculation Approach**\nTo find the total VMT, we need to calculate a VMT index for each scenario. This index is calculated by summing the VMT contributions from each trip distance category.\n\nThe formula for the VMT contribution of each distance category is:\n`VMT Contribution = (Share of total trips) × (Total Car Mode Share for that distance) × (Average Trip Distance)`\n\nThe total VMT Index will be the sum of these contributions across all four distance categories (0-3, 3-5, 5-10, and 10+ miles).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Baseline Car VMT Index (VMT_B) using data from Table 1**\n\n1.  **0-3 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 25% (1 occupant) + 28% (>2 occupants) = 53% or 0.53\n    *   VMT Contribution = 48% (trip share) × 53% (car share) × 1 mile = 0.48 × 0.53 × 1 = 0.2544\n\n2.  **3-5 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 38% + 43% = 81% or 0.81\n    *   VMT Contribution = 22% × 81% × 4 miles = 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = 0.7128\n\n3.  **5-10 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 40% + 45% = 85% or 0.85\n    *   VMT Contribution = 14% × 85% × 7.5 miles = 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = 0.8925\n\n4.  **10+ miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 42% + 47% = 89% or 0.89\n    *   VMT Contribution = 16% × 89% × 20 miles = 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = 2.8480\n\n5.  **Total Baseline VMT Index (VMT_B):**\n    *   VMT_B = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Proposed Car VMT Index (VMT_P) using data from Table 2**\n\n1.  **0-3 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 1% + 2% = 3% or 0.03\n    *   VMT Contribution = 48% × 3% × 1 mile = 0.48 × 0.03 × 1 = 0.0144\n\n2.  **3-5 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 8% + 19% = 27% or 0.27\n    *   VMT Contribution = 22% × 27% × 4 miles = 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = 0.2376\n\n3.  **5-10 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 14% + 27% = 41% or 0.41\n    *   VMT Contribution = 14% × 41% × 7.5 miles = 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = 0.4305\n\n4.  **10+ miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 16% + 33% = 49% or 0.49\n    *   VMT Contribution = 16% × 49% × 20 miles = 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = 1.5680\n\n5.  **Total Proposed VMT Index (VMT_P):**\n    *   VMT_P = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Percentage Reduction in Car VMT**\n\nThe formula for percentage reduction is:\n`Percentage Reduction = [(Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT] × 100%`\n\n*   Reduction = VMT_B - VMT_P = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   Percentage Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100%\n*   Percentage Reduction ≈ 0.52195 × 100% = 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
