    "*   **Step 1: Understand the Goal**\n    The question asks to identify which of the labeled phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L) can rotate freely in solution. Free rotation around a single bond occurs if the energy barrier, primarily due to steric hindrance, is low.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Molecular Structure**\n    The molecule is a large, octahedral Iridium(III) coordination complex. It is a cation.\n    The central Iridium (Ir) atom is bonded to three bidentate ligands.\n    *   **Ligand 1 (Rings E & F):** This is a 2,2'-bipyridine-type ligand, coordinating through two nitrogen atoms (one from ring E, one from ring F).\n    *   **Ligand 2 (Rings A & B):** This is a cyclometalating ligand, likely a substituted 2-phenylpyridine. Ring A is a phenyl ring, and ring B is a pyridine ring. It coordinates to Ir via a carbon atom from the phenyl ring (labeled C6 on ring A) and the nitrogen atom from the pyridine ring (B).\n    *   **Ligand 3 (Rings C & D):** This is another cyclometalating 2-phenylpyridine-type ligand, similar to the A/B ligand. It coordinates through a carbon from the phenyl ring C (labeled C6) and the nitrogen from the pyridine ring D.\n    *   **Substituents (G, H, J, K, L):** These are all phenyl rings attached as substituents to the main ligand framework. We need to determine if their rotation around the single C-C bond connecting them to the main structure is hindered.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze Each Phenyl Substituent for Rotational Freedom**\n    Steric hindrance is the key factor. If a rotating group is close to another bulky part of the molecule, its rotation will be restricted. We analyze the position of each substituent ring.\n\n    *   **Ring G:** Attached to C4 of the pyridyl ring F. The C4 position on a pyridine ring is *para* to the nitrogen atom. In the coordinated bipyridine ligand, substituents at the 4- and 4'-positions point outwards, away from the crowded metal center and the other ligands. Therefore, ring G is in a sterically unhindered environment and can **rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring H:** Attached to C4 of the phenyl ring A. On a phenyl ring, the C4 position is the *para* position. Regardless of the exact numbering convention used in the diagram for the connection points (C2-B, C6-Ir), the C4 position is the furthest from the backbone of the ppy ligand and the metal center. It points away from the congested core of the complex. Thus, ring H should be able to **rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring J:** Attached to C4 of the phenyl ring C. This situation is identical to that of ring H. Ring J is at a *para* position on its parent phenyl ring, pointing away from the metal center. It can **rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring K:** Attached to C3 of the phenyl ring A. The label shows the phenyl ring A is connected to the pyridine ring B at C2 and coordinates to the Ir at C6. The C3 position is *ortho* to the C2 position, where the bulky pyridine ring B is attached. Rotation of the phenyl ring K around its connecting bond will cause a severe steric clash with the adjacent pyridine ring B. This type of steric hindrance in *ortho*-substituted biaryl systems is well-known to prevent free rotation. Therefore, the rotation of ring K is **hindered**.\n\n    *   **Ring L:** Attached to C5 of the phenyl ring C. The phenyl ring C coordinates to the Iridium atom at C6. This means the C5 position is *ortho* to the site of metal coordination. Placing a bulky substituent like a phenyl ring at this position brings it into very close proximity with the Iridium center and the adjacent ligand (the bipyridine ligand, rings E/F). Any rotation would lead to a significant steric clash. Therefore, the rotation of ring L is **hindered**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude and Select the Answer**\n    Based on the analysis, the rings that can rotate freely are G, J, and H.\n    The rings with hindered rotation are K and L.\n    We look for the answer choice that lists G, J, and H.\n\n    *   A. G, J, L, K, H (Incorrect, includes hindered L and K)\n    *   B. G, J, L, H (Incorrect, includes hindered L)\n    *   C. G, J, K, H (Incorrect, includes hindered K)\n    *   D. L, K, J, H (Incorrect, includes hindered L and K)\n    *   **E. G, J, H** (Correct)\n    *   F. L, J, H (Incorrect, includes hindered L)\n    *   G. K, J, H (Incorrect, includes hindered K)\n    *   H. J, H (Incorrect, missing G)\n    *   I. J, G (Incorrect, missing H)\n    *   J. G, H (Incorrect, missing J)\n    *   K. G (Incorrect, missing J and H)\n    *   L. J (Incorrect, missing G and H)\n    *   M. H (Incorrect, missing G and J)\n    *   N. none\n\nThe correct choice is E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
