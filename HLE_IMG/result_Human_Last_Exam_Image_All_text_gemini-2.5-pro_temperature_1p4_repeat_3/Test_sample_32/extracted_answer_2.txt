The main distinguishing feature is the seta (the stalk of the sporophyte). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is very short and straight, causing the capsule to be immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a longer, distinctly curved or S-shaped seta, which holds the capsule clear of the leaves in a nodding or hanging position.
