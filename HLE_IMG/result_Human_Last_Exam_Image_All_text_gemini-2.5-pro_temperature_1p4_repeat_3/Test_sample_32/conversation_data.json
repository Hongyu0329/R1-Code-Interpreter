    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the components of a moss sporophyte:** A moss sporophyte is the diploid, spore-producing generation of the plant. It typically consists of three parts:\n    *   **Foot:** Embedded in the gametophyte, absorbing nutrients.\n    *   **Seta:** The stalk that elevates the capsule. Its length and shape are important identification features.\n    *   **Capsule (sporangium):** The structure at the top of the seta that produces and releases spores. Its shape, orientation, and position relative to the leaves are also key features.\n\n2.  **Analyze the characteristics of *Grimmia montana*'s sporophyte:**\n    *   **Seta:** The seta of *Grimmia montana* is very short (typically 0.2â€“0.5 mm long) and, crucially, it is **straight**.\n    *   **Capsule Position:** Because the seta is so short, the capsule is described as **immersed** or **emergent**. This means it is either completely nestled within the upper leaves (perichaetial leaves) or just barely pokes out above them. The capsule is held erect.\n\n3.  **Analyze the characteristics of *Grimmia curviseta*'s sporophyte:**\n    *   **Seta:** The scientific name *curviseta* provides a direct clue. \"Curvi-\" means curved, and \"seta\" is the stalk. The seta of this species is distinctly **curved**, often in an S-shape (described as cygneous or swan-necked). It is also longer than the seta of *G. montana*.\n    *   **Capsule Position:** The longer, curved seta **exserts** the capsule, meaning it is held well clear of the perichaetial leaves. The curvature often causes the capsule to be **cernuous** (nodding) or pendulous (hanging).\n\n4.  **Identify the main distinguishing feature:** Comparing the two species, the most prominent and easily observable difference (\"at a glance\") in the sporophyte is the **seta**.\n    *   *G. montana*: Straight, short seta; immersed/emergent capsule.\n    *   *G. curviseta*: Curved, longer seta; exserted, nodding capsule.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Presence of Sporophytes:** This distinction can only be made when the mosses have mature sporophytes. Without them, identification relies on gametophyte characteristics, which can be more subtle.\n*   **\"At a glance\":** This phrase implies a macroscopic or easily visible feature. The posture of the capsule (immersed vs. exserted and nodding) resulting from the different setae is a perfect example of such a feature.\n*   **The provided image:** The image shows moss capsules that are immersed or emergent on very short, straight setae. This morphology is characteristic of *Grimmia montana* (or a closely related species with similar sporophytes), not *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe main difference in the sporophyte that helps distinguish *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the structure of the seta and the resulting position of the capsule. *Grimmia montana* has a short, straight seta with an immersed or emergent capsule, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a distinctively curved seta that holds the capsule exserted and often nodding.\n\n<<<The main distinguishing feature is the seta (the stalk of the sporophyte). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is very short and straight, causing the capsule to be immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a longer, distinctly curved or S-shaped seta, which holds the capsule clear of the leaves in a nodding or hanging position.>>>"
