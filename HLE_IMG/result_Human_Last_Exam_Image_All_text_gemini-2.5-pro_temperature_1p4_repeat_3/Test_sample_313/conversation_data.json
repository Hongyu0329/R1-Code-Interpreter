    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n1.  **Analyze the first part of the clue:** \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n    *   **Image Identification:** The man on the right, receiving the award, is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov, a professional ice hockey player.\n    *   **Event Identification:** The event is the 2019 NHL Awards ceremony. Although the actual date was June 19, 2019, the date given is close and likely refers to when the photo became widely circulated.\n    *   **Significance of the Event:** At this ceremony, Nikita Kucherov had a historic night, winning three of the most prestigious individual awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy (league MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player as voted by players), and the Art Ross Trophy (top point scorer).\n    *   **Connecting to \"X Y\":** Winning three major awards in a single season/event is commonly referred to as a \"hat trick\" of awards. So, what is pictured is a \"hat trick\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the second part of the clue:** \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n    *   **Historical Context:** This clue points to a historical industrial process involving mercury.\n    *   **The Hatter's Trade:** In the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries, a crucial step in making high-quality felt for hats involved a process called \"carroting.\" This process used a solution of mercuric nitrate to treat animal fur.\n    *   **Toxicity:** The mercury used in this process was highly toxic. Hat-makers (hatters) who were frequently exposed to mercury vapors often developed severe neurological damage, a condition known as erethism or \"mad hatter disease.\" This is the origin of the idiom \"mad as a hatter.\"\n    *   **Cessation of Use:** Due to its extreme toxicity, the use of mercury salts in felt-making has been discontinued.\n\n3.  **Synthesize both clues to find \"X Y\":**\n    *   The common term that links both clues is \"Hat Trick\".\n    *   The first clue describes a modern, sporting \"hat trick\" (three major awards).\n    *   The second clue refers to the origin of the object in the phrase's nameâ€”the hat. The \"trick\" of the hatter's trade involved using mercury. So, the \"hatter's trick\" (a pun on \"hat trick\") has ceased to be used because of mercury's toxicity.\n    *   Therefore, \"X Y\" is \"Hat Trick\".\n\n<<<Hat trick>>>"
