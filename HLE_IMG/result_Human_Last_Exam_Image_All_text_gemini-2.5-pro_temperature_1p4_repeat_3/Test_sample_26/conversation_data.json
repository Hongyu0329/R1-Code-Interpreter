    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key and Measure**\n*   **Piece:** Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor, Op. 13 (\"Pathétique\"), 1st movement (Allegro di molto e con brio section).\n*   **Key Signature:** The key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭), which indicates the key of C minor or E♭ major. The sonata is in C minor, which is the tonic key for this section.\n*   **Measure:** The question asks for the analysis of measure 30. Looking at the score, measure 28 is marked. We can count two measures to the right to find measure 30, which is highlighted by a circle in the provided image.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Notes in Measure 30**\nMeasure 30 is divided into two main harmonic events, one on each of the two beats (the time signature is 2/2, or *alla breve*).\n\n*   **Beat 1:**\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** Plays a G octave (G3 and G2). The principal bass note is G.\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** Plays four sixteenth notes: G4, E♭5, C5, B♮4.\n    *   **Combined Notes on Beat 1:** The essential notes present are G (in the bass), and G, E♭, C from the right hand. The B♮ is a non-chord tone (a chromatic passing tone leading to the C of the next beat).\n\n*   **Beat 2:**\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** Plays an F♯ octave (F♯2 and F♯1). The bass note is F♯.\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** Plays four sixteenth notes: C5, A♭4, G4, F♯4.\n    *   **Combined Notes on Beat 2:** The notes are F♯, A♭, C, and G.\n\n**Step 3: Roman Numeral Analysis of Each Beat**\n\n*   **Analysis of Beat 1:**\n    *   The primary notes are G, C, and E♭. These three notes form a **C minor triad**.\n    *   The bass note is G, which is the fifth of the C minor triad.\n    *   In Roman numeral analysis, a triad with its fifth in the bass is in **second inversion**, which is indicated by the figures **6/4**.\n    *   Since the key is C minor and the C minor triad is the tonic chord, its Roman numeral is **i**.\n    *   Therefore, the harmony on beat 1 is a **i6/4** chord. This specific usage is known as a \"cadential 6/4,\" as it functions to prepare the dominant chord.\n\n*   **Analysis of Beat 2:**\n    *   The bass note is F♯. In the key of C minor, the dominant chord is G major (V). F♯ is the leading tone to G.\n    *   A chord built on the leading tone to the dominant functions as a **secondary leading-tone chord**. Its purpose is to create strong harmonic tension that resolves to the dominant (V).\n    *   The Roman numeral for this function is **vii°/V** (a diminished triad built on the leading tone of the dominant) or **vii°7/V** (a fully diminished seventh chord). The specific notes (F♯, A♭, C, G) are a highly chromatic version of this chord, but its function is unambiguous.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Single Roman Numeral for the Measure**\n*   The question asks for *the* Roman numeral for measure 30, implying a single answer.\n*   When a measure contains more than one chord, the harmony on the strongest beat (the downbeat) is typically considered the primary harmony for the measure.\n*   In measure 30, the downbeat (beat 1) contains the **i6/4** chord. The second beat contains a more transitional, chromatic harmony.\n*   Therefore, the most accurate and standard analysis for measure 30 as a whole is based on the harmony of its first beat.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chord on the downbeat of measure 30 is a C minor triad in second inversion. In the key of C minor, this is represented by the Roman numeral **i6/4**.\n\n<<<i6/4>>>"
