    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Crystal Structure and Viewing Direction:** The question asks to identify the pattern of a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal lattice when viewed along the [110] direction.\n    *   **FCC Structure:** An FCC lattice consists of atoms at the eight corners of a cube and at the center of each of its six faces.\n    *   **[110] Viewing Direction:** This direction corresponds to looking along a face diagonal of the cubic unit cell. When we view along a specific direction, the 3D atomic positions are projected onto a 2D plane perpendicular to that direction.\n\n2.  **Predict the Theoretical Projection Pattern:**\n    *   The projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction results in a specific repeating 2D pattern.\n    *   The unit cell of this 2D pattern is a rectangle.\n    *   The sides of this rectangle correspond to the crystal directions [001] and [1-10], which are perpendicular to the [110] viewing direction.\n    *   Let 'a' be the lattice constant of the original cube. The length of the repeating unit along the [001] direction is 'a'. The length of the repeating unit along the [1-10] direction is the distance between (0,0,0) and (1,-1,0), which is `sqrt(a^2 + (-a)^2 + 0^2) = a√2`.\n    *   Therefore, the projected unit cell is a rectangle with side lengths in the ratio of `a√2 / a = √2 ≈ 1.414`.\n    *   The atomic arrangement within this rectangular unit cell consists of atoms at the four corners and one atom precisely at the center. This is called a **centered rectangular lattice**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Option:**\n\n    *   **Image A:** This image displays atoms on a simple rectangular grid. There are no atoms in the center of the rectangles. This pattern is characteristic of a simple cubic lattice viewed along [110], not an FCC lattice.\n\n    *   **Image B:** This image shows a centered rectangular pattern. Let's find a unit rectangle, for example, defined by the corner atoms at approximately (1,3), (7,3), (1,9), and (7,9). There is an atom in the center at (4,6). Now, let's check the ratio of the side lengths. The width is `7 - 1 = 6` units. The height is `9 - 3 = 6` units. The ratio is `6/6 = 1`. This is a **centered square**, which is the characteristic view of an FCC lattice along the **[100]** direction (viewing perpendicular to a face), not the [110] direction.\n\n    *   **Image D:** This image displays a pattern with hexagonal symmetry, resembling a honeycomb structure. This is the characteristic view of an FCC lattice along the **[111]** direction (viewing along a body diagonal).\n\n    *   **Image C:** This is the remaining option. Let's verify if it matches our theoretical prediction. We are looking for a centered rectangle with a side ratio of √2.\n        *   Let's identify a rectangle formed by the atoms. We can see atoms at approximate coordinates (2.5, 7.5), (7, 7.5), (2.5, 14), and (7, 14). These four atoms form a rectangle.\n        *   Let's calculate the side lengths of this rectangle. The width is `7 - 2.5 = 4.5` units. The height is `14 - 7.5 = 6.5` units.\n        *   The ratio of the sides is `Height / Width = 6.5 / 4.5 ≈ 1.44`. This value is very close to the theoretical value of `√2 ≈ 1.414`.\n        *   Now, let's check for the centering atom. The center of this rectangle would be at `x = (2.5 + 7) / 2 = 4.75` and `y = (7.5 + 14) / 2 = 10.75`. Looking at the image, there is an atom at approximately (5, 12), which is very close to the calculated center. The small difference is likely due to the perspective of the drawing.\n        *   Thus, the pattern in Image C is a centered rectangle with the correct side ratio for an FCC [110] view.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, Image C correctly depicts a face-centered cubic structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
