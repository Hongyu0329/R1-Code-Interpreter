The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **V and C1 immunoglobulin-like domains** of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE), as depicted in the diagram.

S100B could be used as a **prognostic marker** in the pathology of neurological disorders. It cannot be used solely as a diagnostic or adjunct marker because it is over-expressed in multiple diseases, lacking specificity. However, its role as a prognostic marker is well-supported because its interaction with RAGE directly activates downstream signaling pathways (such as NFkB and JNK/JUN) that lead to core pathological events like apoptosis, neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Therefore, the level of S100B expression can directly reflect the intensity of the disease process and be used to predict the likely severity and progression of the disorder.
