    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the sex of each insect.\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Bees and Wasps (Hymenoptera):**\n\n1.  **Antennae:** Males typically have longer antennae with more segments (13 in most bees/wasps) compared to females (12 segments). The tips of the antennae in some male wasps are also distinctly curled.\n2.  **Abdomen (Gaster):** Females have a stinger (a modified ovipositor), making the tip of their abdomen appear more pointed. Males lack a stinger, so their abdomen tip is often more rounded or blunt. Males also usually have one more visible abdominal segment than females (7 vs. 6).\n3.  **Facial Markings:** Males of many bee and wasp species have more extensive yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus) than females.\n4.  **Pollen-Collecting Hairs (Scopae):** The question states the collection is from taxa without scopae on their legs. Scopae are found on the hind legs of most female bees (but not wasps or cuckoo bees) for collecting pollen. Cuckoo bees are parasitic and don't collect pollen, thus females lack scopae. Some bee families (like Megachilidae) have a scopa on the underside of the abdomen instead of the legs. This initial information helps identify the types of insects we are looking at.\n\n**Analysis of Each Pair:**\n\n**Pair A: Cuckoo Bees (likely genus *Coelioxys*)**\n*   These are cleptoparasitic bees, which fits the \"without scopae\" description. Females have a uniquely shaped abdomen for piercing the host's nest cell to lay an egg.\n*   **Insect on the left:** The abdomen is very long and tapers to a single, sharp, conical point. This is the characteristic structure of a female *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Insect on the right:** The abdomen is also tapered but ends in a set of multiple spines or prongs, not a single point. This is the characteristic abdominal tip of a male *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Conclusion for Pair A:** Left is Female, Right is Male (F, M). This corresponds to **option 4**.\n\n**Pair B: Paper Wasps (genus *Polistes*)**\n*   Wasps do not have scopae. A key feature for sexing *Polistes* is the antennae.\n*   **Insect on the left:** The antennae are straight all the way to the tip. The abdomen ends in a point, which houses the stinger. This is a female.\n*   **Insect on the right:** The tips of the antennae are distinctly curled or hooked. This is a definitive characteristic of male paper wasps. The tip of the abdomen is also blunter than the female's. This is a male.\n*   **Conclusion for Pair B:** Left is Female, Right is Male (F, M). This corresponds to **option 4**.\n\n**Pair C: Long-horned Bees (likely tribe Eucerini)**\n*   This pair requires close attention to antennae and facial features, as the \"no scopa\" rule can be misleading if interpreted too strictly for all shown examples. The most reliable dimorphic traits should be used.\n*   **Insect on the left:** This bee has extremely long antennae that curve back well beyond its head. This is the defining feature of a male \"long-horned bee\". You can also see a pale yellow patch on its face (clypeus), which is also a common male trait.\n*   **Insect on the right:** This bee has much shorter antennae, typical for a female of this group. The body is robust, and it is actively foraging, a behavior common in females gathering provisions.\n*   **Conclusion for Pair C:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to **option 3**.\n\n**Final Compilation:**\n*   Pair A: F, M -> **4**\n*   Pair B: F, M -> **4**\n*   Pair C: M, F -> **3**\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of these indices.\n\n<<<4, 4, 3>>>"
