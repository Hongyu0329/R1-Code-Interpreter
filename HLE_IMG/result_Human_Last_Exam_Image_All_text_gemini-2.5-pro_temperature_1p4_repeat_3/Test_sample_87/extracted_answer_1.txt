A is a tetracyclic compound formed by the Michael addition of a second molecule of methyl propiolate to product B, followed by cyclization. Its structure is methyl (Z)-2-(1-(2-methoxycarbonylvinyl)-1,2,3,5,6,10b-hexahydro-7H-dipyrrolo[1,2-a:2',1'-d]pyrazin-10-yl)acetate.
B is a tricyclic compound, methyl 7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-6H-dipyrrolo[1,2-a:2',1'-d]pyrazin-1-carboxylate, formed from the [8π+2π] cycloaddition.
C is the mixed anhydride of the starting material, 1-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acetic anhydride.
