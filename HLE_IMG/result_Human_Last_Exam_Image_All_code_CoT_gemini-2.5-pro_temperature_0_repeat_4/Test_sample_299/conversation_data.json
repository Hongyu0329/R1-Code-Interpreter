    "This is a mate-in-2 puzzle. Here is my step-by-step thinking process to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n1.  **Analyze the Position:** White has a significant material and positional advantage. The Black King on e4 is extremely exposed. The key is to find a forcing sequence of moves that leads to an unavoidable checkmate. The Black King's main escape route is to the d4 square.\n\n2.  **Identify the Candidate First Move:** I need to find a move for White that forces checkmate on the second move, regardless of Black's reply. I considered several moves:\n    *   `1. Rf4+`: This leads to `1... Kxf4`. After this capture, I analyzed White's possible checks (like `2. Ng6+`), but found that the Black King could always escape (in this case, to e4, which is not covered).\n    *   `1. Qa2`: A quiet move threatening `2. Qd2#`. However, Black can defend against this by playing `1... f3`, which gives the King an escape square on d3.\n    *   The most promising line of attack involves using the knights. Let's analyze `1. Ne7-d6+`. This move checks the Black King and forces an immediate response.\n\n3.  **Analyze Black's Forced Responses:** After `1. Ne7-d6+`, the Black King is in check and must move. There are only two legal moves:\n    *   **Variation 1:** The King captures the Queen with `1... Kxd5`.\n    *   **Variation 2:** The King moves to d4 with `1... Kd4`.\n\n4.  **Find the Mating Second Move for Each Variation:**\n    *   **If Black plays `1... Kxd5`:** The Black King is now on d5. White can deliver checkmate with `2. Nb7-c5#`. Let's verify:\n        *   The King on d5 is checked by the Knight on c5.\n        *   Escape squares are covered as follows: c4 (by pawn b4), e4 (by Knight d6), d4 (by Knight d6), e6 (by Knight d6). The square c6 is occupied by Black's Rook, and d6 is occupied by White's Knight. It is checkmate.\n\n    *   **If Black plays `1... Kd4`:** The Black King is now on d4. White can deliver checkmate with the same move, `2. Nb7-c5#`. This move creates a powerful **double check**:\n        *   The King on d4 is checked by the Knight that just moved to c5.\n        *   The King on d4 is also checked by the Knight on d6 (a discovered check).\n        *   A double check cannot be blocked or the checking pieces captured; the King must move.\n        *   Let's verify the escape squares: c3 (by Bishop g1), d3 (by Rook f3), e3 (by Rook f3), c4 (by pawn b4), e4 (by Knight d6). The squares c5, d5, and e5 are occupied. It is checkmate.\n\nSince both of Black's legal responses lead to an unavoidable checkmate on the next move, `1. Ne7-d6+` is the correct solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function prints the solution to the chess puzzle.\n  The puzzle is a mate in 2 for White.\n  \"\"\"\n  print(\"The solution is a forced checkmate in two moves, starting with a knight check.\")\n  print(\"The first move is 1. Ne7-d6+.\")\n  print(\"This leaves Black with two possible king moves, both of which lead to checkmate on the next turn.\")\n  print(\"\\nHere are the two variations:\")\n  \n  print(\"\\nVariation 1 (if Black captures the Queen):\")\n  print(\"1. Ne7-d6+   Kxd5\")\n  print(\"2. Nb7-c5#\")\n  \n  print(\"\\nVariation 2 (if Black moves the King to d4):\")\n  print(\"1. Ne7-d6+   Kd4\")\n  print(\"2. Nb7-c5#\")\n\nsolve_chess_puzzle()\n```\n<<<1. Ne7-d6+>>>"
