    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to identify the country from the Google Trends graph:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph's Structure:** The graph displays search interest over time for three distinct topics, represented by red, yellow, and blue lines. The x-axis shows a timeline from late 2019 to mid-2023. The y-axis represents relative search interest.\n\n2.  **Identify Patterns:** I observe that each colored line has sharp, recurring spikes that occur at roughly the same time each year. This pattern is characteristic of annual events, such as holidays or anniversaries.\n\n3.  **Pinpoint the Timing of the Spikes:**\n    *   **Blue Line:** Shows a distinct spike every year around late May. The tick mark for \"May 28, 2023\" aligns perfectly with the 2023 spike. This timing strongly corresponds to **Memorial Day** in the United States, which occurs on the last Monday of May.\n    *   **Yellow Line:** Shows a distinct spike every year around the end of August or the beginning of September. The tick mark for \"Aug 29, 2021\" is right before the 2021 spike. This timing strongly corresponds to **Labor Day** in the United States, which occurs on the first Monday of September.\n    *   **Red Line:** Shows a prominent spike every year in late January or early February. Given that the other two events are major US federal holidays, this spike likely represents another one. The timing fits perfectly with **Martin Luther King Jr. Day**, which is celebrated on the third Monday of January.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings:** The three search trends correspond to the annual commemorations of:\n    *   Martin Luther King Jr. Day (January)\n    *   Memorial Day (May)\n    *   Labor Day (September)\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** All three of these are significant federal holidays in the **United States**, each commemorating a major aspect of the nation's history (the Civil Rights Movement, fallen military personnel, and the labor movement). Therefore, the country in question is the United States.\n\n```python\ndef solve_country_mystery():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided Google Trends graph to identify the country.\n    \n    Analysis:\n    1. The graph shows three distinct time series (red, yellow, blue) with recurring annual spikes in search interest. This indicates annual events or holidays.\n    2. The blue line spikes consistently in late May, which corresponds to Memorial Day in the United States.\n    3. The yellow line spikes consistently in early September, which corresponds to Labor Day in the United States.\n    4. The red line spikes consistently in January, which corresponds to Martin Luther King Jr. Day in the United States.\n    \n    Conclusion:\n    Since all three historic events/holidays are specific to one country, the country is the United States.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    country = \"United States\"\n    event1 = \"Martin Luther King Jr. Day (January - Red Line)\"\n    event2 = \"Memorial Day (May - Blue Line)\"\n    event3 = \"Labor Day (September - Yellow Line)\"\n    \n    print(\"Based on the annual search interest spikes, the events correspond to major US holidays:\")\n    print(f\"1. {event1}\")\n    print(f\"2. {event2}\")\n    print(f\"3. {event3}\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the country is the United States.\")\n\nsolve_country_mystery()\n```\n<<<United States>>>"
