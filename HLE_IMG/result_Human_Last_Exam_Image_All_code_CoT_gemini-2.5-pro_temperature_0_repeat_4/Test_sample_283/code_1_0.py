    This function analyzes the provided Google Trends graph to identify the country.
    
    Analysis:
    1. The graph shows three distinct time series (red, yellow, blue) with recurring annual spikes in search interest. This indicates annual events or holidays.
    2. The blue line spikes consistently in late May, which corresponds to Memorial Day in the United States.
    3. The yellow line spikes consistently in early September, which corresponds to Labor Day in the United States.
    4. The red line spikes consistently in January, which corresponds to Martin Luther King Jr. Day in the United States.
    
    Conclusion:
    Since all three historic events/holidays are specific to one country, the country is the United States.
