    "To calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the total Car VMT for the Baseline scenario.** For each distance category, we will multiply the share of total trips by the total car mode share (1 occupant + >2 occupants) and the average trip distance. Then, we sum these values across all distance categories to get a total VMT index.\n2.  **Calculate the total Car VMT for the Proposed scenario.** We will perform the same calculation as in step 1, but using the mode share data from the Proposed table.\n3.  **Calculate the percentage reduction.** The formula is: `((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100`.\n\nThe carpool occupancy figures are not needed for this calculation, as VMT refers to the miles traveled by the vehicle, regardless of the number of people inside.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_vmt_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage reduction in Car VMT based on the provided tables.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data from the tables\n    share_of_trips = [0.48, 0.22, 0.14, 0.16]\n    avg_distances = [1, 4, 7.5, 20]\n    distance_categories = [\"0-3 miles\", \"3-5 miles\", \"5-10 miles\", \"10+ miles\"]\n\n    # Baseline car mode shares\n    baseline_car_1_occ = [0.25, 0.38, 0.40, 0.42]\n    baseline_car_multi_occ = [0.28, 0.43, 0.45, 0.47]\n\n    # Proposed car mode shares\n    proposed_car_1_occ = [0.01, 0.08, 0.14, 0.16]\n    proposed_car_multi_occ = [0.02, 0.19, 0.27, 0.33]\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate Baseline Car VMT ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate Baseline Car VMT Index\")\n    print(\"VMT Index = Sum of (Share of Trips * Total Car Share * Average Distance) for each category\\n\")\n    \n    baseline_total_car_share = [(c1 + c2) for c1, c2 in zip(baseline_car_1_occ, baseline_car_multi_occ)]\n    baseline_vmt_components = []\n    \n    print(\"Baseline Calculation:\")\n    for i in range(len(distance_categories)):\n        component = share_of_trips[i] * baseline_total_car_share[i] * avg_distances[i]\n        baseline_vmt_components.append(component)\n        print(f\"- {distance_categories[i]:<10}: {share_of_trips[i]} (trip share) * ({baseline_car_1_occ[i]} + {baseline_car_multi_occ[i]}) (car share) * {avg_distances[i]} (miles) = {component:.4f}\")\n\n    baseline_vmt = sum(baseline_vmt_components)\n    print(f\"\\nTotal Baseline VMT Index = {' + '.join([f'{c:.4f}' for c in baseline_vmt_components])} = {baseline_vmt:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate Proposed Car VMT ---\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate Proposed Car VMT Index\")\n    \n    proposed_total_car_share = [(c1 + c2) for c1, c2 in zip(proposed_car_1_occ, proposed_car_multi_occ)]\n    proposed_vmt_components = []\n\n    print(\"Proposed Calculation:\")\n    for i in range(len(distance_categories)):\n        component = share_of_trips[i] * proposed_total_car_share[i] * avg_distances[i]\n        proposed_vmt_components.append(component)\n        print(f\"- {distance_categories[i]:<10}: {share_of_trips[i]} (trip share) * ({proposed_car_1_occ[i]} + {proposed_car_multi_occ[i]}) (car share) * {avg_distances[i]} (miles) = {component:.4f}\")\n\n    proposed_vmt = sum(proposed_vmt_components)\n    print(f\"\\nTotal Proposed VMT Index = {' + '.join([f'{c:.4f}' for c in proposed_vmt_components])} = {proposed_vmt:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate Percentage Reduction ---\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate Percentage Reduction\")\n    vmt_reduction = baseline_vmt - proposed_vmt\n    percentage_reduction = (vmt_reduction / baseline_vmt) * 100\n    \n    print(f\"VMT Reduction = Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT\")\n    print(f\"VMT Reduction = {baseline_vmt:.4f} - {proposed_vmt:.4f} = {vmt_reduction:.4f}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nPercentage Reduction = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT) * 100\")\n    print(f\"Percentage Reduction = ({vmt_reduction:.4f} / {baseline_vmt:.4f}) * 100 = {percentage_reduction:.1f}%\")\n    \n    return percentage_reduction\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    result = calculate_vmt_reduction()\n    print(f\"\\n<<<The percentage of Car VMT that can be reduced is {result:.1f}%>>>\")\n    print(f\"<<<{result:.1f}>>>\")\n```"
