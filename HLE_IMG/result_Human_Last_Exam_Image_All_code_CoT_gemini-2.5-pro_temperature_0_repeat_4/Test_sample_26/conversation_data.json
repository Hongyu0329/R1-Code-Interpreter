    "Here is my plan to solve this music theory question:\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Signature:** The piece is in C minor, as indicated by the three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭) in the key signature.\n2.  **Locate Measure 30:** I will find measure 30 on the provided sheet music. It is the measure immediately following the G7 chord in measure 29.\n3.  **Analyze the Notes:** I will identify all the notes played in both the right hand (treble clef) and the left hand (bass clef) within measure 30.\n    *   **Left Hand:** Plays G octaves throughout the measure.\n    *   **Right Hand:** Plays a pattern of sixteenth notes. The main harmonic notes are G, B-natural, and D. The F# is a non-chord tone, specifically an upper neighbor to G, and resolves quickly.\n4.  **Determine the Chord:** The essential notes that form the harmony in this measure are G, B-natural, and D. This combination forms a G major triad.\n5.  **Determine the Roman Numeral:** In the key of C minor, the note G is the fifth scale degree (the dominant). A major triad built on the dominant is represented by the Roman numeral V. The use of B-natural (the leading tone) instead of the diatonic B-flat is standard practice for dominant chords in a minor key to create a stronger pull to the tonic.\n6.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that prints out this analysis step-by-step and provides the final Roman numeral.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_measure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, 1st movement,\n    to determine the correct Roman numeral.\n    \"\"\"\n    key = \"C minor\"\n    measure_number = 30\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify the key\n    print(f\"Step 1: The key signature has three flats (Bb, Eb, Ab), indicating the key of {key}.\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Analyze the notes in the measure\n    left_hand_notes = \"G\"\n    right_hand_chord_tones = \"G, B-natural, D\"\n    right_hand_non_chord_tone = \"F#\"\n    \n    print(f\"Step 2: In measure {measure_number}, the left hand plays '{left_hand_notes}' octaves.\")\n    print(f\"         The right hand plays chord tones '{right_hand_chord_tones}'.\")\n    print(f\"         The '{right_hand_non_chord_tone}' is a brief, non-chord tone (an upper neighbor to G).\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Determine the chord\n    chord_notes = \"G, B-natural, D\"\n    chord_name = \"G major triad\"\n    print(f\"Step 3: The essential notes forming the harmony are {chord_notes}, which create a {chord_name}.\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Determine the Roman numeral\n    scale_degree = 5\n    function = \"Dominant\"\n    roman_numeral = \"V\"\n    \n    print(f\"Step 4: In the key of {key}, G is the {scale_degree}th scale degree, which is the {function}.\")\n    print(f\"         A major triad built on the dominant is represented by the Roman numeral '{roman_numeral}'.\")\n    \n    # Final Answer\n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer:\")\n    print(f\"The correct Roman numeral for measure {measure_number} is {roman_numeral}.\")\n\nanalyze_measure()\n```\n<<<V>>>"
