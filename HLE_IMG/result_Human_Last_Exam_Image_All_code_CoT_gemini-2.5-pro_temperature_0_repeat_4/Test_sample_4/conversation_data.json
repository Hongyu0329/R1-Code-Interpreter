    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThe knot shown in the image is known in knot theory as the 9_42 knot. Its Jones polynomial is a standard, known invariant. The Python code below will construct and print this polynomial, `p(t)`, formatted in decreasing degree order as you requested.\n\nThe code represents the polynomial as a list of terms, where each term is a pair of (coefficient, power). It then iterates through these terms to build the final string representation, correctly handling signs, coefficients, and powers to match standard mathematical notation.\n\n```python\ndef get_jones_polynomial_9_42():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the Jones polynomial for the 9_42 knot.\n    The polynomial is represented by its coefficients and powers.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Jones polynomial for the 9_42 knot is:\n    # t^2 - t + 1 - t^-1 + t^-2 - t^-3 + t^-4\n    # We represent this as a list of (coefficient, power) tuples\n    # in decreasing order of power.\n    poly_terms = [\n        (1, 2),\n        (-1, 1),\n        (1, 0),\n        (-1, -1),\n        (1, -2),\n        (-1, -3),\n        (1, -4)\n    ]\n\n    result_parts = []\n    is_first_term = True\n\n    for coeff, power in poly_terms:\n        # Build the string for the current term\n        term_str = \"\"\n\n        # Handle sign\n        if not is_first_term:\n            if coeff > 0:\n                term_str += \" + \"\n            else:\n                term_str += \" - \"\n        elif coeff < 0:\n            term_str += \"-\"\n\n        # Handle coefficient\n        abs_coeff = abs(coeff)\n        if abs_coeff != 1 or power == 0:\n            term_str += str(abs_coeff)\n\n        # Handle variable and power\n        if power != 0:\n            if power == 1:\n                term_str += \"t\"\n            else:\n                # To ensure all numbers are output, we explicitly show the powers\n                term_str += f\"t^{power}\"\n\n        result_parts.append(term_str)\n        is_first_term = False\n\n    # Print the final polynomial string\n    print(\"\".join(result_parts))\n\nget_jones_polynomial_9_42()\n```\n<<<t^2 - t + 1 - t^-1 + t^-2 - t^-3 + t^-4>>>"
