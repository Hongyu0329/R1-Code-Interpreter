def solve_simulation_puzzle():
    """
    This function analyzes the four triple-slit simulations to find the unique parameter for each.

    Encoding Key:
    w1 -> 1, w2 -> 2, w3 -> 3
    u1 -> 4, u2 -> 5, u3 -> 6
    h1 -> 7, h2 -> 8, h3 -> 9

    Rules for each simulation:
    1) One parameter is identical across all slits.
    2) One parameter strictly increases or decreases across the slits.
    3) One parameter differs for only one slit (this is the one we need to identify).

    # --- Analysis of Simulation 1 ---
    # Observation 1 (Intensity/h): Intensities increase from left to right (h1 < h2 < h3). This is monotonic (Rule 2).
    # Observation 2 (Width/w): The widths of the three beams appear identical. This is the identical parameter (Rule 1).
    # Deduction (Wave Number/u): By elimination, 'u' must be the unique parameter (Rule 3). The pattern is asymmetrically distorted towards the left, indicating the left slit's wave number (u1) is unique.

    # --- Analysis of Simulation 2 ---
    # Observation 1 (Intensity/h): The intensities of the three slits are identical. This is the identical parameter (Rule 1).
    # Observation 2 (Pattern Tilt/u): The entire pattern is tilted to the right. This indicates a monotonic change in 'u' across the slits (Rule 2).
    # Deduction (Width/w): By elimination, 'w' must be the unique parameter (Rule 3). The middle slit (w2) is visibly wider than the two outer slits, which look equal.

    # --- Analysis of Simulation 3 ---
    # Observation 1 (Pattern Tilt/u): The pattern is symmetric and not tilted. This means 'u' is identical for all slits (Rule 1).
    # Observation 2 (Width/w): The beam widths increase from left to right (w1 < w2 < w3). This is monotonic (Rule 2).
    # Deduction (Intensity/h): By elimination, 'h' must be the unique parameter (Rule 3). The middle slit (h2) is dimmer than the two outer slits, which appear equally bright.

    # Observation 2 (Width/w): The beam widths increase from left to right (w1 < w2 < w3). This is monotonic (Rule 2).
    # Deduction (Wave Number/u): By elimination, 'u' must be the unique parameter (Rule 3). The pattern is not tilted, but the interference is distorted, especially on the right side. This indicates the right slit's wave number (u3) is unique.
