    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that determines the stereochemical assignment for each of the four stereocenters in the reaction.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Analyze the first stereocenter in the acyl chloride reactant on the left.\n2.  Analyze the second stereocenter in the alcohol reactant.\n3.  Analyze the third stereocenter in the ester product, which originates from the alcohol. The configuration is retained.\n4.  Analyze the fourth stereocenter in the ester product, which originates from the acyl chloride. The spatial arrangement is retained, but the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the substituents change, which requires a re-evaluation of the R/S assignment.\n5.  For each center, I will first assign the priorities to the substituents according to the CIP rules and then determine the configuration based on the 3D representation.\n\n```python\ndef assign_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and explains the stereochemical assignment for the four stereocenters\n    in the provided esterification reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Determining the stereochemical assignment for the four stereocenters from left to right.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Stereocenter 1: Acyl Chloride ---\n    print(\"--- 1.
