    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will follow the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules for each of the three chiral centers.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Chiral Centers:** First, we need to find the main carbon chain and identify all stereocenters. The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH), which should be on the carbon with the lowest possible number.\n2.  **Assign Priorities:** For each chiral center, we will assign priorities (1-4) to the four attached groups based on atomic number.\n3.  **Determine R/S Configuration:** We will orient the molecule so the lowest priority group (4) is pointing away from the viewer and determine the direction of the sequence from priority 1 to 2 to 3. If the direction is clockwise, the configuration is R; if counter-clockwise, it's S. If the lowest priority group points towards the viewer, the result is reversed.\n4.  **Combine Configurations:** Finally, we will combine the configurations for all chiral centers to give the full name.\n\nThe following Python code will print out the detailed step-by-step determination.\n\n```python\ndef solve_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and explains the absolute configuration of the molecule in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify and number the main carbon chain and chiral centers.\n    print(\"### Step 1: Identify the main carbon chain and chiral centers ###\")\n    print(\"The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH).
