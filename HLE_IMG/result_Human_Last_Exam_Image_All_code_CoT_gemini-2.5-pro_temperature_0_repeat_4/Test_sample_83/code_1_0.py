    # 2. Describe the Babler-Dauben oxidation transformation.
    # This reaction converts a tertiary allylic alcohol into an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone/aldehyde
    # through an oxidative allylic transposition ([3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement).
    # The general transformation is: R2C(OH)-Ca=Cb -> R2C=Ca-C(=O)b
    
    # 3. Apply the transformation to the specific molecule.
    # The alcohol is on C7.
    # The adjacent double bond is C1=C2.
    # Therefore, Ca = C1 and Cb = C2.
    
    # The new double bond forms between the original alcohol carbon (C7) and Ca (C1).
    # The new carbonyl group (C=O) forms at position Cb.
