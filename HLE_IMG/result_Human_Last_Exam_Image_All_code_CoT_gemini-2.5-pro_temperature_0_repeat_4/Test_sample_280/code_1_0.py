# The Piet program image displays two groups of colored bars.
# I will calculate the total number of bars.

# Number of bars in the first group
bars_group_one = 12
# Number of bars in the second group
bars_group_two = 12

# Calculate the sum
total_bars = bars_group_one + bars_group_two

# Print the equation showing the calculation
print(f"{bars_group_one} + {bars_group_two} = {total_bars}")
