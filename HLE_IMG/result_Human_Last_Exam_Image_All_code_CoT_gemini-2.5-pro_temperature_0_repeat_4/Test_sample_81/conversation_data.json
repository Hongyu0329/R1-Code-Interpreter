    "To rank the given lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive, we need to analyze the structural features that contribute to instability. The two main factors are ring strain (especially angle strain in small rings) and the planarity of the amide bond (amide resonance).\n\n1.  **Molecule A** is a β-lactam (a four-membered ring) fused to a six-membered ring. β-lactams are inherently reactive due to the significant angle strain in the four-membered ring, which forces bond angles far from their ideal values.\n\n2.  **Molecule B** is a bicyclic system composed of two fused five-membered rings ([3.3.0] system). The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. According to Bredt's rule, having a double bond (or in this case, a resonance-stabilized system that prefers planarity) at a bridgehead of a small bicyclic system introduces immense strain. The geometry forces the nitrogen atom to be pyramidal, preventing the nitrogen's lone pair from effectively delocalizing into the carbonyl group. This loss of amide resonance stabilization makes the lactam highly reactive.\n\n3.  **Molecule C** is a bridged bicyclic [2.2.2] system, which is very rigid. Like B, it has a bridgehead nitrogen. The rigidity of the [2.2.2] system forces an even greater deviation from planarity for the amide bond compared to the more flexible [3.3.0] system of B. This results in a more severe loss of amide resonance, making molecule C exceptionally strained and the most reactive of the three.\n\n**Ranking:**\n\n*   **Most reactive is C:** The rigid [2.2.2] system causes the most severe twisting of the amide bond, leading to the greatest loss of resonance stabilization.\n*   **Second most reactive is B:** The [3.3.0] system also has a non-planar bridgehead amide, but it is more flexible and thus less strained than C.\n*   **Least reactive is A:** While the β-lactam ring has high angle strain, this effect is less destabilizing than the severe loss of amide resonance found in the bridgehead systems of B and C.\n\nTherefore, the order from most to least reactive is C > B > A.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks the given lactams based on their strain and reactivity and prints the reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the molecules and their key features\n    molecules = {\n        'A': \"β-lactam (4-membered ring) fused to a 6-membered ring.

Extremely high reactivity from a severely non-planar amide bond.\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analysis of Lactam Reactivity:\")\n    print(\"Reactivity is determined by ring strain and amide resonance.\")\n    print(\"1.
