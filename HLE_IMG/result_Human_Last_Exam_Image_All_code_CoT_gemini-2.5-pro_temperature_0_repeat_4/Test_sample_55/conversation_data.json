    "Here is my step-by-step analysis of the chord:\n\n1.  **Identify the Key:** The piece is Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397. The key signature has one flat (B♭), and the piece is explicitly titled \"in D minor\". Therefore, the tonic is D.\n\n2.  **Identify the Notes:** The circled chord in measure 8 contains the following notes:\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** C♯ and A.\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** F and A.\n    *   The complete set of notes is **C♯, F, and A**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Chord's Root and Quality:**\n    *   To find the root, we stack these notes into thirds. The arrangement F - A - C♯ forms a triad.\n    *   The interval from F to A is a major third.\n    *   The interval from A to C♯ is also a major third.\n    *   A chord built with two stacked major thirds is an **augmented triad**. The root of this chord is **F**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   **Root:** The root of the chord is F. In the key of D minor, F is the third scale degree (the mediant). The Roman numeral for the third degree is **III**.\n    *   **Quality:** The chord is augmented, which is indicated by a plus sign (**+**).\n    *   **Inversion:** The lowest sounding note (the bass note) is C♯. Since C♯ is the 5th of the F augmented triad, the chord is in **second inversion**. This is indicated by the figured bass symbol **⁶₄**.\n\n5.  **Combine the Elements:** Putting it all together, the Roman numeral for the F augmented triad in second inversion is **III+⁶₄**.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_chord():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the circled chord in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor.\n    \"\"\"\n    key = \"D minor\"\n    notes_in_chord = [\"C#\", \"F\", \"A\"]\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify the key\n    print(f\"Step 1: The key of the piece is {key}.\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Identify the notes\n    print(f\"Step 2: The notes in the circled chord are {', '.join(notes_in_chord)}.\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Determine the chord root and quality\n    root = \"F\"\n    quality = \"Augmented\"\n    print(f\"Step 3: Stacking these notes in thirds (F - A - C#) reveals an {quality} triad with a root of {root}.\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Determine the Roman Numeral based on the key\n    scale_degree = \"III\"\n    quality_symbol = \"+\"\n    print(f\"Step 4: In the key of {key}, {root} is the 3rd scale degree (mediant), represented by the Roman numeral '{scale_degree}'.\")\n    print(f\"        The augmented quality is represented by a '{quality_symbol}'.\")\n\n    # Step 5: Determine the inversion\n    bass_note = \"C#\"\n    inversion_symbol = \"6/4\"\n    print(f\"Step 5: The bass note is {bass_note}, which is the 5th of the chord.
