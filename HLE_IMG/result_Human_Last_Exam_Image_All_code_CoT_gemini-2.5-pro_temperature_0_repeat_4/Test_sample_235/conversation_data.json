    "My plan is to determine the metric pattern of the erasure poem by first analyzing its structure and syllable count, and then comparing it against the definitions of the provided literary forms.\n\n1.  **Transcribe the Poem**: I will first write down the words of the poem as a single line: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\".\n2.  **Count Syllables**: I will write a Python function to count the syllables for each word and calculate the total for the entire line.\n3.  **Evaluate Options by Syllable Count**: I will compare the total syllable count to the requirements of each metric pattern given in the answer choices. This will help eliminate several options.\n    *   Iambic pentameter: 10 syllables\n    *   Alexandrine: 12 syllables\n    *   Loose iambic trimeter: ~6 syllables\n    *   American sentence: 17 syllables\n4.  **Detailed Metrical Analysis**: For the remaining plausible options (Free verse and Sapphic), I will perform a more detailed analysis. \"Free verse\" implies no regular meter, while \"Sapphic\" refers to a very specific structure.\n5.  **Scan the Line**: I will scan the poem for its metrical feet (patterns of stressed and unstressed syllables) to see if it matches the Sapphic form, which consists of an 11-syllable line with a pattern of trochees, a dactyl, and a final trochee or spondee.\n6.  **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, I will identify the correct metric pattern and print the reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef count_syllables(word):\n    \"\"\"A simple function to count syllables in an English word.\"\"\"\n    word = word.lower().strip(\".,'?!;\")\n    # Handle some exceptions and simple cases\n    if len(word) <= 3:\n        return 1\n    if word.endswith(\"e\"):\n        word = word[:-1]\n    \n    vowels = \"aeiouy\"\n    syllable_count = 0\n    # Count groups of consecutive vowels\n    vowel_groups = re.findall(f'[{vowels}]+', word)\n    syllable_count = len(vowel_groups)\n    \n    # Manual corrections for specific words in the poem\n    if word == \"intricate\":\n        return 3\n    if word == \"spider\":\n        return 2\n        \n    return syllable_count if syllable_count > 0 else 1\n\ndef analyze_poem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the metric pattern of the given erasure poem.\n    \"\"\"\n    poem_line = \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n    words = poem_line.split()\n    \n    print(f\"The poem is: \\\"{poem_line}\\\"\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Count total syllables\n    total_syllables = sum(count_syllables(word) for word in words)\n    print(f\"Step 1: Counting the syllables.\")\n    syllable_breakdown = \" + \".join([str(count_syllables(w)) for w in words])\n    word_breakdown = \" \".join([w.strip(',') for w in words])\n    print(f\"Syllables: {word_breakdown}\")\n    print(f\"Count:     {syllable_breakdown} = {total_syllables} syllables\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Evaluate options based on syllable count\n    print(\"Step 2: Evaluating the answer choices based on the syllable count (11).\")\n    print(\" - B.
