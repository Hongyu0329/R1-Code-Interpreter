    "This is a multi-component reaction involving an amine, a dialdehyde, and a cyanide source. This specific type of reaction is known for producing substituted isoindole derivatives.\n\nHere is the step-by-step mechanism:\n1.  **Iminium Ion Formation**: The primary amine group of 2-aminopyridine attacks one of the aldehyde groups of o-phthalaldehyde. After the loss of a water molecule, an iminium ion is formed.\n2.  **Cyanide Addition**: The cyanide ion (CN⁻), generated from TMSCN in the presence of KF and water, acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of the iminium ion. This step forms an α-aminonitrile intermediate.\n3.  **Intramolecular Cyclization**: The nitrogen atom of the newly formed α-aminonitrile attacks the second, unreacted aldehyde group on the benzene ring. This forms a five-membered ring fused to the benzene ring, creating a hydroxylated isoindoline intermediate.\n4.  **Dehydration**: The intermediate readily loses a molecule of water (dehydrates) to form a stable, aromatic isoindole ring system.\n\nThe final product, Compound A, is **2-(pyridin-2-yl)isoindole-1-carbonitrile**.\n\nThe following Python code uses the RDKit library to confirm the properties of this product and present the reaction details.\n\n```python\n# RDKit is a cheminformatics library.
