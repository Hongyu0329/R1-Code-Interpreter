    # This action of being thrown from a moving chariot is the central event in the myth of the death of Hippolytus.
    
    # In the myth, Hippolytus angers the goddess Aphrodite. In revenge, his father Theseus,
    # tricked by a false accusation, curses him. Poseidon, Theseus's father, sends a monster
    # from the sea to terrify Hippolytus's horses. The horses bolt, the chariot is wrecked,
    # and Hippolytus is dragged to his death.

    # is the most direct answer to the question "Who is the figure leaving the chariot?".
