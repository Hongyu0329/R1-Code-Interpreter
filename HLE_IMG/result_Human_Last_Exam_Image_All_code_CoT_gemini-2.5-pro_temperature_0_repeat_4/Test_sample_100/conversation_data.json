    "To determine the molecular formula of the product, we need to trace the transformations through the three-step reaction sequence.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-(4-methoxybenzyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. Let's determine its molecular formula.\n    *   The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene lactam core with a trifluoromethyl group (5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one) has the formula C7H6F3NO.\n    *   The para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group (-CH2-C6H4-OCH3) has the formula C8H9O.\n    *   Combining these, the starting material's formula is derived by adding the PMB group to the nitrogen, which replaces one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Formula = (C7H6F3NO - H) + C8H9O = C7H5F3NO + C8H9O = C15H14F3NO2.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Formation of Intermediate 1**\n    *   **Reaction:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n    *   **Transformation:** This reaction cleaves the PMB protecting group from the nitrogen atom. The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom is added back to the nitrogen.\n    *   **Change in formula:** - C8H9O + H = -C8H8O.\n    *   **Intermediate 1 Formula:** C(15-8)H(14-8)F3N(O(2-1)) = C7H6F3NO.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Formation of Intermediate 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Pd/C, H2 in MeOH.\n    *   **Transformation:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the bicyclic ring to a single bond (C-C). This adds two hydrogen atoms to the molecule.\n    *   **Change in formula:** + H2.\n    *   **Intermediate 2 Formula:** C7H(6+2)F3NO = C7H8F3NO.\n\n4.  **Step 3: Formation of the Final Product**\n    *   **Reaction:** 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n    *   **Transformation:** These are conditions for acidic hydrolysis. The lactam (cyclic amide) bond is cleaved by the addition of one molecule of water (H2O), opening the ring to form a carboxylic acid and an amine (which will be protonated to an ammonium salt under these acidic conditions).\n    *   **Change in formula:** + H2O.\n    *   **Product Formula:** C7H(8+2)F3N(O(1+1)) = C7H10F3NO2.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the final molecular formula based on this step-by-step analysis.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product through a three-step reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 0: Define the molecular formula of the starting material\n    # Structure: 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-(4-methoxybenzyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one\n    # Core (C7H6F3NO) + PMB (C8H9O) - H = C15H14F3NO2\n    formula = {'C': 15, 'H': 14, 'F': 3, 'N': 1, 'O': 2}\n    print(f\"Starting Material Formula: C{formula['C']}H{formula['H']}F{formula['F']}N{formula['N']}O{formula['O']}\")\n\n    # Step 1: Deprotection of PMB group with CAN\n    # Removes PMB (C8H9O) and adds H.
