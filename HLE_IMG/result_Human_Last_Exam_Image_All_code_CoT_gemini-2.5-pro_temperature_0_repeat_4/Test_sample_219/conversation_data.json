    "Here is my plan to solve the task:\n1.  **Identify Burst Timestamps:** I will visually inspect the provided raster plot to identify the time points where synchronized bursts of neuronal activity occur. A synchronized burst is characterized by a high density of firing events (black dots) occurring across a large number of electrodes (y-axis) within a narrow time window (x-axis). I will estimate the center time for each of these bursts.\n2.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** I will calculate the time difference between the timestamps of each consecutive pair of identified bursts.\n3.  **Calculate Average IBI:** I will compute the average of all the calculated inter-burst intervals.\n4.  **Format the Output:** I will round the final average to two significant figures as requested.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the entire process, including the identified timestamps, the individual intervals, and the final average, to ensure clarity and reproducibility.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_average_ibi():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies timestamps of synchronized bursts from a neuronal activity graph,\n    calculates the inter-burst intervals (IBIs), and computes their average.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts from the graph.\n    # These are the approximate center times (in seconds) of the dense vertical bands of activity.\n    burst_timestamps = [2.5, 17, 35, 48]\n    print(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs).\n    # The IBI is the time difference between consecutive bursts.\n    inter_burst_intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\n    \n    print(\"\\nCalculating Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):\")\n    for i in range(len(inter_burst_intervals)):\n        print(f\"Interval {i+1}: {burst_timestamps[i+1]} s - {burst_timestamps[i]} s = {inter_burst_intervals[i]} s\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the average IBI.\n    average_ibi = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\n    \n    # Step 4: Print the final calculation and the result rounded to two significant figures.\n    intervals_sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, inter_burst_intervals))\n    print(f\"\\nAverage Inter-Burst Interval = ({intervals_sum_str}) / {len(inter_burst_intervals)}\")\n    print(f\"Average Inter-Burst Interval = {np.sum(inter_burst_intervals)} / {len(inter_burst_intervals)} = {average_ibi:.4f} s\")\n    \n    # Rounding to two significant figures.\n    # Using format specifier 'g' for significant figures.\n    final_answer = f\"{average_ibi:.2g}\"\n    print(f\"\\nThe average inter-burst interval rounded to two significant figures is: {final_answer} s\")\n\ncalculate_average_ibi()\n```\n<<<15>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts in this graph of firing activity of a neuronal culture and calculate the average inter-burst interval to two significant figures.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
