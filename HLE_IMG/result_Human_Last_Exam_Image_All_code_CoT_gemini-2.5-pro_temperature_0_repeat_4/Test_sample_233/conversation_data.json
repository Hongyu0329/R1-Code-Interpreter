    "Based on a detailed analysis of the image provided, I will identify the runestone's ID.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze Visual Features:** The most striking characteristic of the runestone in the image is its unique design. The runes are not carved along a winding serpent, as is common, but are instead neatly organized into horizontal bands, creating a distinct grid-like pattern.\n2.  **Analyze Textual Features:** I will transliterate the visible runes from the Younger Futhark alphabet to identify key words.\n    *   Top row: `...ᚦᚢᚱᚴᚢᚦ...` transliterates to `...þurkuþ...`, the Old Norse woman's name *Þorgunnr*.\n    *   Middle row: `...ᛋᛏᛅᛁᚾ...` transliterates to `...stain...`, the word for \"stone\".\n    *   Bottom row: `...ᛦᚠᛏᛁᛦ...` transliterates to `...yftiʀ...`, a variant of `æftiʀ`, meaning \"in memory of\".\n3.  **Identify the Runestone:** The combination of the unique grid pattern and these specific text fragments points conclusively to the **Tystberga Runestone**.\n4.  **Determine the ID:** In the Rundata database of runic inscriptions, the Tystberga Runestone is cataloged with the ID **Sö 173**.\n5.  **Address the \"Ingvar\" Classification:** The prompt refers to this as an \"Ingvar runestone.\" This is a specific category for runestones commemorating those who died on Ingvar the Far-Travelled's expedition. However, the inscription on Sö 173 does not mention Ingvar or his journey. Therefore, the stone in the image is Sö 173, even though it is not technically an Ingvar runestone. The task is to identify the stone shown, so I will provide its correct ID.\n\nThe following Python code will formalize this identification process and print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_runestone_id():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the runestone from the image based on its unique visual and textual features.\n    The final ID consists of a location code and a number.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The identification is based on two key pieces of evidence from the image.\n    # 1. The unique visual style.\n    visual_style = \"Runes carved in horizontal bands, creating a grid-like pattern.\"\n    \n    # 2. The transliterated text fragments.\n    text_fragments = [\"...þurkuþ...\", \"...stain...\", \"...yftiʀ...\"]\n    \n    # These features uniquely identify the Tystberga Runestone.\n    # Its official ID in the Rundata catalog is composed of a code for the\n    # Södermanland province and a number.\n    \n    location_code = \"Sö\"\n    id_number = 173\n    \n    print(\"Identification Process:\")\n    print(f\"1. The stone's unique style is: {visual_style}\")\n    print(f\"2. Key text fragments are: {', '.join(text_fragments)}\")\n    print(\"3. These features identify the stone as the Tystberga Runestone.\")\n    print(\"\\nNote: While the prompt calls it an 'Ingvar runestone', its inscription does not fit this category. The ID belongs to the stone depicted.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final ID is composed of the following parts:\")\n    print(f\"Location Code: {location_code}\")\n    print(f\"Number: {id_number}\")\n    \n    final_id = f\"{location_code} {id_number}\"\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the ID of the runestone is: {final_id}\")\n\nidentify_runestone_id()\n```\n<<<Sö 173>>>"
