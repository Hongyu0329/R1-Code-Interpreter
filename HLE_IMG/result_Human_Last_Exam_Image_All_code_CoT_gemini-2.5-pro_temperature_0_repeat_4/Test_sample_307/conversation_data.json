    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The image contains nine heatmaps, each representing a Wigner 3-j symbol. The task is to find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm among these nine symbols. The infinity-norm of a matrix is its largest element in absolute value, which in this visualization corresponds to the most intense color (either red or green).\n2.  **Quantify Color Intensity:** The heatmaps use a diverging red-white-green colormap. White represents zero, while saturated reds and greens represent large positive and negative values, respectively. The magnitude of the value is proportional to the color's intensity or saturation (its distance from pure white). I will establish a numerical value for this magnitude. A reasonable method for a given RGB pixel is to measure its deviation from white `(255, 255, 255)`. For a red pixel `(R, G, B)` where `G` and `B` are roughly equal, the magnitude can be defined as `255 - G`. Similarly, for a green pixel, it would be `255 - R`.\n3.  **Extract Infinity-Norms:** I will visually inspect each of the nine panels to find the most intense color and use its RGB values to calculate the infinity-norm for that panel using the metric from the previous step.\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio:** After determining the nine infinity-norm values, I will identify the maximum and minimum values from this set.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** Finally, I will write a Python script to perform these calculations. The script will store the nine estimated norms, find the maximum and minimum, compute their ratio, and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the estimated infinity-norms for each of the 9 panels.\n# These values are derived by quantifying the most intense color in each panel.\n# The magnitude is estimated from the RGB value of the most saturated pixel.\n# For a red pixel (R,G,B), magnitude is ~ 255-G. For green, ~ 255-R.\n# For example, panel 3's brightest red is approx. RGB(204, 50, 50), so its norm is ~ 255-50 = 205.\n# Panel 6's brightest red is approx. RGB(221, 186, 186), so its norm is ~ 255-186 = 69.\n# Applying this to all panels gives the following list of norms.\n\ninfinity_norms = [\n    170,  # Panel 1\n    121,  # Panel 2\n    205,  # Panel 3\n    170,  # Panel 4\n    121,  # Panel 5\n    69,   # Panel 6\n    170,  # Panel 7\n    121,  # Panel 8\n    188   # Panel 9\n]\n\nprint(\"Estimated infinity-norms for panels 1-9:\")\nprint(infinity_norms)\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 2: Find the maximum and minimum of these norms.\nmax_norm = max(infinity_norms)\nmin_norm = min(infinity_norms)\n\nprint(f\"Maximum infinity-norm (from panel 3): {max_norm}\")\nprint(f\"Minimum infinity-norm (from panel 6): {min_norm}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the ratio.\nratio = max_norm / min_norm\n\n# Step 4: Print the final result and the equation.\nprint(\"The ratio is calculated as: Maximum Norm / Minimum Norm\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = {max_norm} / {min_norm} = {ratio}\")\n```\n<<<2.971014492753623>>>"
