    "This is a fascinating multi-step reaction involving a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and subsequent transformations. Let's break down the structure of each product step-by-step based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### Analysis and Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The starting material is 2-(1-pyrrolin-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid. It reacts with excess methyl propiolate in the presence of acetic anhydride (Ac₂O) and triethylamine (TEA) at 70°C. This is a classic setup for generating an azomethine ylide via decarboxylation, followed by a [3+2] cycloaddition with the methyl propiolate (a dipolarophile). The different products (A, B, C) likely arise from different reaction pathways or subsequent transformations of an initial product.\n\n2.  **Determine Structure C:** We'll start with Product C, as its formation seems the most straightforward. Its molecular formula (C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₃) suggests a simple reaction between the starting material (SM, C₉H₁₄N₂O₂) and one of the reagents. The change corresponds to the addition of a C₂H₂O unit, which points to acetylation by Ac₂O. We will verify this hypothesis using the NMR data.\n\n3.  **Determine Structure A:** The molecular formula of Product A (C₁₄H₂₀N₂O₃) suggests it's a product of the main cycloaddition pathway. It appears to be formed from the initial cycloadduct, which is then acetylated. We will deduce the structure of the initial cycloadduct from the mechanism (decarboxylation -> ylide formation -> cycloaddition) and then determine the structure of A by adding an acetyl group, confirming with its NMR data.\n\n4.  **Determine Structure B:** Product B (C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₃) has a high degree of unsaturation (DBE=7) and three carbonyl groups. Its formula suggests it's a rearranged and oxidized version of the initial cycloadduct. These complex \"cascade\" reactions are known for this type of chemistry. We will propose a plausible polycyclic structure that fits the unique features of its NMR spectrum (especially the three C=O signals and the constrained C=C bond).\n\n5.  **Final Output:** I will provide the structures of A, B, and C, represented by their IUPAC names or SMILES strings, in a Python script.\n\n### Proposed Structures\n\n*   **Product C** is the result of the N-acetylation of the starting material's secondary amine by acetic anhydride.\n*   **Product A** is the [3+2] cycloadduct formed after decarboxylation of the starting material, which is subsequently acetylated on the enamine tautomer of its pyrroline ring.\n*   **Product B** is a complex, tetracyclic cage-like product formed via an intramolecular cascade reaction and oxidation of the initial cycloadduct.\n\nThe following Python code will print the proposed structures for products A, B, and C.\n\n```python\ndef get_product_structures():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the proposed structures for products A, B, and C.\n    The structures are determined by analyzing the reaction mechanism and spectroscopic data.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Product A: C14H20N2O3\n    # A complex tricyclic product from the [3+2] cycloaddition followed by acetylation.\n    # SMILES representation is used due to the complex IUPAC name.\n    # Structure: The N-acetyl enamine derivative of the primary [3+2] cycloadduct.\n    product_A_smiles = \"CC(=O)N1C=C[C@@H]2[C@H]1[C@]3([C@H](C=C(C(=O)OC)C3)N2)CCCC3\"\n    \n    # Product B: C12H14N2O3\n    # A complex, rearranged, tetracyclic cage-like product.\n    # SMILES representation is used due to the complex IUPAC name.\n    # Structure: A tetracyclic structure containing an imide and a lactam moiety.\n    product_B_smiles = \"O=C1NC(=O)[C@@]23[C@H](C=C[C@H]4N2CCCC4)C1=O\"\n\n    # Product C: C11H16N2O3\n    # The N-acetylated starting material.\n    product_C_iupac_name = \"1-acetyl-2-(4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid\"\n    product_C_smiles = \"CC(=O)N1CCCC1(C(=O)O)C2=NCCC2\"\n\n    print(\"Proposed structure for Product A:\")\n    print(f\"  SMILES: {product_A_smiles}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Proposed structure for Product B:\")\n    print(f\"  SMILES: {product_B_smiles}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Proposed structure for Product C:\")\n    print(f\"  IUPAC Name: {product_C_iupac_name}\")\n    print(f\"  SMILES: {product_C_smiles}\\n\")\n\nget_product_structures()\n```"
