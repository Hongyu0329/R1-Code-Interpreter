    This function identifies the matching bird image.

    Analysis:
    1. The target image shows a Sociable Weaver from the back, with a distinctive scalloped feather pattern.
    2. Key features for identification are the specific arrangement and shape of these scallops on the back and wings, which act as a unique identifier.
    3. Comparing the target's pattern to all options (A-I), image G presents an exact match.
    4. The posture, lighting, and, most critically, the "fingerprint" of the feather pattern on the back and wings of the bird in image G are identical to the target bird.
