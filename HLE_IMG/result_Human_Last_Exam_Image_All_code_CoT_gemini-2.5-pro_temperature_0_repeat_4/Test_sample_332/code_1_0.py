    # Step 1: Analyze the Carl Sagan clue.
    # The quote describes Earth as a precious, vulnerable, and unique place of life
    # against the backdrop of space. We need an "X of Y" phrase that captures this.
    sagan_theme = "A precious, living world in the vastness of space."

    # Step 2: Identify the location from the image.
    # A reverse image search reveals the image is of the dwarf planet Ceres,
    # taken by the Dawn spacecraft.
    location = "Dwarf Planet Ceres"

    # Step 3: Find a crater on Ceres whose name's etymology matches the theme.
    # Craters on Ceres are named after agricultural deities.
    # The crater 'Geshtin' is named after the Sumerian goddess 'Geshtinanna'.
    crater_name = "Geshtin"
    deity_name = "Geshtinanna"

    # The etymology of 'Geshtinanna' is 'Vine of Heaven'.
    etymology = "Vine of Heaven"
    x = "Vine"
    y = "Heaven"

    # Step 4: Verify the connection.
    # The phrase "Vine of Heaven" is a powerful metaphor for a living world (Vine)
    # in the cosmos (Heaven), which aligns perfectly with Carl Sagan's message.
