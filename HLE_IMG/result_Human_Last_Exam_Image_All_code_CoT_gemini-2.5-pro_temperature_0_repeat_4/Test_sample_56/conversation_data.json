    "Based on the distinct surrealist style and the specific elements within the painting, I can identify the artist. The artwork features a room with impossible scenes viewed through openings: a sea with a ship flowing indoors, a vast glacier outside a window, and books burning in a fireplace. These are characteristic of a particular artist's work. I will provide a Python script to print the name of the artist.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the artist of the provided painting.\n    The painting is a famous surrealist piece from 1962 titled \"La vocaci√≥n\" (The Calling).\n    \"\"\"\n    artist_name = \"Remedios Varo\"\n    print(f\"The artist of the painting is: {artist_name}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Remedios Varo>>>"
