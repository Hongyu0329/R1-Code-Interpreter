# This problem is a multiple-choice question based on chemical and biological principles.
# No calculation or coding is required to determine the answer.
# The reasoning is based on the chemical properties of fluorescein and common strategies in chemical biology.

# 1. Identify the key functional groups on fluorescein: two phenolic -OH groups and one -COOH group.
# 2. Understand that caging fluorescein's fluorescence is most effectively done by modifying the phenolic -OH groups, which are part of the chromophore.
# 3. Understand that for enzymatic uncaging, the bond formed must be cleavable by an enzyme. Ester bonds are commonly cleaved by esterase enzymes.
# 4. The strategy requires cell-type specificity, which can be achieved by expressing a specific enzyme (not normally present in the cells) only in the target cell type.
# 5. Option B describes exactly this: modifying the -OH groups with acetyl groups (forming esters) to cage the molecule, and then using a genetically targeted enzyme (an esterase) to uncage it. This is a chemically and biologically sound strategy.
# 6. Other options are less feasible due to ineffective caging (modifying COOH), difficult chemistry (C-H activation), or the formation of overly stable bonds that are not easily uncaged (amides, ethers).

correct_answer = 'B'
explanation = "The most effective way to cage fluorescein is by modifying its phenolic hydroxyl (-OH) groups, as they are critical to its fluorescence. Converting them to esters (acetylation) effectively quenches the fluorescence. These ester bonds can then be specifically cleaved by an esterase enzyme. By genetically expressing a specific esterase only in the target cells, one can achieve cell-type-specific uncaging and release of the fluorescent molecule. This makes strategy B the most sound and widely used approach in principle."

# The final answer is the letter corresponding to the best choice.
