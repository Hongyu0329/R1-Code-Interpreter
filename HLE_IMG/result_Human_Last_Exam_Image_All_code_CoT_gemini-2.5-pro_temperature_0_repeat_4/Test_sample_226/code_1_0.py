    print("The image compares APT1 staining (brown) in brain tissue from control, PD, and PDD patients.")
    print("Observation: There is a visible increase in the intensity and density of APT1 staining in the PD and PDD panels compared to the control panel.")

    # Statement A
    print("Choice A: Claims APT1 cells decrease from control (679.6) to PD (302.1) and PDD (283.2).")
    print("Evaluation: This contradicts the visual evidence of increased staining. Therefore, A is unlikely to be true.\n")

    # Statement B
    print("Choice B: Claims no significant difference between groups.")
    print("Evaluation: This contradicts the clear visual difference between the control and the disease groups. Therefore, B is unlikely to be true.\n")

    # Statement C
    print("Choice C: Claims no APT1 stain was detected.")
    print("Evaluation: This is factually incorrect, as brown staining is clearly present in all panels. Therefore, C is false.\n")

    # Statement D
    print("Choice D: Claims PDD brains show a significantly increased number of APT1 immunopositive cells.")
    print("Evaluation: This aligns perfectly with the visual observation that staining is much more prominent in the PDD panel than in the control panel. Therefore, D is very likely to be true.\n")

    # Statement E
    print("Choice E: Makes a broad claim about impaired de-palmitoylation with age.")
    print("Evaluation: The experiment compares disease vs. control, not different ages. The conclusion is speculative and not directly supported by the visual data in the most straightforward way. Statement D is a more direct description of the findings. Therefore, E is less likely than D.\n")

    print("Conclusion")
    print("----------")
    print("Based on the analysis, statement D is the most accurate description of the visual data presented in the image.")
