# This script calculates the minimum number of steps based on the proposed synthetic plan.
# Each step in the plan is a distinct chemical transformation.

# Step 1: Oxidative coupling of the starting material.
step1 = 1
# Step 2: Benzylic bromination of the biphenyl core.
step2 = 1
# Step 3: Double alkylation with the enolate of 2-acetylnaphthalene.
step3 = 1
# Step 4: Final cyclization and aromatization to the target molecule.
step4 = 1

# Calculate the total number of steps
total_steps = step1 + step2 + step3 + step4

# The final equation shows the sum of the individual steps.
