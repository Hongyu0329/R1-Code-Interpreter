# This problem requires analyzing biological data and reasoning, not calculation.
# The final answer is a letter corresponding to the best statement.
# Based on the step-by-step analysis:
# 1. RNA-Seq data shows distinct tissue-specific expression for the left (CDS 2) and right (CDS 1a/1b) elements,
#    strongly suggesting they are two separate genes.
# 2. The D. melanogaster gene CG14879 typically has two CDSs.
# 3. The right element in D. willistoni is predicted to have a two-CDS structure, while the left element has one CDS.
# 4. By the principle of parsimony, the right element's structure is more similar to the ancestral gene,
#    making it the likely ortholog. The left element is therefore the paralog.
# 5. Statement P encapsulates all these points correctly.
