    # The stability and lifetime of these Ir(III) complexes in LECs are highly
    # dependent on the strength of the metal-ligand bonds. Steric hindrance
    # can significantly weaken these bonds, leading to faster degradation.

    # We analyze the substitution pattern on the cyclometalating phenylpyridine ligands.
    # The key positions for steric effects are the ortho-positions to the Ir-C bond (2' and 6').

    # Complex 1: 2',4'-difluoro. Has a 2'-F substituent.
    # Complex 2: 2',5'-difluoro. Has a 2'-F substituent.
    # Complex 3: 2',6'-difluoro. Has both 2'-F and 6'-F substituents.
    # Complex 4: 2',3',4'-trifluoro. Has a 2'-F substituent.

    # The 6'-position substituent in Complex 3 causes a severe steric clash.
    # This clash occurs within the same ligand, pointing towards the metal center
    # and the pyridine ring. This is known to be highly destabilizing.
