    print("   - This is a 'double check'. The king is checked by the knight on h6 and simultaneously by the queen on d5 (a discovered check).")

    print("   - The black king is 'smothered' â€“ it is in check and has no legal moves, completely trapped by its own pieces.")
    print("   - This is checkmate.")

    print("\nFinal Winning Sequence: 1. Nh6+ Kh8 2. Qg8+ Rxg8 3. Nf7#")
    print("\nBecause Nh6+ is the first move in this forced checkmating combination, it is the best move.")
