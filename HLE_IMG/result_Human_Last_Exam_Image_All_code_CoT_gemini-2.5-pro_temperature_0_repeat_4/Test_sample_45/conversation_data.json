    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find the highest number of times the pattern can be rotated within 360 degrees and still look identical to the original. This is also known as finding the highest \"n-fold\" rotational symmetry, where the pattern is invariant under a rotation of 360/n degrees.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will inspect the geometric shapes that make up the tiling. The pattern includes prominent dark blue regular hexagons.\n2.  A regular hexagon itself has 6-fold rotational symmetry. I will use the center of one of these hexagons as a test point for the rotational symmetry of the entire tiling.\n3.  I will check if rotating the whole pattern by 360/6 = 60 degrees around the center of a hexagon leaves the pattern unchanged.\n4.  If it does, this confirms that the tiling has at least 6-fold rotational symmetry. Since a hexagon is the polygon with the highest number of sides in this regular arrangement, it's highly likely that 6 is the highest order of symmetry.\n5.  The python code will print out this reasoning, including the calculation, and state the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_rotational_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the process of finding the rotational symmetry of the provided tiling.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To find the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we look for the highest order of rotation that leaves the pattern unchanged.\")\n    print(\"An n-fold rotational symmetry means the pattern looks the same after a rotation of 360/n degrees.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Identify a potential center of rotation.\")\n    print(\"The tiling contains prominent regular hexagons in dark blue.
