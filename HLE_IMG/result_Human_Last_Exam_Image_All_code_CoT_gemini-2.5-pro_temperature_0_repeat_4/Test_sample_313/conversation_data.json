    "My plan to solve this riddle is as follows:\n1.  First, I will analyze the two clues provided in the text to determine the identity of \"X Y\".\n2.  The second clue, \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts,\" is very specific. It points to the historical process of making felt hats, where mercury(II) nitrate was used to treat fur. This process was known as carroting and led to mercury poisoning in hat makers (\"mad as a hatter\"). Therefore, \"X Y\" is very likely \"Felt hat\".\n3.  Next, I will check if this fits the first clue: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\" On this specific date, the famous Royal Ascot horse race was taking place in the UK. This event is renowned for its attendees wearing extravagant and formal hats. It is entirely plausible that a \"Felt hat\" was pictured at this event. The image of the football player is a red herring intended to mislead.\n4.  The prompt requires a Python code solution that outputs a final equation. Since no numbers are provided for a calculation, I will derive them from the letters in the answer, \"Felt hat\".\n5.  I will assign a number to each letter based on its position in the alphabet (A=1, B=2, C=3, etc.).\n    *   For \"Felt\": F(6) + E(5) + L(12) + T(20) = 43.\n    *   For \"hat\": H(8) + A(1) + T(20) = 29.\n6.  The final equation will be the sum of these two numbers: 43 + 29 = 72.\n7.  The Python code will then print this equation, showing each number as requested.\n\n```python\ndef generate_equation():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function generates and prints an equation based on the answer to the riddle.\n  The answer is \"Felt hat\". The numbers are derived from the alphabetical\n  position of the letters in the words.\n  \"\"\"\n  # Values are pre-calculated based on the plan:\n  # Felt: F(6) + E(5) + L(12) + T(20) = 43\n  # hat: H(8) + A(1) + T(20) = 29\n  num1 = 43\n  num2 = 29\n  result = num1 + num2\n\n  # Print the final equation, showing each number.\n  print(f\"{num1} + {num2} = {result}\")\n\ngenerate_equation()\n```\n<<<Felt hat>>>"
