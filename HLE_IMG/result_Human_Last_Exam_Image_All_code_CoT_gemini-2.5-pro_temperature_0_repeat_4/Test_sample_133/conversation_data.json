    "This is a classic analytical chemistry problem that can be solved by interpreting the provided mass spectrum. I will walk you through the steps to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Determine the Molecular Weight:** I will identify the molecular ion peak (M⁺), which is the peak with the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) corresponding to the intact molecule.\n2.  **Analyze the Isotope Pattern:** The relative intensities of the peaks around the molecular ion (M⁺, M+2, M+4, etc.) reveal the presence and number of certain elements, particularly halogens like chlorine and bromine.\n3.  **Deduce the Molecular Formula:** Based on the molecular weight and elemental composition, I will propose a plausible molecular formula for the compound.\n4.  **Analyze the Fragmentation Pattern:** I will examine the major fragment peaks in the spectrum. The mass differences between the molecular ion and these fragments correspond to the loss of neutral pieces from the molecule, which provides clues about its structure.\n5.  **Identify the Compound and Name it:** By combining all the evidence, I will identify the structure of the unknown compound and provide its systematic IUPAC name.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef solve_mass_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided mass spectrum data to identify the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data from the table in the image\n    spectrum_data = {\n        262: 29.0, 264: 12.9, 266: 3.22,\n        225: 100.0, 227: 66.7,\n        192: 24.5, 190: 48.4\n    }\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Determine the Molecular Weight ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the Molecular Ion Peak (M+)\")\n    # The highest m/z cluster is at 262, 264, 266.\n    molecular_ion_mass = 262\n    print(f\"The peak at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) is at {molecular_ion_mass}.\")\n    print(f\"This suggests the molecular weight of the compound (containing the most common isotopes) is {molecular_ion_mass} u.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Analyze the Isotope Pattern ---\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the Isotope Pattern\")\n    m_peak_intensity = spectrum_data[262]\n    m_plus_2_intensity = spectrum_data[264]\n    m_plus_4_intensity = spectrum_data[266]\n    \n    # Normalize intensities relative to the M+ peak at 262\n    relative_m_plus_2 = (m_plus_2_intensity / m_peak_intensity) * 100\n    relative_m_plus_4 = (m_plus_4_intensity / m_peak_intensity) * 100\n    \n    # Theoretical ratio for 2 Chlorine atoms (35Cl:37Cl is approx 3:1) is M:M+2:M+4 ≈ 9:6:1 or 100:65:10\n    print(f\"The molecular ion cluster shows peaks at m/z {molecular_ion_mass}, {molecular_ion_mass+2}, and {molecular_ion_mass+4}.\")\n    print(f\"Their intensity ratio is approximately 100 : {relative_m_plus_2:.0f} : {relative_m_plus_4:.0f}.\")\n    print(\"This pattern is characteristic of a compound containing two chlorine atoms.\\n\")\n    num_cl = 2\n    mass_cl = 35 # Using the mass of the most common isotope, 35Cl\n\n    # --- Step 3: Deduce the Molecular Formula ---\n    print(\"Step 3: Deducing the Molecular Formula\")\n    mass_of_cl_atoms = num_cl * mass_cl\n    mass_of_rest = molecular_ion_mass - mass_of_cl_atoms\n    print(f\"The mass of the two chlorine atoms is 2 * {mass_cl} = {mass_of_cl_atoms} u.\")\n    print(f\"The mass of the rest of the molecule (C_x H_y) is {molecular_ion_mass} - {mass_of_cl_atoms} = {mass_of_rest} u.\")\n    \n    # Determine the formula for the C_x H_y part\n    num_c = 15\n    num_h = 12\n    mass_c = 12\n    mass_h = 1\n    calculated_mass = num_c * mass_c + num_h * mass_h\n    print(f\"A plausible formula for a mass of {mass_of_rest} is C{num_c}H{num_h} (15 * 12 + 12 * 1 = {calculated_mass}).\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the proposed molecular formula is C{num_c}H{num_h}Cl{num_cl}.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 4: Analyze the Fragmentation Pattern ---\n    print(\"Step 4: Analyzing the Fragmentation Pattern\")\n    base_peak_mass = 225\n    fragment_227_mass = 227\n    fragment_192_mass = 192\n    fragment_190_mass = 190\n\n    print(f\"The base peak (most intense fragment) is at m/z = {base_peak_mass}.\")\n    \n    # Loss of Cl\n    loss_cl = molecular_ion_mass - fragment_227_mass\n    print(f\"A major fragment at m/z {fragment_227_mass} corresponds to the loss of a fragment of mass {loss_cl} ({molecular_ion_mass} - {fragment_227_mass}).
