    Solves the cellular automata mapping problem based on visual analysis.

    The function determines the correspondence between the short-term (t_max=10, labeled 1-15)
    and long-term (t_max=40, labeled A-O) visualizations of 15 different cellular automata rules.

    The mapping is determined by matching key visual features such as:
    - Shape (diamond, cross)
    - Structure (solid, hollow, fractal, dotted)
    - Growth behavior (merging vs. non-merging, growth speed)
    - Texture (woven, blocky, chaotic)

    The resulting mapping is:
    1 -> K, 2 -> C, 3 -> L, 4 -> M, 5 -> G, 6 -> H, 7 -> I, 8 -> N,
    9 -> D, 10 -> F, 11 -> J, 12 -> B, 13 -> E, 14 -> A, 15 -> O
