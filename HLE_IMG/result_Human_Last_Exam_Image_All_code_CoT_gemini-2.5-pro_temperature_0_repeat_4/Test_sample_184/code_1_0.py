    This function identifies the products of the described reaction sequence.
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. A thermal conrotatory ring-opening of the cyclobutene yields two diastereomeric dienes (E and Z isomers).
    2. Each diene undergoes an endo Diels-Alder reaction with ethyl acrylate.
    3. The Z-diene has Me 'out' and OMe 'in' in the s-cis conformer. The endo product has Me trans to CO2Et and OMe cis to CO2Et. This corresponds to structures A and D.
    4. The E-diene has Me 'in' and OMe 'out'. The endo product has Me cis to CO2Et and OMe trans to CO2Et. This corresponds to structures B and C.
    5. The two diastereomeric dienes yield two diastereomeric products. A consistent stereochemical analysis points to the pair C and D.
