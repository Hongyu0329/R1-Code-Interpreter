    "The plant in the image is most likely *Debregeasia longifolia*. While it has a wide native range, it is not endemic to a single island.\n\nThis plant, also known as the Orange Wild Rhea, is native to a broad area stretching from China to Tropical Asia and Vanuatu. Its native habitat includes countries such as India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Indo-China, West China, and Malesia. It is found in the Himalayas and various parts of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, Borneo, Jawa, and Sumatra. Therefore, it is not endemic to one specific island.\n\nAnother plant with similar leaf patterning is the Nerve Plant (*Fittonia albivenis*), which is native to the tropical rainforests of South America, including countries like Colombia, Peru, and Brazil, but it is typically a much smaller houseplant.\n\nA specific species within the same genus, *Debregeasia hekouensis*, is considered an endemic species, but it is native to a very narrow area in Hekou County, Yunnan Province, China, not an island.\n\n<<<The plant pictured, likely *Debregeasia longifolia*, is not endemic to a single island but is native to a wide region from China to Tropical Asia, including many islands.>>>"
