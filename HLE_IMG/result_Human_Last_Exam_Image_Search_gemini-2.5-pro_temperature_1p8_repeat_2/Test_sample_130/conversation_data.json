    "The spectral lines in the image belong to the element **Neon (Ne)**.\n\nThe provided image displays a characteristic emission spectrum with a high density of bright lines in the red, orange, and yellow regions. It also shows several distinct lines in the green and some fainter lines in the blue and violet parts of the spectrum. This specific pattern is a unique \"fingerprint\" for the element neon.\n\nWhen a high voltage is applied to neon gas in a discharge tube, it emits a bright reddish-orange glow. When this light is passed through a prism or a diffraction grating, it separates into its constituent colors, revealing the unique set of spectral lines seen in the image. Both neutral and singly ionized neon atoms contribute to the multitude of emission lines observed.\n\nA comparison of the user-provided image with established reference spectra for neon confirms the match based on the distribution and relative intensity of the spectral lines across the visible spectrum.\n\n<<<Neon>>>"
