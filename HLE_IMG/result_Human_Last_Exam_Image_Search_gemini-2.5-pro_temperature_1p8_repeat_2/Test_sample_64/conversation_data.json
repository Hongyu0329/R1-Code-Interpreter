    "The image displays a time-lapse sequence (panels L, M, and N) of a type of cellular growth in the filamentous fungus *Neurospora crassa*. This process is known as intercalary growth, where a new hyphal compartment is formed from within the filament, rather than at the growing tip.\n\nThe key stages shown are:\n*   **Panel L:** An existing septum (the cross-wall between fungal cells) is indicated by the arrowhead.\n*   **Panel M:** A bulge begins to form at the site of the septum, initiating a new growth point that is directed backward along the hypha.\n*   **Panel N:** The bulge enlarges, and a new septum forms at its base (indicated by the arrowhead), effectively creating a new intercalary cell and causing the filament to bend. This method of growth allows the fungus to increase cell number and branch within an established hyphal filament.\n\nThis process is a specific form of hyphal development and branching. Fungi typically grow by extending the tip of their hyphae. However, some can also grow through intercalary extension, which involves the expansion of compartments below the apex. In the case shown, it is a specific budding mechanism that leads to the formation of a new compartment.\n\n<<<The process depicted is the formation of a new intercalary compartment in the hypha of the fungus *Neurospora crassa* through a process of \"backward budding\" and subsequent septation.>>>"
