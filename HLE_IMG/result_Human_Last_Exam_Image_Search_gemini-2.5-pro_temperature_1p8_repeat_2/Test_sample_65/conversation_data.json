    "The bryophyte in the image belongs to the genus *Ptychomnion*.\n\nThe leaves of this moss are characteristically squarrose (bent at a right angle) and rugose (wrinkled), which gives them a pleated or folded appearance, a key feature of the *Ptychomnion* genus. When dry, this moss often resembles a pipe-cleaner, a common name for *Ptychomnion aciculare*.\n\nThis genus is commonly found in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, growing on the ground in wet forests, on fallen logs, and sometimes as an epiphyte. It can form extensive, dense mats and its color can range from bright green when wet to a more yellow-brown when dry.\n\nInitially, there might be a resemblance to some species of *Hypnum* moss, often called carpet moss or feather moss, which can also have curved leaves. However, the distinctively pleated and squarrose nature of the leaves in the photograph is more indicative of *Ptychomnion*.\n\n<<<Ptychomnion>>>"
