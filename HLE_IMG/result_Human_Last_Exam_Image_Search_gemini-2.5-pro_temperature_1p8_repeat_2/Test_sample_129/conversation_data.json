    "This image displays the crystal structure of a protein complex between **Intimin** and its receptor **Tir**.\n\nSpecifically, this is the C-terminal fragment of Intimin from *Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli* (EPEC), shown in dark blue, bound to the intimin-binding domain of the Translocated Intimin Receptor (Tir), shown in light blue. This particular structure is available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under the accession code 1F02.\n\nIntimin is an outer membrane protein used by pathogenic *E. coli* to adhere to host cells. The bacterium injects the Tir protein into the host cell, where it acts as a receptor on the host cell's surface for the bacterium's Intimin protein to bind to. This crucial interaction is what allows the bacteria to attach firmly to the intestinal lining. The structure of this complex, including the specific domains responsible for binding, has been determined by X-ray crystallography.\n\n<<<Intimin-Tir complex>>>"
