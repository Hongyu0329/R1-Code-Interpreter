    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find a point on the tiling around which we can rotate it by some angle (less than 360 degrees) and have the tiling look identical to its original state. The \"order\" of rotational symmetry is the number of such rotations that can be performed in a full 360-degree turn.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will visually inspect the provided image of the tiling to locate a center of rotation.\n2.  The most prominent repeating motifs are the star-like patterns centered on the dark blue hexagons. I will choose the center of one of these blue hexagons as a potential center of rotation for the entire pattern.\n3.  I will count how many times the surrounding pattern of yellow squares and orange rhombuses repeats itself around this central point.\n4.  The number of repetitions will give us the order of rotational symmetry. The smallest angle of rotation that leaves the pattern unchanged will be 360 degrees divided by this number.\n5.  I will write a Python script to formalize this observation and calculate the order of symmetry. The script will print the steps of the reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the rotational symmetry of the tiling shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A full circle rotation is 360 degrees.\n    full_rotation_degrees = 360\n\n    # By observing the pattern, we can identify centers of rotation.\n    # Let's focus on the center of one of the dark blue hexagonal shapes.\n    # The pattern of surrounding yellow squares and orange rhombuses is repeated\n    # multiple times around this center.\n    # Counting these repetitions reveals how many times the pattern can be rotated\n    # to match itself in a full 360-degree turn.\n    # Upon inspection, we can see 6 identical arrangements around the center.\n    number_of_repetitions = 6\n\n    # The order of rotational symmetry is equal to this number of repetitions.\n    order_of_symmetry = number_of_repetitions\n\n    # The minimum angle of rotation that leaves the tiling unchanged can be calculated\n    # by dividing the full circle by the order of symmetry.\n    minimum_rotation_angle = full_rotation_degrees / order_of_symmetry\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the rotational symmetry of the tiling:\")\n    print(f\"1.
