    # Step 2: Identify the key visual and textual elements.
    # - A hybrid figure (human body, animal head), evoking creatures from mythology or dreams.
    # - Irrational juxtaposition of a natural landscape, a modern postcard, and anatomical drawings.
    # - Explicit text references to "Persephone" (mythology) and psychological concepts ("the human cry," "superstitious").

    # Step 3: Connect these elements to an early 20th-century theory.
    # The Surrealist movement's focus on dreams, the unconscious, psycho-sexual symbolism,
    # and myth was directly and explicitly inspired by the foundational work of a specific psychoanalyst.
    # Andr√© Breton's "Surrealist Manifesto" (1924) is heavily indebted to this thinker's ideas.

    # providing the intellectual bedrock for Surrealism, is Sigmund Freud.
