    # --- Step 1: Analyze the first stereocenter (in the acyl chloride) ---
    # The chiral carbon is attached to: -C(=O)Cl, -C6H5 (phenyl), -CF3, and -OCH3.
    # Priority assignment based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules (atomic number):
    # 1. -OCH3 (Oxygen > Carbon)
    # 2. -C(=O)Cl (Carbon bonded to Cl,O,O > C bonded to F,F,F)
    # 3. -CF3 (Carbon bonded to F,F,F > C bonded to C,C,C)
    # 4. -C6H5 (Phenyl)
    #
    # The 3D orientation shows the lowest priority group (-C6H5, #4) in the plane,
    # and the highest priority group (-OCH3, #1) pointing back.
    # To determine the configuration, we can use the swap rule: swap the lowest
    # priority group with the group in the back.
    # Swap #4 (phenyl) with #1 (methoxy). Now, phenyl is in the back.
    # We trace the remaining priorities in their new positions: 1 -> 2 -> 3.
    # The path is from methoxy (now in plane) -> -C(=O)Cl (in plane, up) -> -CF3 (front).
    # This traces a counter-clockwise (CCW) circle.
    # Because we performed one swap, the actual configuration is the opposite.
    # CCW -> S. Opposite is R.

    # The chiral carbon is attached to: -OH, -H, -CH2OCH3, and -CH2CH(CH3)2.

    # 1. -OH (Oxygen > Carbon)
    # 2. -CH2OCH3 (C bonded to O > C bonded to C)
    # 3. -CH2CH(CH3)2
    # 4. -H
    #
    # The 3D orientation shows the -OH group (#1) on a wedge (front).
    # This implies the implicit -H group (#4) is on a dash (back).
    # With the lowest priority group in the back, we trace the path 1 -> 2 -> 3.
    # The path is from -OH (front) -> -CH2OCH3 (up) -> -CH2CH(CH3)2 (left).
    # This traces a counter-clockwise (CCW) circle.
    # With lowest priority back, CCW means the configuration is S.
