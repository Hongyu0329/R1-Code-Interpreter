    "To determine the stereochemical assignments (R/S) for the four stereocenters in the reaction, we need to analyze each chiral center individually. The overall reaction is an esterification between an acyl chloride and an alcohol. This type of reaction, a nucleophilic acyl substitution, proceeds with retention of configuration at any existing stereocenters in both the acyl and alcohol components. Therefore, we only need to determine the configuration of the two stereocenters in the reactants, as they will be identical in the product.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify Stereocenter 1:** Locate the chiral carbon in the first reactant (the acyl chloride).\n2.  **Assign Priorities for Stereocenter 1:** Use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules to assign priorities (1-4) to the four groups attached to this stereocenter.\n3.  **Determine Configuration for Stereocenter 1:** Based on the 3D arrangement of the groups and their priorities, determine if the configuration is (R) or (S).\n4.  **Identify Stereocenter 2:** Locate the chiral carbon in the second reactant (the alcohol).\n5.  **Assign Priorities for Stereocenter 2:** Apply CIP rules to assign priorities to the four groups attached to this stereocenter.\n6.  **Determine Configuration for Stereocenter 2:** Determine the (R) or (S) configuration for the alcohol's stereocenter.\n7.  **Determine Product Configurations:** Since the reaction mechanism retains the stereochemistry, the configurations of the two stereocenters in the product will be the same as in the reactants. Stereocenter 3 will match Stereocenter 1, and Stereocenter 4 will match Stereocenter 2.\n8.  **Final Sequence:** Assemble the configurations in order from left to right as they appear in the reaction scheme.\n\nI will now write a Python script that codifies this logic and prints the resulting sequence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the stereochemical assignments for the reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Analyze the first stereocenter (in the acyl chloride) ---\n    # The chiral carbon is attached to: -C(=O)Cl, -C6H5 (phenyl), -CF3, and -OCH3.\n    # Priority assignment based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules (atomic number):\n    # 1. -OCH3 (Oxygen > Carbon)\n    # 2. -C(=O)Cl (Carbon bonded to Cl,O,O > C bonded to F,F,F)\n    # 3. -CF3 (Carbon bonded to F,F,F > C bonded to C,C,C)\n    # 4. -C6H5 (Phenyl)\n    #\n    # The 3D orientation shows the lowest priority group (-C6H5, #4) in the plane,\n    # and the highest priority group (-OCH3, #1) pointing back.\n    # To determine the configuration, we can use the swap rule: swap the lowest\n    # priority group with the group in the back.\n    # Swap #4 (phenyl) with #1 (methoxy).
