    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each artwork:\n\n1.  **Artwork 1 (Top Left):** This painting depicts women from an ethnic minority group. The style, with its dynamic ink lines and realistic portrayal of figures and animals, is characteristic of **Huang Zhou (黄胄)**, a master of modern Chinese figure painting.\n2.  **Artwork 2 (Top Middle):** This is an abstract ink wash landscape. The style, which transforms natural scenery into semi-abstract forms with rhythmic lines and dots, is a hallmark of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**, particularly his later works.\n3.  **Artwork 3 (Top Right):** This is a piece of calligraphy in a powerful and uninhibited cursive script. This distinctive and famous calligraphic style belongs to **Mao Zedong (毛泽东)**.\n4.  **Artwork 4 (Middle Left):** This is another example of cursive script calligraphy, known as \"caoshu\". The fluid, elegant, and seemingly effortless brushwork is the signature style of the modern calligraphy master **Lin Sanzhi (林散之)**.\n5.  **Artwork 5 (Middle Center):** This is a highly realistic oil painting of a young woman. This specific work is a famous piece titled \"Youth II: The New Generation\" by **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**, a leading figure in Chinese Neo-Realism.\n6.  **Artwork 6 (Middle Right):** This painting of a woman in a stylized form, combining elements of Chinese ink painting and Western modernism (like Fauvism), is representative of the unique style of **Lin Fengmian (林風眠)**.\n7.  **Artwork 7 (Bottom Left):** This colorful painting, titled \"Loofah and Rooster,\" uses bold colors and a blend of oil painting's richness with ink painting's spirit. It is a well-known work by **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)** from 1972.\n8.  **Artwork 8 (Bottom Middle):** This majestic landscape painting, likely depicting the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River, with its use of layered ink to create depth and light, is a classic example of the work of **Li Keran (李可染)**.\n9.  **Artwork 9 (Bottom Right):** The subject of a shrimp (or lobster) rendered with minimal yet masterful brushstrokes is the most iconic subject of **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**. His ability to capture the essence and vitality of shrimp is legendary.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the authors of the 9 artworks and prints them in order.\n    \"\"\"\n    authors = [\n        \"Huang Zhou\",\n        \"Wu Guanzhong\",\n        \"Mao Zedong\",\n        \"Lin Sanzhi\",\n        \"Jin Shangyi\",\n        \"Lin Fengmian\",\n        \"Wu Guanzhong\",\n        \"Li Keran\",\n        \"Qi Baishi\"\n    ]\n    \n    # Print the list of authors from left to right, top to bottom.\n    result = \", \".join(authors)\n    print(result)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Huang Zhou, Wu Guanzhong, Mao Zedong, Lin Sanzhi, Jin Shangyi, Lin Fengmian, Wu Guanzhong, Li Keran, Qi Baishi>>>"
