    "Based on the analysis of the seal script characters and their traditional reading order, the four characters on the seal are identified. The reading order for a four-character seal is typically top-right, bottom-right, top-left, then bottom-left.\n\n1.  **Top-Right Character**: This is clearly **景 (jǐng)**, meaning \"scenery\" or \"view\".\n2.  **Bottom-Right Character**: This character is **園 (yuán)**, simplified to **园**, meaning \"garden\". The character is composed of the enclosure radical 囗 with the character 袁 inside.\n3.  **Top-Left Character**: This character's form is similar to both 不 (bù, no/not) and 丕 (pī, great/grand). Given the context of the other characters, 丕 (pī) is the semantically correct choice, as \"not virtue\" (不德) would be a very strange phrase for a seal, while \"grand virtue\" (丕德) is common.\n4.  **Bottom-Left Character**: This is clearly **德 (dé)**, meaning \"virtue\" or \"morality\". The seal script form shows the 彳 radical on the left, with the components for 直 and 心 on the right.\n\nCombining these characters, the phrase is **景园丕德 (Jǐng Yuán Pī Dé)**, which translates to \"Scenery Garden, Grand Virtue\". This is a common type of inscription for a studio seal (齋號), referring to a place named \"Scenery Garden\" and an associated motto \"Grand Virtue\".\n\nThe following Python code will print the identified characters in simplified Chinese.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the simplified Chinese characters from the seal.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The characters are read in the order: top-right, bottom-right, top-left, bottom-left.\n    characters_traditional = \"景園丕德\"\n    characters_simplified = \"景园丕德\"\n    pinyin_pronunciation = \"Jǐng Yuán Pī Dé\"\n    meaning = \"Scenery Garden, Grand Virtue\"\n\n    print(f\"The characters on the seal are identified as: {characters_traditional} (Traditional)\")\n    print(f\"In simplified Chinese, the characters are: {characters_simplified}\")\n    print(f\"The Pinyin pronunciation is: {pinyin_pronunciation}\")\n    print(f\"A possible translation of the phrase is: '{meaning}'\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<景园丕德>>>"
