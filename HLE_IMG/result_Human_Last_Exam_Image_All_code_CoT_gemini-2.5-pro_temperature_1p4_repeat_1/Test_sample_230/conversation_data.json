    "My plan is to identify the painting by analyzing its key visual elements. The image displays a windmill under a dark, stormy sky, with a fire visible in the background. The style is reminiscent of 19th-century Romanticism. Based on these characteristics, particularly the Dutch-style windmill and the dramatic, narrative scene, I will perform a targeted search for paintings from that era with similar subjects. This process will help me pinpoint the specific artwork and its title. I will then use a Python script to formally present the discovered title.\n\n```python\ndef find_painting_title():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the title of the identified painting.\n    The identification is based on visual analysis of the painting's style and subject matter:\n    - Style: 19th-century Dutch Romanticism\n    - Subject: A windmill under a stormy sky with a building on fire in the background.\n    - Conclusion: The painting is \"The Burning of the 'De Riek' Windmill near Sloten\" by Andreas Schelfhout.\n    \"\"\"\n    painting_title = \"The Burning of the 'De Riek' Windmill near Sloten\"\n    print(painting_title)\n\nfind_painting_title()\n```\n<<<The Burning of the 'De Riek' Windmill near Sloten>>>"
