    "Based on my analysis of the recurring annual peaks in the Google Trends data, I have deduced the country in question. The plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph:** I will identify the timing of the annual search interest spikes for each of the three colored lines (red, blue, and yellow).\n2.  **Correlate with Events:** I will correlate these specific timeframes with major national holidays or historical commemorations.\n3.  **Identify the Country:** I will find the one country for which all three event timings are highly significant.\n    *   The **red line** peaks in late January/early February, which corresponds to major World War II anniversaries in Russia, such as the end of the Battle of Stalingrad.\n    *   The **blue line** peaks in early May, aligning perfectly with Russia's Victory Day on May 9th.\n    *   The **yellow line** peaks in mid-June, which matches Russia Day on June 12th.\n4.  **Final Output:** I will use a Python script to print this logical deduction and state the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_country():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the recurring patterns in the Google Trends graph to identify the country.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Mapping the line colors to their observed peak times and corresponding historical events.\n    event_analysis = {\n        'Red Line': {\n            'peak_time': 'Late January / Early February',\n            'corresponding_event': 'Commemoration of major WWII events, like the anniversary of the end of the Battle of Stalingrad (Feb 2nd).'\n        },\n        'Blue Line': {\n            'peak_time': 'Early May',\n            'corresponding_event': 'Victory Day (May 9th), a major national holiday celebrating the victory over Nazi Germany.'\n        },\n        'Yellow Line': {\n            'peak_time': 'Mid-June',\n            'corresponding_event': 'Russia Day (June 12th), the national day of the country.'\n        }\n    }\n\n    # The country where all these events are significant national observances.\n    country = \"Russia\"\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the Google Trends data:\")\n    for color, data in event_analysis.items():\n        print(f\"\\n- The {color}:\")\n        print(f\"  - Shows an annual search spike around: {data['peak_time']}.\")\n        print(f\"  - This timing corresponds to the following event in {country}: {data['corresponding_event']}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(\"Since all three distinct annual search patterns align perfectly with major Russian holidays and historical commemorations, the country is determined to be:\")\n    print(f\"--> {country}\")\n\nidentify_country()\n```\n<<<Russia>>>"
