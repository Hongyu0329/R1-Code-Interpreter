    "This is a famous piece for piano known for its technical difficulty. I can identify it by analyzing its key features.\n\n**My Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the Sheet Music:** I will examine the key signature, time signature, tempo, dynamics, and distinctive melodic and harmonic patterns in the provided musical excerpt.\n2.  **Identify Key Characteristics:** The most prominent features are the initial quiet, scalar passage in A minor, followed by a sudden, loud explosion of rapid, ascending arpeggios. The virtuosity required is a major clue.\n3.  **Deduce the Composer and Piece:** The style strongly points towards a 19th-century Romantic composer known for virtuosic piano works, such as Liszt or Chopin. By comparing the specific patterns to their famous etudes, I can pinpoint the exact piece.\n4.  **Format the Output:** I will write a Python script that prints the name of the piece and the composer, along with a brief explanation of the identification process.\n\n```python\ndef identify_music_piece():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the musical piece from the provided sheet music\n    and prints the result along with the analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n    composer = \"Franz Liszt\"\n    piece_title = \"Transcendental Étude No. 2 in A minor\"\n    catalog_number = \"S.139\"\n    \n    print(f\"The sheet music is from the piece: {piece_title}, {catalog_number}, composed by {composer}.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"1. Key and Opening: The piece begins in A minor, established by the left-hand's A note and the right-hand's descending A-harmonic minor scale.\")\n    print(\"2. Dynamics and Tempo: It starts quietly ('p') at a tempo of ♩= 80, but abruptly shifts to loud ('f') at the third measure.\")\n    print(\"3. Virtuosity: The passage starting at measure 3, with rapid, ascending arpeggios and broken octaves, is extremely demanding and a hallmark of Franz Liszt's style.\")\n    print(\"4. Conclusion: These features uniquely identify the piece as Liszt's second Transcendental Étude.\")\n\nidentify_music_piece()\n```\n<<<Franz Liszt - Transcendental Étude No. 2 in A minor>>>"
