    print("The text defines NGSC (Normalized Global Spatial Complexity) as the 'normalized entropy of normalized eigenvalues' from principal components.")
    print("In information theory, higher entropy means a more uniform or 'evenly distributed' probability distribution.")
    print("Therefore, a higher NGSC value implies that the total data variance is more evenly distributed across the different principal components.")
    print("So, the statement 'more evenly distributed data variance' is equivalent to 'higher NGSC'.\n")

    print("Step 2: Re-evaluate Answer Choice K based on this understanding.")
    print("Answer Choice K says: 'Participant 4 has more evenly distributed data variance (from the bold signal) across principal components (as defined by NGSC) under each psilocybin condition scan than any other condition's scans.'")
    print("This translates to: 'For Participant 4, the NGSC value for every psilocybin scan is higher than the NGSC value for any scan in the other conditions (MTP or no drug).'\n")

    print("- J: High NGSC means low synchrony (low functional connectivity), so they are likely negatively correlated. Incorrect.")
    print("- M: NGSC=0 means one spatial mode (maximum synchrony), not signal independence. Incorrect.")
    print("- F: Looking at Fig 3b right, for every participant, the lowest NGSC value is a grey dot (no drug), not a red one (psilocybin). Incorrect.")
