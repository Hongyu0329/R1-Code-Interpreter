    "Based on the visual evidence in the image, I will determine the appropriate caries classification. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** I will identify the location of the carious lesion on the tooth. The image shows the top, or occlusal, surface of a posterior tooth (a molar or premolar). There is an existing metallic (amalgam) filling, and new decay, known as recurrent or secondary caries, is visible around its margins.\n2.  **Select the Classification System:** I will use the most common and relevant system for this type of lesion, which is G.V. Black's classification. This system categorizes caries based on their location.\n3.  **Apply the Classification:** I will match the location of the lesion (pits and fissures of the occlusal surface) to the corresponding class in G.V. Black's system.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will create a Python script that explains this logic and prints the final classification.\n\n```python\ndef get_caries_classification():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the caries classification based on its location in the provided image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # G.V. Black's Classification is based on the location of the lesion.\n    lesion_location = \"Pits and fissures on the occlusal surface of a posterior tooth.\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the location of the lesion from the image.\")\n    print(f\"The lesion is located in the: {lesion_location}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Apply G.V. Black's Classification System.\")\n    print(\"Class I cavities are defined as those occurring in pits and fissures on all teeth.\")\n    print(\"This includes the occlusal surfaces of molars and premolars.\\n\")\n\n    # The lesion in the image is located on the occlusal surface, which is a pit and fissure area.\n    # Therefore, it falls under the Class I category.\n    final_classification = \"Class I\"\n    final_class_number = 1\n\n    print(f\"Step 3: Conclude the classification.\")\n    print(f\"Because the lesion is in the pits and fissures of the occlusal surface, it is a {final_classification} lesion.\")\n    print(f\"The classification code is Class {final_class_number}\")\n\nget_caries_classification()\n```\n<<<Class I>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
