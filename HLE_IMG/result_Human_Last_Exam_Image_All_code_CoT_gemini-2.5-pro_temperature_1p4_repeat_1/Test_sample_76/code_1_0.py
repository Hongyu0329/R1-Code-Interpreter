# The problem asks for the four theoretically possible pairs of carbon atoms
# on the cubane product that can be substituted with a carboxylic acid group,
# based on a double Favorskii rearrangement mechanism.

# Based on the mechanism:
# The first rearrangement involves Br at C2. The resulting COOH can attach to C2 or C4.
# The second rearrangement involves Br at C8. The resulting COOH can attach to C6 or C8.

# This gives four possible combinations for the locations of the two COOH groups.
# We define these pairs here.
pair1 = (2, 6)
pair2 = (2, 8)
pair3 = (4, 6)
pair4 = (4, 8)

# The final answer is printed in the requested format.
# The f-string explicitly uses each number from the pairs, as requested.
