    "Based on the coordinates provided, the square structure you see in the satellite image is the ruins of **Camp Cienega Springs**, also known as Camp Cienega.\n\nThis was a small United States Army post established in 1879 near modern-day Shafter, Texas. Its purpose was to provide security for the area against Apache raids and to protect the mail route. The camp was short-lived and abandoned in 1880. The visible square outline represents the foundations of the original encampment.\n\nYes, it is considered a **historic landmark** as it's a tangible remnant of the U.S. Army's presence in West Texas during the late 19th-century Indian Wars.\n\nHere is a Python script to convert the given coordinates from Degrees, Minutes, Seconds (DMS) format to Decimal Degrees (DD), which is more commonly used in digital mapping systems.\n\n```python\ndef dms_to_dd(degrees, minutes, seconds, direction):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts coordinates from Degrees, Minutes, Seconds (DMS) to Decimal Degrees (DD).\n    \"\"\"\n    dd = float(degrees) + float(minutes)/60 + float(seconds)/(60*60)\n    if direction in ['S', 'W']:\n        dd *= -1\n    return dd\n\n# Latitude: 29° 06' 18.75''N\nlat_d = 29\nlat_m = 6\nlat_s = 18.75\nlat_dir = 'N'\n\n# Longitude: 103° 47' 50.28''W\nlon_d = 103\nlon_m = 47\nlon_s = 50.28\nlon_dir = 'W'\n\n# Perform the conversion\ndecimal_latitude = dms_to_dd(lat_d, lat_m, lat_s, lat_dir)\ndecimal_longitude = dms_to_dd(lon_d, lon_m, lon_s, lon_dir)\n\n# Print the results and the identification\nprint(f\"Identifying the structure at the given coordinates:\")\nprint(f\"Original Latitude (DMS): {lat_d}° {lat_m}' {lat_s}\\\"{lat_dir}\")\nprint(f\"Original Longitude (DMS): {lon_d}° {lon_m}' {lon_s}\\\"{lon_dir}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Converted Latitude (DD): {decimal_latitude}\")\nprint(f\"Converted Longitude (DD): {decimal_longitude}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(\"Identification: The structure is the ruins of Camp Cienega Springs.\")\nprint(\"Historic Landmark: Yes, it is a historic site from the late 19th-century U.S. Army presence in West Texas.\")\n\n```\n<<<The square structure is the ruins of Camp Cienega Springs, a 19th-century U.S. Army post.
