    Solves the nonlinear wave equation plot identification puzzle.
    
    This function returns a 16-character string representing the solution
    by assigning a code to each of the 16 plots based on visual analysis.
    The assignments are based on a detailed breakdown of how parameters b, c, and d
    affect the solution's dynamics (chaos, ripples, collapse, asymmetry).

    C: c=1 (chaos)
    c: c=-1 (ripples)
    Z: c=0 (collapse, here to red)

    D: d=1 (positive/yellow shift)
    d: d=-1 (negative/blue collapse)
    0: d=0 (asymmetric ripples)

    B: b=1 (asymmetric interaction, red-dominant)
    b: b=-1 (asymmetric interaction, blue-dominant)
    z: b=0 (collapse, here to blue)
