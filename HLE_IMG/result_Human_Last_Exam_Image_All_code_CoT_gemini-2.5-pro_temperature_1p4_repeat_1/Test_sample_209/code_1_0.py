# The user wants me to identify the giraffe from the options that matches the target.
#
# 1. Analyze the spot pattern on the target giraffe's shoulder and flank.
#    - There is a distinctive large patch on the upper shoulder.
#    - Below this patch, there is a cluster of smaller, clearly separated spots.
#    - The overall color is a fairly dark, rich brown.
#
# 2. Compare this pattern with each of the options (A-F).
#    - A, C: Color is too light/yellow. Pattern is different.
#    - D: Spots are much darker and more defined. Pattern is different.
#    - E, F: The specific arrangement of spots on the shoulder does not match the target.
#    - B: The color, shape, and specific arrangement of the spots on the shoulder and flank show a clear match to the target giraffe. The large patch and the smaller spots below it are in the same configuration.
#
# Conclusion: Image B is the correct match.

# The final answer is the letter corresponding to the correct image.
correct_image = 'B'

print(f"The image showing the same giraffe as the target is {correct_image}.")
# The problem asks for just the letter of the correct image as the final answer.
