    "This is a classic example of an acid-catalyzed dehydration followed by a series of 1,2-shifts, commonly known as a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. In the context of triterpenoids, this extensive cascade is often referred to as a \"backbone rearrangement\".\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to determine the substituents:\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** The reaction of an alcohol with catalytic acid (HCl) and heat leads to dehydration (loss of H₂O) to form a carbocation, which can then rearrange to form a more stable carbocation before eliminating a proton to form an alkene.\n\n2.  **Trace the carbocation rearrangement:** The reaction proceeds through the following cascade of 1,2-shifts. The numbers used here refer to standard triterpenoid carbon numbering for clarity.\n    *   The hydroxyl group at C-3 is protonated and leaves as water, forming a carbocation at C-3.\n    *   A methyl group migrates from C-4 to C-3. The carbocation is now at C-4.\n    *   A hydride (H) migrates from C-5 to C-4. The carbocation is now at C-5.\n    *   A methyl group migrates from C-10 to C-5. The carbocation is now at C-10.\n    *   A hydride migrates from C-9 to C-10. The carbocation is now at C-9.\n    *   A methyl group migrates from C-8 to C-9. The carbocation is now at C-8.\n    *   A hydride migrates from C-14 to C-8. The carbocation is now at C-14.\n    *   A methyl group migrates from C-13 to C-14. The carbocation is now at C-13.\n    *   Finally, a proton is eliminated from C-12 to form the stable double bond between C-12 and C-13 seen in the product.\n\n3.  **Determine the final substituents:** Now we check what group (H or CH₃) occupies each numbered position in the final product.\n    *   **Position 1 (at C-4):** This carbon starts with two methyl groups. One migrates away, and a hydride migrates in. One methyl group remains. Thus, **1 = CH₃**.\n    *   **Position 2 (at C-10):** This carbon starts with a methyl group, which migrates away. A hydride migrates in to take its place. Thus, **2 = H**.\n    *   **Position 3 (at C-8):** This carbon starts with a methyl group, which migrates away. A hydride migrates in to take its place. Thus, **3 = H**.\n    *   **Position 4 (at C-14):** This carbon starts with a hydride, which migrates away. A methyl group (from C-13) migrates in to take its place. Thus, **4 = CH₃**.\n    *   **Position 5 (at C-17):** This methyl group is not in the path of the rearrangement cascade and is unaffected. It remains in its original position. Thus, **5 = CH₃**.\n\nThe following Python code will print the final answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\n# The rearrangement of the starting material involves a cascade of 1,2-hydride and 1,2-methyl shifts.\n# This code determines the substituent at each of the five numbered positions in the final product.\n\n# Step 1: Define the initial state of the relevant positions (what migrates away).\n# Note: For positions 1 and 4, we also consider what migrates in.\n# For positions 2, 3, a methyl group leaves and a hydrogen arrives.\n# For position 5, the methyl group is a spectator and does not move.\n\nsubstituents = {\n    1: 'CH3', # At C4, one CH3 group remains after another one migrates.\n    2: 'H',     # At C10, the original CH3 group migrates away and is replaced by an H.\n    3: 'H',     # At C8, the original CH3 group migrates away and is replaced by an H.\n    4: 'CH3', # At C14, the original H migrates away and is replaced by a CH3 group from C13.\n    5: 'CH3'  # At C17, the CH3 group is not involved in the rearrangement and remains.\n}\n\n# Step 2: Format and print the result as requested.\nresult_string = \", \".join([f\"{key} = {value}\" for key, value in substituents.items()])\nprint(result_string)\n\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = CH3>>>"
