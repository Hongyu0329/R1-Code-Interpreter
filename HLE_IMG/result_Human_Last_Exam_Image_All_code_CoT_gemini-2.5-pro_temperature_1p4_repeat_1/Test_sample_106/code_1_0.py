# The rearrangement of the starting material involves a cascade of 1,2-hydride and 1,2-methyl shifts.
# This code determines the substituent at each of the five numbered positions in the final product.

# Step 1: Define the initial state of the relevant positions (what migrates away).
# Note: For positions 1 and 4, we also consider what migrates in.
# For positions 2, 3, a methyl group leaves and a hydrogen arrives.
# For position 5, the methyl group is a spectator and does not move.

substituents = {
    1: 'CH3', # At C4, one CH3 group remains after another one migrates.
    2: 'H',     # At C10, the original CH3 group migrates away and is replaced by an H.
    3: 'H',     # At C8, the original CH3 group migrates away and is replaced by an H.
    4: 'CH3', # At C14, the original H migrates away and is replaced by a CH3 group from C13.
    5: 'CH3'  # At C17, the CH3 group is not involved in the rearrangement and remains.
}

# Step 2: Format and print the result as requested.
