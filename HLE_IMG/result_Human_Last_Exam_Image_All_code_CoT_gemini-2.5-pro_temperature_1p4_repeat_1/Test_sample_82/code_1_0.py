# The intramolecular Heck reaction involves several steps.
# 1. Oxidative addition of Pd(0) to the C9-Br bond.
# 2. Intramolecular carbopalladation onto the C4=C5 double bond.
#    The product shows a new bond between C9 and C5, which means the palladium atom gets attached to C4.
# 3. Beta-hydride elimination to form the new alkene and regenerate the catalyst.
#    The palladium is on C4. The beta positions are C3 and C5.
#    Carbon C5 becomes quaternary after the previous step and has no hydrogens.
#    Carbon C3 has available hydrogens for elimination.
#    Therefore, the elimination happens between C3 and C4.
