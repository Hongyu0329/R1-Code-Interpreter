    "Based on the principles of organometallic chemistry and device engineering for LECs, we can predict the relative lifetimes of these emitters.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Structures:** The four complexes are all cationic Iridium(III) complexes with the general formula `[Ir(C^N)₂(N^N)]⁺`. The ancillary diimine ligand (`N^N` = 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine) is identical in all four cases. The key difference lies in the substitution pattern on the phenyl ring of the cyclometalating phenylpyridine (`C^N`) ligands.\n2.  **Identify Key Structural Feature:** We will examine the position of the fluorine (F) substituents on the phenyl ring relative to the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond.\n    *   **Complex 1:** Has two `C^N` ligands with F atoms at the 4- and 5-positions. These are *meta* and *para* to the Ir-C bond.\n    *   **Complex 2:** Has two `C^N` ligands with an F atom at the 4-position, which is *para* to the Ir-C bond.\n    *   **Complex 3:** Has two `C^N` ligands with an F atom at the 2-position, which is *ortho* to the Ir-C bond.\n    *   **Complex 4:** Has two `C^N` ligands with F atoms at the 2-, 4-, and 5-positions, meaning it has F atoms in the *ortho*, *meta*, and *para* positions.\n3.  **Relate Structure to Stability:** The operational lifetime of these emitters in an LEC is largely determined by their chemical stability. A primary degradation pathway involves the weakening and breaking of the Ir-C bond.\n    *   Fluorine atoms are strongly electron-withdrawing, which generally strengthens the Ir-C bond through an inductive effect, enhancing stability. This is why fluorination is a common strategy to improve emitter lifetime.\n    *   However, a substituent at the *ortho* position (like in Complexes 3 and 4) introduces severe steric hindrance. This bulky group clashes with the iridium center and the other ligands, distorting the complex from its ideal geometry. This steric strain destabilizes the complex, weakens the Ir-C bond, and facilitates non-radiative decay and chemical degradation pathways. The destabilizing steric effect of an ortho-fluorine typically outweighs its stabilizing inductive effect.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Complexes with fluorine atoms at the ortho-position are expected to be less stable and thus exhibit shorter lifetimes. Complexes 3 and 4 both feature this ortho-fluorination. Therefore, they are predicted to have shorter lifetimes compared to Complexes 1 and 2, which lack this destabilizing feature.\n\nI will now write a Python script to formalize this reasoning and identify the correct complexes.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef analyze_emitter_lifetimes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes iridium complexes to predict which will have shorter lifetimes in LECs.\n\n    The stability of iridium emitters, which correlates with device lifetime,\n    is highly sensitive to the substitution pattern on the cyclometalating ligands.\n    \n    A key principle is that substituents at the 'ortho' position (position 2)\n    of the phenyl ring (relative to the Ir-C bond) introduce steric strain.\n    This strain can destabilize the complex and weaken the Ir-C bond, leading\n    to faster degradation and shorter lifetimes.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the complexes based on the presence of ortho-Fluorine\n    # True means an ortho-Fluorine is present, which leads to shorter lifetime.\n    complexes = {\n        1: {'has_ortho_fluorine': False},\n        2: {'has_ortho_fluorine': False},\n        3: {'has_ortho_fluorine': True},\n        4: {'has_ortho_fluorine': True}\n    }\n\n    shorter_lifetime_complexes = []\n    print(\"Analysis of Iridium Complexes for LEC Lifetime:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Principle: Fluorine atoms at the ortho-position of the cyclometalating\\n\"\n          \"phenyl ring cause steric hindrance, which destabilizes the complex\\n\"\n          \"and leads to a shorter operational lifetime.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Checking each complex for ortho-fluorination:\")\n    for number, properties in complexes.items():\n        if properties['has_ortho_fluorine']:\n            print(f\" - Complex {number}: Contains an ortho-fluorine.
