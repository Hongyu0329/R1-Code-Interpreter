# Step 1: Define the known variables based on the AGI's information.
# Radius of a yellow circle in cm.
r_y = 0.5

# Radius of a white circle (r_w) in cm. Based on visual inspection and the need for it to be a multiple of 0.5,
# we deduce r_w is 1.5 cm (its diameter of 3cm is 3x the yellow circle's diameter of 1cm).
r_w = 1.5

# Step 2: Establish a geometric model for the total dimensions of the bounding box based on r_w.
# From the image, the width (W) appears to be composed of two green rectangles (width r_w each)
# and three white circles (diameter 2*r_w each).
# W = r_w + 2*r_w + 2*r_w + 2*r_w + r_w = 8 * r_w
# The height (H) appears to be the height of three stacked white circles.
# H = 2*r_w + 2*r_w + 2*r_w = 6 * r_w
W = 8 * r_w
H = 6 * r_w

# Step 3: Calculate the coordinates of the center of the right-most white circle.
# This circle is in the middle row, so its y-coordinate is at the vertical center of the box.
# The equation for the y-coordinate is y = H / 2, which is (6 * r_w) / 2 = 3 * r_w.
y_center = H / 2

# The x-coordinate can be calculated from the right edge of the box.
# The right green rectangle has a width equal to its short side, r_w.
# The center is located one radius away from its tangent point with the rectangle.
# The equation for the x-coordinate is x = W - width_green_rectangle - r_w
# x = (8 * r_w) - r_w - r_w = 6 * r_w.
x_center = W - r_w - r_w

# Step 4: Print the final calculation and the answer.
print(f"Based on the visual evidence and grid constraints, we assume the white circle radius (r_w) is {r_w} cm.")
print(f"This leads to a box width (W) of 8 * {r_w} = {W} cm and a height (H) of 6 * {r_w} = {H} cm.")
