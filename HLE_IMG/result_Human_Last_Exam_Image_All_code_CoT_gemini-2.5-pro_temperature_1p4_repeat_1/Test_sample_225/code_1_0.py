    print("=" * 45)

    # Step 1: Analyze the starting material
    print("\n1. The Reactant:")
    print("   - The starting molecule is a complex, fused polycyclic carbocation.")
    print("   - It contains three isopropylidene ketal (acetonide) groups.")
    print("   - Each acetonide group, -O-C(CH3)2-O-, protects a pair of adjacent hydroxyl groups on a phenyl ring.")

    # Step 2: Analyze the reaction conditions
    print("\n2. The Reagents and Conditions:")
    print("   - Reagent: 0.1 M HCl, which is a dilute aqueous acid solution.")
    print("   - Condition: 'reflux', meaning the mixture is heated to its boiling point.")
    print("   - Duration: 12 hours, indicating the reaction is allowed to go to completion.")

    # Step 3: Determine the chemical transformation
    print("\n3. The Reaction Type:")
    print("   - The combination of aqueous acid and heat constitutes the classic conditions for ketal hydrolysis.")
    print("   - This is a deprotection reaction, removing the acetonide groups.")

    # Step 4: Describe the formation of the product
    print("\n4. Predicting Product A:")
    print("   - The acid catalyzes the cleavage of the three ketal groups by water.")
    print("   - The balanced transformation for each of the three bridges is:")
    print("     1 (-O-C(CH3)2-O-) + 1 (H2O) --> 2 (-OH) + 1 (CH3-CO-CH3)")
    print("     (Ketal)           + (Water) --> (Diol)  + (Acetone byproduct)")
    print("   - Therefore, all three protecting groups are removed to reveal the hydroxyl groups.")

    # Step 5: Describe the final structure of Compound A
    print("\n5. Final Structure of Compound A:")
    print("   - Compound A has the same fused, positively charged core structure as the reactant.")
    print("   - The three isopropylidene ketal bridges are replaced by six hydroxyl (-OH) groups in total.")
    print("   - The final product is the hexahydroxy (containing six -OH groups) derivative of the starting cation.")
