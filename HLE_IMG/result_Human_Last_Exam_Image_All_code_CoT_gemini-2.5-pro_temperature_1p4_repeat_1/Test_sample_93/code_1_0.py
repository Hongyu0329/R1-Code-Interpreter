    This function provides the solution to the multiple-choice question about caging fluorescein.
    It explains the reasoning based on the chemical properties of fluorescein and common
    bioorthogonal chemistry strategies.
    """
    
    # Reasoning:
    # 1. To "cage" fluorescein (quench its fluorescence), one must modify the phenolic -OH groups,
    #    as they are integral to the conjugated pi-system responsible for fluorescence.
    # 2. Modifying the -OH groups to esters (e.g., with acetyl groups) is a standard and effective method.
    #    The resulting molecule, fluorescein diacetate, is non-fluorescent.
    # 3. For cell-type specific release, a genetically targeted enzyme must be used. An esterase is an
    #    enzyme that cleaves ester bonds.
    # 4. By expressing a specific esterase only in target cells, the acetyl groups can be cleaved
    #    to release the fluorescent fluorescein molecule specifically in those cells.
    # 5. This entire process is perfectly described by option B. Options targeting the COOH group (D, F)
    #    are ineffective for caging. Options with impractical chemistry (A, C) or less common
    #    enzymatic reactions (E) are inferior.

    correct_answer = "B"

    print("The chosen strategy involves modifying the hydroxyl (-OH) groups of fluorescein with acetyl groups.")
    print("This creates non-fluorescent ester bonds, effectively 'caging' the molecule.")
    print("A genetically targeted esterase enzyme, expressed only in specific cells, can then cleave these ester bonds.")
    print("This enzymatic cleavage 'uncages' the molecule, restoring fluorescence specifically in the target cells.")
