def find_atlantic_indicator_species():
  """
  This function identifies a species from the image that is a definitive
  indicator of the Atlantic Coast.

  Analysis Steps:
  1. The image displays a typical North Atlantic rocky intertidal community.
  2. Several species are visible, including barnacles (likely Semibalanus balanoides),
     periwinkles, and dogwinkles.
  3. One of the most clearly identifiable species is the common periwinkle snail,
     distinguished by its top-like shell and spiraling lines. There are several
     of them in the photo.
  4. This species' scientific name is Littorina littorea.
  5. Littorina littorea is native to the northeastern Atlantic (Europe) and is a
     widespread invasive species along the North American Atlantic coast.
  6. It is not native to the Pacific Ocean and is not considered an established
     part of its intertidal ecosystem.
  7. Therefore, its presence is a key indicator that the photograph was taken
     on a coast of the Atlantic Ocean.
