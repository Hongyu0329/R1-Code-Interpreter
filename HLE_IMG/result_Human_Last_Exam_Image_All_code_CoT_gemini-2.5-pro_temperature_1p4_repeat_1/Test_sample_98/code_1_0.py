# The image provided shows the "Pietroasa Patera," a large gold libation dish.
# It is a key part of the Pietroasa Treasure, found in Romania in 1837.
# This treasure is associated with the Goths and is dated by archaeologists to the 4th century A.D.

# To fulfill the request, we can demonstrate this with a simple calculation.
# Let's take a year within the 4th century A.D., for instance, 380 A.D.
year = 380

# The formula to calculate the century for an A.D. year is (year - 1) // 100 + 1.
century_calculation_part_1 = year - 1
century_calculation_part_2 = 100
century_calculation_part_3 = 1
calculated_century = (century_calculation_part_1) // century_calculation_part_2 + century_calculation_part_3

# As requested, here are the numbers from the equation:
print(f"Year used for calculation: {year}")
print(f"Century calculation: ({year} - {century_calculation_part_3}) // {century_calculation_part_2} + {century_calculation_part_3}")

# And the result of that calculation:
print(f"Resulting century: {calculated_century}")

# Now, we will state the final answer clearly.
print(f"Therefore, archaeologists ascribe this medallion to the {calculated_century}th century A.D.")
