    "Based on the visual characteristics of the medallion, particularly the style of the figures and the presence of a horn, I can identify the artifact and determine its age.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  **Identify the artifact:** The object in the image is a well-known historical artifact. I will identify it by its common name.\n2.  **Determine its origin and date:** I will use the established archaeological consensus to determine the time period this artifact belongs to. It is part of a larger hoard known as the Pietroasa Treasure.\n3.  **Construct Python code:** I will write a Python script that states the dating. To fulfill the requirement of showing a calculation, the script will take a representative year from the object's period and calculate the corresponding century. It will then print the components of this calculation and the final answer.\n\n```python\n# The image provided shows the \"Pietroasa Patera,\" a large gold libation dish.\n# It is a key part of the Pietroasa Treasure, found in Romania in 1837.\n# This treasure is associated with the Goths and is dated by archaeologists to the 4th century A.D.\n\n# To fulfill the request, we can demonstrate this with a simple calculation.\n# Let's take a year within the 4th century A.D., for instance, 380 A.D.\nyear = 380\n\n# The formula to calculate the century for an A.D. year is (year - 1) // 100 + 1.\ncentury_calculation_part_1 = year - 1\ncentury_calculation_part_2 = 100\ncentury_calculation_part_3 = 1\ncalculated_century = (century_calculation_part_1) // century_calculation_part_2 + century_calculation_part_3\n\n# As requested, here are the numbers from the equation:\nprint(f\"Year used for calculation: {year}\")\nprint(f\"Century calculation: ({year} - {century_calculation_part_3}) // {century_calculation_part_2} + {century_calculation_part_3}\")\n\n# And the result of that calculation:\nprint(f\"Resulting century: {calculated_century}\")\n\n# Now, we will state the final answer clearly.\nprint(f\"Therefore, archaeologists ascribe this medallion to the {calculated_century}th century A.D.\")\n\n```\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
