The S100B protein exhibits a strong affinity for the RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products) receptor. It could be used as a prognostic marker because its activation of the RAGE receptor directly initiates downstream signaling pathways (JNK/JUN and NFÎºB) that lead to the core pathological outcomes of the disease, including apoptosis, neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Therefore, its levels can predict the severity and progression of the disorder.
