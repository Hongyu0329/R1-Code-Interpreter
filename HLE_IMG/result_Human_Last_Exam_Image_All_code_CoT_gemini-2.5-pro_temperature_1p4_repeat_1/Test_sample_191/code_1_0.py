    # 2) The alternative variant is the ketiv (written form), ולו, which, if vocalized according to its meaning, is וְלוֹ ("and to him").
    answer_2 = "וְלוֹ"

    # 3) Saadia Gaon's translation "לא ואחד ... ולא נאקץ" ("not one... and not deficient") uses negation, following the qere.
    answer_3 = "q"

    # 4) The decisive word in Saadia's translation is the Arabic word for "not".

    # 5) The Karaite Yefet ben Eli translates the ketiv but also explains the qere in his commentary, thus using both as his basis.
    answer_5 = "b"

    # 6) In his primary translation, Yefet renders the ketiv ולו ("to him") with the corresponding Arabic word.
    answer_6 = "له"

    # 7) Research indicates that the most likely manuscript (RNL Yevr.-Arab. II A 291) contains Psalms 73-150. The first large section, corresponding to the divisions of Psalms, is Book III.
    answer_7 = "ps.073-089"

    # 8) The Targum uses the Aramaic word "ולית" ("and there is not"), clearly reflecting the negation in the qere.

    # 9) The decisive word in the Targum establishing the negative reading is "and there is not".
