    "To find the Jones polynomial of the knot in the image, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Knot Identification:** First, I need to identify the specific knot shown in the diagram. By counting the crossings (there are 9) and observing its structure (it is a non-alternating knot), I can compare it to standard knot tables. The knot is identified as the **9_46 knot**.\n\n2.  **Polynomial Lookup:** Once the knot is identified, I can find its well-known Jones polynomial, V(t), from a reliable source such as the Knot Atlas or a computational algebra system. For the 9_46 knot, the Jones polynomial is V(t) = t⁴ - t³ + t² - 2t + 2 - 2t⁻¹ + t⁻² - t⁻³ + t⁻⁴.\n\n3.  **Code Generation:** Finally, I will write a Python script that takes the coefficients and exponents of this polynomial and formats them into a single string, printed in decreasing degree order as requested. The code will handle positive and negative coefficients, coefficients of 1 and -1, and the constant term correctly.\n\n```python\ndef get_jones_polynomial_for_knot_9_46():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns the formatted Jones polynomial for the 9_46 knot.\n\n    The knot in the image is identified as the 9_46 knot.
