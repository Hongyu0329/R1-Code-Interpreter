    This function returns the formatted Jones polynomial for the 9_46 knot.

    The knot in the image is identified as the 9_46 knot. Its Jones polynomial V(t)
    is t^4 - t^3 + t^2 - 2t + 2 - 2t^(-1) + t^(-2) - t^(-3) + t^(-4).

    This function formats this polynomial into the required string representation.
