    "Based on the distinct honeycomb-like pattern on the skin, the animal in the image is a type of fish belonging to the family Ostraciidae, commonly known as boxfishes, cowfishes, or trunkfishes. This pattern is formed by hexagonal, bony plates fused together to form a rigid carapace.\n\nAfter careful examination of the patterns, the most likely species is the Honeycomb Cowfish. I will provide its scientific name.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = mystdout = io.StringIO()\n\ndef identify_animal():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the animal in the image and prints its scientific name.\n  The identification is based on visual analysis of the provided images.\n  The key feature is the hexagonal, honeycomb-like pattern on the animal's skin,\n  which is characteristic of the Honeycomb Cowfish.\n  \"\"\"\n  scientific_name = \"Acanthostracion polygonius\"\n  print(f\"Yes, there is an animal in the image.
