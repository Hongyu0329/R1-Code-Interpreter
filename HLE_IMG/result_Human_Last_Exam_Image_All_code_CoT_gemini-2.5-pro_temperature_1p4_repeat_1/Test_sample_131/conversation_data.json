    "This task requires identifying the chemical structure provided in the image.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Analyze the provided chemical structure. It is a complex polycyclic molecule containing nitrogen, which is characteristic of an alkaloid.\n2.  Specifically, it is a tetracyclic (four-ring) system. It contains two nitrogen atoms and a carbonyl group (C=O) that is part of a lactam ring (a cyclic amide).\n3.  This specific arrangement of rings and the functional group is the structure of a known lupin alkaloid.\n4.  By comparing the structure to known alkaloids, I can identify it as **Matrine**.\n5.  I will then create a Python script to print the name of this compound.\n\n```python\ndef identify_alkaloid():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the alkaloid from its chemical structure and prints its name.\n    The structure shown is a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid known as Matrine.\n    \"\"\"\n    compound_name = \"Matrine\"\n    print(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n\nidentify_alkaloid()\n```\n<<<Matrine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
