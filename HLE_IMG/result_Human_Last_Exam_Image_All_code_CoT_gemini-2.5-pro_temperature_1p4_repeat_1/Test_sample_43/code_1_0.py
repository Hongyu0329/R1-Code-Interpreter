    print(f"The reaction involves treating {reactant} with an excess ({stoichiometry} equivalents) of {reagent}.")
    print(f"The reaction is performed at a high temperature ({temperature_celsius}°C) for {duration_hours} hours, resulting in a single major product with a high yield of {yield_percent}%.")
    print("\n### Proposed Mechanism ###\n")
    print("Step 1: Deprotonation")
    print("The Grignard reagent, CH3MgBr, is a strong base. It first reacts with the most acidic proton in the molecule, which belongs to the tertiary alcohol (-OH) group.")
    print("This acid-base reaction consumes 1 equivalent of CH3MgBr and forms a magnesium alkoxide intermediate.\n")

    print("Step 2: Intramolecular Chelation and Activation")
    print("The magnesium ion of the newly formed alkoxide coordinates to the adjacent oxygen atom of the benzodioxole ring. This forms a five-membered chelate ring, which acts as a Lewis acid to activate the benzodioxole system.\n")

    print("Step 3: Intramolecular Ring-Opening and Expansion")
    print(f"At the elevated temperature of {temperature_celsius}°C, the alkoxide oxygen performs an intramolecular nucleophilic attack on the methylene carbon (-O-CH2-O-) of the activated benzodioxole.")
    print("This attack cleaves the five-membered benzodioxole ring and concurrently forms a new, more stable seven-membered dioxepine ring. This process also generates a magnesium phenoxide on the aromatic ring.\n")

    print("Step 4: Workup")
    print("Upon aqueous workup at the end of the reaction, the magnesium phenoxide is protonated to give the final product, which contains a phenol group (-OH).\n")

    print("### Conclusion ###\n")
    print("This mechanism, a base-promoted intramolecular rearrangement, is consistent with the formation of a single major product in high yield and aligns perfectly with the description in option C.")
    print("\n*   Option A is incorrect because Grignard reagents do not typically cleave stable benzyl or PMB ethers.")
    print("*   Option B is less likely because the intramolecular rearrangement (Option C) is generally kinetically favored.")
    print("*   Options D and E are incorrect as they postulate the formation of an 'ethoxy' group, which has no plausible source.\n")

    print("Therefore, the correct description of the product and mechanism is provided in option C.")
