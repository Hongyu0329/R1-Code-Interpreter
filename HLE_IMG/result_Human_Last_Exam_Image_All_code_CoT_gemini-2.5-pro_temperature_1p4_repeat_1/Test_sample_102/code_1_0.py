# The reaction is a thermal [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement (a type of Cope rearrangement)
# followed by tautomerization of the resulting enol to an aldehyde.
#
# Step 1: The [3,3] shift rearranges the 1,5-diene system.
# The reactant is a 4-hydroxy-5-methoxy-1,5-diene.
# The rearrangement leads to a new structure where the side chain is attached at C3 of the ring,
# the ring double bond is at C1=C2, and the side chain contains an enol.
#
# Step 2: The enol intermediate (-C(OCH3)=CH(OH)) tautomerizes to the more stable aldehyde (-CH(OCH3)-CHO).
#
# Step 3: We name the final aldehyde product according to IUPAC rules.
# The principal functional group is the aldehyde (-CHO), so the parent chain is propanal.
# The propanal chain has three substituents:
# - A methoxy group at position 2.
# - A methyl group at position 3.
# - A cyclohex-1-en-3-yl group at position 3.
#
# Assembling the name gives:
product_name = "3-(cyclohex-1-en-3-yl)-2-methoxy-3-methylpropanal"
