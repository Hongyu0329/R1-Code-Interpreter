    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Given Information:** From the image, we have a circular sector. The radius `R` is given by the length of the line segment `OA`, which is 34. At the edge of the sector, there is a right-angled triangle `OAP` with leg `OA = 34` and leg `AP = 17`.\n\n2.  **Determine Key Angles:** The angle `θ` at the center `O` can be found using the right-angled triangle `OAP`. `tan(θ) = opposite/adjacent = AP/OA = 17/34 = 0.5`. Thus, `θ = arctan(0.5)`. The total angle of the sector shown is `4θ`.\n\n3.  **Formulate an Area Calculation Strategy:** The total shaded area is the union of the blue and red regions. This area can be calculated by finding the area of a large polygon that encloses the shaded regions and then subtracting the area of the unshaded circular sector within that polygon.\n    *   The enclosing polygon is `OAPBQC`, where `O` is the center, and `A, P, B, Q, C` are the vertices on the boundary.\n    *   The area of this polygon can be shown to be the sum of four triangles: `OAP`, `OPB`, `OBQ`, and `OQC`. By symmetry and geometric construction, all four of these triangles have the same area.\n    *   The area of triangle `OAP` is `0.5 * base * height = 0.5 * 34 * 17 = 289`.\n    *   So, the total area of the polygon `OAPBQC` is `4 * 289 = 1156`.\n    *   The area of the central circular sector `OAC` needs to be subtracted. This sector has a radius `R = 34` and a total angle of `4θ`. Its area is `0.5 * R² * (4θ) = 2 * R² * θ`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Area:**\n    *   Area(Polygon) = `1156`.\n    *   Area(Sector) = `2 * 34² * arctan(0.5) = 2312 * arctan(0.5)`.\n    *   Total Shaded Area = Area(Polygon) - Area(Sector).\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values from the diagram.\nR = 34  # Radius of the circular sector.\nx = 17  # Length of the perpendicular side to the radius.\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the angle theta.\n# From the right-angled triangle at the edge, tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent.\n# theta in radians.\ntheta = math.atan(x / R)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the area of the large enclosing polygon (OAPBQC).\n# This polygon is composed of four triangles, each with an area equal to triangle OAP.\narea_one_triangle = 0.5 * R * x\narea_polygon = 4 * area_one_triangle\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the area of the central circular sector (OAC).\n# The total angle for this sector is 4 * theta.\nR_squared = R**2\narea_sector = 0.5 * R_squared * (4 * theta)\n\n# Step 5: The total shaded area is the difference between the polygon area and the sector area.\ntotal_shaded_area = area_polygon - area_sector\n\n# Output the calculation steps and the final equation.\nprint(\"Here are the steps to calculate the total shaded area:\")\nprint(\"\\n1. Calculate the area of the enclosing polygon OAPBQC.\")\nprint(f\"   The polygon consists of 4 identical triangles. The area of one triangle is 0.5 * base * height.\")\nprint(f\"   Area of one triangle = 0.5 * {R} * {x} = {area_one_triangle}\")\nprint(f\"   Area of the polygon = 4 * {area_one_triangle} = {area_polygon}\")\n\nprint(\"\\n2.

The total shaded area is the area of the polygon minus the area of the sector.\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\nprint(f\"Total Area = (4 * (0.5 * {R} * {x})) - (2 * {R}^2 * arctan({x}/{R}))\")\nprint(f\"Total Area = {int(area_polygon)} - {int(2*R_squared)} * arctan(0.5)\")\n\nprint(\"\\nResult:\")\nprint(f\"Total Area ≈ {total_shaded_area:.2f}\")\n\n<<<84.05>>>\n```"
