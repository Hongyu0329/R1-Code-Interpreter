# Step 1: Define the given values from the diagram.
R = 34  # Radius of the circular sector.
x = 17  # Length of the perpendicular side to the radius.

# Step 2: Calculate the angle theta.
# From the right-angled triangle at the edge, tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent.
# theta in radians.
theta = math.atan(x / R)

# Step 3: Calculate the area of the large enclosing polygon (OAPBQC).
# This polygon is composed of four triangles, each with an area equal to triangle OAP.
area_one_triangle = 0.5 * R * x
area_polygon = 4 * area_one_triangle

# Step 4: Calculate the area of the central circular sector (OAC).
# The total angle for this sector is 4 * theta.
R_squared = R**2
area_sector = 0.5 * R_squared * (4 * theta)

# Step 5: The total shaded area is the difference between the polygon area and the sector area.
total_shaded_area = area_polygon - area_sector

# Output the calculation steps and the final equation.
