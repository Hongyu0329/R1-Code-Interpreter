    "To solve this problem, we first need to identify each mineral specimen and then determine its silicate structure. The complexity of silicate structures increases with the degree of polymerization, i.e., how many oxygen atoms are shared between the silicon-oxygen tetrahedra.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Minerals:**\n    *   **Specimen A:** A dark, prismatic crystal. Its form is typical of a pyroxene-group mineral like augite, which is a single-chain silicate.\n    *   **Specimen B:** A green, flaky mineral that cleaves into thin sheets. This is characteristic of a mica-group mineral, which is a sheet silicate (phyllosilicate).\n    *   **Specimen C:** A granular aggregate of olive-green crystals. This appearance is classic for olivine, an isolated-tetrahedra silicate (nesosilicate).\n    *   **Specimen D:** A translucent, glassy crystal. This is a common form of quartz, which is a framework silicate (tectosilicate).\n\n2.  **Classify by Silicate Structure:**\n    *   **Olivine (C):** Nesosilicate (isolated tetrahedra, SiO₄). Lowest complexity.\n    *   **Pyroxene (A):** Inosilicate (single chains, SiO₃).\n    *   **Mica (B):** Phyllosilicate (sheets, Si₂O₅).\n    *   **Quartz (D):** Tectosilicate (framework, SiO₂). Highest complexity.\n\n3.  **Order by Increasing Complexity:**\n    The order of increasing polymerization and structural complexity is:\n    Isolated Tetrahedra -> Single Chains -> Sheets -> Framework.\n    Therefore, the correct order for the specimens is **C, A, B, D**.\n\n4.  **Generate Python Code:**\n    The following Python code will programmatically identify the specimens, assign them their silicate structure and a complexity score, sort them, and print the final ordered list.\n\n```python\ndef solve_silicate_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies mineral specimens, classifies their silicate structure,\n    and orders them by increasing structural complexity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify specimens and classify their silicate structure.\n    # A complexity_rank is assigned for sorting purposes (lower is less complex).\n    specimens = [\n        {'id': 'A', 'mineral': 'Pyroxene', 'structure': 'Inosilicate (Single Chain)', 'complexity_rank': 2},\n        {'id': 'B', 'mineral': 'Mica', 'structure': 'Phyllosilicate (Sheet)', 'complexity_rank': 3},\n        {'id': 'C', 'mineral': 'Olivine', 'structure': 'Nesosilicate (Isolated Tetrahedra)', 'complexity_rank': 1},\n        {'id': 'D', 'mineral': 'Quartz', 'structure': 'Tectosilicate (Framework)', 'complexity_rank': 4}\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identifying each specimen and its silicate structure.\")\n    for specimen in specimens:\n        print(f\"Specimen {specimen['id']}: Identified as {specimen['mineral']}, a {specimen['structure']}.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Ordering the specimens by increasing silicate structure complexity.\")\n    print(\"Complexity Order: Nesosilicate < Inosilicate < Phyllosilicate < Tectosilicate\")\n\n    # Step 3: Sort the specimens based on their complexity rank.\n    sorted_specimens = sorted(specimens, key=lambda x: x['complexity_rank'])\n    \n    # Extract the IDs for the final answer\n    ordered_ids = [s['id'] for s in sorted_specimens]\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Order:\")\n    print(\"The specimens ordered by increasing silicate structure complexity are:\")\n    # Using ' -> '.join() to create the arrow-separated string\n    print(' -> '.join(ordered_ids))\n\n# Run the function to display the solution\nsolve_silicate_complexity()\n```\n<<<C -> A -> B -> D>>>"
