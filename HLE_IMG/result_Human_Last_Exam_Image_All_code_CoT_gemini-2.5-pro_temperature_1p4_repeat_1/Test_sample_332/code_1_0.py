# The riddle connects Carl Sagan's philosophy about Earth's place in the cosmos with the name of a celestial feature.
# 1. Carl Sagan's "Pale Blue Dot" speech is a call for perspective, responsibility, and ultimately, a hopeful vision for humanity's future.
# 2. This suggests the key phrase "X of Y" could be "Lake of Hope", capturing the essence of Sagan's message.
# 3. A search for a celestial feature with this name leads to "Lacus Spei" on the Moon. In Latin, "Lacus Spei" translates directly to "Lake of Hope".
# 4. In the phrase "Lake of Hope", 'X' is "Lake" and 'Y' is "Hope".
# 5. The riddle asks for the value of Y.

# Therefore, Y is "Hope".
