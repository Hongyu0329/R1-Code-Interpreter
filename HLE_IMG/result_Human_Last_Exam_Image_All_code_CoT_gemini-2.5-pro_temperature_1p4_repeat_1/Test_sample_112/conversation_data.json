    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to determine the viewpoint's country:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Data:**\n    *   **Image:** A fisheye view of the night sky from the software Stellarium.\n    *   **Timestamp:** 20:07:37 on 2024-10-22.\n    *   **Time Zone:** The prompt explicitly states the time is in CEST (Central European Summer Time), which is UTC+2.\n    *   **Celestial Objects:** Jupiter is very high in the sky (near the top of the fisheye view, suggesting it's near the zenith). Saturn is extremely low on the horizon. Vega and Capella are also visible.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Contradiction:**\n    *   I first convert the time to a standard reference: 20:07:37 CEST is 18:07:37 UTC.\n    *   I check what the sky would look like from a country in the CEST time zone (e.g., Germany, Italy, France) at that time.\n    *   In late October, 20:07 CEST is early evening, just after twilight.\n    *   At this time in Europe, Jupiter (in the constellation Taurus) would have just risen in the east and would be at a low altitude. Saturn (in Aquarius) would be in the southern sky, at a moderate altitude, not setting on the horizon.\n    *   The sky shown in the image (with a near-zenith Jupiter) is impossible to see at 20:07 CEST from any location in a CEST country. This is the central puzzle.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:**\n    *   The only way to reconcile the timestamp with the visual evidence is to assume the location is *not* in a CEST country, but the software's time display has been manually set to show \"CEST\".\n    *   The sky in the image, with Jupiter culminating (at its highest point) and Saturn setting, is characteristic of a time around 2-3 AM local time.\n    *   So, I need to find a location on Earth where the local time is ~2-3 AM when the UTC time is 18:07.\n    *   The time difference is approximately +8 hours (2 AM next day minus 6 PM UTC). A time zone of UTC+8 corresponds to a longitude of roughly `8 hours * 15 degrees/hour = 120° East`.\n    *   For Jupiter to be very high in the sky, the observer's latitude should be reasonably close to Jupiter's declination at that time (~+19° North).\n    *   This points to a location in East Asia. The coordinates `~20-30° N, 120° E` fall squarely within China.\n\n4.  **Verify the Hypothesis with Code:**\n    *   I will now write a Python script to test this hypothesis.\n    *   The script will calculate the exact altitude of Jupiter and Saturn from a location in China (let's use 30°N, 120°E as a representative point) at the precise time given in the image (18:07:37 UTC on 2024-10-22).\n    *   If the calculated altitudes match the image (Jupiter high, Saturn low), the hypothesis is confirmed, and the country is China.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom skyfield.api import load, Topos\n\ndef solve_celestial_mystery():\n    \"\"\"\n    Verifies the location of a celestial image by calculating planet positions.\n    \n    The plan is to test the hypothesis that the image was taken from China,\n    at the UTC time corresponding to the timestamp shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
