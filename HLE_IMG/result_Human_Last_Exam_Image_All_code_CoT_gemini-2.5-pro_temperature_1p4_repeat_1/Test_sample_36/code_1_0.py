    # 2. Evaluate the DIKW Model's applicability.
    # The DIKW (Data -> Information -> Knowledge -> Wisdom) model structures the transformation of raw data.
    # The `VA Sales List` starts as data and is refined into information (qualified leads).
    # The `VA Sales Script` is a form of knowledge derived from analyzing successful interactions.

    # 3. Evaluate the SECI Model's applicability.
    # The SECI (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization) model focuses on creating and sharing knowledge.
    # It explains how to convert tacit knowledge (an expert salesperson's skills) into explicit knowledge (a written `VA Sales Script` or `Work Manual/Template`).
    seci_relevance = "The SECI model is crucial for capturing the expertise of skilled employees and converting it into documented assets like scripts and manuals that the whole team can use."

    # Bloom's Taxonomy is a framework for individual learning and training, not organizational knowledge management.
    # It's useful for designing a sales training program but not for managing the company's knowledge base as a whole.
    blooms_relevance = "Bloom's Taxonomy is primarily for designing individual training programs, not for managing knowledge as an organizational asset."

    # 5. Conclusion: A combined approach is best.
    # To both structure information flow (DIKW) and facilitate knowledge sharing and creation (SECI), a combined strategy is needed.
    conclusion = "A combination of the DIKW and SECI models provides the most comprehensive solution. DIKW helps structure the data, and SECI helps capture and disseminate the human expertise required to use that data effectively."
