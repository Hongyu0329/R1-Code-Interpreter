    Calculates eccentricities for nine planetary plots and lists them in ascending order.
    
    The core logic relies on the physical principle that in this three-body system,
    increasing the stars' orbital eccentricity leads to more chaotic motion for the planet.
    The plots are ordered visually from least chaotic (most stable) to most chaotic.
    This visual order is then mapped to the ascending order of eccentricity.
    
    - e = 0 (most stable): Corresponds to Plot 3, with the largest, most regular stable region.
    - e increases -> Chaos increases: The stable regions shrink, distort, and fragment.
    - The deduced order of plots, from lowest to highest eccentricity, is {3, 9, 1, 5, 2, 8, 7, 4, 6}.
