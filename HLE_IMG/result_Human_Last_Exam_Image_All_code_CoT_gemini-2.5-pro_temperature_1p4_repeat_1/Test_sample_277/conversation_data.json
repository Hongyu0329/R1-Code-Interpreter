    "The image provided is completely black, so I am unable to see the molecules to which you are referring. Without the visual information of the molecular structures, I cannot directly determine their relationship.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with a Python script that acts as an interactive guide. To solve the problem, you will need to examine the molecules from your original source and answer a series of simple yes/no questions about them. The script will then apply the rules of chemical isomerism to determine the correct classification and provide you with the final answer.\n\nThe logical steps are as follows:\n1.  **Check Molecular Formula:** Are the number and types of atoms the same in both molecules?\n2.  **Check Connectivity:** Are the atoms connected to each other in the same sequence?\n3.  **Check Superimposability:** If the formula and connectivity are the same, can the 3D structures be perfectly overlapped?\n4.  **Check Interconversion:** If they are not superimposable, can they be turned into one another just by rotating single bonds?\n\nBased on your answers to these questions, the script will identify the relationship as constitutional isomers, stereoisomers, conformers, identical, or none of these.\n\n```python\ndef classify_molecules():\n    \"\"\"\n    An interactive guide to classify the relationship between two molecules.\n    Please answer the questions with 'yes' or 'no'.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Molecule Relationship Classifier ---\")\n    print(\"Please examine the two molecules and answer the following questions to find the correct choice.\")\n    print(\"The options are: (a) conformers isomers, (b) constitutional isomers, (c) Identical, (d) stereoisomers, (e) None of these\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Compare Molecular Formula\n    formula_same = input(\"1.
