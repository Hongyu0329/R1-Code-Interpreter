    "This is an Eastern Orthodox icon, specifically a fresco painted in 1378 by the renowned Byzantine and Russian iconographer Theophanes the Greek. It is located in the Church of the Transfiguration of the Savior on Ilyina Street in Veliky Novgorod, Russia.\n\nThe figure depicted is one of the Desert Fathers, early Christian hermits who lived in the Egyptian desert. By identifying the specific fresco, we can confirm the subject. Art historical sources identify this saint as Saint Macarius of Egypt (also known as Macarius the Great). He was a prominent figure in the desert monastic movement of the 4th century.\n\nThe text on the scroll he holds is in Old Church Slavonic and contains teachings attributed to him concerning purity of heart. This visual evidence, combined with the known identity of this famous artwork, allows for a confident identification.\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the saint depicted in the icon.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The fresco is a well-known work by Theophanes the Greek.\n    # It is located in the Church of the Transfiguration in Veliky Novgorod.\n    # Art history identifies the figure as Saint Macarius of Egypt.\n    answer = 'B'\n    print(f\"The icon depicts Saint Macarius of Egypt.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the correct option is {answer}.\")\n\nsolve_task()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
