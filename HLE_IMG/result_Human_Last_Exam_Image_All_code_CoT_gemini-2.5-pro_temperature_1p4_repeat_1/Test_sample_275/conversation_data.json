    "To find the total number of splice species, I will systematically analyze the RT-PCR results presented in each panel of the image. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze experiments by primer pair:** I will group the experiments by the primer pairs used to identify distinct sets of splice variants.\n2.  **Count unique bands per group:** For each group, I will count the number of unique bands, as each distinct band represents a unique splice species detected by that primer pair.\n3.  **Avoid double-counting:** I will ensure that species detected across different experiments (e.g., the species in Panel B also being detected in Panels C, D, E, F) are only counted once. A new species is only counted if it arises from a new primer pair detecting a new product, or a more sensitive experiment revealing previously unseen products.\n4.  **Sum the results:** I will add up the number of unique species identified from all experiments to get the final total.\n\nThe analysis proceeds as follows:\n*   **Panels B-F (Early region splicing):** Panel B shows 2 bands, representing 2 splice species. Panels C, D, E, and F provide further details on these same 2 species but do not introduce new ones.\n*   **Panel G (Alternate early splicing):** This experiment uses a unique primer (E1F3) that detects a different splice junction. The 2 bands seen here represent 2 new species.\n*   **Panels H & I (Late region splicing):** These experiments amplify transcripts from the early to the late region (E1 to L1). Panel H detects 2 species. Panel I, being more sensitive, confirms these 2 and reveals 2 additional, less abundant species. This gives a total of 4 unique species from this primer pair.\n\nThe final count is the sum of the species found in these distinct groups. The Python code below will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_splice_species():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the total number of splice species based on the provided RT-PCR data.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing splice species from Panels B, C, D, E, F.\")\n    # Panel B reveals two distinct splice variants (bands at 190 bp and 159 bp).\n    # Panels C-F confirm and characterize these two variants but do not add new ones.\n    species_from_early_region = 2\n    print(f\"Panel B shows 2 distinct bands, indicating {species_from_early_region} splice species.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing splice species from Panel G.\")\n    # Panel G uses a primer (E1F3) specific for a new splice junction and reveals two new bands.\n    species_from_G = 2\n    print(f\"Panel G reveals 2 new bands (1,003 bp and 931 bp), indicating {species_from_G} additional splice species.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyzing splice species from Panels H and I.\")\n    # Panel H shows two bands (450 bp and 419 bp).\n    # Panel I confirms these two and reveals two more (378 bp and 187 bp).\n    species_from_H = 2\n    species_from_I_new = 2\n    species_from_late_region = species_from_H + species_from_I_new\n    print(f\"Panels H and I together reveal 4 distinct bands (450, 419, 378, and 187 bp), indicating {species_from_late_region} additional splice species.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Final Calculation\n    total_species = species_from_early_region + species_from_G + species_from_late_region\n    print(\"Final Calculation: Summing the unique species from each experiment group.\")\n    print(f\"Total Species = (Species from Panels B-F) + (Species from Panel G) + (Species from Panels H & I)\")\n    print(f\"Total Species = {species_from_early_region} + {species_from_G} + {species_from_late_region} = {total_species}\")\n\ncalculate_splice_species()\n<<<8>>>"
