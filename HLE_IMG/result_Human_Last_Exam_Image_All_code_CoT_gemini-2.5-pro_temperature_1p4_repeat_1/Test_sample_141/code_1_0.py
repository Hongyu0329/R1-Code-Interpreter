    print("\nPair A (B3a and B3b):")
    print("These are protons on the central pyridinium ring B.")
    print("In a static structure, they are non-equivalent because the substituents at N1 (-H) and C4 (-hydrazone) are different.")
    print("However, a rapid proton transfer (tautomerism) between N1 and the nitrogen at C4 would create a time-averaged symmetry.")
    print("This makes H(B3a) and H(B3b) equivalent on the NMR timescale. So, A is considered equivalent.")

    # Explanation for Pair B
    print("\nPair B (C3 and C5):")
    print("These are meta-protons on the terminal phenyl ring C.")
    print("Rapid rotation around the C-C single bond connecting ring C to the molecule is expected, even at 220K.")
    print("This rotation averages their environments, making them chemically equivalent. So, B is equivalent.")

    # Explanation for Pair C
    print("\nPair C (C2 and C4):")
    print("These are ortho (C2) and para (C4) protons on the phenyl ring C.")
    print("They have fundamentally different constitutional positions and can never be equivalent. So, C is not equivalent.")

    # Explanation for Pair D
    print("\nPair D (D3 and A3):")
    print("These are corresponding protons on the two pyridyl rings, A and D.")
    print("Their equivalence depends on the equivalence of rings A and D.")
    print("The same rapid tautomerism that makes pair A equivalent also makes rings A and D equivalent in a time-averaged sense.")
    print("Therefore, H(A3) and H(D3) are equivalent. So, D is considered equivalent.")

    # Final Conclusion
    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Pairs A, B, and D are equivalent on the 1H NMR timescale at 220K.")
