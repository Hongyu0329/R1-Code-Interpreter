    This function identifies and prints the name of the auditory illusion

    The image shows a spectrogram and waveform of a pure tone that is
    interrupted by a burst of noise. The illusion occurs when the human
    brain perceives the tone as continuing without interruption through the noise.
    This perceptual "filling-in" of a missing sound is a well-documented
    phenomenon.
