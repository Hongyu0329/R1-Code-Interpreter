    "Here is my thinking process for identifying the unknown compound from its mass spectrum:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Ion (M⁺) Region**: I first look at the highest mass-to-charge (m/z) region of the spectrum to find the molecular ion peak. I see a cluster of peaks at m/z 260, 262, 264, and 266. This characteristic pattern strongly suggests the presence of multiple chlorine atoms, due to the natural isotopic abundance of ³⁵Cl (~75.8%) and ³⁷Cl (~24.2%), which have a mass difference of 2.\n2.  **Determine the Number of Chlorine Atoms**: I will test the hypothesis that the compound contains three chlorine atoms.\n    *   The theoretical intensity ratio for a species with three chlorines is M⁺ : (M+2)⁺ : (M+4)⁺ : (M+6)⁺ ≈ 100 : 97.5 : 32.5 : 3.7.\n    *   The observed peaks are at m/z 260 (I=34.8), 262 (I=29.0), 264 (I=12.9), and 266 (I=3.22).\n    *   Normalizing the observed intensities to the most intense peak in the cluster (m/z 260), I get a ratio of approximately 100 : 83 : 37 : 9.\n    *   This observed ratio is a reasonably good match for the theoretical pattern of three chlorine atoms. The molecular ion (containing only ³⁵Cl) is therefore at m/z 260.\n3.  **Identify the Base Peak and Key Fragmentation**:\n    *   The base peak (the most intense peak) is at m/z 225 (I=100).\n    *   The mass difference between the molecular ion (260) and the base peak (225) is 35 amu. This corresponds to the loss of a single chlorine atom (Cl· radical). So, the base peak represents the [M-Cl]⁺ fragment.\n    *   The stability of this [M-Cl]⁺ fragment (being the base peak) suggests that losing one chlorine atom creates a very stable carbocation.\n    *   I also see other major fragments at m/z 190 and 155.\n        *   225 - 35 = 190. This is the [M-2Cl]⁺ fragment.\n        *   190 - 35 = 155. This is the [M-3Cl]⁺ fragment.\n    *   This clear sequential loss of all three chlorine atoms is a very strong piece of evidence.\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Formula**:\n    *   The molecular weight is 260, and it contains 3 Cl atoms.\n    *   The mass of the non-chlorine part of the molecule is 260 - (3 * 35) = 260 - 105 = 155 amu.\n    *   The fragment at m/z 155 corresponds to this chlorine-free part, [CₓHᵧOₙ...]⁺.\n    *   The even molecular weight (260) suggests the molecule has 0 or an even number of nitrogen atoms. Let's assume zero.\n    *   The mass 155 could correspond to C₁₂H₁₁ (highly unsaturated) or C₁₀H₁₉O (saturated, with one oxygen).\n    *   The fragmentation pattern (sequential loss of Cl·) is more typical of an aliphatic (chain-like) compound than a stable aromatic one. Furthermore, prominent fragments typical of aromatic rings (like m/z 77 for phenyl) are very weak or absent. This favors the C₁₀H₁₉O core.\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula is likely **C₁₀H₁₉OCl₃**. This corresponds to a saturated (Degree of Unsaturation = 0) trichlorinated decanol (alcohol) or a related ether.\n5.  **Determine the Isomer Structure (IUPAC Name)**:\n    *   The fragmentation provides clues to the specific structure. We need to find an isomer of C₁₀H₁₉OCl₃ that explains the key peaks.\n    *   Let's test the structure **1,1,1-Trichlorodecan-2-ol**: CCl₃-CH(OH)-(CH₂)₇-CH₃.\n    *   This fits the formula and molecular weight.\n    *   The loss of a chlorine radical from the -CCl₃ group to form the base peak [⁺CCl₂-CH(OH)-R] at m/z 225 is plausible due to stabilization by the remaining chlorine atoms.\n    *   Crucially, we can check for fragmentation specific to a secondary alcohol: alpha-cleavage (breaking the bonds next to the carbon with the -OH group).\n        *   **Cleavage of the C1-C2 bond**: This would involve the loss of a ·CCl₃ radical (mass 117). The remaining fragment [CH(OH)-(CH₂)₇-CH₃]⁺ would have m/z = 260 - 117 = 143. Looking at the data table, there is a significant peak at **m/z 143** with an intensity of 27.8.\n        *   **Cleavage of the C2-C3 bond**: This would involve the loss of a ·C₈H₁₇ (octyl) radical (mass 113). The remaining fragment [CCl₃-CH=OH]⁺ would have m/z = 260 - 113 = 147. Looking at the data table, there is a small but present peak at **m/z 147** with an intensity of 1.02.\n    *   The presence of these alpha-cleavage fragments provides strong evidence for the 1,1,1-trichloro-decan-2-ol structure.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mass_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided mass spectrum data to identify the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Key data points from the provided spectrum table\n    peaks = {\n        266: 3.22, 264: 12.9, 262: 29.0, 260: 34.8,\n        229: 22.2, 227: 66.7, 225: 100.0,\n        192: 24.5, 190: 48.4,\n        155: 16.1,\n        147: 1.02, 143: 27.8\n    }\n\n    # --- Step 1 & 2: Analyze Molecular Ion (M+) and determine Cl count ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the Molecular Ion (M+) Region\")\n    m_ion_cluster_obs = {\n        '260': peaks[260], '262': peaks[262], '264': peaks[264], '266': peaks[266]\n    }\n    # Normalize to the most intense peak in the cluster (m/z 260)\n    norm_factor = m_ion_cluster_obs['260']\n    m_ion_ratio_obs = {k: round(100 * v / norm_factor, 1) for k, v in m_ion_cluster_obs.items()}\n    \n    # Theoretical ratios for 3 Chlorine atoms (M, M+2, M+4, M+6)\n    m_ion_ratio_theo_3cl = {'M': 100, 'M+2': 97.5, 'M+4': 32.5, 'M+6': 3.7}\n    \n    print(f\"The highest mass cluster is observed at m/z = {list(m_ion_cluster_obs.keys())}.\")\n    print(f\"Observed intensity ratio: M(260):M+2(262):M+4(264):M+6(266) ≈ {m_ion_ratio_obs['260']}:{m_ion_ratio_obs['262']}:{m_ion_ratio_obs['264']}:{m_ion_ratio_obs['266']}\")\n    print(f\"Theoretical ratio for 3 Cl atoms: {m_ion_ratio_theo_3cl['M']}:{m_ion_ratio_theo_3cl['M+2']}:{m_ion_ratio_theo_3cl['M+4']}:{m_ion_ratio_theo_3cl['M+6']}\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: The pattern strongly suggests the presence of 3 Chlorine atoms and a molecular weight of 260 amu (for the all-³⁵Cl isotopomer).\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Identify Base Peak and Fragmentation Cascade ---\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing Fragmentation\")\n    molecular_ion_mass = 260\n    base_peak_mass = 225\n    mass_loss_cl = 35\n\n    print(f\"The base peak (highest intensity) is at m/z = {base_peak_mass}.\")\n    print(f\"Mass difference from M+ ({molecular_ion_mass}) = {molecular_ion_mass} - {base_peak_mass} = {molecular_ion_mass - base_peak_mass} amu.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to the loss of one Chlorine atom (mass ≈ {mass_loss_cl}).
