    "My plan to determine the time complexity of the given algorithm is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Algorithm's Logic:** I will first dissect the recursive structure of the `sort(a, n)` function. It has a base case for `n <= 1` and a recursive step for `n > 1`. The recursive step consists of one unconditional recursive call, `sort(a, n - 1)`, followed by a comparison and a potential swap, which is then followed by another conditional recursive call, `sort(a, n - 1)`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Worst-Case Scenario:** The time complexity depends on how many times the recursive calls are made. The worst case will occur when the `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` condition is true as often as possible, thus triggering the second recursive call at each level of the recursion. This typically happens with an input array that is sorted in reverse order.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation:** I will establish a recurrence relation for the time complexity, `T(n)`, which represents the number of operations for an input of size `n`. In the worst case, the function performs the work of two subproblems of size `n-1`, plus a constant amount of work `C` for the comparison and swap. This gives the relation: `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + C`.\n\n4.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:** I will solve this recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for `T(n)`. This type of relation, where the problem size decreases by a constant and the work branches into two, characteristically leads to an exponential solution. By expanding the relation, we can see that `T(n)` grows in proportion to `2^n`.\n\n5.  **Create a Demonstrative Python Script:** To verify the analysis and provide a clear explanation, I will write a Python script. This script will:\n    *   Implement the given sorting algorithm.\n    *   Include a counter to track the number of recursive calls, which serves as a proxy for the number of operations.\n    *   Run the algorithm on worst-case inputs (reverse-sorted arrays) for increasing sizes `n`.\n    *   Print a table comparing `n`, the actual number of calls, and the value of `2^n`, visually demonstrating the exponential growth.\n    *   The script's output will also explain the derivation of the recurrence relation and the conclusion about the time complexity.\n\nThis step-by-step process will lead to a confident conclusion about the algorithm's worst-case time complexity.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# The algorithm provided has a deep recursion, so we increase the limit.\n# This is necessary for the demonstration, even for moderately small 'n'.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(35000)\n\n# We use a global variable to count the number of calls to the sort function.\n# This will serve as our measure of the number of operations.\ncall_count = 0\n\ndef swap(arr, i, j):\n    \"\"\"A standard helper function to swap two elements in an array.\"\"\"\n    arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n\ndef sort_algorithm(a, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    The sorting algorithm from the problem description, instrumented with a call counter.\n    `a` is the list (array) and `n` is the size of the prefix to consider.\n    \"\"\"\n    global call_count\n    call_count += 1\n\n    if n > 1:\n        # 1.
