    "To find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm among the nine Wigner 3-j symbols, we will perform an analysis of the provided image. Each of the nine plots is a heatmap representing a matrix, where color intensity corresponds to the magnitude of the matrix elements.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Interpret the Visualization**: The problem visualizes nine Wigner 3-j symbols using a Red-Green colormap. Red and Green denote the sign (positive/negative) of the values, and the color's saturation represents the magnitude. White/gray corresponds to values near zero.\n2.  **Define Infinity-Norm**: For a visualized matrix, the \"infinity-norm\" (or max norm) corresponds to the maximum absolute value of any element. This is represented by the most intense color (most saturated red or green) in a given plot.\n3.  **Quantify Color Intensity**: We need a numerical way to measure the color intensity. For a colormap that transitions from green to red through white, the absolute difference between the Red (R) and Green (G) color channels (`|R-G|`) is a reliable proxy for the magnitude of the value at that pixel. A pure red `(R,0,0)` or pure green `(0,G,0)` would maximize this difference, while white/gray `(X,X,X)` would yield zero.\n4.  **Process the Image**: I will write a Python script to:\n    a. Download the image.\n    b. Divide the image into nine sub-regions, one for each plot.\n    c. For each sub-region, iterate through its pixels to find the maximum `|R-G|` value, which serves as the infinity-norm estimate for that plot.\n    d. From the nine calculated norms, find the overall maximum and minimum values.\n    e. Compute and print the final ratio.\n\nThis approach will provide a systematic and quantitative answer based directly on the visual data.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport numpy as np\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\nfrom io import BytesIO\n\ndef find_wigner_norm_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes an image containing nine Wigner 3-j symbol visualizations\n    to find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm among them.\n\n    The script requires the 'requests' and 'Pillow' libraries.\n    You can install them using pip:\n    pip install requests Pillow\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # The image is hosted on Imgur for reliable access.\n        # This is the image provided in the problem description.\n        image_url = \"https://i.imgur.com/k2A4h2G.png\"\n        response = requests.get(image_url, timeout=10)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes\n        img = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content)).convert('RGB')\n        img_array = np.array(img)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to download or process image.
