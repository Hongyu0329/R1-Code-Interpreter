    "Based on the analysis of the musical notation, including the chord progression (C, E7, F, G7, etc.), syncopated melody, and common structure for popular songs (indicated by the Segno and Coda markings), I can identify the piece. This is a very famous jazz standard.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the title of the song based on its melody and chord structure, which are characteristic of the well-known tune \"All of Me\".\n2.  Determine the musical style associated with this song. \"All of Me\" is a quintessential jazz standard from the Swing era.\n3.  Find the country of origin. The composers, Gerald Marks and Seymour Simons, were American, and the song was published in the United States in 1931.\n4.  Write a Python script to print this information.\n\n```python\ndef get_song_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the information about the song in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"All of Me\"\n    musical_style = \"Jazz Standard / Swing\"\n    country_of_origin = \"USA\"\n\n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Musical Style: {musical_style}\")\n    print(f\"Country of Origin: {country_of_origin}\")\n\nget_song_info()\n```\n<<<Title: All of Me, Musical Style: Jazz Standard / Swing, Country of Origin: USA>>>"
