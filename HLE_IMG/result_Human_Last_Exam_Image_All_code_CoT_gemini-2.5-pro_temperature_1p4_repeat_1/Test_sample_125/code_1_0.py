# Step 1: Identify the number of six-membered rings in the target molecule structure.
six_membered_rings = 8

# Step 2: Identify the number of five-membered rings in the target molecule structure.
five_membered_rings = 2

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of rings, which we interpret as the "minimum number of steps".
total_steps = six_membered_rings + five_membered_rings

# Step 4: Print the final equation and the result.
print(f"The number of six-membered rings is: {six_membered_rings}")
print(f"The number of five-membered rings is: {five_membered_rings}")
print(f"The final equation is: {six_membered_rings} + {five_membered_rings} = {total_steps}")
print(f"The minimum number of steps is {total_steps}.")
