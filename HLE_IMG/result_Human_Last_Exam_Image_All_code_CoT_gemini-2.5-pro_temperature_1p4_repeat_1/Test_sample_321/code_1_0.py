    This function prints the solution to the Wind-Scattered Epidemiological Puzzle.

    # Parameter-Identifier Mapping from the problem description:
    # mu:1, mu_s:2, mu_n:3, a_i:5, f_s:6, c_l:7, mu_h:8,
    # beta_h:9, r_b:11, c_h:12, q_s:13, q_l:14, q_f:15

    # Based on logical deduction, the mapping from plot number to parameter ID is as follows:
    # p_n is the identifier for the parameter varied in plot n.
    
    p_1 = 3  # Corresponds to mu_n. The effect of varying mu_n (mortality of normally infected) is significant due to the large size and high infectivity of the I_n pool. Plot 1 shows a substantial change in the epidemic outcome.
    p_2 = 2  # Corresponds to mu_s. This plot's sharp, threshold-like drop is explained if hospital capacity is overwhelmed (due to "undocumented alterations"), making the mortality of unhospitalized severe cases (mu_s) a critical factor.
    p_3 = 5  # Corresponds to a_i. Varying the incubation period smoothly changes the time scale of the epidemic, matching the smooth divergence of the curves in this plot.
    p_4 = 15 # Corresponds to q_f. The "kink" during a fixed time interval shows the effect of varying the quarantine's effectiveness (q_f), which alters the curve's slope during that period.
    p_5 = 6  # Corresponds to f_s. A higher f_s (fraction severe) paradoxically leads to a milder epidemic because all severe cases are hospitalized and become less infectious. This plot of an increasing variable (like total deaths) matches this inverse relationship.
    p_6 = 9  # Corresponds to beta_h. This parameter affects the hospitalized pool, which is a less dominant transmission route. It produces a noticeable but smaller effect on the epidemic outcome compared to parameters affecting the I_n pool, matching the moderate separation of curves in Plot 6.
    p_7 = 7  # Corresponds to c_l. The curves are simply scaled versions of one another, a unique feature indicating that a cost-scaling factor (c_l or c_h), which doesn't affect epidemic dynamics, is being varied.
    p_8 = 1  # Corresponds to mu. The baseline mortality rate `mu` is very small, so varying it has a minimal impact on the epidemic curves. This matches the closely-grouped curves in Plot 8.
    p_9 = 14 # Corresponds to q_l. The "shoulder" in these increasing curves has a varying length, which is the signature of varying the quarantine's duration (q_l).

    final_sequence = [p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5, p_6, p_7, p_8, p_9]
