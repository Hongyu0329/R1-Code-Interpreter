    "Here is my plan to determine the molecular formula of the product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:** I will first identify the structure of the starting molecule and calculate its molecular formula by counting the number of Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), Fluorine (F), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O) atoms.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1 (PMB Deprotection):** The first step uses Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN), which is a standard reagent for removing the p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group from a nitrogen atom. I will calculate the change in atomic composition to find the formula of Intermediate 1. This involves subtracting the atoms of the PMB group and adding a hydrogen atom.\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 2 (Hydrogenation):** The second step is a catalytic hydrogenation (Pd/C, H2), which reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) to a single bond (C-C). This adds two hydrogen atoms to the molecule. I will update the atomic count to get the formula for Intermediate 2.\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 3 (Lactam Hydrolysis):** The final step involves heating with strong acid (HCl), which causes the hydrolysis of the lactam (a cyclic amide). This reaction opens the ring by adding one molecule of water (H2O). I will perform this final addition to determine the molecular formula of the product.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that programmatically follows these steps, starting from the initial molecular formula and applying the changes for each reaction to find the final product's formula. The script will print the formula at each stage and a final summary.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_molecular_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product of a three-step reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Determine the formula of the starting material.\n    # The structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-en-3-one derivative.\n    # Core (deprotected, un-hydrogenated, C6-H): C7H9NO\n    # Add CF3 substituent: C7H9NO - H + CF3 -> C8H8F3NO (This is Intermediate 1)\n    # Add PMB group to N: C8H8F3NO - H + C8H9O (PMB group) -> C16H16F3NO2\n    atoms = {'C': 16, 'H': 16, 'F': 3, 'N': 1, 'O': 2}\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step calculation of the molecular formula:\\n\")\n\n    def print_formula(atom_dict, name):\n        # Helper function to print the formula in a standard format.\n        order = ['C', 'H', 'F', 'N', 'O']\n        formula_str = \"\".join([f\"{el}{atom_dict.get(el, 0)}\" for el in order if atom_dict.get(el, 0) > 0])\n        print(f\"Formula of {name}: {formula_str}\")\n\n    print(\"1.
