    "To calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate Total VMT for the Baseline Scenario:** For each trip distance category, we'll calculate a weighted VMT. The formula for the VMT contribution of each category is:\n    `(Share of Total Trips) * (Total Car Mode Share) * (Average Trip Distance)`\n    We will sum the VMT contributions from all four distance categories to get the total Baseline VMT.\n\n2.  **Calculate Total VMT for the Proposed Scenario:** We will use the same formula as in step 1, but with the data from the 'Proposed' table (Table 2).\n\n3.  **Calculate the Percentage Reduction:** The reduction is calculated using the formula:\n    `((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100`\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_vmt_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage reduction in Car VMT based on the provided tables.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data from the tables\n    # Common data for both scenarios\n    share_of_total_trips = [0.48, 0.22, 0.14, 0.16]\n    average_trip_distance = [1, 4, 7.5, 20]\n\n    # Baseline scenario data (Table 1)\n    baseline_car_1_occupant_share = [0.25, 0.38, 0.40, 0.42]\n    baseline_car_gt2_occupants_share = [0.28, 0.43, 0.45, 0.47]\n\n    # Proposed scenario data (Table 2)\n    proposed_car_1_occupant_share = [0.01, 0.08, 0.14, 0.16]\n    proposed_car_gt2_occupants_share = [0.02, 0.19, 0.27, 0.33]\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate Baseline VMT\n    baseline_vmt = 0\n    for i in range(len(share_of_total_trips)):\n        total_car_share = baseline_car_1_occupant_share[i] + baseline_car_gt2_occupants_share[i]\n        baseline_vmt += share_of_total_trips[i] * total_car_share * average_trip_distance[i]\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate Proposed VMT\n    proposed_vmt = 0\n    for i in range(len(share_of_total_trips)):\n        total_car_share = proposed_car_1_occupant_share[i] + proposed_car_gt2_occupants_share[i]\n        proposed_vmt += share_of_total_trips[i] * total_car_share * average_trip_distance[i]\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate Percentage Reduction\n    vmt_reduction = baseline_vmt - proposed_vmt\n    percentage_reduction = (vmt_reduction / baseline_vmt) * 100\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate Baseline Car VMT\")\n    print(f\"Total Baseline Car VMT (weighted average) = {baseline_vmt:.4f} miles\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate Proposed Car VMT\")\n    print(f\"Total Proposed Car VMT (weighted average) = {proposed_vmt:.4f} miles\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Calculate Percentage Reduction\")\n    print(\"Percentage Reduction = ((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100\")\n    print(f\"Percentage Reduction = (({baseline_vmt:.4f} - {proposed_vmt:.4f}) / {baseline_vmt:.4f}) * 100\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe percentage of Car VMT that can be reduced is: {percentage_reduction:.1f}%\")\n\ncalculate_vmt_reduction()\n```\n<<<52.2>>>"
