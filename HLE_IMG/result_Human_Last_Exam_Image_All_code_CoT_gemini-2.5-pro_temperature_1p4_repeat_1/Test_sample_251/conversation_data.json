    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the ECG strip, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the ECG Parameters:** The paper speed is given at the top left: 25 mm/sec. The ECG grid consists of small 1 mm squares and larger 5 mm squares.\n2.  **Calculate Time per Square:**\n    *   The time for one small square (1 mm) is `1 sec / 25 mm = 0.04 seconds`.\n    *   The time for one large square (5 mm) is `5 mm * 0.04 sec/mm = 0.2 seconds`.\n3.  **Identify the Longest Interval:** By visually inspecting the rhythm strip, we can see a significant pause in the fourth line of the ECG recording (starting around timestamp 0:06:08). This pause represents the longest R-R interval.\n4.  **Measure the Interval:** We need to measure the distance between the two R-wave peaks that bracket this pause.\n    *   The peak of the R-wave before the pause aligns perfectly with a heavy vertical grid line.\n    *   Counting from this line, we find the next R-wave peak is located after 7 large squares and an additional 2 small squares.\n    *   Total number of small squares = (7 large squares * 5 small squares/large square) + 2 small squares = 35 + 2 = 37 small squares.\n5.  **Calculate the Time:** We will now write a Python script to multiply the number of small squares by the time per small square to get the total duration of the interval in seconds.\n\n```python\n# ECG parameters\npaper_speed_mm_per_sec = 25\n\n# Time calculation for one small square (1mm)\ntime_per_small_square_sec = 1 / paper_speed_mm_per_sec\n\n# Measurement of the longest R-R interval from the ECG strip\n# The longest interval spans 7 large squares and 2 small squares.\n# Since 1 large square = 5 small squares, the total is:\nnum_large_squares = 7\nnum_small_squares_extra = 2\ntotal_small_squares = (num_large_squares * 5) + num_small_squares_extra\n\n# Calculate the longest R-R interval in seconds\nlongest_rr_interval_sec = total_small_squares * time_per_small_square_sec\n\n# Output the calculation\nprint(f\"The longest R-R interval spans {total_small_squares} small squares.\")\nprint(f\"The paper speed is {paper_speed_mm_per_sec} mm/sec, so each small square represents {time_per_small_square_sec:.2f} seconds.\")\nprint(f\"Calculation: {total_small_squares} squares * {time_per_small_square_sec:.2f} sec/square = {longest_rr_interval_sec:.2f} seconds.\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe longest R-R interval is {longest_rr_interval_sec:.2f} seconds.\")\n\n```\n<<<1.48>>>"
