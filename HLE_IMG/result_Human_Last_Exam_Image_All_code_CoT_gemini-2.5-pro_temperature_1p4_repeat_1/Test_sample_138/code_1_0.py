# The solution is based on identifying sexual dimorphism in each insect pair.

# For pair A (Coelioxys bees):
# The insect on the left has a sharply pointed abdomen, which is a female trait used for laying eggs.
# The insect on the right has a multi-spined abdomen tip, which is a male trait.
# Therefore, pair A is Female, Male (F, M), which corresponds to index 4.
index_A = 4

# For pair B (Polistes wasps):
# The insect on the left has antennae that are curled at the tips, a definitive male characteristic.
# The insect on the right has straight antennae, characteristic of a female.
# Therefore, pair B is Male, Female (M, F), which corresponds to index 3.
index_B = 3

# For pair C (Melissodes, long-horned bees):
# The insect on the left has very long antennae, the defining trait of a male "long-horned bee".
# The insect on the right has much shorter antennae, which is characteristic of a female.
# Therefore, pair C is Male, Female (M, F), which corresponds to index 3.
index_C = 3

# Print the indices for A, B, and C, separated by commas.
print(index_A, index_B, index_C, sep=',')
