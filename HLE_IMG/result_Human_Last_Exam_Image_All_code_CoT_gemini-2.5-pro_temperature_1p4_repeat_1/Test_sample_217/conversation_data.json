    "This is a knowledge-based question that can be answered by identifying the cuneiform sign. I will write a Python script that will explain the identity of the sign and then select the correct answer from the provided list.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify the cuneiform sign shown in the image.\n2.  Determine its meaning, specifically in the third millennium BCE.\n3.  Compare this meaning with the given answer choices.\n4.  Write a Python script to print the explanation and the final correct answer choice.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_cuneiform_mystery():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the cuneiform sign and prints the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The cuneiform sign shown is É (also transliterated as E2).\n    # Its pictographic origin is a representation of a building's floor plan.\n    # In Sumerian, the language of the third millennium BCE in Mesopotamia,\n    # É is the logogram for \"house\" or \"temple\".\n\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Tool',\n        'B': 'Guard',\n        'C': 'Bread',\n        'D': 'Home',\n        'E': 'Deity',\n        'F': 'Beard'\n    }\n\n    explanation = (\n        \"The cuneiform sign in the image is É.\\n\"\n        \"This sign is a logogram representing the Sumerian word for 'house' or 'temple'.\\n\"\n        \"Its form in the third millennium BCE, as shown, is a pictograph of a building.\\n\"\n        \"Among the given choices, 'Home' is the correct meaning.\"\n    )\n\n    print(explanation)\n\n    correct_choice = 'D'\n    # The final answer is enclosed in <<< >>>\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"<<<{correct_choice}>>>\\n\")\n\nsolve_cuneiform_mystery()\n```\n<<<D>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
