    "To find the value of the current I, we will use nodal analysis.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Nodes and Potentials:** First, we identify the key nodes in the circuit and their electrical potentials.\n    *   The bottom wire is connected to ground, so its potential is 0 V.\n    *   The battery has a voltage of 41 V. Its negative terminal is connected to ground, and its positive terminal is connected to the third horizontal wire from the top. Therefore, this wire has a potential of 41 V.\n    *   Let's analyze the connections. The leftmost vertical wire connects the top wire, the second wire (with the 8 Ω resistor), and the source wire (at 41 V). This means the left ends of the 76 Ω, 8 Ω, and 11 Ω resistors are all connected to the 41 V source.\n    *   The current `I` is shown flowing in a wire from the 41 V source rail to the junction connecting the 8 Ω and 14 Ω resistors. Assuming this is an ideal wire, the potential at this junction must also be 41 V.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Circuit:**\n    *   The 76 Ω and 8 Ω resistors are connected between the same two points. The left side is at 41 V. The right side is also connected to a node that we've determined is at 41 V (the endpoint of the wire with current I).\n    *   Since both ends of the 76 Ω and 8 Ω resistors are at the same potential (41 V), the voltage drop across them is 0 V. Consequently, no current flows through them, and they can be removed from the circuit for the purpose of calculating `I`.\n    *   The simplified circuit now consists of the 11 Ω and 14 Ω resistors connected in parallel. This parallel combination is then connected in series with the 29 Ω resistor. The entire series-parallel combination is connected across the 41 V source.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Current I:**\n    *   The current `I` is the current flowing through the branch containing the 14 Ω resistor.\n    *   We can find this current using the current divider rule or by first calculating the voltage at the node between the parallel resistors (11 Ω, 14 Ω) and the series resistor (29 Ω).\n    *   Let's calculate the node voltage (`V_node`) at the junction of the 11 Ω, 14 Ω, and 29 Ω resistors. The parallel combination of 11 Ω and 14 Ω forms a voltage divider with the 29 Ω resistor.\n    *   Once `V_node` is found, the voltage across the 14 Ω resistor is `41 V - V_node`.\n    *   Finally, Ohm's law (`I = V/R`) gives us the current `I` through the 14 Ω resistor.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Backup stdout\nstdout_backup = sys.stdout\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# --- Start of the student's code ---\n\n# Define the given values from the circuit diagram\nV_s = 41.0  # Voltage of the source in Volts\nR11 = 11.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR14 = 14.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR29 = 29.0  # Resistance in Ohms\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the equivalent resistance of R11 and R14 in parallel.\n# According to the analysis, the 76 Ohm and 8 Ohm resistors have no current flowing\n# through them and can be disregarded.\n# The simplified circuit has R11 and R14 in parallel, connected in series with R29.\nR_p = (R11 * R14) / (R11 + R14)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the voltage at the node (V_node) between the parallel combination\n# (R_p) and R29 using the voltage divider formula. V_node is the voltage across R29.\nV_node = V_s * R29 / (R_p + R29)\n\n# Step 3: The voltage across the 14 Ohm resistor is the source voltage minus V_node.\nV_R14 = V_s - V_node\n\n# Step 4: The current I is the current flowing through the 14 Ohm resistor.\n# We find it using Ohm's Law: I = V/R\nI = V_R14 / R14\n\n# --- Printing the results ---\n# Print the final equation with all the numbers.
