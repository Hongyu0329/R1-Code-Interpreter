# Define the given values from the circuit diagram
V_s = 41.0  # Voltage of the source in Volts
R11 = 11.0  # Resistance in Ohms
R14 = 14.0  # Resistance in Ohms
R29 = 29.0  # Resistance in Ohms

# Step 1: Calculate the equivalent resistance of R11 and R14 in parallel.
# According to the analysis, the 76 Ohm and 8 Ohm resistors have no current flowing
# through them and can be disregarded.
# The simplified circuit has R11 and R14 in parallel, connected in series with R29.
R_p = (R11 * R14) / (R11 + R14)

# Step 2: Calculate the voltage at the node (V_node) between the parallel combination
# (R_p) and R29 using the voltage divider formula. V_node is the voltage across R29.
V_node = V_s * R29 / (R_p + R29)

# Step 3: The voltage across the 14 Ohm resistor is the source voltage minus V_node.
V_R14 = V_s - V_node

# Step 4: The current I is the current flowing through the 14 Ohm resistor.
# We find it using Ohm's Law: I = V/R
I = V_R14 / R14

# --- Printing the results ---
# Print the final equation with all the numbers. This is part of the required output format.
