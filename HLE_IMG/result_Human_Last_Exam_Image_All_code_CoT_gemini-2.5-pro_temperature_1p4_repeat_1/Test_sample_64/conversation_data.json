    "This image illustrates a biological process. My plan is to first identify the process by analyzing the sequence of events shown in panels L, M, and N. Then, I will write a Python script to print a detailed explanation of this process, as requested by the user prompt.\n\n1.  **Image Analysis:**\n    *   The images show a microscopic, filamentous structure divided by cross-walls (septa). This is characteristic of a fungal hypha.\n    *   Panel **L** displays a straight section of the hypha. The arrowhead points to a septum.\n    *   Panel **M** shows the same hypha where a small bulge, indicated by the arrowhead, has formed on the side of the cell wall, near the septum.\n    *   Panel **N** reveals that this bulge has grown significantly, forming a new lateral branch. The arrowhead points to the base of this new branch.\n\n2.  **Process Identification:** The sequence from L to N clearly documents the formation of a new branch from an existing hypha. This fundamental process in fungal biology is known as **hyphal branching**.\n\n3.  **Code Generation:** I will now create a Python script that uses the `print()` function to output a clear description of hyphal branching as observed in the images.\n\n```python\ndef explain_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function explains the biological process shown in the provided image sequence.\n  \"\"\"\n  title = \"Process Depicted: Hyphal Branching\"\n  explanation_lines = [\n      \"The image sequence (L, M, N) illustrates the process of hyphal branching in a filamentous fungus.\",\n      \"\",\n      \"Here is a step-by-step breakdown:\",\n      \"1. Panel L: Shows a mature, septate (containing cross-walls) fungal hypha. The structure is relatively straight and uniform. The arrowhead points to a septum.\",\n      \"2. Panel M: A small bulge begins to form on the side of the hypha, near the septum. This is the initiation of a new branch, as highlighted by the arrowhead.\",\n      \"3. Panel N: The bulge has grown outwards to form a new, distinct lateral branch. This process allows the fungus to expand its network (mycelium) to search for nutrients.\"\n  ]\n  \n  print(title)\n  print(\"-\" * len(title))\n  for line in explanation_lines:\n    print(line)\n\nexplain_process()\n```\n<<<Hyphal branching>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
