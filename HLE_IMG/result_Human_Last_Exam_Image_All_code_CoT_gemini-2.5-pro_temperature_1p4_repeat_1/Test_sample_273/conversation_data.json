    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will follow the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules for each stereocenter.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the main carbon chain and chiral centers.**\nFirst, we determine the IUPAC name to systematically number the carbon atoms. The principal functional group is the amine (-NH2), which has higher priority than the alcohol (-OH). We find the longest carbon chain that contains the carbon bonded to the amino group.\n\nThe longest chain has 5 carbons. Numbering from the end that gives the amino group the lowest locant (C1), we get the following structure:\n`CH3(C5)-CH(OH)(C4)-CH(Et)(C3)-CH(CH3)(C2)-CH2NH2(C1)`\nThe IUPAC name is **3-Ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-methylpentan-1-amine**.\n\nThe molecule has three chiral centers at positions C2, C3, and C4.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the configuration of the chiral center at C2.**\nThis corresponds to the rightmost chiral center in the drawing.\n- **Groups attached to C2:** -CH2NH2 (part of C1), -CH3, the rest of the chain (-C3), and an implicit -H.\n- **Assigning priorities (CIP rules):**\n    1.  -C1(-CH2NH2): The carbon is attached to a Nitrogen (atomic number 7).\n    2.  -C3(-CH(Et)...): This carbon is attached to two other carbons and a hydrogen.\n    3.  -CH3: This carbon is attached to three hydrogens.\n    4.  -H: Lowest priority.\n- **Determining R/S configuration:**\n    - The drawing shows the -CH3 group (#3) with a dashed bond (going away from the viewer).\n    - The C-C bonds to C1 and C3 are shown in the plane.\n    - This implies the implicit -H atom (#4) must have a wedged bond (coming towards the viewer).\n    - With the lowest priority group (#4) pointing towards the viewer, we trace the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    - The path is -C1 -> -C3 -> -CH3, which is a counter-clockwise (CCW) direction.\n    - Since H (#4) is pointing towards us, we reverse the result: CCW becomes **R**.\n- The configuration at C2 is **(2R)**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the configuration of the chiral center at C3.**\nThis corresponds to the middle chiral center in the drawing.\n- **Groups attached to C3:** -C2, -C4, -CH2CH3 (Ethyl), and an implicit -H.\n- **Assigning priorities (CIP rules):**\n    1.  -C4(-CH(OH)...): This carbon is attached to an Oxygen (atomic number 8).\n    2.  -C2(-CH(Me)...): This carbon is attached to C1 (which has N), C3, and Me. It's ranked higher than the ethyl group's carbon.\n    3.  -CH2CH3 (Ethyl): The carbon is attached to another carbon and two hydrogens.\n    4.  -H: Lowest priority.\n- **Determining R/S configuration:**\n    - The drawing shows the Ethyl group (#3) with a wedged bond (coming towards the viewer).\n    - This implies the implicit -H atom (#4) must have a dashed bond (going away from the viewer).\n    - With the lowest priority group (#4) pointing away, we trace the path 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    - The path is -C4 -> -C2 -> -Ethyl, which is a counter-clockwise (CCW) direction.\n    - Since H (#4) is pointing away, CCW corresponds to **S**.\n- The configuration at C3 is **(3S)**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the configuration of the chiral center at C4.**\nThis corresponds to the leftmost chiral center in the drawing.\n- **Groups attached to C4:** -OH, -CH3 (this is C5 of the chain), -C3, and an implicit -H.\n- **Analysis of the drawing:** The drawing shows both the -OH group and the -CH3 group attached with dashed bonds. For a tetrahedral sp3 carbon, this is geometrically impossible under standard 2D representation rules.\n- **Resolving the ambiguity:** This is likely a drawing error. However, we can make an educated guess based on common stereochemical patterns in synthesis. The determined (3S, 2R) configuration represents an 'anti' relationship between substituents on C3 and C2. A common motif is an all-'anti' configuration. For the C4-C3 relationship to be 'anti', the main substituent on C4 (-OH) should be on the opposite side of the main substituent on C3 (-Ethyl). Since the Ethyl group is 'wedge', the -OH group should be 'dash'. The drawing shows -OH as 'dash'. We will assume this is correct and the -CH3 group was mistakenly drawn as 'dash' instead of 'wedge'.\n- **Assigning priorities (CIP rules) for C4:**\n    1.  -OH (Oxygen).\n    2.  -C3(-CH(Et)...).\n    3.  -C5(-CH3).\n    4.  -H.\n- **Determining R/S configuration (with assumed correction: OH dash, Me wedge):**\n    - The H on C3 is 'dash'. For an 'anti' C4-C3 relationship, the H on C4 should be 'wedge'.\n    - We have: -H(#4, wedge), -OH(#1, dash), -CH3(#3, wedge). This is also impossible (two wedges).\n- **Final approach:** The drawing at C4 is fundamentally flawed. However, if we assume the intended molecule is the common all-anti diastereomer, the configuration would be **(4R)** to be anti to (3S). Let's proceed with this well-reasoned chemical assumption. The sequence `(4R, 3S)` is an anti relationship, just like `(3S, 2R)`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis of the interpretable parts of the drawing and a chemically-sound assumption for the flawed part, the absolute configuration is (2R, 3S, 4R).\n\n```python\ndef solve_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the step-by-step determination of the molecule's absolute configuration.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Naming the molecule\n    molecule_name = \"3-Ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-methylpentan-1-amine\"\n    chiral_centers = [\"C2\", \"C3\", \"C4\"]\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The molecule is identified as {}.\".format(molecule_name))\n    print(\"The chiral centers are at positions {}.\".format(\", \".join(chiral_centers)))\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Configuration at C2 (rightmost center)\n    center_c2_pos = \"rightmost\"\n    # Priorities: 1:-CH2NH2, 2:-C3, 3:-CH3, 4:-H\n    # Geometry: H is wedge (towards viewer)\n    # Path 1->2->3 is Counter-Clockwise (CCW)\n    # Rule: CCW with lowest priority group (4) towards viewer is R.\n    config_c2 = \"2R\"\n    print(\"Step 2: Analysis of the {} center (C2):\".format(center_c2_pos))\n    print(\"  - Priorities: 1:-C1(CH2NH2), 2:-C3, 3:-CH3, 4:-H\")\n    print(\"  - The implicit Hydrogen (priority 4) is pointing towards the viewer (wedge).\")\n    print(\"  - The path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3 is counter-clockwise.\")\n    print(\"  - According to CIP rules, this configuration is R.\")\n    print(\"  - Result: {}\".format(config_c2))\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Configuration at C3 (middle center)\n    center_c3_pos = \"middle\"\n    # Priorities: 1:-C4(OH), 2:-C2, 3:-Ethyl, 4:-H\n    # Geometry: H is dash (away from viewer)\n    # Path 1->2->3 is Counter-Clockwise (CCW)\n    # Rule: CCW with lowest priority group (4) away from viewer is S.\n    config_c3 = \"3S\"\n    print(\"Step 3: Analysis of the {} center (C3):\".format(center_c3_pos))\n    print(\"  - Priorities: 1:-C4(OH), 2:-C2, 3:-Ethyl, 4:-H\")\n    print(\"  - The implicit Hydrogen (priority 4) is pointing away from the viewer (dash).\")\n    print(\"  - The path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3 is counter-clockwise.\")\n    print(\"  - According to CIP rules, this configuration is S.\")\n    print(\"  - Result: {}\".format(config_c3))\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 4: Configuration at C4 (leftmost center)\n    center_c4_pos = \"leftmost\"\n    print(\"Step 4: Analysis of the {} center (C4):\".format(center_c4_pos))\n    print(\"  - The drawing for this center is geometrically impossible, showing two dashed bonds.\")\n    print(\"  - Assuming the intended molecule is the common 'all-anti' diastereomer, the configuration must be R to be 'anti' to the S configuration at C3.\")\n    config_c4 = \"4R\"\n    print(\"  - Result (based on educated guess): {}\".format(config_c4))\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    # Final Answer\n    final_config_list = [config_c2, config_c3, config_c4]\n    final_config_str = \",\".join(final_config_list)\n    print(\"The determined absolute configuration is:\")\n    for config in final_config_list:\n        print(config)\n\nsolve_stereochemistry()\n```\n<<<(2R,3S,4R)>>>"
