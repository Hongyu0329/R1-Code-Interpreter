# The plan is to deduce the four pieces of information from the provided image
# and then format them into a single line of text.

# 1. Vowel-marking system:
# The vowel points are placed above the consonants, which is characteristic of the
# Babylonian vocalization system. The first word is "babylonian".
vowel_system = "babylonian"

# 2. Time span:
# Manuscripts with Babylonian pointing, particularly from the Cairo Genizah
# (as the shelfmark suggests), are typically dated from the 9th to 12th centuries CE.
# A seven-century span that encompasses this period is the 8th to the 14th century.
# In the format xx-yy, this is "08-14".
time_span = "08-14"

# 3. Material:
# The material is clearly processed animal skin, showing follicles and characteristic wear.
# This material is known as parchment (or vellum).
material = "parchment"

# 4. Verse Numbering:
# The manuscript is a bifolium (two pages). On the right page, we look at the left column.
# The text begins with "וַיַּעֲשׂוּ כֵן בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל" (vaya'asu ken benei yisrael),
# followed by "כְּכֹל אֲשֶׁר צִוָּה יְהוָה אֶת-מֹשֶׁה כֵּן עָשׂוּ"
# (k'khol asher tzivah Adonai et-Moshe ken asu).
# This text is found in the Book of Numbers, chapter 1, verse 54.
# The BHS (Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia) is the standard critical edition of the Hebrew Bible.
# Formatting according to the instructions (num.ccc:vvv):
# Book: Numbers -> "num"
# Chapter: 1 -> "001"
# Verse: 54 -> "054"
verse = "num.001:054"

# Combine and print the final answer string.
final_answer = f"{vowel_system} {time_span} {material} {verse}"
print(final_answer)

# Restore stdout and get the captured output
sys.stdout = old_stdout
output = captured_output.getvalue()

# Print the final formatted answer as the last line.
# Note: The '<<<...>>>' format is for the final enclosing system, not for the python script itself.
# The python script's sole purpose is to print the required string.
# print(f"<<<{output.strip()}>>>")
