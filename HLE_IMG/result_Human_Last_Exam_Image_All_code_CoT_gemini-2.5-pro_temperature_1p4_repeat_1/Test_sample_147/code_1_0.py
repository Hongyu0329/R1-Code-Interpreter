    1.  Determine the Color Model (Grayscale vs. Color):
        The final line of the shader is:
        COLOR.rgb = vec3(vec3(Worley(UV, points), ...).x);
        - The inner `vec3(...)` creates a temporary vector with three Worley noise values.
        - The `.x` operator selects the first of these values: Worley(UV, points).
        - The outer `vec3()` constructor is called with a single float value. In GLSL, this creates a vector where all components are equal to that float.
        - The result is `vec3(W1, W1, W1)`, where W1 is the Worley value.
        - Since R, G, and B are always equal, the output image must be grayscale. This eliminates images A, B, D, and F.

    2.  Analyze the Noise Algorithm:
        - The `Worley` function finds the `min()` distance from a pixel to a list of feature points. This is the definition of F1 Worley Noise.
        - A key characteristic of F1 Worley noise is that it produces distinct cells around each feature point. The boundaries between these cells are sharp creases.

    3.  Compare with Remaining Images (C and E):
        - Image C displays a pattern with dark centers and sharp, well-defined creases between them. This is the classic appearance of F1 Worley noise.
        - Image E is also a gradient pattern, but it is much smoother and lacks the characteristic sharp creases. The transitions are blurry.
        - Therefore, the algorithm described in the shader code matches the visual output of Image C.
