    "This image fragment is from the Tillinge runestone, located in Uppland, Sweden. This runestone is notable for its unique grid-like pattern. Although it does not explicitly mention Ingvar the Far-Travelled, it is often associated with the group of Ingvar runestones due to its style, dating, and the context of the inscription.\n\nI have identified the specific rune sequences in the photograph which match the known inscription of this stone. Its official designation in the *Sveriges runinskrifter* (Runes of Sweden) catalog is U 785.\n\nThe following Python code will print this identification.\n\n```python\ndef find_runestone_id():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the runestone from the image and prints its official ID.\n    \n    The identification process involves:\n    1. Recognizing the unique grid-like pattern of the runes.\n    2. Matching the visible rune sequences to known inscriptions.\n    3. This leads to the Tillinge runestone in Uppland, Sweden.\n    4. The official ID consists of a province code and a number.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The province code 'U' stands for Uppland.\n    province_code = \"U\"\n    \n    # The catalog number for the Tillinge runestone.\n    catalog_number = 785\n    \n    print(f\"The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image is known as the Tillinge runestone.\")\n    print(f\"Its official ID in the Sveriges runinskrifter catalog is composed of a province code and a number.\")\n    print(f\"The province code is: '{province_code}'\")\n    print(f\"The catalog number is: {catalog_number}\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the full ID is: {province_code} {catalog_number}\")\n\nfind_runestone_id()\n```\n<<<U 785>>>"
