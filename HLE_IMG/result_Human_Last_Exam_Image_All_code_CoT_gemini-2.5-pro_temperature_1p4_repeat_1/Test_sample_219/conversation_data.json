    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** Visually inspect the provided raster plot. A synchronized burst is characterized by a dense, vertical column of firing activity across many electrodes, indicating that numerous neurons are firing at nearly the same time. I will estimate the center timestamp for each of these prominent bursts.\n2.  **List Timestamps:** Create a list of the identified timestamps in seconds.\n3.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** Calculate the time difference between each consecutive pair of burst timestamps.\n4.  **Calculate the Average IBI:** Compute the average of all the calculated inter-burst intervals.\n5.  **Format the Output:** Present the identified timestamps, the calculation of the intervals, and the final calculation of the average, ensuring the final answer is rounded to two significant figures.\n\nBased on visual inspection of the graph, the synchronized bursts occur at approximately 7s, 17s, 27s, 37s, and 47s. Now, I will use Python to calculate the average inter-burst interval.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_average_inter_burst_interval():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies timestamps of synchronized bursts from a neuronal activity graph,\n    calculates the inter-burst intervals, and computes the average interval.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the timestamps of the synchronized bursts from the graph.\n    # These are the time points with dense, vertical columns of firing activity.\n    burst_timestamps = [7, 17, 27, 37, 47]\n    print(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (the time between consecutive bursts).\n    intervals = []\n    print(\"Calculating inter-burst intervals:\")\n    for i in range(len(burst_timestamps) - 1):\n        interval = burst_timestamps[i+1] - burst_timestamps[i]\n        intervals.append(interval)\n        print(f\"Interval {i+1}: {burst_timestamps[i+1]}s - {burst_timestamps[i]}s = {interval}s\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the average of the intervals.\n    average_interval = np.mean(intervals)\n\n    # Step 4: Display the final calculation and the result.\n    # Construct the equation string for the final output.\n    equation_str = f\"({ ' + '.join(map(str, intervals)) }) / {len(intervals)}\"\n    print(\"Calculating the average inter-burst interval:\")\n    print(f\"Average = {equation_str} = {average_interval:.2f}s\")\n    \n    # Round the final answer to two significant figures.\n    # For a number like 10.0, this is already correctly represented.\n    # We use a formatting approach that handles this appropriately.\n    final_answer = f\"{average_interval:.1f}\" if average_interval == 10.0 else f\"{average_interval:.2g}\"\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe average inter-burst interval is {final_answer} s.\")\n    \ncalculate_average_inter_burst_interval()\n```\n<<<10>>>"
