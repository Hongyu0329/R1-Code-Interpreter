    "Based on the unique architecture of the buildings, I can identify the location.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will examine the provided image and its crops for any distinctive architectural features.\n2.  The building slightly to the left of the center has a very recognizable undulating, wavy glass facade.\n3.  I will identify this landmark building. A quick search reveals this to be the GT Tower East.\n4.  I will then confirm the location of the GT Tower East. It is located in the Seocho District of Seoul, South Korea, right next to the famous Gangnam District.\n5.  By confirming the location of this key building, I can confidently identify the city.\n6.  Finally, I will write a Python script to print the name of the city.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the city from the image.\n  The image features several modern skyscrapers. The most distinctive one,\n  located left of the center, is the GT Tower East, known for its wavy facade.\n  This building is a well-known landmark in Seoul, South Korea.\n  Therefore, the city in the picture is Seoul.\n  \"\"\"\n  city = \"Seoul\"\n  print(city)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Seoul>>>"
