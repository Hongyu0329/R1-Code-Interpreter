    "To determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$, we first need to find the Thévenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, seen by the capacitor $C$. The angular cutoff frequency, $\\omega_c$, is then given by the formula $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to find $R_{th}$:\n1.  **Simplify the circuit for Thévenin analysis:** To find $R_{th}$, we need to deactivate the independent input source (`IN`). Assuming it's a voltage source, we short it to ground. This means node $c_0$ is connected to the ground reference. $R_{th}$ is the equivalent resistance looking into the terminal $a_0$ with respect to ground.\n\n2.  **Model the infinite ladder:** The circuit is an infinite ladder. We can see a repeating structure. Let's define $R_{th}$ as the equivalent resistance looking into the start of the ladder, i.e., between terminals $a_0$ and $c_0$ (which is now ground).\n\n3.  **Use the self-similarity property:** Because the ladder is infinite, if we move one step into the ladder to terminals $d_1$ and $c_1$, the resistance of the remaining infinite ladder is still $R_{th}$.\n\n4.  **Set up the equation for $R_{th}$:** Looking into terminals $a_0$ and $c_0$, the resistance is composed of:\n    *   The resistor $r$ between $a_0$ and $d_1$.\n    *   The resistor $r$ between $c_0$ and $c_1$.\n    *   The equivalent resistance between nodes $d_1$ and $c_1$. This resistance is the resistor $r$ (the rung) in parallel with the resistance of the rest of the ladder, which is $R_{th}$.\n    \n    This gives us the equation:\n    $R_{th} = r + r + (r \\parallel R_{th})$\n    $R_{th} = 2r + \\frac{r \\cdot R_{th}}{r + R_{th}}$\n\n5.  **Solve for $R_{th}$:** We rearrange the equation into a quadratic form and solve for $R_{th}$:\n    $R_{th}(r + R_{th}) = 2r(r + R_{th}) + r \\cdot R_{th}$\n    $rR_{th} + R_{th}^2 = 2r^2 + 2rR_{th} + rR_{th}$\n    $R_{th}^2 - 2rR_{th} - 2r^2 = 0$\n    \n    Using the quadratic formula, we find the positive solution for resistance:\n    $R_{th} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\n6.  **Calculate the cutoff frequency:** Finally, we substitute the value of $R_{th}$ into the cutoff frequency formula:\n    $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThe following Python code prints the final derived equation for the cutoff frequency, showing each numerical component.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_cutoff_frequency():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function derives and prints the formula for the cutoff frequency\n    of the given infinite ladder network.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The final derived equation for the cutoff frequency is:\n    # omega_c = 1 / ((1 + sqrt(3)) * r * C)\n    \n    # Extract the numerical values from the formula to print them as requested.\n    numerator = 1\n    term1_in_denominator = 1\n    term2_in_denominator_sqrt = 3\n    \n    print(\"The derived Thévenin equivalent resistance is: R_th = (1 + sqrt(3)) * r\")\n    print(\"\\nThe formula for the angular cutoff frequency is: omega_c = 1 / (R_th * C)\")\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting R_th, the final equation is:\")\n    \n    # Print the final equation with each number explicitly shown.\n    print(f\"omega_c = {numerator} / (({term1_in_denominator} + sqrt({term2_in_denominator_sqrt})) * r * C)\")\n\nsolve_cutoff_frequency()\n```\n<<<$1/((1+sqrt(3))*r*C)$>>>"
