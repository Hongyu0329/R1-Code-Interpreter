    "My plan is to identify the jazz standard by analyzing its key characteristics from the provided sheet music. I will examine the key signature, the initial melodic phrase, and the chord progression.\n\n1.  **Key Signature and Tonality:** The key signature has four flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db), which indicates the key of Ab major or its relative minor, F minor. The first chord is F minor (F-), which establishes the piece in F minor.\n\n2.  **Melodic Analysis:** I will look at the first few notes of the melody. The melody begins with a distinctive phrase: a C, followed by an E-natural, then an Eb. This melodic figure is a strong clue.\n\n3.  **Chord Progression Analysis:** I will examine the chord changes in the first few bars: F- | EÃ¸7 (E half-diminished) | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7. This progression, especially following the initial F minor chord, is very recognizable in the jazz repertoire.\n\n4.  **Synthesis and Identification:** The combination of this specific melodic phrase over this particular set of chord changes points directly to a well-known bebop tune. The melody is that of \"Half Nelson,\" composed by Miles Davis. The underlying chord progression is from the jazz standard \"Lady Bird,\" composed by Tadd Dameron. A tune with a new melody written over an existing chord progression is called a contrafact. Since this lead sheet includes the melody, the title of the piece as written is \"Half Nelson.\"\n\nTherefore, I will identify the title as \"Half Nelson\" and the composer as Miles Davis. I will then create a Python script to output this information.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef identify_jazz_standard():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the jazz standard based on its melodic and harmonic content.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Half Nelson\"\n    composer = \"Miles Davis\"\n    original_composition_title = \"Lady Bird\"\n    original_composition_composer = \"Tadd Dameron\"\n\n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n    print(\"\\n# Note:\")\n    print(\"# This piece is a famous 'contrafact'.\")\n    print(f\"# The melody is '{title}' by {composer}, but it is written over the chord changes of\")\n    print(f\"# the jazz standard '{original_composition_title}' by {original_composition_composer}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    identify_jazz_standard()\n\n```\n<<<Title: Half Nelson, Composer: Miles Davis>>>"
