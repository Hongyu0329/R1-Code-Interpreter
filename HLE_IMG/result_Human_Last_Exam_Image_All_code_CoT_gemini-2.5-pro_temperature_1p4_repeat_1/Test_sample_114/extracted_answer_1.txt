The regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to the inherent electronic control of the [3+2] cycloaddition between a rigid, bicyclic Münchnone intermediate and the unsymmetrical alkyne. Frontier molecular orbital interactions strongly favor one orientation of attack, leading to a single product. Reactions 1 and 2 provide the context for this conclusion. Reaction 1 shows that even an acyclic system gives a highly regioselective cycloaddition. However, the isotopic labeling in Reaction 2 reveals that in the flexible, acyclic Münchnone intermediate, a rapid equilibrium exists that scrambles the N-acetyl and N-alanine derived groups. This scrambling, which is not possible for the conformationally locked bicyclic intermediate in Reaction 3, leads to a 1:1 mixture of labeled products in the acyclic case. Therefore, the high regioselectivity of Reaction 3 arises because its rigid structure prevents the scrambling equilibrium observed in the flexible system, allowing the inherent selectivity of the cycloaddition to be the sole determinant of the product outcome.
