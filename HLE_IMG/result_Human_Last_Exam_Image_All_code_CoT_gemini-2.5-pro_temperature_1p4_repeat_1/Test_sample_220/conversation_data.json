    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the two-dimensional pattern that results from projecting a three-dimensional Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal lattice onto a plane viewed from the [110] direction. Then, we compare this theoretical pattern with the four options provided.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the FCC Lattice:** Characterize the atomic positions in a standard FCC unit cell.\n2.  **Define the Projection:** Understand what viewing along the [110] direction means in terms of projecting 3D coordinates to a 2D plane. The projection plane is perpendicular to the [110] vector and can be spanned by the orthogonal directions `[1,-1,0]` and `[0,0,1]`.\n3.  **Calculate the Projected Pattern:** Project the atomic positions of the FCC lattice onto this 2D plane and identify the resulting repeating pattern.\n4.  **Analyze the Options:** Compare the derived pattern with the patterns shown in images A, B, C, and D.\n5.  **Select the Match:** Identify which image corresponds to the FCC [110] projection.\n\n### Execution:\n\n*   **Step 1 & 2:** An FCC lattice consists of atoms at all points `(x, y, z)` where the coordinates are either all integers, or one is an integer and two are half-integers (e.g., (0.5, 0.5, 0)), assuming a lattice constant of 1. When we view along `[110]`, we project these points onto a plane. The coordinates on this plane will be a function of the original `(x,y,z)`. A convenient choice for the projection axes are `[1,-1,0]` (we'll call this the horizontal axis `x'`) and `[0,0,1]` (the vertical axis `y'`). So, a point `(x,y,z)` projects to a point with coordinates proportional to `(x-y, z)`.\n\n*   **Step 3:** Let's trace where the atoms land on the projection plane:\n    1.  Atoms with integer `z` coordinates (e.g., from the `(0,0,0)` or `(0.5, 0.5, 0)` basis) will also have an integer value for `x-y`. This creates a grid of points at `(integer, integer)` positions.\n    2.  Atoms with half-integer `z` coordinates (e.g., from the `(0.5, 0, 0.5)` basis) will also have a half-integer value for `x-y`. This creates a second grid of points at `(half-integer, half-integer)` positions.\n\n    Combining these two grids results in a **centered rectangular** pattern. The primitive rectangle of this pattern will have atoms at its four corners and one atom in the exact center.\n\n*   **Step 4:** Let's examine the images:\n    *   **A:** Shows a simple rectangular pattern (atoms only at the corners of the repeating rectangles).\n    *   **B:** Shows a different, more complex arrangement.\n    *   **C:** Shows an irregular pattern.\n    *   **D:** Shows a clear **centered rectangular** pattern. For example, you can identify a rectangle formed by atoms at approximately `(0.5, 6)`, `(5.5, 6)`, `(0.5, 12)`, and `(5.5, 12)`. Crucially, there is an atom directly in the center of this rectangle at `(3, 9)`.\n\n*   **Step 5:** The pattern in Image D is a centered rectangle, which matches our derived pattern for an FCC crystal viewed along the [110] direction.\n\nThe following Python code outlines the logic to arrive at this conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_crystal_projection():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning for identifying the FCC [110] projection.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"1. Theoretical Pattern for FCC [110] Projection:\")\n    print(\"   - An FCC lattice has atoms whose coordinates (x,y,z), in units of the lattice constant, have a sum (x+y+z) that is an even integer. This is equivalent to having a basis of atoms at (0,0,0), (0.5,0.5,0), (0.5,0,0.5), (0,0.5,0.5) plus integer translations.\")\n    print(\"   - Projecting along the [110] direction onto a plane spanned by [1,-1,0] and [0,0,1] maps a 3D point (x,y,z) to a 2D point proportional to (x-y, z).\")\n    print(\"   - This projection results in two sets of points on the 2D plane:\")\n    print(\"     - A grid of atoms at (integer, integer) coordinates.\")\n    print(\"     - A second grid of atoms at (half-integer, half-integer) coordinates.\")\n    print(\"   - The combination of these two grids forms a 'centered rectangular' pattern.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"2. Analysis of the Image Options:\")\n    print(\"   - Image A: Shows a simple rectangular pattern.\")\n    print(\"   - Image B: Shows a complex, sheared pattern.\")\n    print(\"   - Image C: Shows an irregular pattern.\")\n    print(\"   - Image D: Shows a clear centered rectangular pattern. A rectangle can be seen with corner atoms and an atom at its center.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"3. Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"   Image D is the only one that matches the theoretically derived centered rectangular pattern for an FCC crystal viewed along the [110] direction.\")\n\n    answer = \"D\"\n    print(f\"\\nThe correct choice is {answer}.\")\n\nsolve_crystal_projection()\n<<<D>>>\n```"
