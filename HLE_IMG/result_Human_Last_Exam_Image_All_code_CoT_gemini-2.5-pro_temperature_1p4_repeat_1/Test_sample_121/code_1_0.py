# The user wants me to identify the best-supported statement.
# My thinking process leads me to choice P as the most accurate and complete answer.

# Plan:
# 1. State the final chosen answer.
# 2. Print the answer in the required format.

# Final Answer Selection:
# P. The left element is most likely a paralog whereas the right element is most likely an ortholog of CG14879,
# because of the number of CDSs is more parsimonious between species for the right element.
# The elements are likely part of separate genes.
# This choice correctly identifies:
#   - The ortholog/paralog relationship (Right=Ortholog, Left=Paralog).
#   - The reason for this assignment (parsimony of CDS number).
#   - The status of the elements as separate genes (supported by RNA-Seq).
