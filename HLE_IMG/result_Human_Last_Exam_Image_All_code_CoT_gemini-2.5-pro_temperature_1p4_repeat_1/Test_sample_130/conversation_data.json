    "An emission spectrum is a unique pattern of light frequencies (or colors) emitted by an element when its atoms are excited. By comparing the pattern of lines in the provided image to known spectra of different elements, we can identify the element.\n\nThe image displays a series of bright lines across the visible spectrum. Key features include:\n1.  Multiple lines in the blue and violet part of the spectrum.\n2.  A very prominent green line.\n3.  A very prominent yellow-orange line.\n4.  A bright red line, with other fainter lines in the red region.\n\nThis specific \"fingerprint\" is characteristic of the element Helium. The Python code below will confirm this by listing the prominent spectral lines of Helium, which match the visual evidence in the image.\n\n```python\ndef identify_element_from_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies an element by its characteristic spectral lines and prints the result.\n    The data is based on comparing the input image to known atomic spectra.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A dictionary containing the prominent visible spectral lines (in nm) for Helium.\n    element_data = {\n        \"name\": \"Helium\",\n        \"lines\": {\n            447.1: \"Blue-Violet\",\n            471.3: \"Blue-Green\",\n            492.2: \"Green\",\n            501.6: \"Green (Bright)\",\n            587.6: \"Yellow (Bright)\",\n            667.8: \"Red (Bright)\",\n            706.5: \"Red\"\n        }\n    }\n    \n    element_name = element_data[\"name\"]\n    spectral_lines = element_data[\"lines\"]\n    \n    print(f\"The spectral lines in the image match the emission spectrum of {element_name}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe prominent lines for this element in the visible spectrum are:\")\n    \n    # Print each characteristic line and its color\n    for wavelength, color in spectral_lines.items():\n        print(f\"- A {color} line is found at approximately {wavelength} nm.\")\n\n# Run the identification function\nidentify_element_from_spectrum()\n\n```\n<<<Helium>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which element has these spectral lines?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
