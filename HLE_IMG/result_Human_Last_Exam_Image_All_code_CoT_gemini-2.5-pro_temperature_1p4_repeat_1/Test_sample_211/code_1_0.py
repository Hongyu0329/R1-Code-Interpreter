# The task is to identify the sociable weaver from a set of images.
# By carefully comparing the unique feather patterns, specifically the scalloped
# markings on the back and the striped pattern on the wing feathers,
# we can find the matching individual.

# 1. Analyze the target bird's feather pattern. It has a distinct arrangement
#    of light-edged feathers creating a "scaly" look on the back.
# 2. Observe the pattern of the longer flight feathers on the wing.
# 3. Compare these patterns with each of the options A through I.
# 4. Image C shows the same individual. The scalloped pattern on the back,
#    the alignment of the wing feathers, the posture, and the lighting
#    conditions are a very strong match to the target image.

# The correct option is C.
