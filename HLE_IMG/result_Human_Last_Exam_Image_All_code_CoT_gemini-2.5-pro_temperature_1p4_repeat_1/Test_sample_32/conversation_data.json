    "The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that helps distinguish them at a glance is the **seta (the stalk that supports the capsule)**.\n\n*   In ***Grimmia montana***, the seta is very short and **straight**, holding the capsule erect and immersed or emergent among the upper leaves.\n*   In ***Grimmia curviseta***, the seta is distinctly **curved or arcuate** (like a swan's neck), causing the capsule to be nodding or hanging down beside the stem.\n\nTherefore, by simply observing whether the capsule is held upright on a straight stalk or nodding on a curved stalk, you can easily tell these two species apart when they have sporophytes. The species in the image, with its upright capsules on seemingly straight setae, is consistent with *Grimmia montana*.\n\n<<<The key distinguishing feature is the seta (stalk): it is short and **straight** in *Grimmia montana*, but strongly **curved** in *Grimmia curviseta*, causing the capsule to nod or hang down.>>>"
