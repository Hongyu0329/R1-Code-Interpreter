    This function identifies the correct image.
    Based on visual analysis, the key features to match are:
    1. Horn Shape: The target has long, lyre-shaped horns with a specific curve and twist.
    2. Spot Pattern: A distinct cluster of white spots is visible on the rear flank.
    3. Ear Notch: A very clear notch is present in the middle of the top edge of the target's left ear.

    Comparing these features:
    - Image A: Horns are smaller, likely a younger animal.
    - Image B: Horns and spot pattern are similar, but the ear notch is not visible.
    - Image C: Poor image quality and different horn shape.
    - Image D: The horn shape, the flank spot pattern, and the unique ear notch all perfectly match the target.
    - Image E: Different horn shape, different spot pattern, and a device on the leg not seen on the target.
    - Image F: Partially obscured, but what's visible doesn't provide as strong a match as D.

    Image D is the only one where all key identifiers, especially the definitive ear notch, match the target.
