    "My analysis of the provided image of the coat of arms leads me to the following conclusion:\n\n1.  **Shield Analysis:** The central element is a shield divided horizontally (a style known in heraldry as \"per fess\"). The top half is blue (azure) and contains a yellow/gold crescent moon (or). The bottom half is yellow/gold (or) and features a black crab (sable).\n2.  **External Elements:** Above the shield is a crown, and the shield is flanked by an olive branch on the left and an oak branch on the right.\n3.  **Heraldic Search:** A search for a coat of arms with a blue and gold field, a crescent moon, and a crab points directly to a specific municipality. The combination of these elements is quite unique.\n4.  **Identification:** The coat of arms belongs to the town of **Hrvatska Kostajnica** in Croatia. While the crown and the specific wreath in the image might be an artistic interpretation, the design of the shield itself is a clear match.\n\nBased on this, I will write a simple Python script to print the name of the city.\n\n```python\ndef find_city_by_coat_of_arms():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the city corresponding\n    to the described coat of arms.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The coat of arms in the image features a shield divided horizontally,\n    # blue over gold, with a gold crescent moon in the top section\n    # and a black crab in the bottom section.\n    \n    # This specific design matches the coat of arms of a town in Croatia.\n    city_name = \"Hrvatska Kostajnica\"\n    \n    print(f\"The coat of arms with a crescent moon over a crab on a blue and gold shield is very similar to that of the city:\")\n    print(city_name)\n\nfind_city_by_coat_of_arms()\n```\n<<<Hrvatska Kostajnica>>>"
