# The analysis pairs each configuration (1-8) with a displacement plot (A-H)
# based on the number and shape of lobes on the driving roller.

# A -> 8: Plot A shows 3 oscillations per revolution, matching the 3 lobes of roller 8.
# B -> 2: Plot B shows 6 high-amplitude oscillations, matching the 6-lobed roller 2 driving a sharp-cornered Reuleaux triangle.
# C -> 3: Plot C shows 2 oscillations per revolution, matching the 2 (asymmetric) lobes of roller 3.
# D -> 4: Plot D shows 4 extremely sharp oscillations, matching the spiky 4-lobed roller 4.
# E -> 7: Plot E shows 5 complex oscillations, matching the 5-lobed roller 7 with its secondary bumps.
# F -> 5: Plot F shows 6 low-amplitude oscillations, matching the smooth 6-lobed roller 5 driving another smooth roller.
# G -> 6: Plot G shows 4 smooth, regular oscillations, matching the smooth 4-lobed roller 6 driving an ellipse.
# H -> 1: Plot H shows 4 complex oscillations, matching the 4-lobed roller 1 driving a shape with concave sides.

# The final answer is the sequence of roller numbers for plots A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.
