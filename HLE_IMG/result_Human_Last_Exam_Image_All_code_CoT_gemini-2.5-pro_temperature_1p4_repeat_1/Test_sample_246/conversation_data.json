    "Here is my plan to answer your question.\n1.  First, I will analyze the image to identify any signs of insect presence or influence on the plant.\n2.  The most prominent feature is the large, white, fuzzy ball on the twig. I will identify this structure.\n3.  Based on the identification, I will determine what kind of insect created it.\n4.  Finally, I will explain the life cycle of this insect to determine where it lays its eggs, which is the direct cause of the structure seen in the image.\n5.  I will then write a Python script to print out this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef explain_insect_activity():\n  \"\"\"\n  Identifies the insect activity in the image and explains where the eggs are laid.\n  \"\"\"\n  print(\"Yes, there is evidence of insect activity in this image.\")\n  print(\"\\nThe white, fuzzy, spiky ball on the twig is an 'oak wool sower gall.'\")\n  print(\"\\nThis gall is an abnormal growth produced by the oak tree. It is caused by a tiny insect, a cynipid gall wasp.\")\n  print(\"\\nThe female wasp lays its eggs inside the woody tissue of the twig (specifically, in a developing bud). The chemicals injected by the wasp and the presence of the larvae cause the tree to form this complex gall structure around them.\")\n  print(\"\\nSo, to answer the question directly: the wasp lays its eggs inside the twig, which then stimulates the growth of the gall seen in the picture.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n  explain_insect_activity()\n<<<Yes, the gall is evidence of insect activity. The wasp that caused it laid its eggs inside the twig of the oak tree.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Is there evidence of insect activity in this image?
