    "Here is my plan to solve this music theory problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the key signature:** The key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭), which corresponds to either C minor or E♭ major. Given the context of the \"Pathetique\" Sonata, the home key of this movement is C minor.\n2.  **Locate measure 30:** I will find measure 28, the start of the second system on the page, and count two measures forward to locate measure 30.\n3.  **Analyze the notes in measure 30:** I will identify all the notes being played in both the left and right hands within that measure.\n    *   **Left Hand:** The chord played is G, B♮, and D.\n    *   **Right Hand:** The arpeggiated figures consist of the notes E♮, G, B♮, and D. The E♮ is a passing tone. The primary harmonic notes are G, B♮, and D.\n4.  **Identify the chord:** The collection of notes (G, B♮, D) forms a G major triad.\n5.  **Determine the chord's function in the key of C minor:**\n    *   The root of the chord is G.\n    *   In the key of C minor, G is the fifth scale degree (the dominant).\n    *   A diatonic chord on the fifth degree of C natural minor would be G minor (G-B♭-D).\n    *   However, the presence of B♮ (the raised 7th degree, or leading tone) makes the chord a G major triad. This is the standard dominant chord in a minor key.\n6.  **Assign the Roman numeral:** A major triad built on the fifth degree of the scale is represented by the uppercase Roman numeral \"V\".\n\nI will now create a Python script to print this analysis and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_measure_30():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, 1st movement,\n    to determine the correct Roman numeral.\n    \"\"\"\n    key = \"C minor\"\n    measure = 30\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify the notes in the measure.\n    left_hand_notes = [\"G\", \"B-natural\", \"D\"]\n    right_hand_notes = [\"G\", \"B-natural\", \"D\"] # Harmonic tones\n    chord_notes = sorted(list(set(left_hand_notes + right_hand_notes)))\n    \n    # Step 2: Identify the chord and its quality.\n    chord_root = \"G\"\n    chord_quality = \"Major\"\n    chord_name = f\"{chord_root} {chord_quality}\"\n    \n    # Step 3: Relate the chord to the key of C minor.\n    scale_degree = 5\n    \n    # Step 4: Determine the Roman numeral.\n    # In music theory, a major chord built on the 5th degree (the dominant)\n    # is represented by an uppercase Roman numeral 'V'.\n    # This is standard practice in minor keys, using the raised 7th (leading tone)\n    # from the harmonic minor scale.\n    roman_numeral = \"V\"\n    \n    print(f\"Analysis of Beethoven 'Pathetique' Sonata, 1st mvt., measure {measure}:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"1.
