    # Step 1: Analyze the starting material's key stereocenter.
    # The starting cyclobutene has a quaternary carbon (C4) with a methyl group (Me) shown as a wedge (up)
    # and a methoxy group (OMe) shown as a dash (down).
    # This stereocenter is preserved throughout the reaction sequence.
    # Therefore, we only consider products that have this Me(up)/OMe(down) configuration.

    # B: Me(down), OMe(up) -> Incorrect

    # D: Me(up), OMe(down) -> Correct

    # Step 2: The conrotatory ring-opening of the chiral starting material yields two diastereomeric dienes.
    # Each of these dienes undergoes an endo Diels-Alder reaction.
    # This results in two final products that are diastereomers of each other.
    
    # Step 3: Identify the unique structures among the filtered options.
    # Let's compare the structures of A, D, E, and H.
    
    # Compare A and H:
    # A: Cq[Me(up), OMe(down)], C(CO2Et) is down (dash).
    # H: Cq[Me(up), OMe(down)], C(CO2Et) is down (dash).
    # Structures A and H are identical.
    
    # Compare D and E:
    # D: Cq[Me(up), OMe(down)], C(CO2Et) is up (wedge).
    # E: Cq[Me(up), OMe(down)], C(CO2Et) is up (wedge).
    # Structures D and E are identical.
    
    # Therefore, the reaction produces two unique diastereomeric structures.
    # One is represented by drawings A and H.
    # The other is represented by drawings D and E.
    
    # The two products are represented by the pair (A, D), or (A, E), or (H, D), or (H, E).
    # We will choose the pair 'A' and 'D' as the representatives.
