    "An ECG analysis involves a systematic approach to interpreting the electrical activity of the heart. I will use a Python script to outline the steps and reasoning used to reach the diagnosis for the provided ECG.\n\n### Step-by-step ECG Interpretation Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze Rhythm:** Determine if the time between consecutive QRS complexes (R-R interval) is regular or irregular.\n2.  **Analyze Heart Rate:** Calculate the ventricular rate.\n3.  **Analyze QRS Complex:** Measure the duration of the QRS complex to determine if it's narrow or wide.\n4.  **Analyze P waves:** Look for atrial activity and its relationship to the QRS complexes.\n5.  **Synthesize Findings and Formulate Differential Diagnosis:** Combine the above findings to create a list of possible diagnoses.\n6.  **Evaluate and Conclude:** Compare the ECG features against the criteria for each possible diagnosis to arrive at the most likely answer.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the step-by-step diagnosis of the provided ECG.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the ECG characteristics\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # Rhythm Analysis\n    rhythm_rr_interval = \"Irregularly irregular\"\n    print(f\"Rhythm: The R-R intervals are variable, indicating an '{rhythm_rr_interval}' rhythm.
