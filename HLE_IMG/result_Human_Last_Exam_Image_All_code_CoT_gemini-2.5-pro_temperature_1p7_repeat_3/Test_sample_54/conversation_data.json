    "Here is a step-by-step plan to identify the reagents A and B:\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction step (1 → 2):**\n    *   I will compare the molecular structure of the reactant (1) and the product (2).\n    *   The reactant (1) is a polycyclic aromatic oxonium salt. It contains three rings bridged by oxygen atoms.\n    *   The product (2) has one of the oxygen bridges replaced by a nitrogen atom, which is further substituted with an amino group (-NH2). This is a transformation from a pyrylium-like system to an N-aminopyridinium-like system.\n    *   This specific transformation is characteristic of the reaction of pyrylium salts with hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂). Therefore, Reagent A is hydrazine.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction step (2 → 3):**\n    *   I will compare the molecular structure of the reactant (2) and the product (3).\n    *   Two distinct changes occur in this step:\n        1.  A second oxygen bridge is replaced by a nitrogen atom, which is substituted with a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃). This indicates the use of a nucleophile containing a propyl group and a nitrogen atom.\n        2.  The N-amino group (-NH₂) present in compound 2 is converted to a simple N-H group in compound 3. This process is a deamination.\n    *   The most logical reagent to achieve the first change is propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NH₂).\n    *   The second change (deamination) is a known side reaction for N-aminopyridinium salts, which can occur upon heating in the presence of a primary amine like propylamine.\n    *   Therefore, Reagent B is propylamine.\n\n3.  **Create the Python Script:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, I will create a Python script that clearly states the identity of reagents A and B and provides an explanation for each. The script will reference the numbered compounds in the reaction scheme to fulfill all parts of the request.\n\n```python\ndef identify_reagents():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the reagents A and B in the provided reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    reagent_A = {\n        \"name\": \"Hydrazine\",\n        \"formula\": \"H₂N-NH₂\"\n    }\n\n    reagent_B = {\n        \"name\": \"Propylamine (or n-Propylamine)\",\n        \"formula\": \"CH₃CH₂CH₂-NH₂\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Reagent Identification ---\")\n\n    # Explanation for Reagent A\n    print(\"\\n[Step 1]: Conversion of Compound 1 to Compound 2\")\n    print(f\"Reagent A is: {reagent_A['name']} ({reagent_A['formula']})\")\n    print(\"Explanation:\")\n    print(\"The transformation from compound 1 to 2 involves the replacement of an oxygen atom in one of the heterocyclic rings with a nitrogen atom that is bonded to an amino group (-NH₂).\")\n    print(\"This reaction is a characteristic conversion of a pyrylium-type salt into an N-aminopyridinium-type salt, which is achieved by using hydrazine as the reagent.\")\n\n    # Explanation for Reagent B\n    print(\"\\n[Step 2]: Conversion of Compound 2 to Compound 3\")\n    print(f\"Reagent B is: {reagent_B['name']} ({reagent_B['formula']})\")\n    print(\"Explanation:\")\n    print(\"The transformation from compound 2 to 3 involves two changes:\")\n    print(\"  1. A second oxygen atom is replaced by a nitrogen atom bearing a propyl group.\")\n    print(\"  2. The N-NH₂ group is reduced to an N-H group (deamination).\")\n    print(\"Propylamine provides the N-propyl group for the ring substitution. The deamination reaction can occur concurrently under the reaction conditions (e.g., heating).\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Summary ---\")\n    print(\"Reagent A: Hydrazine\")\n    print(\"Reagent B: Propylamine\")\n\nidentify_reagents()\n```\n<<<A is Hydrazine, B is Propylamine>>>"
