    This function identifies the correct image.
    
    By analyzing the unique features of the nyala, we can find the match.
    - Horn Shape: The horns in the target image have a specific curve and length.
    - Stripe Pattern: The white stripes on the body are a key identifier.
    - Spot Pattern: The most unique feature is the specific arrangement of white spots on the rear flank. The target has a cluster of spots and a single, isolated spot above the cluster.
    
    Comparing the options:
    - A: Different horns (younger animal).
    - B: Similar, but the spot pattern is not a perfect match from this angle.
    - C: Poor image quality and different angle.
    - D: The horn shape, stripe pattern, and especially the unique spot pattern on the flank are an identical match to the target.
    - E: The spot pattern is different (more linear).
    - F: Obscured by bushes.
    
    The correct image is D.
