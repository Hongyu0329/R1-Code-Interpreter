    The bryophyte in the image displays the following key features:
    1.  The leaves are small, overlapping, and densely packed along the stem.
    2.  The stems have a distinct braided or plaited appearance.
    3.  The leaves are falcate-secund, meaning they are sickle-shaped and curve uniformly to one side.
    
    These characteristics are the hallmark of the moss genus known as Plait-moss.
