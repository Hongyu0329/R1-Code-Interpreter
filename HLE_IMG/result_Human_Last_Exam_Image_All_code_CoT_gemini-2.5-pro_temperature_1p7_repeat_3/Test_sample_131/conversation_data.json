    "The provided image is a chemical structure of a tetracyclic alkaloid. My plan is to identify this compound by analyzing its unique structural features, such as the ring system and functional groups, and then provide its common name.\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure**: The molecule has four fused six-membered rings. This is a tetracyclic system.\n2.  **Identify key functional groups**: There are two nitrogen atoms, characteristic of an alkaloid. One of the rings contains a carbonyl group (C=O) adjacent to a nitrogen atom, which forms a lactam (a cyclic amide).\n3.  **Recognize the skeleton**: This specific tetracyclic framework with two nitrogen atoms is characteristic of quinolizidine alkaloids, particularly the matrine-type.\n4.  **Identify the specific compound**: The structure shown, including the stereochemistry (the orientation of atoms in space indicated by wedged and dashed bonds) and the presence of the lactam at this specific position, corresponds to the alkaloid known as **Matrine**. It is commonly found in plants of the *Sophora* genus.\n5.  **Create a script to output the name**: I will now write a simple Python script that prints the identified name of the compound.\n\n```python\n# The chemical structure provided is that of a well-known alkaloid.\n# This script identifies and prints the common name of the compound.\n\n# The compound has a tetracyclic quinolizidine skeleton and a lactam functional group.\n# Based on these features and the specific stereochemistry, the compound is identified.\ncompound_name = \"Matrine\"\n\nprint(f\"The name of this alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n```\n<<<Matrine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
