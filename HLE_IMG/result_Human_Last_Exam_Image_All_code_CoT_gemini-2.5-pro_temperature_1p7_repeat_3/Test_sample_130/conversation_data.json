    "To identify the element from its spectral lines, we can compare the pattern of lines in the image to the known emission spectra of different chemical elements. Each element has a unique \"fingerprint\" or spectral pattern.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Observed Spectrum:** The image displays a complex emission spectrum with multiple distinct lines across the entire visible range:\n    *   Several lines in the red and orange part.\n    *   A very prominent bright yellow line.\n    *   Multiple bright lines in the green and cyan (blue-green) region.\n    *   A cluster of lines in the blue and violet region.\n\n2.  **Compare with Known Spectra:** We will compare this pattern to the spectra of common elements.\n    *   **Hydrogen:** The visible spectrum of Hydrogen (the Balmer series) is simple, showing only four main lines (one red, one blue-green, one blue-violet, and one violet). This does not match the complex pattern in the image.\n    *   **Sodium:** The spectrum of Sodium is dominated by a very strong doublet (two lines very close together) in the yellow part of the spectrum. The observed spectrum is much more complex.\n    *   **Helium:** The spectrum of Helium is known to be complex, with many bright lines distributed across the visible range, including a prominent red line (~668 nm), a bright yellow line (~588 nm), and several other lines in the green and blue parts of the spectrum. This pattern is a strong match for the spectrum shown in the image.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Based on the unique and complex pattern of lines, the element is identified as Helium.\n\nThe following Python code simulates this identification process.\n\n```python\ndef identify_element_from_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies an element by comparing its spectral features to a known database.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Simplified database of prominent spectral lines (in nm) for some elements.\n    element_spectra = {\n        'Hydrogen': {\n            'description': \"Four prominent lines in the visible spectrum (Balmer series).\",\n            'lines': [656.3, 486.1, 434.1, 410.2]\n        },\n        'Sodium': {\n            'description': \"Dominated by a strong yellow doublet.\",\n            'lines': [589.0, 589.6]\n        },\n        'Helium': {\n            'description': \"Complex spectrum with multiple bright lines across the visible range.\",\n            'lines': [667.8, 587.6, 501.6, 471.3, 447.1]\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Features observed from the image.\n    observed_spectrum_features = {\n        'complexity': 'high',\n        'colors': ['red', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'violet']\n    }\n\n    # Perform the identification by comparing patterns.\n    # The observed spectrum is complex and has lines in all major color regions.\n    # This rules out Hydrogen and Sodium.
