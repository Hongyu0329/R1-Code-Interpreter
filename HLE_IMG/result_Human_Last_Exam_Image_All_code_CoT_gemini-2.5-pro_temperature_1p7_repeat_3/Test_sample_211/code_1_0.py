# The task is to re-identify a specific Sociable weaver bird.
# By comparing the detailed feather patterns on the back of the birds,
# we can find a unique match.

# Step 1: Analyze the pattern on the target bird's back.
# The bird has a distinct scalloped pattern. A key feature for identification
# is a small, unique disruption or a slightly darker patch in the pattern
# on its upper back.

# Step 2: Compare this unique feature with all the options provided.
# - Image A has a different pattern contrast.
# - Image B has a finer pattern.
# - Image D is at a different angle, hiding the key area.
# - Images E, F, G, H, and I lack the specific pattern disruption seen on the target.
# - Image C, however, has the exact same small pattern irregularity on its upper back.
#   The overall posture, coloration, and lighting also match the target perfectly.

# Step 3: Conclude the identification.
# The bird in Image C is the same individual as the target bird.

correct_image = 'C'

# Step 4: Print the final answer.
print(f"The image showing the same bird as the target is: {correct_image}")
