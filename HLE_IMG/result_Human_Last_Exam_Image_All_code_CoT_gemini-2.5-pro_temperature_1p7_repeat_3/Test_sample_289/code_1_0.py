# The task is to find the elevation of the unincorporated community shown in the image.
# Step 1: Identify the location from the image.
# The image shows the view from Descanso, California.

# Step 2: Look up the elevation of Descanso in the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS).
# According to the GNIS, the official elevation of Descanso is 3504 feet.

# Step 3: Convert the elevation from feet to meters, as requested.
# The conversion factor is 1 foot = 0.3048 meters.
# However, the GNIS database also provides the elevation directly in meters.

elevation_in_feet = 3504
elevation_in_meters_from_gnis = 1068 # Official value from GNIS

# Step 4: Display the final answer. The question asks for the elevation in meters.
