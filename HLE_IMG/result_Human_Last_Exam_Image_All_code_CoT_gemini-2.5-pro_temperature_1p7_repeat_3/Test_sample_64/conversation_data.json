    "This image displays a sequence of three micrographs (L, M, and N) showing a biological process over time. My task is to identify this process.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking:**\n1.  **Analyze Image L:** This panel shows an elongated, tube-like cell structure, which is characteristic of a fungal hypha or a similar filamentous organism. It has internal cross-walls (septa). An arrowhead points to a specific location on the side of the hypha.\n2.  **Analyze Image M:** This panel shows the same hypha at a later time. At the location marked by the arrowhead in the previous panel, a small bulge or swelling has formed. This indicates the beginning of a new growth process.\n3.  **Analyze Image N:** In this final panel, the bulge seen in M has grown and elongated, forming a new, distinct side branch. The original hypha has also bent slightly. The arrowhead now points to the junction of the new branch.\n4.  **Synthesize the observations:** The sequence L -> M -> N clearly documents the formation of a lateral branch from a pre-existing hyphal filament.\n5.  **Identify the biological term:** This process is known as **hyphal branching**. It is a fundamental mechanism for fungi to expand and form a complex network called a mycelium.\n\nI will now write a Python script to print this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef describe_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function describes the biological process shown in the image sequence.\n  \"\"\"\n  process_description = (\n      \"The process depicted in the image is hyphal branching. The sequence of images (L, M, N) shows a time-lapse of a fungal hypha. \"\n      \"In panel L, a mature hypha is shown. In panel M, a new branch begins to initiate as a small bulge from the side of the main filament. \"\n      \"By panel N, this bulge has grown out into a distinct lateral branch. This is the primary way fungi expand to form a mycelial network.\"\n  )\n  print(process_description)\n\ndescribe_process()\n```\n<<<Hyphal branching>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
