    "Based on the visual characteristics of the epiphytic species in the image, I can identify its genus. The organism displays a distinctive dark, flattened, and repeatedly forked branching pattern, forming a net-like mat on the tree bark. This morphology is characteristic of a thalloid liverwort known as a forked veilwort.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print the genus name.\n\n```python\ndef identify_genus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the genus of the epiphytic species based on visual analysis.\n    The species is a thalloid liverwort with a characteristic forked branching pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    genus = \"Metzgeria\"\n    print(f\"The genus of the epiphytic species is: {genus}\")\n\nidentify_genus()\n```\n<<<Metzgeria>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the genus of the epiphytic species in this image? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
