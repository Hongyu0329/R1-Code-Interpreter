    "To determine the Roman numeral for the circled chord in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Key:** The key signature has one flat (B♭), and the title indicates the piece is in D minor. The tonic chord is D minor (D-F-A).\n\n2.  **Identify the Notes in the Chord:** The circled chord occurs on the second beat of measure 8.\n    *   In the right hand (treble clef), we have the notes A and C.\n    *   In the left hand (bass clef), we have the notes F♯ and D.\n    *   Combining these notes, we have D, F♯, A, and C.\n\n3.  **Determine the Chord's Identity:** When we stack these notes in thirds, we get D - F♯ - A - C. This spells out a Dominant 7th chord with D as the root (D7).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Chord's Function:** We need to figure out how a D7 chord functions in the key of D minor.\n    *   A D7 chord naturally resolves to a G chord (either major or minor).\n    *   In the key of D minor, the G minor chord is the subdominant (iv).\n    *   Therefore, the D7 chord is functioning as a \"secondary dominant\" that leads to the subdominant. We call this the \"dominant of the subdominant,\" written as V⁷/iv.\n\n5.  **Determine the Inversion:** The lowest-sounding note (the bass note) is F♯.\n    *   The root of the D7 chord is D.\n    *   F♯ is the third of the D7 chord.\n    *   When the third of a seventh chord is in the bass, the chord is in first inversion. In Roman numeral analysis, this is indicated by the figured bass symbol ⁶⁄₅.\n\n6.  **Combine for the Final Answer:** Combining the function (V⁷/iv) with the inversion (first inversion, ⁶⁄₅) gives us the complete Roman numeral.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_chord():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the specified chord from Mozart's Fantasy in D minor and provides the Roman numeral.\n    \"\"\"\n    key = \"D minor\"\n    notes_in_chord = [\"D\", \"F#\", \"A\", \"C\"]\n    chord_identity = \"D dominant 7th (D7)\"\n    root = \"D\"\n    bass_note = \"F#\"\n    third_of_chord = \"F#\"\n    \n    target_chord = \"G minor\"\n    function_in_key = \"subdominant (iv)\"\n    \n    analysis_steps = [\n        \"1.
