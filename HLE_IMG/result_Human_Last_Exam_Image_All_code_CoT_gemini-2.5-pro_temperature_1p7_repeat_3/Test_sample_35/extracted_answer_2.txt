The S100B protein exhibits a strong affinity for the Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE), specifically its extracellular V, C1, and C2 domains. It could be used as a prognostic marker because its levels directly correlate with the activation of pathways leading to neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration, thereby predicting the severity and progression of the disorder.
