    "This icon is a fresco depicting the Prophet Moses.\n\nIt was painted in 1378 by the renowned Byzantine artist Theophanes the Greek. This specific fresco is located in the Church of the Transfiguration on Ilyina Street in Veliky Novgorod, Russia.\n\nTheophanes the Greek was a highly influential artist who moved from Constantinople to Russia, bringing a unique and expressive style characterized by bold brushwork and a limited, yet powerful, color palette.\n\nIn Orthodox iconography, the Prophet Moses is a significant Old Testament figure, revered as the one who received the Law from God. He is often depicted, as seen here, as an elderly man with a long white beard, holding a scroll which represents his writings or the divine law. While sometimes shown with the Tablets of the Law, the scroll is also a common attribute. This portrayal is part of a larger series of frescoes within the church.\n\n<<<D>>>"
