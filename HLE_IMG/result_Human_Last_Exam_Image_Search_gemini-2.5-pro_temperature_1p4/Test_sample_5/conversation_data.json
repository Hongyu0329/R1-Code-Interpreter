    "This is a piano arrangement of \"U.N. Owen Was Her?\", which is the theme music for the character Flandre Scarlet from the video game *Touhou Koumakyou: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil*.\n\nThe piece is well-known for its memorable and catchy melody, which can be heard in the first few measures of the sheet music, as well as its high-speed, complex structure which is reflected in the dense passages of sixteenth notes. This has led to numerous arrangements and remixes, including many difficult piano versions like the one shown.\n\n<<<U.N. Owen Was Her?>>>"
