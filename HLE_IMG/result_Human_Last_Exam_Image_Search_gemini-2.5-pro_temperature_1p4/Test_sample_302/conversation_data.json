    "The characters on the seal are written in a traditional Chinese script known as seal script (篆书, zhuànshū). They are read from top to bottom and from right to left.\n\nThe characters are:\n*   **Top Right:** 寧 (níng) - quiet, tranquil\n*   **Bottom Right:** 靜 (jìng) - still, calm\n*   **Top Left:** 致 (zhì) - to achieve, to extend to\n*   **Bottom Left:** 遠 (yuǎn) - far, distant\n\nTogether, they form the well-known Chinese idiom **寧靜致遠 (níng jìng zhì yuǎn)**.\n\nThis phrase originates from a 3rd-century text, \"Admonition to His Son,\" written by the famed statesman and strategist Zhuge Liang. The meaning is often translated as \"tranquility yields transcendence\" or \"a quiet and peaceful mind leads to the achievement of long-term goals.\" It extols the virtues of inner peace and deep reflection as a path to profound insight and lasting accomplishment.\n\nThe simplified Chinese characters are **宁静致远**.\n\n<<<宁静致远>>>"
