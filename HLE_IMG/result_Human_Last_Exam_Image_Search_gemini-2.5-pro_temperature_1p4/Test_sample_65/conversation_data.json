    "The bryophyte in the image belongs to the genus *Ptilidium*.\n\nThis identification is based on the highly characteristic appearance of the plant, which is a type of leafy liverwort. The name *Ptilidium* is derived from the Greek word \"ptilidion,\" meaning \"small feather,\" which aptly describes the appearance created by its finely divided leaves with fringed, ciliate edges. This feathery or \"hirsute\" look is a key identifier for the genus.\n\nThe genus *Ptilidium* includes three species: *Ptilidium californicum*, *Ptilidium ciliare*, and *Ptilidium pulcherrimum*. These are commonly known as fringeworts. The plants grow in dense mats, and their distinctive overlapping, deeply divided leaves give them a \"flossy\" or braided texture. This genus is found in boreal regions across Europe, Asia, and North America.\n\n<<<Ptilidium>>>"
