    "Here is the biological sex for each of the three pairs of insects:\n\n*   **Pair A (Left: Female, Right: Male):** The bee on the left has a distinctly conical, pointed abdomen, which is characteristic of a female cuckoo bee (*Coelioxys*). Females use this sharp abdomen to pierce the nests of other bees to lay their eggs. The bee on the right has a blunter abdomen tip with spines, which is typical for a male of this genus.\n*   **Pair B (Left: Female, Right: Male):** These are paper wasps, likely from the genus *Polistes*. The wasp on the right displays antennae with distinctly curled or hooked tips, a key characteristic of males. The wasp on the left has straight antennae. In many paper wasp species, males also have yellower or squarer faces than the darker, more triangular faces of females.\n*   **Pair C (Left: Male, Right: Female):** The bee on the left is a male long-horned bee, identified by its exceptionally long antennae, a feature that gives the group its name. The bee on the right is a female leafcutter bee. This is evident from the dense patch of pollen-collecting hairs, known as a scopa, on the underside of her abdomen. Male bees do not collect pollen.\n\n<<<4, 4, 3>>>"
