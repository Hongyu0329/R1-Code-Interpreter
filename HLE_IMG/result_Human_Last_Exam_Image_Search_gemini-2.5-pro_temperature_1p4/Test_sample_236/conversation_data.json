    "The insect depicted in the center of the image is a Goldenrod Soldier Beetle. Its scientific name is *Chauliognathus pensylvanicus*.\n\nThis beetle is also known as the Pennsylvania leatherwing or the goldenrod leatherwing. It is commonly found in North America, particularly in the Midwest of the United States. As its name suggests, it is often seen on goldenrod flowers, as well as other late-summer blooming plants like Queen Anne's lace and milkweed.\n\nKey features for identification include its orange-colored body with black markings, a black head, legs, and antennae. It's about half an inch long. A distinctive characteristic of this beetle is its soft wing covers, or elytra, which is why it's also called a \"leatherwing\".\n\n<<<Chauliognathus pensylvanicus>>>"
