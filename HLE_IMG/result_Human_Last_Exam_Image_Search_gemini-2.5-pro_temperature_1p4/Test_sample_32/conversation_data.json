    "The primary difference in the sporophyte that allows for a quick distinction between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* lies in the seta, the stalk that supports the capsule.\n\nIn *Grimmia montana*, the sporophyte features a **straight seta**, which holds the capsule in an erect position.\n\nConversely, *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by an **arcuate seta**, meaning the stalk is curved or bent. This curvature gives the capsule a different orientation compared to the straight presentation in *Grimmia montana*. This distinct feature of the seta is the most apparent characteristic to differentiate the two species when observing their sporophytes.\n\n<<<The main difference is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a curved or arcuate seta.>>>"
