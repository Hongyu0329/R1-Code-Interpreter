    "The solution to the riddle is \"Daguerreotype.\" Here is a breakdown of the clues:\n\nThe first clue, \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019,\" is a play on words. The \"X Y\" refers to a Daguerreotype, which is a type of picture. The image provided is therefore a literal representation of the clueâ€”a \"picture\" is \"pictured.\" The specific details of the event, the date, and the people shown are misdirection.\n\nThe second clue, \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts,\" refers to the historical photographic process known as the Daguerreotype. This process, invented by Louis Daguerre and introduced in 1839, used mercury vapor to develop the image on a silver-plated copper sheet. The fumes from the heated mercury were highly toxic to the photographers, and this dangerous method has been largely abandoned.\n\n<<<Daguerreotype>>>"
