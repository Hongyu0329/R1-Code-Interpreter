    "The product featured in the advertisement is from the French cosmetics company **Bourjois**.\n\nDuring World War II, the British government and various companies promoted the idea that maintaining one's appearance was a patriotic duty for women contributing to the war effort. Advertisements from this era framed makeup and beauty products not as luxuries, but as essential tools for boosting morale. The campaign suggested that using cosmetics helped women who were taking on traditionally male roles in factories and other war-related industries to preserve their sense of femininity and confidence, framing it as a way to \"overcome the inherent limitations\" of being a woman in such a demanding environment.\n\nThe advertisement in the image, \"Women are winning the War - of Freedom,\" is part of this broader narrative that connected beauty with patriotism and morale on the home front. Bourjois, a company with a distinctively French name, was one of the brands that aligned its advertising with this message, often featuring its \"Evening in Paris\" line of products.\n\n<<<Bourjois>>>"
