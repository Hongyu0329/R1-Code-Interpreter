    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip, we must first understand the calibration of the ECG paper.\n\n*   **Paper Speed:** The strip indicates a speed of 25 mm/sec.\n*   **Grid Calibration:**\n    *   Each small square on the grid represents 1 mm.\n    *   Each large square (composed of 5x5 small squares) represents 5 mm.\n\nFrom this information, we can calculate the time duration for each square:\n*   **Time for one small square:** 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n*   **Time for one large square:** 5 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.20 seconds.\n\nNext, we visually inspect the entire rhythm strip to identify the longest interval between two consecutive R-waves (the highest peaks of the electrical cycle). A significant pause is clearly visible on the fourth line of the strip.\n\nTo calculate the duration of this pause:\n1.  Locate the peak of the R-wave just before the pause and the peak of the R-wave that ends the pause.\n2.  Measure the distance between these two peaks by counting the squares.\n3.  The interval covers approximately 7 full large squares and 4 additional small squares.\n\nNow, we calculate the total time:\n*   7 large squares = 7 x 0.20 seconds = 1.40 seconds.\n*   4 small squares = 4 x 0.04 seconds = 0.16 seconds.\n*   **Total longest R-R interval** = 1.40s + 0.16s = 1.56 seconds.\n\n<<<1.56>>>"
