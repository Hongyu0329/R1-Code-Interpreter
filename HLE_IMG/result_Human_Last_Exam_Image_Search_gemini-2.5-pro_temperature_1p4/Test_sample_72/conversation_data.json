    "Based on the provided reaction, the transformation from hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene to the final product under photochemical conditions involves two distinct pericyclic reactions.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction mechanism:\n\n1.  **Valence Isomerization of Hexafluorobenzene**: The first pericyclic reaction is the photochemical valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene into its more reactive isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This conversion of an aromatic ring into a strained, non-aromatic bicyclic system is a characteristic photochemical reaction of benzene and its derivatives. This type of rearrangement is a pericyclic reaction.\n\n2.  **[2+2] Photocycloaddition**: The second pericyclic reaction is a [2+2] cycloaddition. The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, is highly strained and readily undergoes cycloaddition reactions. Under the influence of light, it reacts with cyclobutene via a [2π+2π] photocycloaddition. In this step, one of the double bonds of hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene reacts with the double bond of cyclobutene to form a new four-membered ring, fusing the two molecules together.\n\nTherefore, the two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions involved are a valence isomerization and a [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\n<<<A valence isomerization and a [2+2] cycloaddition.>>>"
