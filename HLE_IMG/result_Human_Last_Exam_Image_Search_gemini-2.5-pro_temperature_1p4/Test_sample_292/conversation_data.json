    "This picture was taken in Boston.\n\nThe image showcases the distinctive architectural features of the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center (BCEC). The most recognizable element is the spectacular curved glass ceiling with its unique circular patterns, which allows a significant amount of daylight to fill the main exhibition hall.\n\nThe visible white steel truss system is another key identifier of the BCEC's expansive interior. This modern design, created by architect Rafael Vi√±oly in partnership with HNTB Architecture, is a well-known landmark in the city.\n\n<<<Boston>>>"
