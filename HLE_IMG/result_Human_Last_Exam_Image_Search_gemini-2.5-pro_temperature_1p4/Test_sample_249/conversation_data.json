    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. It is a leather star, and its scientific name is *Dermasterias imbricata*.\n\nThe image displays the characteristic smooth, leathery skin with a distinct reticulated or honeycomb pattern in shades of reddish-brown and grayish-blue. This sea star is known for its five broad arms that taper from a central disc.\n\nThe leather star is found along the western coast of North America, from Alaska to northern Mexico, inhabiting rocky bottoms and sandy seabeds in both intertidal zones and deeper waters. A notable feature of this animal is its faint garlic-like smell. It feeds on a variety of invertebrates, including sea anemones, sea urchins, and sponges. <<<*Dermasterias imbricata*>>>"
