    "The artist of the painting is Dominique Appia. The title of the work is \"Entre les Trous de la MÃ©moire,\" which translates to \"Between the Gaps of Memory.\"\n\nThis surrealist painting depicts a room with several fantastical and illogical elements. A young girl sits on the floor reading a book, while nearby, a pile of books is on fire in front of an empty fireplace. One part of the room opens up to a desolate landscape with a field of ice and a hot air balloon. Another doorway in the room leads to a hallway filled with seawater, with an ocean liner visible in the distance. A picture of the Leaning Tower of Pisa hangs crookedly on the wall, and a large, wreathed marble head is partially visible in an alcove.\n\n<<<Dominique Appia>>>"
