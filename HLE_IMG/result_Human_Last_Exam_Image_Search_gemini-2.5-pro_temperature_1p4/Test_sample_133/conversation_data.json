    "The analysis of the mass spectrum provides several key clues to identify the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** The cluster of peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) likely represents the molecular ion. In the provided spectrum, there is a significant cluster of peaks at m/z 258, 260, 262, and 264. The pattern of these peaks, specifically the M+, M+2, and M+4 signals, is characteristic of a molecule containing multiple chlorine atoms. The nominal molecular weight can be inferred from this cluster.\n\n2.  **Base Peak:** The most intense peak in the spectrum, known as the base peak, is observed at m/z 225. This peak represents the most stable fragment ion formed during the electron ionization process.\n\n3.  **Fragmentation:** A prominent fragmentation pathway appears to be the loss of a chlorine atom from the molecular ion to form the base peak. The difference in mass between the molecular ion cluster and the base peak confirms this. For example, the loss of a chlorine-35 atom from a fragment of m/z 260 results in a fragment of m/z 225 (260 - 35 = 225). This suggests that the fragment at m/z 225 is [M-Cl]+.\n\n4.  **Compound Identification:** Based on the molecular weight and the fragmentation pattern, the compound is likely a trichlorobiphenyl. The chemical formula for a trichlorobiphenyl is C₁₂H₇Cl₃. Its monoisotopic mass is approximately 256 g/mol, calculated with the most abundant isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ³⁵Cl).\n\n5.  **Database Matching:** A search in mass spectral databases confirms that the provided spectrum is a match for 2,4,4'-Trichlorobiphenyl (also known as PCB 28). The mass spectrum for this compound shows a molecular ion cluster around m/z 258-262 and a characteristic base peak at m/z 225, resulting from the loss of a chlorine atom.\n\nTherefore, the compound corresponding to the mass spectrum is 2,4,4'-Trichlorobiphenyl.\n\nAccording to IUPAC nomenclature, the systematic name is **2,4-dichloro-1-(4-chlorophenyl)benzene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dichloro-1-(4-chlorophenyl)benzene>>>"
