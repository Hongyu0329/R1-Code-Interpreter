    "Here is the step-by-step solution for the two-move checkmate:\n\n**1. Nc5**\n\nThe first move for White is to move the Knight from b7 to c5. This is a quiet move that sets up an unstoppable threat. After this move, no matter what Black plays, White has a checkmating move.\n\n**Black's Turn**\n\nBlack has several possible moves, but none can prevent the checkmate on White's next turn. Let's consider Black's main responses:\n*   If Black captures the knight with the queen (1... Qxc5).\n*   If Black captures the knight with the rook (1... Rxc5).\n*   If Black moves the pawn (1... f3).\n*   If Black makes any other move with the rook or queen.\n\n**2. Rf4#**\n\nFor every possible move Black makes, White's response is the same: move the Rook from f3 to f4. This results in a checkmate.\n\nHere's why it is a checkmate:\n*   The Black King on e4 is in check from the White Rook on f4.\n*   The King has no escape squares:\n    *   **d4** is attacked by the White Queen on a4.\n    *   **d3** is attacked by the White pawn on b4.\n    *   **f3** is attacked by the White Bishop on g2.\n    *   **f5** is attacked by the White Rook on h5.\n*   The check cannot be blocked.\n*   The checking piece, the Rook on f4, cannot be captured. The Black pawn on e5, which would normally be able to capture the rook, is pinned to the king by the White Bishop on g2.\n\nTherefore, the sequence **1. Nc5** followed by **2. Rf4#** guarantees a checkmate in two moves.\n\n<<<1. Nc5, 2. Rf4#>>>"
