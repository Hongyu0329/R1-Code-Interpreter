    "The image displays several species common to the intertidal zones of rocky coastlines. To definitively identify the ocean as the Atlantic, one must identify a species present that is exclusive to the Atlantic Ocean and absent from the Pacific.\n\nThree prominent species are visible in the photograph:\n*   **The Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*)**: The snail with the conical, dark-striped shell.\n*   **The Atlantic Dog Whelk (*Nucella lapillus*)**: The whitish, more rounded snail.\n*   **The Northern Rock Barnacle (*Semibalanus balanoides*)**: The clusters of acorn barnacles covering the rock surface.\n\nOf these, the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*, serves as a clear indicator. This species is native to the northeastern coasts of Europe and was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the 19th century. It has since become a dominant species in the intertidal zone of the Northwest Atlantic, ranging from Labrador, Canada, to Delaware, USA. While there have been reports of its introduction on the Pacific coast, it is not established or widespread there.\n\nThe other visible species also point to an Atlantic location. The Atlantic Dog Whelk, *Nucella lapillus*, is found on both sides of the North Atlantic but not in the Pacific. Similarly, the Northern Rock Barnacle, *Semibalanus balanoides*, is primarily an inhabitant of the North Atlantic. While some sources indicate a Pacific presence for *S. balanoides*, others clarify it is the most common intertidal barnacle on the *northeast coast* of North America, distinguishing it from Pacific populations. The combined presence of these three species makes a conclusive case for the photo being taken on an Atlantic coast. However, *Littorina littorea* is visually distinct and its history as an Atlantic invasive species is well-documented.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
