    "The poetic form used in this sequence of erasure poems is the **Gitanjali**.\n\nThis specific piece is titled \"The Other Clouds,\" an erasure poem created by the artist Mary Ruefle. The text is derived from a 1913 edition of Rabindranath Tagore's *Gitanjali*. The Gitanjali form, as used by Tagore in his English translation, consists of prose poems. These poems do not follow a strict meter or rhyme scheme but are characterized by their lyrical and devotional nature, often presented in short, impactful stanzas.\n\nThe complete four-line stanza from this erasure sequence reads:\n\n> ghostly velum\n> form s like a dance\n> a vortex\n> nacreous wavers\n\nWhile erasure poetry as a technique involves creating a new work by removing text from an existing source, the underlying form of this particular sequence is dictated by the structure of the source text, Tagore's *Gitanjali*.\n\n<<<Gitanjali>>>"
