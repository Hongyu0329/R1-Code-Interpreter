    "Here are the identifications for the rock specimens:\n\n*   **H: Scoria** This rock is reddish-brown and has a highly porous or vesicular texture. These features are characteristic of scoria, an extrusive igneous rock that forms from gas-rich lava. The reddish color is due to the oxidation of iron.\n\n*   **I: Volcanic Breccia** This specimen is composed of angular fragments of various rocks cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This composition and structure are typical of a volcanic breccia, which forms from the accumulation of rock fragments produced during an explosive volcanic eruption.\n\n*   **J: Pumice** This is a light-colored, fine-grained, and highly vesicular rock. Its frothy appearance is a hallmark of pumice, a volcanic rock formed from gas-rich, viscous magma that cools rapidly. Due to its high porosity, pumice is very lightweight and can often float on water.\n\n*   **K: Pegmatite** This rock displays very large, interlocking crystals, which is the defining characteristic of a pegmatite. Pegmatites are intrusive igneous rocks that form during the final stages of magma crystallization, a process which allows for the growth of exceptionally large crystals. The mineral composition often includes quartz, feldspar, and mica.\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Volcanic Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite>>>"
