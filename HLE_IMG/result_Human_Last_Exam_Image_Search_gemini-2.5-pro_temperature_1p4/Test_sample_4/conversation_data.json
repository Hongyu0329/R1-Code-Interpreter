    "The Jones polynomial $p(t)$ for the knot depicted in the image, which is identified as the 9_42 knot, is:\n\n$t^{-7} - t^{-6} + 2t^{-5} - 2t^{-4} + 2t^{-3} - 3t^{-2} + 3t^{-1} - 2 + 2t - 2t^2 + t^3$\n\nThis can be rearranged in decreasing degree order as:\n\n$t^3 - 2t^2 + 2t - 2 + 3t^{-1} - 3t^{-2} + 2t^{-3} - 2t^{-4} + 2t^{-5} - t^{-6} + t^{-7}$\n\nThe knot 9_42 is a notable example in knot theory. It is one of the first knots, along with its mirror image, for which the Jones polynomial, as well as the more general HOMFLY and Kauffman polynomials, fails to distinguish its chirality. In other words, the knot and its mirror image possess the same polynomial invariants. Distinguishing the chirality of the 9_42 knot requires more advanced invariants, such as those derived from Chern-Simons theory.\n\nThe polynomial can be computed using specialized mathematical software like Mathematica with the KnotTheory` package [1]. The existence of comprehensive tables and computational tools is crucial for the study of knot invariants [6, 7].\n\n<<<$t^3 - 2t^2 + 2t - 2 + 3t^{-1} - 3t^{-2} + 2t^{-3} - 2t^{-4} + 2t^{-5} - t^{-6} + t^{-7}$>>>"
