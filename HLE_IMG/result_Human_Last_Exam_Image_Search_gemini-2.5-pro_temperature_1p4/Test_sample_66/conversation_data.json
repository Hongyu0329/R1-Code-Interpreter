    "Here is a step-by-step solution to find the total area of the shaded regions.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Geometry\nLet O be the center of the circular sector (the bottom vertex). The sector is divided into four smaller sectors by radii, each subtending an angle labeled θ. Let the radii be denoted `r_0, r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4` from left to right.\n\nThe problem provides key information through the labels `17` and `34` and the right-angle symbols. Let's analyze the geometric construction that these numbers imply. The diagram shows two symmetric constructions, one for the blue region and one for the red region, relative to the central radius `r_2`.\n\nLet's consider the construction for the red region. It involves a right-angled triangle. A plausible interpretation that is consistent with all the labels is as follows:\n*   There is a point `P` on the central radius `r_2` such that the distance from the center O to P is `OP = 34`.\n*   A line segment `PQ` is drawn from P, perpendicular to the radius `r_2`, with length `PQ = 17`.\n*   The point `Q` lies on the arc of the circle.\n\nBy symmetry, the same construction applies to the blue region, but on the other side of the radius `r_2`.\n\n### 2. Characterizing the Triangle and the Sector\nLet's analyze the triangle formed by O, P, and Q (let's call it `Triangle OPQ`).\n*   It is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at P.\n*   The legs have lengths `OP = 34` and `PQ = 17`.\n*   The hypotenuse `OQ` is a radius of the circular sector. Let's call its length `R`.\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem:\n`R² = OP² + PQ² = 34² + 17²`\n`R² = 1156 + 289 = 1445`\n\nThe angle that the radius `OQ` makes with the radius `OP` (which lies on `r_2`) is one of the angles labeled θ. Let's verify this. In the right-angled triangle `OPQ`:\n`tan(∠POQ) = Opposite / Adjacent = PQ / OP = 17 / 34 = 1/2`\n\nThe diagram indicates that the angle between adjacent marked radii is θ. The construction shows that `OQ` corresponds to the radius `r_3`. Therefore, `∠P_2OP_3` (where `P_2` and `P_3` are points on the arc corresponding to radii `r_2` and `r_3`) is indeed `θ = arctan(1/2)`. The construction is consistent.\n\n### 3. Finding the Total Shaded Area\n\nThe total shaded area is the union of the blue and red regions. Calculating the areas of these complex shapes (bounded by an arc and chords) directly using integration or standard geometric formulas would be extremely complicated.\n\nHowever, this type of problem often relies on a clever geometric principle or theorem that simplifies the calculation. A key insight, often associated with \"visual calculus\" or Mamikon's theorem, states that the area of a region swept by a moving line segment is equal to the area of the \"cluster\" formed by moving all the generating line segments to a common origin.\n\nIn this problem, the total shaded area can be seen as a sweep. The corresponding \"cluster\" shape is the triangle formed by the union of the two right-angled triangles used in the construction.\n\nLet's define these triangles:\n*   For the red region, we have the triangle `T_R = OPQ` (or `OPP_3` using arc point notation), with area `A(T_R) = (1/2) * OP * PQ = (1/2) * 34 * 17 = 289`.\n*   For the blue region, there is a symmetric triangle `T_B` on the left side of `r_2`, also with area 289.\n\nThe cluster that represents the total shaded area is the combination of these two triangles, `T_R` and `T_B`. They share the common side `OP`. Together, they form a larger triangle. Let the vertices of this larger triangle be O, Q (from the red side), and Q' (from the blue side). This triangle has:\n*   A base equal to `Q'Q = Q'P + PQ = 17 + 17 = 34`.\n*   A height equal to `OP = 34`.\n\nThe area of this larger triangle is:\n`Total Area = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 34 * 34 = 17 * 34 = 578`.\n\nAccording to the geometric principle, the area of the complex shaded region is equal to the area of this simple triangle.\n\nTherefore, the total area of the shaded regions is 578 square units.\n\n<<<578>>>"
