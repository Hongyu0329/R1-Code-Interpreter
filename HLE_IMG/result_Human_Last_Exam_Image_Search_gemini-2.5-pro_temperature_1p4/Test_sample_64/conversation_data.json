    "The image displays a biological process known as **tip regeneration** in the cellular slime mold *Dictyostelium discoideum*.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening in the images:\n\n*   **Organism:** The organism shown is *Dictyostelium discoideum*, a social amoeba. Under starvation conditions, these individual amoebae aggregate to form a multicellular structure called a \"slug\" or \"pseudoplasmodium\". This slug can migrate to find a suitable location to form a fruiting body for spore dispersal.\n\n*   **Panels L, M, and N:** The image is part of a series illustrating an experiment on the slug stage of *Dictyostelium*. The structure is a multicellular filament.\n\n*   **The Process:** The arrowheads in the images point to the site of regeneration. The process depicted is the formation of a new tip after the original tip of the slug has been removed. The \"tip\" of the *Dictyostelium* slug acts as an organizer, similar to an embryonic organizer, directing the development of the rest of the organism. When the tip is amputated, the remaining part of the slug can regulate and form a new one. The time it takes for this new tip to form can be used to study positional information within the organism. The bulges indicated by the arrowheads in panels M and N show the progressive development of this new organizing tip.\n\nIn summary, the image captures sequential stages (L, M, N) of the regeneration of an organizing tip on a multicellular *Dictyostelium discoideum* slug after the original tip has been cut off.\n\n<<<Tip regeneration in *Dictyostelium discoideum*.>>>"
