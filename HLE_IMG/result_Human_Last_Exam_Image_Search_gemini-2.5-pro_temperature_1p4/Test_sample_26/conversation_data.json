    "The correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata is V7/iv.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the harmonic analysis:\n*   **Key Signature:** The sonata's home key is C minor.\n*   **Chord in Measure 30:** The notes in measure 30 are G, B-natural, D, and F in the right hand, with G in the bass. This spells a G dominant 7th chord (G7).\n*   **Harmonic Function:** This measure is part of a sequence where a pattern is repeated in different keys. The progression moves from G (measures 25-27) to A-flat (measures 28-31). The G7 chord in measure 30 is functioning as a secondary dominant, also known as an applied dominant. It is the dominant (V) of the chord that follows, which is C minor. However, in the broader context of the phrase starting in measure 28, this C minor chord is acting as the minor dominant (v) of F minor. More directly, some analyses identify the chord in measure 30 as an augmented 6th chord, which serves a pre-dominant function.\n*   **Roman Numeral:** The G7 chord is built on G, the fifth degree of C minor. In this specific context, it is leading to a chord rooted on C, which is the fourth degree (subdominant or 'iv') of the temporary key of G minor established at the start of the development. Therefore, the Roman numeral V7/iv correctly identifies it as the dominant 7th of the subdominant.\n\n<<<V7/iv>>>"
