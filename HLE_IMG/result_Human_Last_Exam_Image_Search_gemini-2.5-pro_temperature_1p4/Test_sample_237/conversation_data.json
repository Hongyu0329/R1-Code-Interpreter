    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. It is a species of longhorn beetle.\n\nBased on its distinct coloration and markings, the animal is identified as a *Stictoleptura cordigera*, commonly known as the Heart-bearing Lepture. This beetle belongs to the longhorn beetle family, Cerambycidae.\n\nKey identifying features of this species visible in the photograph include its black head, pronotum (the section behind the head), and legs, combined with bright reddish elytra (wing cases). A characteristic feature of this beetle is the black marking on its back which is often described as heart-shaped or like a cup. The size of this black marking can vary among individuals.\n\nAdults are typically 14–20 millimeters (0.55–0.79 in) long and are often found visiting flowers, where they feed on pollen and nectar. The life cycle of this beetle takes two to three years to complete. This species is primarily found in several European countries, as well as Turkey and northern Iran.\n\n<<<Stictoleptura cordigera>>>"
