    "The city in the image is **Seoul, South Korea**.\n\nThe photograph was taken in the Gangnam district, renowned for its modern architecture and bustling city life. The prominent buildings visible in the skyline are key identifiers of this location.\n\nNotably, the building with the unique, undulating glass facade is the **GT Tower East**. This 130-meter-tall office building is a distinctive feature of the Gangnam skyline and is known for its fascinating design that contrasts with the more angular architecture typical of Seoul. It is located near Gangnam Station.\n\nThe towers on the right are part of **Samsung Town**, a major office complex in Seocho-gu that serves as a hub for the Samsung corporation. This complex consists of three main towers that house various Samsung affiliates, including Samsung Electronics, Samsung C&T, and Samsung Life Insurance. The design of these towers features a unique curtain wall that emphasizes horizontal and vertical elements.\n\nThe concentration of these specific skyscrapers firmly places the viewpoint of the photograph in the vibrant and modern Gangnam area of Seoul.\n\n<<<Seoul>>>"
