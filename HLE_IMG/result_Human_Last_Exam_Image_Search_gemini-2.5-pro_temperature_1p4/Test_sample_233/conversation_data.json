    "The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image is identified by the catalog number **Sö 281**. This stone is located in the wall of Strängnäs Cathedral in Sweden.\n\nSö 281 is one of approximately 26 Ingvar runestones, which are memorials to those who died during a Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled between 1036 and 1041. This specific stone was discovered in 1863 being used as a doorstep in the cathedral and was subsequently moved into the wall.\n\nThe inscription on Sö 281 commemorates the brother of a man named Ulf who died with Ingvar in \"Serkland\" (the Saracen lands). The distinctive grid-like pattern of the runic bands is a notable feature of this monument. The runes seen in the fragment, including the name \"Ingvar\" (`ikuari`), are visible on the stone.\n\nThere are seven runestones located at Strängnäs Cathedral, two of which are related to Ingvar's expedition.\n\n<<<Sö 281>>>"
