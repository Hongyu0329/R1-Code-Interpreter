    "The phenomenon illustrated in the image, where a tone interrupted by a burst of noise is perceived as continuous, is known as the **auditory continuity illusion** or **perceptual restoration of sound**.\n\nThis auditory illusion occurs when a sound is briefly interrupted and replaced by another sound, typically noise, that is loud enough to mask the gap. Instead of perceiving the original sound as stopping and starting, the brain perceptually \"fills in\" the missing portion, creating the experience of an uninterrupted sound. This reveals the auditory system's tendency to maintain the continuity of a soundscape, even when the sensory information is incomplete.\n\nThis \"filling-in\" is an unconscious process where the brain uses context and prior experience to repair the missing auditory information. The effect is not limited to simple tones; it also applies to more complex and meaningful sounds like speech and music. When it occurs with speech, it is often called the **phonemic restoration effect**.\n\nThe strength of the illusion depends on factors such as the loudness and duration of the interrupting noise. If the noise is sufficiently loud and the gap is not too long, the listener is likely to perceive the sound as continuous. This perceptual ability is crucial for understanding speech and other sounds in noisy environments where parts of the auditory signal might be temporarily obscured.\n\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion>>>"
