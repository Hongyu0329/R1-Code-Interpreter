    "Based on the visual analysis of the provided image, the tiling exhibits **10-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\nThis type of pattern is characteristic of a quasicrystal, specifically one that is closely related to a Penrose tiling. Quasicrystals are ordered but not periodic, meaning they do not have translational symmetry but can possess rotational symmetries that are forbidden in conventional periodic crystals.\n\nIn the given tiling, one can identify central points, particularly in the middle of the large, decagonal star-like figures, around which the entire pattern can be rotated by an angle of 36 degrees (360Â°/10) and remain unchanged. This indicates a 10-fold rotational symmetry. While Penrose tilings are most famous for their 5-fold symmetry, certain variations and other quasicrystalline structures can exhibit 10-fold symmetry.\n\nLooking closely at the image, you can see that ten kites or rhombi-like shapes meet at the center of the main motifs, confirming the 10-fold nature of the rotation.\n\n<<<10-fold>>>"
