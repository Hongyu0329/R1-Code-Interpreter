    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material and First Reaction**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is 2-(p-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    *   The core azabicycloalkenone structure (C7H5F3NO) is attached to a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group (C8H9O).\n    *   The molecular formula of the starting material is C15H14F3NO2.\n\n2.  **Reaction 1: PMB Deprotection**\n    *   **Reagents:** Ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) in acetonitrile (ACN) and water (H2O).\n    *   **Transformation:** CAN is a strong oxidizing agent commonly used to remove the electron-rich p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group from nitrogen atoms. The N-PMB bond is cleaved, and the PMB group is replaced by a hydrogen atom, forming a secondary amine (lactam).\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    *   **Molecular Formula Change:** The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed, and one hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen.\n        *   Change: -C8, -H9, -O1, +H1 = -C8, -H8, -O1\n        *   Formula of Intermediate 1: C(15-8)H(14-8)F3N1O(2-1) = **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the Second Reaction**\n\n1.  **Reaction 2: Hydrogenation**\n    *   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2) in methanol (MeOH).\n    *   **Transformation:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The Pd/C catalyst facilitates the addition of hydrogen across the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the ring. This converts the alkene to an alkane.\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** The product is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n    *   **Molecular Formula Change:** Two hydrogen atoms are added to the molecule.\n        *   Change: +H2\n        *   Formula of Intermediate 2: C7H(6+2)F3NO = **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the Third Reaction and Final Product**\n\n1.  **Reaction 3: Lactam Hydrolysis**\n    *   **Reagents:** 4 N Hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 70 Â°C.\n    *   **Transformation:** These conditions promote the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the lactam (a cyclic amide). The amide bond (N-C=O) is cleaved by the addition of a water molecule (H2O). This opens the bicyclic ring system.\n    *   **Product:** The ring-opening results in the formation of a substituted cyclopentane ring that contains both an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Specifically, the product is 4-amino-2-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid.\n    *   **Molecular Formula Change:** One molecule of water (H2O) is added to Intermediate 2.\n        *   Change: +H2, +O1\n        *   Formula of the Final Product: C7H(8+2)F3N1O(1+1) = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBy analyzing each step of the reaction sequence, the molecular formula of the final product is determined to be C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
