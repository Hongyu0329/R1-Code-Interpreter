    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the structure and IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\n\n*   The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M⁺) at **m/z = 135**.\n*   According to the **Nitrogen Rule**, a molecule with an odd molecular weight likely contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We will assume one nitrogen atom (N, atomic weight ≈ 14).\n*   Based on this, the molecular formula is likely **C₉H₁₃N**:\n    *   Mass of C₉H₁₃N = (9 * 12.01) + (13 * 1.01) + (1 * 14.01) = 108.09 + 13.13 + 14.01 = 135.23. This is consistent with the M⁺ peak.\n*   The **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)** for C₉H₁₃N is calculated as:\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4.\n    A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**\n\n*   **~3050 cm⁻¹:** Peaks characteristic of sp² C-H stretching (aromatic).\n*   **~2850-2950 cm⁻¹:** Peaks characteristic of sp³ C-H stretching (aliphatic).\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹ and ~1450-1500 cm⁻¹:** Absorptions typical for C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   There are peaks in the 3200-3400 cm⁻¹ region which could indicate N-H stretching of a primary or secondary amine.\n*   The absence of strong peaks around 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O) or 2250 cm⁻¹ (C≡N) rules out carbonyl and nitrile groups.\n\n### **3. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectroscopy**\n\n*   **¹³C Chemical Shifts (δ):** 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** Four signals (145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm) confirm the presence of a substituted benzene ring.\n*   **Aliphatic Region:** Three signals (49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm).\n*   **DEPT-135 Analysis:**\n    *   **One negative signal:** Indicates one CH₂ (methylene) group. Based on typical chemical shifts, this corresponds to the signal at **43.5 ppm**.\n    *   **Five positive signals:** Indicate a total of five CH (methine) and/or CH₃ (methyl) groups.\n        *   From the aliphatic region, this means the signals at **49.6 ppm** and **19.2 ppm** are from either CH or CH₃ groups.\n        *   The signal at 19.2 ppm is characteristic of a CH₃ group.\n        *   The signal at 49.6 ppm is characteristic of a CH group, often attached to an electronegative atom like nitrogen.\n        *   The remaining three positive signals must be the aromatic CH carbons at 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm.\n    *   The signal at **145.1 ppm** does not appear in the DEPT-135 spectrum, confirming it is a quaternary carbon (the ipso-carbon of the benzene ring).\n\nSummary from ¹³C/DEPT: The molecule contains:\n*   A substituted benzene ring (1 quaternary C, at least 3 CH C's).\n*   A CH group (49.6 ppm).\n*   A CH₂ group (43.5 ppm).\n*   A CH₃ group (19.2 ppm).\n\n### **4. ¹H NMR and HSQC Spectroscopy**\n\n*   **~7.2-7.3 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** This pattern and integration strongly suggest a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   **HSQC Correlation:**\n    *   The proton signal at **~2.9 ppm** (multiplet, integration ~1H) correlates with the carbon at **49.6 ppm**. This is the **CH** group.\n    *   The proton signal at **~2.7 ppm** (multiplet, integration ~2H) correlates with the carbon at **43.5 ppm**. This is the benzylic **CH₂** group.\n    *   The proton signal at **~1.2 ppm** (doublet, integration ~3H) correlates with the carbon at **19.2 ppm**. This is the **CH₃** group.\n\n### **5. Structure Determination**\n\n1.  We have confirmed the following fragments: a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group. We also have one nitrogen atom, and to satisfy the molecular formula C₉H₁₃N, it must be a primary amine (-NH₂) as all other atoms are accounted for.\n2.  The ¹H NMR splitting provides the connectivity:\n    *   The **CH₃ group signal is a doublet**, which means it is adjacent to a carbon with only one proton. This confirms a **-CH(CH₃)** fragment.\n    *   The CH₂ group is at 2.7 ppm, a typical benzylic shift, placing it next to the phenyl ring: **Ph-CH₂-**.\n    *   The CH group is adjacent to both the CH₃ and the benzylic CH₂ group. Its signal is a multiplet due to coupling with the two protons of the CH₂ group and the three protons of the CH₃ group.\n    *   The benzylic CH₂ signal is a complex multiplet, not a simple doublet. This is because the adjacent CH group is a chiral center, making the two benzylic protons diastereotopic. They couple with each other and with the single proton on the CH group, resulting in a complex signal.\n\nAssembling these pieces leads to a single possible structure:\n\n**Phenyl group → CH₂ group → CH group (with NH₂ attached) → CH₃ group**\n\nThis corresponds to the structure of **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\nFinal Check:\n*   **Structure:** 1-phenylpropan-2-amine\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₃N (Correct)\n*   **MS:** M⁺ = 135 (Correct)\n*   **NMR Data:** All chemical shifts and splitting patterns are fully consistent with this structure.\n\nThe IUPAC name for this compound is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
