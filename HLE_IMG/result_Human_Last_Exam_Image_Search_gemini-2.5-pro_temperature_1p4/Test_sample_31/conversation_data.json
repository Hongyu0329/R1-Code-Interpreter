    "The knot in the image is identified as the prime knot 8₁₈. This identification can be confirmed by comparing the provided diagram with standard knot tables, such as the one found on the Knot Atlas. The image displays a knot with 8 crossings, and its specific arrangement of over and under strands matches the diagram for 8₁₈.\n\nThe Rasmussen s-invariant is an integer value associated with a knot, derived from a branch of mathematics known as Khovanov homology. For the 8₁₈ knot, the Rasmussen s-invariant is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
