    "To determine the total current flowing through the circuit, we first need to calculate the total equivalent resistance of the circuit. Then, using Ohm's Law, we can find the total current supplied by the voltage source.\n\n### Circuit Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Resistor Connections**:\n    The circuit consists of a 1V voltage source (V2) and five resistors. These resistors are arranged in two parallel branches connected to the voltage source.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Left Branch**:\n    *   This branch contains resistors R1 (3 Ω), R2 (7 Ω), and R3 (9 Ω).\n    *   A wire connects the node between R1 and R2 to the node between R2 and R3. This wire creates a short circuit across resistor R2, meaning the current will bypass R2 and flow through this wire of negligible resistance.\n    *   Therefore, in this branch, resistors R1 and R3 are effectively in series.\n    *   The equivalent resistance of this branch (R_left) is:\n        R_left = R1 + R3 = 3 Ω + 9 Ω = 12 Ω\n\n3.  **Analyze the Right Branch**:\n    *   This branch contains resistors R8 (100 Ω) and R7 (100 Ω).\n    *   These two resistors are connected in series.\n    *   The equivalent resistance of this branch (R_right) is:\n        R_right = R8 + R7 = 100 Ω + 100 Ω = 200 Ω\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Equivalent Resistance (R_total)**:\n    *   The left branch (R_left) and the right branch (R_right) are connected in parallel to the voltage source.\n    *   The total equivalent resistance can be calculated using the formula for parallel resistors: 1/R_total = 1/R_left + 1/R_right.\n    *   1/R_total = 1/12 Ω + 1/200 Ω\n    *   To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 600.\n    *   1/R_total = (50/600 + 3/600) Ω⁻¹ = 53/600 Ω⁻¹\n    *   R_total = 600 / 53 Ω ≈ 11.32 Ω\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Current (I_total)**:\n    *   Using Ohm's Law (V = I * R), the total current flowing from the voltage source is I_total = V2 / R_total.\n    *   I_total = 1 V / (600 / 53 Ω)\n    *   I_total = 53 / 600 A\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe total current flowing through the circuit is **53/600 Amperes**.\n\nAs a decimal, this is approximately **0.0883 Amperes** (or 88.3 mA).\n\n<<<0.0883 A>>>"
