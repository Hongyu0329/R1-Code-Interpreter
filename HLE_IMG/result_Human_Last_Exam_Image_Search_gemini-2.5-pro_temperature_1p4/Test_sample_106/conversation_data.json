    "The chemical reaction shown is an acid-catalyzed dehydration of a triterpenoid alcohol, which initiates a series of shifts known as a Wagner-Meerwein or backbone rearrangement. This type of rearrangement is common in terpene and steroid chemistry under acidic conditions. The starting material appears to be friedelan-3Î²-ol, and its reaction under acidic conditions leads to rearranged terpene structures.\n\nTo determine the substituents at the numbered positions, one must trace the carbocation shifts and the final elimination step.\n\n1.  **Protonation and Dehydration:** The hydroxyl (-OH) group at C3 is protonated by the catalytic HCl and leaves as a water molecule, forming a secondary carbocation at C3.\n2.  **Backbone Rearrangement:** A cascade of energetically favorable-hydride and-methyl shifts occurs to move the positive charge across the carbon skeleton. This specific sequence for friedelane derivatives is well-documented. The shifts proceed as follows to form progressively more stable carbocations:\n    *   **Methyl shift:** A methyl group from C4 moves to C3, shifting the carbocation to the tertiary C4.\n    *   **Hydride shift:** A hydride from C5 moves to C4, placing the carbocation at C5.\n    *   **Methyl shift:** The methyl group from the C10-C5 bond moves to C5, moving the carbocation to C10.\n    *   **Hydride shift:** A hydride from C9 moves to C10, placing the carbocation at C9.\n    *   **Hydride shift:** A hydride from C8 moves to C9, moving the carbocation to C8.\n    *   **Methyl shift:** The methyl group from C14 moves to C8, placing the carbocation at C14.\n    *   **Methyl shift:** The methyl group from C13 moves to C14, moving the carbocation to C13.\n3.  **Elimination:** The rearrangement cascade typically terminates when the carbocation is at a position from which a stable alkene can be formed. In this case, with the carbocation at C13, a proton is removed from the adjacent C12 to form a double bond between C12 and C13. The resulting product is olean-12-ene.\n\nBy tracking the original and final positions of the methyl groups and hydrogens involved in the shifts, we can identify the substituents at the specified locations in the final product:\n\n*   **Position 1:** This was originally the C4 carbon, which had two methyl groups. One of them migrated to C3, and a hydride from C5 migrated in. Therefore, position 1 in the final structure retains a methyl group (CH3).\n*   **Position 2:** This was the original C10 position, which had a methyl group that migrated to C5. A hydride from C9 moved to this position. Thus, the substituent at position 2 is a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 3:** This was the original C8 position. A hydride migrated from here to C9, and a methyl group from C14 migrated to this position. Consequently, position 3 is occupied by a methyl group (CH3).\n*   **Position 4:** This was the original C14 position, which had a methyl group that migrated to C8. A methyl group from C13 then migrated to C14. Therefore, position 4 is a methyl group (CH3).\n*   **Position 5:** This was the original C13 position, which had a methyl group that migrated to C14. It becomes the carbocation center, and no new group shifts to it. A proton is eliminated from the adjacent C12, leaving no substituent other than what's part of the ring. Looking at the starting material, there was also a hydrogen on this carbon which remains. Thus, the substituent is a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nTherefore, the substituents are:\n1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
