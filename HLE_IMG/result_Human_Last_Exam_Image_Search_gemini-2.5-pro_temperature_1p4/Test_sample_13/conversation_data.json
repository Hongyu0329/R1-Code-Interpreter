    "Based on a logical analysis of the Kakuro puzzle's clues, there is a contradiction when applying standard Kakuro rules where digits are restricted to 1-9. Specifically, the clue \"22\" for a two-cell horizontal block is impossible, as the maximum sum of two unique digits from 1 to 9 is 17 (8+9).\n\nHowever, some variations of Kakuro allow for digits up to 12. Assuming this special rule is in effect for this puzzle, a solution can be derived.\n\nLet the two top white squares be 'x' (left) and 'y' (right). Let the two squares directly below them be 'z' (left) and 'w' (right).\n\nFrom the puzzle's clues:\n1.  The sum of the top two squares is 15: `x + y = 15`\n2.  The sum of the top two cells in the first visible column is 17: `x + z = 17`\n3.  The sum of the two cells in the second row is 22: `z + w = 22`\n\nUnder the assumption that digits can be from 1 to 12:\n*   From clue #3, the only pair of unique digits that sum to 22 is {10, 12}. So, {z, w} must be {10, 12}.\n\nWe can test two cases:\n\n*   **Case 1: z = 10 and w = 12**\n    *   Using clue #2: `x + 10 = 17`, which means `x = 7`.\n    *   Using clue #1: `7 + y = 15`, which means `y = 8`.\n    *   This gives the numbers 7, 8, 10, and 12. The cells in the same column (y and w) are 8 and 12, which are unique. This is a valid solution.\n\n*   **Case 2: z = 12 and w = 10**\n    *   Using clue #2: `x + 12 = 17`, which means `x = 5`.\n    *   Using clue #1: `5 + y = 15`, which means `y = 10`.\n    *   This solution would place 'y' (10) and 'w' (10) in the same column. In Kakuro, digits within a vertical block must be unique. Therefore, this case is invalid.\n\nThus, the only valid solution under these assumptions results in the top two squares containing the numbers 7 and 8.\n\n<<<7,8>>>"
