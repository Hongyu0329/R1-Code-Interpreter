    "To determine the time complexity of the provided sorting algorithm, we first need to understand how it operates and formulate a recurrence relation for its execution time.\n\n### Algorithm Analysis\n\nThe Python-like pseudocode describes a recursive function `sort(a, n)`:\n\n```python\ndef sort(a, n):\n  if n > 1:\n    # 1. First recursive call\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n\n    # 2. Comparison and potential swap\n    if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n      swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])\n\n      # 3. Second recursive call (conditional)\n      sort(a, n - 1)\n```\n\nThe algorithm works as follows:\n1.  **Base Case**: If the array has one or zero elements (`n <= 1`), it is considered sorted, and the function returns.\n2.  **Recursive Step**: If `n > 1`:\n    *   It first recursively calls itself to sort the initial `n-1` elements (`a[0]` to `a[n-2]`).\n    *   After this first call, the subarray `a[0...n-2]` is sorted. This means the largest element within this prefix is now at `a[n-2]`.\n    *   It then compares the last element of the current range, `a[n-1]`, with the new largest element of the prefix, `a[n-2]`.\n    *   If `a[n-1]` is smaller than `a[n-2]`, they are swapped. This places a larger element at `a[n-1]` but potentially disrupts the sorted order of the `a[0...n-2]` prefix.\n    *   Crucially, if a swap occurs, the algorithm calls `sort(a, n - 1)` *again* to re-sort the now-disrupted prefix.\n\n### Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe worst-case time complexity occurs when the maximum number of operations is performed at each step. In this algorithm, the most work is done when the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true after the first recursive call, as this triggers the second recursive call.\n\nLet's consider an input array sorted in reverse order, for example, `[3, 2, 1]`.\n*   `sort(a, 3)` is called on `[3, 2, 1]`.\n*   It calls `sort(a, 2)` on the prefix `[3, 2]`.\n    *   This inner call sorts the prefix to `[2, 3]`. The array becomes `[2, 3, 1]`.\n*   Back in `sort(a, 3)`, the first recursive call is done. The array is `[2, 3, 1]`.\n*   It compares `a[2]` and `a[1]` (i.e., `1 < 3`). This is true.\n*   It swaps `a[2]` and `a[1]`. The array becomes `[2, 1, 3]`.\n*   Because the swap happened, it calls `sort(a, 2)` again on the prefix `[2, 1]`. This second call will perform its own work to sort this prefix into `[1, 2]`.\n*   The final array will be `[1, 2, 3]`.\n\nAs demonstrated, a reverse-sorted array causes the second recursive call to be executed at each level of the recursion (for `n > 1`).\n\n### Recurrence Relation\n\nLet T(n) be the time complexity for an input of size n in the worst case.\n- The first recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` takes `T(n-1)`.\n- The comparison and swap take constant time, O(1).\n- The second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)`, which occurs in the worst case, also takes `T(n-1)`.\n\nThis gives us the recurrence relation:\n**T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c** (where c is a constant for the O(1) operations)\n\nLet's solve this recurrence:\n*   T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c\n*   T(n) = 2 * (2*T(n-2) + c) + c = 4*T(n-2) + 2c + c\n*   T(n) = 4 * (2*T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8*T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c\n*   ...\n*   T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-2) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)\n\nThe sum is a geometric series that equals `2^(n-1) - 1`.\nT(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)\nT(n) = d * 2^(n-1) + c * 2^(n-1) - c (where T(1) is a constant d)\nT(n) = (d+c) * 2^(n-1) - c\n\nThis shows that T(n) is proportional to 2^n. Therefore, the time complexity is O(2^n). This type of algorithm is sometimes called a \"pessimal algorithm\" due to its extreme inefficiency.\n\nComparing with the given choices:\n*   A. O(n) - Incorrect.\n*   B. O(n log n) - Incorrect.\n*   C. O(n^2) - Incorrect.\n*   D. O(n^3) - Incorrect.\n*   E. O(2^n) - **Correct.**\n*   F. does not terminate - Incorrect, as n decreases in each recursive call.\n\nThe worst-case time complexity of the given algorithm is exponential.\n\n<<<E>>>"
