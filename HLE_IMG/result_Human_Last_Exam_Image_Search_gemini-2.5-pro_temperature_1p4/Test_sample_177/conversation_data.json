    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled).\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Total Car VMT for the Baseline Scenario**\n\nTo find the total VMT, we calculate a weighted VMT for each trip distance category and then sum them up. The formula for the weighted VMT for each category is:\n\n*VMT Category = (Share of Total Trips) × (Mode Share for Cars) × (Average Trip Distance)*\n\n**Baseline Car Mode Share:**\n*   **0-3 miles:** 25% (1 occupant) + 28% (>2 occupants) = 53%\n*   **3-5 miles:** 38% (1 occupant) + 43% (>2 occupants) = 81%\n*   **5-10 miles:** 40% (1 occupant) + 45% (>2 occupants) = 85%\n*   **10+ miles:** 42% (1 occupant) + 47% (>2 occupants) = 89%\n\n**Baseline VMT Calculation:**\n*   **0-3 miles:** 0.48 (Share of Trips) × 0.53 (Car Share) × 1 (Avg. Distance) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles:** 0.22 (Share of Trips) × 0.81 (Car Share) × 4 (Avg. Distance) = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles:** 0.14 (Share of Trips) × 0.85 (Car Share) × 7.5 (Avg. Distance) = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles:** 0.16 (Share of Trips) × 0.89 (Car Share) × 20 (Avg. Distance) = 2.8480\n\n**Total Baseline VMT (weighted value) =** 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Total Car VMT for the Proposed Scenario**\n\nWe use the same method with the data from Table 2.\n\n**Proposed Car Mode Share:**\n*   **0-3 miles:** 1% (1 occupant) + 2% (>2 occupants) = 3%\n*   **3-5 miles:** 8% (1 occupant) + 19% (>2 occupants) = 27%\n*   **5-10 miles:** 14% (1 occupant) + 27% (>2 occupants) = 41%\n*   **10+ miles:** 16% (1 occupant) + 33% (>2 occupants) = 49%\n\n**Proposed VMT Calculation:**\n*   **0-3 miles:** 0.48 (Share of Trips) × 0.03 (Car Share) × 1 (Avg. Distance) = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles:** 0.22 (Share of Trips) × 0.27 (Car Share) × 4 (Avg. Distance) = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles:** 0.14 (Share of Trips) × 0.41 (Car Share) × 7.5 (Avg. Distance) = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles:** 0.16 (Share of Trips) × 0.49 (Car Share) × 20 (Avg. Distance) = 1.5680\n\n**Total Proposed VMT (weighted value) =** 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction in Car VMT**\n\nThe percentage reduction is calculated using the following formula:\n\n*Percentage Reduction = ((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) × 100*\n\n**Calculation:**\n*   VMT Reduction = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   Percentage Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100 ≈ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
