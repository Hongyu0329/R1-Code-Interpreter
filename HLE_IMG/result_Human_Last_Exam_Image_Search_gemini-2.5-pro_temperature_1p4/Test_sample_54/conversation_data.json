    "Based on the analysis of the chemical transformations shown in the image, the reagents A and B can be identified as follows:\n\n### Reagent A\n\nThe first step of the reaction shows the conversion of the oxygen-containing heterocyclic cation **1** into the N-amino derivative **2**. In this transformation, an oxygen atom within one of the rings is replaced by a nitrogen atom that is also bonded to an amino group (-NH2).\n\n*   **Transformation:** C-O-C bridge → C-N(NH2)-C bridge\n*   This type of reaction, known as a ring transformation, is characteristic of pyrylium salts (or related cationic systems) reacting with nitrogen nucleophiles.\n*   The reagent required to introduce an N-NH2 group is **hydrazine (N₂H₄)**. Hydrazine acts as a dinucleophile, attacking the electrophilic pyrylium ring system and leading to the incorporation of one nitrogen atom into the ring and the other as an exocyclic amino group.\n\nTherefore, **Reagent A is hydrazine**.\n\n### Reagent B\n\nThe second step involves the conversion of compound **2** to **3**. Two significant changes occur in this step:\n\n1.  A methoxy group (-OCH₃) on the upper right part of the molecule is replaced by a propylamino group (-NH-propyl). This is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction on the electron-deficient ring system. The source of the propylamino group must be the reagent itself.\n2.  The N-amino group (-N-NH₂) at the bottom of the molecule is converted into an amino group (-NH). This involves the cleavage of the N-N bond.\n\n*   The introduction of the N-propyl group points directly to **propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) or a related propyl-containing nucleophile** as reagent B. It attacks the cationic ring system, displacing a methoxy group.\n*   The cleavage of the N-N bond of the N-amino group to form an NH group is a known subsequent reaction that often occurs upon heating during the synthesis of such heterocyclic systems. This transformation likely occurs under the same conditions as the nucleophilic substitution with propylamine.\n\nTherefore, **Reagent B is propylamine**.\n\n<<<Reagent A is hydrazine (N₂H₄) and Reagent B is propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂).>>>"
