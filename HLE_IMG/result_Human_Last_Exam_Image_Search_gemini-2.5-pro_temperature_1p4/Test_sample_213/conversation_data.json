    "The provided sheet music is from the beginning of Act II of Alban Berg's opera, *Wozzeck*.\n\nSeveral key details in the score point to this identification:\n*   **Musical Style:** The atonal and expressionistic style of the music, with its complex harmonies and angular melodic lines, is characteristic of Alban Berg, a prominent composer of the Second Viennese School.\n*   **Instrumentation:** The score calls for a large, late-Romantic-era orchestra, including parts for English Horn (\"engl. Horn\") and a full string section.\n*   **German Annotations:** All the markings, including instrument names (\"Br.\" for *Bratsche*), player designations (\"Pult,\" \"die übrigen\"), and musical directions (\"mit Dämpfer\" for with mute), are in German.\n*   **\"Vorhang\":** The most definitive clue is the word \"(Vorhang)\" which means \"Curtain\" in German, placed right at the beginning of the music. The prompt states the music opens the second act, and this marking indicates when the curtain should rise. A search for the opening of Act II of *Wozzeck* confirms that the act begins with a short orchestral introduction before the curtain goes up. The structure of *Wozzeck* is notable, with Act II being structured as a five-movement symphony. The first scene of this act, which this music introduces, is in sonata-allegro form.\n\n<<<Wozzeck>>>"
