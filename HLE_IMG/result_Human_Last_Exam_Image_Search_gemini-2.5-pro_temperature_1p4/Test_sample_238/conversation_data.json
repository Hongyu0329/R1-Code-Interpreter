    "The small black organism in the photo is a type of slime mold.\n\nThese hair-like structures are the fruiting bodies, or sporangia, of the slime mold. Although often mistaken for fungi, slime molds are actually primitive, amoeba-like organisms classified as protists. They feed on bacteria, spores, and other organic matter found on decaying wood and other fungi.\n\nThe structures in the image consist of tiny stalks topped with \"pinhead\" spore masses. Based on this appearance, the organism is likely a species from the genus *Stemonitis*, which is commonly known as \"Chocolate Tube Slime\" or \"Tree Hair.\" These slime molds grow in clusters on decaying wood, which is the same habitat as the larger shelf fungus it is growing on. The host organism is a bracket fungus, appearing to be a species of *Trametes*, commonly known as Turkey Tail.\n\n<<<Stemonitis (slime mold)>>>"
