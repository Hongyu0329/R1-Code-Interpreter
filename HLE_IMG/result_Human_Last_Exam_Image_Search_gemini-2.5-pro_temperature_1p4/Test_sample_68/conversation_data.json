    "This coin is a 9 Deniers piece minted for the French colonies in America during the reign of King Louis XV. Specifically, these coins were struck in 1721 and 1722.\n\nThe text on the obverse, though difficult to read, would state \"LUDOVICUS XV DEI GRATIA FRANCIAE ET NAVARRAE REX,\" which translates to \"Louis XV, by the Grace of God, King of France and Navarre.\" The reverse clearly shows the inscription \"COLONIES FRANCOISES.\"\n\nThe coin was produced for circulation in several French territories in the New World, including:\n*   **Louisiana**\n*   **New France (which included Quebec, Acadia, and the Great Lakes region)**\n*   **French West Indies**\n\nThese copper coins were minted at two locations in France: Rouen, identified by the mint mark \"B\", and La Rochelle, marked with an \"H\". The coin pictured has a \"B\" mint mark, indicating it was struck in Rouen in 1721.\n\nAn edict in June 1721 authorized the production of these 9 Deniers coins to address a shortage of small change in the colonies. However, the coins were not well received in Canada, and a large quantity was returned to France in 1726 before being sent to Louisiana at a reduced value. Some were also sent to the Île Bourbon (now Réunion) in the Indian Ocean.\n\n<<<New France (including Louisiana and Canada)>>>"
