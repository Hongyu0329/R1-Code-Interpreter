    "The notes circled in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, are D, F-sharp, and A, which form a D major chord.\n\nTo determine the correct Roman numeral, we must analyze the chord in the context of the piece's key, which is D minor.\n\n*   The key is D minor.\n*   The chord in measure 8 is a D major triad (D-F#-A).\n*   The chord in the following measure, measure 9, is a G minor triad (G-Bb-D), which is the subdominant (iv) chord in D minor.\n\nA D major chord functions as the dominant chord to G minor. Therefore, the D major chord in measure 8 is best understood as a secondary dominant that resolves to the subdominant chord in the next measure. In Roman numeral analysis, this is written as V/iv (read as \"five of four\"). It acts as an \"intermediate dominant\" chord, preparing the listener for the upcoming G minor harmony.\n\n<<<V/iv>>>"
