    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we must first identify the chiral centers and then assign the configuration (R or S) to each one based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. The molecule has three chiral centers, which we will analyze from left to right.\n\n### 1. Leftmost Chiral Center\n\n*   **Substituents**: This carbon is attached to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), a hydrogen atom (-H, not explicitly drawn), and the rest of the carbon chain (R-group).\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The drawing shows both the -OH group and the -CH3 group with dashed bonds, meaning they are pointing away from the viewer. For a tetrahedral carbon, this implies that the other two bonds (to -H and the R-group) must be pointing towards the viewer (wedged bonds).\n*   **Assigning Priorities (CIP Rules)**:\n    1.  -OH (highest atomic number)\n    2.  -R (the rest of the carbon chain is more substituted than -CH3)\n    3.  -CH3\n    4.  -H (lowest atomic number)\n*   **Determining Configuration**: With the lowest priority group (-H) pointing towards the viewer (wedge), we trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (-OH → R-group → -CH3). This path goes in a clockwise direction, which would normally indicate an R configuration. However, since the lowest priority group is pointing towards the viewer, we must reverse the assignment.\n*   **Conclusion**: The configuration of the leftmost chiral center is **S**.\n\n### 2. Middle Chiral Center\n\n*   **Substituents**: This carbon is attached to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), a hydrogen atom (-H), and two other carbon groups from the main chain.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The ethyl group is shown with a wedged bond, pointing towards the viewer. This implies the implicit hydrogen atom is pointing away from the viewer (dashed bond).\n*   **Assigning Priorities (CIP Rules)**:\n    1.  The carbon atom to the left (-CH(OH)CH3), as it is bonded to an oxygen atom.\n    2.  The carbon atom to the right (-CH(CH3)CH2NH2), as it is more substituted than the ethyl group.\n    3.  The ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    4.  -H\n*   **Determining Configuration**: With the lowest priority group (-H) pointing away from the viewer, we trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3. This path is clockwise.\n*   **Conclusion**: The configuration of the middle chiral center is **R**.\n\n### 3. Rightmost Chiral Center\n\n*   **Substituents**: This carbon is attached to a methyl group (-CH3), an aminomethyl group (-CH2NH2), a hydrogen atom (-H), and the rest of the carbon chain.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The methyl group is shown with a dashed bond (pointing away). Assuming the main carbon chain bonds are in the plane of the drawing, the hydrogen atom must be pointing towards the viewer (wedged).\n*   **Assigning Priorities (CIP Rules)**:\n    1.  -CH2NH2 (the carbon is bonded to Nitrogen, which has a higher atomic number than the carbons the other groups are bonded to).\n    2.  The rest of the carbon chain (to the left).\n    3.  -CH3\n    4.  -H\n*   **Determining Configuration**: With the lowest priority group (-H) pointing towards the viewer (wedge), we trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (-CH2NH2 → chain → -CH3). This path is counter-clockwise, which would normally indicate an S configuration. However, since the lowest priority group points towards the viewer, we reverse the assignment.\n*   **Conclusion**: The configuration of the rightmost chiral center is **R**.\n\nThe absolute configuration of the molecule, determined for the chiral centers from left to right, is S, R, R.\n\n<<<S, R, R>>>"
