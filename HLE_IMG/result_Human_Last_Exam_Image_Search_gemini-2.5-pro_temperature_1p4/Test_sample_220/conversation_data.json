    "To identify the correct image, we must first understand the atomic arrangement of a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal when viewed along the direction.\n\nIn an FCC structure, atoms are located at each corner of a cube and at the center of each of its six faces. When this structure is viewed along the direction (a line passing diagonally across a face of the cube), the atoms project onto a 2D plane creating a distinct pattern.\n\nThis projection results in a rectangular atomic arrangement. The basic repeating unit of this pattern is a rectangle with atoms at its four corners and another atom precisely in the geometric center of the rectangle. This is often referred to as a \"centered rectangular\" pattern. The sides of this conceptual rectangle in an FCC lattice correspond to the `[001]` and `[1-10]` crystal directions.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n*   **A:** This image shows a rectangular arrangement, but with two atoms in the center, offset from the geometric center. This does not match the expected centered rectangular pattern of the FCC view.\n*   **B:** This image clearly depicts the characteristic centered rectangular pattern. There are atoms at the four corners of a rectangle with a single atom in the middle. The 3D perspective also shows layers of atoms consistent with the stacking of (110) planes in an FCC crystal.\n*   **C:** The atomic arrangement in this image is not rectangular, which immediately disqualifies it as an FCC projection. It more closely resembles the hexagonal or trigonal symmetry seen in a projection.\n*   **D:** This image displays a simple rectangular grid of atoms without the crucial atom in the center of the rectangles. This pattern is more characteristic of a different crystal structure or a different viewing direction, such as the (100) face.\n\nBased on this analysis, image B correctly illustrates the atomic arrangement of a face-centered cubic structure when viewed along the direction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
