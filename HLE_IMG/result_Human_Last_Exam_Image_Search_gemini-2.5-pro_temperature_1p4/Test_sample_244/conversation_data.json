    "The epiphytic species in the image belongs to the genus *Frullania*. This is a type of leafy liverwort known for its distinctive appearance, often forming dark, almost black or purplish, lacy patches on tree bark.\n\nKey characteristics that help identify the genus include:\n\n*   **Color and Form:** *Frullania* species are easily recognized by their dark coloration and their flattened, branching growth that appears wiry or thread-like. They grow closely pressed against the bark of trees and shrubs.\n*   **Commonality:** The genus *Frullania* is very common and widespread, with about 800 species found in various habitats, from temperate woodlands to tropical rainforests. Observers note that dark, spot-like patches on trees are \"invariably\" *Frullania* liverworts.\n*   **Habitat:** As epiphytes, these liverworts grow on other plants without harming them, absorbing moisture and nutrients from the atmosphere. They are frequently found on the trunks and branches of trees.\n\nWhile it is challenging to identify the exact species from a photograph alone, the overall appearance is characteristic of the *Frullania* genus.\n\n<<<Frullania>>>"
