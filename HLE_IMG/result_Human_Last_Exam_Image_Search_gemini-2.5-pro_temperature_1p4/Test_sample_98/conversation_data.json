    "Based on the visual elements of the medallion and information from search results on similar artifacts, archaeologists generally ascribe this type of medallion to the **2nd century A.D.**\n\nThis dating is supported by several points:\n\n*   **Style and Subject:** The medallion features two facing busts, a common format for funerary portraits in Roman Egypt. The male figure's ram horns are an iconographic feature associated with the syncretic deity Zeus-Ammon. This representation was famously used by Alexander the Great and continued in the Roman period, particularly in Egypt, to signify divinity or divine lineage.\n\n*   **Origin:** Funerary medallions and portraits of this nature are frequently found in Roman Egypt, particularly from the Fayum region. These artifacts blend Greco-Roman artistic traditions with Egyptian funerary practices. Hoards containing similar gold medallions, some associated with Roman emperors like Caracalla, have been discovered in Egypt and date to this period.\n\n*   **Comparable Artifacts:** Several sources mention gold medallions and other funerary art with similar characteristics, such as facing portraits or depictions of deities, being dated to the 2nd century A.D. For instance, funerary portraits of women from Roman Egypt and medallions depicting figures like Medusa are often placed in this century.\n\n<<<2nd century A.D.>>>"
