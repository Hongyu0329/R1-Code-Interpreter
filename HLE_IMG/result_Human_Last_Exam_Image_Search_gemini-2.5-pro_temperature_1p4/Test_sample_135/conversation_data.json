    "Based on the style of the relief and the inscription, the author of this altarpiece detail is likely Luca della Robbia.\n\nThe artwork is a terracotta relief, a medium for which Luca della Robbia was renowned. He was an Italian Renaissance sculptor from Florence, noted for his tin-glazed terracotta statuary. The inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\" translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" which is consistent with the subject matter of the Eucharist being administered.\n\nDella Robbia created numerous decorative reliefs and altarpieces, often in terracotta. He was known for his work on the Pazzi Chapel and a commission for the Tabernacle of the Blessed Sacrament. His workshop was highly successful, producing many altars, reliefs, and architectural elements throughout Tuscany.\n\n<<<Luca della Robbia>>>"
