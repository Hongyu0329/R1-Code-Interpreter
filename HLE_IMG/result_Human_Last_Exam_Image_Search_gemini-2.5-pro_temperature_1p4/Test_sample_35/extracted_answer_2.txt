The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the V-domain of the RAGE receptor. It can be used as both an adjunct and a prognostic marker. As a prognostic marker, elevated levels of S100B are linked to the activation of neuroinflammatory and apoptotic pathways, correlating with disease severity and predicting poorer outcomes in neurological disorders. As an adjunct marker, it serves as a sensitive but non-specific indicator of brain damage and neuroinflammation, providing valuable information to supplement clinical and imaging findings.
