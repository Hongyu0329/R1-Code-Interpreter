    "To determine the time signature, we need to count the total duration of the notes within the measure for either the top or bottom staff.\n\n**Analysis of the Top Staff (Right Hand):**\n\n1.  **Beat 1:** A sixteenth rest followed by three sixteenth notes. The total duration is equivalent to four sixteenth notes, which equals one quarter note.\n2.  **Beat 2:** A group of four sixteenth notes beamed together. This is equal to one quarter note.\n3.  **Beat 3:** Another group of four sixteenth notes beamed together. This is also equal to one quarter note.\n4.  **Beat 4:** A final group of four sixteenth notes beamed together. This equals one quarter note.\n\nAdding these up: 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note = 4 quarter notes.\n\n**Analysis of the Bottom Staff (Left Hand):**\n\n1.  **Beat 1:** A chord that aligns with the first beat of the right hand. This is a quarter note chord.\n2.  **Beat 2:** A note that aligns with the second beat. This is a quarter note.\n3.  **Beat 3:** A note that aligns with the third beat. This is a quarter note.\n4.  **Beat 4:** A note that aligns with the fourth beat. This is a quarter note.\n\nAdding these up: 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note = 4 quarter notes.\n\nBoth staves contain notes that add up to the duration of four quarter notes. A time signature of 4/4 indicates four beats per measure, with the quarter note receiving one beat. This matches our analysis.\n\n<<<C>>>"
