# The task is to re-identify a specific giraffe from a set of images based on its unique coat pattern.
# This requires a visual comparison of the patterns, which function like a fingerprint for each giraffe.

# Step 1: Analyze the spot pattern of the 'Target' giraffe.
# I will focus on the area around the shoulder and the base of the neck.
# Key features in the target image include:
# - A large, dark, roughly rectangular spot just above the shoulder.
# - A U-shaped spot directly behind the rectangular one.
# - A specific series of smaller spots running up the base of the neck.

# Step 2: Compare the target pattern with each of the options (A, B, C, D, E, F).
# - Image A: Different color (lighter orange) and spot arrangement. Not a match.
# - Image B: The spot pattern, including the rectangular and U-shaped spots on the shoulder, is a precise match to the target. The color and lighting are also consistent. This is a strong candidate.
# - Image C: Different color (lighter orange) and the pattern does not match. Not a match.
# - Image D: Spots are darker and more blob-like. The key pattern is absent. Not a match.
# - Image E: The pattern is different; the spots are arranged differently on the shoulder. Not a match.
# - Image F: The pattern on the neck and shoulder area is different from the target. Not a match.

# Step 3: Conclude the identification.
# Based on the direct comparison of the unique spot patterns, Image B is the same giraffe as the Target.

# Step 4: Output the result.
# The following code will print the letter corresponding to the correct image.

correct_image = 'B'
print(f"The image showing the same giraffe as the target is: {correct_image}")
