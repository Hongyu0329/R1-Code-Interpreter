    "Based on the visual evidence provided, the prominent epiphytic species on the tree trunk is a type of lichen. I will identify its genus by analyzing its distinct morphological features.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Examine the key features of the organism in the image. It is black, grows flat against the bark (resupinate), and has a unique, intricate, branching pattern that resembles a net or the veins of a leaf (dendritic).\n2.  Compare these features to known genera of lichens and other epiphytes. The specific dendritic, black, crust-like thallus is characteristic of a particular group of lichens.\n3.  The genus that most closely matches this description is *Metamelanea*. Lichens in this genus are known for their thin, black thallus composed of radiating and branching hyphae that form these distinct patterns on bark or rock.\n4.  I will write a Python script to print this identification.\n\n```python\ndef identify_genus():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the genus of the epiphytic species based on visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The organism exhibits a black, crust-like thallus with a distinct\n    # dendritic (tree-like) branching pattern, growing flat on the tree bark.\n    # This morphology is highly characteristic of the lichen genus Metamelanea.\n    genus = \"Metamelanea\"\n    \n    print(f\"The genus of the epiphytic species in the image is likely: {genus}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    identify_genus()\n```\n<<<Metamelanea>>>"
