    Solves the insect sex identification puzzle.

    Analysis:
    In Hymenoptera (bees and wasps), males can often be distinguished from females by several features.
    The most reliable visual cues in the provided images are the antennae.
    Males generally have longer antennae than females.

    - Pair A: The left insect has longer antennae than the right insect.
      Therefore, the pair is Male, Female (M, F). This is option 3.

    - Pair B: The left wasp has long, curled antennae, a classic male trait. The right wasp has shorter, straighter antennae.
      Therefore, the pair is Male, Female (M, F). This is option 3.

    - Pair C: The left bee has extremely long antennae, a key feature of male long-horned bees. The right bee has much shorter antennae.
      Therefore, the pair is Male, Female (M, F). This is option 3.

    The correct index for each pair (A, B, C) is 3.
