    "This is a Tsume Shogi (mating puzzle). Your goal is to find the sequence of moves that leads to a checkmate against the opponent's king. The opponent's king (Gote's çŽ‹) is located at position 5a (or 51 in numerical notation). You (Sente) have a significant material advantage with powerful pieces in hand (Rook, Bishop, Gold, Silver, Knight).\n\nThe best move is **B. G\\*63**, which is to drop a Gold in the square 6c (or 63). This move initiates a forcing sequence that leads to checkmate, regardless of how the opponent responds. I will demonstrate one of the main mating lines.\n\nHere is the Python code that explains the solution by printing out the mating sequence step by step.\n\n```python\ndef explain_shogi_solution():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the best move for the given Shogi position\n    and details the mating sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    best_move_option = \"B\"\n    best_move_notation = \"G*63\"\n\n    print(f\"The best move is {best_move_option}: {best_move_notation} (Gold drop at file 6, rank 3).\")\n    print(\"This move starts a forced checkmate (tsume).\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is a primary mating sequence following this move:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(\"Coordinates are read as (file, rank), from right-to-left and top-to-bottom.\")\n\n    # Mating Sequence\n    moves = [\n        (\"1.
