    "This is a multi-step problem that involves analyzing several types of spectroscopic data to determine the structure of an unknown organic molecule. Here is my step-by-step plan for solving it:\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrum (MS) Analysis**: I will determine the molecular weight from the molecular ion peak (M+). Using the Nitrogen Rule, I will deduce the likely presence of a nitrogen atom and propose a molecular formula. I will then calculate the degree of unsaturation (DBE) to get a hint about rings or double/triple bonds.\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis**: I will identify key functional groups present in the molecule by looking for characteristic absorption bands, such as those for N-H, C-H (aromatic and aliphatic), and C=C bonds.\n3.  **¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis**: I will count the number of unique carbon environments from the ¹³C spectrum. The DEPT-135 data is crucial as it allows me to distinguish between CH/CH₃ (positive signals), CH₂ (negative signals), and quaternary carbons (no signal). This will give me a precise count of each type of carbon atom.\n4.  **¹H NMR and HSQC Analysis**: I will analyze the proton NMR for chemical shifts, integration (number of protons), and splitting patterns. The HSQC spectrum is the key to connecting the pieces, as it directly correlates proton signals with the carbon signals of the atoms they are attached to.\n5.  **Structure Assembly and Naming**: By integrating all the information gathered from the spectra, I will deduce the connectivity of the atoms to form a single, consistent structure. Finally, I will determine the correct IUPAC name for this structure.\n\nNow, I will execute this plan using a Python script that prints out the reasoning at each step.\n\n```python\ndef identify_compound():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n    The analysis is presented step-by-step.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analysis of Mass Spectrum and Molecular Formula\")\n    print(\"The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 135.\")\n    print(\"The Nitrogen Rule states that a molecule with an odd molecular weight typically contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms.
