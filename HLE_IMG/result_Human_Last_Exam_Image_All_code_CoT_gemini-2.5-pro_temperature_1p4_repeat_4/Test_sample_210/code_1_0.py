# The user wants me to identify the correct animal from the provided images.
# I will analyze the features of the target animal and compare them to the options.

# Key features of the Target Nyala:
# 1. Horn Shape: Lyre-shaped with a specific curve and light-colored tips.
# 2. Stripe Pattern: A series of thin white vertical stripes on the torso.
# 3. Spot Pattern: A very distinct, small, triangular cluster of white spots on the rear flank.
# 4. Other: Shaggy coat on neck/belly, white crest on the spine.

# Analysis of Options:
# A: Wrong horn size (younger animal).
# B: Similar, but the spot pattern is not as clearly identical as in another option.
# C: Poor image quality, cannot be confirmed.
# D: Perfect match. The horn shape is identical. The stripe pattern is identical. The unique triangular spot pattern on the flank is an exact match.
# E: Different horn curvature.
# F: One horn is broken/malformed.

# The most compelling evidence is the perfect match of the unique spot pattern on the flank and the identical horn shape between the Target and image D.

correct_option = 'D'

# The final answer is the letter of the correct image.
# No calculation is needed, just providing the identified letter.
# However, the instructions say to use the print function.
print(f"After careful analysis of the stripe patterns, spot patterns, and horn shapes, the nyala in image D is the same individual as the target.")
print(f"The final answer is: {correct_option}")
# The instruction 'Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!' seems out of place for this type of problem,
# as there is no equation. I will interpret it as ensuring the final answer itself is clearly printed.
