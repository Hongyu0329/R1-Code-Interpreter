    "Here is my plan to solve the task.\nFirst, I will identify each mineral specimen based on its visual characteristics (color, crystal habit, cleavage).\n-   **Specimen C:** Appears as a granular aggregate of olive-green crystals. This is a classic presentation of **Olivine**.\n-   **Specimen A:** Is a dark, stubby prismatic crystal. This habit is characteristic of **Pyroxene group** minerals (e.g., Augite).\n-   **Specimen B:** Is a thin, flaky, sheet-like mineral with a greenish hue. This appearance is typical for **Mica group** minerals (like chlorite or muscovite), which exhibit perfect basal cleavage.\n-   **Specimen D:** Is a translucent, six-sided (hexagonal) prismatic crystal with a glassy luster. This is unmistakably **Quartz**.\n\nNext, I will classify each identified mineral into its silicate structural group, which determines its complexity. The complexity increases with the degree of polymerization of the silica (SiO4) tetrahedra.\n-   **Olivine (C):** Nesosilicate (isolated tetrahedra). This is the simplest structure.\n-   **Pyroxene (A):** Inosilicate (single chains of tetrahedra).\n-   **Mica (B):** Phyllosilicate (sheets of tetrahedra).\n-   **Quartz (D):** Tectosilicate (3D framework of tetrahedra). This is the most complex and polymerized structure.\n\nFinally, I will order the specimens from the least complex structure to the most complex structure based on this classification. The order of increasing complexity is: Nesosilicate -> Inosilicate -> Phyllosilicate -> Tectosilicate.\n\nThis corresponds to the order: Olivine (C) -> Pyroxene (A) -> Mica (B) -> Quartz (D).\n\nThe final step is to write a Python script that codifies this logic and prints the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mineral_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies mineral specimens and orders them by increasing silicate structure complexity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify specimens and classify their silicate structure.\n    # The complexity is ranked from 1 (least complex) to 4 (most complex).\n    specimens = [\n        {'id': 'A', 'mineral': 'Pyroxene', 'structure': 'Inosilicate (Single Chain)', 'complexity': 2},\n        {'id': 'B', 'mineral': 'Mica', 'structure': 'Phyllosilicate (Sheet)', 'complexity': 3},\n        {'id': 'C', 'mineral': 'Olivine', 'structure': 'Nesosilicate (Isolated Tetrahedra)', 'complexity': 1},\n        {'id': 'D', 'mineral': 'Quartz', 'structure': 'Tectosilicate (Framework)', 'complexity': 4}\n    ]\n\n    # Print the identification of each specimen\n    print(\"Specimen Identification and Classification:\")\n    for spec in sorted(specimens, key=lambda x: x['id']):\n        print(f\"Specimen {spec['id']}: {spec['mineral']} ({spec['structure']})\")\n\n    # Step 2: Sort the specimens by their structural complexity\n    sorted_specimens = sorted(specimens, key=lambda x: x['complexity'])\n\n    # Step 3: Print the final ordered list\n    print(\"\\nOrder of increasing silicate structure complexity:\")\n    ordered_ids = [spec['id'] for spec in sorted_specimens]\n    print(\" -> \".join(ordered_ids))\n    \n    # Store the final answer in the required format\n    final_answer = \",\".join(ordered_ids)\n    print(f\"\\n<<<C,A,B,D>>>\")\n\nsolve_mineral_puzzle()\n```"
