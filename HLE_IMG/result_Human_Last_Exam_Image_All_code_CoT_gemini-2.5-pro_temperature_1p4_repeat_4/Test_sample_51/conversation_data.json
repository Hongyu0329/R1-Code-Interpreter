    "This is a challenging example of late Byzantine cursive script. By carefully analyzing the letter forms and common ligatures, the word can be identified.\n\n1.  **Breaking down the word:** The script is highly connected (ligated). We must identify the individual letters or letter-groups.\n2.  **Initial Letters (ὀφθ-):** What looks like `μωθ` at the beginning is actually a series of ligatures for `ὀφθ`.\n    *   The very first small loop is the **ὀ** (omicron with a smooth breathing mark, `psili`).\n    *   This is joined to a **φ** (phi). The combination forms an `ὀφ` ligature.\n    *   The next letter is **θ** (theta).\n3.  **Middle Letters (-αλ-):** Following the `ὀφθ` are two clear letters:\n    *   An **α** (alpha).\n    *   A **λ** (lambda).\n4.  **Final Letters (-μῶν):** The end of the word is also a ligature.\n    *   What looks like the beginning of an `ou` ligature is actually a cursive **μ** (mu).\n    *   This is followed by an **ω** (omega).\n    *   The tilde-like mark (~) above the omega serves as both the **circumflex accent** (`perispomeni`) and an abbreviation for the final **ν** (nu). This is a standard way to write the `-ῶν` ending.\n\n5.  **Putting it all together:**\n    *   **ὀφθ** + **αλ** + **μῶν** = **ὀφθαλμῶν**\n\nThe word is **ὀφθαλμῶν** (ophthalmōn). This is the genitive plural form of the common Greek noun **ὀφθαλμός** (ophthalmos), meaning \"eye\". Therefore, the word means **\"of the eyes\"**.\n\n<<<ὀφθαλμῶν>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
