# This script determines the IUPAC name of the reaction product.
# The reaction is identified as an Oxy-Cope rearrangement, a type of [3,3]-sigmatropic shift.
# The process involves three main stages:
# 1. A concerted [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of the 3-hydroxy-1,5-diene starting material to form an enol intermediate.
# 2. Rapid tautomerization of the unstable enol to a stable aldehyde.
# 3. Systematic IUPAC naming of the final aldehyde product.

# The final product is an aldehyde with a propanal parent chain.
# The substituents are determined by tracing the atoms through the rearrangement.
# - At C2 of the propanal chain: a methoxy group.
# - At C3 of the propanal chain: a methyl group and a cyclohex-2-en-1-yl group.

# The final IUPAC name, including numbering and substituent names, is constructed as follows:
product_name = "3-(cyclohex-2-en-1-yl)-2-methoxy-3-methylpropanal"
