    # 1. Analyze the riddle: "Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts."
    # This points to a 'Felt Hat' due to the use of mercury in the felting process for hats.
    
    # 2. Analyze the image: The image shows the 2019 NHL awards. The trophy is the 'Hart' Trophy.
    # The player receiving the award clearly felt emotion.
    
    # We can derive the two parts of the answer "X Y" from the image through wordplay.
    part_1 = "Felt"  # From the emotion 'felt' by the player.
    part_2 = "Hat"   # A homophone for the 'Hart' trophy.
    
    # 3. Combine the parts to form the solution. We can represent this as a symbolic equation.
    # The numbers in the "equation" will be taken from the date mentioned in the prompt: June 20, 2019.
