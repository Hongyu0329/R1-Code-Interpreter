# Step 1: Define the conversation path based on the user query.
# Q: "Hello. My department does not have lights." - This is the start of the conversation.
# A: "Thank you for calling us. You forgot to pay the bill..."
#   - "Thank you for calling us." maps to the 'Appreciation' state.
#   - "You forgot to pay the bill..." maps to the new 'Solution' state.
# The path of the representative's actions is: START -> Appreciation -> Solution -> END.

# Step 2: Get the probabilities for each transition from the diagram and the problem description.

# The probability of the first transition from START to Appreciation is given in the diagram.
p_start_to_appreciation = 0.32

# The sum of probabilities for outgoing transitions from a state must be 1.0 (or 100%).
# For the 'Appreciation' state, one outgoing transition is shown: to END with 83% (0.83) probability.
# The missing probability is the transition to the 'Solution' state.
p_appreciation_to_end = 0.83
p_appreciation_to_solution = 1.0 - p_appreciation_to_end

# The problem states the 'Solution' state has only one outgoing path to 'END'.
# Therefore, the probability of this transition is 100% or 1.0.
p_solution_to_end = 1.0

# Step 3: Calculate the total probability of the path.
# The total probability is the product of the probabilities of each step in the sequence.
total_probability = p_start_to_appreciation * p_appreciation_to_solution * p_solution_to_end

# Step 4: Round the result to 4 decimal places.
rounded_probability = round(total_probability, 4)

# Print the reasoning and the final calculation.
print("The path of the conversation is START -> Appreciation -> Solution -> END.")
print("\nFirst, we calculate the missing probability of the transition from 'Appreciation' to 'Solution'.")

print("\nNext, we calculate the total probability of the path by multiplying the probabilities of each transition:")
print(f"P(Path) = P(START -> Appreciation) * P(Appreciation -> Solution) * P(Solution -> END)")
print(f"P(Path) = {p_start_to_appreciation} * {p_appreciation_to_solution:.2f} * {p_solution_to_end}")
