# The user wants to identify the plate boundary where the longest range of the tallest mountains would form.
# 1. Tallest mountain ranges on Earth-like planets form at convergent plate boundaries, where two plates collide. On the map, these are represented by red lines with arrows pointing towards each other.
# 2. The "longest range" means we should look for the most extensive and continuous convergent boundary.
# 3. We will evaluate the answer choices based on these criteria.

# A. Kihei Plate and South Avalonia Plate: This is a convergent boundary (red line). It is a candidate.
# B. South Avalonia Plate and South Kesh Plate: This is a transform boundary (green line). Unlikely to form major mountains.
# C. North Tethys Plate and South Tethys Plate: These plates do not share a boundary.
# D. South Kesh Plate and Eurybian Plate: This is a short convergent boundary (red line).
# E. Brigantic Plate and Boreal Plate: This is a transform boundary (green line).
# F. Central Iapetus Plate and Artemian Plate: This is a complex boundary with only a short convergent section.
# G. Artemian Plate and Eurybian Plate: This is primarily a transform and divergent boundary.
# H. Goidelic Plate and Central Iapetus Plate: This is a divergent boundary (blue line).
# I. North Tethys Plate and Brigantic Plate: This is a long convergent boundary (red line).

# 4. Comparing the viable candidates (A, D, I), we are looking for the longest one.
# The boundary between the North Tethys Plate and the plates to its south (Brigantic, Goidelic, Artemian) forms the longest continuous convergent zone on the entire map.
# The specific boundary between the North Tethys Plate and the Brigantic Plate is a major part of this extensive mountain-building system and is visually longer than the other convergent boundaries listed in the choices.
# Therefore, it is the most likely location for the longest range of the tallest mountains.

explanation = "The tallest and longest mountain ranges form at extensive convergent boundaries where tectonic plates collide. On the map, convergent boundaries are shown as red lines with arrows pointing at each other. The boundary between the North Tethys Plate and the Brigantic Plate is part of the longest and most continuous convergent zone depicted, making it the most likely location for a major mountain range."
