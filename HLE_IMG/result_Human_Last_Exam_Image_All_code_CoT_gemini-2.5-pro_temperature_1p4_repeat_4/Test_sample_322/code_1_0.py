def solve_vortex_puzzle():
    """
    This function prints the solution to the 16-plot vortex puzzle.
    
    The solution is a 16-character string derived by analyzing each plot to identify
    the unique vortex. The logic is as follows:

    - Uppercase (R, G, B): The vortex has twice the strength. Its trajectory is
      typically smaller and more central, acting as a pivot.
    - Lowercase (r, g, b): The vortex has half the strength. It is typically
      "dragged along" by the other two, which form a stronger pair.
    
    The final string corresponds to the analysis of plots #1 through #16.
    """
    
    # Analysis results for each plot from 1 to 16
    # B: Blue, twice strength
    # G: Green, twice strength
    # R: Red, twice strength
    # b: Blue, half strength
    # g: Green, half strength
