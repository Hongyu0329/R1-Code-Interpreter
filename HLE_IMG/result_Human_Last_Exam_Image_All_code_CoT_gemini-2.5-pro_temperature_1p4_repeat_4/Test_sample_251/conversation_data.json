    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the ECG rhythm strip, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the time scale:** The ECG paper speed is given as 25 mm/sec. The grid on the ECG paper is composed of small 1 mm squares. Therefore, the time represented by one small horizontal square is 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n\n2.  **Identify the longest R-R interval:** By visually inspecting the entire rhythm strip, we can find the longest gap between two consecutive R-waves (the tall spikes). This pause is located in the fourth row of the strip.\n\n3.  **Measure the interval:** We'll measure the distance between the two R-wave peaks surrounding this pause by counting the grid squares. The interval spans approximately 8 large squares and 2 additional small squares. Since one large square contains 5 small squares, the total distance is (8 * 5) + 2 = 42 small squares.\n\n4.  **Calculate the duration in seconds:** We multiply the number of small squares by the time per square. The calculation is 42 squares * 0.04 seconds/square.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the constants based on the ECG strip information.\npaper_speed_mm_per_sec = 25  # The paper speed is 25 mm/sec.\ntime_per_small_square_sec = 1 / paper_speed_mm_per_sec  # Each small square is 1mm.\n\n# Step 2: Measure the longest R-R interval in terms of grid squares from the image.\n# The longest interval is in the fourth strip, spanning about 8 large squares and 2 small squares.\nnum_large_squares = 8\nnum_small_squares_in_large_square = 5\nnum_extra_small_squares = 2\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total number of small squares for the interval.\ntotal_small_squares = (num_large_squares * num_small_squares_in_large_square) + num_extra_small_squares\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the longest R-R interval in seconds.\nlongest_rr_interval_sec = total_small_squares * time_per_small_square_sec\n\n# Step 5: Print the results and the calculation steps.\nprint(\"ECG Analysis for Longest R-R Interval\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\nprint(f\"Paper Speed: {paper_speed_mm_per_sec} mm/sec\")\nprint(f\"Time per small square (1mm): {time_per_small_square_sec:.2f} seconds\")\nprint(\"\\nMeasurement of the longest interval:\")\nprint(f\"Number of large squares: {num_large_squares}\")\nprint(f\"Number of extra small squares: {num_extra_small_squares}\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculation:\")\nprint(f\"Total small squares = ({num_large_squares} large squares * {num_small_squares_in_large_square} small squares/large square) + {num_extra_small_squares} extra small squares = {total_small_squares} small squares\")\nprint(f\"Longest R-R interval (sec) = {total_small_squares} small squares * {time_per_small_square_sec:.2f} sec/square\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe longest R-R interval is: {longest_rr_interval_sec:.2f} seconds.\")\n```\n<<<1.68>>>"
