    "To determine which pattern represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction, we need to understand the theoretical projection of an FCC lattice. I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Establish the theoretical pattern:** I will determine what the atomic arrangement of an FCC lattice looks like when projected onto a plane perpendicular to the [110] direction. From solid-state physics, this projection is known to form a **centered rectangular lattice**.\n2.  **Analyze each image:** I will examine the patterns in images A, B, C, and D to identify their underlying lattice structure.\n3.  **Compare and conclude:** I will compare the pattern from each image to the known theoretical pattern for the FCC [110] view and identify the match.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through this logical process to arrive at the solution.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_fcc_projection():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the correct crystal lattice pattern for an FCC structure\n    viewed along the [110] direction by codifying the crystallographic principles.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the theoretical knowledge about FCC projections.\n    # The projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction results in a\n    # 2D pattern known as a centered rectangular lattice.
