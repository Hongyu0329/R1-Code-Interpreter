    Analyzes the VVA Consulting scenario and determines the best Knowledge Management model.

    print("Step 1: Analyze the company's needs.")
    print("VVA Consulting wants to use Knowledge Management to improve its sales process.")
    print("The sales process involves both structured assets (Sales Lists, Scripts) and human skills (Negotiation, Closing Deals).\n")

    print("Step 2: Evaluate the DIKW Model.")
    print("The DIKW (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom) model is suitable for processing structured assets.")
    print("For example: Data (VA Sales List) -> Information (Qualified Leads, Sales Scripts) -> Knowledge (Which scripts work best for which leads) -> Wisdom (Focusing marketing on high-potential sectors).")
    print("This model fits the data-driven aspect of sales improvement.\n")

    print("Step 3: Evaluate the SECI Model.")
    print("The SECI (Socialization-Externalization-Combination-Internalization) model is suitable for managing human skills and experience (tacit knowledge).")
    print("For example: An experienced salesperson's negotiation skill (tacit) is shared with a junior in a meeting (Socialization), documented in a 'Work Manual/Template' (Externalization), and learned by others (Internalization).")
    print("This model is crucial for capturing and scaling the expertise of top performers.\n")

    print("Step 4: Evaluate Bloom's Taxonomy.")
    print("Bloom's Taxonomy is a framework for individual learning and training design, not for managing an organization's collective knowledge. It is less suitable as a primary KM model for this goal.\n")

    print("Step 5: Conclude the best approach.")
    print("To comprehensively improve sales, VVA needs to manage both its data/documents and its team's expertise.")
    print("DIKW provides the framework for the data pipeline.")
    print("SECI provides the framework for sharing and growing expertise.")
    print("Therefore, using both the DIKW and SECI models together provides the most complete solution.\n")
