    "I have identified the plant based on its distinct features and confirmed its native habitat. The plant in the picture is most likely *Pittosporum coriaceum*, known for its leathery leaves with a reticulated vein pattern. This species is critically endangered and was endemic to the island of Madeira. I will now provide the Python code to print the name of this island.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the island where the plant in the image is endemic.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The plant in the image is identified as Pittosporum coriaceum.\n    # This species is endemic to the island of Madeira.\n    island_name = \"Madeira\"\n    print(island_name)\n\nsolve()\n```"

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
