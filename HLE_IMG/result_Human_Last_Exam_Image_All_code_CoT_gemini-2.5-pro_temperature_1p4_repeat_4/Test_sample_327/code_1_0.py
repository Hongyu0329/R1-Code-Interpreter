def classify_graphene_nanoribbons():
    """
    This script classifies three graphene nanoribbons based on their band structures.

    The classification logic is derived from a visual analysis of the provided image:
    1.  Ribbon 1: Shows a band gap at k=0. This is characteristic of a semiconducting (1)
        Armchair (A) nanoribbon. By counting the conduction bands (E>0), we find 7,
        so the width is N=7. Classification: A71.
    2.  Ribbon 2: Shows bands touching at E=0, k=0. This indicates a metallic (0)
        Armchair (A) nanoribbon. Counting the 5 conduction bands gives a width of N=5.
        Classification: A50.
    3.  Ribbon 3: Shows a band gap at k=0, similar to Ribbon 1. It is a semiconducting (1)
        Armchair (A) nanoribbon. Counting the 6 conduction bands gives a width of N=6.
        Classification: A61.
