    "My plan is to analyze the distinctive style and elements of the painting to identify the artist. The artwork is surreal, blending a realistic interior with impossible exterior scenes like a sea flooding a hallway and a frozen landscape outside a window. Notable objects include a hot air balloon, a picture of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and books burning in a fireplace. These surreal and detailed characteristics are strong clues. I will use this information to perform a search to identify the painter.\n\n```python\n# This script will print the name of the artist who painted the provided image.\nartist_name = \"Jacek Yerka\"\nprint(artist_name)\n```\n<<<Jacek Yerka>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Please name the artist of the following painting:\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
