    "To determine which of the four complexes are expected to show shorter lifetimes, we need to analyze their chemical stability. In light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), the operational lifetime of the emitter is often limited by its electrochemical stability, particularly its resistance to oxidative degradation.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecular Structures:** All four molecules are cationic Iridium(III) complexes. They share the same central Iridium ion and the same ancillary bipyridine ligand (4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine). They differ in the fluorination pattern of their two cyclometalating phenylpyridine (C^N) ligands.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Cyclometalating Ligands (C^N):**\n    *   **Complex 1:** The phenyl ring has two fluorine atoms at the 2' and 4' positions. Ligand: 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine.\n    *   **Complex 2:** The phenyl ring has one fluorine atom at the 4' position. Ligand: 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine.\n    *   **Complex 3:** The phenyl ring has one fluorine atom at the 2' position. Ligand: 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine.\n    *   **Complex 4:** The phenyl ring has three fluorine atoms at the 2', 4', and 5' positions. Ligand: 2-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)pyridine.\n\n3.  **Relate Structure to Stability:** The stability of these complexes against degradation is strongly influenced by the strength of the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond and the complex's overall resistance to oxidation.\n    *   Fluorine atoms are highly electronegative and act as strong electron-withdrawing groups.\n    *   Attaching fluorine atoms to the phenyl ring withdraws electron density, which strengthens the Ir-C bond and makes the complex more difficult to oxidize.\n    *   Therefore, a greater number of fluorine substituents leads to higher electrochemical stability and, consequently, a longer device lifetime.\n\n4.  **Rank the Complexes:** We can rank the complexes based on the number of fluorine atoms on each C^N ligand.\n    *   Complex 4: 3 Fluorine atoms -> Highest stability -> Longest lifetime.\n    *   Complex 1: 2 Fluorine atoms -> High stability -> Long lifetime.\n    *   Complex 2: 1 Fluorine atom  -> Lower stability -> Shorter lifetime.\n    *   Complex 3: 1 Fluorine atom  -> Lower stability -> Shorter lifetime.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The complexes with the fewest fluorine atoms are the least stable and are expected to have shorter operational lifetimes. Complexes 2 and 3 both have only one fluorine atom per ligand.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this reasoning to identify the complexes with the shortest expected lifetimes.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_complex_lifetimes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the expected lifetimes of four iridium complexes based on their structure.\n\n    The lifetime of these emitters in LECs is correlated with their electrochemical stability.\n    Fluorination of the cyclometalating ligands increases stability by making the complex\n    more resistant to oxidation. Therefore, complexes with fewer fluorine atoms are\n    expected to be less stable and have shorter lifetimes.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data for each complex: number of fluorine atoms on the cyclometalating ligand\n    complex_data = {\n        1: 2,  # 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine\n        2: 1,  # 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine\n        3: 1,  # 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine\n        4: 3   # 2-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)pyridine\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Count fluorine atoms for each complex.\")\n    for complex_id, num_f in complex_data.items():\n        print(f\"Complex {complex_id} has {num_f} fluorine atom(s) on each cyclometalating ligand.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Relate stability to the number of fluorine atoms.\")\n    print(\"Stability Ranking: Complex 4 > Complex 1 > Complex 2 ≈ Complex 3\")\n    print(\"Lifetime Ranking: Lifetime(4) > Lifetime(1) > Lifetime(2) ≈ Lifetime(3)\")\n\n    # Find the minimum number of fluorine atoms\n    min_f_count = min(complex_data.values())\n    \n    # Find all complexes with that minimum number\n    shortest_lifetime_complexes = [\n        c_id for c_id, f_count in complex_data.items() if f_count == min_f_count\n    ]\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Identify complexes with the shortest expected lifetimes.\")\n    print(f\"The minimum number of fluorine atoms on a ligand is {min_f_count}.\")\n    \n    # The final answer format requires printing the numbers in the final equation/statement.\n    print(f\"The complexes with the lowest stability and thus shorter lifetimes are those with {min_f_count} fluorine atom(s):\")\n    # Here we print each number of the final answer.\n    final_answer_str = f\"Complexes [{', '.join(map(str, sorted(shortest_lifetime_complexes)))}]\"\n    print(final_answer_str)\n\nanalyze_complex_lifetimes()\n```\n<<<H>>>"
