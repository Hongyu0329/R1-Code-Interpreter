    Analyzes the expected lifetimes of four iridium complexes based on their structure.

    The lifetime of these emitters in LECs is correlated with their electrochemical stability.
    Fluorination of the cyclometalating ligands increases stability by making the complex
    more resistant to oxidation. Therefore, complexes with fewer fluorine atoms are
    expected to be less stable and have shorter lifetimes.
