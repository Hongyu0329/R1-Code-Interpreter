    "Based on the visual evidence in the image, I can determine the location. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze Visual Clues:** The image displays a sunset over a body of water with a dark sand/pebble beach. There are evergreen trees on the far shore, and people are gathered around a bonfire on the beach. This setting is characteristic of the Pacific Northwest in the United States.\n2.  **Identify Key Features:** The most distinctive feature is the chain-link fence in the foreground, suggesting the photo was taken from an overlook, path, or road adjacent to the beach. The combination of a public beach that permits bonfires and this specific viewpoint is a strong identifier.\n3.  **Cross-Reference Location:** These features strongly match Golden Gardens Park in Seattle, Washington. The park is situated on Puget Sound and has designated fire pits for bonfires. A road and path run above the beach, separated by a chain-link fence, offering the exact perspective seen in the photo.\n4.  **Final Confirmation:** The city where Golden Gardens Park is located is Seattle. I will write a Python script to state this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_city_from_image():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the city from the provided image based on visual landmarks.\n    \n    The image features a sunset over Puget Sound, a beach with bonfires,\n    and a chain-link fence in the foreground. This combination of elements is\n    highly characteristic of Golden Gardens Park.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Golden Gardens Park is a public park in Seattle, Washington.\n    city = \"Seattle\"\n    \n    print(f\"Based on the visual evidence, the image was taken in: {city}\")\n\nfind_city_from_image()\n```\n<<<Seattle>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
