    "To determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** First, I will identify the knot from its diagram. The diagram shows a knot with 6 crossings. It is an alternating knot, meaning that as you travel along the knot, the crossings alternate between over and under. This specific diagram is a common representation of the knot known as **6_2** in the Rolfsen knot table.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula:** For any alternating knot `K`, there is a powerful formula to compute its Rasmussen invariant, `s(K)`, from any of its alternating diagrams `D`. The formula, established by Jacob Rasmussen, is:\n    `s(K) = σ(K) - w(D)`\n    where:\n    *   `σ(K)` is the **signature** of the knot, a classical knot invariant.\n    *   `w(D)` is the **writhe** of the alternating diagram `D`, which is the sum of the signs (+1 or -1) of all its crossings.\n\n3.  **Determine the Writhe `w(D)`:** I will calculate the writhe of the given diagram. The sign of a crossing is determined by convention. Using the standard convention (where an overcrossing strand slanting from top-left to bottom-right is a negative crossing), all 6 crossings in the diagram are negative. Therefore, the writhe is `w(D) = -6`.\n\n4.  **Find the Signature `σ(K)`:** The signature of the 6_2 knot is a well-known value in knot theory. From standard knot tables (like the Knot Atlas), the signature of the 6_2 knot is `σ(6_2) = -4`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Rasmussen Invariant `s(K)`:** I will now substitute the values of the signature and the writhe into the formula to find the Rasmussen invariant.\n\nThe following Python code will perform the final calculation and print out the steps.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Identify the knot and its properties.\nknot_name = \"6_2\"\n# The signature of the 6_2 knot is a known invariant.\nsignature_sigma = -4\n\n# Step 2: Determine the writhe of the given diagram.\n# The diagram has 6 crossings. By standard convention, all crossings are negative.\nwrithe_w = -6\n\n# Step 3: State the formula for the Rasmussen invariant of an alternating knot.\nprint(f\"The knot in the image is the {knot_name} knot, which is an alternating knot.\")\nprint(\"The Rasmussen invariant s(K) for an alternating knot is calculated using the formula:\")\nprint(\"s(K) = σ(K) - w(D)\")\nprint(\"where σ(K) is the knot signature and w(D) is the writhe of an alternating diagram D.\\n\")\n\n# Step 4: Substitute the values and calculate the result.\nprint(f\"For the {knot_name} knot, the signature is σ({knot_name}) = {signature_sigma}.\")\nprint(f\"The writhe of the given diagram is w(D) = {writhe_w}.\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Plugging these values into the formula:\")\n# Perform the calculation\ns_invariant = signature_sigma - writhe_w\n\n# Print the equation with substituted numbers\nprint(f\"s({knot_name}) = {signature_sigma} - ({writhe_w})\")\nprint(f\"s({knot_name}) = {signature_sigma} + {-writhe_w}\")\nprint(f\"s({knot_name}) = {s_invariant}\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
