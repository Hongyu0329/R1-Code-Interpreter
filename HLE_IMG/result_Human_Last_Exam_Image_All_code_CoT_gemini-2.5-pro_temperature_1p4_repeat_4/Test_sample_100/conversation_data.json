    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the molecular formula of the final product:\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:** I will first determine the molecular formula of the starting compound by counting the number of carbon, hydrogen, fluorine, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1:** The first reaction involves the removal of the *p*-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group from the nitrogen atom using ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN). I will calculate the change in atomic composition to find the formula of **Intermediate 1**.\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 2:** The second reaction is a catalytic hydrogenation using Pd/C and H₂. This will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond. I will add the necessary hydrogen atoms to the formula of Intermediate 1 to get the formula for **Intermediate 2**.\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 3:** The final step is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the lactam (cyclic amide). This reaction opens the ring by adding a molecule of water (H₂O). I will add the atoms from water to the formula of Intermediate 2 to determine the molecular formula of the final **Product**.\n5.  **Generate Code:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print out the molecular formula of the product, including the counts for each element as requested.\n\nHere is the python code to carry out the plan:\n```python\ndef format_formula(atom_counts):\n    \"\"\"Formats a dictionary of atom counts into a molecular formula string.\"\"\"\n    formula_str = \"\"\n    # Standard order: C, H, then alphabetical for the rest\n    order = ['C', 'H', 'F', 'N', 'O']\n    for atom in order:\n        if atom in atom_counts and atom_counts[atom] > 0:\n            formula_str += atom\n            count = atom_counts[atom]\n            if count > 1:\n                formula_str += str(count)\n    return formula_str\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product through the reaction series.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Determining the molecular formula of the final product step-by-step:\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Starting Material\n    # Structure: 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one core with a CF3 group and a PMB group.\n    # Core (C6H5F3NO) + PMB group (C8H9O) = C15H14F3NO2\n    start_formula = {'C': 15, 'H': 14, 'F': 3, 'N': 1, 'O': 2}\n    print(f\"1.
