    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to answer your question:\n\n1.  First, I will analyze the image to identify any signs of insect activity. The most prominent feature is the large, white, fuzzy growth on the branch. This is an oak gall, specifically a \"wool sower gall.\"\n2.  Galls are abnormal plant growths caused by insects, mites, or other organisms. The presence of a gall is definitive evidence of insect activity.\n3.  The insect responsible for this specific gall is a species of cynipid wasp (gall wasp).\n4.  I will then determine where this wasp lays its eggs. The female wasp initiates gall formation by laying her eggs in the plant's tissue.\n5.  Finally, I will generate a Python script to print out a clear explanation summarizing this information, stating that the evidence is the gall and the eggs are laid within the twig or bud of the oak tree.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_insect_activity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the image for evidence of insect activity and explains\n    the egg-laying behavior of the responsible insect.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Evidence of insect activity identified in the image\n    evidence_of_activity = \"a large, white, fuzzy growth known as a wool sower gall\"\n    \n    # The insect responsible for creating the gall\n    insect_responsible = \"cynipid wasp\"\n    \n    # The location where the insect deposits its eggs\n    egg_laying_site = \"the twig or leaf bud of the oak tree\"\n    \n    # Print the findings\n    print(f\"Yes, there is clear evidence of insect activity in the image.\")\n    print(f\"The primary evidence is the {evidence_of_activity}.\")\n    print(f\"This gall is created by a {insect_responsible}.\")\n    print(f\"The wasp lays its eggs by injecting them into {egg_laying_site}, which stimulates the tree to form the gall as a protective structure for the larvae.\")\n\n# Run the analysis and print the result\nanalyze_insect_activity()\n```\n<<<The wasp lays its eggs in the twig or leaf bud of the oak tree.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
