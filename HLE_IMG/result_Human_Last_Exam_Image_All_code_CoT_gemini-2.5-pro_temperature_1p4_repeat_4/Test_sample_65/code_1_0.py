# The bryophyte in the image displays several key features for identification:
# 1. It grows in a dense, interwoven mat, a typical pleurocarpous habit.
# 2. The stems have a distinct braided or plaited appearance.
# 3. This look is created by small, overlapping leaves that are all curved to one side (falcate-secund).
# These characteristics are the hallmark of the moss genus Hypnum.
