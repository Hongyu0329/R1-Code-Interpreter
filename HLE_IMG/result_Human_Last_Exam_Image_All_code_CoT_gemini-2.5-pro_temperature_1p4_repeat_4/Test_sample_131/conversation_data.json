    "To identify the alkaloid compound shown in the image, I will perform the following steps:\n1.  Analyze the chemical structure, noting its key features: a tetracyclic (four-ring) system containing two nitrogen atoms and a carbonyl group (C=O).\n2.  Recognize that the core structure is a derivative of sparteine, specifically a lupin alkaloid, characterized by the fused quinolizidine rings.\n3.  The presence of the carbonyl group within one of the rings makes it a lactam (a cyclic amide).\n4.  By comparing this specific structure, including its stereochemistry, with known lupin alkaloids, I can identify it.\n5.  Finally, I will provide the common name of this compound using a Python script as requested.\n\n```python\ndef identify_alkaloid():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the alkaloid from the provided image and prints its name.\n  The structure shown is a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid.\n  It is specifically known as (-)-Lupanine, a major alkaloid found in lupin seeds.\n  \"\"\"\n  compound_name = \"Lupanine\"\n  print(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n\nidentify_alkaloid()\n```\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
