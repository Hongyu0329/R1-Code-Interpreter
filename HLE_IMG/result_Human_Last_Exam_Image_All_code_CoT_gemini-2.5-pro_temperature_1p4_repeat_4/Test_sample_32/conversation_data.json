    "To determine the main distinguishing feature between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the query:** The user wants to know the most obvious (\"at a glance\") difference between the sporophytes of two specific moss species: *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n2.  **Botanical Research:** I will consult bryological (moss-related) information sources to compare the descriptions of the sporophytes for both species. A key part of the sporophyte is the capsule (which holds the spores) and the seta (the stalk that holds the capsule).\n3.  **Identify Key Difference:** The scientific name *curviseta* itself suggests a \"curved seta.\" I will verify if this is the primary distinguishing feature compared to *G. montana*.\n4.  **Formulate the Answer:** I will summarize the findings, focusing on the seta's shape as the main visual differentiator.\n5.  **Code Generation:** I will create a Python script that prints this explanation, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef distinguish_grimmia_species():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function prints the main difference in the sporophyte structure\n  between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n  \"\"\"\n  difference = \"The main difference at a glance between the sporophytes of Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta is the curvature of the seta (the stalk supporting the spore capsule).\"\n\n  montana_feature = \"Grimmia montana has a short, straight seta, which holds the capsule in an upright (erect) position.\"\n  curviseta_feature = \"Grimmia curviseta, as its name suggests (curvi-seta), has a strongly curved or arcuate seta. This causes the capsule to be oriented downwards or sideways (it is cernuous).\"\n\n  print(difference)\n  print(f\"- {montana_feature}\")\n  print(f\"- {curviseta_feature}\")\n\ndistinguish_grimmia_species()\n```\n<<<The primary difference is the seta (stalk). *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, holding the capsule erect, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a strongly curved seta, causing the capsule to hang downwards.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
