# The problem asks to identify the plausible geological events that could lead to the transition from Rock A to Rock B.
# Step 1: Analyze the rock sequence. Rock A is a dark, fine-grained rock, characteristic of deep, low-energy marine environments. Rock B is a lighter, possibly coarser-grained rock, suggesting a shallower, higher-energy marine environment.
# Step 2: Interpret the transition. The sequence shows a change from deeper water deposits (Rock A) to shallower water deposits (Rock B). This geological process is called a regression, which is caused by a fall in relative sea level.
# Step 3: Evaluate the given options to see which ones cause sea-level fall (regression).
# i. Onset of glaciation: Glaciation locks up ocean water in ice sheets, causing a global (eustatic) sea-level fall. This causes regression. So, 'i' is a plausible explanation.
# ii. Coastal subsidence: This is the sinking of land, which causes a relative sea-level rise (transgression). This is the opposite of what is needed. So, 'ii' is not plausible.
# iii. Global warming: This causes the melting of ice sheets and thermal expansion of water, leading to a global sea-level rise (transgression). This is the opposite. So, 'iii' is not plausible.
# iv. Decreased Mid-Ocean Ridge Activity: Slower seafloor spreading causes the mid-ocean ridges to cool and contract, increasing the volume of the ocean basins and causing a global sea-level fall (regression). So, 'iv' is a plausible explanation.
# Step 4: Combine the plausible options. The plausible events are 'i' and 'iv'.
# Step 5: Format the output as a comma-separated list with no spaces.
