    "My plan is to first visually inspect the provided graph to identify the start times of the synchronized bursts. A synchronized burst is characterized by a dense, vertical column of black dots, indicating that many electrodes are firing simultaneously.\n\n1.  **Identify Burst Timestamps**: I will scan the x-axis (Time) and estimate the starting time for each major vertical band of activity.\n    *   Burst 1: ~3 s\n    *   Burst 2: ~15 s\n    *   Burst 3: ~26 s\n    *   Burst 4: ~37 s\n    *   Burst 5: ~48 s\n\n2.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**: I will calculate the time difference between the start of each consecutive burst.\n    *   IBI 1: 15 s - 3 s = 12 s\n    *   IBI 2: 26 s - 15 s = 11 s\n    *   IBI 3: 37 s - 26 s = 11 s\n    *   IBI 4: 48 s - 37 s = 11 s\n\n3.  **Calculate the Average IBI**: I will sum the intervals and divide by the number of intervals to find the average.\n    *   Average IBI = (12 + 11 + 11 + 11) / 4 = 11.25 s\n\n4.  **Round to Two Significant Figures**: Finally, I will round the calculated average to two significant figures as requested.\n    *   11.25 s rounded to two significant figures is 11 s.\n\nI will now write a Python script to perform and display these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_average_ibi():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies burst timestamps from the graph, calculates the inter-burst intervals (IBIs),\n    and computes the average IBI, rounding the result to two significant figures.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the timestamps of the synchronized bursts from the graph.\n    burst_timestamps = [3, 15, 26, 37, 48]\n    print(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (the time between consecutive bursts).\n    intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\n    print(f\"Calculated inter-burst intervals (s): {intervals.tolist()}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the average inter-burst interval.\n    average_interval = np.mean(intervals)\n    \n    # Create the equation string for the final output\n    # e.g., \"Average Interval = (12 + 11 + 11 + 11) / 4 = 11.25\"\n    interval_sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, intervals))\n    equation = f\"Average Interval = ({interval_sum_str}) / {len(intervals)} = {average_interval}\"\n    print(equation)\n\n    # Step 4: Round the final answer to two significant figures.\n    # To format to 2 significant figures, we can use a format specifier.\n    # For a number like 11.25, two significant figures is 11.\n    final_answer = float(f\"{average_interval:.2g}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe average inter-burst interval rounded to two significant figures is: {final_answer} s\")\n\n    return final_answer\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    result = calculate_average_ibi()\n    # The final answer is wrapped in <<<>>> as requested.\n    # Note: the print statements within the function provide the step-by-step thinking process.\n    # The final print here is for the final answer format.\n    print(f\"\\n<<<{result}>>>\")\n\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts in this graph of firing activity of a neuronal culture and calculate the average inter-burst interval to two significant figures.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
