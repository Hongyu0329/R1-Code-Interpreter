    "To identify the missing reactant, we need to analyze the transformation from the intermediate product to the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **First Reaction:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Butylbenzene reacts with 2-bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of AlCl₃ to form 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. The butyl group is an ortho, para-director, and the para product is formed, which is typical due to less steric hindrance.\n\n2.  **Second Reaction:** This is a ring-forming (cyclization) reaction. The starting material is an α-bromoketone, `2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one`. The final product is a substituted imidazole, specifically `tert-butyl (2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazol-1-yl)carbamate`.\n\n3.  **Retrosynthetic Analysis (working backwards from the product):**\n    *   The imidazole ring is a five-membered ring with two nitrogen atoms.\n    *   The `C4` and `C5` atoms of the imidazole ring, along with the 4-butylphenyl substituent at `C4`, originate from the α-bromoketone (`R-CO-CH₂-Br`, where `R` is the 4-butylphenyl group).\n    *   The remaining part of the imidazole core (`N1`, `C2`, `N3`) and its substituents must come from the unknown reactant.\n    *   Let's look at the substituents on this `N1-C2-N3` fragment in the final product:\n        *   At position `N1`, there is an amino group protected by a Boc group (`-NH-C(=O)O-C(CH₃)₃`).\n        *   At position `C2`, there is an amino group (`-NH₂`).\n    *   This molecular fragment (`(Boc)NH-N-C(NH₂)-N`) points towards a substituted aminoguanidine derivative.\n    *   The required reactant is **N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine**. Its structure contains a hydrazine group (`-NH-NH₂`) attached to a guanidine core (`-C(=NH)NH₂`), with the Boc protecting group on one of the hydrazine nitrogens.\n\n4.  **Reaction Mechanism (Forward direction):**\n    *   The terminal `NH₂` group of N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbon bearing the bromine atom in the α-bromoketone.\n    *   An intramolecular cyclization occurs where a nitrogen atom attacks the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   A molecule of water is eliminated (dehydration) to form the stable aromatic imidazole ring.\n\nTherefore, the missing reactant is N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine. The following Python code will print this name.\n\n```python\ndef find_reactant():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the missing reactant in the chemical synthesis.\n    \"\"\"\n    reactant_name = \"N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine\"\n    print(f\"The name of the missing reactant is: {reactant_name}\")\n\nfind_reactant()\n```\n<<<N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine>>>"
