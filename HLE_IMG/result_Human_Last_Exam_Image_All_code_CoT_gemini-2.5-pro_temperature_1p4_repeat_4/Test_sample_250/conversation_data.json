    "This is a famous jazz standard. I will identify the title and composer based on the provided melody and chord progression. The melody is the most identifiable part of a tune, even if the chords are a reharmonization.\n\nHere is my analysis:\n1.  **Melody Analysis:** The first phrase of the melody, consisting of the notes C, G, Ab, G, is highly characteristic. This melodic line is the primary identifier for the tune \"Lady Bird\".\n2.  **Composer Identification:** \"Lady Bird\" was composed by the influential bebop pianist and composer Tadd Dameron.\n3.  **Chord Progression:** The chords in the image (F-, E-7b5, Eb-6, Dbmaj7...) represent a known, albeit less common, reharmonization of the tune, likely in the key of F minor. The descending chromatic bass line (F, E, Eb, Db) is a classic jazz harmony device. While different from the \"Real Book\" version, the melody is the definitive clue.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will provide the title and composer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_jazz_standard():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the jazz standard from the provided sheet music.\n  The identification is based on the iconic melody.\n  \"\"\"\n  title = \"Lady Bird\"\n  composer = \"Tadd Dameron\"\n  print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n  print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nidentify_jazz_standard()\n```\n<<<Title: Lady Bird, Composer: Tadd Dameron>>>"
