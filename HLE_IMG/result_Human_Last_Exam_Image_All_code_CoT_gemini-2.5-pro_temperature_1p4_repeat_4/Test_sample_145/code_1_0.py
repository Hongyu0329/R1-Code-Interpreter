    print(f"2. Ecological Fact: Harvester ant colonies (Pogonomyrmex) create and maintain these cleared discs by preventing plant growth.")
    print(f"3. Deduction: Since no sagebrush is growing in the disc, it's most likely that the ant colony was established *before* the area was seeded {age_of_left_seeding} years ago. The established colony prevented the sagebrush seeds from growing in its territory.")

    print(f"1. Observation: Sagebrush plants are encroaching on the ant mound and growing within its cleared area.")
    print(f"2. Ecological Fact: This indicates the ant colony is not able to effectively clear the existing vegetation.")
    print(f"3. Deduction: This situation occurs when a young colony gets established in an area with mature plants. The colony is not yet large or powerful enough to clear the established {age_of_right_seeding}-year-old sagebrush.")
    print(f"4. Conclusion: Therefore, the ant mound must be younger than the sagebrush, meaning it was established *after* the seeding. Its age is < {age_of_right_seeding} years.")
