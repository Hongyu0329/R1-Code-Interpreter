    "This image displays a typical North Atlantic rocky intertidal community. I can identify several species: acorn barnacles (*Semibalanus balanoides*), and at least one species of periwinkle snail.\n\n1.  **Identify Key Species:** The most conspicuous animals, besides the barnacles, are the snails. There are several dark, spiraled snails and one larger, lighter-colored one with stripes. These are all identifiable as the common periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*.\n2.  **Determine Geographic Range:** The common periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*) is native to the coasts of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean (Europe). It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the 19th century and has since become one of the most common and dominant snails in the rocky intertidal zone there.\n3.  **Compare to Pacific Coast:** While there have been a few isolated introductions of *Littorina littorea* on the Pacific Coast (e.g., in San Francisco Bay), it is not widespread and is not a characteristic species of the Pacific rocky intertidal ecosystem. The dense population seen in this photo, alongside other typical Atlantic species like the northern rock barnacle, is a definitive indicator of an Atlantic coast location.\n\nTherefore, the scientific name of the species that indicates an Atlantic setting is *Littorina littorea*.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the species that indicates the photo's location\n    and prints its scientific name.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The common periwinkle snail, Littorina littorea, is a species native to the\n    # northeastern Atlantic.
