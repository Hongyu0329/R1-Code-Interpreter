def solve_bird_identification():
    """
    This function identifies the matching bird based on visual analysis.

    Analysis Steps:
    1. The target bird displays a unique scalloped feather pattern on its back.
    2. Key features include the specific arrangement of scallops on the upper back (mantle)
       and the white edging on the wing feathers.
    3. Each option (A-I) is compared against these key features of the target.
    4. Image B exhibits a pattern on its back and wings that is a near-perfect match
       to the target's pattern, including subtle unique characteristics in the
       scallop arrangement. Other images show clear deviations in pattern,
       coloration, or lighting.
    5. Therefore, image B is identified as showing the same individual bird.
