    "My plan to identify the characters on the seal is as follows:\n1.  **Determine the Reading Order:** Traditional Chinese seals are read on the *impression* they make, not on the seal itself. The standard order for a four-character seal is top-to-bottom, then right-to-left. Since the provided image is of the seal stone, the characters are mirrored. Therefore, to read the intended phrase, we must read the characters on the seal in this order: top-left, bottom-left, top-right, bottom-right.\n2.  **Identify Each Character:** I will identify each character based on its form in ancient Chinese seal script (篆書, zhuànshū) and find its modern simplified Chinese equivalent.\n    *   **Top-Left Character:** This character has the radical '山' (mountain) at the top. This is the character `岳` (yuè), meaning a high mountain or peak.\n    *   **Bottom-Left Character:** This character has the water radical '氵' on the left side and a complex component on the right which is the seal script form of `壽` (shòu). Together, they form the character `濤` (tāo), meaning great waves.\n    *   **Top-Right Character:** This is a recognizable form of the character `長` (cháng), meaning long.\n    *   **Bottom-Right Character:** This is the seal script for `風` (fēng), meaning wind.\n3.  **Assemble the Phrase:** By combining the characters in the correct reading order, we get the phrase `岳濤長風` (Yuè Tāo Cháng Fēng). This is a poetic phrase that can be translated as \"Peaks and waves, a long wind,\" evoking a scene of grand natural power.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script to print these four simplified Chinese characters.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the simplified Chinese characters on the seal.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The four characters on the seal have been identified based on their seal script forms\n    # and the traditional reading order for seal impressions (top-to-bottom, right-to-left).\n    # On the seal itself, this corresponds to:\n    # 1. Top-left\n    # 2. Bottom-left\n    # 3. Top-right\n    # 4. Bottom-right\n\n    char1 = \"岳\"  # (yuè) - high mountain\n    char2 = \"濤\"  # (tāo) - large waves\n    char3 = \"長\"  # (cháng) - long\n    char4 = \"風\"  # (fēng) - wind\n\n    # The full phrase is 岳濤長風 (Yuè Tāo Cháng Fēng)\n    print(\"The character content on the seal in simplified Chinese is:\")\n    print(f\"{char1}{char2}{char3}{char4}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<岳濤長風>>>"
