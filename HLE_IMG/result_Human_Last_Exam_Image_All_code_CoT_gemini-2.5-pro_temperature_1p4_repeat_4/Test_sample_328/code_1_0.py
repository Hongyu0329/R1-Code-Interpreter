    Solves the nonlinear wave equation plot identification puzzle.
    
    The solution is based on a detailed analysis of the physical effects of the parameters b, c, and d,
    and a visual classification of the 16 plots into families of similar behavior.
    
    The final mapping is determined by resolving ambiguities in the visual classification
    by considering all possible parameter combinations and matching them to the observed number of plots
    in each family.
