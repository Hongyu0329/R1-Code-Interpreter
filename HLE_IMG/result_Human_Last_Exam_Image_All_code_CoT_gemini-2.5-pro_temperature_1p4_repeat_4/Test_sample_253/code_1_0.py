# Step 1: Identify the organism from the image.
# The organism is the lichen Xanthoria parietina.

# Step 2: Identify the protein.
# The protein is XPH1, a photolyase.

# Step 3: Find the protein's length from a public database (NCBI).
# A search for "Xanthoria parietina XPH1" leads to accession number AAS87053.1.
# The database record for this protein lists its length.

# Step 4: Store the length (number of amino acids) in a variable.
# The length of the XPH1 protein (photolyase) from Xanthoria parietina is 586 amino acids.
num_amino_acids = 586

# Step 5: Print the result.
# The final result is the number of amino acids.
