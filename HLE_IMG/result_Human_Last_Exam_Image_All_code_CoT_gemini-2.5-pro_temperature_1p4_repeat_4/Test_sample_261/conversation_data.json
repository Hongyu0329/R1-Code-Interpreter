    "This image is a fragment from the original United States cover of a very famous book. The illustration, by Mary GrandPr√©, depicts several key elements from the story. The full cover shows Harry Potter looking into the Mirror of Erised. To the right of the mirror's frame, the unicorn you see in the fragment is partially visible. This creature plays a significant role in the book's plot, particularly concerning the Philosopher's Stone (or Sorcerer's Stone in the US edition).\n\nTherefore, the title of the book is \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\"\n\nI will now print this title.\n\n```python\nprint(\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\")\n```\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
