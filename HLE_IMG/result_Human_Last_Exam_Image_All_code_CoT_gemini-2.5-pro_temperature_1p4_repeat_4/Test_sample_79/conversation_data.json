    "This is a fascinating find. Based on the coordinates and the distinct square shape in the desert, this is not an ancient structure but a relic from the Cold War era.\n\nMy plan to identify this structure is as follows:\n1.  First, I will convert the given coordinates from the DMS (Degrees, Minutes, Seconds) format to Decimal Degrees to make them easier to use with modern mapping tools.\n2.  I will write a Python script to perform this conversion and display the calculation, as requested.\n3.  The script will then print out the detailed identification of the structure based on these coordinates. It is a well-documented man-made object.\n4.  Finally, I will answer the question of whether it is an officially recognized historic landmark.\n\nHere is the Python script that carries out the plan:\n\n```python\ndef dms_to_decimal(degrees, minutes, seconds):\n    \"\"\"Converts coordinates from DMS to decimal degrees.\"\"\"\n    return degrees + minutes / 60 + seconds / 3600\n\n# --- Latitude Calculation ---\nlat_deg = 29\nlat_min = 6\nlat_sec = 18.75\n\n# --- Longitude Calculation ---\nlon_deg = 103\nlon_min = 47\nlon_sec = 50.28\n\n# Perform the conversions\ndecimal_lat = dms_to_decimal(lat_deg, lat_min, lat_sec)\n# Longitude is West, so it's negative\ndecimal_lon = -dms_to_decimal(lon_deg, lon_min, lon_sec)\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Convert coordinates to decimal format for identification.\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Latitude Conversion:\")\nprint(f\"{lat_deg}° + {lat_min}'/60 + {lat_sec}\\\"/3600 = {decimal_lat:.6f}° N\")\n\nprint(\"\\nLongitude Conversion:\")\n# Make the final result negative for the printout\nprint(f\"-({lon_deg}° + {lon_min}'/60 + {lon_sec}\\\"/3600) = {decimal_lon:.6f}° W\")\n\nprint(\"\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\")\nprint(\"Step 2: Identify the structure at the location.\\n\")\n\nprint(\"What is the structure?\")\nprint(\"The square object at these coordinates is a military aerial photography calibration target.\")\nprint(\"It is known as the 'Marfa Army Airfield Calibration Target' or 'Marfa Grid'.\")\nprint(\"These large, concrete targets were built by the U.S. Army Air Forces during and after World War II.\")\nprint(\"Their purpose was to allow high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft to test and calibrate the resolution and focus of their cameras.\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Is it a historic landmark?\")\nprint(\"While it is a significant historical relic from the Cold War era, it is not an officially designated national or state historic landmark. It is a point of interest for aviation and military history enthusiasts.\")\n\n```\n<<<The square structure is a U.S. Army Air Forces aerial photography calibration target from the World War II / Cold War era.
