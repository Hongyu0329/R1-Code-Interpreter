    "This image depicts a famous scene from Greek mythology, the chariot race between Pelops and King Oinomaos (Oenomaus). Here is a breakdown of the figures:\n\n1.  **The Charioteer**: This is Pelops, the hero who challenged King Oinomaos for the hand of his daughter, Hippodamia.\n2.  **The Female Passenger**: This is Hippodamia, who rides with her future husband, Pelops.\n3.  **The Winged Figure**: This is Nike, the goddess of Victory, signifying Pelops's triumph.\n4.  **The Fallen Figure**: This is King Oinomaos. In the myth, his chariot is sabotaged, causing it to crash. He is thrown from the chariot and killed, allowing Pelops to win the race and marry Hippodamia.\n\nThe question asks for the figure \"leaving the chariot.\" This most directly refers to King Oinomaos, who is dramatically shown falling from his chariot to his death.\n\n```python\ndef identify_figure():\n  \"\"\"\n  Identifies the figure falling from the chariot in the provided image of a Greek vase.\n  The scene depicted is the mythological chariot race of Pelops and Oinomaos.\n  The figure falling is King Oinomaos.\n  \"\"\"\n  figure_name = \"Oinomaos\"\n  print(f\"The figure leaving (falling from) the chariot is King {figure_name}.\")\n\nidentify_figure()\n```\n<<<Oinomaos>>>"
