# The problem asks for the four theoretically possible pairs of carbon atoms
# on the cubane product that can be substituted with a carboxylic acid group,
# based on the Favorskii rearrangement mechanism.

# As determined by analyzing the two possible ring-opening pathways for each
# of the two Î±-bromo ketone moieties in the starting material, there are
# 2 * 2 = 4 possible combinations for the positions of the two carboxylic acid groups.

# The positions from the top ketone can be C2 or C6.
# The positions from the bottom ketone can be C3 or C8.

# The four possible pairs are (2,3), (2,8), (3,6), and (6,8).
# The code below prints these pairs in the requested format.

# Define the pairs based on the analysis
pair1 = (2, 3)
pair2 = (2, 8)
pair3 = (3, 6)
pair4 = (6, 8)

# Format the output string
output_string = f"({pair1[0]},{pair1[1]}), ({pair2[0]},{pair2[1]}), ({pair3[0]},{pair3[1]}), ({pair4[0]},{pair4[1]})"

print(output_string)
