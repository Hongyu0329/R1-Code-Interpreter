    "Based on the intricate, finely divided, and overlapping leaves that give the plant a distinctive feathery or braided appearance, the bryophyte in the image belongs to the genus ***Ptilidium***.\n\n*Ptilidium* is a genus of leafy liverworts, a group of non-vascular plants. The name *Ptilidium* originates from a Greek word meaning \"small feather,\" which refers to the plant's appearance due to its deeply divided leaves fringed with cilia. This feathery or \"hirsute\" look is a key characteristic for identification.\n\nThe genus includes three species, with *Ptilidium ciliare* (ciliated fringewort) and *Ptilidium pulcherrimum* being the most widespread. These plants often grow in dense, yellow-green to reddish-brown mats on various surfaces, including soil, rocks, and trees, depending on the species. The close-up images reveal how the tightly packed, overlapping leaves and their fine, marginal teeth create the complex, woven texture that makes this genus recognizable.\n\n<<<Ptilidium>>>"
