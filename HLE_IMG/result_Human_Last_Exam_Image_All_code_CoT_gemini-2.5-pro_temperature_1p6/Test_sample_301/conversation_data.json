    "Here is my plan to identify the author of each artwork:\n1.  I will analyze each of the 9 images in the grid, starting from the top-left, moving to the right, and then row by row.\n2.  For each image, I will identify key stylistic features, the subject matter, and any visible signatures or seals.\n3.  I will use this information to determine the artist, drawing on knowledge of famous Chinese artists and their iconic works.\n4.  After identifying all nine artists, I will write a Python script that stores these names in a list.\n5.  The script will then print the list of authors, corresponding to the artworks from position 1 to 9.\n\nHere is the analysis for each artwork:\n1.  **Top-Left:** The artwork shows cartoonish fish with human faces. This whimsical and simple ink wash style is the signature of **Feng Zikai (丰子恺)**, a pioneer of modern Chinese cartoons (Manhua).\n2.  **Top-Middle:** This is a classic Chinese ink wash painting of chrysanthemums. The vigorous brushwork and the style of the red seal are characteristic of **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**, one of the most celebrated modern Chinese painters.\n3.  **Top-Right:** This ink and color painting portrays an elderly woman from an ethnic minority group. The rapid, expressive brushstrokes used to capture the figure and clothing are hallmarks of **Huang Zhou (黄胄)**, known for his depictions of life in China's frontier regions.\n4.  **Middle-Left:** This is a section from the \"Preface to the Poems Collected from the Orchid Pavilion\" (兰亭集序), the most famous work of Chinese calligraphy. The original by Wang Xizhi is lost, and this piece is the renowned \"Shenlong\" copy, meticulously traced by the Tang dynasty court calligrapher **Feng Chengsu (冯承素)**.\n5.  **Middle-Center:** This abstract painting combines geometric forms (circles representing the sun/moon) with a stylized landscape. This fusion of Western modernism and Chinese aesthetics is the distinctive style of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**.\n6.  **Middle-Right:** This calligraphy is from the \"Preface to the Buddhist Texts Translated by Xuanzang\" (雁塔圣教序). The slender, graceful, and strong strokes are characteristic of **Chu Suiliang (褚遂良)**, one of the great calligraphers of the early Tang Dynasty.\n7.  **Bottom-Left:** This is an example of \"wild cursive\" script (狂草), characterized by its energetic, fluid, and almost illegible characters. It is from the famous \"Autobiography\" (自叙帖) by the Tang dynasty monk **Huaisu (怀素)**.\n8.  **Bottom-Middle:** This highly realistic oil painting is a portrait of a young woman. It is a famous example of modern Chinese Realism and is titled \"Youth\" (青年女歌手) by **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**.\n9.  **Bottom-Right:** This painting depicts a female figure, likely an Apsara or court lady, in a style inspired by the Dunhuang murals. The elegant lines, vibrant colors, and graceful form are signatures of the master artist **Zhang Daqian (张大千)**.\n\n```python\ndef identify_artists():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the author of each of the 9 artworks.\n    \"\"\"\n    artists = [\n        \"1.
