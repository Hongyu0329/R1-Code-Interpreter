    "Based on the distinctive architecture shown in the image, I have identified the location. The image features the Grand Hall of the Pennsylvania Convention Center. The unique crisscrossing truss system and the patterned glass ceiling are signature elements of this building. Therefore, the picture was taken in Philadelphia.\n\nI will now provide a simple Python script to output the answer.\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the city where the picture was taken based on its architectural features.\n    The building in the image is the Pennsylvania Convention Center.\n    \"\"\"\n    city = \"Philadelphia\"\n    print(city)\n\nsolve_task()\n```\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    This picture was taken in 2024.
