    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to deduce the structure of the unknown compound.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Peak**: The base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum, which is assigned a relative intensity of 100%. This peak often represents a particularly stable fragment of the molecule.\n2.  **Analyze the Isotope Pattern of the Base Peak**: The relative intensities of peaks at `m/z`, `m/z+1`, `m/z+2`, etc., can reveal the presence of elements with characteristic isotopes, such as chlorine (35Cl and 37Cl) or bromine (79Br and 81Br).\n3.  **Identify the Molecular Ion Peak (M+)**: The molecular ion peak represents the intact molecule and is usually one of the peaks with the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). Its mass helps determine the molecular weight of the compound. Its isotope pattern is crucial for determining the elemental formula.\n4.  **Deduce Fragmentation Pathways**: By examining the mass differences between the molecular ion and major fragment peaks, we can infer the loss of specific neutral groups (e.g., Cl, H2O, CH3, CCl3), which provides clues about the molecule's structure.\n5.  **Propose a Structure and IUPAC Name**: Combine all the evidence from the formula, fragmentation patterns, and known chemical structures to identify the compound and provide its systematic IUPAC name.\n\nThe following Python code will perform the key calculations and logical deductions based on the provided spectral data.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef analyze_mass_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided mass spectrum data to identify the compound.\n    This function follows the step-by-step plan to deduce the structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 0: Define atomic masses for calculation\n    mass_C = 12\n    mass_H = 1\n    mass_Cl35 = 35\n    mass_Cl37 = 37\n\n    # From the provided table and graph\n    base_peak_mz = 225\n    base_peak_intensity = 100.0\n    \n    # Peaks in the base peak cluster\n    peak_227_intensity = 66.7\n    \n    # Presumed molecular ion cluster (highest significant m/z cluster)\n    m_peak_mz = 260\n    m_peak_intensity = 34.8\n    m_plus_2_intensity = 29.0\n\n    # Other significant fragments mentioned in the derivation\n    fragment_143_mz = 143\n    fragment_143_intensity = 27.8\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the Base Peak\")\n    print(f\"The base peak is at m/z = {base_peak_mz} with an intensity of {base_peak_intensity}%.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the Isotope Pattern of the Base Peak\")\n    ratio_M_plus_2 = (peak_227_intensity / base_peak_intensity)\n    print(f\"The base peak at m/z {base_peak_mz} has an isotope peak at m/z {base_peak_mz + 2}.\")\n    print(f\"The intensity ratio is {peak_227_intensity}/{base_peak_intensity} = {ratio_M_plus_2:.3f}.\")\n    print(\"The theoretical ratio for a fragment with two Chlorine (Cl) atoms is ~0.65.\")\n    print(\"The observed ratio strongly suggests the base peak fragment contains 2 Cl atoms.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Identify the Molecular Ion (M+) and Analyze its relation to the Base Peak\")\n    mass_loss = m_peak_mz - base_peak_mz\n    print(f\"The highest significant m/z cluster begins at m/z = {m_peak_mz}.\")\n    print(f\"Let's assume this is the molecular ion peak, M+.\")\n    print(f\"The mass difference between M+ (m/z {m_peak_mz}) and the base peak (m/z {base_peak_mz}) is {mass_loss}.\")\n    print(f\"This mass loss of {mass_loss} corresponds exactly to the mass of a 35Cl atom.\")\n    print(\"This implies the base peak is the [M-Cl]+ fragment.\")\n    print(\"Since the [M-Cl]+ fragment has 2 Cl atoms, the original molecule (M+) must have 2 + 1 = 3 Cl atoms.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    print(\"Step 4: Deduce the Molecular Formula\")\n    print(\"The molecule contains 3 Chlorine atoms.
