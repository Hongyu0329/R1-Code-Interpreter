    This function provides the solution to the multi-step organic chemistry problem.
    The logic is as follows:
    1. The reaction sequence involves a conrotatory electrocyclic ring opening followed by an endo Diels-Alder reaction.
    2. This sequence produces a pair of enantiomeric products.
    3. We identify the enantiomeric pairs from the options: (A,H), (B,G), (C,F), (D,E).
    4. The endo rule requires the substituents at C4 and C5 of the product to be trans. This selects pairs (C,F) and (D,E).
    5. The stereochemistry of the non-reacting quaternary center (C4 in starting material, C6 in product) must be conserved. The starting material has Me(wedge)/OMe(dash).
    6. Pair (C,F) has the correct stereochemistry at C6 (Me(wedge)/OMe(dash) in C). Pair (D,E) has the inverted stereochemistry.
    7. Thus, the correct products are C and F.
