    Solves the Wind-Scattered Epidemiological Puzzle by logical deduction.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  The plotted variable is identified as a cumulative quantity (likely C_l, cost of lost productivity),
        which is monotonically increasing.
    2.  Plots with decreasing curves (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8) must have an inverted Y-axis.
    3.  Each of the 9 plots is uniquely matched to one of the varied parameters based on its qualitative
        effect on the epidemic dynamics and thus on the plotted variable.

    The matching is performed as follows:
    - Plot 3 (no effect): Varying c_h (healthcare cost rate) does not affect the epidemic itself, so it has
      no effect on C_l. The curves are nearly identical. This corresponds to parameter c_h (12).
    - Plot 7 (scaling): Varying c_l (lost productivity cost rate) directly scales the value of C_l.
      This corresponds to parameter c_l (7).
    - Plots 4 & 5 (quarantine 'kink'): These plots show a change in slope corresponding to the quarantine
      period. Plot 5, an increasing plot, matches the increasing effect of q_f (15), the quarantine
      effectiveness factor. Plot 4, a 'decreasing' (inverted) plot, matches the decreasing effect of q_l (14),
      the quarantine length.
    - Plot 8 (weak effect): The baseline mortality rate, mu (1), is very small and has a minimal impact
      on the epidemic's cost over one year, matching the very close curves of Plot 8.
    - Plot 1 (strong decreasing effect): A longer incubation period a_i (5) slows the epidemic, reducing costs.
      This strong effect matches the wide separation in the 'decreasing' Plot 1.
    - Plot 2 (strong increasing effect): A later quarantine start q_s (13) allows the epidemic to grow much
      larger, dramatically increasing costs. This matches the 'decreasing' (inverted) Plot 2.
    - Plot 9 (strong increasing effect): A higher fraction of severe cases f_s (6) leads to a more costly
      epidemic. This matches the increasing Plot 9.
    - Plot 6 (moderate increasing effect): The final plot corresponds to the contact rate of hospitalized
      individuals, beta_h (9). It has a moderate increasing effect on costs, fitting the characteristics
      of the 'decreasing' (inverted) Plot 6.
