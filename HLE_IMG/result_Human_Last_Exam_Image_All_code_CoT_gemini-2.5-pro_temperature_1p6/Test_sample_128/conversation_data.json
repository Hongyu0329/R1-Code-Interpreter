    "This task requires identifying the product of a three-component chemical reaction. I will first deduce the reaction mechanism and the structure of the resulting product, Compound A. Then, I will write a Python script using the RDKit library to programmatically confirm the identity and calculate the properties of Compound A, such as its molecular formula and exact molecular weight.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants:**\n    *   **2-aminopyridine:** A primary aromatic amine, which is nucleophilic.\n    *   **o-phthalaldehyde (OPA):** A dialdehyde, containing two electrophilic carbonyl carbons.\n    *   **TMSCN (Trimethylsilyl cyanide):** A source of the cyanide nucleophile (`CN⁻`), especially when activated by a fluoride source like KF.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   **KF, Water:** Potassium fluoride (KF) is a catalyst that activates TMSCN by forming a strong Si-F bond, thus releasing a \"naked\" cyanide ion, which is a potent nucleophile. Water is the solvent.\n    *   **28 °C, 4 h:** These are mild reaction conditions, typical for such condensations.\n\n3.  **Propose the Reaction Mechanism:**\n    This reaction is a multi-component reaction, specifically a variant of the Strecker synthesis.\n    *   **Step 1:** The primary amine of 2-aminopyridine reacts with one of the aldehyde groups of o-phthalaldehyde to form an imine intermediate after the loss of one water molecule.\n    *   **Step 2:** The cyanide ion (`CN⁻`) attacks the electrophilic carbon of the imine bond. This forms an α-aminonitrile intermediate.\n    *   **Step 3:** The nitrogen atom of the α-aminonitrile intermediate then performs an intramolecular attack on the second aldehyde group. This is a cyclization step.\n    *   **Step 4:** The resulting cyclic intermediate (a hemiaminal) readily dehydrates, losing a second water molecule to form the stable final product.\n\n4.  **Identify Compound A:**\n    Following the mechanism, the final product is a fused heterocyclic system. The structure is **2-(pyridin-2-yl)isoindoline-1-carbonitrile**.\n\n5.  **Develop the Python Code:**\n    I will write a Python script to:\n    *   Represent Compound A using its SMILES (Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System) string.\n    *   Use the RDKit library to parse this structure.\n    *   Calculate and display its properties: name, SMILES string, molecular formula, and exact molecular weight.\n    *   To fulfill the instruction \"output each number in the final equation\", the script will explicitly show the atom counts and their isotopic masses used in the molecular weight calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# This script identifies a chemical compound formed in a reaction\n# and calculates its key properties using the RDKit library.\n\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\n    from rdkit.Chem import Descriptors, rdMolDescriptors\n    from rdkit.Chem.rdchem import PeriodicTable\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"This script requires the RDKit library to run.\")\n    print(\"Please install it, for example using: pip install rdkit-pypi\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\n# The reaction shown is a three-component condensation between 2-aminopyridine,\n# o-phthalaldehyde, and a cyanide source (TMSCN/KF).\n# This reaction is a variant of the Strecker synthesis that results in a\n# cyclized product.
