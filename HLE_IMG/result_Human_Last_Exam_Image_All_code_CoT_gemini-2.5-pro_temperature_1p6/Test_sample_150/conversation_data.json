    "Here is my plan to solve the problem. I will track the chemical transformations through the four-step reaction sequence shown in the image. For each step, I will determine the reaction type and the resulting chemical structure, which will lead me to the final product.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Benzene + Propanoyl chloride + AlCl₃**. This is a classic Friedel-Crafts Acylation. The propanoyl group (CH₃CH₂CO-) will be attached to the benzene ring, forming Intermediate-1, which is propiophenone.\n2.  **Step 2: Intermediate-1 + Br₂/FeBr₃**. This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The acyl group of propiophenone is an electron-withdrawing group and therefore a meta-director. A bromine atom will be added to the meta position of the benzene ring, forming Intermediate-2.\n3.  **Step 3: Intermediate-2 + H₂/Pd**. This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction reduces the ketone group. For benzylic ketones, this reaction often proceeds via hydrogenolysis, completely reducing the C=O group to a CH₂ group. This will form Intermediate-3.\n4.  **Step 4: Intermediate-3 + NBS/(PhCO₂)₂**. This is a radical substitution reaction. N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of a radical initiator (benzoyl peroxide) is a specific reagent for brominating the benzylic position (the carbon atom adjacent to the benzene ring). This reaction will form the final product.\n\nThe following Python code details each step of this synthesis and provides the IUPAC name for each intermediate and the final product.\n\n```python\ndef track_reaction_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function tracks a multi-step organic synthesis reaction,\n    identifying each intermediate and the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Tracking the chemical reaction sequence step-by-step:\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation\n    step1 = {\n        \"name\": \"Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation\",\n        \"reactants\": \"Benzene and Propanoyl chloride\",\n        \"reagents\": \"AlCl3\",\n        \"product_name\": \"Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one)\",\n        \"explanation\": \"The propanoyl group attaches to the benzene ring to form a ketone.\"\n    }\n    print(f\"{step1['name']}\")\n    print(f\"  Reactants: {step1['reactants']}\")\n    print(f\"  Reagents: {step1['reagents']}\")\n    print(f\"  Explanation: {step1['explanation']}\")\n    print(f\"  Product (Intermediate-1): {step1['product_name']}\\n\")\n    intermediate_1 = step1['product_name']\n\n    # Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination\n    step2 = {\n        \"name\": \"Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination\",\n        \"reactant\": intermediate_1,\n        \"reagents\": \"Br2/FeBr3\",\n        \"product_name\": \"1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\",\n        \"explanation\": \"The acyl group is a meta-director, so bromine adds to the meta (position 3) on the phenyl ring.\"\n    }\n    print(f\"{step2['name']}\")\n    print(f\"  Reactant: {step2['reactant']}\")\n    print(f\"  Reagents: {step2['reagents']}\")\n    print(f\"  Explanation: {step2['explanation']}\")\n    print(f\"  Product (Intermediate-2): {step2['product_name']}\\n\")\n    intermediate_2 = step2['product_name']\n\n    # Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation (Hydrogenolysis)\n    step3 = {\n        \"name\": \"Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation\",\n        \"reactant\": intermediate_2,\n        \"reagents\": \"H2/Pd\",\n        \"product_name\": \"1-(3-bromophenyl)propane\",\n        \"explanation\": \"The benzylic ketone C=O group is completely reduced to a CH2 group.\"\n    }\n    print(f\"{step3['name']}\")\n    print(f\"  Reactant: {step3['reactant']}\")\n    print(f\"  Reagents: {step3['reagents']}\")\n    print(f\"  Explanation: {step3['explanation']}\")\n    print(f\"  Product (Intermediate-3): {step3['product_name']}\\n\")\n    intermediate_3 = step3['product_name']\n\n    # Step 4: Radical Benzylic Bromination\n    step4 = {\n        \"name\": \"Step 4: Radical Benzylic Bromination\",\n        \"reactant\": intermediate_3,\n        \"reagents\": \"NBS, (PhCO2)2, CCl4\",\n        \"product_name\": \"1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane\",\n        \"explanation\": \"NBS selectively brominates the benzylic position (carbon 1 of the propane chain).\"\n    }\n    print(f\"{step4['name']}\")\n    print(f\"  Reactant: {step4['reactant']}\")\n    print(f\"  Reagents: {step4['reagents']}\")\n    print(f\"  Explanation: {step4['explanation']}\")\n    print(f\"  Final Product: {step4['product_name']}\\n\")\n    final_product = step4['product_name']\n\n    print(\"---CONCLUSION---\")\n    print(f\"The name of the final product is: {final_product}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    track_reaction_sequence()\n```\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
