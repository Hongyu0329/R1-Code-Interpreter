    This function analyzes the chemical reaction provided and identifies the major products A and B.
    The reaction is the iron(III) triflate catalyzed reaction of styrene with tert-butyl peroxybenzoate.

    Method:
    1. The reaction is an iron-catalyzed vicinal difunctionalization of an alkene.
    2. The peroxide (C6H5-COO-O-tBu) generates a tert-butoxyl radical (tBuO*) and a benzoyloxy radical (PhCOO*).
    3. These radicals add to styrene, leading to two regioisomeric products, A and B.
    """

    # --- Product Identification ---

    # Addition of tBuO* radical first, followed by trapping with the benzoyloxy group.
