    print("\nStep 2: Chelation-Directed Nucleophilic Attack (uses remaining equivalents)")
    print("The magnesium of the alkoxide chelates (coordinates) to the nearby oxygen of the benzodioxole ring.")

    print("The attack by CH3- causes the cleavage of the distal C-O bond of the benzodioxole ring.")
    print("The methyl group (CH3) and the methylene group (CH2) combine to form an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).")

    print("A: Incorrect. Benzyl ethers are not cleaved by Grignard reagents under these conditions.")
    print("B: Incorrect. Ignores the nucleophilic addition of the CH3- group.")
    print("C: Incorrect. Proposes a less favorable intramolecular attack leading to a strained ring.")
    print("D: Incorrect. Predicts the wrong regiochemistry (cleavage of the wrong C-O bond).")
