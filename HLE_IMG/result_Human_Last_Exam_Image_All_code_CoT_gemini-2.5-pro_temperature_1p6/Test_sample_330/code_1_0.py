    This function determines the six-character string corresponding to the six simulations.
    Based on visual analysis of the provided plots and knowledge of dynamical systems, the following deductions are made:

    - Plot 1 is the baseline 'initial simulation' (0). It shows a typical chaotic attractor.
    - Plot 2 shows a much larger and more chaotic attractor, characteristic of a doubled Rayleigh number (R).
    - Plot 3 has an attractor shape nearly identical to Plot 1, which indicates a change in the initial condition (Z0), not a system parameter. The code for this is (Z).
    - Plot 4 exhibits slower oscillations, which is the effect of halving the Prandtl number (p).
    - Plot 5 shows the dynamics decaying to a fixed point, which means chaos is suppressed. This is caused by halving the Rayleigh number (r).
    - Plot 6 displays strong synchronization between the two systems (blue and orange curves), which points to a doubled Biot number (B), increasing the coupling.

    Combining these findings in order of the plots (1 through 6) gives the final string.
