def solve_airfoil_matching():
    """
    This function prints the final solution for the airfoil matching problem.
    The logic for the solution is as follows:

    1.  Airfoils are categorized into 'thin' (A, B, C, D) and 'thick' (E, F, G, H).
    2.  Cp plots are categorized based on the leading-edge suction peak magnitude, which relates to thickness.
        Plots {1, 2, 5, 8} correspond to thin airfoils.
        Plots {3, 4, 6, 7} correspond to thick airfoils.
    3.  Within each group, airfoils are matched to plots based on camber, which correlates with lift (the area of the Cp plot).
    
    Matching a_symmetrical_airfoil:
    - Airfoil D is symmetrical. Its pressure distribution at a positive angle of attack is characteristic, matching Plot 2.
    - So, D -> 2.

    Matching a_thin_cambered_airfoils:
    - Camber order: A < B < C.
    - Expected lift order: Lift(A) < Lift(B) < Lift(C).
    - Cp plot area order (for remaining thin plots): Area(8) < Area(1) < Area(5).
    - So, A -> 8, B -> 1, C -> 5.

    Matching thick airfoils:
    - Airfoil G is thickest with the most camber, expecting the highest lift. Plot 6 has the largest area. So, G -> 6.
    - Airfoil E has the lowest camber of the thick group, expecting the lowest lift. Plot 4 has the smallest area in this group. So, E -> 4.
    - Remaining are F, H and plots 3, 7. Airfoil H has reflex camber, reducing its lift compared to F. Plot 3 has less area (lift) than plot 7.
    - So, H -> 3 and F -> 7.

    Final Sequence (A-H): 8, 1, 5, 2, 4, 7, 6, 3
