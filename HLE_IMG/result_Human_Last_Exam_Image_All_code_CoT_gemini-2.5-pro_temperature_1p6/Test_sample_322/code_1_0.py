def solve_vortex_trajectories():
    """
    This function returns the 16-letter sequence corresponding to the analysis
    of the vortex trajectory plots.

    The analysis is based on identifying the unique vortex in each plot:
    - A vortex with twice the strength (R, G, B) acts as a central 'anchor' with a smaller orbit.
    - A vortex with half the strength (r, g, b) is advected by or tossed around chaotically
      by the other two stronger vortices.
