    "To calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we first need to calculate the total relative VMT for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios. The VMT for each trip distance segment is calculated by multiplying the share of total trips in that segment by the share of trips made by car in that segment, and then by the average distance of that segment.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Extract Data**: Gather the necessary data from both tables for each of the four distance categories (0-3, 3-5, 5-10, 10+ miles):\n    *   Share of total trips for each distance category.\n    *   Average trip distance for each category.\n    *   The mode share for both car categories (\"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\") for both Baseline and Proposed scenarios.\n\n2.  **Calculate Total Car Share**: For each distance category in both scenarios, sum the mode shares of the two car categories to get the total percentage of trips made by car.\n\n3.  **Calculate VMT for Baseline Scenario**:\n    *   For each distance category, calculate its contribution to the total VMT: `(Share of Total Trips) * (Total Car Share for Baseline) * (Average Trip Distance)`.\n    *   Sum the VMT contributions from all four distance categories to get the total relative VMT for the Baseline scenario.\n\n4.  **Calculate VMT for Proposed Scenario**:\n    *   Repeat the same calculation as in step 3, but use the \"Total Car Share for Proposed\" values.\n    *   Sum the VMT contributions from all four distance categories to get the total relative VMT for the Proposed scenario.\n\n5.  **Calculate Percentage Reduction**: Use the calculated VMT values for the Baseline and Proposed scenarios to find the percentage reduction using the formula:\n    `Percentage Reduction = ((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100`\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_vmt_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage reduction in Car VMT from a Baseline to a Proposed scenario.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Common data for both scenarios from the tables\n    share_of_total_trips = np.array([0.48, 0.22, 0.14, 0.16])\n    avg_trip_distance = np.array([1, 4, 7.5, 20])\n    distance_labels = [\"0-3 miles\", \"3-5 miles\", \"5-10 miles\", \"10+ miles\"]\n\n    # --- Baseline Scenario Data ---\n    # Mode share for 'car, 1 occupant'\n    baseline_car_1_occ = np.array([0.25, 0.38, 0.40, 0.42])\n    # Mode share for 'car, with more than 2 occupants'\n    baseline_car_multi_occ = np.array([0.28, 0.43, 0.45, 0.47])\n    # Total car share is the sum of the two car modes\n    baseline_total_car_share = baseline_car_1_occ + baseline_car_multi_occ\n\n    # --- Proposed Scenario Data ---\n    # Mode share for 'car, 1 occupant'\n    proposed_car_1_occ = np.array([0.01, 0.08, 0.14, 0.16])\n    # Mode share for 'car, with more than 2 occupants'\n    proposed_car_multi_occ = np.array([0.02, 0.19, 0.27, 0.33])\n    # Total car share is the sum of the two car modes\n    proposed_total_car_share = proposed_car_1_occ + proposed_car_multi_occ\n\n    # --- Calculations ---\n    # VMT is proportional to: Share of Trips * Car Mode Share * Average Distance\n    baseline_vmt_by_segment = share_of_total_trips * baseline_total_car_share * avg_trip_distance\n    proposed_vmt_by_segment = share_of_total_trips * proposed_total_car_share * avg_trip_distance\n\n    total_baseline_vmt = np.sum(baseline_vmt_by_segment)\n    total_proposed_vmt = np.sum(proposed_vmt_by_segment)\n\n    # Percentage reduction calculation\n    vmt_reduction_percentage = ((total_baseline_vmt -
