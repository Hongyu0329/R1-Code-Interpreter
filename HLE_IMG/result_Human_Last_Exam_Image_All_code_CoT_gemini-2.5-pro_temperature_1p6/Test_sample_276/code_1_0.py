    print("Rationale for Diagnosis:")
    print("1. Patient Profile and Symptoms: The patient is a 67-year-old female with a one-month history of chronic symptoms including low-grade fever, weight loss, fatigue, and diarrhea. This points towards a chronic inflammatory or neoplastic process.")
    print("2. Key Medical History: The patient has a history of uveitis and arthritis. These are classic extra-intestinal manifestations strongly associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).")
    print("3. Exam and Laboratory Findings: Right hemiabdomen tenderness, leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count at 13,000), and a positive fecal occult blood test all indicate active inflammation and bleeding within the gastrointestinal tract, localized to the right side.")
    print("4. Imaging Findings: The abdominal CT scan reveals significant circumferential wall thickening of the bowel in the ileocecal region (right lower quadrant), which is the most common site of involvement for Crohn's Disease.")
    print("5. Synthesis: Crohn's Disease is the most likely diagnosis as it provides a single, unifying explanation for all the patient's findings: the chronic constitutional and gastrointestinal symptoms, the localization of the disease to the ileocecal area, the classic CT appearance, and, most importantly, the associated extra-intestinal manifestations of uveitis and arthritis.")
    print("\nOther possibilities like Ileocecal Tuberculosis or Lymphoma are less likely because they do not typically explain the pre-existing uveitis and arthritis. Acute infections are inconsistent with the one-month timeline.")
    print("\nFinal Answer Choice: A. Crohn's Disease")
