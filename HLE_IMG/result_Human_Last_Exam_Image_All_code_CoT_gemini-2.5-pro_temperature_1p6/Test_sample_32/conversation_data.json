    "This is a biological identification question. The main difference lies in the structure that holds the capsule. I will provide a Python script to print the explanation.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will research the sporophyte characteristics of both *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* using botanical resources.\n2.  The key difference I've found relates to the seta, which is the stalk that supports the spore-containing capsule.\n3.  *Grimmia montana* has a short, straight seta, which results in an erect capsule that sits upright among the leaves.\n4.  *Grimmia curviseta*, as its name implies (\"curved seta\"), has a strongly curved or S-shaped (cygneous) seta. This causes its capsule to nod or hang downwards, often asymmetrically.\n5.  This difference in capsule orientation (erect vs. nodding) is the most obvious feature to distinguish them at a glance when sporophytes are present.\n6.  I will write a Python script to print this information clearly.\n\n```python\ndef print_distinguishing_feature():\n  \"\"\"\n  Explains the main visual difference in the sporophyte stage between\n  Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n  \"\"\"\n  species1 = \"Grimmia montana\"\n  feature1 = \"a short, straight seta (stalk)\"\n  result1 = \"an erect, upright capsule immersed among the leaves\"\n\n  species2 = \"Grimmia curviseta\"\n  feature2 = \"a strongly curved, S-shaped seta\"\n  result2 = \"a nodding or hanging capsule\"\n\n  print(\"The main difference in the sporophyte used to distinguish Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta at a glance is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule).\\n\")\n  print(f\"- {species1} has {feature1}, which results in {result1}.\")\n  print(f\"- {species2} has {feature2}, which results in {result2}.\")\n  print(\"\\nIn summary: Look for an erect capsule (G. montana) versus a nodding/hanging capsule (G. curviseta).\")\n\nprint_distinguishing_feature()\n```\n<<<The main difference is that *Grimmia montana* has an erect capsule on a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a nodding or hanging capsule on a distinctly curved seta.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta that helps distinguish both species at a glance?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
