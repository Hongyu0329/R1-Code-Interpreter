    "To determine the poetic form, I will analyze the structure of the text provided. The most common way to define a poetic form is by its meter or its syllable count per line.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Use the information given in the prompt to identify the text of the last two lines of the four-line stanza.\n2.  Count the number of syllables in each of these two lines. I will do this by breaking down each word into its component syllables.\n3.  Display the calculation for the syllable count of each line.\n4.  Examine the resulting sequence of syllable counts for any recognizable mathematical or poetic pattern.\n5.  Based on the pattern, identify and name the specific poetic form. The Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...), is a known pattern used in poetry.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef find_poetic_form():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the poetic form by analyzing the syllable count of the given lines.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the structure of the poem's lines...\\n\")\n\n    # According to the prompt, the third line is from the image, \n    # and the final line is also given.\n    # Line 3: \"ghostly velum forms like a dance\"\n    # Line 4: \"nacreous wavers\"\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Create a breakdown of each line with its syllable count per word.\n    # Using an OrderedDict to maintain the order of words for printing.\n    line_3_word_syllables = collections.OrderedDict([\n        (\"ghost-ly\", 2),\n        (\"vel-um\", 2),\n        (\"forms\", 1),\n        (\"like\", 1),\n        (\"a\", 1),\n        (\"dance\", 1)\n    ])\n    \n    line_4_word_syllables = collections.OrderedDict([\n        (\"na-cre-ous\", 3),\n        (\"wa-vers\", 2)\n    ])\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate and display the total syllables for Line 3.\n    syllables_line_3 = sum(line_3_word_syllables.values())\n    calculation_string_3 = \" + \".join(map(str, line_3_word_syllables.values()))\n    print(\"Syllable count for Line 3 ('ghostly velum forms like a dance'):\")\n    # As requested, printing each number in the final equation\n    print(f\"The sum of syllables is: {calculation_string_3} = {syllables_line_3}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate and display the total syllables for Line 4.\n    syllables_line_4 = sum(line_4_word_syllables.values())\n    calculation_string_4 = \" + \".join(map(str, line_4_word_syllables.values()))\n    print(\"Syllable count for Line 4 ('nacreous wavers'):\")\n    # As requested, printing each number in the final equation\n    print(f\"The sum of syllables is: {calculation_string_4} = {syllables_line_4}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 4 & 5: Analyze the pattern and conclude.\n    fibonacci_sequence = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]\n    print(f\"The syllable counts for the third and fourth lines are {syllables_line_3} and {syllables_line_4}.\")\n    print(f\"Let's compare this to the Fibonacci sequence: {fibonacci_sequence}...\")\n    \n    if syllables_line_3 in fibonacci_sequence and syllables_line_4 in fibonacci_sequence:\n        print(f\"\\nBoth syllable counts, {syllables_line_4} and {syllables_line_3}, are consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.\")\n        print(\"A poem where the syllable count of the lines follows this sequence is called a 'Fibonacci poem' or 'Fib'.\")\n        print(\"\\nConclusion: The text adheres to the form of a Fibonacci poem.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nThe syllable counts do not correspond to a standard poetic form based on this analysis.\")\n\nfind_poetic_form()\n```\n<<<Fibonacci poem"
