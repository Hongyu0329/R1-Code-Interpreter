The insect in the image is a type of lanternfly. Key features include:
- Pinkish-grey forewings with black spots.
- Bright red/pink hindwings that are partially visible.
- The hindwings have two distinct, wide, horizontal black bands, and black tips.
- The head is blunt, lacking the long "snout" of some other lanternfly genera."""

These features, especially the bold banding on the hindwings, are characteristic of Lycorma meliae, 
the chinaberry-tree lantern fly. This is a different species from the more widely known invasive 
Spotted Lanternfly, Lycorma delicatula, which has spots on its hindwings, not bands."""

To choose between Luodong and Hengchun, we consider the context of an entomological
'collecting trip'. Hengchun is located at the southern tip of Taiwan and is the gateway
to Kenting National Park, a major national park renowned for its rich biodiversity.
A collecting trip is more likely to be centered around such a protected, biodiverse area.
Therefore, Hengchun is the most likely of the two options."""
