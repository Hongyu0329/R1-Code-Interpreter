    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, I will identify all the molecules depicted in the image. The image shows a chemical reaction with two reactants and one product. I will determine the chemical structure of these three molecules and represent them using SMILES strings.\n2.  Next, I need to identify which of these molecules satisfy the condition \"Crippen logP > 1\". To do this, I will use the RDKit library in Python to calculate the Crippen logP value for each of the three molecules.\n3.  The main task is to calculate the \"Sum of Eccentric Connectivity Indices\" for the molecule(s) that meet the logP criterion. The Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI) for a single molecule is calculated as the sum of products of vertex degree and eccentricity for each atom in the molecular graph, including hydrogens. The formula is ECI = Î£(v_i * e_i), where v_i is the degree of atom i and e_i is its eccentricity (the maximum shortest path distance from atom i to any other atom).\n4.  If multiple molecules satisfy the logP > 1 condition, the \"Sum of Eccentric Connectivity Indices\" will be interpreted as the sum of the individual ECI values for each of those molecules.\n5.  Finally, I will write a Python script that performs these calculations. The script will:\n    *   Take the SMILES strings of the three molecules.\n    *   Calculate their logP values and filter them.\n    *   For each filtered molecule, add explicit hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Compute the all-pairs shortest path (distance) matrix.\n    *   Iterate through each atom to find its degree (v_i) and eccentricity (e_i).\n    *   Calculate the product v_i * e_i for each atom.\n    *   The script will print the full equation showing the sum of all these v_i * e_i terms, as requested.\n    *   The final result will be the total sum.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport subprocess\n\n# Function to install a package using pip\ndef install(package):\n    subprocess.check_call([sys.executable, \"-m\", \"pip\", \"install\", package])\n\n# Try to import rdkit, and install it if it's not found\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\n    from rdkit.Chem import Crippen\n    import numpy as np\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"RDKit not found.
