    "To determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair, I will examine their key morphological features. In many bee and wasp species (Order Hymenoptera), males and females can be distinguished by characteristics such as antennae length and shape, number of abdominal segments, and the shape of the tip of the abdomen.\n\n**Pair A:** These are cuckoo bees.\n*   **A-left:** This bee has a distinctly pointed abdomen, which is characteristic of a female's stinger apparatus.\n*   **A-right:** This bee has a blunter, more rounded abdominal tip, which is characteristic of a male.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The pair is Female, Male (F, M), corresponding to index **4**.\n\n**Pair B:** These are paper wasps.\n*   **B-left:** This wasp has straight antennae. In this group, straight antennae are characteristic of females.\n*   **B-right:** This wasp has antennae that are distinctly curled at the tips. This is a definitive trait of male paper wasps.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The pair is Female, Male (F, M), corresponding to index **4**.\n\n**Pair C:** These appear to be long-horned bees.\n*   **C-left:** This bee has exceptionally long antennae, a hallmark characteristic of males in this group (hence the name \"long-horned bees\").\n*   **C-right:** This bee has much shorter, more typical-looking antennae, which is characteristic of a female.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** The pair is Male, Female (M, F), corresponding to index **3**.\n\nCombining these results, the indices for A, B, and C are 4, 4, and 3, respectively.\n\n```python\n# The plan is to determine the index for each pair based on morphological differences.\n# Pair A: The left insect has a pointed abdomen (female), the right one has a blunt tip (male). This is F, M -> index 4.\n# Pair B: The left insect has straight antennae (female), the right one has curled antennae (male). This is F, M -> index 4.\n# Pair C: The left insect has very long antennae (male), the right one has short antennae (female). This is M, F -> index 3.\n\n# Assigning the identified indices to variables.\nanswer_A = 4\nanswer_B = 4\nanswer_C = 3\n\n# Printing the final answer in the requested format.\nprint(f\"{answer_A}, {answer_B}, {answer_C}\")\n```\n<<<4, 4, 3>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
