    "This is an identification task. I will first analyze the provided chemical structure to determine its key features and then use this information to identify the compound's name.\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure**: The image displays a complex organic molecule. It has a tetracyclic (four-ring) fused system.\n2.  **Identify functional groups and key atoms**: There are two nitrogen atoms integrated into the ring system, making it a diamine. There is also a carbonyl group (C=O) as part of one of the rings, which means it is a lactam (a cyclic amide) or a ketone. Given the ring structure, it is a lactam. This class of compounds containing nitrogen in a heterocyclic ring, derived from plants, are known as alkaloids.\n3.  **Identify the parent scaffold**: The core structure is based on a quinolizidine skeleton. This is a characteristic of lupin alkaloids.\n4.  **Search and Identify**: A search for tetracyclic lupin alkaloids containing a lactam group reveals that the specific structure shown, with its particular stereochemistry (indicated by the wedged and dashed bonds), is known as Lupanine.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print the name of this compound.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the name of the alkaloid compound shown in the image.\ncompound_name = \"Lupanine\"\nprint(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n```\n<<<Lupanine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
