    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find a point around which the tiling can be rotated by a certain angle (less than 360 degrees) and appear unchanged.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  **Identify a repeating motif:** The pattern has prominent star-like motifs. Let's focus on one of these.\n2.  **Analyze the center of the motif:** At the very center of each star, there is a dark blue, regular heptagon (a polygon with 7 sides).\n3.  **Count the repeating elements around the center:** This central heptagon is surrounded by 7 light yellow pentagons and 7 orange rhombi, arranged symmetrically. This arrangement of shapes creates the 7 \"points\" of the star.\n4.  **Determine the order of symmetry:** Since the motif repeats 7 times around a central point, rotating the entire tiling by 360 / 7 degrees around the center of the heptagon will map the pattern onto itself. This means the tiling has 7-fold rotational symmetry.\n5.  **Write the code:** The Python code will state this conclusion and print the calculation for the angle of rotation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and explains the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The order of rotational symmetry is determined by counting the number of times\n    # a motif repeats around a central point.\n    # By observing the star-like patterns, we can see a central heptagon (7-sided polygon)\n    # with 7 arms radiating from it.\n    order_of_symmetry = 7\n    \n    # The angle of rotation is 360 degrees divided by the order of symmetry.\n    angle = 360 / order_of_symmetry\n    \n    print(f\"The tiling has a rotational symmetry of order {order_of_symmetry}.\")\n    print(\"This can be seen by focusing on one of the central star-shaped motifs.\")\n    print(\"The motif repeats itself 7 times around a central point.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, rotating the tiling by the following angle leaves it unchanged:\")\n    print(f\"360 / {order_of_symmetry} = {angle:.2f} degrees\")\n\nsolve_symmetry()\n```\n<<<7>>>"
