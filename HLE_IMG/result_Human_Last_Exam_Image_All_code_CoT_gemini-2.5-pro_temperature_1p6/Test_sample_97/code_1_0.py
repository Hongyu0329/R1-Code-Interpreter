# So, its radius is its center's y-coordinate.

# From "A yellow circle is exactly in the middle of its two neighbors" and the fact that adjacent white circles touch,
# we can deduce the white circle's radius (r_w).
# The x-center of the first white circle is r_w. The second is 3*r_w. The yellow circle is in between.
