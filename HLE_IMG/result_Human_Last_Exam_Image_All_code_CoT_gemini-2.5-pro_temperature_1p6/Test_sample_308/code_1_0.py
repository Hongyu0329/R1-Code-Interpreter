This is characteristic of Configuration 3, whose two-lobed driver and special concave follower are designed for this dwell-and-return action.",
        'B': "Plot B displays six highly regular, smooth oscillations. This suggests a combination of two very regular shapes. Configuration 2, with its six-fold symmetric driver (rounded hexagon) and three-fold symmetric driven roller (Reuleaux triangle), produces exactly this kind of consistent six-cycle variation (LCM of 6 and 3 is 6).",
        'C': "Plot C exhibits four oscillations with sharp, significant variations in speed. This points to a four-lobed driver. Configuration 4 has a four-lobed driver and a two-lobed follower. The sharp, pointed features on both rollers explain the large and abrupt changes in the plot's slope.",
        'D': "Plot D shows a very complex pattern with six high-frequency oscillations and extreme speed variation (very steep sections). This corresponds to Configuration 1, which combines a six-lobed driver with a spiky three-lobed follower. The 'spikes' on the follower (small radius) cause moments of extremely high speed.",
        'E': "Plot E shows four smooth, gentle oscillations. This, like C, indicates a four-lobed driver. However, Configuration 6 features much smoother, more rounded shapes than Configuration 4. This results in the smoother, less extreme speed variations depicted in plot E.",
        'F': "Plot F is unique in showing five distinct oscillations per period. This immediately identifies its driver as having five lobes. Configuration 7 is the only one with a five-lobed driver, making this a direct match.",
        'G': "Plot G shows three clear oscillations per period. This points to a driver with three-fold symmetry. Configuration 8 has a prominent three-lobed driver, which directly causes the three-cycle speed variation seen in the plot.",
        'H': "Plot H displays a six-oscillation pattern that is more complex than B's. It appears as three major waves, each with a smaller ripple. This profile is generated by Configuration 5, which combines a six-lobed driver and a three-lobed follower. The shapes are smoother than in Configuration 1 (matching H's smoother curve vs. D) but less regular than in Configuration 2 (matching H's complexity vs. B's regularity)."
