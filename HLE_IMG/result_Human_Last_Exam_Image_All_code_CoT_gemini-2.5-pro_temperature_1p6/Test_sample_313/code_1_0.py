    # The riddle has two parts. The answer must satisfy both.
    
    # Part 1: "X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019."
    # Analysis of the image reveals two men wearing formal suits. Suit jackets,
    # especially in the collar area, often use felt for structure.
    # Thus, the textile 'Felt' is present in the picture.
    
    # Part 2: "Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts."
    # This refers to the historical use of mercury nitrate in the felt-making industry.
    # This process, known as carroting, was used to manufacture felt for hats and was
    # discontinued because it caused mercury poisoning among workers (hatters).
    
    # Conclusion: The word that connects both clues is "Felt".
    xy_answer = "Felt"
