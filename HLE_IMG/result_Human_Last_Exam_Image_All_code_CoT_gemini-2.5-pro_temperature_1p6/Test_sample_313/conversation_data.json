    "My plan is to solve the two-part riddle to identify \"X Y\".\n\n1.  **Analyze the first clue:** The first clue states, \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019,\" and provides an image. The image shows two men in formal suits at an awards ceremony. A key component in the construction of high-quality suit jackets is felt, which is often placed under the collar to provide shape and stability. Therefore, \"Felt\" is an object pictured at the event.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second clue:** The second clue is, \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This points to a specific historical industrial process. For centuries, mercury nitrate was used in a process called \"carroting\" to make felt from animal fur for hats. This process was highly toxic and caused mercury poisoning in hatmakers, giving rise to the expression \"mad as a hatter.\" Due to its toxicity, this method of producing felt is no longer used.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the clues:** The word \"Felt\" is the common link between both clues. The \"Felt\" in the first clue is the modern textile present in the suits. The \"another Felt\" in the second clue is the obsolete, mercury-treated felt used in old-fashioned hat making.\n\nI will write a Python script to print this explanation and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning behind solving the provided riddle.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The riddle has two parts. The answer must satisfy both.\n    \n    # Part 1: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n    # Analysis of the image reveals two men wearing formal suits. Suit jackets,\n    # especially in the collar area, often use felt for structure.\n    # Thus, the textile 'Felt' is present in the picture.\n    \n    # Part 2: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n    # This refers to the historical use of mercury nitrate in the felt-making industry.\n    # This process, known as carroting, was used to manufacture felt for hats and was\n    # discontinued because it caused mercury poisoning among workers (hatters).\n    \n    # Conclusion: The word that connects both clues is \"Felt\".\n    xy_answer = \"Felt\"\n    \n    print(f\"The entity 'X Y' that fits both clues is: {xy_answer}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Felt>>>"
