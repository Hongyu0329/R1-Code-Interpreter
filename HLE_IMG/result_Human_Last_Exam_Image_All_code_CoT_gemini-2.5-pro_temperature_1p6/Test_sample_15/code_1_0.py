# The pattern identified is that the number of dots in the third column of a row
# is the number of dots in the second column multiplied by a factor.
# This factor is 0.5 times the row number.

# Data for Row 3:
# The shape is a Triangle.
# Number of dots in the second column.
dots_in_col2 = 3
# The row number.
row_number = 3

# Calculate the multiplier for Row 3.
multiplier = 0.5 * row_number

# Calculate the number of dots for the missing box in Row 3.
dots_in_col3 = dots_in_col2 * multiplier

# Print the final equation, showing each number used in the calculation.
