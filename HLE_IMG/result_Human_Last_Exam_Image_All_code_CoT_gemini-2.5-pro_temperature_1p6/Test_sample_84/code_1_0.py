    This function identifies the city with a coat of arms very similar
    to the one provided in the image.

    The analysis of the image reveals a shield divided horizontally, blue over yellow,
    with a gold crescent moon on the blue field and a black crab on the yellow field.

    This design is almost identical to the coat of arms of the Polish town of Międzyrzecz.
    The official coat of arms of Międzyrzecz features a red crab, but all other
    elements (the shield's division and colors, the crescent moon) are a perfect match.
    Given the extreme similarity, this is the correct answer.
