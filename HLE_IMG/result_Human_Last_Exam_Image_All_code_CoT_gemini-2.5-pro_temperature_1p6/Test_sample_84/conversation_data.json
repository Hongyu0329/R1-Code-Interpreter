    "The task is to identify a city whose coat of arms is very similar to the one shown in the image.\n\n**My Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the heraldic elements** in the image's coat of arms. The key features are:\n    *   A shield divided horizontally (a \"per fess\" division).\n    *   The top field is blue (\"azure\") and contains a yellow/gold crescent moon (\"or\").\n    *   The bottom field is yellow/gold (\"or\") and contains a black crab (\"sable\").\n    *   The shield is topped with a crown and flanked by an olive branch and an oak branch. These are often decorative and less unique than the shield itself.\n2.  **Search for a real-world coat of arms** matching this description. The combination of a crab, a moon, and a blue-and-yellow divided shield is quite distinctive.\n3.  **Compare the search results** to the provided image. A search for these elements points strongly to the coat of arms of the town of **Międzyrzecz** in Poland.\n4.  **Verify the match.** The coat of arms of Międzyrzecz is described as \"Per fess azure and or, in chief a crescent of the second, in base a crayfish gules.\" This means a shield divided horizontally, blue over gold, with a gold crescent in the top and a *red* crayfish/crab in the bottom.\n5.  **Conclude.** The provided image is an almost perfect match for the coat of arms of Międzyrzecz. The only discrepancy is the color of the crab (black in the image, red in the official version). This minor difference is likely an artistic or AI-generated variation. No other city's coat of arms is nearly as close.\n\nTherefore, the code will print the name of this city.\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the city with a coat of arms very similar\n    to the one provided in the image.\n\n    The analysis of the image reveals a shield divided horizontally, blue over yellow,\n    with a gold crescent moon on the blue field and a black crab on the yellow field.\n\n    This design is almost identical to the coat of arms of the Polish town of Międzyrzecz.\n    The official coat of arms of Międzyrzecz features a red crab, but all other\n    elements (the shield's division and colors, the crescent moon) are a perfect match.\n    Given the extreme similarity, this is the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    city_name = \"Międzyrzecz\"\n    print(city_name)\n\nsolve_task()\n```\n<<<Międzyrzecz>>>"
