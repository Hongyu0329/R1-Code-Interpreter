# Step 1: Define the path and the known probabilities from the diagram.
# The conversation path is START -> Appreciation -> Solution -> END.
p_start_to_appreciation = 0.32  # 32%

# Step 2: Calculate the missing probability for the transition from Appreciation.
# The sum of outgoing probabilities from any state must be 1.
# From Appreciation, we only see a transition to END with 83% probability.
p_appreciation_to_end = 0.83
# The missing probability must be the transition to the new 'Solution' state.
p_appreciation_to_solution = 1 - p_appreciation_to_end # 1 - 0.83 = 0.17

# Step 3: Define the probability for the transition from Solution.
# The problem states the 'Solution' state has only one outgoing transition to END.
# Therefore, the probability is 100%.
p_solution_to_end = 1.0

# Step 4: Calculate the total probability of the conversation path.
# The total probability is the product of the probabilities of each transition in the path.
total_probability = p_start_to_appreciation * p_appreciation_to_solution * p_solution_to_end

# Step 5: Print the results.
# The problem asks to show the final equation with each number.
