    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Decomposition:** The total shaded area is the sum of the blue shaded area and the red shaded area. Due to symmetry, these two areas are equal. We can calculate the area of one region (e.g., the blue one) and multiply it by 2.\n\n2.  **Area of a Single Shaded Region (Blue):** The blue shaded area can be calculated by finding the area of a large right-angled triangle and subtracting the area of a circular sector from it.\n    *   **Right-Angled Triangle:** The diagram shows that the blue shaded area is part of a right-angled triangle. One vertex of this triangle is the center of the circle (O). The two legs are a radius of the circle and a line segment tangent to the circle at the end of that radius.\n        *   The leg along the radius has a length equal to the radius, `R = 34`.\n        *   The other leg, the tangent segment, has a given length of `L = 17`.\n        *   The area of this triangle is `Area_triangle = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * R * L`.\n    *   **Circular Sector:** The area to be subtracted is a sector of the same circle.\n        *   The radius of the sector is `R = 34`.\n        *   The angle of the sector, let's call it `α`, is the angle at the center of the circle within the right-angled triangle. We can find it using trigonometry: `tan(α) = opposite / adjacent = L / R = 17 / 34 = 0.5`.\n        *   The angle in radians is `α = arctan(0.5)`.\n        *   The area of the sector is `Area_sector = (1/2) * R^2 * α`, where `α` is in radians.\n\n3.  **Total Area:**\n    *   The area of one shaded region is `Area_one_region = Area_triangle - Area_sector`.\n    *   The total shaded area is `Total_Area = 2 * Area_one_region`.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the given values\nR = 34  # Radius of the circle\nL = 17  # Length of the tangent segment\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the area of one of the large right-angled triangles\narea_triangle = 0.5 * R * L\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the area of the circular sector to be subtracted\n# The angle alpha (in radians) is arctan(L/R)\nangle_rad = math.atan(L / R)\n# The area of the sector is (1/2) * R^2 * angle\narea_sector = 0.5 * R**2 * angle_rad\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the area of one shaded region\narea_one_region = area_triangle - area_sector\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total shaded area (sum of the two regions)\ntotal_area = 2 * area_one_region\n\n# Print the formula and the final result\n# The overall formula is 2 * (Area_triangle - Area_sector)\n# This expands to 2 * ( (1/2)*R*L - (1/2)*R^2*arctan(L/R) ) which simplifies to R*L - R^2*arctan(L/R)\n# Or 2 * Area_one_region\nprint(\"Step-by-step calculation:\")\nprint(f\"The radius (R) is {R}.\")\nprint(f\"The tangent length (L) is {L}.\")\nprint(f\"First, calculate the area of the large right-angled triangle: (1/2) * R * L = (1/2) * {R} * {L} = {area_triangle}\")\nprint(f\"Next, calculate the area of the circular sector to subtract.
