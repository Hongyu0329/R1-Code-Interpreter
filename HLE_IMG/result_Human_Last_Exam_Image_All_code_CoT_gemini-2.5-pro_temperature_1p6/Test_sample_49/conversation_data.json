    "To determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$, we first need to find the Thevenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, seen by the capacitor $C$. The cutoff frequency, $\\omega_c$, is then given by the formula $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$.\n\n### Step 1: Finding the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)\n\n1.  **Deactivate Sources**: To find the Thevenin resistance, we deactivate the independent source \"IN\". Assuming it's a voltage source, we replace it with a short circuit, which means node $c_0$ is connected to ground.\n2.  **Remove the Load**: We remove the capacitor $C$ from the circuit.\n3.  **Calculate Equivalent Resistance**: We calculate the resistance seen from node $a_0$ looking into the circuit, with respect to ground. Let's call this $R_{th}$.\n\nThe circuit for calculating $R_{th}$ is as follows:\n- Node $c_0$ is grounded.\n- We need to find the resistance from node $a_0$ to ground.\n- From the diagram, node $a_0$ is connected to node $d_1$ through a resistor `r`. The rest of the circuit is an infinite ladder network starting from the node pair $(c_1, d_1)$.\n- Therefore, $R_{th} = r + R_{d1, gnd}$, where $R_{d1, gnd}$ is the resistance from node $d_1$ to ground (node $c_0$).\n\nTo find $R_{d1, gnd}$, we analyze the infinite ladder. Let $u_n$ be the voltage at node $d_n$ and $v_n$ be the voltage at node $c_n$. For our calculation, we can apply a test voltage $u_0$ at node $a_0$ and calculate the current $I_{in}$ that flows into $a_0$. Then $R_{th} = u_0 / I_{in}$. The node $c_0$ is grounded, so $v_0 = 0$.\n\nBy setting up and solving the recurrence relations (Kirchhoff's Current Law) for the voltages along the ladder, we get the following general solutions for $n \\ge 1$, assuming voltages are finite at infinity:\n$v_n = \\frac{1}{2}(B' - C'\\lambda^{n-1})$\n$u_n = \\frac{1}{2}(B' + C'\\lambda^{n-1})$\nwhere $\\lambda = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThese solutions must satisfy the boundary conditions imposed by the start of the ladder at $n=1$ (nodes $c_1, d_1$) and the connections to $v_0$ and $u_0$:\n- KCL at $c_1$: $3v_1 - v_0 - u_1 - v_2 = 0$. With $v_0=0$, this is $3v_1 - u_1 - v_2 = 0$.\n- KCL at $d_1$: $3u_1 - u_0 - v_1 - u_2 = 0$.\n\nSolving this system of equations for the constants $B'$ and $C'$ in terms of the applied voltage $u_0$ yields expressions for all voltages. The current $I_{in}$ flowing into node $a_0$ is given by $I_{in} = (u_0 - u_1) / r$.\n\nAfter carrying out the algebraic manipulations, we find the Thevenin resistance to be:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{u_0}{I_{in}} = (1 + \\sqrt{3})r$\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Cutoff Frequency\n\nThe angular cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$ is found where the magnitude of the capacitive reactance equals the Thevenin resistance:\n$|\\frac{1}{j\\omega_c C}| = \\frac{1}{\\omega_c C} = R_{th}$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $R_{th}$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{(1 + \\sqrt{3})rC}$\n\nThe following Python code prints this final expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script prints the formula for the angular cutoff frequency at node a0\n# in the given ladder network.\n\n# The derivation involves finding the Thevenin equivalent resistance (R_th)\n# seen by the capacitor C. The analysis of the infinite ladder leads to:\n# R_th = (1 + sqrt(3)) * r\n\n# The angular cutoff frequency is then given by omega_c = 1 / (R_th * C).\n\n# The final formula expresses the frequency in terms of the circuit's\n# resistance 'r' and capacitance 'C'. The numbers in the equation are 1 and 3.\nnum_one = 1\nnum_three = 3\n\nprint(\"The angular cutoff frequency omega_c at node a0 is given by the equation:\")\nprint(f\"omega_c = {num_one} / (({num_one} + sqrt({num_three})) * r * C)\")\n```\n<<<omega_c = 1 / ((1 + sqrt(3)) * r * C)>>>"
