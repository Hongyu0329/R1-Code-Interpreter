    "Here is my plan to determine the molecular formula of the product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material**: I will first determine the molecular formula of the initial reactant by counting the atoms of each element (Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Fluorine) based on its chemical structure. The structure is a bicyclic lactam with a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group, a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group, and a carbonyl group.\n2.  **Analyze the First Reaction**: The first step involves reacting the starting material with Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN). This reagent is known for removing the PMB protecting group from a nitrogen atom and replacing it with a hydrogen atom. I will calculate the change in the number of atoms to find the formula of Intermediate 1.\n3.  **Analyze the Second Reaction**: The second step is a catalytic hydrogenation with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2). This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) to a single bond (C-C), which involves adding two hydrogen atoms to the molecule. I will update the atom counts to find the formula of Intermediate 2.\n4.  **Analyze the Third Reaction**: The final step is the hydrolysis of Intermediate 2 with strong acid (HCl) and heat. This reaction cleaves the lactam (a cyclic amide) ring by adding a molecule of water (H2O), forming an amino acid. I will adjust the atom counts accordingly to find the molecular formula of the final product.\n5.  **Construct the Python Code**: I will write a Python script that implements these calculations. The script will start with the atom counts of the initial reactant and sequentially apply the changes from each reaction. Finally, it will print the count of each atom in the final product and the resulting molecular formula.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the final product by tracking the atomic changes\n    throughout the provided three-step chemical reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the molecular formula of the starting material.\n    # The structure is a complex bicyclic lactam.
