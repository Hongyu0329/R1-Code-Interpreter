    "This is a Chinese seal, which is read from top to bottom, right to left.\n\n1.  **Top Right Character**: The character is `寧` (níng), which simplifies to `宁`.\n2.  **Bottom Right Character**: The character is `靜` (jìng), which simplifies to `静`.\n3.  **Top Left Character**: The character is `致` (zhì), which is the same in simplified Chinese.\n4.  **Bottom Left Character**: The character is `遠` (yuǎn), which simplifies to `远`.\n\nTogether, they form the idiom `寧靜致遠` (níng jìng zhì yuǎn), which translates to \"tranquility yields transcendence\" or \"serenity leads to far-reaching insight\". In simplified Chinese, this is `宁静致远`.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print the characters.\n\n```python\n# The characters on the seal are read from top to bottom, right to left.\n# The phrase is a famous Chinese idiom \"宁静致远\" (níng jìng zhì yuǎn).\n# Here are the simplified Chinese characters:\nchar1 = \"宁\"\nchar2 = \"静\"\nchar3 = \"致\"\nchar4 = \"远\"\n\nprint(f\"The characters on the seal, in simplified Chinese, are: {char1}{char2}{char3}{char4}\")\n```\n<<<宁静致远>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What's the character content on the seal in simplified Chinese?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
