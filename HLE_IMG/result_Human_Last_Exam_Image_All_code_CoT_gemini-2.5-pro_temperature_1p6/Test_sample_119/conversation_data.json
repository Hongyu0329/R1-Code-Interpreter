    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure and IUPAC name of the compound from the provided spectroscopic data.\n\n### **1. Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+):** The peak at m/z 135 indicates the molecular weight is 135.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight strongly suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Assuming one nitrogen atom, a possible molecular formula is C₉H₁₃N. (Mass = 9*12 + 13*1 + 1*14 = 135).\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C₉H₁₃N, the DBE is (2*9 + 2 + 1 - 13) / 2 = 4. This value is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n*   **Fragmentation:** A significant peak at m/z 91 suggests the presence of a benzyl cation ([C₇H₇]⁺), indicating a C₆H₅-CH₂- moiety.\n\n### **2. Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n*   **~3400-3300 cm⁻¹:** Two sharp peaks in this region are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **~3050-3000 cm⁻¹:** Aromatic sp² C-H stretching.\n*   **~2950-2850 cm⁻¹:** Aliphatic sp³ C-H stretching.\n*   **~1600 & ~1450 cm⁻¹:** C=C stretching vibrations of an aromatic ring.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum confirms the presence of a primary amine and an aromatic ring.\n\n### **3. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135**\n*   **¹³C Signals:** There are 7 distinct carbon signals:\n    *   **Aromatic (4 signals):** 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm. This pattern is consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring (1 ipso-C, ortho, meta, and para carbons).\n    *   **Aliphatic (3 signals):** 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm.\n*   **DEPT-135:** Shows one negative signal and five positive signals.\n    *   **Negative Signal:** Indicates one CH₂ (methylene) group. This corresponds to the signal at 43.5 ppm.\n    *   **Positive Signals:** Indicates five CH (methine) and/or CH₃ (methyl) groups. These are the three aromatic CH carbons (128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm), one aliphatic CH carbon (49.6 ppm), and one CH₃ carbon (19.2 ppm).\n\n### **4. ¹H NMR**\n*   **~7.2 ppm (5H, multiplet):** Protons of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   **~2.85 ppm (2H, multiplet):** Protons of the CH₂ group. Its benzylic position explains the chemical shift. The complexity arises because they are diastereotopic, being adjacent to a chiral center.\n*   **~2.75 ppm (1H, multiplet):** The single proton of the CH group.\n*   **~1.2 ppm (3H, doublet):** Protons of a CH₃ group that is coupled to one adjacent proton (the CH group). This confirms a -CH-CH₃ fragment.\n*   **Broad signal (not shown in detail, but expected):** A broad, exchangeable signal for the two -NH₂ protons.\n\n### **5. HSQC**\nThis 2D spectrum correlates the proton and carbon signals:\n*   ¹H at 1.2 ppm (CH₃) is connected to ¹³C at 19.2 ppm.\n*   ¹H at 2.75 ppm (CH) is connected to ¹³C at 49.6 ppm.\n*   ¹H at 2.85 ppm (CH₂) is connected to ¹³C at 43.5 ppm.\n*   The ¹H aromatic protons (~7.2 ppm) are connected to the ¹³C signals at 126.3, 127.3, and 128.5 ppm.\n*   The ¹³C signal at 145.1 ppm shows no correlation, confirming it is a quaternary ipso-carbon.\n\n### **6. Conclusion and IUPAC Name**\nAll data consistently point to a structure with a C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃ arrangement.\nTo name this compound according to IUPAC rules:\n1.  Identify the principal functional group: Amine.\n2.  Identify the longest carbon chain containing the amine: A 3-carbon chain (propane).\n3.  Number the chain to give the amine group the lowest possible number: This places the amine on carbon 2 (propan-2-amine).\n4.  Name and number the remaining substituent: A phenyl group on carbon 1.\n5.  Combine the parts to get the full IUPAC name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_iupac_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the determined IUPAC name of the compound.\n    The structure was determined to be 1-phenylpropan-2-amine based on the analysis of\n    MS, IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT, and HSQC data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The parent chain is propane.\n    # The principal functional group is an amine at position 2.\n    amine_position = 2\n    parent_chain = \"propan\"\n    amine_suffix = \"amine\"\n\n    # There is a phenyl substituent at position 1.\n    substituent_position = 1\n    substituent_name = \"phenyl\"\n\n    # Assemble the IUPAC name\n    # The numbers specifying the locants are explicitly included.\n    iupac_name = f\"{substituent_position}-{substituent_name}{parent_chain}-{amine_position}-{amine_suffix}\"\n    \n    print(\"The IUPAC name of the compound is:\")\n    print(iupac_name)\n    # The final equation is the name itself, which includes the numbers (locants).\n    print(\"\\nThe final name shows the locants:\")\n    print(f\"Phenyl group at position: {substituent_position}\")\n    print(f\"Amine group at position: {amine_position}\")\n\n\nsolve_iupac_name()\n```\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
