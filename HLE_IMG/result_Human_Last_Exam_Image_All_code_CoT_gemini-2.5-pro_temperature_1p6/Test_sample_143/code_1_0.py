# The plan is to output the indices corresponding to the analysis of each image pair (A, B, C).
# Analysis of A: The right image shows a clear invasion, while the left shows a more diverse habitat. This is 'right invaded' (3).
# Analysis of B: Both images show dense, monoculture-like stands characteristic of an invasive species. This is 'both invasive' (2).
# Analysis of C: Neither image shows signs of an aggressive invasion; they show a plant in a suitable habitat. This is 'both native' (1).
# The final sequence of indices for A, B, and C is 3, 2, 1.
