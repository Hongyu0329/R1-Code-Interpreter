    This function solves the giraffe identification puzzle.

    The method involves a visual comparison of the unique coat patterns of the giraffes.
    1.  The pattern of the 'Target' giraffe is carefully studied, focusing on the distinctive arrangement of spots on its shoulder and torso.
    2.  This pattern is then compared against the patterns of the giraffes in images A through F.
    3.  Images A, C, D, E, and F are ruled out due to clear differences in spot color, shape, or arrangement.
    4.  Image B shows a spot pattern that is an identical match to the 'Target' giraffe, particularly in the unique cluster of spots on the shoulder.

    Therefore, B is the correct answer.
