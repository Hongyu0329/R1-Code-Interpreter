    "Based on my analysis of the image, the lesion is a form of secondary or recurrent caries, which is decay occurring adjacent to an existing dental restoration. To determine its classification, we use the G.V. Black classification system, which categorizes caries based on their location on the tooth.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the key features of the lesion visible in the image.\n2.  Represent the G.V. Black classification system in a data structure.\n3.  Write a Python script to match the lesion's features to the correct classification.\n4.  Print the reasoning and the final classification code.\n\nThe lesion is located in the pits and fissures on the occlusal (chewing) surface of a posterior tooth. According to G.V. Black's system, caries in this specific location is classified as Class I.\n\n```python\ndef classify_caries_from_image_features():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script classifies a dental lesion based on pre-identified features\n    from an image, using the G.V.
