    "My thinking process to solve this mate-in-2 chess puzzle is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial position:** It's Black's turn to move. The White king is on h1. The key constraint is that Black's Queens cannot move.\n2.  **Evaluate the White King's position:** The King's potential escape squares, g1 and g2, are already under attack.\n    *   g1 is controlled by the Black Queen on b1.\n    *   g2 is controlled by the Black Queen on a2 and the Black Bishop on h3.\n    *   This means the White King is currently trapped and has no legal moves. Black only needs to deliver a check that cannot be legally stopped by White.\n3.  **Search for forcing moves:** A mate-in-2 puzzle often involves a forcing first move, such as a check or a sacrifice, that severely limits the opponent's responses.\n4.  **Candidate Move 1: 1... Rf2+**\n    *   This move checks the White King with the Black Rook.\n    *   Since the King has no escape squares, White must either block the check or capture the checking piece. Blocking is not possible.\n    *   White's only legal response is to capture the Rook: **2. Bxf2**. This move is forced.\n5.  **Analyze the position after White's forced move:** After 2. Bxf2, the White Bishop has moved from f1 to f2. This leaves the f1 square undefended.\n6.  **Find the Mating Move:** Black can now play the second move, **2... Bf1#**.\n    *   The Black Bishop moves from h3 to f1, delivering checkmate.\n7.  **Verify the checkmate:**\n    *   The King on h1 is in check from the Bishop on f1.\n    *   The King cannot move (g1 and g2 remain covered).\n    *   The check cannot be blocked.\n    *   The checking Bishop on f1 cannot be captured (the White Bishop that was on f1 is now on f2).\n    *   Therefore, this is a valid checkmate.\n8.  **Conclusion:** The sequence for black is **Rf2+** followed by **Bf1#**. The Python code below will construct and print this solution. To satisfy the instruction \"output each number\", the numbers from the coordinates will be stored in variables and used in the printout.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_mate_in_2():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the solution to the given chess puzzle.\n    The solution is a mate in 2 for Black, without moving the queens.\n    The code explicitly uses the numbers from the chess notation to form the output string.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The first move is Rook to f2, delivering a check.\n    # The number in this move's coordinate is 2.\n    move1_rank = 2\n    \n    # The second move is Bishop to f1, delivering checkmate.\n    # The number in this move's coordinate is 1.\n    move2_rank = 1\n\n    # Construct the standard algebraic notation for the moves.\n    first_move = f\"Rf{move1_rank}+\"\n    second_move = f\"Bf{move2_rank}#\"\n    \n    # Print the final sequence of moves for Black.\n    print(f\"The mate-in-2 sequence for Black is: {first_move}, {second_move}\")\n\nsolve_chess_mate_in_2()\n```\n<<<Rf2+, Bf1#>>>"
