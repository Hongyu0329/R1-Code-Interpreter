# Let the two numbers in the top squares be 'a' and 'b'.
# Through logical deduction based on the puzzle's consistent clues, we arrived at a system of equations:
# 1. The sum of the column containing 'a' is 22.
# 2. A partial sum of that same column is 15.
# 3. This implies that the sum of the remaining cells in that column ('a' and 'd') is 7 (a + d = 7).
# 4. We deduced that the sum of the top row is 15 (a + b = 15).
# Solving this system under Kakuro rules (digits 1-9) gives a unique solution.

a = 6
b = 9

# Print the solution for the top two squares.
print(f"The two numbers in the top white squares are {a} and {b}.")

# Verify the result by showing the equation for the top row.
print(f"This is based on the deduced equation for the top row: {a} + {b} = {a+b}")
