    This function identifies and returns the name of the missing reactant.
    The reaction is a cyclocondensation to form a substituted 2-aminoimidazole.
    The Î±-bromoketone provides the C4 and C5 atoms of the imidazole ring.
    The unknown reactant must provide the N1, C2, and N3 atoms, along with the substituents.
    
    Analysis:
    - The product has a 2-amino group, so the C2 atom of the reactant must be part of a guanidine-like structure.
    - The product has an N-Boc-amino group (-NH-Boc) at the N1 position.
    - This points to the reactant being N-Boc-aminoguanidine.
