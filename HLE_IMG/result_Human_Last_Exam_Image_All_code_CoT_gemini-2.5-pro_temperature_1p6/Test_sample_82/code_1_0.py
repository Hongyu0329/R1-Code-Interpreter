# The intramolecular Heck reaction involves a sequence of steps.
# 1. Oxidative addition of Pd(0) into the C-Br bond at C9.
# 2. Carbopalladation: The C9-Pd group adds across the C4=C5 double bond.
#    The product shows a new bond between C9 and C5.
#    This means the Palladium atom gets attached to C4.
# 3. Beta-hydride elimination: A hydrogen from a carbon beta to the Pd-bearing carbon (C4) is removed.
#    The beta carbons are C3 and C5.
#    Elimination from C5 is reversible and unproductive.
#    Elimination of a hydrogen from C3 is the productive pathway.
# 4. Result: A new double bond is formed between the carbon that lost the hydrogen (C3) and the carbon that lost the palladium (C4).

carbon_x = 3
carbon_y = 4

# The new alkene is formed between carbon atoms CX and CY.
# The code below will print the final answer in the requested format.
