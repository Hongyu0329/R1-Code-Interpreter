Yes, there is clear evidence of insect activity. The primary evidence is the large, white, fuzzy gall on the twig, known as a Wool Sower Gall. This was created by a gall wasp. The wasp that made this structure has already laid its eggs on the twig; the gall grew around the developing larvae. The next generation of this insect will lay its eggs on the twigs of other oak trees.
