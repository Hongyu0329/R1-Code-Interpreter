    "Based on the visual evidence provided in the images, here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the biological process:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image Sequence:** The image consists of three panels labeled L, M, and N, which show a time-lapse sequence of a filamentous structure, characteristic of a fungal hypha. The structure is composed of multiple cells separated by cross-walls called septa.\n2.  **Observe the Key Event:** An arrowhead in each panel points to the same specific septum.\n    *   In panel **L**, the hypha is mostly straight.\n    *   In panel **M**, a small bulge appears on the side of the hypha at the location of the marked septum.\n    *   In panel **N**, this bulge has grown significantly larger, causing the entire hypha to bend sharply at that point.\n3.  **Identify the Process:** This localized swelling at a septum, driven by internal turgor pressure, leads to a change in the shape and direction of the filament. This specific mechanism of bending in fungal hyphae is known as **hyphal buckling**. It is a process where the cell wall yields at a specific point, often the youngest and most flexible septum, causing the structure to buckle.\n\nTo provide the answer as requested, here is a Python script that prints the name of the process.\n\n```python\ndef identify_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the biological process shown in the image series.\n  The image shows a fungal hypha undergoing a specific morphological change.\n  L: A straight hypha.\n  M: A bulge starts to form at a septum.\n  N: The bulge enlarges, causing the hypha to bend.\n  This process is known as hyphal buckling.\n  \"\"\"\n  process_name = \"Hyphal buckling\"\n  print(f\"The process depicted in the image is: {process_name}\")\n\nidentify_process()\n```\n<<<Hyphal buckling>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
