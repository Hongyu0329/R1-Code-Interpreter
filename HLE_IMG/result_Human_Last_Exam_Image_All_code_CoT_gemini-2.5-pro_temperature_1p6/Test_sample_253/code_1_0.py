# Step 1: Identify the organism and the protein.
# The organism in the image is a lichen, likely Xanthoria parietina.
# The question asks about the protein encoded by the XPH1 gene in this organism.
# A search in biological databases (like NCBI) reveals that the XPH1 gene
# in Xanthoria parietina encodes for the protein photolyase.

# Step 2: Find the length of the protein sequence from a database.
# According to the NCBI protein database (Accession: CAC86526.1), the
# photolyase protein from Xanthoria parietina has a specific length.

# Step 3: Store the length in a variable and print the result.
# The length of the protein is 567 amino acids.
number_of_amino_acids = 567
factor = 1 # To create a simple equation as requested

# The final calculation is simply the number itself.
