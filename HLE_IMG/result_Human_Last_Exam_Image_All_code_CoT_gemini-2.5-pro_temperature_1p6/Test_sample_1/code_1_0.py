# Physical constants
k_B = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann constant in J/K
h = 6.62607015e-34   # Planck constant in J*s
R = 8.31446          # Ideal gas constant in J/(mol*K)

# Parameters from the reaction energy profile
T = 298.0  # Temperature in Kelvin, from the graph's y-axis label
# Gibbs free energies in kJ/mol
G_TDTS = 18.0   # Energy of the highest transition state, TS-eli
G_TDI = -61.0   # Energy of the most stable intermediate (resting state), Cat-GB
