    "Based on my analysis of the Google Trends data, the cyclical peaks correspond to specific annual events in one country.\n\n*   **Red Line:** Shows a peak every year in late January. This timing is consistent with **Australia Day** on January 26th.\n*   **Yellow Line:** Shows a peak every year in late April. This corresponds to **Anzac Day**, a major national day of remembrance in Australia on April 25th.\n*   **Blue Line:** Shows a smaller peak every year in late May or early June. This aligns with **National Reconciliation Week** (May 27 - June 3) or related events like Mabo Day.\n\nAll three of these significant historical commemorations are unique to Australia.\n\n```python\ndef solve_country_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the pattern of search trends to identify the country.\n    \n    The graph displays three distinct annual peaks corresponding to historical events:\n    1.
