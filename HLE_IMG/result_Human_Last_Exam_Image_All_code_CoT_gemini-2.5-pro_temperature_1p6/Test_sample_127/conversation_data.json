    "To determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely, we need to analyze the bonding of each ring within the complex. Free rotation is possible around single bonds, but it is restricted if the ring is part of a rigid system, such as a chelate ring involving the central metal atom.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the ligand types:** The complex contains three main ligand systems attached to the central Iridium (Ir) ion.\n    *   Two are phenylpyridine-type ligands (A-B and C-D).\n    *   One is a substituted bipyridine-type ligand (E-F-G).\n2.  **Evaluate rings in rigid systems:** Phenyl rings that are part of a cyclometalated chelate ring will be held rigidly and cannot rotate. In this structure, rings A and C are directly bonded to the Iridium through a carbon atom (this is called cyclometalation). This bond, along with the coordination of the attached pyridine rings (B and D), locks rings A and C into a fixed orientation. Therefore, rings A and C cannot rotate freely.\n3.  **Evaluate peripheral rings:** Phenyl rings that are attached to the main ligand framework by a single C-C bond act as peripheral substituents. Rotation around a single C-C bond is generally considered free.\n    *   Ring **G** is attached to pyridine ring F via a single bond.\n    *   Ring **H** is attached to phenyl ring A via a single bond.\n    *   Ring **J** is attached to phenyl ring C via a single bond.\n    *   Ring **K** is attached to phenyl ring A via a single bond.\n    *   Ring **L** is attached to phenyl ring C via a single bond.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since rings G, H, J, K, and L are all connected by single bonds and are not part of a rigid chelate structure themselves, they are all free to rotate.\n\nThe following Python code systematically applies this logic to identify the freely rotating rings.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_molecule_rotation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the molecular structure to determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Represent the phenyl rings and their structural role.\n    # 'fixed' means it is part of a rigid cyclometalated chelate ring.\n    # 'peripheral' means it is a substituent attached by a single bond.\n    phenyl_rings = {\n        'A': 'fixed',\n        'C': 'fixed',\n        'G': 'peripheral',\n        'H': 'peripheral',\n        'J': 'peripheral',\n        'K': 'peripheral',\n        'L': 'peripheral'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing which phenyl rings can rotate freely in solution.\")\n    print(\"Principle: Rotation is free around single C-C bonds unless the ring is part of a rigid structure (e.g., a chelate ring).\\n\")\n\n    freely_rotating_rings = []\n    \n    # Using an ordered dictionary to process in a defined order for clear output.\n    # This is not strictly necessary for the logic but makes the printout cleaner.\n    ordered_rings = collections.OrderedDict(sorted(phenyl_rings.items()))\n\n    # Step 2: Iterate through each phenyl ring and apply the principle.\n    for ring, role in ordered_rings.items():\n        if role == 'fixed':\n            print(f\"Ring {ring}: This ring is cyclometalated and part of a rigid chelate system. It CANNOT rotate freely.\")\n        elif role == 'peripheral':\n            print(f\"Ring {ring}: This ring is a peripheral substituent attached by a single C-C bond. It CAN rotate freely.\")\n            freely_rotating_rings.append(ring)\n\n    # Step 3: Output the final list of rings.\n    print(\"\\n-----------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Final Result:\")\n    print(\"The set of phenyl rings that can rotate freely is composed of the following individual rings:\")\n    # \"output each number in the final equation!\" is interpreted as outputting each label.\n    for ring in freely_rotating_rings:\n        print(f\"- Ring {ring}\")\n    \n    # Matching the result to the provided options\n    # The identified rings are G, H, J, K, L.\n    # This corresponds to option A: G, J, L, K, H (same set of rings).\n\nsolve_molecule_rotation()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
