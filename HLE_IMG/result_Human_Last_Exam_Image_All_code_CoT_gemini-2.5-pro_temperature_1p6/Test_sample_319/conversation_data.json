    "This image illustrates the **Auditory Continuity Illusion** (also known as temporal induction).\n\nThe top panel is a spectrogram, showing the frequency content of a sound over time. A pure tone (the horizontal line) is physically interrupted and replaced by a short burst of broadband noise (the vertical bar). The bottom panel shows the corresponding waveform.\n\nDespite the tone being physically absent during the noise burst, a listener typically perceives the tone as continuing uninterrupted *behind* the noise. The brain \"fills in\" the missing auditory information, demonstrating a powerful perceptual restoration effect, similar to how the visual system completes objects that are partially occluded.\n\nSince no calculation or code is required to answer this question about a perceptual phenomenon, I will directly provide the answer.\n\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
