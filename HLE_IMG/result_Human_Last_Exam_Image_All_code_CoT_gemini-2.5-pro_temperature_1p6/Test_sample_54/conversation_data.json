    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify reagents A and B:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Reagent A\n\n1.  **Analyze the transformation from 1 to 2:** We start with compound **1**, which is a complex polycyclic ether with a cationic charge (a pyrylium salt derivative). It reacts to form compound **2**.\n2.  **Compare structures 1 and 2:** In compound **2**, one of the oxygen atoms in a heterocyclic ring has been replaced by a nitrogen atom bearing an amino group (`-NH2`). The new functional group is `>N⁺-NH2`.\n3.  **Identify the nucleophile:** This type of reaction, where an oxygen in a pyrylium salt is replaced by a nitrogen group to form a pyridinium salt, is a classic reaction in heterocyclic chemistry. The incoming group is `-NH-NH2`. The reagent that provides this group is **hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂)**. Hydrazine acts as a nitrogen nucleophile, attacking the ring and leading to a ring-opening and ring-closing sequence that substitutes the oxygen atom.\n\nTherefore, **Reagent A is hydrazine**.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Reagent B\n\n1.  **Analyze the transformation from 2 to 3:** Compound **2**, which has an `N-amino` pyridinium part and a pyrylium part, reacts to form compound **3**, a dimethoxy quinacridinium salt.\n2.  **Compare structures 2 and 3:** Two significant changes occur:\n    *   The oxygen atom in the remaining pyrylium ring of **2** is replaced by an `N-H` group.\n    *   The `>N⁺-NH₂` group in **2** is replaced by an `>N⁺-CH₂CH₂CH₃` (N-propyl) group.\n3.  **Identify the source of new atoms:** The overall reaction introduces a propyl group (`-C₃H₇`) and an `NH` group. Reagent B must be the source of these atoms.\n4.  **Deduce the reagent:** The simplest common chemical reagent that contains both a propyl group and an amino group (`-NH₂`, which can become `-NH-` in the final structure) is **propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)**.\n5.  **Reaction mechanism:** Although the mechanism is complex, it likely involves propylamine acting as a nucleophile, initiating a cascade of ring-opening and recyclization reactions. The high stability of the planar, extensively conjugated quinacridinium system in product **3** provides a strong thermodynamic driving force for this rearrangement. During this process, the propylamine molecule is incorporated to form the `N-H` and `N-propyl` moieties seen in the final product.\n\nTherefore, **Reagent B is propylamine**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the reagents A and B in the given chemical reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    reagent_A = \"Hydrazine (N2H4)\"\n    reagent_B = \"Propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The reaction from compound 1 to 2 involves the substitution of a ring oxygen atom with a >N-NH2 group.\")\n    print(f\"This is a characteristic reaction of pyrylium salts with hydrazine.
