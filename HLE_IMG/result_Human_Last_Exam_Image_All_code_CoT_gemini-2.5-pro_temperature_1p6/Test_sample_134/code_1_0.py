# The molecule is a kinked carbon nanoring, a type of cycloparaphenyleneacetylene.
# Let's determine its molecular formula by identifying and counting its constituent units.

# 1. Identify and count the units from the image.
# There are 8 phenylene (C6H4) units in total.
# - 6 are connected at the para-positions (1,4), creating straight sections.
# - 2 are connected at the meta-positions (1,3), creating "kinks".
total_phenylene_units = 8

# There are 8 ethynylene (-Câ‰¡C-) linker units.
num_ethynylene_units = 8

# 2. Calculate the number of Carbon and Hydrogen atoms.
# Each phenylene unit (C6H4) has 6 carbons and 4 hydrogens.
# Each ethynylene unit (C2) has 2 carbons and 0 hydrogens.

c_from_phenylene = total_phenylene_units * 6
h_from_phenylene = total_phenylene_units * 4

c_from_ethynylene = num_ethynylene_units * 2
h_from_ethynylene = 0

total_carbons = c_from_phenylene + c_from_ethynylene
total_hydrogens = h_from_phenylene + h_from_ethynylene

# 3. Print the calculation steps (the "equation").
print("Calculation of the molecular formula:")

print("\nEquation for Carbon atoms:")
print(f"{total_phenylene_units} (phenylene units) * 6 (C/unit) + {num_ethynylene_units} (ethynylene units) * 2 (C/unit) = Total Carbons")
print(f"{c_from_phenylene} + {c_from_ethynylene} = {total_carbons}")

print("\nEquation for Hydrogen atoms:")
print(f"{total_phenylene_units} (phenylene units) * 4 (H/unit) + {num_ethynylene_units} (ethynylene units) * 0 (H/unit) = Total Hydrogens")
print(f"{h_from_phenylene} + {h_from_ethynylene} = {total_hydrogens}")

print(f"\nThe resulting molecular formula is C{total_carbons}H{total_hydrogens}.")

# 4. Print the name of the molecule.
# This specific structure with 8 phenylene and 8 ethynylene units,
# including two meta-linkages, is known by a specific name in chemistry.
molecule_name = "kinked [8]cycloparaphenyleneacetylene"
print(f"\nThe common name for this molecule is: {molecule_name}")
