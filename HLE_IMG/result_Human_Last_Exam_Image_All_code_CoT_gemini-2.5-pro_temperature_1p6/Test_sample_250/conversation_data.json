    "My plan to identify this jazz standard is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Key:** The key signature has four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭), and the first chord is F minor. This strongly indicates the piece is in the key of F minor.\n2.  **Analyze the Melody:** The opening melodic phrase, starting after the pickups, is C, A♭, C, followed by G, F, E natural. This distinctive melodic contour is a key identifier.\n3.  **Analyze the Chord Progression:** The initial chords are F-, E-7♭5, E♭-6, D♭maj7, and G7. This harmonic movement is very characteristic of the bebop era.\n4.  **Synthesize and Identify:** By searching for a jazz standard in F minor that features this specific melody and chord progression, I can confidently identify the piece. These musical elements are the defining features of the jazz standard \"Hot House\".\n5.  **Identify the Composer:** Musicological sources and jazz discographies credit \"Hot House\" to the composer and arranger Tadd Dameron.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will provide a Python script to state the identified title and composer.\n\n```python\n# This script presents the identification of the provided jazz standard\n# based on musical analysis of its melody and harmony.\n\n# Identified Information\ntitle = \"Hot House\"\ncomposer = \"Tadd Dameron\"\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"Title: {title}\")\nprint(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n```\n<<<Title: Hot House, Composer: Tadd Dameron>>>"
