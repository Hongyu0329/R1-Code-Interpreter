    "This is a knowledge-based question that can be solved by identifying the plant and its native habitat.\n\n1.  **Plant Identification**: The plant in the image is characterized by its glossy green leaves with a striking, creamy-white reticulated (net-like) vein pattern. This distinctive foliage is a hallmark of certain species within the genus *Helwingia*.\n\n2.  **Determining the Specific Species and Origin**: Several species of *Helwingia* exist, each with a specific native range.\n    *   *Helwingia omeiensis* is named after Mount Omei (Emei) in Sichuan, mainland China.\n    *   *Helwingia japonica* is found in Japan, but also on the Asian mainland.\n    *   *Helwingia formosana* is the species whose specific epithet \"formosana\" refers to Formosa, the historical name for the island of Taiwan. This species is endemic to Taiwan.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: Based on the botanical name, *Helwingia formosana* is the species endemic to the island of Taiwan. Therefore, the name of the island is Taiwan. I will write a Python script to state this finding.\n\n```python\nimport wikipediaapi\n\ndef get_endemic_island_from_plant(plant_species_epithet):\n    \"\"\"\n    Looks up the island associated with a plant's specific epithet.\n    In this case, the logic is pre-determined from visual identification.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The plant in the image is identified as a Helwingia species.\n    # The species Helwingia formosana is endemic to a specific island.\n    # The epithet 'formosana' refers to Formosa.\n    if plant_species_epithet == \"formosana\":\n        # Formosa is the historical name for Taiwan.\n        island_name = \"Taiwan\"\n        print(f\"The plant Helwingia formosana is endemic to the island of {island_name}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Could not determine the endemic island for the given plant.\")\n        island_name = None\n    \n    return island_name\n\n# The plant's specific epithet suggesting an island origin is \"formosana\".\nfinal_answer = get_endemic_island_from_plant(\"formosana\")\n\n# Although the function prints the sentence, the final requested output is just the name.\n# print(final_answer) # This would be the most direct way to output.\n# Since the prompt asks to output the final answer directly in the response,\n# and not to ask the user to copy/paste, I will format it as requested.\n\n```\n<<<Taiwan>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
