    "This is a medical diagnosis question based on a histopathology image. A coding solution is not appropriate for this task. I will provide the histopathological diagnosis based on my analysis of the image features.\n\nHere is my analysis of the image:\n\n1.  **Identify the Structure:** The image shows a renal glomerulus, which is the filtering unit of the kidney. It is surrounded by renal tubules.\n2.  **Observe Key Pathological Feature:** The most striking abnormality is the large, crescent-shaped proliferation of cells that fills Bowman's space (the area between the central glomerular tuft and the outer Bowman's capsule).\n3.  **Analyze the \"Crescent\":** This crescent is highly cellular, indicating a rapid proliferation of cells, which are primarily parietal epithelial cells along with infiltrating inflammatory cells like macrophages. This cellular crescent is compressing the glomerular capillary tuft.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The presence of a prominent cellular crescent is the hallmark feature of Crescentic Glomerulonephritis. This condition is associated with a clinical syndrome of Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN), which leads to a rapid loss of kidney function.\n\n<<<Crescentic Glomerulonephritis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the histopathological diagnosis of this image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
