    "The image shows a large bracket fungus, likely a species of *Trametes*, which is being parasitized by a smaller fungus. The tiny black organisms with stalks and heads are the sporangiophores (fruiting bodies) of a type of mold. This kind of fungus that grows on another fungus is called a mycoparasite. Based on the pin-like appearance, the common name for this black organism is a pin mold.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the name of the black organism in the image.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The black organism is a type of mycoparasitic fungus, commonly known as a pin mold,\n  # growing on the larger bracket fungus.\n  organism_name = \"Pin mold (a type of mycoparasitic fungus)\"\n  print(organism_name)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Pin mold (a type of mycoparasitic fungus)>>>"
