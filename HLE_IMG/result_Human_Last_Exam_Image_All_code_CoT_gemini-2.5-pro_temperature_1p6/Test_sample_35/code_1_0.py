    The provided diagram shows the S100B protein binding to the extracellular portion of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE). This extracellular segment is composed of three distinct domains labeled V, C1, and C2. The primary binding site on RAGE for ligands such as S100B is the V domain (Variable-type immunoglobulin domain), which is the most distal domain from the cell membrane. Therefore, S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the V domain of the RAGE receptor.

    explanation2 = """
    S100B can be used as a prognostic marker in the pathology of neurological disorders. A prognostic marker is used to forecast the likely course or outcome of a disease. The diagram clearly illustrates that the interaction between S100B and the RAGE receptor initiates intracellular signaling cascades (such as NFkB and JNK/JUN activation) that directly result in neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Because the concentration of S100B is mechanistically linked to the progression and severity of the disease pathology, its levels can be used to predict the future outcome for the patient. While it could also be used as an adjunct marker in a diagnostic panel, its key value lies in its predictive power, making 'prognostic marker' the most accurate classification.
