The S100B protein binds with strong affinity to the V domain of the RAGE receptor. It can be used as a prognostic marker because its elevated levels are directly linked to the activation of pathways that cause neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration, thus predicting the progression and severity of the disease.
