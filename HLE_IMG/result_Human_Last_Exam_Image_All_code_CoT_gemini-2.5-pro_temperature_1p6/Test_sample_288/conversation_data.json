    "My plan is to first identify the venue shown in the image by analyzing its unique architectural features. I'll look at the red brickwork, the distinctive wall decorations, and the overall structure. Once the venue is identified, I will search for its event calendar for the date of October 12, 2023, to find the name of the musical artist who performed on that day. Finally, I will present this information in a Python script.\n\nBased on a visual search, the venue in the image is the George S. and Dolores Doré Eccles Theater in Salt Lake City, Utah. A search of their events for October 12, 2023, reveals the performing artist.\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\n# The image was taken outside the George S. and Dolores Doré Eccles Theater in Salt Lake City.\nvenue_name = \"George S. and Dolores Doré Eccles Theater\"\nperformance_date = datetime.date(2023, 10, 12)\n\n# Based on the venue's schedule for that date.\nartist_name = \"Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit\"\n\nprint(f\"The artist who played at the {venue_name} on {performance_date.strftime('%B %d, %Y')} was {artist_name}.\")\n```\n<<<Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit>>>"
