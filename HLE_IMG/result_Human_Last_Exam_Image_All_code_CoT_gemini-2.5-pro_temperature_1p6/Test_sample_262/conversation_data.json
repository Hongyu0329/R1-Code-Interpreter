    "My thinking process to determine which complexes have shorter lifetimes is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Structures:** All four molecules are cationic Iridium(III) complexes. They have the general formula `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+`, where `Ir` is the central Iridium atom, `C^N` represents a cyclometalated phenylpyridine ligand, and `N^N` represents a 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine ligand. The counter-ion is hexafluorophosphate (PF6-). The key difference between the four complexes lies in the fluorination pattern of the two identical phenylpyridine (`C^N`) ligands.\n\n2.  **Identify the Variable Structural Feature:**\n    *   **Complex 1:** Fluorine atoms are at the 4' and 5' positions of the phenyl ring (meta and para to the Ir-C bond).\n    *   **Complex 2:** A single fluorine atom is at the 4' position (para to the Ir-C bond).\n    *   **Complex 3:** A single fluorine atom is at the 2' position (ortho to the Ir-C bond).\n    *   **Complex 4:** Fluorine atoms are at the 2' and 4' positions (one ortho and one para to the Ir-C bond).\n\n3.  **Relate Structure to Stability and Lifetime:** The operational lifetime of such emitter complexes in devices like LECs is closely linked to their chemical and thermal stability. A primary degradation pathway is the dissociation of ligands, particularly the strong cyclometalating Ir-C bond. The stability of this bond is influenced by two main factors:\n    *   **Electronic Effects:** Fluorine is a strongly electronegative and electron-withdrawing atom. When placed on the phenyl ring, it lowers the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which has significant metal and ligand character. This generally leads to a stronger Ir-C bond and increased complex stability.\n    *   **Steric Effects:** Substituents placed close to the metal center can cause steric hindrance (repulsion) with other ligands. This steric strain can distort the coordination geometry, weaken the metal-ligand bonds, and make the complex more susceptible to degradation.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Complex:**\n    *   **Complexes 1 and 2:** The fluorine substituents are in the meta and para positions, far from the Iridium center. They contribute favorably through their electronic-withdrawing effect, stabilizing the complex without introducing any significant steric hindrance. These complexes are therefore expected to be relatively stable and have longer lifetimes.\n    *   **Complexes 3 and 4:** Both of these complexes have a fluorine atom at the 2' (ortho) position. This ortho-fluorine is very close to the Iridium center and the other coordinated ligands. This proximity creates significant steric repulsion. This steric strain is known to weaken the Ir-C bond, making the ligand more likely to dissociate under the electrical and thermal stress of device operation. While the electronic effects of fluorine are still stabilizing, the destabilizing steric effect from the ortho position is a dominant factor that leads to reduced stability and, consequently, a shorter device lifetime.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The presence of the ortho-fluorine substituent in Complexes 3 and 4 is the critical feature that predicts lower stability and shorter operational lifetimes compared to Complexes 1 and 2, which lack this feature. Therefore, Complexes [3] and [4] are expected to show shorter lifetimes.\n\n```python\ndef find_unstable_complexes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the Iridium complexes to predict which ones have shorter lifetimes in LECs.\n\n    The stability of these Ir(III) complexes is a key factor for device lifetime.\n    A major degradation pathway is the dissociation of the cyclometalating phenylpyridine ligand.\n    The strength of the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond is crucial.\n\n    Structural Analysis:\n    - All complexes have the same ancillary bipyridine ligand.\n    - The difference lies in the fluorine substituents on the phenylpyridine ligands.\n    - Electronic Effect: Fluorine is electron-withdrawing, which generally strengthens the Ir-C bond and increases stability.\n    - Steric Effect: Substituents in the ortho position (2'-position) to the Ir-C bond cause steric hindrance. This strain weakens the Ir-C bond, leading to lower stability and faster degradation.\n\n    - Complex 1: Fluorines at 4', 5' positions. No steric hindrance. Expected to be stable.\n    - Complex 2: Fluorine at 4' position. No steric hindrance. Expected to be stable.\n    - Complex 3: Fluorine at 2' (ortho) position. Significant steric hindrance. Expected to be unstable.\n    - Complex 4: Fluorines at 2' (ortho) and 4' positions. Significant steric hindrance from the 2'-F. Expected to be unstable.\n\n    Conclusion: Complexes with ortho-fluorine substituents (Complexes 3 and 4) are expected to be less stable and have shorter lifetimes.\n    \"\"\"\n    complexes = [\n        {'id': 1, 'ortho_F': False, 'comment': 'F at 4\\', 5\\'.
