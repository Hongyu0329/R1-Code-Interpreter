    "Based on the provided information and image, here is my step-by-step thinking process to reach a diagnosis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clinical Presentation:** The patient is a 28-year-old female with a mass in the sella turcica. The sella turcica houses the pituitary gland. In a young adult female, a mass in this location is statistically most likely to be a pituitary adenoma, particularly a prolactin-secreting one.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Pathological Image (Crush Smear):**\n    *   The image displays clusters of cells in a syncytial arrangement, meaning the cell borders are ill-defined, and the cells appear to merge.\n    *   The cells are relatively uniform (monotonous) in size and shape.\n    *   The nuclei are round to oval. A key feature is the chromatin pattern, which is granular and stippled, often described as \"salt-and-pepper.\" This type of chromatin is highly characteristic of neuroendocrine neoplasms.\n    *   The cytoplasm is moderately abundant and eosinophilic (pink).\n    *   There is a lack of significant pleomorphism (variation in cell size and shape), high mitotic activity, or necrosis, which argues against a more aggressive or malignant process.\n\n3.  **Synthesize Findings and Formulate Diagnosis:** The cytological features of monotonous cells with \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin arranged in syncytial sheets are classic for a pituitary adenoma. This cytological diagnosis fits perfectly with the clinical and anatomical context of a mass in the sella turcica in a 28-year-old female.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to state this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef provide_diagnosis():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the diagnosis based on the clinical and pathological findings.\n    \"\"\"\n    patient_age = 28\n    location = \"sella turcica\"\n    \n    # Key Cytological Findings:\n    # 1. Monotonous population of cells\n    # 2. Round to oval nuclei\n    # 3. \"Salt-and-pepper\" stippled chromatin\n    # 4. Syncytial arrangement (indistinct cell borders)\n    # 5. Eosinophilic cytoplasm\n    \n    diagnosis = \"Pituitary Adenoma\"\n    \n    print(f\"Patient Age: {patient_age}\")\n    print(f\"Location of Mass: {location}\")\n    print(\"\\nBased on the classic neuroendocrine cytological features (monotonous cells with 'salt-and-pepper' chromatin) in the context of a sellar mass, the diagnosis is:\")\n    print(f\"\\nDiagnosis: {diagnosis}\")\n\nprovide_diagnosis()\n```\n<<<Pituitary Adenoma>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
