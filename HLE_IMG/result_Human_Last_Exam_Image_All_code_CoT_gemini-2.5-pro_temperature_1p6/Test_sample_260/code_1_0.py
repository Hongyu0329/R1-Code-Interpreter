    This function analyzes the provided image and text to determine the key themes.

    1.  Image Analysis:
        - A ghostly figure suggests something lost, a spirit or a memory.
        - The description explicitly names it a "lost small deity," pointing to forgotten religious beliefs.
        - The style is of an old, decaying photograph, indicating the passage of time and impermanence.

    2.  Poem Analysis:
        - "Velvet fades" refers to the impermanence of material objects.
        - A "photochromic lens" changes state, symbolizing the transient and temporary nature of things.

    3.  Conclusion:
        - Combining these, the primary themes are the fading of old religious systems and the overarching transient nature of existence itself.
        - This aligns best with option B.
