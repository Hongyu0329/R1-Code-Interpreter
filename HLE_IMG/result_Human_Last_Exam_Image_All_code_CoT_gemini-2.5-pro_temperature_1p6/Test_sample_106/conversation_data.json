    "This problem requires us to trace the substituents through a complex carbocation rearrangement known as the terpene backbone rearrangement.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis of the reaction mechanism:\n\n1.  **Protonation and Dehydration:** The reaction starts with the protonation of the hydroxyl (-OH) group on the A-ring of the starting molecule by the catalytic HCl. This forms a good leaving group, water (H₂O). The departure of water generates a secondary carbocation at that carbon (let's use standard triterpenoid numbering, C3).\n\n2.  **Carbocation Rearrangement Cascade:** The initial carbocation is unstable and undergoes a series of shifts to move the positive charge across the molecular skeleton, aiming for the most stable intermediate. The product's structure tells us where the rearrangement cascade terminates. The driving force for each step is the formation of a more stable carbocation (e.g., secondary to tertiary).\n\nLet's trace the movement of the carbocation (+) and the migrating groups (H or CH₃):\n\n*   **Initial state:** Carbocation at C3 (secondary).\n*   **Shift 1:** A methyl group (CH₃) from the adjacent C4 performs a [1,2]-shift to C3. This moves the positive charge to C4, forming a more stable tertiary carbocation.\n    *   *Result at C4 (position 1)*: Started with two CH₃ groups. One has migrated away. C4 is now (+).\n*   **Shift 2:** The hydrogen atom (H) from C5 performs a [1,2]-shift to C4. The positive charge moves to C5, which is also a tertiary center.\n    *   *Result at C4 (position 1)*: Now has one of its original CH₃ groups and has gained an H. Thus, **1 = CH₃**.\n*   **Shift 3:** The positive charge is now at C5. At this point, the standard backbone rearrangement would involve the migration of the methyl group from C10. However, this would lead to position 2 (C10) having a hydrogen atom, which contradicts the product diagram. A plausible alternative, which leads to the correct product, is a **[1,3]-hydride shift**, where the hydrogen from C9 migrates directly to C5. This is possible in rigid polycyclic systems. The positive charge moves to C9.\n    *   *Result at C10 (position 2)*: Its original CH₃ group does not migrate. Thus, **2 = CH₃**.\n*   **Shift 4:** The carbocation is now at C9. The methyl group from C8 performs a [1,2]-shift to C9. The positive charge moves to C8.\n    *   *Result at C9 (position 3)*: Started with an H. It lost this H in the previous step and has now gained a CH₃ group. Thus, **3 = CH₃**.\n*   **Shift 5:** The carbocation is at C8. The methyl group from C14 performs a [1,2]-shift to C8. The positive charge moves to C14.\n    *   *Result at C8 (position 4)*: Lost its original CH₃ group but gained a new one from C14. Thus, **4 = CH₃**.\n*   **Shift 6:** The carbocation is at C14. The hydrogen from C13 performs a [1,2]-shift to C14. The positive charge moves to C13.\n    *   *Result at C14 (position 5)*: Lost its CH₃ group and gained an H. Thus, **5 = H**.\n*   **Final Step (Elimination):** The cascade stops with the carbocation at C13. A proton is eliminated from the adjacent carbon (C12) to form the stable tetrasubstituted double bond seen in the final product.\n\n### Summary of substituents:\n*   Position 1 (C4) ends up with a **CH₃**.\n*   Position 2 (C10) keeps its original **CH₃**.\n*   Position 3 (C9) ends up with a **CH₃**.\n*   Position 4 (C8) ends up with a **CH₃**.\n*   Position 5 (C14) ends up with an **H**.\n\nThe following Python code will print the final answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Based on the mechanistic analysis of the acid-catalyzed rearrangement.\nsubstituents = {\n    1: \"CH3\",\n    2: \"CH3\",\n    3: \"CH3\",\n    4: \"CH3\",\n    5: \"H\"\n}\n\n# Print the result in the specified format.\n# \"Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\"\n# This is interpreted as formatting the output string to include each position number.\nprint(f\"1 = {substituents[1]}, 2 = {substituents[2]}, 3 = {substituents[3]}, 4 = {substituents[4]}, 5 = {substituents[5]}\")\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
