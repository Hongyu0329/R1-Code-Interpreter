def find_zurich_path():
    """
    This function finds the optimal path from Billoweg to Laubiweg based on the provided map and criteria.

    Here's a summary of the step-by-step analysis:

    1.  **Identify Start/End Points & Lines:**
        - Start: Billoweg is served by Tram 7 and Bus 185.
        - End: Laubiweg is served by Tram 9 and Bus 33.

    2.  **Criterion A: Minimize Exchanges:**
        - A 0-exchange path is impossible as no line serves both stations.
        - We look for 1-exchange paths. This requires starting on Line 7 (as Line 185 goes away from the destination) and transferring to Line 9 or Line 33.
        - Potential exchange points are where Line 7 intersects with Line 9 or 33. These include Winkelriedstr, Röslistr, Langmauerstr, Schaffhauserplatz (for Line 9), and Bahnhofplatz/HB, Schaffhauserplatz (for Line 33).

    3.  **Criterion B: Minimize Stations:**
        - We compare the total station count for all viable 1-exchange paths.
        - Path via (7 -> 9 @ Winkelriedstr): This path has 18 stations.
          - Leg 1 (Line 7, Billoweg -> Winkelriedstr): 14 stations.
          - Leg 2 (Line 9, Winkelriedstr -> Laubiweg): 5 stations.
          - Total: 14 + 5 - 1 (exchange station) = 18 stations.
        - All other 1-exchange paths, such as transferring at Schaffhauserplatz or Röslistr, result in a total of 19 stations. This is because Line 7 has an extra stop (Ottikerstr) compared to Line 9 on the segment between Winkelriedstr and Röslistr. Transferring to Line 9 at the earliest opportunity (Winkelriedstr) bypasses this extra stop.

    4.  **Conclusion:**
        - The path via Winkelriedstr is uniquely optimal because it has the fewest stations (18) among all paths with the minimum number of exchanges (1). Criteria C is not needed.

    5.  **Final Path Description:**
        - Start on Line 7, travel to Winkelriedstr, exchange to Line 9, and travel to Laubiweg.
