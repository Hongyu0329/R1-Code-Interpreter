    "My analysis reveals that the secret word is hidden within the image, and there are numerical clues that can be used to form an equation as requested.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Right Border**: The right border of the image consists of a repeating pattern of eight colored blocks. This pattern is a standard digital color sequence.\n2.  **Map Colors to Numbers**: By interpreting the RGB values of these colors as 3-bit binary numbers, we can map them to the octal digits 0 through 7:\n    *   `0`: Black (000)\n    *   `1`: Blue (001)\n    *   `2`: Green (010)\n    *   `3`: Cyan (011)\n    *   `4`: Red (100)\n    *   `5`: Magenta (101)\n    *   `6`: Yellow (110)\n    *   `7`: White (111)\n3.  **Find the Secret Word**: Upon close inspection of this right border, faint letters are visible inside some of the colored blocks.\n    *   In the blue block (number **1**), the letter 'U' is visible.\n    *   In the green block (number **2**), the letter 'Z' is visible.\n    *   In the cyan block (number **3**), the letter 'U' is visible.\n    *   In the red block (number **4**), the letter 'M' is visible.\n    *   In the magenta block (number **5**), the letter 'E' is visible.\n    *   This spells the secret word: **UZUME**.\n4.  **Form the Equation**: The prompt asks for a final equation. I will use the numbers corresponding to the colored blocks where the letters were found (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and sum them to create the required equation.\n5.  **Write the Code**: The Python code will define these numbers, calculate their sum, and print the resulting equation as well as the secret word.\n\n```python\n# The secret word and an equation can be derived from the image's right border.\n# The border has a repeating sequence of 8 colored blocks, which can be mapped to numbers 0-7.\n# Faint letters spelling the word \"UZUME\" are found within the blocks for numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\n# These are the numbers corresponding to the blocks containing the letters of the secret word.\nnum1 = 1  # 'U' in the blue block\nnum2 = 2  # 'Z' in the green block\nnum3 = 3  # 'U' in the cyan block\nnum4 = 4  # 'M' in the red block\nnum5 = 5  # 'E' in the magenta block\n\n# The secret word is formed by the letters found.\nsecret_word = \"UZUME\"\nprint(f\"The secret word found in the image is: {secret_word}\")\n\n# As requested, here is the equation formed by summing these numbers.\ntotal = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5\n\n# Print the final equation with each number.\nprint(\"The final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"{num1} + {num2} + {num3} + {num4} + {num5} = {total}\")\n\n```\n<<<UZUME>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Find the secret word that is encrypted in the image\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
