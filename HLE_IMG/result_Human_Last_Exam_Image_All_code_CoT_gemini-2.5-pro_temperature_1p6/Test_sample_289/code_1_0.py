# The location in the image is identified as Descanso, California.
# According to the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), its elevation is 3514 feet.
# The task is to provide this elevation in meters.

# Step 1: Define the elevation in feet.
elevation_in_feet = 3514

# Step 2: Define the conversion factor from feet to meters.
feet_to_meters_conversion_factor = 0.3048

# Step 3: Calculate the elevation in meters.
elevation_in_meters = elevation_in_feet * feet_to_meters_conversion_factor

# The official GNIS elevation in meters is 1071 m, which is the rounded result of the calculation.
# We will use the officially listed value.
official_elevation_in_meters = 1071
