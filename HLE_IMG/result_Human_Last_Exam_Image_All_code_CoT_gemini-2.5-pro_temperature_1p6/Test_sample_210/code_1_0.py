# The goal is to identify the nyala from the options (A, B, C, D, E, F)
# that matches the target nyala.

# We perform the identification by comparing unique features:
# 1. Horn Shape: The target's horns have a specific curve and length.
# 2. Stripe Pattern: The vertical stripes on the body have a particular spacing.
# 3. Spot Pattern: The random assortment of small white spots on the flanks is a key identifier.

# Detailed Comparison:
# - Target: Note the distinct cluster of white spots on the rear flank.
# - Image A: Different horn shape and overall younger appearance.
# - Image B: The spot pattern on the rear flank is a direct match to the target. The horn shape is also consistent.
# - Image C: Poor image quality prevents a reliable comparison.
# - Image D: The spot pattern does not match the target's.
# - Image E: Horn shape differs, and there is an anomalous band on the leg.
# - Image F: The visible flank has a different spot pattern (fewer spots).

# Based on the compelling match of the unique spot pattern and horn shape,
# image B shows the same nyala as the target.
