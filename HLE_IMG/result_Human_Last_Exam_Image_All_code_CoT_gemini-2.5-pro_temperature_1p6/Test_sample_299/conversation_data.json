    "I have analyzed the chessboard position to find the forced checkmate in two moves for White.\n\nHere is my thinking process:\n1.  **Analyze the initial position:** The Black King on e4 is very exposed. Many of its potential escape squares are already controlled by White's pieces.\n    *   `d3` is controlled by the Bishop on g1.\n    *   `e3` is controlled by the Rook on f3.\n    *   `f3` is occupied by the Rook on f3 and also attacked by the White King on h4.\n    *   `d4` is controlled by Black's own pawn on e5.\n    *   `f5` is controlled by the Rook on h5.\n    The Black King is trapped and cannot move. However, Black is not currently in check. This situation is called zugzwang, where any move Black makes will worsen its position.\n\n2.  **Find the key first move for White:** White needs to make a \"quiet\" move that maintains the king's cage while creating an unstoppable mating threat. A direct check could allow Black to escape.\n    *   The move is **1. Qd1**.\n    *   This move achieves two critical things:\n        a. It pins the Black Queen on d5 to the Black King on e4. The queen can no longer move.\n        b. It prepares a devastating mating threat on the next turn.\n\n3.  **Formulate the threat:** After 1. Qd1, White's threat is **2. Rhxf4#**. Let's verify this mate:\n    *   The Rook from h5 captures the pawn on f4, delivering check.\n    *   The Black King on e4 cannot escape:\n        *   `d3` is still covered by `Bg1`.\n        *   `e3` is still covered by `Rf3`.\n        *   `f3` is still covered by `Rf3` and `Kh4`.\n        *   `d4` is now covered by the White Queen on `d1`.\n        *   `d5` is covered by `Qd1` and the Knight on `e7`.\n        *   `f5` is covered by the Knight on `e7`.\n    *   This is a valid checkmate.\n\n4.  **Analyze Black's possible responses:** Since the Black King has no moves and the Queen is pinned, Black must move a Rook or a Pawn.\n    *   **Case 1: Black plays anything other than capturing the f4 pawn (e.g., `...fxg3`, `...Rc2`).**\n        *   White proceeds with the original plan and delivers mate with **2. Rhxf4#**.\n    *   **Case 2: Black tries to stop the threat directly by playing `1... exf4`.**\n        *   The pawn on e5 captures the pawn on f4. This removes the target for White's intended `Rhxf4#`.\n        *   However, this opens up a new mating line for White. White now plays **2. Rxh4#**.\n        *   The Rook from h5 moves to h4, delivering check. Let's verify this is mate:\n            *   The King on e4 cannot escape:\n                *   `d3` -> `Bg1`.\n                *   `e3` -> `Rf3`.\n                *   `f3` -> `Rf3`, `Kh4`.\n                *   `d4` -> `Qd1`.\n                *   `d5` -> `Qd1`, `Ne7`.\n                *   `f5` -> `Rxh4`.\n            *   This is also a checkmate.\n\nSince all of Black's possible responses lead to a checkmate on White's second move, the solution is correct.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n# This script does not require external libraries.\n\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the mate-in-2 solution for the given chess position.\n    \"\"\"\n    move1_white = \"1.
