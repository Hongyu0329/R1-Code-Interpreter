*   **Product A (C₁₄H₂₀N₂O₃):** The primary cycloaddition product followed by hydrolysis of the imine group. Its structure is methyl 7a-(4-aminobutanoyl)-2,3,5,6,7,7a-hexahydro-1H-pyrrolizine-1-carboxylate (structure shown in the generated image).
*   **Product B (C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₃):** A rearranged side-product. A plausible structure that fits the molecular formula is shown in the generated image. Its formation pathway is complex, likely involving intramolecular rearrangements of an intermediate.
*   **Product C (C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₃):** The N-acetylated starting material, which is the precursor to the reactive munchone intermediate. Its structure is N-acetyl-2-(1-pyrrolin-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid.
