    Analyzes and explains whether salience in the provided framework depends on learner differences.

    explanation = """Based on the provided text and diagram, the salience of diagnostic stimuli in this framework is defined by the objective properties of the simulation's design, not by the learner's individual differences.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1.  **Stimulus-Centered Framework:** The framework's core components of salience—Access, Prominence, Simplicity, and Clarity—are all described as characteristics of the diagnostic information and the simulation environment. They are design choices made to structure the learning experience.

2.  **Component Definitions:**
    *   **Access:** Refers to whether information is physically available in the simulation. This is a design decision.
    *   **Prominence:** Describes how much information stands out due to design elements like audiovisual cues. This is a property of the stimulus.
    *   **Simplicity:** Relates to the quantity and complexity of the information presented by the simulation.
    *   **Clarity:** Concerns how clearly the available information leads to a conclusion, which is an intrinsic quality of the information itself.

Nowhere in the definition of salience does the framework incorporate factors like the learner's prior knowledge, attention span, or cognitive abilities. While these individual differences will certainly affect how a learner *perceives* or *interacts* with the salient information, the framework itself defines salience as an inherent property of the stimuli being presented."""
