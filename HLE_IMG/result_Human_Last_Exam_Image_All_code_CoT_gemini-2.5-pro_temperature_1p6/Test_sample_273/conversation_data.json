    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will follow the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules for each of the three chiral centers.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **IUPAC Naming and Numbering:** First, we need to establish a consistent numbering for the carbon atoms. We find the longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional group (the hydroxyl group, -OH). This chain has 5 carbons. Numbering is started from the end that gives the -OH group the lowest possible number (locant 2).\n    *   The IUPAC name is: **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**.\n    *   This name tells us there are chiral centers at carbons C2, C3, and C4.\n\n2.  **Assign Priorities:** For each chiral center, we assign priorities (1-4) to the four attached groups based on atomic number. Higher atomic number gets higher priority.\n\n3.  **Determine R/S Configuration:**\n    *   Orient the molecule so the lowest priority group (4) points away from the viewer (on a dashed bond).\n    *   Trace the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   If the path is clockwise, the configuration is **R** (from the Latin *rectus*, right).\n    *   If the path is counter-clockwise, the configuration is **S** (from the Latin *sinister*, left).\n    *   If the lowest priority group is pointing towards the viewer (on a wedged bond), the determined configuration is the opposite of the true configuration.\n\nThe following Python code will print out the analysis for each chiral center.\n\n```python\ndef determine_configuration():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step determination of the absolute\n    configuration of the molecule provided in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: IUPAC Name and Chiral Centers Identification\")\n    print(\"-----------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The longest carbon chain containing the -OH group has 5 carbons.\")\n    print(\"Numbering from the right side of the main chain to give -OH the lowest number (2).\")\n    print(\"The IUPAC name is: 5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol.\")\n    print(\"The three chiral centers are at positions C2, C3, and C4.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Analysis of C2 ---\n    print(\"Step 2: Configuration at C2\")\n    print(\"----------------------------\")\n    print(\"Substituents on C2: -OH, -CH3 (C1), -C3, -H.\")\n    print(\"Priorities (CIP Rules):\")\n    print(\"1: -OH (highest atomic number O)\")\n    print(\"2: -C3 (connected to more carbons)\")\n    print(\"3: -CH3\")\n    print(\"4: -H (lowest priority)\")\n    print(\"The drawing for C2 is ambiguous (two dashed bonds).
