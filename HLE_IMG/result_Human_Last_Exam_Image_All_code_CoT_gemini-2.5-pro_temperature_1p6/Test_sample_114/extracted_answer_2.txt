The regioselectivity observed in Reaction 3, and the lack thereof in Reactions 1 and 2, is explained by the structure of the key reactive intermediate, a mesoionic compound known as a münchnone. All three reactions are examples of a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition where the münchnone acts as the 1,3-dipole. The regioselectivity of the cycloaddition is determined by the substituents at the two ends of this dipole (the C2 and C4 positions of the münchnone's oxazolium ring).

**Contribution of Reactions 1 and 2:** These reactions act as a critical control experiment. The starting material, N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine, forms a münchnone with methyl groups at both the C2 and C4 positions. Since these substituents are sterically and electronically very similar, there is no inherent preference for the cycloaddition of the unsymmetrical alkyne, methyl propiolate. This lack of directing influence results in a non-regioselective reaction. The 13C labeling study in Reaction 2 confirms this by showing that the two possible regioisomers are formed in a 1:1 ratio. This establishes the principle that a symmetrically substituted münchnone leads to a lack of regioselectivity.

**Reason for Regioselectivity in Reaction 3:** In Reaction 3, the starting material is N-acetylproline. The münchnone formed from it is highly asymmetric. The C2 position bears a small methyl group, but the C4 position is a significantly more sterically hindered bridgehead carbon atom, being part of a fused five-membered ring. This large difference in steric bulk is the controlling factor for regioselectivity. To minimize steric repulsion, the bulky ester group (`-COOCH3`) of the incoming methyl propiolate preferentially attacks the less hindered C2 position of the münchnone. This directed attack leads to the formation of a single regioisomer, Product B, in high yield.

In summary, the high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is the result of **steric control**, where the significant difference in steric hindrance between the C2 (methyl) and C4 (bridgehead) positions of the proline-derived münchnone intermediate dictates the orientation of the cycloaddition. Reactions 1 and 2 demonstrate that in the absence of such a steric differential, the reaction is unselective.
