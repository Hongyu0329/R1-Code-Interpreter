    "Based on the visual characteristics in the image, the epiphytic species can be identified. I will provide a Python script that outputs the name of the genus.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The image displays a dark, intricate, branching organism growing on the bark of a tree. This is an epiphyte. Its growth form is a dense, flat mat.\n2.  **Identify Key Features:** The organism is black or very dark brown. It's composed of very fine, branching, thread-like or wiry structures. This appearance, while somewhat resembling a filamentous lichen, is highly characteristic of a specific type of leafy liverwort when it's dry.\n3.  **Determine the Genus:** The branching pattern, dark color, and appressed mat-like growth on bark are classic features of liverworts in the genus *Frullania*, also known as scaleworts. Many species within this genus present this exact appearance.\n4.  **Create Python Code:** I will write a simple Python script to print the identified genus name.\n\n```python\n# The organism shown in the image is an epiphyte growing on tree bark.\n# It has a dark, almost black color and forms a dense, intricately branched mat.\n# This growth habit is characteristic of a leafy liverwort.\n# Based on these features, the genus can be identified.\n\n# Define the genus name in a variable.\ngenus_name = \"Frullania\"\n\n# Print the final answer.\nprint(f\"The genus of the epiphytic species in the image is: {genus_name}\")\n```\n<<<Frullania>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the genus of the epiphytic species in this image? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
