    Calculates the four possible substitution patterns for the two carboxylic
    acid groups on the cubane product based on the Favorskii rearrangement.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. There are two independent Favorskii rearrangements.
    2. Each rearrangement converts a ketone to a carboxylic acid, which attaches
       to one of the original alpha-carbons.
    3. The first ketone's alpha-carbons are C3 and C6.
    4. The second ketone's alpha-carbons are C7 and C8.
    5. The four possible products result from combining one position from the
       first set {3, 6} with one from the second set {7, 8}.
