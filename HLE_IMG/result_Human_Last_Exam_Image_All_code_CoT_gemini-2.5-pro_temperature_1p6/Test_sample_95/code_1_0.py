# Step 1: Define the known radius of the yellow circle.
r_yellow = 0.5  # cm

# Step 2: Determine the radius of the white circle (R) based on the geometry.
# The key insight comes from the top boundary being tangent to both the white circles and the yellow circles.
# This geometric constraint leads to the relationship: R_white = 4 * r_yellow.
R_white = 4 * r_yellow
print(f"The radius of a yellow circle is {r_yellow} cm.")
print(f"From geometric analysis, the radius of a white circle (R) is 4 times the yellow radius.")
print(f"The equation for the white circle's radius is: 4 * {r_yellow} = {R_white} cm.\n")

# Step 3: Calculate the x-coordinate of the center of the right-most column of circles.
# We set the origin (0,0) at the bottom-left corner.
# The layout from left to right is: green rectangle (width R), 3 white circles (diameter 2R each), green rectangle (width R).
# The center of the first column of circles is at x = R (rectangle) + R (radius) = 2R.
# The center of the second column is at x = 2R + 2R = 4R.
# The center of the third (right-most) column is at x = 4R + 2R = 6R.
x_center = 6 * R_white
print("The x-coordinate of the center of the right-most white circles is 6 * R.")
print(f"The equation for the x-coordinate is: 6 * {R_white} = {x_center} cm.\n")

# Step 4: Calculate the y-coordinate for the middle circle in the right-most column.
# First, find the y-coordinate of the centers of the bottom row of circles (Y_1).
# This is derived from the tangency between the bottom-row white circles and the yellow circles on the floor.
# The equation is Y_1 = r + sqrt(r^2 + 2*R*r).
Y_1 = r_yellow + math.sqrt(r_yellow**2 + 2 * R_white * r_yellow)
print("The y-coordinate of the bottom row of circles (Y_1) is found using the tangency with the bottom yellow circles.")
print(f"The equation for Y_1 is: {r_yellow} + sqrt({r_yellow}^2 + 2 * {R_white} * {r_yellow}) = {Y_1} cm.")

# The y-coordinate of the center of the middle-row circle is Y_1 + 2R, as the rows are stacked and touching.
y_center = Y_1 + 2 * R_white
print("\nThe y-coordinate of the center of the right-most, middle circle is Y_1 + 2 * R.")
print(f"The equation for the y-coordinate is: {Y_1} + 2 * {R_white} = {y_center} cm.\n")

# Step 5: Final Answer
print(f"The center of the right-most white circle (middle row) is at x:y = {x_center}:{y_center}.")
