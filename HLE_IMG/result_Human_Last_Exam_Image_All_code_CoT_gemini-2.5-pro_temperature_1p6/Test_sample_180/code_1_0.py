    print("   - A. SH3 domain: Binds proline-rich sequences. No such repeating pattern.")
    print("   - B. Leucine zipper: Has a heptad repeat with conserved hydrophobic residues at positions 'a' and 'd'. This would be a simpler `X-X-X-Conserved-X-X-Conserved` repeating pattern, which does not match the long spacer in the image.")
    print("   - C. EGF-like domain: Defined by 6 conserved Cysteines. Does not match the repeating structure.")
    print("   - D. PH domain: Globular domain, no simple repeating pattern.")

    print("   - The highly conserved red bars in the image perfectly match the positions of the two Cysteines (C) and two Histidines (H) required to bind a zinc ion.")

    print("     - Cysteine (Conserved)")
    print("     - X(2-4): A spacer of 2 to 4 variable amino acids. The image shows a spacer of approximately 2-3.")
    print("     - Cysteine (Conserved)")
    print("     - X(12): A longer spacer of approximately 12 amino acids, which forms the alpha-helix that binds DNA. The image shows a long spacer of this length.")
    print("     - Histidine (Conserved)")
    print("     - X(3-5): A spacer of 3 to 5 variable amino acids. The image shows a spacer of approximately 3-4.")
    print("     - Histidine (Conserved)")
