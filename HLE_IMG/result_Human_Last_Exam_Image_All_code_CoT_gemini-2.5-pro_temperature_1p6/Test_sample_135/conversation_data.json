    "Here is my plan to identify the author of the artwork:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visuals:** I will examine the image to identify the subject, style, and medium. The image shows a religious scene—a priest administering communion to kneeling figures—carved in relief within a decorative circular frame (a tondo). The style is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance.\n2.  **Identify Key Text:** I will zoom in on the inscription at the bottom of the tondo. It reads \"SACRAMENTI DE LAVTEL,\" which appears to be an archaic spelling for \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" a term for the Eucharist.\n3.  **Formulate a Search:** I will use the identified elements—\"Renaissance tondo,\" \"Eucharist,\" and the specific inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE LAVTEL\"—to search for the artwork and its creator.\n4.  **Synthesize Findings:** The search quickly links the inscription and the artwork to a famous series of seven tondos depicting the sacraments.\n5.  **State the Conclusion:** Based on the search results from reliable art history sources, I will identify the renowned 15th-century Florentine sculptor responsible for this work and present the name in the required format.\n\n```python\ndef identify_artist():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the steps to identify the artist of the provided artwork\n    and prints the conclusion.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Plan to identify the author of the artwork:\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Analyze the artwork's features\n    subject = \"The Sacrament of the Eucharist\"\n    style = \"Italian Renaissance relief sculpture (tondo)\"\n    inscription = \"SACRAMENTI DE LAVTEL\"\n    print(f\"1.
