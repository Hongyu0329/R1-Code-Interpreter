    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** I will visually inspect the provided raster plot. Synchronized bursts are characterized by dense, vertical columns of black dots, indicating that many neurons (electrodes) are firing at nearly the same time. I will estimate the center timestamp for each of these prominent bursts.\n2.  **Estimate Timestamps:** By observing the x-axis (Time in seconds), I will identify the time for each burst. I have identified four distinct bursts.\n3.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals:** The inter-burst interval (IBI) is the time elapsed between two consecutive bursts. I will calculate the difference in timestamps between each pair of adjacent bursts.\n4.  **Calculate the Average IBI:** I will sum all the calculated inter-burst intervals and divide by the number of intervals to find the average.\n5.  **Round the Result:** The final answer will be rounded to two significant figures as requested.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script to perform the calculations, display the steps clearly, including the identified timestamps, the calculated intervals, the full equation for the average, and the final rounded answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_average_ibi():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies synchronized burst timestamps from a graph,\n    calculates the inter-burst intervals (IBIs),\n    and computes the average IBI.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify and list the timestamps of synchronized bursts.\n    # Visually inspecting the graph, dense vertical bands of firing activity\n    # are prominent at approximately these times in seconds.\n    burst_timestamps = [3, 17, 36, 49]\n    print(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the inter-burst intervals.\n    # The interval is the difference in time between consecutive bursts.\n    intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\n    print(f\"Calculated inter-burst intervals (s): {intervals.tolist()}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the average inter-burst interval.\n    sum_of_intervals = np.sum(intervals)\n    number_of_intervals = len(intervals)\n    average_interval = np.mean(intervals)\n\n    # Step 5: Format the final answer to two significant figures.\n    # We use format specifiers to handle the rounding.\n    num_sig_figs = 2\n    formatted_average = f\"{average_interval:.{num_sig_figs}g}\"\n\n    # Print the detailed calculation steps\n    print(\"\\n--- Calculation of Average Inter-Burst Interval ---\")\n    interval_sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, intervals))\n    print(f\"Average = ({interval_sum_str}) / {number_of_intervals}\")\n    print(f\"Average = {sum_of_intervals} / {number_of_intervals}\")\n    print(f\"Average = {average_interval:.4f} s\")\n    print(f\"\\nResult rounded to two significant figures: {formatted_average} s\")\n\n# Execute the function to get the result\ncalculate_average_ibi()\n```\n<<<15>>>"
