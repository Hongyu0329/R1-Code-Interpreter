def solve_ca_puzzle():
    """
    This function solves the cellular automaton visualization puzzle by identifying the correct sequences.
    Based on the detailed step-by-step analysis, the sequences are determined as follows:
    - Rule 1 (t=2,3,4,5): Starts with the smallest pattern (G), evolves through L and I, ending in B.
    - Rule 2 (t=3,4,5,6): Starts with a central pattern (C), which becomes a series of hollow shapes (H, O, M).
    - Rule 3 (t=4,5,6,7): Represents a rule that generates four distinct, evolving blobs (F -> J -> K -> D).
    - Rule 4 (t=5,6,7,8): Starts with sparse patterns (N, A), fragments further (E), and consolidates into the largest pattern (P).
