    "This image is a famous Apulian red-figure volute-krater, attributed to the Darius Painter, dating to around 340-330 BC. It depicts a scene from Greek mythology.\n\nMy plan to identify the figure is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the iconography**: I will examine the key elements of the scene: the chariot, the figures in it, the winged figure above, and the person on the ground.\n2.  **Identify the myth**: The combination of a chariot race, a male driver, a female passenger, a winged victory goddess (Nike), and a fallen opponent points to a specific, well-known myth. This is the story of the race between Pelops and King Oenomaus for the hand of the king's daughter, Hippodamia.\n3.  **Identify the specific figures**: Based on the myth, the victorious driver is Pelops, the woman beside him is Hippodamia, and the defeated man on the ground is her father, King Oenomaus.\n4.  **Answer the question**: The question asks who is \"leaving the chariot.\" In the context of the myth and the visual depiction of the crash, the figure who has just been violently ejected from, and thus \"left,\" his own chariot is the man on the ground, Oenomaus. The artwork combines the end of the race (Pelops' victory) with its dramatic cause (Oenomaus's crash).\n\nI will now provide a Python script that explains this identification and prints the name of the figure.\n\n```python\ndef identify_figure_on_vase():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the figure leaving the chariot on the Apulian vase painting.\n\n    The vase depicts the myth of the chariot race between Pelops and King Oenomaus.\n    - The victorious charioteer is Pelops.\n    - The woman with him is Hippodamia, whom he has won.\n    - The figure on the ground has been thrown from his own chariot during the race.\n    This man, who has unwillingly 'left' his chariot, is King Oenomaus.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The characters in the myth depicted are:\n    victorious_charioteer = \"Pelops\"\n    female_passenger = \"Hippodamia\"\n    fallen_king = \"Oenomaus\"\n    winged_goddess = \"Nike (Victory)\"\n\n    # The question \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\" refers to the person\n    # who has been ejected from their chariot as a result of the race's crash.\n    figure_leaving_the_chariot = fallen_king\n\n    print(\"The scene shows the conclusion of the mythical chariot race for the hand of Hippodamia.\")\n    print(f\"The man on the ground is King {figure_leaving_the_chariot}, who has crashed and fallen from his chariot.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the figure leaving the chariot is:\")\n    print(figure_leaving_the_chariot)\n\nidentify_figure_on_vase()\n```\n<<<Oenomaus>>>"
