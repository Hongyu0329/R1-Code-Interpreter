    # Step 1: Analyze the symbols. The limiting factor is not the classical math symbols,
    # but the use of the '@' symbol combined with the specific 'Computer Modern' font.
    # This typography points to the TeX typesetting system.
    
    # Step 2: Identify the first year of the limiting technology.
    # The first version of TeX was created by Donald Knuth in 1978.
