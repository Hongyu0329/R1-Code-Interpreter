    Calculates and explains the minimum number of moves for the Simplicity puzzle.

    The puzzle can be modeled as a 2x2 grid of larger 2x2 blocks.
    - P1: Top-Left block
    - P2: Top-Right block
    - P3: Bottom-Left block

    The goal is to move R to the Top-Left position.
    A move is a cyclic shift of a row or column of these blocks.
