# Step-by-step reasoning leads to these (plot_number, m_value) pairs.
# This code assembles the result and prints it in the required format.

# Band Structure Assignments
bs_assignments = {
    1: 1,  # Metallic, off-k=0 -> Chiral (4,1)
    3: 2,  # Semiconducting, medium gap -> (4,2)
    5: 0,  # Semiconducting, largest gap -> (4,0)
    7: 4,  # Metallic, k=0 crossing -> Armchair (4,4)
    9: 3   # Semiconducting, smallest gap -> (4,3)
}

# Oscillator Strength Assignments
os_assignments = {
    2: 4,  # Armchair (vertical lines) -> (4,4)
    4: 2,  # Semiconducting Chiral -> (4,2) by elimination
    6: 1,  # Metallic Chiral (lines through K) -> (4,1)
    8: 0   # Zigzag (horizontal lines) -> (4,0)
}

# Combine assignments into a single dictionary
all_assignments = {**bs_assignments, **os_assignments}

# Order the m_values by plot number (1 through 9)
ordered_m_values = [all_assignments[i] for i in range(1, 10)]

# Format the output string as requested
output_string = "{" + ", ".join(map(str, ordered_m_values)) + "}"
