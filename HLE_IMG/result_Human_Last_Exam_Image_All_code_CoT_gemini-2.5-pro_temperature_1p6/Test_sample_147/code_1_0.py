    # A note on the '.x' syntax: While `vec3(vec3(...).x)` would technically result in a grayscale image by
    # discarding the G and B calculations, it makes the code highly inefficient and strange. In the context of
    # identifying the image, it is more likely that the chromatic aberration effect was intended and the '.x' is a typo,
    # or the visual clue of aberration is paramount.

    # Step 2: Analyze the shape produced by the Worley/dist functions.
    # The `dist` function uses `sqrt(uv.x*uv.x+uv.y*uv.y)`, which calculates Euclidean distance. This
    # typically produces circular, organic-looking cells, as seen in image B.
    # However, the function also prominently uses `floor(a * size) / size`. The `floor` function
    # introduces sharp, axis-aligned steps into the calculation. This is a strong indicator for
    # blocky or rectangular shapes.

    print(" - The use of `sqrt` points towards the smooth, organic cells seen in image B.")
    print(" - However, the prominent use of `floor()` introduces sharp, grid-aligned features. This points towards the rectangles seen in image A.")

    # Step 3: Synthesize the clues.
    # We must choose the image that best fits all the available clues.
    # - Image A shows rectangles WITH chromatic aberration.
    # - Image B shows organic cells WITH chromatic aberration.
    # The code contains explicit instructions for both chromatic aberration and features that produce sharp, axis-aligned shapes (`floor`).
    # Image A is the only option that contains both of these specific features. It's the most likely candidate,
    # assuming the `floor()` function's effect is dominant in creating the shape, and the chromatic aberration code works as intended.

    print("\nStep 3: Combining the clues, we have strong evidence for both chromatic aberration and rectangular shapes.")
    print(" - Image A is the only one that has both rectangles and chromatic aberration.")
    print(" - Image B has chromatic aberration but the wrong shape (organic cells).")
    print(" - Image F's pattern does not match.")
    print("\nTherefore, the shader most likely generates image A, as it combines the rectangular nature hinted at by `floor()` with the color separation from the offset UV coordinates.")
