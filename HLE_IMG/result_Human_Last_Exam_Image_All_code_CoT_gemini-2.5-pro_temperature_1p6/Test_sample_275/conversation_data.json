    "To find the total number of splice species, we must carefully analyze each panel of the RT-PCR gel, counting each unique transcript product as a distinct species.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Examine Each Gel Panel:** Go through panels B through I one by one.\n2.  **Identify Unique Bands:** For each panel, look at the primer pair used and the resulting bands. A band (or a set of bands) represents a PCR product from one or more mRNA transcripts (splice species).\n3.  **Count New Species:** If a band's size or the primer pair used to generate it reveals a transcript with a splicing pattern not seen in previous panels, count it as a new species.\n4.  **Avoid Double Counting:** Be careful not to count the same species twice. For example, Panel C confirms the findings of Panel B, so it doesn't introduce new species. Panel I is a more sensitive version of Panel H, so we should use the results from Panel I for that primer pair.\n5.  **Sum the Results:** Add up the number of unique species found from each informative panel to get the total.\n\nThe python code below implements this logic by assigning the number of new species found in each informative experiment to a variable and then summing them to find the total.\n\n```python\ndef solve_splice_species_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided RT-PCR data to count the total number of unique splice species.\n    Each band or set of bands in an experiment that cannot be explained by previous experiments \n    indicates one or more new splice species.
