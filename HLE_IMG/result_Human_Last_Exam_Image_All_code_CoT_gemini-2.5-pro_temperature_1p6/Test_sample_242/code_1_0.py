def solve_metathesis():
    """
    Solves the alkene metathesis stereochemistry problem.

    This function follows a logical deduction based on the conservation of substituents and analysis of the answer choices.
    
    1.  **Substituent Inventory:** The starting material has two methyl (Me) groups and two hydrogen (H) atoms at its four key stereocenters.
        - One Me is 'UP'.
        - One Me is 'DOWN'.
        - One H is 'UP'.
        - One H is 'DOWN'.
    
    2.  **Analyze Answer Choices:** The options propose different combinations for the final substituents R1, R2, R3, R4. Choices A, B, and F suggest two Me and two H groups, but in a different arrangement ({R1, R2}=Me, {R3, R4}=H). Choices C, D, and E suggest {R1, R2}=H and {R3, R4}=Me. This second grouping ({H,H,Me,Me}) matches the inventory from the starting material.

    3.  **Evaluate Option C:** R1 = H UP, R2 = H UP, R3 = Me DOWN, R4 = Me DOWN.
        - **R3 and R4 are Methyl groups:** This implies the two methyl groups from the starting material's bridgeheads end up at positions R3 and R4.
            - The starting material has one Me group DOWN, which can directly become R3=Me DOWN.
            - The starting material has one Me group UP. For it to become R4=Me DOWN, an inversion of its stereocenter must occur during the complex cascade, which is plausible to achieve a stable product.
        - **R1 and R2 are Hydrogen atoms:** This implies the two hydrogens from the side-chain-bearing carbons in the starting material end up at positions R1 and R2. The confusing notation 'R1=H UP, R2=H UP' likely means the hydrogen atoms at the two relevant stereocenters both end up in the UP orientation.
            - The starting material has one H UP, which can become R1=H UP.
            - The starting material has one H DOWN. For it to become R2=H UP, an inversion must occur.
    
    4.  **Conclusion:** Although the reaction involves complex rearrangements and potential inversions at stereocenters, Option C provides a consistent accounting of all the substituents. The stoichiometry is correct, and a plausible (though not simple) stereochemical pathway can be rationalized.
