    "This is a challenging request as it requires knowledge of music theory and history to identify the piece from the sheet music. Based on the melody and chord structure, I can identify the song and its context.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Melody:** The opening melodic phrase in the first two bars is `E-E-F-G | G-F-E-D...`. This is the iconic opening of the song \"When the Saints Go Marching In\".\n2.  **Analyze the Harmony and Style:** The sheet music includes chord symbols like C, G7, F, E7, A-, etc. The use of these chords, the syncopated rhythm, and the lead sheet format (melody + chords) are characteristic of a jazz arrangement. Specifically, this song is a staple of the **Dixieland** (or Traditional Jazz) style.\n3.  **Determine the Origin:** \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" is a traditional American gospel hymn that became a jazz standard. Therefore, its country of origin is the **United States**.\n4.  **Construct the Python Code:** I will create a Python script to print out the identified information: the title, musical style, and country of origin.\n\n```python\ndef get_song_information():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about the song in the sheet music.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"When the Saints Go Marching In\"\n    musical_style = \"Dixieland / Traditional Jazz (originally an American Gospel Hymn)\"\n    country_of_origin = \"United States\"\n\n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Musical Style: {musical_style}\")\n    print(f\"Country of Origin: {country_of_origin}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_song_information()\n```\n<<<Title: When the Saints Go Marching In, Musical Style: Dixieland / Traditional Jazz, Country of Origin: United States>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
