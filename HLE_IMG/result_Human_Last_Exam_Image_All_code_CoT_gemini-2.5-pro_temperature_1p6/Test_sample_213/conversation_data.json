    "This is the orchestral score for the prelude to the second act of an opera.\n\nHere's my plan to identify it:\n1.  **Analyze the text and markings:** The instrument names (\"gr. Fl.\", \"Hob.\", \"engl. Horn\", \"Fag.\", \"Viol.\", \"Br.\") and instructions are in German (\"die übrigen\", \"mit Dämpfer\", \"Vorhang\"). This strongly suggests a German opera. The term \"(Vorhang)\" means \"(Curtain)\", indicating this music is played as the curtain rises. The prompt states it's the opening of the second act.\n2.  **Analyze the musical style:** The music is for a large orchestra. The harmony is very dense and chromatic, which is characteristic of the late-Romantic period, particularly the works of composers like Richard Wagner or Richard Strauss.\n3.  **Synthesize and identify:** Combining these clues—a German opera from the late-Romantic period with a famous and dramatic opening to its second act—points towards Richard Wagner's work. By comparing this specific musical passage with the scores of Wagner's operas, it is a clear match for the beginning of Act 2 of *Tristan und Isolde*. The tense, rushing string passages and woodwind calls are iconic features of this particular prelude.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to state the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_opera_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the opera based on visual analysis of the provided sheet music.\n  \n  Clues identified:\n  1. Language: German (e.g., \"Vorhang\", \"mit Dämpfer\").\n  2. Context: Opening of Act 2, as the curtain rises.\n  3. Musical Style: Late-Romantic, highly chromatic, large orchestra.\n  \n  Conclusion: The music is the prelude to Act 2 of Richard Wagner's opera, Tristan und Isolde.\n  \"\"\"\n  opera_name = \"Tristan und Isolde\"\n  print(f\"The opera is: {opera_name}\")\n\nfind_opera_name()\n```\n<<<Tristan und Isolde>>>"
