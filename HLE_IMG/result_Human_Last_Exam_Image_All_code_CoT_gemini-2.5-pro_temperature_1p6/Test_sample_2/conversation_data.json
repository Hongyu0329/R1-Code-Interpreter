    "My plan is to determine the time complexity of the provided sorting algorithm by analyzing its recursive structure.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Algorithm:** I will examine the `sort(a, n)` function to identify its base case and recursive steps.\n2.  **Formulate a Recurrence Relation:** The key to analyzing recursive algorithms is to express their running time `T(n)` as a function of the running time of smaller inputs. The code makes two recursive calls on a problem of size `n-1` and performs a constant amount of work in between. This will allow me to write a recurrence relation for `T(n)`.\n3.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:** I will solve the recurrence relation using the expansion (or substitution) method. This involves repeatedly substituting the relation into itself until a pattern emerges that can be expressed in a closed form related to `n`.\n4.  **Find the Big-O Complexity:** From the solved recurrence, I will determine the dominant term to find the asymptotic time complexity in Big-O notation, which describes the algorithm's performance as the input size `n` grows large.\n5.  **Construct Python Code:** As requested, I will provide a Python script that prints this detailed analysis.\n\n```python\ndef print_complexity_analysis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a step-by-step analysis of the given algorithm's time complexity.\n    \"\"\"\n    analysis_text = \"\"\"\nStep-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Algorithm Structure:**\n    The provided algorithm is a recursive function `sort(a, n)`.\n    -   Base Case: The recursion terminates when `n <= 1`. An array of size 1 or 0 is already considered sorted. This takes constant time, which we can denote as T(1) = c.\n    -   Recursive Step: For `n > 1`, the function performs three main actions:\n        1.  It calls itself with a smaller problem size: `sort(a, n - 1)`.\n        2.  It performs a constant number of operations: one comparison (`if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`) and one potential swap (`swap(...)`).\n        3.  It calls itself again with the same smaller problem size: `sort(a, n - 1)`.\n\n2.  **Recurrence Relation Formulation:**\n    Let T(n) represent the time complexity for `sort(a, n)`. Based on the structure above, we can write a recurrence relation. The total time is the sum of the times for its parts:\n    -   T(n) = (Time for first recursive call) + (Time for comparison/swap) + (Time for second recursive call)\n    -   T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1) + T(n - 1)\n    -   This simplifies to: T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c (where c is a constant representing the O(1) work).\n\n3.  **Solving the Recurrence Relation:**\n    We can solve this by repeatedly expanding the T(n - 1) term:\n    -   T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c\n    -   T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c\n    -   T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c\n    -   After i steps, a pattern emerges: T(n) = 2^i * T(n - i) + c * (2^(i-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)\n\n    The sum is a geometric series equal to 2^i - 1. So, T(n) = 2^i * T(n - i) + c * (2^i - 1).\n\n    We continue until we hit the base case T(1), which happens when n - i = 1, or i = n - 1. Substituting i = n - 1:\n    -   T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)\n\n4.  **Determining the Big-O Complexity:**\n    The final equation for T(n) is `2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * 2^(n-1) - c`.\n    Since T(1) and c are constants, the term that grows fastest as n increases is 2^(n-1).\n    In Big-O notation, we ignore constant coefficients and lower-order terms.\n    Therefore, the time complexity is O(2^(n-1)), which is equivalent to O(2^n).\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The time complexity of this algorithm is O(2^n). This exponential growth makes the algorithm highly inefficient for anything but very small inputs.\n\"\"\"\n    print(analysis_text)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print_complexity_analysis()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
