    "To determine the longest R-R interval in seconds from the ECG rhythm strip, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the ECG Paper Standard:** The ECG paper speed is noted as 25 mm/sec. The grid on the paper consists of small 1 mm squares and large 5 mm squares.\n    *   The time duration of one small square (1 mm) is `1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds`.\n    *   The time duration of one large square (5 mm) is `5 * 0.04 sec = 0.2 seconds`.\n\n2.  **Locate the Longest R-R Interval:** I will visually scan the entire rhythm strip to find the largest distance between two consecutive R-waves (the highest peaks of the QRS complexes). There are several noticeable pauses. The most distinct one is in the fourth strip (labeled with timestamp 0:06:08).\n\n3.  **Measure the Interval:** I will measure this longest interval by counting the number of small squares between the peaks of the two R-waves.\n    *   Observing the pause in the fourth strip, the interval starts on a major grid line and ends approximately one small square after the 7th subsequent major grid line.\n    *   This corresponds to a distance of 7 large squares plus 1 small square.\n    *   Total number of small squares = `(7 * 5) + 1 = 36` small squares.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Time in Seconds:** I will multiply the number of small squares by the time duration of a single small square to get the final answer.\n\nI will now write a Python script to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rr_interval():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the longest R-R interval from an ECG strip.\n\n    This function uses standard ECG paper measurements and visual analysis\n    of the provided image to determine the duration of the longest R-R interval.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # ECG paper speed in mm/sec, as stated on the strip\n    paper_speed_mm_per_sec = 25\n\n    # Each small square on the grid is 1 mm.\n    # Time for one small square (sec) = 1 mm / (paper_speed_mm_per_sec)\n    time_per_small_square_sec = 1 / paper_speed_mm_per_sec\n\n    # From visual inspection of the ECG, the longest R-R interval spans\n    # approximately 36 small squares. This is observed in the fourth strip,\n    # where a pause spans 7 large squares (7 * 5 = 35 small squares) plus\n    # one additional small square.\n    longest_interval_in_small_squares = 36\n\n    # Calculate the total duration of the interval in seconds.\n    longest_rr_interval_sec = longest_interval_in_small_squares * time_per_small_square_sec\n\n    print(\"ECG Analysis for Longest R-R Interval\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"Paper Speed: {paper_speed_mm_per_sec} mm/sec\")\n    print(f\"Time per small square: 1 mm / {paper_speed_mm_per_sec} mm/sec = {time_per_small_square_sec:.2f} seconds\")\n    print(f\"Longest measured interval in small squares: {longest_interval_in_small_squares}\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    print(f\"{longest_interval_in_small_squares} small squares * {time_per_small_square_sec:.2f} sec/square = {longest_rr_interval_sec:.2f} seconds\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer:\")\n    print(f\"The longest R-R interval is {longest_rr_interval_sec:.2f} seconds.\")\n\ncalculate_rr_interval()\n```\n<<<1.44>>>"
