    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each artwork to identify the author:\n\n1.  **Top-left:** This painting portrays women from an ethnic minority group. The signature and red seal in the upper right corner, along with the distinct artistic style characterized by dynamic brushwork and vivid depiction of figures, are hallmarks of **Huang Zhou (黄胄)**.\n2.  **Top-middle:** This is an ink wash sketch of a landscape. The style, focusing on lines, dots, and planes to construct the form and abstracting the scenery, is characteristic of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**, who was famous for such sketches and oil paintings.\n3.  **Top-right:** This piece is Chinese calligraphy in a very fluid and powerful cursive script. This distinctive, bold, and uninhibited calligraphic style is immediately recognizable as that of **Mao Zedong (毛泽东)**.\n4.  **Middle-left:** This is another example of Chinese calligraphy. The signature on the far left reads \"石涛\" (**Shitao**), a renowned artist from the early Qing dynasty. The expressive and individualistic style is consistent with his known works.\n5.  **Middle-center:** This is a well-known oil painting in the style of academic realism. It is titled \"Youth\" (《青年女歌手》) and is a famous work by **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**.\n6.  **Middle-right:** This painting features a stylized female figure. The composition, the use of color, and the distinctive facial features (elongated face, fine lines) are stylistic traits of **Lin Fengmian (林风眠)**, a pioneer of modern Chinese painting.\n7.  **Bottom-left:** This vibrant painting shows a rustic scene with loofah gourds and laundry. The signature \"吴冠中\" (**Wu Guanzhong**) and the date \"一九九六\" (1996) are visible in the lower-left corner. The style, which merges Chinese aesthetics with Western modern art elements, confirms the artist.\n8.  **Bottom-middle:** This is a landscape painting of a river gorge with numerous boats. This theme, along with the use of layered ink washes to create depth and dramatic light effects, is a signature style of **Li Keran (李可染)**.\n9.  **Bottom-right:** This painting shows a lobster executed with simple, masterful brushstrokes. Painting aquatic life like shrimp, crabs, and lobsters was a favorite subject of **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**, and this work is a classic example of his style.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the author of each of the 9 works and prints the names.\n    \"\"\"\n    authors = [\n        \"Huang Zhou\",\n        \"Wu Guanzhong\",\n        \"Mao Zedong\",\n        \"Shitao\",\n        \"Jin Shangyi\",\n        \"Lin Fengmian\",\n        \"Wu Guanzhong\",\n        \"Li Keran\",\n        \"Qi Baishi\"\n    ]\n    \n    print(\"From left to right, top to bottom, the authors are:\")\n    for i, author in enumerate(authors, 1):\n        print(f\"Work {i}: {author}\")\n        \n    final_answer = \", \".join(authors)\n    # The final answer format is specified as <<<answer content>>>\n    # The user request asks for a list of authors.\n    # So I will present the final answer as a comma-separated string.\n    # print(f\"\\n<<< {final_answer} >>>\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Huang Zhou, Wu Guanzhong, Mao Zedong, Shitao, Jin Shangyi, Lin Fengmian, Wu Guanzhong, Li Keran, Qi Baishi>>>"
