# Based on the step-by-step analysis of each knot:
# K1: Not an unknot (Figure-eight knot).
# K2: Isotopic to the unknot (simplifiable via Reidemeister moves).
# K3: Isotopic to the unknot (simplifiable via a Reidemeister II move).
# K4: Not an unknot (composite knot).
# K5: Isotopic to the unknot (simplifiable via Reidemeister moves).
# K6: Not an unknot (Cinquefoil knot).

# The list of indices i for which K_i is isotopic to the unknot is [2, 3, 5].
unknot_indices = [2, 3, 5]
