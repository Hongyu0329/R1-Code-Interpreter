    "My plan is to identify the figure in the icon by analyzing its specific artistic style, the attributes shown (like the scroll and Cyrillic text), and comparing them to known iconography of the saints listed in the answer choices. I will use this visual evidence to perform a search and find the exact identity, artist, and origin of this particular icon. Finally, I will write a Python script to print the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_icon_identity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided icon to determine the identity of the saint depicted.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\n    1.  Initial Analysis: The image displays a classic Orthodox Christian icon of an elderly male saint. Key features include a long white beard, a golden halo, dark monastic-style robes, and a scroll with text written in an early form of Cyrillic script (Church Slavonic). The figure's elongated proportions and serene expression are characteristic of a specific school of icon painting.\n\n    2.  Iconographic Details: The figure is holding a scroll, which is a common attribute for prophets in Orthodox iconography, as it represents their written prophecies or teachings. While other holy figures like monastic fathers can also be shown with scrolls, it is a primary identifier for prophets.\n\n    3.  Specific Identification: A search for this specific icon reveals that it is a world-famous masterpiece. It is the fresco of the \"Prophet Moses\" painted by the renowned Russian iconographer Dionisius (Dionisy) around 1502. It is part of the iconostasis of the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Theotokos in the Ferapontov Monastery, a UNESCO World Heritage site in Russia.\n\n    4.  Conclusion: Although Prophet Moses is most famously associated with the Tablets of the Law, he is depicted here in his role as a prophet and lawgiver, holding a scroll with his teachings. The historical and artistic record definitively identifies the figure as Moses the Prophet. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation).strip())\n\nsolve_icon_identity()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
