    1.  Initial Analysis: The image displays a classic Orthodox Christian icon of an elderly male saint. Key features include a long white beard, a golden halo, dark monastic-style robes, and a scroll with text written in an early form of Cyrillic script (Church Slavonic). The figure's elongated proportions and serene expression are characteristic of a specific school of icon painting.

    2.  Iconographic Details: The figure is holding a scroll, which is a common attribute for prophets in Orthodox iconography, as it represents their written prophecies or teachings. While other holy figures like monastic fathers can also be shown with scrolls, it is a primary identifier for prophets.

    3.  Specific Identification: A search for this specific icon reveals that it is a world-famous masterpiece. It is the fresco of the "Prophet Moses" painted by the renowned Russian iconographer Dionisius (Dionisy) around 1502. It is part of the iconostasis of the Cathedral of the Nativity of the Theotokos in the Ferapontov Monastery, a UNESCO World Heritage site in Russia.

    4.  Conclusion: Although Prophet Moses is most famously associated with the Tablets of the Law, he is depicted here in his role as a prophet and lawgiver, holding a scroll with his teachings. The historical and artistic record definitively identifies the figure as Moses the Prophet. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.
