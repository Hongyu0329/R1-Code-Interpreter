    "Here is my plan to solve this music theory problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Key:** I'll first determine the musical key of the piece by examining the key signature (the flats or sharps at the beginning of the staff).\n2.  **Locate the Measure:** I'll find measure 30 on the provided sheet music. The measures are numbered, making this straightforward.\n3.  **Analyze the Harmony:** I will identify the notes being played in both the right hand (treble clef) and left hand (bass clef) in measure 30. This measure contains a change in harmony.\n4.  **Determine the Function:** I'll analyze the chords in relation to the home key. The first chord in the measure is a dissonant chord that resolves to the second chord. This kind of resolution, where one chord \"leans\" into the next, is key to understanding the function. The second chord, the chord of resolution, represents the primary harmony of the measure.\n5.  **Assign the Roman Numeral:** Based on the chord's root and quality (major, minor, etc.) relative to the key's scale, I will assign the correct Roman numeral. I will write a Python script to print this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_roman_numeral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, 1st mov.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify the key.\n    # The key signature has three flats (B-flat, E-flat, A-flat).\n    # The piece is the \"Pathetique\" Sonata, which is in the key of C minor.\n    key = \"C minor\"\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the harmony in measure 30.\n    # Measure 30 contains two distinct harmonies.\n    \n    # On beat 1, the notes are:\n    # Left Hand (Bass): C\n    # Right Hand (Treble): A-natural, C, E-flat\n    # This forms a dissonant chord that functions as a large-scale appoggiatura.\n    \n    # On beat 2, the notes resolve to:\n    # Left Hand (Bass): G\n    # Right Hand (Treble): G, B-natural, D\n    # This combination of notes forms a G major triad.\n    chord_notes = \"G, B-natural, D\"\n    chord_name = \"G Major\"\n    \n    # Step 3: Determine the chord's function and Roman numeral.\n    # In the key of C minor, the fifth scale degree is G.\n    # A chord built on the fifth degree is the Dominant chord.\n    # It is standard practice in a minor key to raise the 7th degree (B-flat to B-natural)\n    # to create a major Dominant chord, which has a stronger pull back to the tonic.\n    # A G Major chord in the key of C minor is the Dominant.\n    roman_numeral = \"V\"\n\n    # Step 4: Print the final answer.\n    # The harmony of the measure is defined by the chord of resolution, the Dominant.\n    print(f\"The key is: {key}\")\n    print(f\"The structural chord in measure 30 is: {chord_name} ({chord_notes})\")\n    print(f\"In the key of {key}, this chord is the Dominant.\")\n    print(f\"The correct Roman numeral is: {roman_numeral}\")\n\nsolve_roman_numeral()\n```\n<<<V>>>"
