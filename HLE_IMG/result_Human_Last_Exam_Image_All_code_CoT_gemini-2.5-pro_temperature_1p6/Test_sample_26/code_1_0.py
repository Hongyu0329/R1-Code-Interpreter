    This script determines the Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's "Pathetique" Sonata, 1st mov.

    # Step 1: Identify the key.
    # The key signature has three flats (B-flat, E-flat, A-flat).
    # The piece is the "Pathetique" Sonata, which is in the key of C minor.
    key = "C minor"

    # Step 2: Analyze the harmony in measure 30.
    # Measure 30 contains two distinct harmonies.
    
    # On beat 1, the notes are:
    # Left Hand (Bass): C
    # Right Hand (Treble): A-natural, C, E-flat
    # This forms a dissonant chord that functions as a large-scale appoggiatura.
    
    # On beat 2, the notes resolve to:
    # Left Hand (Bass): G
    # Right Hand (Treble): G, B-natural, D
    # This combination of notes forms a G major triad.
    chord_notes = "G, B-natural, D"
    chord_name = "G Major"
    
    # Step 3: Determine the chord's function and Roman numeral.
    # In the key of C minor, the fifth scale degree is G.
    # A chord built on the fifth degree is the Dominant chord.
    # It is standard practice in a minor key to raise the 7th degree (B-flat to B-natural)
    # to create a major Dominant chord, which has a stronger pull back to the tonic.
    # A G Major chord in the key of C minor is the Dominant.
    roman_numeral = "V"

    # Step 4: Print the final answer.
    # The harmony of the measure is defined by the chord of resolution, the Dominant.
    print(f"The key is: {key}")
    print(f"The structural chord in measure 30 is: {chord_name} ({chord_notes})")
    print(f"In the key of {key}, this chord is the Dominant.")
    print(f"The correct Roman numeral is: {roman_numeral}")
