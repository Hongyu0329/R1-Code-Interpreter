# The side length of the red hexagon.
s = 3.0

# The area of a regular hexagon is given by the formula A = (3 * sqrt(3) / 2) * s^2.
# Based on the geometric principle of equidecomposition for tessellations,
# we assume the area of the white shape is equal to the area of the red hexagon.

# We calculate the values for the equation step by step.
s_squared = s ** 2
sqrt_3 = math.sqrt(3)
numerator = 3 * sqrt_3
fraction = numerator / 2
area = fraction * s_squared
