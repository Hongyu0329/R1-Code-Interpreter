    "This is a great puzzle! Based on the sheet music, I can identify the piece for you. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  I will first analyze the key characteristics of the music, such as the key signature, tempo, dynamics, and the prominent melodic theme.\n2.  The piece is in C minor (though notated with accidentals instead of a key signature). It has a tempo of quarter note = 80. The most striking features are the quiet, simple opening melody (G-G-G-Eb) that abruptly transitions into a loud, fast, and dramatic section with running sixteenth notes.\n3.  This specific melody and the dramatic shift are highly recognizable. I will use this musical information to identify the title and composer.\n4.  The piece is \"Vogel im Käfig\" by Hiroyuki Sawano, famously from the anime series *Attack on Titan*. The sheet music provided is a piano arrangement of this iconic track.\n5.  I will now generate a Python script to print the name of the song and its composer.\n\n```python\ndef guess_the_music():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the music from the provided sheet music.\n    The analysis reveals the piece to be from a well-known anime series.\n    \"\"\"\n    composer = \"Hiroyuki Sawano\"\n    piece_title = \"Vogel im Käfig\"\n    source = \"Attack on Titan (Shingeki no Kyojin)\"\n    \n    print(f\"The music is '{piece_title}' by {composer}, from the anime '{source}'.\")\n\nguess_the_music()\n```\n<<<Vogel im Käfig by Hiroyuki Sawano>>>"
