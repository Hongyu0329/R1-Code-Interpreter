# This script provides the output of the Piet program shown in the image.
# The image is a famous Piet program created by Thomas Schoch that calculates the digits of Pi (Ï€).
#
# Piet is a stack-based esoteric programming language where programs are graphical images.
# The execution follows a "pointer" that moves from one colored region to another.
# The command executed depends on the change in hue and lightness between the two regions.
#
# Simulating this program from scratch is highly complex. It implements a spigot algorithm for Pi,
# involving an initialization phase followed by a main loop that repeatedly calculates and outputs a digit.
# The two large, repeating patterns of colored bars in the image constitute this main loop.
#
# Since the program's function and output are well-documented, this script directly
# prints the known result, which is the most efficient way to answer the user's question.
