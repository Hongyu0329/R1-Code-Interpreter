    Solves the riddle by transforming the output of the given Piet program.

    The Piet program in the image is the standard "Hello, world!" program.
    The task is to take this output string, reverse it, and convert it to lowercase.
    This script starts with the ASCII codes for "Hello, world!", which represents
    the "numbers in the final equation" that the Piet program manipulates.
