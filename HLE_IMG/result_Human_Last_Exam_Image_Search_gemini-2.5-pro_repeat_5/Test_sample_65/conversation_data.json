    "The bryophyte in the image belongs to the genus *Ptilidium*.\n\nThis leafy liverwort is distinguished by its unique appearance, where the leaves are deeply divided into multiple, narrow segments that are fringed with fine, hair-like projections called cilia. This intricate structure gives the plant a feathery or fuzzy look. The leaves are densely packed and overlapping, contributing to the characteristic curled or wavy form seen in the photograph.\n\n*Ptilidium* is the sole genus in the family Ptilidiaceae and includes three species: *Ptilidium californicum*, *Ptilidium ciliare*, and *Ptilidium pulcherrimum*. These species are typically found in arctic and subarctic regions, growing in dense mats. The coloration can range from golden-green to a distinct reddish-brown. The plant in the image, with its vibrant green and brownish lower parts, is consistent with the appearance of *Ptilidium*.\n\n<<<Ptilidium>>>"
