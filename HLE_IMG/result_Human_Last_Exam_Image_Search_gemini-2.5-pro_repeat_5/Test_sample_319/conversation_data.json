    "The phenomenon illustrated in the image is known as the **auditory continuity illusion** or **perceptual restoration of sound**.\n\nThis auditory illusion occurs when a sound, such as a pure tone, is interrupted by a short burst of another sound, like broadband noise. If the interrupting noise is sufficiently loud and shares the right characteristics to mask the gap, the listener's brain perceptually \"fills in\" the missing portion, leading to the experience of an uninterrupted, continuous tone. The spectrogram in the image visually represents this: a tone (the horizontal line) is physically replaced by a burst of noise (the vertical bar), yet the auditory system perceives the tone as continuing through it.\n\nThis perceptual restoration is a fundamental capability of our auditory system that helps in understanding speech and music in noisy environments, where parts of the signal might be momentarily obscured. The brain uses the context provided by the sounds before and after the interruption to create a coherent and continuous auditory experience. The illusion is so effective that listeners may not even notice that a portion of the sound was missing.\n\nThe comparison to the Necker Cube is apt because, like visual bistable perception, the auditory continuity illusion demonstrates that our perception is an active and constructive process, rather than a passive reception of sensory data. Your brain is presented with an ambiguous stimulus and settles on the most plausible interpretation, which in this case is that the tone continued behind the noise.\n\n<<<auditory continuity illusion>>>"
