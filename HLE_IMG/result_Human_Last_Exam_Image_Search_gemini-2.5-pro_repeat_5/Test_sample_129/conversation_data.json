    "This protein is **Hen Egg-White Lysozyme (HEWL)**.\n\nThis image displays the three-dimensional ribbon structure of hen egg-white lysozyme, a small enzyme consisting of a single chain of 129 amino acids. The structure is cataloged in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under the accession code 1HEW. In this representation, the N-terminus, or the beginning of the polypeptide chain, is colored light blue.\n\nLysozyme is an antimicrobial enzyme that functions as part of the innate immune system by damaging the cell walls of bacteria. It is found in secretions like tears and saliva. The specific structure shown is from the organism *Gallus gallus* (the domestic chicken) and was deposited into the PDB in 1992. This particular visualization represents the enzyme complexed with an inhibitor, tri-N-acetylchitotriose.\n\n<<<Hen Egg-White Lysozyme>>>"
