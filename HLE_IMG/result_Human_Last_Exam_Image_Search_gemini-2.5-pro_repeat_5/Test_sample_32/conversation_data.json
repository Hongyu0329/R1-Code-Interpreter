    "The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that helps distinguish both species at a glance is the orientation of the seta (the stalk that supports the capsule).\n\n*   In **Grimmia montana**, the seta is **straight**. This means the capsule is held erect.\n*   In **Grimmia curviseta**, the seta is **arcuate**, meaning it is curved or bent.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward way to tell these two species apart when they have sporophytes is to observe whether the capsule is held on a straight or a curved stalk.\n\n<<<The key distinguishing feature of the sporophyte is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has an arcuate (curved) seta.>>>"
