    "The reaction scheme involves three sequential steps to transform the starting material into the final product. To determine the molecular formula of the product, each step is analyzed to see how the molecular formula changes.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction Steps:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Starting Material to Intermediate 1**\n    *   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is N-(p-methoxybenzyl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. Its molecular formula is C15H14F3NO2.\n    *   **Reagents:** Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in acetonitrile (ACN) and water (H2O).\n    *   **Reaction:** CAN is a strong oxidizing agent commonly used for the deprotection of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) groups from nitrogen atoms. This reaction cleaves the bond between the nitrogen and the PMB group, replacing the PMB group with a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Change in Formula:** The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom is added. This results in a net loss of C8H8O.\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** The molecular formula becomes C(15-8)H(14-8)F3N1O(2-1), which simplifies to **C7H6F3NO**. This intermediate is 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Intermediate 1 to Intermediate 2**\n    *   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2) in methanol (MeOH).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. The Pd/C catalyst facilitates the addition of hydrogen across the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the bicyclic ring system. This type of reaction is highly selective for alkenes and typically does not affect other functional groups present, such as the lactam (cyclic amide) or the trifluoromethyl (CF3) group.\n    *   **Change in Formula:** One molecule of H2 is added to the structure.\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** The molecular formula of Intermediate 1 (C7H6F3NO) changes by +H2, resulting in **C7H8F3NO**. The structure is now saturated: 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Intermediate 2 to Product**\n    *   **Reagents:** 4 N Hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 70 Â°C.\n    *   **Reaction:** These conditions (strong acid and heat) cause the hydrolysis of the lactam (cyclic amide) bond (N-C=O). During hydrolysis, a water molecule (H2O) is added across the amide bond, cleaving it to form a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an amine (-NH2). Under the acidic conditions, the amine will be protonated to an ammonium salt (-NH3+).\n    *   **Change in Formula:** One molecule of H2O is added to Intermediate 2.\n    *   **Product:** The molecular formula of Intermediate 2 (C7H8F3NO) changes by +H2O, resulting in **C7H10F3NO2**. This final product is an amino acid: 4-amino-3-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy following the transformation through the three reaction steps, the molecular formula of the final product is determined to be C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
