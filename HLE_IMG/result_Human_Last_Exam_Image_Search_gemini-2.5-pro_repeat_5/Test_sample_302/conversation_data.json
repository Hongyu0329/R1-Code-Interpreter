    "The characters on the seal, written in an ancient Chinese script known as seal script (篆書, zhuànshū), are **为善不誉** (wéi shàn bù yù) in simplified Chinese.\n\nThe standard reading order for four-character seals is from top to bottom, and from right to left. Following this convention, the characters are identified as:\n\n*   **Top Right:** 为 (wéi) - meaning \"to do\" or \"to act\"\n*   **Bottom Right:** 善 (shàn) - meaning \"good\" or \"virtuous\"\n*   **Top Left:** 不 (bù) - meaning \"not\"\n*   **Bottom Left:** 誉 (yù) - meaning \"fame\" or \"praise\"\n\nWhen combined, the phrase **为善不誉** (wéi shàn bù yù) translates to \"do good without seeking fame\" or \"a good deed is its own reward.\" This reflects a virtuous sentiment often found on personal seals, which can express the owner's values or philosophy. The phrase appears in classical Chinese texts, such as the *Zhuangzi*, which discusses the concept of acting virtuously without concern for recognition.\n\n<<<为善不誉>>>"
