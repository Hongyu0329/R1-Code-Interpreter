    "The provided image is a well-known example of a \"Hello, world!\" program written in the esoteric programming language Piet. In Piet, the program's execution flow and commands are determined by the changes in color between adjacent blocks of pixels.\n\nThis specific program is designed to push the ASCII values of the characters in \"Piet\" onto the stack and then print them to the standard output.\n\nThe execution can be summarized as follows:\n*   The program starts in the top-left light red block.\n*   It pushes the value 80 (ASCII for 'P') onto the stack.\n*   It then moves through a sequence of colored blocks, each transition corresponding to a command in Piet. These commands manipulate the stack to produce the necessary ASCII values for 'i', 'e', and 't'.\n*   For each character, a value is pushed onto the stack and then outputted as a character.\n*   After printing \"Piet\", the program enters the black block on the far right, which terminates the program.\n\nTherefore, the output of the code is the word \"Piet\".\n\n<<<Piet>>>"
