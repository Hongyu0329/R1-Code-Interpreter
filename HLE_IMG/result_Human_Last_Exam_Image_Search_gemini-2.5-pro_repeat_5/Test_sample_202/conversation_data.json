    "The provided image displays four distinct rock specimens labeled H, I, J, and K. A close examination of their textures and compositions allows for their identification.\n\n**Specimen H is Scoria.** This rock is characterized by its reddish-brown color and numerous visible, bubble-like cavities, known as vesicles. This vesicular texture is the result of gases escaping from cooling lava. Scoria is typically dark in color (brown, black, or reddish) and can have a composition similar to basalt. The red coloration is often due to the oxidation of iron-rich minerals.\n\n**Specimen I is Breccia.** This rock is composed of large, angular fragments of other rocks that have been cemented together in a finer-grained matrix. The term \"breccia\" originates from an Italian word meaning \"rubble.\" The angular nature of the fragments indicates that they were not transported far from their source before being lithified. Breccias can form through various geological processes, including sedimentary, volcanic, and tectonic activity.\n\n**Specimen J is Pumice.** This specimen is a light-colored, highly porous volcanic rock. Pumice is formed from frothy, gas-rich lava that has cooled rapidly. Its structure contains so many vesicles, or air pockets, that it often has a very low density and can float on water. It is typically light in color, ranging from white to light gray or tan. While both pumice and scoria are vesicular, pumice is generally lighter in color and less dense than scoria.\n\n**Specimen K is Pegmatite.** This rock is distinguished by its very large, interlocking crystals, which are typically larger than one centimeter in diameter. This coarse-grained texture indicates that the magma from which it formed cooled very slowly, allowing for the growth of large crystals. Pegmatites are often granitic in composition, primarily containing minerals such as quartz and feldspar, which appear as light gray or white and pinkish crystals, respectively. They can also contain a variety of other minerals.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
