    "This problem requires identifying the substituents at five specific positions in the product of a complex acid-catalyzed rearrangement of a triterpenoid. The prompt indicates that the reaction involves \"a number of shifts,\" which is characteristic of a \"backbone rearrangement\" common in terpene chemistry.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The starting material is a triterpenoid alcohol, and the conditions are catalytic acid (HCl) and heat (110°C). This results in a dehydration (loss of H₂O) and subsequent carbocation rearrangement to form a new alkene product (C₃₀H₅₀). Although the drawing of the starting material closely resembles β-amyrin, the clue about numerous shifts and the structure of the product point towards the classic **friedelane-oleanane rearrangement**. In this reaction, a friedelane skeleton rearranges to a more stable oleanane skeleton.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Rearrangement Mechanism:** The rearrangement is initiated by the formation of a carbocation, which then triggers a cascade of sequential and stereospecific-hydride and-methyl shifts along the carbon backbone. The positive charge effectively moves across the ring system until it is quenched by eliminating a proton to form a stable double bond. The specific product shown is consistent with an olean-13(18)-ene skeleton.\n\n3.  **Trace the Substituents:** To determine the final substituent at each numbered position, we must track where the original methyl groups (CH₃) and hydrogen atoms (H) migrate during the cascade.\n    *   **Position 1 (at C-4):** This position receives a methyl group that migrates from the original C-5 position. Therefore, the substituent is **CH₃**.\n    *   **Position 2 (at C-10):** This position receives a hydrogen atom that migrates from the original C-9 position. Therefore, the substituent is **H**.\n    *   **Position 3 (at C-8):** This position receives a methyl group that migrates from the original C-14 position. Therefore, the substituent is **CH₃**.\n    *   **Position 4 (at C-14):** This position receives a hydrogen atom that migrates from the original C-13 position. Therefore, the substituent is **H**.\n    *   **Position 5 (at C-17):** This position is not part of the main backbone rearrangement cascade. It retains its original methyl group. Therefore, the substituent is **CH₃**.\n\nBased on this analysis of the rearrangement, the substituents are identified as follows:\n\n1 = CH₃, 2 = H, 3 = CH₃, 4 = H, 5 = CH₃\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = H, 5 = CH3>>>"
