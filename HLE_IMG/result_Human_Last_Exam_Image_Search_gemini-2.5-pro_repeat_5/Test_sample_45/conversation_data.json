    "The tiling shown in the image exhibits **5-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\nThis type of tiling is an example of a Penrose tiling, which is a well-known type of aperiodic tiling. A key characteristic of Penrose tilings is that while they lack the translational symmetry of regular repeating patterns, they do possess local 5-fold rotational symmetry. This means that there are points within the tiling around which the pattern can be rotated by 72° (360°/5) and appear unchanged.\n\nIn the provided image, these centers of 5-fold symmetry can be seen in the middle of the star-shaped and sun-shaped motifs. The presence of 5-fold symmetry is a distinguishing feature of quasicrystals, as traditional periodic crystals are restricted to 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold rotational symmetries.\n\n<<<5-fold>>>"
