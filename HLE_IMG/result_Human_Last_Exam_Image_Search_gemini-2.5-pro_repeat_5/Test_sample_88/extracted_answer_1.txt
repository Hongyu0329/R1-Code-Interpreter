*   **Product A (C₁₄H₂₀N₂O₃):** Formed from the reaction of the mixed anhydride intermediate (C) with methyl propiolate, followed by the loss of CO₂.
*   **Product B (C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₃):** Formed from the Michael addition of the starting material to methyl propiolate, followed by cyclization and elimination of methanol.
*   **Product C (C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₃):** The mixed anhydride formed from the reaction of the starting material's carboxylic acid with acetic anhydride.
