The key reason for the high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is the conformational rigidity of the bicyclic m√ºnchnone intermediate derived from proline. This rigidity creates a sterically well-defined environment that dictates a single mode of cycloaddition. The results from Reactions 1 and 2, which use a flexible acyclic amino acid, show a lack of regioselectivity. This serves as a crucial point of comparison, demonstrating that the absence of such conformational locking allows multiple reaction pathways to occur, thereby preventing a regioselective outcome.
