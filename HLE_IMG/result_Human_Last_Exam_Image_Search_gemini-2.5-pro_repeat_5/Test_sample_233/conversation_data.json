    "The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image fragment is identified as **Sö 281**. This identification is based on the visible runes and their arrangement, which match photographs and transcriptions of this specific stone.\n\nThe Sö 281 runestone is one of the approximately 26 Ingvar runestones, which are memorials to those who participated in a Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled. This expedition took place between 1036 and 1041. Many of the participants, including Ingvar, died from disease.\n\nOriginally used as a doorstep in Strängnäs Cathedral, the runestone was later incorporated into the church wall in 1863. The inscription on Sö 281 commemorates a brother of a man named Ulf who traveled with Ingvar to Serkland, a term used in Old Norse sources to refer to the \"land of the Saracens\".\n\nThe visible runes in the provided image fragment, such as \"...ᚦᚬᚱᛅᛁᚾ...\" (...þorain...), \"...ᛋᛏᛅᛁᚾ...\" (...stain...), and \"...ᚴᛅᚱᚦᛁ...\" (...karþi...), are consistent with the known inscription of Sö 281.\n\n<<<Sö 281>>>"
