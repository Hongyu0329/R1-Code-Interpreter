    "The knot in the image is identified as the prime knot 9_42.\n\nBased on tables of knot invariants, the Jones polynomial for this knot is derived from the coefficient list: 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1. When arranged in decreasing degree order, the polynomial is:\n\n$t^3 - t^2 + t - 1 + t^{-1} - t^{-2} + t^{-3}$\n\n<<<t^3 - t^2 + t - 1 + t^-1 - t^-2 + t^-3>>>"
