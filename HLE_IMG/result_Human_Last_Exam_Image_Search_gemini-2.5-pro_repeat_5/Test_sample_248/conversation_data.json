    "The organisms in the image include several types of barnacles and snails. The most clearly identifiable species that serves as a definitive indicator of an Atlantic coast location is the common periwinkle, distinguished by its robust, conical shell which is often dark and banded.\n\nThe scientific name of this species is *Littorina littorea*. This snail is native to the northeastern Atlantic coasts of Europe and was introduced to the Atlantic coast of North America in the mid-19th century. It is now abundant on the rocky shores of the Northwest Atlantic, with a range extending from Labrador, Canada, down to Delaware, USA.\n\nWhile *Littorina littorea* has been occasionally found on the U.S. Pacific coast in locations like San Francisco Bay, these introductions have not resulted in established, self-sustaining populations. Therefore, its presence as a dominant, thriving species in a photograph of a rocky intertidal zone, as depicted, strongly indicates the picture was taken on the Atlantic coast.\n\nOther organisms in the photo, such as the rock barnacles, are likely *Semibalanus balanoides*. This species is found on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America, making it an unreliable indicator for distinguishing between the two oceans.\n\n<<<*Littorina littorea*>>>"
