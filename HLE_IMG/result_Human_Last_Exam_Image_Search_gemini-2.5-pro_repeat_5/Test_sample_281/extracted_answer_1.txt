The four-terminal conductance is given by the formula:

$G_{12,34} = \frac{M(M-N)}{N} \frac{e^2}{h}$

where:
*   $M$ is the number of spin-degenerate edge states.
*   $N$ is the number of edge states reflected by the quantum point contact.
*   $e$ is the elementary charge.
*   $h$ is Planck's constant.
*   $\frac{e^2}{h}$ is the fundamental unit of conductance.
