    "The image provided is completely black and does not show any molecules. To determine the relationship between two molecules (i.e., whether they are constitutional isomers, stereoisomers, conformers, or identical), their chemical structures must be visible for comparison.\n\nWithout the structures of the molecules, it is impossible to answer the question. Please provide the image showing the molecules in question."
