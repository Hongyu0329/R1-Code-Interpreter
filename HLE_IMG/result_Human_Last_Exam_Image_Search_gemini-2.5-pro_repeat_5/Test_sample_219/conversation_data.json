    "Based on the provided graph, the synchronized bursts of neuronal firing activity are identified at the following approximate timestamps:\n\n*   **Burst 1:** 2 s\n*   **Burst 2:** 15 s\n*   **Burst 3:** 26 s\n*   **Burst 4:** 36 s\n*   **Burst 5:** 48 s\n\nThe inter-burst intervals, which is the duration between the start of consecutive bursts, are calculated as follows:\n\n*   **Interval 1:** 15 s - 2 s = 13 s\n*   **Interval 2:** 26 s - 15 s = 11 s\n*   **Interval 3:** 36 s - 26 s = 10 s\n*   **Interval 4:** 48 s - 36 s = 12 s\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is the sum of these intervals divided by the number of intervals:\n\nAverage Inter-burst Interval = (13 s + 11 s + 10 s + 12 s) / 4 = 46 s / 4 = 11.5 s\n\nRounding the result to two significant figures gives 12 s.\n\n<<<12>>>"
