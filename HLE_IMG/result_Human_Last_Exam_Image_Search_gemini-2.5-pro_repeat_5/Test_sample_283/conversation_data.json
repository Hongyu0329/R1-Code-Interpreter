    "Based on the analysis of the Google Trends graph, the country in question is the United States. The peaks in search interest correspond to three significant historical commemorations.\n\nThe evidence is as follows:\n*   **Red Line:** This line shows distinct peaks at the beginning of December each year. This timing aligns with the anniversary of the attack on **Pearl Harbor** on December 7, 1941, a pivotal event in U.S. history that is widely remembered annually.\n*   **Blue Line:** The blue line consistently peaks at the end of May. This corresponds with **Memorial Day**, a U.S. federal holiday observed on the last Monday of May to honor and mourn the military personnel who have died while serving in the United States Armed Forces.\n*   **Yellow Line:** This line has two recurring peaks. The most prominent one is in early June, which aligns with the anniversary of **D-Day** (June 6, 1944), the Allied invasion of Normandy during World War II. A smaller, secondary peak occurs in late August/early September, which corresponds to the commemoration of **V-J Day** (Victory over Japan Day), marking the end of World War II in August/September 1945. These two events are cornerstones of American historical memory of the Second World War.\n\nThe combination of these three specific, annually recurring patterns of public interest points directly to historical events of major significance to the United States.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
