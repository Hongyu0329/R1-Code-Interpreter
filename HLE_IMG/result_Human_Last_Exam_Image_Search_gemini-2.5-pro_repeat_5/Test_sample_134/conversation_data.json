    "This molecule is **cyclocarbon**.\n\nIt is an allotrope of carbon with the molecular formula C₁₈. The molecule consists of a ring of eighteen carbon atoms connected by alternating single and triple bonds, making it a polyyne and a cyclocarbon.\n\nFirst synthesized in 2019 by researchers at IBM and the University of Oxford, cyclocarbon is the smallest cyclo[n]carbon predicted to be relatively stable. Its structure was confirmed through high-resolution atomic force microscopy. The electronic structure consists of alternating triple and single bonds, which suggests it behaves as a semiconductor.\n\nCyclocarbon is a subject of significant research interest due to its unique properties and potential applications in molecular electronics and the synthesis of other carbon allotropes.\n\n<<<cyclocarbon>>>"
