    "The title of the 19th-century painting is **\"A Windmill and Houses beside Water: Stormy Sky\"**.\n\nThis work was painted by the Dutch artist Jacob Maris (1837-1899), likely between 1880 and 1890. The painting is a characteristic example of Maris's views of the Dutch countryside and is noted for its depiction of a dramatic, stormy sky that dominates the composition. It was previously known by the title *La Tourmente*, which translates to 'Turmoil' or 'Turbulence'. The artist employed a loose, sketchy style with thick paint, which is a hallmark of his later works.\n\n<<<A Windmill and Houses beside Water: Stormy Sky>>>"
