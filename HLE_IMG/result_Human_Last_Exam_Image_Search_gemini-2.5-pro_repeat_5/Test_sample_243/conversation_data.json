    "The plant in the image is the Saint Helena olive (*Nesiota elliptica*). This species was endemic to the island of Saint Helena, a remote island in the South Atlantic Ocean.\n\nDespite its name, the Saint Helena olive is not related to the true olive but belongs to the Rhamnaceae family, which includes buckthorns. The plant was a small, heavily branched tree with dark green, oblong leaves that had prominent veins. It grew in the cloud forests in the higher parts of the island.\n\nThe species became exceedingly rare due to deforestation and grazing by introduced animals following the island's settlement. In 1977, a single surviving tree was discovered. Despite extensive conservation efforts, the last wild tree died in 1994, and the final cultivated individual perished in December 2003, rendering the species extinct. Several other plant species from Saint Helena have also gone extinct since the 16th century.\n\n<<<Saint Helena>>>"
