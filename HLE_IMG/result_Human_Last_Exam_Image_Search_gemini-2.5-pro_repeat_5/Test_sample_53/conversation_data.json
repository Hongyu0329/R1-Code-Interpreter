    "The image on the vase depicts a famous scene from Greek mythology: the death of King Oenomaus during a chariot race. The figure leaving the chariot is **Oenomaus**.\n\nThis scene is part of the myth of Pelops and Hippodamia. King Oenomaus had a beautiful daughter, Hippodamia, and was warned by a prophecy that he would be killed by his son-in-law. To prevent this, he challenged each of his daughter's suitors to a chariot race. If the suitor won, he would win Hippodamia's hand; if he lost, he would be killed. Having been given divine horses by his father, Ares, Oenomaus had killed many suitors.\n\nPelops, the next suitor, conspired with Oenomaus's charioteer, Myrtilus, to win the race. Myrtilus replaced the bronze linchpins of the king's chariot with ones made of wax. During the race, the wax melted, the wheels flew off, and King Oenomaus was thrown from his chariot and killed.\n\nThe vase painting captures this dramatic moment. We see:\n*   **Oenomaus**, the nude male figure, falling from the collapsing chariot.\n*   **Pelops** as the victorious driver in the chariot, identifiable by his distinctive Phrygian cap and decorated clothing.\n*   **Nike**, the winged goddess of Victory, flying towards Pelops to crown him.\n*   **Hippodamia** is likely the female figure seated beside Pelops in the chariot.\n\nThis particular vase is an Apulian red-figure pelike, dating to around 370-360 BC and is attributed to the Policoro Painter. The depiction of this myth was a popular theme on South Italian vases.\n\n<<<Oenomaus>>>"
