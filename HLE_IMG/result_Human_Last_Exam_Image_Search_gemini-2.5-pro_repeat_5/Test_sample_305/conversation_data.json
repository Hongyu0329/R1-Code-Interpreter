    "The product featured in the \"Women are winning the War - of Freedom\" advertisement from 1942 is Tampax. This brand of internal sanitary protection was marketed as a revolutionary product that allowed women to continue working in factories and other war-effort jobs without interruption.\n\nHowever, another product that heavily targeted women war workers with claims of overcoming limitations like fatigue was Phyllosan. While the specific headline in the provided image is associated with Tampax, the image of the woman working on the tank was also widely used in advertisements for Phyllosan tablets. These ads claimed the product could revitalize and strengthen individuals to cope with the strain of war work. The slogan for this product was famously \"Phyllosan fortifies the over-forties\".\n\nAnother French-derived product, though not associated with this specific advertisement, is Chartreuse. This French liqueur, made by Carthusian Monks since 1737 from a combination of 130 herbs and plants, has also been described as a tonic.\n\n<<<Tampax>>>"
