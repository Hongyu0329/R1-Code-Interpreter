*   **Microorganism Type:** Fungus (Yeast)
*   **Morphology:** Budding yeast cells and pseudohyphae. The combination of these two forms is characteristic of dimorphic fungi, most notably *Candida* species.
*   **Stain:** The magenta-colored organisms against a blue/teal background are indicative of a Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain, which is commonly used to identify fungal elements in tissue.
