    "An analysis of the provided image in scientific literature reveals that it visualizes the Wigner 3-j symbol for the parameters `j1=8`, `j2=8`, and `j3=8`. The nine panels in the image correspond to the projection quantum number `m3` varying from -4 to 4, ordered from left-to-right and top-to-bottom.\n\nThe infinity-norm of each symbol, which corresponds to the maximum absolute value for each `m3` case, must be calculated. The value of the Wigner 3-j symbol `(j1 j2 j3; m1 m2 m3)` depends on the `m` quantum numbers, which are constrained by the rule `m1 + m2 + m3 = 0`. For each of the nine plots, the infinity-norm is the maximum absolute value of the symbol over all allowed values of `m1` and `m2`.\n\nThe infinity-norms for each case are as follows:\n*   For `m3 = ±1` (plots 4 and 6), the maximum absolute value is `sqrt(2/17)` ≈ 0.3430.\n*   For `m3 = 0` (plot 5) and `m3 = ±2` (plots 3 and 7), the maximum absolute value is `1/sqrt(17)` ≈ 0.2425.\n*   For `m3 = ±3` (plots 2 and 8), the maximum absolute value is `sqrt(13/255)` ≈ 0.2256.\n*   For `m3 = ±4` (plots 1 and 9), the maximum absolute value is `sqrt(2/91)` ≈ 0.1482.\n\nBased on these calculations:\n*   The maximum infinity-norm among the nine symbols is `sqrt(2/17)`.\n*   The minimum infinity-norm among the nine symbols is `sqrt(2/91)`.\n\nThe ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm is:\n\nRatio = `(sqrt(2/17)) / (sqrt(2/91))` = `sqrt((2/17) * (91/2))` = `sqrt(91/17)`\n\nThis evaluates to approximately 2.3136.\n\n<<<sqrt(91/17)>>>"
