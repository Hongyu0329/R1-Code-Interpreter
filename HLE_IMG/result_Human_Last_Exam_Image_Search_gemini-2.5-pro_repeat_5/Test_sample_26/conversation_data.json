    "An analysis of the score for the first movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor, Op. 13, known as the \"Path√©tique,\" reveals the harmony in measure 30.\n\nThe key of the movement is C minor. In measure 30, the notes played are G, B-natural, D, and F. These notes constitute a G dominant seventh chord (G7).\n\nIn the context of the key of C minor, the G major chord (G-B-D) is the dominant triad, represented by the Roman numeral V. The \"7\" is added to the Roman numeral to indicate the inclusion of the minor seventh above the root (the note F). Therefore, the correct Roman numeral for the G7 chord in measure 30 is V7.\n\n<<<V7>>>"
