    "Here are the authors of the nine works, from left to right and top to bottom:\n\n1.  **He Jiaying (何家英)**: This is a classic example of He Jiaying's work, which often features elegant, contemporary women rendered in the meticulous \"gongbi\" (工笔) style. His paintings blend traditional techniques with modern aesthetics.\n\n2.  **Balthus (巴尔蒂斯)**: The artwork in the background is a detail from the monumental oil painting *The Mountain* (1937) by the Polish-French artist Balthus. The image in the grid is a separate, expressive ink wash painting of a landscape, likely by a modern Chinese artist, but its specific creator is not identifiable from the image alone. Given the context of the other pieces, it's likely from a prominent modern Chinese master.\n\n3.  **Fan Zeng (范曾)**: The cursive calligraphy is characteristic of Fan Zeng, a renowned contemporary master of classical Chinese studies, poetry, calligraphy, and painting. He is particularly famous for his figure paintings and dynamic calligraphy.\n\n4.  **Fan Zeng (范曾)**: This is another piece of calligraphy by Fan Zeng. His calligraphy is noted for its vigorous and fluid style, often incorporating lines that are reminiscent of his figure painting.\n\n5.  **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**: This iconic oil painting is *Youth* (青年女歌手), created in 1984 by Jin Shangyi. It is a masterpiece of the \"New Classicism\" movement in China, blending European classical techniques with a modern Chinese subject. The painting in the background of *Youth* is *The Mountain* by Balthus.\n\n6.  **Lin Fengmian (林风眠)**: This painting of a lady is in the distinctive style of Lin Fengmian, a pioneer of modern Chinese painting who blended Chinese and Western techniques. His figures are known for their elegant, elongated forms and lyrical quality.\n\n7.  **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**: The painting of gourds and laundry is representative of Wu Guanzhong's style. He is celebrated for his vibrant works that merge Western modernism with traditional Chinese ink painting, often depicting scenes from rural Chinese life.\n\n8.  **Li Keran (李可染)**: This landscape with red-sailed boats in a gorge is a classic work by Li Keran, a master of modern Chinese landscape painting. He is famous for his powerful, layered ink landscapes, often highlighted with touches of color.\n\n9.  **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**: The painting of a lobster is in the style of Qi Baishi, one of the most celebrated modern Chinese artists. While he is most famous for his paintings of shrimp, his depictions of other creatures like lobsters and crabs are also highly valued for their lively brushwork and charm.\n\n<<<1.
