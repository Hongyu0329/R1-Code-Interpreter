    "To determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Data:** The tables show the mode share as a percentage of \"trip mileage\" for different trip distance categories. The \"share of total trips\" row at the top indicates the proportion of total mileage that falls into each distance category. The \"Total\" column represents the overall mode share across all distances.\n\n2.  **Verify the Table Structure:** We can confirm our understanding by checking if the \"Total\" column is a weighted average of the shares in the distance categories, using the \"share of total trips\" row as weights. Let's test this for the \"car, 1 occupant\" row in the Baseline table.\n\n    *   Weights for each distance category: 0-3 miles (48%), 3-5 miles (22%), 5-10 miles (14%), 10+ miles (16%).\n    *   Weighted average = (0.25 × 0.48) + (0.38 × 0.22) + (0.40 × 0.14) + (0.42 × 0.16)\n    *   = 0.12 + 0.0836 + 0.056 + 0.0672 = 0.3268 or 32.7%\n\n    This calculated value (32.7%) is approximately equal to the 33% shown in the \"Total\" column. This confirms that the \"Total\" column represents the overall percentage of total VMT for each mode.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Car VMT Share for Baseline:** From Table 1 (Baseline), we sum the total VMT shares for the two car categories:\n    *   Car, 1 occupant: 33%\n    *   Car, with more than 2 occupants: 37%\n    *   **Total Baseline Car VMT Share = 33% + 37% = 70%**\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Car VMT Share for Proposed:** From Table 2 (Proposed), we sum the total VMT shares for the two car categories:\n    *   Car, 1 occupant: 7%\n    *   Car, with more than 2 occupants: 14%\n    *   **Total Proposed Car VMT Share = 7% + 14% = 21%**\n\n5.  **Calculate the Percentage Reduction:** The reduction in Car VMT is the difference between the baseline and proposed shares, calculated as a percentage of the baseline share.\n\n    *   Reduction = Baseline Share - Proposed Share = 70% - 21% = 49%\n    *   Percentage Reduction = (Reduction / Baseline Share) × 100\n    *   Percentage Reduction = (49% / 70%) × 100 = 0.7 × 100 = 70%\n\nBy changing the composition of mode share, the percentage of Car VMT can be reduced by 70%.\n\n<<<70%>>>"
