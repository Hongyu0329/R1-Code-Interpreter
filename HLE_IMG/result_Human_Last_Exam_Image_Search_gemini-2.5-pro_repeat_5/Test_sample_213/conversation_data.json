    "The piece of sheet music is the opening of the second scene from Richard Strauss's one-act opera, *Salome*.\n\n*Salome*, Op. 54, is a one-act opera by Richard Strauss, with a libretto based on Hedwig Lachmann's German translation of Oscar Wilde's 1891 play *Salom√©*. The opera is renowned for its \"Dance of the Seven Veils.\"\n\nAlthough *Salome* is a single-act opera, the provided score marks the beginning of the second scene. In this scene, Salome, having grown weary of her stepfather Herod's feast, has entered the terrace. She becomes intrigued by the voice of the prophet Jochanaan (John the Baptist) and persuades the guard, Narraboth, to bring him out of his cistern prison. This encounter sets in motion the dramatic and tragic events of the opera. The musical style, with its complex harmonies and orchestration, is characteristic of Strauss's work.\n\n<<<Salome>>>"
