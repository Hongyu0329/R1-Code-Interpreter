    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Parent Compound and Chiral Centers**\n\nFirst, we must determine the principal functional group to correctly name and number the molecule. According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the alcohol (-OH) group has higher priority than the amine (-NH2) group. Therefore, the molecule is named as an alcohol.\n\nNext, we identify the longest carbon chain that contains the hydroxyl group. The longest such chain has five carbon atoms. Numbering starts from the end closest to the -OH group to give it the lowest possible locant.\n\nThe structure is numbered as follows:\n`CH3(1)-C(2)H(OH)-C(3)H(Et)-C(4)H(Me)-C(5)H2NH2`\n\nThe IUPAC name for this molecule is **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**. The chiral centers are located at carbons C2, C3, and C4.\n\n### **Step 2: Assign Priorities to Substituents**\n\nWe will now assign priorities (from 1, highest, to 4, lowest) to the groups attached to each chiral center based on the atomic number of the atoms directly bonded to it.\n\n**For Chiral Center C2:**\n*   **Attached groups:** -OH, -H, -CH3 (C1), and the rest of the chain starting with C3.\n*   **Priorities:**\n    1.  -OH (Oxygen, Z=8)\n    2.  -C3H(Et)-... (Carbon, attached to two other carbons)\n    3.  -CH3 (Carbon, attached to three hydrogens)\n    4.  -H (Hydrogen, Z=1)\n\n**For Chiral Center C3:**\n*   **Attached groups:** -C2H(OH)CH3, -C4H(Me)CH2NH2, -CH2CH3 (ethyl), and -H.\n*   **Priorities:**\n    1.  -C2H(OH)CH3 (Carbon attached to O, C, H)\n    2.  -C4H(Me)CH2NH2 (Carbon attached to C, C, H)\n    3.  -CH2CH3 (Ethyl group; carbon attached to C, H, H)\n    4.  -H\n\n**For Chiral Center C4:**\n*   **Attached groups:** -C3H(Et)C2..., -CH2NH2 (the C5 group), -CH3, and -H.\n*   **Priorities:**\n    1.  -CH2NH2 (Carbon attached to Nitrogen, Z=7)\n    2.  -C3H(Et)C2... (Carbon attached to two other carbons)\n    3.  -CH3 (Carbon attached to three hydrogens)\n    4.  -H\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Absolute Configuration (R/S)**\n\nWe determine the configuration by orienting the molecule so the lowest-priority group (4) points away from the viewer and observing the sequence of the remaining groups from 1 to 3.\n\n*   A **clockwise** sequence indicates an **(R)** configuration.\n*   A **counter-clockwise** sequence indicates an **(S)** configuration.\n*   If the lowest-priority group points towards the viewer, the result is reversed.\n\n**Configuration at C2:**\n*   In the drawing, the OH group (1) is wedged (out), and the H (4) is assumed to be dashed (in/away).\n*   The sequence 1 (-OH) → 2 (-C3) → 3 (-CH3) is **clockwise**.\n*   Therefore, the configuration at C2 is **(R)**.\n\n**Configuration at C3:**\n*   The ethyl group (3) is wedged (out), and the H (4) is assumed to be dashed (in/away).\n*   The sequence 1 (-C2) → 2 (-C4) → 3 (-Ethyl) is **clockwise**.\n*   Therefore, the configuration at C3 is **(R)**.\n\n**Configuration at C4:**\n*   The methyl group (3) is dashed (in/away), which means the hydrogen (4) is wedged (out/toward the viewer).\n*   Since the lowest priority group is pointing out, we determine the direction of the sequence and reverse the result.\n*   The sequence 1 (-CH2NH2) → 2 (-C3) → 3 (-CH3) is **counter-clockwise**.\n*   Reversing the counter-clockwise result gives a **clockwise** direction.\n*   Therefore, the configuration at C4 is **(R)**.\n\nThe absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3R, 4R).\n\n<<<(2R, 3R, 4R)>>>"
