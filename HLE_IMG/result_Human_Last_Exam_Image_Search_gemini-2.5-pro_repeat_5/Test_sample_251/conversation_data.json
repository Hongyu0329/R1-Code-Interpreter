    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip, we need to analyze the image and use the given paper speed.\n\n1.  **ECG Paper Speed**: The strip indicates a speed of **25 mm/sec**. This means every millimeter on the horizontal axis represents 1/25 = 0.04 seconds.\n2.  **ECG Grid**: The ECG paper is a grid of small (1 mm) and large (5 mm) squares.\n    *   Each small square (1 mm) represents **0.04 seconds**.\n    *   Each large square (5 mm) represents 5 * 0.04 = **0.2 seconds**.\n3.  **Identifying the Longest R-R Interval**: By visually inspecting the entire rhythm strip, we can find the longest pause between two consecutive R waves (the tall spikes). This pause is most prominent on the fourth line of the tracing, which starts near the timestamp `0:06:08`.\n4.  **Measuring the Interval**: Let's measure the distance between the two R waves that encompass this long pause.\n    *   The R-wave before the pause and the R-wave after the pause are separated by a noticeable gap.\n    *   By counting the number of large squares between the peaks of these two R-waves, we find there are exactly **8 large squares**.\n5.  **Calculating the Time in Seconds**:\n    *   Longest R-R interval = (Number of large squares) × (Time per large square)\n    *   Longest R-R interval = 8 large squares × 0.2 seconds/large square\n    *   Longest R-R interval = **1.6 seconds**\n\n<<<1.6>>>"
