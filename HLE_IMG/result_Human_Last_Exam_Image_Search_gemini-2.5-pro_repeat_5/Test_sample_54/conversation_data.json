    "Based on the analysis of the reaction scheme, the reagents A and B are identified as follows:\n\n**Reagent A: Hydrazine (N₂H₄)**\n\nThe transformation from compound **1** to compound **2** involves the replacement of a ring oxygen atom in a pyrylium-like structure with an N-amino group (-N⁺H₂). This is a characteristic reaction of pyrylium salts (and related oxonium ions) with hydrazine. The hydrazine acts as a dinucleophile, leading to a ring-opening and ring-closing cascade to form the corresponding N-aminopyridinium salt.\n\n**Reagent B: Propanal (CH₃CH₂CHO)**\n\nThe conversion of compound **2** to **3** shows the incorporation of a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) and the formation of a new fused ring to create the pentacyclic quinacridinium core. This indicates a reaction with a three-carbon aldehyde. The N-amino group of compound **2** would react with propanal to form a hydrazone intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes a complex intramolecular cyclization and aromatization sequence, likely under heat, to yield the final N-propyl-substituted quinacridinium product **3**. Several literature precedents describe the synthesis of N-alkyl quinacridinium salts via reactions involving amines and other precursors, which supports this type of transformation.\n\nTherefore, reagent A is hydrazine and reagent B is propanal.\n\n<<<A: Hydrazine, B: Propanal>>>"
