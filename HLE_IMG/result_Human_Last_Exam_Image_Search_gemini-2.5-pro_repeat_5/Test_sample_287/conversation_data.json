    "The image was taken in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nThe prominent buildings visible in the skyline are part of the World Trade Center Seoul complex located in Samseong-dong, Gangnam District. Key identifiable structures include the Trade Tower and the ASEM Tower.\n\nThe Trade Tower, a 55-floor skyscraper built in 1988, is one of South Korea's tallest buildings and is known for its distinctive design that resembles two quadro-level towers in a mirror image of each other. The ASEM Tower is another major office building in the complex, constructed for the 3rd Asia-Europe Meeting in 2000.\n\nThis area, which also includes the COEX Convention & Exhibition Center and the COEX Mall, is a major business and tourist hub in Seoul. Images and descriptions of the Samseong-dong skyline confirm the presence and appearance of these buildings.\n\n<<<Seoul>>>"
