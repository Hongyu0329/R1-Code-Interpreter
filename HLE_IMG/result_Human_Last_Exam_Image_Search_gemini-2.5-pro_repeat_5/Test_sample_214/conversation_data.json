    "The erasure poem in the image is part of a series by the poet Mary Ruefle titled \"The Other Clouds.\" The source text for this series is the 19th-century book *The Cloud* by Percy Bysshe Shelley.\n\nTo determine the poetic form, it is necessary to analyze the structure of the stanzas created through erasure. The complete four-line stanza that includes the line from the image is as follows:\n\n> a proud people\n> the snow\n> ghostly velum, a vortex\n> nacreous wavers\n\nTo identify the form, we can count the syllables in each line:\n*   **Line 1:** a proud peo-ple (3 syllables)\n*   **Line 2:** the snow (1 syllable)\n*   **Line 3:** ghost-ly vel-um, a vor-tex (5 syllables)\n*   **Line 4:** na-cre-ous wa-vers (4 syllables)\n\nThe syllable structure of 3-1-5-4 does not correspond to a traditional, established poetic form like a haiku (5-7-5) or a cinquain (2-4-6-8-2). Erasure poetry is a contemporary form where the poet creates a new work by erasing words from an existing text. While the poet may choose to follow a specific structure, the primary constraint is the vocabulary and word order of the source text. In this case, Mary Ruefle has not adhered to a recognizable, pre-existing syllabic or metrical pattern. Instead, the form is best described as free verse, as the line lengths and rhythms are irregular and do not follow a fixed pattern.\n\nTherefore, the sequence of erasure poems adheres to the form of **free verse**.\n\n<<<Free verse>>>"
