    "Based on the detailed analysis of the provided electron ionization mass spectrum, the compound can be identified by following these steps:\n\n1.  **Molecular Ion Peak Identification**: The group of peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) appears at m/z 262, 264, and 266. This pattern is characteristic of a compound containing chlorine atoms. The peak at m/z 262 is the most likely candidate for the molecular ion (M+) containing the most common isotopes.\n\n2.  **Isotope Pattern Analysis**:\n    *   The peaks are observed at m/z 262 (relative intensity 29.0%), 264 (12.9%), and 266 (3.22%).\n    *   Another prominent cluster of peaks is at m/z 227 (66.7%) and m/z 229 (22.2%). The intensity ratio of these two peaks is approximately 3:1 (66.7 / 22.2 ≈ 3.0). This is the characteristic isotopic signature for a fragment containing one chlorine atom.\n    *   The mass difference between the proposed molecular ion (m/z 262) and this fragment (m/z 227) is 35 amu (262 - 227 = 35), which corresponds to the mass of a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl).\n    *   This indicates that the parent molecule (M=262) contains at least two chlorine atoms, and loses one to form the fragment at m/z 227.\n\n3.  **Determination of the Molecular Formula**:\n    *   Assuming the molecule contains two chlorine atoms, the molecular formula can be represented as CₓHᵧCl₂.\n    *   The nominal mass of the molecule is taken as 262 u (using the most abundant isotope, ³⁵Cl).\n    *   The mass of the non-halogen part of the molecule is 262 - (2 × 35) = 192 u.\n    *   We need to find a plausible hydrocarbon formula (CₓHᵧ) that sums to 192. A likely candidate is C₁₅H₁₂ (15 × 12 + 12 × 1 = 180 + 12 = 192).\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the compound is likely **C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂**.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Fragmentation Pattern**:\n    *   **Molecular Ion [M]⁺•**: m/z 262, corresponding to [C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂]⁺•.\n    *   **Base Peak**: The most intense peak is at m/z 225. This peak is formed from the fragment at m/z 227 by the loss of a hydrogen molecule (H₂), a common process that leads to a more stable, conjugated cation.\n    *   **Key Fragments**:\n        *   m/z 227: [M - Cl]⁺, or [C₁₅H₁₂Cl]⁺.\n        *   m/z 190: This significant peak corresponds to the loss of both chlorine atoms and two hydrogen atoms from the molecular ion, [M - 2Cl - 2H]⁺• or [C₁₅H₁₀]⁺•.\n\n5.  **Structure Elucidation and IUPAC Name**:\n    *   The formula C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂ and the fragmentation pattern are consistent with an isomer of dichlorodiphenylpropene.\n    *   A plausible structure is **1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)prop-1-ene**. This structure has the formula C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂ and its fragmentation can explain the observed spectrum.\n    *   The systematic IUPAC name for this compound is **1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)prop-1-ene**.\n\n<<<1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)prop-1-ene>>>"
