    "Based on the provided image, the two-move checkmate for White is as follows:\n\n1.  **Qc2+**: This move puts the black king in check. Black's king has only one legal move. The squares e3 and f3 are controlled by the white rook on f3, the f5 square is controlled by the rook on h5, and the d4 square is controlled by the white queen (even after its move to c2). Therefore, the black king must move to d3.\n\n2.  **Kd3**: This is Black's only possible response to the check.\n\n3.  **Qc4#**: White's queen moves to c4, delivering a checkmate. The black king on d3 has no safe squares to move to. It is attacked by the queen on c4, and all potential escape squares (c2, d2, e2, c3, e3, c4, d4, e4) are either attacked by the queen, the rook on f3, the bishop on g2, or the pawn on b4. The check cannot be blocked, and the queen on c4 cannot be captured.\n\n<<<1. Qc2+ Kd3 2. Qc4#>>>"
