    # Analysis for Reagent A
    # The transformation from compound 1 to 2 involves the conversion of a pyrylium salt
    # into an N-aminopyridinium salt. This is achieved by reacting the pyrylium cation
    # with a reagent that can supply a -NHNH2 group. Hydrazine is the common reagent for this.
    reagent_A = "Hydrazine (N2H4)"

    # Analysis for Reagent B
    # The transformation from compound 2 to 3 is a complex rearrangement that also
    # involves the incorporation of a propyl group onto a nitrogen atom to form the
    # N-propyl quinacridinium product. This indicates that a primary amine containing a
    # propyl group is used. The reaction is a variation of the Zincke-Suarez reaction.
