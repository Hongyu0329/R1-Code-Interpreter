    #    The best exchange point is 'Schmiede Wiedikon', where Bus 72 intersects Trams 9 and 14.
    #    Other exchange points result in a much higher station count.
    # 4. Minimum stations: The path via Schmiede Wiedikon has 7 stations.
    #    Path: Billoweg -> Brunaustr. -> GiesshÃ¼bel (Sihlcity Nord) -> Waffenplatzstr. ->
    #    Schmiede Wiedikon -> Goldbrunnenplatz -> Laubiweg.
    # 5. Tie-breaking: At Schmiede Wiedikon, we can switch to either Tram 9 or Tram 14.
    #    Both paths are identical in terms of exchanges, station count, and exchange location.
    #    To find the unique path promised, a tie-breaker is assumed: choose the lower line number.
    #    Since 9 < 14, we choose Tram line 9.
