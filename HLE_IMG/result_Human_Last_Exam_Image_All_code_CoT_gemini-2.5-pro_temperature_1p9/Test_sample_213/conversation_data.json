    "This task requires identifying an opera based on a snippet of its orchestral score. I will analyze the provided musical image to deduce the answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Examine the Instrumentation and Language:** I will look at the names of the instruments and any written directions on the score to determine the language and, by extension, the likely nationality of the composer.\n2.  **Analyze the Musical Style:** I will observe the harmony, melody, and overall texture of the music to place it within a specific historical period (e.g., Classical, Romantic, Modern).\n3.  **Identify Key Markings:** I'll search for unique indicators like rehearsal numbers or stage directions that can help pinpoint the exact piece and its location within the opera.\n4.  **Synthesize the Information:** By combining the language, style, and specific markings, I will narrow down the possibilities and identify the opera. For example, the word \"(Vorhang)\" in German means \"(Curtain),\" and its presence at rehearsal mark \"1\" strongly suggests this is the music that plays as the curtain rises on an act. Given the user states this is Act II, this is a very strong clue.\n\nFollowing this plan, I can identify the opera and will present the reasoning within a Python script as requested.\n\n```python\ndef identify_opera_from_score():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the reasoning process to identify the opera\n    from the provided sheet music and prints the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze textual clues from the score.\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze textual clues from the score.\")\n    print(\"The instrument names (e.g., 'gr. Fl.' for Grosse Flöte, 'engl. Horn' for English Horn) and musical directions (e.g., 'mit Dämpfer' for with mute, 'Vorhang' for curtain) are in German. This points towards a German or Austrian composer.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the musical style.\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the musical style.\")\n    print(\"The music is written for a large orchestra and features lush, highly chromatic harmonies.
