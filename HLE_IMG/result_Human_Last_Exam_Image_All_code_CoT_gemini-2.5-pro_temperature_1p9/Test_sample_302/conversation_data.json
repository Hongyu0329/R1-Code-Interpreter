    "I will first identify the characters on the seal and then use Python to output them in simplified Chinese.\n\nThe characters on the seal are in an ancient seal script style. Following the traditional reading order (top to bottom, right to left), we can identify them:\n\n1.  **Top Right:** The character is 長 (cháng), meaning \"long\" or \"eternal\".\n2.  **Bottom Right:** The character is 樂 (lè), meaning \"joy\" or \"happiness\".\n3.  **Top Left:** The character is 未 (wèi), meaning \"not yet\".\n4.  **Bottom Left:** The character is 央 (yāng), meaning \"center\" or \"end\".\n\nTogether, they form the idiomatic phrase \"長樂未央\" (cháng lè wèi yāng), which means \"endless joy\" or \"eternal happiness without end\".\n\nNow, I will convert these traditional characters to their simplified Chinese equivalents:\n*   長 -> 长\n*   樂 -> 乐\n*   未 -> 未 (no change)\n*   央 -> 央 (no change)\n\nThe resulting simplified Chinese phrase is \"长乐未央\". Here is the Python code to print this phrase.\n\n```python\ndef get_seal_characters():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function prints the simplified Chinese characters found on the seal.\n  The phrase is '长乐未央' (cháng lè wèi yāng), meaning \"endless joy\".\n  \"\"\"\n  characters = \"长乐未央\"\n  print(characters)\n\nget_seal_characters()\n```\n<<<长乐未央>>>"
