    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to identify the compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure:** The provided image shows a complex polycyclic molecule. I will examine its key features.\n2.  **Identify functional groups and ring systems:** The molecule is an alkaloid, as it is a naturally occurring compound containing nitrogen atoms in a heterocyclic ring system. Specifically, it has:\n    *   A tetracyclic (four-ring) framework.\n    *   Two nitrogen atoms integrated into the rings.\n    *   A carbonyl group (C=O) which is part of a six-membered ring containing a nitrogen atom. This is a lactam functional group.\n3.  **Identify the specific compound:** Based on this unique tetracyclic lactam structure, which is characteristic of certain quinolizidine alkaloids, I can identify the compound by matching it against known chemical structures. This structure corresponds to a well-known alkaloid isolated from plants of the *Sophora* genus.\n4.  **Generate code:** I will write a simple Python script that stores the name of this compound in a variable and prints it to the console.\n\n```python\ndef identify_alkaloid():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the alkaloid from its chemical structure and prints its common name.\n\n    The structure shown is a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid characterized\n    by a specific arrangement of four fused rings, two nitrogen atoms, and one\n    lactam group. This specific molecule is known as Matrine.\n    \"\"\"\n    compound_name = \"Matrine\"\n    print(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    identify_alkaloid()\n```\n<<<Matrine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
