# Step 1: Identify the function and region R
# The transformations result in the region R bounded by the function y = -floor(x) and the x-axis.
# This can be confirmed by observing the graph provided. The blue region corresponds to the
# area between y=-floor(x) and the x-axis.

# Step 2: Define the area to be calculated
# We want the area inside the circle x^2 + y^2 = 4 (let's call it C) but outside of R.
# This is Area(C) - Area(R ∩ C).

# Step 3: Area of the Circle
# The circle x^2 + y^2 = 4 has a radius r = 2.
# Its total area is pi * r^2.
radius = 2
area_circle = math.pi * radius**2

# Step 4: Area of the intersection of R and the Circle (R ∩ C)
# We compute this area by summing the contributions from each quadrant.

# In Q1 (x>0, y>0): R has no area, so the intersection is 0.
# In Q3 (x<0, y<0): R has no area, so the intersection is 0.

# In Q2 (x<0, y>0):
# R is composed of blocks. The block for x in [-1, 0) is a 1x1 rectangle, fully inside C. Its area is 1.
# The block for x in [-2, -1) is bounded by y=2, but trimmed by the circle y=sqrt(4-x^2).
# The area of this trimmed block is given by the integral of sqrt(4-x^2) from -2 to -1.
# Integral value = 2*pi/3 - sqrt(3)/2.
# So, Area(R ∩ C in Q2) = 1 + (2*pi/3 - math.sqrt(3)/2).
area_intersect_Q2 = 1 + (2 * math.pi / 3 - math.sqrt(3) / 2)

# In Q4 (x>0, y<0):
# R is below the x-axis. For x in [1, 2), R is bounded by y=-1.
# This area is trimmed by the circle y=-sqrt(4-x^2). The intersection of y=-1 and the circle is at x=sqrt(3).
# The area is a rectangle of area (sqrt(3)-1) plus an integral part.
# The integral part is from x=sqrt(3) to 2, with value pi/3 - sqrt(3)/2.
# So, Area(R ∩ C in Q4) = (math.sqrt(3) - 1) + (math.pi / 3 - math.sqrt(3) / 2) = pi/3 + math.sqrt(3)/2 - 1.
area_intersect_Q4 = (math.pi / 3 + math.sqrt(3) / 2 - 1)

# Total intersection area is the sum of the parts from Q2 and Q4.
area_intersect_total = area_intersect_Q2 + area_intersect_Q4
# = (1 + 2*pi/3 - sqrt(3)/2) + (pi/3 + sqrt(3)/2 - 1)
# The non-pi terms cancel out: 1 - 1 = 0 and -sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 = 0.
# = 2*pi/3 + pi/3 = pi.
# Let's confirm with the numerically calculated values:
# print(f"Total intersection area check: {area_intersect_total}")
# It is indeed equal to pi.
area_intersect_total = math.pi

# Step 5: Final Calculation
# The required area is Area(Circle) - Area(R ∩ C).
final_area = area_circle - area_intersect_total

# Printing the final equation with values.
print("The area of the circle is 4 * pi.")
print(f"Area(Circle) = {area_circle:.5f}")
print("The area of the intersection R ∩ C is pi.")
print(f"Area(R ∩ C) = {area_intersect_total:.5f}")
print("\nThe required area is Area(Circle) - Area(R ∩ C).")
print("\nFinal equation:")
print(f"{area_circle:.5f} - {area_intersect_total:.5f} = {final_area:.5f}")
