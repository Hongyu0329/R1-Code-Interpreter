# Step 1: Analyze the polygon's properties.
# The polygon shown is a modified hexagon. Let's analyze its opposite sides.
# - The top side has an inward notch, while the opposite bottom side has an outward protrusion of the same shape.
# - The top-right side has an outward protrusion, while the opposite bottom-left side has an inward notch.
# - The top-left side has an inward notch, while the opposite bottom-right side has an outward protrusion.

# Step 2: Identify the key symmetry.
# Because each side's feature is mirrored by a complementary feature on the opposite side,
# the polygon has central symmetry. This means if you rotate it 180 degrees about its center,
# the polygon looks exactly the same.

# Step 3: Relate the polygon's properties to its ability to tile the plane.
# There is a theorem in geometry stating that any centrally symmetric polygon tiles the plane.
# This means infinite copies of the shape can fit together to cover a flat surface
# without any gaps or overlaps.

# Step 4: Define the Heesch number and determine its value.
# The Heesch number of a shape is the maximum number of layers of congruent copies that can
# surround it. For a shape that tiles the plane, it can be surrounded by an infinite
# number of layers. Therefore, its Heesch number is infinity.

# Step 5: Determine the answer for all three polygons.
# The problem shows three identical polygons. Since they are the same shape, they all
# have the same properties and thus the same Heesch number.
# Heesch Number for polygon 1 = ∞
# Heesch Number for polygon 2 = ∞
# Heesch Number for polygon 3 = ∞

# Step 6: Print the final answer as requested.
answer_1 = "∞"
answer_2 = "∞"
answer_3 = "∞"

print(f"{answer_1}, {answer_2}, {answer_3}")
