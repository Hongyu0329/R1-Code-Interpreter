# The final equation is y = -0.5 * f''(3x - 2) + 1.
# Let's break down the analysis step by step.

# Step 1: Identify the vertical asymptote of the original function f(x).
# By observing the blue curve for y = f(x), we can see a vertical asymptote.
# The function goes to +infinity on the right of x=4 and -infinity on the left of x=4.
# The vertical asymptote of f(x) is at x = 4.
x_asymptote_original = 4
print(f"Step 1: The vertical asymptote of the original function f(x) (blue curve) is at x = {x_asymptote_original}.")

# The vertical asymptote of the second derivative, f''(x), is at the same location.
print(f"This means the vertical asymptote of f''(x) is also at x = {x_asymptote_original}.")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 2: Determine how transformations in the equation y = -0.5 * f''(3x - 2) + 1 affect the asymptote.
# The location of the vertical asymptote is determined by the horizontal transformations within the argument of the function.
# The argument is (3x - 2).
# The other numbers in the equation, -0.5 and 1, affect the graph vertically (scaling and shifting) but do not change the x-location of the vertical asymptote.
arg_a = 3
arg_b = -2
print(f"Step 2: The target function y = -0.5 * f''({arg_a}x {arg_b}) + 1 involves a horizontal transformation given by the argument {arg_a}x {arg_b}.")
print("-" * 30)


# Step 3: Calculate the new position of the vertical asymptote.
# The new asymptote occurs when the argument equals the original asymptote's x-value.
# We need to solve the equation: 3x - 2 = 4
print("Step 3: To find the new vertical asymptote, we set the argument equal to the original asymptote's location:")
print(f"Equation: {arg_a}x + ({arg_b}) = {x_asymptote_original}")

# Solving for x:
# 3x = 4 + 2
# 3x = 6
# x = 6 / 3
# x = 2
rhs = x_asymptote_original - arg_b
x_asymptote_new = rhs / arg_a
print(f"Solving for x:")
print(f"{arg_a}x = {x_asymptote_original} - ({arg_b})")
print(f"{arg_a}x = {rhs}")
print(f"x = {rhs} / {arg_a}")
print(f"x = {int(x_asymptote_new)}")
print("-" * 30)


# Step 4: Identify the function with the new asymptote.
print(f"Step 4: The calculated vertical asymptote for the transformed function is at x = {int(x_asymptote_new)}.")

print("- The Black curve has a vertical asymptote at x = 6.")
