    This function returns the IUPAC name of the product from the given reaction.
    The reaction proceeds via a tandem elimination-tautomerization mechanism.
    1. Thermal elimination of methanol from the beta-methoxy allylic alcohol starting material
       forms an allenic alcohol intermediate.
    2. The unstable allenic alcohol tautomerizes to the final product, a beta,gamma-unsaturated ketone.

    # Structure of the final product:
    # A five-carbon chain with a ketone at C1 and a double bond at C4.
    # A cyclohex-2-en-1-yl group is attached at C1.
    # (C6H9)-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2  -- Oops, pent-4-en-1-one has a 5-carbon chain.
    # Reactant chain: -C(OH)-C(OMe)-CH=CH-CH3 (5 carbons)
    # Allenol: -C(OH)-CH=C=CH-CH3
    # Ketone Tautomer: -C(=O)-CH2-CH=CH-CH3
    
    # Let's name the ketone: 1-(cyclohex-2-en-1-yl)pent-4-en-1-one
    # 1: C=O
    # 2: CH2
    # 3: CH
    # 4: CH
    # 5: CH3
    # Wait, my tautomerization was to beta,gamma-unsaturated ketone from R'-CH(OH)-C=C=R''.
    # Let's check: R'-CH(OH)-CH=C=CHR'' -> R'-C(=O)-CH2-CH=CHR''. Correct.
    # Here, R' is C6H9, and R'' is CH3.
    # So the product is (C6H9)-C(=O)-CH2-CH=CH-CH3.
    # Let's name this carefully.
    # Main chain: pent-4-en-1-one. Correct.
    # Substituent: 1-(cyclohex-2-en-1-yl). Correct.
