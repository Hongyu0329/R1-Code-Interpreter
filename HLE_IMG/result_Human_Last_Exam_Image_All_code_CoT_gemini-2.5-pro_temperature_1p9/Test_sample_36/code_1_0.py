    Based on the scenario, the best approach is to combine the DIKW and SECI models. Here's why:

    1.  The DIKW Model (Data -> Information -> Knowledge -> Wisdom) is essential for VVA's goal. It will allow them to:
        -   Take raw sales data (e.g., from the 'VA Sales List', call outcomes).
        -   Turn it into information (e.g., 'which lead sources have the best conversion rate?').
        -   Generate knowledge (e.g., 'understanding the profile of the most profitable clients').
        -   Apply wisdom (e.g., 'strategically focusing marketing efforts on those profiles').
        This directly helps in boosting sales results by optimizing the process based on hard evidence.

    2.  The SECI Model (Socialization -> Externalization -> Combination -> Internalization) is crucial for capturing and scaling the human expertise in sales, which is often tacit (unspoken). It will allow them to:
        -   Externalize the tacit knowledge of their best salespeople by documenting their successful techniques into better 'VA Sales Scripts' or 'Work Manuals'.
        -   Socialize this knowledge by encouraging experienced staff to mentor new hires.
        This helps in maintaining a high level of sales performance across the entire team, not just relying on a few star performers.

    3.  Bloom's Taxonomy is less suitable as it is a framework for individual learning and educational objectives, not an organizational framework for managing knowledge to improve a business process.

    Conclusion: Combining DIKW for a data-driven strategy and SECI for a people-driven strategy provides a comprehensive solution to boost and maintain sales.
