# Step-by-step reasoning leads to the following mapping from plot number to chiral index m:
# The five SWNTs are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), and (4,4).

# Plot 1: Classic armchair (n,n) band structure (metallic, symmetric linear crossing) -> m=4
# Plot 2: Oscillator strength for a chiral metallic tube (angled cutting lines on K-points) -> m=1
# Plot 3: Band structure for a chiral semiconducting tube with a small gap and high band density -> m=3
# Plot 4: Oscillator strength for an armchair tube (vertical cutting lines) -> m=4
# Plot 5: Band structure for a chiral metallic tube (no gap, complex/dense bands) -> m=1
# Plot 6: Oscillator strength for a Type I chiral semiconductor (strong transition near K-points) -> m=3
# Plot 7: Band structure for a chiral semiconducting tube with a medium gap and density -> m=2
# Plot 8: Oscillator strength for a zigzag (n,0) tube (horizontal cutting lines) -> m=0
# Plot 9: Band structure for a zigzag tube (semiconducting, large gap, symmetric) -> m=0

# The sequence of m values for plots 1 through 9.
