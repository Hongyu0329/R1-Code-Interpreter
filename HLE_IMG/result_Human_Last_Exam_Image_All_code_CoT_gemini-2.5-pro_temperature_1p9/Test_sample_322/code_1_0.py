def solve_vortex_puzzle():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the vortex trajectory analysis task.
    
    The analysis is based on visual inspection of the 16 plots, following the logic that:
    - Two vortices of equal strength will have similar trajectories.
    - The third, unique vortex will have a different trajectory.
    - A stronger vortex (twice strength, uppercase) will have a more dominant, central, or smoother path.
    - A weaker vortex (half strength, lowercase) will have a more perturbed, smaller, or convoluted path.
