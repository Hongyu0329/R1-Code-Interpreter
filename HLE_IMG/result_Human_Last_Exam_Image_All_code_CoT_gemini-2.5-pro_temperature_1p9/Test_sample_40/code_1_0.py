    # Minimizing Q_opt means choosing the smaller valid root of this equation.

    # Coefficients are derived from the phasor equations:
    # Let k = P_C/Q_opt = pf_ratio_P_to_Q
    # K_real_Q = (k*R_S + X_S)
    # K_imag_Q = (k*X_S - R_S)

    # For simplicity of solving for the absolute minimum Q_opt, we can first assume ideal
    # compensation (k=0), which has a negligible effect on the Q_opt value. The loss P_C
    # is then calculated from the resulting Q_opt. A more rigorous approach is to include k.
