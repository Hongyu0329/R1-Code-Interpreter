    "My analysis of the image suggests that the insect is a boxelder bug. The distinctive markings—a black body with reddish-orange lines along the thorax and wing edges—are characteristic of this species. They are commonly found on various plants, including goldenrod as seen in the picture, especially in the late summer and fall. I will now provide the scientific name for this insect.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the scientific name of the insect identified in the image.\n# The insect is commonly known as the boxelder bug.\nscientific_name = \"Boisea trivittata\"\nprint(f\"The scientific name of the animal is: {scientific_name}\")\n```\n<<<Boisea trivittata>>>"
