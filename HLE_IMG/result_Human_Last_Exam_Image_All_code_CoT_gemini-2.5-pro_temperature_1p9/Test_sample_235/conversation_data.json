    "To determine the metric pattern of the erasure poem, we need to first identify all the words that constitute the poem and then count the total number of syllables. It's a common practice in found and erasure poetry to incorporate elements from the source page, such as titles and page numbers, into the final work.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Identify the complete text:** The poem is formed not only by the collaged words (\"rules\", \"and\", \"lines,\", \"an intricate spider's web\", \"work\") but also by the title of the page (\"THE FIRST STEP\") and the page number (\"35\"). We will read \"35\" as \"thirty-five\".\n2.  **Construct the sentence:** We'll combine these elements to form a single sentence, as is characteristic of the \"American Sentence\" form. The full text of the poem is: \"The first step thirty five rules and lines an intricate spider's web work\".\n3.  **Count the syllables:** We'll count the syllables for each word in this constructed sentence.\n4.  **Analyze the metric pattern:** Based on the total syllable count, we will compare it to the definitions of the patterns listed in the answer choices to find the correct match. An \"American Sentence,\" a form created by Allen Ginsberg, is a single sentence of exactly 17 syllables.\n\nI will now execute a Python script to perform the syllable count and show the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# A simple syllable counting dictionary for the words in the poem\n# This is a common method for this type of analysis, as programmatic\n# syllabification can be complex.\nsyllable_counts = {\n    'the': 1, 'first': 1, 'step': 1,\n    'thirty': 2, 'five': 1,\n    'rules': 1, 'and': 1, 'lines': 1,\n    'an': 1, 'intricate': 3, \"spider's\": 2, 'web': 1, 'work': 1\n}\n\n# The full text of the poem, including title and page number\n# We treat \"thirty-five\" as two words for counting purposes.\npoem_words = [\n    \"The\", \"first\", \"step\",\n    \"thirty\", \"five\",\n    \"rules\", \"and\", \"lines\",\n    \"an\", \"intricate\", \"spider's\", \"web\", \"work\"\n]\n\ndef analyze_poem_syllables():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the syllable count of the poem and prints the breakdown.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_syllables = 0\n    equation_parts = []\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the syllables of the poem:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n\n    # Process title words\n    title_words = poem_words[:3]\n    title_syllables = sum(syllable_counts[w.lower()] for w in title_words)\n    print(f\"Title ('The first step'): {' + '.join([str(syllable_counts[w.lower()]) for w in title_words])} = {title_syllables} syllables\")\n    total_syllables += title_syllables\n    equation_parts.extend([str(syllable_counts[w.lower()]) for w in title_words])\n\n\n    # Process page number words\n    page_num_words = poem_words[3:5]\n    page_num_syllables = sum(syllable_counts[w.lower()] for w in page_num_words)\n    print(f\"Page Number ('thirty five'): {' + '.join([str(syllable_counts[w.lower()]) for w in page_num_words])} = {page_num_syllables} syllables\")\n    total_syllables += page_num_syllables\n    equation_parts.extend([str(syllable_counts[w.lower()]) for w in page_num_words])\n\n    # Process collaged words\n    collaged_words = poem_words[5:]\n    collaged_syllables = sum(syllable_counts[w.lower()] for w in collaged_words)\n    print(f\"Collaged words: {' + '.join([str(syllable_counts[w.lower()]) for w in collaged_words])} = {collaged_syllables} syllables\")\n    total_syllables += collaged_syllables\n    equation_parts.extend([str(syllable_counts[w.lower()]) for w in collaged_words])\n\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n    print(\"Final Calculation:\")\n    # Print the full equation for total syllables\n    final_equation = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(f\"Total syllables = {final_equation} = {total_syllables}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n\n    if total_syllables == 17:\n        print(\"The poem has 17 syllables, which is the exact length of an American Sentence.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The poem has {total_syllables} syllables.\")\n\nanalyze_poem_syllables()\n\n```\n<<<F>>>"
