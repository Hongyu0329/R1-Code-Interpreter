    "This reaction is a multi-component reaction that proceeds in two main stages:\n\n1.  **Strecker Reaction:** This is a three-component reaction involving the aldehyde, the amine, and a cyanide source. 2-aminopyridine (amine), one of the aldehyde groups of o-phthalaldehyde, and cyanide (generated from TMSCN by the KF/Water catalyst) react to form an α-aminonitrile intermediate. This reaction involves the loss of one molecule of water. The intermediate formed is 2-((cyano(pyridin-2-yl)amino)methyl)benzaldehyde. The chemical formula for this intermediate is C14H11N3O.\n\n2.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The α-aminonitrile intermediate contains both a secondary amine (-NH-) and an aldehyde (-CHO) group positioned perfectly for a subsequent intramolecular reaction. The nucleophilic amine nitrogen attacks the electrophilic aldehyde carbon. This forms a new five-membered ring fused to the existing benzene ring, creating an isoindoline skeleton. This step is an addition, so no atoms are lost. The resulting product is a carbinolamine (a compound with a hydroxyl group attached to a carbon that is also bonded to a nitrogen).\n\nThe final structure of compound **A** is therefore **1-hydroxy-2-(pyridin-2-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindole-3-carbonitrile**.\n\nThe overall balanced chemical equation, accounting for the TMSCN reagent, is:\nC8H6O2 (o-phthalaldehyde) + C5H6N2 (2-aminopyridine) + C4H9NSi (TMSCN) → C14H11N3O (Product A) + C3H10OSi (TMSOH)\n\nThis confirms that the proposed structure for product A is consistent with the starting materials.\n\nThe following Python code uses the RDKit library to verify the molecular formula of the final product and print out the number of atoms of each element (Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen) as requested.\n\n```python\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\n    from rdkit.Chem import rdMolDescriptors\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"RDKit library not found.
