    "The coat of arms in the image shares its core symbolic elements with the historical coat of arms of a city in southern Ukraine. My analysis focused on identifying these key features and searching for a match.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** I will break down the coat of arms into its fundamental heraldic components: the colors (tinctures), the division of the shield, and the symbols (charges) it contains.\n    *   **Shield Division:** The shield is divided horizontally (`per fess`).\n    *   **Colors:** The top field is blue (`azure`), and the bottom field is gold (`or`). This blue and gold combination is notably associated with Ukraine.\n    *   **Charges:** A crescent moon is in the top field, and a crab is in the bottom field.\n2.  **Formulate a Search:** I will use these descriptive terms (\"coat of arms,\" \"blue and gold,\" \"crescent moon,\" \"crab\") to search for a city with a matching or very similar coat of arms.\n3.  **Identify the City:** The search will lead to the city of Ochakiv, Ukraine, whose historical coat of arms (from 1803) matches these elements precisely. The shield is divided blue over gold, with a crescent moon above a crab.\n4.  **Generate Code:** I will write a simple Python script to print the name of the identified city, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_city_with_similar_coat_of_arms():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the city\n    whose coat of arms is very similar to the one provided.\n\n    The image displays a coat of arms with the following features:\n    - A shield divided horizontally (per fess).\n    - The top part is blue (azure) with a golden crescent moon.\n    - The bottom part is gold (or) with a black crab.\n\n    This design is a very close representation of the historical coat of arms\n    of the city of Ochakiv in Ukraine, granted in 1803.\n    \"\"\"\n    city_name = \"Ochakiv\"\n    print(f\"The city with a very similar coat of arms is: {city_name}\")\n\nfind_city_with_similar_coat_of_arms()\n```\n<<<Ochakiv>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which city has a coat of arms that is very similar to the one in the attached image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
