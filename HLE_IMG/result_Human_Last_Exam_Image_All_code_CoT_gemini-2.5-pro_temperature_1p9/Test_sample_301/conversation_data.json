    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the authors of the artworks, from left to right, top to bottom.\n\n1.  **Top Left (Image 1):** This artwork features four whimsical fish with human-like faces. This highly distinctive and humorous style is the hallmark of the contemporary Chinese painter **Cui Zifan (崔子范)**.\n2.  **Top Middle (Image 2):** This is a traditional Chinese ink wash painting of chrysanthemums. The red seal visible in the top right corner reads \"白石\" (Báishí), which is the art name of **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**, one of the most celebrated modern Chinese artists.\n3.  **Top Right (Image 3):** This painting portrays an elderly woman from an ethnic minority group. The expressive brushwork and realistic yet dynamic depiction of the subject are characteristic of **Huang Zhou (黄胄)**, who was renowned for his paintings of life in Xinjiang and Tibet.\n4.  **Middle Left (Image 4):** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in a wild and fluid cursive script (草書, cǎoshū). This style is famously associated with the Tang Dynasty monk and calligrapher **Huaisu (懷素)**, particularly his masterpiece, the \"Autobiography Scroll\" (自叙帖).\n5.  **Middle Middle (Image 5):** This is a modern painting blending abstract elements (the sun and moon discs) with a traditional-style landscape. This technique and theme are signatures of **Liu Kuo-sung (刘国松)**, a pioneer of modern Chinese ink painting.\n6.  **Middle Right (Image 6):** This calligraphy, as identified by the OCR text, is from the \"Preface to the Sacred Teachings of the Tripitaka\" (集王聖教序). The characters for this preface were compiled from the existing works of the legendary \"Sage of Calligraphy,\" **Wang Xizhi (王羲之)** of the Jin Dynasty.\n7.  **Bottom Left (Image 7):** This is another example of vigorous cursive calligraphy. The bold, powerful, and distinctive handwriting is immediately recognizable as that of **Mao Zedong (毛泽东)**, who was also a skilled calligrapher.\n8.  **Bottom Middle (Image 8):** This famous realist oil portrait of a young woman is titled \"Youth\". It is one of the most iconic works by the celebrated contemporary artist **Chen Yifei (陈逸飞)**.\n9.  **Bottom Right (Image 9):** This painting shows a stylized woman with an ornate headdress. The elongated features, graceful lines, and rich decorative quality are characteristic of the Yunnan School of painting, pioneered by **Ding Shaoguang (丁绍光)**.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and lists the authors of the 9 artworks.\n    \"\"\"\n    authors = [\n        \"Cui Zifan\",      # 1.
