    "The image displays a time-lapse sequence (L, M, N) of a biological process under a microscope.\n\n1.  **Image L:** We see a multicellular, filamentous structure, characteristic of a fungal hypha or a filamentous alga. It is composed of elongated cells separated by cross-walls called septa. An arrowhead points to a septum.\n2.  **Image M:** At a later time, the cell wall just below the septum indicated in image L begins to bulge outwards. The arrowhead points to this emerging bulge.\n3.  **Image N:** The bulge has grown larger and has started to elongate, forming a new, small branch. The arrowhead points to the base of this new branch.\n\nThis sequence of events clearly illustrates the formation of a new branch from an existing filament. This process is known as **hyphal branching** in fungi or simply branching in other filamentous organisms. It is a fundamental mechanism for the growth and expansion of the organism's body (mycelium in the case of fungi).\n\n```text\nThe process being depicted in the image is hyphal branching in a filamentous organism, likely a fungus.\n\nThe three panels show a time-lapse sequence:\n- Panel L shows the original hyphal filament before branching begins.\n- Panel M shows the initiation of a new branch as a small bulge from the side of a cell.\n- Panel N shows the further growth of this bulge into a distinct new branch.\n\nThis is a key process for the vegetative growth and spreading of fungi and other filamentous organisms.\n```\n<<<The process depicted is hyphal branching, which is the formation of a new branch from an existing fungal hypha.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
