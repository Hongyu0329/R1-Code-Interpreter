    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will identify its three chiral centers and assign the configuration (R or S) to each one using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### My Thinking Process\n1.  **Identify the molecule and its chiral centers:** First, I'll determine the IUPAC name to systematically number the carbon atoms. The molecule is **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**. This structure has three stereocenters, located at carbons C2, C3, and C4.\n2.  **Analyze the stereochemistry at each center:**\n    *   **For C3 and C4:** The stereochemistry is drawn using standard wedge-and-dash notation, allowing for a straightforward assignment.\n    *   **For C2:** The drawing is problematic. It shows both the -OH and -CH3 groups with dashed bonds, indicating they are both pointing away from the viewer. This is physically impossible for a tetrahedral carbon. I must assume this is a drawing error. A plausible interpretation, consistent with such diagrams, is that both groups are intended to be \"behind\" the plane of the molecule, while the implied Hydrogen and the bond to C3 are \"in front\". I will proceed with this assumption to resolve the ambiguity.\n3.  **Apply CIP Rules:** I will assign priorities to the substituents on each chiral carbon based on atomic number.\n4.  **Determine R/S Configuration:**\n    *   If the lowest priority group is in the back, the configuration is determined by the direction of the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3 (clockwise = R, counter-clockwise = S).\n    *   If the lowest priority group is in the front, the result is reversed.\n5.  **Construct the Code:** The Python script will not compute the answer but will print out a clear, step-by-step explanation of the reasoning for each stereocenter, leading to the final combined configuration. It will explicitly mention the assumption made for C2.\n\n```python\ndef determine_absolute_configuration():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a step-by-step determination of the absolute configuration for the given molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step determination of the absolute configuration:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # --- IUPAC Name and Chiral Centers ---\n    molecule_name = \"5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol\"\n    chiral_centers = \"C2, C3, and C4\"\n    print(f\"1.
