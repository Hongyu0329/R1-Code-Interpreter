    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided ECG to determine the diagnosis.\n\n**ECG Analysis Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the Rhythm:** Determine if the time between consecutive heartbeats (R-R interval) is regular or irregular.\n2.  **Calculate the Heart Rate:** Determine the ventricular rate. In an irregular rhythm, we should calculate the average rate and also look at the fastest and slowest instantaneous rates.\n3.  **Examine the QRS Complexes:** Measure the duration of the QRS complexes to see if they are narrow (< 0.12s) or wide (>= 0.12s).\n4.  **Look for P waves:** Check for the presence or absence of P waves before each QRS complex.\n5.  **Synthesize Findings:** Combine these findings to select the most appropriate diagnosis from the given choices.\n\nI will use Python to perform the necessary calculations for heart rate and QRS duration based on measurements from the ECG grid. The standard ECG paper speed is 25 mm/s, meaning one small square (1 mm) represents 0.04 seconds, and one large square (5 mm) represents 0.2 seconds.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided ECG based on key characteristics and calculates relevant values.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Standard ECG calibration: 1 small square = 0.04 seconds\n    time_per_small_square_s = 0.04\n\n    # --- Step 1 & 2: Analyze Rhythm and Rate ---\n    # The R-R intervals are visibly variable, indicating an irregularly irregular rhythm.\n    # Let's measure a short and a long R-R interval to demonstrate the irregularity and calculate the range of heart rates.\n    # Measurement from ECG (approximated):\n    shortest_rr_interval_small_squares = 6\n    longest_rr_interval_small_squares = 11\n\n    # Calculate time in seconds\n    shortest_rr_time_s = shortest_rr_interval_small_squares * time_per_small_square_s\n    longest_rr_time_s = longest_rr_interval_small_squares * time_per_small_square_s\n\n    # Calculate instantaneous heart rate (beats per minute)\n    fastest_rate_bpm = 60 / shortest_rr_time_s\n    slowest_rate_bpm = 60 / longest_rr_time_s\n\n    # --- Step 3: Examine QRS Duration ---\n    # Measurement from ECG (approximated):\n    qrs_duration_small_squares = 4\n    qrs_duration_s = qrs_duration_small_squares * time_per_small_square_s\n\n    # --- Step 4 & 5: P waves and Final Diagnosis ---\n    print(\"ECG Analysis Results:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 25)\n\n    print(\"1.
