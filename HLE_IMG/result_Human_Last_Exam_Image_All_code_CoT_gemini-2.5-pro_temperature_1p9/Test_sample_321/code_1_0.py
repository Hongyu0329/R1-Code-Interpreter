    Solves the Wind-Scattered Epidemiological Puzzle.

    This function determines the unique parameter varied in each of the 9 plots
    based on a qualitative analysis of the provided system of differential equations
    and the visual features of the plots.

    The analysis proceeds by matching the unique qualitative features of each plot
    to the expected effect of varying one of the model parameters. This allows for
    a unique identification without performing a full numerical simulation.

    This process leads to the following unique identification for each plot:
    - Plot 1: The varying duration of the flattened quarantine period points to `q_l` (quarantine length).
    - Plot 2: The horizontal shift of the quarantine 'kink' is a clear sign of varying `q_s` (quarantine start day).
    - Plot 3: The smooth decreasing curves with moderate separation are consistent with varying `mu_n` (mortality rate for the large normally symptomatic group).
    - Plot 4: The specific curve crossing pattern, where a faster initial epidemic leads to a higher final number of susceptibles, is characteristic of varying `a_i` (incubation period).
    - Plot 5: The large separation in this cumulative plot suggests a parameter with a strong influence on the total outbreak size, like the transmission parameter `beta_h`.
    - Plot 6: The curve crossing suggests a trade-off. Varying `f_s` (fraction of severe cases) alters the disease pathway towards higher mortality, causing the epidemic to burn out faster but more intensely, matching the plot.
    - Plot 7: The curves are identical in shape and differ only by a scaling factor, a hallmark of varying a cost parameter (`c_l` or `c_h`) and plotting its corresponding cost function. We identify it as `c_l`.
    - Plot 8: The very subtle separation in these decreasing curves points to a parameter with a minor effect, such as `mu_h` (mortality rate for the smaller hospitalized group).
    - Plot 9: The dramatic difference in the slope during the middle phase (the quarantine period) is a definitive sign of varying `q_f` (the quarantine effectiveness factor).
