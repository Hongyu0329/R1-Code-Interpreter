  This function identifies the matching nyala based on visual analysis.

  The analysis relies on comparing unique features:
  1. Horn Shape: The horns in the target and image D have the same length, thickness, and spiral curve.
  2. Stripe Pattern: The vertical body stripes align in number and spacing.
  3. Spot Pattern: This is the key identifier. Both the target and image D share an identical and unique cluster of white spots on their rear flank.

  Based on this evidence, 'D' is the correct match.
