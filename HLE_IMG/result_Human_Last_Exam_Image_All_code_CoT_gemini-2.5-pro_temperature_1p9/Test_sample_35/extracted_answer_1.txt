The S100B protein binds to the RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts), interacting with its extracellular domains, primarily the the V-domain, the N-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain.

It could be used as a prognostic marker. Its overexpression actively drives key pathological outcomes such as neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration, as shown in the pathway. Therefore, its levels are not just associated with the disease but are indicative of its future severity and progression, which is the definition of a prognostic marker.
