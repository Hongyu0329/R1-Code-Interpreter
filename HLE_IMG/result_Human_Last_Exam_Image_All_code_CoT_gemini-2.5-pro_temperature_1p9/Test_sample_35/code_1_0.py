        "S100B could be used as a prognostic marker rather than solely an adjunct marker. Here is the reasoning:\n"
        "1.  **Direct Causal Role:** The diagram illustrates that S100B binding to RAGE directly initiates downstream signaling pathways (JNK/JUN and NFκβ) that lead to proinflammatory cytokine production (IL-6, IL-1β), apoptosis (cell death), neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. These are the core pathological processes that determine the severity and progression of neurological disorders.\n"
        "2.  **Correlation with Disease Progression:** A prognostic marker provides information about the likely course and outcome of a disease. Since the concentration of S100B is directly linked to the intensity of these damaging cellular events, higher levels of S100B would strongly predict a more aggressive disease course and a poorer prognosis.\n"
        "3.  **Beyond Association:** An adjunct marker merely assists in diagnosis, often by association. However, S100B is not just associated with the disease; it is an active driver of the pathology. Therefore, its measurement offers insight into the future progression of the disease, making it a valuable prognostic tool."

        "It could be used as a prognostic marker. Its overexpression actively drives key pathological outcomes such as neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration, as shown in the pathway. "
        "Therefore, its levels are not just associated with the disease but are indicative of its future severity and progression, which is the definition of a prognostic marker."
