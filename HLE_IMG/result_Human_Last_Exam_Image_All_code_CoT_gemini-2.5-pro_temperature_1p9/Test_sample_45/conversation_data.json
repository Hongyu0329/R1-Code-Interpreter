    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find a point around which the entire pattern can be rotated by a certain angle less than 360 degrees and still look exactly the same. The \"order\" of the rotational symmetry is the number of times the pattern matches up with itself during a full 360-degree rotation.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will identify a prominent, repeating shape in the tiling to serve as a potential center of rotation. The dark blue hexagon is a good candidate.\n2.  I will count how many identical \"spokes\" or repeating units emanate from the center of this hexagon. This count will give us the order of rotational symmetry, 'n'.\n3.  The angle of rotation for this symmetry is calculated by the equation: Angle = 360 / n.\n4.  The Python code will print out this step-by-step reasoning and state the final order of symmetry. It will also print the full equation for calculating the rotation angle as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_rotational_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the rotational symmetry of the provided tiling.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"1. Rotational symmetry is determined by finding a point around which the tiling can be rotated and remain unchanged.\")\n    print(\"2. Let's choose the center of one of the prominent blue hexagons as our center of rotation.\")\n    print(\"3. By observing the pattern, we can see that there are 6 identical arrangements of yellow and orange tiles surrounding each blue hexagon.\")\n    \n    # The order 'n' is the number of times the pattern repeats in a 360-degree rotation.\n    n_fold_symmetry = 6\n    \n    print(f\"4.
