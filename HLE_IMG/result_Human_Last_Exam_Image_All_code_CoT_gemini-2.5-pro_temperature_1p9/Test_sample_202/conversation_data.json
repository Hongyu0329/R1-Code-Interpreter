    "I will identify the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n\n1.  **Specimen H:** This rock is reddish and has many visible holes (vesicles). This vesicular texture is characteristic of extrusive volcanic rocks that cooled rapidly, trapping gas bubbles. Given its color and appearance, it is likely scoria.\n2.  **Specimen I:** This rock is composed of various angular fragments cemented together. A rock made of angular clasts is a sedimentary rock called breccia.\n3.  **Specimen J:** This is a light-colored, highly porous (vesicular) rock. Its appearance is consistent with pumice, a lightweight volcanic rock formed from frothy, gas-rich lava.\n4.  **Specimen K:** This rock displays large, interlocking crystals of different colors (light and dark). This coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture indicates it cooled slowly deep underground. This appearance is characteristic of an intrusive igneous rock like granite.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to list these identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria - A vesicular (holey) extrusive igneous rock.',\n        'I': 'Breccia - A sedimentary rock composed of large, angular fragments cemented together.',\n        'J': 'Pumice - A very light and porous volcanic rock that forms during explosive eruptions.',\n        'K': 'Granite - A coarse-grained, intrusive igneous rock composed mainly of quartz and feldspar with minor micas and amphiboles.'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for specimen, description in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {specimen}: {description}\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Granite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
