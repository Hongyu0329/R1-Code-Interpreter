    "To determine the molecular formula of the product, we will follow the reaction step-by-step and track the changes in the atomic composition of the molecule.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:**\n    The starting molecule is a complex bicyclic amide. Let's first determine its molecular formula by counting all the atoms.\n    *   The bicyclic core is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one system with a CF₃ group. The atoms are: C₆H₅N (core), plus one C from the carbonyl group (C=O), plus one C and three F's from the trifluoromethyl group (CF₃). This gives C₇H₅F₃NO for the basic bicyclic structure without any N-substituent.\n    *   The nitrogen atom is protected with a PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) group. The formula for a PMB group (-CH₂-C₆H₄-OCH₃) is C₈H₉O.\n    *   Adding the PMB group to our core means replacing one H on the nitrogen with the C₈H₉O group.\n    *   So, the formula of the starting material is C₇H₅F₃NO + C₈H₉O - H = C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂.\n\n2.  **Reaction 1: Formation of Intermediate 1**\n    *   The reagent is CAN (ceric ammonium nitrate), which is a standard reagent for removing the PMB protecting group from a nitrogen atom.\n    *   This reaction removes the PMB group (C₈H₉O) and replaces it with a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Change in atoms: -C₈, -H₉, -O₁, +H₁. Net change: -C₈, -H₈, -O₁.\n    *   Formula of Intermediate 1 = C₁₅-₈H₁₄-₈F₃NO₂-₁ = C₇H₆F₃NO.\n\n3.  **Reaction 2: Formation of Intermediate 2**\n    *   The reagents are Pd/C and H₂ (palladium on carbon and hydrogen gas). This is a standard catalytic hydrogenation reaction.\n    *   This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the bicyclic ring to a single bond (C-C).\n    *   This process adds two hydrogen atoms to the molecule.\n    *   Change in atoms: +H₂.\n    *   Formula of Intermediate 2 = C₇H₆+₂F₃NO = C₇H₈F₃NO.\n\n4.  **Reaction 3: Formation of the final Product**\n    *   The reagents are 4 N HCl at 70°C. These are strong acidic hydrolysis conditions.\n    *   The amide group (which is a lactam, a cyclic amide) within the bicyclic structure is hydrolyzed. This reaction opens the ring.\n    *   An amide hydrolysis consumes one molecule of water (H₂O) to form a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an amine (-NH₂).\n    *   Change in atoms: +H₂O.\n    *   Formula of Product = C₇H₈+₂F₃NO₁+₁ = C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the final molecular formula by applying these transformations sequentially.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_molecular_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the final product step-by-step.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the atomic composition of the starting material\n    # Formula: C15H14F3NO2\n    atoms = {'C': 15, 'H': 14, 'F': 3, 'N': 1, 'O': 2}\n    print(\"Step 0: Starting Material Formula\")\n    print_formula(atoms)\n\n    # Step 2: Reaction 1 - PMB deprotection with CAN\n    # The PMB group (p-methoxybenzyl, C8H9O) is removed, and an H atom is added.\n    # Change: -C8, -H9, -O1, +H1  (Net: -C8, -H8, -O1)\n    atoms['C'] -= 8\n    atoms['H'] -= 9\n    atoms['O'] -= 1\n    atoms['H'] += 1\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: After PMB deprotection (Intermediate 1)\")\n    print_formula(atoms)\n\n    # Step 3: Reaction 2 - Hydrogenation with Pd/C, H2\n    # The C=C double bond is reduced, adding two H atoms.\n    # Change: +H2\n    atoms['H'] += 2\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: After hydrogenation (Intermediate 2)\")\n    print_formula(atoms)\n\n    # Step 4: Reaction 3 - Amide hydrolysis with HCl\n    # The lactam is hydrolyzed, consuming one molecule of water.\n    # Change: +H2O\n    atoms['H'] += 2\n    atoms['O'] += 1\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: After amide hydrolysis (Final Product)\")\n    print_formula(atoms)\n\ndef print_formula(atom_dict):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to print the molecular formula.\"\"\"\n    formula = f\"C{atom_dict['C']}H{atom_dict['H']}F{atom_dict['F']}NO{atom_dict['O']}\"\n    print(f\"The molecular formula is: {formula}\")\n\ncalculate_molecular_formula()\n```\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
