    "Here is my plan to identify the author of each artwork:\n1.  I will examine each of the 9 images in the grid, proceeding from left to right and top to bottom.\n2.  For each artwork, I will analyze its style, subject matter, and any visible signatures or seals. The provided cropped images will be used for a more detailed look.\n3.  I will use my knowledge of art history, particularly modern and classical Chinese art, to identify the artist. I'll cross-reference the visual information (like the style of brushwork, use of color, composition, and signatures) with the known characteristics of famous artists.\n4.  For calligraphy works, I will attempt to read the characters or use the OCR results and visual style to identify the calligrapher.\n5.  Once I have identified the author for each of the 9 works, I will compile a list in the correct order.\n6.  Finally, I will present this list using a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and lists the authors of the nine artworks.\n    \"\"\"\n    authors = [\n        \"Liu Bangchu (刘邦楚)\",   # 1. Top Left: Figure painting of Yi minority women.\n        \"Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)\",  # 2. Top Middle: Abstract ink landscape.\n        \"Fu Shan (傅山)\",        # 3. Top Right: Cursive script calligraphy.\n        \"Bada Shanren (八大山人)\", # 4. Middle Left: Cursive script calligraphy.\n        \"Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)\",  # 5. Middle Center: Realist oil portrait of a young woman painting.\n        \"Lin Fengmian (林风眠)\",  # 6. Middle Right: Stylized painting of a woman in traditional dress.\n        \"Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)\",  # 7. Bottom Left: Colorful painting of a farmyard with gourds.\n        \"Li Keran (李可染)\",     # 8. Bottom Middle: Landscape painting with mountains and red-sailed boats.\n        \"Qi Baishi (齐白石)\"      # 9. Bottom Right: Ink painting of a lobster.\n    ]\n\n    print(\"From left to right, top to bottom, the authors are:\")\n    for i, author in enumerate(authors, 1):\n        print(f\"{i}. {author}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Liu Bangchu, Wu Guanzhong, Fu Shan, Bada Shanren, Jin Shangyi, Lin Fengmian, Wu Guanzhong, Li Keran, Qi Baishi>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Based on the information (e.g., style), please tell me, from left to right, from top to bottom, who is the author of each of the 9 works?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
