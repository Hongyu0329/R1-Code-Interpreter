    "Based on botanical descriptions, the most significant and easily identifiable difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* is the structure of the seta (the stalk that holds the capsule). I will provide a Python script to print this explanation.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define a function that holds the descriptive text explaining the difference.\n2.  The text will focus on the most obvious distinguishing feature: the seta's shape and its effect on the capsule's orientation.\n3.  I will contrast the straight seta of *Grimmia montana* with the characteristically curved seta of *Grimmia curviseta*.\n4.  The script will call this function to print the explanation to the console.\n\n```python\ndef distinguish_grimmia_species():\n  \"\"\"\n  Prints the main sporophyte difference between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n  \"\"\"\n  explanation = \"\"\"The primary difference in the sporophyte that helps distinguish Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta at a glance is the seta (the stalk supporting the spore capsule).\n\n1.  Grimmia montana: This species has a very short and straight seta. As a result, the capsule is held erect and is typically immersed or just emergent from the surrounding leaves.\n\n2.  Grimmia curviseta: The specific epithet 'curviseta' means 'curved seta'. This species is characterized by a seta that is distinctly curved or arched, especially when moist. This causes the capsule to be cernuous (nodding) or to hang downwards.\"\"\"\n  print(explanation)\n\ndistinguish_grimmia_species()\n```\n<<<The main distinguishing feature is the seta (capsule stalk): in *Grimmia montana* the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule erect, while in *Grimmia curviseta* the seta is distinctly curved, causing the capsule to nod or hang downwards.>>>"
