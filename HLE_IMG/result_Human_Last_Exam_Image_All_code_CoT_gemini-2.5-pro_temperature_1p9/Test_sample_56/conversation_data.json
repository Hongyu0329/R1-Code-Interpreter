    "Of course, I can help you with that.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the painting to identify its key characteristics. The artwork is a complex surrealist piece that blends interior and exterior scenes in an impossible way. I will use reverse image search with the main image provided and cross-reference the distinctive elements (like the water flowing into the room, the burning books, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and the general style) to find the painting's title and artist. Once I have reliably identified the artist, I will write a simple Python script to print the name.\n\n```python\n# The artist of the painting is identified through visual analysis and search.\n# The painting is \"La Main Chaude\" (The Hot Hand).\nartist_name = \"Jos De Mey\"\n\n# Print the name of the artist.\nprint(f\"The artist of the following painting is: {artist_name}\")\n```\n<<<Jos De Mey>>>"
