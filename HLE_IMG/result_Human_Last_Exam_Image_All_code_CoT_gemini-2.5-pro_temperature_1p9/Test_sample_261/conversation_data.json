    "Based on the visual elements in the image fragment, I can identify the book. The artwork features a glowing, ethereal unicorn with a golden horn, depicted in a painterly style. To the right, there is a portion of an ornate golden frame. This specific illustration is from the back cover of the original United States edition of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*, with artwork by Mary GrandPré. The unicorn is shown fleeing through the Forbidden Forest, and the golden frame on the right is the edge of the Mirror of Erised.\n\nSince this task involves visual recognition and knowledge of popular culture rather than computation, the following Python code simply serves to print the identified title.\n\n```python\ndef find_book_title():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the book title based on the provided cover art fragment.\n    \n    The image fragment is from the back cover of the US edition of a famous fantasy novel.\n    Key features for identification:\n    - An ethereal, glowing unicorn.\n    - The style of artist Mary GrandPré.\n    - The ornate golden frame, which is part of the Mirror of Erised.\n    \n    These elements point to the first book in the Harry Potter series.\n    \"\"\"\n    book_title = \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\"\n    print(f\"The title of the book is: {book_title}\")\n\nfind_book_title()\n```\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
