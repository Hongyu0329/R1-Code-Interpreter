1. The music modulates to the key of B major.
2. The home key is C# minor. Its relative major is E major, and the new key of B major is the dominant (V) of E major. The modulation is justified as a common progression from the tonic minor to the dominant of the relative major (i -> V/III).
3. The complete and accurate Roman numeral is IV/bVII. The chord is E major (the IV of the new key, B major), and B major is the bVII (the key of the lowered subtonic) of the home key, C# minor.
