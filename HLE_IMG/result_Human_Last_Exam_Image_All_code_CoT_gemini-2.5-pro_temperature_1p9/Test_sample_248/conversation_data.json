    "Here is my plan to identify the species that indicates an Atlantic coast location:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The photo displays a variety of marine invertebrates on a rock in the intertidal zone. I will identify the most prominent organisms, which include barnacles and several species of sea snails (periwinkles).\n2.  **Identify the Organisms:**\n    *   The most conspicuous snails are the two larger, lighter-colored ones. Their size, shape, and faint banding are characteristic of the **Common Periwinkle**, *Littorina littorea*.\n    *   There are also smaller, darker, ribbed snails, likely another species of periwinkle like the Rough Periwinkle, *Littorina saxatilis*.\n    *   The rock is covered in barnacles, likely the Northern Rock Barnacle, *Semibalanus balanoides*.\n3.  **Research Geographic Distribution:** I will check the native and introduced ranges of these species to see which one is exclusive to the Atlantic coast (when comparing North American coastlines).\n    *   **_Littorina littorea_ (Common Periwinkle):** This species is native to the northeastern Atlantic (Europe) but was introduced and is now widespread and abundant along the North American **Atlantic coast**. Crucially, it is **not established on the Pacific coast**.\n    *   **_Littorina saxatilis_ (Rough Periwinkle):** This is a North Atlantic species, found on both European and North American shores.\n    *   **_Semibalanus balanoides_ (Northern Rock Barnacle):** This is a common barnacle in the North Atlantic. Its Pacific coast counterpart is often the Acorn Barnacle, *Balanus glandula*.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The presence of the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*, is the most definitive piece of evidence. While other species present are also Atlantic, *Littorina littorea* is well-known for being an abundant species on the Atlantic coast of North America while being absent from the Pacific coast. Therefore, it is the indicator species requested.\n\n```python\n# The species in the photo that definitively indicates an Atlantic rather than Pacific coast location\n# is the Common Periwinkle. This script will print its scientific name.\n\nspecies_name = \"Littorina littorea\"\nprint(species_name)\n```\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the scientific name of the species that definitively indicates that this photo of free-living organisms was taken on the Atlantic rather than Pacific Coast?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
