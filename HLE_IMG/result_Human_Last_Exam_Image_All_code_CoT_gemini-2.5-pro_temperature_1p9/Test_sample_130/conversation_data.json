    "This image displays the emission spectrum of an element. The distinct bright lines at specific colors (wavelengths) are a unique fingerprint. By identifying the wavelengths of these prominent lines, we can determine the element. The visible lines strongly correspond to the Balmer series of hydrogen.\n\nI will use the Rydberg formula to calculate the theoretical wavelengths for the first four lines of the hydrogen Balmer series (where electrons fall to the second energy level, n=2) and show that they match the lines seen in the spectrum.\n\nThe Rydberg formula is:\n1/λ = R * (1/n₁² - 1/n₂²)\n\nwhere:\n- λ is the wavelength of the emitted light.\n- R is the Rydberg constant (~1.097 x 10⁷ m⁻¹).\n- n₁ is the principal quantum number of the lower energy level.\n- n₂ is the principal quantum number of the higher energy level.\n\nFor the Balmer series, n₁ is always 2. We will calculate for n₂ = 3, 4, 5, and 6.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_hydrogen_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the wavelengths of the first four lines of the Hydrogen Balmer series\n    using the Rydberg formula and identifies the element.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Rydberg constant in m^-1\n    R = 1.097373e7\n    # Final energy level for Balmer series\n    n1 = 2\n    # Initial energy levels for the first four lines\n    initial_levels = [3, 4, 5, 6]\n    line_names = {\n        3: \"H-alpha (Red)\",\n        4: \"H-beta (Cyan)\",\n        5: \"H-gamma (Blue-Violet)\",\n        6: \"H-delta (Violet)\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"The spectral lines in the image correspond to the Balmer series of Hydrogen.\")\n    print(\"We can verify this using the Rydberg formula: 1/wavelength = R * (1/n1^2 - 1/n2^2)\\n\")\n\n    for n2 in initial_levels:\n        # Calculate 1/wavelength\n        inv_lambda = R * ((1 / (n1**2)) - (1 / (n2**2)))\n        \n        # Calculate wavelength in meters\n        lambda_m = 1 / inv_lambda\n        \n        # Convert wavelength to nanometers\n        lambda_nm = lambda_m * 1e9\n\n        print(f\"Calculating the {line_names[n2]} line (transition from n={n2} to n={n1}):\")\n        \n        # Displaying the calculation step-by-step\n        term1 = n1**2\n        term2 = n2**2\n        print(f\"  1/wavelength = {R:.4e} * (1/{term1} - 1/{term2})\")\n        \n        fraction_val = (1/term1) - (1/term2)\n        print(f\"  1/wavelength = {R:.4e} * ({fraction_val:.6f})\")\n        \n        print(f\"  1/wavelength = {inv_lambda:.4e} m^-1\")\n        print(f\"  wavelength = {lambda_m:.4e} m = {lambda_nm:.2f} nm\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The calculated wavelengths match the prominent red, cyan, and blue-violet lines\")\n    print(\"in the provided spectrum.
