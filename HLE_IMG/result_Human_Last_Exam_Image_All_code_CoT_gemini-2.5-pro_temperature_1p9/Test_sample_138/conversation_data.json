    "To determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair, we will look for common signs of sexual dimorphism in bees and wasps.\n\n**Analysis Plan:**\n1.  **Examine Pair A (*Coelioxys* cuckoo bees):**\n    *   The insect on the left has a conical abdomen that tapers to a sharp point. This is the ovipositor (egg-laying structure) of a female, used to pierce the nests of host bees.\n    *   The insect on the right has a blunter abdomen tip with multiple small spines, which is characteristic of a male.\n    *   **Conclusion A:** Left is Female, Right is Male. This matches option **4**.\n\n2.  **Examine Pair B (*Polistes* paper wasps):**\n    *   The wasp on the left has antennae with distinctly curled tips. This is a reliable feature for identifying male wasps in this family.\n    *   The wasp on the right has straight, non-curled antennae, indicating it is a female.\n    *   **Conclusion B:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This matches option **3**.\n\n3.  **Examine Pair C (*Melissodes* long-horned bees):**\n    *   The bee on the left has noticeably long antennae that are almost the length of its body, a key characteristic of males in this group (hence the name \"long-horned bees\").\n    *   The bee on the right has much shorter and thicker antennae, which is typical for a female.\n    *   **Conclusion C:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This matches option **3**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct indices are 4 for pair A, 3 for pair B, and 3 for pair C. The following code will print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_insect_sex():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function determines and prints the indices corresponding to the sexes of the insect pairs.\n\n  Analysis:\n  - Pair A: Left insect has a pointed abdomen (female ovipositor). Right insect has a blunt abdomen (male). This is Female, Male (F, M), which is index 4.\n  - Pair B: Left wasp has curled antennae tips (male). Right wasp has straight antennae (female). This is Male, Female (M, F), which is index 3.\n  - Pair C: Left bee has very long antennae (male). Right bee has short antennae (female). This is Male, Female (M, F), which is index 3.\n\n  Options:\n  1) M, M\n  2) F, F\n  3) M, F\n  4) F, M\n  \"\"\"\n\n  # Assign the index for each pair based on the visual analysis\n  index_A = 4  # F, M\n  index_B = 3  # M, F\n  index_C = 3  # M, F\n\n  # Print the final answer as a comma-separated string\n  print(f\"{index_A},{index_B},{index_C}\")\n\nsolve_insect_sex()\n<<<4,3,3>>>\n```"
