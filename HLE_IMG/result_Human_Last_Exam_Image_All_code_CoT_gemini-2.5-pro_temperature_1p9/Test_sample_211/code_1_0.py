# The task is to identify the sociable weaver from the options that matches the target image.
#
# Step 1: Analyze the target image for unique patterns.
# The target bird has a distinct scalloped feather pattern on its back.
# A key detail is a small, subtle dark spot or feather misalignment on the upper part of its back, slightly to the right of the spine.
# The light-colored edges of the wing feathers create a specific striped pattern.
#
# Step 2: Compare each option with the target image.
# Options A, D, F, H, and I can be eliminated due to significant differences in lighting, coloration, or pattern clarity.
# Options B, C, and E are very similar but lack the specific unique marking found on the target.
#
# Step 3: Identify the best match.
# Image G shares the exact same scalloped pattern, wing feather striping, posture, and lighting as the target.
# Crucially, image G is the only option that also displays the same small, unique dark spot on the upper-right back.
#
# Therefore, G is the correct match.
