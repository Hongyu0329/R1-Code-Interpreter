    "To determine the stereochemical assignment for the four stereocenters in the reaction, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction Mechanism**: The reaction shown is an esterification between an acyl chloride and an alcohol, using pyridine as a base. This is a nucleophilic acyl substitution reaction. Crucially, this reaction mechanism does not break any bonds directly attached to the existing chiral centers. Therefore, the absolute configuration of each stereocenter is retained from reactant to product.\n2.  **Assign Stereocenter 1 (Acyl Chloride Reactant)**: We will determine the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority of the four groups attached to the chiral carbon and then use the 3D representation to assign its configuration as (R) or (S).\n3.  **Assign Stereocenter 2 (Alcohol Reactant)**: Similarly, we will assign the CIP priorities for the substituents on the alcohol's chiral center and determine its configuration.\n4.  **Assign Stereocenters 3 and 4 (Product)**: Based on the mechanism from step 1, the configuration of the third stereocenter (from the alcohol) will be the same as the second, and the fourth stereocenter (from the acyl chloride) will be the same as the first.\n\nHere is the detailed assignment for each center:\n\n*   **Stereocenter 1 (Acyl Chloride)**:\n    *   Substituents: -OMe, -C(O)Cl, -CF₃, -Ph.\n    *   Priorities (by atomic number):\n        1.  -OMe (Oxygen, Z=8).\n        2.  -C(O)Cl (Carbon attached to Cl [Z=17], O, O).\n        3.  -CF₃ (Carbon attached to F [Z=9], F, F).\n        4.  -Ph (Carbon attached to C [Z=6], C, C).\n    *   The group with the lowest priority (#4, -Ph) is in the plane of the page. The group in the back (dashed) is -OMe (#1). To simplify, we can swap the lowest priority group (-Ph) with the group in the back (-OMe).\n    *   In this new, swapped arrangement, the priority path 1(-Ph) -> 2(-C(O)Cl) -> 3(-CF₃) traces a counter-clockwise circle. This means the swapped molecule is (S).\n    *   Since a single swap inverts the stereochemistry, the original molecule must be **(R)**.\n\n*   **Stereocenter 2 (Alcohol)**:\n    *   Substituents: -OH, -CH₂OMe, -CH₂CH(Me)₂, -H.\n    *   Priorities (by atomic number):\n        1.  -OH (Oxygen, Z=8).\n        2.  -CH₂OMe (Carbon attached to O).\n        3.  -CH₂CH(Me)₂ (Carbon attached to C).\n        4.  -H (Hydrogen, Z=1).\n    *   The drawing shows the -OH group (#1) on a wedge (front), which means the lowest priority group -H (#4) is in the back (dashed).\n    *   With the lowest priority group in the back, we trace the path from 1 -> 2 -> 3. This traces a clockwise circle.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration is **(R)**.\n\n*   **Stereocenters 3 and 4 (Product)**:\n    *   As established, the reaction does not change the configuration of the stereocenters.\n    *   Stereocenter 3 (derived from the alcohol) is **(R)**.\n    *   Stereocenter 4 (derived from the acyl chloride) is **(R)**.\n\nThe final sequence of stereochemical assignments from left to right is (R), (R), (R), (R).\n\n```python\ndef assign_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and prints the stereochemical assignments for the four stereocenters\n    in the provided reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Based on CIP rules and 3D structure analysis:\n    # 1.
