    "My plan is to first analyze the provided microscopic image to identify the key features of the microorganism. I will observe its shape, whether it's single-celled or filamentous, and its reproductive structures. The staining technique, which highlights the organism in pink/purple against a blue background, suggests it is targeting specific cellular components, likely the cell wall. Based on these morphological characteristics, I will classify the type of microorganism.\n\nFinally, I will create a Python script to print out the detailed classification, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef classify_microorganism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the classification of the microorganism based on the provided image.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    morphology_description = (\"The image shows microorganisms with two distinct forms (dimorphism):\\n\"\n                              \"1. Small, ovoid, purple-staining cells that are seen budding. These are characteristic of yeast cells (also known as blastoconidia).\\n\"\n                              \"2. Elongated, branching, filament-like structures that are formed by chains of budding yeast cells that have failed to detach. These are known as pseudohyphae.\")\n    \n    organism_type = (\"Based on the presence of both budding yeast forms and pseudohyphae, the microorganism is classified as a dimorphic fungus.\\n\"\n                     \"This specific morphology is highly characteristic of yeasts from the genus Candida, most notably Candida albicans, a common agent of fungal infections (candidiasis).\")\n\n    print(\"--- Classification of the Observed Microorganism ---\")\n    print(\"\\n[Morphology]\")\n    print(morphology_description)\n    print(\"\\n[Type of Microorganism]\")\n    print(organism_type)\n\nclassify_microorganism()\n```\n<<<The image displays a dimorphic fungus, showing both budding yeast cells and pseudohyphae, which is characteristic of *Candida* species.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Based on the image of a stain viewed under a light microscope, classify what is observed in terms of morphology and type of microorganism\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
