    # Step 1: Identify the crystallographic point group and its properties.
    # The visualization V1 is clearly a Cayley graph. Counting the vertices reveals there are 10.
    # The structure of the graph, with two types of directed edges, is characteristic of the
    # Dihedral group D_5. Several other visualizations, such as V6, V7, and V9, appear to be
    # 10x10 matrices, which is consistent with a group of order 10. The only non-abelian
    # crystallographic point group of order 10 is D_5. We will proceed with this identification,
    # treating any contradictory visualizations (like V5 which appears to be 8x8) as non-standard
    # representations or potential red herrings that do not alter the group's identity.
