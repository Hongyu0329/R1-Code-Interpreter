    "This is an interesting plant with very distinct leaves. Let's identify it and find its native home.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image**: The plant has glossy, dark green leaves. The most striking characteristic is the prominent, pale green or white venation that forms a complex, net-like pattern across the leaf surface. This is known as reticulated venation.\n\n2.  **Identify the Plant**: This distinctive leaf pattern is a strong clue. While it resembles some common plants like certain *Daphne* or *Fittonia* species, a search for plants with these specific features, particularly those from unique ecosystems, leads to a specific shrub. The plant in the image is most likely *Dirichletia obovata* (also classified under the genus *Psydrax*).\n\n3.  **Determine its Origin**: Botanical records show that *Dirichletia obovata* is an endemic species. This means it only grows naturally in a very specific, limited geographic area.\n\n4.  **Find the Island**: This plant is endemic to the Socotra archipelago, a group of four islands in the Indian Ocean, belonging to Yemen. The main island is Socotra itself, famous for its incredible biodiversity and high number of endemic species.\n\n5.  **Final Answer**: The island to which this plant is endemic is Socotra. I will write a simple script to output this name.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the island to which the plant in the image is endemic.\n    The plant is Dirichletia obovata, which is endemic to the island of Socotra.\n    \"\"\"\n    island_name = \"Socotra\"\n    print(island_name)\n\nsolve()\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the name of the island to which this plant was endemic to?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
