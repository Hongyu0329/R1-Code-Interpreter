    "This image displays an ornate, 18th-century scientific instrument. Let's analyze its components to determine its function:\n\n1.  **Hand Crank:** On the left, there's a prominent wheel with four wooden handles. This indicates the machine is operated manually by turning this crank.\n2.  **Central Mechanism:** The crank connects to a mechanism housed in a gilded, decorative case. Inside this case, the crank's rotation would typically turn a glass globe or cylinder.\n3.  **Conductor and Sphere:** A large, hollow brass tube (the prime conductor) extends from the central mechanism to a large, insulated brass sphere on the right.\n\nThis setup is characteristic of an early **electrostatic generator**. The crank rotates the glass element, which rubs against pads (often silk or leather) to generate a static electrical charge through the triboelectric effect. This charge is then collected by a set of metal points (a \"comb\") and transferred via the prime conductor to the sphere, where it accumulates to a high voltage. These machines were used in the 18th and 19th centuries for scientific demonstrations and research into the nature of electricity.\n\nBased on this analysis, the other options are incorrect:\n*   A steam engine uses heat to create steam and pressure to do work; this device is hand-cranked.\n*   A telescope is an optical instrument for viewing distant objects.\n*   A vacuum pump is designed to remove air from a container.\n*   An orrery is a mechanical model of the solar system.\n\nTherefore, the object depicted is an electrostatic generator.\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
