    "The user wants me to identify which of the four Iridium(III) complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes when used in Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the molecular structures** of the four depicted complexes. They are all of the general formula `[Ir(C^N)₂(N^N)]PF₆`, where the ancillary `N^N` ligand (4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine) is the same for all, but the cyclometalating `C^N` ligands (substituted 2-phenylpyridines) differ.\n2.  **Identify the key structural feature** that influences the lifetime of these emitters. In the field of iridium-based phosphorescent emitters, operational stability is heavily influenced by the substitution on the phenyl ring of the `C^N` ligand. A widely established principle is that a hydrogen atom at the C2' position (ortho to the Ir-C bond) is a site of vulnerability, leading to degradation and shorter device lifetimes. Conversely, placing a fluorine atom at the C2' position blocks this degradation pathway and significantly enhances stability.\n3.  **Examine each complex for this feature:**\n    *   **Complex 1:** Shows fluorine atoms at both the C2' and C4' positions. The C2'-F group confers high stability. **(Long lifetime)**\n    *   **Complex 2:** Shows a fluorine atom at the C4' position, but a hydrogen atom at the C2' position. This C2'-H makes it susceptible to degradation. **(Short lifetime)**\n    *   **Complex 3:** Shows a fluorine atom at the C2' position. This confers high stability. **(Long lifetime)**\n    *   **Complex 4:** The drawing provided for Complex 4 is identical to Complex 1. This is clearly an error in the problem's image. In a series of complexes designed to test the effects of fluorination, the unsubstituted parent ligand, 2-phenylpyridine (ppy), is the most logical missing component. Assuming Complex 4 uses the `ppy` ligand, it would have a hydrogen atom at the C2' position. **(Short lifetime)**\n4.  **Formulate the conclusion:** Based on this analysis, the complexes lacking the stabilizing C2'-F group are Complex 2 and Complex 4 (under the logical assumption). Therefore, these two are expected to exhibit shorter lifetimes.\n5.  **Write a Python script** to systematically present this analysis, classify each complex, and identify the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef analyze_complex_stability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the stability of four Iridium(III) complexes based on their structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the structural features of each complex based on visual inspection.\n    # Note the substituent at the critical C2' position of the phenylpyridine ligand.\n    # A C-H at this position is a known vulnerability, leading to shorter lifetimes.\n    # A C-F at this position enhances stability and leads to longer lifetimes.\n    \n    # Complex 4 is drawn identically to Complex 1, which is an error.
