    "Here are my thinking steps to reach the diagnosis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clinical Information:** The patient is a 28-year-old female with a mass located in the sella turcica. The sella turcica houses the pituitary gland. Therefore, the primary clinical suspicion is a tumor of the pituitary gland. An intraoperative crush smear is provided, a common technique for rapid diagnosis of central nervous system and endocrine tumors.\n\n2.  **Examine the Cytology Image:**\n    *   **Cellularity and Arrangement:** The smear shows clusters of epithelial-like cells arranged in loose, syncytial sheets. There are also many single, stripped nuclei scattered in the background.\n    *   **Cellular Morphology:** The tumor cells are quite uniform (monotonous). They have round to oval nuclei with a distinctive stippled chromatin pattern, often referred to as \"salt and pepper\" chromatin. This nuclear feature is characteristic of neuroendocrine tumors. The cytoplasm is moderately abundant, eosinophilic (pink), and has indistinct cell borders.\n    *   **Background:** The background is granular and somewhat fibrillary, which is typical for crush preparations of pituitary tissue.\n    *   **Atypia:** There is no significant nuclear pleomorphism (variation in size and shape), prominent nucleoli, or high mitotic activity seen in the provided image.\n\n3.  **Synthesize Findings and Formulate a Differential Diagnosis:**\n    *   The location (sella turcica) and the classic neuroendocrine features (monotonous cells, salt-and-pepper chromatin) strongly point towards a **pituitary adenoma**. Pituitary adenomas are the most common primary tumors in this region and typically display these cytologic features, including the tendency for nuclei to be stripped from their fragile cytoplasm during smear preparation.\n    *   Other possibilities in the sella are less likely:\n        *   **Craniopharyngioma:** Would show features of squamous differentiation (like \"wet keratin\") or papillary structures, which are absent here.\n        *   **Meningioma:** Typically shows cells in whorls, with oval nuclei that may have intranuclear pseudoinclusions, but not the \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin seen here.\n        *   **Metastasis:** A neuroendocrine carcinoma metastasis (e.g., from the lung) could look similar, but a primary pituitary adenoma is far more common and fits the picture perfectly. Metastases often show more atypia.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the compelling clinical and cytological evidence, the diagnosis is Pituitary Adenoma.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# This script is designed to output the diagnostic reasoning based on the provided clinical and pathological information.\n# The user provided a case of a 28-year-old female with a sellar mass.\n\ndef provide_diagnosis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided case details and prints the diagnosis and reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    patient_age = 28\n    patient_gender = \"female\"\n    tumor_location = \"sella turcica\"\n    sample_type = \"intraoperative crush smear\"\n\n    # Print the summary of findings\n    print(\"Clinical and Pathological Analysis:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n    print(f\"Patient: {patient_age}-year-old {patient_gender}\")\n    print(f\"Finding: Mass in the {tumor_location}\")\n    print(f\"Specimen: {sample_type}\")\n    print(\"\\nMicroscopic Findings:\")\n    print(\"1.
