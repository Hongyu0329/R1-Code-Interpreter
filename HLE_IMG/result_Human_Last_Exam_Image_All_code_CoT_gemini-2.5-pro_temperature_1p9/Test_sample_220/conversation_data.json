    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Theory**: First, I will determine the theoretical 2D pattern that results from projecting a 3D Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal lattice onto a plane viewed from the [110] direction.\n2.  **Define the Pattern**: Based on crystallographic principles, the projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction results in a **centered rectangular lattice**. This pattern is characterized by having atoms at the corners of a rectangle and an additional atom precisely in the center of that rectangle. These two types of atomic positions (corners and center) typically belong to different atomic planes stacked along the viewing direction, often depicted as circles of different sizes.\n3.  **Evaluate the Options**: I will examine each of the four provided images (A, B, C, and D) to see which one matches the 'centered rectangular lattice' pattern.\n    *   **Image A** shows a simple rectangular lattice (atoms at corners only).\n    *   **Image B** shows a hexagonal lattice (characteristic of a [111] projection).\n    *   **Image C** shows a pattern that is not clearly a centered rectangle.\n    *   **Image D** shows a pattern where one set of atoms (larger circles) forms rectangles, and another set (smaller circles) is located at the center of these rectangles.\n4.  **Formulate the Code**: I will write a Python script that programmatically presents this reasoning. The script will print a step-by-step explanation of the theory and the analysis of each image, concluding with the correct answer.\n\nThis approach will use my 'coding skills' to present a logical deduction and provide the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_fcc_projection_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This program provides a step-by-step logical deduction to identify the\n    correct crystal lattice pattern for an FCC structure viewed along the\n    [110] direction.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: State the theoretical result for the projection.\n    print(\"Step 1: Understand the theoretical projection pattern.\")\n    print(\"Based on crystallography, the projection of a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice along the [110] direction results in a 2D pattern known as a 'centered rectangular lattice'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Describe the key features of the expected pattern.\n    print(\"Step 2: Identify the features of a centered rectangular lattice.\")\n    print(\"This pattern consists of atoms at the four corners of a rectangle and one additional atom located at the geometric center of that rectangle.\")\n    print(\"The atoms at the corners and the atom in the center typically lie in different planes, which are often visualized as dots of different sizes.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Step 3: Analyze each of the given image options.\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyze each of the provided images.\")\n    print(\" - Image A: Shows a 'simple rectangular' lattice.
