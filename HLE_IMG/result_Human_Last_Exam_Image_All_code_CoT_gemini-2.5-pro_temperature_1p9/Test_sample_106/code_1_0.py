# The rearrangement involves a series of [1,2] shifts of H and CH3 groups.
# Based on tracking the shifts in the Wagner-Meerwein backbone rearrangement,
# we can determine the final substituent at each numbered position.

# The mechanism analysis:
# 1. Carbocation at C-3.
# 2. Me from C-4 moves to C-3 -> Cation at C-4.
# 3. H from C-5 moves to C-4 -> Cation at C-5.
# 4. Me from C-10 moves to C-5 -> Cation at C-10.
# 5. H from C-9 moves to C-10 -> Cation at C-9.
# 6. Me from C-8 moves to C-9 -> Cation at C-8.
# 7. Me from C-14 moves to C-8 -> Cation at C-14.
# 8. H from C-13 moves to C-14 -> Cation at C-13.
# 9. Elimination of H from C-12 gives the final alkene.
