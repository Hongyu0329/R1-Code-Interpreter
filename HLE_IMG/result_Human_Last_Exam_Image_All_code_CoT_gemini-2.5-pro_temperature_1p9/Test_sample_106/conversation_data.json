    "This problem requires us to determine the substituents at five positions in a complex organic molecule after it has undergone an acid-catalyzed rearrangement. The reaction starts with a saturated pentacyclic triterpene alcohol. The conditions (catalytic HCl, 110 °C) cause dehydration to form a carbocation, which then triggers a cascade of rearrangements known as a Wagner-Meerwein or \"backbone\" rearrangement. This process involves a series of [1,2] shifts, where a hydride (H⁻) or a methyl group (CH₃⁻) moves to an adjacent carbocation center.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the rearrangement to track the substituents:\n\n1.  **Carbocation Formation**: The alcohol at position C-3 is protonated by the acid and leaves as a water molecule, creating a secondary carbocation at C-3.\n2.  **Initiation of Rearrangement**: This C-3 carbocation is stabilized by a [1,2] methyl shift from the adjacent C-4. This moves one of the methyl groups from C-4 to C-3, creating a more stable tertiary carbocation at C-4.\n3.  **Propagation of Rearrangement**: The C-4 carbocation is then neutralized by a [1,2] hydride shift from C-5 to C-4. This moves the positive charge to C-5, creating another tertiary carbocation.\n4.  **Backbone Rearrangement Cascade**: The C-5 carbocation now triggers a cascade of shifts along the fused ring system, moving the positive charge towards the right side of the molecule. The sequence is as follows:\n    *   The methyl group on C-10 shifts to C-5. The cation moves to C-10.\n    *   The hydrogen on C-9 shifts to C-10. The cation moves to C-9.\n    *   The methyl group on C-8 shifts to C-9. The cation moves to C-8.\n    *   The methyl group on C-14 shifts to C-8. The cation moves to C-14.\n    *   The hydrogen on C-13 shifts to C-14. The cation moves to C-13.\n5.  **Termination by Elimination**: The cascade stops when the carbocation is at C-13. A stable alkene is then formed by eliminating a proton (H⁺) from the adjacent C-12, creating the final C-12=C-13 double bond.\n\nBy tracking the initial positions of all the groups and where they end up, we can determine the final substituents at the numbered positions.\n\n*   **Position 1 (at C-4)**: Originally had two CH₃ groups. One shifted to C-3. It then received an H from C-5. The remaining original substituent is **CH₃**.\n*   **Position 2 (at C-10)**: Originally had a CH₃ group, which shifted to C-5. It then received an H from C-9. The final substituent is **H**.\n*   **Position 3 (at C-9)**: Originally had an H, which shifted to C-10. It then received a CH₃ from C-8. The final substituent is **CH₃**.\n*   **Position 4 (at C-8)**: Originally had a CH₃ group, which shifted to C-9. It then received a CH₃ from C-14. The final substituent is **CH₃**.\n*   **Position 5 (at C-14)**: Originally had a CH₃ group, which shifted to C-8. It then received an H from C-13. The final substituent is **H**.\n\nThe following Python code prints the final answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# The rearrangement involves a series of [1,2] shifts of H and CH3 groups.\n# Based on tracking the shifts in the Wagner-Meerwein backbone rearrangement,\n# we can determine the final substituent at each numbered position.\n\n# The mechanism analysis:\n# 1.

H from C-9 moves to C-10 -> Cation at C-9.\n# 6. Me from C-8 moves to C-9 -> Cation at C-8.\n# 7. Me from C-14 moves to C-8 -> Cation at C-14.\n# 8. H from C-13 moves to C-14 -> Cation at C-13.\n# 9.
