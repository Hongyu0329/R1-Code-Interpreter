    "Here is my step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrum (MS)**\nThe mass spectrum provides the molecular weight (MW) of the compound. The label \"(M+) m/z 135\" indicates that the molecular ion peak is at m/z 135. Thus, the molecular weight is 135 g/mol. According to the nitrogen rule, an odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule. The IR spectrum also suggests an amine, so we can assume one nitrogen atom is present.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\nThe IR spectrum shows key absorption bands that indicate the functional groups present:\n*   A broad peak around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ is characteristic of an N-H bond stretch, likely from a primary or secondary amine. The possible presence of two small spikes suggests a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   Peaks just above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate aromatic C-H stretching.\n*   Peaks just below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate aliphatic C-H stretching.\n*   Sharp peaks around 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1450-1500 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of C=C stretching in an aromatic ring.\n*   The absence of a strong peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ indicates there is no carbonyl (C=O) group.\nThis data points to a compound containing a benzene ring, aliphatic groups, and an amine group.\n\n**Step 3: Propose a Molecular Formula**\nBased on the MS and IR data, we have MW=135 and the presence of a C₆H₅ group (from the strong NMR evidence below) and one Nitrogen atom.\n*   Mass of C₆H₅ = (6 * 12) + (5 * 1) = 77\n*   Mass of N = 14\n*   Remaining mass = 135 - 77 - 14 = 44\n*   A fragment with mass 44 could be C₃H₈ (3*12 + 8*1 = 44).\nCombining these fragments (C₆H₅, N, C₃H₈) gives a potential molecular formula of **C₉H₁₃N**. Let's verify the MW: (9 * 12.01) + (13 * 1.01) + (1 * 14.01) ≈ 135.2, which matches the M+ peak. The degree of unsaturation for C₉H₁₃N is 4, which is consistent with one benzene ring.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the NMR Spectra (¹H, ¹³C, DEPT, HSQC)**\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   A complex multiplet around δ 7.2 ppm integrating to 5H is a classic signal for a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n    *   A doublet at δ 1.2 ppm integrating to 3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a single proton (-CH).\n    *   A complex, overlapping region around δ 2.8-3.1 ppm integrating to a total of 3H (likely a 2H multiplet and a 1H multiplet) represents the remaining aliphatic protons.\n*   **¹³C NMR and DEPT-135:**\n    *   There are 7 distinct carbon signals. The signals at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 are in the aromatic region, consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring (which has 6 carbons but only 4 unique signals due to symmetry). The signal at 145.1 ppm is the quaternary ipso-carbon (absent in DEPT). The other three are CH carbons (positive in DEPT).\n    *   The aliphatic signals are at δ 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2.\n    *   DEPT-135 shows one negative signal (a CH₂ group) and five positive signals (CH and CH₃ groups).\n    *   Since we have 3 aromatic CH groups, the remaining 2 positive signals must be one aliphatic CH and one aliphatic CH₃. This perfectly accounts for our 3 aliphatic carbons.\n*   **HSQC:** This 2D spectrum correlates the protons with the carbons they are attached to:\n    *   ¹H (δ 1.2 ppm, doublet) correlates with ¹³C (δ 19.2 ppm). This confirms the CH₃ group.\n    *   ¹H (δ ~2.8 ppm, multiplet) correlates with ¹³C (δ 43.5 ppm). This must be the CH₂ group.\n    *   The remaining ¹H (δ ~3.1 ppm, multiplet) must correlate with the remaining ¹³C (δ 49.6 ppm), the CH group.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Structure and Determine the IUPAC Name**\nThe fragments identified are: a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), a primary amine (-NH₂), and a three-carbon chain consisting of a CH₂, a CH, and a CH₃ group.\nThe ¹H NMR showed a -CH-CH₃ fragment (from the 3H doublet). The remaining pieces are C₆H₅-, -CH₂-, and -NH₂ to be attached to the -CH- group.\nThere are two ways to assemble this:\n1.  **1-phenylpropan-2-amine:** `C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃`\n2.  **2-phenylpropan-1-amine:** `C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂`\n\nBoth isomers fit the general NMR data. However, careful consideration of the chemical shifts and mass spectrum fragmentation favors structure 1. The ¹³C shift for a carbon attached to nitrogen (C-N) is typically around 50 ppm, and a benzylic carbon (C-Ph) is around 40-45 ppm. The HSQC shows the CH group is at 49.6 ppm and the CH₂ group is at 43.5 ppm. This matches structure 1: the CH group is the C-N, and the CH₂ group is benzylic. In addition, the characteristic base peak for this molecule in mass spectrometry is m/z 44 ([CH₃CHNH₂]⁺), which is consistent with the appearance of the provided spectrum.\n\nTherefore, the compound is 1-phenylpropan-2-amine (commonly known as amphetamine).\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the step-by-step reasoning for identifying the compound\n    and verifies the molecular formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"--- Structural Analysis Summary ---\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Molecular Formula Determination from Mass Spectrum and IR\")\n    mw = 135  # From (M+) m/z 135\n    print(f\"The molecular weight is {mw} g/mol.
