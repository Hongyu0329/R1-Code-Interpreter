    "Based on the analysis of the sheet music provided, I can identify the song's details.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  **Analyze Musical Elements:** I will examine the key signature, time signature, chord progressions (e.g., C, E7, F, G7), melody, and rhythmic patterns presented in the sheet music. The fast tempo (indicated by J=176), syncopation, and chromatic passages are key identifiers.\n2.  **Identify Distinctive Features:** The handwritten title at the top, though blurry, appears to read \"Tico-Tico\". The main melodic theme, especially the chromatic run in the third measure, is highly characteristic.\n3.  **Cross-Reference and Verify:** I will cross-reference these features with known musical pieces. The title, melody, and chording strongly point to the famous Brazilian song \"Tico-Tico no Fub치\".\n4.  **Determine Genre and Origin:** By confirming the title is \"Tico-Tico no Fub치,\" I can ascertain its musical style (Choro) and its country of origin (Brazil), as it was composed by the Brazilian Zequinha de Abreu.\n5.  **Generate Code:** I will create a Python script to print the final answer in a clear format.\n\n```python\ndef get_song_information():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the information about the identified song.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Tico-Tico no Fub치\"\n    style = \"Choro\"\n    origin = \"Brazil\"\n\n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Musical Style: {style}\")\n    print(f\"Country of Origin: {origin}\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the song's details.\nget_song_information()\n```\n<<<Title: Tico-Tico no Fub치, Musical Style: Choro, Country of Origin: Brazil>>>"
