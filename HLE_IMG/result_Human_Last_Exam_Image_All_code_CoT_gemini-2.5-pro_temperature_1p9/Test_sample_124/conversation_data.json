    "To calculate the total current flowing from the voltage source, we need to find the total equivalent resistance of the circuit. We can do this by simplifying the circuit step-by-step.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Circuit:** The circuit diagram shows a voltage source (V2) connected to two main parallel branches.\n2.  **Simplify the Right Branch:** The right branch consists of resistors R7 and R8 connected in series. Their combined resistance is `R_right = R7 + R8`.\n3.  **Simplify the Left Branch:** The left branch contains resistors R1, R2, and R3, along with some additional wires. These wires create short circuits.\n    *   A wire runs in parallel with R1, effectively short-circuiting it (its resistance becomes negligible).\n    *   Another wire connects the point between R2 and R3 to the positive terminal of the source. This configuration, combined with the first short, results in both ends of R2 being at the same potential, thus short-circuiting R2 as well.\n    *   This leaves only R3 connected across the voltage source in this branch.\n4.  **Calculate Total Current:** Once simplified, the circuit consists of R3 in parallel with the series combination of (R7 + R8). The total current is the sum of the currents flowing through these two parallel branches, according to Ohm's Law and Kirchhoff's Current Law.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom io import StringIO\n\ndef solve_circuit():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided circuit diagram to calculate the total current.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Component values from the circuit diagram\n    V2 = 1.0   # Volts\n    R1 = 3.0   # Ohms\n    R2 = 7.0   # Ohms\n    R3 = 9.0   # Ohms\n    R7 = 100.0 # Ohms\n    R8 = 100.0 # Ohms\n\n    # --- Step-by-step analysis and calculation ---\n    \n    # Create a string buffer to hold the output\n    output_buffer = StringIO()\n    \n    # Redirect stdout to the buffer\n    original_stdout = sys.stdout\n    sys.stdout = output_buffer\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the circuit and identify component values.\")\n    print(f\"Voltage source V2 = {V2} V\")\n    print(f\"Resistors: R1={R1} Ω, R2={R2} Ω, R3={R3} Ω, R7={R7} Ω, R8={R8} Ω\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Simplify the left branch of the circuit.\")\n    print(\"- R1 is in parallel with a wire (a short circuit).
