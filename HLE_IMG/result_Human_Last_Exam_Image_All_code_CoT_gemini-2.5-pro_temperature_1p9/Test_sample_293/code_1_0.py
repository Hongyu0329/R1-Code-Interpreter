Histopathological Diagnosis: Crescentic Glomerulonephritis

Analysis of the Image:
The provided image is a high-power view of a kidney glomerulus stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E).

Key Findings:
1.  **Crescent Formation:** The most striking feature is a large, cellular crescent occupying Bowman's space. This crescent is formed by the proliferation of parietal epithelial cells and the infiltration of inflammatory cells.
2.  **Glomerular Compression:** The cellular crescent is compressing the central glomerular tuft.
3.  **Hypercellularity:** The glomerular tuft itself is hypercellular.

Conclusion:
The combination of these features, especially the prominent cellular crescent, is the pathognomonic finding for Crescentic Glomerulonephritis. This is a severe form of glomerular injury that clinically manifests as Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN), leading to a rapid loss of kidney function.
