    print("The most obvious sign is the white, fuzzy, ball-shaped growth on the twig. This is an insect-induced structure called a gall. It is likely a wool sower gall, which is created by a specific type of insect, the cynipid gall wasp (*Callirhytis seminator*).")
    
    print("\n2. Where the Eggs are Laid:")
    print("The gall wasp that creates this structure lays its eggs inside the oak's woody twig. Following egg-laying, the chemical secretions from the wasp's eggs and the hatched larvae manipulate the tree into forming the gall.")
    print("This gall acts as a protective nursery and a source of food for the developing wasp larvae inside. So, for the insect that made this prominent gall, the eggs are laid inside the plant's tissue, which then develops into the gall structure.")
    
    print("\n3. Other Evidence:")
    print("The cropped images also show other, more subtle signs of insect activity, such as minor chewing damage on leaf edges and a small cluster of white eggs laid on the surface of one of the leaves by a different insect.")
