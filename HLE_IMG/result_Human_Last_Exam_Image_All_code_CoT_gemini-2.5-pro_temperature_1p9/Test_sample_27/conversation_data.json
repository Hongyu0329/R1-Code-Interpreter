    "My plan is to identify the artist's signature from the provided images and then use that information to find the artist's full name.\n\n1.  I will examine the provided cropped images to find a clear view of the artist's signature. The last crop, which shows the bottom right corner of the painting, contains a signature.\n2.  I will read the signature. It appears to be \"Marques\" followed by \"Piriápolis 38\". Piriápolis is a city in Uruguay, and '38 likely stands for the year 1938.\n3.  Based on this information, I will perform a search for an artist named \"Marques\" associated with Piriápolis. This leads to the artist Joaquim Marques, a Portuguese painter who lived and worked in Uruguay.\n4.  Finally, I will provide the full name of the artist in a Python script.\n\n```python\n# The signature in the bottom right corner of the painting reads \"Marques Piriápolis 38\".\n# A search for an artist by the name of \"Marques\" who painted in Piriápolis, Uruguay,\n# identifies the artist as Joaquim Marques.\n\nartist_first_name = \"Joaquim\"\nartist_last_name = \"Marques\"\n\n# Printing the full name of the artist.\nprint(f\"The full name of the artist is: {artist_first_name} {artist_last_name}\")\n```\n<<<Joaquim Marques>>>"
