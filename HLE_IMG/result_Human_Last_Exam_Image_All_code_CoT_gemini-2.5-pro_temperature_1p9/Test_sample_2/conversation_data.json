    "To determine the time complexity of the given sorting algorithm, we need to analyze its behavior in the worst-case scenario.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Recursive Structure:** The function `sort(a, n)` calls itself with the argument `n-1`. This is a recursive algorithm. The base case for the recursion is when `n <= 1`, at which point the function does nothing and returns.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation:** Let `T(n)` be the time taken by the algorithm for an input of size `n`.\n    *   Inside the `if n > 1` block, the algorithm performs the following steps:\n        1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: This is a recursive call on a subproblem of size `n-1`. Its cost is `T(n-1)`.\n        2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]: swap(...)`: This comparison and potential swap take constant time, which we can denote as `c` or `O(1)`.\n        3.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: This is a second recursive call, also on a subproblem of size `n-1`. It is only executed if the `if` condition is true.\n\n3.  **Determine the Worst Case:** The worst case for time complexity occurs when the `if` condition is true as often as possible, thus triggering the second recursive call. This happens, for example, when the input array `a` is sorted in descending order. In this scenario, at each level of recursion `sort(a, k)`, the element `a[k-1]` will need to be swapped, leading to both recursive calls being executed.\n\n4.  **Write the Worst-Case Recurrence Relation:** In the worst case, the total time `T(n)` is the sum of the time for the first recursive call, the constant time for the comparison/swap, and the time for the second recursive call.\n    *   `T(n) = T(n - 1) + c + T(n - 1)`\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    *   The base case is `T(1) = O(1)`.\n\n5.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:** We can solve this recurrence relation by expansion:\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 7c`\n    *   The general pattern is `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + (2^k - 1) * c`.\n    *   Setting `k = n-1`, we reach the base case `T(1)`:\n    *   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-1) - 1) * c`\n    *   Since `T(1)` and `c` are constants, the dominant term is `2^(n-1)`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The time complexity is proportional to `2^n`. Therefore, the worst-case time complexity is `O(2^n)`.\n\nTo verify this, the following Python code implements the algorithm with a counter for the number of comparisons. It demonstrates the exponential growth on a worst-case input (a reverse-sorted array).\n\n```python\ndef swap(arr, i, j):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to swap elements.\"\"\"\n    arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n\ndef sort_and_count(a, n, counter):\n    \"\"\"The given sort algorithm with a comparison counter.\"\"\"\n    # The base case is implicitly handled by the n > 1 check\n    if n > 1:\n        # First recursive call\n        sort_and_count(a, n - 1, counter)\n\n        # Increment counter for the comparison\n        counter[0] += 1\n        if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n            swap(a, n - 1, n - 2)\n            # Second recursive call (in the worst-case path)\n            sort_and_count(a, n - 1, counter)\n\ndef analyze_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the number of comparisons for the algorithm with worst-case inputs\n    of increasing size n.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the number of comparisons for the algorithm on worst-case inputs:\")\n    for n in range(1, 11):\n        # A reverse-sorted array is a worst-case input.\n        arr = list(range(n, 0, -1))\n        # Use a list for the counter to make it mutable across function calls.\n        counter = [0]\n        sort_and_count(arr, n, counter)\n        print(f\"For n = {n}, number of comparisons is {counter[0]}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe number of operations grows exponentially, which is characteristic of O(2^n).\")\n    print(\"For instance, the recurrence T(n) = 2*T(n-1) + c leads to exponential complexity.\")\n\nanalyze_complexity()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
