    "Here is my plan to solve this chess puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial position:** I'll examine the white king's position on `g1`. I'll identify its potential escape squares and which black pieces are restricting its movement. The key is to see that the king's only available escape square is `g2`.\n2.  **Formulate a strategy:** Black needs to make a first move that prepares a checkmate for the second move. This checkmate must work regardless of what white does. This means black's second move must be able to counter both a king move (`Kg2`) and any other move by white (like moving a pawn).\n3.  **Identify the key move:** The critical threat for black is to play the knight to `f2`. This move attacks the king and many surrounding squares. However, in the initial position, the white bishop on `c1` can capture the knight if it moves to `f2`.\n4.  **Find the solution:** The first move for black must neutralize the defense of the white bishop. Moving the black pawn from `d4` to `d3` achieves this by blocking the bishop's path to `f2`.\n5.  **Verify the mate:** After black plays `1... d3`, I will verify that `2... Nf2#` is checkmate against all possible replies from white:\n    *   If white moves the king (`2. Kg2`), the knight on `f2` still delivers checkmate, with the bishop on `h3` now defending the knight's attack on the `h3` square.\n    *   If white makes any other move (like capturing the pawn with `2. cxd3` or moving the `h`-pawn), the king remains on `g1`, and `2... Nf2#` is mate because all escape squares are covered and the white bishop is blocked from capturing the knight.\n6.  **Construct the code:** I will write a simple Python script to print the two-move sequence for black.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the solution to the \"mate in 2\" chess puzzle for black.\n    It prints the required sequence of moves in standard chess notation.\n    \"\"\"\n    move_1 = \"d3\"\n    move_2 = \"Nf2#\"\n\n    print(\"The sequence for mate in 2 for black is:\")\n    print(f\"1... {move_1}\")\n    print(f\"2... {move_2}\")\n\nsolve_chess_puzzle()\n```\n<<<d3, Nf2#>>>"
