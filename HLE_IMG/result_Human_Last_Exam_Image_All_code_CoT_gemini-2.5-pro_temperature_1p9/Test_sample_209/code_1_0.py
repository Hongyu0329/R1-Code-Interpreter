  """
  This function analyzes the giraffe patterns and identifies the match.
  
  Analysis:
  - The target giraffe has a very distinctive spot pattern on its shoulder.
  - Key features identified: A cross-shaped pattern made by the light-colored lines at the top of the shoulder, and a specific cluster of dark spots below it.
  - Comparing this to the options:
    - A, C, D, E, F: These images show giraffes with different spot patterns, shapes, and colors. The key features from the target are absent.
    - B: This image clearly shows the same cross-shaped pattern and the same cluster of spots on the shoulder as the target giraffe.
  
  Conclusion: Image B shows the same giraffe as the target image.
