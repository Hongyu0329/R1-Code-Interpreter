    "To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Molecules**: First, I will identify the structures of the three distinct molecules depicted in the image: the two reactants and the one product. I will represent each of these molecules using their SMILES strings.\n    *   **Molecule 1 (Reactant)**: This is 4-((3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)oxy)-5-fluoropyridin-2-amine.\n    *   **Molecule 2 (Reactant)**: This is 7-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyrazine.\n    *   **Molecule 3 (Product)**: This is 7-(2-amino-5-fluoropyridin-4-yl)-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyrazine, which is the result of a C-N coupling reaction.\n\n2.  **Filter by Crippen logP**: The problem requires us to consider only the molecules with a Crippen logP greater than 1. I will use the RDKit library to calculate the logP for each of the three molecules.\n\n3.  **Calculate Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI)**: For each molecule that meets the logP > 1 criterion, I will calculate its Eccentric Connectivity Index. The ECI is defined as the sum of the products of the vertex degree and eccentricity for each atom in the molecule, including hydrogen atoms. The calculation steps are:\n    a. Add explicit hydrogen atoms to the molecular graph.\n    b. For each atom, find its degree (number of connected atoms).\n    c. Calculate the distance matrix for all pairs of atoms in the graph.\n    d. For each atom, find its eccentricity (the maximum distance from it to any other atom).\n    e. Compute the ECI by summing `degree * eccentricity` over all atoms.\n\n4.  **Sum the Indices**: Finally, I will sum the calculated Eccentric Connectivity Indices of all the molecules that passed the logP filter to get the final answer. The final output will include the breakdown of the sum as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport subprocess\n\n# Install rdkit if it is not already installed\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\n    from rdkit.Chem import Crippen\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"RDKit library not found.
