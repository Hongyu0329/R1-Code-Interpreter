    This function implements the logic derived from analyzing the cellular automata patterns.
    
    1. Rules for patterns A-H are identified based on their visual structure at t=20.
    2. A 'RuleSum' metric (number of sums yielding '1') is calculated for each rule.
    3. Images 1-8 are ranked by visual density.
    4. The mapping is established by correlating RuleSum with density.
    5. Tie-breaks are resolved by comparing density formulas based on plausible assumptions about the distribution of neighborhood sums in the initial pattern.
    
    The mapping is determined as follows:
    - A -> 2
    - B -> 7
    - C -> 1
    - D -> 3
    - E -> 6
    - F -> 4
    - G -> 8
    - H -> 5
