    "This image illustrates a classic auditory illusion.\n*   The top panel is a spectrogram (showing frequency over time), and the bottom panel is the corresponding waveform.\n*   Initially, we see a single, steady pure tone (one horizontal line in the spectrogram, a simple sine wave below).\n*   This tone is then briefly interrupted by a burst of wide-spectrum noise (the vertical smear in the spectrogram and the chaotic-looking part of the waveform).\n*   After the noise, the sound resumes.\n*   The illusion is that a listener will perceive the original pure tone as continuing uninterrupted *through* the noise burst. The brain perceptually \"restores\" the missing part of the tone, filling in the gap.\n*   This powerful example of top-down processing, where the brain uses context to fill in missing sensory information, is known as the Phonemic Restoration Effect. Although the name refers to phonemes (speech sounds), it is often used for this general class of auditory completion illusions, even with non-speech stimuli like the tone shown here. The more general, technical term is the Auditory Continuity Illusion. Given its fame, the Phonemic Restoration Effect is the most likely intended answer.\n\nTo provide the answer, I will use a simple Python script as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_phenomenon_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the name of the auditory illusion depicted in the image.\n    The illusion involves the brain perceptually \"filling in\" a sound\n    that has been obscured by another sound, such as a burst of noise.\n    \"\"\"\n    name = \"Phonemic Restoration Effect\"\n    print(name)\n\nfind_phenomenon_name()\n```\n<<<Phonemic Restoration Effect>>>"
