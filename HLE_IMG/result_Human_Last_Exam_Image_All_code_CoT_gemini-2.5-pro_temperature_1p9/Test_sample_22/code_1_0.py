# Based on the visual analysis of the six knot diagrams provided.
# A knot is isotopic to the unknot if it can be deformed into a simple circle
# without cutting or passing the strand through itself.

# K1 is the stevedore knot (6_1), which is not the unknot.
# K2 is a complex but untangleable diagram of the unknot.
# K3 is a simple two-crossing diagram of the unknot.
# K4 is the figure-eight knot (4_1), which is not the unknot.
# K5 is another complex diagram that simplifies to the unknot.
# K6 is the 6_2 knot, which is not the unknot.

unknot_indices = [2, 3, 5]

# The final answer is the list of indices corresponding to the unknots.
