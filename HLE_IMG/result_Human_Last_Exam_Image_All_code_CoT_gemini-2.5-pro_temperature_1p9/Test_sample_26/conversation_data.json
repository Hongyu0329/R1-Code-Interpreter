    "My plan is to analyze the harmony in measure 30 of the provided score to determine its Roman numeral in the context of the piece's key.\n\n1.  **Identify the Key:** The first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata is in C minor. The key signature of three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭) confirms this.\n2.  **Identify the Notes:** I will identify all the notes played in measure 30, which is the measure circled in the image.\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The notes form a broken chord: D - F♯ - A - C.\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The note played is G.\n3.  **Analyze the Harmony:** The notes together are G in the bass, with a D-F♯-A-C chord played above it.\n    *   The notes D-F♯-A-C form a **D dominant 7th chord (D7)**.\n    *   In the key of C minor, the dominant (V) chord is G major.\n    *   The D7 chord functions as the dominant of G (V of V). This is known as a \"secondary dominant\" because it temporarily treats the dominant (G) as the tonic and creates a strong pull towards it. The measure immediately following (m. 31) confirms this by resolving to a G major chord.\n4.  **Determine the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   The Roman numeral for a dominant seventh chord is **V7**.\n    *   Since this is the dominant of the dominant chord (V of V), its Roman numeral is written as **V7/V**.\n5.  **Construct Python Code:** I will write a Python script that explains this analysis and prints the final Roman numeral character by character.\n\n```python\ndef get_roman_numeral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the chord in measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" sonata,\n    1st movement, and prints its Roman numeral analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n    key = \"C minor\"\n    bass_note = \"G\"\n    right_hand_notes = [\"D\", \"F#\", \"A\", \"C\"]\n    chord_name = \"D7\"\n    function = \"V7/V\"\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of the Chord ---\")\n    print(f\"The key of the piece is {key}.\")\n    print(f\"The notes in measure 30 are {', '.join(right_hand_notes)} over a {bass_note} in the bass.\")\n    print(f\"These notes form a {chord_name} chord.\")\n    print(f\"In the key of {key}, the V (dominant) chord is G major.\")\n    print(f\"The {chord_name} chord is the dominant of G, making it a secondary dominant.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the function of this chord is the 'dominant of the dominant', or V of V.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Roman Numeral Equation ---\")\n    numeral_components = ['V', '7', '/', 'V']\n    print(f\"The final Roman numeral is: {''.join(numeral_components)}\")\n    print(\"\\nPrinting each character of the numeral:\")\n    for char in numeral_components:\n        print(char)\n\nget_roman_numeral()\n```\n<<<V7/V>>>"
