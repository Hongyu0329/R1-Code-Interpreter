    "**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants to identify the timestamps of synchronized neuronal bursts from the provided raster plot and then calculate the average inter-burst interval (IBI). The result should be rounded to two significant figures.\n\n2.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** I will examine the plot to find points in time where a large number of electrodes fire simultaneously. These appear as dense vertical bands of black dots.\n    *   A burst is clearly visible starting around 4s and peaking around **5 s**.\n    *   A very distinct, sharp burst is centered at **16 s**.\n    *   Another sharp burst is centered at **26 s**.\n    *   Another sharp burst is centered at **36 s**.\n    *   A final, slightly broader burst is centered around **49 s**.\n    *   So, the identified burst timestamps are approximately: 5, 16, 26, 36, and 49 seconds.\n\n3.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** The IBI is the time difference between the midpoints of consecutive bursts.\n    *   IBI 1 = 16 s - 5 s = 11 s\n    *   IBI 2 = 26 s - 16 s = 10 s\n    *   IBI 3 = 36 s - 26 s = 10 s\n    *   IBI 4 = 49 s - 36 s = 13 s\n    *   The calculated intervals are: 11 s, 10 s, 10 s, and 13 s.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Average IBI:**\n    *   Sum of IBIs = 11 + 10 + 10 + 13 = 44 s\n    *   Number of IBIs = 4\n    *   Average IBI = Sum of IBIs / Number of IBIs = 44 / 4 = 11 s.\n\n5.  **Format the Output:** The final result needs to be expressed to two significant figures. The calculated average, 11 s, already has two significant figures.\n\n6.  **Develop Python Code:** I will write a Python script to formalize and automate these calculations.\n    *   Store the burst timestamps in a list.\n    *   Calculate the intervals and store them in a new list.\n    *   Compute the average of the intervals.\n    *   Print all the steps, including the identified timestamps, the calculated intervals, and the final average calculation, formatted as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_average_ibi():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies timestamps of synchronized bursts from a neuronal activity graph,\n    calculates the inter-burst intervals (IBIs), and computes their average.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the approximate timestamps of the synchronized bursts from the graph.\n    # Bursts are the dense vertical lines of firing activity.\n    burst_timestamps = [5, 16, 26, 36, 49]\n    print(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (the time between consecutive bursts).\n    inter_burst_intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\n    print(f\"Calculated inter-burst intervals (s): {list(inter_burst_intervals)}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the average of the inter-burst intervals.\n    average_ibi = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\n\n    # Create the equation string\n    intervals_str = ' + '.join(map(str, inter_burst_intervals))\n    equation = f\"({intervals_str}) / {len(inter_burst_intervals)}\"\n\n    # Step 4: Print the final calculation and the result rounded to two significant figures.\n    print(f\"\\nAverage Inter-Burst Interval Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Average = {equation} = {average_ibi:.2g} s\")\n\n    # Final answer in the required format\n    print(f\"\\n<<<The average inter-burst interval is {average_ibi:.2g} s>>>\")\n\n\n# Run the calculation\ncalculate_average_ibi()\n\n```\n<<<11>>>"
