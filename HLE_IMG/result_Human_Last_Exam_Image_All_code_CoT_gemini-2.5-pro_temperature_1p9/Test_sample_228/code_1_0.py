    This script outlines the thinking process and provides the answer to the question.
    The task is to identify the early 20th-century theorist whose ideas are reflected in the provided collage.

    1.  **Analyze Artwork Style:** The piece is a surrealist collage. This style combines disparate images to create a dream-like and illogical scene.
    2.  **Analyze Artwork Content:** The collage features:
        - A hybrid creature (woman with a deer head), suggesting a mix of human and primal instincts.
        - Direct reference to the myth of "Persephone," a story of descent into the underworld (the subconscious).
        - Juxtaposition of the natural world with modern commercialism ("Resort Hotel").
        - Poetic, fragmented text evoking dreams and psychological states ("superstitious," "human cry developing hybrids").
    3.  **Connect to a Theorist:** The Surrealist movement was explicitly based on the psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud. His ideas about the unconscious mind, dream interpretation, and repressed desires are the direct intellectual source for this artistic style and its themes. The collage functions as a visual representation of a Freudian dreamscape.
