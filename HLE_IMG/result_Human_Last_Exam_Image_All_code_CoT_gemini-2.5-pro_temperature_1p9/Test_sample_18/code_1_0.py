    This function determines and prints the solution to the chess puzzle.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. The hidden piece is identified as the White King.
    2. Its position is deduced to be b4, as this allows for a mate in 1, which is the fastest possible.
       This position is chosen over another possibility (King on b8) based on plausibility.
    3. The mating move is 1. ... Qc2#.
