    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Kakuro puzzle to find the numbers in the two top white squares.\n\n**1. Understanding the Goal**\nThe goal is to determine the digits (1-9) in the two white squares at the very top of the puzzle. According to the rules of Kakuro, each digit within a single sum (a single row or column block) must be unique.\n\n**2. Identifying the Relevant Cells and Clues**\nLet's label the two top white squares as Cell A (left) and Cell B (right). We need to find the numbers that go into A and B.\n\nTo do this, we need to interpret the clues around them. The diagram is presented in a 3D-like style, which can be confusing. We will analyze the clues that most directly relate to cells A and B based on standard Kakuro conventions where a clue applies to the adjacent run of white cells.\n\n*   **The Horizontal Clue (Row Sum):** There is a clue `17` on a plane that borders the top row containing Cell A and Cell B. The most natural interpretation is that this is the sum for that row.\n    *   Clue: `A + B = 17`\n\n*   **The Vertical Clue for Cell A (Column Sum):** There is a clue `15` on a plane adjacent to the column that starts with Cell A. Let's call the cell below A, Cell C.\n    *   Clue: `A + C = 15`\n\n*   **The Vertical Clue for Cell B (Column Sum):** There is a clue `29` on a plane adjacent to the column starting with Cell B. This column appears to have four cells in its run. Let's call the cells below B, Cell D, Cell E, and Cell F.\n    *   Clue: `B + D + E + F = 29`\n\n**3. Careful Points & Analysis**\n\n*   **Analyzing `A + B = 17`:**\n    *   We need to find two unique digits from 1 to 9 that sum to 17.\n    *   The only possible combination is 8 and 9 (since 8 + 9 = 17). Any other combination would either require a digit greater than 9 or use the same digit twice (e.g., 8.5+8.5).\n    *   So, the numbers in the two top squares must be 8 and 9. The question asks for \"two numbers,\" not their specific positions, so this might be enough.\n\n*   **Verifying with Other Clues for Consistency:** Let's see if this conclusion holds up with the other clues we identified. We have two possibilities:\n    *   **Case 1: A = 8, B = 9**\n        *   From `A + C = 15`, we get `8 + C = 15`, which means `C = 7`. This is a valid digit.\n        *   From `B + D + E + F = 29`, we get `9 + D + E + F = 29`, which means `D + E + F = 20`. This sum is possible with three distinct digits (e.g., 9+8+3, 9+7+4, 8+7+5). Since B is 9, D, E, F can't be 9. A valid combination like {8, 7, 5} is possible. This case is consistent so far.\n    *   **Case 2: A = 9, B = 8**\n        *   From `A + C = 15`, we get `9 + C = 15`, which means `C = 6`. This is a valid digit.\n        *   From `B + D + E + F = 29`, we get `8 + D + E + F = 29`, which means `D + E + F = 21`. This sum is possible with three distinct digits (e.g., 9+8+4, 9+7+5). Since B is 8, D, E, F can't be 8. A valid combination like {9, 7, 5} is possible. This case is also consistent so far.\n\n*   **Considering Potentially Flawed Clues:** It's worth noting that some other clues in the puzzle appear to be impossible as written (e.g., a sum of 28 for three cells, where the maximum is 9+8+7=24). However, the clues immediately surrounding the top two squares are self-consistent and lead to a clear conclusion for those specific cells. It is common in puzzle analysis to proceed with the logically sound portions, especially when they directly answer the question.\n\n**4. Final Answer Derivation**\nBased on the clue `A + B = 17`, the only two distinct digits from 1 to 9 that can occupy the top two squares are 8 and 9. This conclusion is supported by consistency checks with adjacent clues.\n\nThe two numbers are 8 and 9.\n\n8,9"
