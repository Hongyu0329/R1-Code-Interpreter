    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval from the provided graph.\n\n**1. Understand the Graph**\nThe image provided is a raster plot, which displays the firing activity of a population of neurons over time.\n*   **Y-axis (Electrode Number):** Represents individual electrodes (from 0 to 128) recording from different neurons or small groups of neurons.\n*   **X-axis (Time):** Represents the time elapsed in seconds (s), from 0 to 50 s.\n*   **Black Dots:** Each dot represents a single neuronal firing (an action potential) at a specific electrode at a specific time.\n\n**2. Identify Synchronized Bursts**\nA \"synchronized burst\" is characterized by a short period where a large number of electrodes show high firing activity. These appear as dense vertical bands on the raster plot. We need to identify the times at which these bursts occur. For consistency, we will use the center of each dense band as the timestamp for the burst.\n\n*   **Burst 1:** The first distinct burst is centered at approximately **t₁ = 3.5 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The second clear burst is centered at approximately **t₂ = 13.5 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** A third, less intense but still synchronized, burst is centered at approximately **t₃ = 18.5 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** A fourth, very strong burst is centered at approximately **t₄ = 35.5 s**.\n*   **Burst 5:** The last major burst in the recording is centered at approximately **t₅ = 48.5 s**.\n\nThe timestamps of the five identified synchronized bursts are approximately: 3.5 s, 13.5 s, 18.5 s, 35.5 s, and 48.5 s.\n\n**3. Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time difference between consecutive bursts. With five bursts, there are four intervals to calculate.\n\n*   **Interval 1:** Between Burst 1 and Burst 2:\n    IBI₁ = t₂ - t₁ = 13.5 s - 3.5 s = **10.0 s**\n*   **Interval 2:** Between Burst 2 and Burst 3:\n    IBI₂ = t₃ - t₂ = 18.5 s - 13.5 s = **5.0 s**\n*   **Interval 3:** Between Burst 3 and Burst 4:\n    IBI₃ = t₄ - t₃ = 35.5 s - 18.5 s = **17.0 s**\n*   **Interval 4:** Between Burst 4 and Burst 5:\n    IBI₄ = t₅ - t₄ = 48.5 s - 35.5 s = **13.0 s**\n\nThe calculated inter-burst intervals are 10.0 s, 5.0 s, 17.0 s, and 13.0 s.\n\n**4. Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average, we sum the intervals and divide by the number of intervals.\n\n*   **Sum of IBIs:** 10.0 + 5.0 + 17.0 + 13.0 = **45.0 s**\n*   **Number of intervals:** 4\n*   **Average IBI:** 45.0 s / 4 = **11.25 s**\n\n**5. Round the Result to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question asks for the final answer to be given to two significant figures.\n\n*   The value is 11.25.\n*   The first two significant digits are 1 and 1. The third digit is 2, which is less than 5, so we do not round up the second digit.\n*   Rounding 11.25 to two significant figures gives **11**.\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is 11 s.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Burst Identification:** The definition of a \"burst\" can be subjective. The analysis focuses on the most prominent and clearly synchronized events where a large portion of the electrodes are active simultaneously.\n*   **Timestamp Estimation:** The timestamps are estimated from the visual center of the burst activity. Minor variations in estimation are possible but do not significantly alter the final rounded result.\n*   **Significant Figures:** Adhering to the specified precision (two significant figures) is a critical part of the final answer.\n\n<<<11>>>"
