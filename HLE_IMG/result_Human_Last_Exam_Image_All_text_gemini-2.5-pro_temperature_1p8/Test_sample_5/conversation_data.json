    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observations:**\n    *   **Instrumentation:** The piece is written for solo piano, as indicated by the grand staff (treble and bass clefs joined together).\n    *   **Key Signature:** There is one sharp (F#) in the key signature. This suggests the key is either G Major or its relative minor, E minor. The first chord played in the left hand is a G major triad (G-B-D), strongly indicating the piece starts in G Major.\n    *   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4, also known as common time.\n    *   **Tempo:** The tempo marking is a metronome mark of quarter note = 80, which is a moderate tempo (Andante).\n\n2.  **Melodic and Harmonic Analysis (Measures 1-3):**\n    *   **Measures 1-2:** The piece begins quietly (dynamics marking `p` for *piano*). The right hand plays a simple, ascending and descending eighth-note melody: B-C-D-E-D-C-B. The left hand provides a simple accompaniment with a G major chord and then an arpeggiated figure outlining a C major chord.\n    *   **Measure 3:** There is a sudden and dramatic shift. The dynamic changes abruptly to `f` (*forte*, loud). The musical texture thickens considerably, with both hands playing rapid sixteenth-note broken chords. This creates a much more powerful and heroic sound compared to the gentle opening.\n\n3.  **Texture and Rhythmic Analysis:**\n    *   The primary characteristic of the piece after the introduction is the continuous use of sixteenth-note broken chords in both hands. This creates a sense of perpetual motion and epic scale.\n    *   We see this pattern continue through measures 4 and 5 (marked `mp`, *mezzo-piano*, or moderately soft), and again in measures 8 through 10 (marked `mf`, *mezzo-forte*, or moderately loud).\n\n4.  **Identifying Features and Context:**\n    *   The contrast between a simple, serene opening and a sudden, loud, and rhythmically dense main section is a hallmark of many epic themes, particularly in film scores and video game music.\n    *   The melody and the overall feel are very well-known in the world of video games. The opening melodic phrase is iconic.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the G major key, the memorable opening melody, and the subsequent transition to a grand, heroic theme driven by sixteenth-note arpeggios, the piece is identifiable as the **Main Theme of Final Fantasy VII**. The original composer is Nobuo Uematsu. This specific sheet music represents a popular piano arrangement of the theme.\n\n<<<Main Theme of Final Fantasy VII>>>"
