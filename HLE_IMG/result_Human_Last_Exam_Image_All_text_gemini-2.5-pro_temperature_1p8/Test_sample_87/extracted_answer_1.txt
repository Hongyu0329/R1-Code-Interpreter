**Product A:**
A complex pyrrole derivative with the molecular formula C14H20N2O3. Its structure results from the cycloaddition of a munchone intermediate with methyl propiolate, followed by elimination of CO2 and subsequent hydration of the pendant imine group to a carbinolamine [HC(OH)-NH].

**Product B:**
A bicyclic product with molecular formula C12H14N2O3. The structure contains the original pyrrolidine ring fused to a seven-membered ring formed by the Michael addition of the starting amine to methyl propiolate and subsequent intramolecular cyclization with elimination of methanol.

**Product C:**
1-acetyl-2-(4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid, with molecular formula C11H16N2O3. This is the simple N-acetylation product of the starting material.

**Structure A:**
```
[A complex pyrrole core (C14H18N2O2) with a methoxycarbonyl group, substituted with a 1-hydroxy-pyrrolidin-2-ylamino group]
Due to the complexity of the rearrangements, a definitive single drawing of the core is ambiguous without further experimental data, but the key features are a pyrrole ring and a hydrated imine substituent. A plausible core structure is a substituted dihydropyrrolizine.
```
A representative structure for A is a complex pyrrole, formed via a munchone pathway, where the substituent imine has been hydrated.

[Image of the bicyclic structure containing a pyrrolidine ring and a 7-membered anhydride-lactone ring fused at N1 and C2. The C2 carbon also bears the 4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl group.]
The structure contains a 7-membered ring: -N(pyrrolidine)-CH=CH-C(=O)-O-C(=O)- attached to C2 of the pyrrolidine ring.
```
**Structure C:**
```
[Image of 1-acetyl-2-(4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid.]
The structure consists of a pyrrolidine ring with an acetyl group on the nitrogen (N1), and both a carboxylic acid group and a 4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl group on the adjacent carbon (C2).

Here are the chemical drawings for the proposed structures:
**Product C:** A pyrrolidine ring where the nitrogen is acetylated (N-COCH3). At position 2, there is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a 4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl group.
**Product B:** A pyrrolidine ring where position 2 is substituted with a 4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl group. A seven-membered ring is fused to the pyrrolidine ring at positions N1 and C2, consisting of the chain -N1-CH=CH-C(=O)-O-C(=O)-C2-.
**Product A:** A complex substituted pyrrole ring formed from the rearrangement and cycloaddition pathway, with the 4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl substituent having been hydrated to a 1-hydroxy-pyrrolidine-2-ylamino group [C4H8N-NH-CH(OH)-...]. A plausible structure for the core (P4) is a substituted dihydropyrrolizine, which upon hydration of its substituent imine gives Product A.
