The main difference is the shape of the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight, causing the capsule to be erect and symmetrical. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is defined by its strongly curved (arcuate) seta, which causes the capsule to be bent over or nodding.
