    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe question asks for the primary, easily visible (\"at a glance\") difference in the sporophyte generation between the moss species *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. The sporophyte in mosses is the structure that produces spores, consisting mainly of a foot, a seta (stalk), and a capsule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Components of a Moss Sporophyte**\nTo find a difference, we need to consider the potential variations in the parts of the sporophyte:\n*   **Seta (Stalk):** Can vary in length (short, long) and shape (straight, curved, twisted).\n*   **Capsule:** Can vary in shape (spherical, ovoid, cylindrical), orientation (erect, inclined, nodding), and surface features (smooth, ribbed).\n*   **Position:** The entire sporophyte can be exserted (held far above the leaves), emergent (peeking out from the leaves), or immersed (hidden within the leaves). This is largely determined by the seta length.\n\n**Step 3: Investigate the Specifics of *Grimmia montana***\n*   Looking at botanical descriptions and floras, *Grimmia montana* is consistently described as having a **short, straight seta**.\n*   This straight seta holds the capsule in an erect and symmetrical position.\n*   Due to the short seta, the capsule is typically described as immersed or emergent, meaning it sits low among the leaves of the parent plant. The provided image, which shows upright, symmetrical capsules nestled in the leaves, is a good representation of this morphology.\n\n**Step 4: Investigate the Specifics of *Grimmia curviseta***\n*   The species name *curviseta* itself is a major clue. It is derived from Latin: *curvus* (curved) + *seta* (bristle, referring to the stalk).\n*   The defining characteristic of *Grimmia curviseta*'s sporophyte is its **distinctly curved or arcuate seta**.\n*   This curved seta causes the capsule to be inclined or nodding (cernuous) and often somewhat asymmetrical. It does not stand straight up but is bent over, almost like a shepherd's crook.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the Main Difference**\nBy comparing the characteristics of the two species, the most obvious and defining difference in their sporophytes is the shape of the seta.\n*   ***Grimmia montana***: Has a **straight seta**.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta***: Has a **curved seta**.\n\nThis difference in the stalk's shape directly affects the orientation of the capsule and is a reliable character for telling the two species apart when they are fertile. This is a feature easily seen with a hand lens, thus qualifying as a difference that can be noted \"at a glance\".\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   Both species have relatively short setae, so their capsules are immersed or emergent, not long-stalked. The key is not the length, but the shape.\n*   Relying on the gametophyte (the leafy green part) alone can be difficult, as many *Grimmia* species are superficially similar. The sporophyte provides a much clearer diagnostic feature in this case.\n*   The provided image shows capsules after the lid (operculum) has fallen off. The key difference (the seta) is at the base of these capsules, though it is somewhat obscured by the surrounding leaves in the photo. The erect nature of the capsules in the image strongly suggests they are on straight setae.\n\n<<<The main difference is the shape of the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight, causing the capsule to be erect and symmetrical. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is defined by its strongly curved (arcuate) seta, which causes the capsule to be bent over or nodding.>>>"
