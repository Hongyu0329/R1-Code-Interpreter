The high regioselectivity observed in Reaction 3 is due to the significant steric and electronic asymmetry in its bicyclic Münchnone intermediate, which is formed from N-acetylproline. In this intermediate, the C2 position bears a methyl group while the C4 position is a sterically hindered bridgehead carbon, making the two termini of the 1,3-dipole highly distinct. This forces the cycloaddition with the asymmetric alkyne to proceed through a single, highly preferred pathway, yielding a single regioisomer (Product B). Reactions 1 and 2 serve as a crucial control experiment. They show that when the Münchnone intermediate is formed from N-acetyl-N-methylalanine, the C2 and C4 positions are both substituted with methyl groups, making them sterically and electronically similar. As demonstrated by the 13C labeling experiment in Reaction 2, this similarity leads to a complete lack of regioselectivity in the cycloaddition step. Therefore, it is the structural difference in the Münchnone intermediate (asymmetric in Reaction 3 vs. nearly symmetric in Reactions 1 & 2) that accounts for the observed difference in regioselectivity.
