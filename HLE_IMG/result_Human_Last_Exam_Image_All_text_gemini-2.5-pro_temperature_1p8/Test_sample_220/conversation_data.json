    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct crystal lattice pattern.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Structure:**\n    An FCC crystal has atoms at each of the eight corners of a cubic unit cell and in the center of each of the six faces.\n\n2.  **Understand the Viewing Direction [110]:**\n    The notation [110] represents a direction in the crystal lattice. Viewing along the [110] direction means we are looking at a projection of the 3D atomic structure onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to this direction. This plane is the (110) crystallographic plane.\n\n3.  **Determine the Theoretical Pattern for FCC viewed along [110]:**\n    *   To visualize this, imagine a cubic unit cell. The [110] direction points along a face diagonal on the bottom (or top) face of the cube.\n    *   When we project the atoms onto a plane perpendicular to this direction, we need to see how the atoms from different layers along the viewing axis align.\n    *   The basis vectors for the projected 2D lattice are along the `[001]` and `[1 -1 0]` directions. These two directions are perpendicular to each other.\n    *   The projection of the FCC unit cell onto this plane forms a rectangle with side lengths of `a` and `aâˆš2`, where `a` is the lattice constant of the cube.\n    *   The atoms in the FCC structure project onto this plane in a specific pattern. The resulting 2D lattice has atoms at the four corners of this rectangle AND an atom exactly in the center of the rectangle. This pattern is known as a **centered rectangular lattice**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Option:**\n\n    *   **Image A:** This image shows a pattern of atoms forming a simple rectangle. You can define a rectangular unit cell with atoms at its corners (e.g., using the four atoms at coordinates roughly (2,6), (4.5,6), (4.5,9), (2,9)). However, there is no atom in the center of this rectangle. This pattern is a simple rectangular lattice, not a centered one.\n\n    *   **Image B:** This pattern shows a centered lattice, as there is an atom inside the parallelogram formed by four other atoms. However, the unit cell is a parallelogram, not a rectangle. The angles of the cell are not 90 degrees. This does not match the expected pattern.\n\n    *   **Image C:** This pattern displays clear hexagonal symmetry. You can trace hexagons formed by the atoms. This is the characteristic projection of an FCC lattice viewed along the [111] direction, not [110].\n\n    *   **Image D:** This image displays a pattern that fits the description of a centered rectangle. We can identify a rectangle formed by four corner atoms (e.g., at approx. (0.5, 6), (5.5, 6), (5.5, 12.5), (0.5, 12.5)). Importantly, there is an atom located at the center of this rectangle (approx. at (3, 9.25)). This arrangement perfectly matches the theoretical pattern for an FCC crystal viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Distinguish between structure and viewing direction:** The crystal is FCC, but its 2D projection changes depending on the viewing angle.\n*   **Identify the repeating unit cell:** In each pattern, find the smallest repeating shape (the unit cell).\n*   **Check the symmetry of the unit cell:** Determine if the unit cell is a square, rectangle, or general parallelogram.\n*   **Check for centering:** See if there are atoms at the center of the unit cell in addition to the corners.\n*   **FCC Projections:** Remember the key projections for FCC:\n    *   **[100] view:** A square pattern with atoms at the corners and the center.\n    *   **[110] view:** A **centered rectangular** pattern.\n    *   **[111] view:** A **hexagonal** pattern.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis, Image D is the only one that shows a centered rectangular lattice, which is the correct projection for a face-centered cubic structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
