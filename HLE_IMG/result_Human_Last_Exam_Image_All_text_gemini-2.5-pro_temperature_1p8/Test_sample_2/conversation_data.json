    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algorithm's Logic\n\nThe function `sort(a, n)` is a recursive function designed to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`. Let's break down its components:\n\n1.  **Base Case:** `if n > 1:`\n    *   The recursion stops when it's asked to sort a subarray of size 1 or 0, as such an array is already considered sorted. This is the base case.\n\n2.  **First Recursive Call:** `sort(a, n - 1)`\n    *   The algorithm first calls itself to sort the prefix of the array, i.e., the first `n-1` elements (`a[0]` to `a[n-2]`). Let's assume this call successfully sorts this prefix.\n\n3.  **Comparison and Swap:** `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]: swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`\n    *   After the first recursive call, `a[n-2]` should be the largest element in the sorted prefix `a[0...n-2]`.\n    *   The algorithm then compares the last element of the current problem, `a[n-1]`, with this largest element of the prefix.\n    *   If `a[n-1]` is smaller, it means it is out of place and needs to be moved into the prefix. The code performs a swap with `a[n-2]`.\n\n4.  **Second Recursive Call:** `sort(a, n - 1)`\n    *   This is the most critical part of the algorithm. This second call to `sort(a, n - 1)` is made *only if the swap happened*.\n    *   The swap might have disrupted the sorted order of the prefix `a[0...n-2]` (because the original `a[n-1]` is now at position `n-2`).\n    *   Therefore, the algorithm calls `sort(a, n - 1)` again to re-sort the entire prefix.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe worst-case complexity occurs when the algorithm performs the maximum amount of work. The most work is done when the condition `a[n-1] < a[n-2]` is true, as this triggers the expensive second recursive call. We need an input array that consistently triggers this condition at each level of the recursion.\n\nConsider an array sorted in reverse order, for example, `a = [4, 3, 2, 1]` with `n = 4`.\n*   **`sort(a, 4)` is called.**\n    1.  It calls `sort(a, 3)`. Recursively, this call will sort the prefix `[4, 3, 2]` into `[2, 3, 4]`. So the array `a` becomes `[2, 3, 4, 1]`.\n    2.  Now back in the `sort(a, 4)` frame, it checks `if a[3] < a[2]`, which is `if 1 < 4`. This is true.\n    3.  It swaps `a[3]` and `a[2]`. The array becomes `[2, 3, 1, 4]`.\n    4.  It makes the second recursive call: `sort(a, 3)` on the now-disturbed prefix. This call will sort `[2, 3, 1]` into `[1, 2, 3]`, resulting in the final sorted array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.\n\nAs we can see, a reverse-sorted array forces the `if` condition to be true at every step of the main recursion, thus triggering both recursive calls. This is our worst-case scenario.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate and Solve the Recurrence Relation\n\nLet `T(n)` be the time taken by `sort(a, n)` in the worst case.\n1.  The first call `sort(a, n - 1)` takes `T(n-1)` time.\n2.  The `if` condition and the `swap` take constant time, which is `O(1)`.\n3.  The second call `sort(a, n - 1)` (which is executed in the worst case) also takes `T(n-1)` time.\n\nThis gives us the following recurrence relation for the worst case:\n`T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + O(1)`\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant)\n\nThis is a well-known recurrence relation. Let's solve it by expansion:\n*   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n*   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n*   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n*   ...\n*   After `k` steps: `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n\nThe geometric series sum is `(2^k - 1)`. So:\n`T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^k - 1)`\n\nThe recursion stops when `n-k = 1` (our base case), which means `k = n-1`. Substituting `k`:\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n\nSince `T(1)` is a constant, the entire expression is dominated by the `2^(n-1)` term.\n`T(n)` is proportional to `2^(n-1)`, which is `O(2^n)`.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe time complexity of the algorithm grows exponentially with the size of the input `n`. This is because for each problem of size `n`, it creates two subproblems of size `n-1`. This is characteristic of an `O(2^n)` algorithm, similar to the recursive solution for the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.\n\nComparing with the answer choices:\n*   A. O(n) - Incorrect (this is the best case, for an already sorted array).\n*   B. O(n log n) - Incorrect.\n*   C. O(n^2) - Incorrect.\n*   D. O(n^3) - Incorrect.\n*   E. O(2^n) - Correct.\n*   F. does not terminate - Incorrect, as `n` decreases with each call.\n\n<<<E>>>"
