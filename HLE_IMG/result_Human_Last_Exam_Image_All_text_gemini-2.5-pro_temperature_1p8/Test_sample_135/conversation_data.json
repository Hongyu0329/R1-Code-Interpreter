    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Content:** The image shows a monochrome photograph of a sculptural relief set within a circular frame (a tondo or roundel). The scene is religious, depicting a priest administering a sacrament, likely the Eucharist (Communion), to a group of kneeling figures, including a child. The figures are rendered in a classical, naturalistic style typical of the Italian Renaissance.\n2.  **Examine the Inscription:** At the bottom of the roundel, there is a small plaque or cartouche with an inscription. The zoomed-in images help to decipher it. It reads \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This is an old form of Italian, which translates to \"Sacramento dell'Altare\" or \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" a clear reference to the Eucharist.\n3.  **Identify the Artistic Style and Medium:** The style of the low relief (rilievo schiacciato), the serene piety of the figures, and the overall composition are strong indicators of the Florentine school of sculpture from the 15th century. Specifically, this style is the hallmark of the Della Robbia family workshop, which specialized in glazed terracotta reliefs. The smooth finish and gentle modeling are characteristic of their work.\n4.  **Connect the Artwork to a Specific Artist and Work:** By searching for artworks matching the description (\"Della Robbia,\" \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" \"Eucharist tondo\"), we can identify the specific piece. This roundel is a detail from the predella (the base section) of a large altarpiece. The altarpiece is the \"Altarpiece of the Holy Sacrament\" located in the Cathedral of Arezzo, Italy (Cattedrale dei Santi Pietro e Donato). The predella of this work contains seven tondi, each representing one of the Seven Sacraments. The one in the image is the representation of the Eucharist.\n5.  **Confirm the Author:** Art historical sources universally attribute the Arezzo Cathedral Altarpiece of the Holy Sacrament, created circa 1485-1486, to Andrea della Robbia. He was a master of the Della Robbia workshop, renowned for developing and popularizing the glazed terracotta technique.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Inscription:** The inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\" is the most critical clue for identifying the specific scene and linking it to known artworks.\n*   **Style:** Recognizing the distinct Della Robbia style is key to narrowing down the potential artists from the vast number of Renaissance sculptors.\n*   **Context (Predella):** Understanding that such small reliefs were often part of a larger structure like an altarpiece predella helps in the search and identification process. The question correctly identifies the piece as a \"detail of the Altarpiece\".\n*   **Artist:** While the Della Robbia family had several prominent artists (Luca, Andrea, Giovanni), the specific style and the known provenance of the Arezzo altarpiece point definitively to Andrea della Robbia.\n\nBy combining these points of analysis, we can confidently identify the author of the artwork.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
