[[ Representations of A and B ]]]
**Compound A:** A benzene ring is connected to a CH group. The same CH group is also bonded to a hydrogen atom, a CH₂ group, and a benzoate group (-O-C(=O)-Ph). The CH₂ group is bonded to a tert-butoxy group (-O-C(CH₃)₃). This is 2-(tert-butoxy)-1-phenylethyl benzoate.
**Compound B:** A benzene ring is connected to a CH₂ group, which is in turn connected to an aldehyde group (-CHO). This is phenylacetaldehyde.
