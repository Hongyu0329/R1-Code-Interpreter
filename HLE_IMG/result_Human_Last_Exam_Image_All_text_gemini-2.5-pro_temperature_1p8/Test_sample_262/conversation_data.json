    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the general structure of the complexes.**\n    All four complexes are cationic iridium(III) complexes with a general formula of `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+PF6-`. They function as phosphorescent emitters. The central metal is iridium(III). They all have one bidentate diimine ligand (N^N), which is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. This ancillary ligand is the same in all four complexes. They also have two cyclometalating phenylpyridine-type ligands (C^N), which coordinate to the iridium center through a carbon-iridium bond and a nitrogen-iridium bond. The lifetime of these emitters in devices is strongly linked to their chemical, electrochemical, and photochemical stability.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the differences between the four complexes.**\n    The differences between the four complexes arise from two factors:\n    1.  **The substitution pattern on the C^N ligands:**\n        *   Complexes 1 and 2 use 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (often abbreviated as `dfppy`). This ligand has two fluorine substituents on the phenyl ring.\n        *   Complexes 3 and 4 use 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine (often abbreviated as `fppy`). This ligand has only one fluorine substituent on the phenyl ring.\n    2.  **The geometric isomerism:** In an octahedral complex with two identical unsymmetrical bidentate ligands (like the C^N ligands here) and one symmetric bidentate ligand, different isomers are possible. The key difference here is the relative arrangement of the nitrogen atoms from the two C^N ligands.\n        *   In **Complexes 1 and 3**, the two nitrogen atoms of the C^N ligands are arranged *trans* to each other across the iridium center.\n        *   In **Complexes 2 and 4**, the two nitrogen atoms of the C^N ligands are arranged *cis* to each other.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the effect of ligand substitution on stability.**\n    Fluorine atoms are strongly electron-withdrawing. Adding them to the C^N ligand lowers the energy of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO). A lower HOMO makes the complex more difficult to oxidize, which generally leads to higher electrochemical stability and longer device lifetimes. The `dfppy` ligand in complexes 1 and 2 has an additional fluorine atom compared to the `fppy` ligand in complexes 3 and 4. Therefore, from an electronic standpoint, complexes 1 and 2 should be more stable against oxidation than complexes 3 and 4. This would suggest that complexes 3 and 4 might have shorter lifetimes.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the effect of geometric isomerism on stability.**\n    The stability of the geometric isomers is dictated by thermodynamic and kinetic factors, strongly influenced by the *trans* effect/influence. The cyclometalating carbon atom (a carbanion donor) has a very strong *trans* influence, meaning it weakens the bond of the ligand positioned *trans* to it. Nitrogen donors (like in pyridine or bipyridine) have a moderate *trans* influence.\n    *   In the ***cis*-N,N isomers (Complexes 2 and 4)**, the coordination sphere has a more balanced distribution of *trans* influences. For example, a strong C donor is trans to a moderate N donor. This configuration is generally found to be the thermodynamically more stable product.\n    *   In the ***trans*-N,N isomers (Complexes 1 and 3)**, the two nitrogen atoms of the C^N ligands are trans to each other. This results in an arrangement where two moderately trans-influencing ligands are opposite each other, and the two strongly trans-influencing carbon atoms are trans to the nitrogen atoms of the bipyridine ligand. This arrangement is well-documented in the literature to be thermodynamically less stable than the *cis*-N,N isomer.\n    A thermodynamically less stable complex is more prone to degradation or isomerization under the electrical and thermal stress of device operation. This provides a significant non-radiative decay pathway and shortens the operational lifetime of the device.\n\n*   **Step 5: Combine the factors and make a conclusion.**\n    We have two factors that lead to instability:\n    1.  Less fluorination (fppy ligand in 3 and 4)\n    2.  *trans*-N,N geometry (in 1 and 3)\n    The question asks which complexes are expected to show *shorter* lifetimes. This corresponds to the less stable complexes. The geometric instability of the *trans*-isomer is often a dominant degradation pathway, leading to significantly shorter lifetimes compared to the *cis*-isomer. This effect is typically more pronounced than the stabilization provided by an additional fluorine atom. Therefore, the complexes with the less stable *trans*-N,N geometry are the primary candidates for shorter lifetimes. Both Complex 1 and Complex 3 possess this unstable *trans* geometry.\n\n*   **Final Answer Derivation:**\n    - Complex 1: *trans* isomer (less stable) with `dfppy` ligand (more stable electronically).\n    - Complex 2: *cis* isomer (more stable) with `dfppy` ligand (more stable electronically). -> Expected longest lifetime.\n    - Complex 3: *trans* isomer (less stable) with `fppy` ligand (less stable electronically). -> Expected shortest lifetime.\n    - Complex 4: *cis* isomer (more stable) with `fppy` ligand (less stable electronically).\n    Both *trans* isomers, 1 and 3, are expected to be significantly less stable than their *cis* counterparts (2 and 4) due to their geometry. This geometric instability is a key determinant of short device lifetime. Thus, both Complex 1 and Complex 3 are expected to show shorter lifetimes.\n\n<<<F>>>"
