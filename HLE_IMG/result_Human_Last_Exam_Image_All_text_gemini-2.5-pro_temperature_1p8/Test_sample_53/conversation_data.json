    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Observe the main elements:** The image is a photograph of an ancient Greek red-figure vase painting. It depicts a dramatic scene involving a chariot and several figures.\n    2.  **Identify the figures in the chariot:** There are two primary figures inside the chariot. The figure driving wears a distinctive patterned sleeve and a soft, pointed cap known as a Phrygian cap. In Greek art, this attire was used to denote non-Greeks, particularly people from the East (like Trojans, Phrygians, or Amazons). The driver is gesturing forward. The other figure in the chariot is less distinct, mostly covered by drapery. A large wing extends from the side/top of the scene, suggesting the chariot is capable of flight.\n    3.  **Identify the figure on the ground:** A nude male figure is depicted in a contorted pose on the ground, seemingly falling out of or being cast from the chariot. His body language suggests he is dead or dying.\n    4.  **Interpret the scene based on Greek mythology:** The combination of a female figure in \"oriental\" dress, a magical winged chariot, and dead or dying children is highly characteristic of the myth of Medea. Medea, a sorceress from Colchis (an eastern kingdom), takes revenge on her husband Jason after he abandons her for a Corinthian princess. Her revenge culminates in the murder of their two sons. She then escapes from Corinth in a winged chariot sent by her grandfather, the sun god Helios.\n    5.  **Connect the figures to the myth:**\n        *   The driver in the Phrygian cap is Medea.\n        *   The winged chariot is the one gifted to her by Helios.\n        *   The nude male figure falling to the ground is one of her sons whom she has just murdered. The other figure in the chariot is likely the body of her second son.\n    6.  **Answer the specific question:** The question asks, \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\". In this dynamic composition, the figure actively \"leaving\" the chariot is the boy who is tumbling out of it and falling to the ground.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   It is important to correctly identify the iconography. The Phrygian cap on the charioteer is a key clue pointing to Medea.\n    *   The winged chariot is another crucial element that helps identify the myth as Medea's escape, rather than other chariot scenes like the abduction of Persephone or a scene from the Trojan War.\n    *   The term \"leaving the chariot\" is best interpreted in this context as the figure being ejected or falling from it, not simply dismounting. The figure on the ground fits this description perfectly.\n    *   The vase is a well-known Apulian calyx-krater from around 330-310 BC, attributed to the Underworld Painter. Its subject matter is confirmed by art historians as Medea's tragic revenge.\n\nTherefore, the figure leaving the chariot is one of the sons of Medea.\n\n<<<One of the sons of Medea>>>"
