    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final products.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Materials and Reaction Type**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** A substituted cyclobutene. Let's analyze its structure carefully. It's a four-membered ring with a double bond. Let's number the carbons starting from the top-left of the ring as C1 and going clockwise: C1(sp2)-C2(sp3)-C3(sp3)-C4(sp2). The double bond is between C1 and C4. Let's use IUPAC numbering to be unambiguous. Numbering the double bond C1-C2 gives substituents at C3 and C4. Let's assign C1 as the top-left carbon and C2 as the bottom-left. Then C1=C2, C3 is the bottom-right, C4 is the top-right.\n    *   The MeO group is on C2.\n    *   The C4 carbon has a methyl (Me) group with a wedge bond (pointing out) and a methoxy (OMe) group with a dash bond (pointing in).\n    *   C3 is a CH2 group.\n    *   The structure is (4S)-2-methoxy-4-methoxy-4-methylcyclobut-1-ene (assuming standard stereochemical assignments). The key information is the relative stereochemistry at C4 (Me is out, OMe is in).\n*   **Reactant 2:** Ethyl acrylate (CH2=CH-CO2Et), which is a dienophile.\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** Heat (Δ).\n*   **Reaction Sequence:** The problem explicitly states this involves a 4π electrocyclic ring opening followed by a Diels-Alder cycloaddition. The Diels-Alder reaction is specified to proceed in an *endo* fashion.\n\n**Step 2: 4π Electrocyclic Ring Opening**\n\n*   The reaction is a thermal ring opening of a cyclobutene, which is a 4π electron system. According to Woodward-Hoffmann rules, this reaction proceeds via a **conrotatory** motion.\n*   The C3-C4 sigma bond breaks. The atoms C1, C2, C3, and C4, which formed the ring, now form an open-chain conjugated diene. The connectivity will be C4-C1-C2-C3, and the new double bonds will be C4=C1 and C2=C3.\n*   Let's determine the structure of the resulting diene.\n    *   Diene skeleton: C4(R1,R2)=C1(H)-C2(OMe)=C3(H2).\n    *   Substituting the groups: C(Me,OMe)=CH-C(OMe)=CH2.\n    *   This is 2-methoxy-4-methoxy-4-methyl-1,3-butadiene.\n*   **Stereochemistry of the Diene:** The conrotatory ring opening of the chiral cyclobutene can proceed in two different ways, leading to two diastereomeric dienes. These dienes will differ in the geometry (E/Z) of the newly formed C4=C1 double bond.\n    *   Let's analyze the groups at the rotating termini (C3 and C4). At C4, we have Me (out) and OMe (in). At C3, we have two H atoms.\n    *   **Diene-E (D-E):** Let's call the E-isomer of the C1=C4 double bond D-E. This corresponds to the high-priority group on C4 (OMe) being *trans* to the high-priority group on C1 (the rest of the diene chain, -C(OMe)=CH2).\n    *   **Diene-Z (D-Z):** The Z-isomer has the OMe on C4 being *cis* to the rest of the chain.\n    *   Both dienes will be formed and can participate in the subsequent Diels-Alder reaction. We are looking for two products, which likely arise one from each of these diastereomeric dienes.\n\n**Step 3: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n\n*   **Diene:** A mix of (E)- and (Z)-2-methoxy-4-methoxy-4-methyl-1,3-butadiene.\n*   **Dienophile:** Ethyl acrylate (CH2=CH-CO2Et).\n*   **Regiochemistry:** We must determine how the diene and dienophile align. This is controlled by electronic effects (Frontier Molecular Orbital theory).\n    *   The diene is electron-rich due to the two MeO groups and one Me group (all electron-donating).\n    *   The dienophile is electron-poor due to the CO2Et group (electron-withdrawing).\n    *   Analysis of partial charges or HOMO/LUMO coefficients predicts the major regioisomer. The most nucleophilic positions on the diene are C1 (CH2) and C3 (-CH=), and the most electrophilic position on the dienophile is Cα (-CH(CO2Et)). A detailed analysis shows that the \"meta\" adduct is expected.\n    *   The \"meta\" adduct forms by creating bonds between C1 of the diene and Cα of the dienophile, and C4 of the diene and Cβ of the dienophile. Let's verify the connectivity in the options. Products A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H all share the same connectivity, which matches this \"meta\" regiochemistry: C(Me,OMe) is bonded to C(=CH) and a CH2 group.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The problem states the reaction is **endo**. The *endo rule* means that the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (CO2Et) is oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the \"inner\" substituents of the s-cis diene conformation during the transition state.\n\n**Step 4: Determining the Products**\n\nWe need to consider the endo Diels-Alder for both D-E and D-Z.\n\n1.  **Reaction of Diene-E (D-E):**\n    *   In the s-cis conformation of the E-diene, the Me group on C4 is \"in\" and the OMe group on C4 is \"out\".\n    *   According to the endo rule, the CO2Et group will be *cis* to the \"in\" substituent (Me).\n    *   So, the product from D-E will have the Me group on the quaternary carbon and the CO2Et group *cis* to each other.\n    *   Let's check the options. The stereocenter from the starting material (C4, with Me(w)/OMe(d)) is preserved. So we look for products with C1 having Me(w)/OMe(d). This restricts our choices to {A, C, E, G}.\n    *   Which of these has Me *cis* to CO2Et?\n        *   **C:** C1 has Me(w)/OMe(d). C5 has CO2Et(w). Me(w) and CO2Et(w) are *cis*. This matches.\n        *   **G:** This is identical to C.\n    *   So, product **C** is formed from the D-E intermediate.\n\n2.  **Reaction of Diene-Z (D-Z):**\n    *   In the s-cis conformation of the Z-diene, the OMe group on C4 is \"in\" and the Me group on C4 is \"out\".\n    *   According to the endo rule, the CO2Et group will be *cis* to the \"in\" substituent (OMe).\n    *   So, the product from D-Z will have the OMe group on the quaternary carbon and the CO2Et group *cis* to each other.\n    *   Let's check the options from the set {A, C, E, G} again.\n        *   **A:** C1 has Me(w)/OMe(d). C5 has CO2Et(d). OMe(d) and CO2Et(d) are *cis*. This matches.\n    *   So, product **A** is formed from the D-Z intermediate.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction proceeds through a 4π electrocyclic ring opening to give two diastereomeric dienes (E and Z isomers). Each of these dienes then undergoes an endo Diels-Alder reaction with ethyl acrylate with \"meta\" regioselectivity. The initial stereocenter with Me(wedge)/OMe(dash) is preserved in the products.\n\n*   The E-diene leads to product **C**, where the Me and CO2Et groups are cis.\n*   The Z-diene leads to product **A**, where the OMe and CO2Et groups are cis.\n\nTherefore, the two products are A and C.\n\n<<<A and C>>>"
