    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling pattern shown in the image. Rotational symmetry of order 'n' (or n-fold) means that rotating the pattern by 360/n degrees around a central point leaves the pattern looking identical.\n\n2.  **Visual Inspection of the Tiling:** The tiling is a complex, repeating pattern made of polygons of different shapes and colors. We can identify the primary shapes:\n    *   Dark blue polygons that are heptagons (7-sided).\n    *   Light yellow polygons that are squares (4-sided).\n    *   Orange polygons that are rhombuses (a type of 4-sided parallelogram).\n\n3.  **Search for a Center of Rotation:** To find the rotational symmetry, we need to locate a point in the pattern that can serve as a center of rotation. We can test different types of points:\n    *   The center of a polygon.\n    *   A vertex where multiple polygons meet.\n    *   The midpoint of an edge.\n\n4.  **Analyzing a Prominent Motif:** The most prominent features in the pattern are the star-like motifs. Let's focus on the one that appears to be at the very center of the image patch.\n    *   This star motif is formed around a central point where the sharp corners of seven orange rhombuses meet.\n    *   Radiating out from this central point are seven \"arms\". Each arm is composed of an orange rhombus and a light yellow square.\n    *   This arrangement of seven identical arms strongly suggests a 7-fold symmetry.\n\n5.  **Testing the 7-fold Symmetry:** Let's mentally rotate the pattern around the center of this star motif.\n    *   A rotation of 360/7 degrees (approximately 51.4 degrees) will move the first arm of the star into the exact position and orientation of the second arm.\n    *   Simultaneously, the second arm moves to the position of the third, and so on, with the seventh arm moving to the position of the first.\n    *   This rotation also maps the surrounding tiles onto identical tiles. For instance, the ring of blue heptagons surrounding the central star will also rotate, with each heptagon landing precisely on the spot of its neighbor.\n    *   Since a rotation by 360/7 degrees leaves the entire pattern unchanged, the tiling possesses 7-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n6.  **Considering Other Symmetries (and the Crystallographic Restriction Theorem):**\n    *   In standard Euclidean periodic tilings (like a chessboard or honeycomb pattern), only 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold rotational symmetries are possible.\n    *   The presence of 7-sided polygons (heptagons) and the observed 7-fold symmetry indicates that this is not a standard Euclidean periodic tiling. It is, in fact, a representation (specifically, a Poincar√© disk projection) of a tiling on the hyperbolic plane, where such symmetries are possible.\n    *   While there might be other points in the pattern with lower-order symmetry (e.g., 2-fold symmetry at the midpoint of the edge between two blue heptagons), the question \"what is the rotational symmetry\" typically refers to the highest or most characteristic order of symmetry present in the pattern.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The most defining and highest order of rotational symmetry present in the tiling is 7-fold, centered on the star-like motifs.\n\n<<<7-fold>>>"
