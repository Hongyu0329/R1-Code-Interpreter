    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the duration of the longest interval between two consecutive R-waves (the R-R interval) on the provided ECG rhythm strip.\n2.  **Identify ECG Parameters:** The strip has standard parameters written at the top left:\n    *   **Paper Speed:** 25 mm/sec. This is the most crucial piece of information for time-based measurements.\n    *   **Calibration:** 1 cm/mV (or 10 mm/mV). This relates to voltage/amplitude and is not needed for measuring time intervals.\n3.  **Establish Time Conversion:** Based on the paper speed of 25 mm/sec, we can determine the time duration represented by the grid lines:\n    *   Each small square is 1 mm wide. Time = 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = **0.04 seconds**.\n    *   Each large square consists of 5 small squares, so it is 5 mm wide. Time = 5 mm / 25 mm/sec = **0.20 seconds**.\n4.  **Visually Scan the ECG Strip:** The entire ECG recording needs to be scanned to identify the longest pause between heartbeats. The rhythm is mostly regular, but a significant pause is clearly visible on the fourth line of the tracing (which begins around the timestamp 0:06:08).\n5.  **Locate and Measure the Longest Interval:**\n    *   The longest R-R interval occurs on the fourth line of the rhythm strip. It's the gap between the 5th and 6th QRS complex on that specific line.\n    *   To measure this interval, we count the number of squares between the peak of the R-wave before the pause and the peak of the R-wave after the pause.\n    *   Let's align the peaks with the grid. The R-wave before the pause aligns perfectly with a thick vertical grid line. The R-wave after the pause also aligns perfectly with another thick vertical grid line.\n    *   Counting the number of large squares between these two R-wave peaks, we find there are exactly **7 large squares**.\n6.  **Calculate the Duration in Seconds:** Now, we convert the measured distance (in large squares) into time (in seconds).\n    *   Duration = (Number of large squares) × (Time per large square)\n    *   Duration = 7 large squares × 0.20 seconds/large square\n    *   Duration = **1.4 seconds**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Confirm Paper Speed:** Always verify the paper speed (25 mm/sec is standard, but 50 mm/sec is also used). An incorrect assumption would double or halve the result.\n*   **Identify R-waves Correctly:** The R-wave is typically the tallest sharp upward spike of the QRS complex. Be consistent with the measurement point (e.g., peak to peak).\n*   **Scan the Entire Strip:** The longest interval may not be obvious at first glance. It's important to look over the entire recording. In this case, the pause is very prominent.\n*   **Use Grid Lines for Accuracy:** Using the grid lines, especially the large ones, allows for a more accurate measurement than estimating by eye alone. The alignment of the R-waves with the heavy grid lines in this specific instance makes the measurement straightforward and precise.\n*   **Distinguish Artifacts:** Note the artifact at the beginning of the strip. This section should be ignored for rhythm analysis.\n\nBy following these steps, the longest R-R interval is determined to be 1.4 seconds.\n\n<<<1.4>>>"
