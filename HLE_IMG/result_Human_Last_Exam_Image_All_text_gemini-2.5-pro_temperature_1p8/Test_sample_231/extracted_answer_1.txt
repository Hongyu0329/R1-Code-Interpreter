The final product, C, is the iodide salt of the 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxy-9-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)xanthenylium cation. This is formed by the elimination of diethylamine from B to regenerate A, followed by the complete demethylation of all seven methoxy groups of A by the lithium iodide reagent. The structure is as follows: a dibenzo[c,h]xanthenylium core substituted with hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, 6, and 8, and a 2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl group attached at position 9.
