The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **V domain** of the RAGE receptor. Based on the information provided, S100B should be considered a **prognostic marker**. This is because its signaling pathway is directly linked to the downstream events that determine the severity and progression of neurological disorders, such as neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Consequently, measuring the levels of S100B could provide crucial information about the expected course and outcome of the pathology, which is the definition of a prognostic marker.
