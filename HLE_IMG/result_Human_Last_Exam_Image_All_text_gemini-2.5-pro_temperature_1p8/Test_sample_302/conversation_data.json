    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the characters on the seal:\n\n1.  **Seal Type and Reading Order:** This is a square Chinese seal with four characters carved in an ancient script, likely Seal Script (篆书, zhuànshū). The standard reading order for such seals is from top to bottom, and right to left. So, we read the character in the top-right corner first, then the top-left, then the bottom-right, and finally the bottom-left.\n\n2.  **Character Identification (in reading order):**\n\n    *   **Top-Right Character:** This character is a pictograph of a horse. It has a stylized mane at the top, a body, and four legs at the bottom. This is the ancient form of the character `馬` (mǎ), which means \"horse\".\n\n    *   **Top-Left Character:** This character is a simple, symmetrical glyph. It is the classic seal script form for `不` (bù), which means \"not\".\n\n    *   **Bottom-Right Character:** This character has an outer enclosure radical `囗` (wéi). Inside is a complex component. This is the ancient form of `圖` (tú), which means \"drawing,\" \"picture,\" or \"map.\" The inner part is the phonetic-semantic component `啚` (bǐ).\n\n    *   **Bottom-Left Character:** This character has a clear component at the top representing a hand holding a brush, which is the radical `聿` (yù). Below it is a component resembling a mouth, `曰` (yuē). This combination forms the character `書` (shū), meaning \"book\" or \"to write.\"\n\n3.  **Putting it all together:** Reading the characters in the correct order (top-right, top-left, bottom-right, bottom-left), we get the phrase: `馬不圖書` (mǎ bù tú shū).\n\n4.  **Conversion to Simplified Chinese:**\n    *   `馬` simplifies to `马`.\n    *   `不` remains `不`.\n    *   `圖` simplifies to `图`.\n    *   `書` simplifies to `书`.\n\n5.  **Final Phrase:** The character content on the seal, in simplified Chinese, is **马不图书**. This phrase could be interpreted as a motto, possibly meaning \"[I am a man of] action (like a horse), not one for scholarly pursuits (books and pictures)\".\n\n<<<马不图书>>>"
