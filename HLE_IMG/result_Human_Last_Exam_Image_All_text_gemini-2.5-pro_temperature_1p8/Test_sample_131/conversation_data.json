    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the name of the given alkaloid compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Basic Structural Features**\nThe provided chemical structure is a complex organic molecule. We can identify several key features:\n*   **Polycyclic System:** The molecule is composed of multiple fused rings. Specifically, it has four fused six-membered rings.\n*   **Heteroatoms:** The molecule contains two nitrogen (N) atoms and one oxygen (O) atom, making it a heterocyclic compound. The presence of nitrogen in a complex, naturally-derived structure strongly suggests it is an alkaloid.\n*   **Functional Groups:** There is a carbonyl group (C=O). This carbonyl group is adjacent to a nitrogen atom within a ring, which defines it as a lactam (a cyclic amide).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Core Skeleton**\nThe tetracyclic (four-ring) framework containing two nitrogen atoms is a known scaffold in alkaloid chemistry. This specific arrangement is characteristic of the quinolizidine alkaloids, particularly the lupin alkaloids. The parent structure of this family, without the carbonyl group, is called sparteine.\n\n**Step 3: Compare with Known Lupin Alkaloids**\nLet's compare the given structure to known lupin alkaloids based on the presence of the lactam group:\n*   **Sparteine:** This is the parent tetracyclic amine with no oxygen atoms. Our molecule has a C=O group, so it is not sparteine.\n*   **Lupanine:** This is a major lupin alkaloid. It is an oxidized derivative of sparteine, containing a lactam group. The structure of lupanine perfectly matches the skeleton and the position of the carbonyl group in the provided image.\n*   **Matrine:** This is another alkaloid with the same molecular formula as lupanine (C₁₅H₂₄N₂O) and a similar tetracyclic lactam structure. However, in matrine, the ring connectivity and the position of the lactam group are different. In the given structure, the lactam is part of the quinolizidine system. In matrine, it is in a different ring. Therefore, the compound is not matrine.\n\n**Step 4: Consider the Stereochemistry**\nThe drawing uses wedges and dashes to indicate a specific three-dimensional arrangement (stereochemistry) of the atoms. The molecule has four chiral centers. The specific stereoisomer shown is the most common naturally occurring form, known as (-)-lupanine. In general chemical nomenclature, when an enantiomer is not specified, \"lupanine\" usually refers to this most abundant natural isomer.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the tetracyclic quinolizidine lactam framework and the specific stereochemistry shown, the compound is identified as lupanine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
