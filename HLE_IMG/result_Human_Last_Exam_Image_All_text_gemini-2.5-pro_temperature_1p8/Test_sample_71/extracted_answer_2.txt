The structure for compound A is:
A central carbon atom is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH) and to three 2-methoxyphenyl groups.
A 2-methoxyphenyl group consists of a benzene ring where the substituent is a methoxy group (-OCHâ‚ƒ) at the ortho position relative to the point of attachment to the central carbon.

```
[chemical structure]
A benzene ring is attached to a central carbon atom. An OCH3 group is attached to the benzene ring at the ortho position. This 2-methoxyphenyl group is repeated three times around the central carbon atom. The central carbon atom is also attached to an OH group. The overall chemical structure is tris(2-methoxyphenyl)methanol.
```
This is the structure of Tris(2-methoxyphenyl)methanol:
```
      OH
      |
(C6H4-2-OCH3)---C---(C6H4-2-OCH3)
      |
    (C6H4-2-OCH3)
```
Let me draw the structure out explicitly:
A central Carbon atom (C) is singly bonded to:
1.  A Hydroxyl group (-OH).
2.  A 2-methoxyphenyl group.
3.  A second 2-methoxyphenyl group.
4.  A third 2-methoxyphenyl group.
The skeletal structure looks like a central carbon with four single bonds. One bond goes to an OH. The other three bonds each go to a benzene ring. On each benzene ring, a methoxy (-OCH3) group is attached to the carbon adjacent to the carbon that is bonded to the central carbon.
