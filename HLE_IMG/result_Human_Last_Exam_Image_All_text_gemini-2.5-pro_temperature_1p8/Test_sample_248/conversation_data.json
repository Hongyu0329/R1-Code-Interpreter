    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the organisms in the image:** The photograph shows a rocky intertidal zone environment teeming with life. We can clearly distinguish several types of invertebrates:\n    *   **Acorn Barnacles:** Numerous small, conical, sessile crustaceans attached to the rock. These are common in intertidal zones worldwide, and it's difficult to identify them to a species level that would be geographically exclusive from this photo alone.\n    *   **Large Gastropod Snails:** There are two prominent snails with lighter-colored shells. The upper one has faint brownish spiral bands, while the lower one is more uniformly off-white. These could be whelks or a species of periwinkle.\n    *   **Small Gastropod Snails:** There are several smaller, dark-colored snails with ribbed shells. These are a key feature of the image.\n    *   **Tiny Organisms:** The rock surface between the larger animals is covered with very small, grayish, bead-like organisms, which are likely the juvenile form of one of the snail species present, most probably the small, dark snails.\n\n2.  **Determine which species has a geographically restricted range:** The question asks for a species that *definitively* indicates the photo was taken on the Atlantic rather than the Pacific Coast (of North America). This requires identifying a species that lives on the Atlantic Coast but is absent from the Pacific Coast.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the candidate species:**\n    *   **Barnacles:** While different species of barnacles dominate the Atlantic (*Semibalanus balanoides*) vs. the Pacific (*Balanus glandula*, *Chthamalus dalli*), they can be hard to distinguish visually without close examination of their shell plates. Thus, they are not the most definitive indicator from this photo.\n    *   **Large Snails:** The larger snails could potentially be the Atlantic Dogwhelk, *Nucella lapillus*. This species *is* exclusive to the North Atlantic and would be a valid answer. However, the identification is not as certain as for the smaller snails.\n    *   **Small, Dark Snails:** The small, dark, ribbed snails are classic examples of the **Common Periwinkle**. The scientific name for this species is ***Littorina littorea***.\n\n4.  **Confirm the distribution of *Littorina littorea*:**\n    *   **Atlantic Coast:** *Littorina littorea* is native to the northeastern Atlantic (Europe). It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast around the mid-1800s. It has since become one of the most common and abundant animals in the rocky intertidal zone from Labrador, Canada, down to Maryland, USA.\n    *   **Pacific Coast:** *Littorina littorea* is **not** native to the Pacific Coast of North America. While isolated, non-breeding populations have occasionally been found (e.g., in San Francisco Bay), it is not a widespread, established, or characteristic species of the Pacific intertidal zone.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The presence of a dense, established population of the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*, as shown by the multiple adult and likely juvenile snails in the photograph, is a definitive characteristic of a North American Atlantic rocky shore. Its absence as an established species on the Pacific coast makes it the key indicator organism.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
