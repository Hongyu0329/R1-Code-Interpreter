    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the substituents at the indicated positions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is a complex pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol. Its molecular formula is C₃₀H₅₂O. It has a hydroxyl (-OH) group on a six-membered ring (Ring A) and numerous methyl (CH₃) groups and hydrogen (H) atoms at specific stereocenters along its backbone.\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is carried out with catalytic hydrochloric acid (HCl) at a high temperature (110 °C). These are the classic conditions for an acid-catalyzed dehydration of an alcohol. The high temperature and acidic environment strongly favor carbocation formation and subsequent rearrangements to form a more stable product. The question explicitly states that the mechanism involves a series of [1,2] shifts.\n\n**Step 2: Propose the Reaction Mechanism - The Backbone Rearrangement**\nThis reaction is a classic example of a \"backbone rearrangement,\" a cascade of Wagner-Meerwein [1,2] shifts. The driving force is the formation of a more stable carbocation at each step.\n\n1.  **Protonation and Dehydration:** The acid catalyst (H⁺ from HCl) protonates the hydroxyl group, converting it into a good leaving group (-OH₂⁺). The water molecule departs, generating a secondary carbocation at carbon C-3.\n\n2.  **Carbocation Rearrangement Cascade:** The initially formed secondary carbocation undergoes a series of [1,2] shifts of neighboring methyl groups (a methanide shift) or hydrogen atoms (a hydride shift). In these fused ring systems, the migrating group is typically the one that is axial and thus anti-periplanar to the bond connecting to the carbocationic center. Based on the typical stereochemistry of such triterpenoids, we can trace the migration of the positive charge:\n    *   **Shift 1:** A methyl group from C-4 migrates to C-3. The positive charge moves to the now tertiary C-4.\n    *   **Shift 2:** The hydrogen atom from C-5 migrates to C-4. The positive charge moves to the tertiary C-5.\n    *   **Shift 3:** The methyl group from C-10 migrates to C-5. The positive charge moves to the tertiary C-10.\n    *   **Shift 4:** The hydrogen atom from C-9 migrates to C-10. The positive charge moves to the tertiary C-9.\n    *   **Shift 5:** The methyl group from C-8 migrates to C-9. The positive charge moves to the tertiary C-8.\n    *   **Shift 6:** The methyl group from C-14 migrates to C-8. The positive charge moves to the tertiary C-14.\n    *   **Shift 7:** The hydrogen atom from C-13 migrates to C-14. The positive charge moves to the tertiary C-13. This is the thermodynamically most stable location for the carbocation in this cascade.\n\n3.  **Elimination:** The reaction terminates by the elimination of a proton (H⁺) from a carbon adjacent to the final carbocation at C-13. The product structure shows a tetrasubstituted double bond between C-12 and C-13. This is formed by the removal of a proton from C-12, which is consistent with the Zaitsev rule, forming the most stable alkene.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Substituents at Positions 1-5**\nTo find the final substituents, we must track what happens at each of the numbered carbon atoms throughout the rearrangement.\n\n*   **Position 1 (on C-4):**\n    *   Initial state: C-4 has two methyl groups.\n    *   Process: One methyl group migrates to C-3. C-4 then gains a hydrogen atom from C-5.\n    *   Final state: C-4 is bonded to one methyl group and one hydrogen atom. The pointer '1' indicates the remaining methyl group.\n    *   **Therefore, 1 = CH₃.**\n\n*   **Position 2 (on C-10):**\n    *   Initial state: C-10 has one methyl group.\n    *   Process: The methyl group migrates to C-5. C-10 then gains a hydrogen atom from C-9.\n    *   Final state: C-10 is bonded to a hydrogen atom. The pointer '2' indicates this hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Therefore, 2 = H.**\n\n*   **Position 3 (on C-9):**\n    *   Initial state: C-9 has one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Process: The hydrogen atom migrates to C-10. C-9 then gains a methyl group from C-8.\n    *   Final state: C-9 is bonded to a methyl group. The pointer '3' indicates this new methyl group.\n    *   **Therefore, 3 = CH₃.**\n\n*   **Position 4 (on C-8):**\n    *   Initial state: C-8 has one methyl group.\n    *   Process: The methyl group migrates to C-9. C-8 then gains a methyl group from C-14.\n    *   Final state: C-8 is bonded to a methyl group. The pointer '4' indicates this new methyl group.\n    *   **Therefore, 4 = CH₃.**\n\n*   **Position 5 (on C-14):**\n    *   Initial state: C-14 has one methyl group.\n    *   Process: The methyl group migrates to C-8. C-14 then gains a hydrogen atom from C-13.\n    *   Final state: C-14 is bonded to a hydrogen atom. The pointer '5' indicates this hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Therefore, 5 = H.**\n\nFinal Answer compilation:\n1 = CH3\n2 = H\n3 = CH3\n4 = CH3\n5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
