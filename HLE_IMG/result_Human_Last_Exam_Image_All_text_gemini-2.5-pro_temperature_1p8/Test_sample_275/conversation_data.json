    "Step-by-step analysis:\nThe goal is to identify and count all unique splice species based on the provided RT-PCR results. A splice species corresponds to a unique mature mRNA molecule. The different PCR reactions probe for the presence of these species.\n\n1.  **Analyze Panel A (Genomic Map):** The map shows the exons (E6, E7, etc.) and the locations of primers. Importantly, it indicates two distinct polyadenylation sites, AE (early) and AL (late), suggesting that both early and late classes of transcripts may exist. It also defines primers that are specific for certain splice junctions (E1F2 for 929^3465 and E1F3 for 929^3506).\n\n2.  **Analyze Panels using general primer E1F1:**\n    *   **Panel I (E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles):** This is the most sensitive assay for transcripts that start in E1 and extend to L1 (late transcripts). It clearly shows four bands (450 bp, 419 bp, 378 bp, and 187 bp). This indicates the existence of **4 distinct late splice species**.\n    *   **Panel H (E1F1/L1R, 20 cycles):** This less sensitive reaction shows the two most abundant late species (450 bp and 419 bp).\n    *   **Panels B (E1F1/E4R) and C (E1F1/E5R):** These panels show two bands differing by 31 bp (190/159 bp and 584/553 bp, respectively). This is consistent with the two major late species from panel H/I (450 bp and 419 bp), which also differ by 31 bp. These panels confirm an alternative splicing event in the E1-E4 region but do not identify new species beyond what is seen in panel I.\n    *   **Panel E (E1F1/L2R, 20 cycles):** This reaction uses the E1F1 forward primer but the L2R reverse primer, which is upstream of L1R. It detects a major product of 1,005 bp. Since this large product is absent in Panel I (E1F1/L1R), it must come from a transcript that terminates before the L1R binding site, likely at the early polyadenylation site (AE). This identifies a distinct early transcript. Looking closely at the gel image for panel E, a second, fainter but consistent band is visible below the 1005 bp band across samples A-E. This suggests a second, less abundant early transcript, likely differing by the same 31 bp alternative splice seen with this primer in other contexts. Therefore, this panel provides evidence for **2 distinct early splice species**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Panels using splice-junction specific primer E1F2:**\n    *   **Panel F (E1F2/L2R, 25 cycles):** The E1F2 primer is specific for transcripts containing the 929^3465 splice. The reaction yields a single product of 972 bp. This identifies **1 distinct splice species** defined by this specific 5' splice choice. This species is different from the early species detected in panel E because the product sizes are different (972 bp vs. 1005 bp) with the same reverse primer.\n\n4.  **Analyze Panels using splice-junction specific primer E1F3:**\n    *   **Panel G (E1F3/L2R, 30 cycles):** The E1F3 primer is specific for transcripts containing the 929^3506 splice, which is mutually exclusive with the 929^3465 splice. This reaction yields two products (1,003 bp and 931 bp). This means that transcripts with the 929^3506 splice undergo further alternative splicing downstream. This identifies **2 distinct splice species**. These are different from the species in Panel F due to the different initial splice, and different from the species in Panel E due to the specific splice junction requirement and different sizes.\n\n**Tally of All Splice Species:**\nTo get the total number of unique splice species, we sum the distinct species identified from each category, ensuring no double counting. The categories (late E1F1, early E1F1, E1F2-defined, E1F3-defined) are based on distinct structural features (termination site or 5' splice site) and are therefore mutually exclusive.\n*   From late transcripts (Panel I): 4 species\n*   From early transcripts (Panel E): 2 species\n*   From transcripts with the 929^3465 splice (Panel F): 1 species\n*   From transcripts with the 929^3506 splice (Panel G): 2 species\n\nTotal number of splice species = 4 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
