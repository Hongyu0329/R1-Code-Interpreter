[Image of the three chemical structures of products A, B, and C.
**Product A (C₁₄H₂₀N₂O₃)** is depicted as the Michael addition product of the starting material onto methyl propiolate, which has then been acetylated on the nitrogen of the pyrrolidine ring. The structure is (S)-1-acetyl-2-((E)-3-(methoxycarbonyl)-1-(pyrrolidin-2-ylidene)allyl)pyrrolidine. This name is simplified; the structure shows N-acetylation and an N-CH=CH-COOMe side chain has been formed via Michael addition and ring opening of the dihydropyrrole.
**Product B (C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₃)** is depicted as a complex tetracyclic lactam, specifically methyl 2,3,5,6-tetrahydro-1H,4H-3a,6a-epiminopyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrrole-8-carboxylate. This structure results from a cycloaddition cascade.
**Product C (C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₃)** is shown as the spiro-β-lactam product from the [2+2] cycloaddition of ketene (from Ac₂O) onto the C=N bond of the starting material. The structure is (S)-1'-((S)-1-(4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carbonyl)-azetidin-2-one fused in a spiro manner.]
