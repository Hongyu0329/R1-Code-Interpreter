    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key**\nThe \"Pathétique\" Sonata, first movement, is in the key of C minor. The key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). The tonic chord is C minor (C-E♭-G).\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Measure and Identify its Notes**\nMeasure 30 is the third measure on the second system of the provided sheet music page (it is circled in the main image).\n*   **Left Hand:** Plays a staccato G octave on the downbeat. This firmly establishes G as the root of the harmony for this measure.\n*   **Right Hand:** Plays a fast passage of thirty-second notes: F-sharp, G, A-flat, G, F-sharp, G, E-natural, F-sharp.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Harmonic Function in Context**\nTo understand the function of measure 30, it is crucial to look at the preceding measure.\n*   **Measure 29:** The bass note is D. The right hand plays notes including F-sharp and C. The notes D, F-sharp, and C outline a D7 chord (D - F# - A - C). A D7 chord is the dominant seventh chord of G.\n*   In the key of C minor, G is the dominant (the fifth degree of the scale), represented by the Roman numeral V. Therefore, the D7 chord in measure 29 is the \"dominant of the dominant,\" notated as **V7/V**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Roman Numeral for Measure 30**\n*   In harmonic progressions, a V7/V chord almost always resolves to a V chord.\n*   Following the V7/V in measure 29, measure 30 begins with a strong G in the bass. This G is the expected resolution of the D7 chord. It is the root of the dominant chord (V) in the home key of C minor.\n*   The notes in the right hand (F#, A♭, E♮) are highly chromatic non-chord tones. Beethoven uses these notes to create extreme tension and embellish the underlying harmony, rather than to define a new chord. The F# is a carry-over from the V7/V harmony, the A♭ acts as a chromatic upper neighbor to G, and the E-natural is a coloristic passing tone.\n*   Despite the chromatic complexity in the melody, the structural harmony of the entire measure is based on the G in the bass. Its function is unequivocally that of the dominant. In a minor key, the dominant is typically a major chord to create a strong pull to the tonic.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe harmony in measure 29 (V7/V) resolves to the harmony in measure 30. Given that the bass note of measure 30 is G (the fifth scale degree), the correct Roman numeral is **V**.\n\n<<<V>>>"
