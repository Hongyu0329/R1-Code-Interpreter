    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the sex of each insect.\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Hymenoptera (Bees and Wasps):**\n\n*   **Antennae:** Males often have longer antennae than females. In many species, males have 13 antennal segments, while females have 12. In some groups, like long-horned bees and certain wasps, the difference is very pronounced, with male antennae being much longer and sometimes curled at the tip.\n*   **Abdomen:** Females have 6 visible abdominal segments (tergites) on the dorsal side, while males have 7. The tip of the female's abdomen is adapted for egg-laying and stinging, often appearing more pointed. The male's abdomen tip is often blunter and may have visible genital claspers.\n*   **Facial Markings:** In many bee and wasp species, males have yellow or white markings on their clypeus (the \"face\" area below the antennae), whereas the female's face is often dark.\n*   **Pollen-Collecting Hairs (Scopae):** Only non-parasitic female bees have specialized pollen-carrying hairs, either on their hind legs (scopae) or under their abdomen (abdominal scopa). Males, wasps, and parasitic (cuckoo) female bees lack these structures. The prompt specifies \"taxa without scopae on their legs\", which directs us to look at wasps, cuckoo bees, or to focus on males who lack scopae.\n\n**Analysis of Each Pair:**\n\n**Pair A: Cuckoo Bees (likely genus *Coelioxys*)**\n*   **Left Insect (A, left):** The abdomen is strongly tapered to a sharp, cone-like point. This is the characteristic shape of a female *Coelioxys*, whose modified ovipositor is used to pierce the nests of host bees to lay her eggs.\n*   **Right Insect (A, right):** The abdomen is truncated and ends in multiple spines or prongs. This multi-spined terminal end of the abdomen is characteristic of a male *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Female, Right is Male (F, M). This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n**Pair B: Paper Wasps (likely genus *Polistes*)**\n*   **Left Insect (B, left):** The antennae are relatively short and straight. The abdomen terminates in a distinct point (the stinger is housed here). This combination of features indicates a female.\n*   **Right Insect (B, right):** The antennae are visibly longer than the female's and are distinctly curled at the tips. The face also appears more yellow. These are classic features of a male paper wasp.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Female, Right is Male (F, M). This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n**Pair C: Long-horned Bees (likely tribe Eucerini, e.g., *Melissodes*)**\n*   **Left Insect (C, left):** The most striking feature is the extremely long antennae, characteristic of males in this group (hence the name \"long-horned bees\"). Additionally, the clypeus (face plate) is pale yellow, another common male trait.\n*   **Right Insect (C, right):** The antennae are short and thick, typical for a female of this group. The overall build is robust, and although the legs aren't perfectly clear, the short antennae are a definitive trait for a female long-horned bee.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   Pair A: F, M -> **4**\n*   Pair B: F, M -> **4**\n*   Pair C: M, F -> **3**\n\nCombining these results, the final answer is 4, 4, 3.\n\n<<<4, 4, 3>>>"
