    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency of the circuit at node $a_0$. This node is connected to the ground via a capacitor $C$. This forms a low-pass RC filter. The cutoff frequency (angular frequency, $\\omega_c$) is determined by the Thevenin equivalent resistance ($R_{th}$) seen by the capacitor and the capacitance $C$. The formula for the cutoff frequency is:\n$$ \\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C} $$\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Thevenin Equivalent Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to calculate the equivalent resistance at node $a_0$ with respect to ground. According to Thevenin's theorem, all independent sources must be deactivated. In this circuit, the input `IN` is at node $g_0$. Deactivating this voltage source means shorting it to ground. So, we set the voltage at node $g_0$ to zero.\n\nThe circuit for finding $R_{th}$ is as follows:\n1.  The capacitor $C$ is removed.\n2.  Node $g_0$ is connected to ground.\n3.  We need to find the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground.\n\nLooking into node $a_0$, we see a resistor $r$ connected to node $d_1$. The rest of the network is connected from node $d_1$ and $c_1$ upwards. Therefore, the Thevenin resistance is:\n$$ R_{th} = r + R_{d1 \\to gnd} $$\nwhere $R_{d1 \\to gnd}$ is the equivalent resistance from node $d_1$ to ground.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Infinite Ladder Network**\nThe circuit from nodes $(c_1, d_1)$ upwards is an infinite ladder network. A powerful technique to analyze such a network is to find its characteristic impedance. Let $Z_{char}$ be the equivalent resistance of the infinite ladder as seen between the terminals $c_n$ and $d_n$ for any $n \\ge 1$.\n\nDue to the infinite and repeating nature of the ladder, the resistance seen looking up from terminals $(c_1, d_1)$ is the same as that seen from $(c_2, d_2)$, and so on. Let's call this resistance $Z_{char}$.\n\nThe resistance between $c_1$ and $d_1$ ($Z_{char}$) is composed of two parallel paths:\n1.  The horizontal resistor $r$ connecting $c_1$ and $d_1$ directly.\n2.  The path going up to the next stage and back down. This path consists of the vertical resistor from $c_1$ to $c_2$ (resistance $r$), followed by the impedance between $c_2$ and $d_2$ (which is $Z_{char}$ by definition), followed by the vertical resistor from $d_2$ to $d_1$ (resistance $r$). The total resistance of this second path is $r + Z_{char} + r = 2r + Z_{char}$.\n\nTherefore, we can write a self-consistency equation for $Z_{char}$:\n$$ Z_{char} = r \\parallel (2r + Z_{char}) $$\nUsing the formula for parallel resistors, $R_p = \\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$:\n$$ Z_{char} = \\frac{r (2r + Z_{char})}{r + (2r + Z_{char})} = \\frac{2r^2 + r Z_{char}}{3r + Z_{char}} $$\nNow, we solve for $Z_{char}$:\n$$ Z_{char} (3r + Z_{char}) = 2r^2 + r Z_{char} $$\n$$ 3r Z_{char} + Z_{char}^2 = 2r^2 + r Z_{char} $$\n$$ Z_{char}^2 + 2r Z_{char} - 2r^2 = 0 $$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $Z_{char}$. Using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$ Z_{char} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{(2r)^2 - 4(1)(-2r^2)}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{4r^2 + 8r^2}}{2} = \\frac{-2r \\pm \\sqrt{12r^2}}{2} $$\n$$ Z_{char} = \\frac{-2r \\pm 2r\\sqrt{3}}{2} = r(-1 \\pm \\sqrt{3}) $$\nSince resistance must be a positive value, we take the positive root:\n$$ Z_{char} = r(\\sqrt{3} - 1) $$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate $R_{th}$**\nNow we can simplify the circuit. The entire infinite ladder starting from $(c_1, d_1)$ can be replaced by its characteristic resistance $Z_{char}$ connected between nodes $c_1$ and $d_1$.\n\nWe need to find $R_{d1 \\to gnd}$, the resistance from $d_1$ to ground. With $g_0$ grounded, the path from $d_1$ to ground is through $Z_{char}$ to $c_1$, and then through the resistor $r$ to $g_0$ (ground). These are in series.\n$$ R_{d1 \\to gnd} = Z_{char} + r = r(\\sqrt{3} - 1) + r = r\\sqrt{3} $$\nNow we can find the total Thevenin resistance at $a_0$:\n$$ R_{th} = r + R_{d1 \\to gnd} = r + r\\sqrt{3} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3}) $$\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Cutoff Frequency**\nFinally, we can find the cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$ using the formula from Step 1:\n$$ \\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C} = \\frac{1}{r(1 + \\sqrt{3}) C} $$\nTo rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $(\\sqrt{3} - 1)$:\n$$ \\omega_c = \\frac{1}{r(1 + \\sqrt{3}) C} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{\\sqrt{3} - 1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{r C ((\\sqrt{3})^2 - 1^2)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{r C (3 - 1)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{2rC} $$\n\nThe cutoff frequency at node $a_0$ is given by the expression $\\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{2rC}$."
