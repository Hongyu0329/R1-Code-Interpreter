    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Google Trends graph to determine the country.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Nature of the Graph**\nThe graph displays Google Trends data for three different search terms (represented by the red, blue, and yellow lines) over a period from December 2019 to late 2023. Google Trends shows the relative search interest in topics. The most prominent feature of all three lines is a series of sharp, narrow peaks that occur at roughly the same time each year. This pattern strongly suggests that the search terms are related to annual events, such as holidays, festivals, or anniversaries. The question states these are \"historic events\" in one country, reinforcing the idea that they are national commemorations.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Red Line**\n*   **Timing:** The red line shows consistent, high peaks every year around late January or early February.\n*   **Hypothesis:** This timing corresponds to Martin Luther King Jr. Day in the United States, which is observed on the third Monday of January. This is a major federal holiday commemorating the life and legacy of the civil rights leader. The annual spike in search interest around this date is a logical consequence.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Yellow Line**\n*   **Timing:** The yellow line shows a distinct peak every year in late May. It has some of the highest peaks on the entire chart, including the absolute highest peak in late May 2023.\n*   **Hypothesis:** This timing aligns perfectly with Memorial Day in the United States, which falls on the last Monday of May. It is a major federal holiday for honoring and mourning the U.S. military personnel who have died while serving in the United States armed forces. It also unofficially marks the start of summer, leading to high search volume.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Blue Line**\n*   **Timing:** The blue line shows peaks in mid-to-late June.\n*   **Pattern Change:** Notably, the peaks for the blue line are very small in 2020 but become significantly larger and more prominent from 2021 onwards.\n*   **Hypothesis:** This pattern strongly suggests the search term is \"Juneteenth\". Juneteenth (June 19th) commemorates the end of slavery in the United States. While it has been celebrated by African Americans for a long time, it was officially designated as a federal holiday on June 17, 2021. This historical event directly explains the dramatic increase in national search interest from 2021 onwards, as seen in the graph.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize and Conclude**\n*   The three identified events are Martin Luther King Jr. Day (January), Memorial Day (May), and Juneteenth (June).\n*   All three are significant federal holidays in the United States that commemorate important aspects of the nation's history.\n*   The unique patterns of each trend line (the establishment of Juneteenth as a national holiday in 2021, the consistent timing of MLK Day and Memorial Day) align perfectly with the recent history and calendar of the United States.\n\nTherefore, the country where all three historic events are commemorated is the United States.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
