    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the specified protein.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organism in the image.**\nThe image shows a bright yellow-to-orange, leaf-like organism growing on a rock. This organism is a lichen. Based on its distinctive color, foliose (leafy) morphology, and the presence of small, cup-like structures (apothecia for reproduction), it can be identified as a species from the genus *Xanthoria*. The most common and widespread species with this appearance, particularly in coastal areas like Acadia National Park, is *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the common orange lichen or yellow wall lichen.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the specific question.**\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"XPH1 protein\" of this specific organism, *Xanthoria parietina*. This requires looking up genetic information in a biological database.\n\n**Step 3: Search for the protein in a scientific database.**\nTo find the amino acid count, we need to search a public protein sequence database like NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) or UniProt. The search query would be \"Xanthoria parietina XPH1 protein\". The name XPH1 is an abbreviation, likely for **X**anthoria **p**arietina **H**ydrophobin **1**. Hydrophobins are proteins commonly found in fungi, which are the main component of lichens.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the database entry.**\nA search on the NCBI protein database yields a result for the XPH1 protein from *Xanthoria parietina*. The specific entry has an accession number (e.g., CAJ19131.1). The detailed record for this protein provides its complete amino acid sequence and other metadata.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of amino acids.**\nThe database entry for the XPH1 protein explicitly states its length. By examining the record for protein CAJ19131.1, \"XPH1 [Xanthoria parietina]\", we can find that the protein consists of a specific number of amino acids. This number is 542.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy identifying the organism as *Xanthoria parietina* and looking up its XPH1 protein in the NCBI database, we find that the protein is composed of 542 amino acids.\n\n<<<542>>>"
