    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Objective:**\nCalculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by changing from the Baseline (Table 1) scenario to the Proposed (Table 2) scenario.\n\n**Underlying Formula:**\nPercentage Reduction = [ (Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT ] * 100\n\n**Methodology:**\nTo find the total VMT, we need to calculate the VMT for each distance bracket and then sum them up. The VMT for each bracket is determined by the number of trips in that bracket, the percentage of those trips that are by car, and the average distance of those trips.\n\nWe can calculate a weighted VMT figure for each scenario, which is independent of the absolute total number of trips. The formula for the weighted VMT for a single distance bracket is:\n`(Share of total trips) x (Car mode share) x (Average trip distance)`\n\nWe will sum this value across all four distance brackets for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Total Weighted Car VMT for the Baseline Scenario**\n\nFirst, sum the car mode shares for each distance bracket in Table 1:\n*   **0-3 miles:** 25% (1 occupant) + 28% (>2 occupants) = 53%\n*   **3-5 miles:** 38% (1 occupant) + 43% (>2 occupants) = 81%\n*   **5-10 miles:** 40% (1 occupant) + 45% (>2 occupants) = 85%\n*   **10+ miles:** 42% (1 occupant) + 47% (>2 occupants) = 89%\n\nNow, calculate the weighted VMT for each bracket and sum them:\n*   **0-3 miles:** 0.48 (share of trips) * 0.53 (car share) * 1 (avg distance) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles:** 0.22 (share of trips) * 0.81 (car share) * 4 (avg distance) = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles:** 0.14 (share of trips) * 0.85 (car share) * 7.5 (avg distance) = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles:** 0.16 (share of trips) * 0.89 (car share) * 20 (avg distance) = 2.8480\n\n**Total Baseline Weighted VMT =** 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Weighted Car VMT for the Proposed Scenario**\n\nFirst, sum the car mode shares for each distance bracket in Table 2:\n*   **0-3 miles:** 1% (1 occupant) + 2% (>2 occupants) = 3%\n*   **3-5 miles:** 8% (1 occupant) + 19% (>2 occupants) = 27%\n*   **5-10 miles:** 14% (1 occupant) + 27% (>2 occupants) = 41%\n*   **10+ miles:** 16% (1 occupant) + 33% (>2 occupants) = 49%\n\nNow, calculate the weighted VMT for each bracket and sum them:\n*   **0-3 miles:** 0.48 (share of trips) * 0.03 (car share) * 1 (avg distance) = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles:** 0.22 (share of trips) * 0.27 (car share) * 4 (avg distance) = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles:** 0.14 (share of trips) * 0.41 (car share) * 7.5 (avg distance) = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles:** 0.16 (share of trips) * 0.49 (car share) * 20 (avg distance) = 1.5680\n\n**Total Proposed Weighted VMT =** 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\n*   **VMT Reduction** = Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT) * 100\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100 = 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  The question asks for Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), not Person Miles Traveled. Therefore, the data on \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" is not needed, as a carpool is still a single vehicle.\n2.  The calculation requires a weighted average that accounts for both the share of trips in each distance bracket and the average distance of those trips. Simply using the \"Total\" columns would be incorrect.\n3.  Both \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\" are car trips and must be summed together to get the total car mode share for the VMT calculation.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
