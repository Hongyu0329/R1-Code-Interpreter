    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot Diagram:**\n    The first step is to identify the knot shown in the image. We can analyze its properties from the diagram.\n    *   **Crossing Number:** By carefully counting the points where the knot crosses over or under itself, we find there are a total of 9 crossings.\n    *   **Alternating Property:** An alternating knot is one where the crossings alternate between over and under as you travel along the knot. Let's trace the central \"spine\" of this knot. Starting from the top, it goes over the crossing strand, then over the next one, and over the one after that. Since it has at least two consecutive over-crossings, it is a non-alternating knot.\n    *   **Knot Identification:** We compare this 9-crossing, non-alternating diagram with standard knot tables and databases. This specific diagram is a well-known representation of the knot designated as **`9_49`** in the Hoste-Thistlethwaite tables. It is sometimes also referred to as **Lisman's knot**. It is a prime knot.\n\n2.  **Recall the Rasmussen Invariant (s-invariant):**\n    *   The Rasmussen invariant, denoted `s(K)` for a knot `K`, is an integer invariant derived from a version of Khovanov homology. It is a powerful tool in modern knot theory, particularly in the study of knot concordance and slice knots.\n    *   `s(K)` is always an even integer.\n    *   A key property is its relation to slice knots. A knot is called **slice** if it is the boundary of a smooth disk embedded in the 4-dimensional ball. If a knot `K` is slice, then `s(K) = 0`.\n    *   Calculating `s(K)` from its definition is a highly complex process, so for a specific knot, we typically rely on known, computed values or on its relationship with other invariants.\n\n3.  **Find Known Properties of the `9_49` Knot:**\n    To find the Rasmussen invariant, we look up the properties of `9_49` in knot theory resources like the Knot Atlas or academic papers.\n    *   The `9_49` knot is famous for being a \"stealth\" knot. Its classical polynomial invariants (Alexander, Conway, Jones) are all 1, the same as the unknot.\n    *   **Alexander Polynomial `Δ(t)`:** For `9_49`, `Δ(t) = 1`.\n    *   Despite its trivial polynomial invariants, `9_49` is not the unknot, and it is not a slice knot. This was proven using modern invariants.\n    *   There is a crucial relationship between the Rasmussen invariant `s(K)` and another modern invariant, the **Ozsváth-Szabó τ-invariant**, for knots with a trivial Alexander polynomial:\n        `s(K) = 2τ(K)`   (if `Δ_K(t) = 1`)\n    *   The Ozsváth-Szabó invariant `τ` for the `9_49` knot has been computed and is known to be **`τ(9_49) = 1`**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Rasmussen Invariant:**\n    Using the information gathered in the previous steps, we can now calculate the Rasmussen invariant for `9_49`.\n    *   We know `Δ(9_49)(t) = 1`, so the formula `s(K) = 2τ(K)` applies.\n    *   We know `τ(9_49) = 1`.\n    *   Substituting this value into the formula: `s(9_49) = 2 * 1 = 2`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe knot in the image is `9_49`. Its Rasmussen invariant can be determined using its known Ozsváth-Szabó `τ`-invariant and the relationship `s(K) = 2τ(K)`. Since `τ(9_49) = 1`, the Rasmussen invariant is 2. This non-zero value confirms that the knot is not slice.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
