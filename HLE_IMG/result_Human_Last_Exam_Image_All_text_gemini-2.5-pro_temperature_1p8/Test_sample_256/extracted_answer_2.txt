True. On the upper right side of the panel, one can distinguish letters written in a European style, appearing to be the characters "ño". This is very likely part of the Spanish word "Año" (Year), which would have been part of an inscription left by Spanish explorers or missionaries, a common practice after European contact. The Spanish language and the Latin script are symbols of a culture foreign to the pre-contact artists of the Southwest.
