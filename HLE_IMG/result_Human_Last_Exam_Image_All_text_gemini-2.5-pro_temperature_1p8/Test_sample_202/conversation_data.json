    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens.\n\n**Analysis of the Specimens**\n\nTo identify these rocks, we will examine their key characteristics such as texture (crystal size, presence of grains or layers, holes), composition (visible minerals), and color.\n\n**Specimen H**\n1.  **Observation:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a very rough, porous surface with many visible holes or cavities. These holes are called vesicles.\n2.  **Interpretation:** The vesicles indicate that gas was trapped within molten rock (lava) as it cooled rapidly on the Earth's surface. This points to an extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock. The reddish color is often due to the oxidation of iron within the lava.\n3.  **Identification:** A highly vesicular, dark-colored (red or black) volcanic rock is known as **Scoria**.\n\n**Specimen J**\n1.  **Observation:** This specimen is light in color (whitish-gray) and is also filled with vesicles, much like specimen H. Its texture appears very fine-grained and almost frothy.\n2.  **Interpretation:** Like scoria, the vesicles show it's an extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock that cooled quickly. However, its light color indicates a different chemical composition (felsic, rich in silica). Rocks like this are known for being very low in density.\n3.  **Identification:** A light-colored, highly vesicular, low-density volcanic rock is identified as **Pumice**.\n\n**Specimen I**\n1.  **Observation:** This rock is composed of many smaller, angular fragments (clasts) of different rocks and minerals cemented together in a fine-grained, light-gray matrix. We can see bits of red, gray, and white material.\n2.  **Interpretation:** A rock made of consolidated fragments from a volcanic eruption (ash, lapilli, bombs) is known as a pyroclastic rock. When the material is primarily fine volcanic ash that has hardened into a rock, it's called tuff. If it contains larger, more angular fragments, it's a volcanic breccia. Given the mix of fragment sizes in a fine matrix, this rock is a type of volcanic conglomerate or breccia. A common name for such a rock is **Tuff** or **Volcanic Breccia**.\n3.  **Identification:** This specimen is best identified as **Volcanic Tuff** or **Volcanic Breccia**.\n\n**Specimen K**\n1.  **Observation:** This rock is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. The texture is coarse-grained (phaneritic). There are different colored minerals, including light-colored ones (pinkish/white feldspar and glassy quartz) and dark ones (black biotite or hornblende).\n2.  **Interpretation:** The large crystal size indicates that the magma cooled very slowly, deep beneath the Earth's surface. This identifies it as an intrusive igneous rock. The mix of light-colored felsic minerals (feldspar, quartz) and some dark mafic minerals is characteristic of granite.\n3.  **Identification:** This coarse-grained, intrusive igneous rock is identified as **Granite**.\n\n**Summary of Identifications**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Volcanic Tuff / Volcanic Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Granite\n\n<<<\nH: Scoria\nI: Volcanic Tuff (or Volcanic Breccia)\nJ: Pumice\nK: Granite\n>>>"
