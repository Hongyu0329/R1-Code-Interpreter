    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ID of the Ingvar runestone depicted in the image fragment.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the image fragment.**\nThe most prominent and unusual feature of the inscription is its layout. The runes are carved within a distinct grid of horizontal and vertical lines, organizing the text into neat rows and columns. This grid pattern is a very specific stylistic choice and a strong clue for identification.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the context provided by the question.**\nThe question specifies that the stone is an \"Ingvar runestone.\" This refers to a group of about 30 Viking Age runestones raised in memory of those who died on Ingvar the Far-Travelled's expedition to Serkland (in the East) around the year 1041.\n\n**Step 3: Combine visual evidence with the contextual clue.**\nThe task is to find an Ingvar runestone that features this unique grid pattern. A search through the corpus of Ingvar runestones reveals that only one has this distinctive feature: the Grinda runestone.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the official designation of the Grinda runestone.**\nIn the scholarly catalog of Swedish runic inscriptions, *Sveriges runinskrifter*, runestones are given unique identifiers based on the province they are from. The Grinda runestone is located in Södermanland, and its designation is **Sö 166**.\n\n**Step 5: Corroborate the identification by examining the runes.**\nTo confirm that the image is indeed from Sö 166, we can attempt to transliterate the visible runes and compare them to the known inscription on the stone. The runes are a form of Younger Futhark.\n\n*   **Top Row:** Reading from left to right, we can discern the runes `ᚦ ᚢ ᚱ ᚠ ᛅ * ᚱ ᛁ ᛋ` ... which transliterate to `þurfa * ris...`. This matches a part of the inscription on the back of Sö 166, which contains the phrase `... þurfa * risa ...` (\"... need to raise ...\").\n*   **Middle Row:** The runes here are `* ᛋ ᛁ ᚼ ᛏ ᛁ ᚴ ᛅ *` which transliterate to `* sihtika *`. This corresponds to the name `Sigdiaka` (a variant spelling) which appears in the Sö 166 inscription immediately following the phrase above (separated by the words `eftiʀ`, \"in memory of\").\n*   **Bottom Row:** The runes visible are `* ᛁ ᚾ ᚴ ᛁ ᛅ ᛚ ᛏ ᛁ *`, transliterating to `* inkialti *`. This corresponds to the name `Ingialdi`, which also appears in the Sö 166 inscription.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion.**\nThe unique grid pattern seen in the image is the defining characteristic of the Grinda runestone. This stone is known to be one of the Ingvar runestones, and its official catalog ID is Sö 166. The visible rune sequences `...þurfa * ris...`, `* sihtika *`, and `* inkialti *` directly match words found in the stone's inscription. Therefore, the image fragment is from the Ingvar runestone Sö 166.\n\n<<<Sö 166>>>"
