    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Observation of the image:** The image displays a computer-generated model of a protein, specifically a ribbon diagram. This type of visualization represents the protein's backbone, showing secondary structures like alpha-helices (coils) and beta-sheets (flat arrows). The protein is colored in two distinct sections: a larger domain in dark blue and a smaller domain in light blue. There is also a small yellow stick representation, highlighting a specific amino acid side chain.\n\n2.  **Initial Search Strategy:** The most effective way to identify a specific protein from its structural image is to perform a reverse image search. This will likely lead to web pages where this image is used, such as scientific databases, publications, or educational resources.\n\n3.  **Performing Reverse Image Search:** A reverse image search on the provided picture points to several sources, most prominently the Wikipedia page for \"Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme\". The image is used on this page to illustrate the structure of such an enzyme.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Source Information:**\n    *   On the Wikipedia page for \"Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme\", the caption for this exact image reads: \"Crystal structure of Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 G2\".\n    *   The caption often links to the original data source in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Following this link or searching for the structure leads to PDB entry **1J7D**.\n    *   The PDB entry 1J7D is titled \"Human Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme E2-25k\". The molecule is named \"Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-25 kDa\" (gene name UBE2K).\n\n5.  **Verification of Protein Features:**\n    *   **Function:** Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2 enzymes) are crucial in the ubiquitination pathway, which attaches ubiquitin proteins to other proteins, typically to mark them for degradation.\n    *   **Structure:** E2 enzymes have a characteristic catalytic domain known as the UBC fold. The larger dark blue part of the protein in the image represents this UBC domain. The highlighted yellow stick represents the active site cysteine residue, which is essential for the enzyme's function as it forms a temporary covalent bond with ubiquitin.\n    *   **Domains:** Some E2 enzymes, like the one pictured (UBE2K), have additional domains. The light blue domain is the C-terminal Ubiquitin-Associated (UBA) domain, which helps the enzyme interact with ubiquitin chains. This two-domain structure (UBC + UBA) is characteristic of this specific E2 enzyme.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The image shows the crystal structure of a human E2 enzyme. Based on the widely used caption for this image and the corresponding PDB entry (1J7D), the specific name for this protein is Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 G2, also known as UBE2K or E2-25k.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It's important to identify the type of molecular visualization (ribbon diagram).\n*   A reverse image search is the most direct tool for this type of query.\n*   Cross-referencing the information with reliable databases like the PDB is crucial for confirmation.\n*   Understanding the basic structural features (helices, sheets, domains, active site) helps verify the identity of the protein.\n*   A protein can have multiple names (e.g., UBE2K, E2-25k, E2 G2). The name provided in the image's most common context is a valid answer.\n\n<<<Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 G2>>>"
