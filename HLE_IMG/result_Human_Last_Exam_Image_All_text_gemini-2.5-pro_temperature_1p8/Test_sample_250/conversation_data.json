    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Analyze the Key Signature and Tonality:** The key signature has four flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db). The first chord of the piece is F minor (notated as F-), and the piece concludes on an F chord. This strongly indicates the key is F minor.\n2.  **Examine the Chord Progression (A Section):** The first few bars have a very distinctive chord progression:\n    *   Bar 1: F- (F minor)\n    *   Bar 2: E-7b5 (E minor 7 flat 5, also known as E half-diminished)\n    *   Bar 3: Eb-6 (Eb minor 6)\n    *   Bar 4: Dbmaj7 followed by G7\n    This chromatic descent in the bass line (F, E, Eb, D) is a hallmark of a specific, well-known jazz standard.\n3.  **Examine the Melody (A Section):** The melody begins on the note C (the fifth of the F minor chord) and moves up to F (the root). The rhythmic pattern is an eighth rest, eighth note C, quarter note F. This melodic contour combined with the initial F minor chord is very recognizable.\n4.  **Examine the Form and Bridge (B Section):** The piece has repeat signs with a first and second ending, typical of an A section. Following the repeat, a new section (the bridge) begins. The chords are:\n    *   D-7b5 | G7 | C7 | F7 | Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab ...\n    This progression moves through a series of ii-V-I related chords, a common structure for a jazz bridge, leading to the relative major key (Ab major) before turning around to return to F minor for the final A section.\n5.  **Synthesize the Information:** The combination of the key (F minor), the unique chromatic chord progression `Fm7 - Em7b5 - Eb-6`, the opening melodic phrase, and the standard AABA form all point to one specific composition.\n6.  **Identify the Song and Composer:** This musical information unambiguously identifies the song as \"Yesterdays\". The music for \"Yesterdays\" was written by Jerome Kern, with lyrics by Otto Harbach. In the context of a jazz standard, \"composer\" refers to the composer of the music.\n\nCareful points:\n*   The handwriting on the lead sheet is a bit messy, but the notes and chord symbols are legible.\n*   F- is a common shorthand for an F minor chord (often Fm or Fm7 in jazz).\n*   E-7b5 is a more explicit notation for what is often written as EÃ¸7 (E half-diminished).\n*   The G7 chord in the fourth bar acts as a secondary dominant, creating tension that resolves to the C7 chord in the next measure, which then leads back to F minor. This harmonic movement is crucial to the song's identity.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe title of the song is \"Yesterdays\", and the composer is Jerome Kern.\n\n<<<\"Yesterdays\" by Jerome Kern>>>"
