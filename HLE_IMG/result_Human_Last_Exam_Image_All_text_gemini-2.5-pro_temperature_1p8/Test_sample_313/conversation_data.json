    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first part of the question and the image.**\n*   The question states that \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows two men in suits at what appears to be an awards ceremony. A younger man with a beard is shaking hands with an older man and receiving a trophy.\n*   A search for major awards ceremonies on or around June 20, 2019, points to the 2019 NHL Awards, which were held on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas. The date is close enough to be considered a match, accounting for reporting dates or time zones.\n*   By comparing the man receiving the award to the winners of the 2019 NHL Awards, we can identify him as Nikita Kucherov, a professional ice hockey player for the Tampa Bay Lightning. He won the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP) and the Ted Lindsay Award that night. The man presenting the award is NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman.\n*   So, the image depicts Nikita Kucherov. However, \"X Y\" is not necessarily his name but something related to him or the scene.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second part of the question.**\n*   The clue is: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This points to a historical or industrial object/process. We need to find a two-word term (\"X Y\") that fits this description.\n*   A well-known historical use of mercury salts (specifically mercuric nitrate) was in the felting process for making hats. This process, called \"carroting,\" stiffened the fur used to make felt.\n*   Chronic exposure to mercury vapor during this process led to mercury poisoning among hat makers, causing neurological symptoms. This is the origin of the expression \"mad as a hatter.\"\n*   Due to its extreme toxicity, the use of mercury in hat-making has been banned and has almost entirely ceased.\n*   This makes \"Felt Hat\" a very strong candidate for \"X Y.\"\n\n**Step 3: Connect the two parts of the question.**\n*   We need to verify if \"Felt Hat\" can logically be connected to the first part of the clue: \"Felt Hat is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The person pictured is Nikita Kucherov, a star hockey player. In ice hockey, a \"hat trick\" is a significant achievement where a single player scores three goals in one game.\n*   When a player scores a hat trick, it is a tradition for fans to celebrate by throwing their hats onto the ice.\n*   As a prolific goal-scorer and the season's MVP, Nikita Kucherov is strongly associated with the concept of the \"hat trick.\"\n*   Therefore, the question uses a clever play on words. \"Felt Hat\" is \"pictured\" figuratively through the presence of a hockey player famous for achievements that involve hats.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   The first clue refers to hockey player Nikita Kucherov, who is associated with hats through the term \"hat trick.\"\n*   The second clue accurately describes the history of felt hats, where mercury salts were used in their production, a practice now discontinued due to toxicity.\n*   Therefore, the two-word term \"X Y\" is \"Felt Hat.\"\n\n<<<Felt Hat>>>"
