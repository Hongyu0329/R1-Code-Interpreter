    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Chiral Centers:**\n    A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In the given molecule, there are three such centers. Let's label them from left to right for ease of reference: C-L (leftmost, with the hydroxyl group), C-M (middle, with the ethyl group), and C-R (rightmost, connected to the aminomethyl group).\n\n    *   **C-L**: Bonded to -OH, -CH3, an implicit -H, and the rest of the molecule to the right (`-C(M)`). These are four different groups.\n    *   **C-M**: Bonded to -CH2CH3 (ethyl), an implicit -H, the part of the molecule to the left (`-C(L)`), and the part to the right (`-C(R)`). These are four different groups.\n    *   **C-R**: Bonded to -CH3, -CH2NH2, an implicit -H, and the rest of the molecule to the left (`-C(M)`). These are four different groups.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Stereochemistry from the Drawing:**\n    The drawing uses wedges (bonds coming out of the page) and dashes (bonds going into the page). The plain lines represent bonds in the plane of the page. This drawing style depicts the main C-C-C backbone as being in the plane.\n    *   At **C-L**, the -OH is on a wedge and the -CH3 is on a dash. The bonds to -H and -C(M) are in the plane.\n    *   At **C-M**, the -CH2CH3 is on a wedge. Since the two backbone C-C bonds are in the plane, the fourth substituent, the implicit -H, must be on a dash.\n    *   At **C-R**, the -CH2NH2 is on a wedge and the -CH3 is on a dash. The bonds to -H and -C(M) are in the plane.\n\n3.  **Determine the Absolute Configuration (R/S) for Each Chiral Center using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) Rules:**\n\n    **A. Analysis of C-L (the leftmost center):**\n    *   **Assign priorities:** The groups attached are -OH, -CH3, -H, and -C(M).\n        1.  **-OH** (highest priority, O atomic number 8)\n        2.  **-C(M)** (Carbon attached to C, C, H)\n        3.  **-CH3** (Carbon attached to H, H, H)\n        4.  **-H** (lowest priority)\n    *   **Determine configuration:** The lowest priority group (-H) is in the plane. A reliable method is to view the molecule down the bond from the lowest priority group to the chiral center (i.e., treat the -H as if it's pointing towards you). Then trace the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3. The true configuration is the *opposite* of the result.\n        *   Viewing from the H->C bond on the left: -OH(1) is up, -C(M)(2) is to the right, and -CH3(3) is down.\n        *   The path 1 -> 2 -> 3 is clockwise.\n        *   Since the lowest priority group is pointing towards the viewer, we reverse the result. Clockwise (R) becomes counter-clockwise (S).\n        *   Therefore, the configuration at C-L is **S**.\n\n    **B. Analysis of C-M (the middle center):**\n    *   **Assign priorities:** The groups are -CH(OH)CH3 (from C-L), -CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (from C-R), -CH2CH3 (ethyl), and -H.\n        1.  **-CH(OH)CH3** (The C is attached to {O, C, H})\n        2.  **-CH(CH3)CH2NH2** (The C is attached to {C, C, N}. Let's recheck. No, the C(M) is attached to C(R), which is bonded to C, C, H. Wait, we compare the groups attached to C-M. Let's compare the atoms bonded to the first carbon of each substituent: For `-CH(OH)CH3` the first carbon is attached to O, C, H. For `-CH(CH3)CH2NH2` the first carbon is attached to C, C, H. For `-CH2CH3` the first carbon is attached to C, H, H. Comparing these sets {O,C,H} > {C,C,H} > {C,H,H}. So the order is correct).\n        3.  **-CH2CH3** (The C is attached to {C, H, H})\n        4.  **-H** (lowest priority)\n    *   **Determine configuration:** The lowest priority group (-H) is on a dash (pointing away). We can directly trace the path 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n        *   The group with priority 1 is to the left, 2 is to the right, and 3 is wedged (out/up).\n        *   The path 1 -> 2 -> 3 is clockwise.\n        *   Therefore, the configuration at C-M is **R**.\n\n    **C. Analysis of C-R (the rightmost center):**\n    *   **Assign priorities:** The groups are -CH2NH2, -CH3, -H, and -C(M).\n        1.  **-CH2NH2** (The C is attached to {N, H, H})\n        2.  **-C(M)** (The C is attached to {C, C, H})\n        3.  **-CH3** (The C is attached to {H, H, H})\n        4.  **-H** (lowest priority)\n    *   **Determine configuration:** The lowest priority group (-H) is in the plane. We use the same method as for C-L. View down the H->C bond.\n        *   Viewing from the H->C bond on the right: -CH2NH2(1) is up, -C(M)(2) is to the left, and -CH3(3) is down.\n        *   The path 1 -> 2 -> 3 is counter-clockwise.\n        *   Since the lowest priority group is pointing towards the viewer, we reverse the result. Counter-clockwise (S) becomes clockwise (R).\n        *   Therefore, the configuration at C-R is **R**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe absolute configurations of the three chiral centers, from left to right as depicted in the image, are S, R, and R. To be fully descriptive with an IUPAC name, we first need to identify the parent chain. The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (amine) is a pentanamine chain with a hydroxyethyl substituent. The chiral centers, in order of IUPAC numbering, are C2, C3, and the carbon of the hydroxyethyl group attached to C3. Their configurations are:\n*   Center with -OH group (left): **S**\n*   Center with -ethyl group (middle): **R**\n*   Center with -CH2NH2 group (right): **R**\n\nThe configuration is (S, R, R) for the chiral centers from left to right.\n\n<<<S, R, R>>>"
