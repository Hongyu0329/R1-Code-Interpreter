    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants, product, and reaction conditions.**\n    *   Reactants: Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆) and cyclobutene (C₄H₄).\n    *   Product: A complex tricyclic molecule, C₁₀F₆H₄.\n    *   Conditions: The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hν` (light energy).\n    *   Key information: The problem explicitly states that \"two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the first pericyclic reaction.**\n    *   The reaction starts with hexafluorobenzene. Aromatic compounds like benzene and its derivatives can undergo photochemical isomerizations to form so-called \"valence isomers\".\n    *   A plausible first step is the photochemical conversion of hexafluorobenzene into its valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (hexafluoro-bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene).\n    *   This transformation involves the reorganization of the 6 π-electrons of the benzene ring to form a bicyclic structure containing a new σ-bond (between carbons 1 and 4) and two isolated π-bonds.\n    *   A pericyclic reaction in which a conjugated polyene undergoes cyclization to form a ring with one more σ-bond and one fewer π-bond is called an **electrocyclic reaction**.\n    *   In this case, it is a 6π electrocyclic reaction. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 6π (or more generally, a (4n+2)π) electrocyclic reaction is allowed photochemically.\n    *   So, the first reaction is a **photochemical 6π electrocyclic reaction**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the second pericyclic reaction.**\n    *   The intermediate from the first step is hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene. This molecule has two reactive double bonds. It then reacts with the second reactant, cyclobutene, which has one double bond.\n    *   The reaction between the double bond of cyclobutene and one of the double bonds of hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene leads to the formation of the final tricyclic product.\n    *   In this step, two unsaturated molecules combine to form a new cyclic system. The π-bond from cyclobutene (2 π-electrons) and a π-bond from hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (2 π-electrons) are consumed to form two new σ-bonds, creating a new four-membered ring.\n    *   A pericyclic reaction where two or more unsaturated molecules (or parts of the same molecule) combine to form a cyclic adduct is called a **cycloaddition reaction**.\n    *   Since this reaction involves a 2π-electron system reacting with another 2π-electron system, it is classified as a **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n    *   According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [2+2] cycloaddition (involving a total of 4 π-electrons, a 4n system) is allowed photochemically (typically via a suprafacial-suprafacial approach).\n    *   So, the second reaction is a **photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n4.  **Summary of Careful Points:**\n    *   Recognize that the `hν` implies photochemical conditions, which have specific selection rules for pericyclic reactions (Woodward-Hoffmann rules).\n    *   Deconstruct the complex overall transformation into two plausible sequential pericyclic reactions, as hinted by the problem statement.\n    *   The first step is an intramolecular rearrangement of hexafluorobenzene. Correctly identify this as an electrocyclic reaction (valence isomerization to Dewar benzene).\n    *   The second step is an intermolecular reaction between the Dewar benzene intermediate and cyclobutene. Correctly identify this as a cycloaddition, specifically a [2+2] cycloaddition, based on the reactants and the product structure (formation of a new four-membered ring).\n    *   Verify that both proposed reaction types are indeed photochemically allowed according to the rules for the number of π-electrons involved (6π for the electrocyclization, 4π for the cycloaddition).\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe transformation involves two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions. The first reaction is the conversion of hexafluorobenzene to hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, which is a **6π electrocyclic reaction**. The second reaction is the addition of cyclobutene to the Dewar benzene intermediate, which is a **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n<<<The two pericyclic reactions are a 6π electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition.>>>"
