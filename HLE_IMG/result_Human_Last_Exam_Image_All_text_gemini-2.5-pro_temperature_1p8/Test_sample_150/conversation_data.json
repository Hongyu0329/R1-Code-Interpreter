    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Intermediate-1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Benzene reacts with propanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. AlCl₃ is a Lewis acid that coordinates with the chlorine atom of the propanoyl chloride, generating a highly electrophilic acylium ion ([CH₃CH₂C=O]⁺).\n*   **Mechanism:** The benzene ring, acting as a nucleophile, attacks the acylium ion in an electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reaction.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-1):** The product is 1-phenylpropan-1-one, also known as propiophenone.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-1:**\n     \n\n**Step 2: Formation of Intermediate-2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Intermediate-1 (1-phenylpropan-1-one) is treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is another electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically a bromination. We must consider the directing effect of the substituent already on the ring.\n*   **Directing Effect:** The propanoyl group (-C(=O)CH₂CH₃) is an acyl group. It is an electron-withdrawing group and therefore a deactivator of the benzene ring towards further EAS. It directs incoming electrophiles to the **meta** position.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-2):** A bromine atom is added to the meta-position (position 3) of the benzene ring relative to the propanoyl group. The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-2:**\n     ![Intermediate 2: 1-(3-bromophenyl) propan-1-one](https://i.imgur.com/gKj6V3O.png)\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Intermediate-3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one) is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium catalyst (Pd).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. For a benzylic ketone (a ketone where the carbonyl carbon is attached to a benzene ring), this reaction typically reduces the carbonyl group (C=O) completely to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is sometimes referred to as hydrogenolysis. The aryl-bromide bond (C-Br) is generally stable under these conditions.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-3):** The ketone group is reduced to a CH₂ group, forming a propyl side chain. The product is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-3:**\n     \n\n**Step 4: Formation of the Final Product**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene) is treated with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂), and heated in carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a free-radical bromination. NBS is a specific reagent for brominating at allylic or benzylic positions. Benzoyl peroxide acts as a radical initiator, and CCl₄ is an inert solvent.\n*   **Selectivity:** The reaction is highly selective for the **benzylic position**. This is the carbon atom of the alkyl chain directly attached to the aromatic ring. This position is favored because the intermediate benzylic radical is stabilized by resonance with the π system of the benzene ring.\n*   **Product:** A hydrogen atom on the benzylic carbon of the propyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Structure of Final Product:**\n     ![Final Product: 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl) propane](https://i.imgur.com/VpTdwj7.png)\n\n**Naming the Final Product:**\n\nTo name the final molecule, we can treat propane as the parent chain.\n*   The propane chain is numbered starting from the end closest to the substituents. This makes the carbon attached to the ring and the new bromine C-1.\n*   At C-1, there is a **bromo** group.\n*   Also at C-1, there is a **(3-bromophenyl)** group.\n*   Combining these parts, the systematic IUPAC name is **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\nAnother valid name, treating benzene as the parent, is 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
