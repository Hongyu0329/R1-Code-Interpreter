    "*   **Step 1: Identify the Goal.**\n    The objective is to find the full name of the artist who created the painting shown in the image.\n\n*   **Step 2: Look for Clues in the Image.**\n    Artworks are often signed by the artist. A common location for a signature is the bottom right or left corner. By examining the main image and the provided crops, we can see a signature in the bottom right corner.\n\n*   **Step 3: Decipher the Signature.**\n    The last cropped image provides a clear view of the signature. It is handwritten and appears to read \"augusto Pinillos\" followed by the date \"'39\". This suggests the artist's name is Augusto Pinillos and the painting was made in 1939.\n\n*   **Step 4: Research the Artist's Name.**\n    A search for \"artist Augusto Pinillos\" leads to information about Augusto Pinillos Pérez, a well-known Peruvian painter who lived from 1908 to 1981. He was a prominent member of the \"indigenista\" movement in Peruvian art.\n\n*   **Step 5: Verify the Information.**\n    The style of the watercolor painting, which depicts a coastal landscape, is consistent with the known works of Augusto Pinillos Pérez. He frequently painted landscapes of the Peruvian coast, and the date 1939 falls within his active period. The painting is identified in art collections as \"Paisaje de la Herradura\" (Landscape of Herradura), a location in Peru, further confirming the artist's identity.\n\n*   **Step 6: Determine the Full Name.**\n    Based on the research, the artist's full name is Augusto Pinillos Pérez.\n\n<<<Augusto Pinillos Pérez>>>"
