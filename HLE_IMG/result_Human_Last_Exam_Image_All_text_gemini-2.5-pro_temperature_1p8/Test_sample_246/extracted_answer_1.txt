Yes, there is clear evidence of insect activity in the image. The most prominent evidence is the large, white, woolly structure on the twig, which is an insect gall known as a Wool Sower Gall. This gall was created by a gall wasp. The female wasp laid her eggs by injecting them into the tissue of the oak twig. The gall is the plant's growth response to the larvae that hatched from those eggs. Therefore, the eggs that created this structure were laid inside the twig where the gall is now located. The gall itself contains numerous seed-like capsules, each protecting a developing larva.
