    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material**\nFirst, we need to determine the molecular formula of the starting reactant.\nThe starting material is a bicyclic lactam with two substituents: a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) and a p-methoxybenzyl group (-PMB) on the nitrogen atom.\n*   The core structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. Let's count the atoms in this unsubstituted core:\n    *   It contains 6 carbon atoms (C1, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7), 1 nitrogen atom (N2), and 1 oxygen atom (O at C3).\n    *   The hydrogens are located at C1(H), C4(H), C5(H), C6(H), and C7(CH2). Total hydrogens = 1+1+1+1+2 = 6 H.\n    *   So, the formula of the basic 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one with an H on the nitrogen is C6H7NO.\n*   The given starting material has substituents:\n    *   A trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) on the double bond (let's assume C5). This replaces one hydrogen atom.\n    *   A p-methoxybenzyl group (PMB, -CH2-C6H4-OCH3) on the nitrogen atom. This replaces the hydrogen atom on the nitrogen. The PMB group has a formula of C8H9O.\n*   Let's calculate the molecular formula of the starting material:\n    *   Start with the N-H lactam core with the CF3 group: 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. Formula = C(6+1) H(6-1) F3NO = C7H5F3NO. Note: 1 H is replaced by CF3, and the H on N is present. Let's verify the H count on C7H6F3NO for Intermediate 1 from below to be more confident: Skeleton C6H5NO + CF3 + H on N = C7H6F3NO. Okay, C7H6F3NO is the structure after deprotection.\n    *   Let's re-calculate the starting material from scratch to avoid confusion.\n        *   Core skeleton (C6H5NO) + CF3 group (C1, F3) + PMB group (C8H9O).\n        *   Carbons (C): 6 (core) + 1 (from CF3) + 8 (from PMB) = 15\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 5 (core) + 9 (from PMB) = 14\n        *   Fluorines (F): 3\n        *   Nitrogens (N): 1\n        *   Oxygens (O): 1 (core carbonyl) + 1 (PMB ether) = 2\n    *   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Intermediate 1**\n*   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in acetonitrile/water (ACN/H2O).\n*   **Transformation:** CAN is a strong oxidizing agent commonly used for the cleavage of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers and amides. In this case, it removes the PMB protecting group from the nitrogen atom.\n*   **Change in atoms:** The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen.\n    *   Change in C: -8\n    *   Change in H: -9 (from PMB) + 1 (on N) = -8\n    *   Change in O: -1 (from PMB's methoxy group)\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 1:**\n    *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   H: 14 - 8 = 6\n    *   F: 3 (unchanged)\n    *   N: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Intermediate 1 has the formula **C7H6F3NO**. This corresponds to 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Intermediate 2**\n*   **Reaction:** Intermediate 1 is treated with Pd/C and H2 in methanol (MeOH).\n*   **Transformation:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The palladium-on-carbon catalyst with hydrogen gas will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) to a single bond (C-C). The lactam (amide) and trifluoromethyl groups are typically stable under these conditions.\n*   **Change in atoms:** Two hydrogen atoms are added across the double bond.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 2:**\n    *   C: 7 (unchanged)\n    *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n    *   F: 3 (unchanged)\n    *   N: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   O: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   Intermediate 2 has the formula **C7H8F3NO**. This corresponds to 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of the final Product**\n*   **Reaction:** Intermediate 2 is treated with 4 N aqueous HCl at 70 Â°C.\n*   **Transformation:** These are harsh acidic conditions which cause the hydrolysis of the amide bond within the lactam ring. The ring opens up. This process involves the addition of one molecule of water (H2O) across the C-N amide bond. The carbonyl carbon becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the nitrogen atom becomes an amino group (-NH2). Since the reaction is in strong acid, the amino group will be protonated to form an ammonium salt (-NH3+), but for calculating the neutral molecular formula, we consider the amino acid.\n*   **Change in atoms:** One molecule of water (H2O) is added to the formula of Intermediate 2.\n*   **Molecular Formula of the Product:**\n    *   C: 7 (unchanged)\n    *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   F: 3 (unchanged)\n    *   N: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   The final product, which is an amino acid (4-amino-2-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid), has the molecular formula **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\n**Summary of Changes:**\n*   Starting Material: C15H14F3NO2\n*   Step 1 (-PMB, +H): -C8H8O -> Intermediate 1: C7H6F3NO\n*   Step 2 (+H2): +H2 -> Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO\n*   Step 3 (+H2O): +H2O -> Product: C7H10F3NO2\n\nThe final molecular formula of the product is C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
