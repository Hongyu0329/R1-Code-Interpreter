    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The image displays a sound stimulus in two different ways.\n    *   **Top panel (Spectrogram):** This graph shows the frequency content of a sound over time. We see a strong, narrow horizontal band, which represents a pure tone of a constant frequency. This tone is interrupted in the middle by a vertical blur of many frequencies, which represents a short burst of noise (like a hiss or a cough). The pure tone seems to disappear and then reappear. However, the visual presentation suggests a continuous line going \"behind\" the noise burst.\n    *   **Bottom panel (Waveform):** This graph shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time. It starts as a regular, smooth sine wave (the pure tone). Then, it abruptly changes into a complex, chaotic waveform (the noise burst). After the burst, it returns to being a regular sine wave. This confirms that physically, the tone *stops*, is replaced by noise, and then *starts again*. There is no tone present during the noise.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Question:** The question asks for the name of a perceptual phenomenon or illusion. Key phrases are:\n    *   \"**illusion**\": This tells us that what we perceive is different from the physical reality presented. In this case, when someone listens to this sound, they typically report hearing the pure tone as *continuous*, playing right through the noise burst, as if the noise was just a brief event layered on top of it.\n    *   \"**similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity**\": The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where the brain interprets a 2D drawing as a 3D cube, but there are two equally plausible interpretations of its orientation. The brain flips between them. This comparison suggests that the auditory illusion also involves the brain \"filling in\" missing information or choosing a more plausible interpretation of ambiguous sensory data.\n    *   \"**reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability**\": This points to a fundamental brain mechanism. The brain's ability to create a perception of continuity from fragmented input is essential for understanding speech in noisy environments or for making sense of any complex auditory scene. We are usually not aware that our brain is doing this \"filling in.\"\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Clues:**\n    *   The core of the phenomenon is the perceptual \"restoration\" of a sound that is physically absent.\n    *   The brain perceives the tone as continuous because it's a more logical or probable scenario (a continuous tone being briefly masked by noise) than a tone stopping, being replaced by unrelated noise, and then starting again at the exact same frequency. This follows the Gestalt principle of \"good continuation.\"\n    *   This perceptual \"filling-in\" of a missing sound (specifically when it's replaced by noise) is a well-documented auditory illusion.\n\n4.  **Identify the Name:**\n    *   This specific effect was first scientifically described by Richard Warren in 1970. He replaced a speech sound (a phoneme) in a sentence with a cough and found that listeners not only perceived the sentence as complete but often couldn't even identify where the cough had occurred. He named this phenomenon the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**.\n    *   Although the image here uses a pure tone instead of a speech phoneme, the underlying mechanism is identical, and the phenomenon is widely referred to by the same name. It is also sometimes called the **Auditory Continuity Illusion** or **Temporal Induction**, but \"Phonemic Restoration Effect\" is the most famous and specific name for this demonstration.\n\n**Conclusion:** The image and description perfectly illustrate the Phonemic Restoration Effect, where the brain perceptually restores a missing portion of a sound that has been replaced by noise, creating the illusion of continuity.\n\n<<<Phonemic Restoration Effect>>>"
