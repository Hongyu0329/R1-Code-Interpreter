    "*   **Step 1: Identify the Key.** The piece is Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397. The key signature has one flat (B♭), and the title explicitly states the key is D minor. The tonic chord is D minor.\n\n*   **Step 2: Locate the Measure and Notes.** The question directs us to the circled notes in measure 8. These notes fall on the third beat of the measure. The time signature is common time (4/4).\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the Notes Played.** We need to identify all the notes played simultaneously within the circled region.\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The notes played are A, C♯, and E. These three notes form an A major triad. The sharp symbol (♯) next to the C indicates it is C-sharp, not the C-natural from the key of D minor's natural scale.\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The melodic notes are E, F♯, and G. The E is part of the underlying A major chord. The F♯ and G are non-chord tones (passing tones or appoggiaturas) that decorate the melody but do not define the core harmony.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the Harmonic Function.** The core harmony is the A major triad (A-C♯-E) played by the left hand. We need to determine its function in the key of D minor.\n    *   The root of the chord is A.\n    *   In the key of D minor, the note A is the 5th scale degree.\n    *   A chord built on the 5th scale degree is called the dominant chord.\n    *   In a minor key, the natural dominant is a minor chord (A-C-E for D minor). However, it is standard practice to raise the 7th scale degree (C to C♯ in this case) to create a leading tone, which makes the dominant chord major (A-C♯-E). This major dominant creates a stronger pull back to the tonic (D minor).\n\n*   **Step 5: Formulate the Roman Numeral.**\n    *   The Roman numeral for the dominant chord is **V**.\n    *   Because the chord is major, the numeral is written in uppercase.\n    *   The lowest note played is A, which is the root of the chord. Therefore, the chord is in root position, and no inversion figures are needed.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The harmony in the circled portion of measure 8 is an A major chord, which functions as the dominant chord in the key of D minor. The correct Roman numeral is V.\n\n<<<V>>>"
