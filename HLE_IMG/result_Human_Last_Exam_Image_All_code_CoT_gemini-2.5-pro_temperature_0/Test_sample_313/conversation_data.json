    "Here is my thinking process to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the first clue:** \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n    *   The image shows an awards ceremony. A reverse image search or a search for \"awards ceremony June 20 2019\" points to the 2019 NHL Awards in Las Vegas.\n    *   The man receiving the award is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov, a star player for the Tampa Bay Lightning. He won multiple awards that night, including the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP).\n    *   This clue establishes a connection to the sport of ice hockey.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second clue:** \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n    *   This is a classic piece of trivia. The profession that famously used mercury salts (specifically mercuric nitrate) to process felt for hats was that of a **hatter**.\n    *   The prolonged exposure to mercury caused neurological damage, leading to the expression \"mad as a hatter\". This profession, in its original form, has ceased to exist due to the toxicity.\n\n3.  **Connect the clues:**\n    *   From the second clue, we can deduce that \"X Y\" is \"Hatter\".\n    *   Now, we must connect \"Hatter\" to the first clue. The image shows a famous hockey player. In hockey, scoring three goals in a single game is called a \"hat trick\". While not a formal title, a player who scores a hat trick (or is a prolific scorer) can be colloquially referred to as a \"hatter\".\n    *   Therefore, the word \"Hatter\" fits both clues:\n        *   **Clue 1:** A hockey player (a \"hatter\" in the context of hat tricks) is pictured.\n        *   **Clue 2:** An old-fashioned hatter (hat maker) is a profession that no longer uses mercury salts.\n\n4.  **Construct the code:** The Python code will explain this logic and then print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle by breaking it down into two parts and connecting them.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Clue 1: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n    # The image shows hockey player Nikita Kucherov at the 2019 NHL Awards.\n    # In hockey, scoring three goals is a \"hat trick\". A player who achieves this can be called a \"hatter\".\n    clue1_subject = \"A hockey player (a 'hatter')\"\n\n    # Clue 2: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n    # This refers to the historical profession of a \"hatter\" (a hat maker), who used mercury\n    # salts to make felt, a practice now obsolete due to its toxicity.\n    clue2_subject = \"A hat maker (also a 'hatter')\"\n\n    # The common word connecting both clues is \"Hatter\".\n    answer = \"Hatter\"\n\n    print(\"Thinking Process:\")\n    print(f\"1. The image shows a famous hockey player at the 2019 NHL awards. In hockey, a player who scores three goals gets a 'hat trick'. This person can be described as a 'hatter'.\")\n    print(f\"2. The second clue refers to the old profession of a 'hatter' (a hat maker), which used toxic mercury salts to make felt.\")\n    print(f\"3. The word that fits both clues is '{answer}'.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer:\")\n    print(answer)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hatter>>>"
