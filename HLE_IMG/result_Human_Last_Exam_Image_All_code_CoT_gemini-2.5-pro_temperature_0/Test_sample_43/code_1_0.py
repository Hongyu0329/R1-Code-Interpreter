The reaction involves treating intermediate 1 with {equivalents_ch3mgbr} equivalents of methylmagnesium bromide at {temperature_celsius}Â°C for {time_hours} hours, resulting in a single major product with {yield_percent}% yield.

The mechanism proceeds as follows:
1.  **Deprotonation:** The Grignard reagent (CH3MgBr), being a strong base, first deprotonates the tertiary alcohol of compound 1. This is the most favorable initial step.
2.  **Chelation-Directed Cleavage:** The resulting magnesium alkoxide is located next to the benzodioxole ring. The magnesium ion acts as a Lewis acid, coordinating with the alkoxide oxygen and an adjacent oxygen of the benzodioxole. This chelation activates the benzodioxole's methylene (-O-CH2-O-) group.
3.  **Intramolecular Attack:** The alkoxide oxygen then performs an intramolecular nucleophilic attack on the activated methylene carbon.
4.  **Ring Expansion:** This attack opens the five-membered benzodioxole ring and forms a new, seven-membered dioxepine ring, along with a phenolate on the aromatic ring.
5.  **Workup:** Aqueous workup protonates the phenolate to give the final product, which contains a phenol group.

This specific intramolecular rearrangement is favored by the proximity of the reacting groups and the high temperature, leading to the high yield ({yield_percent}%) of a single product.

Based on this mechanism, the correct product and explanation are described in option C.
