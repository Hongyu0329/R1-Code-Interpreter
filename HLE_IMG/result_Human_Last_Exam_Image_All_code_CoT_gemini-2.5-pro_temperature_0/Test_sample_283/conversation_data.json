    "Based on the visual evidence from the Google Trends graph, I will deduce the country by identifying the annually recurring events represented by the peaks.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Graph:** I will examine the x-axis (timeline) and the three colored lines (red, yellow, blue) to identify the approximate time of year for the recurring peaks in search interest for each line.\n2.  **Identify Peak Timings:**\n    *   The **blue line** shows consistent, smaller peaks around the end of May each year. This strongly suggests a commemoration in late May.\n    *   The **yellow line** shows prominent peaks during the summer months, likely July or August.\n    *   The **red line** shows significant peaks in December of each year.\n3.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:** I will search for a country that has three major historical events or national holidays corresponding to these three distinct times of the year: late May, July/August, and December.\n4.  **Test the Hypothesis:** The United States fits this pattern perfectly:\n    *   **Blue Line:** Memorial Day, observed on the last Monday of May.\n    *   **Yellow Line:** Independence Day, celebrated on July 4th.\n    *   **Red Line:** Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, on December 7th.\n5.  **Construct a Python Script:** To fulfill the request of using coding skills, I will write a Python script that programmatically represents this reasoning. The script will define the observed peak timings and a knowledge base of events for different countries, then find the country that matches the observed pattern.\n\nHere is the Python code that formalizes this logical deduction:\n\n```python\ndef identify_country_from_trends():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function deduces the country by matching observed annual Google Trends peaks\n    with a knowledge base of major national historical events and holidays.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Represent the observations from the graph.\n    # The peaks for each color occur consistently in the same month each year.\n    observed_peaks = {\n        \"blue\": \"May\",   # Peaks occur around late May (e.g., near the 'May 28, 2023' label).\n        \"yellow\": \"July\",  # Peaks occur in the summer, after May but before December.\n        \"red\": \"December\" # Peaks occur in December (e.g., after the 'Dec 1, 2019' label).\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Create a knowledge base of events for candidate countries.\n    country_events_db = {\n        \"United States\": {\n            \"Memorial Day\": \"May\",\n            \"Independence Day\": \"July\",\n            \"Pearl Harbor Day\": \"December\"\n        },\n        \"France\": {\n            \"Victory in Europe Day\": \"May\",\n            \"Bastille Day\": \"July\",\n            \"Armistice Day\": \"November\"\n        },\n        \"Canada\": {\n            \"Victoria Day\": \"May\",\n            \"Canada Day\": \"July\",\n            \"Remembrance Day\": \"November\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Iterate through the knowledge base to find a match.\n    identified_country = None\n    matched_events_details = {}\n    \n    observed_months = set(observed_peaks.values())\n\n    for country, events in country_events_db.items():\n        country_event_months = set(events.values())\n        if observed_months == country_event_months:\n            identified_country = country\n            # Map the colors to the specific events for the explanation.\n            for color, month in observed_peaks.items():\n                for event_name, event_month in events.items():\n                    if month == event_month:\n                        matched_events_details[color] = event_name\n            break\n\n    # Step 4: Print the conclusion.\n    if identified_country:\n        print(\"Analysis of the Google Trends graph leads to the following conclusion:\")\n        print(f\"\\n1.
