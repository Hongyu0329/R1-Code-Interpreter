# 1. Identify the number of distinct bands (representing splice species) in each relevant PCR experiment shown in the image.
# 2. Sum these numbers to find the total number of unique splice species detected.

# From Panel D (E1F2/E5R), there is 1 band. This uses a splice-specific primer (E1F2),
# identifying a new species.

# From Panel E (E1F1/L2R), there is 1 band, representing another unique species.

# From Panel F (E1F2/L2R), there is 1 band. Although it uses the same forward primer as D,
# the different reverse primer indicates a distinct, longer transcript.

# From Panel G (E1F3/L2R), there are 2 bands. This uses a different splice-specific primer (E1F3)
# and reveals two more unique species.

# From Panel I (E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles), there are 4 bands. This is the most comprehensive result for this
