    "This is a well-known jazz standard. I can identify it by analyzing its key, melody, and chord progression.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Music:** The key signature has four flats (Ab major or F minor). The first chord is F minor, and the melody centers around notes of the F minor scale. This strongly suggests the key is F minor.\n2.  **Identify the Melody:** The first four notes of the melody are C, F, G, and Ab. This melodic phrase is very distinctive.\n3.  **Identify the Chord Progression:** The initial chord progression is F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7 |. This progression, especially the descending minor-type chords, is a key characteristic.\n4.  **Search and Confirm:** Based on the melody and chords, I can identify the tune as \"Nica's Dream\".\n5.  **Identify the Composer:** The composer of \"Nica's Dream\" is the famous jazz pianist and composer Horace Silver.\n6.  **Generate Code:** I will write a Python script to print the title and composer.\n\n```python\ndef get_jazz_standard_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the title and composer of the provided jazz standard.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Nica's Dream\"\n    composer = \"Horace Silver\"\n\n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nget_jazz_standard_info()\n```\n<<<Title: Nica's Dream, Composer: Horace Silver>>>"
