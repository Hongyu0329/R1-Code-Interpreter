    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to answer your question:\n\n1.  I will first identify the key botanical terms related to the sporophyte of mosses, specifically focusing on the genus *Grimmia*.\n2.  I will then research the specific characteristics of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* sporophytes from reliable botanical sources.\n3.  The main distinguishing feature that is visible \"at a glance\" will be identified. This feature is related to the seta, the stalk that supports the spore capsule.\n4.  Finally, I will use a Python script to print out the explanation of this key difference.\n\n```python\ndef explain_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n    \"\"\"\n    species1 = \"Grimmia montana\"\n    species2 = \"Grimmia curviseta\"\n    \n    # The primary distinguishing feature is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule).\n    \n    # Feature for Grimmia montana\n    feature1_seta = \"straight\"\n    feature1_capsule_orientation = \"erect and typically immersed or emergent among the leaves\"\n    \n    # Feature for Grimmia curviseta\n    feature2_seta = \"strongly curved or cygneous (swan-necked)\"\n    feature2_capsule_orientation = \"cernuous (nodding) or pendulous (hanging down)\"\n    \n    print(f\"The main difference in the sporophyte between {species1} and {species2} that helps distinguish them at a glance is the seta (the stalk holding the capsule):\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    print(f\"1. {species1}: Has a {feature1_seta} seta, which makes the capsule {feature1_capsule_orientation}.\")\n    print(f\"2. {species2}: Has a {feature2_seta} seta, which causes the capsule to be {feature2_capsule_orientation}.\")\n\nexplain_difference()\n```\n<<<The main difference is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, resulting in an erect capsule, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a strongly curved seta, causing the capsule to be nodding or hanging.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta that helps distinguish both species at a glance?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
