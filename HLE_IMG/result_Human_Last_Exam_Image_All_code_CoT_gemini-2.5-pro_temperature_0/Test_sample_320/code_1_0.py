def solve_ca_puzzle():
    """
    This function solves the cellular automaton puzzle by identifying the correct sequences of visualizations for each rule.
    The logic is based on a step-by-step deduction process:
    1. Map visualizations to time steps based on pattern size (2t+1 rule).
    2. Identify a contradiction between the number of images found per time step and the number required by the problem's rules.
    3. Resolve the contradiction by reassigning the time steps of two key images (G and C), which is the non-obvious insight.
    4. Reconstruct the four evolutionary chains (rules) based on strong visual links and the corrected time assignments.
    5. Assemble the final answer in the specified format.
