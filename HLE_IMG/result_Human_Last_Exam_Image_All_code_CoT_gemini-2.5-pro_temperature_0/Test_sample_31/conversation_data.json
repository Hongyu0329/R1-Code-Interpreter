    "To determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Identify the knot:** The provided image shows a knot with 6 crossings. By comparing it to standard knot diagrams, we can identify it as the **6₂ knot**. This is an alternating knot, meaning the crossings alternate between over and under as we trace the strand.\n2.  **Choose a calculation method:** For a reduced alternating diagram `D` of a knot `K`, the Rasmussen s-invariant can be calculated using a formula that relates it to two other knot invariants: the signature `σ(K)` and the writhe `w(D)`. The formula is:\n    `s(K) = σ(K) - w(D)`\n3.  **Determine the writhe `w(D)`:** The writhe is the sum of the signs of the crossings in the diagram. A crossing is assigned a +1 or -1 sign based on its orientation. In the given diagram for the 6₂ knot, all 6 crossings are negative (or left-handed). Therefore, the writhe is the sum of six -1s.\n    `w(D) = -6`\n4.  **Find the signature `σ(K)`:** The signature is a well-known integer invariant of a knot. For the 6₂ knot, the signature can be found in knot theory tables or databases.\n    `σ(6₂) = -2`\n5.  **Calculate the Rasmussen invariant:** We can now substitute the values for the signature and writhe into the formula.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints out the steps.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rasmussen_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Rasmussen invariant for the 6_2 knot.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the knot and state the formula.\n    knot_name = \"6_2\"\n    print(f\"The knot in the image is identified as the {knot_name} knot.\")\n    print(\"For an alternating knot, the Rasmussen invariant s(K) is calculated using the formula:\")\n    print(\"s(K) = sigma(K) - w(D)\")\n    print(\"where sigma(K) is the knot signature and w(D) is the writhe of the diagram.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Define the known values for the 6_2 knot.\n    # The signature of the 6_2 knot is -2.\n    signature = -2\n    # The writhe of the given diagram is -6, as all 6 crossings are negative.\n    writhe = -6\n\n    print(f\"For the {knot_name} knot:\")\n    print(f\" - The signature sigma({knot_name}) is {signature}.\")\n    print(f\" - The writhe w(D) of the given diagram is {writhe}.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the Rasmussen invariant.\n    rasmussen_invariant = signature - writhe\n\n    # Step 4: Print the final calculation.\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\")\n    # The final equation must show each number.\n    print(f\"s({knot_name}) = {signature} - ({writhe}) = {rasmussen_invariant}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe Rasmussen invariant of the {knot_name} knot is {rasmussen_invariant}.\")\n\ncalculate_rasmussen_invariant()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
