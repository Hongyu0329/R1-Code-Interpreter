    "Based on the visual evidence in the image sequence, the process being depicted is the change in the direction of growth of a filamentous cell, such as a fungal hypha. I will provide a Python script to describe this process in detail.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Define a function that holds the description of the biological process.\n2.  The description will explain the step-by-step changes observed from panel L to M to N.\n3.  The key events are the initial straight growth, the formation of a lateral bulge, and the subsequent bending as the bulge becomes the new growing tip.\n4.  The script will then call this function to print the detailed explanation.\n\n```python\ndef explain_biological_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function explains the biological process shown in the image sequence.\n  \"\"\"\n  process_name = \"Reorientation of tip growth\"\n  \n  print(f\"The process depicted in the image is the '{process_name}' in a filamentous cell, likely a fungal hypha.\")\n  print(\"\\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the sequence (L -> M -> N):\")\n  \n  # Step 1: Panel L\n  print(\"1. Panel L: The image shows a filament growing in a straight, upward direction. This is characteristic of normal apical (tip) growth. The arrowhead points to a septum (a cross-wall between cells).\")\n  \n  # Step 2: Panel M\n  print(\"2. Panel M: A small bulge begins to form on the side of the filament, just below the tip and near the septum indicated by the arrowhead. This marks the initiation of a new growth point.\")\n  \n  # Step 3: Panel N\n  print(\"3. Panel N: The bulge has enlarged significantly and has now become the new active growing tip. As a result, the filament has bent, changing its overall direction of growth.\")\n  \n  print(\"\\nIn summary, the sequence illustrates how a filamentous organism can alter its growth path by establishing a new site of polarized growth, leading to a change in direction or the formation of a branch.\")\n\nexplain_biological_process()\n```\n<<<Reorientation of tip growth>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
