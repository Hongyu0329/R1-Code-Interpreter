  print("2. Panel M: A small bulge begins to form on the side of the filament, just below the tip and near the septum indicated by the arrowhead. This marks the initiation of a new growth point.")
  
  # Step 3: Panel N
  print("3. Panel N: The bulge has enlarged significantly and has now become the new active growing tip. As a result, the filament has bent, changing its overall direction of growth.")
  
  print("\nIn summary, the sequence illustrates how a filamentous organism can alter its growth path by establishing a new site of polarized growth, leading to a change in direction or the formation of a branch.")
