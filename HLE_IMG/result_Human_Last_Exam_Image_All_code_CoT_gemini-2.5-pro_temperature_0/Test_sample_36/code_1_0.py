    # Analysis of DIKW Model
    print("\n1. DIKW Model (Data -> Information -> Knowledge -> Wisdom):")
    print("   - Applicability: Strong. VVA can collect sales data (e.g., conversion rates per stage).")
    print("   - Example: Analyzing data on which sales script phrases lead to more meetings (Data -> Information) allows the creation of a more effective, standardized script (Knowledge).")
    print("   - Verdict: Highly relevant for a data-driven improvement of sales assets like 'VA Sales List' and 'VA Sales Script'.")

    # Analysis of SECI Model
    print("\n2. SECI Model (Socialization -> Externalization -> Combination -> Internalization):")
    print("   - Applicability: Strong. VVA needs to capture the skills of its experienced employees.")
    print("   - Example: An experienced salesperson's successful negotiation tactics (tacit knowledge) can be documented (Externalization) into a 'Best Practices for Negotiation' guide (explicit knowledge) for the whole team.")
    print("   - Verdict: Highly relevant for capturing human expertise and improving team-wide performance and assets like 'VA Deals' templates.")

    # Analysis of Bloom's Taxonomy
    print("\n3. Bloom's Taxonomy:")
    print("   - Applicability: Weak. This is an educational framework for individual learning, not an organizational KM model.")
    print("   - Example: It can structure how a single new employee learns the sales script, but it doesn't manage the creation or improvement of the script itself for the organization.")
    print("   - Verdict: Not the primary model for this organizational goal.")

    # Final Conclusion
    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The sales process benefits from both data analysis and the sharing of human expertise.")
    print("DIKW provides the framework for the data-driven approach.")
    print("SECI provides the framework for capturing and spreading the team's skills and experience.")
    print("Therefore, using both models in conjunction will provide the most comprehensive and effective solution to boost and maintain sales results.")

    # Final Answer
    print("\nThe most suitable choice is the combination of the DIKW and SECI models.")
