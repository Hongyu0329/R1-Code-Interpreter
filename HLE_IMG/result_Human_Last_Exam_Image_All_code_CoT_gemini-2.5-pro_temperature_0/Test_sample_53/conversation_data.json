    "This is a depiction of a famous Greek myth on an Apulian red-figure vase. My plan is to identify the mythological scene by analyzing the characters and their actions, and then name the specific figure requested.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scene:** The image shows a chariot with a driver and a passenger. A winged figure flies overhead, and a man lies defeated on the ground below the chariot.\n2.  **Identify the Myth:** This collection of figures points to the myth of the chariot race between Pelops and King Oenomaus. The king would race any suitor for the hand of his daughter, Hippodamia. Pelops won the race, leading to Oenomaus's death.\n3.  **Identify the Figures:**\n    *   The driver of the chariot is the hero **Pelops**.\n    *   The figure being carried away in the chariot is **Hippodamia**.\n    *   The man lying on the ground is the defeated **King Oenomaus**.\n    *   The winged figure is **Nike**, the goddess of Victory, signifying Pelops's triumph.\n4.  **Answer the Question:** The question asks to identify the figure leaving (or being carried from) the chariot. Based on the myth, this is Hippodamia.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to state this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef identify_figure():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the figures in the mythological scene depicted on the vase.\n    The scene is the chariot race between Pelops and Oenomaus.\n    \"\"\"\n    driver = \"Pelops\"\n    passenger = \"Hippodamia\"\n    fallen_man = \"King Oenomaus\"\n    winged_figure = \"Nike (Victory)\"\n\n    print(\"The scene on the vase depicts the myth of Pelops and Hippodamia.\")\n    print(f\"The driver of the chariot is the hero, {driver}.\")\n    print(f\"The man defeated on the ground is {fallen_man}, Hippodamia's father.\")\n    print(f\"The winged figure celebrating the win is {winged_figure}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"The figure being carried away in the chariot is: {passenger}\")\n\nidentify_figure()\n```\n<<<Hippodamia>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
