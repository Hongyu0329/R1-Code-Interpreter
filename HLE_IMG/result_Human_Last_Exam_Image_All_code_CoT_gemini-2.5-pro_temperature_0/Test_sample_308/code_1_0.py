def solve_roller_puzzle():
    """
    Solves the roller drive matching puzzle by analyzing the geometry and motion curves.

    The core logic is as follows:
    1. The number of lobes on the driving (green) roller determines the number of
       speed variation cycles in the displacement plot.
    2. The shape of the rollers (sharp vs. smooth) determines the magnitude and
       abruptness of the speed variation. Sharper features lead to more extreme
       and less smooth changes in the slope of the displacement curve.

    Matching based on cycle count:
    - 2 Cycles (Plot C) -> Config 3 (2-lobe driver)
    - 3 Cycles (Plots A, H) -> Configs 1, 8 (3-lobe drivers)
    - 4 Cycles (Plots D, G) -> Configs 4, 6 (4-lobe drivers)
    - 5 Cycles (Plot F) -> Config 7 (5-lobe driver)
    - 6 Cycles (Plots B, E) -> Configs 2, 5 (6-lobe drivers)

    Differentiating within groups:
    - 3-Cycle Group: Config 1 has sharper features and greater radius variation than Config 8.
      This corresponds to Plot A having more extreme slope changes than Plot H.
      So, A->1, H->8.
    - 4-Cycle Group: Config 4 has sharper features than Config 6.
      This corresponds to Plot D having sharper "knees" than the smoother Plot G.
      So, D->4, G->6.
    - 6-Cycle Group: Config 2 (6:3 lobe ratio) is more harmonic than Config 5 (6:4 ratio).
      This corresponds to Plot B being more regular than Plot E.
      So, B->2, E->5.

    Final Mapping (Plot -> Config):
    A: 1
    B: 2
    C: 3
    D: 4
    E: 5
    F: 7
    G: 6
    H: 8
