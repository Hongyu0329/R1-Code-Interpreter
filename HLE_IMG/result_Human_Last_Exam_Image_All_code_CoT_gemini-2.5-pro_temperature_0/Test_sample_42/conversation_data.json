    "This is an Eastern Orthodox icon, specifically a fresco. To identify the saint, we can look at several key features:\n\n1.  **Iconography:** The figure is an elderly, bearded man, dressed in monastic robes and holding a scroll. This is a common depiction for a venerable monastic saint or a prophet.\n2.  **Inscription:** There is a faint inscription in Old Church Slavonic in the upper right corner. While difficult to read, the visible letters are consistent with the name \"СИМЕОНЪ\" (Simeon).\n3.  **Historical Context:** This specific fresco is a famous work from the Snetogorsky Monastery in Pskov, Russia, painted around 1313. It is widely identified by art historians and religious sources as a depiction of Saint Simeon Stylites the Elder.\n\nBased on the inscription and the known origin of the fresco, the person depicted is Saint Simeon Stylites.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the saint depicted in the icon.\n    \n    1.
