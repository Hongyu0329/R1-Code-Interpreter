    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my step-by-step plan to identify the authors of the nine artworks:\n\n1.  **Analyze Each Artwork:** I will examine each of the nine artworks in the grid, moving from left to right and top to bottom.\n2.  **Identify Signatures and Seals:** For each piece, I will look for signatures, seals, or inscriptions. The provided OCR text and zoomed-in crops will be helpful here.\n3.  **Recognize Artistic Style:** If a signature is not clear or present, I will identify the artist based on the unique style, subject matter, and techniques used in the artwork, comparing them to the known works of famous Chinese artists.\n4.  **Compile the List:** I will compile a list of the nine authors in the correct order.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will create a Python script to print the list of identified authors as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to display the authors:\n```python\ndef identify_authors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the authors of the nine artworks.\n    \"\"\"\n    authors = [\n        \"1. Huang Zhou (黄胄)\",\n        \"2. Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)\",\n        \"3. Mao Zedong (毛泽东)\",\n        \"4. Xu Beihong (徐悲鸿)\",\n        \"5. Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)\",\n        \"6. Lin Fengmian (林风眠)\",\n        \"7. Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)\",\n        \"8. Li Keran (李可染)\",\n        \"9. Qi Baishi (齐白石)\"\n    ]\n\n    print(\"From left to right, top to bottom, the authors of the 9 works are:\")\n    for author in authors:\n        print(author)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    identify_authors()\n```\n<<<Huang Zhou, Wu Guanzhong, Mao Zedong, Xu Beihong, Jin Shangyi, Lin Fengmian, Wu Guanzhong, Li Keran, Qi Baishi>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Based on the information (e.g., style), please tell me, from left to right, from top to bottom, who is the author of each of the 9 works?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
