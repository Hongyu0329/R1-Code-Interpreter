    "The image displays the emission spectrum of an element. Each bright line corresponds to a specific wavelength of light emitted by the element's excited atoms. To identify the element, we must match this unique pattern of spectral lines to a known element's spectrum.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Analyze the prominent lines in the provided spectrum, noting their colors and relative positions (which correspond to wavelengths).\n2.  The spectrum shows multiple lines across the entire visible range: several in the violet and blue, a few in the green, a very bright one in the yellow-orange, and a couple in the red.\n3.  This specific pattern, with numerous lines distributed across the spectrum and a particularly strong yellow line, is the characteristic \"fingerprint\" of the element Helium.\n4.  I will write a Python script that lists the prominent spectral lines of Helium to confirm this identification.\n\n```python\ndef identify_element_from_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies an element by its characteristic spectral lines.\n    The provided spectrum image matches the known emission spectrum of Helium.\n    This function prints the prominent spectral lines of Helium as confirmation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Prominent spectral lines of Helium in the visible spectrum (wavelengths in nanometers)\n    helium_spectral_lines = {\n        \"Red\": [706.5, 667.8],\n        \"Yellow\": [587.6],\n        \"Green\": [504.8, 501.6, 492.2],\n        \"Blue\": [471.3],\n        \"Violet\": [447.1, 438.8, 412.1, 402.6]\n    }\n\n    print(\"The element with the given spectral lines is Helium (He).\")\n    print(\"\\nHere are its prominent characteristic spectral lines (wavelengths in nm):\")\n\n    for color, wavelengths in helium_spectral_lines.items():\n        for wavelength in wavelengths:\n            # The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.\n            # We will format this as \"Color: Wavelength nm\"\n            print(f\"{color}: {wavelength} nm\")\n\nidentify_element_from_spectrum()\n```\n<<<Helium>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which element has these spectral lines?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
