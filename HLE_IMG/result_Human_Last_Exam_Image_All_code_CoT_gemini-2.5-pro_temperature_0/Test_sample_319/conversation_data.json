    "This image illustrates a well-known auditory illusion. Here is my plan to identify it:\n\n1.  **Analyze the visual data:** The image contains two graphs. The top graph is a spectrogram, which visualizes sound frequencies over time. It shows a continuous, single-frequency tone (the horizontal line) that is interrupted by a short burst of broadband noise (the vertical smudge). The bottom graph shows the corresponding audio waveform. It begins as a smooth, regular sine wave (the pure tone), then becomes highly irregular and chaotic (the noise), and then continues.\n2.  **Interpret the perceptual effect:** This setup is a classic demonstration of how the brain processes sound. When a sound, like a tone or speech, is briefly replaced by a plausible interrupting sound (like noise or a cough), the human brain often perceives the original sound as continuing uninterrupted *through* the noise. The brain essentially \"fills in\" the missing auditory information.\n3.  **Name the phenomenon:** This perceptual filling-in is called the **Auditory Continuity Illusion** or **Temporal Induction**. A famous specific example involving speech is the Phonemic Restoration Effect. Given the image depicts a simple tone, the more general term is the most appropriate.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print the name of this phenomenon.\n\n```python\ndef identify_phenomenon():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the auditory illusion\n    depicted in the image.\n\n    The image shows a continuous tone interrupted by a burst of noise.\n    Listeners typically perceive the tone as continuing through the noise,\n    an effect known as the Auditory Continuity Illusion.\n    \"\"\"\n    phenomenon_name = \"Auditory Continuity Illusion\"\n    print(f\"The phenomenon shown in the image is called: {phenomenon_name}\")\n\nidentify_phenomenon()\n```\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion>>>"
