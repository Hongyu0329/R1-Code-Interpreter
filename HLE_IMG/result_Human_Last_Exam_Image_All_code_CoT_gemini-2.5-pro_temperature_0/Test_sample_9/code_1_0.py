# The program in the image is a modified version of the famous Piet "Hello, world!" program.
# The modifications break the program, causing it to loop without printing anything.
# However, the question asks for the *intended* output, which is "Hello, world!".
# The following code formats this intended output as per the instructions.

# 1. The intended string.
intended_string = "Hello, world!"

# 2. Convert the string to all lowercase characters.
lowercase_string = intended_string.lower()

# 3. Reverse the lowercase string.
final_string = lowercase_string[::-1]

# 4. Print the final result.
print(final_string)
