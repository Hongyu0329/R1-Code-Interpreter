    This function identifies the correct image by analyzing key features.
    
    1.  The target nyala has a unique pattern of white spots on its rear flank.
    2.  There is a distinct cluster of four spots: three forming a small triangle and one just above them.
    3.  Comparing this specific spot pattern with all the options, image D shows the exact same configuration of spots.
    4.  The horn shape and stripe pattern in image D also match the target.
    5.  Therefore, image D shows the same nyala as the target image.
