    # --- Step 1: Deducing component dimensions (r, w_g, h_g) ---
    # From the dialogue, we have two key area ratios:
    # A_circles / A_total ≈ 0.7352
    # A_green / A_total ≈ 0.04
    # From this, we derive the ratio of the areas of the objects themselves:
    # A_circles / A_green ≈ 0.7352 / 0.04 = 18.38
    #
    # Let r be the circle radius, w_g and h_g be the green rectangle dimensions.
    # A_circles = 10 * pi * r^2
    # A_green = w_g * h_g
    # (10 * pi * r^2) / (w_g * h_g) ≈ 18.38
    #
    # From the image, we can assume the height of the green rectangle is the diameter of a circle.
    # h_g = 2r
    #
    # Substituting this in:
    # (10 * pi * r^2) / (w_g * 2r) ≈ 18.38
    # (5 * pi * r) / w_g ≈ 18.38
    # r / w_g ≈ 18.38 / (5 * pi) ≈ 1.17
    #
    # We need to find integers r and w_g that satisfy this ratio.
    # By testing small integers for w_g, we find that w_g=6 gives r≈7.02.
    # This makes the integer pair (r=7, w_g=6) the most likely solution.
    r = 7
