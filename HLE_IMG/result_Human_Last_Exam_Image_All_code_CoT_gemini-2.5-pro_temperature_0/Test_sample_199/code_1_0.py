The object shown in the image is a large scientific instrument from the 18th century.
It features a hand crank with wooden handles, a central mechanism, and a large brass sphere.
This configuration is characteristic of an early electrostatic generator.
The crank was used to rotate a glass element (disc or cylinder) to generate static electricity through friction.
The large brass sphere served as the prime conductor to accumulate the high-voltage charge for experiments.
Therefore, the correct identification is an Electrostatic Generator.
