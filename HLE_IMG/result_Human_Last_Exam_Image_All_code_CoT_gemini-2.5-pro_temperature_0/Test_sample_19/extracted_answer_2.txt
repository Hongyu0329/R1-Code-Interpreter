1. The music modulates to E major in measure 11 and the beginning of measure 12.
2. The home key is C# minor (as indicated by the 4 sharps and the piece's tonic). E major is the relative major of C# minor. Modulating to the relative major is one of the most common modulations in tonal music because the two keys are so closely related, sharing the same key signature.
3. The chord on the first beat of measure 11 is a B minor chord (B-D natural-F#). This chord functions as the minor dominant of the new key, E major. Since E major is the mediant (III) of the home key C# minor, the complete and accurate Roman numeral marking is v/III (the minor dominant of the mediant).
