    "Based on my analysis of the runic inscription in the image, I have identified the specific Ingvar runestone. The runes and their arrangement in horizontal bands are characteristic of a particular stone.\n\nThe visible runes in the fragment correspond to parts of the inscription on the runestone designated as **Sö 287**.\n\n- The top row shows `...uk x þur...`, which is part of `Þorstæinn ok Þorkell...` (Þorsteinn and Þorkell...).\n- The middle row shows `...rþu x kuml...`, part of `gærðu kumbl...` (made the monument...).\n- The bottom row shows `...R x Þur...`, part of `æftiR Þorstæin...` (in memory of Þorsteinn...).\n\nThis confirms the identity of the stone. The following Python code will print the ID for you.\n\n```python\ndef find_runestone_id():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the ID of the Ingvar runestone from the image.\n    The identification is based on matching the visible runic inscription\n    to known Ingvar runestones. The fragment matches the stone Sö 287.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The ID of a Swedish runestone consists of a province code and a number.\n    province_code = \"Sö\"\n    stone_number = 287\n    \n    print(\"The ID of the Ingvar runestone is composed of a province code and a number.\")\n    print(f\"Province Code: {province_code}\")\n    print(f\"Stone Number: {stone_number}\")\n    print(f\"The full ID of the runestone is: {province_code} {stone_number}\")\n\nfind_runestone_id()\n```\n<<<Sö 287>>>"
