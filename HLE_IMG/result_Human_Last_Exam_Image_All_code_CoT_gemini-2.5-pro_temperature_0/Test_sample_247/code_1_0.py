    print("The underlying cause is likely something that can fill the pericardial sac rapidly, such as bleeding (hemopericardium).\n")

    print("Step 2: Evaluating the Answer Choices")
    print("A. Hypothyroidism: Can cause effusion, but it's typically slow to accumulate and non-hemorrhagic. This is less likely.")
    print("B. Arteriovenous fistula (AV fistula): This is an abnormal connection between an artery and a vein. If such a fistula were located on or near the heart and ruptured, it would cause rapid, high-pressure bleeding into the pericardial sac. This mechanism perfectly explains the acute, massive effusion and tamponade seen in the image.")
    print("C. Multiple myeloma: A rare cause of pericardial effusion.")
    print("D. Polycythemia vera: Not a typical cause of massive effusion.")
