    "Here is my plan to find the 2-move checkmate:\n1.  **Analyze the initial position:** The Black King on e4 is heavily restricted by White's pieces. Its potential escape squares (d3, d4, f3, f5) are all under attack.\n2.  **Find the first move (Move 1):** I will look for a forcing move, like a check, that limits Black's options. The most promising check is `Rf4+`. This move forces the Black King to capture the Rook (`Kxf4`), as all other squares are controlled and the check cannot be blocked.\n3.  **Analyze the position after Black's forced move:** With the Black King now on f4, I will find a second move for White that delivers a check from which the King cannot escape.\n4.  **Find the second move (Move 2):** I will move the Knight from e7 to d6 (`Nfd6#`). This move places the Black King in check. I will verify that all of the King's escape squares are covered by White's pieces, the checking Knight cannot be captured, and the check cannot be blocked. This confirms the checkmate.\n5.  **Construct the code:** I will write a Python script that prints out the two-move sequence clearly, including the move numbers as requested.\n\n```python\n# It's White's turn to move, and the goal is to find a checkmate in 2 moves.\n\n# 1. White's first move: The Rook on f3 captures the pawn on f4, delivering a check.\n#    1. Rf4+\n#    This is a forcing move. The Black King on e4 is in check.\n#    - The King cannot move to d3 (attacked by Bishop on g1).\n#    - The King cannot move to f5 (attacked by Rook on h5).\n#    - The check cannot be blocked.\n#    - Black's only legal move is to capture the Rook.\n#    1... Kxf4\n\n# 2. White's second move: The Knight on e7 moves to d6, delivering checkmate.\n#    2. Nfd6#\n#    The Black King on f4 is now in check by the Knight on d6. This is checkmate because:\n#    - The checking piece (Knight) cannot be captured.\n#    - The check cannot be blocked.\n#    - The King has no escape squares:\n#      - e5 and f3 are attacked by the Knight on d6.\n#      - d4 and d5 are attacked by the Queen on a4.\n#      - e3 and d3 are attacked by the Bishop on g1.\n#      - f5 and g5 are attacked by the Rook on h5.\n#      - g4, g3, and g5 are attacked by the King on h4.\n#      - g3 is also attacked by the Bishop on g2.\n\nprint(\"The 2-move checkmate is:\")\nprint(\"1. Rf4+ Kxf4\")\nprint(\"2. Nfd6#\")\n```\n<<<1. Rf4+ Kxf4 2. Nfd6#>>>"
