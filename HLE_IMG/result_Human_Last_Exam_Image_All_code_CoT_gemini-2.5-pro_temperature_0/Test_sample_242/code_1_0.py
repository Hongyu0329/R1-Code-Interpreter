    # 1. R1 and R2 must be H; R3 and R4 must be Me. This eliminates options A, B, F.
    # 2. The trans-to-cis conversion of the methyl groups is explained by epimerization,
    #    leading to R3 = Me DOWN and R4 = Me DOWN. This is consistent with options C, D, E.

    #    single carbon both pointing in the same direction (UP/UP or DOWN/DOWN).
    # 4. Option E is the only remaining choice that is both mechanistically plausible and geometrically sound.
