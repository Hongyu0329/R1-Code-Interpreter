1.  **Theme 1: The Fading of Beliefs.** The image of a "lost small deity" presented as a ghostly, fading figure directly points to the theme of old religious or spiritual beliefs that have diminished and been forgotten over time. The deity is a remnant, a ghost of a past faith.

2.  **Theme 2: The Transient Nature of Existence.** The poem's line "Velvet fades" and the aged, decayed appearance of the photograph both speak to impermanence. The comparison to a "photochromic lens" further emphasizes the idea of change and transition. Everything—from physical objects (velvet) to beliefs (the deity) to life itself—is transient and passes away.

Conclusion: The most fitting answer combines these two central ideas.
