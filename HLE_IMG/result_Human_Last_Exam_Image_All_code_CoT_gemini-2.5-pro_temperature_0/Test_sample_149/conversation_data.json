    "This is a medical diagnosis question. I will provide the diagnosis based on the provided image and clinical information. I will not provide a code block as it is not relevant to this task.\n\n**Analysis of the Case:**\n\n1.  **Clinical Presentation:** A 28-year-old female with a mass in the sella turcica. This location is critical as it is adjacent to the sphenoid sinus and cavernous sinus, common pathways for the spread of infection.\n2.  **Histopathology:** The provided image is a tissue section stained with what appears to be Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), which highlights fungal elements in a bright magenta/purple color against a lighter background.\n    *   **Fungal Morphology:** The key features are the large, broad, ribbon-like fungal hyphae. These hyphae are notable for being \"pauciseptate\" or \"aseptate,\" meaning they have few or no cross-walls (septa).\n    *   **Branching Pattern:** The hyphae exhibit irregular, wide-angle, often right-angle (90-degree) branching.\n    *   **Inflammatory Response:** There is a significant inflammatory infiltrate in the background, composed of lymphocytes and other inflammatory cells, indicating the body's reaction to an invasive process.\n\n**Differential Diagnosis:**\n\n*   **Aspergillosis:** Caused by *Aspergillus* species. Histologically, *Aspergillus* typically shows thinner, septate hyphae that branch at acute angles (around 45 degrees). This is inconsistent with the broad, pauciseptate, right-angle branching hyphae seen in the image.\n*   **Candidiasis:** Caused by *Candida* species. This usually presents with yeast forms, pseudohyphae, and true hyphae. The hyphae are generally thinner than what is observed here.\n*   **Mucormycosis:** Caused by fungi in the order Mucorales (class Zygomycetes), such as *Rhizopus*, *Mucor*, and *Lichtheimia*. The classic histopathological features of mucormycosis are exactly what is seen in the image: broad (5-20 Âµm), pauciseptate or non-septate, ribbon-like hyphae with wide-angle, right-angle branching. These fungi have a predilection for invading blood vessels (angioinvasion), leading to thrombosis and tissue necrosis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of a mass in the sella turcica and the distinct histopathological findings of broad, pauciseptate hyphae with right-angle branching is pathognomonic for mucormycosis. This is a case of invasive fungal infection, likely rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis, which has extended into the sella.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
