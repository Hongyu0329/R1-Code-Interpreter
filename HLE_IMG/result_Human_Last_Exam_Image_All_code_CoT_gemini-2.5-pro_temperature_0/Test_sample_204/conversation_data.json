    "To solve this task, I will first identify each mineral specimen shown in the images (A, B, C, and D). Then, I will determine the silicate structural class for each identified mineral. Silicate minerals are classified based on how the silica tetrahedra (the basic SiOâ‚„ building block) are linked together. The complexity increases with the degree of polymerization or sharing of oxygen atoms between tetrahedra. The order of increasing complexity is generally:\n\n1.  **Nesosilicates (Isolated Tetrahedra):** No shared oxygens.\n2.  **Inosilicates (Chain Silicates):** Single or double chains of tetrahedra.\n3.  **Phyllosilicates (Sheet Silicates):** 2D sheets of tetrahedra.\n4.  **Tectosilicates (Framework Silicates):** 3D framework of tetrahedra.\n\nAfter classifying each specimen, I will arrange them in order from the least complex structure to the most complex structure. The Python code below will perform these steps and print the final ordered list.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mineral_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies mineral specimens, classifies their silicate structure,\n    and orders them by increasing structural complexity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify minerals and their silicate class with a complexity score.\n    # Complexity score: 1 (least complex) to 4 (most complex).\n    specimens = [\n        {'label': 'C', \n         'mineral': 'Olivine', \n         'class': 'Nesosilicate (Isolated Tetrahedra)', \n         'complexity': 1},\n        {'label': 'A', \n         'mineral': 'Pyroxene (e.g., Augite)', \n         'class': 'Inosilicate (Single Chain)', \n         'complexity': 2},\n        {'label': 'B', \n         'mineral': 'Mica (e.g., Muscovite)', \n         'class': 'Phyllosilicate (Sheet)', \n         'complexity': 3},\n        {'label': 'D', \n         'mineral': 'Quartz', \n         'class': 'Tectosilicate (Framework)', \n         'complexity': 4}\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Specimen Identification and Classification:\")\n    # Create a dictionary for easy lookup by label\n    specimen_dict = {s['label']: s for s in specimens}\n    for label in sorted(specimen_dict.keys()):\n        specimen = specimen_dict[label]\n        print(f\"Specimen {specimen['label']}: {specimen['mineral']} - a {specimen['class']}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*40 + \"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Sort the specimens by their structural complexity.\n    sorted_specimens = sorted(specimens, key=lambda x: x['complexity'])\n\n    # Step 4: Print the final ordered list.\n    print(\"Order of Increasing Silicate Structure Complexity:\")\n    \n    ordered_labels = [s['label'] for s in sorted_specimens]\n    \n    # Print the final equation-like format\n    output_string = \" -> \".join(ordered_labels)\n    print(output_string)\n\n    # Final answer format\n    final_answer = \",\".join(ordered_labels)\n    print(f\"\\n<<<C,A,B,D>>>\")\n\nsolve_mineral_puzzle()\n```"
