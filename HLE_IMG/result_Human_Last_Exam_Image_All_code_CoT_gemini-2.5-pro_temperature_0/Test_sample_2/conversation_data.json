    "To determine the time complexity of the given sorting algorithm, we need to analyze its behavior in the worst-case scenario.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Algorithm's Structure:** The algorithm is a recursive function `sort(a, n)`.\n    *   **Base Case:** If `n <= 1`, the function does nothing and returns. This takes constant time, `O(1)`.\n    *   **Recursive Step:** If `n > 1`, the function performs the following steps:\n        1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: A recursive call to sort the first `n-1` elements.\n        2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:`: A comparison.\n        3.  `swap(...)`: A potential swap operation.\n        4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: Another recursive call to sort the first `n-1` elements, conditional on the `if` statement.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation:** Let `T(n)` be the time taken by `sort(a, n)`.\n    *   The work done within a single call (excluding the recursive calls) is constant: one comparison and one potential swap. Let's denote this as `c`.\n    *   In the **worst case**, the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is always true, which means the `swap` and the second `sort(a, n - 1)` call are always executed.\n    *   Therefore, the time complexity in the worst case can be described by the recurrence relation:\n        `T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + c`\n        `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n\n3.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:** We can solve this relation by expansion:\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    *   After `k` steps: `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^0)`\n    *   We continue until we reach the base case `T(1)`. Let `k = n - 1`.\n    *   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-2) + ... + 1)`\n    *   The sum `1 + 2 + ... + 2^(n-2)` is a geometric series that equals `2^(n-1) - 1`.\n    *   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n    *   `T(n) = (T(1) + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\n4.  **Determine the Big-O Complexity:** The dominant term in the expression for `T(n)` is `2^(n-1)`. In Big-O notation, constant factors and lower-order terms are ignored.\n    *   `O(2^(n-1))` is equivalent to `O(2^n)`.\n\nTherefore, the worst-case time complexity of this algorithm is exponential.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this by implementing the algorithm and counting the number of function calls. The number of calls for an input of size `n` will be `2^n - 1` in the worst case, confirming the `O(2^n)` complexity.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Use a list to pass the counter by reference, allowing it to be modified\n# by the recursive function calls.\ncall_count = [0]\n\ndef swap(arr, i, j):\n    \"\"\"A helper function to swap two elements in an array.\"\"\"\n    arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n\ndef sort(a, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    The recursive sorting algorithm from the problem.\n    This implementation also counts the number of times it is called.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Increment the call counter each time the function is entered.\n    call_count[0] += 1\n\n    if n > 1:\n        # First recursive call on the first n-1 elements.\n        sort(a, n - 1)\n        \n        # Compare the last two elements of the current sub-array.\n        # Note: Python uses 0-based indexing, so a[n-1] is the nth element.\n        if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n            # Swap if the last element is smaller than the one before it.\n            swap(a, n - 1, n - 2)\n            # Second recursive call, which leads to exponential complexity.\n            sort(a, n - 1)\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to demonstrate the algorithm's complexity by counting calls.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Increase recursion limit for larger n, though we'll keep n small.\n    # sys.setrecursionlimit(3000)\n    \n    print(\"Analyzing the time complexity of the given recursive algorithm.\")\n    print(\"The recurrence relation for the number of calls in the worst case is T(n) = 2*T(n-1) + 1.\")\n    print(\"This solves to T(n) = 2^n - 1, which is O(2^n).\")\n    print(\"Let's verify this by counting the calls for different values of n.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"{'n':<5}{'Actual Calls':<20}{'Expected (2^n - 1)':<25}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Test for n from 1 to 15.\n    for n in range(1, 16):\n        # Reset the counter for each run.\n        global call_count\n        call_count = [0]\n        \n        # A reverse-sorted array is a worst-case input for this algorithm.\n        arr = list(range(n, 0, -1))\n        \n        # Run the sort. We are interested in the call count, not the sorted result.\n        sort(arr, n)\n        \n        # The theoretical number of calls is 2^n - 1.\n        expected_calls = 2**n - 1\n        \n        print(f\"{n:<5}{call_count[0]:<20}{expected_calls:<25}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
