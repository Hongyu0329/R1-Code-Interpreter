    "Based on the visual characteristics of the plant, particularly the distinct reticulated veining on the dark green leaves, the plant can be identified as *Daphne jezoensis*.\n\nThe specific epithet *jezoensis* refers to \"Jezo\" (or Ezo), which is a historical name for a major island in Japan. This plant is native to that island and the nearby Sakhalin island. The code below will print the modern name of the island \"Jezo\".\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the plant and the island it is endemic to.\n    \n    1. The plant in the image is identified as Daphne jezoensis based on its unique\n       leaf morphology, specifically the reticulated (net-like) veins.\n    2. The specific epithet 'jezoensis' refers to 'Jezo' or 'Ezo', which is the\n       former name for a large island in Japan.\n    3.
