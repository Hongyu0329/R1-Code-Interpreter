    This function identifies the correct statements based on the analysis of the provided plots and chemical engineering principles.
    
    - Step 1: Pair the plots based on axis ranges.
      - Pair 1: (1, 4)
      - Pair 2: (2, 6)
      - Pair 3: (3, 5)
    
    - Step 2: Evaluate statements 1-6 about pairings.
      - Statements 1, 2, 4, 6 are incorrect as they propose invalid pairings.
      - Statements 3 and 5 are correct, which assigns:
        - System (C) to plots (1, 4)
        - System (B) to plots (3, 5)
        - System (A) to plots (2, 6)
        
    - Step 3: Evaluate statements 7-12 about the Lewis number.
      - The answer choice that includes statements 3 and 5 is J: {3, 5, 10}.
      - This implies statement 10 is correct: The set of plots with the higher Lewis number is {3, 4, 6}.
      
    - Step 4: Verify consistency.
      - For System B (pair 3,5), high Le (plot 3) is stabilizing. (Standard behavior)
      - For System C (pair 1,4), high Le (plot 4) is destabilizing. (Inverted behavior)
      - For System A (pair 2,6), high Le (plot 6) is destabilizing. (Inverted behavior)
      - This scenario, while complex, is physically plausible and provides a consistent explanation for the answer choice J.
