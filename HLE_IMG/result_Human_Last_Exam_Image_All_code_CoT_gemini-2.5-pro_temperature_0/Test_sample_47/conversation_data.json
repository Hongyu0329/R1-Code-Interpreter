    "To find the current I, we need to analyze the electrical circuit. The drawing can be interpreted as a bridge-like circuit. I will use nodal analysis to solve for the unknown voltages and then find the current I.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Model the Circuit**: I will interpret the circuit diagram as follows:\n    *   The 76 Ω and 8 Ω resistors are in parallel. Their equivalent resistance is connected between the 41 V source and a central node, let's call it `Node L`.\n    *   The 11 Ω resistor is connected between the 41 V source and another central node, `Node R`.\n    *   The 29 Ω resistor is connected between `Node R` and the ground (0 V).\n    *   The 14 Ω resistor connects `Node L` and `Node R`.\n    *   The current `I` is the current flowing through the 14 Ω resistor from `Node L` to `Node R`.\n\n2.  **Nodal Analysis**:\n    *   Calculate the equivalent resistance of the parallel 76 Ω and 8 Ω resistors.\n    *   Set up two equations for the two unknown node voltages, `V_L` and `V_R`, using Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL).\n    *   Solve the system of two linear equations to find `V_L` and `V_R`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Current I**:\n    *   Once `V_L` and `V_R` are known, calculate the current `I` flowing through the 14 Ω resistor using Ohm's Law: `I = (V_L - V_R) / 14`.\n\nThis approach allows us to systematically solve for the desired current.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_circuit():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the given electrical circuit to find the current I.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define circuit parameters\n    V_source = 41  # V\n    R76 = 76       # Ohms\n    R8 = 8         # Ohms\n    R14 = 14       # Ohms\n    R11 = 11       # Ohms\n    R29 = 29       # Ohms\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the equivalent resistance of the parallel resistors on the left\n    R_L_equiv = (R76 * R8) / (R76 + R8)\n\n    # Step 3: Set up the system of linear equations for nodal analysis (A*x = b)\n    # The unknowns are x = [V_L, V_R]\n    # KCL at Node L: (V_source - V_L)/R_L_equiv + (V_R - V_L)/R14 = 0\n    # KCL at Node R: (V_source - V_R)/R11 + (V_L - V_R)/R14 + (0 - V_R)/R29 = 0\n    # Rearranging into matrix form:\n    # Eq1: V_L * (1/R_L_equiv + 1/R14) - V_R * (1/R14) = V_source / R_L_equiv\n    # Eq2: -V_L * (1/R14) + V_R * (1/R11 + 1/R14 + 1/R29) = V_source / R11\n    \n    A = np.array([\n        [1/R_L_equiv + 1/R14, -1/R14],\n        [-1/R14, 1/R11 + 1/R14 + 1/R29]\n    ])\n    \n    b = np.array([\n        V_source / R_L_equiv,\n        V_source / R11\n    ])\n\n    # Step 4: Solve for the node voltages V_L and V_R\n    try:\n        voltages = np.linalg.solve(A, b)\n        V_L = voltages[0]\n        V_R = voltages[1]\n    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n        print(\"The system of equations is singular.
