Based on the diagram, the protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the extracellular domain of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE). This domain is shown to be composed of V, C1, and C2 sub-domains, with S100B directly interacting with this extracellular portion.

S100B could be used as both an adjunct and a prognostic marker for neurological disorders.

As an adjunct marker: The text states that S100B is over-expressed in several neurological disorders. Its presence and concentration can be measured alongside other clinical findings to help confirm the presence of active neuroinflammatory processes, which are central to these diseases.

As a prognostic marker: The S100B-RAGE signaling pathway directly leads to detrimental outcomes such as apoptosis (cell death), neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Therefore, higher levels of S100B would likely correlate with more severe activation of these damaging pathways, indicating a more aggressive disease progression and a poorer prognosis for the patient.
