    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we need to assign R or S configuration to each of the three chiral centers using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Chiral Centers:** Locate the three stereocenters in the molecule. We will label them C2, C3, and C4 from left to right, which corresponds to the correct IUPAC numbering.\n2.  **Assign Priorities:** For each chiral center, rank the four attached groups from highest (1) to lowest (4) priority based on atomic number.\n3.  **Determine 3D Orientation:** Interpret the wedge and dash bonds. A wedge indicates a bond coming out of the plane, and a dash indicates a bond going into the plane. We will assume the standard convention where implicit hydrogen atoms are on the opposite side of the drawn substituent.\n4.  **Assign R/S Configuration:**\n    *   Orient the molecule so the lowest priority group (4) points away from the viewer.\n    *   Trace the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   If the path is clockwise, the configuration is R.\n    *   If the path is counter-clockwise, the configuration is S.\n    *   If the lowest priority group points towards the viewer, the result is reversed.\n\nThe following Python code will print out the step-by-step analysis.\n\n```python\ndef determine_absolute_configuration():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script outlines the step-by-step process to determine the absolute\n    configuration of the chiral centers in the provided molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Determining the absolute configuration of the molecule:\")\n    print(\"The molecule has three chiral centers.
