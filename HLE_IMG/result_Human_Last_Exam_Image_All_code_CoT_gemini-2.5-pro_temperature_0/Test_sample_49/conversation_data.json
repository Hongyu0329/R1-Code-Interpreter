    "To determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$, we first need to find the Thevenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, seen by the capacitor $C$. The cutoff frequency, $f_c$, for this RC circuit is then given by the formula $f_c = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi R_{th} C}$.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  Calculate the equivalent resistance of the infinite ladder network, which we'll call $R_{ladder}$. This is the resistance looking into any section of the infinite ladder (e.g., to the right of nodes $c_1$ and $d_1$). We can find this by setting up a self-consistent equation, since adding one more section to an infinite ladder does not change its total resistance.\n2.  Simplify the circuit by replacing the infinite part of the ladder with the calculated $R_{ladder}$.\n3.  Calculate the Thevenin resistance $R_{th}$ at node $a_0$ with respect to ground. To do this, we'll ground the input source `IN`, which means node $c_0$ is connected to ground.\n4.  Substitute the derived $R_{th}$ into the cutoff frequency formula to get the final expression in terms of $r$ and $C$.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform the symbolic algebra required to solve for the resistances and derive the final formula for the cutoff frequency.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_cutoff_frequency():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function symbolically derives the cutoff frequency for the given ladder network.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbols for resistance, capacitance, and the ladder's equivalent resistance\n    r, C, R_ladder = sp.symbols('r C R_ladder', positive=True, real=True)\n\n    # --- Step 1: Find the equivalent resistance of the infinite ladder (R_ladder) ---\n    # The ladder's resistance is described by the recursive formula:\n    # R_ladder = r (series) + r (series) + (r (shunt) || R_ladder (next section))\n    # R_ladder = 2*r + (r * R_ladder) / (r + R_ladder)\n    # This leads to a quadratic equation for R_ladder:\n    # R_ladder^2 - 2*r*R_ladder - 2*r^2 = 0\n    equation = sp.Eq(R_ladder**2 - 2*r*R_ladder - 2*r**2, 0)\n    solutions = sp.solve(equation, R_ladder)\n\n    # Resistance must be positive, so we take the positive root.\n    # The solutions are r*(1 - sqrt(3)) and r*(1 + sqrt(3)).\n    R_ladder_sol = solutions[1]\n\n    # --- Step 2: Find the Thevenin resistance (R_th) at node a0 ---\n    # To find R_th, the input source is grounded (c0 is at ground potential).\n    # R_th is the resistance from a0 to ground. It consists of one resistor 'r'\n    # (from a0 to c0) in parallel with the rest of the network seen from a0.\n    #\n    # The resistance of the other path from a0 is: r (from a0 to d1) in series\n    # with the resistance from d1 to ground (R_d1_gnd).\n    #\n    # Resistance from d1 to ground (R_d1_gnd):\n    # This path goes from d1 to c1, then from c1 to ground.\n    # The resistance between d1 and c1 is the first shunt resistor 'r' in parallel with R_ladder.\n    R_d1c1 = (r * R_ladder_sol) / (r + R_ladder_sol)\n    # The resistance from c1 to ground is 'r'.\n    R_d1_gnd = R_d1c1 + r\n\n    # The total resistance of the path starting from a0 through d1 is:\n    R_path_d1 = r + R_d1_gnd\n\n    # R_th is 'r' (from a0 to ground) in parallel with R_path_d1\n    R_th = (r * R_path_d1) / (r + R_path_d1)\n    R_th_simplified = sp.simplify(R_th) # This evaluates to r*(sqrt(3) - 1)\n\n    # --- Step 3: Determine the cutoff frequency (f_c) ---\n    # The cutoff frequency for an RC low-pass filter is f_c = 1 / (2 * pi * R_th * C)\n    \n    print(\"The analysis of the circuit yields the following results:\")\n    print(f\"1.
