    "To determine which of the four Iridium(III) complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), we need to analyze their molecular structures and relate them to known degradation pathways. The stability, and thus the operational lifetime, of these complexes is heavily influenced by the nature of their ligands.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Key Structural Differences:** Compare the ligands of the four complexes. All are of the type `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+`. The differences lie in the cyclometalating `C^N` ligand (phenylpyridine derivatives) and the diimine `N^N` ligand (bipyridine derivatives).\n2.  **Relate Structure to Stability:** Two main factors contribute to the stability of these emitters:\n    *   **Fluorination of the `C^N` ligand:** Fluorine atoms are electron-withdrawing. They strengthen the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond and make the complex more resistant to oxidation. Higher fluorination generally leads to longer lifetimes.\n    *   **Bulky Substituents on the `N^N` ligand:** Bulky groups, like the tert-butyl groups, provide steric hindrance. This protects the complex from intermolecular interactions and degradation reactions, particularly the dissociation of the `N^N` ligand, which is a common failure mode.\n3.  **Evaluate Each Complex:**\n    *   **Complex 1:** Has di-fluorinated `C^N` ligands and a `N^N` ligand with bulky tert-butyl groups. This combination represents a highly stable design.\n    *   **Complex 2:** Has stable di-fluorinated `C^N` ligands but lacks the bulky groups on its `N^N` ligand. This makes it susceptible to degradation via ligand dissociation.\n    *   **Complex 3:** Has bulky groups on its `N^N` ligand but its `C^N` ligands are only mono-fluorinated, making it less stable than Complex 1.\n    *   **Complex 4:** Has bulky groups on its `N^N` ligand but its `C^N` ligands are not fluorinated at all. This results in a weaker Ir-C bond and lower oxidation stability, leading to poor lifetime.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Complexes with significant structural features that promote degradation will have shorter lifetimes. Both the lack of fluorination (Complex 4) and the lack of bulky substituents (Complex 2) are major destabilizing factors. Therefore, Complexes 2 and 4 are expected to show the shortest lifetimes.\n\nThe following Python code implements this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_complex_stability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four Iridium complexes to identify which are expected to have shorter lifetimes\n    in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) based on their structural features.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the structural features of each complex\n    # C^N_stability: 2 (di-fluoro), 1 (mono-fluoro), 0 (non-fluoro)\n    # N^N_stability: 1 (bulky group), 0 (unsubstituted)\n    complexes = {\n        1: {'C^N_ligand': '2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine', 'N^N_ligand': \"4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine\", 'C^N_stability': 2, 'N^N_stability': 1},\n        2: {'C^N_ligand': '2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine', 'N^N_ligand': \"2,2'-bipyridine\", 'C^N_stability': 2, 'N^N_stability': 0},\n        3: {'C^N_ligand': '2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine', 'N^N_ligand': \"4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine\", 'C^N_stability': 1, 'N^N_stability': 1},\n        4: {'C^N_ligand': '2-phenylpyridine', 'N^N_ligand': \"4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine\", 'C^N_stability': 0, 'N^N_stability': 1}\n    }\n\n    print(\"### Analysis of Emitter Stability ###\\n\")\n    print(\"The operational lifetime of these Iridium emitters depends on two main structural factors:\\n\")\n    print(\"1.
