# Step 1: Assign indices based on physical analysis of the plots.
# n0: Base case (Plot 1)
# n1: 5x lower ΔP_a (Plot 4)
# n6: 5x lower μ (Plot 2)
n0 = 1
n1 = 4
n6 = 2

# Step 2: Determine the ratio of maximum velocities.
# Based on the provided conditions and the physics of the flow,
# the ratio v_a,max / v_t,max is approximated as ln(2).
# v_a_max_over_v_t_max = ln(2)
v_ratio = math.log(2)

# Step 3: Calculate the final expression.
# Expression: (n1 / n6)^n0 * exp(v_a,max / v_t,max)
result = (n1 / n6)**n0 * math.exp(v_ratio)

# Print the equation with the determined values
