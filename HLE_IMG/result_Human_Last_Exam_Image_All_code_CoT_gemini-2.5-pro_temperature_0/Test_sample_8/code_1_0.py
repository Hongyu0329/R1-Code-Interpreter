    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze the reference image and establish the viewpoint.
    # From Image 1 (SEM) and the text, we know:
    # - A new flagellum grows alongside the old one.
    # - The new flagellum's base is more posterior.
    # - The arrangement is chiral (has a fixed handedness).
    # - Images 2 and 3 are cross-sections viewed from the posterior to the anterior.

    # If we imagine looking down the cell from the posterior end (where the new flagellum starts)
