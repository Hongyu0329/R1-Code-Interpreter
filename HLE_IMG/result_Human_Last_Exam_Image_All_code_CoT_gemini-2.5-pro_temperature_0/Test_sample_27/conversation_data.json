    "My plan is to identify the artist's name by carefully examining the signature on the painting.\n\n1.  I will look at the bottom-right corner of the original image and the provided crops to find the artist's signature.\n2.  The last crop shows the signature most clearly. It reads \"Augusto Pinaud\" and is dated \"'39\".\n3.  I will then write a Python script to print the full name of the artist.\n\n```python\n# This script will print the full name of the artist who created the painting.\nartist_full_name = \"Augusto Pinaud\"\nprint(artist_full_name)\n```\n<<<Augusto Pinaud>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the full name of the artist who created this painting?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
