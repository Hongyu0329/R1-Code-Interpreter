    "An analysis of the position reveals that White has a powerful attack brewing against the Black king, thanks to the advanced knight on f7 and the active queen on d5. The best move is one that prosecutes this attack in the most forceful way.\n\nLet's evaluate the candidate moves:\n\n*   Many of the checks listed, such as **Ng5+**, **Ne5+**, and **Nd6+**, are actually blunders. After the king moves to h8, White's queen on d5 is attacked by the bishop on e4, and White does not have a good way to save it without losing material.\n*   The move **Nxd8** (the '+' in the option is a typo, as this move is not a check) is a strong candidate. It wins the exchange (a rook for a knight). After 1. Nxd8 Rxd8, White can play 2. Qd1, defending against Black's threats and consolidating a winning material advantage.\n*   However, the most decisive move is **Nh6+**. This move forces a win through a direct attack, which is generally considered superior to a purely material advantage. Black has two responses, and both lose:\n    1.  If Black plays **1...gxh6**, this opens the g-file for White's rook. White continues with **2. Qxe4**, sacrificing the knight to eliminate Black's key defensive bishop. White now threatens checkmate with Qxh7#, and Black's defenses are collapsing. For example: 2...Qf6 3. Qg4+ Kh8 4. Rg1, and the mating attack is unstoppable.\n    2.  If Black plays **1...Kh8**, it seems that White is in trouble because the queen on d5 is attacked. However, White has the stunning reply **2. Qd4!!**. This brilliant interference move attacks the Black queen and sets up a deadly threat. If Black plays **2...Qxd4**, White delivers checkmate with **3. Nf7#**.\n\nBecause **Nh6+** leads to a forced and decisive outcome, it is the best move in the position.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the chess position and explains the best move for White.\n    \"\"\"\n    best_move = \"Nh6+\"\n    option = \"I\"\n\n    print(\"The best move for White is Nh6+.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the step-by-step analysis:\")\n    print(\"1.
