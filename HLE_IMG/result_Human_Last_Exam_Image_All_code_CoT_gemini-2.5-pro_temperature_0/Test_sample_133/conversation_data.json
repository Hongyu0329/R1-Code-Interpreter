    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided mass spectrum. The goal is to deduce the molecular formula and structure of the unknown compound and then provide its IUPAC name.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Molecular Ion (M⁺) and Isotopic Cluster:**\n    *   The peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) appear in a cluster around 260-266. This pattern is characteristic of a molecule containing halogen atoms.\n    *   The peaks are at m/z 260 (I=34.8%), 262 (I=29.0%), 264 (I=12.9%), and 266 (I=3.22%).\n    *   The spacing of 2 amu between peaks suggests the presence of chlorine or bromine.\n    *   Let's test the isotopic abundance pattern for multiple chlorine atoms (³⁵Cl:³⁷Cl ≈ 3:1).\n        *   For 3 chlorine atoms (Cl₃), the expected relative intensity ratio for the M⁺, M⁺+2, M⁺+4, and M⁺+6 peaks is approximately 100:98:32:3.\n        *   Normalizing the observed intensities (34.8, 29.0, 12.9, 3.22) to the first peak gives a ratio of 100:83:37:9.\n    *   This observed ratio is a good match for a compound containing **three chlorine atoms**. The molecular ion peak corresponding to the isotopologue with three ³⁵Cl atoms is at **m/z 260**.\n\n2.  **Molecular Formula Determination:**\n    *   The mass of the non-halogen part of the molecule is the mass of the molecular ion (all ³⁵Cl) minus the mass of three ³⁵Cl atoms.\n    *   Mass of remainder = 260 u - (3 × 35 u) = 260 - 105 = 155 u.\n    *   We need to find a plausible chemical formula for a fragment with a mass of 155 u, likely composed of carbon and hydrogen.\n    *   A formula of **C₁₂H₁₁** has a mass of (12 × 12 u) + (11 × 1 u) = 144 + 11 = 155 u.\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the compound is **C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃**.\n\n3.  **Fragmentation Pattern Analysis:**\n    *   **Base Peak:** The most intense peak (base peak) is at **m/z 225** (I=100%). The mass difference between the molecular ion (260) and the base peak (225) is 35 u, which corresponds to the loss of a single chlorine atom (`[M-Cl]⁺`). This is a very common fragmentation pathway for chlorinated compounds. The isotopic cluster around this peak (m/z 225, 227, 229) confirms the presence of the remaining two chlorine atoms.\n    *   **Key Fragment at m/z 143:** There is a significant peak at m/z 143. The mass difference between the molecular ion (260) and this peak is 260 - 143 = 117 u. A mass of 117 u corresponds to a **trichloromethyl radical (•CCl₃)**. The loss of this radical from the molecular ion to form the `[M-CCl₃]⁺` fragment is strong evidence that the molecule contains a `-CCl₃` group.\n    *   The fragment at m/z 143 would be the `[C₁₁H₁₁]⁺` cation, which is consistent with our formula deduction.\n    *   **Other Fragments:** The sequential loss of the other two chlorine atoms from the `[M-Cl]⁺` fragment explains the peaks at m/z 190 (`[M-2Cl]⁺`) and m/z 155 (`[M-3Cl]⁺`).\n\n4.  **Structure Elucidation and IUPAC Name:**\n    *   Based on the evidence, the structure is `C₁₁H₁₁-CCl₃`. The final step is to determine the structure of the C₁₁H₁₁ group.\n    *   The problem is likely asking for a known compound. A plausible structure that fits the formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃ and contains a CCl₃ group is a substituted ethane.\n    *   Considering common aromatic structures, a structure that fits is **1,1,1-trichloro-2-phenyl-3-butene** is not correct.\n    *   A more plausible structure, although less common, that fits the formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃ and the fragmentation is **6,6,6-trichloro-1-phenyl-1,3-hexadiene**. The parent chain is the hexadiene, and the substituents are a phenyl group and a trichloromethyl group.\n\nLet's write a Python script to formalize the calculations.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_mass_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided mass spectrum data to identify the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Atomic masses (integer mass for simplicity)\n    mass_C = 12\n    mass_H = 1\n    mass_Cl = 35\n\n    # --- Step 1: Analyze Molecular Ion ---\n    molecular_ion_mass = 260\n    num_Cl = 3\n    print(f\"Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Ion\")\n    print(f\"The molecular ion peak (M+) for the all-³⁵Cl isotopologue is at m/z = {molecular_ion_mass}.\")\n    print(f\"The isotopic cluster pattern suggests the presence of {num_Cl} chlorine atoms.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Determine Molecular Formula ---\n    mass_of_3_Cl = num_Cl * mass_Cl\n    mass_of_remainder = molecular_ion_mass - mass_of_3_Cl\n    \n    # Determine formula for the remainder (mass 155)\n    num_C_remainder = 12\n    num_H_remainder = 11\n    calculated_mass_remainder = num_C_remainder * mass_C + num_H_remainder * mass_H\n    \n    print(f\"Step 2: Molecular Formula Determination\")\n    print(f\"Mass of {num_Cl} chlorine atoms = {num_Cl} * {mass_Cl} = {mass_of_3_Cl} u\")\n    print(f\"Mass of the non-halogen part of the molecule = {molecular_ion_mass} - {mass_of_3_Cl} = {mass_of_remainder} u\")\n    print(f\"A plausible formula for a mass of {mass_of_remainder} u is C{num_C_remainder}H{num_H_remainder} (mass = {calculated_mass_remainder} u).\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the molecular formula is C{num_C_remainder}H{num_H_remainder}Cl{num_Cl}.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Analyze Fragmentation ---\n    base_peak_mass = 225\n    fragment_143_mass = 143\n    \n    loss_for_base_peak = molecular_ion_mass - base_peak_mass\n    mass_CCl3_radical = 1 * mass_C + 3 * mass_Cl\n    loss_for_fragment_143 = molecular_ion_mass - fragment_143_mass\n\n    print(f\"Step 3: Fragmentation Analysis\")\n    print(f\"The base peak is at m/z = {base_peak_mass}.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to a loss of {molecular_ion_mass} - {base_peak_mass} = {loss_for_base_peak} u from the molecular ion.\")\n    print(f\"This loss of {loss_for_base_peak} u is a chlorine atom, forming the [M-Cl]⁺ fragment.\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"A significant peak at m/z = {fragment_143_mass} is observed.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to a loss of {molecular_ion_mass} - {fragment_143_mass} = {loss_for_fragment_143} u from the molecular ion.\")\n    print(f\"This loss matches the mass of a trichloromethyl radical (•CCl₃), which is {mass_CCl3_radical} u.\")\n    print(f\"This strongly suggests the presence of a -CCl₃ group in the molecule.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 4: Propose Structure and Name ---\n    # The structure is C11H11-CCl3.
