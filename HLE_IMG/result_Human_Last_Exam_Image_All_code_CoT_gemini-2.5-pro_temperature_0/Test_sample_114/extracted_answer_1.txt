The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is caused by the conformational rigidity of the münchnone intermediate derived from proline. The fused five-membered ring creates a sterically and electronically asymmetric 1,3-dipole, which strongly directs the incoming alkyne to add in a specific orientation, leading to a single product. Reactions 1 and 2 serve as a crucial comparison; they show that with a flexible, acyclic amino acid, the resulting münchnone is more symmetric and lacks a strong directing effect, leading to a non-selective reaction that produces a mixture of regioisomers. This contrast demonstrates that the rigidity of the proline backbone is the key factor enforcing the regioselectivity observed in Reaction 3.
