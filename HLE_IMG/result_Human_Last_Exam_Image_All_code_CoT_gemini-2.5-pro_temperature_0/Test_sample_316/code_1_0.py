    # Step 1: Deduce the rules for patterns A-H.
    # A rule is a 6-tuple (b0, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5) where bi is the output for sum i.
    # Based on analysis of the t=20 patterns:
    # - All rules have b0=0 (stable background) and b1=1 (growth from single cell).
    # - C,E,F,G,H have solid cores, suggesting b5=1. A,B,D have hollow cores (b5=0).
    # - G has checkerboards, C,E,F have large hollows, suggesting b4=0.
    # This leads to the following rule deductions:
    rules = {
