    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the pericyclic reactions involved in the transformation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the overall reaction:** I will examine the starting materials (hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene), the product (a tricyclic compound), and the reaction condition (photochemical, indicated by `hv`).\n2.  **Propose a multi-step mechanism:** The problem states that two pericyclic reactions occur. A direct reaction between the starting materials is unlikely to form the given product in a single step. I will propose a two-step mechanism where one of the reactants first undergoes a photochemical transformation to form an intermediate.\n3.  **Identify the first pericyclic reaction:** I will determine the most plausible initial photochemical reaction. The valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to hexafluoro-Dewar benzene is a known photochemical process. I will classify this reaction type.\n4.  **Identify the second pericyclic reaction:** I will then consider the reaction between the intermediate formed in step 1 and the second reactant (cyclobutene). I will analyze this step to determine the type of pericyclic reaction that leads to the final product.\n5.  **Verify with reaction rules:** I will check if the proposed reactions are consistent with the rules for pericyclic reactions under photochemical conditions (e.g., Woodward-Hoffmann rules).\n6.  **Construct the Python code:** I will write a Python script that prints a clear, step-by-step explanation of the two reactions, making sure to explicitly mention the numbers that define the reaction type (e.g., the '2's in [2+2]), as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code that explains the reactions:\n```python\ndef identify_pericyclic_reactions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the two pericyclic reactions in the given chemical transformation.\n    The code explicitly outputs the numbers defining the cycloaddition type.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The numbers defining the type of cycloaddition ([m+n])\n    m_electrons = 2\n    n_electrons = 2\n\n    print(\"The transformation shown involves two sequential photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 1: Intramolecular reaction\n    print(\"Step 1: Photochemical Isomerization of Hexafluorobenzene\")\n    print(\"The first reaction is the conversion of hexafluorobenzene into its valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene.\")\n    print(f\"This is an intramolecular [{m_electrons}+{n_electrons}] cycloaddition.\")\n    print(f\"In this reaction, a new sigma bond is formed between opposite carbons of the benzene ring.
