    "To calculate the total current flowing from the voltage source, we need to determine the total equivalent resistance of the circuit.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Analyze the circuit diagram:** I will examine the connections between the voltage source and the resistors to understand how they are arranged (series, parallel, or more complex combinations).\n2.  **Simplify the circuit:** Based on the connections, I will simplify the circuit diagram. Specifically, I will check for any short circuits that might effectively remove resistors from the circuit.\n3.  **Identify parallel branches:** After simplification, I will identify the main parallel branches connected across the voltage source.\n4.  **Calculate branch currents:** I will calculate the current flowing through each parallel branch using Ohm's Law (I = V/R).\n5.  **Calculate total current:** The total current from the source is the sum of the currents in all the parallel branches, according to Kirchhoff's Current Law.\n6.  **Construct the Python code:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the step-by-step process, the final equation with all the numerical values, and the final answer.\n\n**Circuit Analysis:**\n*   The voltage source is V2 = 1 V.\n*   Let's call the top wire (positive terminal) Node A and the bottom wire (ground) Node B.\n*   Resistor R1 has a wire connecting Node A to the junction between R1 and R2. This means both terminals of R1 are at the potential of Node A. A component with no potential difference across it will have no current flowing through it. Therefore, R1 is shorted out.\n*   Similarly, resistor R3 has a wire connecting the junction between R2 and R3 to Node B. This means both terminals of R3 are at the potential of Node B. Therefore, R3 is also shorted out.\n*   This leaves resistor R2 connected directly between Node A and Node B.\n*   Resistors R7 and R8 are connected in series with each other. This series combination is connected between Node A and Node B.\n*   So, the circuit simplifies to two parallel branches across the 1V source:\n    1.  A branch with just R2 (7 Ω).\n    2.  A branch with R7 and R8 in series (100 Ω + 100 Ω = 200 Ω).\n\nThe total current will be the sum of the currents through these two branches.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Redirect stdout to capture print output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# Define the component values from the circuit diagram\nV2 = 1.0  # Voltage in Volts\nR1 = 3.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR2 = 7.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR3 = 9.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR7 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms\nR8 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms\n\n# --- Circuit Analysis ---\nprint(\"Step 1: Analyzing the circuit configuration.\")\nprint(\"The circuit has a 1 V source (V2).\")\nprint(\"A wire from the positive terminal to the junction of R1 and R2 shorts out R1.\")\nprint(\"A wire from the junction of R2 and R3 to the negative terminal shorts out R3.\")\nprint(\"The simplified circuit consists of R2 in parallel with the series combination of R7 and R8.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# --- Calculations ---\n# Calculate the resistance of the series branch (R7 + R8)\nR_78 = R7 + R8\nprint(\"Step 2: Calculate the resistance of the second parallel branch.\")\nprint(f\"R7 and R8 are in series: R_78 = R7 + R8 = {R7} Ω + {R8} Ω = {R_78} Ω.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Calculate the current through each parallel branch\nI_2 = V2 / R2\nI_78 = V2 / R_78\nprint(\"Step 3: Calculate the current through each parallel branch using Ohm's Law (I = V/R).\")\nprint(f\"Current through R2: I_2 = {V2} V / {R2} Ω = {I_2:.4f} A.\")\nprint(f\"Current through R7-R8 branch: I_78 = {V2} V / {R_78} Ω = {I_78:.4f} A.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Calculate the total current\nI_total = I_2 + I_78\nprint(\"Step 4: Calculate the total current by summing the branch currents.\")\nprint(\"The final equation for the total current is: I_total = V2 / R2 + V2 / (R7 + R8)\")\nprint(f\"I_total = {V2} / {R2} + {V2} / ({R7} + {R8})\")\nprint(f\"I_total = {I_2:.4f} A + {I_78:.4f} A\")\nprint(f\"Total Current = {I_total:.4f} A\")\n\n# Restore stdout\nsys.stdout = old_stdout\n# Get the captured output\noutput = captured_output.getvalue()\nprint(output)\n\n# Final answer in the required format\nfinal_answer = f\"{I_total:.4f}\"\nprint(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n```"
