    Analyzes the six knots K_1 to K_6 and identifies which are isotopic to the unknot.

    - K_1 is the 6_1 knot (not the unknot).
    - K_2 is a complex diagram of the unknot.
    - K_3 is the 3_1 knot (trefoil knot, not the unknot).
    - K_4 is the 4_1 knot (figure-eight knot, not the unknot).
    - K_5 is an alternating 4-crossing diagram, which is not the unknot (it's also the 4_1 knot).
    - K_6 is the 5_1 knot (cinquefoil knot, not the unknot).

    Therefore, only K_2 is the unknot.
