    "My plan to identify the characters on the seal is as follows:\n1.  I will first determine the style of the script and the reading order. The characters are in an ancient Chinese seal script (篆书, zhuànshū). For a four-character seal like this, the standard reading order is from top to bottom for the right column, and then top to bottom for the left column.\n2.  I will identify each character one by one based on this order and find its corresponding modern simplified Chinese character.\n    *   **Top-Right Character:** This is the seal script for `長`, which simplifies to `长` (cháng).\n    *   **Bottom-Right Character:** This is the seal script for `樂`, which simplifies to `乐` (lè).\n    *   **Top-Left Character:** This is the seal script for `未` (wèi).\n    *   **Bottom-Left Character:** This is the seal script for `央` (yāng).\n3.  Combining the characters, we get the phrase `长乐未央` (Cháng Lè Wèi Yāng). This is a well-known classical idiom meaning \"eternal joy without end.\"\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script to print the identified characters in simplified Chinese.\n\n```python\n# The characters on the seal are identified as \"长乐未央\".\n# This is a classical Chinese idiom meaning \"eternal joy without end\".\n# The following code will print these characters in simplified Chinese.\n\nprint(\"长乐未央\")\n```\n<<<长乐未央>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What's the character content on the seal in simplified Chinese?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
