    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the ECG strip, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the time scale:** The ECG paper speed is given as 25 mm/sec. The grid is made of 1 mm small squares. Therefore, the time for one small square is 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n2.  **Identify the longest R-R interval:** I will visually inspect the entire rhythm strip to find the largest distance between two consecutive R-waves (the peaks of the QRS complexes). The rhythm shows a regular underlying rate with periodic long pauses. I will measure the duration of one of these pauses.\n3.  **Measure the interval in small squares:** I will count the number of small squares for the longest R-R interval. On the second strip, there is a clear long pause between the 4th and 5th beats. This pause measures approximately 7 large squares plus 2 small squares. Since one large square equals 5 small squares, the total distance is (7 * 5) + 2 = 37 small squares.\n4.  **Calculate the interval in seconds:** I will multiply the number of small squares by the time per square to get the final duration in seconds.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_longest_rr_interval():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the longest R-R interval in seconds from an ECG strip.\n\n    The function uses the standard ECG paper speed and the measured interval\n    in small squares to compute the duration.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the given parameters from the ECG.\n    paper_speed_mm_per_sec = 25  # mm/sec\n    small_square_mm = 1          # mm\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the time duration of one small square.\n    time_per_small_square = small_square_mm / paper_speed_mm_per_sec\n\n    # Step 3: Measure the longest R-R interval in small squares from the image.\n    # By visual inspection, the longest pause spans 7 large squares and 2 small squares.\n    # One large square = 5 small squares.\n    num_large_squares = 7\n    num_extra_small_squares = 2\n    total_small_squares = (num_large_squares * 5) + num_extra_small_squares\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the longest R-R interval in seconds.\n    longest_rr_interval_seconds = total_small_squares * time_per_small_square\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final calculation.\n    print(\"To find the longest R-R interval:\")\n    print(f\"1.
