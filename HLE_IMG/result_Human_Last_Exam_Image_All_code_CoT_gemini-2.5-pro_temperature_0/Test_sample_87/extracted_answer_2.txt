The structures are determined by analyzing the reaction pathways. Product C is the N-acetylated starting material. Product A is the [3+2] cycloadduct formed via a decarboxylative azomethine ylide pathway. Product B is a complex tetracyclic pyridone formed through a cascade reaction. The python code provides the SMILES strings and verifies the molecular formulas for these structures.
