    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** I will visually inspect the provided raster plot to identify the time points corresponding to the center of each synchronized burst. A synchronized burst is characterized by a dense, vertical alignment of firing events across many electrodes.\n2.  **List Timestamps:** I will create a list of these identified timestamps in seconds.\n3.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** I will calculate the time difference between each consecutive pair of burst timestamps. These are the inter-burst intervals.\n4.  **Calculate Average IBI:** I will compute the average of all the calculated inter-burst intervals.\n5.  **Format the Output:** I will round the final average to two significant figures as requested and present the entire calculation process in the Python code.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Identify the timestamps of the synchronized bursts from the graph.\n# The bursts are the dense vertical bands of activity.\n# I estimate the center of each burst from the x-axis (Time (s)).\nburst_timestamps = [2.5, 12.5, 24.5, 36.5, 48.5]\nprint(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs).\n# IBI is the time difference between consecutive bursts.\ninter_burst_intervals = []\nfor i in range(len(burst_timestamps) - 1):\n    interval = burst_timestamps[i+1] - burst_timestamps[i]\n    inter_burst_intervals.append(interval)\n\nprint(f\"Calculated inter-burst intervals (s): {inter_burst_intervals}\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the average IBI.\naverage_ibi = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\n\n# Step 5: Format the output and print the final calculation.\n# The final equation shows the sum of intervals divided by the number of intervals.\n# The result is then formatted to two significant figures.\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the average inter-burst interval:\")\ncalculation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, inter_burst_intervals))\nprint(f\"Average = ({calculation_str}) / {len(inter_burst_intervals)}\")\nprint(f\"Average = {sum(inter_burst_intervals)} / {len(inter_burst_intervals)}\")\nprint(f\"Average = {average_ibi:.3f} s\")\n\n# Rounding to two significant figures\nfinal_answer = float(f\"{average_ibi:.1g}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe average inter-burst interval rounded to two significant figures is {final_answer} s.\")\n```\n<<<12>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts in this graph of firing activity of a neuronal culture and calculate the average inter-burst interval to two significant figures.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
