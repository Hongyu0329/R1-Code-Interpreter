    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Objective:** The main goal is to find the ratio between the highest and lowest infinity-norm among the nine visualizations of Wigner 3-j symbols.\n2.  **Infinity-Norm:** For a matrix of values (represented here as a heatmap), the infinity-norm is the maximum absolute value among all its elements. Visually, this corresponds to the most intense color in the plot, which is the most saturated red or green pixel.\n3.  **Color-to-Value Mapping:** The images use a diverging red-green colormap where white represents zero, and red and green represent negative and positive values (or vice-versa). The intensity of the color corresponds to the magnitude of the value. We can create a numerical proxy for this magnitude by calculating `abs(G - R)` for the Green (G) and Red (R) channels of each pixel's RGB value. A larger difference corresponds to a more saturated color and thus a larger magnitude.\n4.  **Image Processing:** I will write a Python script to perform the analysis automatically. The script will:\n    *   Download or load the provided image.\n    *   Divide the main 648x648 pixel image into its 3x3 grid of sub-plots, carefully avoiding the black grid lines.\n    *   For each of the nine sub-plots, it will calculate the infinity-norm by finding the maximum `abs(G - R)` value among all its colored pixels (ignoring the white background).\n    *   Store the nine calculated norms.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Once all nine norms are computed, the script will identify the maximum and minimum values among them and calculate their ratio.\n6.  **Output:** The script will print the list of all nine norms, the maximum and minimum norms, and the final equation showing the ratio calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation. You will need to have the `Pillow` and `numpy` libraries installed (`pip install Pillow numpy`).\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport urllib.request\nfrom io import BytesIO\n\ndef solve_wigner_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm\n    among the nine Wigner 3-j symbols visualized in the provided image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1: Load the image ---\n    # The script will attempt to download the image from a URL.\n    # If you have it saved locally, you can replace the loading part with:\n    # image_path = 'wigner_symbols.png'\n    # img = Image.open(image_path).convert('RGB')\n    try:\n        url = \"https://i.imgur.com/9a5a2pA.png\"\n        with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as response:\n            img_data = response.read()\n        img = Image.open(BytesIO(img_data)).convert('RGB')\n        img_array = np.array(img, dtype=np.int32)\n        print(\"Image loaded successfully.\\n\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error: Could not load the image.
