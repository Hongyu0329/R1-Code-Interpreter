# Plan:
# The synthesis is divided into two major parts:
# 1. Preparation of the key intermediate, acenaphthenone, from the given 2-acetylnaphthalene.
# 2. Synthesis of the final product, diindenoperylene (DIP), from acenaphthenone and benzaldehyde.

# Part 1: Synthesis of Acenaphthenone
# Step 1: Isomerization of 2-acetylnaphthalene to 1-acetylnaphthalene.
step_1 = 1
# Step 2: Cyclization of 1-acetylnaphthalene to acenaphthenone.
step_2 = 1

# Part 2: Synthesis of Diindenoperylene (DIP)
# Step 3: Condensation of acenaphthenone with benzaldehyde.
step_3 = 1
# Step 4: Dimerization and aromatization to form the final product.
step_4 = 1

# Calculate the total minimum number of steps by summing the individual steps.
total_steps = step_1 + step_2 + step_3 + step_4

# Print the final equation showing each number, as requested.
print(f"The total minimum number of steps is the sum of the steps for each transformation:")
print(f"{step_1} (Isomerization) + {step_2} (Cyclization) + {step_3} (Condensation) + {step_4} (Dimerization) = {total_steps} steps")
