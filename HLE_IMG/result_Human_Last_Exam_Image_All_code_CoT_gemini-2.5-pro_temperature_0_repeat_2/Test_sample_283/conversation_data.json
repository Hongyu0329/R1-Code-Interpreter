    "Based on the analysis of the Google Trends graph, the country can be identified by correlating the annual peaks in search interest with major national events or holidays.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Red Line:** This line shows a prominent peak every year in late January. This timing strongly corresponds to **Australia Day**, which is celebrated on January 26th.\n2.  **Analyze the Yellow Line:** This line shows a significant peak every year in late April. This timing aligns perfectly with **Anzac Day**, a major national day of remembrance in Australia and New Zealand, observed on April 25th.\n3.  **Analyze the Blue Line:** This line shows smaller, but consistent, annual peaks in late May and early June. This period corresponds to **National Reconciliation Week** in Australia, which runs from May 27th to June 3rd.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since all three distinct historical and cultural commemorations (Australia Day, Anzac Day, and National Reconciliation Week) are unique and significant to one country, the country in question is Australia.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef identify_country():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided Google Trends data to identify the country.\n    The analysis is based on the timing of annual peaks in search interest for three distinct events.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Event 1 (Red Line): Peaks annually in late January.\n    # This corresponds to Australia Day on January 26th.\n    event_1 = \"Australia Day (late January)\"\n    \n    # Event 2 (Yellow Line): Peaks annually in late April.\n    # This corresponds to Anzac Day on April 25th.\n    event_2 = \"Anzac Day (late April)\"\n    \n    # Event 3 (Blue Line): Peaks annually in late May/early June.\n    # This corresponds to National Reconciliation Week (May 27 - June 3).\n    event_3 = \"National Reconciliation Week (late May/early June)\"\n    \n    # The country where all three of these events are significant national observances.\n    country = \"Australia\"\n    \n    print(\"Analysis of Google Trends Peaks:\")\n    print(f\"1.
