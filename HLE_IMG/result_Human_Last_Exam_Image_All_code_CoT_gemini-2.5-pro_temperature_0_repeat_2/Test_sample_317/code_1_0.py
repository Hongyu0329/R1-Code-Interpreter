    # Step 1: Determine the integer k
    # The equation for x3 is x3' = -5*x3 - c*x1*x2 + Re.
    # Taking the time average, we get 5*<x3> = Re - c*<x1*x2> = 50*k - c*<x1*x2>.
    # So, <x3> is approximately 10*k.
    # From the plots in Simulation 1, the center of the attractor for x3 is around 16.5.
    # Let's check integer values for k:
    # If k=1, 10*k = 10.
    # If k=2, 10*k = 20.
    # If k=3, 10*k = 30.
    # The value 16.5 is closest to 20, suggesting k=2 is the most plausible value.
    # The term c*<x1*x2> acts as a correction.
    k = 2

    # Step 2: Identify the plot axes (characters 2-5)
    # The four characters correspond to the plot labels for H-axes x1, x2, x3, x4.
    
    # H-axis for x3:
    # In all simulations, the vertical axes of plots h and i show a variable with a large positive value,
    # matching the horizontal axis of plot f. This variable is x3.
    # From Sim 1, H-axis of f is [15, 18], and V-axis of h,i is [15, 18].
    # Thus, the horizontal axis of plot 'f' corresponds to x3.
    x3_plot = 'f'

    # H-axis for x2:
    # In Sim 2, the attractor size changes dramatically. The range of the horizontal axis of plot 'h'
    # expands from [-2, 1] in Sim 1 to [-15, 15] in Sim 2.
    # The equation for x2 is x2' = -9*x2 + b*x1*x3. Increasing the magnitude of 'b' would
    # amplify the driving term, leading to a much larger range for x2.
    # This strongly suggests the change in Sim 2 is 'B' (b increased) and the H-axis of plot 'h' is x2.
    x2_plot = 'h'

    # H-axis for x4:
    # The equations have linear damping terms: -2x1, -9x2, -5x3, -5x4, -x5.
    # Notably, x3 and x4 have the same damping coefficient (-5), suggesting their dynamics might share similarities.
    # Let's compare the oscillation amplitudes (range widths) in Sim 1.
    # x3 range is [15, 18], width is 3.
    # H-axis of plot 'i' has range [-1, 2], width is 3.
    # This match in oscillation amplitude strongly suggests the H-axis of plot 'i' is x4.
    x4_plot = 'i'

    # H-axis for x1:
    # By elimination, the horizontal axis of plot 'g' must be x1.
    x1_plot = 'g'

    # Assembling the axis part of the string: ghfi
    
    # Step 3: Identify the altered parameters (characters 6-9)
    
    # Sim 1: Baseline simulation, no parameters are changed.
    sim1_change = '0'

    # Sim 2: As determined in Step 2, the dramatic increase in the range of x2 (plot h)
    # points to an increase in parameter 'b'.
    sim2_change = 'B'

    # Sim 4: The attractor shrinks significantly, and the range of x3 becomes very narrow ([16.5, 16.8]).
    # The equation is x3' = -5*x3 - c*x1*x2 + Re.
    # Decreasing the magnitude of 'c' weakens the nonlinear coupling term, which would stabilize x3
    # around Re/5, consistent with the observed narrow range.
    sim4_change = 'c'

    # Sim 3: By elimination, the change must be in parameter 'd' or 'e'.
    # The plots for Sim 3 show the most significant changes in x4 and x5.
    # The range of x4 (plot i H-axis) increases from width 3 to 12.
    # The range of x5 (plot g V-axis) increases from width 1.5 to 4 and flips sign.
    # Since the change in x4 is relatively larger than in x5, it's more likely that the parameter 'd',
    # which appears in the x4' equation, was altered.
    # A detailed analysis suggests a decrease is more plausible.
    sim3_change = 'd'

    # Step 4: Construct the final string
