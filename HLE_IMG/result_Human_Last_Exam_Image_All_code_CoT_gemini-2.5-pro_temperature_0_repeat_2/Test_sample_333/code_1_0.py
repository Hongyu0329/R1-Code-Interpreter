def solve_airfoil_matching():
    """
    This function determines and prints the correct pairing between airfoil shapes (A-H)
    and their pressure coefficient distributions (1-8).

    The matching is based on aerodynamic principles:
    - Camber determines lift potential. Positive camber increases lift, negative camber creates negative lift.
    - Thickness affects the pressure peak. Thicker airfoils have rounder leading edges and broader, less sharp suction peaks.
    - The area between the upper and lower surface Cp curves represents the lift coefficient.

    The step-by-step matching is as follows:
    - Airfoil D (negative camber) -> Plot 2 (negative lift).
    - Airfoil C (thin, symmetric) -> Plot 1 (moderate lift, sharp peak).
    - Airfoil H (thick, symmetric) -> Plot 8 (moderate lift, broad peak).
    - Airfoil E (very thick, high camber) -> Plot 3 (high lift, very broad peak).
    - Airfoil F (thick, high camber) -> Plot 4 (higher lift than G).
    - Airfoil G (thick, lower camber) -> Plot 5 (lower lift than F).
    - Airfoil A (thin, high camber) -> Plot 6 (higher lift than B, sharp peak).
    - Airfoil B (thin, lower camber) -> Plot 7 (lower lift than A, sharp peak).
