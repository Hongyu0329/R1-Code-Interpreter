    "This is a famous four-character Chinese idiom, often found on ancient artifacts. The characters are written in seal script and are read from top to bottom, right to left.\n\n1.  **Top Right Character:** 長 (cháng) - meaning long or eternal.\n2.  **Bottom Right Character:** 樂 (lè) - meaning joy or happiness.\n3.  **Top Left Character:** 未 (wèi) - meaning not yet.\n4.  **Bottom Left Character:** 央 (yāng) - meaning end.\n\nTogether, they form the phrase **長樂未央 (Cháng Lè Wèi Yāng)**, which translates to \"Eternal happiness without end.\" It's a wish for everlasting joy and prosperity.\n\nHere is the Python code to display the simplified Chinese characters.\n\n```python\ndef seal_characters():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function prints the simplified Chinese characters found on the seal.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The characters on the seal are 長樂未央 (cháng lè wèi yāng) in traditional script.\n  # The simplified version is 长乐未央.\n  simplified_chars = \"长乐未央\"\n  print(f\"The characters on the seal in simplified Chinese are: {simplified_chars}\")\n  print(\"This is a traditional Chinese idiom meaning 'Eternal happiness without end'.\")\n\nseal_characters()\n```\n<<<长乐未央>>>"
