    "My plan is to determine the metric pattern of the erasure poem by first reconstructing the most likely sentence from the given words, and then analyzing its metrical structure, primarily by counting its syllables.\n\n1.  **Reconstruct the Poem:** I will assemble the words \"rules\", \"and\", \"lines,\", \"an\", \"intricate\", \"spider's\", \"web\", and \"work\" into a grammatically coherent sentence. The most plausible arrangement is \"Rules and lines work an intricate spider's web.\"\n2.  **Count Syllables:** I will write a Python function to count the syllables for each word in the reconstructed sentence and then sum them to find the total syllable count for the line.\n3.  **Analyze Metric Options:** I will compare the total syllable count against the definitions of the metric patterns provided in the answer choices:\n    *   **Free verse:** No regular meter or syllable count.\n    *   **Iambic pentameter:** 10 syllables per line.\n    *   **Alexandrine:** 12 syllables per line.\n    *   **Sapphic:** Uses hendecasyllabic lines, which have 11 syllables.\n    *   **Loose iambic trimeter:** Approximately 6 syllables per line.\n    *   **American sentence:** Exactly 17 syllables per line.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the syllable count, I will identify the matching metric pattern.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef count_syllables(word):\n    \"\"\"A simple heuristic-based syllable counter.\"\"\"\n    word = word.lower()\n    # exceptions\n    if len(word) <= 3:\n        return 1\n    # remove silent e at the end\n    if word.endswith('e') and not word.endswith('le'):\n        word = word[:-1]\n    # count vowel groups\n    vowel_groups = re.findall(r'[aeiouy]+', word)\n    return max(1, len(vowel_groups))\n\ndef analyze_poem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the erasure poem to determine its metric pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
