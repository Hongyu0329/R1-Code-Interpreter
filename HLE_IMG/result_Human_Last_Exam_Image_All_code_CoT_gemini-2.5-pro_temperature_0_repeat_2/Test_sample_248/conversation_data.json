    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan:\n1.  I will first identify the key species in the image. The image displays a typical North Atlantic rocky shore community. The most prominent species are barnacles (likely *Semibalanus balanoides*), and several species of marine snails (periwinkles).\n2.  I will then determine which of these species has a geographic range limited to the Atlantic Ocean, making it the indicator species.\n3.  The large, relatively smooth-shelled snail with faint banding is the common periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*. This species is native to the Northeast Atlantic (Europe) and was introduced to the Northwest Atlantic (North America) in the 19th century, where it is now extremely common. It is not established on the Pacific Coast, with only a few isolated and non-breeding populations ever reported.\n4.  The smaller, darker, ribbed snails are likely rough periwinkles, *Littorina saxatilis*, which are found on both Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The barnacles are also likely a species found on both coasts.\n5.  Therefore, the presence of the common periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*, definitively indicates the photo was taken on an Atlantic coast.\n6.  I will write a Python script to print this scientific name.\n\n```python\ndef find_indicator_species():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the scientific name of the species\n  that indicates the photo was taken on the Atlantic Coast.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The common periwinkle, Littorina littorea, is native to the European Atlantic coast\n  # and is a very common introduced species on the North American Atlantic coast.\n  # It is not established on the Pacific Coast.\n  scientific_name = \"Littorina littorea\"\n  print(f\"The scientific name of the indicator species is: {scientific_name}\")\n\nfind_indicator_species()\n```\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
