The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to the rigid, bicyclic structure of the münchnone intermediate derived from N-acetylproline. This rigidity prevents the intermediate from undergoing a ring-opening to an acyclic ketene, a process that is responsible for the substituent scrambling observed in Reaction 2.

Reaction 1 demonstrates that the [3+2] cycloaddition step is inherently regioselective. Reaction 2, using an acyclic amino acid derivative, shows that despite the inherent selectivity of the cycloaddition, the flexible münchnone intermediate can equilibrate via an acyclic ketene. This equilibrium scrambles the positions of the substituents that originated from the acetyl group and the alanine side chain, leading to a 1:1 mixture of labeled products.

In Reaction 3, the proline ring locks the münchnone intermediate, preventing this ring-opening and scrambling pathway due to the immense geometric strain it would create (a violation of Bredt's rule). As a result, the locked intermediate undergoes the inherently regioselective cycloaddition to give a single, specific product (Product B).
