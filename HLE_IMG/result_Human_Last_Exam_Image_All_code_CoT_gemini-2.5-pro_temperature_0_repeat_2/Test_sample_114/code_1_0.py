    # --- Step 1: Identify the Core Reaction Mechanism ---
    print("--- General Reaction Analysis ---")
    print("The reactions shown are 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions. The conditions (N-acyl amino acid, acetic anhydride, and triethylamine) generate a mesoionic intermediate known as a münchnone.")
    print("This münchnone is a 1,3-dipole that reacts with the alkyne (methyl propiolate) in a [3+2] cycloaddition, which, after losing CO2, forms a pyrrole product.")
    print("-" * 50)

    # --- Step 2: Analyze Reactions 1 and 2 (Acyclic Precursor) ---
    print("--- Analysis of Reactions 1 & 2 ---")
    print("Reactant: N-acetyl-N-methylalanine (an acyclic amino acid derivative).")
    print("Product A: Methyl 1,2,5-trimethyl-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxylate (C9H13NO2).")
    print("\nContribution of Reaction 1:")
    print("Reaction 1 produces a single regioisomer of Product A in high yield. This demonstrates that the cycloaddition step itself is inherently highly regioselective, likely controlled by frontier molecular orbital (FMO) interactions.")
    print("\nContribution of Reaction 2:")
    print("Reaction 2 uses 13C labels on the two different methyl groups (one from the acetyl group, one from the alanine side chain). The result is a 1:1 mixture of products where the label is scrambled between the two corresponding methyl positions on the final pyrrole ring.")
    print("This scrambling indicates that the münchnone intermediate is not static. It is in equilibrium with an acyclic N-acylamino ketene intermediate. This ring-opening and closing process allows the two methyl groups (at C2 and C4 of the münchnone) to become equivalent before the cycloaddition occurs, thus scrambling the label.")
    print("-" * 50)

    # --- Step 3: Analyze Reaction 3 (Cyclic Precursor) ---
    print("--- Analysis of Reaction 3 ---")
    print("Reactant: N-acetylproline (a cyclic amino acid).")
    print("Product B: A bicyclic pyrrole derivative (C10H13NO2).")
    print("\nKey Structural Difference:")
    print("The münchnone intermediate formed from proline is a rigid, bicyclic system because the proline's five-membered ring is incorporated into the münchnone structure.")
    print("-" * 50)

    # --- Step 4: Final Rationale ---
    print("--- Rationale for Regioselectivity in Reaction 3 ---")
    print("The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is a direct result of the rigid structure of its bicyclic münchnone intermediate.")
    print("\nReasoning:")
    print("1. The scrambling observed in Reaction 2 is only possible because the münchnone can ring-open to a flexible acyclic ketene. ")
    print("2. The bicyclic münchnone from Reaction 3 is 'locked'. It cannot ring-open to a ketene because forming a linear ketene group (C=C=O) within a five-membered ring would create immense geometric strain (a violation of Bredt's Rule).")
    print("3. Since the scrambling pathway is blocked, the locked intermediate can only react via the inherently regioselective cycloaddition pathway (as established by Reaction 1).")
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The results from Reactions 1 and 2 show that the cycloaddition is selective, but a flexible intermediate can scramble. Reaction 3 is highly regioselective because its rigid, proline-derived intermediate prevents this scrambling, allowing the inherent selectivity of the cycloaddition to be fully expressed, yielding only Product B.")
