    Solves the Clockwork Conundrum riddle.

    The riddle describes a clock where both hands move in unison.
    - The hour hand moves in "steps of three" (3 hours, or 90 degrees).
    - The minute hand moves "a quarter turn" (also 90 degrees).
    Since they start together at noon and move by the same amount, they meet
    at the moment of their first move.

    The timing of this move, or "tick", is hinted at by the phrase "a quarter turn".
    On a normal clock, a minute hand completes a quarter turn every 15 minutes.
    We deduce that a "tick" happens every 15 minutes.

    The clock starts at noon (12:00). The first tick, and thus the first meeting,
    occurs 15 minutes later.
    """

    # The starting time is noon.
    start_hour = 12
    start_minute = 0

    # The interval for one "tick" is derived from a normal minute hand's "quarter turn".
    tick_interval_in_minutes = 15

    # The first meeting happens after the first tick.
    time_of_first_meeting_in_minutes = start_minute + tick_interval_in_minutes

    # Calculate the final time.
    final_hour = start_hour
    final_minute = time_of_first_meeting_in_minutes

    # The riddle asks for the time of the meeting.
    # The final equation for the time is combining the hour and minute.
    # We will print each component as requested.
    hour_str = str(final_hour)
    minute_str = f"{final_minute:02d}" # Format minute to have a leading zero if needed.
    
    print(f"{hour_str}:{minute_str}")
