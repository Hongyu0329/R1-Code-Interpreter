    "Based on the visual information provided, I will identify the auditory phenomenon being illustrated.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the image:** The image contains two plots. The top plot is a spectrogram, which shows the frequency of a sound over time. The bottom plot is the corresponding waveform.\n2.  **Interpret the plots:** The spectrogram begins with a single, constant frequency (a pure tone), represented by a horizontal line. This tone is then interrupted by a short burst of wide-frequency sound (noise), represented by a vertical smudge. After the noise, the sound continues. The waveform mirrors this: it starts as a regular sine wave, becomes chaotic during the noise burst, and then resumes.\n3.  **Identify the illusion:** This specific stimulus—a tone interrupted by a burst of noise—is used to demonstrate a well-known auditory illusion. When people listen to this sound, they typically do not perceive a tone, then a noise, then a tone. Instead, they perceive the original tone as continuing *uninterrupted* through the noise. The brain \"fills in\" the missing part of the tone.\n4.  **Name the phenomenon:** This perceptual \"filling-in\" or restoration of a sound that has been obscured by another sound is called the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**. It's a powerful example of how the brain uses context to construct our perception of reality. The comparison to the Necker Cube is apt, as both illusions demonstrate the brain's active role in interpreting ambiguous or incomplete sensory data to form a coherent whole.\n5.  **Formulate the code:** To fulfill the request of providing a code block, I will write a simple Python script that stores the name of the phenomenon in a variable and then prints it to the console.\n\n```python\n# The image provided illustrates a classic auditory illusion.\n# It shows a spectrogram and waveform of a pure tone that is briefly interrupted by a burst of noise.\n# When a listener hears this, their brain perceptually \"fills in\" the gap,\n# causing the tone to be heard as continuous, as if it never stopped.\n# This phenomenon is a prime example of the brain's ability to construct a coherent\n# perceptual experience from incomplete sensory information.\n\nphenomenon_name = \"Auditory Continuity Illusion\"\n\nprint(\"The phenomenon shown in the image is known as the:\")\nprint(phenomenon_name)\n```\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion>>>"
