# The image provided illustrates a classic auditory illusion.
# It shows a spectrogram and waveform of a pure tone that is briefly interrupted by a burst of noise.
# When a listener hears this, their brain perceptually "fills in" the gap,
# causing the tone to be heard as continuous, as if it never stopped.
# This phenomenon is a prime example of the brain's ability to construct a coherent
# perceptual experience from incomplete sensory information.
