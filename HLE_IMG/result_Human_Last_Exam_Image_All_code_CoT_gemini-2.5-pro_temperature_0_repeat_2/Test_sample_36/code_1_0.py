    print("As a Knowledge Management Consultant, the most effective approach for VVA Consulting is to use a combination of the DIKW and SECI models. Here's the reasoning:")

    print("The sales process generates a lot of data (number of leads, conversion rates, client feedback). The DIKW model provides a framework to:")
    print(" - Data: Collect raw sales figures from each stage of the pipeline.")
    print(" - Information: Analyze this data to see which lead sources are most effective or where deals are stalling.")
    print(" - Knowledge: Use this information to understand *why* certain strategies work, like discovering that a particular 'VA Sales Script' is highly effective for a specific industry.")
    print(" - Wisdom: Apply this knowledge to make strategic decisions, like focusing prospecting efforts or refining sales materials to boost overall results.")

    print("\n2. SECI Model for Capturing and Sharing Expertise:")
    print("The company's success also depends on the skills of its salespeople (tacit knowledge). The SECI model helps to:")
    print(" - Socialization (Tacit-to-Tacit): Allow experienced salespeople to mentor new hires.")
    print(" - Externalization (Tacit-to-Explicit): Document the successful techniques of top performers into concrete assets like an improved 'VA Sales Script' or a 'Work Manual/Template'.")
    print(" - Combination (Explicit-to-Explicit): Combine various documents (e.g., sales lists, scripts, proposal templates) into a comprehensive sales playbook.")
    print(" - Internalization (Explicit-to-Tacit): Train the entire sales team on these best practices so that the documented knowledge becomes their own skill.")

    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("By using DIKW, VVA can create knowledge from its operational data. By using SECI, it can capture and spread the valuable knowledge held by its employees. Together, these two models provide a powerful and complete framework to achieve the goal of boosting and maintaining sales.")
