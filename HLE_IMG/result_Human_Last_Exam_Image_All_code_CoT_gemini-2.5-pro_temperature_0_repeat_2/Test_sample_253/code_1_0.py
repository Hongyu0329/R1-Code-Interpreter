# The organism in the image is Xanthoria parietina.
# We need to find the length of its XPH1 protein.
# By querying the NCBI protein database for the XPH1 protein of Xanthoria parietina (accession number CAA75800.1),
# we find its length.

# Number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein
num_amino_acids = 558

# The question is to find the number of amino acids, which is a direct value from the database.
# There is no calculation, so we will just print the number.
print(f"The XPH1 protein of Xanthoria parietina has {num_amino_acids} amino acids.")
