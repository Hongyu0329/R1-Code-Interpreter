The image is a collage created in the style of Surrealism. This artistic movement, which emerged in the 1920s, was heavily influenced by the psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud.

The key elements in the image that point to Freud's influence are:
1.  **Dreamlike Imagery:** The bizarre juxtaposition of a human body with an animal head, a mountain landscape, anatomical diagrams (ear bones, skull), and fragments of text creates an illogical, dream-like scene. Freud's "The Interpretation of Dreams" (1899) was a foundational text for the Surrealists, who sought to tap into the unconscious mind.
2.  **Hybrid Figure:** The human-animal hybrid represents a common dream symbol, suggesting a conflict or merging of civilized human consciousness and primal, instinctual drives (what Freud might term the Ego and the Id).
3.  **Symbolism:** The reference to "Persephone" (a myth rich with themes of trauma, duality, and the underworld), the figure's gesture of hiding its face (suggesting shame or repression), and the fragmented text all function as symbols that can be interpreted psychoanalytically.
4.  **Collage Technique:** The very method of collage, combining disparate and unrelated elements, was used by Surrealists to mimic the process of "free association" and the way the unconscious mind works in dreams (through condensation and displacement).

While other theorists could be relevant (like Jung for the mythological archetypes), the artistic *style* and *method* are so deeply rooted in Surrealism that Freud is the most direct and primary influence.
