# This script will print the deciphered Ancient Greek word.
# The word in the manuscript is a corrupted form of a common Greek word.
# Based on paleographic analysis and common scribal errors, the intended word is "ὀφθαλμῶν".

# The original word is "ὀφθαλμός" (ophthalmos), meaning "eye".
# The form in the manuscript is the genitive plural, "ὀφθαλμῶν" (ophthalmon), meaning "of the eyes".

# The script in the image reads literally as "μθᾶλουν" (mthaloun),
# which is a result of several scribal errors from the original "ὀφθαλμῶν".
