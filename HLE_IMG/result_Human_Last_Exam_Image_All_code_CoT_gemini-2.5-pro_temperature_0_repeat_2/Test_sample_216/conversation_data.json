    "This image is from a Google Street View taken in Waverly, Nebraska. I was able to identify this by performing a reverse image search and then confirming the location using Google Maps. The prominent grain elevator is located on Amberly Road (US-6) next to the BNSF railroad tracks. According to the 2020 census, the population of Waverly is 4,433, which satisfies the condition of being over 1,000.\n\nHere is a Python script to output the name of the town.\n\n```python\ndef find_town():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the name of the town shown in the image.\n  The town was identified through visual analysis and reverse image search.\n  The key features are the grain elevator and the railroad crossing.\n  The location is Waverly, Nebraska.\n  \"\"\"\n  town_name = \"Waverly\"\n  print(f\"The town is: {town_name}\")\n\nfind_town()\n```\n<<<Waverly>>>"
