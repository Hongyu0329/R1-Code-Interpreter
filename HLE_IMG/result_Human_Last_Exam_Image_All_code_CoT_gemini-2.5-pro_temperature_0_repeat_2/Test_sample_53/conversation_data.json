    "My plan is to identify the mythological scene depicted on the ancient Greek vase. I will analyze the key figures and their actions to determine the specific story being told.\n\n1.  **Analyze the central figure:** The figure driving the chariot is wearing a distinctive patterned sleeve and a Phrygian cap, which in Greek art often signifies a person from the East (Anatolia, Colchis, etc.). This figure is actively driving the chariot away.\n2.  **Analyze the other figures:** There is a dead or dying male figure on the ground, directly in the path of the chariot. A winged creature is visible above the horse, suggesting a supernatural element to the chariot's propulsion. Another draped figure is in the chariot with the driver.\n3.  **Synthesize the elements:** The combination of a female figure of Eastern origin, a magical chariot, and dead children on the ground points strongly to the myth of Medea. After her husband Jason abandoned her for the princess of Corinth, Medea took revenge by killing the princess and her own two sons. She then escaped from Corinth in a flying chariot sent by her grandfather, the sun-god Helios.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The figure driving the chariot, and thus \"leaving\" the scene, is Medea. The figure on the ground is one of her murdered sons. The winged creature is one of the dragons or serpents pulling the divine chariot.\n\n```python\ndef identify_figure():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the main figure leaving the scene in the chariot\n    based on the mythological context depicted on the vase.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The scene shows the escape of Medea from Corinth after her revenge.\n    # She is the one driving the chariot provided by the sun god, Helios.\n    figure_name = \"Medea\"\n    \n    print(f\"The figure driving the chariot and leaving the scene is {figure_name}.\")\n\nidentify_figure()\n```\n<<<Medea>>>"
