    # Step 1: Determine m and n from visual inspection.
    # The path between adjacent pentagons is 5 steps, a turn, and 5 more steps.
    # The concentric color pattern indicates an achiral structure, meaning m=n.
    # We disregard the hint "m > n" as it contradicts the visual evidence.

    # First, calculate the triangulation number T = m^2 + m*n + n^2.
    T = m**2 + m * n + n**2
    # Then, calculate H = 10 * (T - 1).
    H = 10 * (T - 1)
