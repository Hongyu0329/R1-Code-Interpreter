def calculate_missing_Nn():
    """
    This function calculates the number-average degree of polymerization (Nn)
    for the missing simulation plot.

    Based on the analysis of the 9 provided plots and theoretical models:
    1. The initial degree of polymerization is N = 20.
    2. There are two polymer types (linear, ladder) and five degrees of destruction
       a = m/25, for m in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. This gives 10 total simulations.
    3. By matching theoretical predictions to the plots, we determined that the
       missing plot corresponds to a LINEAR polymer at the highest degree of
       destruction, m = 5.
    4. The formula for Nn for a linear polymer is: Nn = N / (1 + (N-1)*a).
