    This function analyzes the double intramolecular Schmidt reaction to determine the product.

    1.  The starting material is asymmetric, containing a 3-carbon azide chain and a 4-carbon azide chain.
    2.  Symmetric products (D and E) are ruled out because an asymmetric reactant leads to an asymmetric product.
    3.  The remaining plausible bridged product is F, which is asymmetric.
    4.  We can predict the size of the newly formed lactam rings based on the length of the azide chains.
        - The 3-azidopropyl chain has n=3 carbons. The cyclization typically forms an (n+2)-membered ring. So, 3 + 2 = 5-membered ring.
        - The 4-azidobutyl chain has n=4 carbons. The cyclization forms an (n+2)-membered ring. So, 4 + 2 = 6-membered ring.
    5.  The expected product should contain one 5-membered lactam ring and one 6-membered lactam ring.
    6.  Product F has exactly this structure: one 5-membered lactam and one 6-membered lactam.
