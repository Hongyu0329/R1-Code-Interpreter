    "This is a visual recognition task. Based on the distinctive architectural style of the ceiling, I can identify the location. The image shows the interior of the West Building of McCormick Place, the largest convention center in North America, which is located in Chicago, Illinois. The key features are the white, triangular trussed roof and the glass panels with a pattern of blue dots, which are characteristic of this building.\n\nI will provide a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the city from the provided image.\n\n    The image displays the unique ceiling architecture of the McCormick Place\n    West Building in Chicago, Illinois.

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    This picture was taken in 2024.
