    "I will identify the insect in the image and provide its scientific name using a Python script.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the image to identify the insect. The insect is black and orange/red, with long antennae, and is perched on a yellow flower that appears to be goldenrod. Its markings, particularly the orange band behind the head and the general body shape, are characteristic of the Small Milkweed Bug.\n\nThe scientific name for the Small Milkweed Bug is *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\nNow, I will write a Python script to print this scientific name.\n\n```python\ndef get_scientific_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function returns the scientific name of the insect identified in the image.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The insect in the image is identified as a Small Milkweed Bug.\n  scientific_name = \"Lygaeus kalmii\"\n  print(f\"The scientific name of the animal is: {scientific_name}\")\n\nget_scientific_name()\n```\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"
