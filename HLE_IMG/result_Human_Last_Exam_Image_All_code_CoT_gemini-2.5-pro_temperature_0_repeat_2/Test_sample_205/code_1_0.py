# Plan:
# 1. Define the rule: The number of lines in the third cell of a row is the sum of the lines in the first two cells.
# 2. Apply the rule to the third row to find the number of lines in the missing cell.
# 3. The number of lines in the first cell of row 3 is interpreted as 3.
# 4. The number of lines in the second cell of row 3 is 2 (a semi-circle and a straight line).
# 5. Calculate the required number of lines for the missing cell.

num_lines_cell_3_1 = 3
num_lines_cell_3_2 = 2

# Applying the rule L(C3) = L(C1) + L(C2)
num_lines_missing_cell = num_lines_cell_3_1 + num_lines_cell_3_2

print("Rule: Number of lines in Cell 3 = Number of lines in Cell 1 + Number of lines in Cell 2")
print("Equation for Row 3:")
print(f"{num_lines_cell_3_1} + {num_lines_cell_3_2} = {num_lines_missing_cell}")
print("\nThe missing shape must have 5 lines.")
print("Analyzing the choices:")
print("Choice 1: 1 line")
print("Choice 2: 4 lines")
print("Choice 3: 5 lines (2 for ovals + 3 for triangle)")
print("Choice 4: 2 lines")
print("Choice 5: 3 lines")
print("\nThe correct option is Choice 3.")
