# The task is to identify the correct giraffe from the options provided.
# By carefully comparing the unique spot patterns of the target giraffe
# with each of the options (A, B, C, D, E, F), we can find the match.

# Step 1: Analyze the distinctive pattern on the target giraffe's shoulder and torso.
# Key features include a large, dark, triangular spot on the shoulder,
# with a smaller, elongated spot directly below it.

# Step 2: Compare this key pattern with each option.
# - Option A: Different color and pattern.
# - Option B: The pattern on the shoulder and torso is a clear match to the target.
# - Option C: Different pattern (smaller, rounder spots).
# - Option D: Different color (darker) and pattern (blockier).
# - Option E: The shoulder pattern does not match the target's distinctive spots.
# - Option F: The pattern appears different and is blurry.

# Step 3: Conclude that option B shows the same giraffe as the target.
