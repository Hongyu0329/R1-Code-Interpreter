    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Analyze the tiling's components:** We first identify the repeating shapes in the pattern. The tiling is constructed from dark blue regular hexagons, light yellow squares, orange rhombi, and light yellow irregular pentagons.\n2.  **Identify centers of rotation:** We look for points in the tiling around which a rotation will leave the entire pattern unchanged.\n3.  **Determine the order of rotation:** For each center of rotation, we find the smallest angle of rotation that preserves the pattern. If this angle is `360/n` degrees, the symmetry is `n`-fold.\n4.  **Identify the highest order:** A tiling can have multiple types of rotational symmetry. The overall rotational symmetry is typically defined as the highest order of symmetry present.\n\nBy inspecting the image, we can find several centers of rotation. Let's focus on the most prominent ones:\n*   **Center of a Hexagon:** If we pick the center of any dark blue hexagon and rotate the pattern, we find that it maps onto itself after a rotation of 60 degrees. This is a 6-fold rotation, since `360 / 6 = 60`.\n*   **Center of a Square:** If we pick the center of any light yellow square and rotate the pattern, it appears to map onto itself after a rotation of 90 degrees. This would be a 4-fold rotation, since `360 / 4 = 90`.\n\nThe pattern exhibits multiple rotational symmetries. To answer the question \"what is the rotational symmetry?\", we take the highest order found. Between 6-fold and 4-fold symmetry, the highest order is 6.\n\n```python\ndef find_rotational_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the rotational symmetry of the provided tiling.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the rotational symmetry of the tiling...\")\n\n    # Step 1: Identify potential centers of rotation and their orders.\n    # By inspecting the pattern, we can identify centers of rotation at the center of the hexagons.\n    order_at_hexagon = 6\n    angle_at_hexagon = 360 / order_at_hexagon\n\n    print(f\"A rotation around the center of a hexagon by {int(angle_at_hexagon)} degrees leaves the pattern unchanged.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to a {order_at_hexagon}-fold rotational symmetry.\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: 360 / {order_at_hexagon} = {int(angle_at_hexagon)}\")\n\n    # We can also observe apparent symmetry at the center of the squares.\n    order_at_square = 4\n    angle_at_square = 360 / order_at_square\n    print(f\"\\nA rotation around the center of a square by {int(angle_at_square)} degrees appears to leave the pattern unchanged.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to a {order_at_square}-fold rotational symmetry.\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: 360 / {order_at_square} = {int(angle_at_square)}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the overall rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n    # The rotational symmetry of the entire pattern is defined by the highest order of symmetry found.\n    highest_order = max(order_at_hexagon, order_at_square)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe overall rotational symmetry of a pattern is the highest order of rotational symmetry it possesses.\")\n    print(f\"The highest order found is {highest_order}.\")\n\nfind_rotational_symmetry()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
