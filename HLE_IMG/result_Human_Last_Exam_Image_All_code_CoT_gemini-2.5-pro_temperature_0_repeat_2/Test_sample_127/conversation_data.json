    "To determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely, we need to analyze the steric hindrance around the single bond connecting each phenyl ring to the main molecular structure. Free rotation is possible only when there is enough space for the ring to turn without clashing with other atoms.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the rings in question:** The problem asks about the peripheral phenyl rings, which are labeled G, H, J, K, and L.\n\n2.  **Analyze the molecular structure:** The central Iridium (Ir) atom is in a crowded coordination environment, forming an octahedral complex. Steric hindrance will be significant for any groups positioned close to the metal center or other bulky ligands.\n\n3.  **Evaluate each ring's position:**\n    *   **Rings H and J:** These rings are attached at position 4 of the larger rings A and C, respectively. This is a *para* position, which points away from the central Iridium atom and the rest of the complex. Due to this remote location, there is minimal steric hindrance, and rings **H** and **J** can rotate freely.\n    *   **Rings K and L:** These rings are attached at position 6 of the phenyl rings A and C. These positions are *ortho* to the bond connecting to the pyridine rings (B and D) and are very close to the central Iridium atom. The space around them is filled by other ligands (like the E-F ligand system). This severe steric crowding will prevent rings **K** and **L** from rotating freely.\n    *   **Ring G:** This ring is attached at position 6 of the pyridine ring D. This position is *ortho* to the coordinating nitrogen atom. In the packed octahedral geometry, a substituent at this position will point directly towards an adjacent ligand, leading to a significant steric clash. Therefore, ring **G** cannot rotate freely.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, only rings H and J are free from significant steric hindrance and can rotate freely.\n\n```python\ndef solve_molecule_rotation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the rotation of phenyl rings in the given Iridium complex.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of phenyl ring rotation:\")\n    print(\"1.
