    This function solves the SWNT plot identification problem.

    The solution is based on analyzing the electronic and structural properties
    of (4,m) SWNTs for m = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

    Properties of (4,m) SWNTs:
    - (4,0): Semiconducting (n-m=4). Zigzag. Largest band gap among the semiconductors.
    - (4,1): Metallic (n-m=3). Chiral.
    - (4,2): Semiconducting (n-m=2). Chiral. Medium band gap.
    - (4,3): Semiconducting (n-m=1). Chiral. Smallest band gap.
    - (4,4): Metallic (n-m=0). Armchair. Highly symmetric.

    Plot Analysis:
    - Metallic plots show bands crossing E=0 (dipole plots) or cutting lines passing
      through K/K' points (oscillator plots).
    - Armchair (4,4) is uniquely identified by its high symmetry and, in the dipole
      plot, bands crossing exactly at the center (k=0). This maps m=4 to plots #1 and #2.
    - Chiral metallic (4,1) is the other metallic case. This maps m=1 to plots #7 and #8.
    - Semiconducting plots show a band gap. They are distinguished by gap size and
      number of bands (which correlates with the number of atoms in the unit cell).
    - (4,0) has the largest gap and fewest bands/lines. This maps m=0 to plots #9 and #6.
    - (4,3) has the smallest gap and most bands/lines. This maps m=3 to plot #5.
      (Its oscillator plot is the one stated to be missing).
    - (4,2) has intermediate properties. This maps m=2 to plots #3 and #4.
