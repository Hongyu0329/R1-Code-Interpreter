    "This piece is characterized by its dramatic shifts in dynamics, virtuosic arpeggios, and rich, dense chords, all hallmarks of the Russian Romantic era. The key signature is B minor, and the time signature is 4/4. Based on these stylistic elements and the specific melodic and harmonic content, the piece is identifiable.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print the name of the composer and the piece.\n\n```python\ndef guess_the_music():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the musical piece\n    based on the provided sheet music.\n    \"\"\"\n    composer = \"Sergei Rachmaninoff\"\n    piece_title = \"Prelude in B minor\"\n    opus_number = \"Op. 32\"\n    movement_number = \"No. 10\"\n\n    print(f\"The piece is: {piece_title}, {opus_number}, {movement_number}\")\n    print(f\"The composer is: {composer}\")\n\nguess_the_music()\n```\n<<<Sergei Rachmaninoff - Prelude in B minor, Op. 32, No. 10>>>"
