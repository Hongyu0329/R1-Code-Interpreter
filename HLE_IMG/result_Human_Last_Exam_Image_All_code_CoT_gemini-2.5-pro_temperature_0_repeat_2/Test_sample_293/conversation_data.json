    "This is a medical diagnosis task. I will first analyze the provided histopathology image to identify key features and arrive at a diagnosis. Then, as requested, I will present this diagnosis using a simple Python script.\n\n**My thinking process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The image provided is a high-magnification view of a kidney glomerulus, stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E).\n2.  **Identify Key Pathological Features:**\n    *   The most striking feature is the large, crescent-shaped, cellular proliferation that fills Bowman's space (the space between the glomerular capillary tuft and the outer capsule).\n    *   This \"crescent\" is composed of numerous packed cells, including parietal epithelial cells and infiltrating inflammatory cells like macrophages. This is a classic \"cellular crescent\".\n    *   The glomerular tuft itself is compressed and appears hypercellular. There might be areas of fibrinoid necrosis (indicated by the bright pink, smudgy material).\n    *   The surrounding tubules show signs of injury.\n3.  **Formulate the Diagnosis:** The presence of extensive cellular crescents is the hallmark of **Crescentic Glomerulonephritis**. This is a severe pattern of glomerular injury that is clinically associated with Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN), a medical emergency characterized by a rapid decline in kidney function.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to output this diagnosis.\n\n```python\ndef get_histopathological_diagnosis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the key features of the provided image and returns the diagnosis.\n\n    The image shows a kidney glomerulus with the following features:\n    1. A large, cellular, crescent-shaped structure filling Bowman's space.\n    2. Compression of the glomerular capillary tuft.\n    3. Hypercellularity within the glomerulus.\n\n    These findings are characteristic of a specific type of severe glomerular injury.\n    \"\"\"\n    diagnosis = \"Crescentic Glomerulonephritis\"\n    return diagnosis\n\n# Print the final diagnosis\nprint(f\"The histopathological diagnosis is: {get_histopathological_diagnosis()}\")\n```\n<<<Crescentic Glomerulonephritis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the histopathological diagnosis of this image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
