    # Step 1: Identify Carl Sagan's "X of Y" phrase.
    # The riddle describes Sagan's view on Earth's images from space.
    # The most fitting phrase is "Shore of the Cosmic Ocean".
    X = "Shore"
    Y = "Ocean"

    # Step 2: Identify the crater and its name's etymology.
    # The crater in the image is the "Sagan" crater on Mars.
    # The riddle connects the name's etymology to the phrase.
    # A plausible Old English origin for the name "Sagan" links it to "s√¶", meaning "sea" or "ocean".

    # Step 3: Conclude the answer.
    # The phrase is "Shore of the Ocean". Therefore, Y is "Ocean".
