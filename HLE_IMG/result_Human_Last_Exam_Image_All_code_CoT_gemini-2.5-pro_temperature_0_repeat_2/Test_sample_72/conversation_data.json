    "Based on the principles of pericyclic reactions and the photochemical conditions specified, the transformation can be broken down into two sequential, photochemically allowed steps.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reactant:** Hexafluorobenzene is an aromatic compound with a 6π-electron system. Under photochemical conditions (hv), benzene and its derivatives are known to undergo a valence isomerization to form \"Dewar benzene\". This is a 6π-electron electrocyclic ring closure. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 6π (or 4n+2 π) electrocyclic reaction is photochemically allowed. This is our first pericyclic reaction.\n2.  **Analyze the second step:** The product of the first step, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (hexafluoro-bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene), is a highly strained molecule containing two double bonds (two 2π systems). This reactive intermediate is in the presence of cyclobutene, which also has a double bond (a 2π system). The reaction between two alkene-like π systems under photochemical conditions is a [2π+2π] cycloaddition. This reaction is also photochemically allowed by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. This is our second pericyclic reaction.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Although the final product drawn in the image appears to be the result of further complex rearrangements or fragmentation (as a simple addition of the reactants does not match the product's atomic composition), the most plausible sequence of two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions starting from the given reactants is a [6π] electrocyclic reaction followed by a [2π+2π] cycloaddition.\n\nThe following Python code will print the types of these two reactions.\n\n```python\ndef identify_pericyclic_reactions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the two types of photochemically allowed\n    pericyclic reactions involved in the transformation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The first reaction is the photochemical isomerization of hexafluorobenzene.\n    reaction1_type = \"electrocyclic reaction\"\n    reaction1_electrons = 6\n\n    # The second reaction is the photochemical addition of the intermediate to cyclobutene.\n    reaction2_type = \"cycloaddition\"\n    reaction2_electrons_a = 2\n    reaction2_electrons_b = 2\n\n    # The final answer describes these two reactions.\n    print(f\"The two pericyclic reactions involved are a [{reaction1_electrons}π] {reaction1_type} and a [{reaction2_electrons_a}π + {reaction2_electrons_b}π] {reaction2_type}.\")\n\nidentify_pericyclic_reactions()\n```\n<<<A [6π] electrocyclic reaction and a [2π+2π] cycloaddition.>>>"
