    "To calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the total relative Car VMT for the Baseline scenario.** For each distance category, we multiply the share of total trips by the total car mode share (sum of 'car, 1 occupant' and 'car, with more than 2 occupants') and the average trip distance. Then, we sum these values across all distance categories.\n2.  **Calculate the total relative Car VMT for the Proposed scenario.** We will perform the same calculation as in step 1, but using the mode share data from the \"Proposed\" table.\n3.  **Calculate the percentage reduction.** The formula is: `((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100`.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Redirect stdout to capture print output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# --- Data from the tables ---\n\n# Share of total trips and average distance for each category (same for both tables)\n# Categories: 0-3 miles, 3-5 miles, 5-10 miles, 10+ miles\nshare_of_total_trips = [0.48, 0.22, 0.14, 0.16]\navg_trip_distance = [1, 4, 7.5, 20]\n\n# --- Baseline Data (Table 1) ---\n# Mode share for 'car, 1 occupant'\nbaseline_car1_share = [0.25, 0.38, 0.40, 0.42]\n# Mode share for 'car, with more than 2 occupants'\nbaseline_car2_share = [0.28, 0.43, 0.45, 0.47]\n\n# --- Proposed Data (Table 2) ---\n# Mode share for 'car, 1 occupant'\nproposed_car1_share = [0.01, 0.08, 0.14, 0.16]\n# Mode share for 'car, with more than 2 occupants'\nproposed_car2_share = [0.02, 0.19, 0.27, 0.33]\n\n# --- Calculation ---\n\ndef calculate_vmt(car1_shares, car2_shares):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the total relative VMT based on car mode shares.\"\"\"\n    total_vmt = 0\n    for i in range(len(share_of_total_trips)):\n        # Total car mode share for the distance category\n        total_car_share = car1_shares[i] + car2_shares[i]\n        # Weighted VMT for the category\n        vmt_category = share_of_total_trips[i] * total_car_share * avg_trip_distance[i]\n        total_vmt += vmt_category\n    return total_vmt\n\n# Calculate VMT for both scenarios\nbaseline_vmt = calculate_vmt(baseline_car1_share, baseline_car2_share)\nproposed_vmt = calculate_vmt(proposed_car1_share, proposed_car2_share)\n\n# Calculate the percentage reduction\npercentage_reduction = ((baseline_vmt - proposed_vmt) / baseline_vmt) * 100\n\n# --- Output ---\n\nprint(f\"Baseline Car VMT: {baseline_vmt:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Proposed Car VMT: {proposed_vmt:.4f}\")\nprint(\"\\nTo find the percentage reduction in Car VMT, we use the formula:\")\nprint(\"Percentage Reduction = ((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100\")\nprint(\"\\nPlugging in the calculated values:\")\nprint(f\"Percentage Reduction = (({baseline_vmt:.4f} - {proposed_vmt:.4f}) / {baseline_vmt:.4f}) * 100\")\nprint(f\"Percentage Reduction = {baseline_vmt - proposed_vmt:.4f} / {baseline_vmt:.4f} * 100\")\nprint(f\"The percentage of Car VMT that can be reduced is: {percentage_reduction:.1f}%\")\n\n# Restore stdout\nsys.stdout = old_stdout\n# Get the captured output\noutput = captured_output.getvalue()\nprint(output)\n\n# Final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{percentage_reduction:.1f}>>>\")\n```"
