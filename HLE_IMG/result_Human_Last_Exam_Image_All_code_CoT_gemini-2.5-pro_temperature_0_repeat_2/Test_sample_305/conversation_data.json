    "This is a historical trivia question. I will identify the product based on the clues provided in the advertisement and the prompt.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Context:** The image is a British advertisement from World War II. It shows a woman working on what appears to be a tank, with the headline \"Women are winning the War - of Freedom\". This highlights the crucial role women played in industrial production during the war.\n2.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **\"Overcome inherent limitations\":** During WWII, women took on physically demanding jobs previously held by men. A common advertising angle was to offer products that provided energy, strength, and stamina to help them cope with this new physical strain. The \"limitation\" is likely fatigue or lack of physical strength.\n    *   **\"French-derived name\":** This is a specific linguistic clue.\n3.  **Synthesize and Identify:** The advertisement is a well-known one for **Bovril**, a beef extract product.\n    *   **Function:** Bovril was famously marketed as a drink that gives you strength and energy, with slogans like \"Bovril puts beef into you.\" This perfectly matches the idea of helping workers \"overcome inherent limitations\" like fatigue.\n    *   **Name Etymology:** The name \"Bovril\" was coined by its inventor. The \"Bo-\" part comes from the Latin *bos*, meaning ox, which is also the root of the French word for beef, *boeuf*. This fits the \"French-derived name\" clue.\n\nThe product is Bovril. I will now provide the final answer in the requested format.\n<<<Bovril>>>"
