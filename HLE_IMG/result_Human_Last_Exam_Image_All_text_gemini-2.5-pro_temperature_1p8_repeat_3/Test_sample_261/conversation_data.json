    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the book title:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the image fragment.**\nThe image displays a small section of what appears to be a painting or illustration. We can identify the following key elements:\n*   **A Creature:** The central figure is a white, ethereal, four-legged creature in motion. It has a horse-like body and a single horn protruding from its forehead, identifying it as a unicorn. Its form is semi-transparent and glowing with a bluish-white light, suggesting it might be a magical entity or a spirit.\n*   **The Setting:** The unicorn is in a dark, shadowy area. To the right, there is a large, ornate pillar or column, which is lit with a warm, yellowish light.\n*   **Art Style:** The style is painterly and realistic-fantasy, common for the covers of fantasy novels.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the visual clues to a specific story or series.**\nThe combination of a unicorn (especially a glowing, spirit-like one) and a grand architectural setting is a strong clue.\n*   The glowing, silvery animal is highly reminiscent of a Patronus, a key form of magic in the *Harry Potter* series. A Patronus is a defensive charm that produces a spirit-guardian, which often takes the form of a silvery-white animal.\n*   The artist for the original US editions of the *Harry Potter* series is Mary GrandPré, and this illustration's style is consistent with her work.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific book in the series.**\nWe need to determine which *Harry Potter* book cover features this specific scene.\n*   The main events involving multiple Patronuses being practiced in a large, pillar-filled room occur in *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, during the Dumbledore's Army meetings in the Room of Requirement.\n*   Checking the cover of *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* (the US edition by Mary GrandPré), we find that the image fragment is not on the front cover. However, the art on these editions often wraps around to the back.\n*   Upon examining the full, wrap-around dust jacket illustration for *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*, this exact image of the unicorn Patronus running out of a dark archway next to a large pillar is found on the back cover.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the identification.**\nThe fragment is a detail from the back cover illustration of the original US edition of *Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix*.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix>>>"
