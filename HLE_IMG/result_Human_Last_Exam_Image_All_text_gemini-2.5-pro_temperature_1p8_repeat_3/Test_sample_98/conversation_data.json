    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the century of the medallion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Object's Features:** The object is a circular medallion with a top tang, suggesting it was meant to be suspended or attached. The image on the medallion is created in relief and depicts two figures in profile, facing each other. The figure on the left is particularly detailed, showing a very stylized hairstyle with rows of tight curls and a prominent curved ram's horn. This artistic representation, especially the treatment of hair and the formal, confrontational pose, is highly distinctive.\n\n2.  **Identify the Artistic Style and Culture:** The specific stylistic elements are characteristic of Sassanian art. The Sassanian Empire (224–651 AD) ruled over Persia (modern Iran) and much of the surrounding region. Sassanian royal art is known for its majestic and formal depictions of rulers, often shown with elaborate crowns, stylized hair and beards, and symbols of power and divinity. The ram's horn, for instance, is a symbol of victory and royal fortune (farr). This style is clearly distinct from Roman or Byzantine art of the same period.\n\n3.  **Identify the Specific Artifact:** This is a famous and well-documented artifact known as the \"Great Medallion\" or \"Great Sasanian Medallion\". It is made of gold and is housed in the Cabinet des Médailles at the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris.\n\n4.  **Determine the Historical Dating:** Art historians and archaeologists have studied this medallion extensively. While the precise identity of the two figures is a subject of scholarly debate (possibilities include a king with his heir or a king with a divinity), the strongest evidence, based on stylistic comparisons with Sassanian rock reliefs and coinage, points to the reign of King Shapur II.\n\n5.  **Pinpoint the Century:** Shapur II reigned from 309 AD to 379 AD. This entire period falls within the 4th century AD. Therefore, archaeologists confidently ascribe this medallion to the 4th century AD.\n\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
