    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the scientific name of the animal.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the subject of the image.**\nThe central subject is a small insect resting on a cluster of yellow flowers. The insect is the animal to be identified.\n\n**Step 2: Observe the key features of the insect.**\n*   **Order:** The insect has the characteristic features of a true bug (Order: Hemiptera), including long antennae, a distinct head, thorax, and abdomen, and what appears to be hardened forewings (hemelytra) covering the hindwings. It has a triangular section behind the head called a scutellum, which is typical for many true bugs.\n*   **Coloration:** The insect exhibits a distinct and striking color pattern of black and reddish-orange.\n    *   The head is primarily black with some orange markings.\n    *   The section directly behind the head (the pronotum) has a prominent reddish-orange band.\n    *   The wings (hemelytra) are mostly black but have a reddish-orange \"X\" shape on the back, though only a part of it is clearly visible from this angle.\n    *   The legs and antennae are black.\n*   **Size and Shape:** It is a relatively small, elongated-oval-shaped bug.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the context (the plant).**\nThe insect is on a cluster of small, bright yellow flowers. This plant is characteristic of Goldenrod (*Solidago* genus), which blooms in late summer and fall. Many insects, including bugs, are found on goldenrod to feed on nectar or prey on other insects.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate a hypothesis for identification.**\nBased on the distinctive black and orange \"X\" pattern and the orange band on the pronotum, the insect strongly resembles the Small Milkweed Bug.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the hypothesis.**\n*   **Common Name:** Small Milkweed Bug.\n*   **Scientific Name:** *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n*   **Comparison:** Comparing the insect in the image to reference photos of *Lygaeus kalmii* confirms the identification. The pattern of the orange band behind the black head and the X-like markings on the back are defining characteristics of this species.\n*   **Habitat:** While its primary host plant is milkweed (*Asclepias*), where it feeds on seeds, the Small Milkweed Bug is often found on a variety of other plants, especially flowering ones like goldenrod, particularly later in the season. This context is consistent with the identification.\n\n**Step 6: Distinguish from similar species.**\n*   It is not the Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*), which is larger and has a broad black band across its orange wings, not an 'X' pattern.\n*   It is not the Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*), which is darker overall with finer red lines outlining the wings and thorax.\n\n**Step 7: Final Conclusion.**\nThe insect depicted is a Small Milkweed Bug. The question asks for the scientific name. Therefore, the correct answer is the binomial name for this species.\n\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"
