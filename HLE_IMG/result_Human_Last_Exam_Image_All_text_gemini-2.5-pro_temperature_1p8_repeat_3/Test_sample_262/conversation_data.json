    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks to determine which of the four depicted iridium complexes will have shorter operational lifetimes when used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). Shorter lifetime corresponds to lower chemical stability of the complex under device operating conditions.\n\n2.  **Analyze the General Structure of the Complexes:**\n    *   All four compounds are cationic Iridium(III) complexes with a pseudo-octahedral geometry.\n    *   The general formula is `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+ PF6-`.\n    *   The central metal is Iridium(III).\n    *   `C^N` represents a cyclometalating ligand, a derivative of 2-phenylpyridine, which coordinates to the Iridium through a carbon atom of the phenyl ring and a nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring. There are two such ligands in each complex.\n    *   `N^N` represents a diimine ligand, which is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dtbpy) for all four complexes. This ligand is bulky, which helps improve stability by preventing aggregation.\n    *   `PF6-` is the counterion.\n    *   The key difference between the four complexes lies in the substitution pattern on the phenyl ring of the `C^N` ligands.\n\n3.  **Relate Molecular Structure to Emitter Lifetime:**\n    *   The operational lifetime of these emitters is limited by their chemical degradation.\n    *   A primary factor influencing the stability of such iridium complexes is the substitution pattern on the ligands, especially the cyclometalating phenylpyridine (`ppy`-type) ligands.\n    *   Fluorination (substituting hydrogen atoms with fluorine atoms) on the `ppy` ligand is a common strategy to increase stability. C-F bonds are stronger than C-H bonds, and electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms can lower the HOMO energy level, making the complex more resistant to oxidation.\n    *   However, there is a well-documented \"fatal flaw\" in the design of these complexes. The presence of a fluorine atom at a specific position on the phenyl ring can dramatically decrease the stability of the complex, leading to rapid degradation and a short lifetime.\n\n4.  **Identify the Critical Structural Feature for Instability:**\n    *   Let's define the positions on the phenyl ring of the 2-phenylpyridine ligand. The carbon attached to the pyridine ring is C1'. The carbon that is cyclometalated (bonded to Ir) is C2'. The remaining carbons are C3', C4', C5', and C6' in sequence.\n    *   Scientific literature has extensively shown that a fluorine atom at the **C6' position** (ortho to the C-N bond, i.e., the carbon next to the one bonded to the pyridine ring) makes the iridium complex highly unstable. This C6'-F bond is sterically hindered and electronically activated, making it prone to cleavage, which initiates the degradation of the entire molecule.\n\n5.  **Examine Each Complex for the \"Fatal Flaw\" (C6'-F bond):**\n    *   **Complex 1:** The `C^N` ligands are fluorinated at the C4' and C5' positions of the phenyl ring (meta and para to the C-Ir bond). There is no fluorine atom at the C6' position. This complex is expected to be relatively stable.\n    *   **Complex 2:** The `C^N` ligands are fluorinated at the C4' and **C6'** positions. The presence of the fluorine atom at the C6' position is the critical instability factor. Therefore, **Complex 2 is expected to have a short lifetime.**\n    *   **Complex 3:** The `C^N` ligands are fluorinated at the C3', C4', and C5' positions. The fluorine at C3' is ortho to the C-Ir bond, which can cause some steric strain but is not associated with the severe instability of a C6'-F substituent. There is no fluorine at the C6' position. This complex is expected to be relatively stable.\n    *   **Complex 4:** The `C^N` ligands are fluorinated at the C3', C4', C5', and **C6'** positions. Like Complex 2, this complex contains a fluorine atom at the problematic C6' position. Therefore, **Complex 4 is also expected to have a short lifetime.**\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis, Complexes [2] and [4] both contain a fluorine substituent at the C6' position of their cyclometalating ligands. This structural feature is known to cause significant chemical instability and thus lead to shorter device lifetimes. Complexes [1] and [3] lack this feature and are therefore expected to be more stable.\n\n7.  **Select the Correct Answer Choice:** The complexes expected to show shorter lifetimes are [2] and [4]. This corresponds to answer choice I.\n\n<<<I>>>"
