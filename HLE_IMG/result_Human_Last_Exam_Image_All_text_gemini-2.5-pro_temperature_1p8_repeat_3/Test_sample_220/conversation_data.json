    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which image represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Structure**\nAn FCC crystal structure consists of atoms at the eight corners of a cube and at the center of each of the six faces. A primitive unit cell contains 4 atoms. The basis atoms can be represented by fractional coordinates (0, 0, 0), (1/2, 1/2, 0), (1/2, 0, 1/2), and (0, 1/2, 1/2) within a cubic unit cell of side length 'a'.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Viewing Direction [110]**\nThe direction [110] points along a face diagonal of the cubic unit cell. Viewing a 3D structure along a specific direction involves projecting all the atom positions onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to this viewing direction. The plane perpendicular to the [110] vector is the (110) plane.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Projected Pattern**\nTo find the pattern, we can determine how the atoms of the FCC lattice project onto the (110) plane.\n1.  **Define Projection Axes:** The viewing plane is perpendicular to the [110] direction. We can choose two orthogonal axes within this plane to describe the projected pattern. Convenient choices are the `[001]` direction and the `[1 -1 0]` direction.\n2.  **Project the Unit Cell:** When we project the cubic unit cell onto this plane, it forms a rectangle. The side of the rectangle along the `[001]` direction has length `a`. The side along the `[1 -1 0]` direction has length equal to the cube's body diagonal, which is `a√2`. So, the projected unit cell is a rectangle with dimensions `a × a√2`.\n3.  **Project the Atoms:** We need to find the projected positions of the atoms within this rectangle. The atoms in an FCC lattice, when viewed along [110], form layers.\n    * One set of atoms forms a rectangular grid corresponding to the corners of these `a × a√2` rectangles.\n    * Another set of atoms (originating from different planes along the viewing direction) projects exactly into the center of these rectangles.\n4.  **Resulting Pattern:** This arrangement creates a **centered rectangular** lattice. The pattern consists of rectangles with atoms at each corner and an additional atom at the very center of each rectangle.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Given Images**\nNow, let's examine each of the four patterns to see which one matches the centered rectangular structure.\n\n*   **Image A:** This pattern shows atoms arranged in vertical columns. The middle column is shifted vertically with respect to the side columns. If we define a rectangle using four atoms (e.g., two from the left column and two from the right), the atom from the middle column does not lie at the center of this rectangle. This is not a centered rectangular pattern.\n*   **Image B:** This image clearly displays a centered rectangular (or in this specific drawing, centered square) pattern. We can identify sets of four atoms forming a rectangle with a fifth atom located at the exact center. For example, consider the atoms at approximate coordinates (1, 2.5), (7, 2.5), (1, 8.5), and (7, 8.5). These four atoms form a rectangle. The atom at (4, 5.5) is precisely at the center of this rectangle `( (1+7)/2, (2.5+8.5)/2 ) = (4, 5.5)`. This pattern repeats throughout the image. This matches our theoretical prediction for an FCC lattice viewed along [110]. The fact that the rectangle is drawn as a square (aspect ratio of 1 instead of √2) is a common simplification in such diagrams.\n*   **Image C:** This pattern shows atoms arranged in a way that forms a grid of rhombuses (tilted squares). The angles are not 90 degrees. This is not a centered rectangular pattern. This pattern is characteristic of a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice viewed along the [100] direction, represented with perspective.\n*   **Image D:** This pattern displays a hexagonal arrangement. Atoms are closely packed, and a six-fold rotational symmetry is apparent. This is the characteristic pattern of an FCC lattice viewed along the [111] direction (the close-packed plane).\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, the centered rectangular pattern is the hallmark of an FCC structure viewed along the [110] direction. Image B is the only one that exhibits this specific arrangement.\n\n<<<B>>>"
