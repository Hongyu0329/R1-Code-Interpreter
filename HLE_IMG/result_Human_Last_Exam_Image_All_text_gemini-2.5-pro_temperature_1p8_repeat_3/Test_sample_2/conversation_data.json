    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given sorting algorithm's time complexity.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algorithm's Logic\n\nLet's break down the pseudocode for `sort(a, n)`:\n\n```python\ndef sort(a, n):\n  if n > 1:\n    # Step A: Recursively call sort on the first n-1 elements.\n    sort(a, n - 1) \n    \n    # Step B: Compare the last two elements of the current subarray and swap if out of order.\n    # The subarray being considered has size n (indices 0 to n-1).\n    # The last two elements are at indices n-1 and n-2.\n    if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n      swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])\n      \n    # Step C: Recursively call sort on the first n-1 elements AGAIN.\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n```\n\nThe algorithm has a base case: `if n <= 1`, it does nothing and returns. For larger arrays (`n > 1`), it performs two recursive calls on a subproblem of size `n-1` and a constant amount of work (one comparison and one potential swap) in between.\n\nA crucial point to note is that the second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` in Step C is **always** executed if `n > 1`. It is not conditional on the `if` statement in Step B.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Recurrence Relation\n\nTo find the time complexity, we can define a recurrence relation `T(n)` that represents the number of operations performed by `sort(a, n)`.\n\n*   **Base Case:** If `n <= 1`, the algorithm performs a constant number of operations (just the check `n > 1`). So, `T(1) = c_1` for some constant `c_1`. We can write this as `O(1)`.\n\n*   **Recursive Case:** If `n > 1`, the algorithm performs:\n    1.  The first recursive call: `sort(a, n - 1)`, which takes `T(n-1)` time.\n    2.  The comparison and potential swap: This takes a constant amount of time, `c_2`. We can write this as `O(1)`.\n    3.  The second recursive call: `sort(a, n - 1)`, which also takes `T(n-1)` time.\n\nCombining these parts, the total time is:\n`T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-1) + c_2`\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c_2`\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Recurrence Relation\n\nWe need to solve the recurrence `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`. We can do this by expansion (also known as the substitution method).\n\n1.  `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n2.  Substitute `T(n-1) = 2 * T(n-2) + c`:\n    `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n3.  Substitute `T(n-2) = 2 * T(n-3) + c`:\n    `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n\nA pattern emerges. After `k` steps of expansion:\n`T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^{k-1} + 2^{k-2} + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n\nWe continue expanding until we reach the base case `T(1)`. This happens when `n-k = 1`, which means `k = n-1`. Let's substitute `k = n-1`:\n`T(n) = 2^{n-1} * T(1) + c * (2^{n-2} + 2^{n-3} + ... + 1)`\n\nThe sum `(2^{n-2} + ... + 1)` is a geometric series with sum `(2^{n-1} - 1) / (2 - 1) = 2^{n-1} - 1`.\nSince `T(1)` is a constant, let's call it `d`.\n\n`T(n) = 2^{n-1} * d + c * (2^{n-1} - 1)`\n`T(n) = d*2^{n-1} + c*2^{n-1} - c`\n`T(n) = (d + c) * 2^{n-1} - c`\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Asymptotic Complexity (Big-O)\n\nThe dominant term in the expression for `T(n)` is `(d + c) * 2^{n-1}`. In Big-O notation, we ignore constant factors and lower-order terms. Therefore:\n\n`T(n) = O(2^{n-1}) = O(2^n)`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Worst Case:** The question asks for the worst-case complexity. In this particular algorithm, the two recursive calls are always made, regardless of the input data. The path of execution is only dependent on `n`, not the values in the array `a`. Therefore, the best-case, average-case, and worst-case time complexities are all the same: `O(2^n)`.\n*   **Termination:** The recursive calls are on a smaller subproblem (`n-1`), and there is a base case (`n <= 1`). This ensures the algorithm will always terminate and not run forever.\n*   **Comparison to other sorting algorithms:** This exponential complexity is far worse than common sorting algorithms like Merge Sort `O(n log n)` or Bubble Sort `O(n^2)`. It arises from the two recursive calls at each level, which creates a computation tree that grows exponentially.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nThe time complexity is described by the recurrence `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + O(1)`, which solves to `O(2^n)`. This holds true for the worst case.\n\n<<<E>>>"
