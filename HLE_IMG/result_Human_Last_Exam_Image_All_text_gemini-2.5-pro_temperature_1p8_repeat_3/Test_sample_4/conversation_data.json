    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Jones polynomial of the given knot.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Knot**\n1.  **Count the crossings:** By carefully examining the knot diagram, we can count the number of times the rope crosses over or under itself. Starting from any point and following the strand, we can systematically count each crossing. There are a total of 8 crossings.\n2.  **Check for alternating property:** A knot diagram is called alternating if the crossings alternate between \"over\" and \"under\" as one travels along the knot. Let's trace the path of the knot from an arbitrary starting point. If we go over at one crossing, the next crossing along the strand is an under-crossing, the one after that is an over-crossing, and so on. Tracing the knot in the image confirms that this is an alternating knot diagram. For alternating knots, the crossing number is a true invariant and is equal to the number of crossings in the alternating diagram. Therefore, this is a knot with crossing number 8.\n3.  **Identify the specific knot:** We compare the diagram with standard tables of knots, like the Rolfsen knot table. The knot's symmetrical, four-lobed appearance is characteristic of the knot known as **8₁₈**. This can be confirmed by looking up diagrams of 8-crossing knots. The knot 8₁₈ is the last of the 18 alternating knots with 8 crossings. It is also known to be amphichiral, meaning it is indistinguishable from its mirror image.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Jones Polynomial**\nThe Jones polynomial is a knot invariant, meaning it is the same for all diagrams of a given knot. Since we have identified the knot as 8₁₈, we can use the known Jones polynomial for this knot from established mathematical resources. Calculating it from scratch using skein relations is a lengthy and error-prone process.\n\nThe standard Jones polynomial, denoted as $V(t)$, for the knot 8₁₈ is:\n$V(t) = t^4 - t^3 + t^2 - t + 1 - t^{-1} + t^{-2} - t^{-3} + t^{-4}$\n\n**Step 3: Verify the Properties of the Polynomial**\nWe can perform some checks to ensure this polynomial is correct for an alternating, 8-crossing, amphichiral knot.\n1.  **Span:** The span of the Jones polynomial of an alternating knot is equal to its crossing number. The span is the difference between the highest and lowest exponents of *t*.\n    Span = (highest degree) - (lowest degree) = 4 - (-4) = 8.\n    This matches the crossing number of the knot, which is 8.\n2.  **Alternating Coefficients:** For an alternating knot, the coefficients of the polynomial's terms (when ordered by degree) are non-zero integers that alternate in sign.\n    The polynomial is: $1t^4 - 1t^3 + 1t^2 - 1t^1 + 1t^0 - 1t^{-1} + 1t^{-2} - 1t^{-3} + 1t^{-4}$.\n    The signs of the coefficients are (+, -, +, -, +, -, +, -, +), which is alternating. This property holds.\n3.  **Amphichirality:** The knot 8₁₈ is amphichiral. The Jones polynomial of a knot's mirror image is found by replacing *t* with *t⁻¹*. For an amphichiral knot, the polynomial must be unchanged by this substitution, i.e., $V(t) = V(t^{-1})$.\n    $V(t^{-1}) = (t^{-1})^4 - (t^{-1})^3 + (t^{-1})^2 - t^{-1} + 1 - (t^{-1})^{-1} + (t^{-1})^{-2} - (t^{-1})^{-3} + (t^{-1})^{-4}$\n    $V(t^{-1}) = t^{-4} - t^{-3} + t^{-2} - t^{-1} + 1 - t + t^2 - t^3 + t^4$.\n    Reordering the terms in decreasing degree gives the original polynomial. So, this property also holds true.\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer Formulation**\nThe question asks for the Jones polynomial $p(t)$ in decreasing degree order. Based on our analysis, the polynomial is:\n$p(t) = t^4 - t^3 + t^2 - t + 1 - t^{-1} + t^{-2} - t^{-3} + t^{-4}$\n\nThis completes the step-by-step analysis.\n\n<<<t^4 - t^3 + t^2 - t + 1 - t^-1 + t^-2 - t^-3 + t^-4>>>"
