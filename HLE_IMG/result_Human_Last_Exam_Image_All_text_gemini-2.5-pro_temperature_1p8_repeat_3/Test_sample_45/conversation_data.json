    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Concept of Rotational Symmetry:** Rotational symmetry means that if you rotate an object around a central point, it will look exactly the same as it did in its original position at certain angles of rotation. The \"order\" of rotational symmetry (or \"n-fold\" symmetry) is the number of times the object looks identical during a full 360° rotation. For example, 2-fold symmetry means it looks the same after a 180° rotation, 4-fold after a 90° rotation, and 6-fold after a 60° rotation.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Centers of Rotation:** To find the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find points in the pattern that can serve as centers of rotation. The most prominent and regular shapes are good candidates to examine. In this pattern, we can see:\n    *   Dark blue hexagons.\n    *   Light yellow squares.\n    *   Orange rhombi (diamond shapes).\n    *   Larger light yellow polygons.\n\n3.  **Test the Center of a Blue Hexagon:** Let's choose the center of one of the dark blue hexagons as a potential center of rotation.\n    *   A regular hexagon itself has 6-fold rotational symmetry. We must check if the surrounding pattern also respects this symmetry.\n    *   Each blue hexagon is surrounded by six of the larger yellow polygons.\n    *   If we rotate the entire tiling by 60° (which is 360°/6) around the center of a blue hexagon, the hexagon rotates onto itself. Each surrounding yellow polygon moves to the position previously occupied by its neighbor. The orange rhombi and yellow squares further out also shift to the positions of identical shapes.\n    *   The entire pattern perfectly aligns with its original state after a 60° rotation. This can be repeated 6 times in a full circle (at 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300°, and 360°).\n    *   This confirms that there is a point of **6-fold rotational symmetry** at the center of each blue hexagon.\n\n4.  **Test Other Potential Centers (for completeness):**\n    *   **Center of a yellow square:** Let's look at a yellow square. It is surrounded by four orange rhombi and four of the larger yellow polygons. If we rotate the pattern by 90° (360°/4) around the center of a square, the square rotates onto itself, and each surrounding shape lands on an identical shape. This means there are also points of **4-fold rotational symmetry**.\n    *   **Center of an orange rhombus:** A rhombus has 2-fold rotational symmetry. Rotating 180° around its center maps it onto itself, and the adjacent shapes (two yellow squares and two large yellow polygons) swap places with their identical counterparts. This means there are also points of **2-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Overall Symmetry of the Tiling:** A tiling can have multiple types of rotational symmetry centers. When asked for \"the\" rotational symmetry of the entire pattern, the convention is to state the highest order of rotational symmetry found.\n    *   We have found points of 2-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold symmetry.\n    *   The highest order among these is 6-fold.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Focus on the entire pattern:** It's crucial not just to analyze the symmetry of a single tile (like the hexagon) but how the entire arrangement of tiles behaves under rotation.\n*   **Identify the highest order:** The presence of a lower-order symmetry (like 2-fold or 4-fold) does not negate the existence of a higher-order one. The overall classification is determined by the highest symmetry present.\n*   **Use visual cues:** Start with the most regular and symmetric-looking shapes (the hexagons) as they are the most likely candidates for high-order symmetry centers.\n*   **Verify the rotation:** Mentally trace not only the central shape but also its immediate neighbors to ensure the entire local pattern matches after rotation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis shows that the tiling has centers of 6-fold, 4-fold, and 2-fold rotation. The highest order of rotational symmetry present is 6-fold, centered on the blue hexagons. Therefore, the rotational symmetry of the tiling is 6-fold.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
