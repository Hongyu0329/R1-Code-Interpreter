    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the accurate Roman numeral for the circled notes.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key of the piece.**\nThe piece is Mozart's \"Fantasy in D minor\". The key signature shows one flat (Bb), which corresponds to either F major or D minor. The title confirms that the home key is D minor.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the measure and the specific notes.**\nThe question asks for the analysis of the circled notes in measure 8. The circle encloses the harmony played on the third beat of the measure.\n*   **Treble clef (right hand):** The notes played are C# and E.\n*   **Bass clef (left hand):** The notes played are A, C#, and E.\nCombining the notes from both staves, the chord consists of the pitches A, C#, and E.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the chord.**\nThe notes A, C#, and E form an A major triad.\n*   The root is A.\n*   The third is C# (a major third above A).\n*   The fifth is E (a perfect fifth above A).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the chord's function within the key of D minor.**\nTo find the Roman numeral, we need to relate the root of the chord (A) to the tonic of the key (D).\n*   The D minor scale is D, E, F, G, A, Bb, C.\n*   The note A is the 5th degree of the D minor scale. A chord built on the 5th degree is the dominant chord.\n*   In minor keys, the 7th scale degree (C in the natural minor) is often raised to create a leading tone (C#). This makes the dominant chord major (A-C#-E) instead of minor (A-C-E). This is standard practice in common-practice period harmony.\n*   Since the chord is a major triad built on the 5th scale degree, it is represented by an uppercase Roman numeral V.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the inversion of the chord.**\nThe inversion is determined by the lowest sounding note (the bass note). In this case, the lowest note is A, which is the root of the A major chord. When the root of the chord is in the bass, the chord is in **root position**. A root position triad does not require any figured bass numbers next to the Roman numeral.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe circled notes form an A major triad. In the key of D minor, this is the dominant chord (V) in root position.\n\n<<<V>>>"
