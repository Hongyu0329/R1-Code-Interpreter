    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Specimen H**\n*   **Observations:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a very porous, sponge-like texture. The holes are called vesicles, which are formed by gas bubbles escaping from lava as it cooled. This texture is known as vesicular. The color suggests a mafic or intermediate composition with iron that has been oxidized (rusted).\n*   **Inference:** The vesicular texture is characteristic of an extrusive igneous rock, meaning it formed from lava that erupted and cooled quickly on the Earth's surface.\n*   **Identification:** A vesicular, extrusive igneous rock that is typically reddish-brown or black and relatively dense (compared to pumice) is called **Scoria**. It is often referred to as lava rock.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Specimen I**\n*   **Observations:** This specimen is composed of numerous smaller rock fragments (clasts) cemented together. The fragments are of various sizes and appear to be sharp and angular, not smooth or rounded. They are embedded in a finer-grained material called a matrix.\n*   **Inference:** A rock made from fragments of other rocks is a clastic rock. When the fragments are angular, the rock is classified as a breccia. If the fragments were rounded, it would be a conglomerate.\n*   **Identification:** Due to the cemented, angular clasts, this rock is identified as **Breccia**. It could be a sedimentary breccia or a volcanic breccia.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Specimen J**\n*   **Observations:** This rock is very light-colored (white or light gray) and, like specimen H, is full of vesicles. However, the vesicles are generally smaller and more numerous, giving it a frothy appearance. It looks very lightweight.\n*   **Inference:** This is also an extrusive igneous rock that cooled rapidly from a gas-rich lava. The light color indicates a felsic composition (high in silica).\n*   **Identification:** A light-colored, highly vesicular, low-density igneous rock is **Pumice**. Pumice is so porous that it can often float on water.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Specimen K**\n*   **Observations:** This rock is made of large, interlocking mineral crystals that are easily visible. This coarse-grained texture is known as phaneritic. The crystals are exceptionally large. There is a mixture of light-colored minerals (likely feldspar and quartz) and some darker ones.\n*   **Inference:** The phaneritic texture indicates that the rock cooled very slowly, deep within the Earth's crust, allowing large crystals to form. This makes it an intrusive igneous rock.\n*   **Identification:** An intrusive igneous rock with exceptionally large crystals (often several centimeters in size) is known as a **Pegmatite**. It generally has a composition similar to granite.\n\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Pegmatite\n\n<<<\nH: Scoria\nI: Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite\n>>>"
