    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Input:** The request asks for the classification of isomerism between \"the molecules mentioned above.\" However, upon examining the provided space, we see a completely black image. There are no molecular structures, names, or formulas displayed.\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Problem:** The fundamental requirement to answer the question is the knowledge of the structures of the molecules being compared. Without this crucial information, a direct chemical analysis is impossible.\n\n3.  **Review the Definitions of Isomerism and Molecular Relationships:**\n    *   **Identical:** The molecules are the same compound. They have the same molecular formula, the same connectivity, and the same spatial arrangement (they are superimposable). They are not isomers.\n    *   **Isomers:** Molecules that have the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms.\n    *   **Constitutional Isomers:** A type of isomer where molecules have the same molecular formula but different connectivity (i.e., the atoms are bonded in a different order).\n    *   **Stereoisomers:** A type of isomer where molecules have the same molecular formula and the same connectivity, but differ in the three-dimensional arrangement of their atoms in space.\n    *   **Conformers (Conformational Isomers):** A type of stereoisomer that can be interconverted by rotation about single bonds. They represent different temporary shapes of the same molecule.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Possibility of Answering:**\n    *   Since no molecules are shown, we cannot determine their molecular formulas.\n    *   We cannot compare their atomic connectivity.\n    *   We cannot analyze their 3D spatial arrangements.\n    *   Therefore, we cannot definitively classify them as identical, constitutional isomers, or stereoisomers (including conformers).\n\n5.  **Interpret the Question Given the Lack of Information:** There are two main possibilities:\n    *   **Possibility A (Technical Error):** The image of the molecules failed to load. In this case, the question is unanswerable.\n    *   **Possibility B (Literal or \"Trick\" Interpretation):** The question literally refers to what is shown: a black space. If we are asked to compare \"the molecules\" within this space, we could be comparing one part of the black space to another. Since the space is uniform and black, any part is identical to any other part.\n\n6.  **Conclusion based on Interpretation:** While Possibility A (error) is most likely in a real-world scenario, we are asked to provide an answer from the given choices. Following Possibility B, the only logical conclusion is that the entities being compared are identical. If two \"molecules\" are identical, they are not isomers. Option (c) describes this relationship.\n\nTherefore, based on a literal interpretation of the visual information provided, the entities in question are identical.\n\n<<<C>>>"
