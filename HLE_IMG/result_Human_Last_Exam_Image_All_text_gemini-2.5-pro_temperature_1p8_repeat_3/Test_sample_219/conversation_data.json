    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph**\nThe image provided is a raster plot, which displays the firing activity of multiple neurons (or electrodes) over time.\n*   The **Y-axis** represents the Electrode Number, from 0 to 128. Each horizontal row corresponds to a single electrode's activity.\n*   The **X-axis** represents Time, measured in seconds (s), from 0 to 50 seconds.\n*   Each **black dot** represents an action potential (a \"firing\" event) recorded by an electrode at a specific time.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts**\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a period where a large number of electrodes fire intensely and nearly simultaneously. Visually, these appear as dense, vertical bands on the raster plot. We need to locate these bands.\nBy inspecting the graph, we can clearly identify four major synchronized bursts.\n\n**Step 3: Estimate the Timestamps of Each Burst**\nWe will estimate the starting time for each synchronized burst. The start time is the point on the x-axis where the dense vertical band of firing begins.\n*   **Burst 1 (T1):** The first burst starts shortly after t=0. A reasonable estimate for its onset is approximately **t = 1 s**.\n*   **Burst 2 (T2):** The second burst starts before the 20s mark. It appears to begin at approximately **t = 18 s**.\n*   **Burst 3 (T3):** The third burst starts midway between the 30s and 40s marks. Its onset is at approximately **t = 35 s**.\n*   **Burst 4 (T4):** The fourth burst starts just before the 50s mark. Its onset is at approximately **t = 48 s**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time duration between the onsets of consecutive bursts. We have three such intervals to calculate.\n*   **IBI 1:** The time between the start of Burst 2 and Burst 1.\n    IBI₁ = T2 - T1 = 18 s - 1 s = **17 s**\n*   **IBI 2:** The time between the start of Burst 3 and Burst 2.\n    IBI₂ = T3 - T2 = 35 s - 18 s = **17 s**\n*   **IBI 3:** The time between the start of Burst 4 and Burst 3.\n    IBI₃ = T4 - T3 = 48 s - 35 s = **13 s**\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual IBIs and divide by the number of intervals.\n*   Sum of IBIs = 17 s + 17 s + 13 s = 47 s\n*   Number of intervals = 3\n*   Average IBI = (Sum of IBIs) / (Number of intervals) = 47 s / 3 ≈ 15.667 s\n\n**Step 6: Round the Answer to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question asks for the answer to be expressed with two significant figures.\n*   The calculated value is 15.667... s.\n*   The first significant figure is 1.\n*   The second significant figure is 5.\n*   The third digit is 6, which is 5 or greater, so we must round up the second significant figure.\n*   Rounding 15.667... to two significant figures gives **16**.\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is 16 s.\n\n<<<16>>>"
