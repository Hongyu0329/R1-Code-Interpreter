    "**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe user wants to determine the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by comparing a \"Baseline\" scenario (Table 1) with a \"Proposed\" scenario (Table 2).\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Understand the calculation for Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT).**\nVMT represents the total miles traveled by vehicles. To find a representative VMT value (or a VMT index, since we don't have the total number of trips), we need to consider:\n1.  The distribution of trips by distance (`share of total trips`).\n2.  The proportion of those trips made by car for each distance (`mode share`).\n3.  The average length of trips in each distance category (`Average trip distance`).\n\nThe overall VMT index can be calculated by summing the VMT for each distance category.\nVMT index for a category = (`share of total trips`) × (`share of car trips`) × (`average trip distance`).\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The question is about **Vehicle** Miles Traveled, not Person Miles Traveled. Therefore, the data on `Average Carpool Occupancy` is irrelevant and should be ignored. We are concerned with the miles each car travels, regardless of how many people are inside.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The share of car trips for any distance category is the sum of the shares for \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Baseline Car VMT Index (using Table 1 data).**\nWe'll calculate the VMT index for each distance category and sum them.\n\n*   **For 0-3 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 48% (0.48)\n    *   Share of car trips = 25% + 28% = 53% (0.53)\n    *   Average trip distance = 1 mile\n    *   VMT Index (0-3 mi) = 0.48 × 0.53 × 1 = 0.2544\n\n*   **For 3-5 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 22% (0.22)\n    *   Share of car trips = 38% + 43% = 81% (0.81)\n    *   Average trip distance = 4 miles\n    *   VMT Index (3-5 mi) = 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = 0.7128\n\n*   **For 5-10 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 14% (0.14)\n    *   Share of car trips = 40% + 45% = 85% (0.85)\n    *   Average trip distance = 7.5 miles\n    *   VMT Index (5-10 mi) = 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = 0.8925\n\n*   **For 10+ miles distance:**\n    *   Share of total trips = 16% (0.16)\n    *   Share of car trips = 42% + 47% = 89% (0.89)\n    *   Average trip distance = 20 miles\n    *   VMT Index (10+ mi) = 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = 2.8480\n\n*   **Total Baseline VMT Index:**\n    *   0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Proposed Car VMT Index (using Table 2 data).**\nWe repeat the calculation using the proposed mode share values.\n\n*   **For 0-3 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of car trips = 1% + 2% = 3% (0.03)\n    *   VMT Index (0-3 mi) = 0.48 × 0.03 × 1 = 0.0144\n\n*   **For 3-5 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of car trips = 8% + 19% = 27% (0.27)\n    *   VMT Index (3-5 mi) = 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = 0.2376\n\n*   **For 5-10 miles distance:**\n    *   Share of car trips = 14% + 27% = 41% (0.41)\n    *   VMT Index (5-10 mi) = 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = 0.4305\n\n*   **For 10+ miles distance:**\n    *   Share of car trips = 16% + 33% = 49% (0.49)\n    *   VMT Index (10+ mi) = 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = 1.5680\n\n*   **Total Proposed VMT Index:**\n    *   0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Percentage Reduction.**\nThe formula for percentage reduction is: `((Initial Value - Final Value) / Initial Value) × 100`.\n\n*   Initial Value (Baseline VMT Index) = 4.7077\n*   Final Value (Proposed VMT Index) = 2.2505\n*   Reduction Amount = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   Percentage Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100 ≈ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
