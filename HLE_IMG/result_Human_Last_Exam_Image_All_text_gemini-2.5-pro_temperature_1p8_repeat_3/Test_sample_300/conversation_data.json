    "Based on a step-by-step analysis of each artwork, considering the style, subject matter, signatures, and seals, here are the authors for each of the nine works, from left to right, top to bottom:\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Top-Left:** This painting depicts women from an ethnic minority group. The dynamic brushwork, vibrant portrayal of life, and the signature in the upper right corner are characteristic of **Huang Zhou (黄胄)**, a master known for his depictions of figures, especially from Xinjiang and other regions of China.\n2.  **Top-Middle:** This is an ink wash landscape characterized by abstract, linear forms representing buildings and nature. This style, which blends traditional Chinese aesthetics with Western modernism, is a hallmark of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**.\n3.  **Top-Right:** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy. The elegant yet strong script, along with the signature and seal which read \"启功\" (Qi Gong), identifies the author as **Qi Gong (启功)**, a renowned 20th-century calligrapher and painter.\n4.  **Middle-Left:** This calligraphy exhibits a unique, eccentric, and powerful style. This highly individualistic and expressive script is characteristic of the late Ming and early Qing dynasty artist **Bada Shanren (八大山人),** whose real name was Zhu Da (朱耷).\n5.  **Middle-Center:** This is a famous realist oil painting of a young woman in a white shirt. Titled \"Young Female Singer,\" it is a masterpiece of the Chinese Neoclassicism movement and was painted by **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)** in 1984.\n6.  **Middle-Right:** This painting of a stylized female figure with birds is done in a distinctive style that synthesizes Chinese ink techniques with Western modernist principles, particularly Fauvism and Expressionism. This style is the signature of **Lin Fengmian (林风眠)**.\n7.  **Bottom-Left:** This is a colorful painting of a rural courtyard with hanging gourds and laundry. The vibrant color palette, strong outlines, and focus on the beauty of folk life are trademarks of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**, showcasing his work in color in addition to his ink paintings.\n8.  **Bottom-Middle:** This landscape painting depicts a dramatic river gorge with a fleet of boats. The use of built-up layers of dark ink to create a sense of monumentality and weight, contrasted with light and mist, is a signature technique of **Li Keran (李可染)**, especially in his famous works of the Yangtze River or revolutionary sites.\n9.  **Bottom-Right:** This is an ink painting of a lobster. The mastery in capturing the creature's likeness and spirit with economical and skillful brushstrokes is the defining characteristic of **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**, who was celebrated for his paintings of smaller creatures like shrimp, crabs, and insects.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nFrom left to right, top to bottom, the authors are:\n1.  Huang Zhou\n2.  Wu Guanzhong\n3.  Qi Gong\n4.  Bada Shanren (Zhu Da)\n5.  Jin Shangyi\n6.  Lin Fengmian\n7.  Wu Guanzhong\n8.  Li Keran\n9.
