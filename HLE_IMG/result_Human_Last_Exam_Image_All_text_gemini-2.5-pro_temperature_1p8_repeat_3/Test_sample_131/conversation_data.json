    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the core structure of the molecule.**\n    The image displays a complex organic molecule with a polycyclic framework. It contains four fused rings, all of which are six-membered. The presence of two nitrogen atoms integrated into the ring system, a characteristic feature of alkaloids, is immediately apparent. Alkaloids are naturally occurring nitrogen-containing compounds, typically found in plants.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the functional groups.**\n    There are two key functional groups besides the alkane framework:\n    1.  **Amine:** There are two nitrogen atoms. One is a tertiary amine, part of the fusion between two rings. The other is part of an amide.\n    2.  **Amide (Lactam):** There is a carbonyl group (C=O) adjacent to a nitrogen atom within a ring. This specific type of cyclic amide is called a lactam. In this case, it's a six-membered lactam ring (a Î´-lactam).\n\n*   **Step 3: Classify the alkaloid type.**\n    The tetracyclic diamine skeleton is a hallmark of the quinolizidine alkaloids. This class of alkaloids is particularly common in plants of the *Lupinus* genus (lupins) and are thus often called lupin alkaloids. The basic skeleton, without the carbonyl group, is known as sparteine. The given compound is an oxidized derivative of a sparteine-type skeleton.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the specific compound by comparing it to known lupin alkaloids.**\n    Several common lupin alkaloids exist. By comparing the given structure to known ones, we can identify it:\n    *   **Sparteine:** Has the same tetracyclic core but lacks the carbonyl (C=O) group.\n    *   **Cytisine & Anagyrine:** Are also lupin alkaloids but feature an aromatic pyridone ring, which is different from the fully saturated ring system seen here.\n    *   **Matrine:** Is an isomer of the depicted compound. It has the same molecular formula (C15H24N2O) and a similar tetracyclic core, but the lactam carbonyl group is located in a different ring.\n    *   **Lupanine:** The structure of lupanine perfectly matches the provided image. It is a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid with a lactam functional group in the specific position shown. The stereochemistry indicated by the wedges and dashes in the drawing corresponds to the common natural isomer, (-)-lupanine.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the name.**\n    Based on the structural analysis and comparison with known natural products, the compound is identified as Lupanine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
