    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observations**\n*   **Instrumentation:** The score is written on a grand staff (treble and bass clefs connected by a brace), which is standard for piano music.\n*   **Time Signature:** The piece is in 4/4 time (common time).\n*   **Tempo:** The tempo is marked as quarter note = 80, which is a moderate tempo (`Andante` or `Moderato`).\n*   **Key Signature:** The initial key signature has no sharps or flats, suggesting C major or A minor. However, numerous accidentals (sharps, flats, naturals) appear throughout the piece, indicating frequent modulations or a highly chromatic language.\n*   **Dynamics:** There is a wide range of dynamics, starting at `p` (piano, soft), jumping to `f` (forte, loud), and including `mp` (mezzo-piano) and `mf` (mezzo-forte). This indicates a piece with significant dramatic contrast.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of Musical Content and Texture**\n*   **Measures 1-2:** The piece begins quietly in A minor. The left hand plays a rolled A minor chord, and the right hand has a simple, somewhat melancholic melody.\n*   **Measure 3:** There's a sudden shift in dynamic to `f` and a change in harmony to G-sharp minor, presented as loud, fast arpeggios. This sudden change in character is a major clue.\n*   **Measures 4-10:** This section establishes the main texture of the excerpt. It consists of continuous, fast-moving arpeggios.\n    *   **Right Hand:** Plays ascending eighth-note arpeggios.\n    *   **Left Hand:** Plays chords on the beat followed by sixteenth-note broken chords.\n    *   The harmony continues to modulate rapidly: C-sharp minor (m. 4), F-sharp minor (m. 5), then progressing through other keys.\n*   **Measure 11:** This measure features a very fast, upward-sweeping passage marked with a wavy line and \"gliss.\", which indicates a rapid, glissando-like run across the keyboard, leading into the next section.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis and Hypothesis**\n*   The combination of virtuosic, arpeggio-heavy piano writing, intense passion, dramatic dynamic shifts, and rich harmonies is highly characteristic of the Romantic era, particularly the work of Russian composers.\n*   The relentless, driving arpeggio figure that forms the core of this excerpt is extremely distinctive. This specific pattern, especially the progression starting with the C-sharp minor arpeggio in measure 4, is the most recognizable element.\n*   This figuration is the hallmark of the middle section (marked `Agitato`) of Sergei Rachmaninoff's famous **Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op. 3, No. 2**.\n\n**Step 4: Verification**\n*   Comparing the sheet music (especially from measure 4 onwards) with a standard score of Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor confirms the identity.\n*   The notes, rhythms, and harmonic progression (C#m, F#m, Em, etc.) in measures 4-10 are a direct match to the `Agitato` section of the prelude.\n*   The glissando-like run in measure 11 corresponds to the climactic chromatic scale run that Rachmaninoff writes before the thunderous return of the opening theme.\n*   While the quiet A minor opening (measures 1-2) is not part of the standard original version, the rest of the music is so uniquely and exactly from the Rachmaninoff prelude that this excerpt must be from that piece, perhaps in a slightly altered arrangement or edition.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the highly characteristic and virtuosic arpeggio passages, the harmonic progression, and the overall dramatic style, the piece is unmistakably the Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op. 3, No. 2, by Sergei Rachmaninoff.\n\n<<<Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op. 3, No. 2 by Sergei Rachmaninoff>>>"
