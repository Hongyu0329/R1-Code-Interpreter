    "**Step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak and determine Molecular Weight:**\n    *   The mass spectrum shows a cluster of peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) region: 260, 262, 264, 266. This cluster likely represents the molecular ion and its isotopologues.\n    *   The pattern of peaks separated by 2 mass units (M, M+2, M+4, M+6) is characteristic of a compound containing multiple chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br) atoms.\n    *   Chlorine has two main isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75.8%) and ³⁷Cl (~24.2%), in a ratio of approximately 3:1.\n    *   The observed intensities are I(260)=34.8%, I(262)=29.0%, I(264)=12.9%, I(266)=3.22%.\n    *   Let's compare this to the theoretical pattern for three chlorine atoms. A molecule with three Cl atoms would show four peaks (M, M+2, M+4, M+6) with an approximate intensity ratio of (3)³ : 3(3)²(1) : 3(3)(1)² : (1)³ = 27:27:9:1, or normalized, ~100:98:32:3.5.\n    *   The observed ratio I(260):I(262):I(264):I(266) is 34.8:29.0:12.9:3.22. While not a perfect match (often due to experimental conditions or overlapping fragments), this pattern strongly suggests the presence of three chlorine atoms. The peak at m/z 260 corresponds to the molecular ion containing only the ³⁵Cl isotope. So, the nominal molecular weight is 260 u.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Fragmentation Pattern to Determine the Structure:**\n    *   **Base Peak (m/z 225):** The most intense peak (base peak, I=100%) is at m/z 225. The difference between the molecular ion (260) and the base peak is 260 - 225 = 35 u. This corresponds to the loss of a chlorine atom (³⁵Cl). This fragment is [M - Cl]⁺.\n    *   **Isotope Pattern of the Base Peak:** The base peak at m/z 225 is accompanied by peaks at m/z 227 (I=66.7%) and m/z 229 (I=22.2%). The intensity ratio I(M+2)/I(M) = 66.7/100 ≈ 0.67. The theoretical ratio for a fragment with two chlorine atoms is 2 * (³⁷Cl/³⁵Cl) ≈ 2 * (0.242/0.758) ≈ 0.64. This is an excellent match, confirming that the fragment at m/z 225 contains two chlorine atoms. This supports the initial hypothesis that the parent molecule had three Cl atoms.\n    *   **Sequential Loss of Chlorine:** We can identify a fragmentation cascade involving the sequential loss of the three chlorine atoms:\n        *   [M]⁺ (m/z 260) → [M - Cl]⁺ (m/z 225) + Cl•\n        *   [M - Cl]⁺ (m/z 225) → [M - 2Cl]⁺ (m/z 190) + Cl•. (225 - 35 = 190). The peak at m/z 190 (I=48.4%) fits this loss. Its isotope peak at m/z 192 (I=24.5%) shows a ratio of 24.5/48.4 ≈ 0.51, which is reasonably consistent with the presence of one remaining Cl atom (theoretical ratio ~0.32; the deviation may be due to other contributing fragments).\n        *   [M - 2Cl]⁺ (m/z 190) → [M - 3Cl]⁺ (m/z 155) + Cl•. (190 - 35 = 155). A peak is observed at m/z 155 (I=16.1%). This fragment contains no more chlorine.\n\n3.  **Deduce the Molecular Formula and Propose a Structure:**\n    *   The fragment at m/z 155 represents the non-chlorinated part of the molecule, let's call it R. So the molecule has a structure like R-(Cl)₃, and the ion is [R]⁺.\n    *   The total molecular formula is (Formula of R)Cl₃ and its mass (with ³⁵Cl) is 260 u. The mass of the R moiety is 155 u.\n    *   To find the formula of R, we can use the Rule of 13, but the presence of oxygen is highly likely. Let's assume the presence of two oxygen atoms, which is common for esters. Mass of O₂ = 32 u. Mass of the C/H part = 155 - 32 = 123 u.\n    *   Applying the Rule of 13 to 123: 123 / 13 = 9 with a remainder of 6. So the C/H part is C₉H₉₊₆ = C₉H₁₅.\n    *   Thus, the R group is C₉H₁₅O₂. The full molecular formula is C₉H₁₅O₂Cl₃.\n    *   Let's verify the molecular weight: MW(C₉H₁₅O₂³⁵Cl₃) = 9*12 + 15*1 + 2*16 + 3*35 = 108 + 15 + 32 + 105 = 260 u. This matches perfectly.\n    *   The degrees of unsaturation (DBE) for C₉H₁₅O₂Cl₃ is DBE = C - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 + 1 = 9 - 15/2 - 3/2 + 1 = 9 - 18/2 + 1 = 1. A DBE of 1 suggests one ring or one double bond, which is consistent with a carbonyl group (C=O) in an ester.\n    *   A very plausible structure that fits C₉H₁₅O₂Cl₃ and the fragmentation is an ester of trichloroethanoic acid (CCl₃COOH) with heptanol (C₇H₁₅OH). The structure would be CCl₃COOC₇H₁₅. This molecule is **heptyl trichloroethanoate**.\n\n4.  **Confirm the Structure with other key fragments:**\n    *   The proposed structure is CCl₃-C(=O)O-C₇H₁₅.\n    *   A common fragmentation for esters is the cleavage of the C-C bond alpha to the carbonyl. This would involve the loss of the •CCl₃ radical.\n    *   M⁺ → [COOC₇H₁₅]⁺ + •CCl₃\n    *   The mass of the [COOC₇H₁₅]⁺ fragment is 12 + 32 + 7*12 + 15 = 143 u.\n    *   The spectrum shows a significant peak at **m/z 143** with an intensity of 27.8%. This provides strong evidence for the proposed heptyl trichloroethanoate structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the molecular weight, the isotopic pattern indicating three chlorine atoms, the sequential loss of these three Cl atoms, and the presence of the key fragment at m/z 143, the compound is identified as heptyl trichloroethanoate.\n\n**Systematic IUPAC Name:** The parent carboxylic acid is CCl₃COOH, which is trichloroethanoic acid. The alcohol is heptanol. The resulting ester is named by replacing the \"-oic acid\" with \"-oate\" and prefixing the name of the alkyl group from the alcohol.\n\n**Final Answer:** Heptyl trichloroethanoate\n\n>>>Heptyl trichloroethanoate"
