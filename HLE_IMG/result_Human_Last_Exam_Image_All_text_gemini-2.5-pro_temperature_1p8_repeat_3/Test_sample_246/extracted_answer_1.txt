Yes, there is clear evidence of insect activity. The prominent white, fuzzy sphere on the branch is an insect gall, likely a woolly oak gall created by a gall wasp. The insect responsible for this gall laid its egg inside the tissue of the oak branch. The gall is the plant's reaction to the presence of the egg/larva, forming a protective structure where the larva lives and feeds.
