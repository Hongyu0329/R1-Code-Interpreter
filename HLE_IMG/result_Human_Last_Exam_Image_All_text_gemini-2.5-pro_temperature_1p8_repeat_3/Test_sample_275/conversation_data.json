    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total number of splice species from the provided RT-PCR results.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Experimental Setup\nThe experiment uses Reverse Transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) to detect different messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts (splice species) from a viral genome.\n- **Figure A** shows the map of the genome with the location of genes (E1, E2, etc.) and the binding sites for the various primers (E1F1, E4R, etc.).\n- **Primers E1F2 and E1F3** are special because they are \"splice-junction primers\". They only bind and allow PCR amplification if a specific splicing event has already occurred (connecting nucleotide 929 to 3465 for E1F2, and 929 to 3506 for E1F3).\n- Each panel from **B to I** shows the result of a PCR reaction using a specific pair of primers. A band on the gel represents a PCR product of a certain size. Multiple bands in a single lane for a given primer pair indicate different splice variants exist between those primer binding sites.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Gel Panel to Identify Unique Splice Species\n\nWe will examine each panel and count the number of unique splice species revealed. A species is considered unique if it's detected by a distinct primer pair, has a unique size, or involves a specific splice junction not seen before.\n\n1.  **Panel B (E1F1/E4R):** This PCR amplifies a region within the early genes.\n    - It shows two distinct bands (band 1: 190 bp; band 2: 159 bp).\n    - **Conclusion:** This reveals the existence of **2** different splice species. These are early transcripts.\n\n2.  **Panel C (E1F1/E5R):** This PCR also targets the early region, extending slightly further than in B.\n    - It shows two bands (584 bp, 553 bp) consistent with the two species from panel B.\n    - **Conclusion:** This confirms the 2 species found in B but does not reveal any new ones. (Current Total: 2)\n\n3.  **Panel D (E1F2/E5R):** This PCR uses the specific splice-junction primer E1F2 (929^3465).\n    - It shows a single band (551 bp).\n    - **Conclusion:** The use of this specific primer positively identifies a transcript containing the 929^3465 splice. This is a different splicing pattern from those in panel B. This adds **1** new species. (Current Total: 2 + 1 = 3)\n\n4.  **Panel E (E1F1/L2R):** This PCR amplifies a region from an early gene (E1) to a late gene (L2).\n    - It shows a single band (1,005 bp).\n    - **Conclusion:** This identifies a late transcript with a specific splice pattern between E1 and L2. Since there is only one band (unlike the two seen with E1F1 in the early region), this represents a distinct species. This adds **1** new species. (Current Total: 3 + 1 = 4)\n\n5.  **Panel F (E1F2/L2R):** This PCR uses the splice-junction primer E1F2 and a late reverse primer L2R.\n    - It shows a single band (972 bp).\n    - **Conclusion:** This confirms that the species with the 929^3465 splice (first seen in D) also exists as a late transcript that extends to the L2 region. This late version is a distinct mature mRNA from its early counterpart. This adds **1** new species. (Current Total: 4 + 1 = 5)\n\n6.  **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** This PCR uses the other splice-junction primer E1F3 (929^3506).\n    - It shows two distinct bands (1,003 bp, 931 bp).\n    - **Conclusion:** This identifies transcripts containing the 929^3506 splice. The presence of two bands indicates there are two different ways the transcript is further processed downstream. This adds **2** new species. (Current Total: 5 + 2 = 7)\n\n7.  **Panel I (E1F1/L1R):** This PCR, run for more cycles for higher sensitivity, amplifies the region from E1 to L1. It reveals the greatest diversity.\n    - It shows four distinct bands (450 bp, 419 bp, 378 bp, and 187 bp).\n    - **Conclusion:** Each of these bands represents a unique splicing pathway between E1 and L1. These are different from the species identified with primers targeting L2 (panels E, F, G) because the product sizes and the reverse primer location are different. This adds **4** new species. (Current Total: 7 + 4 = 11)\n\n### Final Tally\nBy summing the unique species identified from each key experiment, we get:\n- From Panel B: 2\n- From Panel D: 1\n- From Panel E: 1\n- From Panel F: 1\n- From Panel G: 2\n- From Panel I: 4\n\nTotal Splice Species = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 11.\n\nBased on the provided RT-PCR results, we can identify 11 distinct splice species.\n\n<<<11>>>"
