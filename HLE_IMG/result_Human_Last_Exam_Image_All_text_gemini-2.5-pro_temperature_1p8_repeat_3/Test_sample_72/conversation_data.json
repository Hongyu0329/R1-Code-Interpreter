    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the overall transformation.**\n    The reaction starts with hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆) and cyclobutene (C₄H₄). The product is a tricyclic molecule, C₁₀H₄F₆, formed under photochemical conditions (indicated by *hv*). The final product consists of three fused four-membered rings in a linear fashion, with one double bond remaining. A direct reaction between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene to form this specific product in one step is highly unlikely and doesn't fit standard pericyclic reaction patterns. The question states that *two* photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur, which implies a two-step mechanism involving an intermediate.\n\n*   **Step 2: Propose the first pericyclic reaction.**\n    Benzene and its derivatives are known to undergo photochemical valence isomerization to form other isomers like Dewar benzene, prismane, or benzvalene. A plausible first step is the conversion of hexafluorobenzene to its valence isomer, perfluoro-Dewar benzene (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene).\n    *   **Reactant:** Hexafluorobenzene, which has a cyclic, conjugated 6π-electron system.\n    *   **Intermediate:** Perfluoro-Dewar benzene, which has two isolated double bonds in a bicyclic structure composed of two fused four-membered rings.\n    *   **Reaction type:** This transformation involves the closure of a ring by forming a new sigma bond across the 1,4-positions of the benzene ring, using electrons from the π-system. This is classified as an **electrocyclic reaction**. Since it involves a 6π-electron system, it is a **6π electrocyclization**. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for pericyclic reactions, a 6π (4n+2, with n=1) electrocyclization is allowed under photochemical conditions.\n\n*   **Step 3: Propose the second pericyclic reaction.**\n    The intermediate, perfluoro-Dewar benzene, now reacts with cyclobutene.\n    *   **Reactants for this step:** Perfluoro-Dewar benzene, which has 2π-electron systems (its double bonds), and cyclobutene, which also has a 2π-electron system (its double bond).\n    *   **Transformation:** One of the double bonds of perfluoro-Dewar benzene reacts with the double bond of cyclobutene to form a new four-membered ring. This fuses the cyclobutene molecule to the Dewar benzene structure, resulting in the final product which is a linear fusion of three cyclobutane/cyclobutene rings.\n    *   **Reaction type:** This reaction, where two π-electron systems combine to form a cyclic molecule by creating two new sigma bonds, is a **cycloaddition reaction**. Specifically, since it involves a 2π system reacting with another 2π system, it is a **[2+2] cycloaddition**. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [2+2] cycloaddition involves 4π electrons in total (4n, with n=1) and is allowed under photochemical conditions.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclusion.**\n    The overall transformation involves two sequential photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions:\n    1.  A **6π electrocyclization** of hexafluorobenzene to form perfluoro-Dewar benzene.\n    2.  A **[2+2] cycloaddition** between perfluoro-Dewar benzene and cyclobutene to form the final tricyclic product.\n\n<<<A 6π electrocyclization and a [2+2] cycloaddition.>>>"
