    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the substituents at the labeled positions.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reaction Type and Mechanism**\nThe reaction shows a complex alcohol (a pentacyclic triterpenoid) reacting with catalytic hydrochloric acid (HCl) at high temperature (110 °C) to yield a rearranged alkene and water. This is an acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction that proceeds through a carbocation intermediate. The mention of \"a number of [1,2] shifts\" and the complex nature of the molecule strongly indicate a Wagner-Meerwein type backbone rearrangement, which is common for terpenes and steroids under acidic conditions. The driving force for this extensive rearrangement is the relief of steric strain present in the initial ring system.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Starting Material and Key Substituents**\nThe starting material is a derivative of the friedelane skeleton, likely friedelan-3β-ol. For the backbone rearrangement, we need to identify the key substituents (either H or CH3) on the carbons of the fused ring system backbone that will participate in the shifts. Based on the standard structure of friedelane:\n*   At C4: Two methyl (CH3) groups.\n*   At C8: A hydrogen (H) atom.\n*   At C9: A hydrogen (H) atom (in this simplified representation, though it is a methyl in friedelane itself, the subsequent shift is of this group, so we will follow the logical cascade). More accurately, the migration sequence is well-established, so we rely on that. Let's assume standard friedelane shifts. The group at C9 that migrates is a hydrogen.\n*   At C10: A methyl (CH3) group.\n*   At C13: A hydrogen (H) atom.\n*   At C14: A methyl (CH3) group.\n\n**Step 3: Trace the Cascade of [1,2] Shifts (Backbone Rearrangement)**\nThe rearrangement is initiated by the formation of a carbocation. The alcohol at C3 is protonated and leaves as water, forming a carbocation at C3. This cation rapidly rearranges through intermediates to form a cation at C5, which triggers the main cascade. The shifts proceed in a zipper-like fashion, with each group shifting into the adjacent carbocation center.\n\nLet's track the movement of the substituents:\n1.  **Shift 1:** The CH3 group at C10 migrates to C5. The positive charge is now at C10.\n2.  **Shift 2:** The H atom at C9 migrates to C10. The positive charge is now at C9.\n3.  **Shift 3:** The H atom at C8 migrates to C9. The positive charge is now at C8.\n4.  **Shift 4:** The CH3 group at C14 migrates to C8. The positive charge is now at C14.\n5.  **Shift 5:** The H atom at C13 migrates to C14. The positive charge is now at C13.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Substituents at the Labeled Positions in the Product**\nNow, let's determine what substituent (H or CH3) ends up at each labeled position after the rearrangement.\n\n*   **Position 1:** This label points to one of the methyl groups at C4. The rearrangement cascade starts at C5/C10 and propagates away from ring A. The substituents at C4 are not involved in the shifts. Therefore, position 1 is still a methyl group.\n    *   **1 = CH3**\n\n*   **Position 2:** This label points to the C10 position. In the rearrangement, the original CH3 group at C10 moved to C5. The vacant C10 was then filled by the H atom migrating from C9. Therefore, position 2 is now a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **2 = H**\n\n*   **Position 3:** This label points to the C8 position. The original H atom at C8 moved to C9. The vacant C8 was then filled by the CH3 group migrating from C14. Therefore, position 3 is now a methyl group.\n    *   **3 = CH3**\n\n*   **Position 4:** This label points to the C14 position. The original CH3 group at C14 moved to C8. The vacant C14 was then filled by the H atom migrating from C13. Therefore, position 4 is now a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **4 = H**\n\n*   **Position 5:** This label points to the C13 position. The original H atom at C13 migrated to C14, leaving C13 as a carbocation. This carbocation is the endpoint of the cascade of shifts. To form the final stable alkene product (likely olean-12-ene, with a C12=C13 double bond, or olean-13(18)-ene), a proton is eliminated from an adjacent carbon. In either common product, the C13 carbon becomes sp2 hybridized and part of a double bond, meaning it wouldn't have a substituent in the way depicted. However, the question requires us to identify the substituent. This indicates we should consider the group that was at this position before the final elimination step. The group that migrated away from C13 was a hydrogen atom. Thus, it's most logical to conclude the question refers to this original identity.\n    *   **5 = H**\n\n**Summary of Substituents:**\n*   1 = CH3\n*   2 = H\n*   3 = CH3\n*   4 = H\n*   5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = H, 5 = H>>>"
