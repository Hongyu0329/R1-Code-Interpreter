The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is caused by the conformational rigidity of the m√ºnchnone intermediate derived from N-acetyl-proline. The fused pyrrolidine ring locks the intermediate into a specific three-dimensional shape, preventing the substituent-scrambling equilibrium observed in the flexible acyclic system of Reaction 2. This fixed geometry creates a significant steric and electronic bias, forcing the incoming methyl propiolate to add in a single, highly preferred orientation to form Product B. The results from Reactions 1 and 2 establish the principle that in the absence of such conformational constraints, this selectivity is lost due to rapid equilibration of the intermediate.
