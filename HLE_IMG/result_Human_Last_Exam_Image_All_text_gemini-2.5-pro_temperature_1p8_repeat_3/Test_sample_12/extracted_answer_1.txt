No. The framework describes salience as a property of the diagnostic stimuli, determined by four factors: Access, Prominence, Simplicity, and Clarity. Both the text and the diagram detail these factors as characteristics of the simulation's design (e.g., information being physically present, use of audiovisual cues, complexity of the data). The framework does not include the learner's individual differences as a variable that defines or modifies salience.
