    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Venue in the Image**: The first step is to identify the location shown in the photograph. The image displays a building with unique architectural features, including distinctive red brickwork in a herringbone pattern, a tan facade with a decorative quatrefoil relief, and an upper-level balcony with a white X-patterned railing. A large semi-truck, typical of a touring production, is parked in front, suggesting it's a performance venue.\n\n2.  **Confirm the Venue's Identity**: Using a reverse image search or searching for theaters with these specific architectural details, the building is identified as the **Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox** located in Spokane, Washington. A comparison with online images of the theater confirms the match.\n\n3.  **Determine the Performance Schedule**: The question asks for the musical artist who performed at this specific venue on a particular date: October 12, 2023.\n\n4.  **Search for the Event**: The next step is to search for the event calendar of the Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox for October 2023. Public event listings from the theater's official website, ticketing sites (like Ticketmaster), or event databases (like Bandsintown) can provide this historical information.\n\n5.  **Find the Artist for the Specific Date**: A search of the venue's schedule confirms that on Thursday, October 12, 2023, the musical artist **LeAnn Rimes** performed there as part of her \"the story... so far tour\".\n\n6.  **Final Answer Formulation**: By combining the identification of the venue with the historical event schedule for the given date, we can conclude who performed. The image was taken at the Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox, and on October 12, 2023, LeAnn Rimes was the scheduled musical performer.\n\n<<<LeAnn Rimes>>>"
