    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to answer the question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the question:** The question asks for the primary, easily visible (\"at a glance\") difference in the sporophyte (the spore-producing structure) between two moss species: *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. The sporophyte in mosses typically consists of a capsule (which contains the spores) and a seta (the stalk that supports the capsule).\n\n2.  **Examine the provided image:** The image shows moss with numerous small, brown, cup-like structures. These are the capsules of the moss sporophytes after they have opened to release their spores. The capsules are nestled down within the leafy parts of the moss, appearing \"immersed.\" This indicates they are on a very short, non-protruding stalk (seta). This morphology is characteristic of *Grimmia montana*.\n\n3.  **Analyze the characteristics of *Grimmia montana*:**\n    *   **Seta:** The seta is very short and, critically, it is **straight**.\n    *   **Capsule Position:** Because the seta is short and straight, the capsule is \"immersed\" among the upper leaves of the plant. It sits upright within the tuft of leaves.\n\n4.  **Analyze the characteristics of *Grimmia curviseta*:**\n    *   **The name itself is a major clue:** *Curviseta* is derived from Latin, where *curvus* means \"curved\" and *seta* refers to the stalk. Therefore, the name literally means \"curved stalk.\"\n    *   **Seta:** The defining characteristic of *Grimmia curviseta*'s sporophyte is its seta, which is distinctly **curved or arcuate** (bent like a bow). It's also longer than the seta of *G. montana*.\n    *   **Capsule Position:** The curved seta causes the capsule to be exserted (held out from the leaves) and to hang downwards or nod (a position called cernuous or pendulous).\n\n5.  **Identify the main difference:**\n    *   The most significant and easily observable difference between the two species' sporophytes is the **seta**.\n    *   *Grimmia montana* has a **short, straight seta**, resulting in an immersed, upright capsule.\n    *   *Grimmia curviseta* has a longer, **distinctly curved (arcuate) seta**, resulting in an exserted, nodding, or hanging capsule.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Focus on the Sporophyte:** The question specifically asks about the sporophyte, not the gametophyte (the leafy green part). While there are gametophytic differences, the seta is the most dramatic sporophytic distinguishing feature.\n*   **\"At a glance\" feature:** The curvature of the seta is a macroscopic feature that is immediately obvious when comparing the two species side-by-side with mature sporophytes. You don't need a microscope to see this difference.\n*   **Use the Latin Name:** Often in botany, the specific epithet (the second part of the scientific name) describes a key feature of the species, as is the case with *curviseta*.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that helps distinguish them at a glance is the shape of the seta. *Grimmia montana* has a short, straight seta, causing the capsule to be immersed and erect. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctive, longer, curved (arcuate) seta, which causes the capsule to be exserted and to nod or hang down.\n\n<<<The main distinguishing feature is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, resulting in an upright capsule that is immersed among the leaves. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is distinctly longer and curved (arcuate), causing the capsule to be exserted and hang downwards or nod.>>>"
