The main distinguishing feature is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, resulting in an upright capsule that is immersed among the leaves. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is distinctly longer and curved (arcuate), causing the capsule to be exserted and hang downwards or nod.
