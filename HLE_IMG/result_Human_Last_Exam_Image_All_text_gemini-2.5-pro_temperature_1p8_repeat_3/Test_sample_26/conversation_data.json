    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Measure and Key:**\n    *   First, we locate measure 30 in the provided sheet music. It is the third measure on the second system of the page, and it is helpfully circled in the image.\n    *   The overall key of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata's first movement is C minor. The key signature at the beginning of the *Allegro di molto e con brio* section is C minor (three flats: B♭, E♭, A♭).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Harmonic Context:**\n    *   To understand the function of the chord in measure 30, we must look at the surrounding measures.\n    *   Measure 29 (the measure just before) contains a G7 chord (notes: G, B♮, D, F). In the key of C minor, this is the dominant seventh chord (V⁷).\n    *   Measure 31 (the measure just after) begins with a C minor chord (notes: C, E♭, G). This is the tonic chord (i).\n    *   Therefore, measure 30 is part of the harmonic progression from the dominant (V) to the tonic (i). It serves to prolong and intensify the dominant function before the resolution.\n\n3.  **Identify the Notes in Measure 30:**\n    *   The harmony changes within measure 30. We will analyze the harmony on the downbeat (beat 1), which is the most structurally important part of the measure.\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** On beat 1, the left hand plays an F♯ octave in the bass, followed by the notes A and C. These three notes together—F♯, A, and C—form an **F♯ diminished triad**.\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** On beat 1, the right hand plays a melody note B, followed by an arpeggiated figure (G♯, E♮, C). These notes are best understood as melodic embellishments (non-chord tones) over the harmony established by the left hand.\n\n4.  **Determine the Chord and its Function:**\n    *   The clear and stable harmony on the downbeat of measure 30 is the F♯ diminished triad (F♯-A-C) established by the left hand with F♯ in the bass.\n    *   Now, we must determine the function of this chord within the key of C minor. The chord that follows immediately on beat 3 of the same measure is built on G in the bass (G-B♭-D), which is the dominant (V). The F♯ diminished chord is leading into this G chord.\n    *   The note F♯ is the leading tone to the note G.\n    *   The chord G is the dominant (V) of our home key, C minor.\n    *   Therefore, the F♯ diminished chord is functioning as the **leading-tone chord of the dominant**. Such a chord is called a secondary chord or an applied chord.\n\n5.  **Write the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   The Roman numeral for a leading-tone triad is **vii**.\n    *   Since it is a diminished triad, we add a degree symbol: **vii°**.\n    *   Because it is an applied chord that functions as the leading-tone chord *of the dominant (V)*, we use a slash to indicate this relationship: **vii°/V**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Read both clefs:** The harmony is a combination of what both hands are playing. In this case, the left hand clearly outlines the fundamental harmony.\n*   **Recognize non-chord tones:** The right hand is very ornate. It's crucial to distinguish the core harmony from melodic embellishments like passing tones, neighbor tones, or appoggiaturas.\n*   **Analyze harmonically, not just melodically:** Don't just list all the notes. Identify the chord that they form and, more importantly, its function within the key.\n*   **Understand secondary/applied chords:** This progression relies on a secondary leading-tone chord, a common feature in Classical and Romantic music used to intensify the pull towards a subsequent chord (in this case, the dominant).\n*   **Note the change of harmony within the measure:** The harmony on beats 1-2 (vii°/V) is different from the harmony on beats 3-4 (V). The question asks for \"the\" numeral for the measure, which conventionally refers to the primary harmony established on the downbeat.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chord at the beginning of measure 30 is an F♯ diminished triad, which functions as the leading-tone chord to the dominant (G). The correct Roman numeral is vii°/V.\n\n<<<vii°/V>>>"
