    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and its molecular formula.**\nThe starting material is a bicyclic compound containing a lactam (cyclic amide) functional group. Let's determine its molecular formula by counting the atoms of each element.\n*   **Carbon (C):** The bicyclic framework (2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton) has 6 carbons. There is one carbon in the trifluoromethyl (CF3) group. The p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group (CH2-C6H4-OCH3) has 1 (benzyl) + 6 (phenyl ring) + 1 (methoxy) = 8 carbons.\n    Total Carbons = 6 + 1 + 8 = 15.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** Let's count the hydrogens on the bicyclic framework: 2 on the CH2 bridge (C7), 1 at each bridgehead (C1, C4), and 1 on the double bond (C5). Total = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 hydrogens. The PMB group has 2 on the benzyl CH2, 4 on the benzene ring, and 3 on the methoxy group. Total = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9 hydrogens.\n    Total Hydrogens = 5 + 9 = 14.\n*   **Fluorine (F):** There are 3 fluorine atoms in the CF3 group.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** There is one nitrogen atom in the lactam ring.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** There is one oxygen atom in the carbonyl group of the lactam and one in the methoxy group of the PMB protecting group. Total = 2 oxygens.\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction to find the structure and formula of Intermediate 1.**\n*   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Reaction:** CAN is a strong oxidizing agent commonly used for the oxidative cleavage of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers and amines. In this case, it removes the PMB protecting group from the nitrogen atom. The nitrogen atom becomes part of a secondary amine group (-NH-).\n*   **Change in Formula:** A PMB group (C8H9O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom (H) is added to the nitrogen.\n    *   Change in C: -8\n    *   Change in H: -9 + 1 = -8\n    *   Change in O: -1\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 1:**\n    *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   H: 14 - 8 = 6\n    *   F: 3 (no change)\n    *   N: 1 (no change)\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n    The molecular formula of Intermediate 1 is **C7H6F3NO**. The structure is a 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction to find the structure and formula of Intermediate 2.**\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 in MeOH.\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon reduces carbon-carbon double and triple bonds. In Intermediate 1, the C=C double bond in the bicyclic ring will be reduced to a C-C single bond.\n*   **Change in Formula:** One molecule of hydrogen (H2) is added across the double bond.\n    *   Change in H: +2\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 2:**\n    *   C: 7 (no change)\n    *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n    *   F: 3 (no change)\n    *   N: 1 (no change)\n    *   O: 1 (no change)\n    The molecular formula of Intermediate 2 is **C7H8F3NO**. The structure is a saturated 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third reaction to find the structure and formula of the final Product.**\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n*   **Reaction:** These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide. The lactam ring is cleaved by the addition of a water molecule (H2O) across the amide bond (C-N bond). This opens the bicyclic structure to form a substituted cyclopentane derivative containing a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH2). Under the acidic conditions, the amino group will be protonated to -NH3+.\n*   **Change in Formula:** One molecule of water (H2O) is added to the structure of Intermediate 2.\n    *   Change in H: +2\n    *   Change in O: +1\n*   **Formula of the Product:** We report the formula for the neutral molecule.\n    *   C: 7 (no change)\n    *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   F: 3 (no change)\n    *   N: 1 (no change)\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n    The molecular formula of the final product is **C7H10F3NO2**. The product is a substituted cyclopentane amino acid, specifically 4-amino-3-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n*   Start: C15H14F3NO2\n*   Step 1 (CAN): - C8H8O --> C7H6F3NO (Intermediate 1)\n*   Step 2 (H2/Pd/C): + H2 --> C7H8F3NO (Intermediate 2)\n*   Step 3 (HCl/H2O): + H2O --> C7H10F3NO2 (Product)\n\nThe analysis is consistent.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
