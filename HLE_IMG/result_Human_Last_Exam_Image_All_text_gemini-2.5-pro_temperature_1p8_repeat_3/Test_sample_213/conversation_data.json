    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual information on the sheet music.**\n    The image provided is a full orchestral score. We can identify several key features from the score itself.\n\n*   **Step 2: Examine the instrumentation.**\n    On the left side of the score, the instruments are listed in German:\n    *   `2 gr. Fl.` (2 große Flöten - 2 Flutes)\n    *   `I. Hob.` (1. Oboe - 1st Oboe)\n    *   `engl. Horn` (English Horn)\n    *   `I. Fag.` (1. Fagott - 1st Bassoon)\n    *   `I. Viol.` (1. Violine - 1st Violins, divided into desks: `1. Pult`, `2. Pult`, `die übrigen` - the rest)\n    *   `II. Viol.` (2. Violine - 2nd Violins)\n    *   `Solo Br.` (Solo Bratsche - Solo Viola)\n    *   `Celli` (Cellos)\n    The orchestration is large and typical of late Romantic or early 20th-century works. The use of German instrument names points to a German or Austrian composer.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the musical style and performance directions.**\n    *   The harmony is rich and highly chromatic, a hallmark of composers like Richard Strauss or late Wagner.\n    *   There are numerous detailed dynamic markings (`p`, `pp`, `dim.`, `mf`) and articulation markings (`gliss.` for glissando).\n    *   There are specific instructions in German, such as `mit Dämpfer` (with mute) for the violas and cellos, and `(die übrigen)` meaning \"the rest\" of the string section.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the most crucial clue in the score.**\n    Above the first violin staff, there is the marking `1 (Vorhang)`. \"Vorhang\" is the German word for \"curtain\". This, combined with the information in the question that this music opens the second act, tells us we are looking at the very beginning of Act II of an opera, right as the curtain rises.\n\n*   **Step 5: Synthesize the clues to identify the opera.**\n    We are looking for an opera by a German-speaking composer from the late-Romantic/early 20th century. The music for the opening of the second act must match this score. The bustling, energetic, and anticipatory character of the music, with its swirling figures in the strings and woodwinds, is highly characteristic. This specific musical passage is famously the orchestral prelude to Act II of Richard Strauss's opera *Der Rosenkavalier* (The Knight of the Rose). This act opens in the von Faninal's palace, with the whole household in a state of high excitement preparing for the arrival of the Rosenkavalier. The music perfectly captures this chaotic and expectant atmosphere as the curtain rises.\n\n<<<Der Rosenkavalier>>>"
