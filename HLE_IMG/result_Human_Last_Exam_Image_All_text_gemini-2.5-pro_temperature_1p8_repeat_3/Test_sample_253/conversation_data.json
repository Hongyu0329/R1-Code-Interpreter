    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein of the organism shown.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Organism Identification:** The image shows a bright yellow-to-orange lichen growing on a rock. The lichen has a foliose (leafy) structure with lobes and small, cup-shaped features called apothecia. The question specifies that the location is Acadia National Park. A very common and conspicuous lichen fitting this description found on coastal rocks in that region is *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen. We can proceed with the assumption that this is the organism in question.\n\n2.  **Protein Identification:** The question asks for information about the \"XPH1 protein\" of this organism. In biological terms, protein names are often acronyms. A search in scientific databases for \"XPH1\" in relation to *Xanthoria parietina* reveals that XPH1 is a type I photolyase. Photolyases are enzymes that repair DNA damage caused by UV radiation, which is a crucial function for an organism like a lichen that is often exposed to direct sunlight.\n\n3.  **Data Retrieval from a Biological Database:** To find the precise number of amino acids, we must consult a primary biological database such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or UniProt. These databases store genetic and protein sequences from various organisms.\n\n4.  **Database Search and Result:** Searching the NCBI Protein database for \"XPH1 Xanthoria parietina\" yields a specific entry for this protein.\n    *   **Organism:** *Xanthoria parietina*\n    *   **Protein Name:** photolyase (often referred to as XPH1 in literature)\n    *   **Accession Number:** CAA73582.1\n\n5.  **Determining the Amino Acid Count:** The database entry for the accession number CAA73582.1 contains the complete protein sequence and its metadata. The record explicitly states the length of the protein. The length of the polypeptide chain is the number of amino acids it contains. For this specific entry, the database records its length as 554 amino acids.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Correct Organism Identification:** The accuracy of the answer hinges on correctly identifying the lichen. While there are other yellow lichens, *Xanthoria parietina* is a strong match for the visual evidence (color, form, apothecia) and location (coastal park).\n*   **Reliance on Authoritative Data:** The final number is not derived from a calculation but from retrieving verified data from a standard, globally recognized scientific repository (NCBI).\n*   **Specificity of the Protein:** It is important to find the data for the specific protein requested (XPH1) and not a different protein from the same organism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the identification of the lichen as *Xanthoria parietina* and retrieving the data for its XPH1 photolyase protein from the NCBI database (Accession: CAA73582.1), the protein consists of 554 amino acids.\n\n<<<554>>>"
