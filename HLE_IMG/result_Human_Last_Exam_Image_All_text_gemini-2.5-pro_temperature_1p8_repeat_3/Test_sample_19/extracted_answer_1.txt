1. The music modulates to the key of **E major**.

2.  The original key of the piece is C-sharp minor. E major is the **relative major** of C-sharp minor (the chord built on the mediant, or third scale degree, III). This is an extremely common modulation as both keys share the same key signature and are considered very closely related.

3.  The chord on the first beat of measure 11 is a B minor triad. It functions as the subdominant minor (v) of the new key, E major. Since E major is the mediant (III) of the original key, the complete Roman numeral analysis is **v/III**.
