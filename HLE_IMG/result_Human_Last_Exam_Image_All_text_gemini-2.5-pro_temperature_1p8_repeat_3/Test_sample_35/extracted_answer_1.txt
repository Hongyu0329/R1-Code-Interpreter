The S100B protein exhibits a strong affinity for the V-domain of the RAGE receptor. It could be used as a prognostic marker because its levels directly correlate with the activation of pathways leading to neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration, thereby providing predictive information about the severity and future course of the neurological disorder.
