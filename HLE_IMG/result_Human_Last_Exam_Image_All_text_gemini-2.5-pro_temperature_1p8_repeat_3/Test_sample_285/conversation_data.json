    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks to identify which of the four figures (A, B, C, D) shows a triangulation that violates the empty circle property of Delaunay triangulations.\n\n2.  **Define Delaunay Triangulation and the Empty Circle Property:**\n    *   A **triangulation** of a set of points is a way of connecting the points with non-crossing edges to form triangles that cover the convex hull of the points. A key rule is that edges are not allowed to intersect each other, except at the vertices.\n    *   The **Delaunay triangulation** is a specific type of triangulation with a special property.\n    *   This property is the **empty circle property**: For every triangle in the triangulation, its circumcircle (the unique circle passing through the three vertices of the triangle) must not contain any other point from the original set in its interior.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Figure:**\n\n    *   **Figure A:** This is a valid triangulation as it consists of non-overlapping triangles. The triangles are relatively \"fat\", meaning their angles are not extremely small or large. While it's hard to verify with perfect accuracy by eye alone, there are no obvious, flagrant violations like very long, thin \"sliver\" triangles. The triangulation appears to be a plausible Delaunay triangulation or close to it.\n\n    *   **Figure B:** This is also a valid triangulation with non-crossing edges. Visually, this triangulation appears even more \"regular\" or \"well-behaved\" than A. The triangles are all quite \"fat\", and the edges seem to connect points that are near each other. This is the most likely candidate to be the correct Delaunay triangulation for the given point set.\n\n    *   **Figure C:** This is a valid triangulation with non-crossing edges. However, it contains several very long and thin triangles, often called \"sliver\" or \"skinny\" triangles. For example, look at the triangle on the far right formed by the top vertex, the upper-right vertex, and the lower-right vertex. The angle at the upper-right vertex is very obtuse (close to 180°), while the other two angles are very acute (close to 0°). The circumcircle of such a skinny triangle is always very large. It is visually evident that the circumcircle of this triangle would be so large that it would contain other points from the set (for instance, the central interior point). The presence of any point inside the circumcircle of a triangle is a direct violation of the empty circle property. Therefore, triangulation C violates the property.\n\n    *   **Figure D:** This figure shows a collection of points connected by lines. However, several lines cross each other in their interior (e.g., the diagonal from the top vertex to the bottom-right vertex crosses a line connecting two other interior points). A graph with crossing edges is not a valid planar graph and therefore cannot be a **triangulation**. Since being a valid triangulation is a prerequisite for being a Delaunay triangulation, figure D does not represent a Delaunay triangulation. It fails at a more fundamental level than the empty circle property. A non-triangulation cannot satisfy the properties of a specific type of triangulation.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings and Formulate the Answer:**\n    *   Figure C is a valid triangulation, but it directly violates the empty circle property due to the presence of sliver triangles.\n    *   Figure D is not a valid triangulation to begin with, so it cannot be a Delaunay triangulation. It violates the definition of a triangulation.\n    *   The question asks which \"triangulations\" violate the property. Both C and D represent configurations that are not Delaunay triangulations, for different reasons. C fails the empty circle test. D fails the definition of a triangulation itself. Both are valid answers to \"which of these are not Delaunay triangulations?\". Since the question allows for multiple answers (e.g., format \"A,B.\"), both should be included.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion:** Both C and D are not Delaunay triangulations. C is a triangulation that violates the empty circle property. D is not a valid triangulation at all. Therefore, both C and D should be listed as violating the properties required for a Delaunay triangulation.\n\nC,D.\n<<<C,D>>>"
