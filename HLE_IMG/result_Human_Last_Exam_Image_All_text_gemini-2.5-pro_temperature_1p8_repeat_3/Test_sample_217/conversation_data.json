    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the meaning of the cuneiform sign.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Examine the Image:** The image shows an ancient script sign. This style is not the later, abstract wedge-based cuneiform but an earlier, more pictographic form, consistent with the question's mention of the \"third-millennium form.\" The sign clearly resembles a structure: it has a rectangular base with internal lines, suggesting walls or construction, and a triangular top, like a roof.\n\n2.  **Identify the Sign:** This pictograph is the archaic form of the Sumerian cuneiform sign **É**. Over time, this drawing was simplified and stylized into the more familiar wedge-shaped characters, but in its early form, its pictorial origin as a house or building is evident.\n\n3.  **Determine the Meaning:** The Sumerian logogram **É** has the primary meaning of \"house.\" By extension, it could also mean \"household\" (the family and property associated with the house) or \"temple\" (the house of a god). The fundamental concept is a dwelling or a significant building.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A. Tool:** Incorrect. Signs for tools would be pictographs of items like plows or axes.\n    *   **B. Guard:** Incorrect. This does not visually represent a person guarding something.\n    *   **C. Bread:** Incorrect. The sign for bread (NINDA) looks like a ration bowl or a loaf of bread.\n    *   **D. Home:** Correct. This is the most accurate translation among the choices for the sign **É**, which means \"house\" or \"dwelling.\"\n    *   **E. Deity:** Incorrect. The determinative sign for a deity (DINGIR) is a star symbol (*).\n    *   **F. Beard:** Incorrect. The sign for a beard (SU₆) is a pictograph of the lower part of a face with a beard.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Evolution of Cuneiform:** It is crucial to recognize that cuneiform signs changed significantly over thousands of years. The sign in the question is an early, pictographic form, which makes its meaning easier to guess visually than its later, more abstract forms.\n*   **Logographic Meaning:** In this early stage, signs often directly represent an object or concept (logograms). This sign is a logogram for \"house.\"\n*   **Contextual Meaning:** While the primary meaning is \"house,\" in different contexts, É could refer to a temple (e.g., É.ANNA, \"House of Heaven\") or a household. \"Home\" is a good general term that covers the core meaning.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis confirms that the sign is the archaic form of the Sumerian sign **É**, meaning \"house.\" Therefore, the best answer choice is \"Home.\"\n\n<<<D>>>"
