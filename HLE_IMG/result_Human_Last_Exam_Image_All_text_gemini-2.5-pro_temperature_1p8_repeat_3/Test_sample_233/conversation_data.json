    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ID of the Ingvar runestone from the image fragment.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Image and Transcribe the Runes**\nThe image provided is a black-and-white photograph, likely of a rubbing or cast, showing a section of a runestone inscription. The inscription is organized into three horizontal bands. The runes are from the Younger Futhark alphabet, typical of the Viking Age.\n\n*   **Top Row:** Reading the runes from left to right, we can identify: `... ᛏ : ᛒ ᚱ ᚢ ᚦ ᚢ ᚱ : ᛁ ...`\n    *   `ᛒ ᚱ ᚢ ᚦ ᚢ ᚱ` transliterates to **bruþur**, the Old Norse word for \"brother\".\n    *   Before this word is a word separator (`:`, represented by a cross `x` in the image) and the rune for **t** (`ᛏ`). This is likely the end of a name.\n    *   After \"bruþur\" is another separator and the rune for **i** (`ᛁ`). This is likely the beginning of another name.\n\n*   **Bottom Row:** Reading the runes from left to right, we can see: `... : ᛋ ᚢ ᚾ : ᛋ ᛁ ᚾ : ᚼ ...`\n    *   `ᛋ ᚢ ᚾ` transliterates to **sun**, the word for \"son\".\n    *   `ᛋ ᛁ ᚾ` transliterates to **sin**, meaning \"his/her\". The phrase **sun sin** means \"her son\" or \"his son\".\n    *   The `ᚼ` (**h**) rune follows, suggesting the beginning of a name.\n    *   A separator (`:`) appears before \"sun\", indicating the end of the previous word.\n\n*   **Middle Row:** This row appears to show `... : ᛋ ᛁ ᛦ : ...` which transliterates to **: siʀ :**. This sequence is less common and might be part of a larger word or a unique feature.\n\n**Step 2: Contextualize the Clues**\nThe question specifies this is an \"Ingvar runestone.\" This is a critical piece of information. Ingvar runestones are a group of about 30 stones commemorating individuals who died on Ingvar the Far-Travelled's expedition to the Caspian Sea (Serkland) around 1040 AD. We need to find an Ingvar runestone that matches the transcribed fragments.\n\nThe most significant clues are the words **sun sin** (\"his/her son\") and **bruþur** (\"brother\"). This tells us the inscription commemorates someone who was both a son and a brother. Specifically, the top line `...t : bruþur : i...` strongly suggests \"brother of I(ngvar)\".\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Specific Runestone**\nWe will search the catalog of Ingvar runestones for one that mentions a \"brother\" of \"Ingvar\".\n\n*   There is only one known Ingvar runestone that was raised in memory of a brother of Ingvar. This is the famous **Gripsholm Runestone**.\n*   Its catalog ID is **Sö 179**. \"Sö\" stands for the province of Södermanland in Sweden.\n*   The inscription on Sö 179 reads: *\"Tóla lét reisa stein þenna at son sinn Harald, bróður Ingvars...\"* which translates to *\"Tola had this stone raised in memory of her son Haraldr, Ingvarr's brother...\"*\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Match with Sö 179**\nLet's compare our transcribed fragments to the text of Sö 179.\n\n*   **`...at sun sin Harald...`**: This perfectly matches our bottom row fragment `... : sun : sin : h...`.\n*   **`...Harald, bruþur Ingvars...`**: This perfectly matches our top row fragment `...t : bruþur : i...`, representing the end of the name Haral**t**, the word **bruþur**, and the beginning of the name **I**ngvars.\n\nThe evidence from the top and bottom rows provides a unique and conclusive match with the Sö 179 runestone. The middle row's text (`: siʀ :`) does not perfectly match the standard reading of the corresponding section on Sö 179 (`...inkua**rs : þaiʀ**...`). This discrepancy is likely due to damage on the original stone leading to an ambiguous or inaccurate rubbing, which is not uncommon. However, the unique and clear information in the other two rows is sufficient for a positive identification.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the key phrases \"sun sin\" (his/her son) and \"bruþur Ingvars\" (Ingvar's brother), the runestone fragment can be definitively identified as the Gripsholm Runestone.\n\n<<<Sö 179>>>"
