    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scientific name of the species that indicates this photo was taken on the Atlantic rather than the Pacific Coast.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation and Identification of Organisms**\nThe image displays a community of organisms on a wet rock in an intertidal zone. We can identify several distinct types of life forms:\n*   **Barnacles:** Numerous small, conical, sessile crustaceans are attached to the rock. These are acorn barnacles.\n*   **Gastropods (Snails):** There are several snails visible.\n    *   One large, prominent snail with a coiled shell featuring distinct, oblique brownish stripes on a lighter background.\n    *   A second large snail, mostly white, possibly worn down, obscuring its pattern. It appears to be the same species as the striped one.\n    *   Several smaller, darker, more rounded snails with ribbed shells.\n\n**Step 2: Narrowing Down Potential Indicator Species**\nThe question asks for a species that *definitively* indicates an Atlantic coast location. This means the species must be present on the Atlantic coast but absent from the Pacific coast. We need to identify the organisms more specifically and check their geographic ranges.\n\n*   **Barnacles:** The barnacles resemble the common Northern Rock Barnacle, *Semibalanus balanoides*. This species is indeed found exclusively in the North Atlantic. However, distinguishing it with absolute certainty from common Pacific acorn barnacles (like *Balanus glandula*) from a photograph can be challenging without examining specific details of the shell plates.\n*   **Small Dark Snails:** These resemble periwinkles of the genus *Littorina*. They could be Rough Periwinkles (*Littorina saxatilis*), which are native to the North Atlantic but have been introduced to the Pacific (San Francisco Bay), making them non-definitive.\n*   **Large Striped Snail:** This snail is the most visually distinct and easily identifiable organism in the photo. Its size, shape (globose with a pointed spire), and prominent striped pattern are characteristic features of the **Common Periwinkle**.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the Key Species and Its Scientific Name**\nThe large striped snail is identifiable as the Common Periwinkle. Its scientific name is *Littorina littorea*.\n\n**Step 4: Verifying the Geographic Distribution of *Littorina littorea***\nTo confirm if this species is a definitive indicator, we must check its global distribution:\n*   **Native Range:** It is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, along the coasts of Europe.\n*   **Introduced Range:** It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the mid-19th century and is now extremely common from Canada to Maryland.\n*   **Pacific Coast Presence:** *Littorina littorea* is **not** established on the Pacific coast of North America. While occasional individuals may have been transported, it has not formed self-sustaining populations there.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe presence of the clearly identifiable Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*) is a definitive piece of evidence that this photo was taken on a shoreline of the Atlantic Ocean (either in North America or Europe) and not on the Pacific Coast. While other Atlantic-specific species like *Semibalanus balanoides* are also likely present, *Littorina littorea* is the most unambiguously identifiable indicator in this specific image.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
