    "**Step-by-step analysis of the molecule's absolute configuration:**\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical structure and chiral centers.**\n    *   The provided image is a skeletal structure representation of an organic molecule.\n    *   Let's first determine the connectivity of the atoms to identify the parent chain and substituents. The molecule consists of a carbon chain with hydroxyl (-OH), amino (-NH2), ethyl (-CH2CH3), and methyl (-CH3) groups.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the hydroxyl group, -OH) must be identified. The chain is: `CH3-CH(OH)-CH(Et)-CH(CH3)-CH2NH2`.\n    *   This is a pentane backbone. According to IUPAC rules, the alcohol (-OH) group gets priority for numbering over the amine (-NH2). We number the chain from left to right to give the -OH group the lowest possible number (locant 2).\n        *   `CH3(1) - CH(OH)(2) - CH(Et)(3) - CH(CH3)(4) - CH2NH2(on C5)`\n        *   The systematic IUPAC name is **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**.\n    *   Chiral centers are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. In this molecule, the carbons at positions 2, 3, and 4 are chiral centers.\n        *   **C2:** Bonded to -H, -OH, -CH3 (C1), and the rest of the chain (starting with C3).\n        *   **C3:** Bonded to -H, -CH2CH3 (ethyl), the C2-part of the chain, and the C4-part of the chain.\n        *   **C4:** Bonded to -H, -CH3, -CH2NH2, and the rest of the chain (starting with C3).\n    *   We need to determine the absolute configuration (R or S) for each of these three chiral centers: C2, C3, and C4.\n\n2.  **Determine the configuration of the first chiral center (C2).**\n    *   **Groups attached to C2:** -OH, -CH3, -H, and -CH(Et)CH(Me)CH2NH2 (let's call it the C3-group).\n    *   **Assign priorities (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules):**\n        1.  -OH (highest atomic number of the first atom, O=8)\n        2.  -C3-group (C bonded to C, C, H)\n        3.  -CH3 (C bonded to H, H, H)\n        4.  -H (lowest atomic number)\n    *   **Analyze stereochemistry from the drawing:**\n        *   The C1-C2 and C2-C3 bonds are depicted in the plane of the paper.\n        *   The -OH group is on a dashed bond, meaning it points into the page (back).\n        *   Therefore, the implicit -H atom must be on a wedged bond, pointing out of the page (front).\n    *   **Assign R/S configuration:**\n        *   View the molecule with the lowest priority group (-H, priority 4) pointing away. Since it points towards us, we determine the direction from 1 to 2 to 3 and then reverse the result.\n        *   The path from priority 1 (-OH, back) to 2 (C3-group, right) to 3 (-CH3, left) is **clockwise (CW)**.\n        *   Because the lowest priority group (-H) is in the front, we reverse the rule: Clockwise -> **S**.\n        *   Thus, the configuration at C2 is **(2S)**.\n\n3.  **Determine the configuration of the second chiral center (C3).**\n    *   **Groups attached to C3:** -H, -CH2CH3 (ethyl), -CH(OH)CH3 (C2-group), and -CH(Me)CH2NH2 (C4-group).\n    *   **Assign priorities:**\n        1.  -C2-group (the carbon C2 is bonded to an oxygen, which outranks the carbons in other groups).\n        2.  -C4-group (the carbon C4 is bonded to two carbons and a hydrogen; C-C-H).\n        3.  -Ethyl group (the first carbon is bonded to one carbon and two hydrogens; C-H-H).\n        4.  -H.\n    *   **Analyze stereochemistry from the drawing:**\n        *   The C2-C3 and C3-C4 bonds are in the plane.\n        *   The ethyl group is on a wedged bond (front).\n        *   Therefore, the implicit -H atom must be on a dashed bond (back).\n    *   **Assign R/S configuration:**\n        *   The lowest priority group (-H, priority 4) is pointing away (back), so we can directly determine the configuration.\n        *   The path from priority 1 (C2-group, left) to 2 (C4-group, right) to 3 (ethyl, front) is **clockwise (CW)**.\n        *   Clockwise with the lowest priority group in the back means **R**.\n        *   Thus, the configuration at C3 is **(3R)**.\n\n4.  **Determine the configuration of the third chiral center (C4).**\n    *   **Groups attached to C4:** -H, -CH3, -CH2NH2, and -CH(Et)CH(OH)CH3 (C3-group).\n    *   **Assign priorities:**\n        1.  -CH2NH2 (the carbon is bonded to Nitrogen, N > C).\n        2.  -C3-group (the carbon C3 is bonded to two other carbons).\n        3.  -CH3 (the carbon is bonded only to hydrogens).\n        4.  -H.\n    *   **Analyze stereochemistry from the drawing:**\n        *   The C3-C4 and C4-C(H2NH2) bonds are in the plane.\n        *   The -CH3 group is on a dashed bond (back).\n        *   Therefore, the implicit -H atom must be on a wedged bond (front).\n    *   **Assign R/S configuration:**\n        *   The lowest priority group (-H, priority 4) is pointing towards us (front), so we will reverse the result.\n        *   The path from priority 1 (-CH2NH2, right) to 2 (C3-group, left) to 3 (-CH3, back) is **counter-clockwise (CCW)**.\n        *   Because the lowest priority group (-H) is in the front, we reverse the rule: Counter-clockwise -> **R**.\n        *   Thus, the configuration at C4 is **(4R)**.\n\n5.  **Combine the results.**\n    The absolute configuration of the molecule is determined by the configuration at each chiral center. Combining our findings, the molecule's absolute configuration is (2S, 3R, 4R).\n\n<<<(2S, 3R, 4R)>>>"
