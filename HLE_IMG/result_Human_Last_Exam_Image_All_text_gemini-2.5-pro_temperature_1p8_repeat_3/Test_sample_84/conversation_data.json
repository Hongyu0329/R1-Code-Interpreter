    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the city with a coat of arms similar to the one in the image.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Coat of Arms in the Image:**\n    *   **The Shield (Escutcheon):** This is the central element. It is divided horizontally into two fields (a style known in heraldry as \"per fess\").\n    *   **Colors (Tinctures):** The top field is blue (`azure`), and the bottom field is gold/yellow (`or`).\n    *   **Symbols (Charges):** In the top blue field, there is a gold/yellow crescent moon. In the bottom gold field, there is a black crab (`sable`).\n    *   **Crown (Crest):** Above the shield is a decorative crown, which appears to be a noble or royal crown rather than a specific mural crown (city crown).\n    *   **Wreath:** The shield is flanked by two branches. On the left is an olive branch (with green leaves and black olives), and on the right is an oak branch (with acorns).\n\n2.  **Identify Key Searchable Elements:**\n    The most unique and identifiable combination of features on the shield is:\n    *   A shield divided horizontally: blue over gold.\n    *   A crescent moon on the blue section.\n    *   A crab on the gold section.\n\n3.  **Research and Identification:**\n    *   A search for coats of arms featuring a crab and a crescent moon with a blue and gold field leads to the coat of arms of a specific city.\n    *   The combination of a blue and gold field (reflecting the national flag of Ukraine), a crescent, and a crab is characteristic of the coat of arms of **Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi**, a city in the Odesa Oblast of Ukraine.\n\n4.  **Comparison with the Official Coat of Arms of Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi:**\n    *   **Shield:** The official coat of arms of Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi has a shield that is \"per fess azure and or\" (divided horizontally, blue over gold). This is an exact match.\n    *   **Charges:** The official coat of arms has a gold crescent in the top blue field and a black crab in the bottom gold field. This is also an exact match.\n    *   **External Elements (Paraphernalia):** The official coat of arms features a silver mural crown (a crown representing city walls) and is supported by two golden ears of wheat tied with a blue-and-yellow ribbon. The image provided shows a different crown and different branches (olive and oak). These differences are likely artistic interpretations or variations, as the core design of the shield itself is the primary identifier of a coat of arms.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe shield depicted in the image, with its horizontal blue-and-gold division, crescent moon, and crab, is identical in its core design to the coat of arms of the city of Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi.\n\n<<<Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi>>>"
