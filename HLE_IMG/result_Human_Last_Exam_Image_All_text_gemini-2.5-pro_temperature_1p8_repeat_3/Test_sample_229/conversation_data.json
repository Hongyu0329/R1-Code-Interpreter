    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the General Features of the Music Sheet:**\n    *   The music is written on a single staff in treble clef. This is a \"lead sheet\" format, which provides the melody, basic chords, and structure of a song.\n    *   The time signature is 4/4.\n    *   The key signature has no sharps or flats, suggesting the key of C major or its relative minor, A minor. The prevalence of C major chords confirms the key is C major.\n    *   There is a tempo marking at the top that looks like \"Mod.\" (for Moderato) and \"♩=126\", indicating a moderate tempo of 126 beats per minute.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Rhythmic Style:**\n    *   The melody consists largely of eighth notes and sixteenth notes.\n    *   Crucially, the rhythm is heavily syncopated. Notes are frequently placed on the off-beats (the \"and\" of each beat) and tied across beats or bar lines. This rhythmic feel is a hallmark of Latin American music, particularly Brazilian styles.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Harmony (Chord Progressions):**\n    *   The chords are indicated by symbols above the staff (e.g., C, E7, F, G7, C-, D-, A-).\n    *   The progression is harmonically sophisticated, typical of jazz and related genres. For instance, the use of E7 (a secondary dominant chord leading to A minor) and G+7 (an altered dominant) goes beyond simple pop or folk harmony.\n    *   The combination of these chords with the syncopated rhythm is highly characteristic of Bossa Nova. The very first line's progression from C to E7 to F is a common harmonic movement in this style.\n\n4.  **Identify the Melody:**\n    *   Transcribing the first few measures of the melody gives the notes: E-E-F-G | A-G-E-D | C-C-D#-E...\n    *   This specific melodic contour, paired with the C -> E7 -> F chord progression and the classic syncopated rhythm, is highly recognizable.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Information to Identify the Song:**\n    *   The combination of a gentle, syncopated 4/4 rhythm, complex jazz-influenced chords, and this specific melody points directly to the Bossa Nova genre.\n    *   The melody and chords are from the famous Bossa Nova standard \"Corcovado,\" composed by Antônio Carlos Jobim.\n    *   The English title for this song is \"Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars.\"\n    *   Bossa Nova originated in Rio de Janeiro, making the country of origin Brazil.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The sheet music is handwritten, so some notation might be slightly ambiguous, but the core elements (notes, rhythms, chords) are clear enough for identification.\n*   The provided OCR text is not useful as it fails to interpret the musical notation correctly. The analysis must be based on visual inspection of the image.\n*   The title is not explicitly written on the sheet, so identification relies on recognizing the music itself.\n*   The musical instructions like \"To Go Out - Take D.S. to Coda\" refer to the song's structure (Dal Segno al Coda), which is a common practice but not specific to any one song. The key identifiers are the melody, harmony, and rhythm.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Title:** \"Corcovado\" (English title: \"Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars\")\n*   **Musical Style:** Bossa Nova\n*   **Country of Origin:** Brazil\n\n<<<**Title:** Corcovado (Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars)\n**Musical Style:** Bossa Nova\n**Country of Origin:** Brazil>>>"
