    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the phenomenon:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:**\n    *   The image consists of two plots representing a sound. The horizontal axis in both plots represents time.\n    *   The top plot is a spectrogram, which shows the frequency content of the sound over time. We see a strong horizontal line, representing a pure tone of a constant frequency. This line is momentarily interrupted by a vertical smear of blue, which represents a burst of noise (sound with a wide range of frequencies). Crucially, the horizontal line representing the tone *appears* to continue seamlessly *through* the noise burst. This suggests the *perception* of a continuous tone.\n    *   The bottom plot is the waveform, showing the actual physical properties of the sound signal (amplitude over time). We see a regular sine wave (the pure tone) which is then replaced by a more chaotic waveform (the noise burst). After the burst, the sound continues.\n    *   The key discrepancy is that while the sound of the tone is physically absent during the noise burst, it is perceived as being present and continuous. The brain \"fills in\" the missing auditory information.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Textual Clues:**\n    *   **\"illusion which, similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity...\"**: This compares the phenomenon to a famous visual illusion. The Necker Cube is ambiguous; the brain can interpret the 2D drawing in two different 3D ways and can flip between them. This comparison suggests that the auditory phenomenon in question also involves the brain actively interpreting an ambiguous signal and constructing a coherent perception. The ambiguity here lies between two possibilities: a) a tone stops, noise starts, noise stops, tone restarts, or b) a continuous tone is briefly masked by noise. The brain prefers the simpler, more continuous interpretation (b).\n    *   **\"...reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability.\"**: This indicates that the illusion demonstrates a fundamental mechanism of our perceptual system that operates automatically in everyday life. A prime example of such an ability is understanding speech in noisy environments, where our brains constantly have to \"fill in\" parts of words that are obscured by background noise.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Phenomenon:**\n    *   The phenomenon described is a form of perceptual restoration where a missing sound is perceptually \"filled in\" when it is replaced by another sound, such as noise.\n    *   This general effect is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion** or **Temporal Induction**.\n    *   However, the most famous and widely studied example of this illusion involves speech. When a phoneme (a basic sound unit of speech) is removed from a word and replaced with a noise (like a cough or static), listeners not only report hearing the missing phoneme but are often unable to locate the position of the noise accurately.\n    *   This specific, powerful version of the illusion is called the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**.\n    *   Given the clue about a \"common... perceptual ability,\" which most directly relates to our capacity to understand speech in noise, and the fame of this specific effect in psychology, the question is most likely referring to the Phonemic Restoration Effect. The image of the tone is a simplified, schematic illustration of the underlying principle of perceptual restoration that makes the phonemic effect possible.\n\nTherefore, the name of the phenomenon is the Phonemic Restoration Effect.\n\n<<<Phonemic Restoration Effect>>>"
