    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot**:\n    *   The first step is to identify the specific knot shown in the diagram.\n    *   The diagram displays a knot with 8 crossings. By comparing this diagram with standard knot tables and databases (like the Knot Atlas or KnotInfo), we can identify it.\n    *   This specific projection is a known diagram for the knot **8₁₈**.\n    *   The knot 8₁₈ is also known as the pretzel knot **P(-2, 3, 3)**. It is a non-alternating knot.\n\n2.  **Understand the Rasmussen Invariant**:\n    *   The Rasmussen invariant, denoted as `s(K)`, is an integer-valued knot invariant defined by Jacob Rasmussen using Khovanov homology.\n    *   It provides a powerful lower bound on the slice genus `g_s(K)` of a knot, given by the inequality `|s(K)| ≤ 2g_s(K)`.\n    *   Calculating `s(K)` from its fundamental definition (the Khovanov complex) is computationally intensive, especially for a knot with 8 crossings. Therefore, it's more practical to use known properties of the knot and its relation to other invariants.\n\n3.  **Utilize Properties of the Knot 8₁₈**:\n    *   A crucial property of the knot 8₁₈ is that it is a **quasi-alternating knot**. This is a class of knots that generalize alternating knots and for which certain invariants have special properties. The knot P(-2, 3, 3) is a known example of a quasi-alternating knot.\n    *   For quasi-alternating knots, there is a fundamental relationship between the Rasmussen invariant `s(K)` and another modern knot invariant, the Ozsváth-Szabó concordance invariant `τ(K)` (tau). The relation is:\n        `s(K) = 2 * τ(K)`\n\n4.  **Find the `τ` (tau) Invariant for 8₁₈**:\n    *   We need the value of `τ(8₁₈)`. This is a standard value that can be found in knot theory databases.\n    *   According to standard tables (e.g., on KnotInfo), the Ozsváth-Szabó invariant for 8₁₈ is:\n        `τ(8₁₈) = 1`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Rasmussen Invariant**:\n    *   Using the formula from Step 3 and the value from Step 4, we can now compute the Rasmussen invariant for our knot:\n        `s(8₁₈) = 2 * τ(8₁₈) = 2 * 1 = 2`\n\n6.  **Verify the Result (Sanity Check)**:\n    *   The Rasmussen invariant `s(K)` must be an even integer. Our result, 2, is an even integer.\n    *   We can check the slice genus inequality: `|s(K)| ≤ 2g_s(K)`. The slice genus of 8₁₈ is known to be `g_s(8₁₈) = 1`.\n    *   Plugging in the values: `|2| ≤ 2 * 1`, which simplifies to `2 ≤ 2`. This inequality holds, which provides confidence in the result.\n    *   Another property often true for quasi-alternating knots is `2τ(K) = -σ(K)`, where `σ(K)` is the knot signature. The signature of 8₁₈ is `σ(8₁₈) = -2`.\n    *   Checking this relation: `2 * τ(8₁₈) = 2 * 1 = 2`. And `-σ(8₁₈) = -(-2) = 2`. The values are consistent, further validating our approach.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the identification of the knot as 8₁₈, its property as a quasi-alternating knot, and the established relationship between the Rasmussen invariant and the Ozsváth-Szabó `τ` invariant, the Rasmussen invariant is calculated to be 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
