    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the jazz standard from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Key and Time Signature**\n*   The key signature has four flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db).\n*   The first chord is F minor (F-).\n*   The piece ends on an F chord.\n*   These clues strongly indicate that the key is F minor.\n*   The time signature is 4/4, which is common time, standard for many jazz tunes.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Melody**\nLet's examine the notes of the melody in the first few measures:\n*   **Measure 1 (over F-):** The melody starts on a C (the fifth of F), then moves to Eb, and F. The first phrase is C - Eb - F. This melodic shape is highly recognizable.\n*   **Measure 2 (over E-7b5):** The melody plays Bb, then G.\n*   **Measure 3 (over Eb-6):** The melody plays C, then G.\n*   **Measure 4 (over Dbmaj7):** The melody holds an Ab.\n\nThis melodic sequence (starting on the 5th of the minor tonic, rising, then descending in sequential phrases) is the iconic opening theme of the jazz standard **\"All the Things You Are\"**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Chord Progression**\nLet's list the chords and compare them to the standard changes for \"All the Things You Are\".\n*   **A Section (First 8 bars of the sheet):**\n    `| F- | Eø7 | Eb6 | Dbmaj7 | G7 | C7 | F- | C7 |`\n    The standard progression for \"All the Things You Are\" (starting in F minor) is typically:\n    `| F-7 | Bbm7 | Eb7 | Abmaj7 | Dbmaj7 | G7(alt) | Cmaj7 | Cmaj7 (or a turnaround like G-7 C7)|`\n    The chords on the sheet music are a *reharmonization*. While different, they serve similar harmonic functions. For instance, Eø7 is used instead of Bbm7, and Eb6 instead of Abmaj7. This is common in bebop and modern jazz arrangements.\n\n*   **B Section (Bridge, starts at measure 12):**\n    `| Dø7 | G7 | C7 | F7 | Bb-7 | Eb7 | Abmaj7 | G7 C7 |`\n    This bridge is fundamentally different from the one in \"All the Things You Are\". The original bridge is famous for its modulations through several key centers (in this key, it would modulate to E major). The bridge on this sheet music is a much more standard bebop bridge, based on a cycle of ii-V's and dominant chords. This suggests the sheet music is for a specific arrangement or a contrafact (a new tune written over the chords of an old one, or in this case, a new progression for an old melody).\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Identify the Composer**\n*   Despite the altered chord progression and a completely different bridge, the melody of the A section is unmistakably from \"All the Things You Are\". This melody is the defining characteristic that identifies the standard.\n*   The question asks for the title and composer of the *jazz standard*, which refers to the original source material.\n*   The composer of the music for \"All the Things You Are\" is **Jerome Kern**.\n*   The lyrics (not shown here) were written by Oscar Hammerstein II.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the iconic melody presented in the A section, the jazz standard is \"All the Things You Are,\" composed by Jerome Kern. The sheet music represents a specific, likely bebop-influenced, arrangement of this classic tune.\n\n<<<Title: All the Things You Are, Composer: Jerome Kern>>>"
