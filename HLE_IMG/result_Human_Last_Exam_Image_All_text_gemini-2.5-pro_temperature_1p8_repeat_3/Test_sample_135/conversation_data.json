    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the artwork.**\nThe image shows a high-relief sculpture set within a circular frame (a roundel or tondo). The material appears to be a light-colored, possibly white-glazed, ceramic or terracotta. The style is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance, evident in the naturalistic depiction of the figures, the balanced composition, and the graceful, flowing drapery. The entire roundel is set within a larger, ornately decorated square panel.\n\n**Step 2: Examine the subject matter and any inscriptions.**\nThe scene depicts a religious ceremony. A priest, standing at an altar, is administering a wafer (the Host) to a kneeling figure, with other figures kneeling in prayer behind. This is the Christian sacrament of the Eucharist, also known as Holy Communion. Below the scene, within a small cartouche, is an inscription that reads \"SACRAMENT DE LAVTEL\". This is archaic French for \"Sacrament de l'Autel,\" which translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" confirming the subject is the Eucharist.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the visual style and medium to known artists or workshops.**\nThe use of glazed terracotta (terracotta invetriata) as a medium for sculptural reliefs was famously perfected and popularized by the Della Robbia family workshop in Florence during the 15th and 16th centuries. The founder, Luca della Robbia, and his nephew, Andrea della Robbia, are the most prominent artists associated with this technique. The specific style of this relief, with its slightly more sentimental and crowded composition compared to Luca's work, is very typical of Andrea della Robbia (1435-1525).\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific artwork and confirm its author.**\nSearching for \"Andrea della Robbia Sacrament of the Altar\" or \"Della Robbia Eucharist roundel\" leads to the identification of this specific piece. This roundel is one of seven that adorn the predella (the base platform) of the *Altarpiece of the Holy Sacrament*. This major work is located in the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore in Arezzo, Italy, and was created by Andrea della Robbia and his workshop between 1487 and 1493. Each of the seven roundels on the predella depicts one of the Seven Sacraments. The one in the photo is the representation of the Eucharist.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the distinct medium of glazed terracotta, the Florentine Renaissance style, the subject matter, and comparison with known works, the author of this relief is confidently identified as Andrea della Robbia. It is a detail from the predella of his Altarpiece of the Holy Sacrament in Arezzo Cathedral.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
