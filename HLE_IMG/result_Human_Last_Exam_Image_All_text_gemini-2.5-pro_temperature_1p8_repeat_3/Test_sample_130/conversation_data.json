    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the image**\nThe image provided is an **emission spectrum**. This type of spectrum is produced when atoms of a gas are excited (for example, by heating them or passing an electric current through them). The excited electrons jump to higher energy levels and then fall back to their original levels, emitting light at specific, discrete wavelengths. Each element has a unique emission spectrum, which acts as a \"fingerprint\" for that element. The image shows the visible portion of this spectrum, with colors ranging from violet/blue on the left (shorter wavelengths) to red on the right (longer wavelengths).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the prominent spectral lines**\nTo identify the element, we need to carefully observe the pattern of the lines—their color (wavelength), position, and relative brightness.\n*   **Red Region:** There is a distinct, bright red line towards the far right of the visible spectrum.\n*   **Yellow-Orange Region:** There is a very strong and prominent line in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum.\n*   **Green/Cyan Region:** There are several lines here, including a notable bright green line and a slightly less prominent cyan (blue-green) line.\n*   **Blue/Violet Region:** This region contains multiple lines, with at least two or three being quite distinct and several others that are fainter or closer together.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the observed pattern with known elemental spectra**\nWe can now compare this observed \"fingerprint\" with the known spectra of common elements.\n\n*   **Hydrogen:** Hydrogen's visible spectrum (the Balmer series) is very simple, consisting of four main lines: a red line (H-alpha), a blue-green line (H-beta), and two violet lines (H-gamma and H-delta). The spectrum in the image is far more complex and has many more lines than hydrogen's. Therefore, it is not hydrogen.\n\n*   **Sodium:** The most characteristic feature of the sodium spectrum is a very intense doublet (two lines extremely close together) in the yellow region. While the image shows a strong yellow line, it also shows many other strong lines in the red, green, and blue parts of the spectrum. The sodium spectrum is overwhelmingly dominated by its yellow lines. This pattern does not match.\n\n*   **Neon:** Neon is famous for producing a bright reddish-orange glow. Its spectrum is dominated by a large number of strong lines in the red, orange, and yellow parts of the spectrum. The spectrum in the image has prominent lines across the entire visible range, including strong green and blue lines, which is not characteristic of neon.\n\n*   **Helium:** The emission spectrum of Helium is known for having several strong, well-spaced lines across the visible spectrum. These include:\n    *   A bright red line (~667.8 nm)\n    *   A very bright yellow line (~587.6 nm)\n    *   A bright green line (~501.6 nm)\n    *   A cyan line (~492.2 nm)\n    *   A prominent blue-violet line (~447.1 nm)\n    *   Other lines in the violet region.\n\nThis pattern—a strong line in the red, a very strong line in the yellow, prominent lines in the green/cyan, and multiple lines in the blue/violet—is an excellent match for the spectrum shown in the image.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nBy comparing the key features of the given spectral lines with the known emission spectra of different elements, the pattern perfectly matches that of Helium.\n\n<<<Helium>>>"
