    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to identify the figure leaving the chariot.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the artwork.**\nThe image displays a scene from an Ancient Greek red-figure vase. We can observe several key figures and elements:\n*   A two-wheeled chariot is central to the composition.\n*   Inside the chariot, there are two figures. The driver, on the left, has wings, wears a decorated sleeve, and a Phrygian cap (a soft, conical cap with the top bent forward). They are holding the reins. The second figure is a woman, wrapped in drapery, who is the passenger.\n*   Part of a white horse pulling the chariot is visible on the far left.\n*   A muscular, nude male figure is depicted on the ground below and behind the chariot. His body is contorted, suggesting a violent fall or being trampled. His arms are thrown wide, and his head is near the ground.\n*   The overall scene is dynamic, implying a chase, race, or escape.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the action depicted.**\nThe question asks who is \"leaving the chariot\". There are two possible interpretations of \"leaving\":\n1.  The passenger (the woman) could be getting out, but her posture suggests she is being transported, not dismounting.\n2.  The man on the ground could have been thrown from a chariot. His position and posture strongly suggest a violent ejection, as if from a crash. This is a much more dramatic and likely interpretation for a mythological scene. The chariot we see appears to be moving away from him, implying he fell from a different, now-crashed chariot, or was thrown from this one.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the mythological scene.**\nThe combination of a chariot race/chase, a woman, and a man falling from a chariot points to a specific Greek myth: the race between Pelops and Oinomaos.\n*   **The Myth:** King Oinomaos of Pisa would challenge any suitor for the hand of his daughter, Hippodamia, to a chariot race. He possessed divine horses and always won, killing the loser. Pelops took up the challenge. To ensure his victory, Pelops (or Hippodamia herself) bribed Oinomaos's charioteer, Myrtilos, to replace the bronze linchpins of the king's chariot with ones made of wax.\n*   **The Climax:** During the race, the wax pins melted, the wheels of Oinomaos's chariot fell off, and the king was thrown to his death. Pelops then won the race and Hippodamia's hand.\n\n**Step 4: Match the figures in the image to the characters in the myth.**\n*   **The man on the ground:** This figure, violently thrown and left behind by the victorious chariot, is **Oinomaos**, the defeated king. His posture is that of someone who has just crashed.\n*   **The figures in the chariot:** The passenger is **Hippodamia**, who is being carried away by the winner, **Pelops**. The identity of the winged driver is sometimes debated, but it is often identified as Eros (the god of love) or Pothos (Desire), symbolizing the love-driven motivation for the race and Pelops's divinely-aided victory. The chariot shown is the winning chariot of Pelops.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the iconographic evidence and the narrative of the myth of Pelops and Oinomaos, the figure who has just violently \"left\" his chariot by being thrown from it is King Oinomaos.\n\n<<<Oinomaos>>>"
