    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Clinical context:** The patient is a 28-year-old female with a mass in the sella turcica. This location is home to the pituitary gland, and common tumors in this area include pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma, and meningioma, among others. The patient's age is consistent with the occurrence of any of these, but particularly craniopharyngiomas have a bimodal age distribution with a peak in childhood/young adulthood.\n    2.  **Sample type:** An intraoperative crush smear is provided. This technique involves crushing a small piece of tissue between two glass slides, which is then stained for rapid microscopic examination. This preparation often preserves cellular arrangements in sheets and can highlight background material. The stain appears to be Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E).\n    3.  **Microscopic image analysis:**\n        *   **Cellular component:** The image shows a large, cohesive sheet of epithelial-like cells. The cells have moderately abundant, dense, eosinophilic (pink) cytoplasm. The nuclei are round to oval, with some variation in size, but they generally appear bland, lacking features of high-grade malignancy like marked pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, or prominent irregular nucleoli. In some areas, the nuclei at the periphery of the cluster appear to be slightly elongated and lined up, suggestive of peripheral palisading, although this is not perfectly classic in this fragment.\n        *   **Background:** The background is not clean. It is filled with amorphous, granular, eosinophilic material. This has a \"dirty\" appearance and is characteristic of what is known as \"wet keratin.\" This is a key diagnostic feature and represents anucleated, degenerated squamous cells.\n        *   **Calcifications:** Scattered throughout the image, particularly near the main cell cluster, are small, dark purple, often round or laminated structures. These are dystrophic calcifications or psammoma-like bodies. Calcification is a very common feature in this type of tumor.\n    4.  **Differential Diagnosis and Conclusion:**\n        *   **Pituitary Adenoma:** While common in the sella, typical pituitary adenomas consist of monotonous cells with \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin arranged in syncytial or pseudo-acinar patterns. They generally lack the \"wet keratin\" background and prominent calcifications seen here.\n        *   **Meningioma:** Sellar meningiomas can occur and often show whorls and psammoma bodies. However, the cells typically have more indistinct borders and characteristic oval nuclei, often with intranuclear inclusions. The \"wet keratin\" feature would not be present.\n        *   **Craniopharyngioma:** There are two main types.\n            *   **Papillary Craniopharyngioma:** Typically occurs in older adults and consists of fibrovascular cores lined by well-differentiated squamous epithelium. It classically lacks keratinization, calcification, and cysts. This diagnosis is unlikely.\n            *   **Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma (aCP):** This subtype is common in children and young adults. It is histologically defined by the classic triad of: 1) nests and cords of squamous-like epithelium often with peripheral palisading, 2) \"wet keratin\" (anucleated squamous flakes), and 3) dystrophic calcification. The provided image beautifully demonstrates all the key features: sheets of epithelium, a \"wet keratin\" background, and calcifications.\n\n*   **Final Diagnosis Synthesis:** The combination of a sellar mass in a young adult with the histopathologic findings of epithelial sheets, a \"wet keratin\" background, and calcification is pathognomonic for adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma.\n\n<<<Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma>>>"
