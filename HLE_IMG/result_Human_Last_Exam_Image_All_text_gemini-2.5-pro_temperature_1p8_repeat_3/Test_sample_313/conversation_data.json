    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual information and the first clue.**\n*   The first clue states: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows a man with a beard (Nikita Kucherov, an NHL player) receiving a trophy from an older man (Gary Bettman, the NHL commissioner) at an awards ceremony.\n*   A search for this event confirms it is the 2019 NHL Awards ceremony, which took place on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas (the date in the prompt is off by one day, which is a minor discrepancy).\n*   At this specific event, Nikita Kucherov won three major awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy (Most Valuable Player), the Art Ross Trophy (league's top point scorer), and the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player as voted by fellow players).\n*   Winning three significant achievements in a single event or context is commonly referred to as a \"hat trick\". Therefore, the event pictured is the scene of Kucherov achieving a \"hat trick\" of awards. This strongly suggests that X Y could be \"Hat Trick\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   The second clue states: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This clue points to an industrial or chemical process that is now obsolete due to health concerns related to mercury.\n*   Historically, mercury nitrate was used in the process of turning fur into felt for making hats. This process was known as \"carroting\".\n*   The mercury exposure led to a neurological disorder known as \"mad hatter disease\" among the hat makers (hatters), as mercury is highly toxic.\n*   The phrase \"hat trick\" can be interpreted as the \"trick\" or technique of the hat-making trade. This specific, dangerous \"trick\" of using mercury salts has indeed ceased to be used.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the clues to find \"X Y\".**\n*   The first clue points to a figurative \"Hat Trick\" (winning three awards).\n*   The second clue points to a literal \"hat trick\" (a trick/method used in hat-making involving mercury that is now obsolete).\n*   Both clues are satisfied by the phrase \"Hat Trick\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Date Discrepancy:** The prompt mentions June 20, 2019, while the event was on June 19. This is a minor difference and doesn't change the identification of the event and the people involved.\n2.  **Figurative vs. Literal Meaning:** The key to solving the puzzle is understanding the double meaning of \"Hat Trick\". One is the well-known sporting term, which can be applied figuratively to other contexts like winning multiple awards. The other is a more obscure, literal interpretation related to a \"trick\" of the hat-making trade.\n3.  **Connecting the Clues:** The first part establishes the context of Nikita Kucherov's accomplishment, which can be described as a hat trick. The second part provides the defining characteristic of the \"other\" X Y, which directly links to the historical hat-making process.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n*   **X = Hat**\n*   **Y = Trick**\n*   The pictured event shows a \"Hat Trick\" of awards.\n*   \"Another Hat Trick\" refers to the abandoned mercury-based technique for making felt hats.\n\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
