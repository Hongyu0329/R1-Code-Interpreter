    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral centers and name the molecule.**\n\n1.  **Find the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group.** The principal functional group is the hydroxyl (-OH) group, as it has higher priority than the amino (-NH2) group according to IUPAC rules.\n2.  The longest carbon chain that includes the carbon bearing the -OH group has 5 carbons. Let's trace it: from the methyl group on the far left, through the carbon with -OH, the central carbon, the carbon with the methyl and aminomethyl groups, and finally to the carbon of the aminomethyl group. Let's verify the IUPAC name.\n    The chain is: CH3-CH(OH)-CH(Et)-CH(Me)-CH2NH2.\n    Numbering should start from the end that gives the -OH group the lowest possible number. This means starting from the left side of the molecule as drawn.\n    *   C1: The leftmost methyl group.\n    *   C2: The carbon with the -OH group.\n    *   C3: The central carbon with the ethyl group.\n    *   C4: The carbon with a methyl group and the aminomethyl group.\n    *   C5: The carbon in the -CH2NH2 group.\n    The name of the parent chain is pentan-2-ol.\n    The substituents are:\n    *   At C3: an ethyl group.\n    *   At C4: a methyl group.\n    *   At C5: an amino group.\n    So, the systematic IUPAC name is **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**.\n\n3.  **Identify the chiral centers.** A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In this molecule, C2, C3, and C4 are chiral centers.\n    *   **C2** is bonded to -H, -OH, -CH3 (C1), and the rest of the chain (-C3...). These are four different groups.\n    *   **C3** is bonded to -H, an ethyl group, the C2 part of the chain, and the C4 part of the chain. These are four different groups.\n    *   **C4** is bonded to -H, a methyl group, the C5 part of the chain (-CH2NH2), and the C3 part of the chain. These are four different groups.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the absolute configuration (R/S) for each chiral center using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.**\n\nWe will use the \"swap method\" for consistency. If the lowest priority group is not pointing away (dashed), we swap it with the group that is pointing away. We then determine the configuration of the modified molecule and invert the result to get the configuration of the original molecule.\n\n**Configuration of C2:**\n\n1.  **Assign priorities:**\n    *   Priority 1: -OH (highest atomic number O=8)\n    *   Priority 2: -C3H(Et)C4... (C bonded to two other C's)\n    *   Priority 3: -CH3 (C1) (C bonded to three H's)\n    *   Priority 4: -H (lowest atomic number)\n2.  **Analyze 3D orientation:**\n    *   -OH (1) is on a wedge (front).\n    *   -CH3 (3) is on a dash (back).\n    *   -H (4) is in the plane.\n3.  **Determine R/S:** The lowest priority group (-H, 4) is not pointing away. Let's swap it with the group that is pointing away, which is -CH3 (3).\n    *   Now, -H (4) is dashed (back) and -CH3 (3) is in the plane.\n    *   We look at the remaining three groups (1, 2, 3) in the swapped molecule.\n    *   The path from 1 (-OH, front) to 2 (-C3, right) to 3 (-CH3, left) is counter-clockwise (CCW).\n    *   Since the lowest priority group is away, CCW corresponds to an S configuration for the *swapped* molecule.\n    *   Because we performed one swap, the original configuration is the opposite. Therefore, **C2 is (R)**.\n\n**Configuration of C3:**\n\n1.  **Assign priorities:**\n    *   Priority 1: -C2H(OH)CH3 (C bonded to O)\n    *   Priority 2: -C4H(Me)CH2NH2 (C bonded to C, C, H; one C leads to N)\n    *   Priority 3: -CH2CH3 (ethyl group) (C bonded to C, H, H)\n    *   Priority 4: -H\n2.  **Analyze 3D orientation:**\n    *   Ethyl group (3) is on a wedge (front).\n    *   -H (4) is on a dash (back).\n    *   The rest of the chain (groups 1 and 2) is in the plane.\n3.  **Determine R/S:** The lowest priority group (-H, 4) is already pointing away. We can determine the configuration directly.\n    *   We look at the path from 1 to 2 to 3.\n    *   The path from 1 (-C2, left) to 2 (-C4, right) to 3 (ethyl, front) is clockwise (CW).\n    *   Therefore, **C3 is (R)**.\n\n**Configuration of C4:**\n\n1.  **Assign priorities:**\n    *   Priority 1: -CH2NH2 (C5) (C bonded to N)\n    *   Priority 2: -C3H(Et)C2... (C bonded to C, C, H)\n    *   Priority 3: -CH3 (C bonded to H, H, H)\n    *   Priority 4: -H\n2.  **Analyze 3D orientation:**\n    *   -CH2NH2 (1) is on a wedge (front).\n    *   -CH3 (3) is on a dash (back).\n    *   -H (4) is in the plane (pointing up).\n    *   -C3... (2) is in the plane (pointing left).\n3.  **Determine R/S:** The lowest priority group (-H, 4) is in the plane. Let's swap it with the group on the dash, which is -CH3 (3).\n    *   Now, -H (4) is dashed (back) and -CH3 (3) is in the plane (pointing up).\n    *   We look at the remaining three groups (1, 2, 3) in the swapped molecule.\n    *   The path from 1 (-CH2NH2, front) to 2 (-C3, left) to 3 (-CH3, up) is counter-clockwise (CCW).\n    *   This means the *swapped* molecule has an S configuration.\n    *   Since we performed one swap, the original configuration is the opposite. Therefore, **C4 is (R)**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3R, 4R).\n\n<<<(2R, 3R, 4R)>>>"
