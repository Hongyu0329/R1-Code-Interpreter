    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given chemical transformation to identify the two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions involved.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants, Product, and Reaction Conditions.**\n*   **Reactants:**\n    1.  Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆): An aromatic, cyclic, conjugated 6π-electron system.\n    2.  Cyclobutene (C₄H₆): A cyclic molecule with one double bond, a 2π-electron system.\n*   **Reaction Condition:** The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hv` (light energy). This is a crucial piece of information for determining the allowed reaction pathways according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n*   **Product:** The product shown is a derivative of bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-triene. A bicyclo[4.2.0] system consists of a six-membered ring fused to a four-membered ring. The overall reaction is an addition of cyclobutene to hexafluorobenzene.\n*   **Key Hint:** The problem states that \"Two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur in this transformation.\" This strongly suggests a multi-step mechanism where each step is a pericyclic reaction allowed by light.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding Photochemically Allowed Pericyclic Reactions.**\nAccording to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, the stereochemical course of pericyclic reactions depends on the number of electrons involved and whether the reaction is induced by heat (thermal) or light (photochemical).\n*   **For cycloadditions:** Reactions involving 4n π-electrons (e.g., [2+2], [4+4]) are photochemically allowed in a suprafacial-suprafacial manner. Reactions involving (4n+2) π-electrons (e.g., [4+2]) are thermally allowed but photochemically forbidden (for suprafacial-suprafacial).\n*   **For electrocyclic reactions:** Reactions involving 4n π-electrons are photochemically allowed (conrotatory for ring closure, disrotatory for ring opening). Reactions involving (4n+2) π-electrons are thermally allowed (disrotatory for ring closure, conrotatory for ring opening).\n\n**Step 3: Proposing a Plausible Two-Step Mechanism.**\nThe overall transformation from two separate rings to a fused bicyclic system suggests a sequence involving cycloaddition and rearrangement. The photochemical reaction of benzene derivatives with alkenes is well-studied. The most relevant pathway that leads to a bicyclic product like the one shown is the *ortho* (1,2-) photocycloaddition followed by an electrocyclic rearrangement.\n\n*   **Reaction 1: [2+2] Photocycloaddition**\n    The first step is a cycloaddition between one of the double bonds (a 2π system) of hexafluorobenzene and the double bond (a 2π system) of cyclobutene.\n    *   **Type:** [2π + 2π] cycloaddition.\n    *   **Electrons involved:** 2 + 2 = 4π electrons. This is a 4n system (where n=1).\n    *   **Feasibility:** A 4n-electron cycloaddition is photochemically allowed.\n    *   **Intermediate:** This reaction forms a highly strained tricyclic intermediate. The part of the molecule that was the benzene ring is converted into a very strained bicyclo[2.2.0]hexadiene-like structure.\n\n*   **Reaction 2: 4π Electrocyclic Ring Opening**\n    The tricyclic intermediate formed in the first step is unstable due to high ring strain. It rapidly undergoes a rearrangement to form a more stable product. The strained bicyclo[2.2.0] moiety contains a cyclobutene-like ring that can open up.\n    *   **Type:** This ring-opening is an electrocyclic reaction. It involves the conversion of a σ-bond and a π-bond into two new π-bonds, which is characteristic of the opening of cyclobutene to 1,3-butadiene.\n    *   **Electrons involved:** 4π electrons (2 from the π bond, 2 from the σ bond being broken). This is a 4n system (where n=1).\n    *   **Feasibility:** A 4n-electron electrocyclic reaction is photochemically allowed (specifically, a disrotatory ring opening). This reaction relieves the strain of the tricyclic intermediate and leads to the formation of the observed bicyclo[4.2.0] system.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion.**\nThe transformation proceeds through two distinct, photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions:\n1.  A **[2+2] cycloaddition** between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene.\n2.  A **4π electrocyclic reaction** (ring opening) of the resulting strained intermediate.\n\nThe question asks for the \"kind\" of pericyclic reactions involved. These are a cycloaddition reaction and an electrocyclic reaction.\n\n<<<The two pericyclic reactions are a [2+2] cycloaddition and a 4π electrocyclic reaction.>>>"
