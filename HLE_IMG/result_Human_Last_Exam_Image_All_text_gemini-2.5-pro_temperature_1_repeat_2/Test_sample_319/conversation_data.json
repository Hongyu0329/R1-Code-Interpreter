    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the provided information.**\n    *   **The Text:** The question describes an illusion that is compared to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity. This suggests that the brain is actively interpreting an ambiguous stimulus, not just passively receiving it. The key description is that it reveals a \"surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability.\" This implies it's a process our brains perform regularly without our awareness.\n    *   **The Image:** The image consists of two plots.\n        *   The top plot is a spectrogram, which shows the frequency content of a sound over time. We see a continuous, thin horizontal line representing a pure tone. In the middle, this tone is interrupted by a short, vertical, thicker bar, which represents a burst of wideband noise. Critically, there is a physical gap in the pure tone where the noise occurs.\n        *   The bottom plot is the corresponding waveform, showing the sound's amplitude over time. It starts as a regular sine wave (the pure tone), then becomes a complex, noisy signal (the burst of noise), and then returns to a regular sine wave.\n    *   **The Illusion:** The core of the illusion is that when a person listens to this sound, they do not perceive the tone stopping and starting again. Instead, they perceive the pure tone as continuing uninterrupted *through* or *behind* the burst of noise. The brain \"fills in\" the missing portion of the tone.\n\n*   **Step 2: Connect the analysis to known perceptual phenomena.**\n    *   The \"filling-in\" of missing auditory information is a well-documented phenomenon in psychoacoustics. The brain uses the context (the tone is present before and after the noise) to infer that the tone most likely continued during the noise but was simply masked by the louder sound.\n    *   This general principle is called the **Auditory Continuity Illusion** or **Temporal Induction**.\n    *   A very famous and specific example of this illusion occurs with speech. When a speech sound (a phoneme) in a word is removed and replaced with a non-speech sound like a cough or static, listeners not only perceive the word as complete but are often unable to identify where the cough even occurred. This specific version is called the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the most appropriate name.**\n    *   The image itself, showing a pure tone, is a direct illustration of the general **Auditory Continuity Illusion**.\n    *   However, the description of a \"common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\" points strongly towards the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**. While the underlying mechanism is the same, its application to understanding speech in noisy environments is an extremely common and vital unconscious process that we use every day. The laboratory demonstration with a pure tone is less of an everyday experience.\n    *   Therefore, the question likely uses the simple diagram of the general principle to refer to its most famous and functionally significant manifestation in human perception. The phenomenon by which our brain restores missing speech sounds is the Phonemic Restoration Effect.\n\n*   **Step 4: Final conclusion.**\n    *   The image depicts the Auditory Continuity Illusion. The text describes a key application of this illusion, which is the Phonemic Restoration Effect. Given the emphasis on the \"common\" and \"unconscious\" nature of this ability in our daily lives (i.e., understanding speech), the Phonemic Restoration Effect is the most fitting answer for the phenomenon being highlighted.\n\n<<<Phonemic Restoration Effect>>>"
