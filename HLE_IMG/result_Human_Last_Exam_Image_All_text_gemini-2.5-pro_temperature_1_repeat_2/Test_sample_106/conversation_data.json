    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical rearrangement to determine the substituents at the indicated positions.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reaction type and the initial reactive intermediate.**\nThe reaction shown is the dehydration of a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol in the presence of a strong acid (catalytic HCl) and heat (110 °C). This is a classic E1 elimination reaction that proceeds through a carbocation intermediate.\n1.  The hydroxyl (-OH) group at C3 of the starting material is protonated by HCl to form a good leaving group, water (-OH2+).\n2.  The water molecule departs, leaving a secondary carbocation at the C3 position.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the carbocation rearrangement cascade (Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement).**\nSecondary carbocations are relatively unstable. The system will undergo a series of [1,2]-hydride (~H) and [1,2]-methyl (~CH3) shifts to form more stable tertiary carbocations and to relieve the significant ring strain present in the initial all-trans fused ring system (a friedelane-type skeleton). This cascade of shifts is known as a \"backbone rearrangement.\" We will track the movement of the relevant substituents.\n\nLet's denote the original positions of the migrating groups using standard triterpenoid numbering. The labels 1-5 in the product correspond to the final state of specific atomic positions.\n\n*   **Initial State:**\n    *   Carbocation at C3.\n    *   C4 has two methyl groups.\n    *   C5 has a hydrogen atom.\n    *   C8 has a methyl group.\n    *   C9 has a hydrogen atom.\n    *   C10 has a methyl group.\n    *   C13 has a hydrogen atom.\n    *   C14 has a methyl group.\n\n*   **The Cascade of [1,2] Shifts:**\n    1.  **C3+ → C4+:** A methyl group shifts from C4 to C3. This transforms the secondary carbocation at C3 into a more stable tertiary carbocation at C4.\n    2.  **C4+ → C5+:** The hydrogen atom shifts from C5 to C4. The carbocation moves to the C5 position (tertiary).\n    3.  **C5+ → C10+:** The methyl group shifts from the C10 position to C5. The carbocation moves to C10 (tertiary).\n    4.  **C10+ → C9+:** The hydrogen atom shifts from C9 to C10. The carbocation moves to C9 (tertiary).\n    5.  **C9+ → C8+:** The methyl group shifts from C8 to C9. The carbocation moves to C8 (tertiary).\n    6.  **C8+ → C14+:** The methyl group shifts from C14 to C8. The carbocation moves to C14 (tertiary).\n    7.  **C14+ → C13+:** The hydrogen atom shifts from C13 to C14. The carbocation moves to C13 (tertiary).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the final structure and identify the substituents at the labeled positions.**\nThe final step is the elimination of a proton from a carbon adjacent to the final carbocation (at C13) to form a double bond. A common product is olean-13(18)-ene, which involves the removal of a proton from C18. Regardless of the exact final elimination product, the backbone has rearranged into an oleanane-type skeleton. We can now determine the substituent at each labeled position in the product based on the migration cascade.\n\n*   **Position 1 (located at C4):** C4 initially had two methyl groups. One migrated to C3. The hydrogen from C5 migrated to C4. Therefore, one methyl group remains at C4.\n    *   **1 = CH3**\n\n*   **Position 2 (located at C10):** The original methyl group at C10 migrated to C5. The hydrogen from C9 migrated to C10. Therefore, a hydrogen atom is now at position C10.\n    *   **2 = H**\n\n*   **Position 3 (located at C8):** The original methyl group at C8 migrated to C9. The methyl group from C14 migrated to C8. Therefore, a methyl group is now at position C8.\n    *   **3 = CH3**\n\n*   **Position 4 (located at C14):** The original methyl group at C14 migrated to C8. The hydrogen from C13 migrated to C14. Therefore, a hydrogen atom is now at position C14.\n    *   **4 = H**\n\n*   **Position 5 (located at C13 or a nearby position):** The original hydrogen at C13 migrated to C14. C13 becomes a carbocation and then part of the final double bond. In the final product, C13 itself does not have a simple H or CH3 substituent. The label '5' is ambiguously drawn but is in the vicinity of the C/D/E ring junction. The most plausible interpretation is that it points to the methyl group at C17. This methyl group is a \"spectator\" and is not involved in the backbone rearrangement. Therefore, it remains a methyl group.\n    *   **5 = CH3**\n\n**Summary of Substituents:**\n*   1 = CH3\n*   2 = H\n*   3 = CH3\n*   4 = H\n*   5 = CH3\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = H, 5 = CH3>>>"
