    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual information provided.**\n    The image shows a small portion of a flag, located in the top-left square of a six-panel grid. This visible section consists of three horizontal stripes. From top to bottom, the colors are black, white, and a dark red.\n\n*   **Step 2: Search for flags with this specific color combination and order.**\n    A horizontal tricolor of black, white, and red is not the flag of any current sovereign nation. This combination was used by historical entities, most notably the German Empire (1871–1918) and the Republic of Upper Volta (1959–1984). As the prompt asks to \"Guess the Country,\" it is most likely referring to a current nation.\n\n*   **Step 3: Consider alternative interpretations.**\n    Since a direct match with a current national flag is not found, we must consider that the flag might be presented in a non-standard way. A common trick in such puzzles is to show the flag upside down.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the inverted pattern.**\n    If the flag in the image is upside down, its correct orientation would have the stripes in the reverse order. From top to bottom, this would be red, white, and black.\n\n*   **Step 5: Identify the country with the inverted flag pattern.**\n    A horizontal tricolor of red, white, and black is a common design known as the Arab Liberation Flag. Several countries use this pattern.\n    *   Egypt: Red, white, black with the Eagle of Saladin in the center.\n    *   Syria: Red, white, black with two green stars in the center.\n    *   Iraq: Red, white, black with green Arabic script in the center.\n    *   **Yemen**: A plain horizontal tricolor of red, white, and black, with no additional symbols.\n\n*   **Step 6: Final Conclusion.**\n    The simplest flag that matches the inverted Red-White-Black pattern is the flag of Yemen. The image provided shows a plain tricolor section with no symbols. If the flag of Yemen is turned upside down, it perfectly matches the black-white-red pattern seen in the image. Therefore, the country is Yemen.\n\n<<<Yemen>>>"
