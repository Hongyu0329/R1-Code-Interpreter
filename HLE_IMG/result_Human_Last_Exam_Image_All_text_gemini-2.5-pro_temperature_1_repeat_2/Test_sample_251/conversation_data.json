    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Determine the ECG paper calibration:** The information provided at the top left of the ECG strip is \"25 mm/sec; 1 cm/mV\". The paper speed of 25 mm/sec is the key to measuring time intervals.\n    *   This speed means that 25 small 1-mm squares on the horizontal axis correspond to 1 second.\n    *   Therefore, the duration of one small square is 1 second / 25 = 0.04 seconds.\n    *   The duration of one large square (which consists of 5 small squares) is 5 * 0.04 seconds = 0.2 seconds.\n\n2.  **Identify R-waves and R-R intervals:** R-waves are the tall, sharp upward spikes of the QRS complex. The R-R interval is the time between the peaks of two consecutive R-waves.\n\n3.  **Scan the ECG for the longest R-R interval:** Visually inspect the entire rhythm strip, which is displayed across multiple lines, to find the widest gap between two consecutive R-waves. The rhythm is mostly regular, but there is a very prominent pause on the fourth line of the recording. This pause occurs between the third and fourth QRS complexes on that line.\n\n4.  **Measure the longest R-R interval in grid squares:** We will carefully measure the distance between the peaks of the R-waves surrounding this pause by counting the number of small squares.\n    *   To make the measurement easier and more accurate, let's use a clear reference point. The peak of the second R-wave on the fourth line falls almost exactly on a thick vertical grid line.\n    *   Let's measure the distance from this reference point (peak of the 2nd R-wave) to the subsequent R-waves.\n    *   The peak of the 3rd R-wave is located 3 large squares and 2 small squares to the right of the 2nd R-wave's peak. The total number of small squares for this R-R interval is (3 * 5) + 2 = 17 small squares.\n    *   The peak of the 4th R-wave (the one after the long pause) is located exactly 10 large squares to the right of the 2nd R-wave's peak. The total number of small squares is 10 * 5 = 50 small squares.\n    *   Now, we can calculate the duration of the long R-R interval (between the 3rd and 4th R-waves) by subtracting the distance from R2-R3 from the distance from R2-R4.\n    *   Longest R-R interval (in squares) = (Distance from R2 to R4) - (Distance from R2 to R3) = 50 squares - 17 squares = 33 small squares.\n\n5.  **Convert the measurement from squares to seconds:** Now, we convert the number of small squares into time in seconds using the calibration factor we determined in step 1.\n    *   Longest R-R interval (in seconds) = Number of small squares × Time per small square\n    *   Longest R-R interval = 33 × 0.04 seconds = 1.32 seconds.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Correctly reading the calibration:** The speed (25 mm/sec) is essential. A different speed (e.g., 50 mm/sec) would change the calculation entirely.\n*   **Precise measurement:** Using reference points on the grid lines helps to minimize counting errors. Counting individual small squares can be prone to mistakes over long distances.\n*   **Identifying the correct interval:** It is important to scan the entire strip, as pauses can be subtle or occur anywhere. In this case, the pause is very obvious.\n*   **Understanding the rhythm:** Recognizing that the pause is approximately double the preceding R-R interval (17 squares * 2 = 34 squares, which is very close to our measured 33 squares) gives confidence in the measurement and suggests a physiological event like a blocked beat (e.g., second-degree AV block).\n\nThe final calculated longest R-R interval is 1.32 seconds.\n\n<<<1.32>>>"
