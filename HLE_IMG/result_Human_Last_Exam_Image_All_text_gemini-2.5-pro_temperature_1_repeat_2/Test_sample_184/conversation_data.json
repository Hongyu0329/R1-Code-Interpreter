    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the two products.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Materials and Reaction Type**\nThe reaction starts with a substituted cyclobutene and ethyl acrylate, heated (Δ). The problem states that the reaction proceeds via a 4π electrocyclic ring opening followed by a Diels-Alder cycloaddition. The Diels-Alder addition is specified to be *endo*.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Structure of the Diene Intermediate**\nThe first step is the thermal 4π electrocyclic ring opening of the cyclobutene derivative to form a conjugated diene. To determine the structure of the diene, we must first correctly identify the starting cyclobutene. The products (A-H) all contain one methyl group (Me), two methoxy groups (OMe), and the ethyl ester group (CO2Et) from the dienophile. Therefore, the diene intermediate must contain one Me group and two OMe groups.\n\nLet's analyze the drawn structure of the starting cyclobutene. It is a four-membered ring with a double bond.\n- There is a quaternary sp3 carbon with a methyl group (Me, wedge) and a methoxy group (OMe, dash). Let's number this C4.\n- The adjacent sp2 carbon is C1.\n- The other sp2 carbon is C2.\n- The other sp3 carbon is C3.\n- There is a methoxy group on the double bond. Let's assume it is at C1. This gives 1-methoxy-4-methyl-4-methoxycyclobut-1-ene. Let's check atom counts: C8H12O2. This matches the requirement of one Me and two OMe groups.\n\nThe electrocyclic ring opening of a cyclobutene involves the breaking of the C3-C4 sigma bond. Under thermal conditions, this 4π electron process is conrotatory. The resulting diene is formed by rearranging the atoms C4-C1-C2-C3. The new diene structure is C(Me,OMe)=C(OMe)-CH=CH2. This is 2,4-dimethoxy-4-methyl-1,3-pentadiene.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Diene**\nThe stereochemistry of the diene is determined by the conrotatory ring opening. A key principle for substituted cyclobutenes is torquoselectivity: the most electron-donating substituent on the breaking sigma bond prefers to rotate outward.\nIn our starting material, the substituents on C4 are Me and OMe. The OMe group is a stronger electron-donor (π-donor) than the Me group (σ-donor). Therefore, the OMe group will rotate outward.\nThis outward rotation of the OMe group leads specifically to the formation of the (Z)-diene. That is, the two OMe groups (one on C4 and one on C1 of the cyclobutene, which become C4 and C3 of the diene in the new numbering) are on the same side of the C3=C4 double bond.\nSo, the intermediate is (Z)-2,4-dimethoxy-4-methyl-1,3-pentadiene.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Regiochemistry of the Diels-Alder Reaction**\nThe diene reacts with ethyl acrylate (CH2=CH-CO2Et). We need to determine if the \"ortho\" or \"para\" regioisomer is formed.\n*   **Diene**: C1(H2)=C2(H)-C3(OMe)=C4(Me,OMe). This is 2,4-dimethoxy-4-methyl-1,3-pentadiene. Let's re-number for clarity: C4(Me,OMe)=C3(OMe)-C2(H)=C1(H2).\n*   **Dienophile**: CH2=CH-CO2Et. The β-carbon (CH2) has the larger LUMO coefficient.\n*   **FMO Analysis**: The OMe group at C3 of the diene strongly increases the HOMO coefficient at C4. Comparing the terminal carbons C1 and C4, C4 is more nucleophilic. Therefore, the primary bond formation occurs between the carbon with the largest HOMO coefficient (C4 of the diene) and the carbon with the largest LUMO coefficient (the β-CH2 of the dienophile). This leads to the \"para\" adduct.\n*   **Steric Analysis**: The \"para\" transition state involves the bulky C4 of the diene approaching the less hindered CH2 of the dienophile. The \"ortho\" transition state would involve the bulky C4 approaching the more hindered CH(CO2Et) end. Sterics also favor the \"para\" adduct.\n*   **Secondary Orbital Interactions (SOI)**: In some cases, attractive SOIs between the diene substituents and the dienophile's electron-withdrawing group can favor the \"ortho\" product. However, based on FMO and sterics, the \"para\" product is more likely. The products E, F, G, and H are the \"para\" adducts.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Stereochemistry of the \"endo\" Diels-Alder Product**\nThe Diels-Alder reaction occurs in an *endo* fashion. In the endo transition state, the electron-withdrawing group (CO2Et) of the dienophile is oriented \"under\" the diene's π-system. This means the CO2Et group will be *cis* to the \"inward-pointing\" substituents of the diene in its s-cis conformation.\n*   **Diene Conformation**: We need the s-cis conformation of the (Z)-diene. For (Z)-2,4-dimethoxy-4-methyl-1,3-pentadiene, the Z-geometry at the C3=C4 double bond means that the bulky C(Me,OMe) group has its OMe substituent on the same side as the rest of the diene chain. In the s-cis conformation, this OMe group at C4 points \"in\".\n*   **Endo Rule**: The endo CO2Et group will be *cis* to the \"in\" substituent at C4, which is the OMe group.\n*   **Product Structure**: We are looking for the \"para\" adduct where the CO2Et group is *cis* to the OMe group on the quaternary carbon.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the Final Products from the Options**\nLet's examine the \"para\" adducts (E, F, G, H). The quaternary center is C1, and the CO2Et group is at C3. We need the structures where the OMe at C1 and the CO2Et at C3 are cis (i.e., both have wedges or both have dashes).\n*   **Product E**: Me at C1 is wedge, OMe at C1 is dash. CO2Et at C3 is dash. Here, OMe(C1) and CO2Et(C3) are *cis*. This matches our prediction.\n*   **Product F**: Me at C1 is dash, OMe at C1 is wedge. CO2Et at C3 is dash. OMe(C1) and CO2Et(C3) are *trans*.\n*   **Product G**: Me at C1 is wedge, OMe at C1 is dash. CO2Et at C3 is wedge. OMe(C1) and CO2Et(C3) are *trans*.\n*   **Product H**: Me at C1 is dash, OMe at C1 is wedge. CO2Et at C3 is wedge. Here, OMe(C1) and CO2Et(C3) are *cis*. This also matches our prediction.\n\nProducts E and H are a pair of enantiomers. Starting with a racemic mixture of the cyclobutene would lead to a racemic mixture of these two products. Therefore, the two products of the reaction are E and H.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The logical chain (ring opening stereochemistry -> diene stereochemistry -> Diels-Alder regiochemistry -> Diels-Alder stereochemistry) consistently leads to products E and H.\n\nThe question asks for the two products. These are structures E and H.\n\n<<<E and H>>>"
