    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the types of pericyclic reactions involved and the stoichiometric byproduct.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the reactants and the overall transformation.**\n*   The first reactant is a mesoionic compound, specifically 2-phenyl-4-methyl-1,3-oxazol-3-ium-5-olate, commonly known as a Münchnone. This species is a classic example of a 1,3-dipole. The two resonance structures shown highlight its dipolar character, particularly the azomethine ylide character (C2-N3-C4 system).\n*   The second reactant is dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD), which is an electron-deficient alkyne. Alkynes and alkenes, especially those with electron-withdrawing groups, are excellent partners for 1,3-dipoles in cycloaddition reactions. They are called dipolarophiles.\n*   The reaction is carried out at 100 °C, suggesting thermal conditions which are typical for pericyclic reactions.\n*   The final product is a substituted pyrrole, which is an aromatic five-membered ring.\n*   The overall reaction involves the combination of the Münchnone and DMAD, followed by the loss of a part of the Münchnone structure to form the pyrrole.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the first pericyclic reaction.**\n*   The reaction between a 1,3-dipole (the Münchnone) and a dipolarophile (DMAD) is a **1,3-dipolar cycloaddition**. This is a concerted pericyclic reaction involving a cyclic transition state of 6 π-electrons (4π from the dipole and 2π from the dipolarophile), making it a [π4s + π2s] cycloaddition, which is thermally allowed.\n*   This reaction forms a bicyclic intermediate. The 1,3-dipole (C2-N3-C4 atoms of the Münchnone) adds across the triple bond of DMAD. This results in a bicyclic adduct where the original Münchnone ring structure is fused to a new five-membered ring containing the atoms from the dipole and the alkyne. The structure of this adduct is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative containing nitrogen and oxygen heteroatoms.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the second pericyclic reaction and the byproduct.**\n*   The bicyclic adduct formed in the first step is not the final product. It is unstable under the reaction conditions (100 °C) and undergoes a subsequent reaction to form the stable, aromatic pyrrole.\n*   To determine the byproduct, we can perform an atom count (mass balance):\n    *   Münchnone (C10H9NO2) + DMAD (C6H6O4) → Total Reactants: C16H15NO6\n    *   Pyrrole product (2-methyl-5-phenyl-3,4-bis(methoxycarbonyl)-1H-pyrrole, C15H15NO4)\n    *   Byproduct = Reactants - Product = (C16H15NO6) - (C15H15NO4) = CO2\n*   The stoichiometric byproduct is **carbon dioxide (CO2)**.\n*   The formation of the pyrrole and CO2 from the bicyclic adduct involves the fragmentation of the adduct. Specifically, the -O-C(=O)- bridge, which originates from the O1 and C5 atoms of the Münchnone, is eliminated as CO2.\n*   This elimination process, where a small, stable molecule is extruded from a cyclic system through a concerted mechanism involving a cyclic transition state, is a type of pericyclic reaction. This reaction involves the breaking of two sigma bonds (the bonds connecting the bridge to the main ring system). Such a reaction is called a **cycloreversion**. More specifically, when a small linear molecule like CO2, SO2, or N2 is eliminated, the reaction is often classified as a **cheletropic elimination** (or extrusion). Cheletropic reactions are a subclass of pericyclic reactions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   The first pericyclic reaction is a **1,3-dipolar cycloaddition**.\n*   The second pericyclic reaction is a **cycloreversion** (more specifically, a **cheletropic elimination**).\n*   The stoichiometric byproduct is **CO2**.\n\nCombining these findings provides the complete answer to the question.\n\n<<<1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and cheletropic elimination (or cycloreversion), CO2>>>"
