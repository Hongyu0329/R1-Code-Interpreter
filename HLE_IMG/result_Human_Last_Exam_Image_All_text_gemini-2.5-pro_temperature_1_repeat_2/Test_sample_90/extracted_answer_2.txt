The structures of the three products A, B, and C are as follows:

**Product A:**
 
*   *Name:* methyl (Z)-2-((10aS)-1-acetyl-2,3,5,6,10,10a-hexahydro-1H-pyrrolo[1,2-a][1,4]diazonin-4(9H)-ylidene)acetate
*   *Molecular Formula:* C₁₄H₂₀N₂O₃

**Product B:**
 
*   *Name:* (5aR,10bS)-5a-hydroxy-10b-methyl-2,3,5a,6,7,10b-hexahydro-1H-dipyrrolo[1,2-a:2',1'-c]pyrazine-5,10-dione
*   *Molecular Formula:* C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₃ (Note: The provided formula in the problem description appears to have a typo; the structure shown corresponds to C₁₂H₁₆N₂O₄. The drawing in the solution key likely represents the correct product from the reaction.)

**Product C:**
 
*   *Name:* (5aS,10aS)-10a-acetyl-octahydro-5H-dipyrrolo[1,2-a:1',2'-d]pyrazine-5,10-dione
*   *Molecular Formula:* C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₃ (Note: The structure shown corresponds to C₁₂H₁₆N₂O₃. There may be a typo in the provided formula for product C as well.)
