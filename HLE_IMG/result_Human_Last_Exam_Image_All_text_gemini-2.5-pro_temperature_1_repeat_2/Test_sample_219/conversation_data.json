    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph and the Task**\nThe image provided is a raster plot, which shows the firing activity (spikes) of multiple neurons over time.\n*   The **x-axis** represents Time in seconds (s).\n*   The **y-axis** represents the Electrode Number, from 0 to 128, corresponding to different neurons or neuronal groups.\n*   Each **black dot** represents a single spike from one neuron at a specific time.\nThe task is to:\n1.  Identify the timestamps of \"synchronized bursts\".\n2.  Calculate the average inter-burst interval (IBI).\n3.  Provide the final answer rounded to two significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts and Their Timestamps**\nA synchronized burst is a period when many neurons fire together in a short time window. On the raster plot, these events appear as dense, vertical columns of black dots. We need to locate these columns and estimate the time at which they occur (we'll use the approximate center of each burst as its timestamp).\n\nBy visually inspecting the graph from left (t=0) to right (t=50):\n*   **Burst 1:** The first clear, dense, vertical band is centered at approximately **t₁ = 3 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The next major burst occurs at approximately **t₂ = 12 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** A subsequent burst is visible at approximately **t₃ = 18 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** There is a large, prolonged burst centered around **t₄ = 36 s**.\n*   **Burst 5:** The final major burst in the recording is at approximately **t₅ = 49 s**.\n\nSo, the timestamps of the five identified synchronized bursts are approximately 3 s, 12 s, 18 s, 36 s, and 49 s.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between two consecutive bursts. With five bursts, we can calculate four intervals.\n\n*   **IBI 1:** Time between Burst 2 and Burst 1 = t₂ - t₁ = 12 s - 3 s = **9 s**\n*   **IBI 2:** Time between Burst 3 and Burst 2 = t₃ - t₂ = 18 s - 12 s = **6 s**\n*   **IBI 3:** Time between Burst 4 and Burst 3 = t₄ - t₃ = 36 s - 18 s = **18 s**\n*   **IBI 4:** Time between Burst 5 and Burst 4 = t₅ - t₄ = 49 s - 36 s = **13 s**\n\nThe calculated intervals are 9 s, 6 s, 18 s, and 13 s.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual intervals and divide by the number of intervals.\n\n*   Sum of IBIs = 9 + 6 + 18 + 13 = 46 s\n*   Number of intervals = 4\n*   Average IBI = Sum / Number = 46 s / 4 = **11.5 s**\n\n**Step 5: Round the Answer to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question requires the final answer to be given to two significant figures.\n*   The calculated average is 11.5 s. This number has three significant figures (1, 1, 5).\n*   To round to two significant figures, we examine the third digit (5). The standard rule is to round up if this digit is 5 or greater.\n*   We round up the second digit (1) to 2.\n*   Therefore, 11.5 s rounded to two significant figures is **12 s**.\n\n<<<12>>>"
