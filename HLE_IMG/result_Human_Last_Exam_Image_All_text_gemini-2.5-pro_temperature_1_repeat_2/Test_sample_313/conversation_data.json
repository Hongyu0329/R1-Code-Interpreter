    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\n*   **The image:** The picture shows two men in formal attire at what appears to be an awards ceremony. One man is presenting a trophy to the other.\n*   **The text:** \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   **Identification:** A search for major awards events around that date points to the 2019 NHL Awards, which took place on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas. The man on the right, receiving the award, is identifiable as Russian hockey player Nikita Kucherov.\n*   **The Achievement:** At the 2019 NHL Awards, Nikita Kucherov had a remarkable night, winning three of the league's most prestigious individual trophies: the Art Ross Trophy (for leading the league in points), the Hart Memorial Trophy (as the league's Most Valuable Player), and the Ted Lindsay Award (for the most outstanding player as voted by the players). Winning three major awards in this fashion is often referred to as a \"hat trick\" of awards. Therefore, the image depicts a person who achieved a \"hat trick\". This makes \"Hat Trick\" a strong candidate for \"X Y\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   **The text:** \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   **Historical Context:** This clue points to a historical industrial process. The most famous use of mercury salts that is now obsolete due to toxicity was in the hat-making industry.\n*   **The Process:** Mercuric nitrate was used to treat animal fur (like beaver or rabbit fur) to make it easier to mat into felt for hats. This process was called \"carroting\".\n*   **The Consequence:** Workers in this industry, known as \"hatters,\" were often exposed to mercury vapor, leading to severe neurological damage (erethism), characterized by tremors, shyness, and irritability. This condition gave rise to the popular phrase \"mad as a hatter.\"\n*   **The Connection:** This historical practice can be cleverly described as the \"trick\" for making a \"hat\".\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the two clues to find \"X Y\".**\n*   The term \"Hat Trick\" (where X = Hat, Y = Trick) perfectly connects the two clues.\n*   **Clue 1:** The picture shows Nikita Kucherov, who is famous for his 2019 awards **Hat Trick**.\n*   **Clue 2:** \"Another **Hat Trick**\" refers to the old method, or \"trick,\" of making a felt \"hat\" using mercury salts, a practice that has now ceased.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe \"X Y\" that satisfies both conditions of the riddle is \"Hat Trick\". The first clue refers to a celebrated sporting achievement, while the second clue uses the same term as a pun to refer to an obsolete and toxic industrial technique.\n\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
