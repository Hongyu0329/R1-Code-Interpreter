    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the rotational symmetry of the tiling in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the rotational symmetry of the tiling shown in the image. Rotational symmetry describes how many times a figure or pattern looks identical when rotated through a full circle (360 degrees). If a pattern looks the same after being rotated `n` times, it has `n`-fold rotational symmetry. The angle for each rotation would be 360°/n. We need to find the highest value of `n` for which such a symmetry exists in the tiling.\n\n**Step 2: Visually Inspect the Tiling for Centers of Rotation**\nThe tiling is a complex pattern made of different polygons: dark blue hexagons, light yellow squares, light yellow rhombi, and smaller orange rhombi. To find the rotational symmetry, we look for points around which the pattern can be rotated and remain unchanged.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Potential 6-fold Symmetry**\nLet's choose the center of one of the dark blue hexagons as a potential center of rotation.\n*   The blue hexagon itself is a regular hexagon, which has 6-fold symmetry.\n*   Surrounding this central hexagon are six identical light yellow rhombi. If we rotate the pattern by 60° (360°/6), each rhombus moves into the position of the next one.\n*   Further out, there is a ring of six light yellow squares, followed by a ring of six small orange rhombi, and then a ring of six more blue hexagons.\n*   When rotating by 60° around the central point, each shape in these rings maps perfectly onto the next corresponding shape in the ring.\n*   This observation suggests that the entire pattern has 6-fold rotational symmetry around the center of every blue hexagon.\n\n**Step 4: Identify Other Potential Symmetries**\nFor completeness, we can check for other rotation centers.\n*   **4-fold Symmetry:** If we choose the center of a light yellow square, we can observe 4-fold rotational symmetry. The square is surrounded by four identical light yellow rhombi and four blue hexagons. Rotating by 90° (360°/4) around this point maps the entire local arrangement onto itself.\n*   **3-fold and 2-fold Symmetry:** Where there is 6-fold symmetry, there is also 3-fold (rotating by 120°) and 2-fold (rotating by 180°) symmetry around the same point.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Overall Rotational Symmetry**\nA tiling's rotational symmetry is characterized by the highest order of rotation it possesses. In this pattern, we have identified centers of 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold rotation. The highest order among these is 6.\n\n**Careful Point:**\nIt is a principle in crystallography (the crystallographic restriction theorem) that a single periodic lattice cannot have both 4-fold and 6-fold rotational symmetry simultaneously. The visual presence of both in this image suggests that it might be a depiction of a mathematically impossible infinite tiling, or a non-periodic pattern (quasicrystal). However, the question asks to analyze the provided image as a \"tiling\". Based on direct visual analysis of the given pattern, we must report the symmetries that are visibly present. The highest order of rotational symmetry clearly depicted is 6-fold.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the visual analysis, the highest order of rotational symmetry present in the tiling is 6-fold.\n\n<<<6>>>"
