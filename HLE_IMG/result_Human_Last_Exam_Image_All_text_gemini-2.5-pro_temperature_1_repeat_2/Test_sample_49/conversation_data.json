    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Cutoff Frequency**\nThe circuit shown is a low-pass filter. The capacitor `C` is in a shunt position with respect to the output node `a_0`. At low frequencies, the capacitor acts as an open circuit, and the signal passes. At high frequencies, the capacitor's impedance decreases, shunting the signal to ground and attenuating the output.\n\nThe cutoff frequency, denoted as $\\omega_c$ (in radians per second) or $f_c$ (in Hertz), is the frequency at which the output power is half of its passband value. For a first-order RC filter, this occurs when the magnitude of the capacitor's impedance equals the Thévenin equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor.\nThe transfer function of such a filter has the form $H(s) = \\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = \\frac{V_{th}(s)}{V_{in}(s)} \\frac{1}{1+sR_{th}C}$. The cutoff angular frequency is given by:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\n\nOur goal is to find the Thévenin resistance, $R_{th}$, seen by the capacitor `C` at node $a_0$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Thévenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to find the equivalent resistance of the circuit connected to the capacitor `C`. The capacitor is connected between nodes $a_0$ and $b_0$ (ground). So, we need to find the resistance looking into node $a_0$ with respect to ground.\n\nAccording to Thévenin's theorem, we must deactivate all independent sources. The input signal `IN` at node $c_0$ is a voltage source, so we deactivate it by shorting it to ground. Thus, node $c_0$ is connected to ground for the $R_{th}$ calculation.\n\nThe problem now is to calculate the resistance of the infinite resistive ladder network between node $a_0$ and ground.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Infinite Ladder Network**\nThe resistance $R_{th}$ is the resistance from $a_0$ to ground. From the diagram, node $a_0$ is connected to node $d_1$ through a resistor $r$. So,\n$R_{th} = r + R_{d1-gnd}$\nwhere $R_{d1-gnd}$ is the resistance of the rest of the network as seen from node $d_1$ to ground.\n\nCalculating $R_{d1-gnd}$ is complex due to the infinite ladder structure. We can solve this by writing the KCL equations for the nodes and solving the resulting system of difference equations.\n\nLet $V_{cn}$ and $V_{dn}$ be the voltages at nodes $c_n$ and $d_n$ respectively. To find $R_{th}$, we apply a test current $I_{test}$ into node $a_0$ and calculate the resulting voltage $V_{a0}$. Then $R_{th} = V_{a0} / I_{test}$. Remember that $c_0$ is grounded ($V_{c0}=0$).\n\nFor any node $n \\ge 1$, the KCL equations (after dividing by $1/r$) are:\nAt node $c_n$: $(V_{cn}-V_{c,n-1}) + (V_{cn}-V_{dn}) + (V_{cn}-V_{c,n+1}) = 0$\nAt node $d_n$: $(V_{dn}-V_{d,n-1}) + (V_{dn}-V_{cn}) + (V_{dn}-V_{d,n+1}) = 0$\n(Note: at $n=1$, $V_{d,n-1}$ is $V_{a0}$, not $V_{d0}$. The equations will be modified at the boundary.)\n\nThis system of coupled difference equations can be decoupled by considering the common-mode voltage $V_{cm,n} = (V_{cn}+V_{dn})/2$ and differential-mode voltage $U_n = V_{cn}-V_{dn}$. The resulting equations are:\n1.  $V_{cm,n+1} - 2V_{cm,n} + V_{cm,n-1} = 0$\n2.  $U_{n+1} - 4U_n + U_{n-1} = 0$\n\nThe general solutions for these equations, considering the boundary condition that voltages must remain finite as $n \\to \\infty$, are:\n1.  $V_{cm,n} = A$ (a constant)\n2.  $U_n = C \\cdot k^n$, where $k$ is the decaying root of $k^2 - 4k + 1 = 0$, which is $k = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nFrom these, we can express the individual node voltages for $n \\ge 1$:\n$V_{cn} = A + \\frac{C}{2} k^{n-1}$\n$V_{dn} = A - \\frac{C}{2} k^{n-1}$\n\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions at the bottom of the ladder ($n=1$ and $n=0$) where the test current is injected. We define $I_{test}$ as the current leaving node $a_0$.\n$I_{test} = (V_{a0} - V_{d1})/r$.\nThe KCL equations at nodes $c_1$ and $d_1$ (with $V_{c0}=0$) become:\n1.  At $c_1$: $V_{c1} + (V_{c1}-V_{d1}) + (V_{c1}-V_{c2}) = 0$\n2.  At $d_1$: $(V_{d1}-V_{c1}) + (V_{d1}-V_{d2}) + (V_{d1}-V_{a0}) = 0$\n\nSubstituting the general solutions into these boundary equations and solving for $A$ and $C$ in terms of $I_{test}$ and $V_{a0}$ leads to a value for $R_{th} = V_{a0} / I_{test}$. This is a lengthy but standard derivation. The result of this calculation is:\n$R_{th} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Cutoff Frequency**\nNow that we have the Thévenin resistance, we can find the cutoff frequency.\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\n\nSubstituting the value of $R_{th}$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThis is the angular cutoff frequency in radians per second. The question asks for the cutoff frequency, and this is the standard form of the answer in circuit analysis.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\nThe Thévenin resistance seen by the capacitor is $R_{th} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$.\nThe cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$ is found where the magnitude of the capacitive impedance equals the Thévenin resistance: $|Z_C| = 1/(\\omega_c C) = R_{th}$.\nTherefore, $\\omega_c = 1 / (R_{th}C) = 1 / (r(1+\\sqrt{3})C)$.\n\n<<<$1/(r(1+\\sqrt{3})C)$>>>"
