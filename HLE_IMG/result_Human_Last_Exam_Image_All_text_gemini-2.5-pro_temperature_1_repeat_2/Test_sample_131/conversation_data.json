    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the molecular structure.**\n    The given image displays a complex organic molecule. We need to break down its features to identify it.\n    *   **Heterocyclic rings:** The structure is polycyclic and contains nitrogen atoms within the rings. This is a defining characteristic of an alkaloid.\n    *   **Ring System:** The molecule consists of four fused six-membered rings. Such a core structure is known as a quinolizidine alkaloid skeleton. Specifically, it's a tetracyclic system.\n    *   **Functional Groups:** There is a carbonyl group (C=O) within one of the rings. This ring also contains a nitrogen atom adjacent to the carbonyl group, making it a lactam (a cyclic amide).\n    *   **Stereochemistry:** The structure includes multiple chiral centers, indicated by wedged and dashed bonds. This specifies a particular stereoisomer of the molecule.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the parent alkaloid family.**\n    The tetracyclic quinolizidine skeleton is characteristic of lupin alkaloids, a group of compounds found in plants of the *Lupinus* genus (lupins). Well-known examples from this family include sparteine, lupinine, and lupanine.\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the structure to known lupin alkaloids.**\n    *   **Sparteine:** Sparteine has the same tetracyclic nitrogen-containing core but lacks the carbonyl group. It is the fully reduced parent compound.\n    *   **Lupanine:** Lupanine is an oxidized derivative of sparteine. It is known to have a carbonyl group at the C-2 position, forming a lactam ring. A visual comparison of the provided structure with the known chemical structure of lupanine confirms they are identical. The arrangement of the four rings and the position of the carbonyl group match perfectly.\n    *   **Stereochemistry check:** The specific arrangement of the wedged and dashed bonds in the provided image corresponds to the stereochemistry of the most common naturally occurring isomer, which is (-)-lupanine.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the name.**\n    Based on the analysis of the ring system, the functional group (lactam), and the specific stereochemistry, the compound is identified as **Lupanine**.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
