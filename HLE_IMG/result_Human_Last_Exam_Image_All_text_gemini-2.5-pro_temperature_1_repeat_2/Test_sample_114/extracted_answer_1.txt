The regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is caused by the rigid bicyclic structure of the m√ºnchnone intermediate formed from N-acetyl-proline. This rigidity has two effects: First, it prevents the substituent scrambling pathway that is observed in Reaction 2 with the flexible acyclic substrate, thereby forcing the reaction to proceed through a single, well-defined intermediate. Second, it creates significant steric and electronic differences between the C2 (methyl) and C4 (ring methine) positions of the dipole. This pronounced asymmetry strongly favors one transition state over the other in the cycloaddition step, leading to the formation of a single regioisomeric product. The results from Reactions 1 and 2 are crucial as they establish a baseline, showing that without this structural rigidity and substituent differentiation, the reaction is completely non-regioselective.
