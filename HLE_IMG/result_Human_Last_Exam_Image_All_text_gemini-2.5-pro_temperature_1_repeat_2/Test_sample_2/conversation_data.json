    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Algorithm's Logic**\n\nLet's analyze the function `sort(a, n)`.\nThe function is recursive. The base case for the recursion is when `n <= 1`. In this case, a list of size 1 or 0 is considered sorted, and the function does nothing.\n\nFor `n > 1`, the algorithm performs the following steps:\n1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: It first makes a recursive call to sort the subarray consisting of the first `n - 1` elements (`a[0]` to `a[n-2]`).\n2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: After the first `n - 1` elements are sorted, it compares the last element of the current subarray (`a[n-1]`) with the second-to-last element (`a[n-2]`).\n3.  `swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])`: If the last element is smaller, it swaps the two elements. Now, the element that was at `a[n-1]` is at `a[n-2]`, and it might be out of order with the rest of the sorted prefix `a[0...n-3]`.\n4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: To fix the potential disorder created by the swap, the algorithm calls `sort(a, n - 1)` *again*. This second call ensures the first `n - 1` elements are correctly sorted.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Recurrence Relation for Time Complexity**\n\nLet `T(n)` be the time taken by the algorithm for an input of size `n`.\n- The base case is `T(1) = c` for some constant `c`, as it performs a constant number of operations (just the check `n > 1`).\n- For `n > 1`, we need to consider the worst-case scenario. The worst case occurs when the `if` condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is always true, forcing the second recursive call to execute at every step.\n- The cost of the operations for `n > 1` is:\n    - `sort(a, n - 1)`: This costs `T(n-1)`.\n    - `if` condition and `swap`: These take constant time, let's call it `k`.\n    - `sort(a, n - 1)` (the second call): This also costs `T(n-1)`.\n\nTherefore, the worst-case recurrence relation is:\n`T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-1) + k`\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + k`\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Worst-Case Input**\n\nThe worst-case scenario happens when the `if` condition is met at each level of recursion. Consider a reverse-sorted array, for example, `[3, 2, 1]`.\n- `sort([3, 2, 1], 3)`:\n    - Calls `sort(a, 2)`. After this, the first 2 elements are sorted, so `a` becomes `[2, 3, 1]`.\n    - Compares `a[2]` and `a[1]` (`1 < 3`). The condition is true.\n    - Swaps them. `a` becomes `[2, 1, 3]`.\n    - Calls `sort(a, 2)` again.\nThis shows that a reverse-sorted list will trigger the second recursive call frequently, leading to the worst-case behavior.\n\n**Step 4: Solve the Recurrence Relation**\n\nWe need to solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + k`.\nLet's expand it:\n`T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + k) + k = 4 * T(n-2) + 2k + k`\n`T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + k) + 3k = 8 * T(n-3) + 4k + 2k + k`\n...\nAfter `i` expansions:\n`T(n) = 2^i * T(n-i) + k * (2^(i-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n\nThe sum is a geometric series `sum_{j=0}^{i-1} 2^j = (2^i - 1) / (2-1) = 2^i - 1`.\nSo, `T(n) = 2^i * T(n-i) + k * (2^i - 1)`.\n\nWe continue until we reach the base case `T(1)`. This happens when `n - i = 1`, so `i = n - 1`.\nSubstitute `i = n - 1`:\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + k * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c + k * 2^(n-1) - k`\n`T(n) = (c + k) * 2^(n-1) - k`\n\nThe dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`. In Big O notation, constants are ignored.\nTherefore, the time complexity `T(n)` is `O(2^n)`.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\n\nThe algorithm correctly sorts the array, but its structure leads to an exponential number of operations in the worst case. The recurrence relation `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + k` accurately models this worst-case behavior, and its solution is `O(2^n)`. This complexity is much worse than common sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort (`O(n^2)`) or Merge Sort (`O(n log n)`).\n\nComparing this with the given choices:\nA. O(n) - Incorrect.\nB. O(n log n) - Incorrect.\nC. O(n^2) - Incorrect.\nD. O(n^3) - Incorrect.\nE. O(2^n) - Correct.\nF. does not terminate - Incorrect, as `n` decreases in each recursive call, guaranteeing termination.\n\n<<<E>>>"
