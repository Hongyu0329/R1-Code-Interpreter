    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the final answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the different organisms in the image.**\nThe photograph displays a typical rocky intertidal zone community. We can clearly distinguish several types of marine invertebrates:\n*   **Barnacles:** Numerous small, conical, sessile (attached) crustaceans with whitish, volcano-shaped shells. They cover a large portion of the rock surface.\n*   **Gastropods (Snails):** There are at least two types of snails.\n    *   Two larger snails. One has a light brown or tan shell with distinct, darker brown spiral stripes. The other is a paler, more worn, whitish shell.\n    *   Several smaller, dark-colored (almost black) snails with ribbed shells.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate each organism as a potential geographic indicator.**\nThe question requires us to find a species that is found on the Atlantic coast but *not* on the Pacific coast. We need to consider the known geographic ranges of the species we can identify.\n\n*   **Barnacles:** The barnacles in the photo are consistent in appearance with the Northern Rock Barnacle, *Semibalanus balanoides*. This species is a dominant organism in the North Atlantic intertidal zone, found on both the North American and European coasts. Crucially, it is not native to the Pacific Ocean. Its presence is a strong indicator of an Atlantic location.\n\n*   **Snails:** The larger snail with the prominent spiral stripes is clearly identifiable as the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*. The smaller, dark snails are also periwinkles, possibly *Littorina littorea* or the Rough Periwinkle (*Littorina saxatilis*), which is also an Atlantic species.\n\n**Step 3: Focus on the most definitive indicator species.**\nLet's examine the distribution of the most likely candidates:\n*   ***Littorina littorea* (Common Periwinkle):** This snail is native to the northeastern Atlantic (coasts of Europe). It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the mid-19th century and is now extremely common from Canada down to Maryland. It is not established on the Pacific coast of North America.\n*   ***Semibalanus balanoides* (Northern Rock Barnacle):** This barnacle is native to the North Atlantic Ocean and is not found in the Pacific.\n\nBoth of these species are excellent indicators of an Atlantic coast setting. However, the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*, is exceptionally easy to identify in this photograph due to its distinct size, shape, and prominent spiral stripes. Its presence is a classic and definitive sign that the photograph was taken on a shore of the Atlantic Ocean (either in North America or Europe) and not the Pacific.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude with the scientific name.**\nBased on the analysis, the presence of the Common Periwinkle is a definitive clue. The scientific name of this species is *Littorina littorea*.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
