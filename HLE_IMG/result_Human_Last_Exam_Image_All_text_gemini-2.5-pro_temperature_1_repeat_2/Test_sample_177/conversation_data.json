    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage reduction in Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by cars. This means we need to calculate the total Car VMT for the \"Baseline\" scenario and the \"Proposed\" scenario and then find the percentage difference relative to the Baseline.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Calculation for Total Car VMT**\nTotal Car VMT is a weighted sum across all trip distance categories. The formula for a VMT index (which is proportional to the actual VMT) is:\n`VMT Index = Σ [ (Share of Total Trips) × (Total Car Mode Share for that distance) × (Average Trip Distance) ]`\nThe summation (Σ) is done over all four distance categories.\n\n**Careful Point:** The question is about *Vehicle* Miles Traveled (VMT), not *Person* Miles Traveled (PMT). Therefore, the number of occupants in a car does not change the miles traveled by the vehicle itself. We must sum the mode shares for both car categories (`car, 1 occupant` and `car, with more than 2 occupants`) to get the total share of trips taken by car. The \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" data is not relevant for this calculation.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Total Car Mode Share for Each Scenario and Distance**\nWe add the percentages for the two car categories for each distance bracket in both tables.\n\n*   **Baseline (Table 1) - Total Car Share:**\n    *   **0-3 miles:** 25% + 28% = 53%\n    *   **3-5 miles:** 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   **5-10 miles:** 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   **10+ miles:** 42% + 47% = 89%\n\n*   **Proposed (Table 2) - Total Car Share:**\n    *   **0-3 miles:** 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   **3-5 miles:** 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   **5-10 miles:** 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   **10+ miles:** 16% + 33% = 49%\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Baseline Car VMT Index**\nWe apply the formula from Step 2 using the Baseline data.\n\n*   **0-3 miles VMT component:** 0.48 (share of trips) × 0.53 (car share) × 1 (avg distance) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles VMT component:** 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles VMT component:** 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles VMT component:** 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = 2.8480\n*   **Total Baseline VMT Index:** 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Proposed Car VMT Index**\nWe apply the formula from Step 2 using the Proposed data.\n\n*   **0-3 miles VMT component:** 0.48 (share of trips) × 0.03 (car share) × 1 (avg distance) = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles VMT component:** 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles VMT component:** 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles VMT component:** 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = 1.5680\n*   **Total Proposed VMT Index:** 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\nThe formula for percentage reduction is: `((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) × 100%`\n\n*   **VMT Reduction:** 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction:** (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100% ≈ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the final answer is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
