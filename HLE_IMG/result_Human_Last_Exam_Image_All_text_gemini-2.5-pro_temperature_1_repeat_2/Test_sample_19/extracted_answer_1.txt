1. The music modulates to the key of **B minor**. This is established by the progression in measure 11, which alternates between E minor (the `iv` chord in B minor) and F# major (the `V` chord in B minor).

2. The original key of the piece is **C# minor**. The justification for modulating to B minor is based on its relationship to the relative major key, **E major**. B minor is the **minor dominant (v)** of E major. Therefore, the modulation is from the tonic minor (i) to the minor dominant of the relative major (v/III), a common and logical progression.

3. The chord on the first beat of measure 11 is an **E minor** triad. In the context of the original key (C# minor), this chord functions as the subdominant (`iv`) of the new key area (B minor). Since B is the subtonic (lowered 7th degree) of C#, the key of B minor is represented as `bVII`. Thus, the complete and accurate Roman numeral marking for this chord is **iv/bVII**.
