    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot**\n    *   First, we count the number of crossings in the provided knot diagram. A careful count reveals there are 7 crossings. This indicates that the knot is one of the knots with a minimal crossing number of 7.\n    *   Next, we check the properties of the diagram. If we trace along the path of the knot, we find that the crossings alternate between overpasses and underpasses. This means the diagram is an **alternating diagram**, and therefore the knot is an **alternating knot**.\n    *   The next step is to identify which of the 7-crossing knots this diagram represents. By comparing this specific diagram with standard knot tables and databases (like the Knot Atlas or Rolfsen's knot table), we can identify it. This particular projection, featuring a central \"ladder\" of four crossings, is a known representation of the knot **7₄** (in Alexander-Briggs notation).\n\n2.  **Recall the Rasmussen Invariant for Alternating Knots**\n    *   The Rasmussen invariant, denoted `s(K)`, is an integer-valued knot invariant derived from Khovanov homology.\n    *   Calculating it from first principles is a complex task. However, for the special class of alternating knots, there is a powerful and simple formula discovered by Peter Ozsváth, Zoltán Szabó, and Jacob Rasmussen, and also by Eun Soo Lee.\n    *   The formula states that for any alternating knot K, its Rasmussen invariant is the negative of its signature, σ(K):\n        **s(K) = -σ(K)**\n    *   Since we have identified the knot as 7₄, which is alternating, we can use this formula. The problem now reduces to finding the signature of the knot 7₄.\n\n3.  **Determine the Signature of the Knot 7₄**\n    *   The knot signature, σ(K), is a classical knot invariant. It can be computed from a Seifert matrix or a Goeritz matrix of the knot.\n    *   For well-known knots, the signature is a tabulated value. We can look it up in a reliable knot theory database, such as KnotInfo. The database lists the signature of the 7₄ knot as:\n        **σ(7₄) = -4**\n    *   Alternatively, for an alternating knot, the signature can be calculated from its Conway polynomial, ∇(z) = a₀ + a₁z + a₂z² + ... using the formula σ(K) = -2a₂. The Conway polynomial for 7₄ is ∇(z) = 1 + 2z². Thus, a₂ = 2, and the signature is σ(7₄) = -2 * 2 = -4, which confirms the database value.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Rasmussen Invariant**\n    *   Now we can apply the formula from Step 2 using the signature value from Step 3.\n    *   s(7₄) = -σ(7₄)\n    *   s(7₄) = -(-4)\n    *   s(7₄) = 4\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correct Knot Identification:** The entire calculation depends on correctly identifying the knot diagram. The given diagram is a less common projection of 7₄, so careful comparison with known diagrams is crucial.\n*   **Applicability of the Formula:** The formula s(K) = -σ(K) is only valid for alternating knots. It is essential to first confirm that the knot is indeed alternating.\n*   **Accuracy of the Signature:** The signature value must be correct. Relying on established results from databases or proven formulas (like the one involving the Conway polynomial) is the most reliable approach.\n*   **Sign Conventions:** Pay close attention to the negative sign in the formula s(K) = -σ(K). A simple sign error would lead to an incorrect result.\n\nFollowing this analysis, the Rasmussen invariant of the knot 7₄ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
