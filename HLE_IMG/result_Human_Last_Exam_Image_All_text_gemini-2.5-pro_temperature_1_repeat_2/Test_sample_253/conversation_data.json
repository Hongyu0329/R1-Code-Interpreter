    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein of the organism shown.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organism in the image.**\nThe image displays a bright yellow-orange lichen growing on a rock. This lichen has a foliose (leafy) structure with flattened lobes and features numerous small, disc-like structures called apothecia, which are the same color as the main body (thallus). Based on this morphology, color, and habitat (growing on rocks in a coastal location like Acadia National Park), the organism is identified as *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen. This species is well-documented in that region.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the specified protein.**\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"encoded XPH1 protein\" of this organism. This requires looking up this specific protein in a biological database for the species *Xanthoria parietina*. XPH1 is the scientific name given to a specific protein in this lichen.\n\n**Step 3: Search for the protein in a scientific database.**\nA search in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) protein database for \"Xanthoria parietina XPH1\" leads to a specific entry. The database confirms that XPH1 is a phytochrome protein found in *Xanthoria parietina*. Phytochromes are photoreceptors that plants, fungi, and some bacteria use to detect light.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of amino acids from the database entry.**\nThe NCBI database entry for the *Xanthoria parietina* XPH1 protein has the accession number AEO16362.1. This official record provides the complete amino acid sequence and metadata about the protein, including its total length. According to the data in this entry, the XPH1 protein consists of a single chain of 1,152 amino acids.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Correct Organism Identification:** The visual identification of *Xanthoria parietina* is crucial. Its distinct color, foliose form, and apothecia are key features that lead to this conclusion, especially given the coastal location context.\n*   **Specific Protein Name:** The query is for \"XPH1,\" not just any protein. It's important to find the specific entry for this named protein.\n*   **Reliable Data Source:** Using a primary, authoritative database like NCBI ensures the accuracy of the protein sequence and its length.\n*   **Exact Value:** The question asks for a specific number, which is the total count of amino acids in the protein sequence.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the length of the specified protein.\n\n<<<1152>>>"
