The final product A is 2,6-dimethylocta-2,6-diene, which has the following structure:
```
(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH₂-C(CH₃)=CH-CH₃
```
In skeletal form:
```
      / \
     /   \      CH₃
    /     \    /
   C = CH-CH₂-CH₂-C = CH-CH₃
  / \
 CH₃ CH₃
```
A more common representation:
```
      CH₃
     /
CH₃-C=CH-CH₂-CH₂-C(CH₃)=CH-CH₃
|
CH₃
```
This is also not right. Let's provide the final structure as an image. Since I cannot generate an image, I will describe the structure as clearly as possible.
Compound A is 2,6-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.
Its chemical structure is:
```
      CH₃
     /
   (CH₃)₂C=CHCH₂CH₂C=CHCH₃
```
This is the correct chemical structure for the product A.
