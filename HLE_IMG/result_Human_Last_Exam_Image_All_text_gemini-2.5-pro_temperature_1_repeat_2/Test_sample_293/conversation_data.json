    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Tissue Identification:** The image provided is a high-power view of a renal cortex, stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). The central structure is a glomerulus, which is the filtering unit of the kidney. It is surrounded by renal tubules.\n    2.  **Glomerular Abnormalities:** The most prominent finding is the presence of a large, crescent-shaped mass of cells filling the Bowman's space (the space between the glomerular capillary tuft and the outer Bowman's capsule).\n    3.  **Crescent Characterization:** This structure, known as a \"crescent,\" is composed of a proliferation of cells. These include parietal epithelial cells (the cells lining Bowman's capsule), macrophages, and other inflammatory cells. The presence of pink, fibrillar material within the crescent indicates fibrin deposition, which is a key component in crescent formation. This is a \"cellular crescent,\" indicating an acute and active process.\n    4.  **Glomerular Tuft Changes:** The glomerular tuft itself is compressed and distorted by the overlying crescent. There is evidence of hypercellularity within the tuft and areas of smudgy, intensely eosinophilic (pink) material, which is consistent with fibrinoid necrosis. This signifies severe damage to the glomerular capillaries, leading to breaks in the glomerular basement membrane.\n    5.  **Tubulointerstitial Changes:** The surrounding tubules show some signs of injury, such as vacuolization of the cytoplasm of tubular epithelial cells. This is likely secondary to the severe glomerular injury and resulting proteinuria or ischemia.\n    6.  **Synthesis and Diagnosis:** The combination of extensive crescent formation in Bowman's space and fibrinoid necrosis of the glomerular tuft is the hallmark of Crescentic Glomerulonephritis. This is the histological correlate of the clinical syndrome known as Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN), a medical emergency characterized by a rapid decline in renal function over days to weeks.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   It is crucial to distinguish a true crescent from glomerular tuft solidification (sclerosis) or a collapsing lesion. A crescent is a proliferation of cells *in the Bowman's space*, external to the capillary tuft.\n    *   The composition of the crescent (cellular, fibrocellular, or fibrous) provides information about the chronicity of the lesion. The crescent in the image is predominantly cellular, pointing to an acute process.\n    *   The presence of fibrinoid necrosis is a key indicator of severe vascular injury and is strongly associated with crescent formation.\n    *   While other glomerulonephritides can have some crescents, the term \"Crescentic Glomerulonephritis\" is typically used when crescents are seen in a large percentage of glomeruli (e.g., >50%), defining the disease process. This single image strongly represents this pathological entity.\n\n*   **Final Answer Derivation:**\n    The defining histopathological feature in the image is the large cellular crescent occupying Bowman's space, associated with necrosis in the glomerular tuft. This is the classic presentation of Crescentic Glomerulonephritis.\n\n<<<Crescentic glomerulonephritis>>>"
