    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Ion (M⁺) Cluster**:\n    *   The group of peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) represents the molecular ion and its isotopes.\n    *   In the provided spectrum, this cluster appears at m/z 258, 260, 262, 264, and 266.\n    *   The presence of five distinct peaks separated by 2 mass units is highly characteristic of a compound containing **four chlorine atoms**. Chlorine has two main isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75.8%) and ³⁷Cl (~24.2%), with a mass difference of 2 u. The pattern arises from the different possible combinations of these isotopes in a molecule with four Cl atoms (Cl₄, Cl₃Cl', Cl₂Cl'₂, ClCl'₃, Cl'₄).\n    *   The peak with the lowest mass in this cluster, m/z 258, corresponds to the molecule containing only the lighter ³⁵Cl isotope. This is considered the nominal molecular mass of the compound. So, **M = 258 u**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Formula of the Non-halogen Part**:\n    *   The mass contribution from the four chlorine atoms is 4 × 35 u = 140 u.\n    *   Subtracting this from the molecular mass gives the mass of the rest of the molecule: 258 u - 140 u = **118 u**.\n    *   This remaining mass of 118 u is composed of other elements, primarily carbon and hydrogen, and possibly oxygen or nitrogen.\n\n3.  **Identify the Non-halogen Moiety from Key Fragments**:\n    *   The spectrum shows a very significant peak at **m/z 118** (Intensity = 43.5%). This peak corresponds to the fragment formed by the loss of all four chlorine atoms from the molecular ion, i.e., [M - 4Cl]⁺˙.\n    *   We must find a stable chemical formula with a mass of 118 u.\n        *   **Possibility 1: C₉H₁₀**. The mass is 9 × 12 + 10 × 1 = 118 u. This would lead to a molecular formula of C₉H₁₀Cl₄. The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for this formula is DBE = C - (H+X)/2 + 1 = 9 - (10+4)/2 + 1 = 3. A DBE of 3 is not sufficient for a benzene ring (DBE=4). Therefore, a stable aromatic fragment like a substituted benzene or indane cation is not possible, which contradicts the high intensity of the m/z 118 peak (stable cations lead to intense peaks).\n        *   **Possibility 2: C₇H₂O₂**. The mass is 7 × 12 + 2 × 1 + 2 × 16 = 84 + 2 + 32 = 118 u. This leads to a molecular formula of **C₇H₂Cl₄O₂**. The Degree of Unsaturation is DBE = C - (H+X)/2 + 1 = 7 - (2+4)/2 + 1 = 5. A DBE of 5 is consistent with a stable aromatic system, for example, a benzene ring (DBE=4) fused to another ring containing the two oxygen atoms (DBE=1). The structure of **1,3-benzodioxole** fits this description perfectly.\n    *   The C₇H₂Cl₄O₂ formula is a much better fit as it can explain the formation of a stable, aromatic fragment at m/z 118 (the C₇H₂O₂⁺˙ cation radical).\n\n4.  **Propose the Structure and IUPAC Name**:\n    *   The formula C₇H₂Cl₄O₂ and the evidence for a stable aromatic core suggest the compound is a tetrachlorinated derivative of 1,3-benzodioxole.\n    *   The four chlorine atoms substitute the four hydrogens on the benzene ring portion of the molecule.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the positions on the benzene ring of 1,3-benzodioxole are numbered 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n    *   Therefore, the systematic name of the compound is **4,5,6,7-Tetrachloro-1,3-benzodioxole**.\n\n5.  **Verify with Other Major Fragments**:\n    *   **Base Peak**: The most intense peak (base peak) in the spectrum is at **m/z 225** (I=100%).\n    *   This peak is part of an isotopic cluster (m/z 223, 225, 227, 229) that shows a pattern characteristic of a fragment containing **three chlorine atoms**.\n    *   This corresponds to the loss of one chlorine atom from the molecular ion: [M - Cl]⁺.\n    *   The nominal mass of this fragment is 258 u - 35 u = 223 u. The observed cluster starting at m/z 223 confirms this fragmentation pathway. The fact that this is the most abundant fragment ion is typical for halogenated compounds.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe analysis of the molecular ion cluster (M⁺), the base peak, and the key fragment at m/z 118 consistently points to the molecular formula C₇H₂Cl₄O₂. The structure that best fits all the spectral data is a 1,3-benzodioxole molecule chlorinated on the benzene ring.\n\n<<<4,5,6,7-Tetrachloro-1,3-benzodioxole>>>"
