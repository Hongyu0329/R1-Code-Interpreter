    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the image.**\n    The image is a photograph of an ancient Greek red-figure vase. The painted scene depicts a dramatic mythological event. We can identify several key elements:\n    1.  A chariot moving to the left, drawn by at least one horse (the rear of which is visible).\n    2.  Two figures are inside the chariot: a driver wearing a patterned sleeve and a Phrygian cap, and a passenger, a draped female figure, behind him.\n    3.  A male figure is depicted on the ground below the chariot. His body is contorted in an unnatural pose, with arms outstretched, suggesting a violent fall or death.\n    4.  A winged figure, likely a deity, flies above the scene.\n    5.  The style of the vase is Apulian red-figure, from Southern Italy, dating to the 4th century BC.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the mythological story.**\n    The combination of a chariot race, a male and female pair in the chariot, and a man crashing to his death strongly points to the myth of the race between Pelops and King Oenomaus.\n    *   **The Story:** King Oenomaus of Pisa would challenge any suitor for his daughter Hippodamia's hand to a chariot race. The king had divine horses and would give the suitor a head start, but he always caught up and killed them. Pelops, a hero from Anatolia (often depicted in a Phrygian cap), challenged the king. He won the race—and Hippodamia—by sabotaging Oenomaus's chariot, causing the king to crash and die.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the figures in the image to the characters in the myth.**\n    *   **The figures in the chariot:** The driver is the victor, **Pelops**. The female passenger is his prize, **Hippodamia**. She is shown looking back, perhaps in distress or concern over her father's fate.\n    *   **The figure on the ground:** This is the defeated king, **Oenomaus**, who has been thrown from his chariot and is either dying or dead.\n    *   **The winged figure:** This is likely Eros (symbolizing the love between Pelops and Hippodamia which motivated the race) or Nike (the goddess of victory, crowning Pelops).\n\n*   **Step 4: Answer the specific question.**\n    The question asks, \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\". While Pelops and Hippodamia are *in* the chariot, the figure on the ground, Oenomaus, is depicted in the very act of having been thrown from his own (implied) chariot. His dynamic, falling pose makes him the character most accurately described as \"leaving the chariot\" at this moment.\n\n<<<Oenomaus"
