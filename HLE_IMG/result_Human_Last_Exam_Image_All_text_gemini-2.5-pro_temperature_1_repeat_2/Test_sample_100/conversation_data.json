    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and determine its molecular formula.**\n\n*   The starting material is a complex bicyclic molecule. Let's identify its key features and count the atoms.\n*   The core structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one skeleton.\n*   Substituents are a trifluoromethyl group (CF3) and a para-methoxybenzyl group (PMB) on the nitrogen.\n*   Let's count the atoms:\n    *   **Bicyclic core (C6H5N)**:\n        *   C1 (bridgehead): 1 C, 1 H\n        *   N2: 1 N\n        *   C3 (carbonyl C): 1 C\n        *   C4 (bridgehead): 1 C, 1 H\n        *   C5 (part of C=C, with CF3): 1 C\n        *   C6 (part of C=C): 1 C, 1 H\n        *   C7 (bridge): 1 C, 2 H\n    *   **Substituents**:\n        *   Trifluoromethyl group (-CF3): 1 C, 3 F\n        *   p-Methoxybenzyl group (-PMB, -CH2-C6H4-OCH3): 8 C (1 from CH2, 6 from the ring, 1 from OCH3), 9 H (2 from CH2, 4 from the ring, 3 from OCH3), 1 O\n    *   **Total counts for the starting material**:\n        *   Carbon (C): 6 (core) + 1 (CF3) + 8 (PMB) = 15 C\n        *   Hydrogen (H): 5 (core) + 9 (PMB) = 14 H\n        *   Fluorine (F): 3 F\n        *   Nitrogen (N): 1 N\n        *   Oxygen (O): 1 (carbonyl) + 1 (PMB ether) = 2 O\n*   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction to find the structure and formula of Intermediate 1.**\n\n*   **Reagents**: CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Reaction**: CAN is a strong oxidizing agent commonly used for the oxidative deprotection of para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers and amines.\n*   **Transformation**: The PMB group on the nitrogen atom is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom. The PMB group is oxidized to p-methoxybenzaldehyde.\n*   **Formula change**: We remove the PMB group (-C8H9O) and add one hydrogen atom (H). The net change is the subtraction of a C8H8O group.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 1**:\n    *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   H: 14 - 9 + 1 = 6\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n*   The molecular formula of Intermediate 1 is **C7H6F3NO**. The structure is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction to find the structure and formula of Intermediate 2.**\n\n*   **Reagents**: Pd/C, H2 in MeOH.\n*   **Reaction**: This is a catalytic hydrogenation. It reduces carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Transformation**: The C=C double bond in the bicyclic ring of Intermediate 1 is reduced to a C-C single bond. This involves the addition of one molecule of hydrogen (H2).\n*   **Formula change**: We add two hydrogen atoms (H2).\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 2**:\n    *   C: 7\n    *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 1\n*   The molecular formula of Intermediate 2 is **C7H8F3NO**. The structure is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third reaction to find the structure and formula of the final product.**\n\n*   **Reagents**: 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n*   **Reaction**: These are conditions for the acidic hydrolysis of an amide.\n*   **Transformation**: The lactam (cyclic amide) in Intermediate 2 is hydrolyzed. The amide bond (the N2-C3 bond) is cleaved. This reaction consumes one molecule of water (H2O). The carbonyl group (C3) becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the nitrogen atom (N2) becomes an amino group (-NH2). Under the strong acidic conditions, the amino group will be protonated to an ammonium salt (-NH3+), but the molecular formula is typically given for the neutral product after work-up. The ring opening results in a substituted cyclopentane amino acid.\n*   **Formula change**: We add one molecule of water (H2O).\n*   **Formula of the final product**:\n    *   C: 7\n    *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n*   The molecular formula of the final product is **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\n**Summary of Transformations and Formulas:**\n*   **Starting Material**: C15H14F3NO2\n*   **Intermediate 1**: C7H6F3NO (deprotection: -C8H8O)\n*   **Intermediate 2**: C7H8F3NO (hydrogenation: +H2)\n*   **Final Product**: C7H10F3NO2 (hydrolysis: +H2O)\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
