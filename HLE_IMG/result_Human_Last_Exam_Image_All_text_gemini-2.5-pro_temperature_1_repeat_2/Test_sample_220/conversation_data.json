    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct crystal lattice pattern.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks to identify the image that represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure when viewed along the [110] crystallographic direction. This means we need to determine the two-dimensional pattern that results from projecting the three-dimensional atomic positions of an FCC lattice onto a plane perpendicular to the [110] vector.\n\n**2. Analyze the FCC Structure**\n*   A conventional FCC unit cell has atoms at the 8 corners and at the center of the 6 faces.\n*   In a coordinate system where the cell edges are aligned with the x, y, and z axes, the atom positions can be described by coordinates (x, y, z) where the coordinates are all integers (for corners) or two are integers and one is a half-integer, or vice-versa. A simpler way to state this is that atoms are at positions (i, j, k) and face centers like (i+1/2, j+1/2, k), (i+1/2, j, k+1/2), (i, j+1/2, k+1/2), where i, j, k are integers.\n\n**3. Analyze the Projection Along the [110] Direction**\n*   When viewing along the [110] direction, we are projecting all atoms onto a plane perpendicular to this direction. A convenient choice for axes within this projection plane are the [001] direction and the [1-10] direction.\n*   Let an atom be at a position (x, y, z) in the original 3D lattice. Its projected coordinates will be proportional to `z` (along the [001] direction) and `(y-x)` (along the [1-10] direction).\n*   The depth of an atom along the viewing direction [110] is proportional to `(x+y)`. Atoms with the same `(x+y)` value will lie in the same plane perpendicular to the viewing direction.\n\n**4. Determine the Projected Pattern**\nLet's analyze the projected positions of the atoms in the FCC lattice.\n*   **Layer A:** These are planes of atoms where `(x+y)` is an integer multiple of the lattice parameter `a`. These planes include all corner atoms (e.g., (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,0,1)) and the face-centers on the z-faces (e.g., (1/2, 1/2, 0)). When projected, these atoms form a simple rectangular grid.\n*   **Layer B:** These are planes of atoms where `(x+y)` is a half-integer multiple of `a`. These planes include the face-centers on the x-faces and y-faces (e.g., (1/2, 0, 1/2), (0, 1/2, 1/2)). When projected, these atoms also form a simple rectangular grid, but this grid is shifted relative to the grid from Layer A.\n*   **Combined Pattern:** The shift of the Layer B grid relative to the Layer A grid places the \"B\" atoms exactly in the center of the rectangles formed by the \"A\" atoms.\n*   **Conclusion:** The resulting 2D pattern for an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction is a **centered rectangular lattice**. The unit cell of this pattern is a rectangle with an atom at each corner and one atom in the center. The theoretical aspect ratio of this rectangle is √2 ≈ 1.414.\n\n**5. Analyze the Given Images**\nNow, let's examine each option to see which one matches the \"centered rectangular\" pattern.\n\n*   **Image A:** This image shows atoms arranged in a simple rectangular grid. There are no atoms in the centers of the rectangles. This pattern is characteristic of a simple cubic (SC) lattice viewed along [110]. This is incorrect.\n*   **Image B:** The atoms in this image are arranged in a pattern with six-fold rotational symmetry (hexagonal). This pattern is characteristic of viewing an FCC or BCC lattice along the [111] direction. This is incorrect.\n*   **Image C:** This image shows a rectangular pattern where there are atoms at the corners, in the center of the rectangle, AND in the center of each edge. This is a **face-centered rectangular** pattern. This pattern is characteristic of viewing an FCC lattice along the [100] direction. This is incorrect.\n*   **Image D:** Let's look for a centered rectangular unit. We can identify a rectangle formed by the atoms at approximately (x,y) coordinates (1,6), (5,6), (1,12), and (5,12). The center of this rectangle would be at (x=(1+5)/2=3, y=(6+12)/2=9). There is indeed an atom at (3,9). This fundamental \"rectangle with a center atom\" motif matches our prediction for a centered rectangular pattern. The other atoms in the image belong to adjacent repeating unit cells. The aspect ratio of this rectangle is (12-6)/(5-1) = 6/4 = 1.5, which is reasonably close to the theoretical value of √2.\n\n**Final Decision**\nBased on the analysis, Image D is the only one that displays the centered rectangular pattern characteristic of an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
