    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the characters on the seal:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Seal's Layout and Reading Order:**\n    *   The seal is square with four characters arranged in a 2x2 grid.\n    *   The standard reading order for traditional Chinese seals is from top to bottom, and from right to left.\n    *   Therefore, the reading sequence is: top-right character -> bottom-right character -> top-left character -> bottom-left character.\n\n2.  **Identify Each Character:**\n    *   **Top-Right Character:** This character is an ancient seal script (篆書, zhuànshū). It has a figure-like base with long, flowing lines on top, which is a classic representation of **長 (cháng)**, meaning \"long\".\n    *   **Bottom-Right Character:** This character has an enclosure radical '囗' and an inner component '袁'. This combination forms the character **園 (yuán)**, meaning \"garden\".\n    *   **Top-Left Character:** This character resembles a person ('大') with a horizontal line on top, representing the heavens above. This is the seal script for **天 (tiān)**, meaning \"sky\" or \"heaven\".\n    *   **Bottom-Left Character:** This is a complex character with many strokes. It is a recognizable, stylized seal script version of **壽 (shòu)**, meaning \"longevity\".\n\n3.  **Assemble the Phrase in Traditional Chinese:**\n    *   Following the reading order, the four characters are **長園天壽 (Chángyuán Tiānshòu)**.\n    *   This phrase can be interpreted as \"[Seal of] Changyuan (a name), [wishing for] Heavenly Longevity\".\n\n4.  **Convert to Simplified Chinese:**\n    *   The character 長 is simplified to **长**.\n    *   The character 園 is simplified to **园**.\n    *   The character 天 remains **天**.\n    *   The character 壽 is simplified to **寿**.\n\n5.  **Final Character Content:**\n    *   Combining the simplified characters in the correct order, the content on the seal is **长园天寿**.\n\n<<<长园天寿>>>"
