    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to identify the opera.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the General Characteristics of the Score**\n\n*   **Instrumentation:** The score is written for a large orchestra. We can see parts for Flutes (`2 gr. Fl.`), Oboe (`I. Hob.`), English Horn (`engl. Horn`), Bassoon (`I. Fag.`), and a large string section (`I. Viol.`, `II. Viol.`, `Br.` (Viola), `Celli`). The strings are divided into multiple parts (`1. Pult`, `2. Pult`, `(die übrigen)`, `Solo`), which indicates a complex and rich orchestral texture.\n*   **Language:** The instrument names and performance directions are in German. For example:\n    *   `gr. Fl.` stands for `Grosse Flöten` (Flutes).\n    *   `Hob.` is short for `Oboe`.\n    *   `Br.` is short for `Bratsche` (Viola).\n    *   `(die übrigen)` means \"the rest\".\n    *   `(mit Dämpfer)` means \"with mute\".\n    *   `(Vorhang)` means \"Curtain\".\n*   **Musical Style:** The harmony is highly chromatic, the melodic lines are expansive and expressive, and the use of dynamics is very detailed (`p`, `pp`, `dim.`, `mf`, `gliss.`). This points towards the late-Romantic or early 20th-century period, with composers like Richard Wagner, Gustav Mahler, or Richard Strauss.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Key Musical and Contextual Clues**\n\n*   **Contextual Indication:** The marking `1 (Vorhang)` above the first violin part is a crucial clue. It indicates that at rehearsal mark 1, the stage curtain (`Vorhang`) rises. The question states this is the opening of the second act. So, we are looking at the very beginning of Act II of a German opera.\n*   **Melodic Content:** The most distinctive feature is the solo viola (`Solo Br.`) part in the lower half of the score. This melody, starting on G-sharp, is extremely famous in the operatic repertoire. This theme is known as the \"Presentation of the Rose\" or \"Silver Rose\" motif.\n*   **Orchestration Details:** The opening features a shimmering, ethereal texture created by the woodwinds and muted strings (`mit Dämpfer`). This builds dramatically with rising lines in the strings and a `gliss.` (glissando) effect, creating a sense of anticipation and magic.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Clues and Conclude**\n\n*   The combination of a large, lush orchestra, German language, a late-Romantic style, and the very specific and famous \"Silver Rose\" theme points directly to one opera.\n*   The \"Silver Rose\" motif is the central musical idea in the opera **Der Rosenkavalier** by Richard Strauss.\n*   This specific musical passage is the introduction to Act II of *Der Rosenkavalier*, which depicts the excitement in the Faninal household as they await the arrival of the Rosenkavalier (the \"rose cavalier\"). The music culminates in the famous \"Presentation of the Rose\" scene, one of the most beautiful and beloved moments in the opera.\n\nThe opera is Richard Strauss's *Der Rosenkavalier*.\n\n<<<Der Rosenkavalier>>>"
