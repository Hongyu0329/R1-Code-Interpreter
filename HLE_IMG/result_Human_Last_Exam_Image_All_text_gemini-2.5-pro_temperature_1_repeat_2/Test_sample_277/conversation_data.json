    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants to identify the isomeric relationship between two molecules supposedly shown in an image. The options are conformers, constitutional isomers, identical molecules, stereoisomers, or none of these.\n\n2.  **Examine the Provided Information:** The image provided is completely black. There are no drawings of molecules or any chemical structures visible. The question refers to \"the molecules mentioned above,\" but no molecules are actually shown.\n\n3.  **Define the Key Terms (the options):** To answer such a question, one must understand the definitions of the different types of isomers.\n    *   **(a) Conformational isomers (conformers):** These are different spatial arrangements of the same molecule that can be converted into one another by rotation around single bonds. They have the same molecular formula and the same atomic connectivity.\n    *   **(b) Constitutional isomers (or structural isomers):** These are molecules that have the same molecular formula but a different connectivity (i.e., the atoms are bonded together in a different order).\n    *   **(c) Identical:** These are not isomers but are the same molecule. They can be perfectly superimposed on each other, perhaps after rotating the entire molecule in space.\n    *   **(d) Stereoisomers:** These are molecules that have the same molecular formula and the same connectivity, but they have a different fixed arrangement of their atoms in three-dimensional space. They cannot be interconverted by rotation around single bonds. This category includes enantiomers and diastereomers.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Process for Comparison:** If two molecular structures were provided, the analysis would proceed as follows:\n    *   **First, determine the molecular formula for each molecule.** If the formulas are different, they are different compounds, not isomers.\n    *   **Second, if the molecular formulas are the same, determine the connectivity of the atoms.** If the connectivity is different, they are **constitutional isomers**.\n    *   **Third, if both the molecular formula and connectivity are the same, compare their 3D spatial arrangement.**\n        *   If they can be interconverted by rotation around single bonds, they are **conformers**.\n        *   If they are superimposable (without breaking bonds), they are **identical**.\n        *   If they are not superimposable and not interconvertible by single bond rotation, they are **stereoisomers**.\n\n5.  **Apply the Process to the Given Problem:** Since the image is blank and shows no molecules, we cannot perform any of the steps outlined above. We cannot determine the molecular formula, the connectivity, or the spatial arrangement of the atoms for the non-existent molecules.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Because the necessary information (the structures of the molecules) is missing, it is impossible to determine the relationship between them. We cannot definitively say they are conformers, constitutional isomers, identical, or stereoisomers. Therefore, none of the specific classifications in options (a), (b), (c), or (d) can be proven correct. The only logical choice is (e), which covers cases where the other options are not applicable. In this situation, they are not applicable because the question is unanswerable.\n\n<<<e>>>"
