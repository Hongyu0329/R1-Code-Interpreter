    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks to identify which of the four depicted iridium complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes when used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). In the context of device performance, \"lifetime\" typically refers to the operational stability of the emitter, meaning how long it can function before degrading. A shorter lifetime implies lower stability.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Molecular Structures:** All four molecules are cationic iridium(III) complexes with the general formula `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+`, where `PF6-` is the counter-ion.\n    *   **Central Metal:** Iridium(III).\n    *   **N^N Ligand:** This is the bidentate diimine ligand. In all four complexes, it is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. Since this ligand is identical in all four complexes, it is not the source of the difference in their expected lifetimes. The bulky tert-butyl groups are typically added to improve solubility and prevent aggregation.\n    *   **C^N Ligands:** These are the cyclometalating ligands. Each complex has two identical C^N ligands. These are derivatives of 2-phenylpyridine, where the iridium is bonded to the phenyl ring's carbon (C2') and the pyridine's nitrogen. The variation among the four complexes lies in the substituents on the phenyl ring of these C^N ligands.\n\n3.  **Compare the C^N Ligands:**\n    *   **Complex 1:** The ligand is 2-(2',4'-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has fluorine atoms at the ortho (2') and para (4') positions of the phenyl ring.\n    *   **Complex 2:** The ligand is 2-phenylpyridine. It has no substituents on the phenyl ring. The ortho position (2') has a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Complex 3:** The ligand is 2-(2'-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has a single fluorine atom at the ortho (2') position of the phenyl ring.\n    *   **Complex 4:** The ligand is 2-(2',4',5'-trifluorophenyl)pyridine. It has three fluorine atoms at the ortho (2'), para (4'), and meta (5') positions of the phenyl ring.\n\n4.  **Relate Structural Differences to Stability (Lifetime):** The stability of these types of iridium complexes in operating devices is a well-studied topic. One of the primary factors determining their operational lifetime is the nature of the substituent at the ortho-position of the cyclometalating phenyl ring (the position labeled 2').\n    *   **The Role of the ortho-C-H Bond:** The C-H bond at the 2'-position is a known site of vulnerability. This bond is relatively weak and its proximity to the iridium center makes it susceptible to various degradation reactions during device operation (e.g., reductive quenching, exciton-induced bond cleavage). This degradation pathway is a major limiter of device lifetime for complexes with an ortho-C-H bond.\n    *   **The Role of the ortho-C-F Bond:** Fluorine is a small, highly electronegative atom. The C-F bond is significantly stronger and more chemically inert than the C-H bond. Replacing the hydrogen at the 2'-position with a fluorine atom effectively blocks the degradation pathway associated with the ortho-C-H bond. This substitution is a widely employed and highly effective strategy to enhance the chemical and photochemical stability of iridium emitters, leading to significantly longer operational lifetimes.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Each Complex:**\n    *   **Complex 2** is the only complex that has a hydrogen atom at the vulnerable ortho-position (2') of its phenylpyridine ligands. It is therefore expected to be susceptible to the degradation pathway described above.\n    *   **Complexes 1, 3, and 4** all have a fluorine atom at the 2'-position. This C-F bond is much more stable, and its presence will protect the complex from the ortho-C-H-related degradation. These complexes are therefore expected to be significantly more stable than Complex 2.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the presence of the vulnerable ortho-C-H bond, Complex 2 is expected to be the least stable among the four. It will likely degrade faster during the operation of an LEC, resulting in a shorter device lifetime compared to Complexes 1, 3, and 4. While there might be smaller differences in stability among complexes 1, 3, and 4 (due to the number and position of additional fluorine atoms affecting oxidative stability), the difference between having an ortho-H (Complex 2) and an ortho-F (Complexes 1, 3, 4) is the most critical and dominant factor for operational lifetime in this series. Therefore, Complex 2 is the one expected to show a shorter lifetime.\n\n<<<B>>>"
