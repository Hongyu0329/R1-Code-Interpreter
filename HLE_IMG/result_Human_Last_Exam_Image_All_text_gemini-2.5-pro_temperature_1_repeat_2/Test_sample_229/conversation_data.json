    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the title, musical style, and country of origin of the song from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Musicological Examination:**\n    *   **Clef and Key:** The music is written in the treble clef with a 4/4 time signature. There are no sharps or flats in the key signature, which suggests the key of C major or its relative minor, A minor. The piece begins and ends on a C chord, strongly indicating the key is **C major**.\n    *   **Tempo:** A tempo marking \"Mod.\" (Moderato) and a metronome marking that appears to be \"♩ = 128\" are visible at the top, indicating a moderately fast tempo.\n    *   **Chord Progression:** The sheet music is a \"lead sheet,\" showing the melody with chord symbols written above. The initial chord progression is **C | E7 | F | F G7 ||**. This use of E7 (the dominant of A minor) leading to F is a distinctive harmonic feature.\n    *   **Rhythm and Melody:** The melody is highly syncopated, featuring many eighth notes, sixteenth notes, and ties across beats. This rhythmic complexity is a key characteristic. The opening melodic phrase is G-E-G-E followed by a rising run F#-G-A-B-C. This is a very recognizable melodic hook.\n    *   **Structure:** The instructions \"To Go Out - Take D.S. to Coda\" indicate a standard song form with a repeat (Dal Segno) and a final ending section (Coda).\n\n2.  **Identifying the Song:**\n    *   Based on the highly recognizable melody and the distinctive chord progression, the song can be identified as **\"Tico-Tico no Fubá\"**. The opening bars of this famous piece match the provided sheet music exactly.\n\n3.  **Determining the Musical Style:**\n    *   \"Tico-Tico no Fubá\" is one of the most famous examples of the **Choro** musical genre.\n    *   Choro is an instrumental Brazilian popular music style characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic playing, counterpoint, and syncopation. It originated in Rio de Janeiro in the 19th century and is considered a precursor to other Brazilian styles like Samba and Bossa Nova. Due to its rhythmic feel and improvisational nature, it is often performed in a **Latin Jazz** context as well, but Choro is its original and most specific classification.\n\n4.  **Determining the Country of Origin:**\n    *   The song was composed in 1917 by **Zequinha de Abreu**, who was a Brazilian composer.\n    *   The musical style, Choro, is native to **Brazil**.\n    *   Therefore, the country of origin is unequivocally Brazil.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy analyzing the melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic content of the sheet music, the song is identified as \"Tico-Tico no Fubá.\" Research into this piece confirms its musical style as Choro and its origin as Brazilian.\n\n<<<**Title:** Tico-Tico no Fubá\n**Musical Style:** Choro (also categorized as Latin Jazz)\n**Country of Origin:** Brazil>>>"
