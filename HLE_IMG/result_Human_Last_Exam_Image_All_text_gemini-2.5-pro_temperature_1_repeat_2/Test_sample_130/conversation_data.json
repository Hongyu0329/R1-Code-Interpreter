    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Image**\nThe image provided is an emission spectrum. When atoms of an element are excited (for example, by heating them or passing an electric current through them), they emit light at specific, discrete wavelengths. When this light is passed through a prism or a diffraction grating, it separates into a series of bright lines of different colors. This unique pattern of lines is called the element's emission spectrum and acts as a \"fingerprint\" for that element. The image shows the visible part of such a spectrum, with colors ranging from violet/blue on the left to red on the right.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Key Features of the Spectrum**\nWe need to carefully observe the prominent lines and their positions (colors) in the spectrum shown.\n*   **Red Region (Right Side):** There is a very distinct and bright red line. There are also a couple of other, fainter red lines nearby.\n*   **Yellow-Orange Region:** There is one extremely prominent, bright yellow-orange line. This is a key feature.\n*   **Green Region:** There is a prominent bright green line, and another distinct line in the blue-green (cyan) area.\n*   **Blue-Violet Region (Left Side):** There are several clearly visible lines in the blue and deep-violet part of the spectrum.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Observed Spectrum with Known Spectra of Elements**\nNow, we compare this observed pattern with the well-known visible spectra of some common elements.\n\n*   **Hydrogen:** The visible spectrum of hydrogen (the Balmer series) is very simple, consisting of four main lines: a red line (H-alpha), a blue-green line (H-beta), a blue-violet line (H-gamma), and a violet line (H-delta). The spectrum in the image is much more complex and has a prominent yellow line, which hydrogen lacks. Therefore, it is not hydrogen.\n\n*   **Sodium:** The visible spectrum of sodium is dominated by a very strong pair of yellow lines (a doublet) that are very close together and often appear as a single, intense yellow line. While the image shows a strong yellow line, it also shows many other strong lines in the red, green, and blue parts of the spectrum, which are not characteristic of sodium. Therefore, it is not sodium.\n\n*   **Neon:** Neon is famous for its bright red-orange glow in signs. Its spectrum has a large number of very strong lines in the red and orange regions, but it is much weaker in the green and blue regions. The spectrum in the image has strong lines across all colors. Therefore, it is not neon.\n\n*   **Helium:** Helium has a characteristic spectrum with several prominent lines distributed across the visible range. Its most notable lines are:\n    *   A strong red line (at ~667.8 nm)\n    *   A very bright yellow line (at ~587.6 nm)\n    *   A bright green line (at ~501.6 nm)\n    *   A blue-green/cyan line (at ~492.2 nm)\n    *   Several blue and violet lines (e.g., at ~471.3 nm and ~447.1 nm)\n\nThis pattern perfectly matches the lines we observed in the image: a strong red, a very prominent yellow, a bright green, a cyan line, and multiple blue/violet lines. The image is a classic textbook representation of the emission spectrum of Helium.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nBased on the detailed comparison of the pattern of the spectral lines (colors, positions, and relative intensities) with the known spectra of various elements, the spectrum shown in the image is uniquely identified as that of Helium.\n\n<<<Helium>>>"
