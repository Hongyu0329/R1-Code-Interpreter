    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the title and composer of the jazz standard.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Key and Time Signature**\n*   The key signature has four flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db), which indicates the key of Ab Major or F Minor.\n*   The first chord is F minor (written as F-), which strongly suggests the piece is in the key of F Minor.\n*   The time signature is 4/4, also known as common time, which is typical for many jazz standards.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chord Progression**\nThe chord progression is the most crucial clue for identifying a jazz standard. Let's break down the harmony of the piece:\n*   **A Section (First 8 bars):** The song begins with a very distinctive harmonic movement:\n    *   `Fm` (the tonic minor chord, i)\n    *   `Eø7` (or E-7b5, the half-diminished vii chord of F minor)\n    *   `Ebm6` (the minor chord built on the flatted seventh degree)\n    This chromatic descent in the bass or root of the chords (F -> E -> Eb) is a famous and highly recognizable characteristic of a specific song.\n*   **B Section (Measures 9-16, starting after the repeat):** This section, often called the bridge, modulates. We see the progression `Bbm7 | Eb7 | Abmaj7`. This is a classic `ii-V-I` progression resolving to Ab Major, which is the relative major key of F Minor. This type of modulation to the relative major is a very common feature in the bridges of minor-key standards.\n*   **A' Section (Last 8 bars):** The piece returns to the initial `Fm | Eø7 | Ebm6` progression, confirming the A-B-A form. The piece ends on an F major chord (indicated by the final `F` without a minus sign), which is a common \"Picardy third\" ending for a piece in a minor key.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Melody**\n*   The melody written on the page is composed of eighth-note lines and has a syncopated, improvisational feel.\n*   For example, in measure 4, the notes `C-B natural-C` over the `G7` chord use the leading tone to outline the harmony.\n*   This style suggests that the sheet music might be a transcription of a solo or a bebop-style arrangement of the tune, rather than the original, simpler vocal melody. In jazz, the underlying harmony is often the primary identifier of a standard.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Song**\n*   The chord progression, particularly the `Fm | Eø7 | Ebm...` opening, is the unmistakable hallmark of the jazz standard \"Yesterdays\".\n*   The A-B-A form with a bridge that modulates to the relative major is also consistent with the structure of \"Yesterdays\".\n*   The composer of \"Yesterdays\" is Jerome Kern, with lyrics originally written by Otto Harbach for the 1933 musical \"Roberta\".\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the unique and identifiable chord progression, the piece of music is the jazz standard \"Yesterdays\", composed by Jerome Kern.\n\n<<<Title: Yesterdays, Composer: Jerome Kern>>>"
