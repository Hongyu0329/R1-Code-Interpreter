    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Animal**\nThe image shows a small insect perched on a yellow flower. I need to carefully examine its physical characteristics to identify it.\n*   **Coloration:** The insect has a striking red-orange and black color pattern. This is a form of aposematism, or warning coloration, common in insects that are distasteful to predators.\n*   **Body Shape:** It has a somewhat flattened, shield-like or oval-shaped body, which is characteristic of the order Hemiptera, commonly known as \"true bugs.\"\n*   **Head:** The head is black with prominent, reddish compound eyes. It has a pair of long, black antennae.\n*   **Thorax:** The section directly behind the head (the pronotum) is bright red-orange.\n*   **Wings:** The wings appear mostly black. From this side view, we can see a patch of red-orange on the leathery part of the forewing (the hemelytron).\n*   **Legs:** The legs are black.\n*   **Host Plant:** The insect is on a cluster of small, bright yellow flowers. The structure of the inflorescence is characteristic of Goldenrod (*Solidago* species), a common plant in fields and meadows in late summer and autumn.\n\n**Step 2: Narrowing Down the Classification**\nBased on the features of a true bug (order Hemiptera), especially the body shape and piercing-sucking mouthparts (not visible but inferred), I can look into common families of red and black bugs.\n*   **Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*):** These bugs have a different pattern. They are mostly black with distinct red lines outlining the wings and thorax, rather than the solid blocks of color seen here.\n*   **Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*):** This bug is also orange and black, but its pattern is different. It typically has a broad black band across the middle of its orange wings and two black spots on the pronotum. The insect in the photo does not have this pattern.\n*   **Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus* species):** This group seems like a very strong match. Specifically, the Small Milkweed Bug, *Lygaeus kalmii*, has a black head, a red-orange band across the pronotum, a black triangular scutellum (the small triangle between the wing bases, partially visible), and black wings with a characteristic red \"X\" marking. Although we can't see the full \"X\" from this side angle, the visible red marking on the wing is consistent with part of the \"X\". The red-banded pronotum is a key feature that matches the image perfectly.\n\n**Step 3: Confirming the Identification**\nThe insect in the photograph exhibits the key identifying features of the Small Milkweed Bug:\n1.  Black head.\n2.  Red-orange transverse band on the pronotum.\n3.  Overall body shape and size.\n4.  Color pattern on the visible portion of the wing.\nWhile its common name is \"Small Milkweed Bug,\" it is frequently found on other plants, such as goldenrod, especially when seeking nectar. Therefore, its presence on this yellow flower is consistent with its known behavior.\n\n**Step 4: Providing the Scientific Name**\nThe scientific name for the Small Milkweed Bug is *Lygaeus kalmii*. It is a binomial name, consisting of the genus (*Lygaeus*) and the specific epithet (*kalmii*).\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe step-by-step analysis of the insect's morphology, coloration, and comparison with similar species leads to the confident identification of the animal as the Small Milkweed Bug. The question asks for the scientific name.\n\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"
