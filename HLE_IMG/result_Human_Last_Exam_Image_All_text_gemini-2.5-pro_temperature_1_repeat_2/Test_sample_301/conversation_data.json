    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each artwork to determine its author.\n\n**1. Top-Left Artwork**\n*   **Analysis:** This painting depicts four whimsical, cartoon-like fish and a fishhook. The style is playful and satirical, characterized by simple lines and a unique, modern interpretation of traditional ink wash. The fish with a human-like face is particularly distinctive. This style is the hallmark of **Liao Bingxiong (廖冰兄)**, a famous Chinese cartoonist and ink painter known for his satirical works. This specific piece is titled \"Self-deprecation\" (自嘲).\n*   **Author:** Liao Bingxiong\n\n**2. Top-Center Artwork**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a traditional Chinese ink wash painting (水墨画) of chrysanthemums next to a rock. The brushwork is bold, vigorous, and confident, a style known as \"xieyi\" (写意, or freehand). In the upper right corner, a red seal and a signature are visible. The signature reads \"吴昌硕\" (Wú Chāngshuò). **Wu Changshuo (吴昌硕)** was a master of the late Qing Dynasty and is renowned for his paintings of flowers and plants in this powerful style.\n*   **Author:** Wu Changshuo\n\n**3. Top-Right Artwork**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a highly realistic portrait of an elderly woman, likely from a Chinese ethnic minority, given her attire. The technique showcases a mastery of form, light, and texture, characteristic of Western academic oil painting. This specific style, which blends classical realism with Chinese subjects, is synonymous with **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**, a pivotal figure in modern Chinese oil painting.\n*   **Author:** Jin Shangyi\n\n**4. Middle-Left Artwork**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in a very dynamic and fluid Cursive Script (草書). The characters are energetic and interconnected. This is a section of the famous calligraphic work \"Poem on Brushing the Wall\" (刷字序). The unique style, with its dramatic variations in brush pressure and speed, is unmistakably that of **Mi Fu (米芾)**, one of the four great masters of calligraphy from the Song Dynasty.\n*   **Author:** Mi Fu\n\n**5. Middle-Center Artwork**\n*   **Analysis:** This work is a modern painting that combines abstract elements with traditional Chinese ink techniques. It features two large circles, one red and one orange, resembling a sun and moon, set above an abstract landscape. This fusion of Chinese tradition with Western modernism, particularly the focus on cosmic themes like the sun and moon, is the signature style of **Liu Guosong (劉國松)**, a key pioneer of modern Chinese ink painting.\n*   **Author:** Liu Guosong\n\n**6. Middle-Right Artwork**\n*   **Analysis:** This image shows a piece of calligraphy in the elegant and precise Regular Script (楷書). The text itself mentions the calligrapher's name: \"褚遂良書\" (written by Chu Suiliang). This is a rubbing of the \"Preface to the Sacred Teachings of the Wild Goose Pagoda\" (雁塔聖教序). **Chu Suiliang (褚遂良)** was a celebrated calligrapher of the early Tang Dynasty, known for his graceful and slender brushstrokes.\n*   **Author:** Chu Suiliang\n\n**7. Bottom-Left Artwork**\n*   **Analysis:** This is the most famous work in the history of Chinese calligraphy, the \"Preface to the Poems Collected from the Orchid Pavilion\" (蘭亭集序). It is executed in a masterful Running Script (行書). While the original work was lost, several faithful copies from the Tang Dynasty exist. The one pictured is the most revered copy, the \"Shenlong\" (神龍本) version. The original author and calligrapher of this masterpiece is **Wang Xizhi (王羲之)**, the \"Sage of Calligraphy\" from the Eastern Jin Dynasty.\n*   **Author:** Wang Xizhi\n\n**8. Bottom-Center Artwork**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a hyper-realistic oil portrait of a young woman with a pensive expression, set against a background of dark leaves. The meticulous detail, smooth application of paint, and serene, classical mood are characteristic of the artist **Yang Feiyun (杨飞云)**, a leading figure in the Chinese Neoclassical painting movement. This is one of his most famous works, often titled \"Still Water Runs Deep\" or \"The Girl in the North\".\n*   **Author:** Yang Feiyun\n\n**9. Bottom-Right Artwork**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a contemporary painting of a woman in elaborate costume and jewelry, likely depicting a dancer or a woman from a Central Asian or Indian culture. The style is a modern interpretation of the traditional \"gongbi\" (工笔, or fine-line) technique, characterized by precise outlines and delicate application of color, blended with a strong sense of realism. The signature in the lower left corner reads \"家英\" (Jiaying). This is the distinctive style of **He Jiaying (何家英)**, a contemporary master of gongbi figure painting.\n*   **Author:** He Jiaying\n\nBased on the analysis, the authors of the nine works from left to right, top to bottom are:\n\n1.  Liao Bingxiong\n2.  Wu Changshuo\n3.  Jin Shangyi\n4.  Mi Fu\n5.  Liu Guosong\n6.  Chu Suiliang\n7.  Wang Xizhi\n8.  Yang Feiyun\n9.  He Jiaying\n\n<<<Liao Bingxiong, Wu Changshuo, Jin Shangyi, Mi Fu, Liu Guosong, Chu Suiliang, Wang Xizhi, Yang Feiyun, He Jiaying>>>"
