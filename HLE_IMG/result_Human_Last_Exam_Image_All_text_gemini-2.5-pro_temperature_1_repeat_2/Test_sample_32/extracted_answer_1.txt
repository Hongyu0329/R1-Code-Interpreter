The main difference is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, causing the capsule to be immersed or emergent from the leaves. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is long and strongly curved (cygneous or S-shaped), holding the capsule well above the leaves in a distinct arc.
