    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question and the relevant terminology.**\nThe question asks for the main difference in the **sporophyte** that distinguishes *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta* \"at a glance\".\n*   **Sporophyte:** In mosses, this is the spore-producing generation. It consists of a foot, a **seta** (stalk), and a **capsule** (which contains the spores).\n*   **At a glance:** This implies a feature that is macroscopic and easily observable without detailed microscopic examination.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the name *Grimmia curviseta*.**\nThe specific epithet *curviseta* is a significant clue. It is derived from Latin:\n*   *curvus* meaning \"curved\"\n*   *seta* referring to the stalk that supports the moss capsule.\nThis name strongly suggests that a curved seta is a defining characteristic of this species.\n\n**Step 3: Examine the sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta*.**\nBotanical descriptions confirm that *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by its sporophyte having a **long, strongly curved or S-shaped (cygneous) seta**. This distinctive \"swan's neck\" seta holds the capsule well above the leaves in a noticeable arc.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the sporophyte of *Grimmia montana*.**\nIn contrast, *Grimmia montana* has a **very short and straight seta**. Because the seta is so short, the capsule is not held up high. Instead, it remains **immersed** (hidden among) or **emergent** (peeking out from) the perichaetial leaves (the special leaves at the top of the stem). The image provided, showing capsules nestled within the plant mat on what appear to be very short, straight stalks, is characteristic of *Grimmia montana* or a similar species with immersed capsules.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the two species to find the main difference.**\nBy comparing the two descriptions, the most striking and easily observable difference in the sporophyte is the nature of the seta:\n*   ***Grimmia montana***: The seta is **short and straight**, resulting in an immersed or emergent capsule.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta***: The seta is **long and strongly curved**, resulting in an exserted capsule held away from the plant on an arching stalk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe length and curvature of the seta is the main difference in the sporophyte that allows for distinguishing between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance.\n\n<<<The main difference is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, causing the capsule to be immersed or emergent from the leaves. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is long and strongly curved (cygneous or S-shaped), holding the capsule well above the leaves in a distinct arc.>>>"
