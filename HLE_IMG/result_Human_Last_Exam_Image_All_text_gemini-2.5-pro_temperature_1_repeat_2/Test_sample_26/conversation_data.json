    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Musical Context**\n*   **Piece:** Ludwig van Beethoven, Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor, Op. 13 (\"Pathétique\"), 1st movement.\n*   **Location:** Measure 30. Looking at the score, measure numbers are provided at the start of each line. The line in question begins with measure 28, so measure 30 is the third measure on that line.\n*   **Key Signature:** The key signature is three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). The overall key of the movement is C minor.\n*   **Time Signature:** The time signature is Alla Breve (2/2), meaning there are two half-note beats per measure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Notes in Measure 30**\nWe need to identify all the notes played in both the right and left hands to determine the harmony.\n\n*   **Beat 1 (First half of the measure):**\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** Plays four sixteenth notes: G4, B♭4, D5, F5.\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** Plays an eighth-note chord of G2 and B♭2.\n    *   **Combined Notes for Beat 1:** G, B♭, D, F. These notes form a **G minor seventh chord (Gm7)**.\n\n*   **Beat 2 (Second half of the measure):**\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** Plays four sixteenth notes: F♯5, A5, C6, E♭6.\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** Plays an eighth-note chord of D3 and F♯3.\n    *   **Combined Notes for Beat 2:** D, F♯, A, C, E♭. When stacked in thirds from the root D, this forms a **D dominant seventh chord with a flatted ninth (D7(b9))**.\n\n**Step 3: Roman Numeral Analysis in the Key of C minor**\nNow we place these chords within the context of the home key, C minor.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Chord on Beat 1 (Gm7):**\n    *   The root of the chord is G, which is the 5th degree of the C minor scale. The dominant note in C minor is G.\n    *   The chord built on G is a minor triad (G-B♭-D) with a minor seventh (F). In Roman numeral analysis, a minor chord on the dominant is represented by a lowercase numeral, **v**.\n    *   With the seventh, the full Roman numeral is **v7**.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Chord on Beat 2 (D7(b9)):**\n    *   This chord is not diatonic to C minor because of the F♯.\n    *   The F♯ is the leading tone to G. The D major triad (D-F♯-A) is the dominant chord of G.\n    *   This means the D7(b9) chord is functioning as the dominant of G. In harmonic analysis, this is called a **secondary dominant**.\n    *   The G minor chord is the dominant (v) of C minor. Therefore, the D7(b9) chord is the \"dominant of the dominant\".\n    *   This is written as **V/v**. The 'V' is uppercase because the chord's quality is major (due to the major third, F♯).\n    *   To be more precise, we include the seventh and the altered ninth: **V7(b9)/v**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Roman Numeral for the Entire Measure**\nMeasure 30 contains two different harmonies: v7 on beat 1 and V7(b9)/v on beat 2. When asked for a single Roman numeral for a measure that contains a clear harmonic progression, it's best to identify the most functionally significant harmony.\n\n*   The progression within the measure is from v7 to V7(b9)/v.\n*   This progression strongly prepares the arrival of the G minor chord in measure 31, which is the new temporary tonic.\n*   The **V7(b9)/v** is the active chord that creates the harmonic tension and drives the music forward to its resolution in the next measure. The v7 chord on beat 1 serves to introduce the G minor sonority before it is confirmed by its own dominant.\n*   Therefore, the most accurate and functionally descriptive Roman numeral for measure 30 is the one representing the secondary dominant.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation**\nThe harmony in measure 30 is a secondary dominant chord that tonicizes the key of the dominant (G minor). The chord is a D dominant 7th with a flatted 9th, which functions as the dominant of G minor. In the home key of C minor, G minor is the v chord. Thus, the correct Roman numeral is V7(b9)/v.\n\n<<<V7(b9)/v>>>"
