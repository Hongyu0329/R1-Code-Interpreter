    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the runestone in the image:\n\n1.  **Analyze the visual characteristics:** The image shows a fragment of a runestone. The most distinctive feature is the style of the carving. The runes are neatly arranged in horizontal bands, separated by deeply incised parallel lines. This is a relatively uncommon style compared to the more typical runic inscriptions that follow the shape of a serpent or dragon.\n\n2.  **Transliterate the visible runes:** To identify the specific stone, we can attempt to read the runes, which are from the Younger Futhark alphabet. We can analyze the visible text row by row.\n    *   **Top Row:** The runes appear to read `...ᚦᚱ : ᛚᛁᛏ : ᚴᛁᛅ...` (`...þr : lit : kia...`). This transliterates to a fragment of Old Norse, likely part of `[Hærmo]ðr let giæra` meaning \"[Hermóðr] had made...\".\n    *   **Middle Row:** The runes appear to read `...ᚱ : ᛋᚢᛁᚾ : ᚠᛅ...` (`...r : suin : fa...`). This transliterates to a fragment `[æfti]R Svæin, fa[ður]` meaning \"...in memory of Sveinn, [his] fa[ther]\".\n    *   **Bottom Row:** The runes appear to read `...ᚦᚱ : ᛅᚢᛋᛏᚱ * ᛁ...` (`...þr : austr * i...`). This transliterates to a fragment `[dau]ðr austr i` meaning \"...died in the east in...\".\n\n3.  **Identify the runestone using the inscription and style:** The combination of the unique horizontal band style and the specific text fragments (`...let giæra...`, `...Svæin...`, `...austr...`) allows for a definitive identification. These features perfectly match the **Sannersta Runestone**.\n\n4.  **Determine the runestone's ID:** The Sannersta Runestone is cataloged in the Rundata database, which is the standard scholarly inventory of runic inscriptions. Its official designation is **Sö 319**. The \"Sö\" stands for Södermanland, the province in Sweden where the stone is located.\n\n5.  **Address the term \"Ingvar runestone\":** The question identifies the stone as an \"Ingvar runestone\". This is a specific category of about 26 runestones related to Ingvar the Far-Travelled's disastrous expedition to the Caspian Sea (Serkland) around 1041 AD. However, the inscription on Sö 319 states that the man, Sveinn, died \"in the east in Greece\" (`austr i Grikklandi`). Therefore, Sö 319 is technically classified as a \"Greece runestone,\" not an Ingvar runestone. The use of \"Ingvar runestone\" in the question is a common imprecision, as these stones are all from the same Viking Age period and commemorate eastern voyages (they are all Varangian Runestones). Despite this slight misclassification in the prompt, the visual evidence in the image unequivocally points to Sö 319. The task is to identify the stone *depicted*, and that stone is Sö 319.\n\nBased on this analysis, the ID of the runestone shown in the image fragment is Sö 319.\n\n<<<Sö 319>>>"
