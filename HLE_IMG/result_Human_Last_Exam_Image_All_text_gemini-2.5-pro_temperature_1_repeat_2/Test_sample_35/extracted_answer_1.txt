The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the V-domain of the RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts) receptor. S100B could be used as a prognostic marker. This is because, as shown in the pathway, its overexpression leads to the activation of downstream signaling (JNK/JUN and NFκβ) that directly results in key pathological events like apoptosis, neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. The level of S100B would therefore correlate with the severity and progression of the disease, allowing clinicians to predict the patient's future clinical outcome, which is the primary function of a prognostic marker.
