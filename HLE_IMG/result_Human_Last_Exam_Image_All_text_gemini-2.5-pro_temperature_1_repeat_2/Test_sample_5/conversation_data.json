    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the fundamental musical characteristics.**\n*   **Instrumentation:** The music is written for piano, indicated by the grand staff (treble and bass clefs braced together).\n*   **Key Signature:** There is one sharp (F#) in the key signature. This suggests the key is either G major or E minor.\n*   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4, also known as common time.\n*   **Tempo:** The tempo is marked as a quarter note equals 80 beats per minute (â™© = 80), which is a moderate tempo (Andante).\n\n**Step 2: Examine the melodic and harmonic content.**\n*   **Measures 1-2:** The piece begins with a very famous melodic phrase in the right hand: G-A-B-C-D-C-B-A. The left hand accompanies with a simple G major chord. This melody is instantly recognizable as the main theme from the first movement of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 16 in C major, K. 545, often called the \"Sonata Facile\" (Easy Sonata). However, in this version, it has been transposed up a perfect fifth from C major to G major. The dynamic is soft (p - piano).\n*   **Measure 3:** There is a sudden and dramatic shift. The dynamic changes to loud (f - forte), and the texture becomes much thicker with powerful, blocky chords in both hands. This is a significant departure from the delicate Alberti bass and scale passage in Mozart's original.\n*   **Measures 4-5:** The dynamic softens to mezzo-piano (mp). The right hand plays chords while the left hand plays wide-ranging broken chords in a steady sixteenth-note rhythm. This texture is also much more complex and dense than Mozart's original Alberti bass.\n*   **Measures 8-10:** The dynamic increases to mezzo-forte (mf). The texture continues with full chords in both hands, creating a powerful, driving rhythm.\n*   **Measure 11:** This measure features a very fast, upward-rushing arpeggio, almost like a written-out glissando, leading into the next section. This kind of virtuosic flourish is typical of modern arrangements and transcriptions.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the observations and identify the piece.**\n*   The piece is clearly a modern, virtuosic arrangement or fantasy on Mozart's Piano Sonata K. 545.\n*   The style, characterized by extreme dynamic contrasts, thick chordal textures, driving rhythms, and virtuosic passages, is highly characteristic of music found in rhythm video games.\n*   This specific arrangement, which transposes Mozart's theme to G major and reworks it into a dramatic, high-energy piece, is well-known in the rhythm game community.\n*   The piece is titled \"L\" (or \"Chapter L\"), composed by the artist Ice. It is a famous and notoriously difficult track featured in the popular rhythm games *Cytus* and *Deemo*. The name \"L\" is an ironic reference to the German word \"Leicht\" (easy), a nod to the nickname of Mozart's original sonata.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe music is a transcription of the song \"L\" by Ice, which is a modern arrangement of Mozart's Piano Sonata K. 545.\n\n<<<L by Ice>>>"
