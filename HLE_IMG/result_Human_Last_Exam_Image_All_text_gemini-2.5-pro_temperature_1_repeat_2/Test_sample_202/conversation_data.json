    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens.\n\n**Analysis of the Specimens**\n\nTo identify the rocks, we will examine their key characteristics, such as texture (crystal size, presence of pores, or fragments) and color (which can indicate mineral composition).\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Specimen H**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a very porous, sponge-like appearance. The holes, or vesicles, indicate that gas was trapped in the rock as it cooled. The overall rock is fine-grained (aphanitic), meaning individual crystals are not visible.\n*   **Interpretation:** The vesicular texture is characteristic of an extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock, which cooled rapidly at the Earth's surface. The reddish color is often due to the oxidation of iron. A highly vesicular, mafic to intermediate volcanic rock is known as scoria.\n*   **Identification:** Specimen H is **Scoria**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Specimen I**\n*   **Observation:** This specimen is composed of numerous smaller, sharp-edged, angular rock fragments (clasts) that have been cemented together. The clasts are of various sizes and colors, embedded in a fine-grained matrix.\n*   **Interpretation:** A rock made of angular fragments cemented together is called a breccia. This can be a sedimentary rock formed from landslide debris or a volcanic rock (volcanic breccia) formed from an explosive eruption. The defining characteristic is the angularity of the clasts.\n*   **Identification:** Specimen I is **Breccia**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Specimen J**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is light-colored (white to light gray) and, like specimen H, is filled with vesicles (pores). It appears to be low in density. The texture is fine-grained (aphanitic).\n*   **Interpretation:** The light color suggests a felsic composition (rich in silica). A highly vesicular, low-density, felsic volcanic rock is known as pumice. It forms from frothy, gas-rich lava. While both pumice and scoria are vesicular, pumice is typically lighter in color and density than scoria.\n*   **Identification:** Specimen J is **Pumice**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Specimen K**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are clearly visible to the naked eye. This coarse-grained texture is known as phaneritic. The crystals are a mix of light-colored minerals (likely white/pink feldspar and gray quartz) and some darker minerals (like biotite or hornblende).\n*   **Interpretation:** The phaneritic (coarse-grained) texture indicates the rock cooled slowly deep underground, allowing large crystals time to grow. This is characteristic of an intrusive igneous rock. A light-colored, coarse-grained intrusive rock composed primarily of quartz and feldspar is granite.\n*   **Identification:** Specimen K is **Granite**.\n\n**Summary of Identifications**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Granite\n\n<<<H is Scoria, I is Breccia, J is Pumice, and K is Granite.>>>"
