    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the RT-PCR results to determine the total number of splice species.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe goal is to identify and count every unique messenger RNA (mRNA) splice variant, referred to as a \"splice species,\" that is detected by the various RT-PCR experiments shown in panels B through I.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   Each band on a gel represents a PCR product from a specific mRNA template.\n*   Multiple bands in one lane for a single primer pair indicate multiple splice species that share those primer binding sites but differ in the sequence between them (due to alternative splicing).\n*   A new splice species is identified if it has a unique size for a given primer pair or if it's detected by a primer pair that targets a different region or a specific splice junction not present in other species.\n*   Primers E1F2 and E1F3 are \"splice-junction\" primers, meaning they will only amplify a product if a specific splicing event (929^3465 for E1F2, 929^3506 for E1F3) has occurred.\n*   The location of the primers is critical. Products ending in E4R/E5R are \"early\" transcripts, while those extending to L2R/L1R are \"late\" transcripts. These are generally different classes of mRNA.\n*   Panel I is a more sensitive amplification than Panel H, revealing low-abundance species that might be missed otherwise. We should use the results from the most sensitive experiment (Panel I) for the E1F1/L1R primer pair.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analysis of Early Transcripts (Panels B, C, D):**\n    *   **Panel B (E1F1/E4R):** Two bands are visible (band 1: 190 bp; band 2: 159 bp). This indicates the presence of **2 distinct splice species**.\n    *   **Panel C (E1F1/E5R):** Two bands are also visible (band 1: 584 bp; band 2: 553 bp). These are consistent with the two species from panel B, just amplified over a longer region. This confirms the two species but does not add new ones.\n    *   **Panel D (E1F2/E5R):** This uses a primer specific for the 929^3465 splice. It detects one band (551 bp), which corresponds to band 2 from Panel C. This characterizes one of the two species but doesn't add to the count.\n    *   **Conclusion from B, C, D:** There are **2** unique early splice species.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Late Transcripts with 929^3465 Splice (Panels E, F):**\n    *   **Panel E (E1F1/L2R):** One band is detected (1,005 bp). Since this transcript extends into the late region (detected with primer L2R), it is distinct from the early transcripts identified above. This is a **new, 3rd splice species**.\n    *   **Panel F (E1F2/L2R):** This confirms that the 3rd species contains the 929^3465 splice junction. It does not add a new species.\n    *   **Conclusion from E, F:** There is **1** new splice species identified.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Late Transcripts with 929^3506 Splice (Panel G):**\n    *   **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** This uses a primer (E1F3) specific for a different splice junction (929^3506). It reveals two distinct bands (band 1: 1,003 bp; band 2: 931 bp). Since these species are defined by a different splice site than any species identified so far, they represent **2 new splice species**.\n    *   **Conclusion from G:** There are **2** new splice species identified.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Late Transcripts extending to L1 (Panels H, I):**\n    *   **Panel H (E1F1/L1R):** Shows two bands (450 bp and 419 bp).\n    *   **Panel I (E1F1/L1R, higher cycles):** This more sensitive assay reveals four distinct bands: 450 bp, 419 bp, 378 bp, and 187 bp. These transcripts are detected with the L1R primer, which is downstream of the L2R primer. The fact that these products are significantly shorter than those in panels E and G indicates that a major splicing event has removed the region containing the L2R primer binding site. Therefore, all four of these bands represent unique splice species distinct from all others previously identified.\n    *   **Conclusion from H, I:** There are **4** new splice species identified.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nTo find the total number of unique splice species, we sum the new species identified in each distinct analysis group:\n*   From early transcript analysis (Panel B): 2 species\n*   From late transcript analysis, type 1 (Panel E): 1 species\n*   From late transcript analysis, type 2 (Panel G): 2 species\n*   From late transcript analysis, type 3 (Panel I): 4 species\n\nTotal = 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 9\n\nThere are a total of 9 different splice species detected in this set of experiments.\n\n<<<9>>>"
