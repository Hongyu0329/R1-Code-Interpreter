    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork:\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the image's medium and style:** The image displays a relief sculpture, which appears to be made of glazed terracotta (terracotta invetriata). The style is characteristic of the Italian High Renaissance, specifically from Florence. This technique and style are strongly associated with a particular family of artists.\n2.  **Identify the subject matter:** The scene depicts a religious ceremony. A priest is giving what appears to be Holy Communion (the Eucharist) to several kneeling figures, including a young child. This is a Catholic sacrament.\n3.  **Examine the inscription:** At the bottom of the circular relief (tondo), there is a cartouche with an inscription. It reads \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This is an older form of Italian/French that translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" confirming the subject is the Eucharist.\n4.  **Connect the clues:** A glazed terracotta relief depicting a sacrament, with this specific Renaissance style, points directly to the workshop of the Della Robbia family. The most prominent members were Luca, Andrea, and Giovanni della Robbia.\n5.  **Research the specific artwork:** Searching for \"Della Robbia Sacramenti de l'autel\" or \"Della Robbia altarpiece of the sacraments\" leads to a specific work. This tondo is a detail from the \"Altarpiece of the Seven Sacraments,\" also known as the Fontévrault Altarpiece.\n6.  **Identify the author:** Art historical sources attribute this major altarpiece, created around 1524, to **Giovanni della Robbia** (1469–1529), the son of Andrea della Robbia. The altarpiece was originally made for the church of Saint-Jean-de-l'Habit in France.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   The medium (glazed terracotta) is a primary clue that immediately narrows the search to the Della Robbia workshop.\n*   The inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\" is a specific identifier for this panel within the larger altarpiece.\n*   It is important to distinguish between the members of the Della Robbia family. While Luca founded the workshop and Andrea expanded it, Giovanni developed his own style, often more colorful and complex, which is consistent with this work.\n*   The question correctly refers to the image as a \"detail of the Altarpiece,\" as this tondo is one of seven representing the sacraments on the complete work.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe author of this detail of the altarpiece is Giovanni della Robbia.\n\n<<<Giovanni della Robbia>>>"
