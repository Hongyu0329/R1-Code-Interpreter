    "*   **Step 1: Image Analysis**\n    *   The image consists of two graphs plotted against a horizontal time axis.\n    *   The top graph is a spectrogram, which shows the intensity of different frequencies over time. It depicts a strong horizontal band at a specific frequency, indicating a pure tone. This band is interrupted in the middle by a vertical smudge, which represents a burst of sound across a wide range of frequencies (i.e., noise). After the noise, the pure tone's band continues. This shows that physically, the tone stops, is replaced by noise, and then resumes.\n    *   The bottom graph is a waveform, showing the amplitude of the sound over time. It starts as a regular, periodic sine wave, corresponding to the pure tone. In the middle, the waveform becomes irregular and chaotic, corresponding to the noise burst. After the interruption, it returns to being a regular sine wave. This confirms the physical reality depicted in the spectrogram.\n\n*   **Step 2: Textual Analysis**\n    *   The question asks for the name of a specific \"phenomenon\" which is an \"illusion\".\n    *   This illusion is compared to the Necker Cube's \"bistable ambiguity\". The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where a 2D drawing of a cube can be perceived in two different 3D orientations. This comparison suggests that the auditory phenomenon in question involves the brain actively interpreting ambiguous or incomplete sensory information to construct a coherent perception.\n    *   The phenomenon is described as a \"surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability.\" This points to a fundamental cognitive process that we use frequently in everyday life without being aware of it.\n\n*   **Step 3: Synthesis and Interpretation**\n    *   The stimulus shown in the image (a tone interrupted by noise) is known to produce an auditory illusion. When a person listens to this stimulus, they typically do not perceive a tone, then noise, then the tone again. Instead, they perceive the tone as continuing *uninterrupted* \"behind\" the noise.\n    *   The brain effectively \"fills in\" the missing segment of the tone, creating a perception of continuity. This is a form of perceptual restoration.\n    *   This \"filling-in\" mechanism is a crucial ability for perceiving the world. For example, in a noisy room, we can still follow a conversation because our brain perceptually restores parts of speech that are masked by other sounds (e.g., a cough, a door slam, other conversations).\n    *   The specific case of restoring missing speech sounds is called the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**. It was discovered by Richard Warren in 1970. This effect is an excellent example of a \"common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\" that allows for robust speech comprehension in non-ideal conditions.\n    *   While the general principle is called the \"auditory continuity illusion,\" the phonemic restoration effect is the most famous and ecologically significant example. The question's wording, especially the reference to a \"common... perceptual ability,\" strongly points to this specific application in speech. The image uses a simple tone as a clear, simplified illustration of the underlying mechanism that enables phonemic restoration.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclusion**\n    *   The image illustrates the stimulus for an auditory illusion where the brain perceptually restores a sound that is physically interrupted by noise.\n    *   The description of this as a common, unconscious ability strongly connects it to the real-world application of understanding speech in noisy environments.\n    *   Therefore, the name of the phenomenon being referred to is the Phonemic Restoration Effect.\n\n<<<Phonemic restoration effect>>>"
