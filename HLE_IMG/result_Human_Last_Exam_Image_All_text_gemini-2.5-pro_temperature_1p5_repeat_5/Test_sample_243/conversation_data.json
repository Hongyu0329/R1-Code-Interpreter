    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the island where the plant is endemic:\n\n1.  **Analyze the image to identify the plant.**\n    *   The image shows a plant with distinctive leaves. The leaves are simple, elliptical to ovate in shape, with a glossy, dark green surface.\n    *   The most striking feature is the venation. There is a prominent network of light-colored (white or pale green) veins that stand out against the dark green leaf blade, creating a reticulated or mosaic-like pattern.\n    *   The plant appears to be a woody shrub or a small tree, as suggested by the thickness of the stems and the leathery texture of the leaves. The leaves are clustered at the ends of the shoots.\n\n2.  **Identify the plant species.**\n    *   The unique leaf pattern is a strong clue. Several plants have reticulated leaves, but this specific appearance is characteristic of a very rare plant known as *Pennantia baylisiana*.\n    *   *Pennantia baylisiana*, also known as the Three Kings Kaikōmako, is famous for its rarity and its distinctive foliage, which matches the plant in the photograph perfectly.\n\n3.  **Research the endemic location of *Pennantia baylisiana*.**\n    *   The common name \"Three Kings Kaikōmako\" already provides a major hint. The plant is endemic to the Three Kings Islands (Manawatāwhi), an archipelago located about 55 kilometers (34 miles) off the northern coast of New Zealand's North Island.\n    *   The species has a remarkable history. For many years, only a single female tree was known to exist in the wild. This tree was discovered in 1945.\n\n4.  **Address the specific phrasing of the question.**\n    *   The question asks for \"the name of the island\" (singular), not the island group.\n    *   While the plant is endemic to the Three Kings Islands archipelago, the single known wild specimen was found, and still resides, on one specific island within that group.\n    *   Research confirms that this sole wild tree is located on **Great Island** (the largest island in the Three Kings group, also known by its Māori name, Manawatāwhi). The rest of the population on the surrounding islands is believed to have been wiped out by goats, which were later eradicated from Great Island.\n\n5.  **Conclusion.**\n    *   Based on the identification of the plant as *Pennantia baylisiana* and its unique natural history, the specific island to which it was (and is) endemic is Great Island. The singular form \"island\" in the question points to this specific location rather than the plural \"Three Kings Islands\".\n\n<<<Great Island>>>"
