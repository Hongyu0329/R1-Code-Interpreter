    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe goal is to calculate the percentage reduction in Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) specifically for cars, by comparing the 'Baseline' scenario in Table 1 to the 'Proposed' scenario in Table 2.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **VMT Calculation:** VMT is calculated by multiplying the number of trips by the distance of those trips. Since we have different categories of trip distances and mode shares, we must calculate a weighted total VMT for each scenario.\n2.  **Working with Percentages:** The tables provide percentages, not absolute numbers. We can calculate a representative VMT index for each scenario by assuming a total number of trips (e.g., 100 trips) or by working directly with the shares as proportions. The absolute number of trips is not needed because it will cancel out when calculating the percentage change.\n3.  **Car VMT:** The question specifies \"Car VMT\". This means we must include both categories of car travel: 'car, 1 occupant' and 'car, with more than 2 occupants'. We need to sum their mode shares for each distance category.\n4.  **Data Usage:** We will use the 'share of total trips' to weight each distance category, the sum of 'car' mode shares within each category, and the 'average trip distance' for each category.\n5.  **Irrelevant Data:** The 'Average Carpool Occupancy' figures (2.8 and 3) are not required for this calculation. VMT measures the miles traveled by a *vehicle*, not the number of people in it. The change in the number of carpool trips is already accounted for in the change in mode share percentages.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the representative Car VMT for the Baseline Scenario (Table 1)**\n\nWe'll calculate a VMT index for each distance category and sum them up. The formula for each category's contribution is:\n`(Share of Total Trips) x (Total Car Mode Share) x (Average Trip Distance)`\n\n*   **0-3 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 25% + 28% = 53%\n    *   VMT Index = 0.48 (share of trips) * 0.53 (car share) * 1 (miles) = **0.2544**\n*   **3-5 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   VMT Index = 0.22 * 0.81 * 4 = **0.7128**\n*   **5-10 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   VMT Index = 0.14 * 0.85 * 7.5 = **0.8925**\n*   **10+ miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   VMT Index = 0.16 * 0.89 * 20 = **2.8480**\n\n*   **Total Baseline VMT Index:**\n    *   `VMT_Baseline` = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the representative Car VMT for the Proposed Scenario (Table 2)**\n\nWe repeat the same calculation using the data from Table 2.\n\n*   **0-3 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   VMT Index = 0.48 (share of trips) * 0.03 (car share) * 1 (miles) = **0.0144**\n*   **3-5 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   VMT Index = 0.22 * 0.27 * 4 = **0.2376**\n*   **5-10 miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   VMT Index = 0.14 * 0.41 * 7.5 = **0.4305**\n*   **10+ miles category:**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   VMT Index = 0.16 * 0.49 * 20 = **1.5680**\n\n*   **Total Proposed VMT Index:**\n    *   `VMT_Proposed` = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction in Car VMT**\n\nThe formula for percentage reduction is: `((Initial Value - Final Value) / Initial Value) * 100%`\n\n*   **VMT Reduction (difference in index values):**\n    *   `Reduction` = `VMT_Baseline` - `VMT_Proposed` = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = **2.4572**\n*   **Percentage Reduction:**\n    *   `% Reduction` = (`Reduction` / `VMT_Baseline`) * 100%\n    *   `% Reduction` = (2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100% = 0.52195... * 100%\n    *   `% Reduction` â‰ˆ **52.2%**\n\nBy changing the composition of mode share, the Car VMT can be reduced by approximately 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
