    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given sorting algorithm's time complexity.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algorithm's Logic\n\nThe algorithm is a recursive function `sort(a, n)` that aims to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`. Let's break down the code:\n\n1.  `def sort(a, n):`\n    *   Defines a function `sort` taking an array `a` and an integer `n` as input.\n\n2.  `if n > 1:`\n    *   This is the base case for the recursion. If `n` is 1 or less, the array (or sub-array) is considered sorted, and the function does nothing.\n\n3.  `sort(a, n - 1)`\n    *   This is the first recursive call. It attempts to sort the prefix of the array of size `n-1`, which is `a[0...n-2]`.\n\n4.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:`\n    *   After the first recursive call returns, it compares the last element of the current sub-array, `a[n-1]`, with the second to last element, `a[n-2]`.\n\n5.  `swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`\n    *   If the condition is true (the elements are out of order), it swaps them. This block is executed only if `a[n-1]` is smaller than `a[n-2]`.\n\n6.  `sort(a, n - 1)`\n    *   This is the second recursive call. **Crucially, this call is inside the `if` block.** It is only executed if the swap happened. The swap might have disrupted the sorted order of the `a[0...n-2]` prefix, so this call is needed to re-sort it.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Recurrence Relation\n\nTo find the time complexity, we express the running time `T(n)` for an input of size `n` as a recurrence relation.\n\n*   **Base Case:** If `n <= 1`, the function takes constant time. `T(1) = O(1)`.\n*   **Recursive Step:** For `n > 1`, the function always makes the first recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)`, which takes `T(n-1)` time.\n*   Then, it performs a comparison and potentially a swap, which takes constant time, `O(1)`.\n*   The second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` is conditional. To find the **worst-case** complexity, we must assume a scenario where this second call is always made.\n\nThe recurrence relation for the worst case is:\n`T(n) = T(n - 1) (first call) + O(1) (comparison/swap) + T(n - 1) (second call)`\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant for the `O(1)` operations)\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Worst-Case Input\n\nWe need to confirm that an input exists which triggers the `if` condition at every level of recursion.\nThe condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is checked *after* the first `sort(a, n - 1)` call has completed. Let's assume (and it can be proven by induction) that `sort(a, k)` correctly sorts the prefix `a[0...k-1]`.\n\nConsider a **reverse-sorted array**, e.g., `a = [n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1]`.\n\nLet's analyze the call `sort(a, n)` on this array.\n1.  The first call is `sort(a, n - 1)`. Based on our assumption, this will sort the prefix `a[0...n-2]`. The original prefix was `[n, n-1, ..., 2]`, which will become `[2, 3, ..., n]`. The entire array `a` will now be `[2, 3, ..., n, 1]`.\n2.  Now, the condition `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is checked. This translates to `if 1 < n`.\n3.  For any `n > 1`, this condition is true.\n4.  Therefore, the swap occurs, and the second `sort(a, n - 1)` call is made.\n\nThis confirms that a reverse-sorted array constitutes a worst-case scenario, as it forces the second recursive call at every step of the recursion for `n > 1`.\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Recurrence Relation\n\nWe need to solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` with the base case `T(1) = c'`.\n\nLet's expand the relation:\n*   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n*   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c = 2^2 * T(n - 2) + (2^1 + 2^0)c`\n*   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 3c = 2^3 * T(n - 3) + (2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0)c`\n\nA clear pattern emerges. After `k` expansions:\n`T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^0) * c`\n\nWe expand until we reach the base case `T(1)`. This happens when `n - k = 1`, so `k = n - 1`.\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-2) + ... + 2^0) * c`\n\nThe term `(2^(n-2) + ... + 2^0)` is a geometric series sum, which equals `(2^(n-1) - 1) / (2 - 1) = 2^(n-1) - 1`.\n\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c' + (2^(n-1) - 1) * c`\n`T(n) = c' * 2^(n-1) + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n`T(n) = (c' + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\nThe dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`. In Big O notation, constants and lower-order terms are ignored.\n\nTherefore, `T(n) = O(2^(n-1))`, which simplifies to `O(2^n)`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe worst-case time complexity of this algorithm is exponential.\n\n*   A. O(n) is incorrect (this is the best case for a sorted array).\n*   B. O(n log n) is incorrect.\n*   C. O(n^2) is incorrect.\n*   D. O(n^3) is incorrect.\n*   E. O(2^n) is correct.\n*   F. \"does not terminate\" is incorrect, as `n` decreases with each call, eventually reaching the base case.\n\n<<<E>>>"
