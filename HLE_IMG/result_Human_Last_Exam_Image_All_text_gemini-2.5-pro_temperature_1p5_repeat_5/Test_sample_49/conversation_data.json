    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe problem asks for the cutoff frequency of the circuit at node $a_0$. This is an RC circuit, and its behavior suggests it acts as a low-pass filter where the output is the voltage at node $a_0$ across the capacitor $C$. The cutoff frequency is the frequency at which the filter's output signal power is attenuated to half the passband power. For a first-order filter, this corresponds to the frequency $\\omega_c$ (in radians/sec) or $f_c$ (in Hz) where the voltage magnitude drops to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its DC value.\n\n**2. The Concept of Cutoff Frequency in an RC Circuit**\nFor a simple RC circuit, the angular cutoff frequency is given by the formula:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\nAnd the cutoff frequency in Hertz is:\n$f_c = \\frac{\\omega_c}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R_{th}C}$\nwhere $R_{th}$ is the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor $C$ at its terminals (node $a_0$ and ground).\n\n**3. Determining the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we must:\n1.  Remove the capacitor $C$.\n2.  Deactivate all independent sources. The input `IN` is a voltage source applied at node $g_0$ with respect to ground. To deactivate it, we short node $g_0$ to ground.\n3.  Calculate the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground.\n\n**4. Circuit Analysis using Nodal Voltages**\nWe will use nodal analysis to find $R_{th}$. We apply a test voltage $V_{test}$ at node $a_0$ and calculate the current $I_{test}$ flowing from the test source. Then, $R_{th} = V_{test} / I_{test}$.\n\n*   **Setup**:\n    *   Let the voltage at node $a_0$ be $V_{a0} = V_{test}$.\n    *   Let the voltage at node $g_0$ be $V_{g0} = 0$ (grounded).\n    *   Let $V_{ck}$ and $V_{dk}$ be the voltages at nodes $c_k$ and $d_k$ for $k \\ge 1$.\n*   **Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) Equations**:\n    *   At node $c_1$: $\\frac{V_{c1}-V_{g0}}{r} + \\frac{V_{c1}-V_{c2}}{r} + \\frac{V_{c1}-V_{d1}}{r} = 0 \\implies 3V_{c1} - V_{c2} - V_{d1} = 0$\n    *   At node $d_1$: $\\frac{V_{d1}-V_{a0}}{r} + \\frac{V_{d1}-V_{d2}}{r} + \\frac{V_{d1}-V_{c1}}{r} = 0 \\implies 3V_{d1} - V_{test} - V_{d2} - V_{c1} = 0$\n    *   For any node $c_k$ where $k \\ge 2$: $\\frac{V_{ck}-V_{c,k-1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{ck}-V_{c,k+1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{ck}-V_{dk}}{r} = 0 \\implies 3V_{ck} - V_{c,k-1} - V_{c,k+1} - V_{dk} = 0$\n    *   For any node $d_k$ where $k \\ge 2$: $\\frac{V_{dk}-V_{d,k-1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{dk}-V_{d,k+1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{dk}-V_{ck}}{r} = 0 \\implies 3V_{dk} - V_{d,k-1} - V_{d,k+1} - V_{ck} = 0$\n\n**5. Solving the System of Difference Equations**\nTo solve this infinite system of equations, we use a transformation. Let $s_k = V_{ck} + V_{dk}$ and $d_k = V_{dk} - V_{ck}$.\n*   Adding the general KCL equations for $c_k$ and $d_k$ gives: $s_{k+1} - 2s_k + s_{k-1} = 0$.\n*   Subtracting the $c_k$ equation from the $d_k$ equation gives: $d_{k+1} - 4d_k + d_{k-1} = 0$.\n\nFor the circuit to be physically realistic, voltages must remain bounded as $k \\to \\infty$. The solutions to the difference equations under this condition are:\n*   $s_k = A$ (a constant)\n*   $d_k = E \\cdot \\lambda^k$, where $\\lambda = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$ is the root of $\\lambda^2 - 4\\lambda + 1 = 0$ with magnitude less than 1.\n\n**6. Applying Boundary Conditions**\nWe use the KCL equations at $k=1$ to find the constants $A$ and $E$.\nWe express the voltages in terms of $s_k$ and $d_k$: $V_{ck} = (s_k-d_k)/2$, $V_{dk} = (s_k+d_k)/2$.\nThe equations at $k=1$ become:\n1.  $3\\frac{s_1-d_1}{2} - \\frac{s_2-d_2}{2} - \\frac{s_1+d_1}{2} = 0 \\implies A - E(4\\lambda - \\lambda^2) = 0$\n2.  $3\\frac{s_1+d_1}{2} - V_{test} - \\frac{s_2+d_2}{2} - \\frac{s_1-d_1}{2} = 0 \\implies A + E(4\\lambda - \\lambda^2) - 2V_{test} = 0$\n\nSince $\\lambda^2 - 4\\lambda + 1 = 0$, we have $4\\lambda - \\lambda^2 = 1$. The system simplifies to:\n1.  $A - E = 0 \\implies A = E$\n2.  $A + E - 2V_{test} = 0 \\implies 2A = 2V_{test} \\implies A = V_{test}$\nThus, $A = V_{test}$ and $E = V_{test}$.\n\n**7. Calculating the Thevenin Resistance**\nThe test current $I_{test}$ flows from the source at $a_0$ into the network. The only connection is to node $d_1$.\n$I_{test} = \\frac{V_{a0} - V_{d1}}{r} = \\frac{V_{test} - V_{d1}}{r}$\nWe find $V_{d1}$ using our solved constants:\n$s_1 = A = V_{test}$\n$d_1 = E\\lambda^1 = V_{test}\\lambda$\n$V_{d1} = \\frac{s_1+d_1}{2} = \\frac{V_{test} + V_{test}\\lambda}{2} = \\frac{V_{test}(1+\\lambda)}{2}$\n\nNow, substitute $V_{d1}$ back into the expression for $I_{test}$:\n$I_{test} = \\frac{1}{r} \\left( V_{test} - \\frac{V_{test}(1+\\lambda)}{2} \\right) = \\frac{V_{test}}{r} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1+\\lambda}{2} \\right) = \\frac{V_{test}}{r} \\frac{1-\\lambda}{2}$\n\nThe Thevenin resistance is $R_{th} = \\frac{V_{test}}{I_{test}}$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{V_{test}}{\\frac{V_{test}}{r} \\frac{1-\\lambda}{2}} = \\frac{2r}{1-\\lambda}$\n\nSubstitute $\\lambda = 2-\\sqrt{3}$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r}{1 - (2-\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3}-1}$\n\nTo simplify, we rationalize the denominator:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{(\\sqrt{3}-1)(\\sqrt{3}+1)} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{3-1} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{2} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$\n\n**8. Final Answer: Cutoff Frequency**\nNow we can find the cutoff frequency. Using the angular frequency $\\omega_c$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$\nThe cutoff frequency in Hertz, $f_c$, is:\n$f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi rC(1+\\sqrt{3})}$\n\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency as an expression. Both $\\omega_c$ and $f_c$ are valid forms. We will provide the expression for the angular frequency $\\omega_c$ as it is mathematically simpler.\n\n<<<Ï‰_c = 1 / (r * C * (1 + sqrt(3)))>>>"
