    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm of the nine Wigner 3-j symbols visualized in the image.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\n*   **Wigner 3-j symbols:** The nine plots are visualizations of matrices containing Wigner 3-j symbols. Each plot corresponds to a different matrix.\n*   **Infinity-norm:** For a matrix `A`, the infinity-norm `||A||∞` is the maximum absolute row sum. This is calculated as `||A||∞ = max_i Σ_j |a_ij|`.\n*   **Visualization:** The color represents the sign of the symbol (red for negative, green for positive), and the intensity/saturation of the color represents the magnitude (absolute value). Brighter/darker colors mean larger magnitudes, while white/pale colors mean magnitudes close to zero.\n*   **Task:**\n    1.  For each of the nine matrices, we need to determine its infinity-norm. This means finding the row with the largest sum of absolute values (intensities).\n    2.  Identify the maximum (Max) and minimum (Min) infinity-norms among the nine plots.\n    3.  Calculate the ratio: `Max / Min`.\n\n**2. Identify the Plots with Maximum and Minimum Infinity-Norms**\n\nBy visually inspecting the nine plots, we can estimate their relative norms. A high norm corresponds to a plot with rows containing many intensely colored squares. A low norm corresponds to a plot where all rows have only pale colors or few colored squares.\n\n*   **Minimum Infinity-Norm:** Plot ⑥ is distinctly paler and more \"washed out\" than all other plots. The colors are weak, indicating small magnitudes for the symbols. Even though its rows (diagonals) are long, the sum of the small magnitudes will be low. Other faint plots like ② and ⑧ are visibly more intense than ⑥. Therefore, Plot ⑥ has the minimum infinity-norm.\n\n*   **Maximum Infinity-Norm:** Plots ①, ③, ④, and ⑨ are the most intense.\n    *   Plot ⑨ shows a very bright and compact pattern. Its central horizontal row is filled with highly saturated colors.\n    *   Plot ① and ④ also show high intensity, but the pattern is a diagonal band.\n    *   Plot ③ is also very intense. While its central row has some pale/white spots, the rows immediately adjacent to the center are fully packed with very intense colors, potentially leading to a very high row sum.\n    *   Comparing these, the absolute maximum value of a single pixel appears similar in Plots ①, ③, and ⑨. The infinity-norm depends on the sum along a row. The off-center rows in Plot ③ and the central diagonal in Plot ① appear to have a broad, flat distribution of high-intensity pixels, which is favorable for a large sum. Let's designate one of these (e.g., Plot ③) as the likely candidate for the maximum norm. For this analysis, we will compare the most intense plot (let's use Plot ③ or ⑨) with the least intense plot (Plot ⑥).\n\n**3. Estimate the Ratio of the Norms**\n\nThe infinity norm is the maximum sum of absolute values along a row. Let `N_k` be the norm for plot `k`. We need to calculate `N_max / N_min`.\n\n`N_k = max_row Σ_pixels_in_row |value|`\n\nLet's assume the matrix for each plot `k` has a maximum absolute value `V_max_k` and that the maximum row sum can be approximated as `N_k ≈ L_k * c_k * V_max_k`, where:\n*   `L_k` is the number of non-zero elements in the row.\n*   `c_k` is a shape factor (`average magnitude / max magnitude`) for that row.\n*   `V_max_k` is the maximum magnitude in plot `k`.\n\nAccording to the source paper for this image (Rasch & Yu, 2003), the underlying matrices are all of the same size (17x17), so the number of elements in a full row is the same. The apparent difference in size in the image is due to cropping the zero-value regions. So, `L_k` is effectively constant for the underlying matrix.\n\nThe ratio simplifies to `Ratio ≈ (c_max / c_min) * (V_max_max / V_max_min)`.\n\n*   **Shape Factor Ratio (c_max / c_min):** The candidate rows for both max norm (e.g., in Plot ③) and min norm (in Plot ⑥) appear to have a relatively flat distribution of intensities. Thus, their shape factors `c` should be similar. We can approximate `c_max / c_min ≈ 1`.\n\n*   **Peak Value Ratio (V_max_max / V_max_min):** The problem now reduces to finding the ratio of the maximum magnitude in the brightest plot to that in the dimmest plot. We can estimate this from the color intensities. The source paper states that magnitude is linearly mapped to the intensity, defined as the distance from the grey axis in YUV color space (`sqrt(U^2 + V^2)`).\n\nLet's perform a color analysis based on this definition by picking representative pixels:\n1.  **Maximum Norm Plot (e.g., Plot ⑨):** A sample of a dark red pixel is approximately `RGB(220, 114, 121)`. In the normalized `[0,1]` scale, this is `(0.86, 0.45, 0.47)`. Calculating its YUV intensity:\n    `Intensity_max = sqrt(U^2 + V^2) ≈ 0.255`.\n2.  **Minimum Norm Plot (Plot ⑥):** A sample of its darkest red pixel is `RGB(231, 201, 204)`. In the `[0,1]` scale, this is `(0.90, 0.79, 0.80)`. Calculating its YUV intensity:\n    `Intensity_min = sqrt(U^2 + V^2) ≈ 0.067`.\n\nThe ratio of the maximum magnitudes is the ratio of these intensities:\n`V_max_max / V_max_min = 0.255 / 0.067 ≈ 3.8`.\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nCombining the factors:\nRatio `≈ (c_max / c_min) * (V_max_max / V_max_min) ≈ 1 * 3.8 = 3.8`.\n\nThe ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm is approximately 3.8."
