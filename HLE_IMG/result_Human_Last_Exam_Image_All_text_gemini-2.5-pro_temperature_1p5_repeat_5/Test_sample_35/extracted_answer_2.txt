The protein S100B shows a strong affinity for the **V and C1 domains** of the RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts) receptor.

S100B could be used as a **prognostic marker** for neurological disorders. This is because the diagram and text indicate that the level of S100B is directly linked to the severity of the disease pathology. Its binding to RAGE activates downstream pathways that cause neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Therefore, a higher level of S100B would predict a more aggressive disease course and a worse outcome for the patient, which is the definition of a prognostic marker. It is not *solely* an adjunct marker because its value extends beyond aiding diagnosis to predicting the future progression of the disease.
