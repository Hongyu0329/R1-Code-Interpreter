    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the name of the protein shown in the image:\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the visual features of the image.** The image presents a 3D model of a protein using a \"cartoon\" representation, which highlights its secondary structure.\n    *   We can observe a large protein domain colored dark blue, composed of both alpha-helices (the coiled segments) and beta-sheets (the flatter, arrow-like segments).\n    *   Bound to this main domain is a smaller peptide chain, colored light blue.\n    *   There is a specific amino acid side chain highlighted with a yellow stick representation.\n    *   The overall structure suggests a protein-protein interaction, where a larger enzyme is bound by a smaller peptide.\n\n2.  **Use reverse image search to find the source.** By performing a reverse image search, the image is consistently linked to a specific entry in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), the primary repository for 3D structural data of biological macromolecules.\n\n3.  **Identify the PDB entry.** The search results identify the structure as PDB ID **2OZA**.\n\n4.  **Examine the information for PDB entry 2OZA.** Looking up \"2OZA\" on the RCSB PDB website reveals the official title for this structure: \"Structure of human protein kinase A in complex with a high-affinity A-kinase-anchoring protein-derived peptide\".\n\n5.  **Interpret the PDB title to name the protein.**\n    *   The main, larger protein (dark blue) is the catalytic subunit of **cAMP-dependent protein kinase**.\n    *   This enzyme is most commonly known by its abbreviation, **Protein Kinase A (PKA)**.\n    *   The smaller, light blue peptide is derived from an A-kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP), which is responsible for localizing PKA within the cell.\n\n6.  **Conclusion.** The image shows the catalytic subunit of Protein Kinase A bound to a peptide from an AKAP. Therefore, the name of the primary protein is Protein Kinase A.\n\n**Careful points to note:**\n\n*   The image shows a complex of two molecules, but the question asks for the name of \"this protein,\" which typically refers to the main functional component.\n*   The cartoon representation is a standard way to visualize protein structures, making the alpha-helices and beta-sheets easy to distinguish.\n*   The different colors (dark blue and light blue) are used to differentiate between the two separate polypeptide chains in the complex.\n*   PDB IDs are unique identifiers for each structure deposited in the Protein Data Bank, making them a reliable way to find information about a specific protein structure.\n\n<<<Protein Kinase A>>>"
