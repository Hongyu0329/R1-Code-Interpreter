    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each of the 9 artworks.\n\n**Analysis of Each Artwork:**\n\n**Row 1: Left to Right**\n\n1.  **Top Left Artwork:**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is a figure painting in ink and color on paper, depicting women from a Chinese ethnic minority. The style is characterized by realistic and detailed rendering of the faces and hands, combined with expressive and fluid brushwork for the clothing. This combination is a hallmark of a specific modern master.\n    *   **Signature and Seal:** In the upper right corner, a signature and a red seal are visible. Upon closer inspection of the cropped image, the signature reads \"国良\" (Guoliang), and the seal script can be identified as \"史国良\" (Shi Guoliang).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The artist is **Shi Guoliang**, who is famous for his figure paintings, especially of Tibetan and other minority peoples.\n\n2.  **Top Middle Artwork:**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is an abstract landscape painting in ink on paper. The artist uses strong, black, calligraphic lines to outline buildings (like traditional Chinese houses with tiled roofs) and trees. This technique of abstracting real-world scenery into geometric and linear forms is the signature style of a prominent modern artist.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The style is unmistakably that of **Wu Guanzhong**, a master of integrating Western modernism with Chinese artistic traditions. Many of his works feature landscapes deconstructed into lines, dots, and color blocks.\n\n3.  **Top Right Artwork:**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy written in a very dynamic and powerful cursive script (草书, caoshu). The style is highly individualistic and recognizable.\n    *   **Signature:** The signature at the end of the text on the left is \"毛澤東\" (Mao Zedong).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The author is **Mao Zedong**. His calligraphy is famous for its unique and vigorous style.\n\n**Row 2: Left to Right**\n\n4.  **Middle Left Artwork:**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is another example of Chinese calligraphy, this time in a running script (行书, xingshu). The characters are elegant, well-structured, yet fluid and lean slightly to the right. This unique style is very well-known.\n    *   **Signature and Seal:** There are several seals visible. The seals at the beginning (top right) read \"启功之印\" (Qi Gong zhi yin) and \"元白\" (Yuanbai, Qi Gong's courtesy name). A seal near the signature on the left also reads \"启功\" (Qi Gong).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The author is **Qi Gong**, one of the most celebrated calligraphers of the 20th century.\n\n5.  **Middle Center Artwork:**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is a realist oil painting, not a traditional Chinese ink painting. It depicts a young woman with short hair in a white T-shirt, holding a sketchbook and a red pencil, seemingly about to draw. The meticulous detail and melancholic mood are characteristic of a specific art movement.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This is a famous painting titled \"My Prequel\" (我的前传) by **He Duoling**. He is a leading figure in the Chinese \"Sichuan School\" of realist painting, known for his poetic and introspective works.\n\n6.  **Middle Right Artwork:**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is a modern ink and color painting depicting a woman from an ethnic minority group, distinguished by her elaborate headdress. The style is a fusion of realistic depiction of the face, expressive and abstract brushwork for the clothing and hair, and a decorative background with sparrows.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This unique blend of realism, expressionism, and abstraction is the signature style of **Shi Qi**. He is known for creating visually complex and dynamic compositions, often featuring minority figures.\n\n**Row 3: Left to Right**\n\n7.  **Bottom Left Artwork:**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is a colorful painting depicting a rustic courtyard scene with hanging gourds (luffa), laundry on a line, and a basket of chicks. The composition is vibrant, using bright color blocks and strong linear elements (the trellis, the gourds).\n    *   **Signature and Seal:** A signature and seal are visible on the wall to the right. The signature clearly reads \"吴冠中\" (Wu Guanzhong) and the date \"一九九二\" (1992).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The artist is **Wu Guanzhong**. This work is a prime example of his later style, focusing on the beauty of form and color in everyday rural life.\n\n8.  **Bottom Middle Artwork:**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is a Chinese landscape painting (山水画, shanshui hua). It shows boats with red sails navigating a river through imposing, dark mountains shrouded in mist. The style is characterized by the use of heavy, layered ink to create a sense of monumental weight and depth, with the light areas of the mist and water creating a strong contrast.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This powerful and iconic style is the hallmark of **Li Keran**. He was a master of 20th-century Chinese landscape painting, famous for his depictions of locations like the Li River and the Yangtze Gorges.\n\n9.  **Bottom Right Artwork:**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is an ink wash painting of a single lobster. The work is minimalist but displays incredible skill in its brushwork, capturing the creature's texture and translucency with just ink and water. Painting shrimp, crabs, and lobsters with such liveliness was the specialty of one particular artist.\n    *   **Seal:** A red seal in the upper right corner reads \"白石\" (Baishi).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The artist is **Qi Baishi**, one of the most famous modern Chinese painters. His paintings of small creatures, especially shrimp, are iconic and celebrated for their charm and technical mastery.\n\n---\n**Final Answer Listing**\n\nBased on the analysis, the authors for the 9 works from left to right, top to bottom are:\n1.
