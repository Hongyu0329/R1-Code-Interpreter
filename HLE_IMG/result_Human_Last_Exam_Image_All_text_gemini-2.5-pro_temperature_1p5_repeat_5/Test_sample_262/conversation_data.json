    "*   **Step 1: Understand the Goal**\n    The question asks to identify which of the four depicted iridium(III) complexes are expected to have shorter operational lifetimes when used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). A shorter lifetime implies lower chemical stability of the complex under the electrical and chemical stress of device operation.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Molecular Structures**\n    All four complexes are cationic, octahedral Ir(III) complexes with the general formula [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+, where PF6- is the counter-ion.\n    *   **Metal Center:** The metal is Iridium(III) in all cases.\n    *   **Ancillary Ligand (N^N):** The bidentate nitrogen-donating ligand is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine for all four complexes. Since it is constant, it will not be the source of differences in lifetime among these specific complexes.\n    *   **Cyclometalating Ligands (C^N):** The key difference between the four complexes lies in the substitution pattern on the two identical cyclometalating 2-phenylpyridine ligands.\n        *   **Complex 1:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has two fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring.\n        *   **Complex 2:** The C^N ligand is 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has one fluorine atom on the phenyl ring.\n        *   **Complex 3:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has one fluorine atom on the phenyl ring.\n        *   **Complex 4:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2,3,4,5-tetrafluorophenyl)pyridine. It has four fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring.\n\n*   **Step 3: Relate Structure to Stability and Lifetime**\n    The operational stability of cyclometalated iridium complexes in LECs and OLEDs is strongly influenced by the strength and robustness of the metal-ligand bonds, especially the Ir-C bond of the cyclometalating ligand. A stronger, more protected Ir-C bond generally leads to a more stable complex and a longer device lifetime. Fluorination of the phenyl ring is a well-known strategy to enhance this stability.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the Effect of Fluorine Substituents**\n    Fluorine atoms affect stability in two main ways:\n    1.  **Electronic Effect:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom. Its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect pulls electron density from the phenyl ring, which strengthens the Ir-C sigma bond. Generally, more fluorine atoms lead to a stronger electronic stabilization effect.\n    2.  **Steric Effect:** A fluorine atom at the ortho-position of the phenyl ring (C2 position, adjacent to the Ir-C bond) provides steric hindrance. This \"ortho-fluorination\" strategy sterically shields the relatively reactive Ir-C bond from potential chemical attack by other species in the device (e.g., water, counter-ions), preventing degradation pathways. This steric protection is a crucial factor for high stability.\n\n*   **Step 5: Evaluate and Compare the Four Complexes**\n    Let's assess each complex based on these stabilizing factors:\n    *   **Complex 4:** Has four fluorine atoms, including one at the ortho-position. It benefits from the maximum electronic stabilization and the crucial steric protection. It is expected to be the **most stable** and have the longest lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 1:** Has two fluorine atoms, one at the ortho-position and one at the para-position. It benefits from both steric protection (from the 2-F) and significant electronic stabilization (from both 2-F and 4-F). It is expected to be **very stable**, second only to complex 4.\n    *   **Complex 3:** Has a single fluorine atom at the ortho-position. It benefits from the crucial steric protection, which significantly enhances its stability compared to a non-fluorinated or para-fluorinated analogue. However, its overall electronic stabilization from just one fluorine atom is less than that of complexes 1 and 4. It is expected to be **less stable than 1 and 4**.\n    *   **Complex 2:** Has a single fluorine atom at the para-position. It benefits from some electronic stabilization but critically **lacks the ortho-fluorine for steric protection**. The absence of this steric shield makes the Ir-C bond more vulnerable to degradation. It is expected to be the **least stable** of the four complexes.\n\n*   **Step 6: Rank Stability and Identify Complexes with Shorter Lifetimes**\n    Based on the analysis, the expected order of stability (and thus operational lifetime) is:\n    **Complex 4 > Complex 1 > Complex 3 > Complex 2**\n\n    The question asks for the complexes with \"shorter lifetimes\". This refers to the least stable complexes in the set.\n    *   Complexes 1 and 4 represent a group of highly stable, poly-fluorinated emitters.\n    *   Complexes 2 and 3 represent a group of less stable, mono-fluorinated emitters.\n    Although Complex 3 is more stable than Complex 2, both are expected to have significantly shorter lifetimes compared to the more heavily fluorinated Complexes 1 and 4. Therefore, the group of complexes with shorter lifetimes is {2, 3}.\n\n*   **Step 7: Final Conclusion**\n    Complexes 2 and 3 are expected to show shorter lifetimes compared to complexes 1 and 4 because they are less stabilized by fluorination. Complex 2 lacks the critical steric protection of an ortho-fluorine, and Complex 3 has less electronic stabilization than the poly-fluorinated complexes. This corresponds to the pair [2, 3].\n\n<<<H>>>"
