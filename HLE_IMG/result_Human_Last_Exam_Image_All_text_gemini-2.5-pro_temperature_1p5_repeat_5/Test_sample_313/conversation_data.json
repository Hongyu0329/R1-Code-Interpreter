    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first part of the clue and the image.**\n*   The clue states, \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows two men in suits at an awards ceremony. The man on the right, with a beard, is receiving a trophy.\n*   A search for major award events on or around June 20, 2019, reveals the NHL Awards were held on June 19, 2019.\n*   The recipient in the image is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov, a player for the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n*   At the 2019 NHL Awards, Kucherov had a remarkable night, winning three of the league's most prestigious individual awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (voted by players), and the Art Ross Trophy (leading scorer).\n*   Winning three major awards or accomplishing a feat three times in sports is known as a **hat trick**. This makes \"Hat Trick\" a very strong candidate for the term \"X Y\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second part of the clue.**\n*   The clue states, \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This points to a historical industrial process. We need to find a connection between a term \"X Y\" and the use of mercury salts.\n*   Historically, mercury(II) nitrate, a mercury salt, was used in the process of \"carroting,\" which turned animal fur into felt for making high-quality hats.\n*   The workers in this trade, known as hatters, were exposed to mercury vapors, which often led to mercury poisoning, a condition called erethism. The symptoms included tremors, slurred speech, and psychosis, which gave rise to the expression \"mad as a hatter.\"\n*   Due to the proven toxicity, the use of mercury in the hat-making industry was banned and has now ceased.\n\n**Step 3: Connect both clues with the term \"Hat Trick\".**\n*   The term \"hat trick\" originates from the sport of cricket in the mid-19th century. When a bowler took three wickets with three consecutive balls, it was customary for fans to hold a collection for him or for the club to present him with a new hat to commemorate the achievement.\n*   The \"trick\" can be seen as the feat itself, but it can also be interpreted as the \"trick of the trade\" for making the very hats that gave the term its name. That \"trick\" involved using toxic mercury salts.\n*   Therefore, the term \"Hat Trick\" perfectly fits both parts of the riddle:\n    1.  It describes Nikita Kucherov's achievement of winning three major awards at the pictured event.\n    2.  \"Another hat trick\" (the trick/process used to make the hats in the term's origin) has ceased to be used because of the toxicity of the mercury salts involved.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the \"X Y\" that links the hockey awards ceremony to the disused toxic process is \"Hat Trick\".\n\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
