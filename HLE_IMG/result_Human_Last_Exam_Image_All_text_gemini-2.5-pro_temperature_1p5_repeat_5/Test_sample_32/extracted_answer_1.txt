The main difference in the sporophyte is the curvature of the seta (the stalk) and the resulting orientation of the capsule. In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule in an erect, upright position, often immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctive short but strongly curved (arcuate or S-shaped) seta, which causes the capsule to be cernuous (nodding) or bent to one side.
