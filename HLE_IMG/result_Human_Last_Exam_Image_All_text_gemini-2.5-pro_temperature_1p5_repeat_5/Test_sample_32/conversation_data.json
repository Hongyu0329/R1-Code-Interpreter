    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the most prominent, visually distinct feature of the **sporophyte** that separates *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta*. The phrase \"at a glance\" implies a macroscopic feature that does not require a microscope or detailed dissection.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of a Moss Sporophyte:** A typical moss sporophyte is composed of three main parts:\n    *   **Foot:** Embeds the sporophyte into the gametophyte (the leafy plant part).\n    *   **Seta:** The stalk that elevates the capsule. Its length and shape (straight, curved) are important diagnostic features.\n    *   **Capsule (Sporangium):** The structure at the top of the seta that produces and releases spores. Its shape, orientation, and surface features (e.g., ribs) are also key identifiers.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Sporophyte of *Grimmia montana***:\n    *   **Seta:** This species has a very short and **straight** seta.\n    *   **Capsule Orientation:** Because the seta is short and straight, the capsule is held upright (erect).\n    *   **Position:** The capsule is typically \"immersed\" (nestled down among the perichaetial leaves) or \"emergent\" (peeking just above the leaves). It is not raised high on a long stalk. The image provided, showing capsules sitting low within the moss tuft, is a good example of this immersed/emergent character.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta***:\n    *   **Etymology:** The name itself is a major clue. In Latin, *curvus* means \"curved\" and *seta* refers to the stalk. So, *curviseta* means \"curved stalk\".\n    *   **Seta:** The defining characteristic of this species' sporophyte is that its seta is distinctly **curved or arcuate (S-shaped)**.\n    *   **Capsule Orientation:** The curvature of the seta causes the capsule to be bent over, described as \"cernuous\" (nodding) or \"pendent\". It is not held erect.\n    *   **Position:** Like *G. montana*, the sporophyte is not typically on a long seta, but its unique curvature and nodding capsule make it stand out.\n\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:**\n    *   The primary, and most obvious, distinguishing feature is the **shape of the seta** and the resulting **orientation of the capsule**.\n    *   In *Grimmia montana*, you would look for erect, upright capsules nestled in the leaves on a short, straight seta.\n    *   In *Grimmia curviseta*, you would look for nodding or bent capsules on a short, but clearly curved or S-shaped seta.\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Focus on the Sporophyte:** The question is specifically about the spore-producing generation, not the leafy green gametophyte.\n*   **\"At a glance\" feature:** This points away from microscopic details (like peristome teeth or spore ornamentation) and towards a large-scale structural difference.\n*   **Use the Name:** Botanical names often describe a key feature. *Curviseta* is a perfect example.\n*   **Relate Seta to Capsule:** The shape of the seta directly influences the orientation of the capsule, which is what is most easily observed. Straight seta leads to an erect capsule; curved seta leads to a nodding capsule.\n\nBy comparing these points, the main difference is clear and easily observable.\n\n<<<The main difference in the sporophyte is the curvature of the seta (the stalk) and the resulting orientation of the capsule. In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule in an erect, upright position, often immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctive short but strongly curved (arcuate or S-shaped) seta, which causes the capsule to be cernuous (nodding) or bent to one side."
