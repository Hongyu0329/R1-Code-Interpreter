    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the altarpiece detail.\n\n**Step 1: Visual Analysis of the Artwork**\n*   **Medium and Technique:** The artwork is a relief sculpture presented within a circular frame (a tondo). The material appears to be stone, most likely marble, given the fine details and the way light reflects off the sharp edges. It is not glazed terracotta, which would have a glossier, more uniform surface. The technique is a form of low relief, with figures in the background carved very shallowly (a technique known as *rilievo stiacciato*) to create an illusion of depth.\n*   **Subject Matter:** The scene depicts a Christian sacrament, specifically the Eucharist or Holy Communion. A priest is distributing the communion wafer to a group of kneeling figures, including a child in the foreground.\n*   **Style:** The style is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance, specifically the Florentine school of the 15th century (Quattrocento). The figures are graceful, with gentle expressions and idealized features. The drapery is handled with elegance and a sense of naturalism. The overall composition is harmonious and emotionally tender.\n*   **Inscription:** At the bottom of the tondo, there is a partially visible inscription on a scroll or cartouche. The legible part reads \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This likely translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar\". The use of 'V' for 'U' (\"AVTEL\" for \"AUTEL\") was common in Latin and early Romance languages. \"Autel\" is the French word for altar (Italian is \"altare\"), which is a minor but interesting detail.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying Potential Artists**\nThe combination of delicate marble carving, the use of low relief, and the sweet, graceful style strongly points to a small group of highly skilled Florentine sculptors active in the mid-15th century. The most prominent candidates would be:\n*   **Desiderio da Settignano (c. 1430 – 1464):** He was renowned for the extreme subtlety and sensitivity of his marble carvings and his ability to convey tender emotions. His style is a very strong match for the piece in the image.\n*   **Antonio Rossellino (1427–1479):** A contemporary of Desiderio, also known for his graceful and detailed marble work.\n*   **Mino da Fiesole (c. 1429–1484):** Another contemporary whose work is sometimes compared to Desiderio's, though often considered slightly more formal or \"drier\" in style.\n\n**Step 3: Research and Attribution**\nBased on the strong stylistic clues pointing towards Desiderio da Settignano, a targeted search is performed.\n*   A search for \"Desiderio da Settignano relief Eucharist\" or similar terms reveals that he created a famous marble altarpiece known as the \"Tabernacle of the Sacrament\" or the \"Carnesecchi Tabernacle\".\n*   This tabernacle was originally located in the church of San Pier Maggiore in Florence, which was demolished in the 18th century. The various parts of the altarpiece were then dispersed and are now in several museums and collections.\n*   Specialized art historical archives, such as the Fondazione Zeri photo archive, contain photographs of this specific relief. These records identify the piece as a predella panel (a panel from the base of the altarpiece) from the Carnesecchi Tabernacle.\n*   These records confirm the attribution of the work to **Desiderio da Settignano**. The relief depicts \"The Communion,\" fitting the scene and the inscription.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nThe analysis of the style, technique, and subject matter, corroborated by art historical documentation and photographic archives, confidently identifies the author. The delicate handling of the marble, the gentle expressiveness of the figures, and the masterful use of low relief are all hallmarks of Desiderio da Settignano's work. The piece is a known, though now displaced, part of his famous Carnesecchi Tabernacle.\n\nThe author of this detail of the Altarpiece is Desiderio da Settignano.\n\n<<<Desiderio da Settignano>>>"
