    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to determine the substituents at the labeled positions.\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction Type**\nThe reaction shows an alcohol starting material treated with catalytic acid (HCl) and heat (110 °C) to form an alkene and water. This is an acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction, which typically proceeds via an E1 mechanism involving a carbocation intermediate. The mention of \"[1,2] shifts\" confirms that carbocation rearrangements are a key part of the mechanism. These rearrangements, known as Wagner-Meerwein shifts, occur to form more stable carbocations. Under these high-temperature conditions (thermodynamic control), the reaction will favor the formation of the most stable possible alkene product.\n\n**2. Analyze the Starting Material and Product**\n*   **Starting Material (SM):** A complex pentacyclic alcohol (a triterpenoid). For the rearrangement, the stereochemistry of the substituents on the ring system is crucial. We must identify the axial groups that are capable of migrating. Based on standard chair conformations and the provided drawing:\n    *   The -OH group is at C-3.\n    *   C-4 has two methyl groups (gem-dimethyl). The axial one can migrate.\n    *   C-5 has an axial hydrogen (dashed bond).\n    *   C-10 has an axial methyl group (wedged bond).\n    *   C-9 has an axial hydrogen (dashed bond).\n    *   C-8 has an axial methyl group (wedged bond).\n    *   C-14 has an axial hydrogen (dashed bond).\n    *   C-13 has an axial hydrogen (wedged bond, in this D/E ring fusion).\n*   **Product:** A pentacyclic alkene with a tetrasubstituted double bond. This is a very stable alkene, consistent with thermodynamic control. The positions to be identified (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are all located on the fused ring core.\n\n**3. Propose a Detailed Mechanism (The \"Backbone Rearrangement\")**\nThe reaction proceeds through a cascade of [1,2]-shifts, moving the positive charge systematically through the carbon skeleton. The group that is anti-periplanar (usually axial) to the bond of the adjacent carbocation migrates.\n\n*   **Step 1: Formation of the Initial Carbocation.** The acid protonates the -OH group, which then leaves as a water molecule, forming a secondary carbocation at C-3.\n\n*   **Step 2: First [1,2]-Shift.** The carbocation at C-3 is secondary. It can be stabilized by migration of a neighboring group. An axial methyl group from C-4 migrates to C-3. This is favored because it forms a more stable tertiary carbocation at C-4.\n    *   *Cation moves: C-3 → C-4*\n\n*   **Step 3: Second [1,2]-Shift.** The axial hydrogen at C-5 migrates to the carbocation at C-4. The positive charge moves to C-5, which is also a tertiary position.\n    *   *Cation moves: C-4 → C-5*\n    *   **Analysis for Position 1:** The label '1' is at the axial position on C-4 in the product. This position is now occupied by the hydrogen that migrated from C-5. Therefore, **1 = H**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Third [1,2]-Shift.** The axial methyl group at C-10 migrates to the carbocation at C-5. The positive charge moves to C-10, another tertiary position.\n    *   *Cation moves: C-5 → C-10*\n\n*   **Step 5: Fourth [1,2]-Shift.** The axial hydrogen at C-9 migrates to the carbocation at C-10. The positive charge moves to C-9 (tertiary).\n    *   *Cation moves: C-10 → C-9*\n    *   **Analysis for Position 2:** The label '2' is at the axial position on C-10. This position is now occupied by the hydrogen that migrated from C-9. Therefore, **2 = H**.\n\n*   **Step 6: Fifth [1,2]-Shift.** The axial methyl group at C-8 migrates to the carbocation at C-9. The positive charge moves to C-8 (tertiary).\n    *   *Cation moves: C-9 → C-8*\n    *   **Analysis for Position 5:** The label '5' is at the axial position on C-9. This position is now occupied by the methyl group that migrated from C-8. Therefore, **5 = CH3**.\n\n*   **Step 7: Sixth [1,2]-Shift.** The axial hydrogen at C-14 migrates to the carbocation at C-8. The positive charge moves to C-14 (tertiary).\n    *   *Cation moves: C-8 → C-14*\n    *   **Analysis for Position 3:** The label '3' is at the axial position on C-8. This position is now occupied by the hydrogen that migrated from C-14. Therefore, **3 = H**.\n\n*   **Step 8: Seventh [1,2]-Shift.** The axial hydrogen at C-13 migrates to the carbocation at C-14. The positive charge moves to C-13 (tertiary). This is the final carbocation before elimination.\n    *   *Cation moves: C-14 → C-13*\n    *   **Analysis for Position 4:** The label '4' is at the axial position on C-14. This position is now occupied by the hydrogen that migrated from C-13. Therefore, **4 = H**.\n\n*   **Step 9: Elimination.** The final carbocation is at C-13. A proton is removed from an adjacent carbon (C-18) to form the most stable tetrasubstituted alkene, yielding the final product.\n\n**4. Consolidate the Results**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement cascade:\n*   Substituent at position 1 (on C-4) is **H**.\n*   Substituent at position 2 (on C-10) is **H**.\n*   Substituent at position 3 (on C-8) is **H**.\n*   Substituent at position 4 (on C-14) is **H**.\n*   Substituent at position 5 (on C-9) is **CH3**.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\n1 = H, 2 = H, 3 = H, 4 = H, 5 = CH3.\n\n<<<1 = H, 2 = H, 3 = H, 4 = H, 5 = CH3>>>"
