    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Musicological Analysis:**\n    *   **Clef:** The music is written in the treble clef.\n    *   **Key Signature:** There is one flat (Bb) in the key signature. This indicates the key of F major or its relative minor, D minor. However, the first chord is marked F- (F minor), and the piece consistently uses chords and melodic notes that point to the key of F minor.\n    *   **Time Signature:** Although not explicitly written with numbers, the piece is in 4/4 common time, which is standard for this style. The beaming and note values confirm this.\n\n2.  **Transcription of Melody and Chords (A Section):**\n    *   Let's analyze the first distinct section (the 'A' section), which is repeated.\n    *   **Measure 1:** Chord: F- (F minor). Melody: C, F, F.\n    *   **Measure 2:** Chord: E-7b5 (E half-diminished). Melody: E, G, E.\n    *   **Measure 3:** Chord: Eb-6 (E-flat minor sixth). Melody: D, C, Bb.\n    *   **Measure 4:** Chords: Dbmaj7 (D-flat major seventh) then G7. Melody: Ab over the Dbmaj7, then F# and G over the G7.\n    *   **Measure 5:** Chord: C7. Melody: A descending chromatic line F, Eb, D, C#.\n    *   This sequence of chords, F- -> E-7b5 -> Eb-6 -> Dbmaj7..., with its descending chromatic bass motion (F -> E -> Eb -> Db), is highly characteristic. The melody that fits over it is also very specific.\n\n3.  **Identification of the Tune:**\n    *   The combination of the melodic phrase and the specific chord progression in the first four bars is the primary clue.\n    *   A search for jazz standards with the chord progression `Fm | Em7b5 | Ebm6` or a melody starting `C-F-F | E-G-E` points strongly to one specific tune.\n    *   This tune is **\"Nica's Dream\"**, composed by the great jazz pianist and composer **Horace Silver**.\n\n4.  **Verification:**\n    *   \"Nica's Dream\" is most commonly played in the key of Bb minor. The provided lead sheet is in F minor. To verify, we can transpose the standard changes of \"Nica's Dream\" from Bb minor up a perfect fifth to F minor.\n    *   **Standard \"Nica's Dream\" in Bb minor (A section):**\n        `Bbm | Am7b5 | Abm6 | Gbmaj7 F7 | ...`\n    *   **Transposed to F minor (up a perfect fifth):**\n        `Fm | Em7b5 | Ebm6 | Dbmaj7 C7 | ...`\n    *   This transposed progression is a near-perfect match for the chords written on the provided sheet music. The G7 in measure 4 of the chart is a common substitution (a secondary dominant, V7 of V7) that leads smoothly to the C7 chord.\n    *   Similarly, transposing the melody of \"Nica's Dream\" from Bb minor up a perfect fifth yields the exact melody written on the sheet. For instance, the opening melodic phrase `F Bb Bb` in Bb minor becomes `C F F` in F minor, which is what we see in the first measure.\n\n5.  **Analysis of the Bridge (B Section):**\n    *   The section of the chart beginning at measure 11 (`D-7b5 | G7 | C7 | F7 |...`) is the bridge.\n    *   This progression is different from the standard bridge of \"Nica's Dream\".\n    *   The standard bridge for \"Nica's Dream\" (transposed to F minor) would be: `Bbm7 | Eb7 | Abmaj7 | Db7 | Gm7b5 | C7 | Fm | ...`\n    *   The bridge in the chart is a different sequence of chords, cycling through several key centers. This is a common practice among jazz musicians, who often substitute or reharmonize sections of standard tunes. The identity of the song, however, is firmly established by its distinctive 'A' section.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the exact match of the melody and chord progression in the main theme (the 'A' section), the jazz standard is \"Nica's Dream\" by Horace Silver, presented here in the key of F minor with a substituted bridge.\n\n***\n\n**Title:** Nica's Dream\n**Composer:** Horace Silver\n<<<Title: Nica's Dream, Composer: Horace Silver>>>"
