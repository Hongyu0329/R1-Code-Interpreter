The products A, B, and C are formed through a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction. The key steps and structures are as follows:

1.  **Product C (C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₃):** The starting material, N-(Δ¹-pyrrolin-5-yl)proline, reacts with acetic anhydride to form a münchnone intermediate. This mesoionic compound **is Product C**.

     

2.  The münchnone **C** reacts with methyl propiolate in a [3+2] cycloaddition to form a primary bicyclic adduct.

3.  This adduct undergoes two different subsequent reactions to yield products **A** and **B**:
    *   **Product A (C₁₄H₂₀N₂O₃):** The primary adduct undergoes a retro-Diels-Alder-like reaction to eliminate carbon dioxide (CO₂), forming a stable pyrrole derivative. The structure is a substituted 2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolizine. **This is Product A**.

         

    *   **Product B (C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₃):** The primary adduct undergoes an alternative fragmentation, eliminating a molecule of methyl acetate (CH₃COOCH₃) instead of CO₂. **This is Product B**.
