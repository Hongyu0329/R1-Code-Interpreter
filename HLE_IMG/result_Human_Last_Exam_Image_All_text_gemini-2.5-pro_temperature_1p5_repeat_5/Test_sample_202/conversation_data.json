    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify each rock specimen.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen H**\n1.  **Observe Texture:** The rock is highly porous, with many visible holes or cavities. This texture is known as vesicular. This indicates that the rock formed from lava that contained a lot of trapped gas bubbles which escaped as it cooled.\n2.  **Observe Color:** The color is reddish-brown, which often results from the oxidation of iron within the rock.\n3.  **Observe Grain Size:** The individual mineral crystals are too small to be seen with the naked eye, a texture known as aphanitic. This points to rapid cooling, characteristic of extrusive (volcanic) igneous rocks.\n4.  **Conclusion:** A reddish, vesicular, aphanitic volcanic rock is identified as **Scoria**.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen I**\n1.  **Observe Composition:** The rock is clearly composed of numerous smaller rock fragments (clasts) cemented together by a finer-grained material (matrix).\n2.  **Observe Clast Shape:** The fragments are noticeably angular, with sharp edges and corners, rather than being smooth and rounded.\n3.  **Observe Clast Size:** The fragments are relatively large, mostly gravel-sized.\n4.  **Conclusion:** A clastic sedimentary rock made of large, angular fragments is called a **Breccia**.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen J**\n1.  **Observe Texture:** Similar to specimen H, this rock is also highly vesicular and appears very lightweight and porous.\n2.  **Observe Color:** The color is very light, ranging from white to light gray. Light coloration in igneous rocks typically indicates a felsic composition (rich in silica).\n3.  **Observe Grain Size:** The rock has an aphanitic (fine-grained) texture, indicating it cooled quickly at the Earth's surface.\n4.  **Conclusion:** A light-colored, highly vesicular, low-density volcanic rock is identified as **Pumice**.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen K**\n1.  **Observe Texture:** The rock is composed of large, visible, interlocking mineral crystals. This coarse-grained texture is known as phaneritic, which indicates the rock cooled slowly deep beneath the Earth's surface.\n2.  **Observe Mineral Composition:** There is a mixture of different colored minerals. We can see light-colored minerals (likely white/pinkish feldspar and glassy gray quartz) and some darker minerals (likely biotite mica or hornblende).\n3.  **Conclusion:** An intrusive igneous rock with a phaneritic texture, composed primarily of quartz and feldspar, is identified as **Granite**.\n\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Granite\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Granite>>>"
