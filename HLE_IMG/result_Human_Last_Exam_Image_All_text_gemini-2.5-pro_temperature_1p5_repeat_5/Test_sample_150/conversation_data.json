    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Benzene reacts with propanoyl chloride in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, AlCl₃.\n*   **Mechanism:** The AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride to form a propanoyl cation (an acylium ion, CH₃CH₂C⁺=O). The aromatic ring of benzene attacks this electrophile. After deprotonation, the acyl group (propanoyl group) is attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is **propiophenone** (1-phenylpropan-1-one). Its structure is a phenyl group bonded to the carbonyl carbon of a propanone skeleton.\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically bromination.\n*   **Mechanism:** The reactant is propiophenone. The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) attached to the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Such groups are deactivating and are *meta*-directors. The reagent Br₂/FeBr₃ generates the electrophile Br⁺, which will attack the benzene ring at the position *meta* to the acyl group.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The product is **1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one**. A bromine atom is substituted onto the benzene ring at position 3 relative to the propanoyl group.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation.\n*   **Mechanism:** The reactant is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one. The reagents are H₂ gas and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. For a ketone where the carbonyl group is adjacent to a benzene ring (a benzylic ketone), this reaction typically causes complete reduction of the carbonyl group to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This process is known as hydrogenolysis. The carbon-bromine bond on the aromatic ring is less reactive under these standard hydrogenation conditions and remains intact.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The product is **1-bromo-3-propylbenzene**. The C=O group is reduced to a CH₂ group.\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 to the Final Product**\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a radical substitution, specifically a benzylic bromination.\n*   **Mechanism:** The reactant is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene. The reagents are N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS), benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂), and CCl₄ as the solvent. NBS is a reagent that provides a low concentration of Br₂ for radical reactions. Benzoyl peroxide is a radical initiator. This reaction selectively brominates the benzylic position—the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring—because the intermediate benzylic radical is resonance-stabilized.\n*   **Product:** A hydrogen atom on the benzylic carbon (-CH₂- group) of the propyl chain is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Final Product Name:** The resulting structure has a propane main chain. At carbon-1, it is attached to a bromine atom and a (3-bromophenyl) group. Therefore, the name of the final product is **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
