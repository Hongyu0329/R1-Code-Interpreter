    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Concept of Rotational Symmetry**\nRotational symmetry describes how a shape or pattern looks the same after being rotated by a certain angle around a central point. The \"order\" of rotational symmetry is the number of times the pattern coincides with its original position during a full 360-degree rotation. For periodic tilings like the one shown, the only possible orders of rotational symmetry are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 (this is known as the crystallographic restriction theorem).\n\n**Step 2: Carefully Examine the Tiling Pattern**\nThe image shows a repeating pattern made up of tiles of three different shapes and colors:\n*   Dark blue, elongated hexagonal shapes.\n*   Light yellow square shapes.\n*   Orange rhombus (diamond) shapes.\nThese tiles are arranged in a regular, interlocking pattern that covers the entire plane.\n\n**Step 3: Identify a Potential Center of Rotation**\nTo find the rotational symmetry, we need to find a point in the pattern to rotate around. A good strategy is to look for a point that is the center of a highly symmetrical feature. In this tiling, the most prominent features are the 6-pointed star motifs.\n\n**Step 4: Test the Center of a Star Motif**\nLet's choose the central point of one of the star shapes as our potential center of rotation. These stars are formed by six orange rhombi all meeting at a single point.\n*   The arrangement of these six rhombi around the central point is perfectly symmetrical.\n*   Let's test for 6-fold rotational symmetry. This corresponds to a rotation by an angle of 360° / 6 = 60°.\n*   If we rotate the entire tiling by 60° around the center of the star:\n    *   The central star itself, being made of six identical, equally spaced parts, rotates onto its own footprint.\n    *   Observe the tiles immediately surrounding the star. There are six yellow squares and six blue elongated hexagons.\n    *   Upon a 60° rotation, each yellow square moves into the exact position previously occupied by the next yellow square.\n    *   Similarly, each blue shape moves into the exact position of the next blue shape.\n*   Since the entire local arrangement (and by extension, the infinite tiling) remains unchanged after a 60° rotation, the tiling possesses 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Rotational Symmetry**\nThe tiling has centers of 6-fold rotation. Since 6 is the highest possible order of rotational symmetry for a periodic tiling, and we have positively identified it, we can conclude that the rotational symmetry of the tiling is 6-fold. It's worth noting that any pattern with 6-fold symmetry will also look the same after rotations of 120° (3-fold) and 180° (2-fold) around the same center point. The tiling also has other points with 2-fold and 3-fold symmetry. However, when asked for \"the\" rotational symmetry of a pattern, the convention is to state the highest order present.\n\nFinal conclusion: The tiling has 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
