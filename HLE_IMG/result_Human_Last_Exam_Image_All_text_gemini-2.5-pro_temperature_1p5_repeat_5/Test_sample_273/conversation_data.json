    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the main chain and chiral centers.**\nFirst, we apply IUPAC nomenclature rules to identify the principal functional group and the longest carbon chain containing it. The amine group (-NH2) has higher priority than the hydroxyl group (-OH). We number the chain to give the carbon attached to the amine group the lowest possible number.\n\n1.  The carbon chain is numbered from right to left to give the -CH2NH2 group the locant 1.\n2.  The longest carbon chain containing this C1 is a 5-carbon chain (a pentane).\n3.  The substituents on this pentan-1-amine chain are:\n    *   A methyl group at C2.\n    *   An ethyl group at C3.\n    *   A hydroxyl group at C4.\n4.  The IUPAC name of the molecule is **3-ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-methylpentan-1-amine**.\n5.  Chiral centers are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. We identify them based on the structure:\n    *   **C2**: Bonded to H, -CH3, -CH2NH2, and the rest of the molecule (-CH(Et)CH(OH)CH3). These four groups are different, so C2 is a chiral center.\n    *   **C3**: Bonded to H, -CH2CH3 (ethyl), -CH(CH3)CH2NH2, and -CH(OH)CH3. These four groups are different, so C3 is a chiral center.\n    *   **C4**: Bonded to H, -OH, -CH3, and the rest of the molecule (-CH(Et)CH(CH3)CH2NH2). These four groups are different, so C4 is a chiral center.\n\nThe molecule has three chiral centers: C2, C3, and C4. We need to determine the configuration (R or S) for each.\n\n**Careful Point:** The drawing at C4 shows two dashed bonds (one to -OH and one to -CH3, which is C5). A tetrahedral carbon cannot be represented with two dashed bonds and one in-plane bond if the fourth bond (to an implicit H) is also to be in-plane. This is a likely drawing error. We will assume the stereochemistry is indicated for the substituent (-OH), and the bond to the terminal methyl group (C5) is a normal chain bond. In zig-zag chain drawings, if one substituent is shown with a wedge/dash, the implicit hydrogen is assumed to have the opposite stereochemistry. Therefore, at C4, since -OH is dashed (away), the implicit -H must be wedged (forward).\n\n**Step 2: Assign priorities using Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules for each chiral center.**\n\n**Configuration at C2:**\n*   **Groups:** -CH2NH2, -CH(Et)CH(OH)CH3, -CH3, -H.\n*   **Priorities:**\n    1.  **-CH2NH2**: The carbon is bonded to (N, H, H).\n    2.  **-CH(Et)CH(OH)CH3**: The carbon (C3) is bonded to (C, C, H).\n    3.  **-CH3**: The carbon is bonded to (H, H, H).\n    4.  **-H**.\n    *Comparing the first point of difference, N (atomic number 7) > C (6) > H (1). Thus, the priority order is: -CH2NH2 (1) > -CH(Et)CH(OH)CH3 (2) > -CH3 (3) > -H (4).*\n*   **Determination:**\n    *   In the drawing, the methyl group (priority 3) has a dashed bond (pointing away). Therefore, the implicit hydrogen (priority 4) must have a wedged bond (pointing forward).\n    *   The sequence from priority 1 to 2 to 3 is **clockwise**.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (-H) points forward, we reverse the rule. Clockwise corresponds to R, so the configuration is **S**.\n    *   **C2 is S.**\n\n**Configuration at C3:**\n*   **Groups:** -CH(OH)CH3, -CH(CH3)CH2NH2, -CH2CH3, -H.\n*   **Priorities:**\n    1.  **-CH(OH)CH3**: The carbon (C4) is attached to (O, C, H).\n    2.  **-CH(CH3)CH2NH2**: The carbon (C2) is attached to (C, C, H).\n    3.  **-CH2CH3**: The ethyl carbon is attached to (C, H, H).\n    4.  **-H**.\n    *Comparing the attached atoms, O > C. So, group 1 has the highest priority. Comparing groups 2 and 3, both have C as the first atom. We look at the next atoms: group 2 has (C, C, H) while group 3 has (C, H, H). Comparing these, C > H, so group 2 has higher priority than group 3. The final order is: -CH(OH)CH3 (1) > -CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (2) > -CH2CH3 (3) > -H (4).*\n*   **Determination:**\n    *   The ethyl group (priority 3) has a wedged bond (forward). Therefore, the implicit hydrogen (priority 4) must have a dashed bond (away).\n    *   The sequence from priority 1 to 2 to 3 is **counter-clockwise**.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (-H) points away, we use the rule directly. Counter-clockwise is **S**.\n    *   **C3 is S.**\n\n**Configuration at C4:**\n*   **Groups:** -OH, -CH(Et)CH(CH3)CH2NH2, -CH3, -H.\n*   **Priorities:**\n    1.  **-OH**: Oxygen has the highest atomic number.\n    2.  **-CH(Et)CH(CH3)CH2NH2**: Carbon bonded to other carbons.\n    3.  **-CH3**: Carbon bonded only to hydrogens.\n    4.  **-H**.\n    *The priority order is: -OH (1) > -CH(Et)CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (2) > -CH3 (3) > -H (4).*\n*   **Determination:**\n    *   As discussed, we interpret the drawing as -OH (priority 1) being dashed (away), and the implicit -H (priority 4) being wedged (forward).\n    *   The sequence from priority 1 (away) to 2 (in-plane, down-right) to 3 (in-plane, up-left) is **counter-clockwise**.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (-H) points forward, we reverse the rule. Counter-clockwise corresponds to S, so the configuration is **R**.\n    *   **C4 is R.**\n\n**Step 3: Combine the configurations.**\nThe absolute configuration of the molecule is the combination of the configurations at all chiral centers, listed in order of their locants.\n*   C2: S\n*   C3: S\n*   C4: R\n\nThe final absolute configuration is (2S, 3S, 4R).\n\n<<(2S, 3S, 4R)>>>"
