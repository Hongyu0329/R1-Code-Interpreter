The final answer is a chemical structure. It is the tris(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)methylium ion. The structure consists of a central carbon atom with a positive charge, which is bonded to the C1 position of three separate phenyl rings. Each of these phenyl rings bears two hydroxyl (-OH) groups, one at the C2 position and one at the C3 position.
