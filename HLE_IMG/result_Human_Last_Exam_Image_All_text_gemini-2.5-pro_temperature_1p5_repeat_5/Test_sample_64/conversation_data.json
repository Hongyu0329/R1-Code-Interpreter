    "*   **Step 1: Identify the structures shown in the images.**\n    The images L, M, and N display elongated, filamentous structures that are divided into compartments by cross-walls. These are characteristic features of fungal hyphae, which are the main mode of vegetative growth for most fungi.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the sequence or variation across the panels L, M, and N.**\n    Panel L shows a relatively straight and intact hypha. The arrow points to a septum, or cross-wall, between two cells, which appears normal.\n    In panel M, the hypha is bent. The arrow points to a septum where a distinct bulge or swelling is visible. The cell wall appears to have ruptured at this point, and the internal contents (cytoplasm) are being forced out.\n    Panel N shows a similar event to M, possibly at a more advanced stage or in a different hypha. The hypha is bent, and there is a significant bulge at the septum indicated by the arrow. This also represents a rupture of the cell wall.\n\n*   **Step 3: Interpret the biological process.**\n    The observed bulging and rupture of the cell wall, leading to the extrusion of cytoplasm, is a process known as **cell lysis** or **bursting**. This happens when the internal osmotic pressure (turgor pressure) of the cell becomes too great for the weakened cell wall to contain, causing it to break open. In this specific case, the lysis is occurring at the septa, indicating that this part of the cell wall is particularly weak or has been compromised.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the overall process.**\n    The images depict the process of **hyphal lysis** (or bursting) in a fungus. The arrowheads specifically highlight that this lysis is occurring at the septal pores, which are junctions between adjacent hyphal cells. This suggests a structural failure of the cell wall at these specific points.\n\n<<<Hyphal lysis (or bursting) at the septum.>>>"
