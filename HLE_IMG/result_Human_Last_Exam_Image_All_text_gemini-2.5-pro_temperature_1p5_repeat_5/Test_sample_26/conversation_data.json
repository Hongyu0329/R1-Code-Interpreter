    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Piece and Key:** The piece is the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8, Op. 13, known as the \"Pathétique\". The key signature is three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭), indicating the home key of C minor. All Roman numeral analysis will be relative to C minor.\n\n2.  **Locate Measure 30:** On the provided score, we can find measure 28 at the start of the second system. Counting forward, measure 30 is the third measure in that system. The measure is also highlighted within a hand-drawn circle on the image.\n\n3.  **Identify the Notes in Measure 30:** We need to look at all the notes being played in this measure to identify the harmony.\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays a chord on the first beat that is held throughout the measure (or at least its harmony is). The notes are G (on the lowest line of the staff), B-natural (the B♭ from the key signature is cancelled by a natural sign ♮), and D (on the middle line). These notes together form a G major triad (G-B♮-D).\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The right hand plays a fast passage of 32nd notes. The notes are G, E♮, F♯, G, repeated. The main melodic note is G, which is part of the G major chord. The E♮ and F♯ are embellishing non-chord tones (specifically, they function as an upper neighbor and a chromatic passing tone, respectively, leading back to G). The underlying harmony is defined by the stable chord in the left hand.\n\n4.  **Determine the Chord:** The core notes present in measure 30 are G, B♮, and D. This is a **G major chord**. The lowest note played is G, which is the root of the chord, so the chord is in root position.\n\n5.  **Relate the Chord to the Key of C Minor:**\n    *   The tonic of the key is C.\n    *   The fifth note of the C minor scale is G. This note is called the dominant.\n    *   In the natural C minor scale (C, D, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭), a triad built on G would be G-B♭-D, a G minor chord (v).\n    *   However, in tonal music, it is standard practice to raise the seventh degree of the minor scale to create a \"leading tone\" that pulls strongly back to the tonic. This creates the harmonic minor scale (C, D, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♮).\n    *   Using this raised seventh degree (B♮), the triad built on the dominant (G) becomes G-B♮-D, which is a G major chord.\n\n6.  **Assign the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   A chord built on the fifth degree of the scale is the dominant chord.\n    *   Since the chord is major, we use an uppercase Roman numeral.\n    *   Therefore, the G major chord functions as the dominant in the key of C minor, and its Roman numeral is **V**.\n    *   The context confirms this: measure 29 features a cadential 6/4 chord (i⁶⁴), leading into the V chord in measure 30, which then resolves to the tonic (i) in measure 31. This i⁶⁴ - V - i progression is a classic cadence.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Always check the key signature first (C minor).\n*   Pay close attention to accidentals (like the B-natural and F-sharp) that are not in the key signature. The B-natural is crucial for identifying the chord as major.\n*   Distinguish between chord tones and non-chord tones. The fast notes in the right hand are embellishments and do not change the fundamental harmony provided by the left hand.\n*   The function of a chord is determined by its relationship to the tonic key. A G major chord is V in C minor, but it would be I in G major or IV in D major, etc. Context is key.\n\n<<<V>>>"
