    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the full name of the artist.\n\n**Step 1: Locate the artist's signature**\nFirst, I will examine the provided image of the painting to find the artist's signature. The signature is typically found in one of the corners of the artwork. Looking at the full image, there is text visible in the bottom right corner. The cropped images, particularly the last one, provide a much clearer view of this area.\n\n**Step 2: Decipher the signature**\nIn the close-up view of the bottom right corner, a signature is clearly written. The name reads \"marquet\". Below the name, there appears to be some additional text and the number \"39\", likely indicating the year 1939.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the artist based on the signature**\nThe surname \"Marquet\" is the key piece of information. I will search for a notable painter with this surname who was active around 1939. The most prominent artist matching this description is Albert Marquet.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the artist and artwork**\nAlbert Marquet (1875–1947) was a French Fauvist painter known for his landscapes and seascapes. His style, characterized by a subdued color palette and a focus on light on water, is consistent with the painting shown. A comparison of the signature in the image with known examples of Albert Marquet's signature confirms that they match. Furthermore, searching for this specific artwork confirms it is a watercolor by Albert Marquet from 1939, often titled \"Le port de Pouldohan à marée basse\" or \"Vue de Pont-Croix\".\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the full name**\nBased on the signature and stylistic analysis, the artist who created this painting is Albert Marquet. The question asks for the full name of the artist.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe analysis confirms that the artist's full name is Albert Marquet.\n\n<<<Albert Marquet>>>"
