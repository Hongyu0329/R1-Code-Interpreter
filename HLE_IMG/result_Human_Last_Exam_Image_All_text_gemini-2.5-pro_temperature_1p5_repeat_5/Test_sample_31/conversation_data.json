    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the given knot.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Knot**\n\n1.  **Count the crossings:** First, we observe the provided knot diagram. By tracing the single continuous loop, we can count the number of times it crosses over or under itself. There are 8 distinct crossings in this diagram.\n2.  **Check if it's alternating:** An alternating knot diagram is one where, as you travel along the knot, the crossings alternate between over and under. Let's trace the path: starting from any point, the crossings are sequentially over, under, over, under, etc. The given diagram has this property.\n3.  **Identify the specific knot:** This knot is an alternating knot with 8 crossings. We can consult a knot table (like the Rolfsen knot table or online resources such as the Knot Atlas or KnotInfo) to identify it. The specific visual representation matches the standard diagram for the knot known as **8_18**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Rasmussen Invariant and its Properties**\n\n1.  **Definition:** The Rasmussen invariant, denoted as s(K) for a knot K, is a powerful integer invariant derived from a version of knot homology theory called Khovanov homology. It is always an even integer.\n2.  **Key Theorem for Alternating Knots:** A crucial theorem by Ozsváth, Rasmussen, and Szabó states that for any alternating knot K, its Rasmussen invariant is equal to its classical signature. That is:\n    *s(K) = σ(K)*\n3.  **Our Goal:** Since we have identified the knot as 8_18, which is alternating, our task is reduced to finding the signature of 8_18.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Signature of the Knot 8_18**\n\nThe signature, σ(K), can be calculated in several ways. One of the most straightforward methods, if the knot's polynomials are known, is to use the Conway polynomial.\n\n1.  **Conway Polynomial:** The Conway polynomial, ∇_K(z), is a knot invariant. For the knot 8_18, the Conway polynomial is known to be:\n    ∇(z) = 1 + 2z² - z⁴\n2.  **Relation between Signature and Conway Polynomial:** The signature of a knot is related to the second coefficient (the coefficient of z²) of its Conway polynomial. The formula is:\n    σ(K) = -2 * a₂(K)\n    where a₂(K) is the coefficient of the z² term in ∇_K(z).\n3.  **Calculation:**\n    *   From the polynomial ∇(z) = 1 + 2z² - z⁴, we can see that the coefficient a₂ is 2.\n    *   Plugging this into the formula: σ(8_18) = -2 * (2) = -4.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Rasmussen Invariant**\n\n1.  We established that for an alternating knot like 8_18, s(8_18) = σ(8_18).\n2.  We calculated that σ(8_18) = -4.\n3.  Therefore, the Rasmussen invariant of the knot 8_18 is -4.\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n\n*   **Knot Identification:** It is critical to correctly identify the knot from its diagram. The given image is the standard diagram of the 8_18 knot.\n*   **Applying the Correct Theorem:** The identity s(K) = σ(K) is only valid for alternating knots. It is essential to first confirm that the knot is alternating.\n*   **Correct Signature Calculation:** Using established data for the Conway polynomial and the correct formula (σ = -2a₂) ensures an accurate signature calculation. Relying on visual inspection to determine crossing signs can be error-prone.\n*   **Consistency Check:** The Rasmussen invariant must be an even integer. Our result, -4, is an even integer, which is consistent with the theory.\n\nFollowing these steps, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<< -4 >>>"
