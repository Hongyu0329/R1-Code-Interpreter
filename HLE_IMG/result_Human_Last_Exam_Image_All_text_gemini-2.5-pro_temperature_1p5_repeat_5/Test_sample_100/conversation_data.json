    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and the First Reaction**\n\n1.  **Structure of the Starting Material:** The starting material is a bicyclic compound containing a nitrogen atom protected with a para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group, a ketone (C=O), a carbon-carbon double bond, and a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group. The arrangement of the N and C=O groups indicates a bridged lactam structure. The most plausible structure is a derivative of 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, specifically, 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-(4-methoxybenzyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n\n2.  **Molecular Formula of the Starting Material:** Let's count the atoms:\n    *   Bicyclic core (C6H5N=O): C1(H), C4(H), C5(C), C6(H), C7(H2), N2, C3(O). This gives 6 C, 5 H, 1 N, 1 O.\n    *   Substituents:\n        *   Trifluoromethyl group (CF3): 1 C, 3 F.\n        *   para-Methoxybenzyl group (PMB, -CH2-C6H4-OCH3): 8 C, 9 H, 1 O.\n    *   Total count:\n        *   C: 6 (core) + 1 (CF3) + 8 (PMB) = 15\n        *   H: 5 (core) + 9 (PMB) = 14\n        *   F: 3\n        *   N: 1\n        *   O: 1 (ketone) + 1 (PMB) = 2\n    *   Molecular Formula of Starting Material: **C15H14F3NO2**\n\n3.  **Reaction 1: CAN, ACN/H2O → Intermediate 1**\n    *   Reagent: Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) is a strong oxidizing agent used for the cleavage of PMB protecting groups from nitrogen and oxygen atoms.\n    *   Transformation: The PMB group is removed from the nitrogen, and it is replaced by a hydrogen atom.\n    *   Change in Molecular Formula: We remove the PMB group (C8H9O) and add one Hydrogen (H).\n    *   Calculation:\n        *   Starting: C15H14F3NO2\n        *   Subtract PMB group: - C8H9O\n        *   Add H atom: + H\n        *   Net change: -C8H8O\n    *   Molecular Formula of Intermediate 1: C(15-8) H(14-8) F3 N(1) O(2-1) = **C7H6F3NO**\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Second Reaction**\n\n1.  **Reaction 2: Intermediate 1 → Intermediate 2 (Pd/C, H2)**\n    *   Reagent: Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas (H2) is a standard catalyst for catalytic hydrogenation.\n    *   Transformation: This reaction reduces carbon-carbon double bonds. The C=C bond in the bicyclic system of Intermediate 1 will be saturated.\n    *   Change in Molecular Formula: One molecule of H2 is added across the double bond.\n    *   Calculation:\n        *   Starting from Intermediate 1: C7H6F3NO\n        *   Add H2: + 2H\n    *   Molecular Formula of Intermediate 2: **C7H8F3NO**\n    *   Structure of Intermediate 2: 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Third Reaction**\n\n1.  **Reaction 3: Intermediate 2 → Product (4 N HCl, 70 °C)**\n    *   Reagent: Hot aqueous acid (4 N HCl at 70 °C).\n    *   Transformation: These are conditions for the hydrolysis of an amide or lactam. Intermediate 2 is a bicyclic lactam. The acid catalyzes the addition of a water molecule across the amide (C-N) bond, causing the ring to open.\n    *   Change in Molecular Formula: One molecule of water (H2O) is consumed in the hydrolysis reaction.\n    *   Calculation:\n        *   Starting from Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO\n        *   Add H2O: + H2O\n    *   Molecular Formula of the Product: C(7) H(8+2) F3 N(1) O(1+1) = **C7H10F3NO2**\n\n**Final Product Structure and Formula Confirmation**\n\n*   The hydrolysis of the bicyclic lactam (Intermediate 2) opens the N2-C3 bond. This results in an amino acid with a cyclopentane core.\n*   The product is 4-amino-3-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid (the exact numbering and stereochemistry are not required for the formula).\n*   Let's count the atoms in this final structure to verify:\n    *   C: 1 (in -COOH) + 5 (in cyclopentane ring) + 1 (in -CF3) = 7\n    *   H: 1 (in -COOH) + 2 (in -NH2) + 7 (on the cyclopentane ring) = 10\n    *   F: 3 (in -CF3)\n    *   N: 1 (in -NH2)\n    *   O: 2 (in -COOH)\n*   The calculated formula **C7H10F3NO2** is consistent with the product structure.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
