    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the types of pericyclic reactions involved.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Reactant 1:** Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆). This is an aromatic compound with a cyclic, conjugated system of 6 π-electrons.\n*   **Reactant 2:** Cyclobutene (C₄H₆). This is a cyclic alkene with a 2 π-electron system.\n*   **Condition:** The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hv` (light). This is a crucial piece of information as it dictates which pericyclic reactions are allowed according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n*   **Information from the question:** The problem explicitly states that \"Two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur\".\n\n**Step 2: Propose Plausible Mechanistic Pathways**\nThere are two primary, well-established photochemical pathways for the reaction of a benzene derivative with an alkene. Both pathways involve two pericyclic steps.\n\n**Pathway A:**\n1.  **Initial [2+2] Cycloaddition:** The first step is an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition between one of the double bonds of hexafluorobenzene (acting as a 2π component) and the double bond of cyclobutene (also a 2π component). According to Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [π2s + π2s] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed.\n    *   **Reaction 1: [2+2] Cycloaddition.**\n    *   This reaction forms an intermediate, a hexafluorobicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene derivative.\n\n2.  **Subsequent Electrocyclic Reaction:** The intermediate formed in the first step contains a 1,3-cyclohexadiene moiety. This is a conjugated 4π-electron system. Under photochemical conditions, a 4π-electron system can undergo a concerted electrocyclic ring closure. This is a photochemically allowed process (conrotatory).\n    *   **Reaction 2: Electrocyclic Reaction.**\n    *   This cyclization forms the final tricyclic product.\n\n**Pathway B:**\n1.  **Initial Valence Isomerization:** Hexafluorobenzene itself undergoes a photochemical reaction first. Benzene and its derivatives are known to isomerize to valence isomers under UV light. A common isomer is Dewar benzene. For hexafluorobenzene, this yields hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (hexafluoro-bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This intramolecular transformation can be classified as a 4π-electron electrocyclic reaction, which is photochemically allowed. The stability of hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene makes this a particularly plausible first step.\n    *   **Reaction 1: Electrocyclic Reaction.**\n\n2.  **Subsequent [2+2] Cycloaddition:** The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, has two isolated double bonds. It can then react with cyclobutene in an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition. This is a reaction between two 2π systems, which is photochemically allowed.\n    *   **Reaction 2: [2+2] Cycloaddition.**\n    *   This reaction would form a complex, tetracyclic cage compound as the final product.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Types of Pericyclic Reactions**\nBoth plausible pathways, A and B, involve the same two fundamental types of pericyclic reactions, just in a different order.\n*   One reaction is a **[2+2] cycloaddition**, where two π bonds react to form a four-membered ring.\n*   The other reaction is an **electrocyclic reaction**, specifically the cyclization of a 4π-electron system.\n\n**Careful Point on the Product Structure:**\nThe structure of the final product drawn in the image (a linearly fused tricyclic C8 skeleton) does not seem to match the expected C10 product from the reaction of C₆F₆ and C₄H₆. The drawing is likely erroneous or highly stylized. However, the question asks for the *types* of reactions involved, which can be determined reliably from the reactants and conditions, regardless of the accuracy of the product's depiction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe transformation involves two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions. Based on the analysis of possible mechanistic pathways for the given reactants and conditions, these two reactions are a [2+2] cycloaddition and an electrocyclic reaction.\n\n<<<[2+2] cycloaddition and electrocyclic reaction>>>"
