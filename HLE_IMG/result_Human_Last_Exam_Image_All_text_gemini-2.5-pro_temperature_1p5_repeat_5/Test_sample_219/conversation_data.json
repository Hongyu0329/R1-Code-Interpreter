    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph**\nThe provided image is a raster plot.\n*   The **x-axis** represents **Time in seconds (s)**, ranging from 0 to 50 seconds.\n*   The **y-axis** represents the **Electrode Number**, ranging from 0 to 128.\n*   Each **black dot** represents an action potential (a \"spike\" or \"firing\") detected by a specific electrode at a specific point in time.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts**\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a period where many neurons fire action potentials in a coordinated manner over a short duration. Visually, these bursts appear as dense vertical bands in the raster plot, as activity is high across many electrodes (y-axis) at roughly the same time (x-axis).\nBy inspecting the graph, we can visually identify four distinct synchronized bursts.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Timestamp of Each Burst**\nWe need to estimate the time at which each burst begins (its onset). We can do this by reading the corresponding value on the x-axis for the start of each dense vertical band.\n*   **Burst 1:** The first burst starts shortly after t=0 s. A reasonable estimate for its onset is **t₁ ≈ 2 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The second burst occurs between t=10 s and t=20 s. It appears to begin just past the midpoint, at approximately **t₂ ≈ 16 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** The third burst is between t=30 s and t=40 s. Its onset appears to be slightly before the midpoint (35 s), at approximately **t₃ ≈ 34 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** The fourth burst is visible near the end of the recording, between t=40 s and t=50 s. It seems to start at approximately **t₄ ≈ 48 s**.\n\nSo, the timestamps of the synchronized bursts are approximately 2 s, 16 s, 34 s, and 48 s.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between the onsets of consecutive bursts. With four bursts, we can calculate three intervals.\n*   **Interval 1 (IBI₁):** The time between Burst 1 and Burst 2.\n    IBI₁ = t₂ - t₁ = 16 s - 2 s = 14 s.\n*   **Interval 2 (IBI₂):** The time between Burst 2 and Burst 3.\n    IBI₂ = t₃ - t₂ = 34 s - 16 s = 18 s.\n*   **Interval 3 (IBI₃):** The time between Burst 3 and Burst 4.\n    IBI₃ = t₄ - t₃ = 48 s - 34 s = 14 s.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual intervals and divide by the number of intervals.\n*   Average IBI = (IBI₁ + IBI₂ + IBI₃) / 3\n*   Average IBI = (14 s + 18 s + 14 s) / 3\n*   Average IBI = 46 s / 3\n*   Average IBI ≈ 15.333... s\n\n**Step 6: Round to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question asks for the answer to be expressed to two significant figures.\n*   The calculated value is 15.333... s.\n*   The first two significant figures are '1' and '5'.\n*   The third digit is '3', which is less than 5, so we round down.\n*   The final answer is 15 s.\n\n<<<15>>>"
