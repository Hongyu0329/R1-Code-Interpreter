    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to determine the total number of unique mRNA splice species based on the provided RT-PCR results. A splice species is a distinct mRNA molecule formed by a unique combination of exons after splicing.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Experimental Setup:**\n    *   **Method:** Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is used to amplify RNA transcripts present in samples A-F.\n    *   **Primers:** Different pairs of forward and reverse primers are used to target different regions of the transcripts.\n    *   **Key Primers:**\n        *   **General Primers:** E1F1 is a general forward primer located in the E1 exon.\n        *   **Splice-Junction-Specific Primers:** E1F2 and E1F3 are special forward primers designed to span (and thus only amplify) specific splice junctions: 929^3465 for E1F2 and 929^3506 for E1F3. These junctions represent different choices for splicing out the first major intron starting at nucleotide 929.\n\n3.  **Identify Evidence of Alternative Splicing:** Multiple bands produced from a single primer pair in a single sample lane are direct evidence of alternative splicing, indicating the presence of multiple splice species.\n\n4.  **Systematic Panel-by-Panel Analysis:**\n    *   **Panel I (E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles):** This is the most informative experiment due to the higher cycle count (increased sensitivity). It reveals four distinct bands with sizes 450, 419, 378, and 187 bp. This indicates there are at least **four distinct splice species** that extend from the E1 region to the L1 region and can be amplified by this general primer pair. Let's refer to them as Species 1 (450 bp), Species 2 (419 bp), Species 3 (378 bp), and Species 4 (187 bp).\n\n    *   **Panel G (E1F3/L2R, 30 cycles):** This experiment uses the E1F3 primer, which is specific for transcripts containing the 929^3506 splice. Two bands are observed: 1,003 bp and 931 bp. This means there are **two distinct splice species** that share the 929^3506 splice but differ in their downstream splicing pattern. Let's call them Species 5 (1,003 bp) and Species 6 (931 bp). Since these species are defined by the 929^3506 splice, they are fundamentally different from species that use another splice site.\n\n    *   **Panel D (E1F2/E5R) and F (E1F2/L2R):** These experiments use the E1F2 primer, specific for the 929^3465 splice. Both produce a single band. Comparing the product sizes to those from other panels (like B, C, H, I), it can be deduced that these products correspond to Species 2 (the 419 bp species from Panel I). This confirms that Species 2 is defined by the 929^3465 splice.\n\n5.  **Synthesize Findings and Count Unique Species:**\n    *   We have identified 4 species from Panel I (S1, S2, S3, S4).\n    *   We have identified 2 species from Panel G (S5, S6).\n    *   Now, we must determine if there is any overlap. A single transcript can have only one 5' splice site at a given position. Therefore, a transcript with the 929^3465 splice (like S2) cannot be the same as a transcript with the 929^3506 splice (like S5 or S6). The splice choice is mutually exclusive.\n    *   This means Species 5 and Species 6 are distinct from Species 2. They are also distinct from Species 1, 3, and 4, as these are part of a different family of transcripts defined by the general E1F1 primer and differentiated by size in the L1 region.\n    *   Therefore, the 4 species from Panel I and the 2 species from Panel G are all unique. This gives a running total of 4 + 2 = 6 species.\n\n6.  **Verify with Remaining Panels:**\n    *   **Panel E (E1F1/L2R):** This shows a single band of 1,005 bp. The size is extremely close to the 1,003 bp band of Species 5 from Panel G. Since Panel E uses the general E1F1 primer, it's plausible it is detecting the more abundant of the two 929^3506 splice forms (Species 5), with the minor 2 bp difference being due to primer positioning. The less abundant Species 6 might not be visible at 20 cycles. Thus, Panel E does not introduce a new species but corroborates the existence of Species 5.\n    *   **Panels B, C, H:** These panels show two bands corresponding to the two most abundant species, Species 1 and Species 2. This is consistent with our model.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy systematically analyzing all the RT-PCR results and cross-referencing the species identified by general and splice-specific primers, we can identify a total of 6 distinct splice species.\n\n*   **Four species** are identified by the general primer pair E1F1/L1R (Panel I).\n    *   One of these is confirmed to use the 929^3465 splice site.\n*   **Two species** are identified by the specific primer pair E1F3/L2R (Panel G).\n    *   Both of these use the 929^3506 splice site, making them distinct from the previous group.\n\nThe total number of unique splice species found is 4 + 2 = 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
