    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the musical elements:**\n    *   **Time Signature:** 4/4 time, also known as common time. This is indicated by the \"C\" symbol at the beginning, although it's handwritten and looks more like 4/4.\n    *   **Key Signature:** There are no sharps or flats in the key signature, which indicates the key of C major or A minor.\n    *   **Chord Progression:** The piece starts on a C major chord. The progression in the first few bars is C -> E7 -> F -> F#dim -> G7. This use of a secondary dominant (E7, which is the V7 of A minor, the relative minor) and a chromatic passing diminished chord (F#dim) is very common in early jazz and swing music. The progression leads strongly back to the tonic, C.\n    *   **Melody and Rhythm:** The melody is heavily syncopated, with many eighth notes and some sixteenth notes. The phrasing, with its arpeggiated figures and rhythmic accents, is highly characteristic of a specific jazz idiom.\n    *   **Structure:** The piece uses standard musical notation for form, including repeat signs, a Dal Segno (D.S.) sign, and instructions for a Coda (\"TO GO OUT - TAKE D.S. TO CODA\"). This structure is common in popular and jazz music.\n\n2.  **Identify the Musical Style:**\n    *   The combination of the chord progression (characteristic of the 1920s-1940s \"Tin Pan Alley\" and jazz eras), the syncopated rhythm, and the improvisatory-sounding melodic lines points strongly to **Jazz**.\n    *   More specifically, the particular melodic vocabulary and rhythmic drive are hallmarks of **Gypsy Jazz** (also known as Jazz Manouche), a style pioneered in France by guitarist Django Reinhardt. This arrangement is clearly written in that style.\n\n3.  **Identify the Title:**\n    *   The melodic and harmonic content can be used to identify the specific tune.\n    *   The opening melody (after the pickup) over the C chord, moving to the chromatic run D-E-F-F# over the E7 chord, is the signature melodic phrase of the jazz standard **\"Limehouse Blues\"**.\n    *   The chord progression C | E7 | F | F#dim | C/G G7 | C is the classic A-section harmony for \"Limehouse Blues\" when played in the key of C. The sheet music provided follows this exact progression.\n\n4.  **Identify the Country of Origin:**\n    *   A search for the origin of the song \"Limehouse Blues\" reveals that it was written in 1921.\n    *   The music was composed by **Philip Braham**, and the lyrics were written by **Douglas Furber**.\n    *   Both composers were British, and the song premiered in the 1922 London musical revue *A to Z*.\n    *   Therefore, the song's country of origin is the **United Kingdom**. Although it became a major jazz standard and is closely associated with American jazz and French Gypsy Jazz, its origin is British.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Title:** Based on the melody and chord progression, the song is \"Limehouse Blues\".\n*   **Musical Style:** The arrangement presented in the sheet music is in the style of Gypsy Jazz or Jazz Manouche.\n*   **Country of Origin:** The song \"Limehouse Blues\" was composed in the United Kingdom.\n\n<<<**Title:** \"Limehouse Blues\"\n**Musical Style:** Gypsy Jazz (or Jazz Manouche/Swing)\n**Country of Origin:** United Kingdom>>>"
