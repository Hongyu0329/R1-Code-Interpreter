The high regioselectivity observed in Reaction 3 is due to the inherent asymmetry of the 1,3-dipole intermediate (münchnone) formed from N-acetylproline. The two termini of this dipole are electronically and sterically distinct: one is a carbon substituted with a methyl group (from the acetyl group), and the other is a carbon substituted with a hydrogen (the α-carbon of the proline ring). This significant difference between the termini leads to a kinetically controlled cycloaddition, where one orientation of addition with the unsymmetrical alkyne is overwhelmingly favored, resulting in the formation of a single regioisomeric product (Product B).

The results from Reactions 1 and 2 provide the key context for this conclusion. In those reactions, the dipole is derived from N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine. Its termini are very similar (both are methyl-substituted carbons), which leads to a lack of kinetic regioselectivity in the cycloaddition, as confirmed by the labelling experiment in Reaction 2. The fact that Reaction 1 yields a single product is a result of thermodynamic equilibration, not kinetic control. By demonstrating what happens when the dipole is nearly symmetric, Reactions 1 and 2 highlight that the high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 must stem from the opposite situation: a highly asymmetric dipole.
