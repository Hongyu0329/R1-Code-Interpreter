    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak Cluster**\nThe peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) represent the molecular ion and its isotopologues. We observe a prominent cluster of peaks starting at m/z 258 and continuing at 260, 262, 264, and 266.\n-   m/z 258 (I = 17.4%)\n-   m/z 260 (I = 34.8%)\n-   m/z 262 (I = 29.0%)\n-   m/z 264 (I = 12.9%)\nThe complex pattern with peaks separated by 2 mass units is characteristic of a molecule containing multiple heavy halogen atoms, specifically bromine (isotopes ⁷⁹Br and ⁸¹Br, ~1:1 ratio) and chlorine (isotopes ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl, ~3:1 ratio).\nThe peak at the lowest mass in this cluster, m/z 258, corresponds to the molecular ion containing the most abundant (lightest) isotopes of all elements. According to the nitrogen rule, an even-numbered molecular ion mass suggests the absence or an even number of nitrogen atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Base Peak and Identify Key Fragments**\nThe base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum, which defines 100% relative intensity.\n-   **Base Peak:** The base peak is at **m/z 225** (I = 100%).\n-   This peak is part of a distinct isotopic cluster with significant peaks at **m/z 223** (I = 60.1%) and **m/z 227** (I = 66.7%).\n-   The intensity ratio of the peaks at m/z 223 : 225 : 227 is approximately 60 : 100 : 67. This pattern is very close to the theoretical 1:2:1 ratio expected for a fragment containing **two bromine atoms**. This is one of the most informative features of the spectrum.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Molecular Formula**\nLet's correlate the molecular ion with the base peak fragment. The base peak [RBr₂]⁺ is formed by fragmentation of the molecular ion M⁺.\n-   Mass of the molecular ion (lightest isotopes): M⁺ = 258.\n-   Mass of the base peak fragment (lightest isotopes, i.e., two ⁷⁹Br atoms): [R⁷⁹Br₂]⁺ = 223.\n-   The mass difference is 258 - 223 = 35 Da. This mass corresponds precisely to the lighter isotope of chlorine, **³⁵Cl**.\n-   This implies that the fragmentation pathway involves the loss of a chlorine atom from the molecular ion: M⁺˙ → [M-Cl]⁺ + Cl˙.\n-   This confirms the molecule contains at least one chlorine atom and two bromine atoms.\n-   Further confirmation for chlorine comes from the fragment at **m/z 47** (I = 18.4%) and **m/z 49** (I = 6.24%). The ~3:1 intensity ratio is the classic signature of a [CCl]⁺ fragment ([C³⁵Cl]⁺ and [C³⁷Cl]⁺).\n-   Now, we can find the mass of the non-halogen part of the molecule (the R group). From the [R⁷⁹Br₂]⁺ fragment at m/z 223, the mass of R is 223 - (2 × 79) = 223 - 158 = 65 Da. A hydrocarbon fragment with a mass of 65 Da corresponds to **C₅H₅** (5 × 12 + 5 × 1 = 65).\n-   Combining these parts, the molecular formula of the compound is **C₅H₅ClBr₂**.\n\n**Step 4: Propose a Structure and Determine the IUPAC Name**\n1.  **Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU):** For a formula CₐHᵦN_cO_d_X_e (where X is a halogen), the DoU = a - b/2 - e/2 + c/2 + 1. For C₅H₅ClBr₂, the DoU = 5 - 5/2 - 3/2 + 1 = 5 - 8/2 + 1 = 5 - 4 + 1 = 2. A DoU of 2 indicates the presence of one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds, etc. A cyclopentene structure (1 ring + 1 double bond) has a DoU of 2 and fits this requirement.\n\n2.  **Fragmentation Analysis:** The most prominent fragmentation is the loss of a chlorine atom. This is a highly favorable process if the cleavage results in a very stable cation. The cleavage of an allylic C-Cl bond (a C-Cl bond on a carbon adjacent to a C=C double bond) produces a resonance-stabilized allylic cation. This is a much more favorable pathway than breaking a stronger vinylic (on the double bond) or alkyl C-Cl bond.\n\n3.  **Structure Proposal:** Based on the above, the most plausible structure is a cyclopentene ring substituted with two bromine atoms and one chlorine atom, where the chlorine is at an allylic position.\n\n4.  **IUPAC Naming:**\n    - The parent structure is cyclopentene.\n    - The double bond receives the lowest possible locants, 1 and 2.\n    - The substituents are listed alphabetically: bromo, chloro.\n    - To get the lowest possible locant set for the substituents, we should place them at positions 1, 2, and 3.\n    - According to IUPAC rules, when there is a choice, the substituent cited first alphabetically (bromo) receives the lowest number.\n    - This leads to the name: **1,2-dibromo-3-chlorocyclopent-1-ene**.\n\nThis structure is consistent with all the major features of the mass spectrum:\n-   Molecular formula: C₅H₅ClBr₂ (MW of lightest isotopes = 258).\n-   Presence of 1 Cl and 2 Br atoms.\n-   A structure that explains the facile loss of Cl to form a stable cation, resulting in the base peak.\n\n<<<1,2-dibromo-3-chlorocyclopent-1-ene>>>"
