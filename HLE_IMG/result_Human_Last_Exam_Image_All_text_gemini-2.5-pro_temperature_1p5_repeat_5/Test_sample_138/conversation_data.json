    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair. The question provides a key piece of information: the insects are from taxa without scopae (pollen-carrying hairs) on their legs. We will use common sexual dimorphism traits in Hymenoptera (bees and wasps) to identify the sexes.\n\n**General Rules for Sexing Bees and Wasps:**\n*   **Antennae:** Males generally have longer antennae with more segments (13 in most male bees/wasps vs. 12 in females). In some groups, the tips are curled in males.\n*   **Abdomen:** Females have an ovipositor (stinger), which can make the abdomen tip look pointed. Males have a more rounded or blunt abdominal tip and often have one more visible abdominal segment than females (7 vs. 6).\n*   **Face:** In many bee and wasp species, males have yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus), which are absent or reduced in females.\n*   **Legs:** Males may have modified legs, but they lack pollen-collecting structures (scopae). Females in many bee families have scopae, but the question specifies these taxa lack them on the legs.\n\n**Analysis of Pair A:**\n*   These are cuckoo bees, most likely of the genus *Coelioxys*. Cuckoo bees are kleptoparasites, meaning they lay their eggs in the nests of other bees. As they do not collect pollen to provision their own nests, females lack scopae, fitting the question's description.\n*   **Insect A (left):** This individual has a very long, sharply pointed, conical abdomen. This is the sheath for the ovipositor, a characteristic feature of a female *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Insect A (right):** This individual's abdomen is less tapered and ends in a set of distinct spines rather than a single sharp point. This abdominal structure is characteristic of a male *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Female, Right is Male (F, M). This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair B:**\n*   These are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. Wasps do not have scopae for pollen collection, fitting the description.\n*   **Insect B (left):** The most telling feature is the antennae. The tips of the antennae are distinctly curled downwards/backwards. This is a classic identifying feature of male paper wasps.\n*   **Insect B (right):** This individual's antennae are straight, lacking the curl at the tip. This is characteristic of a female paper wasp.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair C:**\n*   These appear to be long-horned bees (tribe Eucerini). Here, the question's constraint (\"without scopae on their legs\") is slightly problematic as female long-horned bees typically have very large scopae on their hind legs. However, males lack scopae, and the visual evidence for sexual dimorphism is extremely strong, so we will rely on those features. It's possible the question intends to focus on groups where females don't have *leg* scopae (like Megachilid bees with abdominal scopae) or are kleptoparasitic, and this pair is included based on the male's characteristics and the strong dimorphism.\n*   **Insect C (left):** This bee has exceptionally long antennae, significantly longer than its head is wide. It also has a prominent yellow patch on its face (the clypeus). Both of these are definitive characteristics of a male long-horned bee.\n*   **Insect C (right):** This bee has much shorter antennae, typical for a female. Its face is dark, lacking the yellow clypeus of the male. Its body is also broader and more robust. These are all characteristics of a female long-horned bee.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Despite the ambiguity of the \"no scopae\" rule for the female, the visual evidence is overwhelming. Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Final Answer Compilation:**\n*   Pair A: F, M -> Index 4\n*   Pair B: M, F -> Index 3\n*   Pair C: M, F -> Index 3\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of indices for A, B, and C.\n\n<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
