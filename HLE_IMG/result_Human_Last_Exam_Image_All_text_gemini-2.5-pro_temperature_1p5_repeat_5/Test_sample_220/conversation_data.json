    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct crystal lattice pattern.\n\n**1. Understand the Target Structure and Viewing Direction**\nThe question asks to identify the pattern of a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure when viewed along the [110] direction. This means we are looking at the projection of the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to the [110] vector.\n\n**2. Theoretical Pattern for FCC viewed along [110]**\n*   **FCC Structure:** An FCC unit cell has atoms at the 8 corners and at the center of the 6 faces.\n*   **Projection:** When the atoms of an FCC lattice are projected onto the (110) plane (the plane perpendicular to the [110] viewing direction), they form a specific repeating pattern.\n*   **The Pattern:** This projection results in a **centered rectangular lattice**.\n*   **Dimensions:** The unit cell of this 2D projected lattice is a rectangle. The sides of this rectangle are aligned with the [001] and [1-10] crystallographic directions. If 'a' is the lattice constant of the FCC cube, the side lengths of the projected rectangle are 'a' and 'a√2'.\n*   **Key Feature (Aspect Ratio):** The crucial feature to identify the correct pattern is the aspect ratio of this rectangle, which is (a√2) / a = **√2 ≈ 1.414** or its inverse a / (a√2) = **1/√2 ≈ 0.707**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Given Options**\nWe need to find the image that shows a centered rectangular pattern with an aspect ratio close to 1.414 or 0.707.\n\n*   **Image A:** This image displays a pattern that can be interpreted as a centered rectangle. Let's find the dimensions of the rectangle formed by the atoms in the front layer:\n    *   Horizontal width (W) ≈ 3.5 - 1 = 2.5 units.\n    *   Vertical height (H) ≈ 12.5 - 6.5 = 6 units.\n    *   Aspect Ratio = H/W = 6 / 2.5 = 2.4. This value is very far from √2 ≈ 1.414. Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Image B:** The atoms are arranged in a pattern with clear hexagonal symmetry. This hexagonal arrangement is characteristic of an FCC lattice viewed along the [111] direction or an HCP lattice viewed along the [0001] direction. It is not the pattern for a [110] view. Therefore, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Image C:** The atomic arrangement is less obvious. We can identify groups of atoms forming squares (e.g., from (4,7) to (9,12) gives a 5x5 unit square). A square has an aspect ratio of 1. This does not match the required ratio of √2. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Image D:** This image clearly shows a **centered rectangular pattern**. Let's analyze the dimensions of a unit rectangle.\n    *   Consider the rectangle formed by atoms at coordinates (1, 6), (5, 6), (1, 9), and (5, 9).\n    *   Horizontal width (W) = 5 - 1 = 4 units.\n    *   Vertical height (H) = 9 - 6 = 3 units.\n    *   This rectangle has a centering atom at (3, 7.5), which matches the geometric center ((1+5)/2, (6+9)/2).\n    *   Now, let's check the aspect ratio: W/H = 4/3 ≈ 1.333.\n    *   Comparing this to the theoretical value: 1.333 is very close to √2 ≈ 1.414. The small difference (~6%) is well within the tolerance for a schematic diagram. Alternatively, H/W = 3/4 = 0.75, which is very close to 1/√2 ≈ 0.707.\n\n**Conclusion**\nFigure D is the only option that displays a centered rectangular pattern with an aspect ratio consistent with the theoretical projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
