    "The small, black organisms growing on top of the shelf fungus are a type of parasitic mold. Specifically, they are a pin mold, most likely belonging to the species *Spinellus fusiger*, commonly known as Bonnet Mould.\n\nThese types of fungi are characterized by their erect, stalk-like structures called sporangiophores, which are topped by a spherical, spore-containing structure known as a sporangium. This gives them an appearance similar to tiny pins stuck into the host fungus.\n\n*Spinellus fusiger* is a common parasite that grows on various types of mushrooms, including the polypore (shelf fungus) seen in the image. It is widespread and can be found across Europe, Asia, and North America. This mold is not part of the larger fungus but is a separate organism using the host fungus for nutrients.\n\n<<<Spinellus fusiger>>>"
