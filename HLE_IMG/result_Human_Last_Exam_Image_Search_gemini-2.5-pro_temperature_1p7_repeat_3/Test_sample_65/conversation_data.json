    "Based on the distinctive braided, rope-like appearance of the stems, the plant shown in the image belongs to the genus **Pterigynandrum**.\n\nThis moss is commonly known as catkin-moss or capillary wing-moss. Its key identifying feature is the sleek, braided appearance of its stems, which are formed by the arrangement of its leaves. The colonies often have a brownish color at the base with greener tips, just as depicted in the image. While several other moss genera can have a braided or catkin-like look, the specific slender, down-curved, and rope-like branches are characteristic of *Pterigynandrum*.\n\n<<<Pterigynandrum>>>"
