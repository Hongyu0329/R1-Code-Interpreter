    "This painting is \"Inventos y recuerdos\" (Inventions and Memories) by the Spanish surrealist painter José Hernández (1944-2013).\n\nThe artwork features a room with several surreal elements. On the left, a large opening reveals a barren landscape with a sheer cliff of ice and a hot air balloon floating in the sky. Inside the room, a young girl sits on the floor reading books, while others beside her are on fire in front of an empty fireplace. Above the mantelpiece, a mirror reflects a clear blue sky. Another doorway shows the ocean waves rolling into a hallway and onto the room's wooden floor. A picture of the Leaning Tower of Pisa hangs crookedly on the wall, making the tower appear straight. A large, green-wreathed head of a statue is partially visible through another opening.\n\n<<<José Hernández>>>"
