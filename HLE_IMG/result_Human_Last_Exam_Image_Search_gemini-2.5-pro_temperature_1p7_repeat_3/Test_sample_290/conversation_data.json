    "Based on the visual evidence in the image, this photo was taken at Golden Gardens Park in Seattle, Washington.\n\nThe key features that identify the location are:\n*   **Beach Bonfires**: Golden Gardens is one of only two parks in Seattle where beach bonfires are permitted in designated fire pits. This activity is very popular, especially at sunset. In 2022, the beach fire season started on May 28th.\n*   **The View**: The image shows a large body of water (Puget Sound) with a forested landmass across it, which is characteristic of the view from Golden Gardens looking towards the Kitsap Peninsula.\n*   **The Setting**: The photo is taken from a slightly elevated position behind a chain-link fence, looking down onto the beach. This perspective matches the layout of Golden Gardens Park, where a road and pedestrian path run alongside and slightly above the beach area.\n\n<<<Seattle>>>"
