    "The alkaloid compound shown in the image is Matrine.\n\nMatrine is a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid. It is found in plants from the Fabaceae family, particularly from the *Sophora* genus. For centuries, it has been used in traditional Chinese medicine and can be extracted from the herb *Sophora flavescens*.\n\nThis compound has various pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and neuroprotective properties. It also acts as an agonist for both κ-opioid and μ-opioid receptors. Additionally, Matrine and a related compound, oxymatrine, have been shown to be effective as a nematicide against the pine wood nematode and as a toxin against the Formosan subterranean termite.\n\nThe chemical formula for Matrine is C₁₅H₂₄N₂O. It belongs to the matrine-family of alkaloids, which are studied for their potential as versatile precursors for developing new bioactive compounds. Research has explored modifying the structure of matrine to enhance its therapeutic properties.\n\n<<<Matrine>>>"
