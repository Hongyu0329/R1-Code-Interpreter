    "This image displays the crystal structure of the protein **Parkin**. Specifically, it shows the protein in a compact, autoinhibited state. This particular representation corresponds to the entry **4K95** in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).\n\nParkin is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, an enzyme that plays a critical role in the process of ubiquitination, which marks other proteins for degradation. Mutations in the gene that encodes Parkin (*PARK2*) are a major cause of autosomal recessive juvenile-onset Parkinson's disease.\n\nThe structure consists of several domains:\n*   **Ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain:** Shown in light blue.\n*   **RING/IBR/RING (RBR) domains:** The larger core of the protein, shown in dark blue, which contains RING0, RING1, IBR (In-Between-RING), and RING2.\n\nIn this inhibited conformation, the protein's activity is suppressed through interactions between its own domains. Activation requires conformational changes that expose the enzyme's active sites.\n\n<<<Parkin>>>"
