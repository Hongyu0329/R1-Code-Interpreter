    "Based on the intricate, net-like, and darkly pigmented appearance of the epiphyte growing flat against the tree bark, it is characteristic of a leafy liverwort from the genus *Frullania*.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the identification:\n*   **Appearance:** Species of *Frullania* often form distinctive dark, reddish-brown to nearly black circular patches that are closely pressed to the bark of trees. The growth pattern consists of tiny, overlapping scale-like leaves that create a radiating, web-like or reticulated pattern, matching the image.\n*   **Habitat:** *Frullania* are common epiphytes, growing harmlessly on the bark of various trees where humidity is high.\n*   **Color Change:** These liverworts can be green in the summer but often turn a dark, purplish-black color as it gets colder, making them more noticeable.\n\nWhile it can be confused with other bryophytes like some mosses or other liverworts such as *Radula*, the specific dark, net-like mats closely appressed to the bark are a strong indicator of *Frullania*.<<<Frullania>>>"
