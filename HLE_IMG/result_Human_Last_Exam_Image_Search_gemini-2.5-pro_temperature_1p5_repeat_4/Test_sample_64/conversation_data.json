    "The image displays a biological process known as **clamp connection** formation, which is characteristic of the cell division in dikaryotic hyphae of Basidiomycete fungi. This mechanism ensures that each new cell resulting from division receives a compatible pair of nuclei.\n\nThe three panels, labeled L, M, and N, illustrate sequential stages of this process as observed under a microscope:\n\n*   **Panel L:** This panel shows the initial stage. A specialized, backward-growing hyphal branch, known as the clamp, begins to form at the terminal end of the hypha. The arrowheads point to the developing septa, or cross-walls, that separate the fungal cells.\n\n*   **Panel M:** In this stage, the clamp has elongated and started to curve back towards the main hyphal filament. Concurrently, the two nuclei within the terminal cell undergo mitosis. One daughter nucleus from one mitotic division moves into the clamp, while the other remains in the apical part of the cell. The daughter nuclei from the other mitotic division also position themselves within the main hypha.\n\n*   **Panel N:** This panel shows the final stages. The clamp has fused with the sub-apical cell, creating a bridge. A septum has formed to separate the new terminal cell, which now contains a pair of compatible nuclei. Another septum forms at the base of the clamp, temporarily isolating the nucleus within it before it migrates into the sub-apical cell. This ensures that both the new terminal and sub-apical cells are dikaryotic, each containing two distinct nuclei.\n\nIn summary, the image provides a clear microscopic view of the key stages involved in the formation of a clamp connection, a crucial process for maintaining the dikaryotic state during the vegetative growth of many mushrooms and other Basidiomycete fungi.\n\n<<<Clamp connection formation>>>"
