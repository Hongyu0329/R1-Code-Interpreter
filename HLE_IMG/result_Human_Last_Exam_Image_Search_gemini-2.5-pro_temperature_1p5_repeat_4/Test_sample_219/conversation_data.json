    "To solve this problem, we must first identify the synchronized bursts from the graph and then calculate the average time interval between them.\n\n**1. Identify Timestamps of Synchronized Bursts**\nSynchronized bursts are visible as dense vertical lines, indicating that many electrodes are firing at nearly the same time. By inspecting the graph, we can identify four major synchronized bursts. The approximate center timestamp for each burst is:\n*   **Burst 1:** 3.5 s\n*   **Burst 2:** 16.5 s\n*   **Burst 3:** 35.5 s\n*   **Burst 4:** 49.5 s\n\n**2. Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time between the midpoints of consecutive bursts. We can calculate the three intervals between the four identified bursts:\n*   **IBI 1 (between Burst 2 and Burst 1):** 16.5 s - 3.5 s = 13 s\n*   **IBI 2 (between Burst 3 and Burst 2):** 35.5 s - 16.5 s = 19 s\n*   **IBI 3 (between Burst 4 and Burst 3):** 49.5 s - 35.5 s = 14 s\n\n**3. Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average inter-burst interval, we sum the individual intervals and divide by the number of intervals:\n*   **Average IBI** = (13 s + 19 s + 14 s) / 3\n*   **Average IBI** = 46 s / 3 â‰ˆ 15.33 s\n\nRounding the result to two significant figures, we get 15 s.\n\n<<<15>>>"
