    "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Reaction\n\nThe provided image displays a three-step chemical synthesis. To determine the molecular formula of the final product, each step of the reaction sequence must be analyzed to understand the transformation occurring and to deduce the structure of each intermediate.\n\n**Step 1: Starting Material to Intermediate 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is a bicyclic lactam (a cyclic amide) with a para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group on the nitrogen atom and a trifluoromethyl (CF₃) group on the carbon-carbon double bond. Its systematic name is 2-(p-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. The molecular formula of the starting material is C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂.\n*   **Reagents:** Ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) in acetonitrile (ACN) and water (H₂O).\n*   **Reaction:** CAN is a strong oxidizing agent commonly used for the deprotection of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers and amines. In this step, the PMB group is cleaved from the nitrogen atom.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this deprotection is the same bicyclic lactam but with a hydrogen atom on the nitrogen instead of the PMB group. This molecule is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 1:** The removal of the PMB group (C₈H₉O) and the addition of a hydrogen atom results in the molecular formula C₇H₆F₃NO.\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate 1 to Intermediate 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂) in methanol (MeOH).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The Pd/C catalyst facilitates the addition of hydrogen across the carbon-carbon double bond, a process also known as reduction. The lactam functional group is typically stable under these conditions.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The double bond in the bicyclic ring system is saturated, converting the alkene to an alkane. The resulting molecule is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 2:** The addition of two hydrogen atoms to Intermediate 1 changes its molecular formula to C₇H₈F₃NO.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate 2 to Final Product**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N Hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 70 °C.\n*   **Reaction:** These conditions correspond to strong acid hydrolysis. The lactam (cyclic amide) is hydrolyzed, which involves the cleavage of the amide bond within the ring. A molecule of water is consumed in this process, adding a hydroxyl group to the carbonyl carbon to form a carboxylic acid and a hydrogen atom to the nitrogen to form an amine (which will be protonated to an ammonium salt in the acidic conditions).\n*   **Product:** The ring-opening of the bicyclic lactam results in a substituted cyclopentane ring. The final product is an amino acid, specifically a cis-3-amino-5-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid.\n*   **Molecular Formula of the Product:** The hydrolysis reaction adds one molecule of water (H₂O) to the molecular formula of Intermediate 2.\n    *   C atoms: 7\n    *   H atoms: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   F atoms: 3\n    *   N atoms: 1\n    *   O atoms: 1 + 1 = 2\nThe final molecular formula is therefore C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂.\n\n<<<C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂>>>"
