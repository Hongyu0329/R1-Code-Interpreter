    "The primary and most evident difference in the sporophyte, which allows for a quick visual distinction between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*, is the orientation of the seta.\n\n*   ***Grimmia montana*** has a **straight seta**, which holds the capsule in an erect position.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta*** is characterized by its **arcuate, or curved seta**, causing the capsule to be bent or inclined.\n\nThis feature is so defining that the specific epithet \"*curviseta*\" directly translates to \"curved bristle,\" referring to its bent seta. Therefore, observing whether the seta is straight or curved is the most straightforward way to distinguish the sporophytes of these two species at a glance.\n\n<<<The main difference is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a curved (arcuate) seta.>>>"
