    "The spectral lines shown in the image belong to the element Iron (Fe).\n\nEach element has a unique emission spectrum, which acts like a \"fingerprint.\" The image displays a very complex spectrum with a multitude of lines spread across the entire visible range, from blue to red. This high density of spectral lines is a well-known characteristic of iron.\n\nWhen compared with known spectral charts of various elements, the pattern in the image definitively matches that of iron. The spectrum of iron is so dense with lines that some sources state it contains thousands of individual lines, and in the solar spectrum, about 30% of all spectral lines are attributed to iron. This complexity makes iron spectra useful for applications like wavelength calibration in spectroscopy.\n\n<<<Iron>>>"
