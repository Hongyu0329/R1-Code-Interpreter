    "*   **ECG Paper Speed:** The standard speed for this ECG is provided in the top left corner as 25 mm/sec.\n*   **Time Calculation:** On an ECG at 25 mm/sec, each small 1 mm square represents 0.04 seconds, and each large 5 mm square represents 0.2 seconds.\n*   **Identifying the Longest R-R Interval:** Visually scanning the entire rhythm strip shows that the longest pause between two consecutive R-waves (the R-R interval) occurs in the fourth strip down, near the time mark 0:06:08.\n*   **Measurement:** To measure this interval, we count the number of squares between the peak of the R-wave just before the pause and the peak of the R-wave just after the pause.\n    *   The interval spans 8 full large squares and approximately 2 additional small squares.\n    *   Total number of small squares = (8 large squares * 5 small squares/large square) + 2 small squares = 42 small squares.\n*   **Final Calculation:** Multiply the number of small squares by the time per square to get the duration in seconds.\n    *   42 small squares * 0.04 seconds/small square = 1.68 seconds.\n\nThe longest R-R interval is 1.68 seconds.\n<<<1.68>>>"
