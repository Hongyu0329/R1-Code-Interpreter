    "The knot in the picture is identified as the 8_18 knot. The Rasmussen invariant, often denoted as s(K) for a knot K, is an integer invariant of knots that provides significant information about the knot's properties in four dimensions. For the 8_18 knot, the Rasmussen s-invariant is 0.\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant is derived from the Khovanov homology of a knot. It serves as a lower bound for the smooth 4-genus, a measure of how complex a surface the knot bounds in 4-dimensional space. For alternating knots, the Rasmussen invariant is equal to the knot signature. However, the 8_18 knot is a non-alternating knot.\n\nKnot theory is a branch of topology that studies mathematical knots. A key task in this field is distinguishing knots from one another using knot invariants, which are quantities that are the same for equivalent knots. In addition to the Rasmussen invariant, other invariants for the 8_18 knot include its 3-genus of 3, a bridge index of 3, and a smooth 4-genus of 1.\n\n<<<0>>>"
