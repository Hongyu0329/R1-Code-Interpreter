    "To determine the total current flowing through the circuit, we must first find the total equivalent resistance and then apply Ohm's Law.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Left Branch:**\n    *   The circuit has a voltage source V2 of 1 V. The top wire is the positive terminal and the bottom wire is ground.\n    *   In the left branch, resistors R1, R2, and R3 are present.\n    *   A wire connects the top of the circuit (positive terminal) directly to the point between R1 and R2. This wire is in parallel with resistor R1. Since a wire has virtually zero resistance, it creates a short circuit across R1. Therefore, all current will bypass R1, and R1 can be ignored for calculation purposes.\n    *   Similarly, another wire connects the top of the circuit to the point between R2 and R3. This creates a short circuit across the series combination of the (already shorted) R1 and R2.\n    *   Effectively, the current from the voltage source bypasses both R1 and R2 and flows directly to the top of R3. This means the only effective resistance in the left branch is R3.\n    *   So, the equivalent resistance of the left branch (R_left) is **9 Ω**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Right Branch:**\n    *   In the right branch, resistor R8 is connected to the top wire, and its other end is connected to resistor R7.\n    *   The other end of R7 is connected to the bottom wire (ground).\n    *   This is a simple series connection.\n    *   The equivalent resistance of the right branch (R_right) is the sum of R7 and R8.\n    *   R_right = R7 + R8 = 100 Ω + 100 Ω = **200 Ω**.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Equivalent Resistance (R_eq):**\n    *   The left branch and the right branch are connected in parallel to the voltage source.\n    *   The total equivalent resistance is calculated using the formula for parallel resistors:\n        1 / R_eq = 1 / R_left + 1 / R_right\n        1 / R_eq = 1 / 9 Ω + 1 / 200 Ω\n        1 / R_eq = (200 + 9) / (9 * 200) = 209 / 1800\n        R_eq = 1800 / 209 Ω ≈ 8.61 Ω\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Current (I_total):**\n    *   Using Ohm's Law (V = IR), the total current flowing from the voltage source is I = V / R_eq.\n    *   I_total = 1 V / (1800 / 209 Ω)\n    *   I_total = 209 / 1800 A\n\n### Final Calculation:\n\nThe total current is 209 divided by 1800 Amperes.\n\nI_total ≈ 0.1161 Amperes\n\n<<<0.1161 A>>>"
