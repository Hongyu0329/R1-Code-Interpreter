    "The provided image of a musical score displays the melody and chord progression of a well-known jazz standard. Based on the melodic contour and the specific chord changes (Fm, E-7b5, Eb-6, Dbmaj7), the title of this song is \"What a Diff'rence a Day Makes.\"\n\nThe song was originally a Spanish-language bolero titled \"Cuando vuelva a tu lado\" (\"When I Return to Your Side\"). The music was composed in 1934 by the successful Mexican songwriter María Grever. The English lyrics were later written by Stanley Adams.\n\nWhile the song has been recorded by many artists, the 1959 version by Dinah Washington became the most famous and is considered a jazz standard. Washington's rendition earned her a Grammy Award for Best Rhythm & Blues Performance.\n\n<<<\"What a Diff'rence a Day Makes\" by María Grever>>>"
