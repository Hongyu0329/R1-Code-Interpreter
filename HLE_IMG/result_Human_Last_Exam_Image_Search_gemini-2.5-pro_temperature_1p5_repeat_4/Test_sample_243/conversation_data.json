    "The plant in the image is an *Alocasia clypeolata*, commonly known as the 'Green Shield' Alocasia. This species is endemic to the island of Mindanao in the Philippines. It is also found in the Lesser Sunda Islands.\n\nThe *Alocasia clypeolata* is characterized by its glossy, shield-shaped green leaves with prominent, darker green veins. It thrives in the warm, humid, and rocky environments of tropical rainforests, typically found on slopes and riverbanks at low elevations. While it is now a popular houseplant in many parts of the world, its natural origin is traced back to these specific islands in Southeast Asia.\n\n<<<Mindanao>>>"
