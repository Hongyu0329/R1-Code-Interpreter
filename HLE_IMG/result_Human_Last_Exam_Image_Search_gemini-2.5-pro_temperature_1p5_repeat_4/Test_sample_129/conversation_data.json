    "The protein shown in the image is a member of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family. While a reverse image search identifies the specific structure as PDB entry 2L6R, which is the \"W protein of bacteriophage lambda,\" the overall fold is highly characteristic of Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variants. For example, a computed structure model of Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant 2 (UBE2V2) shows a very similar structure.\n\nUbiquitin-conjugating enzymes are crucial components of the ubiquitination pathway, which attaches ubiquitin proteins to substrate proteins, a process that can lead to their degradation or alter their function. Specifically, the UBE2V2 protein is a variant that lacks direct catalytic activity but forms a complex with another enzyme, UBE2N, to create specific poly-ubiquitin chains. These chains act as signals in cellular processes like DNA repair and cell cycle control, rather than marking proteins for destruction.\n\nThe depicted protein family is found in various organisms, from viruses to humans. In humans, the gene that codes for UBE2V2 is located on chromosome 8.\n\n<<<Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 variant 2>>>"
