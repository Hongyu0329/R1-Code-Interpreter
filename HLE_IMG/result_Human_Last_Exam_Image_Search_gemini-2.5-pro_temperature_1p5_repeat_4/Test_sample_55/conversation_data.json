    "The circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, spell out the chord F-A-C#-E. This chord occurs in the key of D minor and resolves to a G minor chord (the subdominant, or iv) in the following measure.\n\nThe function of this chord is to tonicize the G minor chord, meaning it makes the G minor sound like a temporary tonic. Analyzing the chord F-A-C#-E reveals that it does not fit neatly into standard diatonic or simple altered chord categories. However, due to its strong voice-leading properties and its characteristic sound, it is most accurately identified as a **French augmented sixth chord tonicizing the subdominant**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the analysis:\n*   **Notes:** F, A, C#, E\n*   **Key:** D minor\n*   **Function:** Prepares the subdominant (G minor).\n*   **Label:** The standard Roman numeral for a French augmented sixth chord is **Fr**. Because it is in an inversion with the third of the conceptual root in the bass, it is written with figures **4/3**. Since it tonicizes the subdominant (iv), the full Roman numeral is **Fr⁴³/iv**.\n\nThis specific type of chromatic chord is a hallmark of the Classical period, used to add color and create strong harmonic movement towards important chords within the key.\n\n<<<Fr⁴³/iv>>>"
