    "To determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair, key morphological differences between males and females of these groups are examined. These include the shape of the abdomen, and the length and shape of the antennae.\n\n*   **Pair A:** The insects are cuckoo bees of the genus *Coelioxys*. The individual on the right (A2) has a sharply pointed, conical abdomen, which is a key characteristic of females of this genus; they use it to pierce the nests of their host bees to lay eggs. The individual on the left (A1) has a blunter abdomen with multiple small spines at the tip, which is typical for a male *Coelioxys*. Therefore, the pair is Male, Female.\n*   **Pair B:** These are paper wasps of the genus *Polistes*. A primary way to distinguish sexes in this group is by the antennae. The individual on the right (B2) has distinctly curled or hooked tips on its antennae, a classic feature of male paper wasps. The individual on the left (B1) has shorter, straighter antennae, characteristic of a female. Additionally, the female's abdomen is more pointed to house the stinger. Therefore, the pair is Female, Male.\n*   **Pair C:** These appear to be plasterer bees (*Colletes*) or a related group. The individual on the left (C1) has conspicuously long antennae and a pale-haired face, both strong indicators of a male bee in many species, including *Colletes*. The individual on the right (C2) also displays male characteristics. Its abdomen is rounded and fuzzy at the tip, which is typical for male bees, in contrast to the more pointed abdomen of females which contains a stinger. While female *Colletes* lack the dense pollen-collecting scopae of many other bees, they differ in abdominal shape from males. Therefore, both individuals are Male.\n\nBased on this analysis, the sexes for each pair are:\n*   A: Male, Female (3)\n*   B: Female, Male (4)\n*   C: Male, Male (1)\n\n<<<3, 4, 1>>>"
