    "Based on the provided reaction scheme, the reagents A and B are as follows:\n\n**Reagent A: Hydrazine (N₂H₄)**\n\nThe first step of the reaction converts compound **1**, a dimethoxydibenzo[c,h]xanthenylium salt, into compound **2**. This transformation involves the replacement of a ring oxygen atom with an N-NH₂ group. This is a characteristic reaction of pyrylium-type salts with hydrazine, which acts as a nucleophile to form an N-amino pyridinium derivative. Therefore, reagent A is hydrazine, often used as its more stable hydrate (N₂H₄·H₂O).\n\n**Reagent B: Propionaldehyde (Propanal, CH₃CH₂CHO)**\n\nThe second step converts the N-aminoacridinium salt **2** into the N-propyl-substituted quinacridinium derivative **3**. This type of transformation is accomplished through a condensation reaction between the N-amino group of compound **2** and an aldehyde. The resulting intermediate then undergoes a complex rearrangement involving cyclization and elimination to form the final quinacridinium core. The alkyl group on the final product corresponds to the alkyl group of the aldehyde used. Since product **3** has an N-propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃), the required aldehyde is propionaldehyde.\n\nIt is worth noting that the structure of product **3** as drawn in the image (a monomethoxy dihydroquinacridinium) may differ from the fully aromatic dimethoxyquinacridinium product typically reported in the literature for this type of reaction. However, the identity of reagent B as propionaldehyde remains the most chemically sound conclusion to explain the introduction of the N-propyl group.\n\n<<<A: Hydrazine, B: Propionaldehyde>>>"
