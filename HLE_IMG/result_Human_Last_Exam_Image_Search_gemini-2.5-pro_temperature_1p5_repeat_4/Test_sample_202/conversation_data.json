    "Based on the visual analysis of the rock specimens and confirmation from the search results, here are the identifications:\n\n*   **H: Scoria** - This specimen is a type of volcanic rock that is reddish-brown and highly vesicular, meaning it's full of bubble-like cavities (vesicles). Its color is due to the oxidation of iron during the eruption. Scoria is typically denser than pumice and does not float in water.\n\n*   **I: Breccia** - This rock is composed of angular fragments of other rocks cemented together in a matrix. This composition identifies it as breccia, a clastic sedimentary rock. The angularity of the fragments suggests they were not transported far from their original source before being lithified.\n\n*   **J: Pumice** - This is a light-colored, highly vesicular volcanic rock. It has a frothy appearance due to a large number of small vesicles. Pumice is formed from the rapid cooling and depressurization of magma, which traps gas bubbles within the rock. Its low density often allows it to float on water.\n\n*   **K: Pegmatite** - This specimen is an igneous rock with exceptionally large, interlocking crystals, which identifies it as a pegmatite. Pegmatites are intrusive igneous rocks, meaning they formed from magma that cooled slowly beneath the Earth's surface. This slow cooling allows for the growth of large crystals. Pegmatites often form in the final stages of a magma chamber's crystallization.\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite>>>"
