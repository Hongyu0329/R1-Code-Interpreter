    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. It is a type of longhorn beetle. Based on its appearance, specifically the black head and thorax and reddish-brown elytra, it is likely a male *Stictoleptura rubra*.\n\nThe scientific name for this beetle is *Stictoleptura rubra*. This species is also commonly known as the red-brown longhorn beetle. There is a noticeable difference in appearance between the sexes of this species. Females have a reddish-brown head, pronotum, and elytra, while males, as seen in the picture, have a black head and pronotum with reddish or yellowish-brown elytra.\n\nThis beetle belongs to the family Cerambycidae, which encompasses a large number of species known as longhorn beetles. The larvae of *Stictoleptura rubra* typically develop in the dead wood of coniferous trees. The adult beetles are often found on flowers during the summer, where they feed on nectar and pollen. They are considered uncommon in Britain, with a distribution primarily in the south.\n\nAnother beetle with a similar appearance is the Red-necked Longhorn (*Aromia bungii*), but this species is not currently established in the UK. The beetle in the image most closely matches the description of the male *Stictoleptura rubra*.\n\n<<<Stictoleptura rubra>>>"
