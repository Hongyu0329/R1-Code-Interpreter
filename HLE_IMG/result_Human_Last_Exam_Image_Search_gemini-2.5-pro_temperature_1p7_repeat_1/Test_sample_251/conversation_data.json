    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip, we must first understand the paper speed and its corresponding time measurements.\n\n### Analysis of the ECG Strip\n\n1.  **Paper Speed**: The strip indicates a speed of 25 mm/sec.\n2.  **Time Calculation**: At 25 mm/sec, each small 1 mm square on the horizontal axis represents 0.04 seconds, and each large 5 mm square represents 0.2 seconds. The R-R interval is the time between two consecutive R-waves, which are the highest peaks of the QRS complex.\n\n### Locating and Measuring the Longest Interval\n\nBy visually inspecting the entire rhythm strip, a significant pause is noticeable in the fourth row, which starts near the timestamp `0:06:08`. This pause occurs between the fourth and fifth QRS complexes on that line.\n\nTo measure this interval:\n*   The peak of the R-wave before the pause and the peak of the R-wave after the pause are identified.\n*   The number of squares between these two peaks is counted.\n*   The interval spans approximately 8 large squares and 3 small squares.\n\n### Calculation\n\nThe duration can be calculated as follows:\n*   **In large and small squares**: (8 large squares × 0.2 s/large square) + (3 small squares × 0.04 s/small square) = 1.6 s + 0.12 s = 1.72 s.\n*   **In total small squares**: There are 5 small squares in one large square, so the interval is (8 × 5) + 3 = 43 small squares. The total time is 43 small squares × 0.04 s/small square = 1.72 s.\n\nOther pauses on the strip appear visually shorter. For instance, a pause in the last row measures approximately 36 small squares (36 x 0.04s = 1.44s), confirming that the pause in the fourth row is the longest.\n\n<<<1.72>>>"
