    "To determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely, we must analyze the steric hindrance around the single bond connecting each phenyl ring to the main structure. Free rotation can occur around single bonds, but it can be restricted or completely blocked by bulky neighboring groups.\n\n*   **Rings A and C:** These rings form the backbone of the large \"pincer\" ligands. They are each bonded to the central iridium (Ir) atom through a direct carbon-iridium bond (a cyclometalation) at their respective position 6 (C6). This, along with coordination from the adjacent pyridyl rings (B and D), locks rings A and C rigidly in place. They cannot rotate.\n\n*   **Rings K and L:** These phenyl rings are attached at position 5 (C5) of rings A and C, respectively. This C5 position is *ortho* (immediately adjacent) to the C6 position that is bonded to the iridium atom. This proximity places rings K and L directly next to the bulky metal center and its other ligands. This severe steric crowding prevents any significant rotation.\n\n*   **Ring G:** This phenyl ring is attached at position 6 (C6) of the pyridyl ring F. Ring F is part of a bipyridine ligand where the nitrogen atom (N) is coordinated to the iridium. The C6 position is *ortho* to this coordinating nitrogen. Similar to rings K and L, this places ring G in a very crowded environment close to the iridium atom, which severely restricts its rotation.\n\n*   **Rings H and J:** These phenyl rings are attached at position 4 (C4) of rings A and C, respectively. This position is *meta* to the C6-Ir bond and *para* to the bond axis connecting to the pyridyl rings. This places them much farther from the sterically congested iridium center compared to rings G, K, and L. While they are still in a crowded molecule, the bond connecting them to the main structure has significantly less steric hindrance to rotation than the other phenyl groups. In solution, the energy barrier for rotation is low enough that rings H and J are considered to be freely rotating.\n\nBased on this analysis, only rings H and J have the necessary space to rotate freely.\n\n<<<J>>>"
