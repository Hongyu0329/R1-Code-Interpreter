    "Based on the G.V. Black classification system, the lesion in the image corresponds to a Class I caries.\n\nThe image shows a posterior tooth (a molar) with an existing metallic restoration, likely amalgam. The dark lesion is located in the pits and fissures on the occlusal (chewing) surface of the tooth, surrounding the filling.\n\nAccording to G.V. Black's classification, which categorizes cavities based on their location on the tooth, a Class I lesion is one that affects the pits and fissures of posterior teeth. The cavity in the image fits this description perfectly. Since the decay is occurring around a pre-existing restoration, it is specifically referred to as recurrent or secondary caries. However, its classification by location remains Class I.\n\n<<<Class I>>>"
