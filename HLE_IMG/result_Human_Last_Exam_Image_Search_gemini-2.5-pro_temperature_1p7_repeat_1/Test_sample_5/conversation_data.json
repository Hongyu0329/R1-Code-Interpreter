    "This piece of sheet music is from \"U.N. Owen Was Her?\", which is the theme song for the character Flandre Scarlet, the Extra Stage boss in the video game *Touhou Koumakyou: The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil*. The game is the sixth installment in the popular Japanese *Touhou Project* series developed by ZUN, who also composed the original music.\n\nThe name of the song and one of Flandre's attacks, \"Secret Barrage 'And Then Will There Be None?'\", are direct references to Agatha Christie's famous 1939 mystery novel, *And Then There Were None*, originally titled *Ten Little...* and in which the killer is initially unknown or a \"Mr. U. N. Owen\".\n\nThe piece is famous within the gaming community for its fast-paced, complex melody and has numerous arrangements and remixes across the internet. The arrangement shown in the image, with its distinct quiet opening followed by a sudden, loud, and virtuosic burst of arpeggios, is characteristic of many popular piano versions found online.\n\n<<<U.N. Owen Was Her?>>>"
