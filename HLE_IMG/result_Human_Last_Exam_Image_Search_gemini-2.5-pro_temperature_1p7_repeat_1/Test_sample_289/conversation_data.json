    "Based on visual identification of the landscape and vegetation, the image was likely taken in the unincorporated community of Aguanga, California. The official elevation recorded by the U.S. Geological Survey's Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) for Aguanga is 1,955 feet.\n\nConverting feet to meters (1 foot = 0.3048 meters):\n1,955 feet * 0.3048 = 595.884 meters.\n\nThis elevation is often rounded to 596 meters. A U.S. Topo map for Aguanga published in 2015 shows that the names data from GNIS was current as of 2015 and the hydrography and imagery data were from 2012, which aligns with the requested timeframe of 2014.\n\n<<<596>>>"
