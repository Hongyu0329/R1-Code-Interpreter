    "This image shows the **Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9) nuclease**.\n\nSpecifically, it is a ribbon diagram of the Cas9 protein from *Streptococcus pyogenes* (SpyCas9). Cas9 is an enzyme known as an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease, meaning it can cut DNA at specific sites. This capability has made it a central tool in CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology.\n\nThe protein has a bilobed (two-lobed) architecture, which is visible in the image. These two lobes are:\n*   **The Recognition (REC) lobe**: This lobe is responsible for recognizing and binding to the guide RNA and the target DNA sequence.\n*   **The Nuclease (NUC) lobe**: This lobe contains the components that perform the cutting of the DNA strands.\n\nThe structure shown is derived from X-ray crystallography studies which have helped scientists understand how Cas9 recognizes and cleaves DNA, a process that also requires a specific sequence known as a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) near the target site.\n\n<<<Cas9>>>"
