    "The plant in the image is a species from the genus *Debregeasia*, likely *Debregeasia longifolia* or a related species, which are known for their distinct, net-veined leaves.\n\nWhile this plant genus is native to a wide area including tropical and subtropical Asia, a related species, *Debregeasia orientalis*, is found on the island of Taiwan. However, the plant group is not strictly endemic to a single island, as its native range extends from China to Tropical Asia and Vanuatu. Species of this genus can also be found in various parts of India, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia.\n\nAnother plant with similarly patterned leaves is the Nerve Plant (*Fittonia albivenis*), which is native to the tropical rainforests of South America.\n\nGiven the wide distribution of the *Debregeasia* genus across multiple islands and mainlands, it is not endemic to one specific island.\n\n<<<Taiwan>>>"
