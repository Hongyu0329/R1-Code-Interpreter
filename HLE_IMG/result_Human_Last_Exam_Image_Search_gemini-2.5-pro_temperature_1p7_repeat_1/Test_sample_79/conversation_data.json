    "The square structure visible at coordinates 29° 06' 18.75''N and 103° 47' 50.28''W is located in Presidio County, Texas, within a significant archaeological zone known as La Junta de los Ríos. This area, at the confluence of the Rio Grande and the Río Conchos, was home to numerous Native American pueblos and villages from around A.D. 1200 through the Spanish colonial period.\n\nThe specific structure is identified as an unexcavated protohistoric Native American pueblo, and has been colloquially named **\"El Círculo\"** due to its shape. It is considered an important archaeological site. While it is part of the rich historical landscape of the La Junta region, which includes many significant archaeological discoveries, it does not appear on the National Register of Historic Places at this time.\n\nThe La Junta district contains many well-studied sites, such as Millington, Loma Alta, and Polvo, which have provided crucial information about the Bravo Valley culture. Researchers like J. Charles Kelley began excavating in this area in the 1930s, uncovering pithouses and other architectural features. This region was a focal point for settlement due to the fertile land at the river junction. Archaeological work continues to reveal more about the local brownware ceramic traditions and the distinct cultures of the area. The site of \"El Círculo\" remains a key point of interest for understanding the unwritten history of the region before and during the early European contact.\n\n<<<The square structure is an unexcavated protohistoric Native American pueblo colloquially known as \"El Círculo.\" It is a significant archaeological site but is not currently listed as an official historic landmark.>>>"
