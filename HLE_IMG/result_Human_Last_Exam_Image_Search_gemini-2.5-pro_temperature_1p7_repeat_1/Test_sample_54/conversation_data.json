    "Based on the chemical transformations shown in the image and supplementary information from chemical literature, the reagents A and B can be identified as follows:\n\n### Reagent A\n\nThe first step of the reaction shows the conversion of compound **1**, a dibenzo[c,h]xanthenylium derivative (a type of pyrylium salt), into compound **2**. In this transformation, an oxygen atom in one of the central heterocyclic rings is replaced by a nitrogen atom bearing an amino group (-NH₂). This specific conversion of a pyrylium salt to an N-aminopyridinium salt is a well-established reaction in organic chemistry. The reagent used for this transformation is **hydrazine**.\n\n*   **Reagent A: Hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂) **\n\n### Reagent B\n\nThe second step involves the reaction of the N-amino intermediate **2** with reagent **B** to yield the final product **3**, identified as a dimethoxy quinacridinium derivative. This transformation is complex, involving the cleavage of the N-N bond, the formation of a new heterocyclic ring, and the addition of an n-propyl group.\n\nBased on the structure of the final product **3**, which contains an N-propyl group, reagent **B** must be a source for this group. Syntheses of similar N-alkylated quinacridinium salts are documented to proceed from acridinium precursors by reacting them with a primary amine at elevated temperatures. In this case, to introduce the n-propyl group, the reagent is **n-propylamine**. The reaction likely proceeds through a complex mechanism involving nucleophilic attack by the propylamine, ring opening, and subsequent rearrangement and cyclization to form the stable pentacyclic quinacridinium core.\n\n*   **Reagent B: n-Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) **\n\n<<<**A**: Hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂), **B**: n-Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)"
