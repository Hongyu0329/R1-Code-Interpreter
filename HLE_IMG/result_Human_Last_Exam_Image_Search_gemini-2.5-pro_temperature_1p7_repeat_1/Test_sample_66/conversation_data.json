    "Here is a step-by-step derivation to find the total area of the shaded regions.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Geometry from the Image\n\nFirst, let's analyze the geometric information provided in the image.\n*   We have a large circular sector with a radius **r = 34**.\n*   The sector is divided into four equal smaller sectors by angles labeled **θ**. The total angle of the large sector is therefore **4θ**.\n*   The diagram shows a right-angled triangle that is used to define the angle θ. This triangle has a hypotenuse equal to the radius (34) and a side of length **17** opposite the angle θ.\n\n### 2. Calculating the Angle θ\n\nUsing the right-angled triangle, we can determine the value of θ using the sine function:\nsin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse = 17 / 34 = 1/2\n\nThe angle θ for which sin(θ) = 1/2 is **30 degrees** (or π/6 radians).\n\nSince the total sector is comprised of four such angles, the total angle of the large sector is:\nTotal Angle = 4 * θ = 4 * 30° = **120 degrees** (or 2π/3 radians).\n\n### 3. Strategy for Calculating the Shaded Area\n\nThe image shows two shaded regions, one blue and one red, which have a small area of overlap. The question asks for the *total area of the shaded regions*, which is the area of their union.\n\nA straightforward way to calculate this total area is to consider the entire large sector and subtract the areas of the unshaded regions within it.\n\nThe unshaded parts are shown as four identical right-angled triangles. Let's verify this and calculate their area.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Area of the Unshaded Triangles\n\nLet's analyze one of the four unshaded triangles. Each of these triangles is situated within one of the small 30° sectors.\nFor each triangle:\n*   One vertex is at the center of the circle (O).\n*   One vertex lies on the arc of the circle (let's call it P). The segment OP is the hypotenuse, with length equal to the radius, **r = 34**.\n*   The third vertex (let's call it Q) lies on one of the radii bounding the small sector, such that the angle at Q is a right angle (90°).\n*   The angle at the center O is **θ = 30°**.\n\nThe sides of this right-angled triangle (OQP) are:\n*   Hypotenuse: OP = 34\n*   Side adjacent to θ: OQ = OP * cos(θ) = 34 * cos(30°) = 34 * (√3 / 2) = **17√3**\n*   Side opposite to θ: QP = OP * sin(θ) = 34 * sin(30°) = 34 * (1/2) = **17**\n\nThe area of one such unshaded triangle is:\nArea_triangle = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * OQ * QP\nArea_triangle = (1/2) * (17√3) * 17 = **289√3 / 2**\n\nSince there are four identical, non-overlapping unshaded triangles, their total area is:\nTotal_Unshaded_Area = 4 * (289√3 / 2) = 2 * 289√3 = **578√3**\n\n### 5. Calculating the Total Area of the Large Sector\n\nThe area of the entire circular sector (with radius r = 34 and angle 4θ = 120°) is:\nArea_sector = (Total Angle / 360°) * π * r²\nArea_sector = (120° / 360°) * π * (34)²\nArea_sector = (1/3) * π * 1156 = **1156π / 3**\n\n### 6. Calculating the Total Shaded Area\n\nFinally, the total area of the shaded regions is the area of the large sector minus the total area of the unshaded triangles.\n\nTotal_Shaded_Area = Area_sector - Total_Unshaded_Area\nTotal_Shaded_Area = (1156π / 3) - 578√3\n\nThis expression gives the exact total area of the shaded regions. The description of the regions as \"blue,\" \"red,\" and \"overlapping\" is a visual representation, but the most direct calculation method is to subtract the clearly defined unshaded areas from the total sector area.\n\nThe final answer is **1156π/3 - 578√3**.\n\n<<<1156*pi/3 - 578*sqrt(3)>>>"
