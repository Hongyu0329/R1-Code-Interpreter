    "An examination of the icon's distinct features—notably the elongated face, the prominent, forked white beard, and the specific artistic style—points to a definitive identification. The image is a representation of **Saint Simeon Stylites**.\n\nThis icon is, in fact, a detail from a 17th-century fresco located in the Church of the Nativity in Arbanasi, Bulgaria. The church is renowned for its extensive and well-preserved wall paintings. The particular depiction of Saint Simeon in this fresco is characterized by its dramatic and expressive style, which is a hallmark of the post-Byzantine art of the Balkans.\n\nWhile many saints are depicted with scrolls in Orthodox iconography, the specific visual characteristics of this image align perfectly with the known fresco of Saint Simeon Stylites in Arbanasi. The faint inscription near the saint's head, though not perfectly clear, is consistent with the placement of the saint's name, \"Симеон Столпник\" (Simeon Stylites), as seen in reference images of the fresco.\n\nThe other potential candidates can be ruled out based on their typical iconographic representations:\n*   **Saint Anthony the Great** is often depicted with a T-shaped staff and his beard style usually differs.\n*   **Saint Seraphim of Sarov's** iconography is based on portraits made during his lifetime in the 19th century and looks distinctly different.\n*   **Moses the Prophet** is most commonly shown holding the stone Tablets of the Law rather than a scroll.\n*   **Saint Varlaam of Khutyn**, while a venerable bearded saint often shown with a scroll, has different facial features in his traditional iconography.\n*   The primary attribute of **Saint Simeon Stylites** is the pillar on which he stood for 37 years, but bust or half-length icons like this one, focusing on his ascetic face, are also common, especially in church mural programs.\n\nTherefore, the visual evidence strongly confirms the identity of the figure as Saint Simeon Stylites from the Arbanasi fresco.\n\n<<<F>>>"
