    "The image displays several organisms common to rocky intertidal shores, but the presence of the small, dark-colored snail, known as the common periwinkle, definitively indicates the photo was taken on the Atlantic rather than the Pacific Coast of North America.\n\nThe scientific name of this species is *Littorina littorea*. Native to Europe, this snail was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the mid-19th century and has since become one of the most common marine snails in the region. Its established range in North America extends from Labrador, Canada, down to New Jersey or Delaware.\n\nWhile there have been scattered reports and discoveries of *Littorina littorea* on the Pacific coast, these have been isolated occurrences, and the species has failed to establish sustained populations there. Therefore, finding an established population of these snails, as pictured among the barnacles and whelks, is a key indicator of a North Atlantic location.\n\nOther species in the photo, such as the acorn barnacles (likely *Semibalanus balanoides*) and the larger predatory snails (likely the dog whelk, *Nucella lapillus*), are also found on North Atlantic shores. However, their geographic ranges are not as exclusively indicative as that of the common periwinkle. *Semibalanus balanoides* is also found on Pacific coasts, and *Nucella lapillus* is primarily a North Atlantic species but can be found in the Pacific Northwest as well.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
