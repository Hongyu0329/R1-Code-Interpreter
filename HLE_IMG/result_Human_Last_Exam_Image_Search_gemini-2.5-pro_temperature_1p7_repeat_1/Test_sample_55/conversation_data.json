    "The circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397 present a fascinating case for harmonic analysis. The notes played are C-sharp, E, F, and A.\n\nThis chord can be interpreted in several ways, but one of the most compelling analyses identifies it as an **F augmented major seventh chord (F+M7)**. This chord consists of the notes F, A, C-sharp, and E (F-A-C# is the augmented triad, and the E is a major seventh above the root F). A chord identifier recognizes Faug(maj7) as a primary match for these specific notes. This particular voicing places the C-sharp in the bass.\n\nFrom a functional harmony perspective in the key of D minor, this chord serves a specific dramatic and transitional purpose:\n\n*   **Key Context:** The piece is in D minor. The chord in question occurs on the second beat of measure 8, following a D minor arpeggio on the first beat.\n*   **Leading Tone:** The C-sharp in the bass is the leading tone of D minor, creating a strong pull toward the tonic, D.\n*   **Chromaticism:** This chord is highly chromatic and typical of the \"Fantasia\" style, which allows for more harmonic freedom and emotional expression. The F augmented chord (F-A-C#) is built on the submediant (the sixth degree) of D minor, but with a chromatically raised fifth (C-sharp instead of C-natural).\n*   **Alternative Interpretation (Altered Submediant):** The chord can be seen as a heavily altered submediant chord (VI). In D harmonic minor, the submediant chord built on the sixth degree (B-flat) is a B-flat major chord (Bb-D-F). However, Mozart frequently employs chromatic alterations for expressive effect. Here, he uses a chord built on F (the mediant of D minor's relative major, F major), augments it, and adds the seventh.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate Roman numeral for this chord, reflecting its structure and function within the key of D minor, would be an altered submediant chord. Considering the root is F (the submediant of the relative major key), with a clear leading-tone function from the C-sharp in the bass, a proper functional label is complex. However, identifying it as **VI+M7** (an augmented major seventh chord built on the sixth degree) captures the notes and its unusual quality. Another common approach is to label it based on its bass note, which is the leading tone (C#).\n\nDue to its ambiguity and strong pull to the tonic, some might also analyze it as a dominant-functioning chord with multiple non-chord tones, though this is less precise. Given its unique spelling, **Faug(maj7)/C#** provides a clear description, and in Roman numeral terms, it acts as a chromatic chord of submediant function with a prominent leading tone.\n\n<<<VI+M7>>>"
