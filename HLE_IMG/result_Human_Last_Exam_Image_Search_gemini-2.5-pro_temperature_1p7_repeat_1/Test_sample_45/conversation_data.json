    "The tiling in the image has **7-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\nThis pattern is a type of aperiodic tiling, often called a quasicrystalline tiling. A key characteristic of such tilings is that they can possess rotational symmetries that are forbidden in traditional, periodic crystals, such as 5-fold, 8-fold, or, in this case, 7-fold symmetry.\n\nIf you examine the tiling, you can identify points around which the entire pattern can be rotated to align with its original position. For instance:\n*   The center of each prominent dark blue, seven-sided polygon (a heptagon) acts as a point of 7-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   Rotating the entire pattern around the center of one of these heptagons by an angle of 360/7 degrees (approximately 51.4 degrees) will result in a pattern identical to the original.\n\nThese types of tilings are constructed from a set of basic shapes, or \"prototiles,\" which in this case are rhombuses, squares, and heptagons that combine to create the complex overall design. While a finite patch is shown, it represents a section of a larger, theoretically infinite tiling designed to have this specific non-crystallographic symmetry.\n\n<<<7-fold>>>"
