    "To determine the time signature of a musical measure, one must count the total number of beats within that measure. The time signature consists of two numbers; the top number indicates how many beats are in a measure, and the bottom number indicates the note value that receives one beat.\n\nBy examining the notes in the provided musical excerpt, we can deduce the time signature:\n\n*   **Treble Clef (Upper Staff):** The right hand plays a continuous pattern of sixteenth notes. These are grouped into four sets of four sixteenth notes. Since four sixteenth notes equal one quarter note, the total duration in the treble clef is equivalent to four quarter notes.\n\n*   **Bass Clef (Lower Staff):** The left hand plays a chord that is a half note, followed by two separate quarter notes. A half note is equal to two quarter notes. Therefore, the total duration in the bass clef is two quarter notes (from the half note) plus two more quarter notes, for a total of four quarter notes.\n\nSince both staves contain a total rhythmic value equivalent to four quarter notes, the measure contains four beats, and the quarter note gets the beat. This corresponds to a 4/4 time signature.\n\n<<<C>>>"
