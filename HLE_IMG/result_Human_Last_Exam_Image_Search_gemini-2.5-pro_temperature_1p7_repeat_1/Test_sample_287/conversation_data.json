    "An analysis of the architectural landmarks visible in the image confirms that it was taken in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nThe skyline featured is that of Yeouido, an island in the Han River and Seoul's primary financial and business district. Several prominent buildings can be identified in the photograph.\n\nThe distinctive, taller building with the curved facade on the right is the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) Tower. This 50-story, 240-meter skyscraper is a notable feature of the city's skyline and is located on Yeoi-Dae-Roh, the main road in the district.\n\nThe buildings to the left are part of the International Finance Center (IFC) Seoul. This is a large-scale commercial development comprising three office towers, the Conrad Seoul Hotel, and the IFC Mall. The complex is known for its \"magnificent crystalline design\" and glass facades.\n\nLocated between the FKI Tower and the IFC complex is the KTB Building, a 19-story office building now known as the HI Investment & Securities Building. All these buildings are situated in the Yeouido-dong area of Seoul.\n\n<<<Seoul>>>"
