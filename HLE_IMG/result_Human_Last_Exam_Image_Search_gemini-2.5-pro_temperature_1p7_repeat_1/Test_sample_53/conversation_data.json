    "The figure leaving the chariot is one of the daughters of Niobe.\n\nThe scene depicted on this ancient Greek vase is the mythological story of the killing of the Niobids. Niobe, the queen of Thebes, boasted of her fourteen children, claiming superiority over the goddess Leto, who had only two children, Apollo and Artemis. To punish her hubris, Leto sent Apollo and Artemis to kill all of Niobe's children with their arrows.\n\nThis particular red-figure vase is known as the Niobid Krater and is attributed to the Niobid Painter, active around 470 to 450 BC. It is a calyx-krater, a large vessel used for mixing wine and water. One side of the vase depicts Apollo and Artemis slaying the Niobids. The figure in question, a female falling from the chariot, is one of Niobe's daughters, struck down in the divine massacre. The driver of the chariot is likely another Niobid, and on the ground lies one of their slain brothers.<<<One of the Niobids>>>"
