    "The piece of sheet music is from the opening of the second act of Richard Wagner's opera, *Tristan und Isolde*.\n\nThe score features instrumentation and German markings characteristic of Wagner's work, such as \"2 gr. Fl.\" (2 große Flöten, or 2 large flutes), \"engl. Horn\" (English horn), and \"Br.\" (Bratschen, or violas). The instruction \"(Vorhang),\" which means \"curtain,\" clearly indicates the beginning of an act. The music itself, with its lush, chromatic harmonies and soaring melodic lines, is a hallmark of Wagner's late Romantic style and is widely recognized as the introduction to Act 2 of this opera. Search results confirm that the introduction to the second act of *Tristan und Isolde* prominently features this musical passage.\n\n<<<Tristan und Isolde>>>"
