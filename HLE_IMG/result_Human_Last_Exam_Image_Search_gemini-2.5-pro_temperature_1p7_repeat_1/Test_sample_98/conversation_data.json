    "The object shown in the image is a bronze matrix, or die, used for producing gold foil ornaments. It was discovered in Co»ôoveni de Jos, Romania, and is a notable example of Germanic art from the Migration Period.\n\nArchaeologists date this matrix to the 5th century AD. Its design, featuring two confronting busts, was inspired by 4th-century Late Roman imperial medallions, particularly those of Emperor Constantius II and his wife, Eusebia. While the artistic influence is Roman, the object itself was created and used by Germanic peoples, likely the Goths or Gepids, during the subsequent century.\n\n<<<5th century AD>>>"
