    "The title of the 19th-century painting, a fragment of which is presented, is **\"The fire in the De Nachtegaal windmill on the Lauriergracht, seen from the Nassaukade\"** (original Dutch title: \"De brand van molen De Nachtegaal op de Lauriergracht gezien vanaf de Nassaukade\").\n\nThis dramatic artwork, created between 1850 and 1870, is attributed to a follower of the celebrated Dutch artist Rembrandt van Rijn. The painting captures a nighttime fire engulfing the \"De Nachtegaal\" (The Nightingale) windmill, which was located on the Lauriergracht in Amsterdam. The scene is depicted from the perspective of the Nassaukade, with the dark, turbulent sky illuminated by the flames, creating a powerful and atmospheric composition.\n\n<<<De brand van molen De Nachtegaal op de Lauriergracht gezien vanaf de Nassaukade>>>"
