    "Here is an identification of each specimen and their order based on increasing silicate structure complexity.\n\n*   **Specimen C: Olivine**\n    This specimen shows a granular mass of olive-green crystals, which is characteristic of olivine. Olivine is a **nesosilicate**, which has the simplest silicate structure, consisting of isolated silica tetrahedra bonded by ions like iron and magnesium.\n\n*   **Specimen A: Pyroxene (likely Augite or another Clinopyroxene)**\n    This is a dark, stubby, prismatic crystal. This crystal habit is common for pyroxenes like augite. Pyroxenes are **inosilicates** with a single-chain structure, where tetrahedra link to form long chains by sharing oxygen atoms. This structure is more complex than the isolated tetrahedra of nesosilicates.\n\n*   **Specimen B: Mica (likely Muscovite or Chlorite)**\n    The image displays a green, flaky mineral that easily separates into thin sheets, a key characteristic of the mica group or similar minerals like chlorite. These are **phyllosilicates**, or sheet silicates. In this structure, tetrahedra share three of their four oxygen atoms, forming extensive two-dimensional sheets. This represents a higher degree of polymerization than chain silicates.\n\n*   **Specimen D: Quartz**\n    This is a translucent, hexagonal prismatic crystal with a glassy luster, which are classic identifying features of quartz. Quartz is a **tectosilicate**, or framework silicate. In this structure, every silica tetrahedron shares all four of its oxygen atoms with neighboring tetrahedra, creating a complete three-dimensional framework. This is the most complex of the silicate structures.\n\n### Order of Increasing Silicate Structure Complexity\n\nThe order from the simplest to the most complex silicate structure is based on the degree of polymerization, or how the silica tetrahedra are linked.\n\n1.  **C (Olivine)**: Nesosilicate (Isolated Tetrahedra)\n2.  **A (Pyroxene)**: Inosilicate (Single Chains)\n3.  **B (Mica/Chlorite)**: Phyllosilicate (Sheets)\n4.  **D (Quartz)**: Tectosilicate (Framework)\n\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
