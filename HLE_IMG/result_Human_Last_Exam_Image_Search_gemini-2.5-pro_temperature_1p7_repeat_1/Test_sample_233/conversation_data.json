    "Based on a detailed analysis of the runic inscription visible in the image fragment, the runestone depicted is identified as **Sö 279**. This identification is cataloged in the *Samnordisk runtextdatabas* (Scandinavian Runic-text Database).\n\nThe runes visible in the three lines of the image correspond to a portion of the Sö 279 inscription. Although some characters are partially obscured, the identifiable sequence aligns with the transliteration of this specific stone. It is one of approximately 26 Ingvar runestones, which commemorate those who died in a Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled.\n\nThis runestone is notable because its inscription mentions the sons of a man named Eimund who died \"in the south in Serkland\" (the land of the Saracens), which is believed to be the final destination of Ingvar's expedition. It is one of three runestone fragments connected to Ingvar's expedition located at the Strängnäs Cathedral. Theories proposed by some researchers connect this stone to others, suggesting that Ingvar the Far-Travelled may have been the son of the Swedish king Emund the Old.\n\n<<<Sö 279>>>"
