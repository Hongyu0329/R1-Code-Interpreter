    "To determine which image represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the direction, we need to understand the projected arrangement of atoms.\n\nIn an FCC lattice, when viewed along the direction, the atoms project onto a 2D plane forming a distinctive rectangular pattern. The key features of this projection are:\n*   The atoms form layers.\n*   The projection of the conventional unit cell is a rectangle.\n*   Within this rectangle, there will be atoms at the four corners and one atom in the exact center of the rectangle. This is because the (110) plane in an FCC structure cuts through corner atoms and face-centered atoms.\n\nNow let's analyze the given options:\n*   **Image A:** Shows a rectangular arrangement with atoms at the corners and two atoms along the shorter sides, but not one in the center of the rectangle.\n*   **Image B:** This image does not show a clear, repeating rectangular or centered pattern consistent with a simple crystallographic projection. The atoms seem irregularly spaced within the outlined cell.\n*   **Image C:** Shows a centered rectangular pattern. There are atoms at the corners of the outlined rectangle and a single atom in the middle. This arrangement matches the description of an FCC lattice viewed along the direction. The unit cell in this view is a rectangle, and there is an atom at its center.\n*   **Image D:** This pattern is more complex and dense than the expected projection. It shows multiple atoms within the cell but does not have the simple centered rectangular symmetry of the view.\n\nBased on this analysis, image C correctly depicts the atomic arrangement of an FCC crystal structure when viewed from the direction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
