    "The product advertised with claims of helping new female workers overcome \"inherent limitations\" during World War II was the sanitary towel. The specific brand heavily promoted with the imagery of women working on tanks was Southalls.\n\nHowever, the question specifies a product with a French-derived name. While the advertisement shown is for the British brand Southalls, another product line was heavily marketed to women war workers with a distinctly French name: **Bourjois**.\n\nThe French cosmetics company Bourjois ran campaigns in Britain with slogans like \"Beauty is your duty\" and \"for your beauty in battledress.\" These ads encouraged women to maintain morale, which was considered a vital part of the war effort. While not addressing a physical limitation in the same way as a sanitary product, the campaign implied that using makeup helped women overcome the psychological strains and challenges of wartime work. Bourjois cosmetics, including their famous \"Evening in Paris\" line, were sold by retailers like Boots and Timothy Whites, as mentioned in the provided advertisement. It is likely that elements from these two separate, but concurrent, advertising campaigns have been combined in the question's description.\n\n<<<Bourjois>>>"
