    "The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that helps to distinguish them at a glance is the seta. In *Grimmia montana*, the sporophyte has a straight seta, which holds the capsule erect. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by its arcuate, or curved, seta.\n\nTo summarize:\n*   ***Grimmia montana***: Possesses a **straight seta**.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta***: Features an **arcuate (curved) seta**.\n\nThis distinction in the orientation of the seta is the most readily observable feature for separating the two species when they are bearing sporophytes.\n\n<<<The key distinguishing feature of the sporophyte at a glance is the seta: it is straight in *Grimmia montana* and curved (arcuate) in *Grimmia curviseta*.>>>"
