    "The search results confirm that the acid-catalyzed reaction of friedel-3-ol involves a significant \"backbone rearrangement\" of the fused ring system to produce a thermodynamically more stable oleanene skeleton. Specifically, documents mention the conversion of friedel-3-ene to olean-13(18)-ene. The mechanism involves a series of seven sequential shifts of methyl groups and hydride ions.\n\nTo accurately determine what substituent (H or CH3) is at each of the five marked positions in the product, I need to meticulously follow this complex rearrangement.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the Wagner-Meerwein shifts in the friedelane-oleanane rearrangement, starting from the carbocation formed after the loss of water from the protonated alcohol:\n\n1.  **Initial Carbocation Formation:** The OH group at C-3 is protonated and leaves as water, forming a secondary carbocation at C-3. However, this is rapidly followed by a hydride shift from C-4 to C-3 to form a more stable tertiary carbocation at C-4.\n2.  **Shift 1:** The methyl group at C-5 (originally attached to a carbon adjacent to the C-4 carbocation) migrates to C-4. The positive charge is now at C-5.\n3.  **Shift 2:** A hydride at C-10 migrates to C-5. The positive charge is now at C-10.\n4.  **Shift 3:** The methyl group at C-9 migrates to C-10. The positive charge is now at C-9.\n5.  **Shift 4:** The hydride at C-8 migrates to C-9. The positive charge is now at C-8.\n6.  **Shift 5:** The methyl group at C-14 migrates to C-8. The positive charge is now at C-14.\n7.  **Shift 6:** The methyl group at C-13 migrates to C-14. The positive charge is now at C-13.\n8.  **Shift 7:** A hydride from C-18 migrates to C-13. The positive charge moves to C-18.\n9.  **Final Elimination:** A proton is lost from C-13 to form the double bond between C-13 and C-18, resulting in the final product, olean-13(18)-ene.\n\nNow let's trace the groups at the numbered positions by comparing the reactant (friedel-3-ol) and the product (olean-13(18)-ene).\n\n*   **Position 1:** This methyl group was originally on C-4 in friedelanol. It remains attached to its original carbon, which is not involved in the backbone migration itself (though it is adjacent to the start of it). It is a **CH3** group.\n*   **Position 2:** This methyl group was originally on C-5 in friedelanol. It migrates to C-4 (Shift 1). In the final product, it's at the position corresponding to the original C-4 methyl group. Therefore, the substituent at position 2 is a **CH3** group.\n*   **Position 3:** This was originally the hydrogen at C-10 in friedelanol. It migrates to C-5 (Shift 2). So, the substituent at position 3 is an **H** atom.\n*   **Position 4:** This methyl group was originally on C-9 in friedelanol. It migrates to C-10 (Shift 3). The substituent at position 4 is a **CH3** group.\n*   **Position 5:** This was originally the hydrogen at C-8 in friedelanol. It migrates to C-9 (Shift 4). The substituent at position 5 is an **H** atom.\n\nBased on this detailed mechanistic analysis, I can now determine the identity of each substituent.\n\n1 = CH3\n2 = CH3\n3 = H\n4 = CH3\n5 = H\n\nFinal check of the structures:\n- Position 1 is a methyl group on the A/B ring junction that has not moved.\n- Positions 2, 3, 4, 5 are all on the C/D ring junction area, which is the heart of the rearrangement.\n- Reactant:\n    - C4 has two CH3s.\n    - C5 has a CH3 and an H.\n    - C8 has an H.\n    - C9 has a CH3.\n    - C10 has an H.\n- Product (after shifts):\n    - Position 1: Unmigrated CH3 from C4. So, 1=CH3.\n    - Position 2: Migrated CH3 from C5. So, 2=CH3.\n    - Position 3: Migrated H from C10. So, 3=H.\n    - Position 4: Migrated CH3 from C9. So, 4=CH3.\n    - Position 5: Migrated H from C8. So, 5=H.\n\nThe assignment seems consistent with the known friedelane-oleanane rearrangement. I am confident in this answer.1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H.\n\nI will now format the answer as requested.\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
