    "This phenomenon is known as the **auditory continuity illusion** or **perceptual restoration**.\n\nThe image displays a classic example of this illusion. The top panel (spectrogram) and bottom panel (waveform) illustrate a pure tone that is interrupted by a burst of noise. Listeners typically do not perceive the tone as stopping and starting again; instead, they experience the illusion of the tone continuing uninterrupted \"behind\" the noise.\n\nThis effect is a type of \"filling-in\" where the brain assumes that the interrupting sound is merely masking the continuous tone in the background. This auditory illusion is a fundamental aspect of hearing, allowing us to perceive continuous sounds, like speech or music, in noisy environments where parts of the signal might be temporarily obscured. The phenomenon is robust and can occur with various sounds, including tones of changing pitch, speech, and melodies.\n\nThe comparison to the Necker Cube is apt because both are examples of how the brain resolves sensory ambiguity. While the Necker Cube leads to bistable perception of a constant visual stimulus, the auditory continuity illusion demonstrates the brain's ability to create a seamless perceptual experience from a physically discontinuous sound, a common and usually unconscious process.\n\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion>>>"
