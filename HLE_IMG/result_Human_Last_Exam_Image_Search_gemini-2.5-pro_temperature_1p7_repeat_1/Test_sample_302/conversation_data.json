    "The seal contains four characters written in a traditional Chinese seal script. The standard reading order for such seals is from top to bottom and right to left.\n\nThe characters are identified as follows:\n*   **Top Right:** 長 (cháng)\n*   **Bottom Right:** 樂 (lè)\n*   **Top Left:** 永 (yǒng)\n*   **Bottom Left:** 康 (kāng)\n\nWhen read in the correct order, the phrase is **長樂永康** (Cháng Lè Yǒng Kāng). This is a traditional auspicious saying.\n\nIn simplified Chinese, the characters are **长乐永康**.\n\nThis phrase conveys a wish for \"Eternal Joy and Everlasting Health\". The term \"長樂\" (cháng lè) translates to eternal or great happiness, while \"永康\" (yǒng kāng) means everlasting health and peace. This phrase can be found in various forms of Chinese art and literature, including calligraphy and historical artifacts like Han Dynasty tiles.\n\n<<<长乐永康>>>"
