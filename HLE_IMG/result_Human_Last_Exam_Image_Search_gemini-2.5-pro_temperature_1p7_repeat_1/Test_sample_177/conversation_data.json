    "To determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we need to calculate the total Car VMT for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios and then find the percentage difference.\n\nThe VMT for each scenario is calculated by taking a weighted average based on the share of trips, the mode share for cars, and the average distance for each trip length category. The car's occupancy is not relevant for calculating Vehicle Miles Traveled, only for Person Miles Traveled.\n\n### **1. Calculate Baseline Car VMT**\n\nFirst, we calculate a VMT index for the baseline scenario by summing the VMT contributions from each distance category. The formula for each category's contribution is:\n*(Share of total trips) x (Combined car mode share) x (Average trip distance)*\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** 0.48 (share of trips) × (0.25 + 0.28) (car share) × 1 (avg. distance) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles:** 0.22 × (0.38 + 0.43) × 4 = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles:** 0.14 × (0.40 + 0.45) × 7.5 = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles:** 0.16 × (0.42 + 0.47) × 20 = 2.848\n\n**Total Baseline Car VMT Index = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.848 = 4.7077**\n\n### **2. Calculate Proposed Car VMT**\n\nNext, we calculate the VMT index for the proposed scenario using the same methodology:\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** 0.48 (share of trips) × (0.01 + 0.02) (car share) × 1 (avg. distance) = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles:** 0.22 × (0.08 + 0.19) × 4 = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles:** 0.14 × (0.14 + 0.27) × 7.5 = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles:** 0.16 × (0.16 + 0.33) × 20 = 1.568\n\n**Total Proposed Car VMT Index = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.568 = 2.2505**\n\n### **3. Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage reduction using the following formula:\n*Percentage Reduction = ((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) × 100*\n\n*   **VMT Reduction** = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100 ≈ 52.2%\n\nBy changing the mode share composition as proposed, the Car VMT can be reduced by approximately 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
