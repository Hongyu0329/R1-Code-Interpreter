    "Based on the properties of Delaunay triangulations, we can determine which of the diagrams violates the empty circle property.\n\n1.  **Definition of a Triangulation**: First, a triangulation must be a planar graph, which means none of its edges are allowed to cross.\n    *   In diagram **A**, several edges cross each other (for example, the edge connecting the top vertex and the inner-right vertex crosses the edge from the top-right vertex to the inner-left vertex).\n    *   In diagram **D**, there are numerous crossing edges.\n    *   Because they contain crossing edges, A and D are not valid geometric triangulations. Therefore, they cannot be Delaunay triangulations.\n\n2.  **The Empty Circle Property**: For a valid triangulation to be a Delaunay triangulation, it must satisfy the empty circle property: the circumcircle of any triangle in the triangulation must not contain any other points of the set in its interior. A violation of this property occurs when an edge is \"illegal,\" meaning a vertex of an adjacent triangle falls inside the other triangle's circumcircle.\n\n3.  **Analysis of C and B**: Diagrams B and C appear to be valid triangulations as their edges do not cross. We must determine which one violates the empty circle property. Let's examine the quadrilateral formed by the top-most vertex, the two upper-inner vertices, and the bottom-inner vertex.\n    *   In diagram **C**, this quadrilateral is divided by a horizontal edge connecting the two upper-inner vertices. This forms a triangle at the top. The circumcircle drawn around this top triangle (passing through the top vertex and the two upper-inner vertices) would be large. The bottom-inner vertex clearly lies inside this circle.\n    *   This configuration in C demonstrates a classic example of an \"illegal edge.\" Because a point (the bottom-inner vertex) is inside the circumcircle of the top triangle, triangulation C violates the empty circle property.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: Triangulation B appears to be the correct Delaunay triangulation where all circumcircles are empty. Triangulation C is a valid triangulation but violates the empty circle property. A and D are not valid triangulations to begin with.\n\nTherefore, C is the triangulation that violates the empty circle property.\n\n<<<C>>>"
