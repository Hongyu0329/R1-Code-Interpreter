    "The epiphytic species in the image belongs to the genus *Radula*.\n\nThe organism displays the characteristic features of a leafy liverwort, a group of non-vascular plants that often grow on tree bark. Specifically, its flattened, branching, and overlapping growth habit, where it is pressed closely against the bark, is distinctive.\n\nThe genus *Radula* encompasses about 200 species of small liverworts that commonly appear as scaly patches on tree trunks. A key feature of *Radula*, which aligns with the image, is the absence of underleaves and the presence of rhizoids (root-like structures) that grow from the leaf lobules, anchoring the plant to its substrate. While some other liverwort genera like *Frullania* can also appear as dark, almost black patches on trees, the overall morphology in the photograph is highly consistent with *Radula*.\n\n<<<Radula>>>"
