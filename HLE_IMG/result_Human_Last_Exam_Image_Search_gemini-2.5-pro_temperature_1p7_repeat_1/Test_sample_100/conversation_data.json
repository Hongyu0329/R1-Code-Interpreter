    "Here is a step-by-step determination of the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material and Reaction 1 (Deprotection)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is 2-(4-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. The p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group is a protecting group for the nitrogen atom. Its molecular formula is C15H14F3NO2.\n*   **Reaction 1:** The reagents are Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in acetonitrile (ACN) and water (H2O). CAN is a strong oxidizing agent commonly used to remove PMB protecting groups from nitrogen atoms. This reaction cleaves the PMB group and replaces it with a hydrogen atom on the nitrogen.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. To find its formula, we subtract the atoms of the PMB group (C8H8O, the p-methoxybenzoyl fragment that is removed) and add one hydrogen to the nitrogen.\n    *   Formula of starting material: C15H14F3NO2\n    *   Removing the PMB group (C8H9O) and adding H gives a net change of -8C, -8H, -1O.\n    *   Formula of Intermediate 1: C(15-8)H(14-8)F3N1O(2-1) = **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of Reaction 2 (Hydrogenation)**\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Intermediate 1 is treated with hydrogen gas (H2) and a Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst in methanol (MeOH). This is a standard catalytic hydrogenation reaction.\n*   **Mechanism:** The Pd/C catalyst facilitates the addition of two hydrogen atoms across the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the bicyclic ring system, converting it into a single bond (C-C). This process is also known as reduction.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The double bond is saturated, leading to the formation of 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n    *   Formula of Intermediate 1: C7H6F3NO\n    *   Adding two hydrogen atoms: C7H(6+2)F3NO\n    *   Formula of Intermediate 2: **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of Reaction 3 (Hydrolysis)**\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Intermediate 2 is heated with 4 N hydrochloric acid (HCl). These conditions promote the hydrolysis of the lactam (cyclic amide) functional group.\n*   **Mechanism:** A water molecule is added across the amide bond (CO-N), causing the ring to open. The carbonyl group is converted to a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the nitrogen atom becomes an amino group (-NH2), which is protonated to an ammonium group (-NH3+) in the acidic conditions.\n*   **Product:** The bicyclic structure opens to form a substituted cyclopentane ring. The final product is 4-amino-2-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid.\n    *   Formula of Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO\n    *   Adding one molecule of water (H2O): C7H(8+2)F3N1O(1+1)\n    *   Formula of the final product: **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\nBased on the analysis of each step of the reaction, the molecular formula of the final product is determined to be C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
