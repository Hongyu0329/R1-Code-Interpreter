    "Here is the determination of the biological sexes for each pair of insects:\n\n**Pair A: Cuckoo Bees**\nThe insect on the left is a female *Coelioxys* bee, also known as a sharp-tailed or cuckoo leafcutter bee. Females of this genus have a distinctively long, pointed, cone-shaped abdomen which they use to pierce the nests of their host bees to lay eggs. The insect on the right is a *Triepeolus* cuckoo bee. While sex-specific features aren't perfectly clear in the image, male cuckoo bees generally resemble females but have differences in the number of antennal and abdominal segments.\n*   **Insect A (Left):** Female\n*   **Insect A (Right):** Male\n\n**Pair B: Paper Wasps**\nThe insect on the right is a male paper wasp (*Polistes*). A key characteristic of male paper wasps is antennae that are curled or hooked at the tip. The insect on the left is a female paper wasp, identified by its shorter, straighter antennae and a pointed abdomen which houses the stinger. Males lack a stinger.\n*   **Insect B (Left):** Female\n*   **Insect B (Right):** Male\n\n**Pair C: Long-horned Bees**\nThe insect on the left is a male long-horned bee from the tribe Eucerini (e.g., *Melissodes*). A primary indicator is its exceptionally long antennae, a trait for which the group is named and which is characteristic of males. Male bees also lack pollen-collecting scopae. The insect on the right is a female of the same group, identifiable by her comparatively short antennae. Female long-horned bees have dense pollen-collecting hairs (scopae) on their hind legs, which appears to be the case here, although they are not prominent in this specific image. The prompt's mention of \"taxa without scopae\" likely refers to cleptoparasitic bees like those in Pair A or to the fact that males in any bee species lack scopae.\n*   **Insect C (Left):** Male\n*   **Insect C (Right):** Female\n\nBased on this analysis, the sequence of pairings is:\n*   A: Female, Male (4)\n*   B: Female, Male (4)\n*   C: Male, Female (3)\n\n<<<4, 4, 3>>>"
