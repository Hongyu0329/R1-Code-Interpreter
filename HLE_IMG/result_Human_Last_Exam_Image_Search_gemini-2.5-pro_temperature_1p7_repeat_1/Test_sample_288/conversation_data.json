    "The venue in the image is the McMenamins Crystal Ballroom in Portland, Oregon. On October 12, 2023, two different sources indicate musical artists played at this location. One source lists Tate McRae performing, while another indicates a performance by Cavalera. It is possible that these artists performed in different spaces within the same venue, as the McMenamins Crystal Ballroom property hosts multiple stages.\n\nA fan review for a Tate McRae concert on October 12th, 2023, mentions issues with ADA accommodations at the venue. Another concert listing confirms Cavalera played the Crystal Ballroom on the same date as part of their 2023 tour.\n\n<<<Cavalera and Tate McRae>>>"
