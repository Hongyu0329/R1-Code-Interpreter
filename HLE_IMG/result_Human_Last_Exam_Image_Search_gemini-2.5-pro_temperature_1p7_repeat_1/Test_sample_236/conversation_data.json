    "The animal depicted in the center of the image is the Goldenrod Soldier Beetle. Its scientific name is *Chauliognathus pensylvanicus*.\n\nThis insect is also commonly known as the Pennsylvania leatherwing. It belongs to the soldier beetle family, Cantharidae. The name \"soldier beetle\" is thought to come from their red and black coloration, which resembles 17th and 18th-century British military uniforms.\n\nGoldenrod soldier beetles are identifiable by their elongated, orange bodies, a black spot on their thorax (the part behind the head), and a distinct black oval mark on each soft, leathery wing cover. Their heads and legs are black. They are frequently found on goldenrod and other yellow flowers in late summer and early fall, feeding on pollen and nectar, as well as preying on aphids and other small insects. They are considered beneficial insects because they are important pollinators and help control pest populations.\n\n<<<*Chauliognathus pensylvanicus*>>>"
