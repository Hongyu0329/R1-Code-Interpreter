    "The cuneiform sign shown is an archaic or pictographic form of the Sumerian sign É. The primary meaning of this sign is \"house\" or \"temple\".\n\nThe image represents the sign as it would have appeared in the late fourth or early third millennium BCE. At that time, cuneiform signs were often pictographs, meaning they were simple drawings of the object or concept they represented. This sign is a schematic drawing of a building's floor plan, which evolved into more abstract, wedge-shaped forms over time.\n\nThe Sumerian term É could refer to a simple house, but also to a larger, more significant building like a \"big house\" (É.GAL), which meant palace, or a temple dedicated to a deity. For instance, the temple of the god Enlil in the city of Nippur was called E-kur, or \"mountain temple\". Therefore, \"home\" is an accurate translation of the sign's fundamental meaning.\n\n<<<D>>>"
