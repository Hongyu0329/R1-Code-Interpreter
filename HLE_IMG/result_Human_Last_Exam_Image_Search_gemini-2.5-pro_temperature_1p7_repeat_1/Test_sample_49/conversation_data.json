    "To determine the cutoff frequency at node `a_0`, we first need to find the Thévenin equivalent resistance (`R_th`) of the network as seen from node `a_0` and ground. The cutoff frequency is then given by the standard formula for an RC circuit.\n\n### 1. Thévenin Resistance (R_th)\n\nThe Thévenin resistance is the equivalent resistance between node `a_0` and ground (`b_0`) when all independent sources are turned off. In this case, the input source `IN` at node `c_0` is grounded.\n\nFrom the circuit diagram, node `a_0` is connected to node `d_1` through a resistor `r`. Therefore, the total Thévenin resistance at `a_0` is the sum of this resistor and the equivalent resistance from node `d_1` to ground (`R_d1,gnd`):\n\n`R_th = r + R_d1,gnd`\n\n### 2. Resistance of the Infinite Ladder (R_d1,gnd)\n\n`R_d1,gnd` is the resistance of the semi-infinite ladder looking from node `d_1`, with node `c_0` grounded. We can solve this by setting up and solving the recurrence relations for the voltages at the nodes.\n\nLet `v_n` be the voltage at node `d_n` and `u_n` be the voltage at node `c_n`, relative to ground. The circuit's behavior is described by Kirchhoff's current law at each node for `n ≥ 1`:\n*   At node `d_n`: `(v_n - v_{n-1})/r + (v_n - u_n)/r + (v_n - v_{n+1})/r = 0`\n*   At node `c_n`: `(u_n - u_{n-1})/r + (u_n - v_n)/r + (u_n - u_{n+1})/r = 0`\n\nThese can be simplified to:\n1.  `3v_n - v_{n-1} - u_n - v_{n+1} = 0`\n2.  `3u_n - u_{n-1} - v_n - u_{n+1} = 0`\n\nFor the semi-infinite ladder (`n ≥ 1`) with boundary condition `u_0 = 0`, the general solutions for voltages that remain finite as `n` approaches infinity are of the form:\n`v_n = A(1 + α^n)`\n`u_n = A(1 - α^n)`\n\nHere, `α = 2 - √3` is the decaying root of the characteristic equation `x² - 4x + 1 = 0`. This solution form satisfies the recurrence relations and the boundary condition at `u_0 = 0`.\n\nTo find `R_d1,gnd`, we calculate the ratio of the voltage at node `d_1` (`v_1`) to the total current injected at that node (`I_1`). The injected current flows to nodes `u_1` and `d_2`.\n\n`I_1 = (v_1 - u_1)/r + (v_1 - v_2)/r`\n\nSubstituting the general solutions for `v_n` and `u_n`:\n*   `v_1 = A(1 + α)`\n*   `u_1 = A(1 - α)`\n*   `v_2 = A(1 + α²)`\n\nThe current is:\n`I_1 = (A(1+α) - A(1-α))/r + (A(1+α) - A(1+α²))/r`\n`I_1 = (A/r) * [2α + α - α²] = (A/r) * (3α - α²)`\n\nNow, we can find the resistance:\n`R_d1,gnd = v_1 / I_1 = A(1+α) / [(A/r) * (3α - α²)] = r * (1+α) / (3α - α²)`\n\nUsing the property `α² - 4α + 1 = 0`, we get `α² = 4α - 1`. Substituting this into the resistance expression:\n`R_d1,gnd = r * (1+α) / (3α - (4α - 1)) = r * (1+α) / (1-α)`\n\nFinally, substituting the value of `α = 2 - √3`:\n`R_d1,gnd = r * (1 + 2 - √3) / (1 - (2 - √3)) = r * (3 - √3) / (√3 - 1)`\n`R_d1,gnd = r * √3(√3 - 1) / (√3 - 1) = r√3`\n\n### 3. Total Thévenin Resistance and Cutoff Frequency\n\nNow, we substitute `R_d1,gnd` back into the expression for `R_th`:\n`R_th = r + r√3 = r(1 + √3)`\n\nThe cutoff frequency `ω_c` (in radians per second) for a simple RC low-pass filter is given by `ω_c = 1 / (R_th * C)`. The cutoff frequency `f_c` (in Hertz) is `f_c = ω_c / (2π)`. The question can be interpreted as asking for the angular frequency, which provides a cleaner expression.\n\n`ω_c = 1 / (r(1 + √3)C)`\n\n<<<The angular cutoff frequency at node $a_0$ is given by the expression: $ \\omega_c = \\frac{1}{r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C} $.>>>"
