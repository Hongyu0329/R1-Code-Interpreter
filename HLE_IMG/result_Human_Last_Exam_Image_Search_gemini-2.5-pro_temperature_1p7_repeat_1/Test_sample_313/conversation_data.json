    "The correct answer is **Felt Hat**.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the clues:\n\n**Clue 1: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"**\n\nThe man pictured receiving the award is the former Russian professional footballer Andrei Arshavin. The event is the Russian Football Union's end-of-season awards ceremony, which took place on June 20, 2019. Arshavin is famous for, among other things, scoring four goals in a single Premier League match for Arsenal against Liverpool, an achievement often referred to as a \"super hat-trick\". This connects him metaphorically to the word \"Hat\".\n\n**Clue 2: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"**\n\nThis refers to a **Felt Hat**. For centuries, hat makers used mercuric nitrate in a process called \"carroting\" to treat the animal fur used to make high-quality felt. This process exposed workers to mercury vapors, leading to a neurological disorder known as \"mad hatter disease\" or erethism. Due to the severe health risks, the use of mercury in hat-making was eventually banned and has almost entirely ceased, replaced by safer alternatives.\n\nTherefore, the \"Felt Hat\" is the X Y that connects the man pictured (via his \"hat-trick\" fame) and the historical object made with toxic mercury salts.\n\n<<<Felt Hat>>>"
