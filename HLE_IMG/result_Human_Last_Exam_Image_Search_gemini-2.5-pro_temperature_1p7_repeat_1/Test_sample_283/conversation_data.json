    "The Google Trends graph displays the search interest for three different historical events in a single country. An analysis of the dates of the recurring peaks in search interest points to the United States. The three events are:\n\n*   **Martin Luther King Jr. Day (Red Line):** This federal holiday is observed on the third Monday of January each year, which aligns with the recurring winter peaks of the red line. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" is the most searched speech in U.S. Google history.\n\n*   **Memorial Day (Blue Line):** This federal holiday, honoring military personnel who died in service, occurs on the last Monday of May. This corresponds to the consistent late-spring peak shown by the blue line just before the summer peaks of the yellow line.\n\n*   **Juneteenth (Yellow Line):** This holiday commemorates the end of slavery in the United States on June 19th. The yellow line shows annual peaks in June. Critically, President Joe Biden signed legislation making Juneteenth a federal holiday on June 17, 2021. This explains the significant increase in search interest (the height of the peaks) for the yellow line starting in 2021, as seen in the graph. Before it became a federal holiday, interest was notably lower.\n\nThe distinct annual timing of these three holidays and the dramatic change in search volume for Juneteenth after its establishment as a federal holiday are strong indicators that the country in question is the United States.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
