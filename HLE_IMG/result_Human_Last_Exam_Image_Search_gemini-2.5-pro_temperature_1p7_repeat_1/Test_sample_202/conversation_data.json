    "Based on the visual characteristics of the rock specimens and supporting geological information, here are the identifications:\n\n*   **H: Scoria**\n    This specimen is a dark-colored, highly porous (vesicular) volcanic rock. Its reddish-brown color suggests the presence of iron that has been oxidized. Scoria is formed when gas-rich lava is ejected from a volcano and cools rapidly. It is typically dark brown, black, or reddish and, unlike pumice, is denser and will sink in water.\n\n*   **I: Volcanic Breccia**\n    This rock is composed of angular, broken fragments (clasts) of other rocks cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. The presence of what appear to be volcanic rock fragments of various colors suggests this is a volcanic breccia. This type of breccia forms from explosive volcanic eruptions that shatter rock which is then fused together by ash and lava.\n\n*   **J: Pumice**\n    This is a light-colored, extremely porous volcanic rock filled with many small holes (vesicles). Pumice is created when frothy, gas-filled, viscous magma cools rapidly, trapping the bubbles within the rock. It is typically white to gray and has such a low density that it can often float on water.\n\n*   **K: Pegmatite**\n    This specimen is a coarse-grained igneous rock with very large, interlocking crystals. This phaneritic texture indicates that the magma from which it formed cooled very slowly, deep within the Earth's crust, allowing large crystals to grow. Pegmatites are known for having crystals larger than 1 centimeter, and often consist of minerals like quartz and feldspar, similar to granite.\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Volcanic Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite>>>"
