    "The knot in the image is known as the prime knot 8₁₈.\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant, often denoted as *s*, is a numerical value assigned to a knot that is derived from a concept in mathematics called Khovanov homology. For the 8₁₈ knot, the Rasmussen s-invariant is **0**.\n\nThe knot 8₁₈ is also sometimes referred to as the \"Carrick loop\" in practical knot tying.\n\n<<<0>>>"
