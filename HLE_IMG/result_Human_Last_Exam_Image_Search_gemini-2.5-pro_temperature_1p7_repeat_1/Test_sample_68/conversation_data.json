    "<div class=\"knowledge-panel\">\n<div class=\"knowledge-panel-title\">French American Colonies Coinage</div>\n<div class=\"knowledge-panel-content\">\n<div class=\"caption\">This coin, a 9 Deniers, originates from the French colonies in the Americas.</div>\n<p>The coin in the image is a 9 Deniers minted for the French colonies during the reign of King Louis XV. An edict in June 1721 authorized the production of these copper coins, which were minted in 1721 and 1722.</p>\n<p>These coins were intended for circulation in France's American territories, which at the time included New France (comprising Quebec, Acadia, and Louisiana) and the French West Indies. The mints responsible for their production were located in Rouen (indicated by the mint mark 'B') and La Rochelle (mint mark 'H').</p>\n<p>In 1722, a shipment of 534,000 of these 9 Deniers coins was sent to Canada. However, the colonists were reluctant to use them. As a result, the majority of the coins were returned to France in 1726. Subsequently, these coins were sent to Louisiana, where they circulated more successfully, albeit at a reduced value of 6 deniers. A number of these coins were also sent to and circulated on Île Bourbon, now known as Réunion.</p>\n<p>Given this history, while the coin was created for the entirety of the French American colonies, it saw its most significant circulation in Louisiana and Île Bourbon.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<<<The French American Colonies>>>"
