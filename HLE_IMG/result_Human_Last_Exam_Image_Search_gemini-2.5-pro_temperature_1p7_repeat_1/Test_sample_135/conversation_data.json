    "This bas-relief is a detail from the **Altar of the Holy Sacrament** created by the Italian Renaissance sculptor and architect **Bernardo Rossellino**.\n\nThe altarpiece is located in the Cathedral of Pienza, in Tuscany, Italy. The cathedral itself, along with much of the town's center, was redesigned by Rossellino between 1459 and 1462 under the patronage of Pope Pius II. The inscription on the relief, \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AUTEL\", is French for \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" which corresponds to the Italian title of the work, \"Altare del Santissimo Sacramento.\"\n\nBernardo Rossellino (c. 1409â€“1464) was a prominent figure in the Florentine Renaissance, known for his ability to integrate sculpture and architecture, most famously in his design for the tomb of Leonardo Bruni in the church of Santa Croce, Florence. His work in Pienza, commissioned by the Pope, is considered a significant example of Renaissance urban planning. The altarpiece in the cathedral is one of the notable sculptural works within this grand project.\n\n<<<Bernardo Rossellino>>>"
