    "The time complexity of the provided sorting algorithm is determined by its recursive structure.\n\n### Analysis of the Algorithm\n\nThe given pseudocode is for a recursive function `sort(a, n)`:\n\n```python\ndef sort(a, n):\n  if n > 1:\n    # 1. First recursive call\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n\n    # 2. Comparison and potential swap (constant time)\n    if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n      swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])\n\n    # 3. Second recursive call\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n```\n\nTo find the time complexity, we can define a recurrence relation `T(n)` that represents the number of operations for an input of size `n`.\n\n1.  **Base Case:** If `n` is 1 or less, the function does nothing and returns. This takes constant time, `O(1)`.\n2.  **Recursive Step:** For `n > 1`, the function performs:\n    *   One recursive call on a subproblem of size `n-1`: `sort(a, n-1)`. This has a cost of `T(n-1)`.\n    *   One comparison and an optional swap. This is a constant time operation, `O(1)`.\n    *   A second recursive call on a subproblem of size `n-1`: `sort(a, n-1)`. This also has a cost of `T(n-1)`.\n\n### Recurrence Relation\n\nCombining these steps, the recurrence relation is:\n**T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c** (where `c` represents a constant time operation).\n\n### Solving the Recurrence\n\nThis recurrence relation can be solved by expansion:\n*   T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c\n*   T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 3c\n*   T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 7c\n*   ...and so on.\n\nThe general form becomes `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + (2^k - 1) * c`.\nIf we expand until we reach the base case `T(1)`, where `n-k = 1` or `k = n-1`:\nT(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-1) - 1) * c\n\nThe dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`, which means the time complexity is exponential. This specific algorithm is a known \"pessimal\" or humorously inefficient algorithm, sometimes called \"ExpoSort\", precisely because of this structure. It is designed to be extremely slow.\n\nTherefore, the time complexity is **O(2^n)**.\n\nThis corresponds to answer choice E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
