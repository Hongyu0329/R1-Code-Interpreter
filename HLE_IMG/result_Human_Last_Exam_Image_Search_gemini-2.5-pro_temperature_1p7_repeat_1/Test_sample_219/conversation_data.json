    "The timestamps of the synchronized bursts are approximately:\n*   Burst 1: 2 s\n*   Burst 2: 8 s\n*   Burst 3: 18 s\n*   Burst 4: 27 s\n*   Burst 5: 36 s\n*   Burst 6: 49 s\n\nTo calculate the average inter-burst interval (IBI), we find the time difference between consecutive bursts:\n*   IBI 1 = 8 s - 2 s = 6 s\n*   IBI 2 = 18 s - 8 s = 10 s\n*   IBI 3 = 27 s - 18 s = 9 s\n*   IBI 4 = 36 s - 27 s = 9 s\n*   IBI 5 = 49 s - 36 s = 13 s\n\nThe average IBI is the sum of the individual intervals divided by the number of intervals:\nAverage IBI = (6 + 10 + 9 + 9 + 13) / 5 = 47 / 5 = 9.4 s\n\nThe average inter-burst interval, to two significant figures, is 9.4 seconds.\n<<<9.4>>>"
