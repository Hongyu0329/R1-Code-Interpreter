    "The knot depicted in the image is known in knot theory as the 9₄₂ knot. This name indicates that it is a prime knot with nine crossings, and it holds the 42nd position in the standard knot table for nine-crossing knots.\n\nThe Jones polynomial, V(t), for the 9₄₂ knot is:\n\nt⁻⁶ - t⁻⁵ + 2t⁻⁴ - 2t⁻³ + 2t⁻² - 2t⁻¹ + 2 - t\n\n<<<t⁻⁶ - t⁻⁵ + 2t⁻⁴ - 2t⁻³ + 2t⁻² - 2t⁻¹ + 2 - t>>>"
