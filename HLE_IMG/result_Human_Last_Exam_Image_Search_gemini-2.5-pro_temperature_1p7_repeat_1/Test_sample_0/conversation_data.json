    "The sequence that guarantees a mate in 2 for black, without moving a black queen on the first move, is initiated by a check from the knight.\n\nThe key first move is:\n**1. ... Nf2+**\n\nThis move puts the white king in check. White has only two legal responses, and both lead to checkmate on Black's next move.\n\nThe two possible variations are:\n\n*   **If White plays 2. Kh1:** Black delivers checkmate with **2. ... Rxh2#**. The white king on h1 is checked by the rook. The king cannot capture the rook because the h2 square is also attacked by the black queen on a2. The king's other potential escape squares are also covered: g1 is controlled by the knight on f2, and g2 is controlled by the knight on f2, the bishop on h3, and the queen on a2.\n\n*   **If White plays 2. Nxf2:** Black delivers checkmate with **2. ... Qh1#**. The white king on g1 is checked by the queen on h1. The king cannot move as all adjacent squares are either occupied by its own pieces or attacked by black's pieces (f1 is attacked by the queen on h1; g2 is attacked by the bishop on h3 and the queen on a2). The queen on h1 cannot be captured by any of White's pieces.\n\nTherefore, regardless of White's move, Black can force checkmate on the second move.\n\n<<<Nf2+>>>"
