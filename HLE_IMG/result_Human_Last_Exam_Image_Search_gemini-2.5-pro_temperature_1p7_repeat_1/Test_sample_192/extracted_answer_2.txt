Based on the analysis of the provided XRD plot and comparison with standard crystallographic data for monoclinic CuO, the following table lists the prominent peaks with their assigned Miller (hkl) indices.

| Approximate Peak Position (2θ) | Miller Index (hkl) |
|----------------------------------|----------------------|
| 32.5°                            | (110)                |
| 35.5°                            | (-111) / (002)       |
| 38.7°                            | (111)                |
| 48.7°                            | (-202)               |
| 53.5°                            | (020)                |
| 58.3°                            | (202)                |
| 61.5°                            | (-113)               |

These assignments are consistent with standard reference patterns for pure CuO (JCPDS card numbers 48-1548 and 45-0937), confirming the crystalline nature and phase of the synthesized nanoparticles.
