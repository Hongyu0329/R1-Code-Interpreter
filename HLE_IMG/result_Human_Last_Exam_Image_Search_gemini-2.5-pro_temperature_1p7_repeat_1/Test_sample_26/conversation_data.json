    "To determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata, a harmonic analysis is necessary. The sonata is in the key of C minor.\n\n**Analysis of Measure 30:**\n*   **Key Signature:** C minor (three flats: B♭, E♭, A♭).\n*   **Notes in the measure:** The notes played throughout this measure are G♯, B♮, and D. These three notes form a G♯ diminished triad. The C natural in the right hand on the third beat acts as a non-chord tone, specifically an appoggiatura, resolving down to the B natural.\n*   **Harmonic Function:** In music theory, a diminished chord built on the raised seventh scale degree functions as the leading-tone chord, which creates strong tension that resolves to the tonic. The G♯ diminished chord in measure 30 resolves to an A minor chord in measure 31.\n*   **Context within C minor:** The A minor chord is the sixth degree (submediant) of C minor, but with a raised sixth scale degree (A♮ instead of the diatonic A♭). This is a common chromatic alteration. The G♯ diminished chord functions as a secondary leading-tone chord, \"borrowed\" from the key of A minor to lead into it.\n\nTherefore, the chord in measure 30 is the leading-tone chord of the following A minor chord. In Roman numeral analysis relative to the home key of C minor, this is written as a secondary function. The A minor chord is the submediant (vi), so the G-sharp diminished chord is the \"seven of six.\"\n\nAnother valid interpretation identifies the chord in measure 30 as an Augmented 6th chord. Some analyses point to the presence of augmented 6th chords in this transition, such as in measures 30 and 34. In this interpretation, the G# and B in the left hand against the D in the right hand could be analyzed with enharmonic spellings to function as part of an augmented sixth harmony leading to the dominant. However, the most direct and common analysis, given the clear resolution to A minor, is as a secondary leading-tone chord.\n\nThe correct Roman numeral is **vii°/vi**.\n\n<<<vii°/vi>>>"
