    "### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of the provided spectra (Mass Spectrometry, IR, ¹H NMR, ¹³C NMR, DEPT-135, and HSQC), the compound has been identified.\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrum (MS):** The molecular ion peak (M+) is observed at an m/z of 135. The odd molecular weight strongly suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms, a principle known as the Nitrogen Rule.\n\n2.  **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation:** Based on the NMR data, the molecular formula is deduced to be C₉H₁₃N. This formula gives a molecular weight of approximately 135.23 g/mol, which is consistent with the mass spectrum. The degree of unsaturation for this formula is calculated to be 4, which corresponds to the presence of a benzene ring.\n\n3.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum:** The spectrum shows absorptions characteristic of:\n    *   Aromatic C-H stretching (above 3000 cm⁻¹).\n    *   Aliphatic C-H stretching (below 3000 cm⁻¹).\n    *   Aromatic C=C bond stretching (in the 1450-1600 cm⁻¹ region).\n    This confirms the presence of both aromatic and saturated parts in the molecule.\n\n4.  **¹H NMR Spectrum:** The proton NMR spectrum reveals the following key signals:\n    *   A multiplet at approximately 7.2-7.4 ppm, integrating to 5 protons, which is characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n    *   A multiplet around 2.8 ppm with an integration of 1H.\n    *   A multiplet around 2.7 ppm with an integration of 2H.\n    *   A doublet around 1.2 ppm with an integration of 3H.\n    *   The total integration of protons is 11. The molecular formula C₉H₁₃N suggests 13 protons, meaning two exchangeable protons (likely from an -NH₂ group) are not distinctly observed, which is common.\n\n5.  **¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra:**\n    *   The ¹³C spectrum shows seven distinct signals.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Four signals appear at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3. The signal at 145.1 ppm does not appear in the DEPT-135 spectrum, indicating it is a quaternary carbon (the ipso-carbon of the benzene ring). The other three aromatic signals are positive in DEPT-135, confirming they are CH groups.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** Three signals appear at δ 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2.\n    *   The DEPT-135 experiment shows one negative signal and five positive signals in total. The negative signal must correspond to a CH₂ (methylene) group. The five positive signals correspond to CH (methine) and CH₃ (methyl) groups.\n    *   Combining the information, the aliphatic signals are assigned as follows: δ 43.5 is the CH₂ group (negative DEPT signal), and δ 49.6 and δ 19.2 are CH and CH₃ groups (positive DEPT signals).\n\n6.  **HSQC Spectrum:** This 2D spectrum correlates the proton signals with their directly attached carbons:\n    *   ¹H (~1.2 ppm, 3H) correlates to ¹³C (~19.2 ppm), confirming a CH₃ group. The multiplicity of the proton signal (doublet) indicates it is next to a CH group.\n    *   ¹H (~2.8 ppm, 1H) correlates to ¹³C (~49.6 ppm), confirming a CH group.\n    *   ¹H (~2.7 ppm, 2H) correlates to ¹³C (~43.5 ppm), confirming a CH₂ group.\n\n### Structure Elucidation\n\nAssembling the fragments gives the following structure:\n*   A monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   A propyl-amine side chain containing a CH₂ group, a CH group, and a CH₃ group, along with an -NH₂ group.\n*   The connectivity is determined by the coupling in the ¹H NMR. The CH₃ (δ 1.2) is a doublet, so it's attached to the CH. This gives a C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃ arrangement.\n\nThis structure is consistent with all spectral data. Reference spectral data for 1-phenylpropan-2-amine confirms the chemical shift assignments and multiplicities observed in the provided spectra. For example, a published spectrum of 1-phenylpropan-2-amine in DMSO-d₆ shows δ values of 140.59 (Cq), 129.61 (CH), 128.60 (CH), 126.27 (CH), 48.78 (CH), 46.78 (CH₂), and 23.79 (CH₃), which align well with the experimental data, considering potential minor differences due to experimental conditions. The compound is also known by the common name amphetamine.\n\nThe IUPAC name for this structure is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
