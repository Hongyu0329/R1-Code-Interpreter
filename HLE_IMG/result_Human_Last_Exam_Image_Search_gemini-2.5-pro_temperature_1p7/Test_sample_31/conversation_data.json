    "The knot in the attached picture is the 10_132 knot. Its Rasmussen invariant, often denoted as the s-invariant, is 2.\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant is a number associated with a knot that provides information about the surfaces it can bound in four-dimensional space. For alternating knots, this invariant is closely related to another knot property called the signature. However, for non-alternating knots like 10_132, the Rasmussen invariant can provide distinct information. For instance, the signature of the 10_132 knot is 0, while its Rasmussen invariant is 2.\n\nThe 10_132 knot is also known for being a transversely nonsimple knot, a significant example in the field of contact geometry.\n\n<<<2>>>"
