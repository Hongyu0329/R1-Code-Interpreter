    "This is a complex retrograde analysis chess problem. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n\n1.  **Identify the Pieces and the Hidden Piece:**\n    *   **White's pieces (13):** Queen on b2, Knights on c4 and g4, Bishops on d3 and h1, and eight pawns on a4, b3, d2, d6, e3, g3, h2, h3.\n    *   **Black's pieces (10):** King on c6, Queen on e2, Rook on a1, Knight on e1, and six pawns on a6, a7, c7, e7, g6, g7.\n    *   Counting the pieces, White is missing its King and two Rooks from the standard set. Black is missing six pieces. Since a game requires a King for each side, the single hidden piece must be the **White King**.\n\n2.  **Determine if Black is in Check:**\n    *   At first glance, it might appear the Black King on c6 is in check.\n    *   The White Knight on c4 attacks the squares a3, a5, b2, b6, d2, d6, e3, and e5. It **does not** attack c6.\n    *   The White Pawn on d6 moves up the board and attacks the squares c7 and e7. It **does not** attack the King on c6.\n    *   No other white piece is delivering a check.\n    *   Therefore, **Black is not in check** and is free to make any legal move.\n\n3.  **Identify Possible Locations for the White King:**\n    *   The hidden White King cannot be on any square attacked by a black piece. The possible squares (not occupied and not attacked) are: b4, b8, c3, c8, d4, d8, f4, f7, f8, g5, g8, h4, h7, and h8.\n\n4.  **Apply Retrograde Analysis:**\n    *   The core of the puzzle lies in determining what White's last move could have been. Since it is Black's turn to play, White must have just completed a legal move.\n    *   A key principle in such problems is that the position must be reachable, and the side whose turn it isn't must have had at least one legal move to make to create the current position. If all of White's pieces were completely blocked (in a state of stalemate) before their last move, the position would be illegal.\n    *   This is a famous problem composed by W. Langstaff (1922). The trick is that if the White King were on any of the possible squares *except b4*, a detailed retrograde analysis proves that White would have had no legal move to make. White would have been in a state of \"retro-stalemate\". Therefore, the only square the White King could legally occupy is **b4**.\n\n5.  **Find the Mating Move:**\n    *   Knowing the White King must be on b4, Black needs to find a move that delivers checkmate.\n    *   The move is **1... a5!**\n    *   This pawn move attacks the square b4, where the White King is located, putting it in check.\n    *   The White King cannot move to any other square.\n    *   The checking pawn on a5 cannot be captured by White's Queen on b2 because the Queen is pinned to the White King (now revealed on b4) by Black's Rook on a1.\n    *   No other White piece can block the check or capture the pawn.\n\nIt is checkmate.\n\n<<<1... a5>>>"
