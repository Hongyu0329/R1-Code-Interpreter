    "Here are the identities of the rock specimens:\n\n*   **H: Scoria** - This specimen is a reddish-brown, highly vesicular (holey) igneous rock. Its color and sponge-like texture are characteristic of scoria, which forms when gas-rich lava cools. It is typically darker and denser than pumice.\n\n*   **J: Pumice** - This is a light-colored, highly porous and vesicular rock. Its appearance is consistent with pumice, a volcanic rock that is so porous due to trapped gas bubbles that it can float on water. Pumice is typically white, cream, or grey.\n\n*   **I: Volcanic Breccia** - This rock is composed of angular fragments of various volcanic rocks cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This composition and texture, known as being poorly sorted, is characteristic of volcanic breccia. Volcanic breccia is formed from the accumulation of angular volcanic fragments larger than 2 mm in size.\n\n*   **K: Pegmatite** - This specimen is a coarse-grained igneous rock with large, interlocking crystals. This texture indicates that it cooled slowly from molten rock. Pegmatites are known for their exceptionally large crystals, often larger than 1 cm. The most common minerals in pegmatites are quartz, feldspar, and mica, similar in composition to granite.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Volcanic Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
