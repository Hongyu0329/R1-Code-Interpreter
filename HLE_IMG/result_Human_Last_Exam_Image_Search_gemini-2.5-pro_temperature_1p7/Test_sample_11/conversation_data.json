    "Based on the visible stripes, the country is Egypt.\n\nThe flag of Egypt consists of three equal horizontal bands of black, white, and red. The image provided shows the top-left corner, displaying the black stripe at the top, a portion of the white stripe in the middle, and the red stripe at the bottom. The central emblem, the Eagle of Saladin, is not visible in this cropped view.\n\nWhile the historical flag of the German Empire (1871-1918) also featured the same black, white, and red horizontal stripes, Egypt is the current nation represented by these colors in this arrangement. The flag of Yemen has similar colors but in a different order (red, white, and black).\n\n<<<Egypt>>>"
