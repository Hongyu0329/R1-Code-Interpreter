**Product A:**
The structure of product A, with the molecular formula C₁₄H₂₀N₂O₃, is a hydrated dihydropyrrolizine. It is formed via a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of the münchnone intermediate (derived from the starting material) with methyl propiolate, followed by decarboxylation and hydration of the imine bond during workup.


**Product B:**
The structure of product B, with the molecular formula C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₃, is a fused tricyclic system. It is formed from an intramolecular cyclization-condensation of product C, which is promoted by acetic anhydride and heat.


**Product C:**
The structure of product C, with the molecular formula C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₃, is the N-acetylated starting material. This is formed by the initial reaction of the starting amino acid's pyrrolidine nitrogen with acetic anhydride.
