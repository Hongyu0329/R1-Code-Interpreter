    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two products of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: 4π Electrocyclic Ring Opening**\n\nThe reaction starts with a substituted cyclobutene undergoing a thermal 4π electrocyclic ring opening. The starting material is **(±)-1-methoxy-4-methyl-4-methoxycyclobut-1-ene**. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a thermal 4π electrocyclic reaction proceeds via a **conrotatory** motion.\n\nThe starting material is chiral at the C4 carbon. The conrotatory ring-opening can occur in two different ways (clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of the terminal groups), which, starting from a chiral molecule, will produce two different diastereomeric dienes.\n\n*   Let's denote the substituents at C4 as Me (wedge, \"up\") and OMe (dash, \"down\").\n*   **Conrotatory Path A (e.g., clockwise rotation):** The \"up\" substituent (Me) rotates inward, and the \"down\" substituent (OMe) rotates outward.\n*   **Conrotatory Path B (e.g., counter-clockwise rotation):** The \"up\" substituent (Me) rotates outward, and the \"down\" substituent (OMe) rotates inward.\n\nThese two paths lead to the formation of two diastereomeric dienes. The overall structure of the diene formed, based on the connectivity of the starting material, is **2-methoxy-4-methyl-4-methoxy-1,3-butadiene**. The two diastereomers are the (3E)- and (3Z)-isomers.\n\n*   **(3Z)-diene**: The s-cis conformation for the Diels-Alder reaction places the methyl (Me) group in the \"outside\" position and the methoxy (OMe) group in the \"inside\" position.\n*   **(3E)-diene**: The s-cis conformation places the methoxy (OMe) group in the \"outside\" position and the methyl (Me) group in the \"inside\" position.\n\n**Step 2: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n\nThe second step is a Diels-Alder reaction between the intermediate dienes and ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CH-CO2Et`). The question specifies that the reaction occurs in an **endo** fashion.\n\n*   **Regiochemistry**: The reaction is a normal-electron-demand Diels-Alder. For a diene of the type `CH2=C(X)-CH=C(Y)Z` reacting with an acrylate, the major regioisomer formed is typically the \"para\" adduct, where the C4 of the diene attacks the Cα of the acrylate. However, based on the structures provided (A-H), the reaction follows a \"meta\" pathway where C4 of the diene attacks the Cβ of the acrylate, leading to a product where the `C(Me,OMe)` group is adjacent to the `CH` of the original double bond. All options G and H share this regiochemistry.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry (Endo Rule)**: The endo rule predicts that the substituent on the dienophile (the `-CO2Et` group) is oriented on the same face of the newly formed ring as the \"outside\" substituents of the diene.\n\nLet's analyze the endo addition for each of the two diastereomeric dienes:\n\n1.  **Reaction of the (3Z)-diene**:\n    *   \"Outside\" group at C4: Me\n    *   \"Inside\" group at C4: OMe\n    *   According to the endo rule, the `-CO2Et` group will be *cis* to the \"outside\" Me group. This stereochemical outcome corresponds to **Product G**.\n\n2.  **Reaction of the (3E)-diene**:\n    *   \"Outside\" group at C4: OMe\n    *   \"Inside\" group at C4: Me\n    *   According to the endo rule, the `-CO2Et` group will be *cis* to the \"outside\" OMe group. This stereochemical outcome corresponds to **Product H**.\n\nThus, the two products formed from the endo Diels-Alder reaction are **G** and **H**.\n\n<<<G and H>>>"
