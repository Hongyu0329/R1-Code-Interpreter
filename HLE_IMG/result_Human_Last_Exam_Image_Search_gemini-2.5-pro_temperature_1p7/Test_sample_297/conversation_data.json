    "Based on the visual elements present in the image, the secret word is likely derived from the most prominent and symbolic objects. The artwork features Urotsuki, the protagonist from the surreal indie game fan-project *Yume 2kki*, set against a chaotic, glitch-art background.\n\nA key feature of the image is a cake from the game *Minecraft*. In gaming culture, the appearance of a cake often alludes to the famous phrase \"The cake is a lie\" from the video game *Portal*. Given the collage style of the image, which blends elements from different games and internet aesthetics, this cross-game reference is highly probable.\n\nThe theme of deception fits well with the surreal and often misleading dream worlds of the *Yume Nikki* series. The combination of these elements points towards the secret word being a part of the well-known meme.\n\n<<<LIE>>>"
