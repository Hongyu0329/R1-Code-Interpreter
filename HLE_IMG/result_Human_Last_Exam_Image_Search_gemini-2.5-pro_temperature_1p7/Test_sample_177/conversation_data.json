    "To calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we first need to calculate the total Car VMT for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios.\n\nThe VMT for each distance category is calculated by multiplying the share of total trips for that category, the combined mode share for cars in that category, and the average trip distance. We can assume a total number of trips (e.g., 100) or calculate a weighted average mileage index; the result will be the same.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Baseline Car VMT\n\nFirst, we calculate the total mode share for cars (1 occupant + more than 2 occupants) in each distance category for the Baseline scenario. Then, we calculate the VMT for each category.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share: 25% + 28% = 53%\n    *   VMT Contribution: (48% of total trips) × (53% car share) × 1 mile = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share: 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   VMT Contribution: (22% of total trips) × (81% car share) × 4 miles = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share: 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   VMT Contribution: (14% of total trips) × (85% car share) × 7.5 miles = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share: 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   VMT Contribution: (16% of total trips) × (89% car share) × 20 miles = 2.848\n\n**Total Baseline Car VMT Index =** 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.848 = **4.7077**\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Proposed Car VMT\n\nNext, we repeat the calculation for the Proposed scenario.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share: 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   VMT Contribution: (48% of total trips) × (3% car share) × 1 mile = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share: 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   VMT Contribution: (22% of total trips) × (27% car share) × 4 miles = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share: 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   VMT Contribution: (14% of total trips) × (41% car share) × 7.5 miles = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share: 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   VMT Contribution: (16% of total trips) × (49% car share) × 20 miles = 1.568\n\n**Total Proposed Car VMT Index =** 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.568 = **2.2505**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage reduction using the VMT totals from the Baseline and Proposed scenarios.\n\n*   **VMT Reduction** = Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT) × 100\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100 ≈ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the change in mode share composition results in a **52.2%** reduction in Car VMT.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
