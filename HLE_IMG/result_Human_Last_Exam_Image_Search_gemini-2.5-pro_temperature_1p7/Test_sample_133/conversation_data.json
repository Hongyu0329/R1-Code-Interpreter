    "The mass spectrum presented corresponds to the compound **Methoxychlor**.\n\nHere is the reasoning based on the analysis of the mass spectrum:\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+):** The cluster of peaks at the high mass end of the spectrum around m/z 260-264 is characteristic of a molecule containing multiple chlorine atoms. The pattern of M+, M+2, and M+4 peaks suggests the presence of at least three chlorine atoms, although these peaks are not the molecular ion peaks of the entire molecule.\n*   **Base Peak and Fragmentation:** The base peak (most intense peak) is at **m/z 225**. A prominent fragmentation pattern observed in molecules containing a trichloroethane group, like the pesticide DDT and its analogs, is the loss of this group or parts of it. In many cases, the most stable and abundant fragment ion results from the loss of a radical from the main structure.\n*   **Identification of the Compound:** The spectrum strongly matches that of **Methoxychlor** (a derivative of DDT). The chemical formula for Methoxychlor is C16H15Cl3O2.\n    *   The molecular weight of the most common isotopologue of Methoxychlor is 344 g/mol. This molecular ion is not visible in the provided spectrum, which is common for this class of compounds under electron ionization as they fragment easily.\n    *   The most characteristic and intense fragmentation for Methoxychlor involves the cleavage of the bond between the two aromatic rings and the rest of the molecule, which leads to the formation of the **[CH(C6H4OCH3)2]+** ion. The mass of this ion is 227 u. The peak at m/z 227 (relative intensity 66.7%) and the base peak at m/z 225 (relative intensity 100%) represent this fragment. This suggests a fragmentation that includes the two methoxyphenyl groups. This fragment, [CH(C6H4OCH3)2]+, has a mass of 227, which corresponds to the prominent peak in the spectrum.\n*   **IUPAC Name:** The systematic IUPAC name for Methoxychlor is **1,1'-(2,2,2-Trichloroethane-1,1-diyl)bis(4-methoxybenzene)**.\n\nTherefore, based on the characteristic fragmentation pattern, the compound is identified as Methoxychlor.\n\n<<<1,1'-(2,2,2-Trichloroethane-1,1-diyl)bis(4-methoxybenzene)>>>"
