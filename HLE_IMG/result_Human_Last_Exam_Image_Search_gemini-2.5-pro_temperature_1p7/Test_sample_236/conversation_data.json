    "The animal depicted in the center of the image is the Goldenrod Soldier Beetle. Its scientific name is *Chauliognathus pensylvanicus*.\n\nThis insect is also commonly known as the Pennsylvania leatherwing. It belongs to the soldier beetle family, Cantharidae. These beetles are characterized by their soft, flexible wing covers, which gives them the name \"leatherwings\".\n\nGoldenrod soldier beetles are native to North America and are frequently seen on goldenrod and other late-summer flowers from July to September. They feed on pollen and nectar, but are also beneficial predators, eating aphids and other small, soft-bodied insects. Despite sometimes appearing in large numbers, they are harmless to humans and do not damage the plants they visit.\n\n<<<*Chauliognathus pensylvanicus*>>>"
