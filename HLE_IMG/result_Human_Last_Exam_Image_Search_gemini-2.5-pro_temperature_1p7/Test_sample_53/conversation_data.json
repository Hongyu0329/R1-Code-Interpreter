    "The figure leaving in the chariot is the sorceress Medea.\n\nThis Apulian red-figure pelike (a type of storage jar) depicts the dramatic climax of Euripides' tragedy, *Medea*. The scene portrays Medea making her escape from Corinth after taking vengeance on her unfaithful husband, Jason.\n\nKey elements identifying the scene include:\n*   **Medea:** The figure driving the chariot is Medea. She is shown in \"oriental\" attire, with a patterned sleeve and a Phrygian-style cap, which ancient Greeks used to signify a character from the East. She is fleeing in a chariot sent by her grandfather, the sun god Helios.\n*   **The Victim:** The nude figure on the ground is one of the two sons she murdered as part of her revenge against their father, Jason. The other child is likely the cloaked figure within the chariot.\n*   **The Divine Chariot:** While the mythical creatures pulling the chariot are not fully visible in this specific image, other similar vases show them as dragon-serpents. This supernatural vehicle was a gift from Helios.\n*   **The Context:** South Italian vase painters were greatly influenced by Athenian tragedies, particularly those of Euripides. Vases depicting Medea's violent escape were popular, and this specific composition is attributed to an artist known as the Policoro Painter, dated to around 400 B.C.E. Similar famous portrayals of this scene, like a well-known krater in the Cleveland Museum of Art, confirm this iconography.\n\nThe winged figure above the chariot likely represents a Fury (an avenging spirit) or another supernatural being witnessing the horrific event.\n\n<<<Medea>>>"
