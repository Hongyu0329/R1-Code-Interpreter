    "Based on the provided reaction scheme, the transformation involves two main steps.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe first reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). This reaction attaches the bromoacetyl group to the benzene ring, primarily at the para position due to the directing effect of the butyl group and to minimize steric hindrance. The product is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Imidazole Ring Formation**\n\nThe second step shows the formation of a substituted imidazole ring. The reactant, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one (an α-haloketone), is a classic starting material for the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis. This synthesis involves the condensation of an α-haloketone with a reagent that provides the remaining nitrogen and carbon atoms of the imidazole ring.\n\nThe final product contains a 2-aminoimidazole core structure. To form this specific core from an α-haloketone, the necessary reactant is **guanidine**. Guanidine has the chemical formula H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂ and provides the N-C-N backbone required to close the ring and form the 2-aminoimidazole product.\n\nThe overall reaction is a cyclocondensation where the guanidine molecule reacts with the α-haloketone to form the heterocyclic product, 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole. The final product shown in the image is a derivative of this, specifically tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate, which indicates that in addition to the core reaction with guanidine, a protection step with a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group has occurred. However, the fundamental reactant required to build the 2-aminoimidazole ring system is guanidine.\n\n<<<Guanidine>>>"
