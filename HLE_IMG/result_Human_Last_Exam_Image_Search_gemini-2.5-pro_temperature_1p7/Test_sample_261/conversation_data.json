    "The title of the book that has the presented fragment on the cover is \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\". The image is a cropped portion of the original United States cover art by Mary GrandPré.\n\nThe fragment shows a white unicorn with a golden horn, which is depicted on the left side of the full cover, near the spine. The pillar-like object to the right of the unicorn in the provided image is part of the stone archway that frames the entire cover illustration.\n\nThe American edition of the first Harry Potter book, titled \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\" was first published in 1998 by Scholastic, with cover art created by Mary GrandPré. This cover art is distinct from the original UK edition's cover, which was illustrated by Thomas Taylor and did not feature a unicorn so prominently. Several sources, including articles about the book's various editions and artwork, confirm the presence of the unicorn on the U.S. cover.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
