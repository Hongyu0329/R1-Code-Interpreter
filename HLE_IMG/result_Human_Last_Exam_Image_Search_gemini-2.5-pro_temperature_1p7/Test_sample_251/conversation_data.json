    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip, one must analyze the spacing between the R-waves, which are the highest peaks in the tracing.\n\n**ECG Paper Analysis**\nThe rhythm strip has a standard paper speed of 25 mm/sec, which is noted at the top left of the image. This speed translates the horizontal axis into time:\n*   Each small square (1 mm) represents 0.04 seconds.\n*   Each large square (5 mm) represents 0.2 seconds.\n\n**Measurement of the R-R Interval**\nThe R-R interval is the time elapsed between two consecutive R-waves. A visual inspection of the entire ECG strip is necessary to locate the widest gap between beats. The most significant pauses appear on the fourth and fifth lines of the tracing.\n\nBy closely examining the pause on the fourth line of the strip, which occurs after the timestamp `0:06:08`, we can measure the distance:\n*   The longest interval spans approximately 7 large squares and 4 small squares.\n*   This is equivalent to a total of (7 * 5) + 4 = 39 small squares.\n\n**Calculation**\nTo convert this measurement into seconds, the number of small squares is multiplied by the time value of each square:\n*   39 small squares * 0.04 seconds/small square = 1.56 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the longest R-R interval visible on this rhythm strip is 1.56 seconds.\n\n<<<1.56>>>"
