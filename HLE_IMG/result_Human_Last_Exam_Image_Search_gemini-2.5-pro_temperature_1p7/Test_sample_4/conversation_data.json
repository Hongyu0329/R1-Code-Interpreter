    "The knot depicted in the image is known in knot theory as the Perko pair, which was famously demonstrated to be a single knot by Kenneth Perko in 1974. It is listed in the Rolfsen knot table as 10_161.\n\nThe Jones polynomial, denoted as V(t), for the 10_161 knot is:\n\nt⁻⁹ - t⁻⁸ + 2t⁻⁷ - 2t⁻⁶ + 2t⁻⁵ - 3t⁻⁴ + 3t⁻³ - 2t⁻² + 2t⁻¹ - 1\n\nIn decreasing degree order, as requested for p(t), this is:\n\n-1 + 2t⁻¹ - 2t⁻² + 3t⁻³ - 3t⁻⁴ + 2t⁻⁵ - 2t⁻⁶ + 2t⁻⁷ - t⁻⁸ + t⁻⁹\n\nIt's important to note that the mirror image of this knot would have a Jones polynomial where *t* is substituted with *t*⁻¹, resulting in a different polynomial, which confirms the knot is chiral (not equivalent to its mirror image).\n\n<<<-1 + 2t⁻¹ - 2t⁻² + 3t⁻³ - 3t⁻⁴ + 2t⁻⁵ - 2t⁻⁶ + 2t⁻⁷ - t⁻⁸ + t⁻⁹>>>"
