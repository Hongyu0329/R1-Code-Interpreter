    "This image displays the crystal structure of the human protein **Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)**.\n\nSpecifically, it shows the catalytic domain of SIRT1 (in dark blue) in a complex with a peptide fragment from the tumor suppressor protein **p53** (in light blue). Sirtuins are a class of enzymes known as NAD-dependent deacetylases. In this structure, SIRT1 is positioned to remove an acetyl group from a lysine residue on the p53 peptide, a key interaction for regulating cellular processes like stress response and transcription.\n\nThis particular structural view corresponds to entries in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), such as 2B5I, and is often used to illustrate the interaction between these two important proteins.\n\n<<<Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in complex with a p53 peptide>>>"
