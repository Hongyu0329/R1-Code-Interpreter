    "### Algorithm Analysis\n\nTo determine the time complexity, we first need to establish the recurrence relation for the given `sort(a, n)` function.\n\nThe function is defined as:\n```python\ndef sort(a, n):\n  if n > 1:\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n    if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n      swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n```\n\nLet's denote the time complexity of `sort(a, n)` as T(n).\n\n1.  **Base Case:** If `n <= 1`, the function does nothing, which takes constant time, O(1). So, T(1) = c (where c is a constant).\n2.  **Recursive Step:** If `n > 1`, the function performs the following operations:\n    *   One recursive call: `sort(a, n - 1)`. This takes T(n-1) time.\n    *   One comparison and one potential swap. This takes constant time, O(1).\n    *   A second recursive call: `sort(a, n - 1)`. This also takes T(n-1) time.\n\nBy combining these steps, we can write the recurrence relation for the time complexity:\n\n**T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c** (where c represents the constant time for the comparison and swap)\n\nThis type of recurrence relation is characteristic of algorithms that solve a problem of size `n` by breaking it down into two subproblems of size `n-1`. This is similar to the classic Towers of Hanoi problem.\n\n### Solving the Recurrence Relation\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation by expansion:\n\n*   T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c\n*   T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c\n*   T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c\n*   ... and so on.\n\nAfter `k` expansions, the formula becomes:\nT(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)\n\nThe sum in the parenthesis is a geometric series which equals `2^k - 1`. So:\nT(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^k - 1)\n\nWe continue until we reach the base case, where `n - k = 1`, which means `k = n - 1`. Substituting `k = n - 1`:\nT(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)\n\nSince T(1) is a constant, let's call it `c'`:\nT(n) = 2^(n-1) * c' + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)\nT(n) = c' * 2^(n-1) + c * 2^(n-1) - c\n\nThe dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`. In Big O notation, we ignore constants and lower-order terms. Therefore, the complexity is:\n\n**O(2^n)**\n\nThe algorithm exhibits exponential growth because for each call, it branches into two further calls on a slightly smaller problem size. This creates a recursion tree with a number of nodes that is exponential in `n`. The algorithm does terminate because `n` decreases in each recursive call, eventually reaching the base case.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe worst-case time complexity of the given algorithm is O(2^n). This makes it highly inefficient for all but the smallest input sizes.\n\nThe correct choice is **E**.\n\n<<<E>>>"
