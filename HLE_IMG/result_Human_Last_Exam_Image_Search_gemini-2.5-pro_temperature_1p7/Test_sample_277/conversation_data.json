    "The image provided is completely black, and there are no molecules mentioned or shown. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the relationship between them.\n\nTo help you solve the problem once you have the molecules, here is a definition of the different types of isomers listed:\n\n*   **(a) Conformational isomers (conformers):** These are temporary, different spatial arrangements of the same molecule that can be converted into one another by simply rotating around single bonds. They are not different molecules but different shapes of the same molecule.\n*   **(b) Constitutional isomers:** These molecules share the same molecular formula but have their atoms connected in a different order (different connectivity). For example, butane and isobutane both have the formula C₄H₁₀, but the atoms are linked together differently.\n*   **(c) Identical:** The molecules are exactly the same. They are superimposable on each other, although they may be drawn in different orientations.\n*   **(d) Stereoisomers:** These isomers have the same molecular formula and the same connectivity, but their atoms are arranged differently in three-dimensional space. Unlike conformers, they cannot be interconverted by rotation around single bonds. This category includes enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images) and diastereomers (stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other).\n\nPlease provide the structures of the molecules in question, and I will be able to give you a specific answer."
