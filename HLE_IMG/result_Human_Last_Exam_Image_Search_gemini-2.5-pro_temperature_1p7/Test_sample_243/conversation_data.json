    "The plant in the image is commonly known as the nerve plant or mosaic plant, with the botanical name *Fittonia albivenis*. It is characterized by its striking dark green leaves with intricate, net-like veins that are typically silvery-white, but can also be pink or red.\n\nThis plant is not endemic to an island. It is native to the tropical rainforests of South America, particularly in countries like Peru and Colombia. It grows as a creeping groundcover in the warm, humid, and shaded conditions under the forest canopy. Due to its love for high humidity, it is popularly grown as a houseplant, often in terrariums.\n\n<<<South America>>>"
