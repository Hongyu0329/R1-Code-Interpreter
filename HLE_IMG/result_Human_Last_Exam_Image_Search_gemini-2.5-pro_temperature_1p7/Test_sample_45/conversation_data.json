    "The tiling shown in the image has a **4-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\nThis type of periodic pattern is an example of an Islamic geometric tiling. While the pattern is complex and contains various shapes, its overall repeating symmetry is defined by its wallpaper group. Specifically, this tiling belongs to the **p4m** group.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the symmetries in the pattern:\n*   **4-fold Rotational Symmetry:** The clearest points of rotational symmetry are at the center of the yellow squares. If you rotate the entire pattern by 90 degrees around the center of any of these squares, it will look identical. The p4m group is characterized by these 90° rotation centers.\n*   **Other Symmetries:** The pattern also contains points of 2-fold rotational symmetry. However, it does not possess 3-fold or 6-fold rotational symmetry, even though the dark blue hexagonal tiles might initially suggest it. A close inspection reveals that the arrangement of the tiles surrounding the hexagons is not symmetrical under a 60° or 120° rotation.\n*   **Crystallographic Restriction:** For a repeating, periodic tiling like this, the crystallographic restriction theorem states that the only possible rotational symmetries are 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold. It is impossible for a single periodic pattern to have centers of both 3-fold and 4-fold rotation. Since clear 4-fold rotation centers exist, this must be the highest order of rotational symmetry in the pattern.\n\nTherefore, the defining rotational symmetry of the tiling is 4-fold.\n<<<4-fold>>>"
