    "### Mineral Identification and Silicate Structure Complexity\n\nThe four specimens can be identified based on their visible properties and ordered by the increasing complexity of their silicate structures as follows:\n\n**1. Specimen C: Olivine**\n*   **Identification:** This specimen shows a granular mass of small, olive-green crystals. This appearance is characteristic of the mineral olivine.\n*   **Silicate Structure: Nesosilicate (Isolated Tetrahedra)**. Olivine is a nesosilicate, meaning its structure consists of individual silica tetrahedra (SiO₄) linked by iron and magnesium ions. This is the simplest of the silicate structures.\n\n**2. Specimen A: Pyroxene**\n*   **Identification:** This is a dark green to black, stout, prismatic crystal. This crystal habit is typical of pyroxenes, an important group of rock-forming minerals.\n*   **Silicate Structure: Inosilicate (Single Chain)**. Pyroxenes are single-chain inosilicates, where the silica tetrahedra link together to form long chains by sharing two oxygen atoms each. This structure is more complex than the isolated tetrahedra of nesosilicates.\n\n**3. Specimen B: Mica (likely Chlorite or green mica)**\n*   **Identification:** This mineral is light green and has a flaky, sheet-like appearance, which is the defining characteristic of the mica group of minerals. The green color and pearly luster suggest it could be a species like chlorite.\n*   **Silicate Structure: Phyllosilicate (Sheet Silicate)**. Micas are phyllosilicates, or sheet silicates. In this structure, each tetrahedron shares three of its oxygen atoms with neighboring tetrahedra, forming continuous sheets. This represents a higher degree of polymerization than single chains.\n\n**4. Specimen D: Quartz**\n*   **Identification:** This is a translucent, six-sided (hexagonal) crystal, which is the classic form of quartz.\n*   **Silicate Structure: Tectosilicate (Framework Silicate)**. Quartz is a tectosilicate, or framework silicate. In this highly complex structure, every silica tetrahedron shares all four of its oxygen atoms with adjacent tetrahedra, creating a strong, three-dimensional framework. This is the most polymerized and complex of the silicate structures.\n\n### Final Order\n\nThe correct order of the specimens from the least complex to the most complex silicate structure is:\n\n**C → A → B → D**\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
