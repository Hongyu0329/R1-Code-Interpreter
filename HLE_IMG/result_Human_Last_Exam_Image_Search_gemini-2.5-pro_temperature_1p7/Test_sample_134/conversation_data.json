    "Based on the visual representation, the molecule shown is **Cyclocarbon**.\n\nCyclocarbon is an allotrope of carbon with the chemical formula C₁₈. It consists of a ring of 18 carbon atoms connected by alternating single and triple bonds, making it a cyclocarbon and a polyyne.\n\nThis specific allotrope of carbon was a subject of theoretical interest for many years before it was first synthesized and imaged in 2019 by a team of scientists from IBM and the University of Oxford. They generated the molecule by using atomic manipulation to remove carbon monoxide from a larger cyclocarbon oxide precursor (C₂₄O₆).\n\nHigh-resolution atomic force microscopy confirmed that the structure has alternating triple and single bonds, which suggests that cyclocarbon may have semiconducting properties. It is considered the smallest cyclo[n]carbon that is predicted to be relatively stable.\n\n<<<Cyclocarbon>>>"
