    "The provided sheet music is from \"Tifa's Theme\" from the video game Final Fantasy VII. The music was originally composed by Nobuo Uematsu and this piano arrangement is part of the \"Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII\".\n\nHere are some of the identifying musical elements:\n\n*   **Key Signature:** The piece is in C# minor, indicated by the four sharps (F#, C#, G#, D#) in the key signature.\n*   **Melody and Rhythm:** The opening melodic phrase in the right hand (G#, F#, E, D#, C#) is a very recognizable part of the theme.\n*   **Style:** The piece exhibits dramatic shifts in dynamics, from a soft and introspective beginning to louder, more powerful sections, which is characteristic of the arrangements found in the Final Fantasy Piano Collections.\n\nThe combination of the specific notes, the key of C# minor, and the overall musical style strongly points to this well-known piece from the Final Fantasy series.\n\n<<<\"Tifa's Theme\" from Final Fantasy VII>>>"
