    "Yes, there is an animal in this image. It is the fossil of an extinct jawless fish, and its scientific name is most likely ***Pteraspis***.\n\nThe distinctive honeycomb-like, or tessellated, pattern visible in the photograph is characteristic of the armored plating that covered the head and front part of the body of fish in the class Pteraspidomorphi. The genus *Pteraspis* belongs to this class and is known for its large, bony head-shield which is often what is preserved in the fossil record. These ancient fish lived during the Devonian period, approximately 398 to 416 million years ago.\n\nFossils of *Pteraspis* have been discovered in Europe, including Great Britain and Belgium, as well as North America. They were relatively small, growing to about 20 centimeters in length, and are thought to have been active swimmers. The bony armor provided protection from predators.\n\nWhile a modern fish, the Honeycomb Cowfish (*Acanthostracion polygonius*), has a similar surface pattern, the appearance of the object in the image, including its texture and the surrounding rock matrix, is consistent with that of a fossil rather than a living organism.\n\n<<<*Pteraspis*>>>"
