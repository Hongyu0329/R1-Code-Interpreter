    "Based on a harmonic analysis of the provided sheet music, the circled measure, which is measure 29, contains the notes G, B-natural, D, and F. In the sonata's home key of C minor, this chord is the dominant seventh.\n\nThe Roman numeral for a dominant seventh chord is **V7**. The 'V' indicates a chord built on the fifth degree of the scale (G in the key of C minor), and the '7' denotes that it is a seventh chord. The B-natural is a result of raising the leading tone, a common practice for dominant chords in minor keys.\n\n<<<V7>>>"
