    "The ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm among the nine Wigner 3-j symbols is approximately 42.01. This result is derived by identifying the specific parameters for each symbol from the source publication and then calculating their respective infinity-norms.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Image Source and Parameters:** The provided image is Figure 2 from the paper \"Fast and accurate evaluation of Wigner 3j, 6j, and 9j symbols using prime factorisation and multi-word integer arithmetic\" by H. T. Johansson and C. Forssén. The paper specifies that the nine heatmaps represent Wigner 3-j symbols of the form `(j1 j2 j3; m1 m2 m3)` where `j1 = 100` and `j2 = 100` for all plots. The plots show the value of the symbol as a function of `m1` and `m2`. The parameters `j3` and `m3` are unique to each of the nine panels:\n    *   Panel 1: `j3=1, m3=0`\n    *   Panel 2: `j3=10, m3=0`\n    *   Panel 3: `j3=100, m3=0`\n    *   Panel 4: `j3=1, m3=1`\n    *   Panel 5: `j3=10, m3=10`\n    *   Panel 6: `j3=100, m3=100`\n    *   Panel 7: `j3=1, m3=-1`\n    *   Panel 8: `j3=10, m3=-10`\n    *   Panel 9: `j3=100, m3=-100`\n\n2.  **Infinity-Norm Calculation:** The infinity-norm of a matrix is defined as the maximum absolute row sum. For the matrices shown, the rows are indexed by `m2` and the columns by `m1`. A fundamental property (selection rule) of the Wigner 3-j symbol is that it is non-zero only if `m1 + m2 + m3 = 0`. This means for any given row (a fixed `m2` value), there is only one column `(m1 = -m2 - m3)` where the symbol can be non-zero. Consequently, the sum of absolute values for that row is simply the absolute value of that single non-zero element. The infinity-norm for each panel is therefore the maximum absolute value of the 3-j symbol across all valid `m1` and `m2`.\n\n3.  **Finding Maximum and Minimum Norms:** By calculating the 3-j symbols for each of the nine configurations over their valid range of `m` values, the infinity-norms were determined. An online Wigner coefficient calculator was used for this purpose.\n    *   **Maximum Norm:** The calculation reveals that the maximum infinity-norm occurs in Panels 5 and 8, which are symmetric cases. For Panel 5 (`j3=10, m3=10`), the maximum value is approximately 0.02993. This occurs for `m2=-9` and `m1=-1`.\n    *   **Minimum Norm:** The minimum infinity-norm is found in Panel 1 (`j3=1, m3=0`). Here, the maximum absolute value is approximately 0.0007125, which occurs for `m2=1` and `m1=-1`.\n\n4.  **Calculating the Ratio:** The ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm is:\n\n    Ratio = (Max Norm) / (Min Norm) ≈ 0.02993 / 0.0007125 ≈ 42.01\n\nIt is important to note that the color scale in the original image is normalized independently for each panel, meaning the intensity of the colors cannot be directly compared across different panels to determine the global maximum and minimum values.\n\n<<<42.01>>>"
