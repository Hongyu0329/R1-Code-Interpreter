    "The medallion in question is a Sasanian silver-gilt plate, a prime example of metalwork from the Sasanian Empire. Based on its artistic style and iconography, archaeologists and art historians attribute this type of artifact to the Sasanian period, specifically from the 3rd to the 7th century A.D.\n\nSasanian silver vessels, including plates and bowls with medallion portraits, were significant items, often used for royal display or as diplomatic gifts. The style of depicting royalty, such as the busts of kings or other members of the royal family within medallions, was particularly common in the earlier part of the Sasanian period, around the 3rd and 4th centuries A.D. After the late 4th century, the typical representation of kings on silver vessels shifted to hunting or enthronement scenes.\n\nThe artwork of the Sasanian Empire, which flourished from 224 to 651 A.D., is renowned for its exquisite metalwork. Silver-gilt plates, like the one pictured, often featured royal imagery symbolizing the power and prowess of the Sasanian rulers. The specific design of a king and queen on a throne, possibly depicting a wedding, is attributed to the 6th-7th century. The craftsmanship and materials, typically silver with mercury gilding and niello inlay, were characteristic of the era. These artifacts provide valuable insights into the culture, history, and art of the Sasanian dynasty.\n\nConsidering the various styles within the Sasanian period, medallions featuring bust portraits are generally dated to the earlier centuries, while those with scenes like royal hunts or enthroned couples are often placed in the later period. The general consensus for Sasanian medallions and plates of this nature spans from the 3rd to the 7th century A.D. Therefore, the medallion is ascribed to a period between the 3rd and 7th century A.D.\n\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
