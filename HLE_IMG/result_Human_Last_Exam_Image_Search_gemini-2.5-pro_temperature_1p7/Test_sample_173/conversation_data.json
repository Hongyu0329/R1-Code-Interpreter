    "To determine the time signature of the musical measure provided, one must count the total value of the notes within the measure. A time signature consists of two numbers; the top number indicates how many beats are in a measure, while the bottom number shows what type of note gets one beat.\n\nIn the provided image:\n*   **Treble Clef (Top Staff):** The notes are grouped into four sets of four sixteenth notes each. A sixteenth note gets one-quarter of a beat in time signatures with a 4 on the bottom (like 2/4, 3/4, and 4/4). Since there are sixteen total sixteenth notes, their combined value is equivalent to four quarter notes (16 sixteenth notes รท 4 sixteenth notes per quarter note = 4 quarter notes).\n*   **Bass Clef (Bottom Staff):** There are four distinct notes, each being a quarter note. A quarter note typically receives one beat. The presence of four quarter notes clearly indicates a total of four beats in the measure.\n\nBoth staves confirm that the measure contains a total rhythmic value equivalent to four quarter notes. Therefore, the time signature is 4/4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
