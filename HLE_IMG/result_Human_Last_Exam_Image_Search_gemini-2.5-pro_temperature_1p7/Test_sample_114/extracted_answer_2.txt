The reason for the high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is the rigid, cyclic structure of the N-acetylproline starting material. This structure prevents the formation of a symmetrical intermediate that is responsible for the loss of regioselectivity observed in Reactions 1 and 2.

Here is a detailed explanation:

**Mechanism and the Role of the Symmetrical Intermediate**

The reactions shown are examples of Huisgen [3+2] dipolar cycloadditions. Acetic anhydride converts the N-acyl amino acid into a reactive mesoionic intermediate called a **Münchnone**. This Münchnone (the 1,3-dipole) then reacts with methyl propiolate (the dipolarophile). Following the cycloaddition, the initial adduct loses a molecule of carbon dioxide (CO₂) to form the final pyrrole product.

*   **Reaction 1 and 2 (Acyclic System):** The starting material is N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine, which is acyclic and conformationally flexible. The results from the ¹³C labeling experiment in Reaction 2 are critical. They show that the label, whether on the acetyl-methyl (`*CH₃-CO-`) or the alanine-alpha-methyl (`-CH(*CH₃)-`), ends up scrambled in a 1:1 ratio between the C2 and C5 positions of Product A. This scrambling proves that these two methyl groups become chemically equivalent at some point during the reaction. This can only happen through the formation of a **symmetrical intermediate** before the cycloaddition occurs. The flexibility of the acyclic starting material allows it to access this intermediate, which then decomposes to the Münchnone with its regiochemistry scrambled.

*   **Reaction 3 (Cyclic System):** The starting material is N-acetylproline. In this molecule, the nitrogen atom and the alpha-carbon are both part of a rigid five-membered ring. This covalent, cyclic constraint makes it **structurally impossible** for the molecule to rearrange and form the symmetrical intermediate that is seen in the acyclic case.

**Contribution of Reactions 1 and 2 to the Rationale**

The results from Reactions 1 and 2 provide the essential mechanistic insight. They demonstrate that for flexible N-acyl-N-alkyl amino acids, there is a pathway that funnels through a symmetrical intermediate, leading to a loss of regioselectivity.

By establishing this baseline behavior, the outcome of Reaction 3 becomes clear. The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is not an anomaly but is the expected result when the scrambling pathway is blocked. The rigidity of the proline ring is the key structural feature that blocks this pathway, forcing the reaction to proceed through a single, well-defined Münchnone intermediate. This intermediate then reacts with high regioselectivity, yielding only Product B.

In summary, Reactions 1 and 2 reveal a hidden, non-selective mechanistic pathway available to flexible substrates. Reaction 3 demonstrates that locking the substrate into a rigid cyclic conformation effectively shuts down this non-selective pathway, restoring the inherent high regioselectivity of the Münchnone cycloaddition reaction.
