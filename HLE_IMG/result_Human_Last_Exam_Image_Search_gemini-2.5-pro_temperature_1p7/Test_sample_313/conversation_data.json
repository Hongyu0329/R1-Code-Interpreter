    "The problem presented is a riddle that connects two seemingly unrelated facts by a single two-word name, \"X Y\".\n\n**The First Clue: The Image**\n\nThe photograph shows an awards ceremony. The man receiving the award is professional ice hockey player Nikita Kucherov. While the prompt mentions the date June 20, 2019, the event pictured is the NHL Awards, which took place on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas. That night, Kucherov, who played for the Tampa Bay Lightning, won multiple awards, including the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player and the Art Ross Trophy for leading the league in points.\n\n**The Second Clue: Mercury Toxicity**\n\nThe second clue states that \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This points to an industrial or chemical process involving a mercury compound that has been largely discontinued because of health risks. While processes like the use of mercury in felt hat making are well-known, another relevant application is in the treatment of mercury-containing waste. One such method involves reacting mercury with sulfur to form the more stable and less toxic mercury sulfide. This stabilization/solidification process can be performed in equipment like a Ross Vertical Cone Mixer. Additionally, companies like Ross Engineering offer ion-exchange systems for removing heavy metals, including mercury, from water. Fisher Scientific also lists a \"Ross Healthcare Mercon Mercury Spill Control Kit,\" indicating a connection between the name \"Ross\" and mercury-related processes or products.\n\n**The Solution**\n\nThe common term linking the hockey award and the mercury-related process is **Art Ross**. Nikita Kucherov won the Art Ross Trophy in 2019. The name \"Ross\" is also associated with equipment and methods used in processes that handle or treat mercury.\n\n<<<Art Ross>>>"
