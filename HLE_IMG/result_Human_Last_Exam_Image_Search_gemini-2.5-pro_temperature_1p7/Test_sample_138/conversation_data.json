    "Here is the determination of the biological sexes for each pair of insects:\n\n**Pair A:** The insect on the left belongs to the cuckoo bee genus *Coelioxys*. The abdomen, which tapers to a multi-spined or pronged tip, is characteristic of a male of this genus. The insect on the right is a robust cuckoo bee, likely from the genus *Triepeolus*. In many bee species, females are more robust than males, and in this genus, females lack the specialized pollen-collecting hairs (scopae) on their legs.\n*   **Conclusion for A: Male, Female (3)**\n\n**Pair B:** These are paper wasps of the genus *Polistes*. A reliable way to distinguish the sexes in many *Polistes* species is by their antennae. The wasp on the right has antennae with distinctly curled or hooked tips, which is a definitive trait of a male. The wasp on the left has straighter antennae, indicating it is a female.\n*   **Conclusion for B: Female, Male (4)**\n\n**Pair C:** These hairy bees belong to the long-horned bee tribe (Eucerini), likely the genus *Melissodes*. Males in this group are distinguished by very long antennae and often have a pale yellow or white patch on their face (clypeus). The bee on the left clearly shows this pale facial hair. Both bees lack scopae (dense pollen-collecting hairs on the legs), which is a key trait of male bees, as they do not collect pollen for offspring. Since both individuals exhibit male characteristics and lack the female's specialized pollen-carrying structures, they are both identified as males.\n*   **Conclusion for C: Male, Male (1)**\n\n3, 4, 1<<<3, 4, 1>>>"
