    "Based on the image provided and common dental classification systems, the lesion corresponds to a G.V. Black Class I.\n\nThe image displays a molar with a visible carious lesion on its occlusal (chewing) surface, specifically in the pits and fissures surrounding an existing restoration. This type of decay, occurring around a pre-existing filling, is known as secondary or recurrent caries.\n\nAccording to G.V. Black's classification system, which categorizes caries based on their location on the tooth, lesions found in the pits and fissures of the occlusal surfaces of posterior teeth (molars and premolars) are defined as Class I. Even though this lesion is recurrent, its location dictates its classification.\n\n<<<Class I>>>"
