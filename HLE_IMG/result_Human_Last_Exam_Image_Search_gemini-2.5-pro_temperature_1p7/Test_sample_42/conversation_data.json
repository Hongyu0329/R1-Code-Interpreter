    "This is a fresco of Saint Simeon Stylites.\n\nThe image is a well-known fresco from the Visoki Dečani Monastery in Kosovo, a major Serbian Orthodox monastery built in the mid-14th century. The monastery's interior is covered with one of the largest preserved collections of Byzantine-style frescoes.\n\nArt historical sources and museum databases identify this specific fresco as a depiction of Saint Simeon Stylites. Saint Simeon was a Syrian monk from the 4th-5th century known for living as a hermit on top of a pillar for 37 years, which earned him the name \"Stylites\" (from the Greek *stylos*, meaning pillar). While he is often depicted on a pillar, standing portraits showing him as an elderly ascetic with a long beard and holding a scroll also exist. The collection of frescoes at the Dečani Monastery includes multiple depictions of stylite saints.\n\n<<<F>>>"
