    "The circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, form an E major chord.\n\nTo determine the correct Roman numeral, we must analyze the chord in the context of the piece's key, which is D minor.\n\n1.  **Identify the notes:** The notes circled in measure 8 are E in the left hand and G-sharp and B in the right hand. Together, these three notes (E, G#, B) create an E major triad.\n2.  **Determine the chord's function:** In the key of D minor, the tonic is D. The note E is the second scale degree, or supertonic. The diatonic chord built on the supertonic in D minor would be E diminished (E-G-Bb).\n3.  **Analyze the altered chord:** The chord present is E major, not E diminished. The G is raised to a G-sharp. An E major chord is the dominant (V) chord of A major. The A major chord is the dominant (V) of D minor. Therefore, the E major chord functions as the \"dominant of the dominant,\" preparing the listener for the A major chord that follows in measure 9. This is a common chromatic harmony known as a secondary dominant.\n4.  **Assign the Roman numeral:** The Roman numeral for a secondary dominant is written as V of V (V/V).\n\nThe correct Roman numeral is V/V, representing a secondary dominant chord that leads to the dominant of the home key.\n\n<<<V/V>>>"
