    "The author of the detail from the altarpiece is the Italian Renaissance sculptor **Andrea della Robbia**.\n\nThe image provided is a detail from the predella, or the lower part, of the \"Altar of the Sacrament,\" also known as the \"Tabernacle of the Eucharist.\" This significant work of art, created around 1512, is made of glazed terracotta, a medium for which the Della Robbia family workshop was renowned.\n\nThe altarpiece is located in the Church of Santi Apostoli in Florence, Italy. It was a commission for which Andrea della Robbia may have collaborated with his son, Giovanni. The specific detail in the image shows a scene of communion, fitting the altarpiece's theme of the Eucharist. The inscription at the bottom of the roundel, \"SACRAMENT DE L'AUTEL,\" translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" further confirming its identity. A restoration of this masterpiece was completed under the sponsorship of the Friends of Florence Foundation.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
