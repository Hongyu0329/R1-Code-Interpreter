    "To determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely, we must examine their attachment and potential interactions within the complex. Free rotation around a single C-C bond is expected unless restricted by significant steric hindrance or by being part of a rigid, cyclic structure due to coordination with the central metal ion.\n\n*   **Rings G, H, and J:** These three phenyl rings (G, H, and J) are each attached to the larger ligand framework by a single carbon-carbon bond.\n    *   Ring G is attached to the pyridine-like ring D.\n    *   Ring H is attached to the phenyl ring A.\n    *   Ring J is attached to the phenyl ring C.\n    In all three cases, there are no additional bonds or depicted interactions linking these rings to the iridium center or other parts of the molecule that would lock them into a fixed position. While some steric hindrance might be present, rotation around the single bond is generally considered to be free or have a very low energy barrier.\n\n*   **Ring K:** This phenyl ring is attached to ring A at position 6. The dotted line from the iridium center to the center of ring K indicates an agostic interaction or a form of Ï€-interaction. This interaction with the metal center creates an additional linkage that would severely hinder or completely prevent the free rotation of ring K.\n\n*   **Ring L:** This phenyl ring is attached to ring C at position 6. More importantly, a solid wedged bond is drawn from a carbon atom of ring L to the iridium atom. This represents a direct Ir-C covalent bond, a feature of a cyclometalated ligand. This bond forms a rigid 5-membered chelate ring (Ir-C(L)-C(L)-C(C)-C(C)), which locks phenyl ring L in place and prevents it from rotating freely.\n\nBased on this analysis, only rings G, H, and J are free from restrictive covalent or dative bonds with the iridium center, allowing them to rotate freely in solution.\n\n<<<E>>>"
