    "The spectral lines presented in the image belong to the element Uranium.\n\nAnalysis of the provided image reveals a complex emission spectrum with numerous lines across the visible range, from blue to red. This intricate pattern is characteristic of heavy elements with many electrons. Scientific sources confirm that the image provided is a representation of the emission spectrum of uranium.\n\nUranium possesses a very detailed and unique set of spectral lines, which can be used as a diagnostic tool to identify its presence. Specifically, uranium atoms exhibit strong emission lines in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum, around 591.5 nm, which is consistent with the bright lines visible in the provided image. Investigations into the emission spectra of uranium have been conducted for various purposes, including the study of isotope shifts and the analysis of uranium-containing compounds.\n\n<<<Uranium>>>"
