The four-terminal conductance $G_{12,34}$ is given by the expression:
$G_{12,34} = \frac{M(M-N)}{N} \frac{e^2}{h}$
Where:
*   `M` is the total number of spin-degenerate edge states.
*   `N` is the number of edge states reflected (tunneled) across the quantum point contact.
*   `e` is the elementary charge.
*   `h` is Planck's constant.
$\frac{e^2}{h}$ is the quantum of conductance.
