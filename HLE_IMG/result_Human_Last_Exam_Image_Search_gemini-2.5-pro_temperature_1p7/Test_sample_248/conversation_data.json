    "The organisms in the image definitively place it on the Atlantic Coast. The key indicator is the common periwinkle, identified by its robust, dark, and sometimes banded shell.\n\nThe scientific name of this species is *Littorina littorea*. This marine snail is native to the northeastern coasts of the Atlantic Ocean and was introduced to North America in the mid-19th century. Its current range in North America extends along the Atlantic coast from Labrador, Canada, down to New Jersey in the United States. It is now considered the most common marine snail along the North Atlantic coast.\n\nWhile there have been sporadic introductions of *Littorina littorea* to the Pacific coast, it has not established sustained populations there. Its abundant presence, as seen in the photograph alongside other typical rocky shore organisms like barnacles and dog whelks, is characteristic of the North Atlantic intertidal zone.\n\n<<<*Littorina littorea*>>>"
