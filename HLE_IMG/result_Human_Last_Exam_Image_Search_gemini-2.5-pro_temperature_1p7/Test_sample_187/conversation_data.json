    "<<<The reaction involves two pericyclic reactions: a **1,3-dipolar cycloaddition** and a **cheletropic extrusion**. The stoichiometric byproduct is **carbon dioxide (CO₂)**.\n\n**Mechanism Explanation:**\n\n1.  **1,3-Dipolar Cycloaddition:** The starting material, a mesoionic compound known as a münchnone, acts as a 1,3-dipole. It undergoes a [3+2] cycloaddition reaction with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD), which serves as the dipolarophile. This concerted, pericyclic reaction forms a bicyclic adduct.\n\n2.  **Cheletropic Extrusion:** The bicyclic adduct formed in the first step is unstable and readily undergoes a cycloreversion reaction. This second pericyclic step is a cheletropic extrusion where a stable molecule, carbon dioxide (CO₂), is eliminated to generate an aromatic pyrrole as the final product. The release of the gaseous CO₂ provides a strong thermodynamic driving force for the reaction sequence."
