    "The phenomenon depicted in the image and described in the prompt is known as the **auditory continuity illusion** or **perceptual restoration of sound**.\n\nThis auditory illusion occurs when a sound, such as a pure tone, is interrupted by a brief period of noise. If the noise is loud enough and spectrally appropriate to mask the interruption, the brain perceptually \"fills in\" the missing part of the tone, creating the experience of a continuous, uninterrupted sound. This effect demonstrates the brain's tendency to maintain the continuity of sounds, even when the auditory information is incomplete.\n\nThe illusion is not limited to simple tones; it can also occur with more complex sounds like speech and music. For instance, if a phoneme in a spoken sentence is replaced by a cough or burst of static, listeners often report hearing the entire word, including the missing sound. This specific application is often called the **phonemic restoration effect**.\n\nThe strength of the illusion depends on factors like the loudness and duration of the interrupting noise. A loud, short burst of noise creates a more convincing illusion. This perceptual ability is fundamental to our capacity to understand speech and follow conversations in noisy environments, where parts of the signal we want to hear are often obscured by other sounds. Research suggests that specific areas of the brain, including the auditory cortex, are responsible for \"repairing\" the lost sound based on context and past experience.\n\n<<<auditory continuity illusion>>>"
