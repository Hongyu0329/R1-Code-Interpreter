**Part 1: The Key of the Modulation**

In measure 11, the presence of a G dominant 7th chord (G-B-D-F) signals a modulation to the key of **C major**. This is confirmed at the beginning of measure 12 with the arrival of a C major chord, which acts as the tonic, resolving the tension created by the G7 chord in the previous measure.

**Part 2: Justification of the Modulation**

The sonata's home key is C-sharp minor. The initial, more conventional modulation in the preceding measures (mm. 9-10) is to E major, the relative major of C-sharp minor, which is a closely related and expected key change.

The subsequent shift to C major is a much more remote and harmonically surprising modulation. This can be justified in several ways:
*   **Beethoven's Style:** This type of dramatic and unexpected harmonic shift is a hallmark of Beethoven's innovative and boundary-pushing compositional style. He was known for expanding the harmonic language of the Classical period, and this movement, subtitled *Sonata quasi una fantasia* ("Sonata in the manner of a fantasy"), has a particularly wandering and improvisatory character.
*   **Smooth Voice Leading:** Despite being a distant key, Beethoven connects it seamlessly through a descending bass line that moves chromatically from E (measure 10) down to D (measure 11), C (measure 12), and B (measure 13). This smooth voice leading helps to justify the otherwise abrupt key change.
*   **Dramatic Effect:** The move to the remote key of C major creates a striking and colorful effect, adding to the somber and contemplative mood of the movement.

**Part 3: Roman Numeral Analysis**

The most complete and functionally accurate Roman numeral marking for the chord on the first beat of measure 11 (the G7 chord) is analyzed within the context of the key it is preparing. Since the chord leads directly to C major, it is the dominant of C.

Therefore, the Roman numeral is: **V7 in the key of C major.**

When analyzed in the context of the preceding key of E major, this chord would be labeled as a secondary dominant, specifically the dominant of the flat-VI chord (**V7/bVI**), highlighting its role as a pivot to a remote tonal center.
