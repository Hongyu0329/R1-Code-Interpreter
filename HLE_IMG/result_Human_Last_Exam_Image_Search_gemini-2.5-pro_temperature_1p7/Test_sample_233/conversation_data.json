    "Based on the distinct grid pattern of the runic inscription, the runestone depicted in the image is the **Gripsholm Runestone**, which has the identifier **Sö 179**.\n\nThis famous Ingvar runestone is located at Gripsholm Castle in Mariefred, Södermanland, Sweden. It was raised by a woman named Tóla in memory of her son Harald, who was the brother of the well-known Viking leader Ingvar the Far-Travelled. The inscription states that they traveled east for gold and died in the south in \"Serkland\" (the land of the Saracens).\n\nThe inscription reads: \"Tóla had this stone raised in memory of her son Haraldr, Ingvarr's brother. They travelled valiantly far for gold, and in the east gave (food) to the eagle. (They) died in the south in Serkland.\" The phrase \"gave food to the eagle\" is a kenning, or poetic metaphor, for killing enemies in battle.\n\nDiscovered in the 1820s, the stone was being used as a threshold in the cellar of the castle tower. It was not retrieved and fully deciphered for another 100 years. The Gripsholm Runestone is one of approximately 26 Ingvar runestones, which commemorate those who perished in Ingvar's ill-fated expedition to the Caspian Sea between 1036 and 1041.\n\n<<<Sö 179>>>"
