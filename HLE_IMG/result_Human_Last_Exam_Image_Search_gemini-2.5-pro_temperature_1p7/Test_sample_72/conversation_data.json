    "The transformation shown involves two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions. Based on the reactants and the final product, the following two-step reaction sequence is proposed:\n\n1.  **Electrocyclic Ring Opening:** The first step is the photochemical ring-opening of cyclobutene. This is an electrocyclic reaction involving a 4π-electron system. Under the influence of light (hv), cyclobutene undergoes a conrotatory ring-opening to form 1,3-butadiene. This process transforms the strained four-membered ring into a conjugated diene, which is then available to participate in the second reaction.\n\n2.  **[4+2] Cycloaddition (Diels-Alder Reaction):** In the second step, the 1,3-butadiene formed reacts with hexafluorobenzene. In this reaction, 1,3-butadiene acts as the 4π component (the diene) and one of the double bonds of hexafluorobenzene acts as the 2π component (the dienophile). This [4+2] cycloaddition, which is photochemically allowed, results in the formation of the final product, a bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene derivative.\n\nIn summary, the two pericyclic reactions are:\n*   An **electrocyclic reaction**\n*   A **[4+2] cycloaddition**\n\n<<<An electrocyclic reaction and a [4+2] cycloaddition>>>"
