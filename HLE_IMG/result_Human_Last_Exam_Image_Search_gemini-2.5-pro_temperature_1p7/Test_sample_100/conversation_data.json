    "To determine the molecular formula of the final product, we must analyze the sequence of reactions step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and First Reaction\n\nThe starting material is a complex bicyclic molecule. The first reaction involves Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in aqueous acetonitrile (ACN/H2O). CAN is a well-known oxidizing agent commonly used for the deprotection of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) groups from nitrogen atoms, including those in amides and lactams. This reaction cleaves the bond between the nitrogen and the PMB group, replacing the PMB with a hydrogen atom.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The molecule contains a bicyclic core, a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group, and a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group attached to a nitrogen. Based on the subsequent reactions, the most chemically plausible structure is a derivative of 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one, commonly known as a Vince lactam. The PMB group (C8H9O) is attached to the nitrogen (N), and the CF3 group is on the double bond. The molecular formula of the starting material is C15H14F3NO2.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** After the reaction with CAN, the PMB group is removed, and a hydrogen atom is attached to the nitrogen. This results in the formation of 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    *   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 1:** Subtracting the atoms of the PMB group (C8H8O) and adding a hydrogen to the nitrogen from the starting material (C15H14F3NO2) gives the formula **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Second Reaction\n\nThe second step is the reaction of Intermediate 1 with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2) in methanol (MeOH). This is a standard catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the bicyclic ring to a single bond (C-C).\n\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The hydrogenation of Intermediate 1 adds two hydrogen atoms across the double bond. The resulting structure is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n    *   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 2:** Adding two hydrogen atoms to Intermediate 1 (C7H6F3NO) gives the formula **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Third Reaction and Determine the Final Product\n\nThe final step is the reaction of Intermediate 2 with 4 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 70 Â°C. These are harsh acidic hydrolysis conditions. Intermediate 2 is a bicyclic lactam (a cyclic amide), and strong acid with heat will hydrolyze the amide bond.\n\n*   **Product:** The hydrolysis of the lactam involves the addition of one molecule of water (H2O) across the amide C-N bond, which opens the ring. This results in a molecule that is both a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an amine (-NH2). Under the acidic conditions, the amine will be protonated to an ammonium salt (-NH3+). The final product is a substituted cyclopentane amino acid.\n    *   **Molecular Formula of Product:** Adding one molecule of water (H2O) to Intermediate 2 (C7H8F3NO) yields the final molecular formula.\n        *   Carbons: 7\n        *   Hydrogens: 8 + 2 = 10\n        *   Fluorines: 3\n        *   Nitrogens: 1\n        *   Oxygens: 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   The final molecular formula is **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
