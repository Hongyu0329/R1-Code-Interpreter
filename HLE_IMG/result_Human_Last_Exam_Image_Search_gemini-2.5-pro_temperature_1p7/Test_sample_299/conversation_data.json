    "Here is the step-by-step solution for the two-move checkmate:\n\n**Move 1: White moves Knight from e7 to f5 (Ne7-f5+).**\n\nThis move puts the Black King on e4 in check. The Black King has no safe squares to move to:\n*   d3, e3, and f3 are all attacked by the White Rook on f3.\n*   d4 is attacked by the White Queen on a4.\n*   d5 and f5 are attacked by the White Rook on h5 (f5 is also attacked by the checking Knight).\n*   e5 and f4 are occupied by Black's own pawns.\n\nSince the King cannot move, Black's only legal option is to capture the checking piece.\n\n**Move 1 (Black's only response): Queen from d5 captures Knight on f5 (Qxf5).**\n\nThe Black Queen takes the White Knight on f5. The King on e4 is no longer in check.\n\n**Move 2: White moves Rook from h5 to capture the Queen on f5 (Rh5xf5#).**\n\nThis is checkmate. The Black King on e4 is now checked by the Rook on f5.\n*   The King still has no escape squares (as analyzed in the first move).\n*   The checking Rook cannot be captured.\n*   The check cannot be blocked.\n\nTherefore, the two-move sequence for checkmate is:\n1.  **Ne7-f5+**   Qxf5\n2.  **Rxf5#**\n\n<<<1. Ne7-f5+ Qxf5 2. Rxf5#>>>"
