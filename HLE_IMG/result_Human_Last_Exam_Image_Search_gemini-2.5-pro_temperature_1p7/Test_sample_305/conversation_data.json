    "The product is a depilatory cream called Veet.\n\nThe incomplete advertisement in the image was part of a campaign in Britain during World War II, a time when women were entering traditionally male-dominated factory jobs in large numbers to support the war effort. The campaign for Veet, a hair removal cream, suggested that while women were doing \"a man's work,\" they needed to maintain their \"feminine charm\" in their off-duty hours.\n\nThe advertising framed body hair, a natural feature, as a social \"limitation\" and an embarrassing issue that detracted from a woman's attractiveness. This messaging was particularly targeted at women who, due to wartime shortages of materials like nylon for stockings, were more likely to have bare legs.\n\nThe name \"Veet\" is derived from the French word \"vite,\" which means \"quickly.\"\n\n<<<Veet>>>"
