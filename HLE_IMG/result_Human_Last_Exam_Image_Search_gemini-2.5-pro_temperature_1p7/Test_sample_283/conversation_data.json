    "Based on the recurring annual peaks in the Google Trends data, the country in question is the United States. A historian would recognize the pattern of public interest in three major American historical commemorations.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the events corresponding to the colored lines on the graph:\n\n*   **The Red Line (peaks in early December):** This represents **Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day**. Annually observed on December 7, it marks the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. Each year, on this date, there are ceremonies and a significant increase in public remembrance and online searches.\n\n*   **The Yellow Line (peaks in mid-to-late January):** This corresponds to **Martin Luther King Jr. Day**. This U.S. federal holiday is observed on the third Monday of January to honor the civil rights leader. The day is marked by speeches, parades, and designated as a national day of service, driving public attention and searches.\n\n*   **The Blue Line (peaks in late May):** This indicates **Memorial Day**. A major federal holiday in the United States, it is observed on the last Monday of May to honor military personnel who have died while serving. This day marks the unofficial start of summer and is commemorated with parades and visits to cemeteries and memorials, leading to a predictable surge in interest.\n\nThe consistent, sharp increases in search traffic for these topics on their respective anniversaries each year, as depicted in the graph, point clearly to historical events that are significant and widely observed in the United States.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
