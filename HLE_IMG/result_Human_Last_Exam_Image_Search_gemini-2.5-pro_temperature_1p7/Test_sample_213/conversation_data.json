    "The sheet music provided is the opening of the second act of the opera **Wozzeck** by the Austrian composer **Alban Berg**.\n\nComposed between 1914 and 1922, *Wozzeck* is a seminal work of operatic expressionism and is notable for its atonal music and innovative structure. Berg structured the opera in three acts, with each act containing five scenes. The second act, from which this music is taken, is formally structured as a symphony in five movements. The first scene of this act is cast in the form of a Sonata-Allegro.\n\nThe instrumentation seen in the score, including a large string section with specific instructions like \"mit Dämpfer\" (with mute) and \"die übrigen\" (the rest), along with woodwinds such as the English horn, is characteristic of the detailed orchestration Berg employed. The German marking \"Vorhang\" indicates the raising of the curtain, confirming this is the start of a scene. The complex, chromatic language is a hallmark of the opera, which was one of the first full-length operas written in a freely atonal style.<<<Wozzeck>>>"
