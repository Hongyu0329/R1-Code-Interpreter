    "The figure leaving the chariot is Talos, a giant man of bronze from Greek mythology.\n\nThis scene is depicted on an Attic red-figure volute krater dating from around 400-390 B.C. The vase, attributed to the \"Talos Painter,\" is housed in the Jatta National Archaeological Museum in Ruvo di Puglia, Italy.\n\nThe artwork illustrates an episode from the story of Jason and the Argonauts. In the myth, Talos was a bronze automaton who guarded the island of Crete. He would circle the island three times a day to protect Europa from pirates and invaders. The Argonauts encountered him on their return journey.\n\nThe vase portrays the death of Talos, who is shown collapsing. In some versions of the myth, the sorceress Medea, who was with the Argonauts, defeats Talos by magic, causing him to graze his ankle and lose all his vital fluid (ichor). The figures of Castor and Pollux, the Dioscuri, are also shown supporting the dying giant. The scene is witnessed by the gods Poseidon and Amphitrite.\n\n<<<Talos>>>"
