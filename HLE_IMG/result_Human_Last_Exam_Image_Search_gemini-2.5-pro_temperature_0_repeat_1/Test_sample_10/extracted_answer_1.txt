Based on the provided data and existing chemical literature, the inversion barrier for triacenaphtho[3,2,1,8-cdefg:3',2',1',8'-ijklm:3'',2'',1'',8''-opqra]triphenylene is expected to be significantly greater than 49 kcal/mol, likely exceeding 100 kcal/mol, and for practical purposes, the molecule can be considered configurationally stable with an extremely high or insurmountable inversion barrier. A precise integer value cannot be given without performing the specific quantum chemical calculation.
