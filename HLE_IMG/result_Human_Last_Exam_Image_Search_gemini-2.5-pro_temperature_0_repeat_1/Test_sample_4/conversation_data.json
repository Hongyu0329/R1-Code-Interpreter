    "The knot depicted in the image is known in knot theory as the 9₄₂ knot. The Jones polynomial, V(t), for this knot is:\n\nt⁻⁴ - t⁻³ + t⁻² - t⁻¹ + 1 - t + t²\n\nIn decreasing degree order, the polynomial is:\n\nt² - t + 1 - t⁻¹ + t⁻² - t⁻³ + t⁻⁴\n\nAn interesting characteristic of the 9₄₂ knot is that it is one of the first examples of a chiral knot that is not distinguished from its mirror image by the standard Jones polynomial, meaning both have the same polynomial.\n\n<<<t^2 - t + 1 - t^-1 + t^-2 - t^-3 + t^-4>>>"
