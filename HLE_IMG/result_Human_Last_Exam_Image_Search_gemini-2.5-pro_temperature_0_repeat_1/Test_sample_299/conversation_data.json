    "The two-move checkmate is achieved by the following sequence:\n\n**1. Rh5-f5**\n\nThis quiet move puts Black in a state of zugzwang, where any move Black makes will lead to an immediate checkmate. The Black king has no legal moves, and the pawns on e5 and f4 are blocked. Therefore, Black must move either its queen or its rook.\n\n*   If Black plays **Qxf5**, White delivers checkmate with **Ne7-g6#**. The knight on g6 attacks the king on e4, which has no escape squares. The squares d3 and f3 are covered by the white rook on f3, and the squares d4 and d5 are controlled by the white queen on a4.\n*   If the Black queen moves to any other square, or if the Black rook on c6 moves, White checkmates with **Rf5-e5#**. The rook on e5 attacks the king, which is trapped by White's other pieces.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n1.  **Rf5**\n2.  **Ng6#** or **Re5#** depending on Black's move.\n\n<<<1. Rf5>>>"
