    "The process depicted in the image is the **buckling of a fungal hypha at a septum**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the process shown in the sequential images (L, M, and N):\n*   **Image L:** Shows a straight fungal hypha, which is a long, branching, filamentous structure that is a primary mode of growth for fungi. The arrowhead points to a septum, which is a cross-wall that divides the hypha into separate cells.\n*   **Image M:** The hypha begins to bend at the septum indicated by the arrowhead. A bulge is forming, which suggests the cell wall at this location is yielding.\n*   **Image N:** The bending has become more pronounced, forming a distinct kink or buckle. The bulge at the septum is larger, indicating a significant weakening of the cell wall at this point.\n\nThis buckling phenomenon occurs when the internal turgor pressure, the force of water pushing against the inside of the cell wall, exceeds the structural integrity of the wall at a specific point. The cell wall of a fungus is normally rigid, but certain conditions can cause it to weaken. In this particular image, which is from a study on the fungus *Coprinus cinereus*, this weakening was induced by treatment with a drug called cytochalasin. This drug disrupts the actin cytoskeleton, a network of protein filaments essential for maintaining cell shape and wall integrity, particularly at the septa. When the actin cytoskeleton is compromised, the cell wall at the septum becomes weak, and the internal turgor pressure causes it to bulge and the hypha to buckle.\n\n<<<Hyphal buckling at a septum>>>"
