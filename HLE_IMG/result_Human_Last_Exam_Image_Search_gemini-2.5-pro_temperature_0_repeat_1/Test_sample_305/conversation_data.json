    "The product advertised with the slogan \"Women are winning the War - of Freedom\" during World War II was **Tampax**.\n\nThis advertisement, which appeared in British magazines around 1942, targeted the millions of women who had entered the workforce to support the war effort. The \"inherent limitation\" the product helped women overcome was menstruation. By offering a more practical and discreet form of sanitary protection than was previously available, Tampax allowed women to work long shifts in factories and on farms without interruption, thus contributing to their \"freedom\" and the war effort.\n\nThe name \"Tampax\" is derived from the word \"tampon,\" which itself comes from the medieval French word \"tampion,\" meaning a plug or stopper.\n\n<<<Tampax>>>"
