    "The stereochemical assignments for the four stereocenters, moving from left to right in the reaction scheme, are determined by applying the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. The reaction is an esterification which proceeds with retention of configuration at both chiral centers, meaning the three-dimensional arrangement of the substituents around each stereocenter does not change. However, the (R) or (S) designation can change if the priority of the substituents changes.\n\n1.  **Stereocenter of the Acyl Chloride (Reactant 1):**\n    *   The chiral carbon is attached to -OMe, -CF₃, -Ph, and -C(=O)Cl.\n    *   The CIP priorities are: (1) -OMe, (2) -C(=O)Cl, (3) -CF₃, (4) -Ph.\n    *   With the lowest priority group (-Ph) in the plane and the highest priority group (-OMe) pointing away, the sequence 1 → 2 → 3 traces a counter-clockwise path. However, applying the standard rules for assigning configuration (e.g., by swapping groups to place the lowest priority group in the back) reveals the configuration is **(R)**.\n\n2.  **Stereocenter of the Alcohol (Reactant 2):**\n    *   The chiral carbon is attached to -OH, -CH₂OMe, -CH₂CH(Me)₂, and an implicit -H.\n    *   The CIP priorities are: (1) -OH, (2) -CH₂OMe, (3) -CH₂CH(Me)₂, (4) -H.\n    *   The lowest priority group (-H) is pointing away from the viewer (dashed bond). The path from priority 1 → 2 → 3 is clockwise.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration is **(R)**.\n\n3.  **Stereocenter of the Alcohol-derived portion of the Ester (Product, left side):**\n    *   The reaction does not alter the bonds to this stereocenter, so the configuration is retained.\n    *   The -OH group becomes an ester group, -O-C(=O)R. The CIP priorities of the substituents remain in the same order: (1) -O-Ester, (2) -CH₂OMe, (3) -CH₂CH(Me)₂, (4) -H.\n    *   Since the arrangement and priorities are analogous to the starting alcohol, the configuration remains **(R)**.\n\n4.  **Stereocenter of the Acyl-derived portion of the Ester (Product, right side):**\n    *   The reaction retains the configuration at this center, but the identity of one substituent changes from -C(=O)Cl to -C(=O)OR'.\n    *   This change alters the CIP priorities. For the ester, the priorities are: (1) -OMe, (2) -CF₃, (3) -C(=O)OR', (4) -Ph. Note that the priorities of the trifluoromethyl and ester groups have swapped compared to the starting acyl chloride.\n    *   Due to this change in priorities, even with the retained 3D arrangement, the stereochemical descriptor changes. The configuration is now **(S)**.\n\nThus, the sequence of stereochemical assignments from left to right is (R), (R), (R), (S).\n\n<<<(R), (R), (R), (S)>>>"
