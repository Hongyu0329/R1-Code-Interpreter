    "The Google Trends graph displays annual search interest spikes corresponding to three major historical events in the United States.\n\nThe country is the **United States**.\n\nHere is an analysis of the three events represented in the graph:\n*   **The Red Line:** This line shows a recurring peak in early December. This corresponds to National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, which is observed annually on December 7th in the U.S. to honor the 2,403 Americans killed in the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. Congress designated December 7th as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day in 1994.\n*   **The Yellow Line:** This line shows a sharp and significant peak around late August and early September each year. This represents the anniversary of the September 11th attacks. On this day in 2001, a series of terrorist attacks killed 2,977 people. Annual commemorations are held to remember the victims.\n*   **The Blue Line:** This line shows a smaller, yet consistent, peak around early June. This spike in searches relates to the anniversary of D-Day, the Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944. This event was a turning point in World War II and involved around 156,000 Allied soldiers, including a large contingent from the United States.\n\nThese three events are significant moments in American history, and their anniversaries consistently generate public interest and remembrance, as reflected in the Google Trends data.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
