    "The author of this detailed relief from an altarpiece is not definitively known, but it is attributed to the circle of the French Renaissance sculptor **Jean Goujon**.\n\nThis relief, depicting a communion scene with the inscription \"SACRAMENT DE L'AUTEL\" (Sacrament of the Altar), is a detail from the altarpiece of the chapel of the Château d'Écouen. This château was the residence of Constable Anne de Montmorency. The altarpiece was created between 1540 and 1550.\n\nWhile the main, larger relief on the altarpiece depicts the *Sacrifice of Isaac*, the front and sides are adorned with several smaller reliefs. These include representations of the four Evangelists and the three theological virtues: Faith, Hope, and Charity. The authorship of these sculptures is not precisely documented, leading to their attribution to the \"entourage\" or circle of Jean Goujon, a prominent sculptor of the French Renaissance. It is believed that Goujon may have provided the designs, while the actual carving was carried out by other sculptors in his workshop.\n\nThe altarpiece was dismantled during the French Revolution and was later installed in the chapel of the Château de Chantilly in the 19th century, where it can be found today. Although the artist is officially listed as \"Unknown\" by the Château de Chantilly, the work is consistently associated with Jean Goujon and his influential style.\n\n<<<Jean Goujon's circle>>>"
