Based on the provided information, the S100B protein exhibits a strong affinity for the **V-domain** of the RAGE receptor. It could be used as a **prognostic marker** in the pathology of neurological disorders because its overexpression is directly linked to the activation of pathways that cause neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration, which are indicative of disease progression and severity. However, due to its presence in various other diseases, it is often used as an **adjunct marker** in clinical practice.
