    "To determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we will first calculate the total VMT for the Baseline scenario and the Proposed scenario. The calculation is based on the share of trips for each distance category, the mode share for cars within each category, and the average trip distance. A key step is to convert person trips for carpools into vehicle trips by dividing by the average carpool occupancy.\n\n### **1. Calculate Baseline Car VMT**\n\nWe calculate a weighted VMT for each distance category and sum them up. The formula for the weighted VMT in each category is:\n\n*VMT = (Share of Total Trips) x [ (Mode Share for Car, 1 occupant) x (Avg. Trip Distance) + (Mode Share for Carpool / Avg. Carpool Occupancy) x (Avg. Trip Distance) ]*\n\n**Baseline Data:**\n*   Average Carpool Occupancy: 2.8\n\n**Calculations:**\n*   **0-3 miles:** 0.48 x [ (0.25 x 1) + (0.28 / 2.8) x 1 ] = 0.48 x [0.25 + 0.1] = **0.168**\n*   **3-5 miles:** 0.22 x [ (0.38 x 4) + (0.43 / 2.8) x 4 ] = 0.22 x [1.52 + 0.614] = **0.469**\n*   **5-10 miles:** 0.14 x [ (0.40 x 7.5) + (0.45 / 2.8) x 7.5 ] = 0.14 x [3.0 + 1.205] = **0.589**\n*   **10+ miles:** 0.16 x [ (0.42 x 20) + (0.47 / 2.8) x 20 ] = 0.16 x [8.4 + 3.357] = **1.881**\n\n**Total Baseline Weighted VMT** = 0.168 + 0.469 + 0.589 + 1.881 = **3.107**\n\n### **2. Calculate Proposed Car VMT**\n\nWe use the same formula with the data from the Proposed table.\n\n**Proposed Data:**\n*   Average Carpool Occupancy: 3.0\n\n**Calculations:**\n*   **0-3 miles:** 0.48 x [ (0.01 x 1) + (0.02 / 3.0) x 1 ] = 0.48 x [0.01 + 0.007] = **0.008**\n*   **3-5 miles:** 0.22 x [ (0.08 x 4) + (0.19 / 3.0) x 4 ] = 0.22 x [0.32 + 0.253] = **0.126**\n*   **5-10 miles:** 0.14 x [ (0.14 x 7.5) + (0.27 / 3.0) x 7.5 ] = 0.14 x [1.05 + 0.675] = **0.242**\n*   **10+ miles:** 0.16 x [ (0.16 x 20) + (0.33 / 3.0) x 20 ] = 0.16 x [3.2 + 2.2] = **0.864**\n\n**Total Proposed Weighted VMT** = 0.008 + 0.126 + 0.242 + 0.864 = **1.240**\n\n### **3. Calculate Percentage Reduction**\n\nThe percentage reduction is calculated as follows:\n\n*Percentage Reduction = [ (Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT ] x 100*\n\n**Calculation:**\n*   Percentage Reduction = [ (3.107 - 1.240) / 3.107 ] x 100\n*   Percentage Reduction = (1.867 / 3.107) x 100\n*   Percentage Reduction = 0.601 x 100 = **60.1%**\n\nBy changing the composition of mode share from the Baseline to the Proposed scenario, the Car VMT can be reduced by approximately 60.1%.\n\n<<<60.1>>>"
