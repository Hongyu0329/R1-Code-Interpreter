    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two products of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: 4π Electrocyclic Ring Opening**\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Material:** The starting material is a cyclobutene derivative. Let's label the carbons of the ring starting from the bottom left and going counter-clockwise:\n    *   **C1:** Part of the double bond, substituted with a methoxy group (OMe).\n    *   **C2:** The other carbon of the double bond, unsubstituted (has a hydrogen).\n    *   **C3:** A saturated carbon substituted with a methyl group (Me, wedge) and a methoxy group (OMe, dash).\n    *   **C4:** A saturated carbon with two hydrogens (CH₂).\n    The systematic name is (3R or 3S)-1-methoxy-3-methyl-3-methoxycyclobut-1-ene. The specific enantiomer is drawn.\n\n2.  **Apply Woodward-Hoffmann Rules:** The reaction is a thermal (indicated by Δ) 4π electrocyclic ring opening. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, this process occurs in a **conrotatory** fashion. This means the substituents on the breaking sigma bond (C3-C4) rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise).\n\n3.  **Determine the Diene Structure:** The ring opening involves the breaking of the C3-C4 sigma bond and the C1=C2 pi bond, and the formation of new pi bonds between C2=C3 and C1=C4. This leads to a conjugated diene with the backbone C4-C1=C2-C3.\n    Let's trace the substituents to the resulting diene structure:\n    *   The diene is formed from the atoms C4=C1-C2=C3.\n    *   **C4** from the cyclobutene was CH₂, so it becomes a =CH₂ group.\n    *   **C1** had an OMe group, so it becomes =C(OMe)-.\n    *   **C2** had an H, so it becomes -CH=.\n    *   **C3** had Me and OMe groups, so it becomes =C(Me)(OMe).\n    The resulting diene is **CH₂=C(OMe)-CH=C(Me)(OMe)** (2-methoxy-4-methoxy-4-methyl-1,3-pentadiene).\n\n4.  **Stereochemistry of the Diene:** The starting cyclobutene is chiral at C3. The conrotatory ring opening is a stereospecific process. The chirality at C3 is destroyed as it becomes an sp² hybridized carbon, but it dictates the resulting geometry and chirality of the diene. The diene product is chiral due to hindered rotation (atropisomerism), existing as a specific, non-racemic conformer that proceeds to the next step.\n\n**Step 2: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n\n1.  **Identify the Diene and Dienophile:**\n    *   **Diene:** CH₂=C(OMe)-CH=C(Me)(OMe), which is electron-rich due to the multiple electron-donating groups (OMe, Me).\n    *   **Dienophile:** Ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-CO₂Et), which is electron-poor due to the electron-withdrawing ester group (CO₂Et).\n\n2.  **Determine the Regiochemistry:** The reaction between an electron-rich diene and an electron-poor dienophile can lead to two regioisomers.\n    *   **Regioisomer 1 (\"meta\" addition):** This pathway leads to products where the CO₂Et group is adjacent to the C(Me)(OMe) group. This corresponds to products **A, B, C, and D**.\n    *   **Regioisomer 2 (\"para\" addition):** This pathway leads to products where the CO₂Et group is separated from the C(Me)(OMe) group by a CH₂ group. This corresponds to products **E, F, G, and H**.\n    While electronic effects (donating group at C2 of the diene) favor the \"para\" isomer, Diels-Alder reactions often yield a mixture of regioisomers. The question asks for two products, which strongly suggests that both regioisomers are formed.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry (Endo Rule):** The problem specifies that the Diels-Alder reaction occurs in an **endo** fashion. This means the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (CO₂Et) is oriented towards the π-system of the diene in the transition state. This orientation determines the relative stereochemistry of the newly formed stereocenters.\n    *   The reaction starts with a single enantiomer of the cyclobutene, which leads to a single chiral diene.\n    *   The reaction of this chiral diene is diastereoselective. The dienophile will preferentially attack one of the two faces of the diene.\n    *   This leads to a single diastereomer for each regioisomeric pathway.\n\n4.  **Identify the Final Products:** We need to find one product from the A-D set and one from the E-H set that have consistent stereochemistry resulting from a single chiral diene reacting in an endo fashion. Let's analyze the pair **C and G**.\n\n    *   **Product C (Regioisomer 1):** The stereocenters are at the carbons bearing the C(Me,OMe) group and the CO₂Et group. In structure C, the Me group is wedged, the OMe is dashed, and the CO₂Et group is wedged. The `cis` relationship between the Me group and the CO₂Et group is consistent with an endo approach where the Me group is oriented \"inward\" in the diene transition state.\n\n    *   **Product G (Regioisomer 2):** The stereocenters are at the carbons bearing the C(Me,OMe) group and the CO₂Et group. In structure G, the Me group is wedged, the OMe is dashed, and the CO₂Et group is wedged.\n\n    The pair (C, G) shows a consistent stereochemical outcome. The C(Me,OMe) stereocenter is identical in both (Me-wedge, OMe-dash), and the newly formed stereocenter for the CO₂Et group is also identical (wedge). This is the expected result from the reaction of a single chiral diene giving two different regioisomers.\n\nTherefore, the two products of the reaction are C and G.\n\n<<<C and G>>>"
