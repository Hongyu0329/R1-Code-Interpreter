    "The image and description point to a phenomenon known as the **auditory continuity illusion** or **perceptual restoration of sound**.\n\nThis auditory illusion occurs when a sound, such as a tone or a spoken word, is interrupted by a short burst of another sound, like white noise. Instead of perceiving the original sound as stopping and starting again, the brain \"fills in\" the missing portion, creating the perception that the sound continued uninterrupted behind the noise. The image provided illustrates this: the top panel (a spectrogram) shows a continuous tone that is physically replaced by a burst of noise, while the bottom panel shows the corresponding waveform. The illusion is that we perceive the tone as persisting through the noise.\n\nThis perceptual \"filling-in\" is a common, and typically unconscious, process that helps us understand speech and other sounds in noisy environments. For the illusion to be effective, the interrupting noise must be loud enough to have masked the original sound if it had been present.\n\nA specific and well-known example of this is the **phonemic restoration effect**, first documented by Richard M. Warren in 1970. In his experiments, a phoneme (a basic unit of speech sound) within a word was removed and replaced with a non-speech sound like a cough or a buzz. Listeners not only perceived the word as intact but were often unable to identify which specific sound had been replaced. This demonstrates that the brain uses the surrounding context to restore the missing speech segment.\n\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion (or Perceptual restoration of sound)>>>"
