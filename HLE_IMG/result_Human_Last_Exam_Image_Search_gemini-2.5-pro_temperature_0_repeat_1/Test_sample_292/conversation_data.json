    "The image was taken at McCormick Place in Chicago. The distinctive glass ceiling with a lattice structure and dotted patterns is a key feature of this convention center.\n\nThe dotted pattern on the glass is a recent addition from 2024, designed to prevent bird collisions. Following a major incident in 2023 where nearly 1,000 birds died in one night, a $1.2 million project was undertaken to apply these bird-safe markers to the building's 120,000 square feet of glass. This initiative has reportedly reduced bird collisions by over 95%.\n\nMcCormick Place is the largest convention center in North America and hosts numerous major events, including the Chicago Auto Show.\n\n<<<Chicago>>>"
