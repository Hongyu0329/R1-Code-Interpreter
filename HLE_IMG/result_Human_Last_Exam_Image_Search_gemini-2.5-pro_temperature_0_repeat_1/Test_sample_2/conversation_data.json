    "To determine the time complexity of the given algorithm, we can analyze its recursive structure.\n\nThe provided pseudocode is:\n```python\ndef sort(a, n):\n  if n > 1:\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n    if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n      swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n```\n\n### Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Case:** The recursion stops when `n` is less than or equal to 1. This is the base case.\n\n2.  **Identify the Recursive Step:** For an input of size `n`, the function performs two recursive calls on a subproblem of size `n-1`: `sort(a, n - 1)`.\n\n3.  **Identify the Work Done at Each Step:** Besides the recursive calls, the function performs a comparison and a potential swap. This work takes a constant amount of time, which can be represented as O(1).\n\n### Recurrence Relation\n\nLet T(n) be the time complexity for an input of size `n`. Based on the analysis above, we can write the recurrence relation for the algorithm:\n\n*   **T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + O(1)**\n\nThis means the time to solve a problem of size `n` is twice the time to solve a problem of size `n-1`, plus some constant amount of work.\n\n### Solving the Recurrence Relation\n\nWe can solve this by expansion:\n*   T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c\n*   T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 3c\n*   T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 7c\n*   T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + (2^k - 1) * c\n\nIf we continue this expansion until we reach the base case T(1), we set `k = n - 1`.\n*   T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-1) - 1) * c\n\nSince T(1) is a constant, the expression is dominated by the `2^(n-1)` term. This shows that the time complexity grows exponentially with `n`.\n\nTherefore, the time complexity is **O(2^n)**. This is true for the worst, average, and best cases because the two recursive calls are always made, regardless of the input data.\n\nComparing this to the given answer choices:\nA. O(n)\nB. O(n log n)\nC. O(n^2)\nD. O(n^3)\nE. O(2^n)\nF. does not terminate\n\nThe correct choice is E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
