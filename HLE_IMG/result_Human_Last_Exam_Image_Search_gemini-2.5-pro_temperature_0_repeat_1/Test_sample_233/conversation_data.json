    "The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image fragment is identified as **Sö 179**, also known as the **Gripsholm Runestone**.\n\nThis stone is one of approximately 30 \"Ingvar Runestones,\" which were raised to commemorate those who died during a Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled between 1036 and 1041. The stone is located near Gripsholm Castle in Mariefred, Södermanland, Sweden.\n\nThe inscription was made by a woman named Tóla in memory of her son Harald, who was Ingvar's brother. The text reads: \"Tóla had this stone raised in memory of her son Haraldr, Ingvarr's brother. They travelled valiantly far for gold, and in the east gave (food) to the eagle. (They) died in the south in Serkland.\" The phrase \"gave food to the eagle\" is a poetic kenning for killing enemies in battle.\n\nDiscovered in the early 1820s, the runestone was being used as a threshold in the cellar of the castle tower. It was removed and placed in its current location in 1930. The carving is noted for its somewhat sloppy execution and lack of balance compared to other runestones of the era.\n\n<<<Sö 179>>>"
