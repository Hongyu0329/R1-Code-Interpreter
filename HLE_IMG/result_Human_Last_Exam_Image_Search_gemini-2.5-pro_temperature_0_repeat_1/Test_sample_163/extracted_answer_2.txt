The two major products, A and B, are regioisomers formed by the addition of a benzoyloxy group and a tert-butoxy group across the double bond of styrene.

**Compound A:** 1-benzoyloxy-2-tert-butoxy-1-phenylethane
```
      OOCPh
      |
Ph - CH - CH₂ - OtBu
```

**Compound B:** 2-benzoyloxy-1-tert-butoxy-1-phenylethane
```
      OtBu
      |
Ph - CH - CH₂ - OOCPh
```

Where:
*   Ph = Phenyl group (C₆H₅)
*   OOCPh = Benzoyloxy group (C₆H₅COO)
*   OtBu = tert-butoxy group ((CH₃)₃CO)
