    "Based on the analysis of the reaction scheme, the reagents are identified as follows:\n\n*   **Reagent A:** The transformation from compound **1** (a trioxatriangulenium salt) to compound **2** involves the replacement of one of the ether oxygen atoms in the central ring system with a nitrogen atom bearing an amino group (-NH2). This type of reaction, converting a pyrylium-type salt to an N-aminopyridinium-type salt, is characteristic of a reaction with **hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂)**.\n\n*   **Reagent B:** The reaction of compound **2** with reagent B yields compound **3**, a dimethoxy quinacridinium salt with an N-propyl group. This transformation is a known synthetic route where the N-amino heterocyclic compound (**2**) reacts with an aldehyde. The aldehyde reacts with the amino group to form a hydrazone, which then undergoes a series of rearrangement and cyclization reactions to form the quinacridinium ring system. To obtain an N-propyl group in the final product, the aldehyde used must be **butyraldehyde (butanal, CH₃CH₂CH₂CHO)**.\n\nTherefore, the reagents are:\n*   **A: Hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂)**\n*   **B: Butyraldehyde (CH₃CH₂CH₂CHO)**\n\n<<<A is Hydrazine, B is Butyraldehyde>>>"
