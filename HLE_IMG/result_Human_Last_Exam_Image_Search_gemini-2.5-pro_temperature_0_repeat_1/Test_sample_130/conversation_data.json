    "The spectral lines in the image belong to the element **Uranium (U)**.\n\nA reverse image search of the provided spectrum consistently identifies it as the emission spectrum of uranium. The image displays a complex and dense series of emission lines across the visible spectrum, which is characteristic of heavy elements like uranium. One source explicitly labels a very similar image as the \"Emission spectra of atomic uranium\".\n\nEach element emits light at specific wavelengths, creating a unique \"fingerprint\" of spectral lines that allows for its identification. The intricate pattern of blue, green, yellow, orange, and red lines shown in the image is the distinct signature of uranium.\n\n<<<Uranium>>>"
