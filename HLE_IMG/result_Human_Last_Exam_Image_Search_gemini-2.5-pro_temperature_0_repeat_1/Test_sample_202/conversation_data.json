    "Based on the visual analysis and the information from the search results, here is the identification of each rock specimen:\n\n*   **Specimen H: Scoria**\n    This rock is reddish-brown and highly vesicular, meaning it is full of bubble-like cavities. This appearance is characteristic of scoria, a type of volcanic rock. The reddish color is due to the oxidation of iron-rich minerals during its formation. Scoria is denser than pumice and will sink in water.\n\n*   **Specimen I: Breccia**\n    This specimen is composed of large, angular fragments of different types of rocks cemented together in a finer-grained matrix. This texture is characteristic of a sedimentary rock called breccia. The angular shape of the fragments indicates that they were not transported far from their source before being cemented together. Breccias can form in various ways, including from debris flows, faulting, or volcanic eruptions.\n\n*   **Specimen J: Pumice**\n    This is a light-colored, fine-grained, and highly vesicular rock. These are the defining characteristics of pumice, an extrusive volcanic rock. Pumice is formed from frothy, gas-rich lava that cools rapidly. It has a very low density due to its high porosity and often floats on water.\n\n*   **Specimen K: Pegmatite**\n    This rock is composed of very large, interlocking crystals, which is its most distinguishing feature. This coarse-grained texture is characteristic of pegmatite, an intrusive igneous rock. Pegmatites form from the slow cooling of magma, often in the final stages of crystallization, which allows for the growth of exceptionally large crystals. The visible minerals are likely quartz, feldspar, and mica, which are common in pegmatites with a composition similar to granite.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
