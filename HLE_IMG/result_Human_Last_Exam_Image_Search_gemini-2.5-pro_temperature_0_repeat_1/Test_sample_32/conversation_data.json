    "The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that helps distinguish both species at a glance is the seta.\n\nIn *Grimmia montana*, the sporophyte has a straight seta. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by a capsule on an arcuate, or curved, seta. This distinction in the curvature of the seta is a key diagnostic feature for telling the two species apart when sporophytes are present.\n\n<<<The seta of *Grimmia montana* is straight, while the seta of *Grimmia curviseta* is arcuate (curved).>>>"
