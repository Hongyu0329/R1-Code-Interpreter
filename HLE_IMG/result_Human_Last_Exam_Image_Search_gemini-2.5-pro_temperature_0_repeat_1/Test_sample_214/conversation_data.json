    "The sequence of erasure poems, including the one represented in the image, adheres to the poetic form of **haiku**.\n\nThe image is a page from the book *The Other Clouds* by the acclaimed poet and erasure artist Mary Ruefle. In this collection, Ruefle creates poems by erasing most of the text from a 19th-century book, leaving behind a sequence of three-line poems.\n\nWhile your description mentions a four-line stanza, the poems in this specific collection are consistently identified by literary sources as haiku. A traditional Japanese haiku consists of three lines with a syllable pattern of five, seven, and five, respectively. However, many modern and English-language haiku poets focus on the spirit of the form—a short, three-line poem that captures a distinct moment or image—without strictly following the syllable count.\n\nThe final line you provided, \"nacreous wavers,\" contains five syllables, which aligns perfectly with the final line of a haiku. Although the arrangement of words on the page you shared and the syllable counts of individual lines may not strictly conform to the 5-7-5 structure, they are part of a larger work renowned for its use of the haiku form.\n\n<<<Haiku>>>"
