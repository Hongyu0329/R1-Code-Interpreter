    "The transformation shown involves two distinct photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions.\n\nThe first step is the photochemical valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to its \"Dewar\" isomer, hexafluoro-bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene. This type of reaction, which involves the formation of a ring from an open-chain conjugated system (or in this case, a cyclic conjugated system rearranging to a bicyclic one), is classified as an **electrocyclic reaction**. Specifically, it is a photochemically allowed 4π-electron electrocyclic ring-closing reaction.\n\nThe second step is the reaction between the intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, and cyclobutene. This reaction involves the two π bonds of the alkenes coming together to form two new σ bonds, creating a four-membered ring. This is known as a **[2+2] cycloaddition**. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, [2+2] cycloadditions are generally forbidden under thermal conditions but are allowed under photochemical conditions. The reaction between hexafluorobenzene and various cycloalkenes, including cyclobutene, is known to proceed via a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\nTherefore, the two pericyclic reactions involved are:\n1.  An **electrocyclic reaction** (valence isomerization).\n2.  A **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n<<<An electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition>>>"
