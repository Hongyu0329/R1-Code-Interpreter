    "The circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, form a dominant seventh flat nine chord.\n\nAn analysis of the notes reveals the following:\n*   **Key Signature:** D minor\n*   **Notes Present:** The notes in the measure are C♯, E, and G in the right hand, and A and C♯ in the left hand. The B♭ in the right hand is an appoggiatura, a non-chord tone that resolves down to the A.\n*   **Chord Identification:** The collective notes (A, C♯, E, G, and B♭) form an A dominant seventh chord with a minor (or flat) ninth. The notes are A (root), C♯ (major third), E (perfect fifth), G (minor seventh), and B♭ (minor ninth).\n*   **Roman Numeral:** In the key of D minor, the dominant (V) chord is A major. Therefore, the A7(♭9) chord functions as the dominant seventh flat nine. This is commonly represented by the Roman numeral **V♭⁹**. This chord creates significant tension that typically resolves to the tonic chord (i), which in this case is D minor.\n\n<<<V♭⁹>>>"
