    "The tiling in the image exhibits several points of rotational symmetry. By analyzing the arrangement of the geometric shapes, we can determine the overall symmetry of the pattern.\n\nThe most prominent points of rotation are the centers of the dark blue hexagons. If you were to rotate the entire pattern around the center of one of these hexagons, it would align perfectly with its original position six times in a full 360-degree turn. This means there are points of 6-fold rotational symmetry, with rotations of 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, and 300° leaving the tiling unchanged.\n\nThe tiling shown is a type of uniform tiling. Specifically, it appears to be related to the rhombitrihexagonal tiling, which has a symmetry group designated as p6m. This group's notation indicates the presence of 6-fold rotational symmetry. While there are other points of lesser rotational symmetry, such as 2-fold rotation at the vertices where two yellow squares and two orange rhombi meet, the overall rotational symmetry of a tiling is defined by the highest order of rotation present.\n\nTherefore, the tiling has a 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
