    "After a thorough analysis of the image and considering the context of Byzantine manuscripts, the word in the image is identified.\n\nThe transcription of the word is **μᾶλλον**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the paleographic analysis:\n*   **μ (mu)**: The first letter is clearly a minuscule mu.\n*   **α (alpha) with diacritics**: The second letter is an alpha. Above it is a combination of a smooth breathing mark and an acute accent (ἄ). In later Byzantine manuscripts, the distinction between a circumflex (ᾶ) and an acute accent (ά) was often not strictly observed in pronunciation and writing. The word μᾶλλον is properly written with a circumflex. The addition of the smooth breathing mark is likely a scribal error or a stylistic flourish, as the word does not begin with a vowel.\n*   **λ (lambda)**: The third letter, which resembles a theta (θ), is interpreted as a cursive form of lambda. In some Byzantine hands, the loop of the lambda could be closed, making it resemble a theta, especially when written quickly. Given that \"μθ\" is a very rare initial combination in Greek and that μᾶλλον is a very common word, this interpretation is the most plausible.\n*   **λ (lambda)**: The fourth letter is a more standard minuscule lambda.\n*   **ον (omicron-nu)**: The final two letters are represented by a ligature. The character that looks like an infinity symbol (∞) or two connected 'o's is a known Byzantine ligature for **ου (ou)**. However, in this context, it represents **ον (on)**. The confusion between the ligatures for 'ου' and 'ον' is a known paleographical challenge. The word μᾶλλον ends in -ον. The final stroke is the 'ν' (nu).\n\nTherefore, despite the ambiguous letterforms and diacritics typical of later Byzantine cursive scripts, the word is a slightly irregular writing of **μᾶλλον**.\n\n**Meaning:**\nThe word **μᾶλλον** (mâllon) is a very common adverb in Ancient and Byzantine Greek. It is the comparative form of the adverb μάλα (mála), meaning \"very\".\n\nIts primary meanings are:\n*   **more**, to a greater degree\n*   **rather**, **instead**\n\nFor example, it is used in phrases like \"more beautiful\" or in sentences to express preference, such as \"I would rather do this than that.\"\n\n<<<μᾶλλον>>>"
