    "To determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$, we first need to find the Thevenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, seen by the capacitor C. The cutoff frequency, expressed as an angular frequency $\\omega_c$, is given by the formula:\n\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\n\nThe Thevenin resistance is calculated by looking into node $a_0$ with respect to ground ($b_0$) while deactivating all independent sources. This means the input at node $c_0$ is grounded. The problem then reduces to finding the resistance of the infinite ladder network from node $a_0$ (which we can label $d_0$) to ground, given that node $c_0$ is also grounded.\n\nWe can solve this using nodal analysis. Let $V_n$ be the voltage at node $c_n$ and $U_n$ be the voltage at node $d_n$. We apply a test current $I_{in}$ at node $d_0$ and find the resulting voltage $U_0$. The Thevenin resistance will be $R_{th} = U_0 / I_{in}$.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n1.  $V_0 = 0$ (since $c_0$ is grounded).\n2.  The voltages must decay to zero as we move to infinity, i.e., $V_n \\to 0$ and $U_n \\to 0$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nFor any node $n \\ge 1$, Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) gives us a system of linear difference equations:\nAt node $c_n$: $\\frac{V_n - V_{n-1}}{r} + \\frac{V_n - V_{n+1}}{r} + \\frac{V_n - U_n}{r} = 0 \\implies 3V_n - V_{n-1} - V_{n+1} - U_n = 0$\nAt node $d_n$: $\\frac{U_n - U_{n-1}}{r} + \\frac{U_n - U_{n+1}}{r} + \\frac{U_n - V_n}{r} = 0 \\implies 3U_n - U_{n-1} - U_{n+1} - V_n = 0$\n\nThis coupled system can be solved by defining new variables $S_n = V_n + U_n$ and $D_n = V_n - U_n$. Adding and subtracting the two equations gives two uncoupled recurrence relations:\n$S_{n+1} - 2S_n + S_{n-1} = 0$\n$D_{n+1} - 4D_n + D_{n-1} = 0$\n\nThe solutions to these equations that satisfy the boundary condition at infinity ($V_n, U_n \\to 0$) are:\n$S_n = 0$\n$D_n = A \\cdot (2 - \\sqrt{3})^n$, where A is a constant.\n\nFrom these, we deduce that for $n \\ge 1$, $V_n = -U_n$. Substituting this into the KCL equation for $V_n$ gives:\n$4V_n - V_{n-1} - V_{n+1} = 0$\nThe decaying solution is of the form $V_n = V_1 \\cdot (2-\\sqrt{3})^{n-1}$.\n\nBy applying the boundary conditions at $n=0$ and $n=1$ and solving the KCL equations at the first few nodes, we can find the relationship between the input current $I_{in}$ at $d_0$ and the voltage $U_0$. This extensive calculation yields the Thevenin resistance:\n\n$R_{th} = \\frac{4r}{3 + 2\\sqrt{3}}$\n\nNow, we can find the cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$:\n\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{(\\frac{4r}{3 + 2\\sqrt{3}})C} = \\frac{3 + 2\\sqrt{3}}{4rC}$\n\n<<<$\\omega_c = \\frac{3 + 2\\sqrt{3}}{4rC}$>>>"
