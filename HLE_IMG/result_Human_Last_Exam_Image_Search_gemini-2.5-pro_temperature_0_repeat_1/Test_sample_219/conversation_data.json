    "Based on the analysis of the provided graph, the synchronized bursts of neuronal firing activity are identified at the following approximate timestamps:\n*   **Burst 1:** 3 s\n*   **Burst 2:** 16 s\n*   **Burst 3:** 27 s\n*   **Burst 4:** 37 s\n*   **Burst 5:** 49 s\n\nThe inter-burst intervals (the time between the start of consecutive bursts) are calculated as follows:\n*   Interval 1: 16 s - 3 s = 13 s\n*   Interval 2: 27 s - 16 s = 11 s\n*   Interval 3: 37 s - 27 s = 10 s\n*   Interval 4: 49 s - 37 s = 12 s\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is the mean of these values:\nAverage = (13 + 11 + 10 + 12) / 4 = 46 / 4 = 11.5 s\n\nRounding the average inter-burst interval to two significant figures gives 12 s.\n\n<<<12>>>"
