    "The icon in question is a fresco from the Sopoćani monastery in Serbia. It depicts an elderly, bearded saint with a halo, holding a scroll with an inscription in Old Church Slavonic. This specific fresco is located on the south wall of the monastery's nave and is identified in the BLAGO Fund's collection of Serbian monastery art as \"Unknown Holy Stylite\".\n\nThe term \"stylite\" refers to a type of Christian ascetic who lived on a pillar (from the Greek *stylos*). The most renowned of these saints is Saint Simeon Stylites the Elder. The iconography in the fresco—a monastic figure of advanced age—is consistent with depictions of Saint Simeon Stylites. Frescoes of stylite saints are a known feature of the Sopoćani monastery, which was constructed in the 13th century.\n\nWhile the visual evidence strongly suggests the figure is a stylite, and Saint Simeon is the most prominent one, the official cataloging of the fresco as \"Unknown Holy Stylite\" indicates that the specific identity of the saint is not definitively confirmed from the artwork or its immediate context within the monastery. The inscription on the scroll held by the saint could provide a conclusive identification, but a translation of this specific text is not readily available in the researched sources.\n\nBased on the available visual evidence and iconographic conventions, the depicted figure is a stylite saint. Among the given choices, Saint Simeon Stylites is the most plausible identification due to his prominence and the consistency of his iconography with the fresco.\n\n<<<F>>>"
