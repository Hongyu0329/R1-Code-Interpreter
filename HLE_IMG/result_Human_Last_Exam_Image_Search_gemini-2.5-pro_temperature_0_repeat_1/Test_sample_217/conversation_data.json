    "The cuneiform sign shown in the image is íÇç (√â), which means \"house\" or \"temple\" in Sumerian. The depiction is consistent with the form of this sign as it appeared in the third millennium BCE. An image from a relief from Ur, dated to 2500 BCE, shows a very similar representation for the word \"temple.\"\n\nThe sign evolved from a pictograph representing a house. In Sumerian, the term √â.GAL (íÇçíÉ≤), literally \"big house,\" was used for a palace.\n\nTherefore, the correct meaning of the sign in its third-millennium form is \"Home.\"\n\n<<<D>>>"
