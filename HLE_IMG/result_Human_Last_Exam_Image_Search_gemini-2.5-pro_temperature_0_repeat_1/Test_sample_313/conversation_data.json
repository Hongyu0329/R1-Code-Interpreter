    "The two-part riddle refers to the term **Mad Hatter**.\n\nThe man pictured is former NHL goaltender Robin Lehner, who was receiving the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy at the NHL Awards on June 19, 2019. Lehner was given the award, which recognizes perseverance and dedication to hockey, after he publicly shared his struggles with addiction and mental health issues, including bipolar disorder. In his acceptance speech, he famously stated, \"I'm not ashamed to say I'm mentally ill, but that doesn't mean I'm mentally weak.\" The first part of the riddle is a metaphorical reference to Lehner as a \"Mad Hatter,\" alluding to his mental health journey.\n\nThe second part of the riddle refers to the historical origin of the phrase \"mad as a hatter.\" In the 18th and 19th centuries, hat makers used mercury salts, specifically mercuric nitrate, in a process called \"carroting\" to turn animal fur into felt for hats. Prolonged exposure to the toxic mercury vapors caused the workers to develop severe neurological damage, a condition known as \"mad hatter disease,\" with symptoms including tremors, emotional instability, and psychosis. This industrial use of mercury was banned in the United States in the early 1940s due to its toxicity.\n\n<<<Mad Hatter>>>"
