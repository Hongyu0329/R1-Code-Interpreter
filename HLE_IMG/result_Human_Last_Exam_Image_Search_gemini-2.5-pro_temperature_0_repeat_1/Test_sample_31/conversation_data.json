    "The knot in the picture is identified as the **8₁₈ knot**. This identification is confirmed by comparing the image to known diagrams of knots with 8 crossings, such as those found in the Knot Atlas. The 8₁₈ knot is also known as the carrick mat in its basic form.\n\nThe Rasmussen s-invariant is a number associated with a knot, derived from a branch of mathematics called Khovanov homology. For the 8₁₈ knot, the Rasmussen s-invariant is **0**.\n\nThis value is listed in the Knot Atlas, a comprehensive database of knots and their properties. The Rasmussen invariant is a powerful tool in knot theory, providing information about the \"sliceness\" of a knot and offering a lower bound for its unknotting number.\n\n<<<0>>>"
