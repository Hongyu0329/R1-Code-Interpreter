    "This gold medallion is a Ptolemaic octodrachm. The style, featuring conjoined busts (a practice known as *capita jugata*), is characteristic of the Hellenistic period in Egypt under the Ptolemaic dynasty.\n\nThe bust on the left, identifiable by the ram's horn, represents a deified ruler, likely Ptolemy II, in the guise of Zeus Ammon. The bust on the right depicts a queen, Arsinoe II. While representing earlier deified rulers, these coins were often struck by later kings and queens, whose own features were sometimes blended into the portraits.\n\nThis specific type of octodrachm, with these particular stylized features, is most commonly attributed to the reign of Ptolemy VI Philometor, who ruled from 180 to 164 BC and again from 163 to 145 BC. This places the medallion firmly in the 2nd century B.C.\n\n<<<2nd century B.C.>>>"
