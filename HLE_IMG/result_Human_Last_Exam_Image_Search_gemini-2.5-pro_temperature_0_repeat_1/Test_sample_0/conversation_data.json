    "The sequence for a mate in 2, without moving the black queens, is as follows:\n\n1.  **Ng3+**: The knight moves to g3, delivering a check to the white king. White's only legal move is to capture the knight with the pawn on h2 (hxg3).\n2.  **Rh8#**: With the h-file now open, the rook moves to h8, delivering checkmate. The white king is trapped, as g1 is covered by the black bishop on h3 and g2 is covered by the black queen on a2.\n\n<<<1. Ng3+ 2. Rh8#>>>"
