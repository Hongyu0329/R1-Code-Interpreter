    "To find the value of the current I, we will use nodal analysis.\n\n### 1. Identify the Nodes and Voltages\nFirst, let's identify the main nodes in the circuit and their voltages.\n*   Let the main vertical wire on the left, connected to the positive terminal of the battery, be **Node A**. Its voltage is **V_A = 41 V**.\n*   Let the main vertical wire on the right, connected to the negative terminal of the battery and ground, be **Node G**. Its voltage is **V_G = 0 V**.\n*   Let the junction connecting the 8 Ω, 14 Ω, and 11 Ω resistors be **Node B**. Its voltage is **V_B**.\n*   Let the junction where the current I flows into, connecting the 14 Ω and 29 Ω resistors, be **Node C**. The wire carrying current I connects Node A directly to Node C, so the voltage at Node C is **V_C = 41 V**.\n\nThe 76 Ω resistor is connected directly between Node A (41 V) and Node G (0 V). It is in parallel with the rest of the circuit and does not affect the calculation of current I, which is in a different branch.\n\n### 2. Apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at Node B\nWe can find the voltage V_B by applying KCL at Node B. The sum of the currents leaving the node is zero.\n*   Current leaving Node B towards Node A through the 8 Ω resistor: (V_B - V_A) / 8 = (V_B - 41) / 8\n*   Current leaving Node B towards Node G through the 11 Ω resistor: (V_B - V_G) / 11 = V_B / 11\n*   Current leaving Node B towards Node C through the 14 Ω resistor: (V_B - V_C) / 14 = (V_B - 41) / 14\n\nThe KCL equation is:\n(V_B - 41) / 8 + V_B / 11 + (V_B - 41) / 14 = 0\n\nNow, we solve for V_B:\nV_B * (1/8 + 1/11 + 1/14) = 41/8 + 41/14\nTo add the fractions, we find a common denominator for 8, 11, and 14, which is 616.\nV_B * (77/616 + 56/616 + 44/616) = 41 * (1/8 + 1/14)\nV_B * (177 / 616) = 41 * (7/56 + 4/56)\nV_B * (177 / 616) = 41 * (11 / 56)\nV_B = (41 * 11 / 56) * (616 / 177)\nSince 616 = 11 * 56:\nV_B = (41 * 11 / 56) * (11 * 56 / 177)\nV_B = (41 * 121) / 177 = 4961 / 177 V\nV_B ≈ 28.03 V\n\n### 3. Apply KCL at Node C to find Current I\nThe current I flows from Node A into Node C. At Node C, this current splits into two paths: one through the 14 Ω resistor to Node B and the other through the 29 Ω resistor to Node G.\n\nAccording to KCL at Node C, the incoming current I must equal the sum of the outgoing currents:\nI = I_14 + I_29\n\n*   The current flowing from Node C to Node B through the 14 Ω resistor is:\n    I_14 = (V_C - V_B) / 14 = (41 - 4961/177) / 14\n    I_14 = ((41 * 177 - 4961) / 177) / 14\n    I_14 = ((7257 - 4961) / 177) / 14\n    I_14 = (2296 / 177) / 14 = 164 / 177 A\n\n*   The current flowing from Node C to Node G through the 29 Ω resistor is:\n    I_29 = (V_C - V_G) / 29 = (41 - 0) / 29 = 41 / 29 A\n\nNow, we sum the two currents to find I:\nI = 164/177 + 41/29\n\nTo add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 177 * 29 = 5133.\nI = (164 * 29) / (177 * 29) + (41 * 177) / (29 * 177)\nI = 4756 / 5133 + 7257 / 5133\nI = (4756 + 7257) / 5133\nI = 12013 / 5133 A\n\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value:\nI ≈ 2.3403 A\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the value of the current I is 2.34 A.\n\n<<<2.34>>>"
