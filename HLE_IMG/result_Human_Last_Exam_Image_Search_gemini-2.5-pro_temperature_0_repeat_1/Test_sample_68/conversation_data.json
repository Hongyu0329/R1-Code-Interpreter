    "This coin originates from the French colonies in the Americas, an area collectively known as New France.\n\nThe inscription \"COLONIES FRANCOISES\" indicates that this coin was minted for general circulation in French overseas territories rather than a single, specific colony. The coin appears to be a 9 Deniers piece, issued under King Louis XV.\n\nThese particular coins were struck in 1721 and 1722 at the mints of Rouen (mint mark B) and La Rochelle (mint mark H). An edict in June 1721, authorized the production of these copper coins specifically for the colonies.\n\nInitially, a large quantity of these coins was sent to Canada in 1722. However, the colonists there were reluctant to use them, leading to the return of most of the coins to France in 1726. Subsequently, they were sent to other parts of New France, including Louisiana, where they circulated more successfully. Some were also sent to Île Bourbon (modern-day Réunion). Therefore, while intended for broad colonial use, they are most closely associated with the French territories in North America, including Canada and Louisiana.\n\n<<<French Colonies in America (New France)>>>"
