    "The full name of the artist who created this painting is Henri Charles Manguin. He was a French painter associated with the Fauvist movement.\n\nManguin was a contemporary and friend of other famous artists like Henri Matisse and Charles Camoin. He was known for his use of bright, pastel colors, greatly influenced by Impressionism and his time spent painting Mediterranean landscapes. Many of his works depict scenes from the south of France, particularly the French Riviera, capturing the vibrant light and lush vegetation of the region.\n\nThe signature \"Manguin\" is visible in the bottom right corner of the painting, which is consistent with how he typically signed his works.\n\n<<<Henri Charles Manguin>>>"
