    "Based on the visual evidence in the image, this photo was likely taken in Seattle, Washington. The key elements are the dark sand beach, the dense forest meeting the shoreline, the calm waters of Puget Sound, and the presence of a bonfire.\n\nIn Seattle, beach fires are only permitted in designated fire pits at Golden Gardens Park and Alki Beach. The scene in the photograph, particularly the natural, undeveloped shoreline with heavy forest, is more characteristic of Golden Gardens Park or Carkeek Park than the more urban Alki Beach. Carkeek Park, located in northwest Seattle, features a beach on Puget Sound, extensive forest, and views of the Olympic Mountains. Discovery Park, Seattle's largest park, also has similar features with tidal beaches, sea cliffs, and forests.\n\nThe image shows a bonfire, which points strongly toward Golden Gardens, as it is one of the few Seattle parks where they are officially allowed in provided fire pits. For the summer of 2022, when the photo was taken, Seattle Parks and Recreation announced that designated fire pits would be available at both Golden Gardens and Alki Beach starting from May 28th.\n\nGiven the combination of the natural landscape and the legal allowance of beach fires, Golden Gardens Park is a very strong candidate. The view also aligns with the geography of the area, looking out onto Puget Sound.\n\n<<<Seattle>>>"
