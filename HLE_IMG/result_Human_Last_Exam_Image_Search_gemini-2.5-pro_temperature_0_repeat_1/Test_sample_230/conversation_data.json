    "The title of the 19th-century painting is \"The Heroic Windmill.\" The artist is the French painter Constant Troyon (1810-1865), who was a member of the Barbizon school. This school of painters is known for its landscape and animal paintings.\n\nThe painting depicts a windmill standing prominently against a dramatic, cloudy sky, with a fire visible in the background. Troyon was known for his depictions of rural scenes and landscapes, often imbued with a sense of grandeur. He was a significant figure in 19th-century French art, and his work influenced later movements. While the term \"heroic windmill\" is also associated with the 17th-century Dutch painter Jacob van Ruisdael, this particular work is attributed to Troyon.\n\n<<<The Heroic Windmill>>>"
