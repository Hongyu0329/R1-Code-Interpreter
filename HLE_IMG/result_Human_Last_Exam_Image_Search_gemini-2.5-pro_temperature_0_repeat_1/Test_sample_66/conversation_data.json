    "Here is a step-by-step solution to find the total area of the shaded regions.\n\n### 1. Deconstruct the Geometry\n\nFirst, let's understand the geometry of one of the shaded regions, for instance, the blue one.\n*   Let the center of the circle be **O**.\n*   The radius of the circular sector is given as **R = 34**.\n*   Let the leftmost point on the arc be **A** and the point separating the blue and red regions be **C**. The radii to these points are **OA** and **OC**, both of length 34.\n*   The blue shaded region is bounded by an arc **AC** and two straight lines, **AB** and **CB**, where **B** is the outer vertex.\n*   The diagram indicates a right angle between the radius **OA** and the line segment **AB**. This means **AB** is tangent to the circle at point **A**. The length of this tangent segment is given as **AB = 17**.\n*   Similarly, for the blue region, there is a right angle between the radius **OC** and the line segment **CB**. This means **CB** is tangent to the circle at point **C**.\n\n### 2. Analyze the Blue Shaded Region\n\nThe blue shaded region is the area enclosed by the two tangents from point B (segments AB and CB) and the arc AC. This area can be calculated by taking the area of the kite **OABC** and subtracting the area of the circular sector **OAC**.\n\n**Area(Blue Shaded Region) = Area(Kite OABC) - Area(Sector OAC)**\n\nHowever, a more intuitive decomposition is to see the shaded region as the triangle **ABC** plus the segment of the circle defined by the arc **AC** and the chord **AC**.\n\n**Area(Blue Shaded Region) = Area(Triangle ABC) + Area(Segment AC)**\n\nLet's verify these two decompositions.\n*   `Area(Segment AC) = Area(Sector OAC) - Area(Triangle OAC)`\n*   `Area(Kite OABC) = Area(Triangle OAC) + Area(Triangle ABC)`\n\nSubstituting these into the second formula:\n`Area(Blue) = Area(Triangle ABC) + (Area(Sector OAC) - Area(Triangle OAC))`\n`Area(Blue) = (Area(Kite OABC) - Area(Triangle OAC)) + Area(Sector OAC) - Area(Triangle OAC)`\n`Area(Blue) = Area(Kite OABC) + Area(Sector OAC) - 2 * Area(Triangle OAC)`\n\nThis shows the two initial decompositions are different. The correct visual decomposition is that the area of the kite OABC is the sum of the shaded area and the area of the triangle OAC.\n**Area(Kite OABC) = Area(Blue Shaded Region) + Area(Triangle OAC)**\nTherefore,\n**Area(Blue Shaded Region) = Area(Kite OABC) - Area(Triangle OAC)**\n\nThis is equivalent to **Area(Triangle ABC)**, which would imply the curved arc AC is the same as the straight chord AC, which is incorrect.\n\nThe correct decomposition is **Area(Blue Shaded Region) = Area(Triangle ABC) + Area(Segment AC)**.\n\n### 3. Calculate the Component Areas\n\nLet's calculate the necessary areas. We need to find the angle **AOC**.\nIn the right-angled triangle **OAB**:\n*   `OA = R = 34`\n*   `AB = 17`\n*   The angle `AOB` can be found using trigonometry. Let `∠AOB = θ`.\n*   `tan(θ) = AB / OA = 17 / 34 = 0.5`. So, `θ = arctan(0.5)`.\n\nBy symmetry, in the right-angled triangle **OCB**:\n*   `OC = R = 34`\n*   `CB = AB = 17` (tangents from the same point B are equal in length).\n*   `∠COB = θ = arctan(0.5)`.\n\nThe angle of the sector OAC is `∠AOC = ∠AOB + ∠COB = 2θ = 2 * arctan(0.5)`.\n\nNow we can calculate the areas:\n*   **Area(Sector OAC)** = `(1/2) * R² * (∠AOC) = (1/2) * 34² * (2 * arctan(0.5)) = 1156 * arctan(0.5)`.\n*   **Area(Triangle OAC)** = `(1/2) * OA * OC * sin(∠AOC) = (1/2) * 34 * 34 * sin(2θ)`.\n    *   We know `tan(θ) = 0.5`. We can find `sin(2θ) = 2tan(θ) / (1 + tan²(θ)) = 2(0.5) / (1 + 0.5²) = 1 / 1.25 = 0.8`.\n    *   `Area(Triangle OAC) = (1/2) * 1156 * 0.8 = 462.4`.\n*   **Area(Kite OABC)** = `2 * Area(Triangle OAB) = 2 * (1/2 * OA * AB) = 34 * 17 = 578`.\n*   **Area(Triangle ABC)** = `Area(Kite OABC) - Area(Triangle OAC) = 578 - 462.4 = 115.6`.\n*   **Area(Segment AC)** = `Area(Sector OAC) - Area(Triangle OAC) = 1156 * arctan(0.5) - 462.4`.\n\n### 4. Calculate the Area of the Blue Shaded Region\n\nUsing the decomposition `Area(Blue) = Area(Triangle ABC) + Area(Segment AC)`:\n`Area(Blue) = 115.6 + (1156 * arctan(0.5) - 462.4) = 1156 * arctan(0.5) - 346.8`.\n\n### 5. Calculate the Total Shaded Area\n\nThe red shaded region is symmetrical to the blue one and has the same area. The problem mentions an overlapping area, but given the geometric inconsistencies that arise from a literal interpretation of the diagram, the most reasonable approach is to calculate the area of the two regions as defined and sum them.\n*   `Area(Red) = Area(Blue) = 1156 * arctan(0.5) - 346.8`.\n*   **Total Shaded Area** = `2 * Area(Blue) = 2 * (1156 * arctan(0.5) - 346.8)`.\n*   `Total Shaded Area = 2312 * arctan(0.5) - 693.6`.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n*   `arctan(0.5) ≈ 0.4636476` radians.\n*   `Total Shaded Area ≈ 2312 * 0.4636476 - 693.6`\n*   `Total Shaded Area ≈ 1071.95 - 693.6 ≈ 378.35`\n\nThe total area of the shaded regions is approximately 378.35.\n\n<<<378.35>>>"
