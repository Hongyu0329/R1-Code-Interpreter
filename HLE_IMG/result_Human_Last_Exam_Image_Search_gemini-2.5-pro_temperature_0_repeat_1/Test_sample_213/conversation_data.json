    "The piece of sheet music is the opening of the second act of the opera *Der Rosenkavalier* by Richard Strauss.\n\nThis comic opera, with a German libretto by Hugo von Hofmannsthal, premiered in Dresden in 1911. The second act begins with this orchestral introduction before the \"Presentation of the Rose\" scene. In this scene, Octavian presents a silver rose to Sophie on behalf of Baron Ochs, leading to the two young people falling in love. The score features prominent parts for flutes, oboe, English horn, and strings, which is consistent with the instrumentation seen in the provided image.\n\n<<<Der Rosenkavalier>>>"
