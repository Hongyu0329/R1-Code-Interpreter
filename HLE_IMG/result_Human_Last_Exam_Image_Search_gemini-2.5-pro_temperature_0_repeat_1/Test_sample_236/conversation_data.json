    "The animal depicted in the center of the image is the Goldenrod Soldier Beetle. Its scientific name is *Chauliognathus pensylvanicus*.\n\nThis insect is also commonly known as the Pennsylvania leatherwing. It belongs to the soldier beetle family, Cantharidae. These beetles are frequently found on goldenrod and other yellow flowers in the late summer and early fall.\n\nKey identifying features visible in the image include its orange and black coloring, the visible black head, and long antennae. The body is elongated, and its wing covers (elytra) are soft, which is why it's called a \"leatherwing\". Adults feed on pollen and nectar, but are also considered beneficial insects as they prey on pests like aphids.\n\n<<<Chauliognathus pensylvanicus>>>"
