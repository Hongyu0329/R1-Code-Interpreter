    "Based on the visual style of the artworks and the information gathered, here are the authors of each of the 9 works, from left to right and top to bottom.\n\n***\n\n**Top Row (from left to right):**\n\n1.  **Liao Bingxiong (廖冰兄):** The first image displays four whimsical, cartoon-like fish, some with human faces. This satirical style is characteristic of the political cartoonist Liao Bingxiong (1915-2006). He was known for integrating folk art and a direct, sometimes \"vulgar,\" calligraphic style into his work to comment on social and political issues.\n\n2.  **Qi Baishi (齐白石):** The second work is an ink wash painting of chrysanthemums, a classic subject in Chinese art. The style and the artist's seal, which reads \"Baishi\" (白石), point to Qi Baishi (1864–1957), one of the most influential Chinese painters. He was celebrated for his vivid and often playful watercolor works depicting flora and fauna.\n\n3.  **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊):** This portrait of a woman in a pink headscarf and red vest is the famous oil painting *Tajik Bride* (塔吉克新娘), created in 1983 by Jin Shangyi (b. 1934). Jin is a leading figure of Neoclassical realism in Chinese oil painting, and this work is considered a masterpiece for its treatment of light and its blend of Western classical techniques with Chinese aesthetics.\n\n**Middle Row (from left to right):**\n\n4.  **Mi Fu (米芾):** This calligraphy is a section from the handscroll *Shu Su Tie* (蜀素帖), one of the most famous works by the Northern Song dynasty artist and scholar Mi Fu (1051–1107). Created in 1088, the work is renowned for its expressive and fluid running script (行书) and is considered one of the greatest examples of Chinese calligraphy.\n\n5.  **Hsiao Chin (萧勤):** This abstract painting featuring a vibrant red circle over an orange semi-circle is characteristic of the work of Hsiao Chin (1935-2023). A pioneer of Chinese abstract art, Hsiao Chin often explored cosmic and spiritual themes, with the sun being a recurring motif in his work. He co-founded the Ton-Fan Art Group, one of the first abstract art collectives in China.\n\n6.  **Mi Fu (米芾):** This piece of calligraphy is a colophon (a commentary or inscription) written by Mi Fu. In his writings, Mi Fu often discussed and critiqued the calligraphy of earlier Tang dynasty masters, expressing his admiration for the styles of the Jin dynasty. The text in the image is a discourse on calligraphy, reflecting his role as a prominent art theorist and connoisseur.\n\n**Bottom Row (from left to right):**\n\n7.  **Mi Fu (米芾):** The vigorous, cursive script in this piece is also characteristic of Mi Fu. It is likely from another of his famous works, such as the *Tiao Xi Shi Juan* (苕溪诗卷). Mi Fu was one of the four most influential calligraphers of the Song dynasty, and his bold, personal style had a profound impact on later generations.\n\n8.  **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊):** This realistic portrait of a young woman is the 1984 oil painting *Young Singer* (青年女歌手) by Jin Shangyi. The subject of the painting is the now-famous singer Peng Liyuan. The work is another prime example of Jin's \"new classic\" style, which combines the precision of European academic art with a distinctly Chinese sensibility.\n\n9.  **Ding Shaoguang (丁绍光):** The final artwork, a stylized painting of a woman in ornate attire, is by Ding Shaoguang (b. 1939). Ding is the founder and a leading figure of the Yunnan School of art. His work is known for its vibrant, decorative style, strong calligraphic lines, and fusion of traditional Chinese elements with modern Western aesthetics like Art Nouveau.\n\n<<<1. Liao Bingxiong\n2.
