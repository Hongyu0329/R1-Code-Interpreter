    "This is a molecule of **hen egg-white lysozyme**.\n\nHen egg-white lysozyme is a small enzyme consisting of 129 amino acids. It is known for its ability to break down the cell walls of bacteria, providing a defense against infection. The structure shown is a ribbon diagram, a common way to visualize the protein's backbone, which folds into a compact, globular shape. This particular representation likely corresponds to a structure deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), such as 1HEW.\n\nThe protein is composed of alpha-helices and beta-sheets. The different colors in the image, dark blue and light blue, may be used to distinguish different domains or highlight specific regions of the protein, such as the N-terminus. For instance, lysozyme has a precursor form with an 18-amino acid N-terminal extension that is cleaved off to produce the mature, active enzyme. The small yellow feature likely represents one of the four disulfide bridges that are crucial for stabilizing the protein's three-dimensional structure.\n\n<<<hen egg-white lysozyme>>>"
