    "The chemical transformation shown in the image involves two steps. The first is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, and the second is a heterocyclic ring formation. To identify the missing reactant, one must analyze the structure of the final product and determine which atoms are incorporated from the starting materials.\n\n1.  **First Reaction (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). The bromoacetyl group is added to the benzene ring, primarily at the para position, to yield 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This intermediate is an α-bromoketone.\n\n2.  **Second Reaction (Imidazole Synthesis):** The α-bromoketone reacts with an unknown reactant to form a substituted imidazole. The final product is *tert-butyl N-(2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazol-1-yl)carbamate*.\n\nBy comparing the structure of the α-bromoketone with the final product, we can deduce the atoms that the missing reactant must contribute. The 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one provides the 4-butylphenyl group at position C4 and the carbon skeleton for the C4 and C5 atoms of the imidazole ring.\n\nThe missing reactant must therefore provide the remaining atoms of the ring (N1, C2, N3) and their substituents. These are:\n*   A nitrogen atom at position 1 (N1), which is substituted with a *tert*-butoxycarbonylamino (-NHBoc) group.\n*   A carbon atom at position 2 (C2), which is substituted with an amino group (-NH₂).\n*   A nitrogen atom at position 3 (N3).\n\nThis specific arrangement of atoms and functional groups points to a derivative of aminoguanidine. The reaction of an α-haloketone with a substituted aminoguanidine is a known method for synthesizing 1,2-diaminoimidazole derivatives. The specific reactant required to introduce the *tert*-butoxycarbonylamino group at the N1 position is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine**, which is also known as **1-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino)guanidine** or **tert-butyl 2-(amino(imino)methyl)hydrazine-1-carboxylate**.\n\nThe reaction proceeds via a condensation-cyclization mechanism, likely involving the formation of a guanylhydrazone intermediate, which then cyclizes to form the substituted imidazole ring.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine"
