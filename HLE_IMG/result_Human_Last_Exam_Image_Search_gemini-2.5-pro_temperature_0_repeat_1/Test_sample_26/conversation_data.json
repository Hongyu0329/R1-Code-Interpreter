    "To determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata, a harmonic analysis is necessary.\n\nThe sonata is in the key of C minor. The key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, and A♭).\n\nIn measure 30, the notes in the right hand are G, B-natural, D, and F, which form a G dominant seventh chord (G7). The left hand plays octaves on G, reinforcing the root of the chord.\n\nIn the key of C minor, the fifth scale degree is G. A triad built on G would be a G major chord (G-B♮-D), which functions as the dominant. The B is natural due to the use of the harmonic minor scale, where the seventh degree is raised to create a leading tone. When the minor seventh (F) is added to this triad, it becomes a dominant seventh chord.\n\nTherefore, the chord in measure 30 is the dominant seventh of C minor. An analysis of the surrounding measures confirms this, as the harmony in this section is built on the dominant chord, which resolves to the tonic (C minor) in the following measures. Some analyses also note the presence of an augmented 6th chord in this measure.\n\nThe Roman numeral for a dominant seventh chord is V7.\n\n<<<V7>>>"
