The GNIS data for names was last updated in 2015, and the elevation data is derived from the National Elevation Dataset, with the specific dataset for this area dating to 2006. It is important to note that elevations in the GNIS are approximate as they are interpolated from a grid and may not be precisely measured values.\n\n<<<1089>>>"
