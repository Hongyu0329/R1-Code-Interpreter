    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction scheme to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material**\n\nFirst, we determine the molecular formula of the starting material.\n*   The core structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n*   It has a trifluoromethyl group (CF₃) on the double bond.\n*   The nitrogen atom is protected by a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group.\n\nLet's count the atoms:\n*   **Bicyclic core (C₆H₅NO):** 6 carbons, 5 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, 1 oxygen.\n*   **Trifluoromethyl group (CF₃):** 1 carbon, 3 fluorines.\n*   **PMB group (C₈H₉O):** 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 oxygen.\n\nCombining these parts, the molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Intermediate 1**\n\nThe first reaction uses Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in acetonitrile/water (ACN/H₂O). CAN is a common reagent used for the oxidative deprotection of PMB groups from nitrogen atoms.\n*   The PMB group (C₈H₉O) is removed.\n*   A hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen.\n\nThe change in the molecular formula is:\n*   Start: C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂\n*   Subtract PMB group (C₈H₈O from the main structure): C₇H₆F₃NO\n*   Add H to the nitrogen: C₇H₇F₃NO. Let's recount from the structure.\n    *   Core structure: 6-CF₃-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    *   Carbons: 6 in the ring system + 1 in the CF₃ group = 7 carbons.\n    *   Hydrogens: 1H at C1, 1H at C4, 1H at C5, 2H at C7, and 1H on the nitrogen = 6 hydrogens.\n    *   Fluorines: 3.\n    *   Nitrogen: 1.\n    *   Oxygen: 1 (from the ketone).\n*   The correct molecular formula for **Intermediate 1** is **C₇H₆F₃NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Intermediate 2**\n\nThe second reaction is a catalytic hydrogenation using Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂) in methanol (MeOH). This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   Two hydrogen atoms are added across the C=C double bond.\n\nThe change in the molecular formula is:\n*   Intermediate 1: C₇H₆F₃NO\n*   Add H₂: C₇H₆+₂F₃NO = C₇H₈F₃NO.\n*   The structure is now a saturated 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n*   The molecular formula for **Intermediate 2** is **C₇H₈F₃NO**.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of the Final Product**\n\nThe final step involves heating Intermediate 2 with 4 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 70 °C. These are conditions for the hydrolysis of a lactam (a cyclic amide).\n*   The amide bond within the bicyclic ring is cleaved by the addition of one molecule of water (H₂O).\n*   This opens the ring to form an amino acid derivative on a cyclopentane skeleton.\n\nThe change in the molecular formula is:\n*   Intermediate 2: C₇H₈F₃NO\n*   Add H₂O: C₇H₈+₂F₃NO₁+₁ = C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂.\n\nThe final product is a cyclopentane ring substituted with an amino group (-NH₂), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and a trifluoromethyl group (-CF₃).\n\nThe molecular formula of the final product is **C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂**.\n\n<<<C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂>>>"
