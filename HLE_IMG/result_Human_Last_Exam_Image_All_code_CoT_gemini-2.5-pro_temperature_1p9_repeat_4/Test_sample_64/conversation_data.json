    "Based on the visual evidence in the image sequence, I will deduce the biological process being shown.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n1.  **Analyze the image:** The image displays a sequence of three micrographs labeled L, M, and N. They show a filamentous biological structure, likely a fungal hypha, under magnification. The sequence appears to represent a process over time.\n2.  **Observe the key features:**\n    *   The structure is multicellular, with clear cross-walls (septa) dividing the cells.\n    *   In panel L, the hypha is mostly straight. An arrowhead points to a septum between the apical (tip) cell and the sub-apical cell.\n    *   In panel M, a small, hook-like outgrowth (indicated by the arrowhead) has started to form from the apical cell, near the septum, growing backward. This outgrowth causes the hypha to begin to bend.\n    *   In panel N, this hook-like structure has grown larger and is curving back towards the sub-apical cell. The bending of the entire hypha is more pronounced.\n3.  **Identify the process:** This specific formation of a backward-growing hyphal bridge at a septum during cell division is a well-known process in fungi. It is called **clamp connection formation**. This is a characteristic feature of fungi belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota. The purpose of the clamp connection is to ensure that when a cell divides, each new daughter cell receives a pair of different nuclei (a dikaryotic condition), which is crucial for their life cycle.\n4.  **Synthesize the conclusion:** The sequence L -> M -> N clearly illustrates the initiation and development of a clamp connection in a fungal hypha.\n\nTo present this conclusion, I will write a simple Python script that prints the explanation.\n\n```python\ndef explain_process():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the biological process depicted in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    process_name = \"Clamp connection formation in a fungal hypha\"\n    description = (\n        \"The image shows a time-lapse sequence (L, M, N) of a fungal hypha undergoing a specific type of cell division.\\n\"\n        \"This process is known as clamp connection formation, which is characteristic of Basidiomycete fungi.\\n\\n\"\n        \"Here is a step-by-step description:\\n\"\n        \"1.

In panel M, a small hook-like structure, the 'clamp,' begins to grow backward from the terminal cell near the septum.\\n\"\n        \"3. In panel N, the clamp has grown larger and is curving back to fuse with the subterminal cell.\\n\\n\"\n        \"This intricate process ensures that during mitosis, the two newly formed nuclei are properly distributed between the new cells, maintaining the dikaryotic (n+n) state of the hypha.\"\n    )\n    print(f\"The process depicted is: {process_name}\\n\")\n    print(description)\n\nexplain_process()\n```\n<<<The process being depicted in the image is clamp connection formation in a fungal hypha.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
