The S100B protein binds to the V and C1 domains of the RAGE receptor. It can be used as a prognostic marker because its over-expression directly activates pathways (like NFÎºB) that cause neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration, thus indicating the likely progression and severity of the neurological disorder.
