    "This image displays the emission spectrum of an element. To identify the element, we need to analyze the pattern of the spectral lines.\n\n**My Plan:**\n1.  Analyze the characteristics of the spectrum shown in the image. The spectrum is characterized by a very large number of distinct lines spanning the entire visible range, from violet/blue to red. The lines are particularly dense in the blue-green region.\n2.  Compare these characteristics with the known emission spectra of different elements.\n    *   Simple elements like Hydrogen or Helium have very simple spectra with only a few lines.\n    *   Elements like Mercury or Neon have more lines, but they are typically very distinct, bright, and well-separated in specific colors (e.g., Neon is famously red-orange).\n    *   Heavier elements, particularly transition metals like Iron, have extremely complex spectra with thousands of emission lines due to their complicated electron shell structures.\n3.  The observed spectrum's high complexity and the dense packing of lines across all colors are hallmarks of the Iron (Fe) spectrum.\n4.  Write a Python script that encapsulates this reasoning to identify the element. To satisfy the prompt's requirement for an \"equation,\" I will create a symbolic representation of the evidence leading to the conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef identify_element_from_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies an element by comparing the characteristics of its\n    emission spectrum with a knowledge base of known spectra.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
