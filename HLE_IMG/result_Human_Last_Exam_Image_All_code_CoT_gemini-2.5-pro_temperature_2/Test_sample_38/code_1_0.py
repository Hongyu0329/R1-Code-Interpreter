    """
    This function determines which tiling will have the lowest Poisson's ratio
    by analyzing the provided geometric progression.

    Reasoning:
    1.  The mechanical properties of a honeycomb, like Poisson's ratio, are
        determined by its cell geometry.
    2.  The image shows a sequence of tilings where the cell shape changes from
        a "re-entrant" (concave) geometry on the left to a convex one on the right.
    3.  Re-entrant structures are known to be auxetic, meaning they exhibit a
        negative Poisson's ratio. The more re-entrant the structure, the lower
        (more negative) its Poisson's ratio.
    4.  The tiling labeled (0, 1) is the most re-entrant shape in the series.
    5.  Therefore, the tiling at (0, 1) will have the lowest Poisson's ratio.
