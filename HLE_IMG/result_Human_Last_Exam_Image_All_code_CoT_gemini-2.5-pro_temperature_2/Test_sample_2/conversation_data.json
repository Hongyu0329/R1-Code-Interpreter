    "My plan is to analyze the time complexity of the provided sorting algorithm by establishing and solving its recurrence relation for the worst-case scenario.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Algorithm's Structure**: I will break down the `sort(a, n)` function into its constituent operations: base case, recursive calls, and constant-time operations (comparison, swap).\n2.  **Determine the Worst-Case Scenario**: The worst-case complexity occurs when the maximum number of operations are performed. In this algorithm, this happens when the `if` condition is always true, triggering a second recursive call at each step.\n3.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation**: Based on the worst-case analysis, I will define a recurrence relation `T(n)` that describes the algorithm's running time as a function of the input size `n`.\n4.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation**: I will solve the recurrence relation by expanding it to identify the pattern and derive a closed-form expression. This expression will reveal the asymptotic time complexity.\n5.  **Present the Derivation**: I will use a Python script to print a step-by-step explanation of the analysis, including the derivation and solving of the recurrence relation, showing the numerical coefficients as the relation is expanded.\n\nThis will lead to the conclusion about the algorithm's worst-case time complexity.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and explains the time complexity of the given recursive sorting algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"### Time Complexity Analysis ###\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe given sorting algorithm is recursive.
