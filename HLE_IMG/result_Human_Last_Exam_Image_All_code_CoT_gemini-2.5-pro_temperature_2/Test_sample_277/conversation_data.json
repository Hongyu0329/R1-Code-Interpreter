    "An analysis of the problem shows that the provided image is completely black. There are no chemical structures or molecules shown for comparison. The question asks to identify the type of isomerism between \"the molecules mentioned above.\" Since there are no molecules, their relationship cannot be determined. It is impossible to ascertain if they are conformers, constitutional isomers, stereoisomers, or identical. Therefore, none of the specific options (a, b, c, d) are applicable, leaving (e) as the only logical choice due to the missing information.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_isomer_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided problem and determines the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the input provided by the user.\n    # The user has provided a question about molecules in an image.\n    image_is_blank = True\n\n    # Step 2: Evaluate the condition.\n    # The image is completely black, so no molecules are visible.\n    if image_is_blank:\n        # Step 3: Formulate a conclusion based on the missing information.\n        # Since no molecules are shown, their relationship cannot be determined.\n        # We cannot check for molecular formula, connectivity, or spatial arrangement.\n        reasoning = \"\"\"The provided image is blank.
