    "To solve this, we need to find the order of rotational symmetry for the given tiling pattern. The order of rotational symmetry is the number of times the pattern looks identical during a full 360-degree rotation around a center point.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify a Center of Rotation:** We'll look for a point in the pattern that can serve as a center for rotation. The center of one of the dark blue regular hexagons is a prominent and convenient choice.\n2.  **Determine the Smallest Angle of Rotation:** We will determine the smallest angle by which we can rotate the entire pattern around this center point so that it aligns perfectly with its original position.\n3.  **Calculate the Order of Symmetry:** The order is calculated by dividing 360 degrees by this smallest angle.\n\nLet's execute this plan using a Python script that explains the process and prints the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef find_rotational_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the rotational symmetry of the given tiling.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To find the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we must identify a point of rotation and the smallest angle of rotation that leaves the pattern unchanged.\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify a center of rotation\n    print(\"\\nLet's choose the center of one of the dark blue, regular hexagons as the point of rotation.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the smallest angle of rotation\n    print(\"A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides and angles.
