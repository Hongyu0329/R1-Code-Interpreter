    "Answering this question requires knowledge of crystallography and the ability to recognize crystallographic patterns. Let's break down the problem by identifying the patterns for common views of a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice and matching them to the given images.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the theoretical projection patterns:** We will determine the expected 2D patterns when viewing an FCC crystal along its principal directions: [100], [110], and [111].\n2.  **Analyze the patterns in the images:** We'll examine each image (A, B, C, and D) to identify the crystallographic pattern it represents.\n3.  **Match and eliminate:** By comparing the theoretical patterns with the images, we can identify which image corresponds to which view. The goal is to find the one that matches the [110] view.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Theoretical FCC Projection Patterns:**\n    *   **View along [100]:** Projecting the FCC unit cell onto a plane perpendicular to the [100] axis (the (100) plane) results in a **face-centered square** pattern. You see atoms at the corners of a square, at the midpoint of each edge, and one in the very center.\n    *   **View along [110]:** Projecting onto the (110) plane results in a **centered rectangular** pattern. You see atoms at the corners of a rectangle and one atom in the center of the rectangle. The aspect ratio of this rectangle is âˆš2 : 1.\n    *   **View along [111]:** Projecting onto the (111) plane reveals the hexagonal arrangement of the close-packed planes, resulting in a **hexagonal** pattern.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Images:**\n    *   **Image C:** This image clearly shows a **hexagonal** arrangement of atoms. This pattern corresponds to the FCC **[111]** view.\n    *   **Image D:** This image displays a rectangular grid of atoms. If we define a rectangle by the corner atoms, we see additional atoms at the center of each edge and one in the center of the rectangle. This is a **face-centered rectangular** pattern. This corresponds to the FCC **[100]** view (the rectangular shape is just a stretched square).\n    *   **Image A:** This image shows atoms arranged in a simple rectangular grid (2 columns, 4 rows). This is a simple rectangular lattice, which does not correspond to any standard projection of an FCC structure. It's more representative of a simple cubic lattice viewed along [100].\n    *   **Image B:** This image appears more complex and less ordered at first glance than the others. However, we are looking for a **centered rectangular** pattern. Having eliminated the other clear patterns (FCC [100] and FCC [111]), we can deduce by elimination that image B must represent the FCC [110] view. The visual complexity might arise from showing atoms at different depths within the projected cell or a particular choice of the bounding box.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the process of elimination by identifying the canonical crystallographic projections:\n*   A is not a standard FCC projection.\n*   C is the FCC [111] view.\n*   D is the FCC [100] view.\n*   Therefore, **B** must represent the FCC [110] view.\n\n```python\n# The reasoning is based on crystallographic knowledge and pattern recognition.\n# The expected pattern for an FCC crystal viewed along the [110] direction\n# is a centered rectangle.\n# Let's analyze the options:\n# A: Shows a simple rectangular lattice. This is not a centered rectangle.\n# C: Shows a hexagonal lattice, which corresponds to the FCC [111] view.\n# D: Shows a face-centered rectangular lattice, which corresponds to the FCC [100] view.\n# B: By elimination, this must be the pattern for the FCC [110] view,\n#    even if it is not drawn clearly as a simple centered rectangle.\n\nanswer = 'B'\nprint(f\"{answer}.\")\n```\n<<<B>>>"
