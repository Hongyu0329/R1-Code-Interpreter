# The reasoning is based on crystallographic knowledge and pattern recognition.
# The expected pattern for an FCC crystal viewed along the [110] direction
# is a centered rectangle.
# Let's analyze the options:
# A: Shows a simple rectangular lattice. This is not a centered rectangle.
# C: Shows a hexagonal lattice, which corresponds to the FCC [111] view.
# D: Shows a face-centered rectangular lattice, which corresponds to the FCC [100] view.
# B: By elimination, this must be the pattern for the FCC [110] view,
#    even if it is not drawn clearly as a simple centered rectangle.
