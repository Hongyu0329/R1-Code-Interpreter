# Step 1: Define known values and derive the radius of the white circle (r_w)
r_y = 0.5  # Radius of yellow circle in cm
# From the geometric relationship r_w = 4 * r_y
r_w = 4 * r_y
print(f"The radius of a white circle (r_w) is derived from r_w = 4 * r_y")
print(f"r_w = 4 * {r_y} = {r_w} cm")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 2: Determine the x-coordinate of the right-most white circle's center
# Based on the staggered grid layout, the x-centers of the middle row circles are at 2*r_w, 4*r_w, and 6*r_w
x_coord_target = 6 * r_w
print(f"The x-coordinate of the center is 6 * r_w")
print(f"x = 6 * {r_w} = {x_coord_target} cm")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 3: Determine the y-coordinate of the right-most white circle's center
# 3a: Calculate y_bot, the y-coordinate for the bottom row centers
# From the equation: (y_bot - 0.5)^2 = 4
# We take the positive root since y_bot > 0.5
y_bot_minus_0_5 = math.sqrt(4)
y_bot = y_bot_minus_0_5 + 0.5
print(f"The y-coordinate of the bottom row circles (y_bot) is found by solving (y_bot - 0.5)^2 = 4")
print(f"y_bot = sqrt(4) + 0.5 = {y_bot} cm")
print("-" * 20)

# 3b: State the vertical distance between row centerlines, d_y
# This value comes from solving the geometric constraints of the top half of the image.
d_y = 4.0
print(f"The vertical distance between the centerlines of the rows (d_y) is {d_y} cm.")
print("-" * 20)

# 3c: Calculate y_mid, the y-coordinate for the middle row centers
y_mid = y_bot + d_y
print(f"The y-coordinate of the target circle (y_mid) is y_bot + d_y")
print(f"y_mid = {y_bot} + {d_y} = {y_mid} cm")
print("-" * 20)

# Final Answer
print(f"The center of the right-most white circle is at x:y = {x_coord_target}:{y_mid}")
