    "To find the value of the current I, we will use the node voltage analysis method.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the nodes:** We first identify the key nodes in the circuit.\n    *   Let the bottom wire connected to the ground be the reference node (0V).\n    *   The battery's negative terminal is at this reference node.\n    *   The battery's positive terminal is connected to the middle wire, so this wire is at a potential of 41V. This is the node from which the current `I` flows.\n    *   Let's denote the voltage of the top wire as `V_A`.\n    *   Let's denote the voltage at the junction of resistors R14, R11, and R29 as `V_B`.\n\n2.  **Apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL):** We will write KCL equations for the unknown nodes `V_A` and `V_B`. KCL states that the sum of currents entering a node must equal the sum of currents leaving it.\n\n3.  **Solve the equations:** We will get a system of two linear equations with two variables (`V_A` and `V_B`). We will solve this system to find the values of `V_A` and `V_B`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Current I:** The current `I` is the total current leaving the 41V source. It splits into three branches through resistors R76, R8, and R14. We can find `I` by summing the currents through these three resistors using Ohm's law.\n    `I = (41 - V_A)/76 + (41 - V_A)/8 + (41 - V_B)/14`\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final value of I.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# --- Define component values from the circuit diagram ---\nR76 = 76\nR8 = 8\nR14 = 14\nR11 = 11\nR29 = 29\nV_s = 41\n\n# --- Set up the system of linear equations using KCL for nodal analysis ---\n# The circuit has two unknown node voltages: VA (top wire) and VB (right junction).\n# Equation for node A (sum of currents leaving = 0):\n# (VA - V_s)/R76 + (VA - V_s)/R8 + (VA - VB)/R11 = 0\n# Rearranged: VA*(1/R76 + 1/R8 + 1/R11) - VB*(1/R11) = V_s*(1/R76 + 1/R8)\n#\n# Equation for node B (sum of currents leaving = 0):\n# (VB - VA)/R11 + (VB - V_s)/R14 + (VB - 0)/R29 = 0\n# Rearranged: -VA*(1/R11) + VB*(1/R11 + 1/R14 + 1/R29) = V_s/R14\n\n# --- Create the matrix (M) and vector (C) for the system M * v = C ---\n# v = [VA, VB]\nc11 = 1/R76 + 1/R8 + 1/R11\nc12 = -1/R11\nc21 = -1/R11\nc22 = 1/R11 + 1/R14 + 1/R29\n\nM = np.array([[c11, c12],\n              [c21, c22]])\n\nC = np.array([V_s * (1/R76 + 1/R8),\n              V_s / R14])\n\n# --- Solve for the node voltages VA and VB ---\ntry:\n    voltages = np.linalg.solve(M, C)\n    V_A = voltages[0]\n    V_B = voltages[1]\n\n    # --- Calculate the total current I leaving the source ---\n    # I = current through R76 + current through R8 + current through R14\n    I_R76 = (V_s - V_A) / R76\n    I_R8 = (V_s - V_A) / R8\n    I_R14 = (V_s - V_B) / R14\n    I_total = I_R76 + I_R8 + I_R14\n\n    # --- Print the results and the final equation with values ---\n    print(f\"Solving the circuit using nodal analysis gives the node voltages:\")\n    print(f\"V_A (top wire voltage) = {V_A:.4f} V\")\n    print(f\"V_B (junction voltage) = {V_B:.4f} V\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The total current I is the sum of the currents leaving the 41V source.\")\n    print(\"The formula for I is: I = (V_s - V_A)/R76 + (V_s - V_A)/R8 + (V_s - V_B)/R14\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Substituting the values into the equation:\")\n    print(f\"I = ({V_s} - {V_A:.4f}) / {R76} + ({V_s} - {V_A:.4f}) / {R8} + ({V_s} - {V_B:.4f}) / {R14}\")\n    print(f\"I = {I_R76:.4f} A + {I_R8:.4f} A + {I_R14:.4f} A\")\n    print(f\"I = {I_total:.4f} A\")\n\nexcept np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n    print(\"The system of equations cannot be solved.
