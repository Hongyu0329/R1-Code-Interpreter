def find_new_alkene_location():
  """
  This function determines the location of the new double bond in the product of the Heck reaction.

  In an intramolecular Heck reaction, the process typically follows these steps:
  1. Oxidative addition of the palladium catalyst to the C-Br bond (at C9).
  2. Carbopalladation: The Pd-bound C9 adds to the C4=C5 double bond. The product image shows a new C5-C9 bond, so the palladium is now attached to C4.
  3. Beta-hydride elimination: A hydrogen from a carbon adjacent to the palladium-bearing carbon (C4) is removed to form a new double bond. The adjacent carbons are C3 and C5.
  4. C5 is a quaternary carbon in the intermediate (bonded to C4, C6, C7, C9), so it has no hydrogens to eliminate.
  5. Therefore, a hydrogen must be eliminated from C3, creating a new double bond between C3 and C4.
