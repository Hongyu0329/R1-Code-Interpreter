    "This image displays a large, ornate piece of scientific equipment from the 18th century. Let's analyze its components to determine its function:\n\n1.  **Crank Mechanism:** On the left, there is a large wheel with four wooden handles, designed to be turned by hand. This indicates the machine is manually operated.\n2.  **Main Body:** The crank connects to a large, embellished casing, which likely houses the primary mechanism.\n3.  **Horizontal Cylinder/Conductor:** A large, polished brass cylinder extends from the main body.\n4.  **Spherical Collector:** At the far right, there is a prominent brass sphere mounted on an insulated stand. This sphere is a classic shape for a \"prime conductor\" in electrical experiments, designed to accumulate a large amount of static charge.\n\nBased on these features, the machine is an **electrostatic generator**. Turning the crank would have rotated a glass globe or cylinder inside the casing. This globe would rub against a pad (e.g., of leather or silk), generating static electricity through friction. The charge would then be collected by a metal comb and transferred to the prime conductor (the sphere) for use in experiments and demonstrations of static electricity.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n*   **A. Steam engine:** A steam engine uses heat and steam pressure for power and looks very different (requiring a boiler, firebox, and piston).\n*   **C. Brass telescope:** A telescope is an optical instrument with lenses or mirrors for viewing distant objects. This device lacks those components.\n*   **D. Vacuum pump:** While early vacuum pumps also had cranks and cylinders, their purpose was to evacuate a container (like a glass bell jar), and they typically look different. This machine's design, especially the isolated spherical conductor, is strongly characteristic of electrostatic equipment.\n*   **E. Orrery:** An orrery is a mechanical model of the solar system and would feature multiple spheres representing planets orbiting a central sun.\n\nTherefore, the object is an electrostatic generator.\n\n<<<B>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
