    "I have identified the plant in the image as *Geniostoma helleri*. My plan is to use python to print the name of the island where this plant is endemic.\n\n1.  **Identify the plant**: The plant is distinguished by its dark green, elliptical leaves arranged in whorls, and most notably by the striking network of pale, sunken veins, creating a \"quilted\" or \"net-veined\" appearance. This unique foliage is a key characteristic of *Geniostoma helleri*.\n\n2.  **Determine its origin**: I will find out the native habitat of *Geniostoma helleri*. Research indicates that this species is endemic, meaning it is found exclusively in one specific geographic location.\n\n3.  **Find the island**: *Geniostoma helleri* is native to the Hawaiian Islands, and more specifically, it is endemic to the island of Kauaʻi.\n\n4.  **Output the answer**: I will use a simple Python script to print the name of the island.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the plant in the image and determines the island to which it is endemic.\n  The plant is Geniostoma helleri, which has a very distinct reticulated leaf venation.\n  This species is endemic to one of the Hawaiian Islands.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The name of the island to which Geniostoma helleri is endemic.\n  island_name = \"Kauaʻi\"\n  print(island_name)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Kauaʻi>>>"
