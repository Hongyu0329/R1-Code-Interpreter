    # Step 1: Qualitative Analysis of the Traces
    # Observation 1: The EEG channels (L-FC, L-SC, R-SC) show an abrupt onset of
    # high-amplitude, repetitive, spike-like discharges. The activity is present
    # in all three cortical channels, indicating a generalized seizure.
    #
    # Observation 2: The EMG channel shows brief bursts of electrical activity
    # that occur simultaneously with the spikes seen in the EEG channels.
    # This indicates that the cortical discharges are causing brief, involuntary
    # muscle contractions, known as myoclonic jerks.

    print("Analysis of EEG/EMG Trace:")
    print("- The EEG shows generalized, high-amplitude spike discharges.")
    print("- The EMG shows brief bursts of muscle activity that are time-locked with the EEG spikes.")
    print("- This correlation signifies that the abnormal brain activity is causing short, shock-like muscle jerks.\n")

    # Step 2: Quantitative Analysis (Frequency Estimation)
    # Using the 1-second time scale provided, we can estimate the frequency of the events.
    # By counting the number of spike-and-wave complexes in a 1-second interval during the seizure...
    num_spikes = 7  # Approximate number of spikes counted in a 1-second window.
    time_interval_s = 1

    # The equation for frequency is: Frequency = Number of Events / Time
    frequency_hz = num_spikes / time_interval_s

    print("Quantitative Estimation:")
    print("Equation: Frequency = Number of Spikes / Time Interval")
    print(f"Calculation: Frequency = {num_spikes} spikes / {time_interval_s} s = {frequency_hz} Hz")
    print(f"The approximate frequency of the discharges is {frequency_hz} Hz.\n")


    # Step 3: Comparison with Seizure Classifications
    # A. Tonic Seizure: Characterized by sustained muscle stiffening. Not seen here.
    # B. Absence Seizure: Typically 3 Hz spike-wave discharges with minimal motor signs. The frequency is higher and motor signs are prominent. Not a match.
    # C. Myoclonic Seizure: Characterized by brief, shock-like muscle jerks correlated with EEG polyspike/spike-and-wave discharges. This is a perfect match for our observations.
    # D. Febrile seizure: A clinical condition (seizure with fever), not a classification based on EEG morphology.
    # E. Clonic Seizure: Involves more rhythmic and prolonged jerking than the brief bursts seen here.
    # F. Tonic-clonic seizures: Involve a tonic phase (stiffening) followed by a clonic phase (jerking). This two-phase pattern is absent.

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The combination of generalized spike discharges on the EEG and time-locked, brief muscle jerks on the EMG is the classic presentation of a Myoclonic Seizure.")
    print("The correct choice is C.")

# It is commented out to not interfere with the python script's output in a standard execution environment.
# For this specific task, the final answer needs to be presented at the very end.
