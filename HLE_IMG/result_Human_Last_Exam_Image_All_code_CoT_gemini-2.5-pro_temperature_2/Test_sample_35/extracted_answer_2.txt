The S100B protein binds to the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE), specifically its extracellular domain composed of the V, C1, and C2 subdomains. S100B can be used as a prognostic marker. This is because its expression level is directly linked to the progression of the disease pathology; as shown in the pathway, S100B binding to RAGE activates signaling cascades (JNK/JUN, NFÎºB) that cause neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Therefore, measuring S100B levels can help predict the future severity and course of the neurological disorder.
