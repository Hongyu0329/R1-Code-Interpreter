    # Its center is at (r_w, r_w).
    # This white circle touches the first yellow circle with center (4, 0.5).
    # The distance between their centers is r_w + r_y.
    # (x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2 = (r1+r2)^2
    # (4 - r_w)^2 + (0.5 - r_w)^2 = (r_w + 0.5)^2
    # 16 - 8*r_w + r_w^2 + 0.25 - r_w + r_w^2 = r_w^2 + r_w + 0.25
    # 16.25 - 9*r_w + 2*r_w^2 = r_w^2 + r_w + 0.25
    # r_w^2 - 10*r_w + 16 = 0
    # We solve this quadratic equation for r_w.
    # Factoring: (r_w - 2) * (r_w - 8) = 0.
    # Possible solutions for r_w are 2.0 or 8.0.
    
    # Let's test r_w = 8.0.
    # The first white circle center is (8, 8). It touches the first yellow circle (center x_y1, 0.5).
    # (x_y1 - 8)^2 + (0.5 - 8)^2 = (8 + 0.5)^2 => (x_y1-8)^2 + 56.25 = 72.25 => (x_y1-8)^2 = 16 => x_y1=12.
    # The first yellow circle center would be at (12, 0.5), which contradicts the given (4, 0.5).
    # So, r_w must be 2.0.

    # model is impossible, gaps MUST exist between rows.

    # Q2: Is there any gap between white circles in the first row and second row?
    # YES. If we assume a white circle from the top row touches a white circle from the middle row, it forces a certain
