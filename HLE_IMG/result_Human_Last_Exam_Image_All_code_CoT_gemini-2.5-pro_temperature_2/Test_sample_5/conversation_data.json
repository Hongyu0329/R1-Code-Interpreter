    "This is a fun one! Based on the sheet music, I can identify the piece. Here is my thinking process:\n\n1.  **Initial Analysis:** I first look at the key signature (none, suggesting C major or A minor), the time signature (4/4), and the tempo marking (quarter note = 80).\n2.  **Opening Section (Measures 1-2):** The piece begins quietly (*p*). The left hand plays a recognizable chord progression starting with A minor, then G major, C major, F major, etc. The right hand plays a slow, ascending melody: G, A, B, C, D, E, F, E. This slow, ominous buildup is a major clue.\n3.  **The Shift (Measure 3):** There is a sudden, dramatic shift. The dynamic changes to *forte* (*f*), and the texture becomes dense and fast, filled with driving sixteenth notes. This radical change from a quiet, simple opening to a virtuosic, high-energy section is the most distinctive feature of the piece.\n4.  **Harmonic Language:** The section starting at measure 3 is highly chromatic, with many sharps (C#, G#, F#), indicating a departure from the simple opening key. This level of chromaticism and technical demand is characteristic of epic, climactic music.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The combination of the slow, choral-like opening in A minor, the specific melodic line, and the abrupt explosion into a fast, rhythmically intense, and chromatic section strongly points to one very famous piece of video game music: \"One-Winged Angel\" from *Final Fantasy VII*, composed by the brilliant Nobuo Uematsu. The sheet music provided is from a piano arrangement, likely the one from the official *Piano Collections Final Fantasy VII* album.\n\nHere is the Python code to print the answer for you.\n\n```python\ndef identify_music():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the name of the musical piece\n  based on the analysis of the provided sheet music.\n  \"\"\"\n  title = \"One-Winged Angel\"\n  source = \"Final Fantasy VII\"\n  composer = \"Nobuo Uematsu\"\n  \n  print(f\"Based on the musical excerpt, the piece is:\")\n  print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n  print(f\"Source: {source}\")\n  print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nidentify_music()\n```\n<<<One-Winged Angel>>>"
