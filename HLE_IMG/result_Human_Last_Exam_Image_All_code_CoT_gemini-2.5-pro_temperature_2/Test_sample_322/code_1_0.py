def solve_vortex_puzzle():
    """
    Solves the vortex trajectory puzzle by analyzing each of the 16 plots.

    The logic for identifying the unique vortex is as follows:
    - Uppercase (B, G, R): The unique vortex has twice the strength. Its trajectory is a simple, large orbit that organizes the other two, resulting in regular motion.
    - Lowercase (b, g, r): The unique vortex has half the strength. Its trajectory is either a tight inner loop (regular motion) or chaotic (if the whole system is chaotic).

    Analysis by plot number:
    1: g (weak, inner spiral)
    2: b (weak, inner spiral)
    3: g (weak, chaotic system, green is the odd one out)
    4: B (strong, outer simple orbit)
    5: r (weak, inner loop)
    6: g (weak, inner spiral)
    7: r (weak, chaotic system, red is the odd one out)
    8: R (strong, outer simple orbit)
    9: g (weak, inner loop)
    10: b (weak, inner spiral)
    11: b (weak, chaotic system, blue is the odd one out)
    12: B (strong, outer simple orbit)
    13: b (weak, inner loop)
    14: r (weak, inner loop)
    15: g (weak, chaotic system, green is central/confined)
    16: b (weak, inner spiral)
