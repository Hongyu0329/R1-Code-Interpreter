    Analyzes the dataset to determine potential instrumental variables for y.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. An instrumental variable (IV) must be relevant (correlated with the endogenous variable)
       and exogenous (not caused by the outcome and uncorrelated with the model error).
    2. x1 and x2 are defined as functions of y (x1=y^2, x2=3y), so they are endogenous and
       technically invalid as IVs. However, they appear in all answer choices.
    3. We evaluate the exogeneity candidates (x3, x4, x5, x6) based on relevance,
       by calculating their correlation with y.
    4. Variables with near-zero correlation (x4, x6) are irrelevant (weak instruments)
       and should be excluded.
    5. Based on this, we analyze the remaining answer choices.
