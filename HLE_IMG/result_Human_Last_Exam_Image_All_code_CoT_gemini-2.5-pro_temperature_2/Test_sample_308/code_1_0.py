    Solves the roller drive matching puzzle.

    The logic is as follows:
    - The number of lobes on the driving roller (green, left) corresponds to the
      number of periodic oscillations in the displacement plot.
    - The shape and amplitude of the oscillations are determined by the ratio of
      the radii of the two rollers at their contact point (r_driver / r_driven).
