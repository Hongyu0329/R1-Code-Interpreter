    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the molecular formula of the final product:\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material**: First, we must determine the molecular formula of the starting reactant. The structure is identified as `5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-(4-methoxybenzyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one`. Let's count the atoms:\n    *   Core structure (`C7H5F3NO`):\n        *   Bicyclic skeleton carbons: `C1`, `C3`, `C4`, `C5`, `C6`, `C7` = 6 Carbons.\n        *   `CF3` group: 1 Carbon, 3 Fluorine.\n        *   Total Carbons in core: 7.\n        *   Hydrogens on core: `C1(H)`, `C4(H)`, `C6(H)`, `C7(H2)` = 5 Hydrogens.\n        *   Nitrogen: 1 (`N2`).\n        *   Oxygen: 1 (`C3=O`).\n    *   PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) group (`C8H9O`): This group is `CH2-C6H4-OCH3`.\n        *   `CH2`: 1 Carbon, 2 Hydrogens.\n        *   `C6H4`: 6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens.\n        *   `OCH3`: 1 Carbon, 3 Hydrogens, 1 Oxygen.\n        *   Total for PMB: 8 Carbons, 9 Hydrogens, 1 Oxygen.\n    *   Combining these parts, the total molecular formula for the starting material is `C(7+8) H(5+9) F3 N1 O(1+1) = C15H14F3NO2`.\n\n2.  **Analyze Step 1: Deprotection (Starting Material → Intermediate 1)**\n    *   Reagents: CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate). This is a standard reagent for the oxidative cleavage of a PMB protecting group from a nitrogen atom.\n    *   The `N-PMB` bond is cleaved, and the nitrogen becomes `N-H`. This means the `C8H9O` PMB group is removed, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen.\n    *   Net change: Remove `C8H9`, `O` and add `H`, which simplifies to removing `C8H8O`.\n    *   Formula change: `(C - 8), (H - 8), (O - 1)`.\n\n3.  **Analyze Step 2: Hydrogenation (Intermediate 1 → Intermediate 2)**\n    *   Reagents: Pd/C, H2. This is a standard catalytic hydrogenation reaction.\n    *   It will reduce the `C=C` double bond within the bicyclic system to a `C-C` single bond. This process adds two hydrogen atoms (`H2`).\n    *   Formula change: `(H + 2)`.\n\n4.  **Analyze Step 3: Hydrolysis (Intermediate 2 → Product)**\n    *   Reagents: 4 N HCl, 70 °C. These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a lactam (a cyclic amide).\n    *   The amide bond `(-CO-N-)` in the ring is cleaved by the addition of one molecule of water (`H2O`), forming a carboxylic acid `(-COOH)` and an amine `(-NH2)`.\n    *   Formula change: `(H + 2), (O + 1)`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Formula**: We will now use a script to apply these changes sequentially to calculate the final molecular formula.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product through a three-step reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 0: Define the molecular formula of the starting material\n    # C15H14F3NO2\n    formula = {'C': 15, 'H': 14, 'F': 3, 'N': 1, 'O': 2}\n    \n    print(\"This script calculates the molecular formula of the final product in the reaction sequence.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    def format_formula(f):\n        # Format the dictionary into a string, e.g., C15H14F3NO2\n        # Order: C, H, then alphabetically for the rest\n        parts = []\n        if 'C' in f and f['C'] > 0:\n            parts.append(f\"C{f['C'] if f['C'] > 1 else ''}\")\n        if 'H' in f and f['H'] > 0:\n            parts.append(f\"H{f['H'] if f['H'] > 1 else ''}\")\n        \n        # Sort remaining keys alphabetically\n        other_keys = sorted([k for k in f.keys() if k not in ['C', 'H']])\n        \n        for key in other_keys:\n            if f[key] > 0:\n                parts.append(f\"{key}{f[key] if f[key] > 1 else ''}\")\n        return \"\".join(parts)\n\n    print(f\"Step 0: Starting Material Formula: {format_formula(formula)}\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Store initial counts for the final equation\n    initial_counts = formula.copy()\n    \n    # Step 1: Deprotection with CAN\n    # Net change is removal of C8H8O\n    change1 = {'C': -8, 'H': -8, 'O': -1}\n    formula['C'] += change1.get('C', 0)\n    formula['H'] += change1.get('H', 0)\n    formula['O'] += change1.get('O', 0)\n    print(f\"Step 1: After deprotection (removal of C8H8O).\")\n    print(f\"         Intermediate 1 Formula: {format_formula(formula)}\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Hydrogenation with Pd/C, H2\n    # Net change is addition of H2\n    change2 = {'H': 2}\n    formula['H'] += change2.get('H', 0)\n    print(f\"Step 2: After hydrogenation (addition of H2).\")\n    print(f\"         Intermediate 2 Formula: {format_formula(formula)}\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Hydrolysis with HCl\n    # Net change is addition of H2O\n    change3 = {'H': 2, 'O': 1}\n    formula['H'] += change3.get('H', 0)\n    formula['O'] += change3.get('O', 0)\n    print(f\"Step 3: After lactam hydrolysis (addition of H2O).\")\n    print(f\"         Final Product Formula: {format_formula(formula)}\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Final calculation breakdown as requested\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Final Atom Count Calculation:\")\n    \n    final_C = initial_counts['C'] + change1.get('C', 0)\n    print(f\"Carbon (C):   {initial_counts['C']} {change1.get('C', 0):+d} = {final_C}\")\n    \n    final_H = initial_counts['H'] + change1.get('H', 0) + change2.get('H', 0) + change3.get('H', 0)\n    print(f\"Hydrogen (H): {initial_counts['H']} {change1.get('H', 0):+d} {change2.get('H', 0):+d} {change3.get('H', 0):+d} = {final_H}\")\n    \n    final_F = initial_counts['F']\n    print(f\"Fluorine (F): {initial_counts['F']} = {final_F}\")\n\n    final_N = initial_counts['N']\n    print(f\"Nitrogen (N): {initial_counts['N']} = {final_N}\")\n    \n    final_O = initial_counts['O'] + change1.get('O', 0) + change3.get('O', 0)\n    print(f\"Oxygen (O):   {initial_counts['O']} {change1.get('O', 0):+d} {change3.get('O', 0):+d} = {final_O}\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"The final molecular formula of the product is {format_formula(formula)}.\")\n\ncalculate_product_formula()\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>\n```"
