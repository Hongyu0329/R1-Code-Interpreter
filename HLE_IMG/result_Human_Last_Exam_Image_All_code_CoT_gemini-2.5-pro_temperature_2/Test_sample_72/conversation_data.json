    "Here is my plan to identify the pericyclic reactions involved in the transformation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Overall Transformation**: The reaction starts with hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene and, under photochemical conditions (`hv`), forms a complex tricyclic product. This suggests a multi-step process involving pericyclic reactions, which are often induced by light.\n2.  **Identify the First Reaction**: A plausible first step is the photoisomerization of one of the reactants. Aromatic compounds like benzene are known to photoisomerize to non-aromatic valence isomers. In this case, hexafluorobenzene likely isomerizes to its Dewar isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This reaction is classified as a **6π electrocyclization**. It converts a 6π electron conjugated system into a cyclic system with a new sigma bond. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, this process involving 4n+2 (where n=1) pi electrons is photochemically allowed.\n3.  **Identify the Second Reaction**: The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, possesses two double bonds. This intermediate then reacts with the double bond of cyclobutene. This second step involves the formation of a four-membered ring from two separate double bonds. This is a classic **[2π+2π] cycloaddition**. This process involves a total of 4π electrons (2π from Dewar benzene + 2π from cyclobutene). According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, this 4n (where n=1) pi electron process is also photochemically allowed.\n4.  **Conclusion**: Therefore, the transformation proceeds through two sequential photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions: a 6π electrocyclization followed by a [2π+2π] cycloaddition. I will now write a Python script to print this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction_mechanism():\n  \"\"\"\n  Identifies and describes the two pericyclic reactions in the given chemical transformation.\n  \"\"\"\n  reaction1_name = \"6π electrocyclization\"\n  reaction1_electrons = 6\n  reaction1_description = (\n      f\"The first step is a photochemical {reaction1_name}. \"\n      f\"Hexafluorobenzene, which has {reaction1_electrons}π electrons, undergoes a ring-closing reaction \"\n      \"to form its valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene.\"\n  )\n\n  reaction2_name = \"[2π+2π] cycloaddition\"\n  reaction2_electrons = 4\n  reaction2_description = (\n      f\"The second step is a photochemical {reaction2_name}. \"\n      \"The hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene intermediate reacts with cyclobutene. \"\n      \"This reaction involves a total of \"\n      f\"{reaction2_electrons}π electrons (2 from each molecule) to form a new four-membered ring.\"\n  )\n\n  print(\"The two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are:\")\n  print(\"\\n1.
