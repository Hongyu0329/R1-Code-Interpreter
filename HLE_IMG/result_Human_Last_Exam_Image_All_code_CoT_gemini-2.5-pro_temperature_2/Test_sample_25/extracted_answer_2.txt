The result is interpreted as 'Positive'. This is because the sample's amplification curve crossed the threshold of 125,000 RFU at cycle 30.8, which is before the assay cut-off of 40 cycles. A positive result indicates that the target genetic material was detected in the sample. The Ct value of 30.8 is considered relatively high, which suggests a low initial concentration of the target.
