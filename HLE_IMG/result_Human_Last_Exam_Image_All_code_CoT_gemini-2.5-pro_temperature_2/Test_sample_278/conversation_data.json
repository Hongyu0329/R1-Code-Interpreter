    "Based on my analysis of the image, the observed microorganism can be classified as a fungus, showing features characteristic of *Candida* species.\n\nThe image displays:\n*   **Morphology**: A combination of round-to-oval budding yeast cells and elongated filamentous structures known as pseudohyphae. This dimorphic presentation (both yeast and filamentous forms) is classic for *Candida*.\n*   **Microorganism Type**: Fungus (Yeast).\n*   **Staining**: The sample is likely stained with Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), which stains the carbohydrate-rich fungal cell walls a bright magenta/purple color, while the background tissue cells are counterstained blue/green.\n\nThe presence of both budding yeasts and pseudohyphae typically indicates active tissue invasion.\n\nThe following Python code summarizes this classification.\n\n```python\ndef classify_microorganism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Classifies the microorganism observed in the provided image.\n    \"\"\"\n    classification = {\n        \"Stain Appearance\": \"Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain, showing pink/purple fungal elements against a blue/green tissue background.\",\n        \"Microorganism Type\": \"Fungus (Yeast)\",\n        \"Morphological Features\": [\n            \"1. Budding yeast cells (round to oval shapes).\",\n            \"2. Pseudohyphae (chains of elongated yeast cells).\",\n        ],\n        \"Likely Identification\": \"Candida species (e.g., Candida albicans).\",\n        \"Interpretation\": \"The presence of both yeast and pseudohyphal forms suggests an active fungal infection with tissue invasion.\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Classification of Observed Microorganism\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    for key, value in classification.items():\n        if isinstance(value, list):\n            print(f\"{key}:\")\n            for item in value:\n                print(f\"  - {item}\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    classify_microorganism()\n```\n<<<The image displays a fungus, likely *Candida* species, characterized by the presence of both budding yeast forms and pseudohyphae, suggestive of an active infection.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Based on the image of a stain viewed under a light microscope, classify what is observed in terms of morphology and type of microorganism\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
