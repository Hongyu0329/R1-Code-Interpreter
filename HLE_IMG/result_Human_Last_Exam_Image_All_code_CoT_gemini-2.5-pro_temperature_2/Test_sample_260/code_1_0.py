    # Step 1: Analyze the context provided about the image.
    image_context = "The image imagines a lost small deity of the past, similar to the small deities tied to specific places (for example springs, or villages)."
    # This directly points to a core theme.
    theme1_analysis = "The description 'lost small deity' explicitly introduces the theme of forgotten or 'fading religious beliefs'."

    # Step 2: Analyze the visual elements of the image and the poem.
    visuals = "The image is hazy, aged, and features a ghostly, fading figure."
    poem_extract = "Velvet fades / like a photochromic lens."
    # The common concept here is fading and the passage of time.
    theme2_analysis = "Both the visuals (fading figure, aged photo look) and the poem ('Velvet fades') emphasize change, decay, and impermanence. This points to the theme of 'the transient, passing nature of existence'."

    # Step 3: Evaluate the options based on the analysis.
    options = {
        'A': 'Loss of memory and death',
        'B': 'The transient, passing nature of existence and the fading of religious beliefs',
        'C': 'Impermanence of material objects and memory loss',
        'D': 'Lost or obsolete technologies and the ghosts of the past',
        'E': 'the fading of old religious beliefs and earthly death'

        Comparing our findings with the options:
        - Option B aligns perfectly with our two main deductions. 'The fading of religious beliefs' is directly stated. 'The transient, passing nature of existence' is the broad, overarching theme that covers the fading, the ghostly mood, and the passage of time.
        - Other options are either too narrow (A, C, E) or focus on secondary aspects like technology (D), which is more of a medium for the theme rather than the core theme itself.
