def find_unknot_indices():
    """
    Analyzes the provided image of six knots and identifies which are isotopic to the unknot.

    The knots are indexed 1 through 6 from left to right.
    - K1 is the figure-eight knot (knotted).
    - K2 is a complex diagram of the unknot.
    - K3 is a simple 2-crossing diagram of the unknot.
    - K4 is another projection of the figure-eight knot (knotted).
    - K5 is another complex diagram of the unknot, simplified by Reidemeister moves.
    - K6 is the Stevedore knot (6_1) (knotted).

    This function returns a list of the indices corresponding to the unknots.
