# Step 1 & 2: Define given values and calculate the fundamental reactive power compensation.
# Active power transmitted by the inverter (P_inverter) in MW.
P_inverter = 254.97
# Net reactive power exported to the grid from the inverter station in MVar.
Q_export = 14.58
# Heuristic factor for inverter reactive power consumption (Q â‰ˆ 0.5 * P).
inverter_q_factor = 0.5

# Calculate the reactive power consumed by the inverter.
Q_inverter = inverter_q_factor * P_inverter

# The fundamental compensation must supply the inverter's need plus the exported amount.
Q_comp_fund = Q_inverter + Q_export

# Step 3: Calculate the reactive power compensation needed for harmonics.
# Harmonic distortion percentages.
h5_distortion_percent = 10
h3_distortion_percent = 5
total_harmonic_distortion_percent = h5_distortion_percent + h3_distortion_percent

# Calculate harmonic reactive power as a percentage of active power.
Q_harmonics = (total_harmonic_distortion_percent / 100) * P_inverter

# Step 4: Calculate the total required reactive power compensation.
# Total compensation is the sum of fundamental and harmonic requirements.
total_reactive_compensation = Q_comp_fund + Q_harmonics

# Step 5: Print the final results in a clear equation format.
