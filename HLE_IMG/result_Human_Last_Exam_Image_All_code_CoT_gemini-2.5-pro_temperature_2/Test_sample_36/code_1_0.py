    print("  - VVA has raw 'data' in its 'VA Sales List'.")
    print("  - By analyzing this data, they can create 'information' (e.g., qualified leads).")
    print("  - This leads to 'knowledge' (e.g., understanding the ideal customer profile).")
    print("  - Ultimately, this fosters 'wisdom' (e.g., strategic decisions on which markets to target).")

    print("    - Internalization (Explicit -> Tacit): Training new staff on these documented scripts and manuals so they can master the skills.")
    print("  - Verdict: Highly APPLICABLE for capturing and scaling the expertise of the sales team.\n")

    # Bloom's Taxonomy Evaluation
    print("Analysis of Bloom's Taxonomy:")
    print("  - This model outlines levels of individual learning (Remember, Understand, Apply, etc.).")
    print("  - It is an excellent framework for designing a sales *training program* for employees.")
