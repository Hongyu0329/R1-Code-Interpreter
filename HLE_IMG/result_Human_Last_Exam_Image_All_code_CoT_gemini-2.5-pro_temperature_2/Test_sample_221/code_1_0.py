# Step 1: Define the parameters m and n.
# Based on visual inspection of the path between adjacent pentagons on the polyhedron's surface,
# we move 5 steps, turn 60 degrees, and move 4 more steps.
# The problem also provides the hint that m > n.
m = 5
n = 4

# Step 2: Define the number of pentagonal faces (P).
# For all Goldberg polyhedra, the number of pentagonal faces is constant.
P = 12

# Step 3: Calculate the triangulation number (T).
# The formula is T = m^2 + m*n + n^2.
T = m**2 + m * n + n**2

# Step 4: Calculate the number of hexagonal faces (H).
# The formula is H = 10 * (T - 1).
H = 10 * (T - 1)

# Step 5: Print the steps and the final formatted answer.
