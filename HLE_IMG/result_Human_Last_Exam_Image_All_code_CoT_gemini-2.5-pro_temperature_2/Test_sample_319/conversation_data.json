    "Based on the visual evidence provided, I can identify the perceptual phenomenon in question. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The image contains two plots. The top plot is a spectrogram, showing the frequency of sound over time. The bottom plot is the corresponding waveform.\n2.  **Interpret the Plots:** The plots illustrate a continuous pure tone (represented by the horizontal line in the spectrogram and the initial sine wave) that is interrupted by a short burst of noise (the vertical blur in the spectrogram).\n3.  **Identify the Illusion:** The key to this problem lies in understanding the perceptual effect. When a sound is briefly interrupted by another sound (like noise), the human brain often perceives the original sound as continuing uninterrupted *through* the noise. This is a type of perceptual \"filling-in.\"\n4.  **Name the Phenomenon:** This auditory illusion is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion** or **Temporal Induction**.\n5.  **Final Output:** I will provide a simple Python script that prints the name of this phenomenon, as requested by the prompt instructions.\n\n```python\ndef solve_illusion_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the auditory illusion\n    depicted in the image.\n    \n    The image shows a spectrogram and waveform of a pure tone being\n    interrupted by a burst of noise. Listeners typically perceive the tone\n    as continuing through the noise, an effect which this function will name.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    phenomenon_name = \"Auditory Continuity Illusion\"\n    \n    print(f\"The name of the phenomenon shown in the image is: {phenomenon_name}\")\n\nsolve_illusion_puzzle()\n```\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion>>>"
