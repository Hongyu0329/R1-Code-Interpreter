    "This image shows a typical North Atlantic rocky shore community. The key indicator species is the Common Periwinkle, a type of sea snail. This snail, native to the northeastern Atlantic coasts of Europe, was introduced to North America in the 19th century and has become a dominant species on the Atlantic coast from Canada to Maryland. It is not found on the Pacific coast. In the photo, several individuals are visible, including the larger one with faint stripes and the smaller dark ones.\n\nTherefore, the presence of the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*, definitively places this photo on an Atlantic coast.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the species that indicates the photo was taken\n    on the Atlantic rather than Pacific coast and prints its scientific name.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The image contains several organisms common to rocky intertidal zones.\n    # The most definitive indicator species is the Common Periwinkle snail.\n    # This species (Littorina littorea) is abundant on the North American Atlantic coast\n    # but is not found on the Pacific coast.\n    scientific_name = \"Littorina littorea\"\n    print(f\"The scientific name of the indicator species is: {scientific_name}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
