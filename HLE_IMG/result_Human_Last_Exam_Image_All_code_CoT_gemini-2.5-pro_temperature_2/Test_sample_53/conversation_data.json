    "This is a famous scene from Greek mythology depicted on an Apulian red-figure vase. My plan is to analyze the iconography of the scene to identify the figures and the story being told.\n\n1.  **Analyze the main figure:** The figure driving the chariot is wearing distinctly non-Greek clothing: a patterned, long-sleeved garment and a Phrygian cap. This \"oriental\" or \"barbarian\" dress is characteristic of figures from the East, such as Trojans, Amazons, or in this case, Medea from Colchis.\n2.  **Analyze the chariot:** The chariot has large wings, indicating it is not an ordinary mortal's vehicle but a magical or divine one. This is a key attribute of the chariot given to Medea by her grandfather, the sun god Helios, for her escape.\n3.  **Analyze the other figures:** There is a figure lying dead or dying on the ground, having apparently been run over. Inside the chariot, next to the driver, is another figure, draped and seemingly lifeless. These are the children of Medea and Jason, whom she has murdered as an act of revenge.\n4.  **Synthesize the narrative:** The combination of a female figure in foreign dress, a winged chariot, and dead children points definitively to the climax of the story of Medea. After her husband Jason abandoned her for a new bride, Medea took a terrible revenge by killing the bride, her father, and her own two children by Jason. The vase depicts her escaping the scene of her crime (Corinth) in the magical chariot, taking the bodies of her children with her.\n\nTherefore, the main figure driving the chariot and leaving the scene is Medea. The question \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\" is slightly ambiguous, but it most logically refers to the primary occupant who is actively departing the scene, which is Medea.\n\n```python\ndef identify_figure():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the mythological figure in the provided image.\n    The image shows a scene on a Greek vase.\n    - A figure in a Phrygian cap is driving a winged chariot. This figure is Medea.\n    - The chariot is a magical one from her grandfather, the sun god Helios.\n    - In the chariot with her and on the ground are the bodies of her children, whom she has killed.\n    - She is leaving the scene of her revenge in Corinth.\n\n    The question \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\" refers to the main occupant of the chariot who is departing from the scene on the ground.\n    \"\"\"\n    figure_name = \"Medea\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"The primary figure driving the winged chariot is Medea. \"\n        \"She is portrayed escaping from Corinth after murdering her children to exact revenge on her unfaithful husband, Jason. \"\n        \"Her foreign dress (Phrygian cap) and the magical winged chariot are key identifiers for this mythological scene.\"\n    )\n\n    print(f\"The figure leaving the scene in the chariot is: {figure_name}\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Details ---\")\n    print(explanation)\n\nidentify_figure()\n```\n<<<Medea>>>"
