# Molecular formula calculation for product A

# Step 1: Define the molecular formula of the starting material, Compound 1.
# Compound 1: methyl 1-oxoindane-2-carboxylate
# C9H8O (indanone) + COOMe -> C11H10O3
compound_1 = {'C': 11, 'H': 10, 'O': 3}

# Step 2: Define the changes due to the reaction sequence.
# The reaction is an alkylation followed by saponification and decarboxylation.

# Alkylation: A benzyl group (C7H7) from benzyl bromide replaces a hydrogen atom at the C2 position.
atoms_to_add_alkylation = {'C': 7, 'H': 7}
atoms_to_remove_alkylation = {'H': 1}

# Saponification and Decarboxylation: The methyl ester group (-COOMe or C2H3O2) is replaced by a hydrogen atom.
atoms_to_remove_decarboxylation = {'C': 2, 'H': 3, 'O': 2}
atoms_to_add_decarboxylation = {'H': 1}

# Step 3: Calculate the molecular formula of the final product A.
product_A = compound_1.copy()

# Apply alkylation changes
product_A['C'] += atoms_to_add_alkylation['C']
product_A['H'] += atoms_to_add_alkylation['H']
product_A['H'] -= atoms_to_remove_alkylation['H']

# Apply saponification and decarboxylation changes
product_A['C'] -= atoms_to_remove_decarboxylation['C']
product_A['H'] -= atoms_to_remove_decarboxylation['H']
product_A['O'] -= atoms_to_remove_decarboxylation['O']
product_A['H'] += atoms_to_add_decarboxylation['H']

# Step 4: Print the final molecular formula.
c_count = product_A['C']
h_count = product_A['H']
