    "This is a multi-component chemical reaction, specifically an example of an Orru three-component reaction, that synthesizes a complex heterocyclic molecule from simple starting materials.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction:**\n\n1.  **Reactants**: We have three key components:\n    *   **2-Aminopyridine**: The primary amine, which acts as a nucleophile.\n    *   **o-Phthalaldehyde (OPA)**: A dialdehyde, providing two electrophilic centers.\n    *   **Trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN)**: A source of the cyanide nucleophile (CN⁻). KF and water help to release the cyanide ion.\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism**: The reaction proceeds in several steps to form product A:\n    *   **Step 1: Imine Formation**: The amino group of 2-aminopyridine attacks one of the aldehyde groups of o-phthalaldehyde. After the addition and subsequent elimination of a water molecule, an imine is formed.\n    *   **Step 2: Cyanohydrin Formation**: The cyanide ion (from TMSCN) attacks the second aldehyde group of o-phthalaldehyde, forming a cyanohydrin.\n    *   **Step 3: Intramolecular Cyclization**: The intermediate now contains both an imine group and a cyanohydrin group. The hydroxyl (-OH) group of the cyanohydrin is nucleophilic and attacks the electrophilic carbon of the imine group. This intramolecular reaction forms a new five-membered ring fused to the original benzene ring.\n\n3.  **Product A**: The resulting product is **3-(pyridin-2-ylamino)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-1-carbonitrile**. This molecule contains the skeletons of all three reactants stitched together into a single, more complex structure. The reaction is stereoselective and produces a mixture of diastereomers due to the formation of two new chiral centers.\n\nThe overall chemical equation, representing the transformation of the main organic species, is:\nC₅H₆N₂ (2-aminopyridine) + C₈H₆O₂ (o-phthalaldehyde) + HCN (from TMSCN) → C₁₄H₁₁N₃O (Product A) + H₂O\n\nThe following Python code calculates the molecular weight of the reactants and the product and displays the final balanced chemical equation.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef calculate_mw(formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the molecular weight of a compound from its chemical formula.\"\"\"\n    atomic_weights = {\n        'C': 12.011,\n        'H': 1.008,\n        'N': 14.007,\n        'O': 15.999,\n        'Si': 28.085\n    }\n    \n    # Parse formula into a dictionary of element counts\n    import re\n    parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)', formula)\n    counts = collections.defaultdict(int)\n    for element, count in parts:\n        counts[element] += int(count) if count else 1\n\n    # Calculate molecular weight\n    mw = sum(atomic_weights[element] * count for element, count in counts.items())\n    return mw, counts\n\n# --- Reactants and Product Information ---\nreactants = {\n    \"2-Aminopyridine\": \"C5H6N2\",\n    \"o-Phthalaldehyde\": \"C8H6O2\",\n    \"Hydrogen Cyanide (from TMSCN)\": \"HCN\"\n}\n\nproduct_A_info = {\n    \"name\": \"3-(pyridin-2-ylamino)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-1-carbonitrile\",\n    \"formula\": \"C14H11N3O\",\n    \"smiles\": \"N#CC1c2ccccc2OC1Nc1ncccc1\"\n}\n\nbyproducts = {\n    \"Water\": \"H2O\"\n}\n\n# --- Main Program ---\nprint(\"--- Reaction Analysis ---\")\nprint(\"This is an Orru three-component reaction.\\n\")\n\nprint(\"Reactants:\")\nfor name, formula in reactants.items():\n    mw, _ = calculate_mw(formula)\n    print(f\"- {name}: Formula = {formula}, MW = {mw:.3f} g/mol\")\n\nprint(\"\\nProduct A:\")\nprint(f\"- IUPAC Name: {product_A_info['name']}\")\nprint(f\"- Formula: {product_A_info['formula']}\")\nmw_A, _ = calculate_mw(product_A_info['formula'])\nprint(f\"- Molecular Weight: {mw_A:.3f} g/mol\")\nprint(f\"- SMILES string: {product_A_info['smiles']}\")\n\n# --- The final equation ---\n# As per the instruction \"remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\"\n# here we construct and print the balanced chemical equation with numbers (coefficients and atomic counts).\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Final Balanced Equation ---\")\nreactants_formulae = [reactants[name] for name in [\"2-Aminopyridine\", \"o-Phthalaldehyde\", \"Hydrogen Cyanide (from TMSCN)\"]]\nproduct_formula = product_A_info['formula']\nbyproduct_formula = byproducts['Water']\n\n# Coefficients are all 1 in this reaction\nequation_str = (f\"1 {reactants_formulae[0]} + 1 {reactants_formulae[1]} + 1 {reactants_formulae[2]} \"\n                f\"-> 1 {product_formula} + 1 {byproduct_formula}\")\n\nprint(f\"The balanced chemical equation for the formation of the organic product is:\")\nprint(equation_str)\n\nprint(\"\\nDetailed numbers from the equation:\")\nfull_equation = \"1 \" + \" + 1 \".join(reactants_formulae) + \" -> 1 \" + product_formula + \" + 1 \" + byproduct_formula\n# Find all numbers (coefficients and subscripts)\nnumbers_in_equation = re.findall(r'\\d+', full_equation)\nprint(\" \".join(numbers_in_equation))\n<<<N#CC1c2ccccc2OC1Nc1ncccc1>>>"
