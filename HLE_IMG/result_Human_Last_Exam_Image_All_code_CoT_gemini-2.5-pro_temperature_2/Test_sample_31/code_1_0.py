    Calculates the Rasmussen invariant for the knot in the provided image.

    Steps:
    1. The knot in the image is identified as the mirror image of the 8_19 knot.
    2. The Rasmussen invariant of a mirror knot m(K) is the negative of the invariant
       of the original knot K, i.e., s(m(K)) = -s(K).
    3. The known Rasmussen invariant for the 8_19 knot is s(8_19) = 4.
    4. We calculate s(knot_in_image) = s(m(8_19)) = -s(8_19).
