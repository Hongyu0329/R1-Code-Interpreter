    "Based on the coordinates provided, I will first convert them from Degrees, Minutes, Seconds (DMS) format to Decimal Degrees (DD) to easily locate the structure on a map. This will help in identifying the structure and its historical significance. The formula for the conversion is: `DD = Degrees + (Minutes / 60) + (Seconds / 3600)`. For West longitudes and South latitudes, the final value is made negative.\n\n```python\n# --- Coordinate Conversion ---\n\n# Latitude: 29° 06' 18.75''N\nlat_deg = 29\nlat_min = 6\nlat_sec = 18.75\n\n# Longitude: 103° 47' 50.28''W\nlon_deg = 103\nlon_min = 47\nlon_sec = 50.28\n\n# Calculate Decimal Degrees\n# The sign for North latitude is positive\ndecimal_lat = lat_deg + (lat_min / 60) + (lat_sec / 3600)\n# The sign for West longitude is negative\ndecimal_lon = -1 * (lon_deg + (lon_min / 60) + (lon_sec / 3600))\n\n# Print the explanation and results\nprint(\"Converting the coordinates from DMS (Degrees, Minutes, Seconds) to DD (Decimal Degrees).\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Latitude Conversion (29° 06' 18.75''N) ---\")\nprint(f\"Formula: Degrees + (Minutes / 60) + (Seconds / 3600)\")\nprint(f\"Calculation: {lat_deg} + ({lat_min} / 60) + ({lat_sec} / 3600) = {decimal_lat:.6f}\")\n\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Longitude Conversion (103° 47' 50.28''W) ---\")\nprint(f\"Formula: -1 * (Degrees + (Minutes / 60) + (Seconds / 3600))\")\nprint(f\"Calculation: -1 * ({lon_deg} + ({lon_min} / 60) + ({lon_sec} / 3600)) = {decimal_lon:.6f}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe coordinates point to approximately {decimal_lat:.6f}, {decimal_lon:.6f}.\")\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Identification ---\")\nprint(\"This structure is the ruin of the Presidio de San Vicente.\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Historical Significance ---\")\nprint(\"Yes, it is a significant historic landmark.
