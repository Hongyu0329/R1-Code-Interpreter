def solve_cellular_automata_puzzle():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the cellular automata grouping puzzle.
    The solution is derived from visual analysis of the image patterns, grouping them into four distinct evolutionary families.
    Each group is ordered chronologically based on pattern size, which corresponds to the time step.
    The ordered groups are then assigned to the four rules based on their respective time sequences.
