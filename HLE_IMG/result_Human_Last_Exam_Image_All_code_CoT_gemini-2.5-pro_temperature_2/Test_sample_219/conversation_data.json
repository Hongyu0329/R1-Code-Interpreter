    "My plan is to analyze the provided raster plot to solve the user's request. Here are the steps:\n1.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts**: I will visually inspect the graph to find the points in time where a large number of electrodes fire at once. These are visible as dense, vertical clusters of dots.\n2.  **Estimate Timestamps**: For each identified burst, I will estimate its central timestamp from the x-axis (Time in seconds).\n3.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**: I will calculate the time difference between each consecutive pair of identified burst timestamps.\n4.  **Calculate Average IBI**: I will compute the average of all the calculated inter-burst intervals.\n5.  **Format the Output**: The final average will be rounded to two significant figures, as requested. I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the entire process.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts from the graph.\n# The bursts are dense vertical lines of activity.\nburst_timestamps = [3, 16, 26, 36, 48]\nprint(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs).\ninter_burst_intervals = []\nprint(\"Calculating inter-burst intervals:\")\nfor i in range(1, len(burst_timestamps)):\n    interval = burst_timestamps[i] - burst_timestamps[i-1]\n    inter_burst_intervals.append(interval)\n    print(f\"Interval {i}: {burst_timestamps[i]} s - {burst_timestamps[i-1]} s = {interval} s\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nCalculated inter-burst intervals (s): {inter_burst_intervals}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the average IBI.\naverage_ibi = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\n# Build the string for the equation\nsum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, inter_burst_intervals))\n\nprint(\"Calculating the average inter-burst interval:\")\nprint(f\"Average = ({sum_str}) / {len(inter_burst_intervals)}\")\nprint(f\"Average = {sum(inter_burst_intervals)} / {len(inter_burst_intervals)} = {average_ibi:.4f} s\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 5: Round the average to two significant figures.\n# The format '{:.2g}' handles rounding to the specified number of significant figures.\nformatted_average_ibi = \"{:.2g}\".format(average_ibi)\n\nprint(f\"The average inter-burst interval is {average_ibi:.4f} s.\")\nprint(f\"Rounding to two significant figures, the result is: {formatted_average_ibi} s\")\n\n# Final answer in the required format\nfinal_answer = float(formatted_average_ibi)\n```\n<<<11>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts in this graph of firing activity of a neuronal culture and calculate the average inter-burst interval to two significant figures.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
