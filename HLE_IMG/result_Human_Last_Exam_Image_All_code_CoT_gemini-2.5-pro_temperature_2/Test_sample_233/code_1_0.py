# Step 1: Define the components of the runestone's ID.
# After identifying the runestone from the image as the Gripsholm Runestone,
# its official Rundata ID can be retrieved. The ID consists of a
# two-letter code for the province and a number.

# The province code for Södermanland, Sweden.
province_code = "Sö"

# The specific number assigned to the Gripsholm Runestone.
id_number = 179

# Step 2: Combine the components to form the full ID.
# The standard format is the province code followed by the number.

full_runestone_id = f"{province_code} {id_number}"

# Step 3: Print the final answer, displaying the components used.
print(f"The runestone's official ID is formed by its province code and number.")
print(f"Province Code: {province_code}")
print(f"Number: {id_number}")
print(f"The full ID of the Ingvar runestone is: {full_runestone_id}")
