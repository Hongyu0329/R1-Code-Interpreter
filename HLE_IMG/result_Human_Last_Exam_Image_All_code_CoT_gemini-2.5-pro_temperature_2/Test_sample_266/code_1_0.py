# Step 1: Define the given edge length of the red hexagon.
s = 3.0

# Step 2: Calculate the area of the regular hexagon.
# The formula for the area of a regular hexagon with side 's' is (3 * sqrt(3) / 2) * s^2.
# This problem is solved under the assumption that the area of the white unit is equal
# to the area of the red hexagonal unit, a common property in such tiling puzzles.

s_squared = s**2
sqrt_3 = math.sqrt(3)
numerator = 3 * sqrt_3 * s_squared
area = numerator / 2

# Step 3: Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final answer.
print(f"The area of a regular hexagon is given by the formula: A = (3 * sqrt(3) / 2) * s^2")
print(f"Given the side length s = {s}")
print(f"The equation for the area is: A = (3 * sqrt(3) / 2) * {s}^2")
print(f"Step 1: Calculate s^2 = {s} * {s} = {s_squared}")
print(f"The equation becomes: A = (3 * sqrt(3) / 2) * {s_squared}")
