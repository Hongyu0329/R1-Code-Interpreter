    "Of course. The task is to identify the main distinguishing characteristic between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. I will provide a Python script that explains this key difference.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Research the defining sporophyte characteristics of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* from reliable botanical sources.\n2.  Identify the single most prominent difference that can be used for \"at a glance\" identification in the field. The specific epithet *curviseta* (\"curved stalk\") is a major clue.\n3.  Create a Python script that stores these characteristics and prints a clear, comparative explanation.\n4.  The script will first state the main difference and then elaborate on the features of each species. This makes the distinction easy to understand.\n5.  Finally, I will provide the concise answer in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef explain_grimmia_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the main visual difference between the sporophytes\n    of Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Dictionary storing the key sporophyte features for each species.\n    species_info = {\n        'Grimmia montana': {\n            'seta': 'Straight and short',\n            'capsule_orientation': 'Erect and immersed or emergent among the leaves.'\n        },\n        'Grimmia curviseta': {\n            'seta': 'Strongly curved or arcuate (bent)',\n            'capsule_orientation': 'Angled or nodding, often exserted to the side.'\n        }\n    }\n\n    # The main distinguishing feature.\n    main_difference = \"The main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta is the curvature of the seta (the stalk holding the capsule).\"\n    \n    print(main_difference)\n    print(\"-\" * len(main_difference))\n    \n    # Print details for each species for a clear comparison.\n    print(\"\\nHere are the details for each species:\\n\")\n\n    for species, details in species_info.items():\n        print(f\"Species: {species}\")\n        print(f\"  - Seta: {details['seta']}\")\n        print(f\"  - Resulting Capsule Look: {details['capsule_orientation']}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"This difference is so significant that Grimmia curviseta is named for it (curvi- = curved, seta = stalk).\")\n    print(\"At a glance, you look for a straight, upright capsule (G. montana) versus a capsule on a distinctly bent stalk (G. curviseta).\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    explain_grimmia_difference()\n```\n<<<The main difference is the seta (stalk): it is strongly curved in *Grimmia curviseta*, causing the capsule to nod, whereas it is short and straight in *Grimmia montana*, causing the capsule to be held erect and immersed among the leaves.>>>"
