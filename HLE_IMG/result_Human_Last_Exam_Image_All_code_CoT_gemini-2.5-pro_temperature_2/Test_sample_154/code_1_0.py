# Step 1: Define system capacities based on the provided diagram.
# These values are extracted from the MW and MVA ratings shown in the image.

# Local Generation Capacity (in MW)
p_ga_mw = 2 * 180
p_gb_mw = 2 * 180
p_gc_mw = 2 * 180
p_gd_mw = 3 * 15
p_ge_mw = 3 * 15
p_gf_mw = 3 * 15
# The total is the sum of all local power plants.
p_local_gen_total_mw = p_ga_mw + p_gb_mw + p_gc_mw + p_gd_mw + p_ge_mw + p_gf_mw

# Substation Load Capacity (in MVA)
# Note: There are three "Substation C" type entries in the diagram.
s_c_mva = 3 * (4 * 150)
s_d_mva = 3 * 63
# There are two Substations labeled 'E' with different ratings
s_e_mva = (3 * 50) + (3 * 40)
# The total apparent power is the sum of all substation capacities.
s_load_total_mva = s_c_mva + s_d_mva + s_e_mva

# Step 2: Formulate a model based on the problem description and testing Option C.
# Option C states: P_ext = 1248.5 MW, Harmonic impact = 8% increase in system losses.

base_loss_rate = 0.02  # 2% base resistive losses from the problem description
# We hypothesize the 8% harmonic impact adds to the base loss rate.
harmonic_loss_rate = 0.08
total_loss_rate = base_loss_rate + harmonic_loss_rate

# Value for external power supply from Option C
p_ext_supply_mw = 1248.5

# Step 3: Perform calculations to verify the consistency of the model.
# Total power that must be generated by all sources (external + local)
p_total_gen_mw = p_ext_supply_mw + p_local_gen_total_mw

# The total generation must supply the actual system load (P_load) plus the total system losses.
# The governing equation is: P_total_gen = P_load * (1 + total_loss_rate)
# From this, we can calculate the implied system load P_load.
p_load_implied_mw = p_total_gen_mw / (1 + total_loss_rate)

# With the implied load, we can find the implied power factor of the system.
implied_pf = p_load_implied_mw / s_load_total_mva

# Step 4: Print the entire calculation step-by-step to show the logic.
