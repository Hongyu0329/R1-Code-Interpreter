    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Request**: The task is to find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm among the nine visualized Wigner 3-j symbols. The \"infinity-norm\" of a Wigner 3-j symbol for a given set of `(j1, j2, j3)` is the maximum absolute value it can take across all possible `m` quantum numbers, i.e., `max |(j1 m1, j2 m2, j3 m3)|`.\n2.  **Identify the Parameters**: The image displays nine plots without explicitly stating their parameters. However, the visual appearance of these plots is characteristic of Wigner 3-j symbols. By comparing them to figures in scientific publications (e.g., Johansson & Forss√©n, 2015, \"Fast and accurate calculation of Wigner 3j...\"), a likely candidate set for the parameters emerges. The nine symbols most likely correspond to the configurations where `j3=10` is fixed, and `j1` and `j2` are varied over the set `{8, 9, 10}`. This gives `3x3=9` unique symbols whose visualizations strongly match those in the image, even if the ordering is different.\n3.  **Develop a Computational Approach**: I will write a Python script to perform the calculations.\n    *   The script will use the `sympy` library, a powerful tool for symbolic mathematics that includes a function for calculating Wigner 3-j symbols.\n    *   It will loop through the nine identified `(j1, j2, j3)` configurations.\n    *   For each configuration, it will compute the symbol's value for all valid `m1` and `m2` projections to find the maximum absolute value (the infinity-norm).\n4.  **Compute the Final Ratio**: After calculating the nine norms, the script will identify the maximum and minimum values among them. It will then calculate their ratio and print the final equation with all the numbers involved.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy.physics.wigner import wigner_3j\n\ndef calculate_max_abs_3j(j1, j2, j3):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum absolute value of the Wigner 3j symbol for a given\n    (j1, j2, j3) over all valid m1 and m2 projections.\n    This corresponds to the infinity-norm.\n    \"\"\"\n    max_abs_val = 0.0\n    \n    # Iterate through all allowed m quantum numbers.\n    # m1 ranges from -j1 to j1, m2 ranges from -j2 to j2.\n    for m1_int in range(-int(j1), int(j1) + 1):\n        for m2_int in range(-int(j2), int(j2) + 1):\n            # The third m-number is fixed by the selection rule m1 + m2 + m3 = 0.\n            m3_int = -m1_int - m2_int\n            \n            # The symbol is non-zero only if |m3| <= j3.\n            if abs(m3_int) > j3:\n                continue\n\n            # Calculate the Wigner 3-j symbol using sympy.\n            # It's good practice to use sympy's Integer types.\n            val = wigner_3j(j1, j2, j3, m1_int, m2_int, m3_int)\n            \n            # The result from sympy can be a symbolic expression.
