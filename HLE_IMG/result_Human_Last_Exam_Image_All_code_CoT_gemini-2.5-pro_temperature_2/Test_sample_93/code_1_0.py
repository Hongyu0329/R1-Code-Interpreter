        'Principle of Fluorescein Caging': 'Fluorescein\'s fluorescence is critically dependent on its two phenolic hydroxyl (OH) groups. The most effective way to "cage" the molecule (make it non-fluorescent) is to chemically modify these OH groups, typically by forming esters or ethers. This locks the fluorophore in a non-fluorescent state.',
        'Enzymatic Uncaging': 'For cell-type specific release, the caging group must be cleavable by an enzyme that can be specifically expressed in target cells via genetic engineering.',
        'Evaluation of Options': {
            'A': 'Incorrect. Converting a phenolic OH to an amine is a chemically difficult and non-standard caging method.',
            'B': 'Correct. Modifying the OH groups with acetyl groups forms esters. This effectively quenches fluorescence. Ester bonds are readily cleaved by esterase enzymes. A specific esterase can be genetically targeted to desired cells, providing cell-type specific uncaging. This is a well-established method.',
            'C': 'Incorrect. C-H functionalization is complex, and enzymatic C-C bond cleavage is not a standard or practical uncaging strategy.',
            'D': 'Incorrect. Modifying the carboxylic acid (COOH) group (e.g., to an amide) does not effectively quench the fluorescence, which is essential for a caging application. This is a conjugation strategy, not a caging one.',
            'E': 'Incorrect. While modifying the OH groups is the right approach, enzymatic cleavage of cyclopropyl ethers is much less common and established than the hydrolysis of esters.',
            'F': 'Incorrect. Similar to D, modifying the COOH group does not quench the core fluorescence of the molecule.'
        },
        'Conclusion': 'The most viable strategy is to modify the phenolic OH groups to form esters (like acetyl esters), which quenches fluorescence, and then use a genetically targeted esterase to cleave the esters and release the fluorescent molecule in a cell-specific manner.'
