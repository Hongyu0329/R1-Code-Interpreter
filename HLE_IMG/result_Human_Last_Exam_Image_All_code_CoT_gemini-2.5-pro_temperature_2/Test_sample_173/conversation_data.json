    "To find the time signature, we need to add up the durations of all the notes in the measure and see how many beats they amount to. The time signature is not explicitly written, so we must deduce it from the content of the measure.\n\nLet's analyze the rhythm in the top staff (the right hand):\n*   The measure is divided into four distinct groups of notes.\n*   The first group is a sixteenth rest followed by three sixteenth notes. Together, their duration is equivalent to four sixteenth notes.\n*   The second, third, and fourth groups each consist of four sixteenth notes.\n*   In music, four sixteenth notes (4 * 1/16) are equal in duration to one quarter note (1/4).\n*   So, the measure contains four groups, each equal to a quarter note.\n*   Total duration = 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note = 4 quarter notes.\n\nThis means there are 4 beats in the measure, and the quarter note gets one beat. Therefore, the time signature is 4/4.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this sum to confirm the time signature.\n\n```python\ndef find_time_signature():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the time signature by summing the note durations in the measure.\n    We will treat a quarter note as having a value of 1 beat.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # In 4/4 time, a sixteenth note is worth 0.25 beats (1/4 of a quarter note).\n    sixteenth_note_value = 0.25\n\n    # Each of the four groups in the right hand consists of notes and/or rests\n    # that add up to the duration of four sixteenth notes.\n    group_duration = 4 * sixteenth_note_value  # This is equal to 1 quarter note beat\n\n    # There are four such groups in the measure.\n    num_groups = 4\n\n    beat1 = group_duration\n    beat2 = group_duration\n    beat3 = group_duration\n    beat4 = group_duration\n\n    # Calculate the total number of beats in the measure\n    total_beats = beat1 + beat2 + beat3 + beat4\n\n    # The time signature's top number is the total beats per measure.\n    # The bottom number indicates the note value that gets one beat (4 for a quarter note).\n    numerator = int(total_beats)\n    denominator = 4\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the rhythm:\")\n    print(\"The measure contains 4 groups. Each group's duration is equivalent to a quarter note (1 beat).\")\n    print(\"Equation for total beats:\")\n    print(f\"{int(beat1)} + {int(beat2)} + {int(beat3)} + {int(beat4)} = {int(total_beats)} beats\")\n    print(f\"\\nThis means there are {numerator} quarter-note beats per measure.\")\n    print(f\"The time signature is {numerator}/{denominator}.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to answer choice C.\")\n\nfind_time_signature()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
