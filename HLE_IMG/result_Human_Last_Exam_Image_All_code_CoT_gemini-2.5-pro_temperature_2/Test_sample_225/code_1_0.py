# The task is to identify Compound A, which is the product of the given reaction.
# The plan is to deduce the product's structure and then use Python to formalize this deduction
# by determining its name and molecular formula.

# Step 1: Define the reactant and the transformation.
# The named reactant is tris(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)methylium ion.
reactant_name = "tris(2,3-dimethoxy phenyl)methylium ion"
# The reaction with HCl/reflux causes hydrolysis of ether groups (demethylation),
# converting methoxy (-OCH3) groups to hydroxyl (-OH) groups.

# Step 2: Determine the name of the product (Compound A).
# The "dimethoxy" substituents on each ring are converted to "dihydroxy" substituents.
product_name = reactant_name.replace("dimethoxy", "dihydroxy")

# Step 3: Calculate the molecular formula of the product cation.
# The product is tris(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)methylium ion.
# Its formula is composed of a central carbon, three phenyl rings, and their substituents.
num_rings = 3

# Calculate the number of Carbon atoms.
# Formula: 1 (from central C+) + 3 rings * 6 carbons/ring
carbons = 1 + num_rings * 6

# Calculate the number of Hydrogen atoms.
# Each C6 ring loses 1 H to bind to the central carbon and 2 H for the two OH groups, leaving 3 H.
# Each of the 6 OH groups (2 per ring * 3 rings) contributes 1 H.
hydrogens_on_rings = num_rings * (6 - 1 - 2)
hydrogens_on_oh = num_rings * 2
hydrogens = hydrogens_on_rings + hydrogens_on_oh

# Calculate the number of Oxygen atoms.
# There are 2 oxygen atoms per ring.
oxygens = num_rings * 2

# Step 4: Print the final answer.
print(f"The reaction converts the reactant, {reactant_name}, to its fully hydrolyzed form.")
print(f"The product, Compound A, is: {product_name}")
print("\nThe molecular formula for the product cation is calculated as follows:")
print(f"Number of Carbon atoms = 1 (central) + {num_rings} * 6 (in rings) = {carbons}")
print(f"Number of Hydrogen atoms = {hydrogens_on_rings} (on rings) + {hydrogens_on_oh} (on OH groups) = {hydrogens}")
print(f"Number of Oxygen atoms = {num_rings} * 2 (in OH groups) = {oxygens}")

print(f"\nThe molecular formula of the cation A is: C{carbons}H{hydrogens}O{oxygens}+")
