    "To determine the country of the viewpoint, I will analyze the positions of the celestial objects shown in the night sky image.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Extract Data from the Image:**\n    *   The date and time are 2024-10-22 at 20:07:37 CEST (Central European Summer Time), which is 18:07:37 UTC.\n    *   The image displays a full-sky (fisheye) view, with the zenith (the point directly overhead) near the center.\n    *   Prominent celestial bodies are labeled: planets Jupiter and Saturn, and bright stars Capella and Vega.\n\n2.  **Form a Hypothesis based on Visual Cues:**\n    *   The CEST timezone restricts the location to central Europe.\n    *   In the image, Jupiter is very high in the sky (close to the center/zenith), and it appears significantly higher than the star Capella.\n    *   The altitude of stars depends on the observer's latitude. Jupiter, with a declination of about +16°, will appear higher in the sky for observers at more southerly latitudes. Conversely, Capella (declination +46°) will appear higher for observers at more northerly latitudes.\n    *   The fact that Jupiter appears much higher than Capella strongly suggests the observation point is in the southern part of the CEST zone. This points towards countries like Italy, Spain, or southern France, rather than more northern countries like Germany or Poland.\n\n3.  **Verify with a Python Script:**\n    *   I will use the `skyfield` astronomy library to calculate the precise positions (altitude and azimuth) of these celestial objects for a candidate location.\n    *   I will choose Rome, Italy, as a representative location for a southern European country in the CEST zone (Latitude ≈ 42° N).\n    *   The script will calculate the altitudes of Jupiter and Capella. A large difference between their altitudes will support the hypothesis.\n    *   I will print all the input parameters and the resulting calculated positions to show the basis for the conclusion.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport skyfield.api\nfrom skyfield.api import load, EarthSatellite\nfrom skyfield.timelib import Time\n\ndef calculate_sky_position():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the position of celestial objects for a given time and location\n    to determine the viewpoint country of an astronomy picture.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
