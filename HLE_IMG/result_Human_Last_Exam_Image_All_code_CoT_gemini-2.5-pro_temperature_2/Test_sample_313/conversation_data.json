    "My plan to solve this riddle is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Image and Clue 1:** The first clue states, \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\" The image shows two men at an awards ceremony. A reverse image search reveals that the man on the right is professional hockey player Andrei Vasilevskiy receiving the Vezina Trophy at the NHL Awards. The 2019 event was held on June 19th, which is very close to the provided date. The key takeaway from the image is that it's related to hockey.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clue 2:** The second clue is a riddle: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This strongly points to the historical manufacture of felt hats. A mercury compound (mercury nitrate) was used in a process called \"carroting\" to separate fur from the skin for making felt. This process was notoriously toxic and is the origin of the phrase \"mad as a hatter.\" Modern felt-making no longer uses mercury.\n\n3.  **Connect the Two Clues:** I need to find the link between \"hockey\" and \"mercury-laden hats.\" The connection is the word \"hat.\" In hockey, a \"hat trick\" (scoring three goals) is a major accomplishment. The term originated in cricket, where a bowler who achieved the feat was rewarded with a new hat.\n\n4.  **Identify \"X Y\":** The two-word phrase \"X Y\" that links these ideas is \"Felt Hat\".\n    *   The concept of a hat (and thus a \"Felt Hat\") is metaphorically \"pictured\" through the hockey player and the associated \"hat trick.\"\n    *   The \"other\" meaning of \"Felt Hat\" is the physical object whose manufacturing process with mercury is now obsolete due to toxicity.\n\n5.  **Create Code:** I will write a Python script that simply prints the answer, \"FELT HAT\". The instruction in the prompt about an \"equation\" seems to be a template error, as this is a word-based riddle with no mathematical components.\n\n```python\n# The image features a famous hockey player. A well-known term in hockey is a \"hat trick\".\n# The riddle describes a product that is no longer made using a toxic process involving mercury salts.\n# This refers to the historical method of making felt hats, which used mercury nitrate and led to the phrase \"mad as a hatter\".\n# The link between the hockey player in the image and the riddle is the concept of a hat.\n# Therefore, the two-word answer \"X Y\" is \"FELT HAT\".\n\n# The prompt's reference to an \"equation\" and \"numbers\" is likely an inapplicable instruction for this word-based problem.\n# The code will print the solved phrase.\nword1 = \"FELT\"\nword2 = \"HAT\"\n\nprint(f\"{word1} {word2}\")\n```\n<<<FELT HAT>>>"
