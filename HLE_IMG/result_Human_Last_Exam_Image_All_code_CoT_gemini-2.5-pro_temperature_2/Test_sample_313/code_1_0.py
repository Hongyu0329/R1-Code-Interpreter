# The image features a famous hockey player. A well-known term in hockey is a "hat trick".
# The riddle describes a product that is no longer made using a toxic process involving mercury salts.
# This refers to the historical method of making felt hats, which used mercury nitrate and led to the phrase "mad as a hatter".
# The link between the hockey player in the image and the riddle is the concept of a hat.
# Therefore, the two-word answer "X Y" is "FELT HAT".

# The prompt's reference to an "equation" and "numbers" is likely an inapplicable instruction for this word-based problem.
# The code will print the solved phrase.
