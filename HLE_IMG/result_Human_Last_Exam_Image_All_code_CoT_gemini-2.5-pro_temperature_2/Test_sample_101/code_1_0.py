# The reaction involves two steps.
# Step 1: 3-hydroxy-pyridine-2-carbaldehyde reacts with aniline to form an imine.
# Step 2: The imine intermediate reacts with NaCN in a Strecker-type reaction.

# Let's determine the structure of the final product, Compound A,
# which is 2-((cyano)(phenylamino)methyl)pyridin-3-ol.

# We will now calculate the molecular formula for Compound A by summing the atoms from its constituent parts.

# 1. Phenylamino group (-NH-C6H5)
c_phenylamino = 6
h_phenylamino = 6 # 5 from the phenyl ring + 1 from the N-H group
n_phenylamino = 1
o_phenylamino = 0

# 2. Cyano group (-Câ‰¡N)
c_cyano = 1
h_cyano = 0
n_cyano = 1
o_cyano = 0

# 3. Methine group that links everything to the pyridine ring (-CH-)
c_methine = 1
h_methine = 1
n_methine = 0
o_methine = 0

# 4. The 3-hydroxy-pyridin-2-yl group (the main scaffold)
# This is a pyridine ring (C5H4N) with one H replaced by -OH and another by the side chain.
# So the atoms from the scaffold are from C5H3N-OH.
c_pyridinyl = 5
h_pyridinyl = 4 # 3 on the ring + 1 on the -OH group
n_pyridinyl = 1
o_pyridinyl = 1

# Total atom counts
total_carbons = c_phenylamino + c_cyano + c_methine + c_pyridinyl
total_hydrogens = h_phenylamino + h_cyano + h_methine + h_pyridinyl
total_nitrogens = n_phenylamino + n_cyano + n_methine + n_pyridinyl
total_oxygens = o_phenylamino + o_cyano + o_methine + o_pyridinyl
