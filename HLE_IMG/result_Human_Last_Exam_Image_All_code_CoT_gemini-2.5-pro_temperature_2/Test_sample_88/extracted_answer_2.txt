The analysis shows that the three products are formed through different pathways from the same set of starting materials. Product C is the mixed anhydride formed by acetylation of the starting material's carboxylic acid. Product B is formed by the reaction of the starting material and methyl propiolate with the elimination of methanol. Product A is formed from the reaction of intermediate C with methyl propiolate, followed by the elimination of carbon dioxide.
