    "Of course. I can help with that. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the image**: I will examine the provided image and its cropped versions to identify the subject.\n2.  **Identify the animal**: The subject is clearly an insect. Based on its characteristics, specifically the very long antennae and body shape, I can classify it as a longhorn beetle (family Cerambycidae).\n3.  **Determine the species**: I will look at the specific markings—a black body with a prominent red-orange band across the top of the wing covers (elytra)—to narrow down the exact species.\n4.  **Find the scientific name**: Based on these features, the beetle most closely resembles the species *Analeptura liturata*.\n5.  **Generate Python code**: I will write a simple Python script to print a message confirming the presence of the animal and stating its scientific name, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef identify_animal():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the animal in the image and prints its scientific name.\n  \"\"\"\n  is_animal_present = True\n  animal_type = \"longhorn beetle\"\n  scientific_name = \"Analeptura liturata\"\n\n  if is_animal_present:\n    print(\"Yes, there is an animal in this image.\")\n    # The double backslash for the output is to make sure the final output format is what is expected\n    # since a single one would escape the final <.\n    # It does not mean I am outputting two backslashes.\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"The animal is a {animal_type}, and its scientific name is {scientific_name}.\\n\")\n  else:\n    print(\"No animal was identified in the image.\")\n\nidentify_animal()\n```\n<<<Analeptura liturata>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Is there an animal in this image?
