    "Based on the artifact shown in the image, I will determine the century to which it belongs and then format the answer as requested.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Artifact Identification**: The image displays a Roman silver medallion, specifically a *phalera*, which was a form of military decoration worn on a soldier's breastplate.\n2.  **Iconographic Analysis**: The phalera features two confronting busts. The figure on the left with ram's horns is identifiable as the syncretic Greco-Roman deity Jupiter-Ammon (or Zeus-Ammon). The bust on the right is a portrait of a Roman emperor. Based on the portrait style, particularly the hairstyle, this emperor is identified as Tiberius.\n3.  **Dating the Artifact**: Emperor Tiberius reigned from 14 AD to 37 AD. Since the medallion bears his image, it must have been created during his reign or shortly after. This places the artifact firmly within the 1st century AD.\n4.  **Answering the Question**: The question is \"Which century do archaeologists ascribe to this medallion?\". The answer is the 1st century AD.\n5.  **Formatting the Output**: The prompt provides a specific but unusual example format for the answer: \"9 A.D.\", which looks like a specific year rather than a century. To reconcile the question about the century with the given format, I will use the century number (1) and place it into the \"X A.D.\" format. The code will therefore output \"1 A.D.\". This fulfills the requirement of using the correct information (the century number 1) while adhering to the specified output format.\n\n```python\n# The artifact is a Roman phalera (military decoration) depicting Emperor Tiberius and Jupiter-Ammon.\n# Tiberius reigned from 14 AD to 37 AD.\n# Therefore, the medallion dates to the 1st century AD.\n\n# The question asks for the century. The number for the century is 1.\ncentury_number = 1\n\n# The prompt gives an example answer format of \"9 A.D.\".\n# We will use our identified century number (1) and apply that format.\nprint(f\"{century_number} A.D.\")\n```\n<<<1 A.D.>>>"
