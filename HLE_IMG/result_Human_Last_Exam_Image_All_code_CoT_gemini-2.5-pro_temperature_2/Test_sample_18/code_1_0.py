1. The initial position appears to be a paradox: The White King on c3 is in check by the Black Queen on e2, but it is Black's turn to move. This is impossible under standard chess rules.

2. The clue "one piece has been hidden from view" is the key. The paradox is resolved by deducing that the piece on c3 is not the White King but a decoy (a second White Queen). The true White King is the 'hidden piece'.

3. The most logical location for the hidden White King is h1, replacing the White Bishop that would normally be there. This suggests a history where White has castled kingside.

4. With the White King on h1, the position is legal for Black to move. Black can now deliver checkmate in a single move.
