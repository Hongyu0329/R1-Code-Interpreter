    "To solve this problem, I will follow a structured plan:\n1.  **Identify Molecules**: I will identify the three molecules depicted in the image: two reactants on the left and one product on the right. I will determine their structures and represent them using SMILES strings. Due to the visual complexity and potential ambiguities in the drawings, I will derive plausible SMILES that match the key structural features shown.\n2.  **Calculate Crippen logP**: For each molecule, I will calculate its Crippen logP value using the RDKit library in Python.\n3.  **Filter Molecules**: I will filter these molecules, keeping only those with a Crippen logP value greater than 1, as specified in the problem statement.\n4.  **Calculate Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI)**: For each molecule that passes the filter, I will calculate its Eccentric Connectivity Index. The problem states that hydrogens must be included. The ECI is calculated as the sum of products of vertex degree and vertex eccentricity over all atoms (including hydrogens) in the molecular graph: `ECI = Î£(deg(v) * ecc(v))`.\n    *   `deg(v)` is the degree of an atom (number of bonds).\n    *   `ecc(v)` is the eccentricity of an atom (the maximum shortest path distance from this atom to any other atom in the molecule).\n5.  **Sum the Indices**: I will sum the Eccentric Connectivity Indices of all the selected molecules to get the final answer.\n6.  **Format Output**: The final Python script will print the step-by-step calculation, including the full equation showing each `degree * eccentricity` term, and finally, the total sum.\n\nBased on my interpretation of the structures:\n*   **Molecule 1 (reactant)**: A simplified version, 2-amino-5-fluoro-3-(benzyloxy)pyridine, will be used due to ambiguity in the substituent pattern of the depicted structure. Its SMILES is `c1ccc(cc1)COC1=C(N)C=C(F)C=N1`.\n*   **Molecule 2 (reactant)**: 7-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazine. Its SMILES is `ClN1CC2=C(C1)N=CC=N2`.\n*   **Molecule 3 (product)**: Interpreted as 2-amino-5-fluoro-3-(6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazin-7-yl)pyridine. Its SMILES is `NC1=C(N2CC3=C(C2)N=CC=N3)C=C(F)C=N1`.\n\nThe script will now perform the calculations on these structures.\n\n```python\nimport rdkit\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem import Crippen\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_eccentric_connectivity_index(mol_with_hs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Eccentric Connectivity Index for a molecule, including hydrogens.\n    ECI = sum(degree(v) * eccentricity(v)) for all atoms v.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the graph distance matrix (shortest path lengths between all atom pairs)\n    dist_matrix = Chem.GetDistanceMatrix(mol_with_hs)\n    num_atoms = mol_with_hs.GetNumAtoms()\n    \n    eci = 0\n    eci_terms_list = []\n    \n    # Iterate over each atom (vertex) i\n    for i in range(num_atoms):\n        atom = mol_with_hs.GetAtomWithIdx(i)\n        \n        # Get the degree of the atom\n        degree = atom.GetDegree()\n        \n        # Get the eccentricity of the atom (max value in its row of the distance matrix)\n        eccentricity = int(max(dist_matrix[i]))\n        \n        # Calculate the term for this atom and add to sum\n        term = degree * eccentricity\n        eci += term\n        eci_terms_list.append(f\"({degree} * {eccentricity})\")\n        \n    return eci, eci_terms_list\n\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the user's task.\n    1.
