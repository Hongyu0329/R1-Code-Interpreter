    "My plan to determine the molecular formula of the product is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction:** The first step involves the reaction of 2-aminothiazole with ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This is a classic cyclocondensation reaction (a variation of the Hantzsch synthesis) that forms a fused heterocyclic system.\n    *   First, the amino group of 2-aminothiazole attacks the carbon bearing the chlorine atom, leading to an N-alkylation product and releasing HCl.\n    *   Then, under reflux, an intramolecular cyclization occurs where the nitrogen atom from the thiazole ring attacks the ketone carbonyl group. This is followed by dehydration (loss of H₂O) to form a stable, aromatic imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system.\n    *   I will calculate the molecular formula of this \"Intermediate\" by adding the formulas of the reactants and subtracting the formulas of the small molecules lost (HCl and H₂O).\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction:** The \"Intermediate\" product, which is an ester, is treated with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) and then with benzylamine.\n    *   Trimethylaluminum is a Lewis acid that activates the ester carbonyl group towards nucleophilic attack.\n    *   Benzylamine acts as a nucleophile, attacking the activated carbonyl and replacing the ethoxy group (-OEt) to form an amide.\n    *   The overall transformation is the conversion of an ethyl ester (-COOEt) to a N-benzyl amide (-CONH-Bn).\n\n3.  **Calculate the final product's formula:** I will take the molecular formula of the intermediate and adjust it based on the atoms lost and gained during the amidation reaction.\n    *   Lost group: Ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃).\n    *   Gained group: N-benzylamino group (-NH-CH₂-C₆H₅).\n    *   I will sum the atoms to arrive at the final molecular formula.\n\n4.  **Construct the Python code:** The Python script will systematically perform these calculations and print out each step, including the atom counts for each element, to clearly show how the final molecular formula is derived.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_molecular_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product based on the reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate the formula of the Intermediate ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculating the molecular formula of the Intermediate.\")\n\n    # Molecular formulas of the starting materials\n    aminothiazole = {'C': 3, 'H': 4, 'N': 2, 'O': 0, 'S': 1}\n    chloro_keto_ester = {'C': 6, 'H': 9, 'Cl': 1, 'O': 3, 'S': 0, 'N': 0}\n\n    # Small molecules eliminated during the reaction\n    hcl = {'H': 1, 'Cl': 1}\n    h2o = {'H': 2, 'O': 1}\n\n    print(\"Formula of 2-aminothiazole: C3H4N2S\")\n    print(\"Formula of ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate: C6H9ClO3\")\n    print(\"The reaction is a cyclocondensation, which eliminates one molecule of HCl and one molecule of H2O.\")\n    \n    # Calculate intermediate formula\n    intermediate_c = aminothiazole['C'] + chloro_keto_ester['C']\n    intermediate_h = aminothiazole['H'] + chloro_keto_ester['H'] -
