    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, I will follow these steps:\n1.  Identify the three chiral centers in the molecule. I will label them C2, C3, and C4, moving from left to right along the carbon backbone.\n2.  For each chiral center, I will assign priorities to the four attached groups based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules. The priority is determined by the atomic number of the atoms directly attached to the chiral center.\n3.  I will then determine the (R) or (S) configuration by observing the spatial arrangement of the prioritized groups. The orientation of the lowest-priority group (usually a hydrogen atom) is key:\n    *   If the lowest-priority group is pointing away (dashed wedge), the configuration is determined directly by the 1 -> 2 -> 3 path (clockwise = R, counter-clockwise = S).\n    *   If the lowest-priority group is pointing forward (solid wedge), the configuration is the reverse of the 1 -> 2 -> 3 path.\n    *   If the lowest-priority group is in the plane, I will use a swap method to mentally place it in the back and then determine the configuration.\n\nThe following Python script will systematically apply this logic to each center to find the final configuration.\n\n```python\ndef solve_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the absolute configuration (R/S) of the three stereocenters\n    in the provided molecule by applying the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n    The stereocenters are labeled C2, C3, and C4 from left to right for clarity.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the stereocenter at C2 (leftmost, with -OH group):\")\n    print(\"Step 1: Assign CIP priorities based on atomic number at the first point of difference.\")\n    print(\"1: -OH (Oxygen Z=8)\")\n    print(\"2: -C(Et)...
