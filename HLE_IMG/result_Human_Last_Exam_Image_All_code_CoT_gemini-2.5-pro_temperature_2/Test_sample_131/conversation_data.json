    "My plan to identify this alkaloid compound is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the structure's core features:** The image displays a tetracyclic (four-ring) system containing two nitrogen atoms. This framework is characteristic of quinolizidine alkaloids. Additionally, there is a carbonyl group (C=O) present in one of the rings, making it a lactam.\n2.  **Identify the parent compound:** The underlying carbon-nitrogen skeleton, without the carbonyl group, is known as sparteine. Sparteine and its derivatives are common lupin alkaloids.\n3.  **Identify the specific derivative:** The compound shown is an oxidized form of sparteine, specifically 2-oxosparteine. The common name for this specific alkaloid is Lupanine.\n4.  **Create the Python code:** As requested, I will provide a Python script that prints the identified name of the compound.\n\n```python\n# This script will print the name of the alkaloid compound shown in the image.\n# The identification is based on chemical structure recognition.\ncompound_name = \"Lupanine\"\nprint(compound_name)\n```\n<<<Lupanine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
