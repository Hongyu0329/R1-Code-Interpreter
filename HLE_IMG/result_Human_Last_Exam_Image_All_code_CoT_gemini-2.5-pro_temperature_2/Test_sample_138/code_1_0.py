# The reasoning for identifying the biological sexes of the insects:
# Pair A: The right insect has two prongs at the tip of its abdomen, a male characteristic. The left insect does not, making it female. This is (F, M), which is option 4.
# Pair B: The right insect has curled antennae, a classic male trait in paper wasps. The left insect has straight antennae. This is (F, M), which is option 4.
# Pair C: The left insect has very long antennae, characteristic of male long-horned bees. The right insect has short antennae, making it female. This is (M, F), which is option 3.

# Assign the identified indices to variables.
index_A = 4
index_B = 4
index_C = 3

# Print the final answer as a comma-separated string.
print(f"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}")
