    "This is a biological identification task. Here is a breakdown of the visual cues for determining the sex of each insect pair.\n\n*   **Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):** The insect on the right exhibits two prominent projections (prongs) at the tip of its abdomen. This is a definitive characteristic of a male in this group of bees (*Triepeolus* or a related genus). The insect on the left has a more pointed but less specialized abdominal tip, typical of a female. Thus, the pair is Female, Male (F, M).\n*   **Pair B (Paper Wasps):** The most telling feature is the antennae. The wasp on the right has antennae that are distinctly curled at the tips, which is a classic trait of male paper wasps (*Polistes*). The wasp on the left has straight antennae. Therefore, the pair is Female, Male (F, M).\n*   **Pair C (Long-horned Bees):** This pair shows strong sexual dimorphism in their antennae. The bee on the left has extremely long antennae, a hallmark of males in this tribe (Eucerini), which gives them their common name \"long-horned bees.\" The bee on the right has much shorter, more typical bee-like antennae, identifying it as the female. This makes the pair Male, Female (M, F).\n\nBased on this analysis:\n*   Pair A is Female, Male, which corresponds to index **4**.\n*   Pair B is Female, Male, which corresponds to index **4**.\n*   Pair C is Male, Female, which corresponds to index **3**.\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of these indices.\n\n```python\n# The reasoning for identifying the biological sexes of the insects:\n# Pair A: The right insect has two prongs at the tip of its abdomen, a male characteristic. The left insect does not, making it female. This is (F, M), which is option 4.\n# Pair B: The right insect has curled antennae, a classic male trait in paper wasps. The left insect has straight antennae. This is (F, M), which is option 4.\n# Pair C: The left insect has very long antennae, characteristic of male long-horned bees. The right insect has short antennae, making it female. This is (M, F), which is option 3.\n\n# Assign the identified indices to variables.\nindex_A = 4\nindex_B = 4\nindex_C = 3\n\n# Print the final answer as a comma-separated string.\nprint(f\"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}\")\n```\n<<<4, 4, 3>>>"
