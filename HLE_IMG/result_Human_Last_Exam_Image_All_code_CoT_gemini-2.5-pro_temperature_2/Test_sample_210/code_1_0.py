# This script is designed to output the identified match for the Nyala.
# The identification process is based on visual comparison of key features.

# Key features of the target Nyala:
# 1. Horns: Specific curvature with pale tips.
# 2. Stripes: A consistent pattern of vertical white stripes.
# 3. Spots: A unique and distinctive cluster of white spots on the rear flank.

# Comparison Analysis:
# - Image A shows a younger male with smaller horns.
# - Image C and D have different patterns and/or body structures.
# - Image E has a different horn shape.
# - Image F is too obscured for positive identification.
# - Image B shows a Nyala with a horn shape, stripe pattern, and a flank spot pattern
#   that perfectly matches the target individual.

# The variable 'correct_image' stores the letter corresponding to the correct image.
correct_image = 'B'

# Print the final answer.
