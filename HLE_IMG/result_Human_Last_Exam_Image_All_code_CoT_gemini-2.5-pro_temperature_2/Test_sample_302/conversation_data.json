    "My plan is to identify the characters on the seal, which are written in an ancient seal script (篆书, zhuànshū). I will read them in the traditional Chinese order, from right to left and top to bottom. Then, I will convert these traditional characters to their simplified Chinese counterparts. The phrase is a common Chinese idiom.\n\n1.  **Right Column (Top to Bottom):**\n    *   The top character is `學` (xué), which means \"learning\" or \"to study\".\n    *   The bottom character is `海` (hǎi), which means \"sea\" or \"ocean\".\n\n2.  **Left Column (Top to Bottom):**\n    *   The top character is `無` (wú), which means \"without\" or \"no\".\n    *   The bottom character is `涯` (yá), which means \"shore\" or \"limit\".\n\n3.  **Putting it together:** Read from right to left, the phrase is `學海無涯` (xué hǎi wú yá).\n\n4.  **Conversion to Simplified Chinese:**\n    *   `學` becomes `学`.\n    *   `無` becomes `无`.\n    *   `海` and `涯` are the same in both traditional and simplified Chinese.\n\nThe phrase in simplified Chinese is `学海无涯`. This is a famous idiom meaning \"The sea of learning is boundless,\" encouraging lifelong learning.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to print the result.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the simplified Chinese characters identified from the seal.\nseal_characters_simplified = \"学海无涯\"\nprint(seal_characters_simplified)\n```\n<<<学海无涯>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What's the character content on the seal in simplified Chinese?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
