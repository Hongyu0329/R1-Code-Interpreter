    print("Step 1: Analyzing the collage's components.")
    print(" - Art Style: The image is a collage, a technique favored by Dadaists and Surrealists.")
    print(" - Central Figure: A hybrid creature with a human female body and a horned animal (gazelle/antelope) head. The figure is covering its face, suggesting hidden identity or a psychological state.")
    print(" - Textual Elements: The text includes significant clues:")
    print("   - 'Persephone': A direct reference to Greek mythology, specifically the queen of the underworld, tied to themes of duality, seasons, and the subconscious.")
    print("   - 'the human cry developing hybrids': Explicitly connects primal human expression ('the human cry') to the creation of hybrid beings.")
    print("   - 'superstitious about everything': Suggests a pre-rational, psychological state.")
    print(" - Juxtaposition: The image combines disparate elements: a mundane postcard, a bleak landscape, mythological references, and fragmented text. This creates a dreamlike, illogical, and uncanny atmosphere.")
    print("\nStep 2: Identifying the dominant themes.")
    print(" - The Unconscious: The dreamlike atmosphere and illogical connections point to an exploration of the unconscious mind.")
    print(" - Mythology and Symbolism: The use of 'Persephone' is not decorative but symbolic of deeper psychological states.")
    print(" - Dreams: The overall composition resembles dream logic, where unrelated objects and ideas are brought together.")
    print(" - Primal Drives: The phrase 'the human cry' suggests a focus on primal, non-rational aspects of human nature.")
    print("\nStep 3: Connecting themes to a theorist.")
    print(" - The Surrealist art movement, which heavily utilized collage, was explicitly founded on the psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud.")
    print(" - Freud's work, especially 'The Interpretation of Dreams' (1899), posits that dreams, myths, and slips of the tongue are the 'royal road to the unconscious'.")
    print(" - The collage's elements align perfectly with Freudian concepts:")
    print("   - The dreamlike state as a window into the mind.")
    print("   - The use of mythological figures (like Oedipus in Freud's own work) as symbols for psychological complexes.")
    print("   - The focus on primal drives (the Id).")
    print("   - The hybrid creature as a manifestation of repressed desires or conflicting parts of the psyche.")
    print("\nStep 4: Conclusion.")
    print("The artwork's deep engagement with dream logic, mythological symbolism, hybridity, and the unconscious points overwhelmingly to the influence of Sigmund Freud, whose theories provided the primary intellectual foundation for the Surrealist movement.")
