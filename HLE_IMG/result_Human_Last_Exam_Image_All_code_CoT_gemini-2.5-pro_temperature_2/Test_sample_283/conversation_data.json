    "Here is my plan to identify the country from the Google Trends graph:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph for Patterns:** I will first examine the provided time-series graph to identify recurring patterns. The graph displays three distinct lines (red, yellow, and blue) with search interest data from December 2019 to after May 2023. The key feature is the annual, repeating peaks for each color, suggesting these events are anniversaries or annual holidays.\n\n2.  **Determine the Approximate Dates of Peaks:**\n    *   **Red Line:** Shows major spikes every year in the January-February timeframe, corresponding to the Lunar New Year.\n    *   **Yellow Line:** Has sharp peaks around the beginning of October each year. This strongly suggests a national holiday on October 1st.\n    *   **Blue Line:** Displays smaller, but consistent, annual peaks in early June.\n\n3.  **Hypothesize and Correlate Events:** I will correlate these dated patterns with major historical events or holidays of a single country.\n    *   The early October peak (Yellow) points directly to the National Day of the People's Republic of China (October 1st).\n    *   The early June peak (Blue) corresponds with the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre (June 4th, 1989), an event of significant global interest and sensitivity.\n    *   The January/February peak (Red) aligns with the Lunar New Year, the most important festival in that country.\n\n4.  **Conclude the Country:** The combination of these three specific annual events—National Day, Tiananmen Square Anniversary, and the Lunar New Year—uniquely points to China.\n\nI will now write a Python script to formally present this conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport calendar\n\ndef identify_country_from_trends():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the described Google Trends data to identify the country.\n    The analysis is based on the timing of annual peaks for three unidentified events.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define the observed patterns from the graph.\n    # The keys are colors from the graph, and values are the approximate time of the annual peaks.\n    observed_peaks = {\n        \"Red Line\": \"Late January / Early February\",\n        \"Yellow Line\": \"Early October\",\n        \"Blue Line\": \"Early June\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Define major annual events for the hypothesized country (China).\n    chinese_annual_events = {\n        \"Lunar New Year\": \"Celebrated in January or February. This matches the Red Line.\",\n        \"National Day (Oct 1st)\": \"Celebrated in Early October. This matches the Yellow Line.\",\n        \"Tiananmen Square Anniversary (June 4th)\": \"Commemorated in Early June. This matches the Blue Line.\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 4: Print the reasoning and conclusion.\n    print(\"Analyzing the Google Trends graph:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Observation 1 (Red Line): Annual peaks in late January or early February.\")\n    print(\"Hypothesis: This corresponds to the Lunar New Year.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Observation 2 (Yellow Line): Sharp annual peaks in early October.\")\n    print(\"Hypothesis: This corresponds to a National Day on October 1st.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Observation 3 (Blue Line): Smaller, consistent annual peaks in early June.\")\n    print(\"Hypothesis: This corresponds to an anniversary on June 4th, like the Tiananmen Square Anniversary.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"The combination of these three significant annual events—Lunar New Year, National Day on October 1st, and the Tiananmen Square Anniversary on June 4th—points overwhelmingly to one country.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe country is China.\")\n\n# Execute the analysis and print the result.\nidentify_country_from_trends()\nprint(\"<<<China>>>\")\n\n```"
