    "Based on the visual evidence from the image sequence L, M, and N, I will deduce the biological process being shown.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n1.  **Analyze Image L:** This panel shows an elongated, multi-cellular filament. This is characteristic of organisms like fungi or filamentous algae. The cells are arranged in a line, separated by cross-walls (septa). An arrowhead points to one of these septa.\n2.  **Analyze Image M:** This panel shows the same filament at a later time. At the location near the septum from panel L, a small, hemispherical bulge has formed on the side of the filament. The arrowhead now points to this emerging structure.\n3.  **Analyze Image N:** This panel shows a yet later stage. The bulge from panel M has clearly elongated and is now forming a new filament that extends away from the original one. This is a new branch.\n4.  **Synthesize the process:** The sequence L → M → N depicts a time-lapse of a new branch forming from an existing filament. This process is known as **branching**, or more specifically in the context of fungi, **hyphal branching**. It is a fundamental mechanism for vegetative growth and the formation of a complex network (mycelium).\n\nNow, I will provide a Python code to print this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef identify_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  Analyzes the image sequence to identify the biological process.\n  \n  The images show:\n  - L: A multi-cellular filament.\n  - M: The beginning of a lateral outgrowth (a bulge) from a cell.\n  - N: The outgrowth has elongated into a new branch.\n  \n  This sequence clearly demonstrates the formation of a new branch from an existing filament.\n  \"\"\"\n  process = \"Hyphal branching\"\n  explanation = \"The image sequence depicts hyphal branching, a process where a new filament (hypha) grows from the side of an existing one in a fungus or similar organism. Panel L shows the filament before branching, M shows the initial budding, and N shows the developed branch.\"\n  \n  print(f\"The process being depicted is: {process}\")\n  print(f\"Explanation: {explanation}\")\n\nidentify_process()\n```\n<<<Hyphal branching>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
