    "To determine the Roman numeral for the circled notes in measure 8, we need to perform a harmonic analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Key:** The piece is Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397. The key signature is one flat, and the title confirms the tonic is D minor.\n2.  **Identify the Notes:** The circle covers the harmony on beats 3 and 4 of measure 8. We will focus on the clear harmony established on beat 3.\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** A chord containing the notes A, C, and E is held.\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** An arpeggiated figure consisting of the notes F, C, and A is played.\n3.  **Combine and Spell the Chord:** Combining all the notes gives us F, A, C, and E. When stacked in thirds starting from F, this spells an F major seventh chord (F-A-C-E).\n4.  **Determine the Inversion:** The lowest note played is A in the left hand. Since A is the third of the F major seventh chord, the chord is in first inversion (Fmaj7/A).\n5.  **Find the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   In the key of D minor, the note F is the third scale degree (the mediant).\n    *   A major chord built on the mediant is represented by the Roman numeral **III**.\n    *   The chord is a seventh chord, and it is in first inversion. For a seventh chord, first inversion is indicated by the figured bass symbols **⁶⁵**.\n    *   Therefore, the complete Roman numeral is **III⁶⁵**.\n\nThe following Python code will outline this analysis and print the final result.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_mozart_chord():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the specified chord from Mozart's Fantasy in D minor and provides the Roman numeral.\n    \"\"\"\n    key = \"D minor\"\n    measure = 8\n    beat = 3\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify the notes in the chord\n    left_hand_notes = [\"A\", \"C\", \"E\"]\n    right_hand_notes = [\"F\", \"C\", \"A\"]\n    all_notes = sorted(list(set(left_hand_notes + right_hand_notes))) # ['A', 'C', 'E', 'F']\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the chord's root, quality, and inversion\n    chord_root = \"F\"\n    chord_quality = \"Major Seventh\"\n    bass_note = \"A\"\n    chord_name = f\"{chord_root} {chord_quality} ({chord_root}maj7)\"\n    inversion = \"First inversion\"\n    inversion_figure = \"6/5\" # Using unicode for superscript in final print\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the Roman numeral in the key of D minor\n    scale_degree = \"III\" # F is the 3rd degree of D minor\n    numeral_quality = \"Major\" # A chord on the 3rd degree of minor is major\n\n    # Use unicode for superscript numbers\n    superscript_6 = \"\\u2076\"\n    superscript_5 = \"\\u2075\"\n    final_roman_numeral = f\"{scale_degree}{superscript_6}{superscript_5}\"\n    \n    # Print the step-by-step analysis\n    print(\"Analysis of the chord in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor:\")\n    print(f\"1.
