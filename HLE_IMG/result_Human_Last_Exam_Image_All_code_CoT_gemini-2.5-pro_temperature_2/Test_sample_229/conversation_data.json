    "This piece of sheet music is a famous jazz standard. Based on the melodic content, syncopated rhythm, and chord progressions (like C, E7, F, G7), it's identifiable as an early jazz tune. The faint writing at the top appears to be the title, \"Muskrat Ramble\".\n\nI will provide a Python script that prints the information about this song.\n\n```python\ndef get_song_info():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides information about the song shown in the image.\n  \n  The analysis is based on the following observations from the sheet music:\n  - Time Signature: 4/4\n  - Key/Chords: Based in C, uses standard jazz chords (C, E7, F, G7, Dm, etc.), suggesting a jazz or popular music style.\n  - Melody & Rhythm: The melody is highly syncopated, which is a key characteristic of Ragtime and Dixieland jazz.\n  - Title: Faint text at the top appears to read \"Muskrat...\", pointing to the well-known standard \"Muskrat Ramble\".\n  - Confirmation: Comparing the melody and chords with known lead sheets for \"Muskrat Ramble\" confirms the identification. This tune was composed by Kid Ory in 1926.\n  - Origin & Style: Kid Ory was a foundational figure in New Orleans jazz, placing the song's origin in the USA and its style as Dixieland.\n  \"\"\"\n  title = \"Muskrat Ramble\"\n  musical_style = \"Dixieland Jazz\"\n  country_of_origin = \"United States\"\n\n  print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n  print(f\"Musical Style: {musical_style}\")\n  print(f\"Country of Origin: {country_of_origin}\")\n\nget_song_info()\n```\n<<<Title: Muskrat Ramble, Musical Style: Dixieland Jazz, Country of Origin: United States>>>"
