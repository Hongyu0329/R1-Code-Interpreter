    "Here is my plan to identify the rock specimens:\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:** I will observe its color, texture, and overall appearance. It is a reddish, porous rock with many visible holes (vesicles). This is characteristic of an extrusive volcanic rock that cooled rapidly, trapping gas bubbles. It looks like Scoria.\n2.  **Analyze Specimen I:** I will examine this specimen. It appears to be composed of angular fragments of other rocks cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This clastic texture, with angular clasts, is the defining feature of Breccia.\n3.  **Analyze Specimen J:** I will look at its light color and very fine, frothy texture. It's extremely porous and appears low-density. This is a classic example of Pumice, a volcanic glass so vesicular it can often float on water.\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:** I will observe the large, interlocking crystals. This coarse-grained, crystalline texture indicates that the rock cooled slowly deep underground (intrusive). The large crystal size is characteristic of a Pegmatite.\n5.  **Synthesize and Code:** I will compile these identifications into a Python script. The script will use a dictionary to map each specimen letter to its identified rock type and then print the results in a clear and organized format.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary to store the identification of each specimen.\n    specimen_identifications = {\n        'H': 'Scoria - A vesicular (holey) volcanic rock formed from gas-rich lava. The reddish color is due to iron oxidation.',\n        'I': 'Breccia - A sedimentary or fault-related rock composed of broken, angular fragments of minerals or rock cemented together.',\n        'J': 'Pumice - A very light and porous volcanic rock formed when gas-rich, frothy lava cools rapidly.',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite - An intrusive igneous rock known for its very large, interlocking crystals that form from the slow cooling of magma.'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    print(\"=\" * 30)\n    for specimen, identification in specimen_identifications.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {specimen}: {identification}\")\n    print(\"=\" * 30)\n\n# Run the identification function\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<\nH: Scoria\nI: Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite\n>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
