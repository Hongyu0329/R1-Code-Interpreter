# The final answer is a single letter, representing the matching image.
# Based on visual analysis, the unique feather pattern irregularity on the
# upper back of the target bird is identically matched in image C.

# Step 1: Identify a unique feature in the Target image.
# Observation: There is a small, distinct disruption in the scalloped feather pattern
# on the upper right side of the bird's back.

# Step 2: Scan images A through I for this unique feature.
# Observation A: Pattern is different; no matching disruption.
# Observation B: Pattern is very regular; no matching disruption.
# Observation C: A disruption matching the target's in shape and location is visible.
# Observation D: Different angle, but the pattern appears more uniform.
# Observation E: Pattern is very regular; no matching disruption.
# Observation F: Image is too dark to clearly discern fine patterns.
# Observation G: Pattern is very regular; no matching disruption.
# Observation H: Color and pattern texture are different.
# Observation I: Pattern is very regular; no matching disruption.

# Step 3: Conclude which image is a match.
# The bird in image C shows the same unique identifier as the target bird.

correct_image = 'C'

# The task is to output the final answer directly.
