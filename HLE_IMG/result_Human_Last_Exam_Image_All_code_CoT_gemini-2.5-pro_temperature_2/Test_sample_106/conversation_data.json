    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Overall Reaction:**\n    The reaction shows a tetracyclic triterpenoid alcohol (the starting material) reacting under acidic conditions (catalytic HCl) and heat (110Â°C). This results in a rearranged alkene (the product) and water. The chemical formula of the product is given as C30H50. The reaction is described as involving a number of [1,2] shifts. This points towards a carbocation-mediated rearrangement, specifically a Wagner-Meerwein type \"backbone rearrangement\" common in terpene chemistry.\n\n2.  **Examine the Structures and Identify Key Features:**\n    *   **Starting Material (SM):** It's a tetracyclic alcohol. The key features for the rearrangement are the alcohol group at C-3, a gem-dimethyl group (two methyls on the same carbon) at C-4, and several methyl (CH3) and hydrogen (H) substituents on the ring junctions (C-5, C-8, C-9, C-10, C-13, C-14).\n    *   **Product (P):** The product is also a tetracyclic molecule but with a rearranged carbon skeleton and a new double bond. Crucially, the problem asks to identify the substituents at five specific positions labeled 1 through 5. Position 1 is on the same carbon as another methyl group, indicating that the C-4 gem-dimethyl group seems to be preserved.\n\n3.  **Resolve the Mechanistic Conflict:**\n    There's a potential conflict in the problem description:\n    *   A typical backbone rearrangement initiated by a carbocation at C-3 (formed by loss of H2O) would start with a `1,2-methyl shift` from C-4 to C-3. This would mean the C-4 carbon loses one of its methyl groups.\n    *   However, the product drawing at position '1' strongly implies that the gem-dimethyl group at C-4 is unchanged, as '1' is clearly one of the two methyls. For it to be H would be inconsistent with chemical drawing conventions. Thus, `1 = CH3`.\n    *   To resolve this, we must assume a different initiation step. A `1,3-hydride shift` from C-5 to C-3 would move the positive charge to C-5 without altering C-4. While less common than 1,2-shifts, this allows the C-4 gem-dimethyl group to be preserved, consistent with the product drawing. After this initiation, the rest of the cascade can proceed as a standard series of `1,2-shifts`. This seems the most logical interpretation.\n\n4.  **Trace the Rearrangement Cascade (Path D from my thought process):**\n    *   **Step 0 (Initiation):** The alcohol at C-3 is protonated and leaves as water, forming a carbocation at C-3 (C3+).\n    *   **Step 1 (1,3-H Shift):** A hydrogen atom from C-5 migrates to C-3. The positive charge is now at C-5 (C5+), which is a stable tertiary carbocation. *C-4 is untouched, so position `1` is a methyl group (`CH3`).*\n    *   **Step 2 (1,2-Me Shift):** The methyl group on C-10 migrates to C-5. The positive charge moves to C-10 (C10+). *The original C-10 methyl is now at C-5.*\n    *   **Step 3 (1,2-H Shift):** The hydrogen atom from C-9 migrates to C-10. The positive charge moves to C-9 (C9+). *The original C-10 now bears a hydrogen. This corresponds to position `2`. Therefore, `2 = H`.*\n    *   **Step 4 (1,2-Me Shift):** The methyl group from C-8 migrates to C-9. The positive charge moves to C-8 (C8+). *C-9 now has a new methyl group. This corresponds to position `3`. Therefore, `3 = CH3`.*\n    *   **Step 5 (1,2-Me Shift):** The methyl group from C-14 migrates to C-8. The positive charge moves to C-14 (C14+). *C-8 now has a new methyl group. This corresponds to position `4`. Therefore, `4 = CH3`.*\n    *   **Step 6 (1,2-H Shift):** The hydrogen atom from C-13 migrates to C-14. The positive charge moves to C-13 (C13+). *C-14 now bears a hydrogen. This corresponds to position `5`. Therefore, `5 = H`.*\n    *   **Step 7 (Termination):** The final C-13 cation loses a proton from an adjacent carbon (like C-12 or C-17, or from the migrated C-18 methyl group) to form the final stable alkene product. The exact termination point does not affect the identities of substituents 1-5.\n\n5.  **Summarize the Results:**\n    Based on the step-by-step trace of the rearrangement:\n    *   1 = **CH3** (from the preserved gem-dimethyl group at C-4)\n    *   2 = **H** (migrated from C-9 to C-10)\n    *   3 = **CH3** (migrated from C-8 to C-9)\n    *   4 = **CH3** (migrated from C-14 to C-8)\n    *   5 = **H** (migrated from C-13 to C-14)\n\n6.  **Generate the Python Code:**\n    The final step is to write a simple Python script to print the answer in the required format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rearrangement():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the identity of the substituents at\n    positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the final product of the rearrangement reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    substituents = {\n        '1': 'CH3',\n        '2': 'H',\n        '3': 'CH3',\n        '4': 'CH3',\n        '5': 'H'\n    }\n    \n    output = []\n    for i in range(1, 6):\n        key = str(i)\n        value = substituents[key]\n        output.append(f\"{key} = {value}\")\n        \n    print(\", \".join(output))\n\nsolve_rearrangement()\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
