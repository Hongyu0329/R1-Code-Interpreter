    "To determine the caries classification for the lesion shown in the image, I will follow these steps:\n1.  **Analyze the image:** I will identify the location of the carious lesion on the tooth. The image shows decay on the chewing surface of a posterior tooth (molar or premolar), specifically in the grooves and pits, and adjacent to an existing restoration.\n2.  **Recall G.V. Black's Classification:** This is the most common system for classifying carious lesions based on their location on the tooth surface.\n3.  **Match the lesion to the classification:** I will compare the location identified in step 1 with the definitions in G.V. Black's system to find the correct classification. The decay is on the occlusal surface, which corresponds to a specific class.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** The code will encapsulate this logic, defining the lesion's characteristics and the classification system, then print the result.\n\n```python\ndef classify_caries_lesion():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the characteristics of a tooth lesion from an image and provides its G.V. Black classification.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the characteristics observed in the image.\n    # The lesion is located on the chewing surface of a back tooth, within the natural pits and fissures.\n    # There is also an existing filling, and the decay is around it (recurrent caries).\n    lesion_location = \"pits and fissures on the occlusal surface of a posterior tooth\"\n\n    # Step 2: Define G.V. Black's classification system.\n    classification_system = {\n        \"Class I\": \"Lesions in pits and fissures on the occlusal surfaces of molars and premolars.\",\n        \"Class II\": \"Lesions on the proximal (in-between) surfaces of molars and premolars.\",\n        \"Class III\": \"Lesions on the proximal surfaces of incisors and canines that do not involve the incisal angle.\",\n        \"Class IV\": \"Lesions on the proximal surfaces of incisors and canines that do involve the incisal angle.\",\n        \"Class V\": \"Lesions on the gingival third (near the gumline) of the facial or lingual surfaces.\",\n        \"Class VI\": \"Lesions on the incisal edges of anterior teeth or the cusp tips of posterior teeth.\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Match the lesion's location to the correct classification.\n    # The lesion's location matches the description for Class I.\n    final_classification = \"Class I\"\n\n    # Step 4: Print the reasoning and the result.\n    print(\"Based on the image, the analysis is as follows:\")\n    print(f\"1.
