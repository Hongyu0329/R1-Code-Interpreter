    "To determine the molecular formula of the product, we must follow the three-step reaction sequence provided in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Starting Material to Intermediate 1**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is a bicyclic lactam. Let's determine its molecular formula by counting the atoms.\n    *   Carbons (C): There are 7 carbons in the bicyclic core (including the carbonyl carbon), 1 carbon in the trifluoromethyl (CF₃) group, and 8 carbons in the *p*-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group (6 in the benzene ring, 1 in the CH₂ linker, and 1 in the OCH₃ group). This gives a total of 7 + 1 + 8 = 16 carbons. Re-evaluating the structure provided, a more likely structure is a known bicyclic lactam, the Vince lactam skeleton (`2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one`), substituted with a CF₃ and a PMB group. Let's systematically count the atoms for `6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-(p-methoxybenzyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one`: C: 15, H: 14, F: 3, N: 1, O: 2. The molecular formula is C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂.\n*   **Reaction:** The reagent is Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in acetonitrile (ACN) and water. CAN is a common oxidizing agent used specifically for the deprotection of *p*-methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers and amines. The PMB group (C₈H₉O) is removed from the nitrogen atom and replaced by a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The net change in the molecular formula is the removal of a C₈H₈O fragment.\n    *   Formula of Intermediate 1 = C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂ - C₈H₈O = C₇H₆F₃NO.\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate 1 to Intermediate 2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Intermediate 1 is treated with Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂) in methanol (MeOH). This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction.\n*   **Transformation:** This reaction selectively reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the molecule. The lactam carbonyl (C=O) is generally unreactive under these conditions. Hydrogenation adds two hydrogen atoms across the double bond.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The formula is updated by adding H₂.\n    *   Formula of Intermediate 2 = C₇H₆F₃NO + H₂ = C₇H₈F₃NO.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate 2 to Product**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Intermediate 2 is heated with strong acid (4 N HCl at 70 °C).\n*   **Transformation:** These conditions cause the hydrolysis of the lactam (a cyclic amide). The amide bond within the bicyclic system is broken by the addition of one molecule of water (H₂O). This opens the ring to form an amino acid derivative.\n*   **Product:** The formula is updated by adding H₂O.\n    *   Formula of Product = C₇H₈F₃NO + H₂O = **C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂**.\n\nFinal verification:\n*   Start: C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂\n*   Step 1 (PMB deprotection): - C₈H₈O -> C₇H₆F₃NO\n*   Step 2 (Hydrogenation): + H₂ -> C₇H₈F₃NO\n*   Step 3 (Lactam hydrolysis): + H₂O -> C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂\n\n<<<C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂>>>"
