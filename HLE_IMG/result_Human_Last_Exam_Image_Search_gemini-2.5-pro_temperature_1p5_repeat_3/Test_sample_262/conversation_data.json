    "To determine which of the depicted complexes are expected to show shorter lifetimes, we need to analyze their chemical structures and relate them to known degradation mechanisms and stability trends for iridium(III) emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs).\n\n### **Structural Analysis**\n\nAll four complexes share the same general structure: `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+PF6-`.\n*   The ancillary `N^N` ligand is the same in all four complexes: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (`dtbbpy`).\n*   The counter-ion is hexafluorophosphate (`PF6-`) for all.\n*   The difference lies in the cyclometalating `C^N` ligand, which is a substituted 2-phenylpyridine in each case. Each complex has two identical `C^N` ligands.\n\nLet's examine the fluorine substitution pattern on the phenyl ring of the `C^N` ligands:\n*   **Complex 1:** The ligand is 2-(4,5-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has **two** fluorine atoms per ligand.\n*   **Complex 2:** The ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (commonly known as `FIrpic`). It has **two** fluorine atoms per ligand.\n*   **Complex 3:** The ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine (or an isomer). It has **one** fluorine atom per ligand.\n*   **Complex 4:** The ligand is 2-(2,5-difluorophenyl)pyridine (or an isomer). It has **two** fluorine atoms per ligand.\n\n### **Relating Structure to Lifetime**\n\nThe stability and, consequently, the operational lifetime of these emitters in LECs can be influenced by the number and position of fluorine substituents.\n\n1.  **Effect of Fluorine Content:** Research has shown a correlation between the number of fluorine atoms and the device lifetime. A key study on a series of similar green-emitting iridium complexes in LECs demonstrated that a shorter device lifetime is obtained when the fluorine content of the emitter is increased. This degradation is thought to be related to the chemical instability of C-F bonds under device operation, potentially leading to defluorination reactions.\n\n2.  **Applying the Trend:** We can count the total number of fluorine atoms on the two `C^N` ligands for each complex:\n    *   **Complex 1:** 2 F/ligand × 2 ligands = 4 F atoms total.\n    *   **Complex 2:** 2 F/ligand × 2 ligands = 4 F atoms total.\n    *   **Complex 3:** 1 F/ligand × 2 ligands = 2 F atoms total.\n    *   **Complex 4:** 2 F/ligand × 2 ligands = 4 F atoms total.\n\nBased on the established trend that a higher fluorine content leads to shorter lifetimes, complexes with more fluorine atoms are expected to be less stable. In this set, Complexes 1, 2, and 4 each have four fluorine atoms, while Complex 3 has only two.\n\nTherefore, Complexes 1, 2, and 4 are expected to exhibit shorter lifetimes compared to Complex 3.\n\n<<<L>>>"
