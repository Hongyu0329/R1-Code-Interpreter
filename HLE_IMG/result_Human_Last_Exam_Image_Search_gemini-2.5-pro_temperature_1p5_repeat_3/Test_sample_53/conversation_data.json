    "The figure leaving the chariot is **King Oenomaus of Pisa**.\n\nThis Apulian red-figure vase, likely a pelike dating to around 360-350 B.C., depicts the dramatic conclusion of the Greek myth of Pelops and Hippodamia.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the scene and the figures shown:\n*   **The Fallen Figure:** The man on the ground is King Oenomaus. An oracle foretold that he would be killed by his son-in-law, so he challenged all of his daughter Hippodamia's suitors to a deadly chariot race, which he always won until Pelops. The scene shows the moment after Pelops has won the race, and Oenomaus has been thrown from his own sabotaged chariot and killed.\n*   **The Chariot's Occupants:** The figures in the victorious chariot are Pelops and Hippodamia. Pelops, the suitor, is the driver, identifiable by his Phrygian cap and patterned sleeve, which signifies his origin from Asia Minor. The draped female figure next to him is Hippodamia, his new bride, whom he has won the right to marry.\n*   **The Winged Figure:** The small, winged figure hovering above is likely Nike, the goddess of victory, or sometimes identified as Eros, signifying the triumph of Pelops.\n\nIn the myth, Pelops won by convincing Oenomaus's charioteer, Myrtilus, to replace the bronze linchpins of the king's chariot with wax ones. During the race, the wheels flew off, and Oenomaus was dragged to his death by his horses. The vase uses narrative compression, a common technique in Greek art, to show the result of the race—Oenomaus dead on the ground—as the victors, Pelops and Hippodamia, ride past.\n\n<<<Oenomaus"
