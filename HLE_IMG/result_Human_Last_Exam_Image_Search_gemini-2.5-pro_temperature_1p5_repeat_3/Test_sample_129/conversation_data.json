    "This protein is **Otubain-1 (OTUB1)**, a human deubiquitinating enzyme.\n\nThis enzyme is a member of the ovarian tumor (OTU) superfamily of cysteine proteases. The image displays the crystal structure of human OTUB1, which is often referenced in scientific literature and protein databases with the PDB ID 2ZFY.\n\n**Function and Significance:**\n*   **Deubiquitination:** OTUB1's primary function is to remove ubiquitin molecules from proteins. Specifically, it shows a preference for cleaving Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains. This process is crucial for regulating protein stability and signaling pathways.\n*   **Immune Response:** It is involved in regulating the immune system, particularly in mediating lymphocyte antigen responsiveness.\n*   **Cellular Processes:** OTUB1 participates in a variety of cellular functions, including the DNA damage response, cell signaling pathways like TGF-beta and NF-kappaB, and protein degradation. Its interactions with other proteins link it to processes like RNA processing and cell morphology.\n*   **Disease Relevance:** Due to its role in fundamental cellular processes, abnormal expression or function of OTUB1 has been associated with various diseases, including several types of cancer.\n\nThe structure shown reveals the OTU domain, which is characteristic of this family of enzymes and responsible for its catalytic activity.\n\n<<<Otubain-1 (OTUB1)>>>"
