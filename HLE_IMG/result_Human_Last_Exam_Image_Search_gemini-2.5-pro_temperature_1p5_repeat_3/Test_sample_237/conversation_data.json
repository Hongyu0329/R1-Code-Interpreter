    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. It is an insect, specifically a species of longhorn beetle.\n\nBased on its appearance, the animal is a **Red-brown Longhorn Beetle**.\n\nThe scientific name of this beetle is ***Stictoleptura rubra***.\n\nThis species exhibits significant sexual dimorphism, meaning the males and females have different appearances. The insect in the photo, with its black head and thorax (the part behind the head) and reddish-brown wing cases (elytra), is a male. The females of this species are typically a more uniform reddish-brown or reddish-orange color over their entire body.\n\n*Stictoleptura rubra* is found throughout Europe, Russia, and North Africa. The larvae of this beetle develop in the dead wood of coniferous trees like pines and firs, while the adults are often seen on flowers, where they feed on nectar and pollen during the summer months.\n\n<<<*Stictoleptura rubra*>>>"
