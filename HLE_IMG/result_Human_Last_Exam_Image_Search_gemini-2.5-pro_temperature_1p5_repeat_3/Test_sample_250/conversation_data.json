    "The jazz standard in the image is titled **\"Tune Up\"** and was composed by **Miles Davis**.\n\nThis piece was first recorded by Davis on May 19, 1953, and appeared on his album *Blue Haze*, released in 1956. It has since become a popular jazz standard, known for its use of ii-V-I progressions that modulate through different key centers. While credited to Miles Davis, some sources suggest that the composition was actually written by Eddie Vinson. \"Tune Up\" has been recorded by numerous other notable jazz artists, including Sonny Rollins, Wes Montgomery, and John Coltrane.\n\n<<<\"Tune Up\" by Miles Davis>>>"
