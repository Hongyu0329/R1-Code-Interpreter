    "Based on visual inspection of the graph, the synchronized bursts, which are represented by the dense vertical bands of firing activity across many electrodes, occur at the following approximate timestamps:\n*   Burst 1: ~3 s\n*   Burst 2: ~11 s\n*   Burst 3: ~17 s\n*   Burst 4: ~26 s\n*   Burst 5: ~35 s\n*   Burst 6: ~45 s\n\nTo calculate the average inter-burst interval, the time difference between each consecutive burst is determined:\n*   Interval 1: 11 s - 3 s = 8 s\n*   Interval 2: 17 s - 11 s = 6 s\n*   Interval 3: 26 s - 17 s = 9 s\n*   Interval 4: 35 s - 26 s = 9 s\n*   Interval 5: 45 s - 35 s = 10 s\n\nThe average of these intervals is calculated as follows:\nAverage inter-burst interval = (8 + 6 + 9 + 9 + 10) / 5 = 42 / 5 = 8.4 s.\n\nTo two significant figures, the average inter-burst interval is 8.4 s.\n\n<<<8.4 s>>>"
