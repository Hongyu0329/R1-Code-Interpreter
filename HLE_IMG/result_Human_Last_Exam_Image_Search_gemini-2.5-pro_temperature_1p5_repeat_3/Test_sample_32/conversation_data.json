    "The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that helps distinguish them at a glance is the curvature of the seta, the stalk that supports the capsule.\n\n*   ***Grimmia montana*** has a **straight seta**. This results in an erect capsule. Capsules in this species are described as rare.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta*** is characterized by its **arcuate (curved) seta**.\n\nTherefore, the most evident distinguishing feature of the sporophyte is a straight seta in *Grimmia montana* versus a curved one in *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n<<<The primary distinguishing feature of the sporophyte, when present, is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a curved or arcuate seta.>>>"
