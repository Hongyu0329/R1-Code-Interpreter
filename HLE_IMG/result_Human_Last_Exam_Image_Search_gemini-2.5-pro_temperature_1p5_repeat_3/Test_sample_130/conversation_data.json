    "The provided image displays the emission spectrum of the element **Uranium** (U).\n\nEach element has a unique spectral fingerprint, emitting light at specific wavelengths when excited. This results in a series of bright lines, known as an emission spectrum, which can be used for identification. The complex pattern of numerous lines across the visible spectrum in the image is characteristic of heavy elements with intricate electron structures, such as uranium. Scientific databases and research papers confirm that the spectrum shown corresponds to that of uranium, which has a very complex spectrum with hundreds of emission lines. Specifically, uranium atoms have strong emission lines in both the green and blue/violet regions of the spectrum, which are prominent in the image provided. These spectral lines are so distinct that they can be used to determine the isotopic composition of a uranium sample.\n\n<<<Uranium>>>"
