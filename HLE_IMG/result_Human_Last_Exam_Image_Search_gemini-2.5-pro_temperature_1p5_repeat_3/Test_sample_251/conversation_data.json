    "To determine the longest R-R interval on the provided ECG rhythm strip, we need to analyze the grid and the waveform.\n\n**1. Understand the ECG Grid Calibration:**\nThe text at the top left of the ECG, \"25 mm/sec,\" indicates the paper speed. This is a standard setting where:\n*   Each small square (1 mm) on the horizontal axis represents 0.04 seconds.\n*   Each large square (5 mm) on the horizontal axis represents 0.2 seconds.\n\n**2. Identify the Longest R-R Interval:**\nBy visually scanning the entire rhythm strip, the most extended pause between two consecutive R-waves (the sharp, upward spikes of the QRS complex) is located on the fourth strip from the top, near the time marker `0:06:08`. The pause is between the third and fourth heartbeats on this line.\n\n**3. Measure and Calculate the Interval:**\nWe can measure this interval by counting the squares between the peaks of the two R-waves that frame the pause.\n*   The peak of the R-wave just before the long pause aligns with a thick vertical grid line.\n*   Counting from this point to the peak of the R-wave after the pause, we can count the number of large and small squares.\n*   The interval covers 8 full large squares and an additional 3 small squares.\n\nNow, we can calculate the duration in seconds:\n*   **Using large squares:** (8 large squares × 0.2 s/large square) + (3 small squares × 0.04 s/small square) = 1.6 s + 0.12 s = 1.72 s.\n*   **Using small squares:** Each large square contains 5 small squares. So, the total number of small squares is (8 × 5) + 3 = 43 small squares. The total duration is 43 small squares × 0.04 s/small square = 1.72 s.\n\nTherefore, the longest R-R interval on this rhythm strip is 1.72 seconds.\n\n<<<1.72>>>"
