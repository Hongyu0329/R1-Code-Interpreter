    "The circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, represent a **common-tone diminished seventh chord**.\n\nHere is a detailed analysis of the chord:\n*   **Key Signature:** The piece is in D minor.\n*   **Notes:** The notes in the arpeggiated figure in the right hand are F-natural, A, and C-sharp. These notes are played over a sustained D in the bass (left hand). The full collection of pitches is D, F, A, and C#.\n*   **Function:** This chord does not function in a traditional, dominant-to-tonic way. Instead, it serves to embellish the tonic D minor chord. It is built on the tonic pitch 'D', which is the \"common tone\" shared between the tonic chord and this diminished-seventh harmony. The other notes (F, A, and C#) create a colorful, non-functional chord that adds tension before resolving back to the tonic harmony in the subsequent passage.\n\nThis type of chord is labeled in Roman numeral analysis as **CT°7**. The \"CT\" stands for common-tone, and the \"°7\" indicates a fully-diminished seventh quality. It is considered a chromatic, non-functional harmony because its primary role is embellishment through voice-leading rather than driving the harmonic progression forward.\n\n<<<CT°7>>>"
