    "The artist of the painting is Dominique Appia. The painting is titled \"Entre les Trous de la MÃ©moire,\" which translates to \"Between the Gaps of Memory.\"\n\nThis surrealist artwork depicts a room with various impossible scenes viewed through its openings. On the left, a wall is missing, revealing a glacial landscape with a hot air balloon. A doorway on the right opens to a hallway flooded with seawater, with an ocean liner in the distance. In the room, a girl reads a book, while another pile of books is on fire in the fireplace.\n\n<<<Dominique Appia>>>"
