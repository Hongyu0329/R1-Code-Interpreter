    "The image displays a process occurring in a fungal hypha, which is a long, branching filamentous structure that is a primary mode of growth for most fungi. Specifically, the micrographs illustrate the process of **septal pore plugging** or **sealing**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of what is happening in the panels:\n*   **Structure:** The image shows a hypha, which is divided into compartments by cross-walls called septa. These septa typically have a central pore that allows cytoplasm and organelles to move between adjacent compartments, creating a syncytium (an interconnected network of cells).\n*   **Process:** The arrowheads in panels L, M, and N point to a septum where a closure mechanism is being activated. This process involves the progressive constriction and sealing of the septal pore. In filamentous fungi like Ascomycetes, this sealing is often a protective response to cellular injury, preventing the catastrophic loss of cytoplasm from the entire hyphal network if one part is damaged. It can also occur during normal development or aging.\n*   **Mechanism:** The plugging of septal pores can be achieved by specialized organelles called Woronin bodies, which are derived from peroxisomes and act as physical plugs. The sealing can also involve the accumulation of other proteins and materials to form a permanent plug. The constriction itself is an active process, involving a contractile ring of proteins like actin, similar to cytokinesis (cell division) in other organisms.\n*   **Consequences:** As seen in panels M and N, the sealing of the compartment can lead to changes in internal pressure, causing the bulging of the cell wall and altering the direction of growth.\n\nIn summary, the image captures a crucial cellular mechanism in filamentous fungi for compartmentalizing their hyphae, either to protect against damage or as part of their development.\n\n<<<septal pore plugging>>>"
