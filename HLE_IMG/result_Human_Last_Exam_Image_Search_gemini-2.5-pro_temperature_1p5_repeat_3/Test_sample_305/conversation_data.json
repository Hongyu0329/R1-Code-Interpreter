    "The product featured in the advertisement is from the French cosmetics company **Bourjois**.\n\nThe advertisement in the image is part of a larger campaign for Bourjois's line of cosmetics, most famously their \"Evening in Paris\" (Soir de Paris) perfume, face powder, and lipstick. These products were marketed in Britain during World War II with slogans that tied beauty and femininity to the war effort. The campaign suggested that maintaining one's appearance was a patriotic duty and essential for morale.\n\nDuring the war, as women took on factory jobs traditionally held by men, the British government and companies like Bourjois promoted the idea that looking feminine was crucial for national morale. Advertisements framed cosmetics not as a luxury, but as an essential part of a woman's contribution to winning the war, helping her feel confident and feminine while performing demanding industrial work. The management at some munitions factories even provided lipsticks to female workers to boost morale.\n\n<<<Bourjois>>>"
