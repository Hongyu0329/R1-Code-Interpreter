    "Here are the identifications of the rock specimens:\n\n*   **H is Scoria:** This specimen is a type of volcanic rock characterized by its high number of vesicles (the small cavities). Its reddish-brown color is due to the oxidation of iron during its formation. Scoria is formed when gas-rich lava is ejected from a volcano.\n\n*   **I is Volcanic Breccia or Tuff Breccia:** This rock is composed of angular fragments of other rocks that have been cemented together. When these fragments are of volcanic origin, the rock is termed a volcanic breccia. More specifically, it can be called a tuff breccia when the fragments are embedded in a matrix of volcanic ash.\n\n*   **J is Pumice:** Similar to scoria, pumice is a volcanic rock with a very high porosity. However, pumice is typically light-colored (white to light-gray). It forms from the rapid cooling and depressurization of magma, which creates a frothy, glassy structure. Due to its many trapped air pockets, pumice is famously low in density and can often float on water.\n\n*   **K is Pegmatite:** This is an intrusive igneous rock, meaning it cooled slowly deep within the Earth's crust. This slow cooling process allows for the formation of very large, interlocking crystals, which are clearly visible in the specimen. While having a mineral composition similar to granite (primarily quartz and feldspar), pegmatites are distinguished by their exceptionally large crystal size, generally defined as being larger than 2.5 cm.\n\n<<<H is Scoria, I is Volcanic Breccia, J is Pumice, K is Pegmatite>>>"
