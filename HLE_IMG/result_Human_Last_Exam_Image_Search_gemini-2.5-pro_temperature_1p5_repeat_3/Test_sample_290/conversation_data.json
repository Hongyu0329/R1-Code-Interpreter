    "Based on the visual evidence in the image, this photo was taken at Carkeek Park in Seattle, Washington.\n\nThe key features that identify this location are the chain-link fence in the foreground, the dark sand and gravel beach, the gentle curve of the shoreline, and the forested bluff in the distance across the water. Carkeek Park is well-known for the railroad tracks that run parallel to the beach, separated by a chain-link fence. Visitors typically cross a pedestrian bridge to get to the waterfront. The view in the photograph, looking slightly down and through the fence, is consistent with the perspective from or near this pedestrian overpass.\n\nThe beach at Carkeek is composed of sand and rock, which appears dark, matching the image. While bonfires are officially sanctioned at other Seattle beaches like Golden Gardens and Alki Beach, Carkeek Park has a history of allowing them, sometimes in designated areas or during specific events like the Christmas Ships festival. The image captures a sunset over Puget Sound, a view for which Carkeek Park is also known. The distant landmass and the curve of the shoreline are consistent with the view looking north from Carkeek Park towards the area of Richmond Beach.\n\n<<<Carkeek Park, Seattle>>>"
