    "The knot depicted in the image is the 8₁₉ knot, also known as the true lover's knot. The Rasmussen invariant, often denoted as s(K), is a tool in knot theory that provides information about the four-dimensional surfaces that a knot can bound.\n\nFor the 8₁₉ knot, the Rasmussen s-invariant is -6. This value is derived from the knot's Khovanov homology, a more powerful invariant in knot theory. It's interesting to note that the 8₁₉ knot is the first non-obvious torus knot in the Rolfsen knot table, specifically the T(4,3) torus knot, and it is also equivalent to the pretzel knot P(3,3,-2).\n\nThe study of such knots and their invariants has applications in various scientific fields, including the synthesis of molecular knots in chemistry. In fact, the 8₁₉ knot is the most complex molecular knot that has been synthesized in a laboratory.\n\n<<<−6>>>"
