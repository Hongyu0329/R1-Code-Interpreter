The square ancient structure is likely the ruin of a historic fortified ranch or outpost ("fortin") from the 19th century, characteristic of the frontier architecture in Presidio County, Texas. While not a formally designated historic landmark based on available information, its location and form suggest it is a significant historical feature of the region.
