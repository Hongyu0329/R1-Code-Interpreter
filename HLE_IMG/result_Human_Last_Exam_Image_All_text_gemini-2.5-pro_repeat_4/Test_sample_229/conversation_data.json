    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to determine its title, musical style, and country of origin.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the General Characteristics of the Sheet Music**\n\n*   **Format:** The music is written as a \"lead sheet,\" which provides the main melody line and the corresponding chord symbols above the staff (e.g., C, E7, F, G7). This format is very common in jazz and popular music for improvisation and performance.\n*   **Instrumentation:** It's a single melody line in the treble clef, suggesting it could be played by instruments like the saxophone, trumpet, clarinet, or piano (right hand), or sung.\n*   **Time Signature and Tempo:** The time signature is 4/4, also known as common time. A tempo marking at the top appears to be \"Medium J=128\", indicating a moderate tempo.\n*   **Form:** The instructions \"TO GO OUT - TAKE D.S. TO CODA\" and the presence of a Segno sign (ùÑã) at the beginning and a Coda section at the end indicate a specific song structure (Dal Segno al Coda), a common practice in many musical genres, including jazz.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Musical Elements (Harmony and Melody)**\n\n*   **Harmony:** The chord progression uses typical jazz harmony. For example:\n    *   The sequence of `C | E7 | F | G7` is a variation on a standard progression. The `E7` is a secondary dominant chord.\n    *   The presence of chords like `D-` (Dm) and `G7` leading to `C` forms a ii-V-I progression, which is a cornerstone of jazz harmony.\n    *   The overall progression is a contrafact, meaning a new melody written over a pre-existing and well-known chord progression. In this case, it is based on the changes to George Gershwin's \"I Got Rhythm,\" commonly known as \"Rhythm changes\" in the jazz world.\n*   **Melody and Rhythm:**\n    *   The melody is highly syncopated, with many eighth notes, rests, and notes played off the beat. This rhythmic complexity is a defining feature of jazz.\n    *   The opening melodic phrase in the first two measures is very distinctive and recognizable to those familiar with the jazz repertoire.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Song Title, Style, and Origin**\n\n*   **Title:** The specific melody, combined with the \"Rhythm changes\" harmony, allows for the identification of the song. This is the famous jazz standard **\"Oleo,\"** composed by saxophonist Sonny Rollins. It was first recorded by the Miles Davis Quintet in 1954.\n*   **Musical Style:** \"Oleo\" is a quintessential example of the **Bebop** (or Hard Bop) style of jazz. Bebop, which emerged in the 1940s, is characterized by fast tempos, complex melodies, intricate harmonies, and a focus on virtuosic improvisation. \"Oleo\" embodies all these characteristics.\n*   **Country of Origin:** Jazz, and specifically the Bebop style, originated and developed in the **United States**. The composer, Sonny Rollins, is an American musician. Therefore, the country of origin of the song is the USA.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy analyzing the lead sheet format, the jazz-based chord progression, the syncopated bebop melody, and recognizing the specific tune, we can confidently identify the requested information.\n\n<<<Title: Oleo\nMusical Style: Jazz (specifically Bebop)\nCountry of Origin: USA>>>"
