    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the total area of the shaded regions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric figure and identify key parameters.**\nThe figure shows a large circular sector with its center at the bottom vertex (let's call it O). We are given two lengths: 34 and 17.\nThe line segment of length 34 is a radius of the circle. So, the radius R = 34.\nThe sector is divided into four smaller equal sectors by intermediate radii. The angle of each small sector is denoted by θ. The total angle of the large sector is 4θ.\nThere are right angle symbols in the figure. Let's focus on the leftmost one. It indicates a right-angled triangle formed by a radius (hypotenuse = 34), and a perpendicular line segment from a point on the arc to an adjacent radius. The length of this perpendicular segment is given as 17.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the angle θ.**\nLet's consider the leftmost small sector, defined by radii OP1 and OP2. Let P1 be the point on the leftmost arc endpoint. A perpendicular is drawn from P1 to the radius OP2, meeting at a point C. This forms a right-angled triangle OCP1.\nIn this triangle:\n- The hypotenuse is the radius OP1, so its length is 34.\n- The leg opposite to the angle θ (which is ∠P1OC or ∠P1OP2) is the segment P1C. The diagram indicates a related segment has length 17. The corresponding segment for the blue region is constructed from a chord of length 17. Let's examine the right-angled triangle on the far left of the main diagram. The hypotenuse is a radius of length 34. A leg has length 17. This triangle defines the angle θ.\nThe sine of the angle θ at the center O is the ratio of the opposite side (17) to the hypotenuse (34).\nsin(θ) = 17 / 34 = 1/2.\nThis implies that the angle θ = 30°, or π/6 radians.\n\n**Step 3: Define the shaded regions and formulate a plan to calculate their area.**\nThe total shaded area consists of four crescent-shaped regions. The figure's coloring and the note about an overlapping area can be interpreted in a complex way. However, the most straightforward interpretation is that the question asks for the total visible shaded area, which is the sum of the areas of these four identical crescent shapes. Let's calculate the area of one such shape and multiply it by four.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the area of one shaded crescent.**\nEach crescent is the area of a small sector of angle θ minus the area of a triangle.\n- **Area of one small sector:**\nThe formula for the area of a sector is (1/2)R²θ (with θ in radians) or (θ/360) * πR² (with θ in degrees).\nUsing θ = 30° and R = 34:\nArea_sector = (30/360) * π * (34)² = (1/12) * 1156π = 289π/3.\n\n- **Area of the triangle to be subtracted:**\nThe triangle is the right-angled triangle OCP1 discussed in Step 2.\nArea_triangle = (1/2) * base * height.\nThe base is OC and the height is P1C.\nWe know P1C = 17.\nThe base OC can be found using the Pythagorean theorem or trigonometry:\nOC = R * cos(θ) = 34 * cos(30°) = 34 * (√3 / 2) = 17√3.\nArea_triangle = (1/2) * OC * P1C = (1/2) * (17√3) * 17 = (289√3) / 2.\n\n- **Area of one crescent:**\nArea_crescent = Area_sector - Area_triangle\nArea_crescent = (289π/3) - (289√3 / 2).\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total shaded area.**\nThere are four identical crescent shapes. The total shaded area is 4 times the area of one crescent.\nTotal Area = 4 * Area_crescent\nTotal Area = 4 * [ (289π/3) - (289√3 / 2) ]\nTotal Area = (4 * 289π / 3) - (4 * 289√3 / 2)\nTotal Area = (1156π / 3) - (2 * 289√3)\nTotal Area = (1156/3)π - 578√3.\n\nThis is the final expression for the total area of the shaded regions.\n\nFinal Calculation (for numerical approximation):\nπ ≈ 3.14159, √3 ≈ 1.73205\nTotal Area ≈ (1156 * 3.14159 / 3) - (578 * 1.73205)\nTotal Area ≈ 1210.54 - 1000.125\nTotal Area ≈ 210.415\n\nThe exact answer is expressed in terms of π and √3.\n\n<<(1156/3)π - 578√3>>>"
