    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the opera from the provided sheet music.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Score's General Characteristics:**\n    *   **Instrumentation:** The score is for a large orchestra, including woodwinds (2 Flutes, 1 Oboe, English Horn, 1 Bassoon) and a full string section (First Violins, Second Violins, Violas, Cellos). The string parts are divided (`divisi`), with specific instructions for different desks (`1. Pult`, `2. Pult`, `die übrigen` - the others) and a solo viola part.\n    *   **Language:** The instrument names and performance directions are in German. For example: `gr. Fl.` (große Flöten - flutes), `Hob.` (Oboe), `engl. Horn` (English Horn), `Fag.` (Fagott - bassoon), `Br.` (Bratschen - violas), `mit Dämpfer` (with mute), and `Vorhang` (curtain). This points to an opera from a German-speaking country (Germany or Austria).\n    *   **Musical Style:** The harmony is very rich and chromatic, with many accidentals. The texture is dense, and the dynamic markings are detailed and nuanced (ranging from `pp` to `mf` with `diminuendo`). The use of `glissando` (`gliss.`) in the strings towards the end of the excerpt is also notable. These features are characteristic of the late-Romantic and early 20th-century musical period.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Clues:**\n    *   **\"Vorhang\":** The most significant clue is the word `(Vorhang)` written above the staff at rehearsal mark 1. \"Vorhang\" is German for \"curtain\". Combined with the information from the question that this music \"opens the second act\", it confirms we are looking at the very beginning of Act II, played as the curtain rises.\n    *   **Main Melody:** The principal melody, played by the `1. Pult` of the First Violins, is very distinctive. It starts on a G-sharp and ascends chromatically (G#, A#, B, C#) before falling back. This shimmering, ethereal theme is highly recognizable.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Deduce:**\n    *   We are looking for a late-Romantic/early 20th-century German-language opera.\n    *   The music is the prelude to the second act.\n    *   The opening theme is a memorable chromatic figure in the first violins.\n    *   Composers from this era and region known for this style include Richard Strauss, Alexander von Zemlinsky, Franz Schreker, and Erich Wolfgang Korngold.\n    *   By comparing this specific musical excerpt with the works of these composers, we can find a perfect match. The music is the beginning of Act II of Erich Wolfgang Korngold's opera *Die tote Stadt* (The Dead City), which premiered in 1920. The beautiful violin melody is a precursor to the famous aria \"Mariettas Lied zur Laute\" which appears shortly after in the act.\n\n4.  **Final Confirmation:** All elements in the score—the specific melody, the lush orchestration, the German markings, and the \"Vorhang\" instruction at the start of Act II—conclusively identify the work.\n\n<<<Die tote Stadt>>>"
