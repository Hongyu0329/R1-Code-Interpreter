The two major products, A and B, are regioisomers formed by the iron-catalyzed oxy-benzoyloxylation of styrene.

**Compound A** is 2-(tert-butoxy)-1-phenylethyl benzoate.
**Compound B** is 1-(tert-butoxy)-2-phenylethyl benzoate (also named 2-tert-butoxy-2-phenylethyl benzoate).

The structures are as follows:

**A:**
```
      O-C(=O)C6H5
      |
C6H5-CH-CH2-O-C(CH3)3
```

**B:**
```
      O-C(CH3)3
      |
C6H5-CH-CH2-O-C(=O)C6H5
```
