    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Venue:** The first step is to identify the building shown in the image. The image displays a building with distinctive architectural features, including red brickwork (some in a herringbone pattern), a tan stucco section with a decorative quatrefoil relief, and an open-air balcony with a white, crisscrossing 'X' pattern railing. A large semi-truck, typical for touring productions, is parked in front, suggesting it is a theater or concert hall.\n\n2.  **Use Visual Search to Pinpoint Location:** A reverse image search or a search based on the architectural details (\"red brick theater quatrefoil\") identifies the building as the **First Interstate Center for the Arts**, located in Spokane, Washington. Comparing the provided image with other photos of this venue online confirms the match.\n\n3.  **Find the Venue's Event Schedule:** Now that the venue is identified, the next step is to find its performance schedule for the date mentioned in the question.\n\n4.  **Look for the Specific Date:** The question asks for the musical artist who played at this venue on **October 12, 2023**. We need to search for the event calendar of the First Interstate Center for the Arts for this specific date.\n\n5.  **Identify the Performer:** By searching the venue's official website archives, ticketing sites (like Ticketmaster), or music event databases (like Bandsintown or Songkick) for events at the First Interstate Center for the Arts on October 12, 2023, we can find the performer. The event listed for that night was the **\"Goo Goo Dolls - The Big Night Out Tour\"**.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** Based on the venue identification and the event schedule for the specified date, the musical artist that played there was the Goo Goo Dolls.\n\n<<<Goo Goo Dolls>>>"
