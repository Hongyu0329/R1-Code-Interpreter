    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to answer the question.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the plant in the image.**\nThe image displays the foliage of a woody shrub. The key features are:\n*   **Leaves:** The leaves are dark green, glossy, and have an elliptical or lanceolate (lance-shaped) shape.\n*   **Venation:** The most striking characteristic is the very prominent, reticulated (net-like) pattern of the veins. These veins are a much lighter color, appearing whitish or silvery-green, creating a strong contrast with the dark green leaf blade.\n*   **Arrangement:** The leaves appear to be arranged in opposite pairs or in whorls around the stem.\n*   **Other features:** In the background of one of the cropped images, small, dark, round structures are visible, which could be flower buds or old fruit capsules.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the plant species.**\nThe combination of these features, particularly the unique and conspicuous reticulated venation on a shrub-like plant, points towards a species in the genus *Veronica*, specifically from the group of species native to New Zealand that were formerly classified in the genus *Hebe*.\n\nA search for shrubs with these distinct leaf markings leads to a specific species: *Veronica bishopiana* (formerly known as *Hebe bishopiana*). This plant is famous for its decorative foliage, which perfectly matches the leaves shown in the picture. The prominent, pale, net-like veins are a key identifying feature of this species.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the endemic location of the identified plant.**\nThe question asks for the island to which this plant is endemic. \"Endemic\" means the plant is native and restricted to a certain place.\n*   Botanical sources, such as the New Zealand Plant Conservation Network and various horticultural encyclopedias, confirm that *Veronica bishopiana* is endemic to New Zealand.\n*   More specifically, its natural habitat is restricted to the northern part of the North Island of New Zealand, primarily in the WaitƒÅkere Ranges and along the coast just north of there.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the final answer.**\nBased on the identification of the plant as *Veronica bishopiana*, its endemic range is the North Island of New Zealand. Therefore, the name of the island is the North Island.\n\n<<<North Island>>>"
