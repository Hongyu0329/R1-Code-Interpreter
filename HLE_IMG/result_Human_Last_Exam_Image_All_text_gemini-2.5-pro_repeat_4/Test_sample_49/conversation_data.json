    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Circuit**\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$. The circuit consists of an infinite resistive ladder network, an input source at node $c_0$, and a capacitor $C$ connected between node $a_0$ and ground. Node $a_0$ is the output node. The combination of the resistive network and the capacitor forms a low-pass filter.\n\n**Step 2: Define Cutoff Frequency**\nThe cutoff frequency of a first-order RC low-pass filter is the frequency at which the output voltage magnitude drops to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its maximum (passband) value. For an RC circuit, the angular cutoff frequency, denoted by $\\omega_c$, is given by:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C}$\nwhere $R_{th}$ is the Thevenin equivalent resistance \"seen\" by the capacitor $C$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Thevenin Equivalent Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to calculate the equivalent resistance of the circuit looking into node $a_0$ (with the capacitor removed) while setting all independent sources to zero. The input voltage source at $c_0$ is an independent source, so we set it to zero, which means node $c_0$ is grounded.\n\nThe problem now is to find the resistance between node $a_0$ and ground for the given infinite ladder network, with node $c_0$ also grounded. Let's denote the voltage at the nodes on the right rail as $v_k$ (for node $d_k$) and on the left rail as $u_k$ (for node $c_k$). Let's rename $a_0$ to $d_0$ for consistency. We apply a test voltage $V$ at node $d_0$, so $v_0 = V$. Since $c_0$ is grounded, we have $u_0 = 0$. We then calculate the total current $I$ drawn from the test source. $R_{th}$ will be $V/I$.\n\n**Step 4: Set up and Solve the Nodal Equations for the Infinite Ladder**\nBy applying Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at any node $d_k$ and $c_k$ for $k \\ge 1$, we get a system of linear difference equations:\nFor node $d_k$: $\\frac{v_k - v_{k-1}}{r} + \\frac{v_k - v_{k+1}}{r} + \\frac{v_k - u_k}{r} = 0 \\implies 3v_k - v_{k-1} - v_{k+1} - u_k = 0$\nFor node $c_k$: $\\frac{u_k - u_{k-1}}{r} + \\frac{u_k - u_{k+1}}{r} + \\frac{u_k - v_k}{r} = 0 \\implies 3u_k - u_{k-1} - u_{k+1} - v_k = 0$\n\nWe look for solutions of the form $v_k = A \\lambda^k$ and $u_k = B \\lambda^k$. For the voltages to be physically realistic (i.e., not grow to infinity as $k \\to \\infty$), the magnitude of $\\lambda$ must be less than or equal to 1. The analysis of these equations yields two fundamental modes: a symmetric mode where $v_k = u_k$ and an anti-symmetric mode where $v_k = -u_k$. The decaying solution corresponds to the anti-symmetric mode with a decay factor $\\lambda_1 = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe general form of the decaying solution can be written as a superposition of these modes:\n$v_k = C_1 + C_2 \\lambda_1^k$\n$u_k = C_1 - C_2 \\lambda_1^k$\nwhere $\\lambda_1 = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$.\n\n**Step 5: Apply Boundary Conditions**\nWe apply our boundary conditions ($v_0 = V$ and $u_0 = 0$) to the general solution at $k=0$:\n$v_0 = C_1 + C_2 \\lambda_1^0 = C_1 + C_2 = V$\n$u_0 = C_1 - C_2 \\lambda_1^0 = C_1 - C_2 = 0$\n\nSolving this system of two equations gives $C_1 = V/2$ and $C_2 = V/2$.\nSo, the voltage on the right rail is given by:\n$v_k = \\frac{V}{2}(1 + (2-\\sqrt{3})^k)$\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Thevenin Resistance**\nThe current $I$ from the test source at $d_0$ flows into the ladder. From the diagram, node $d_0$ is connected to node $d_1$ through a resistor $r$. There is no other connection from $d_0$ into the ladder. Thus, the current $I$ is:\n$I = \\frac{v_0 - v_1}{r}$\n\nWe know $v_0 = V$. We can calculate $v_1$ using our solution:\n$v_1 = \\frac{V}{2}(1 + (2-\\sqrt{3})^1) = \\frac{V}{2}(1 + 2 - \\sqrt{3}) = \\frac{V}{2}(3 - \\sqrt{3})$\n\nNow, we find the current $I$:\n$I = \\frac{1}{r} \\left( V - \\frac{V}{2}(3 - \\sqrt{3}) \\right) = \\frac{V}{r} \\left( 1 - \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{V}{r} \\left( \\frac{2 - 3 + \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{V}{r} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{2} \\right)$\n\nThe Thevenin resistance is $R_{th} = V/I$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{V}{\\frac{V}{r} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{2} \\right)} = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}$\n\nTo simplify, we rationalize the denominator:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\\sqrt{3} - 1)(\\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the Cutoff Frequency**\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $R_{th}$ into the formula for the angular cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C} = \\frac{1}{r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThis is the final expression for the cutoff frequency.\n\n<<<1/(r*(1 + sqrt(3))*C)>>>"
