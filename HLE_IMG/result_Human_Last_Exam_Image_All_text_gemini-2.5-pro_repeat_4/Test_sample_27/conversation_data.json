    "*   **Step 1: Initial Examination of the Artwork**\n    The image provided is a watercolor painting depicting a landscape scene, likely a coastal or lakeside view. We see a body of water in the foreground, a strip of land with some vegetation and a small building, and rolling hills in the background. The style is relatively loose and expressive.\n\n*   **Step 2: Locating the Artist's Signature**\n    The most crucial clue for identifying the artist is often a signature on the artwork itself. By carefully scanning the painting, a signature can be seen in the bottom right-hand corner.\n\n*   **Step 3: Deciphering the Signature**\n    Using the original image and the helpful cropped images (especially the last one which zooms in on the bottom-right corner), we can decipher the signature. The name written is \"Marquet\". Below the name, there is additional text which appears to be \"Port-Cros 38\". \"Port-Cros\" is likely the location where the painting was created, an island in France, and \"38\" most likely refers to the year 1938.\n\n*   **Step 4: Researching the Artist**\n    Based on the surname \"Marquet,\" we can conduct a search for an artist with this name who was active around 1938 and painted in a similar style. The most prominent artist matching this description is Albert Marquet.\n\n*   **Step 5: Verifying the Artist**\n    Albert Marquet (1875â€“1947) was a French Fauvist painter known for his landscapes and particularly his depictions of water scenes. His style, subject matter, and signature are all consistent with the painting in question. Research confirms that he did indeed paint in Port-Cros. The artwork is known as *Port-Cros*, created in 1938.\n\n*   **Step 6: Final Answer Formulation**\n    The question asks for the artist's full name. Based on the analysis, the artist is Albert Marquet.\n\n<<<Albert Marquet>>>"
