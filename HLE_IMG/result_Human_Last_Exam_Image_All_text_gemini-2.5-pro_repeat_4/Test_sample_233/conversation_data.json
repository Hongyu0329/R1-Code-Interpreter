    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the Ingvar runestone from the provided image fragment.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the runestone fragment.**\nThe image shows runes carved into stone. The runes are organized into neat horizontal bands, separated by incised lines. The carving style is uniform and clear. Word separators, in the form of small crosses (`x`), are used between words. These features are typical of Upplandic and Södermanlandic runestones from the late Viking Age (c. 11th century).\n\n**Step 2: Transliterate the visible runes.**\nTo identify the specific stone, we need to read the runes. The script is the Younger Futhark. We will read the text from left to right, line by line.\n\n*   **Top Row:** The visible runes are `... þ a i ʀ x ʀ a i s t u x s ...`\n    *   `þ` (ᚦ), `a` (ᛅ), `i` (ᛁ), `ʀ` (ᛦ) -> `þaiʀ` (Old Norse: `þæiʀ`, \"they\")\n    *   `x` -> word separator\n    *   `ʀ` (ᚱ), `a` (ᛅ), `i` (ᛁ), `s` (ᛋ), `t` (ᛏ), `u` (ᚢ) -> `raistu` (Old Norse: `ræistu`, \"raised\")\n    *   `x` -> word separator\n    *   `s` (ᛋ) -> This is the first letter of the next word, which is broken at the end of the line.\n\n*   **Middle Row:** The visible runes are `t a i n x þ a n s i x a t x þ u r k i l x f a þ u...`\n    *   `t` (ᛏ), `a` (ᛅ), `i` (ᛁ), `n` (ᚾ) -> `tain`. This continues the word from the line above, forming `s-tain` (Old Norse: `stæin`, \"stone\").\n    *   `x` -> word separator\n    *   `þ` (ᚦ), `a` (ᛅ), `n` (ᚾ), `s` (ᛋ), `i` (ᛁ) -> `þansi` (Old Norse: `þannsi`, \"this\")\n    *   `x` -> word separator\n    *   `a` (ᛅ), `t` (ᛏ) -> `at` (Old Norse: `at`, \"in memory of\")\n    *   `x` -> word separator\n    *   `þ` (ᚦ), `u` (ᚢ), `r` (ᚱ), `k` (ᚴ), `i` (ᛁ), `l` (ᛚ) -> `þurkil` (Old Norse: `Þorkel`, a personal name).\n    *   `x` -> word separator\n    *   `f` (ᚠ), `a` (ᛅ), `þ` (ᚦ), `u` (ᚢ)... -> `faþu...` (start of Old Norse: `faður`, \"father\").\n\n*   **Bottom Row:** The visible runes are `... r x s i n x a u k x s i k i t x a t x i k u a r ...`\n    *   `...r` -> `...r`. This completes the word from the line above, `faþur` (\"father\").\n    *   `x` -> word separator\n    *   `s` (ᛋ), `i` (ᛁ), `n` (ᚾ) -> `sin` (Old Norse: `sinn`, \"his\").\n    *   `x` -> word separator\n    *   `a` (ᛅ), `u` (ᚢ), `k` (ᚴ) -> `auk` (Old Norse: `ok`, \"and\").\n    *   `x` -> word separator\n    *   `s` (ᛋ), `i` (ᛁ), `k` (ᚴ), `i` (ᛁ), `t` (ᛏ) -> `sikit`. This spelling represents the name `Sigrid`.\n    *   `x` -> word separator\n    *   `a` (ᛅ), `t` (ᛏ) -> `at` (Old Norse: `at`, \"in memory of\").\n    *   `x` -> word separator\n    *   `i` (ᛁ), `k` (ᚴ), `u` (ᚢ), `a` (ᛅ), `r` (ᚱ) -> `ikuar` (Old Norse: `Ingvarr`, the name Ingvar).\n\n**Step 3: Reconstruct the text fragment and identify the runestone.**\nThe transliterated text fragment reads:\n`... þæiʀ ræistu stæin þannsi at Þorkel, faður sinn, ok Sigrid at Ingvarr ...`\nIn English: `... they raised this stone in memory of Þorkell, their father, and Sigríd in memory of Ingvarr ...`\n\nThis text is a known formula on Viking Age runestones. The presence of the name Ingvar (`ikuar`) confirms this is an Ingvar runestone. By searching the Rundata database for an Ingvar runestone with this specific text, we can identify it.\n\nThe inscription matches that of the runestone catalogued as **Sö 179**. The full inscription on Sö 179 is: \"Þorgæiʀʀ ok Øpiʀʀ, þæiʀ ræistu stæin þannsi at Þorkel, faður sinn, ok Sigríd at Ingvar, bonda sinn. Guð hialpi selu þæiRa.\" (\"Þorgæirr and Øpirr, they raised this stone in memory of Þorkell, their father, and Sigríd in memory of Ingvarr, her husbandman. May God help their souls.\")\n\nThe fragment shown in the image corresponds perfectly to the middle section of the Sö 179 inscription.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe careful analysis and transliteration of the runes in the image fragment allow for a positive identification. The specific sequence of names and words, including the distinctive name `ikuar` (Ingvar), matches the inscription on the runestone Sö 179, also known as the Grinda runestone.\n\n<<<Sö 179>>>"
