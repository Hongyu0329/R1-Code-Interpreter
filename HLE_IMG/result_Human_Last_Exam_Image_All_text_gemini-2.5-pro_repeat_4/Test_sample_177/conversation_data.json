    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Objective:**\nCalculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) when shifting from the Baseline (Table 1) mode share to the Proposed (Table 2) mode share.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **VMT Definition:** VMT stands for Vehicle Miles Traveled. It measures the total mileage traveled by vehicles. For cars, one car traveling one mile is one VMT, regardless of the number of occupants.\n2.  **Car Modes:** Car VMT includes trips from both \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\". We need to sum the mode shares of these two categories to find the total car mode share for each distance bracket.\n3.  **Irrelevant Data:** The \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" figures (2.8 for Baseline, 3 for Proposed) are used to calculate Person Miles Traveled (PMT), not VMT. This information is not needed for this problem and should be ignored.\n4.  **Relative Calculation:** Since the total number of trips is not given, we can perform a proportional calculation. We can calculate a \"VMT Index\" for both scenarios, which is the average VMT per trip across all trips. The percentage reduction will be the same regardless of the total number of trips, as it would be a common factor that cancels out.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\nThe VMT for a given segment can be calculated proportionally by multiplying three values:\n1.  Share of total trips in a distance category.\n2.  The mode share of cars for that category.\n3.  The average trip distance for that category.\n\nLet's calculate a proportional VMT index for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios by summing the indices for each distance category.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Baseline Car VMT Index**\n\nWe will calculate the VMT index for each distance category and then sum them up.\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 25% (1 occupant) + 28% (>2 occupants) = 53%\n    *   VMT Index = 48% (share of trips) * 53% (car share) * 1 (avg distance) = 0.48 * 0.53 * 1 = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   VMT Index = 22% * 81% * 4 = 0.22 * 0.81 * 4 = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   VMT Index = 14% * 85% * 7.5 = 0.14 * 0.85 * 7.5 = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   VMT Index = 16% * 89% * 20 = 0.16 * 0.89 * 20 = 2.8480\n\n*   **Total Baseline VMT Index** = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Proposed Car VMT Index**\n\nWe repeat the same calculation using the data from Table 2.\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   VMT Index = 48% * 3% * 1 = 0.48 * 0.03 * 1 = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   VMT Index = 22% * 27% * 4 = 0.22 * 0.27 * 4 = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   VMT Index = 14% * 41% * 7.5 = 0.14 * 0.41 * 7.5 = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   VMT Index = 16% * 49% * 20 = 0.16 * 0.49 * 20 = 1.5680\n\n*   **Total Proposed VMT Index** = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\nThe formula for percentage reduction is: `((Original Value - New Value) / Original Value) * 100%`.\n*   **VMT Reduction** = Baseline VMT Index - Proposed VMT Index\n    *   VMT Reduction = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT Index) * 100%\n    *   Percentage Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100% â‰ˆ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the percentage reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
