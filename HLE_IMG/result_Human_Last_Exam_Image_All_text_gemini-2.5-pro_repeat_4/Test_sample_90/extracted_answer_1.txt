The structures are shown in the image below:
A:
A molecule with a linear 7-carbon chain. C1 is part of a methyl ester group (COOCH3). C2 and C3 form a trans double bond. C4 is attached to an acetamido group (-NHCOCH3). C7 is a ketone (=O) and is also attached to a pyrrolidine ring at position 2.

B:
A tricyclic aromatic molecule. It consists of a central pyrrole ring fused with another pyrrole ring on one side (forming a pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole core) and a five-membered dihydro-pyrrole ring attached as a substituent on the other side. A methyl ester group (-COOCH3) is attached to the central pyrrole ring.

C:
A bicyclic molecule with a fused six-membered and five-membered ring (an octahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrimidine system). A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is attached to a carbon on the five-membered ring. An acetyl group (-COCH3) is attached to a nitrogen on the six-membered ring.
