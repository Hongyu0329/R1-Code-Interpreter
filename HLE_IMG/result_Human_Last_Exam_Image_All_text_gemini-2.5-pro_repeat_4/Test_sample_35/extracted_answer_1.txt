The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **V-domain** of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products (RAGE).

Based on the provided information, S100B could be used as a **prognostic marker**. This is because its levels are not just elevated in the disease state (which would make it an adjunct diagnostic marker), but its signaling activity directly drives the key pathological processes—neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration—that determine the severity and progression of the neurological disorder. Therefore, higher levels of S100B would predict a more aggressive disease course and a poorer outcome for the patient.
