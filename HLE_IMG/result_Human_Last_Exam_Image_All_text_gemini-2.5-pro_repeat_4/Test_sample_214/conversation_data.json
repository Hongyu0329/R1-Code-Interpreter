    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the poetic form.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The request asks for the specific poetic form of a four-line stanza. We are given the third and fourth lines of this stanza. The poem is an erasure poem, a form of found poetry where words are removed from an existing text.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Provided Information:**\n    *   **Form:** The poem is a four-line stanza (a quatrain).\n    *   **Line 3:** The text in the image represents the third line. The words are \"ghostly velum forms like a dance\".\n    *   **Line 4:** The final line is \"nacreous wavers\".\n    *   **Artistic Context:** The image is a collage and erasure poem, likely by an artist influenced by imagism and brevity. The subject matter (jellyfish described as clouds) is ethereal and visual.\n\n3.  **Examine the Structure (Syllable Count):** The most common way to define poetic forms like this is by syllable count per line.\n    *   **Line 4 Analysis:** \"nacreous wavers\".\n        *   \"na-cre-ous\" = 3 syllables.\n        *   \"wa-vers\" = 2 syllables.\n        *   Total for Line 4 = 5 syllables.\n    *   **Line 3 Analysis:** \"ghostly velum forms like a dance\".\n        *   \"ghost-ly\" = 2 syllables.\n        *   \"ve-lum\" = 2 syllables.\n        *   \"forms\" = 1 syllable.\n        *   \"like a\" = 2 syllables (or 1 if elided in speech, a common poetic device).\n        *   \"dance\" = 1 syllable.\n        *   The total is either 8 syllables, or 7 if \"like a\" is treated as one beat. A count of 7 is very common in specific poetic forms.\n\n4.  **Identify Potential Poetic Forms:** We have a stanza where the last two lines have a syllable structure of approximately 7-5. This pattern is a very strong indicator of a specific form.\n    *   The structure of a **Haiku** is three lines with a syllable count of 5-7-5.\n    *   Our poem's last two lines match the last two lines of a haiku perfectly (7-5).\n\n5.  **Reconcile with the Four-Line Constraint:** The question explicitly states it is a \"four-line stanza,\" while a haiku is traditionally three lines. This presents a contradiction. However, we must consider the following:\n    *   **Modern Variations:** In English-language adaptations of haiku, poets sometimes break the lines for visual or rhythmic effect, resulting in a four-line presentation of the three-part (5-7-5) structure.\n    *   **Primacy of Evidence:** The textual evidence (the 7-5 syllable pattern) points overwhelmingly to a haiku structure. It is more likely that the \"four-line\" description refers to the visual layout of the sequence (four separate erasure pages making up the stanza) rather than a different poetic form altogether, for which there is no structural evidence.\n    *   **Absence of Alternatives:** There is no standard four-line poetic form that ends with a 7-5 syllable count.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the strong syllabic evidence in the provided lines (a 7-syllable line followed by a 5-syllable line), the text adheres to the structure of a Haiku. The description of it as a \"four-line stanza\" likely refers to its unique presentation as a sequence of four erasure poems, but the underlying poetic form is Haiku.\n\n<<<Haiku>>>"
