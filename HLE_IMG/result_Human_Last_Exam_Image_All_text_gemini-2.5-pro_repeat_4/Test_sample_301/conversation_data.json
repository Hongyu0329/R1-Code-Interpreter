    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each of the nine works.\n\n**1. Top Row, Left:**\n*   **Analysis:** The image displays four whimsical fish painted in a modern, cartoon-like style using ink and color wash. One fish has a human face. This playful and distinctive style is the hallmark of the celebrated Chinese cartoonist and artist **Ding Cong (丁聪)**.\n*   **Author:** Ding Cong\n\n**2. Top Row, Center:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Chinese ink wash painting (水墨画) of chrysanthemums next to a rock. The composition is strong and angular, with bold, decisive brushstrokes. This powerful and almost architectural style is characteristic of **Pan Tianshou (潘天寿)**, a 20th-century master known for his monumental and forceful paintings of flowers and birds.\n*   **Author:** Pan Tianshou\n\n**3. Top Row, Right:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a highly realistic portrait of a woman from the Yi ethnic minority, identifiable by her headdress and clothing. The painting demonstrates a mastery of Western oil painting techniques, particularly in capturing the subject's expression and the texture of her skin and clothes. This is a very famous work in modern Chinese art history, titled \"Yi Woman,\" created by **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**, a leading figure of Neoclassicism in China.\n*   **Author:** Jin Shangyi\n\n**4. Middle Row, Left:**\n*   **Analysis:** The image shows a piece of Chinese calligraphy in a highly energetic and unrestrained cursive script (草书). The fluid, connected strokes and powerful momentum are the well-known and distinctive calligraphic style of **Mao Zedong (毛泽东)**.\n*   **Author:** Mao Zedong\n\n**5. Middle Row, Center:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a modern abstract work that combines Western abstract forms (the two colored circles) with traditional Chinese ink wash techniques (the landscape at the bottom). This specific style, often featuring celestial bodies like the sun and moon and pioneering the use of special paper and techniques, is the signature of **Liu Kuo-sung (刘国松, also Liu Guosong)**, a key figure in the modernist Chinese art movement.\n*   **Author:** Liu Kuo-sung\n\n**6. Middle Row, Right:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a piece of calligraphy in an elegant and refined standard script. The text is a colophon (a commentary written on a work of art). The style, known for its grace, balance, and scholarly revival of earlier Tang and Jin dynasty masters, is characteristic of the great Yuan dynasty artist and calligrapher **Zhao Mengfu (赵孟頫)**.\n*   **Author:** Zhao Mengfu\n\n**7. Bottom Row, Left:**\n*   **Analysis:** This calligraphy is an example of \"mad cursive script\" (狂草), characterized by its wild, impetuous, and highly abbreviated strokes. This style is famously associated with the Tang dynasty monk **Huaisu (怀素)**. The image shows a detail from his most famous work, the *Autobiography* scroll (自叙帖).\n*   **Author:** Huaisu\n\n**8. Bottom Row, Center:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a realistic oil portrait of a young woman with a pensive expression, set against a dark, leafy background. The painting's romantic and melancholic atmosphere, combined with its flawless realist technique, is characteristic of **Chen Yifei (陈逸飞)**, one of the most prominent Chinese realist painters of the late 20th century. This specific painting is one of his most iconic portraits.\n*   **Author:** Chen Yifei\n\n**9. Bottom Row, Right:**\n*   **Analysis:** This painting depicts a woman in a style that blends traditional Chinese line drawing with modern expressionism. The elongated figure, elegant lines, and rich colors are reminiscent of the art of the Dunhuang murals. This unique synthesis of Chinese and Western artistic elements is the signature style of **Lin Fengmian (林风眠)**, a pioneer of modern Chinese painting.\n*   **Author:** Lin Fengmian\n\n<<<Ding Cong, Pan Tianshou, Jin Shangyi, Mao Zedong, Liu Kuo-sung, Zhao Mengfu, Huaisu, Chen Yifei, Lin Fengmian>>>"
