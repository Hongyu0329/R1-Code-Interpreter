    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Piece, Key, and Measure**\n*   **Piece:** Ludwig van Beethoven, Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor, Op. 13, \"Pathétique\".\n*   **Movement:** 1st movement, Allegro di molto e con brio section.\n*   **Home Key:** The overall key of the movement is C minor (three flats: B♭, E♭, A♭).\n*   **Measure 30:** Looking at the provided sheet music, the second system begins with measure 28. Counting forward, the third measure of that system, which is circled in the image, is measure 30.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Notes in Measure 30**\n*   **Treble Clef (Right Hand):** The notes played are D, F-sharp (F♯), A, and C. These are played in a pattern of broken chords.\n*   **Bass Clef (Left Hand):** The left hand plays octaves on the note B-natural (B♮).\n*   **Combined Notes:** The full set of notes sounding in this measure is B♮, D, F♯, A, and C.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Harmony (Chord Identification)**\n*   First, let's focus on the chord played by the right hand: D, F♯, A, C.\n*   When we stack these notes in thirds starting on D, we get D - F♯ - A - C.\n*   This is the structure of a dominant seventh chord: Root (D), Major Third (F♯), Perfect Fifth (A), and Minor Seventh (C).\n*   Therefore, the chord in the right hand is a **D dominant 7th chord (D7)**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Harmonic Function (Roman Numeral)**\n*   Roman numeral analysis relates a chord to its function within a key. The home key is C minor.\n*   We need to determine the function of the D7 chord in the key of C minor.\n*   In C minor, the dominant chord (V) is G major.\n*   The D7 chord is the dominant of G (D is the 5th scale degree of G).\n*   A chord that functions as the dominant of another chord (other than the tonic) is called a **secondary dominant**.\n*   In this case, D7 is the dominant of the dominant (G).\n*   The Roman numeral for a \"dominant of the dominant\" is written as **V/V** (read as \"five of five\").\n*   Since it is a seventh chord, a more specific notation would be V7/V. However, V/V represents the fundamental function.\n\n**Step 5: Consider the Bass Note**\n*   The left hand plays a B♮ in the bass. This note is not part of the D7 chord (D-F♯-A-C).\n*   The B♮ is the leading tone of the home key, C minor.\n*   In this context, the B♮ is best understood as a **pedal point** or a **non-chord tone**. Beethoven uses it to create intense dissonance and to connect the harmony to the preceding measures, while the right hand introduces the new secondary dominant chord.\n*   The presence of this non-chord tone in the bass does not change the fundamental identity of the chord in the right hand as a D7, nor its function as V/V. Because the bass note is not a chord tone of D7, we cannot describe this as a standard inversion (like V6/5/V, etc.). The analysis remains V/V with a pedal B in the bass.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe harmony in measure 30 is a D dominant 7th chord, which functions as the dominant of the dominant (V/V) in the home key of C minor.\n\n<<<V/V>>>"
