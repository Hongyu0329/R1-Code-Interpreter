Based on the microscopic analysis, the image shows a **fungus**. The specific morphology is characterized by the presence of both **budding yeast cells** (oval forms) and **pseudohyphae** (elongated, chain-like filaments with constrictions). This dimorphic presentation is a hallmark of the genus **Candida**, most commonly *Candida albicans*.
