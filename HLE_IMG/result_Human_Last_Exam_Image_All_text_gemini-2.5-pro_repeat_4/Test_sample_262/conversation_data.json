    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question and Context**\nThe question asks to identify which of the four depicted iridium(III) complexes, used as emitters in Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs), are expected to have shorter operational lifetimes. \"Lifetime\" in this context refers to the device stability, i.e., how long the LEC can operate before its performance significantly degrades. This is primarily determined by the chemical and electrochemical stability of the emitter complex.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the General Structure of the Complexes**\nAll four complexes are cationic with the general formula `[Ir(C^N)₂(N^N)]⁺PF₆⁻`.\n*   **Metal Center:** Iridium(III) is the central metal ion.\n*   **N^N Ligand:** All four complexes share the same neutral bidentate ligand: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dtbpy). The bulky tert-butyl groups improve solubility and can offer some steric protection.\n*   **C^N Ligands:** The key difference between the four complexes lies in the two monoanionic, cyclometalating phenylpyridine (ppy) ligands. These ligands are fluorinated at different positions on the phenyl ring. The stability of the complex is highly dependent on the nature and position of these substituents.\n\n**Step 3: Relate Ligand Structure to Complex Stability and Lifetime**\nThe primary degradation pathway for such complexes in LECs often involves the cleavage of the Ir-C bond of the cyclometalating ligand. The strength of this bond is a critical factor for operational stability.\n\n*   **Electronic Effects of Fluorination:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative element. When attached to the phenyl ring of the ppy ligand, it acts as a strong electron-withdrawing group.\n    *   This effect strengthens the Ir-C bond, making it more resistant to cleavage.\n    *   It also lowers the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which is typically centered on the metal and the phenyl ring. This makes the complex more difficult to oxidize, enhancing its stability against oxidative degradation.\n    *   Therefore, fluorination generally leads to longer operational lifetimes.\n\n*   **Steric Effects of Fluorination:** The position of the fluorine atom is crucial.\n    *   Fluorine atoms at positions far from the metal center (e.g., meta and para to the Ir-C bond) provide the desired electronic stabilization without introducing adverse steric effects.\n    *   A fluorine atom at the position *ortho* to the Ir-C bond (the C6' position of the phenyl ring) is very close to the iridium center and the other ligands. This creates significant steric repulsion (steric strain). This strain can weaken the Ir-C bond, counteracting and often overriding the electronic stabilization. This weakening of the bond makes the complex more prone to degradation, leading to a shorter lifetime.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Each Complex Individually**\n\n*   **Complex 1:** The two C^N ligands are 2-(4',5'-difluorophenyl)pyridine. The fluorine atoms are at the positions meta and para to the Ir-C bond. This configuration provides strong electronic stabilization without introducing steric hindrance. This complex is expected to be very stable. **Expected long lifetime.**\n\n*   **Complex 2:** This is a heteroleptic complex with one 2-(4',5'-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligand and one unsubstituted 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligand. The Ir-C bond of the unsubstituted ppy ligand is weaker than that of the fluorinated ligand because it lacks the electronic stabilization. This \"weak link\" makes the complex more susceptible to degradation compared to Complex 1. **Expected shorter lifetime.**\n\n*   **Complex 3:** The two C^N ligands are 2-(6'-fluorophenyl)pyridine. The fluorine atom is at the ortho position relative to the Ir-C bond. This ortho-fluorine introduces significant steric strain, which destabilizes the complex and weakens the Ir-C bond. This is a well-known structural feature that leads to poor operational stability. **Expected shorter lifetime.**\n\n*   **Complex 4:** The two C^N ligands are 2-(4',5',6'-trifluorophenyl)pyridine. Although this ligand has stabilizing fluorines at the meta and para positions (like in Complex 1), it also has a fluorine at the destabilizing ortho position (like in Complex 3). The negative impact of the steric strain from the ortho-fluorine is a dominant factor and is expected to cause instability, leading to rapid degradation. **Expected shorter lifetime.**\n\n**Step 5: Conclude and Select the Answer**\nBased on the analysis, Complex 1 is the most stable design and is expected to have the longest lifetime. Complexes 2, 3, and 4 all contain structural features that are known to decrease operational stability:\n*   Complex 2 has a weaker, non-fluorinated ligand.\n*   Complex 3 has a sterically demanding ortho-fluorine.\n*   Complex 4 also has a sterically demanding ortho-fluorine.\n\nTherefore, Complexes 2, 3, and 4 are all expected to show shorter lifetimes compared to Complex 1.\n\nThe correct choice is the one that includes complexes 2, 3, and 4. This corresponds to option N.\n\n<<<N>>>"
