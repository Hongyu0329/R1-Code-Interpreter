Four possibilities for how the dimerization of 3-oxidopyrylium could be described in terms of [mπ+nπ] are:
1.  **[4π+2π] cycloaddition:** One molecule acts as a 4π component (as a 1,3-dipole or a diene) and the second acts as a 2π component (using one of its double bonds as a dipolarophile/dienophile).
2.  **[4π+4π] cycloaddition:** Both molecules act as 4π components (e.g., as dienes).
3.  **[6π+4π] cycloaddition:** One molecule acts as a 6π component (using its entire ring π-system) and the second acts as a 4π component (as a diene).
4.  **[6π+2π] cycloaddition:** One molecule acts as a 6π component (using its entire ring π-system) and the second acts as a 2π component (using one of its double bonds).
