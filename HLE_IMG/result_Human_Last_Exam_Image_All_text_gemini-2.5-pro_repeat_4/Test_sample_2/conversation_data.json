    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Structure:**\n    The provided code is a recursive function `sort(a, n)` that aims to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`. Let's break down its logic:\n    *   **Base Case:** `if n > 1:` The recursion stops when it's asked to sort a subarray of size 1 or 0, as such an array is already considered sorted.\n    *   **First Recursive Call:** `sort(a, n - 1)`. This line recursively calls the function to sort the first `n-1` elements of the array. Let's assume this call correctly sorts the subarray `a[0...n-2]`.\n    *   **Comparison and Swap:** `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]: swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`. After the first `n-1` elements are sorted, `a[n-2]` is the largest among them. This `if` statement checks if the last element of the current subarray, `a[n-1]`, is smaller than the largest element of the sorted prefix. If it is, it swaps them. This is similar to one step of a Bubble Sort, moving a smaller element one position towards the beginning of the array.\n    *   **Second Recursive Call:** `sort(a, n - 1)`. This is the most critical part for complexity analysis. If the swap occurred, the algorithm doesn't just assume the prefix is mostly sorted. Instead, it calls `sort(a, n - 1)` *again* to completely re-sort the first `n-1` elements.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation:**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time taken by the `sort(a, n)` function in the worst case.\n    *   The work done inside the function, besides the recursive calls, is a comparison and a potential swap. This takes constant time, which we can denote as `O(1)` or `c`.\n    *   There is always one recursive call: `sort(a, n - 1)`.\n    *   In the worst case, the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` will be true, triggering the swap and the second recursive call to `sort(a, n - 1)`.\n\n    Therefore, the worst-case recurrence relation is:\n    `T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + O(1)`\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    The base case is `T(1) = O(1)` (or some constant `d`), as the function does nothing when `n` is not greater than 1.\n\n3.  **Identify the Worst-Case Input:**\n    The worst case happens when the second recursive call is always triggered. This occurs when `a[n-1] < a[n-2]` is true after the first `sort(a, n-1)` call, for all `n` from the initial size down to 2.\n    A reverse-sorted array (e.g., `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`) is a classic example of a worst-case input for this type of algorithm. Let's trace `sort([3, 2, 1], 3)`:\n    *   `sort(3)` calls `sort(2)`.\n    *   `sort(2)` calls `sort(1)` (returns), then swaps `a[0]` and `a[1]` to make the array `[2, 3, 1]`, then calls `sort(1)` again. Now `a[0...1]` is sorted.\n    *   Back in `sort(3)`, the array is `[2, 3, 1]`. The first call to `sort(2)` is done.\n    *   It checks `a[2] < a[1]` (i.e., `1 < 3`), which is true. It swaps them, making the array `[2, 1, 3]`.\n    *   It now calls `sort(2)` again on `[2, 1, 3]`. This second call will again do a swap and sort the prefix to `[1, 2]`.\n    This confirms that a reverse-sorted array triggers the worst-case behavior.\n\n4.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:**\n    We have `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`. Let's expand this:\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 3c`\n    *   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + (2^k - 1) * c`\n\n    We can continue until we reach the base case `T(1)`. Let `n-k = 1`, which means `k = n-1`.\n    *   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-1) - 1) * c`\n    *   Since `T(1)` is a constant, let's call it `d`.\n    *   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * d + c * 2^(n-1) - c = (d+c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\n    The dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`, which is of the order `O(2^n)`.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Recursive Structure:** The key is to correctly identify the number of recursive calls in the worst case. There are two calls to `sort(n-1)` from `sort(n)`.\n*   **Pass-by-Reference:** The array `a` is modified in place. This is important for tracing but doesn't change the high-level complexity analysis which depends on the number of operations.\n*   **Worst Case vs. Best Case:** In the best case (an already sorted array), the condition `a[n-1] < a[n-2]` is always false. The recurrence would be `T(n) = T(n-1) + c`, which solves to `O(n)`. However, the question asks for the worst-case complexity.\n*   **Termination:** The algorithm does terminate because the recursive calls are made with a smaller value of `n` (`n-1`), and there's a base case at `n <= 1`.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe worst-case time complexity is described by the recurrence `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + O(1)`, which solves to `O(2^n)`. This exponential complexity makes the algorithm highly impractical for all but the smallest inputs.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{E}$.\n<<<E>>>"
