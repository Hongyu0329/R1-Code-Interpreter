    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Tissue Identification:** The image displays a section of a kidney. The central structure is a renal glomerulus, which is the filtering unit. It is surrounded by Bowman's capsule and adjacent renal tubules.\n\n2.  **Glomerular Abnormalities:** The primary pathology is located within the glomerulus.\n    *   **Hypercellularity:** The glomerulus is markedly hypercellular, meaning there is a significant increase in the number of cells compared to a normal glomerulus. The capillary loops appear filled and obscured by these cells.\n    *   **Inflammatory Infiltrate:** A closer look reveals that the increased cellularity is due to both proliferation of intrinsic glomerular cells (mesangial and endothelial cells) and an influx of inflammatory cells. Notably, many of the cells have multi-lobed nuclei, characteristic of neutrophils. This feature is known as an \"exudative\" component.\n    *   **Crescent Formation:** This is the most striking and prognostically significant finding. In the space between the glomerular tuft and the outer Bowman's capsule (Bowman's space), there is a large, crescent-shaped proliferation of cells. This is a \"cellular crescent,\" formed by the proliferation of parietal epithelial cells that line the capsule, along with infiltrating macrophages and fibroblasts. The crescent is compressing the underlying glomerular tuft.\n\n3.  **Tubulointerstitial Changes:** The surrounding renal tubules show some signs of injury, with some cells appearing swollen and having vacuolated cytoplasm. There is also mild edema in the interstitial space.\n\n4.  **Synthesis and Diagnosis:**\n    *   The combination of diffuse hypercellularity within the glomerular tuft (endocapillary proliferation), a significant neutrophilic infiltrate (exudation), and the formation of a cellular crescent in Bowman's space are the classic features of **Crescentic Glomerulonephritis**.\n    *   Crescentic glomerulonephritis is a pattern of severe glomerular injury, not a specific disease. It is the histological hallmark of the clinical syndrome of Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN).\n    *   The prominent endocapillary proliferation and exudation seen in this image are highly suggestive of an underlying immune-complex mediated process, such as a severe form of post-infectious glomerulonephritis (e.g., post-streptococcal) or lupus nephritis (Class IV). However, without ancillary tests like immunofluorescence or electron microscopy, the definitive morphological diagnosis is based on the features seen on this light microscopy slide.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Distinguish from other glomerular diseases:** It is not minimal change disease (which appears normal on light microscopy), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (which would show segmental scarring), or membranous nephropathy (which shows thickened capillary walls).\n*   **Recognize the crescent:** The crescent is the key to the diagnosis and indicates severe, acute injury. It must be distinguished from global sclerosis, which is a shrunken, acellular scar. This crescent is clearly cellular.\n*   **Note the type of inflammation:** The presence of numerous neutrophils (exudation) points towards an acute and aggressive inflammatory process, often seen in post-infectious or severe immune complex glomerulonephritis.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nBased on the presence of marked endocapillary hypercellularity, neutrophilic exudate, and a prominent cellular crescent compressing the glomerular tuft, the histopathological diagnosis is Crescentic Glomerulonephritis.\n\n<<<Crescentic glomerulonephritis>>>"
