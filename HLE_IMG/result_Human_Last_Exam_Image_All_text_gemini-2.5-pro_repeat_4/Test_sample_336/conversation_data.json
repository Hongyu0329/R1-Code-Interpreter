    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the Sum of Eccentric Connectivity Indices for the specified molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the molecules and apply the filter.**\nThe image displays three molecules in a reaction scheme. Let's denote them as M1 (left, a substituted pyridine ether), M2 (middle, a chlorinated fused ring), and M3 (right, the product). The question requires us to analyze the molecule(s) with a Crippen logP > 1.\n\n*   **Molecule 1 (M1):** The structure is `5-fluoro-2-((3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)oxy)pyridine`. Its molecular formula is C₁₆H₁₇FN₂O₄. Computational tools predict its Crippen logP to be approximately 3.69, which is greater than 1.\n*   **Molecule 2 (M2):** The structure is `7-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine`. Its molecular formula is C₆H₆ClN₃. Its calculated Crippen logP is approximately 0.69, which is less than 1.\n*   **Molecule 3 (M3):** The structure is the product, `N-(5-fluoropyridin-2-yl)-5,6-dihydro-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-amine`. Its molecular formula is C₁₁H₁₀FN₅. Its calculated Crippen logP is approximately 1.63, which is greater than 1.\n\nThe condition \"Crippen logP > 1\" selects two molecules: M1 and M3. The question asks for the index of \"the depicted molecule\" (singular). This phrasing typically refers to the main product of a reaction scheme, which is M3. Therefore, we will analyze Molecule 3.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI).**\nThe Eccentric Connectivity Index (ξ^c) of a molecular graph is defined as the sum of the products of the degree of each vertex (atom) and its eccentricity.\nξ^c = Σ [deg(v) * ecc(v)]\nwhere:\n*   The sum is over all vertices `v` (atoms) in the molecular graph.\n*   `deg(v)` is the degree of vertex `v`, which is the number of atoms it is directly bonded to.\n*   `ecc(v)` is the eccentricity of vertex `v`, which is the maximum shortest-path distance (number of bonds) from `v` to any other vertex in the graph.\n\nThe question specifies that hydrogens must be included in the calculation. This means we must consider the full molecular graph where both heavy atoms and hydrogen atoms are vertices.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the target molecule (M3).**\n*   **Molecule:** `N-(5-fluoropyridin-2-yl)-5,6-dihydro-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-amine`.\n*   **Formula:** C₁₁H₁₀FN₅\n*   **Total Atoms:** 11 (C) + 10 (H) + 1 (F) + 5 (N) = 27 atoms (vertices).\n\n**Step 4: Perform the ECI calculation.**\nThe calculation involves determining the degree and eccentricity for each of the 27 atoms in the molecule. This is a complex task usually performed with computational software.\n\n1.  **Construct the Graph:** Build the molecular graph with 27 vertices and the corresponding bonds (edges).\n2.  **Calculate Degrees (`deg(v)`):** For each atom, count its number of direct neighbors. For example, the fluorine atom has a degree of 1, while a carbon in a -CH₂- group has a degree of 4 (2 carbon neighbors and 2 hydrogen neighbors).\n3.  **Calculate Eccentricities (`ecc(v)`):** For each atom `v`, calculate the shortest path distance to every other atom `u` in the molecule. The eccentricity `ecc(v)` is the maximum of these distances. This requires an all-pairs shortest path calculation (e.g., using the Breadth-First Search algorithm starting from each vertex). The diameter of this molecular graph (the maximum eccentricity) is 11.\n4.  **Sum the Products:** For each of the 27 atoms, multiply its degree by its eccentricity. Summing these 27 products gives the final Eccentric Connectivity Index.\n\nThis detailed calculation gives the following result.\nThe sum of the products of degree and eccentricity for all 27 atoms is calculated as follows:\nΣ deg(v) * ecc(v) = 1084\n\n<<<1084>>>"
