    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue.**\n*   The clue is: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows two men in suits at what appears to be an awards ceremony. One man is presenting a trophy to the other.\n*   The date, June 20, 2019, is very close to the date of the 2019 NHL Awards, which took place on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas.\n*   The man receiving the award is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov, a player for the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n*   At the 2019 NHL Awards, Nikita Kucherov had an exceptional night, winning three major individual awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), the Art Ross Trophy (leading scorer), and the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player as voted by the players).\n*   Winning three major awards or scoring three goals in a game is known as a \"hat-trick\".\n*   Therefore, the event pictured represents a **hat-trick**. This makes \"Hat Trick\" a strong candidate for \"X Y\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   The clue is: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This clue points to a historical industrial process. Mercury salts, specifically mercury nitrate, were famously used in the hat-making industry to turn fur into felt.\n*   This process, known as \"carroting,\" was highly toxic and caused neurological damage (erethism) in the workers, who were known as \"hatters.\" This led to the expression \"mad as a hatter.\"\n*   The use of mercury in hat making has long been discontinued due to its severe health risks.\n*   The clue describes a method, technique, or \"trick of the trade.\"\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the clues to find \"X Y\".**\n*   We need to find a term \"X Y\" that fits both descriptions.\n*   Let's test our candidate \"Hat Trick\".\n    *   **Clue 1:** The picture shows Nikita Kucherov's achievement of winning three major awards, which is a \"hat-trick\". This fits perfectly.\n    *   **Clue 2:** The historical process of using mercury to make hats can be described, in a punning way, as a \"hat trick\" â€“ that is, the \"trick\" (or technique) for making \"hats.\" This old \"trick\" has ceased to be used because of toxicity. This also fits.\n*   The term \"Hat Trick\" cleverly connects the modern sporting achievement shown in the photo with the obsolete and toxic industrial process described in the text.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis strongly suggests that \"X Y\" is \"Hat Trick\". It satisfies the first clue by describing the event in the picture (a hat-trick of awards) and the second clue by punning on the \"trick\" of making hats with mercury.\n\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
