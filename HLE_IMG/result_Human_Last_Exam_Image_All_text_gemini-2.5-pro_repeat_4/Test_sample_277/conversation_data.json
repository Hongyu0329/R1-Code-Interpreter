    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Examine the Input:** The request includes an image and a multiple-choice question. The first step is to carefully observe the image. The image provided is a completely black rectangle. There are no chemical structures, diagrams, or molecules depicted in the image.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Question:** The question asks, \"Which type of isomers are the molecules mentioned above?\". This question presupposes that there are molecules shown in the image (\"above\") for analysis.\n\n3.  **Connect the Question to the Image:** Since the image is blank and contains no molecules, the premise of the question is not met. There are no \"molecules mentioned above\" to analyze.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   **(a) conformers isomers:** Conformational isomers (conformers) are stereoisomers that differ by rotation about one or more single bonds. To identify them, we would need to see at least two structures and compare them. This is not possible.\n    *   **(b) constitutional isomers:** Constitutional (or structural) isomers have the same molecular formula but different connectivity of atoms. To identify them, we would need to see the structures, determine their molecular formulas, and compare their bonding patterns. This is not possible.\n    *   **(c) Identical:** To determine if two representations are of the same molecule, we would need to see at least two structures to compare. This is not possible.\n    *   **(d) stereoisomers:** Stereoisomers have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms. This is a broad category that includes conformers, enantiomers, and diastereomers. Again, we need to see the structures to make this determination. This is not possible.\n    *   **(e) None of these:** This option is the correct choice when none of the other options apply.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Because no molecules are provided in the image, it is impossible to determine any relationship between them. We cannot check for isomerism of any kind, nor can we confirm if they are identical. Therefore, none of the specific classifications in options (a), (b), (c), or (d) can be supported. The question is unanswerable based on the given information. The most appropriate choice is (e) None of these.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The primary point is to recognize that the image is empty. Do not assume there is a missing image or try to guess what might have been intended.\n*   Understand the precise definitions of each type of isomerism and what information is required to identify them (i.e., molecular structures).\n*   Logically conclude that if the required information is absent, a specific classification cannot be made.\n*   \"None of these\" is the correct answer when the question is unanswerable due to missing data or when the correct relationship is not listed. In this case, it's due to missing data.\n\n<<<E>>>"
