    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Specimen H**\n*   **Observations:** The rock is reddish-brown and highly porous, with many small, visible holes called vesicles. The texture is fine-grained (aphanitic), meaning individual mineral crystals are not visible to the naked eye.\n*   **Careful Points:** The vesicular texture is a key indicator of an extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock. Gas bubbles were trapped within the lava as it cooled rapidly on the Earth's surface. The reddish color often results from the oxidation of iron within the lava.\n*   **Conclusion:** Based on the high vesicularity, fine-grained texture, and color, this specimen is **Scoria**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Specimen I**\n*   **Observations:** This specimen is composed of various angular rock fragments (clasts) of different sizes and colors (gray, white, reddish) that are cemented together in a fine-grained, light-colored matrix.\n*   **Careful Points:** This is a type of clastic rock formed from fragments. Since the fragments are angular and appear to be volcanic in origin (ash, lapilli), it is classified as a pyroclastic rock.\n*   **Conclusion:** The rock is composed of consolidated volcanic ash and larger angular fragments. This makes it a **Volcanic Tuff** or a **Volcanic Breccia**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Specimen J**\n*   **Observations:** This rock is very light in color (whitish-gray) and has an extremely porous, almost frothy or spongy texture. It appears to be very lightweight. Like specimen H, its texture is fine-grained (aphanitic).\n*   **Careful Points:** The extreme porosity and very light color are classic features of a specific type of vesicular volcanic rock. This rock forms from felsic lava with a very high gas content.\n*   **Conclusion:** These characteristics are definitive for **Pumice**, a volcanic rock so porous that it can often float on water.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Specimen K**\n*   **Observations:** This rock has a coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture, with large, interlocking mineral crystals that are easily visible. The crystals are of different colors, predominantly light-colored (white, tan, and pinkish feldspars) with some darker minerals (likely biotite or amphibole).\n*   **Careful Points:** The coarse-grained texture indicates that the rock cooled slowly deep beneath the Earth's surface, which is characteristic of an intrusive igneous rock. The light overall color and the presence of feldspar and likely quartz point to a felsic composition.\n*   **Conclusion:** The coarse-grained, felsic composition is characteristic of **Granite**.\n\n**Final Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Volcanic Tuff / Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Granite\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Volcanic Tuff (or Breccia)\nJ: Pumice\nK: Granite>>>"
