    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the poem's metric pattern:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the words of the poem.**\nThe image is an erasure poem, where words are selected from a source text to create a new piece. The words, presented as cut-outs, are:\n*   \"rules\"\n*   \"and\"\n*   \"lines,\"\n*   \"an intricate spider's web\"\n*   \"work\"\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure and reading order.**\nThe words are arranged visually on the page. A natural reading order follows from top to bottom and left to right. The visual grouping of the cut-outs suggests the poem's line breaks.\n*   Line 1: `rules`\n*   Line 2: `and lines,` (These two words are placed close together, suggesting they form a single phrase or line).\n*   Line 3: `an intricate spider's web` (This is a single, long cut-out).\n*   Line 4: `work`\n\nThe poem can be read as:\n> rules\n> and lines,\n> an intricate spider's web\n> work\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the poem for a metrical pattern by examining each answer choice.**\n\n*   **Syllable Count:** Let's count the syllables in each line:\n    *   `rules`: 1 syllable\n    *   `and lines,`: 1 + 1 = 2 syllables\n    *   `an intricate spider's web`: 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 7 syllables\n    *   `work`: 1 syllable\n    The lines have highly irregular lengths (1, 2, 7, and 1 syllables).\n\n*   **A. free verse:** Free verse is poetry that does not have a regular meter or a consistent rhyme scheme. Given the irregular line lengths and syllable counts, this is a very strong possibility.\n\n*   **B. iambic pentameter:** This form requires lines of 10 syllables with a pattern of five iambic feet (unstressed followed by stressed: uS uS uS uS uS). None of the lines in the poem are 10 syllables long, nor do they follow an iambic pattern. This choice is incorrect.\n\n*   **C. alexandrine:** This is a line of 12 syllables, typically in iambic hexameter. This is incorrect for the same reasons as iambic pentameter.\n\n*   **D. sapphic:** This is a specific stanzaic form with three 11-syllable lines and one 5-syllable line, each with a complex, prescribed metrical pattern. The poem does not match this structure at all. This choice is incorrect.\n\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** This form consists of lines with three iambic feet (uS uS uS), making them roughly 6 syllables long. While the meter can be \"loose,\" the lines in the poem vary too much in length (from 1 to 7 syllables) to fit this pattern. This choice is incorrect.\n\n*   **F. american sentence:** This form, created by Allen Ginsberg, is a single sentence that is exactly 17 syllables long. Let's count the total syllables in the poem: 1 + 2 + 7 + 1 = 11 syllables. Since the total is 11, not 17, this choice is incorrect.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the analysis.**\nThe poem does not conform to any of the specific, regular metrical forms listed (B, C, D, E, F). It lacks a consistent meter, regular line length, and rhyme scheme. This is the definition of free verse. The poem's rhythm and structure are created by the choice and visual arrangement of the words, not by adherence to a formal metrical pattern.\n\nTherefore, the words in the erasure poem follow a free verse pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>"
