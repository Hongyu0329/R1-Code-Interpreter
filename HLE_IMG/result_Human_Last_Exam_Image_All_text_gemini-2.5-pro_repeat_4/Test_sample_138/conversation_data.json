    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair.\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Hymenoptera (Bees and Wasps):**\n\n*   **Antennae:** Males generally have longer antennae with more segments (typically 13) compared to females (typically 12). In some groups, like male wasps and long-horned bees, this difference is very pronounced. Male wasp antennae are often curled at the tip.\n*   **Abdomen (Gaster):** Females have a pointed abdomen which houses a stinger (a modified ovipositor). Males have a blunter, more rounded abdomen and lack a stinger. Males also typically have one more visible abdominal segment than females (7 vs. 6).\n*   **Pollen-Collecting Hairs (Scopae):** Many female bees have dense brushes of hair on their hind legs or abdomen for carrying pollen. The question states the taxa shown are *without* scopae on their legs. This directs us to look at wasps, cuckoo bees (which are parasites and don't collect pollen), or to focus on other characteristics if the bee species is an exception.\n\n**Analysis of Each Pair:**\n\n**Pair A:** These are cuckoo bees, likely of the genus *Coelioxys*. They are cleptoparasites, meaning they lay their eggs in the nests of other bees, so females do not have scopae.\n\n*   **Insect A (Left):** The abdomen is extremely elongated and tapers to a sharp, conical point. This is the highly modified ovipositor of a female *Coelioxys*, used to pierce the nests of its host. This is a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** The abdomen is much blunter and lacks the extreme tapering point seen in the female. This is characteristic of a **Male (M)** *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Conclusion for Pair A:** Left is Female, Right is Male. This corresponds to option **4 (F, M)**.\n\n**Pair B:** These are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. Wasps do not have scopae.\n\n*   **Insect B (Left):** The most telling feature is the antennae, which are distinctly curled at the tips. This is a reliable characteristic of **Male (M)** wasps.\n*   **Insect B (Right):** The antennae are straight, not curled. The abdomen is more pointed at the tip, concealing the stinger. This is a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Conclusion for Pair B:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Pair C:** These appear to be long-horned bees (Tribe Eucerini). The most dramatic sexual dimorphism in this group is antenna length.\n\n*   **Insect C (Left):** This bee has exceptionally long antennae that extend far beyond its head. This is the defining characteristic of a **Male (M)** long-horned bee.\n*   **Insect C (Right):** This bee has much shorter antennae, which is typical for a female bee. While female long-horned bees typically do have scopae, the difference in antenna length is an unmistakable feature for sexing this pair.\n*   **Conclusion for Pair C:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n\n*   **Pair A:** F, M (Option 4)\n*   **Pair B:** M, F (Option 3)\n*   **Pair C:** M, F (Option 3)\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of these indices.\n\n<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
