    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the jazz standard.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Key Signature and Tonality:** The key signature has one flat (B♭). The first chord is an F minor chord (F-). The piece frequently resolves to or is centered around F minor. This indicates the key is F minor.\n\n2.  **Melody Analysis:** Let's examine the opening melodic phrase.\n    *   **Measure 1:** The notes are C, F, G, A♭.\n    *   **Measure 2:** The notes are G, F.\n    *   **Measure 3:** The notes are E♭, C.\n    *   **Measure 4:** The notes are D♭, B♮.\n    This opening melody is highly distinctive and recognizable.\n\n3.  **Chord Progression Analysis:** The chord progression is a major clue.\n    *   **Measure 1:** F- (F minor)\n    *   **Measure 2:** Eø7 (E half-diminished 7)\n    *   **Measure 3:** E♭-6 (E♭ minor 6)\n    *   **Measure 4:** D♭maj7 (D♭ major 7)\n    This progression features a descending chromatic bass line (F, E, E♭, D♭), which is a classic harmonic device known as a \"line cliché\". This specific progression is characteristic of a famous standard.\n\n4.  **The Bridge (B Section):** Starting from the 9th measure (after the first ending), the chords change significantly, indicating the bridge section.\n    *   **Measures 9-12:** Dø7 | G7 | C7 | F7\n    *   **Measures 13-16:** B♭-7 | E♭7 | A♭ | G C7\n    This progression, moving through a series of ii-V-I patterns and related dominant chords, is also typical of standards from the Great American Songbook era.\n\n5.  **Identification:**\n    *   The combination of the melody in F minor and the chromatic descending chord progression (Fm, Eø7, E♭m6, D♭maj7) points directly to the jazz standard **\"Yesterdays\"**.\n    *   A check against the known composition confirms the melody and chords match perfectly.\n\n6.  **Composer Identification:**\n    *   The song \"Yesterdays\" was composed by **Jerome Kern**, with lyrics by Otto Harbach, for the 1933 musical \"Roberta\".\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the melody and the highly characteristic chromatic chord progression, the piece is identified as the jazz standard \"Yesterdays\", composed by Jerome Kern.\n\n<<<Title: Yesterdays, Composer: Jerome Kern>>>"
