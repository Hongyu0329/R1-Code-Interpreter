    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph and the Goal**\nThe image provided is a raster plot, which displays the firing activity (spikes) of a network of neurons over time.\n*   The **x-axis** represents time in seconds (s).\n*   The **y-axis** represents the electrode number (from 0 to 128), with each row corresponding to a different neuron or small group of neurons.\n*   Each **black dot** represents a single neuronal spike.\nThe goal is to identify \"synchronized bursts\" and calculate the average time between them (the average inter-burst interval, IBI).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts and Their Timestamps**\nA synchronized burst is a period where a large number of neurons across many electrodes fire in a very short time window. Visually, these appear as dense vertical bands in the raster plot. We need to scan the plot from left to right and estimate the time at the center of each of these major bursts.\n\n*   **Burst 1:** The first prominent, network-wide burst is centered at approximately **t1 = 2 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The next clear burst occurs at approximately **t2 = 14 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** The third burst is centered at approximately **t3 = 24 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** The fourth burst is centered at approximately **t4 = 36 s**.\n*   **Burst 5:** The fifth and final major burst in this time window is centered at approximately **t5 = 48 s**.\n\n**Careful Point:** We are focusing on the major, network-wide events that involve a large fraction of the electrodes, as these represent the \"synchronized bursts\" of the entire culture. Smaller, less synchronized events are not included in this analysis. The estimation of the burst's center is based on the visual \"center of mass\" of the spike cluster.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the duration between the centers of two consecutive bursts. We have five bursts, which means there are four intervals between them.\n\n*   **Interval 1 (IBI₁):** The time between Burst 2 and Burst 1.\n    IBI₁ = t₂ - t₁ = 14 s - 2 s = **12 s**\n*   **Interval 2 (IBI₂):** The time between Burst 3 and Burst 2.\n    IBI₂ = t₃ - t₂ = 24 s - 14 s = **10 s**\n*   **Interval 3 (IBI₃):** The time between Burst 4 and Burst 3.\n    IBI₃ = t₄ - t₃ = 36 s - 24 s = **12 s**\n*   **Interval 4 (IBI₄):** The time between Burst 5 and Burst 4.\n    IBI₄ = t₅ - t₄ = 48 s - 36 s = **12 s**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nNow, we calculate the average of the four measured intervals.\n\n*   Average IBI = (IBI₁ + IBI₂ + IBI₃ + IBI₄) / 4\n*   Average IBI = (12 + 10 + 12 + 12) s / 4\n*   Average IBI = 46 s / 4\n*   Average IBI = **11.5 s**\n\n**Step 5: Round to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question requires the final answer to be expressed with two significant figures. Our calculated average is 11.5 s.\n\n*   The first two significant figures are '1' and '1'.\n*   The third digit is '5'. According to standard rounding rules, when the digit to be dropped is 5 or greater, we round up the last remaining digit.\n*   Therefore, we round 11.5 up to 12.\n\n**Careful Point:** Adhering to the specified precision (two significant figures) is crucial for the final answer. Rounding 11.5 gives 12.\n\n**Final Answer Summary**\n*   Identified burst timestamps: ~2 s, ~14 s, ~24 s, ~36 s, ~48 s.\n*   Calculated inter-burst intervals: 12 s, 10 s, 12 s, 12 s.\n*   Calculated average IBI: 11.5 s.\n*   Rounded to two significant figures: 12 s.\n\n<<<12>>>"
