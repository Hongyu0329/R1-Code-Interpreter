    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the book title from the provided image fragment.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements in the image fragment.**\nThe image displays a section of a painted illustration. We can clearly identify the following:\n*   **A central figure:** A white or pale blue creature that strongly resembles a unicorn. It has a horn, a horse-like head and body, and appears to be in motion. Its form is somewhat ethereal and ghost-like.\n*   **A golden horn:** The unicorn's horn is colored gold or yellow.\n*   **A dark background:** The setting behind the unicorn is dark and shadowy, suggesting a forest at night or a cave.\n*   **An obscuring object:** On the right side of the image, a textured, light-colored object, possibly a stone pillar or the trunk of a large tree, partially hides the unicorn.\n*   **Art Style:** The style is painterly and fits within the fantasy genre, common for book covers from the 1990s and 2000s.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the visual elements to a known story or scene.**\nThe scene of a unicorn, particularly a ghostly or slain one, in a dark forest is highly iconic. This immediately brings to mind a pivotal scene from the first book of the Harry Potter series. In *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* (or *Sorcerer's Stone* in the US), Harry Potter serves detention in the Forbidden Forest and stumbles upon a cloaked figure (Professor Quirrell possessed by Voldemort) drinking the blood of a slain unicorn.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific artwork and book edition.**\nThe art style is very recognizable as that of Mary GrandPré, the illustrator for the original American editions of the Harry Potter series. By searching for the cover art of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* by Mary GrandPré, we can find the full illustration.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the match.**\nThe provided fragment is a cropped section from the back cover illustration of the original US edition of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*. The full artwork shows Harry Potter hiding behind a tree while the hooded figure of Quirrell leans over the dead unicorn. The image fragment specifically shows the slain unicorn, partially obscured by the frame of the illustration on the back dust jacket.\n\n**Step 5: State the final answer.**\nBased on the iconic scene and the distinctive art style of Mary GrandPré, the book is the first installment of the Harry Potter series.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
