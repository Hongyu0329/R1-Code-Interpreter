    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and its Molecular Formula**\n\n1.  **Identify the structure:** The starting material is a bicyclic lactam. A lactam is a cyclic amide, meaning it contains a -N-C(=O)- functional group within a ring. The structure shown is a derivative of a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system.\n    *   It has a bicyclo[2.2.1] skeleton (like norbornane).\n    *   The nitrogen atom (N) is at position 2, and the carbonyl group (C=O) is at position 3, forming the lactam.\n    *   The nitrogen is protected with a PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) group.\n    *   There is a double bond in the C5-C6 position.\n    *   A trifluoromethyl (CF3) group is attached to the double bond, let's say at C5.\n\n2.  **Count the atoms to determine the molecular formula:**\n    *   **Bicyclic Core:**\n        *   C1 (bridgehead CH): 1 C, 1 H\n        *   C2 (N atom, part of the ring): 1 N\n        *   C3 (carbonyl C): 1 C, 1 O\n        *   C4 (bridgehead CH): 1 C, 1 H\n        *   C5 (C of C=C, with CF3): 1 C\n        *   C6 (C of C=C, CH): 1 C, 1 H\n        *   C7 (bridge CH2): 1 C, 2 H\n    *   **Substituents:**\n        *   PMB group (-CH2-C6H4-OCH3) on N2:\n            *   Methylene (-CH2-): 1 C, 2 H\n            *   Benzene ring (-C6H4-): 6 C, 4 H\n            *   Methoxy group (-OCH3): 1 C, 3 H, 1 O\n            *   Total for PMB: 8 C, 9 H, 1 O\n        *   Trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) on C5: 1 C, 3 F\n    *   **Total Count:**\n        *   **Carbon (C):** 6 (core) + 8 (PMB) + 1 (CF3) = 15\n        *   **Hydrogen (H):** 1+1+1+2 (core) + 9 (PMB) = 14\n        *   **Fluorine (F):** 3\n        *   **Nitrogen (N):** 1\n        *   **Oxygen (O):** 1 (carbonyl) + 1 (methoxy) = 2\n    *   **Molecular Formula of Starting Material:** C15H14F3NO2\n\n**Step 2: Reaction 1 (Formation of Intermediate 1)**\n\n1.  **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n2.  **Reaction Type:** CAN is a strong oxidizing agent commonly used for the deprotection of PMB ethers and amines. It oxidatively cleaves the N-PMB bond.\n3.  **Transformation:** The PMB group (-C8H9O) is removed from the nitrogen atom, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen, forming an N-H bond. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n4.  **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 1:**\n    *   Start with C15H14F3NO2.\n    *   Subtract the atoms of the PMB group: -C8H9O.\n    *   Add one hydrogen atom: +H.\n    *   Net change: -C8H8O.\n    *   Formula = C(15-8) H(14-8) F3 N O(2-1) = **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction 2 (Formation of Intermediate 2)**\n\n1.  **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 in MeOH.\n2.  **Reaction Type:** Catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction typically reduces carbon-carbon double and triple bonds.\n3.  **Transformation:** The C5=C6 double bond in Intermediate 1 is reduced to a C5-C6 single bond by the addition of two hydrogen atoms (H2). The lactam carbonyl group is generally stable under these conditions.\n4.  **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 2:**\n    *   Start with Intermediate 1: C7H6F3NO.\n    *   Add two hydrogen atoms: +H2.\n    *   Formula = C7 H(6+2) F3 N O = **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction 3 (Formation of the Final Product)**\n\n1.  **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n2.  **Reaction Type:** Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.\n3.  **Transformation:** Intermediate 2 is a bicyclic lactam. Under strong acidic conditions and heat, the amide bond of the lactam is hydrolyzed. This reaction consumes one molecule of water (H2O) and breaks the bond between the carbonyl carbon (C3) and the nitrogen atom (N2). This ring-opening reaction transforms the bicyclic lactam into a monocyclic amino acid.\n4.  **Molecular Formula of the Final Product:**\n    *   Start with Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO.\n    *   Add the atoms of one water molecule: +H2O.\n    *   **Carbon (C):** 7\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   **Fluorine (F):** 3\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** 1\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   **Final Product Molecular Formula:** **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\nThe product is a substituted cyclopentane amino acid: 4-amino-2-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
