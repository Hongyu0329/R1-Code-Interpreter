    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Ion Peak and Isotope Patterns**\n\n*   First, we look for the molecular ion (M⁺), which is typically the peak with the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). In the provided spectrum, there is a cluster of peaks at high m/z values: m/z 258 (17.4%), 260 (34.8%), and 262 (29.0%).\n*   The intensity ratio of these peaks is approximately 17.4 : 34.8 : 29.0, which simplifies to roughly 1 : 2 : 1.7. This pattern is characteristic of a compound containing two bromine atoms (Br₂), for which the theoretical M⁺ : (M+2)⁺ : (M+4)⁺ ratio is close to 1:2:1 due to the natural abundances of the ⁷⁹Br and ⁸¹Br isotopes.\n*   However, the most intense peak in the entire spectrum (the base peak) is at m/z 225. Let's analyze the isotopic cluster around this peak.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Base Peak Cluster**\n\n*   The base peak is at m/z 225 with a relative intensity of 100%.\n*   There are accompanying isotope peaks at m/z 227 (66.7%) and m/z 229 (22.2%).\n*   Let's compare the intensity ratio of m/z 225 to m/z 227, which is 100 : 66.7. This ratio is very close to the theoretical ratio for a species containing two chlorine atoms (Cl₂). The expected ratio for M⁺ : (M+2)⁺ is approximately 100 : 65 (2 * 32.5%), as the natural abundance of ³⁷Cl is about 32.5% that of ³⁵Cl.\n*   This strong evidence suggests that the cluster starting at m/z 225 represents the molecular ion of the primary compound in the sample, and that this compound contains two chlorine atoms. The peaks at m/z 258-262 are likely due to a co-eluting dibrominated impurity. We will proceed by identifying the main component.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\n*   Assuming the molecular ion (M⁺) is at m/z 225.\n*   The mass of the molecular ion is 225, which is an odd number. According to the **Nitrogen Rule**, a molecule with an odd molecular weight must contain an odd number of nitrogen atoms. Let's assume there is one nitrogen atom (N).\n*   The molecule contains two chlorine atoms (Cl₂).\n*   The mass contribution from the non-C,H part is (1 * N) + (2 * ³⁵Cl) = 14 + 70 = 84 u.\n*   The remaining mass for the hydrocarbon part (CₓHᵧ) is 225 - 84 = 141 u.\n*   We need to find a CₓHᵧ combination with a mass of 141. A plausible formula is C₁₁H₉ (11 * 12 + 9 * 1 = 132 + 9 = 141).\n*   Thus, the proposed molecular formula for the compound is **C₁₁H₉NCl₂**.\n*   Let's check the degree of unsaturation (DBE) for this formula:\n    DBE = C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 + N/2 = 11 + 1 - 9/2 - 2/2 + 1/2 = 12 - 4.5 - 1 + 0.5 = 7. A DBE of 7 suggests an aromatic ring plus additional double or triple bonds.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Key Fragmentation Peaks**\n\n*   **M⁺ (m/z 225):** The molecular ion is also the base peak, which is common for stable aromatic or conjugated systems.\n*   **[M-Cl]⁺ (m/z 190):** There is a strong peak at m/z 190 (48.4%). The mass difference is 225 - 190 = 35 u, corresponding to the loss of a chlorine radical. This is a very common fragmentation for chlorinated aromatic compounds. The resulting fragment [C₁₁H₉NCl]⁺ has an isotope peak at m/z 192 (24.5%), which is consistent with the presence of one remaining chlorine atom.\n*   **[M-HCl]⁺ (m/z 189):** A smaller peak at m/z 189 (1.61%) corresponds to the loss of a neutral HCl molecule (36 u), another characteristic fragmentation.\n\n**Step 5: Propose a Structure and Provide the IUPAC Name**\n\n*   The formula C₁₁H₉NCl₂ (DBE=7) and the fragmentation pattern point towards an aromatic nitrile structure. A known compound that fits this data is a substituted cinnamonitrile.\n*   The structure is a but-2-enenitrile backbone with substituents.\n*   The proposed structure is: 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-methylbut-2-enenitrile.\n    *   This structure has the formula C₁₁H₉NCl₂.\n    *   It contains a 3,4-dichlorophenyl ring, a double bond, and a nitrile group, which accounts for the DBE of 7 (4 for the ring, 1 for the C=C bond, 2 for the C≡N bond).\n    *   The conjugated system provides stability to the molecular ion, explaining why it's the base peak.\n*   **IUPAC Name:**\n    1.  The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN).\n    2.  The longest carbon chain including the nitrile carbon is four atoms long, and it contains a double bond starting at C2 (numbering from the nitrile C as C1). Thus, the parent name is **but-2-enenitrile**.\n    3.  There is a methyl group on C2, making it **2-methylbut-2-enenitrile**.\n    4.  There is a 3,4-dichlorophenyl group attached to C3.\n    5.  Putting it all together, the systematic IUPAC name is **3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-methylbut-2-enenitrile**.\n\n<<<3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-methylbut-2-enenitrile>>>"
