The main difference is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, causing the capsule to be upright and immersed within the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctive long and curved (arcuate) seta, which causes the capsule to be exserted and to nod or hang downwards.
