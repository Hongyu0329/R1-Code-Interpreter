    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for the *main difference* in the *sporophyte* between two specific moss species, *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. The key is that this difference should be obvious enough to distinguish them \"at a glance.\"\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Terminology**\n*   **Sporophyte:** In mosses, this is the spore-producing generation that grows out of the leafy green gametophyte. It typically consists of a foot, a stalk called a **seta**, and a **capsule** where spores develop.\n*   ***Grimmia montana*** **and** ***Grimmia curviseta***: These are two distinct species within the same genus, *Grimmia*. Often, closely related species are distinguished by specific features of their reproductive structures.\n*   **\"At a glance\":** This implies a large, macroscopic, and easily visible feature, not one that requires a microscope or detailed dissection.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Species Names for Clues**\nThe scientific name of a species can often provide a clue to its characteristics.\n*   ***Grimmia montana***: \"Montana\" refers to mountains, indicating its typical habitat, but doesn't describe its morphology.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta***: This name is highly descriptive. \"Curvi-\" is Latin for curved, and \"seta\" is the stalk of the sporophyte. Therefore, the name itself suggests that *Grimmia curviseta* has a **curved seta**.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Sporophyte Structures**\nBased on the clue from the name and confirmed by bryological literature, we can compare the sporophytes of the two species:\n*   ***Grimmia montana***: This species is characterized by having a very short and **straight seta**. Because the seta is straight and short, the capsule is typically held upright and is either **immersed** (hidden among the leaves) or just **emergent** (peeking out from the leaves), as seen in the provided image.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta***: As its name indicates, this species has a prominent, strongly **curved (arcuate) seta**. This curved stalk causes the capsule to be exserted (held well above the leaves) and to hang downwards or nod to the side (cernuous).\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Main Distinguishing Feature**\nThe most obvious and visually striking difference between the two sporophytes is the **curvature of the seta** and the resulting **orientation of the capsule**.\n\n*   An upright, immersed capsule points to a **straight seta** (characteristic of *G. montana*).\n*   A nodding or hanging capsule points to a **curved seta** (characteristic of *G. curviseta*).\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   This distinction is only possible when the mosses have mature sporophytes.\n*   The image provided shows moss capsules that are upright and nestled within the plant mat, which is consistent with the straight, short seta of *Grimmia montana* or a similar species, not *Grimmia curviseta*.\n*   While other subtle differences might exist in capsule shape or peristome teeth, the seta curvature is the primary feature for identification \"at a glance.\"\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe main difference in the sporophyte that helps distinguish *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the seta. *Grimmia montana* has a short, straight seta that holds the capsule upright and immersed among the leaves, whereas *Grimmia curviseta* has a distinctively curved (arcuate) seta that causes its capsule to nod or hang down.\n\n<<<The main difference is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, causing the capsule to be upright and immersed within the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctive long and curved (arcuate) seta, which causes the capsule to be exserted and to nod or hang downwards."
