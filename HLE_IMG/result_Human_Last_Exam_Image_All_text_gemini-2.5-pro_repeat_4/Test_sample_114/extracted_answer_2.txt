The high regioselectivity observed in Reaction 3 is caused by steric hindrance. The intermediate formed from N-acetyl-proline is a rigid, bicyclic Münchnone. The two reacting carbons of this 1,3-dipole are sterically distinct: C2 bears a relatively small methyl group, while C4 is a highly hindered carbon at a fused ring junction. The cycloaddition reaction with the asymmetric alkyne, methyl propiolate, is therefore controlled by sterics. The large carbomethoxy (-COOMe) group of the alkyne attacks the less-hindered C2 position of the Münchnone, while the small hydrogen atom attacks the more-hindered C4 position, leading to a single regioisomeric product.

The results from Reactions 1 and 2 are crucial for this rationale because they establish a baseline. Reaction 2 shows that when the Münchnone's C2 and C4 positions are sterically similar (both bearing methyl groups), the reaction is completely non-regioselective, producing a 1:1 mixture of products. This demonstrates that there is no inherent electronic preference for the reaction, and thus the selectivity in Reaction 3 must arise from the structural difference of its intermediate, which is the steric factor.
