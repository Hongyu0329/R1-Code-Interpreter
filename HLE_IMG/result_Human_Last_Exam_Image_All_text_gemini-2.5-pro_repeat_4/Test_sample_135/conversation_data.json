    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the altarpiece detail:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual evidence in the image.**\n*   **Medium and Technique:** The artwork is a relief sculpture, which means the figures are raised from a flat background. The surface has a smooth, slightly glossy finish, characteristic of glazed terracotta. This technique was famously pioneered and perfected in 15th-century Florence.\n*   **Style:** The style of the figures is typical of the Italian Early Renaissance. They are rendered with naturalism, grace, and a sense of calm piety. The composition is balanced and harmonious, contained within a circular frame (a tondo). The frame itself is ornate, decorated with classical motifs like egg-and-dart.\n*   **Subject Matter:** The scene is clearly religious. A priest, standing before an altar with a lit candle, is administering the Eucharist (Holy Communion) to a group of kneeling figures, including a child in the foreground.\n*   **Inscription:** At the bottom of the circular relief, there is a cartouche with the inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This is an archaic form of Italian that translates to \"Sacraments of the Altar,\" confirming the subject is the sacrament of the Eucharist.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the evidence to a specific artist and workshop.**\n*   The combination of the glazed terracotta medium and the specific High Renaissance style strongly points to the workshop of the Della Robbia family in Florence.\n*   Luca della Robbia (c. 1399/1400â€“1482) was the founder of this dynasty of sculptors and is considered the master of this technique. His work is known for its serenity, clarity, and classical elegance, all of which are present in the image.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific artwork and confirm the artist.**\n*   Searching for a glazed terracotta relief by Della Robbia depicting the \"Sacrament of the Altar\" or \"Eucharist\" leads to a specific, well-known work: the **Tabernacle of the Holy Sacrament** (also known as the Tabernacle of Peretola).\n*   This tabernacle was commissioned for the church of Santa Maria in Peretola, near Florence, and was created by **Luca della Robbia** between 1441 and 1443.\n*   The image provided is a detail of the predella (the base) of this tabernacle. The predella consists of several reliefs depicting scenes related to the sacraments. This specific roundel represents the Sacrament of the Eucharist.\n*   The entire work is now housed in the Museo Nazionale del Bargello in Florence and is universally attributed to Luca della Robbia.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the distinctive style, the unique medium of glazed terracotta, the subject matter, and the identification of the specific artwork as a detail from the Tabernacle of Peretola, the author is Luca della Robbia.\n\n<<<Luca della Robbia>>>"
