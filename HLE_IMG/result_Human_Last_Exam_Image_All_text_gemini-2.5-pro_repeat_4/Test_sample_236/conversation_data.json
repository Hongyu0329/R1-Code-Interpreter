    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Subject**\nThe image features an insect as its central subject. The insect is perched on a cluster of small, bright yellow flowers. The background is a soft-focus green and yellow, suggesting a natural, outdoor environment.\n\n**Step 2: Detailed Analysis of the Insect's Morphology**\n*   **Order:** The insect has the characteristic features of a \"true bug\" belonging to the order Hemiptera. This is indicated by its body shape, the visible parts of its wings (which appear to be hemelytra - hardened at the base and membranous at the tips), and its long, segmented antennae.\n*   **Coloration and Pattern:** The insect exhibits a striking aposematic (warning) coloration of black and orange-red.\n    *   **Head:** The head is black.\n    *   **Pronotum (the plate behind the head):** It is predominantly orange-red with a black marking or stripe in the center.\n    *   **Wings (Hemelytra):** The visible parts of the wings are mostly black but have distinct orange-red markings. From the side view, we can see an orange-red border. If viewed from above, these markings often form an 'X' shape.\n    *   **Legs and Antennae:** Both the legs and the antennae are black.\n\n**Step 3: Identification of the Plant**\nThe insect is on a flower head composed of many tiny yellow florets. This plant is characteristic of goldenrod (*Solidago* species), which blooms in late summer and fall and is a common nectar source for many insects.\n\n**Step 4: Combining Clues for Identification**\nBased on the distinct black and orange-red 'X' pattern (partially visible), the specific pattern on the pronotum, and its presence on a flowering plant like goldenrod, the insect can be identified.\n*   It is not a Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*), which has a different pattern of red lines on its pronotum and wing veins.\n*   It is not a Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*), which has a black band across its back rather than an 'X' pattern.\n*   The features strongly match those of the **Small Milkweed Bug**. Despite its common name, this bug is a generalist feeder on various plant seeds and is also commonly found taking nectar from flowers like goldenrod.\n\n**Step 5: Determining the Scientific Name**\nThe common name of the insect is the Small Milkweed Bug. The corresponding scientific name for this species is *Lygaeus kalmii*. This binomial name consists of the genus name, *Lygaeus*, and the species epithet, *kalmii*.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy carefully analyzing the insect's physical characteristics (color, pattern, body shape) and its context (on a goldenrod flower), it is identified as the Small Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name is *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"
