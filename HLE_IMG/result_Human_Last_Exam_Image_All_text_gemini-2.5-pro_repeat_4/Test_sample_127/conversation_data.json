    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the molecular structure:** The image shows a coordination complex with a central Iridium (Ir) ion. The complex has a +1 charge. It is an octahedral complex, meaning the Iridium is coordinated to six atoms from three bidentate ligands.\n2.  **Identify the ligands:**\n    *   Ligand 1: Composed of rings A (phenyl) and B (pyridine). This is a phenylpyridine-type ligand, which acts as a C^N bidentate ligand, meaning it binds to the metal through one carbon and one nitrogen atom. This is a cyclometalating ligand.\n    *   Ligand 2: Composed of rings C (phenyl) and D (pyridine). This is another phenylpyridine-type ligand, also acting as a C^N bidentate ligand.\n    *   Ligand 3: Composed of rings E and F (both pyridines). This is a 2,2'-bipyridine-type ligand, which acts as an N^N bidentate ligand, binding through two nitrogen atoms.\n3.  **Identify the substituent rings:** The question asks about the free rotation of the peripheral phenyl rings labeled G, H, J, K, and L.\n4.  **Define \"free rotation\":** In chemistry, free rotation can occur around single bonds (like the C-C bond connecting a phenyl substituent to the main ligand framework) unless there is a significant energy barrier. The most common cause of a high rotational barrier is steric hindrance, which occurs when bulky atomic groups are too close to each other and repel, preventing rotation.\n5.  **Analyze the position and steric environment of each substituent ring:**\n    *   **Ring G:** It is attached to position 4 of the pyridine ring F. Position 4 of a pyridine ring in a coordinated bipyridine ligand is located on the \"outside\" or periphery of the complex, pointing away from the crowded metal center. The atoms adjacent to the point of attachment on ring F are hydrogens (at positions 3 and 5), which are small. Therefore, there is negligible steric hindrance, and **ring G can rotate freely**.\n    *   **Ring H:** It is attached to position 4 of the phenyl ring A. Similar to ring G, the C4 position of this phenyl ring is on the periphery of the ligand, pointing away from the metal center. Rotation of ring H around its connecting C-C bond would not cause significant clashes with other parts of the molecule. Therefore, **ring H can rotate freely**.\n    *   **Ring J:** It is attached to position 4 of the phenyl ring C. The situation is identical to that of ring H. The C4 position is on the periphery, and rotation is not sterically hindered. Therefore, **ring J can rotate freely**.\n    *   **Ring K:** It is attached to position 6 of the phenyl ring A. The diagram shows the Iridium atom is also bonded to this C6 position (this is called cyclometalation). Even if the diagram is schematic and the cyclometalation actually occurs at the more common C2 position, the C6 position is *ortho* to the carbon linking the two rings of the ligand (C1). In the tightly packed octahedral geometry of the complex, this *ortho* position is sterically very crowded. A bulky phenyl group (ring K) at this position would be in close proximity to the adjacent pyridine ring (B) and one of the other ligands (like ring E). This severe steric clash would create a high energy barrier for rotation. Therefore, **ring K cannot rotate freely**.\n    *   **Ring L:** It is attached to position 6 of the phenyl ring C. The situation is identical to that of ring K. It is attached at a sterically hindered position (C6) on the cyclometalated ligand. Its rotation would be restricted by clashes with the adjacent pyridine ring (D) and the bipyridine ligand (specifically ring F). Therefore, **ring L cannot rotate freely**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis of steric hindrance, the phenyl rings that can rotate freely are G, H, and J. The rotation of rings K and L is restricted due to significant steric hindrance.\n\n7.  **Match with Answer Choices:** The set of freely rotating rings is {G, H, J}. This matches answer choice E.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   The primary factor determining free rotation is steric hindrance.\n    *   Substituents on the periphery of a large complex (like at C4 positions here) are generally unhindered.\n    *   Substituents in the crowded interior of the complex, especially near the metal center or in *ortho*-like positions on chelating ligands (like at C6 positions here), are generally hindered.\n    *   The exact point of cyclometalation (C2 vs. C6) shown in the diagram is ambiguous or potentially incorrect from a chemical bonding standpoint (a single aromatic carbon cannot bond to four other groups as implied). However, regardless of the exact bonding, the C6 position is inherently sterically crowded in the final complex, leading to the same conclusion about restricted rotation for K and L.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n- Rings at unhindered peripheral C4 positions: G, H, J -> Free rotation.\n- Rings at hindered internal C6 positions: K, L -> Restricted rotation.\n- The set of rings that can rotate freely is {G, H, J}.\n- This corresponds to option E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
