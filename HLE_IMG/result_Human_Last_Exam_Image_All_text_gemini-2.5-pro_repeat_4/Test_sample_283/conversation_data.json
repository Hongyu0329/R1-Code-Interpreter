    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Google Trends chart to determine the country in question.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Chart's Structure**\nThe chart is a Google Trends graph, which displays the relative search interest for different topics over a period of time.\n*   **X-axis (Time):** The timeline runs from December 1, 2019, to sometime after May 28, 2023.\n*   **Y-axis (Interest):** This is a relative scale from 0 to 100, where 100 represents the highest point of search interest for any of the terms within the selected timeframe and region.\n*   **Lines (Topics):** There are three lines (red, blue, and yellow), each representing a distinct search topic. The prompt states these are three different \"historic events.\"\n\n**Step 2: Identify Patterns in the Data**\nA key feature of the chart is the presence of sharp, recurring peaks for all three lines. This cyclical pattern strongly suggests that the \"historic events\" are anniversaries or national holidays that are commemorated annually. Our goal is to identify the dates of these annual peaks.\n\n*   **Yellow Line:** This line shows very sharp, high peaks.\n    *   We can see a peak occurs each year sometime between the \"May 28\" and \"Aug 29\" gridlines. This points to an event in June or July. Given its prominence (often hitting the 100 mark), this is likely a major national day. A very strong candidate is an Independence Day in early July.\n*   **Blue Line:** This line shows smaller, but still distinct, annual peaks.\n    *   These peaks consistently occur just before or around the \"May 28\" gridline each year. This indicates an annual event in late May.\n*   **Red Line:** This line shows significant annual peaks, generally higher than the blue line but lower than the yellow line.\n    *   The first peak occurs shortly after the \"Dec 1, 2019\" mark. Subsequent peaks appear to be in the same early December timeframe each year. This points to an annual event in early December.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate a Hypothesis based on the Patterns**\nWe are looking for a single country that has three major, annually commemorated historical events corresponding to these dates:\n1.  **Early December** (Red Line)\n2.  **Late May** (Blue Line)\n3.  **Early July** (Yellow Line)\n\nLet's test this hypothesis against the history of a major country, for example, the United States.\n\n*   **Early July Event (Yellow Line):** The United States celebrates **Independence Day** on **July 4th**. This is arguably the most prominent national holiday and would generate a massive spike in searches every year, fitting the pattern of the yellow line perfectly.\n*   **Late May Event (Blue Line):** The United States observes **Memorial Day** on the last Monday of May. This is a federal holiday to remember military personnel who died in service. The timing fits the blue line's peaks exactly.\n*   **Early December Event (Red Line):** The **attack on Pearl Harbor** occurred on **December 7th**, 1941. This date is commemorated annually in the U.S. as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. It is a significant historical event that would generate a spike in search interest every year on its anniversary, matching the pattern of the red line.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Hypothesis**\nThe three identified U.S. events align perfectly with the data:\n*   **Independence Day (July 4th)** matches the prominent early July peaks (yellow line).\n*   **Memorial Day (last Monday in May)** matches the late May peaks (blue line).\n*   **Pearl Harbor Day (December 7th)** matches the early December peaks (red line).\n\nAll three are significant \"historic events\" that happened in or are central to the history of a single country. The relative search volumes are also plausible: Independence Day (a major celebration) gets the most searches, followed by the solemn remembrance of Pearl Harbor, and then Memorial Day. It is evident to a historian that this combination of dates points directly to the United States.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
