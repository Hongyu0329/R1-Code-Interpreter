    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual information.**\n*   The image consists of two graphs. The top graph is a spectrogram, and the bottom graph is a waveform. Both represent the same sound signal over time.\n*   **Spectrogram (Top):** This graph shows frequency on the y-axis and time on the x-axis. The intensity of a frequency at a certain time is shown by the color/brightness.\n    *   We see a strong, narrow horizontal band, which represents a pure tone of a constant frequency.\n    *   In the middle of the timeline, this tone is interrupted.\n    *   Exactly at the point of interruption, there is a vertical smear covering a wide range of frequencies. This represents a burst of noise.\n    *   After the noise burst, the pure tone resumes.\n*   **Waveform (Bottom):** This graph shows the amplitude of the sound wave on the y-axis and time on the x-axis.\n    *   The left part shows a regular, repeating sine wave, which corresponds to the pure tone.\n    *   The middle section shows an irregular, chaotic wave pattern, which corresponds to the burst of noise. This noise *replaces* the sine wave; the sine wave is physically absent during this interval.\n    *   The right part shows the resumption of the regular sine wave.\n*   **Conclusion from Visuals:** The physical reality depicted is a pure tone that is stopped, replaced by a short burst of noise, and then starts again. There is a clear gap in the tone.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the textual clues.**\n*   **Clue 1: \"...an illusion...\"**: This tells us that what is perceived is different from the physical reality shown in the graphs.\n*   **Clue 2: \"...similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity...\"**: The Necker Cube is an ambiguous figure where the brain can flip between two equally valid 3D interpretations. This clue suggests the auditory phenomenon also involves the brain settling on one interpretation out of possible alternatives. The two alternatives here are:\n    1.  A tone stops, noise plays, and the tone restarts.\n    2.  A continuous tone is momentarily masked by a burst of noise.\n*   **Clue 3: \"...reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability.\"**: This indicates that the illusion is not a trick but a fundamental function of our perceptual system that helps us make sense of the world, particularly in noisy environments. The brain \"fills in\" missing information to create a coherent perception.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the information and identify the phenomenon.**\n*   The stimulus is a tone with a segment cut out and replaced by noise.\n*   The description implies that despite the physical gap, a listener will perceive the tone as being continuous, sounding as if it carried on \"behind\" the noise.\n*   The brain's ability to \"restore\" missing parts of an auditory signal (like speech or a tone) when they are replaced by a masking sound is a well-documented auditory illusion. It actively \"fills in the blanks.\"\n*   This phenomenon is most famously known as the **phonemic restoration effect**, a term coined by psychologist Richard Warren who first demonstrated it in 1970. Although his initial experiments used speech sounds (phonemes), the principle applies to non-speech sounds like the pure tone shown in the image. It is a prime example of perceptual completion or auditory continuity.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The key is realizing that the illusion is auditory, not visual. The graphs are just representations of the sound.\n*   The connection to the Necker Cube is about perceptual ambiguity and the brain's preference for a simpler, more continuous interpretation.\n*   The term \"phonemic\" might seem specific to speech, but the effect itself is more general, and \"phonemic restoration effect\" is the common name used for this class of illusion.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation:**\nBased on the analysis, the phenomenon described is the brain's tendency to perceptually fill in a missing sound when it is replaced by a plausible masking sound. The standard name for this auditory illusion is the phonemic restoration effect.\n\n<<<Phonemic restoration effect>>>"
