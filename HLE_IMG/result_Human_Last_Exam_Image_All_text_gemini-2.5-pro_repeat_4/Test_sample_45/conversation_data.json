    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the rotational symmetry of the tiling shown in the image. Rotational symmetry means the pattern looks the same after being rotated by a certain angle around a central point. We are looking for the highest \"order\" of rotation, which is the number of times the pattern matches itself in a full 360° turn. The possible rotational symmetries for a periodic 2D tiling are limited by the Crystallographic Restriction Theorem to 1-fold (no symmetry), 2-fold (180°), 3-fold (120°), 4-fold (90°), and 6-fold (60°).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Component Shapes**\nThe tiling is composed of three distinct shapes, identifiable by their color and form:\n*   **Blue hexagons:** 6-sided polygons.\n*   **Light yellow squares:** 4-sided polygons that appear to be squares.\n*   **Orange rhombi:** 4-sided polygons with equal sides but non-90° angles.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Potential Centers of Rotation**\nWe will examine the centers of each type of tile to see if they are centers of rotational symmetry for the entire pattern.\n\n*   **Analysis of a Blue Hexagon's Center:**\n    1.  Let's carefully observe the tiles adjacent to a single blue hexagon.\n    2.  Starting from the top edge and moving clockwise, the adjacent tiles are: Rhombus, Square, Rhombus, Square, Rhombus, Square.\n    3.  Let's test for 6-fold symmetry (60° rotation). A 60° rotation would move the top rhombus to the position of the top-right square. Since a rhombus is not a square, the pattern does not have 6-fold symmetry around this point.\n    4.  Let's test for 3-fold symmetry (120° rotation). A 120° rotation moves the top rhombus to the position of the bottom-right rhombus. It also moves the top-right square to the position of the bottom square. This mapping is consistent for all tiles around the hexagon.\n    5.  **Conclusion:** The center of each blue hexagon is a center of **3-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n*   **Analysis of a Yellow Square's Center:**\n    1.  Let's observe the tiles adjacent to a yellow square.\n    2.  The adjacent tiles are: Hexagon (top), Rhombus (right), Hexagon (bottom), Rhombus (left).\n    3.  Let's test for 4-fold symmetry (90° rotation). A 90° rotation would move the top hexagon to the position of the right rhombus. Since a hexagon is not a rhombus, the pattern is not 4-fold symmetric around this point.\n    4.  Let's test for 2-fold symmetry (180° rotation). A 180° rotation swaps the top hexagon with the bottom hexagon, and the right rhombus with the left rhombus. This is a valid symmetry.\n    5.  **Conclusion:** The center of each yellow square is a center of **2-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n*   **Analysis of an Orange Rhombus's Center:**\n    1.  An orange rhombus is connected to two hexagons (at its obtuse angles) and two squares (at its acute angles).\n    2.  A 180° rotation (2-fold symmetry) around the center of the rhombus swaps the two hexagons and the two squares. This is a valid symmetry.\n    3.  **Conclusion:** The center of each orange rhombus is also a center of **2-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Findings**\nOur analysis has revealed that the tiling possesses multiple centers of rotation:\n*   3-fold rotation centers (at the heart of the blue hexagons).\n*   2-fold rotation centers (at the heart of the yellow squares and orange rhombi).\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Crystallographic Restriction Theorem**\nA fundamental theorem in the study of periodic patterns states that if a 2D periodic lattice has both 2-fold and 3-fold rotational symmetry, it must be a hexagonal lattice. The symmetry group of a hexagonal lattice must include 6-fold rotations. The two wallpaper groups that have both 2-fold and 3-fold rotations are **p6** and **p6m**, and both of these groups have **6-fold rotational symmetry** as their highest order of rotation.\n\nEven though we cannot easily identify a 6-fold rotation center by looking at the center of a single tile, the proven existence of both 2-fold and 3-fold centers mathematically requires the existence of 6-fold centers in the overall pattern. These 6-fold centers are located at specific vertices where multiple tiles meet, defining the points of the underlying hexagonal lattice.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nThe tiling has rotational symmetries of order 2, 3, and 6. The question asks for \"the\" rotational symmetry, which conventionally refers to the highest order present in the pattern's symmetry group. Therefore, the rotational symmetry of the tiling is 6-fold.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
