    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the characters on the seal.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Seal Orientation and Reading Order:** The image displays a physical seal stone. The characters are carved in reverse so that they appear correctly when stamped. For readability, we will analyze the characters as they would appear in an impression, which means we must mentally flip the image horizontally or assume the photo has already been flipped. The standard reading order for traditional Chinese seals with four characters is from top to bottom, and from right to left.\n    *   We read the right column first (top character, then bottom character).\n    *   Then we read the left column (top character, then bottom character).\n\n2.  **Character Identification (reading as an impression):**\n    *   **Top-Right Character:** This character is 壽 (shòu). Its complex form with a long base is characteristic of the seal script for longevity.\n    *   **Bottom-Right Character:** This character is 康 (kāng). The structure is clearly identifiable as the character for health.\n    *   **Top-Left Character:** This character is 不 (bù). It is a stylized version of the character meaning \"not\" or \"no\".\n    *   **Bottom-Left Character:** This character is 疆 (jiāng). The components of the character for \"boundary\" or \"limit\" are visible in the seal script style.\n\n3.  **Combining the Characters and Interpretation:** Following the standard reading order (top to bottom, right to left), the characters form the phrase: **壽康不疆 (shòu kāng bù jiāng)**.\n    *   **壽 (shòu):** longevity, long life\n    *   **康 (kāng):** health, peace\n    *   **不 (bù):** not, no (used here to mean \"without\")\n    *   **疆 (jiāng):** boundary, limit\n    *   The full phrase translates to \"Longevity and health without limit/bounds.\" This is a message of blessing, similar in meaning to the more common idiom \"万寿无疆\" (wàn shòu wú jiāng), but using a different combination of characters.\n\n4.  **Conversion to Simplified Chinese:**\n    *   The traditional character 壽 is simplified to **寿**.\n    *   The character 康 is the same in both traditional and simplified Chinese: **康**.\n    *   The character 不 is the same in both traditional and simplified Chinese: **不**.\n    *   The character 疆 is the same in both traditional and simplified Chinese: **疆**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Seal vs. Impression:** It's crucial to distinguish between the physical seal (where characters are mirrored) and the resulting impression (where they are readable). We analyze the characters as they would appear in the final, readable impression.\n*   **Reading Direction:** While top-to-bottom, right-to-left is standard for four-character seals, other orders exist. However, this order forms the most coherent and meaningful phrase from the identified characters.\n*   **Character Variation:** Seal script (篆书, zhuànshū) has many stylistic variations. The identification relies on recognizing the core components and structure of each character despite the artistic stylization.\n*   **Phrase Meaning:** The phrase \"壽康不疆\" is not a common idiom found in dictionaries but is a meaningful and auspicious phrase constructed for a seal, with \"不\" serving the same purpose as \"无\" (without/boundless).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThe characters on the seal, read in the proper order and converted to simplified Chinese, are **寿康不疆**.\n\n<<<寿康不疆>>>"
