    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral centers.**\nA chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In the given molecule, there are three such centers. Let's label them from left to right for clarity:\n*   **C2:** The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group and a methyl (-CH3) group.\n*   **C3:** The central carbon atom bonded to the ethyl (-CH2CH3) group.\n*   **C4:** The carbon atom bonded to a methyl (-CH3) group and an aminomethyl (-CH2NH2) group.\n\nThe implicit fourth bond on each of these carbons is to a hydrogen atom (-H). The stereochemistry of this hydrogen is determined by the tetrahedral geometry around the carbon.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the absolute configuration (R or S) for each chiral center using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.**\n\n**Analysis of Chiral Center C2 (leftmost):**\n1.  **Identify the four groups attached to C2:**\n    *   -OH (hydroxyl)\n    *   -C3H(Et)R (the rest of the molecule, starting with C3)\n    *   -CH3 (methyl)\n    *   -H (hydrogen)\n2.  **Assign priorities based on atomic number:**\n    *   Priority 1: -OH (Oxygen, atomic number 8)\n    *   Priority 2: -C3H(Et)R (Carbon attached to other carbons)\n    *   Priority 3: -CH3 (Carbon attached to hydrogens)\n    *   Priority 4: -H (Hydrogen, atomic number 1)\n3.  **Determine the 3D arrangement:**\n    *   The drawing shows the bond to -OH as dashed (going back) and the bond to -CH3 also as dashed (going back). The bond to C3 is in the plane of the drawing.\n    *   For a tetrahedral carbon, if two bonds are dashed and one is in the plane, the fourth bond (to -H) must be wedged (coming forward).\n4.  **Determine the configuration:**\n    *   The lowest priority group (-H, P4) is pointing towards the viewer (wedge).\n    *   We trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3: -OH (P1, back) → -C3 (P2, plane) → -CH3 (P3, back). This path is clockwise.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group is in the front, we reverse the result. Clockwise becomes S.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C2 is **S**.\n\n**Analysis of Chiral Center C3 (central):**\n1.  **Identify the four groups attached to C3:**\n    *   -C2H(OH)CH3 (group to the left)\n    *   -C4H(CH3)CH2NH2 (group to the right)\n    *   -CH2CH3 (ethyl)\n    *   -H (hydrogen)\n2.  **Assign priorities:**\n    *   We compare the first atom of each substituent attached to C3. All are carbon. We then look at the atoms attached to these carbons.\n    *   From -C2H(OH)CH3: Carbon C2 is attached to {O, C, H}.\n    *   From -C4H(CH3)CH2NH2: Carbon C4 is attached to {C, C, N}. Let me re-examine the connectivity on C4. C4 is bonded to C3, H, CH3, and CH2NH2. Thus, the atoms attached to C4 are {C(from C3), C(from Me), C(from CH2NH2), H}. From C3's perspective, C4 is a carbon attached to {C, C, H}. The atoms attached to the carbons in the C4 group are {N, H, H} on one branch and {H, H, H} on another.\n    *   From -CH2CH3: The first carbon is attached to {C, H, H}.\n    *   Comparing the groups: The C2 group has an Oxygen, which has a higher atomic number than Nitrogen or Carbon. Thus, the C2 group is priority 1. The C4 group has a Nitrogen at the next position, making it higher priority than the ethyl group.\n    *   Priority 1: -C2H(OH)CH3\n    *   Priority 2: -C4H(CH3)CH2NH2\n    *   Priority 3: -CH2CH3\n    *   Priority 4: -H\n3.  **Determine the 3D arrangement:**\n    *   The bond to the ethyl group is wedged (forward). The bonds to C2 and C4 are in the plane.\n    *   Therefore, the implicit bond to -H (P4) must be dashed (going back).\n4.  **Determine the configuration:**\n    *   The lowest priority group (-H, P4) is in the back.\n    *   We trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3: -C2 (P1, left) → -C4 (P2, right) → -CH2CH3 (P3, up/forward). This path is clockwise.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group is in the back, clockwise means R.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C3 is **R**.\n\n**Analysis of Chiral Center C4 (rightmost):**\n1.  **Identify the four groups attached to C4:**\n    *   -CH2NH2 (aminomethyl)\n    *   -C3H(Et)R (the rest of the molecule, starting with C3)\n    *   -CH3 (methyl)\n    *   -H (hydrogen)\n2.  **Assign priorities:**\n    *   Priority 1: -CH2NH2 (The first carbon is attached to Nitrogen, atomic number 7)\n    *   Priority 2: -C3H(Et)R (The first carbon, C3, is attached to other carbons)\n    *   Priority 3: -CH3 (The carbon is attached only to hydrogens)\n    *   Priority 4: -H\n3.  **Determine the 3D arrangement:**\n    *   The bond to -CH2NH2 is wedged (forward). The bond to -CH3 is dashed (back). The bond to C3 is in the plane.\n    *   Therefore, the implicit bond to -H must also be in the plane.\n4.  **Determine the configuration:**\n    *   This orientation is tricky. We can use the swapping method. Swap the lowest priority group (-H, P4, in the plane) with the group pointing back (-CH3, P3, dashed). This will reverse the configuration.\n    *   New arrangement: -H is now dashed (back). -CH3 is now in the plane.\n    *   Now, with -H in the back, we trace the path 1 → 2 → 3: -CH2NH2 (P1, wedge) → -C3 (P2, plane) → -CH3 (P3, plane). This path is counter-clockwise.\n    *   So, the configuration of the swapped molecule is S.\n    *   Since we performed one swap, the original configuration is the opposite.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C4 is **R**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe absolute configurations of the chiral centers, from left to right (C2, C3, C4), are S, R, and R, respectively. If we number the carbons based on the IUPAC name (3-(2-amino-1-methylethyl)pentan-2-ol), the chiral centers are C2, C3, and C1' of the substituent, which correspond to the centers analyzed. The configuration is (2S, 3R, 1'R).\n\nFinal configuration sequence from left to right is S, R, R.\n\n<<<S, R, R>>>"
