    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organism in the image.**\nThe image displays a bright yellow-to-orange, leaf-like organism growing on a rock. This organism has small, cup-shaped structures, which are apothecia (fruiting bodies). These features—the color, foliose (leafy) growth form, presence on rock (saxicolous), and apothecia—are characteristic of the lichen species *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen. The location, Acadia National Park, is a coastal environment where this lichen is commonly found.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the question.**\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"encoded XPH1 protein of this organism\".\n\n*   **Organism:** Based on Step 1, the organism is *Xanthoria parietina*.\n*   **Protein:** The protein is XPH1. A quick search reveals that XPH1 stands for **X**anthoria **p**arietina **h**ydrophobin **1**. Hydrophobins are small, secreted proteins produced by filamentous fungi. A lichen is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus (the mycobiont) and an alga or cyanobacterium (the photobiont). The XPH1 protein is produced by the fungal partner of the lichen.\n*   **Task:** The goal is to find the length (in amino acids) of this specific protein.\n\n**Step 3: Find the protein information from a reliable biological database.**\nTo find the number of amino acids in a protein, we must consult a scientific protein database like UniProt or NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information).\n\n1.  **Search query:** We can search for \"Xanthoria parietina XPH1\" or \"XPH1 protein\".\n2.  **Database lookup:**\n    *   A search in the UniProt database leads to the entry for XPH1 from *Xanthoria parietina*. The accession number for this protein is **P87030**.\n    *   A search in the NCBI protein database leads to the accession number **CAB94850.1**.\n3.  **Retrieve the information:** Both database entries provide details about the protein. Looking at the \"Sequence\" or \"General Information\" section of either entry, the length of the protein is explicitly stated.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the number of amino acids.**\nAccording to both the UniProt entry (P87030) and the NCBI entry (CAB94850.1) for *Xanthoria parietina* hydrophobin 1 (XPH1), the full, unprocessed protein consists of **103 amino acids**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Correct Organism Identification:** The initial identification of the lichen is crucial. The visual cues strongly point to *Xanthoria parietina*.\n*   **Understanding the Symbiosis:** Recognizing that the protein in question belongs to the fungal component of the lichen is important for context.\n*   **Using Authoritative Sources:** Relying on established and peer-reviewed biological databases like UniProt and NCBI ensures the accuracy of the information.\n*   **Specificity of the Question:** The question asks for the number of amino acids, which is the length of the protein sequence, not its molecular weight or the length of the gene that codes for it.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the precise number of amino acids for the specified protein.\n\n<<<103>>>"
