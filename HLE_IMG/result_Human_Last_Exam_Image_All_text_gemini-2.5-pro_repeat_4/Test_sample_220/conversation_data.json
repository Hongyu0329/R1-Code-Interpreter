    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which image represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Crystal Structure**\nAn FCC unit cell has atoms at the 8 corners of a cube and at the center of each of the 6 faces.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Viewing Direction [110] and the Resulting Projection**\nThe [110] direction in a cubic system points along a face diagonal. When we view a crystal lattice along a specific direction, we are projecting the 3D positions of the atoms onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to that direction. We need to determine the characteristic 2D pattern for an FCC lattice when viewed along [110].\n\n*   **Atomic Planes:** The atoms in an FCC lattice can be grouped into planes perpendicular to the [110] direction. These are the (110) family of planes.\n*   **Stacking Sequence:** Along the [110] direction, these atomic planes stack in a repeating two-layer sequence, often denoted as ...ABAB...\n*   **Pattern within Planes:**\n    *   The atoms in an \"A\" plane form a simple rectangular grid. The sides of this rectangle are parallel to the [001] and [1-10] crystal directions. If the lattice constant is 'a', the side lengths of this rectangle are 'a' and 'a√2'.\n    *   The atoms in a \"B\" plane form an identical rectangular grid, but it is shifted relative to the \"A\" plane. The shift is such that the atoms of the B plane lie exactly in the center of the rectangles formed by the atoms of the A plane.\n*   **Combined Projection:** When these two layers are projected onto a single 2D plane, the result is a **centered rectangular pattern**. This means we see atoms at the corners of a rectangle and another atom in the very center of that rectangle. The ratio of the rectangle's side lengths is √2 : 1 (approximately 1.414 : 1).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the 2D Patterns in the Given Images**\nWe will now examine the projected patterns of atoms in each of the four images. We focus on the arrangement of the atoms in the plane of the image (the X-Z plane), ignoring the depth (Y-direction) for the initial pattern identification.\n\n*   **Image A:** The atoms are arranged in a simple rectangular grid. There are no atoms in the centers of the rectangles formed by the grid points. This is not a centered rectangular pattern.\n\n*   **Image B:** The atoms form a centered pattern. We can identify rectangles (which appear as squares in this plot) with atoms at the corners and an atom in the center. For example, consider atoms at approximately (1,3), (5,3), (1,7), and (5,7). There is another atom at the center, (3,5). The side lengths are approximately 4 units in both directions (5-1=4, 7-3=4). This is a **centered square** pattern. A centered square is the characteristic projection of an FCC lattice along the [100] direction.\n\n*   **Image C:** The atoms are arranged in a distinct hexagonal pattern, resembling a honeycomb or a close-packed layer. This is the characteristic projection of an FCC lattice along the [111] direction (the body diagonal).\n\n*   **Image D:** The atoms form a centered rectangular pattern. We can identify a rectangular grid (e.g., atoms at x=1, 3, 5 and z=6, 12) and a second set of atoms that lie in the centers of these rectangles (e.g., the atom at x=2, z≈9 is in the center of the rectangle formed by corners at (1,6), (3,6), (1,12), (3,12)). The rectangle is clearly not a square; its height (12-6=6) is much larger than its width (3-1=2). While the aspect ratio in the drawing (6/2 = 3) doesn't perfectly match the theoretical √2, the topology of the pattern is a **centered rectangle**. This is the characteristic pattern for an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction. The discrepancy in the aspect ratio is likely due to the scaling of the plot axes.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, the patterns correspond to the following views of an FCC lattice:\n*   Image B: Centered square pattern, corresponding to the [100] view.\n*   Image C: Hexagonal pattern, corresponding to the [111] view.\n*   Image D: Centered rectangular pattern, corresponding to the [110] view.\n\nThe question asks for the FCC structure viewed along the [110] direction, which matches the pattern in Image D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
