    This vase painting depicts a famous scene from Greek mythology: the triumphant departure of Pelops and Hippodamia after winning a chariot race against her father, King Oenomaus.
    
    The figures can be identified as follows:
    - The Driver: The hero Pelops, wearing an ornate costume, is driving the chariot.
    - The Passenger: The woman beside him is Hippodamia, the princess he has just won as his bride.
    - The Fallen Man: The figure on the ground is King Oenomaus, who was killed during the race.
    - The Winged Figure: This is Nike, the goddess of Victory, celebrating Pelops's success.
    
    The question asks to identify 'the figure leaving the chariot'. While several interpretations are possible, the most poignant one refers to Hippodamia. She is the one being carried away from her home and family, thus 'leaving' her old life behind to start a new one with Pelops. While Pelops is also leaving, his role is that of the victor and driver, whereas Hippodamia's story is centered on this departure.
