    "My plan to answer your question is as follows:\n1.  First, I will analyze the visual elements of the ancient Greek vase painting to identify the specific mythological story being depicted. The key figures include a man driving a chariot, a woman passenger, a winged figure, and a man lying on the ground.\n2.  Based on these elements and the artistic style (Apulian red-figure), I will identify the characters as Pelops, Hippodamia, Nike, and Oenomaus.\n3.  Then, I will carefully interpret the question, \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\". This question is slightly ambiguous. It could refer to the driver (Pelops), the passenger being carried away (Hippodamia), or the figure who has been thrown from his own chariot (Oenomaus).\n4.  I will conclude that the most fitting answer is Hippodamia, as she is the one being taken from her homeland, representing the most significant act of \"leaving\" in the narrative context of the elopement.\n5.  Finally, I will present this analysis and the final answer within a Python code block as requested, using `print()` statements to deliver the information.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef identify_figure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided image of an Apulian red-figure vase to identify the mythological scene and the requested figure.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    explanation = \"\"\"\n    This vase painting depicts a famous scene from Greek mythology: the triumphant departure of Pelops and Hippodamia after winning a chariot race against her father, King Oenomaus.\n    \n    The figures can be identified as follows:\n    - The Driver: The hero Pelops, wearing an ornate costume, is driving the chariot.\n    - The Passenger: The woman beside him is Hippodamia, the princess he has just won as his bride.\n    - The Fallen Man: The figure on the ground is King Oenomaus, who was killed during the race.\n    - The Winged Figure: This is Nike, the goddess of Victory, celebrating Pelops's success.\n    \n    The question asks to identify 'the figure leaving the chariot'. While several interpretations are possible, the most poignant one refers to Hippodamia. She is the one being carried away from her home and family, thus 'leaving' her old life behind to start a new one with Pelops. While Pelops is also leaving, his role is that of the victor and driver, whereas Hippodamia's story is centered on this departure.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    final_answer = \"Hippodamia\"\n\n    # Print the detailed explanation\n    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation).strip())\n    \n    # Print the final answer to the question\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the figure leaving the chariot is:\")\n    print(final_answer)\n\nidentify_figure()\n```\n<<<Hippodamia>>>"
