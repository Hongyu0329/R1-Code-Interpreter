# This script will print the classification for the three image pairs.
# Based on the analysis:
# A: Left image appears to be a native environment (diverse), while the right image shows a classic invasion (monoculture). This is option 3.
# B: Both images show scenes characteristic of an invasive species (lupine) creating dense stands and colonizing disturbed areas. This is option 2.
# C: Both images show a non-invasive species (papaya) that is not dominating its environment, which is characteristic of a native setting. This is option 1.

# Assign the identified indices to variables.
classification_A = 3
classification_B = 2
classification_C = 1

# Print the answer in the format "A, B, C".
