# Step 1: Define the knowns from the conversation
r_yellow = 0.5  # Radius of yellow circles in cm

# Step 2: Determine the radius of the white circle (R)
# The total height H of the container is derived from the packing of circles.
# The formula is H = 4*R + 1 + 2*sqrt(R + 0.25).
# For H to be a multiple of 0.5, sqrt(R + 0.25) must be rational.
# We test values of R that are multiples of 0.5.
# R = 0.5 -> sqrt(0.75) is irrational
# R = 1.0 -> sqrt(1.25) is irrational
# R = 1.5 -> sqrt(1.75) is irrational
# R = 2.0 -> sqrt(2.25) = 1.5. This works.
R_white = 2.0
print(f"Based on the geometric constraints and the 0.5cm grid, the radius of a white circle (R) must be {R_white} cm.")

# Step 3: Determine the position of the grid of white circles.
# The grid is anchored by the bottom-left white circle, which is tangent to the
# yellow circle at the corner with center (0.5, 0.5).

# The y-coordinate of the center of the bottom row of white circles is found first.
# (cy - r_yellow)^2 + R_white^2 = (R_white + r_yellow)^2
# (cy - r_yellow)^2 = (R_white + r_yellow)^2 - R_white^2
# cy = r_yellow + sqrt((R_white + r_yellow)^2 - R_white^2) 
# A simpler derivation uses a right triangle: (cy - r_yellow)^2 = 2*R_white*r_yellow + r_yellow^2
cy_bottom_row = r_yellow + math.sqrt(2 * R_white * r_yellow + r_yellow**2)

# The x-coordinate of the center of the left-most column of white circles is found similarly.
# The yellow circle is at (r,r), the white circle is at (cx, cy).
# (cx - r_yellow)^2 + (cy - r_yellow)^2 = (R_white + r_yellow)^2
cx_left_col = r_yellow + math.sqrt((R_white + r_yellow)**2 - (cy_bottom_row - r_yellow)**2)

print(f"The center of the bottom-left white circle is at ({cx_left_col}, {cy_bottom_row}).")

# Step 4: Calculate the center of the right-most white circle.
# The white circles are on a grid with spacing 2*R in both x and y directions.
# The grid has 4 columns and 3 rows. The right-most column is the 4th one (index 3).
# We choose the circle in the middle row (index 1).
col_index = 3  # 4th column
row_index = 1  # 2nd row (middle)

x_spacing = 2 * R_white
y_spacing = 2 * R_white

final_x = cx_left_col + col_index * x_spacing
final_y = cy_bottom_row + row_index * y_spacing

# Step 5: Print the final equation and the answer.
