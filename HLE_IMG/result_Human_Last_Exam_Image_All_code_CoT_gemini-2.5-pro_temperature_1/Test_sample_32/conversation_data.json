    "My plan is to identify the key distinguishing feature between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* by consulting botanical knowledge about these two moss species. The most apparent, or \"at a glance,\" feature is often related to the macroscopic structure of the sporophyte, such as the orientation and length of the seta (stalk) and the position of the capsule. I will present this information clearly using a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef distinguish_grimmia_species():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function explains the primary visual difference between the sporophytes\n  of Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n  \"\"\"\n  main_difference = \"The main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta, which is evident at a glance, is the shape of the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule).\"\n\n  g_montana_desc = \"In Grimmia montana, the seta is short and straight. This causes the capsule to be held erect and immersed among the perichaetial (upper) leaves.\"\n\n  g_curviseta_desc = \"In Grimmia curviseta, the seta is strongly curved or S-shaped (arcuate). Its name, 'curviseta', literally means 'curved seta'. This curvature makes the capsule hang downwards or to the side (it is cernuous or nodding).\"\n\n  print(main_difference)\n  print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*20 + \"\\n\")\n  print(\"Grimmia montana:\")\n  print(\"- Seta: Straight\")\n  print(\"- Capsule Position: Erect and immersed/emergent\")\n  print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*20 + \"\\n\")\n  print(\"Grimmia curviseta:\")\n  print(\"- Seta: Curved (Arcuate/S-shaped)\")\n  print(\"- Capsule Position: Nodding or hanging\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n  distinguish_grimmia_species()\n```\n<<<The main difference is the shape of the seta (stalk).

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta that helps distinguish both species at a glance?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
