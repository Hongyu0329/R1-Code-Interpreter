    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the molecular formula of the product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction Sequence**: I will analyze the three-step reaction to understand the transformation occurring at each stage.\n    *   **Step 1 (CAN)**: This step involves the deprotection of the nitrogen atom by removing the *p*-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group.\n    *   **Step 2 (Pd/C, H₂)**: This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which reduces the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   **Step 3 (HCl, 70°C)**: This step is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis that will open the lactam (cyclic amide) ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure and Formula of Intermediates and Product**: I will first deduce the structure of the starting material, which appears to be a derivative of 2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octene. Then, I will track the changes in its molecular formula through each reaction step to arrive at the final product.\n\n3.  **Final Verification**: The final product is an amino acid with a cyclohexane core. I will count the atoms (C, H, F, N, O) in this final structure to verify the molecular formula derived from the reaction tracking.\n\n4.  **Code Generation**: I will write a Python script that calculates the final molecular formula based on the constituent atoms of the product structure, showing the calculation for each element as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the molecular formula of the final product based on its structure.\n# The reaction sequence leads to cis-4-amino-5-(trifluoromethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid.\n# We will count the atoms in this final structure.\n\n# 1. Carbon (C) atom count\n# There are 6 carbon atoms in the cyclohexane ring.\ncarbons_in_ring = 6\n# There is 1 carbon atom in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\ncarbons_in_cooh = 1\n# There is 1 carbon atom in the trifluoromethyl group (-CF3).\ncarbons_in_cf3 = 1\ntotal_carbons = carbons_in_ring + carbons_in_cooh + carbons_in_cf3\n\n# 2. Hydrogen (H) atom count\n# On the cyclohexane ring, there are 9 hydrogen atoms.\n# (CH-COOH, CH2, CH2, CH-NH2, CH-CF3, CH2) -> 1+2+2+1+1+2 = 9\nhydrogens_on_ring = 9\n# There is 1 hydrogen in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\nhydrogens_in_cooh = 1\n# There are 2 hydrogens in the amino group (-NH2).\nhydrogens_in_nh2 = 2\ntotal_hydrogens = hydrogens_on_ring + hydrogens_in_cooh + hydrogens_in_nh2\n\n# 3. Fluorine (F) atom count\n# There are 3 fluorine atoms in the trifluoromethyl group (-CF3).\ntotal_fluorines = 3\n\n# 4. Nitrogen (N) atom count\n# There is 1 nitrogen atom in the amino group (-NH2).\ntotal_nitrogens = 1\n\n# 5. Oxygen (O) atom count\n# There are 2 oxygen atoms in the carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\ntotal_oxygens = 2\n\n# As requested, printing the calculation for each element in an equation-like format.\nprint(\"Calculation of the molecular formula based on the final product's structure:\")\nprint(f\"Number of Carbon atoms (C) = {carbons_in_ring} (ring) + {carbons_in_cooh} (COOH) + {carbons_in_cf3} (CF3) = {total_carbons}\")\nprint(f\"Number of Hydrogen atoms (H) = {hydrogens_on_ring} (ring) + {hydrogens_in_cooh} (COOH) + {hydrogens_in_nh2} (NH2) = {total_hydrogens}\")\nprint(f\"Number of Fluorine atoms (F) = {total_fluorines} (CF3) = {total_fluorines}\")\nprint(f\"Number of Nitrogen atoms (N) = {total_nitrogens} (NH2) = {total_nitrogens}\")\nprint(f\"Number of Oxygen atoms (O) = {total_oxygens} (COOH) = {total_oxygens}\")\n\n# Construct and print the final molecular formula in the standard order (C, H, then alphabetical).\nmolecular_formula = f\"C{total_carbons}H{total_hydrogens}F{total_fluorines}N{total_nitrogens}O{total_oxygens}\"\nprint(f\"\\nThe final molecular formula is: {molecular_formula}\")\n```\n<<<C8H12F3NO2>>>"
