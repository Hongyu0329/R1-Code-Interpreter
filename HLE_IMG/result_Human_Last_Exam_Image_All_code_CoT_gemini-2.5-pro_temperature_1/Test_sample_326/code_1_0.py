    # Step 1: Define the constants from the problem.
    # The logarithmic derivative of Phi with respect to time is given as i * (17/324).
    # For a soliton solution Phi = A * exp(i*beta*t), this derivative is i*beta.
    # Therefore, beta = 17/324.

    # Step 2: Determine the velocity ratio v2/v1.
    # v1 is the absolute maximum speed of sound (from all plots, visually Plot 5).
    # v2 is the maximum speed of sound in the first row (plots 1, 2, 3, visually Plot 2).
    # Based on visual analysis, the plots in the same column are from the same material.
    # Plot 2 is likely a cross-section of the 3D velocity surface that includes the maximum
    # velocity shown in Plot 5. This leads to the conclusion that v2 = v1.
    v_ratio_squared = 1.0  # (v2/v1)^2

    # Step 3: Solve for the maximum amplitude, |Phi|_max.
    # The general equation for Y = |Phi|_max^8 is:
    # (1 - (v2/v1)^4) * Y^2 + (v2/v1)^2 * Y - beta = 0
    # With v2/v1 = 1, this simplifies to:
    # (1 - 1) * Y^2 + 1 * Y - beta = 0  =>  Y = beta
    Y = beta
    
    # |Phi|_max = Y^(1/8) = beta^(1/8)
    phi_max = Y**(1/8)

    # Step 4: Calculate the final requested value.
    result = 1 - phi_max
