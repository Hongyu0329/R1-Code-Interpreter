    # --- Analysis of Complex 1 ---
    print("--- Complex 1: [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+ ---")
    print("This is a standard, benchmark Ir(III) complex.")
    print("Its stability is moderate and serves as a baseline for comparison.")
    print("A known degradation pathway involves the reduction of the bpy ligand, which can lead to instability.\n")

    # --- Analysis of Complex 2 ---
    print("--- Complex 2: [Ir(ppy)2(pi-phen)]+ ---")
    print("This complex has a larger, more conjugated N^N ligand (phenanthroline-imidazole).")
    print("While this modification affects the electronic properties, its impact on stability is not as clearly beneficial as in Complex 3.")
    print("The large planar ligand system could potentially lead to aggregation, which can be detrimental.\n")

    # --- Analysis of Complex 3 ---
    print("--- Complex 3: [Ir(dfppy)2(dtbbpy)]+ ---")
    print("This complex incorporates two key modifications known to enhance stability:")
    print("1. Fluorinated 'ppy' ligands (dfppy): The fluorine atoms are strong electron-withdrawing groups.")
    print("   - Effect: They lower the HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) energy of the complex.")
    print("   - Result: This makes the complex more difficult to oxidize, thereby increasing its oxidative stability.\n")

    print("2. Bulky 'bpy' ligand (dtbbpy): The tert-butyl groups are bulky and electron-donating.")
    print("   - Electronic Effect: They raise the LUMO (Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital) energy.")
    print("   - Result 1: This makes the complex more difficult to reduce, preventing degradation of the bpy ligand.")
    print("   - Steric Effect: The bulky groups provide a 'steric shield', protecting the complex from chemical attack and preventing aggregation.")
    print("   - Result 2: This improves both chemical and morphological stability.\n")

    # --- Conclusion ---
    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Complex 3 is strategically designed to be more robust against both oxidative and reductive degradation.")
    print("The combination of fluorination (for oxidative stability) and bulky tert-butyl groups (for reductive and steric stability) is a well-established strategy for creating highly stable emitters.")
    print("Therefore, LECs based on Complex 3 are expected to be the most stable.\n")
