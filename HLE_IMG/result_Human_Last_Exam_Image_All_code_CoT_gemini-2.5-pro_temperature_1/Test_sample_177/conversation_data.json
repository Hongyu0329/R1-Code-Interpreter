    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios and then find the percentage reduction.\n\nThe VMT can be calculated as a weighted sum across the different trip distance categories. For each category, the VMT is determined by three factors:\n1.  The share of total trips that fall into that distance category.\n2.  The share of trips taken by car within that category.\n3.  The average mileage for that trip distance.\n\nThe VMT for cars includes both single-occupant cars and multi-occupant cars (carpools). Therefore, for each distance category, we must sum the mode shares of \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\" to get the total mode share for cars. The \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" values are not needed for this calculation, as VMT measures the miles traveled by the vehicle, not the people.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Calculate Baseline VMT**: For each distance category, multiply the 'share of total trips' by the 'total car mode share' (1-occupant + multi-occupant) and the 'average trip distance'. Sum these values to get the total Baseline VMT index.\n2.  **Calculate Proposed VMT**: Repeat the same calculation using the mode share data from the Proposed table.\n3.  **Calculate Percentage Reduction**: Use the formula: `((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef calculate_vmt_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage reduction in Car VMT based on the provided tables.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Common data for both scenarios\n    share_of_total_trips = [0.48, 0.22, 0.14, 0.16]\n    avg_trip_distance = [1, 4, 7.5, 20]\n    distance_bins = [\"0-3 miles\", \"3-5 miles\", \"5-10 miles\", \"10+ miles\"]\n\n    # Baseline data (Table 1)\n    baseline_car_1_occupant = [0.25, 0.38, 0.40, 0.42]\n    baseline_car_multi_occupant = [0.28, 0.43, 0.45, 0.47]\n\n    # Proposed data (Table 2)\n    proposed_car_1_occupant = [0.01, 0.08, 0.14, 0.16]\n    proposed_car_multi_occupant = [0.02, 0.19, 0.27, 0.33]\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate Baseline Car VMT ---\n    print(\"--- Calculating Baseline Car VMT ---\")\n    baseline_vmt_components = []\n    for i in range(len(distance_bins)):\n        total_car_share = baseline_car_1_occupant[i] + baseline_car_multi_occupant[i]\n        vmt_component = share_of_total_trips[i] * total_car_share * avg_trip_distance[i]\n        baseline_vmt_components.append(vmt_component)\n    \n    baseline_total_vmt = sum(baseline_vmt_components)\n    print(f\"Total Baseline Car VMT Index = {baseline_total_vmt:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate Proposed Car VMT ---\n    print(\"--- Calculating Proposed Car VMT ---\")\n    proposed_vmt_components = []\n    for i in range(len(distance_bins)):\n        total_car_share = proposed_car_1_occupant[i] + proposed_car_multi_occupant[i]\n        vmt_component = share_of_total_trips[i] * total_car_share * avg_trip_distance[i]\n        proposed_vmt_components.append(vmt_component)\n\n    proposed_total_vmt = sum(proposed_vmt_components)\n    print(f\"Total Proposed Car VMT Index = {proposed_total_vmt:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate Percentage Reduction ---\n    print(\"--- Calculating Percentage Reduction ---\")\n    vmt_reduction = baseline_total_vmt - proposed_total_vmt\n    percentage_reduction = (vmt_reduction / baseline_total_vmt) * 100\n\n    print(\"Final Equation:\")\n    print(f\"(({baseline_total_vmt:.4f} - {proposed_total_vmt:.4f}) / {baseline_total_vmt:.4f}) * 100 = {percentage_reduction:.1f}%\")\n    \n    return percentage_reduction\n\n# Run the calculation and store the final answer\nfinal_answer = calculate_vmt_reduction()\n```\n<<<52.2>>>"
