    "This is a well-known jazz standard. I will identify it by analyzing its melody and chord progression.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Key and Form:** The key signature has four flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db), and the first chord is F minor (F-), which indicates the piece is in the key of F minor. The structure with the first and second endings (`1.` and `2.`) suggests a repeating A section.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Melody and Chords:**\n    *   The first measure's melody consists of the notes F, C, and F. This is a very recognizable opening phrase.\n    *   The chord progression in the first few bars is F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7... This descending harmonic movement is highly characteristic.\n    *   The B section (starting at the D-7b5 chord) has the progression D-7b5 | G7 | C7 | F7 | Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab... This sequence of ii-V progressions is also very typical of this specific tune.\n\n3.  **Identify the Tune:** Based on the opening melody (F-C-F) and the unique chord progression, the piece is \"Stablemates\". The composer of this jazz standard is Benny Golson. The handwritten chart has some slight variations from the most common published versions (for example, the E-7b5 and Eb-6 chords in the second and third bars are a common reharmonization), but the core identity of the tune is unmistakable.\n\n```python\ndef identify_jazz_standard():\n  \"\"\"\n  Identifies the title and composer of the jazz standard from the sheet music.\n  \"\"\"\n  title = \"Stablemates\"\n  composer = \"Benny Golson\"\n  print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n  print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nidentify_jazz_standard()\n```\n<<<Title: Stablemates, Composer: Benny Golson>>>"
