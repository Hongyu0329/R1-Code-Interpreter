    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** First, I will identify the specific knot shown in the diagram. By counting the crossings (there are 6) and observing its structure, I can determine its name in the standard knot catalog (the Alexander-Briggs notation). The knot shown is the `6₂` knot.\n\n2.  **Determine Knot Properties:** I will examine the crossings in the diagram. A key property is the sign of each crossing. By observing the over/under strands, I can see that all crossings in this specific drawing are of the same type (all negative). This means the knot depicted is the *mirror image* of the standard `6₂` knot, which is usually drawn with all positive crossings.\n\n3.  **Relate to Known Invariants:** I will use a fundamental theorem for alternating knots which relates the Rasmussen invariant `s(K)` to another important invariant, the knot signature `σ(K)`. The theorem states that for any alternating knot `K`, the Rasmussen invariant is equal to the negative of its signature: `s(K) = -σ(K)`.\n\n4.  **Look Up and Calculate:** I will use the known, tabulated value for the signature of the standard `6₂` knot.\n    *   The signature of the standard `6₂` knot (with all positive crossings) is `σ(6₂) = 2`.\n    *   The signature of the mirror image is the negative of the original. So, for the knot in the picture (let's call it `K`), `σ(K) = -σ(6₂) = -2`.\n    *   Finally, I will apply the formula from step 3 to calculate the Rasmussen invariant for the knot in the picture: `s(K) = -σ(K)`.\n\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script to perform and display this calculation step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rasmussen_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Rasmussen invariant for the knot in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the knot and its properties.\n    knot_name = \"6₂\"\n    print(f\"The knot shown in the image is the {knot_name} knot.\")\n    \n    # The standard 6₂ knot is typically drawn with all positive crossings.\n    # The knot in the image has all negative crossings, so it's the mirror image.\n    print(f\"The diagram shows the mirror image of the standard {knot_name} knot.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: State the formula for alternating knots.\n    # The 6₂ knot is an alternating knot.\n    print(\"For an alternating knot K, the Rasmussen invariant s(K) is related to the knot signature σ(K) by the formula:\")\n    print(\"s(K) = -σ(K)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Use the known signature of the standard 6₂ knot.\n    sigma_standard_6_2 = 2\n    print(f\"The known signature of the standard {knot_name} knot is: σ({knot_name}) = {sigma_standard_6_2}\")\n\n    # The signature of the mirror image is the negative of the original.\n    sigma_knot_in_image = -sigma_standard_6_2\n    print(f\"The signature of the knot in the image (the mirror) is: σ(mirror {knot_name}) = -σ({knot_name}) = {sigma_knot_in_image}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the Rasmussen invariant for the knot in the image.\n    rasmussen_invariant = -sigma_knot_in_image\n    \n    print(\"Now we calculate the Rasmussen invariant for the knot in the image:\")\n    print(f\"s(K) = -σ(K)\")\n    print(f\"s(K) = -({sigma_knot_in_image})\")\n    print(f\"s(K) = {rasmussen_invariant}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    print(f\"The Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture is {rasmussen_invariant}.\")\n\ncalculate_rasmussen_invariant()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
