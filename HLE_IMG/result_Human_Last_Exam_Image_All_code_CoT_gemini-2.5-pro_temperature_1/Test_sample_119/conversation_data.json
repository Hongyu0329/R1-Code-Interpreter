    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure and IUPAC name of the compound from the provided spectra.\n\n### **Analysis Plan:**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrum (MS):** Determine the molecular weight (MW) and infer the molecular formula, using the Nitrogen Rule.\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectrum:** Identify key functional groups present in the molecule.\n3.  **¹³C and DEPT-135 NMR:** Determine the number and types of carbon atoms (C, CH, CH₂, CH₃).\n4.  **¹H NMR:** Identify the number and environment of different types of protons and their connectivity (coupling).\n5.  **HSQC:** Correlate the ¹H and ¹³C signals to know which proton is attached to which carbon.\n6.  **Structure Assembly:** Combine all the pieces of information to propose a structure.\n7.  **Confirmation:** Use the MS fragmentation pattern to confirm the proposed structure over other possible isomers.\n8.  **IUPAC Name:** Assign the correct IUPAC name to the final structure.\n\n### **Python Code for Analysis**\n\nHere is a Python script that walks through the analytical steps to solve the structure.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_compound_spectra():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- 1.
