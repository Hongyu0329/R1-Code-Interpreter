    "Based on my analysis of the sheet music provided, I can identify the song's details.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the Melody and Chords:** I will examine the key signature, time signature, melodic contour, and chord progression to identify characteristic features. The music is in 4/4 time, in the key of C major. The opening melodic phrase (pickup G-C, then E-G-C-E) and the initial chord progression (C -> E7 -> F) are very distinctive.\n2.  **Identify the Song:** This combination of melody and harmony is characteristic of the classic jazz standard \"After You've Gone,\" composed by Turner Layton with lyrics by Henry Creamer in 1918. The rest of the lead sheet is consistent with the structure of this song.\n3.  **Determine Style and Origin:** As a song from 1918 that quickly became a jazz favorite, its style is best described as early Jazz, Dixieland, or Tin Pan Alley. The composers were American, so the country of origin is the United States.\n4.  **Format the Output:** I will write a Python script to present these findings clearly.\n\n```python\ndef get_song_information():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the information about the song\n    identified from the provided sheet music.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"After You've Gone\"\n    musical_style = \"Jazz / Dixieland\"\n    country_of_origin = \"United States\"\n\n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Musical Style: {musical_style}\")\n    print(f\"Country of Origin: {country_of_origin}\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the song information.\nget_song_information()\n```\n<<<Title: After You've Gone, Musical Style: Jazz / Dixieland, Country of Origin: United States>>>"
