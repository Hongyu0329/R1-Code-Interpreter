def solve():
    """
    This function identifies the matching bird image.

    To solve this, I performed a visual comparison of the target bird with the options provided.
    1. I analyzed the distinct scalloped feather pattern on the back of the target bird.
    2. I paid close attention to the bold white edges of the wing feathers.
    3. I identified a unique, small dark spot/feather irregularity on the upper back of the target bird, slightly to the left of the spine.
    4. I systematically compared each option (A-I) to the target.
    5. Image G was the only option that matched all key features, including the general pattern, the bold feather edges, and the specific location of the small dark spot.
    
    Therefore, 'G' is the correct answer.
