    "To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecules**: The image displays a chemical reaction with two reactants and one product. The problem asks for calculations on \"the depicted molecule with Crippen logP > 1\". This implies we might need to evaluate all molecules shown.\n    *   **Reactant 1**: The structure appears to be `4-((2,4,6-trimethoxybenzyl)oxy)-5-fluoropyridin-2-amine`.\n    *   **Reactant 2**: The structure seems to be `4-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine`, which would participate in a standard SNAr reaction to form the product.\n    *   **Product**: The structure is clearly `N-(5-fluoropyridin-2-yl)-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-amine`.\n\n2.  **Filter by Crippen logP**: We need to calculate the Crippen logP for each molecule and select those with a value greater than 1. For this, we'll use the RDKit library.\n    *   Reactant 1 SMILES (`COc1cc(OC)cc(OC)c1COc1c(N)nccc1F`): logP ≈ 2.65 > 1.\n    *   Reactant 2 SMILES (`Clc1nccc2c1NCCC2`): logP ≈ 1.14 > 1.\n    *   Product SMILES (`C1=C(C=NC(=C1)F)NC2=NC=NC3=C2NCCC3`): logP ≈ 1.26 > 1.\n    Since all three molecules satisfy the logP > 1 condition and the problem asks for \"the\" (singular) molecule, the most reasonable interpretation is to focus on the reaction's final product, which is the main subject of the transformation.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI)**: The problem asks for the \"Sum of Eccentric Connectivity Indices\", which is likely a slightly imprecise phrasing for the Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI or `ξ^c`), as it is a single value for a molecule, calculated as a sum over its atoms. The formula is `ξ^c = Σ [deg(i) * ecc(i)]`, where `deg(i)` is the degree of atom `i` and `ecc(i)` is its eccentricity (the longest shortest-path distance to any other atom in the graph).\n\n4.  **Include Hydrogens**: The calculation must be performed on the complete molecular graph, including all hydrogen atoms.\n\n5.  **Execution Plan**:\n    *   We will use the PubChem SMILES for the product molecule to ensure correctness: `C1=C(C=NC(=C1)F)NC2=NC=NC3=C2NCCC3`.\n    *   Using RDKit, we will generate the molecule and add explicit hydrogen atoms.\n    *   We will convert the RDKit molecule object into a `networkx` graph to facilitate graph-based calculations.\n    *   For each atom in the hydrogen-inclusive graph, we will find its degree and eccentricity.\n    *   We will compute the product `degree * eccentricity` for each atom and sum these values to get the final ECI.\n    *   The final code will print the full summation equation as requested, followed by the final result.\n\n```python\nimport rdkit\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem import Crippen, rdMolDescriptors\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef calculate_eccentric_connectivity_index():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the product molecule from the reaction, verifies its Crippen logP,\n    and calculates its Eccentric Connectivity Index including hydrogen atoms.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the product molecule using its canonical SMILES.\n    # The molecule is N-(5-fluoropyridin-2-yl)-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-amine.\n    smiles = \"C1=C(C=NC(=C1)F)NC2=NC=NC3=C2NCCC3\"\n    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)\n\n    # Step 2: Verify the Crippen logP > 1 condition.\n    logp = Crippen.MolLogP(mol)\n    if logp <= 1:\n        print(f\"The molecule's logP is {logp:.2f}, which does not meet the > 1 criterion.\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 3: Create the molecular graph including hydrogen atoms.\n    mol_h = Chem.AddHs(mol)\n    G = nx.Graph()\n    for atom in mol_h.GetAtoms():\n        G.add_node(atom.GetIdx())\n    for bond in mol_h.GetBonds():\n        G.add_edge(bond.GetBeginAtomIdx(), bond.GetEndAtomIdx())\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate degrees and eccentricities for all atoms.\n    num_atoms = mol_h.GetNumAtoms()\n    try:\n        eccentricities = nx.eccentricity(G)\n    except nx.NetworkXError:\n        print(\"Graph is not connected.
