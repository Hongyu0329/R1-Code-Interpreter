For example, the second peak for methanol is ~1.2, while for ethanol it is ~1.0, a 20% difference."

            "reasoning": "This is supported by the OA-OW RDF (solid lines), where methanol's peaks are higher than ethanol's, signifying greater localization of water molecules."

This indicates a hydrogen bond where the alcohol's oxygen accepts a proton from water. This orientational signature is the same for both."

            "is_correct": False,
            "reasoning": "The solid green line for ethanol shows two clear hydration shells. After the second shell, the curve flattens and does not show a clear third band."

            "text": "Methanol creates 3 obvious hydration shells, as evidenced by the localization of water's oxygen atoms in 3 visible bands.",
