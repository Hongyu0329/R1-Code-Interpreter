    "Here is my plan to identify the rock specimens:\n\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:** I will observe its color, texture, and overall appearance. It is reddish-brown and has many visible holes (vesicles). This suggests it's a volcanic rock that cooled quickly, trapping gases. This is characteristic of Scoria.\n2.  **Analyze Specimen I:** I will examine the components of this rock. It appears to be composed of various angular fragments of other rocks cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This type of sedimentary or volcanic rock is known as a Breccia.\n3.  **Analyze Specimen J:** I will look at its color and texture. It is very light-colored (white to light gray) and extremely porous with many small vesicles. This appearance is typical of Pumice, a volcanic rock so lightweight it can often float on water.\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:** I will observe the crystal structure. This rock is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible. This coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture indicates it cooled slowly deep within the Earth. The light-colored minerals (likely feldspar and quartz) suggest it is a Pegmatite, which is a very coarse-grained igneous rock, often of granitic composition.\n5.  **Synthesize and Code:** I will compile these identifications into a Python script that stores the results in a dictionary and then prints each identification clearly.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria - A vesicular (holey) volcanic rock, typically dark in color (brown, black, or red).',\n        'I': 'Breccia - A rock composed of broken, angular fragments of minerals or rock cemented together by a fine-grained matrix.',\n        'J': 'Pumice - A very light and porous volcanic rock formed when a gas-rich froth of glassy lava solidifies rapidly.',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite - A coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock with very large, interlocking crystals, typically of a composition similar to granite.'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    print(\"----------------------------\")\n    for letter, description in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {letter}: {description}\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
