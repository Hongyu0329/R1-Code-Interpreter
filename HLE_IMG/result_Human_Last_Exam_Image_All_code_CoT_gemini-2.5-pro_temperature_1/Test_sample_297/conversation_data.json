    "To find the secret word, we first need to extract key numbers from the image and use them in an equation.\n\n1.  **Count the symbols:** Look at the top border of the image. There is a repeating white symbol. Counting these symbols reveals there are 22 of them.\n2.  **Count the stars:** In the upper part of the image, there are 2 yellow stars.\n3.  **Count the spots on the cake:** The Minecraft cake has several red spots on its top surface. There are 4 of these spots.\n\nNow, we can form an equation with these numbers: `22`, `2`, and `4`. The equation is `22 / 2 - 4`. The result of this calculation gives us the length of the secret word.\n\nThe main visual clue to the word itself is the character's clothing. She is wearing a pink and black checkerboard pattern, which is famously used in the game Minecraft as the placeholder texture when an object's intended texture is missing.\n\nThe calculation gives us the length, and the visual clue gives us the theme. The 7-letter word related to this \"missing texture\" theme is `TEXTURE`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the length of the secret word based on numbers\n    extracted from the image and explains the reasoning to find the word.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Numbers extracted from the image\n    num_symbols_top = 22  # From the top border\n    num_stars = 2         # Yellow stars\n    num_cake_spots = 4    # Red spots on the cake\n\n    # The equation to find the length of the secret word\n    word_length = num_symbols_top / num_stars - num_cake_spots\n\n    # Printing the equation step by step as requested\n    print(\"The equation is derived from the elements in the image:\")\n    print(f\"Number of symbols on top border: {num_symbols_top}\")\n    print(f\"Number of stars: {num_stars}\")\n    print(f\"Number of red spots on the cake: {num_cake_spots}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe equation to find the word's length is:\")\n    print(f\"{num_symbols_top} / {num_stars} - {num_cake_spots} = {int(word_length)}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe result is 7. The character's clothing is the 'missing texture' pattern from Minecraft.\")\n    print(\"The 7-letter secret word is TEXTURE.\")\n\nsolve_puzzle()\n```\n<<<TEXTURE>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Find the secret word that is encrypted in the image\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
