def solve_puzzle():
    """
    Solves the nonlinear wave equation plot identification puzzle.

    The solution is determined by analyzing the symmetries of the governing equation
    and matching them to visual features of the plots.

    1.  C(0,1,0) -> #9 (Symmetric, oscillating)
    2.  c(0,-1,0) -> #10 (Symmetric, decaying)
    3.  {D(0,0,1), d(0,0,-1)} <-> {#3, #5} (Color-inverse pair)
    4.  {B(1,0,0), b(-1,0,0)} <-> {#7, #2} (Color-inverse pair)
    5.  {b(-1,1,1), D(-1,-1,1)} <-> {#6, #8} (Identical plots, reddish)
    6.  {B(1,-1,-1), d(1,1,-1)} <-> {#1, #16} (Identical plots, bluish, inverse of #6/#8)
    7.  0(-1,-1,0) -> #14 (Decaying to zero)
    8.  {Z(1,0,1), Z(-1,0,-1)} <-> {#15, #12} (Color-inverse pair)
    9.  The remaining plots are assigned based on features (wavy, bound state, turbulent).
