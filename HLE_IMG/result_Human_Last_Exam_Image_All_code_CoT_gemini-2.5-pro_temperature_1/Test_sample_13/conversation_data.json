    "Of course, I can help with that. Kakuro puzzles are solved using logic to deduce the numbers in the white squares. Here is my plan to solve for the two numbers in the top-most squares:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify Key Clues:** I will focus on the clues that are directly related to the two top squares. Let's call the numbers in these two squares `X1` (left) and `X2` (right).\n    *   The clue to the left of these squares is `15`. This means they form a row that must sum to 15: `X1 + X2 = 15`.\n    *   The clue above the first square (`X1`) is `17`. This means `X1` and the cell directly below it (let's call it `Y1`) must sum to 17: `X1 + Y1 = 17`.\n    *   The clue above the second square (`X2`) is `29`. This means `X2` and the three cells below it form a column summing to 29.\n    *   The clue to the left of the row starting with `Y1` is `22`. This means `Y1` and the two cells to its right sum to 22.\n\n2.  **Logical Deduction:**\n    *   From the clue for the first column (`X1 + Y1 = 17`), and knowing that digits must be unique and between 1-9, the only possible pair for `X1` and `Y1` is `{8, 9}`.\n    *   This narrows down the possibilities for `X1` to either 8 or 9.\n    *   I will test both cases:\n        *   **Case A:** If `X1 = 8`, then `X2` must be `15 - 8 = 7`.\n        *   **Case B:** If `X1 = 9`, then `X2` must be `15 - 9 = 6`.\n    *   I will then use the other connected clues (the row sum of 22 and the column sum of 29) to see which case leads to a valid solution and which one leads to a contradiction (e.g., requiring a repeated digit in a run, or a digit greater than 9).\n\n3.  **Code Implementation:**\n    *   I will write a Python script to automate this deduction process.\n    *   The script will check both cases for `X1` and `X2`.\n    *   For each case, it will determine the possible values for the connected cells and verify if a valid combination exists that satisfies all uniqueness and sum constraints.\n    *   The script will print the only valid pair of numbers for the top squares and show the corresponding equation.\n\nHere is the Python code that performs the analysis:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_kakuro_top_squares():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves for the two top-most white squares in the Kakuro puzzle\n    by analyzing the interlocking clues.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Let x1, x2 be the two numbers in the top white squares (left, right).\n    # Let y1 be the cell below x1.\n    # Let y2 be the cell below x2.\n    # Let y3 be the cell to the right of y2.\n    # Let z2, w2 be the two cells below y2 in the same column.\n\n    # From the puzzle clues, we derive the following equations:\n    # 1.
