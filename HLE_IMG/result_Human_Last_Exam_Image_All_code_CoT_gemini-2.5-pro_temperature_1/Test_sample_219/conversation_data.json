    "My plan is to first visually identify the synchronized bursts in the provided raster plot. A synchronized burst is characterized by a high density of neuronal firings across many electrodes in a short time window, appearing as a vertical dark band on the graph. I will estimate the center timestamp for each of these bursts.\n\n1.  **Identify Burst Timestamps:** I will examine the x-axis (Time in seconds) to locate the approximate time of each major vertical band of activity.\n    *   Burst 1: ~2 s\n    *   Burst 2: ~12.5 s\n    *   Burst 3: ~21.5 s\n    *   Burst 4: ~35.5 s\n    *   Burst 5: ~48.5 s\n\n2.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** I will find the time difference between each consecutive burst.\n    *   IBI 1 = 12.5 s - 2 s = 10.5 s\n    *   IBI 2 = 21.5 s - 12.5 s = 9.0 s\n    *   IBI 3 = 35.5 s - 21.5 s = 14.0 s\n    *   IBI 4 = 48.5 s - 35.5 s = 13.0 s\n\n3.  **Calculate the Average IBI:** I will sum the calculated intervals and divide by the number of intervals to find the average.\n    *   Average IBI = (10.5 + 9.0 + 14.0 + 13.0) / 4 = 46.5 / 4 = 11.625 s\n\n4.  **Round to Significant Figures:** The final answer will be rounded to two significant figures as requested. 11.625 s rounds to 12 s.\n\nI will now implement this logic in a Python script to show the calculations clearly.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Identify the timestamps of the synchronized bursts from the graph.\n# These are the approximate center times of the dense vertical firing bands.\nburst_timestamps = [2, 12.5, 21.5, 35.5, 48.5]\nprint(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs).\n# The IBI is the time difference between consecutive bursts.\nintervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\nprint(\"Calculated Inter-Burst Intervals (s):\")\nfor i, interval in enumerate(intervals):\n    print(f\"Interval {i+1}: {burst_timestamps[i+1]} s - {burst_timestamps[i]} s = {interval} s\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the average of the IBIs.\naverage_interval = np.mean(intervals)\n\n# Step 4: Display the full calculation for the average.\ninterval_sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, intervals))\nprint(\"Average Inter-Burst Interval Calculation:\")\nprint(f\"({interval_sum_str}) / {len(intervals)} = {average_interval} s\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 5: Round the result to two significant figures and print.\n# Using format specifier 'g' for significant figures.\naverage_interval_rounded = float(f\"{average_interval:.2g}\")\nprint(f\"The average inter-burst interval is {average_interval} s.\")\nprint(f\"Rounded to two significant figures, the average inter-burst interval is {average_interval_rounded} s.\")\n```\n<<<12>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
