def solve_ca_puzzle():
    """
    This function solves the cellular automaton puzzle by logically deducing the sequences.
    The reasoning is as follows:

    1.  Time Step Distribution:
        - Rule 1: t=2, 3, 4, 5
        - Rule 2: t=3, 4, 5, 6
        - Rule 3: t=4, 5, 6, 7
        - Rule 4: t=5, 6, 7, 8
        This implies the following counts of images per time step:
        t=2 (1), t=3 (2), t=4 (3), t=5 (4), t=6 (3), t=7 (2), t=8 (1).

    2.  Image Sizing and Minimum Time (t_min):
        The size of the pattern at time t is at most (2t+1)x(2t+1).
        - G (3x3) -> t_min>=2
        - C (5x5) -> t_min>=2
        - D,J,K,L (7x7) -> t_min>=3
        - A,F,H,I (9x9) -> t_min>=4
        - E,M,N (11x11) -> t_min>=5
        - B,O (13x13) -> t_min>=6
        - P (15x15) -> t_min>=7

    3.  Sequence Deduction by Anchoring and Chaining:
        - The single t=2 image must be C. It is the start of Rule 1.
        - The single t=8 image must be P, the largest and most complex. It is the end of Rule 4.
        - Rule 4 (t=5,6,7,8): Working backward from P, the sequence MOBP is the most plausible. M(circle on cyan) -> O(cross on cyan) is a strong link. O->B->P shows increasing complexity. This sets M(t5), O(t6), B(t7), P(t8).
        - Rule 2 (t=3,4,5,6): The visual link F->E (rotation of bars) is strong. G->F is a plausible start, and E->N a plausible continuation. This gives GFEN. This sets G(t3), F(t4), E(t5), N(t6).
        - Rule 1 (t=2,3,4,5): Starts with C. From the remaining images, J->D->I is a strong morphological progression (corners -> T-shapes -> Y-shapes). This gives CJDI. This sets C(t2), J(t3), D(t4), I(t5).
        - Rule 3 (t=4,5,6,7): The last 4 images are K,H,A,L. The transition K->H (4 squares merging into a hollow square) is a very strong link. H->A->L is a plausible continuation. This gives KHAL. This sets K(t4), H(t5), A(t6), L(t7).

    4.  Final Grouping:
        - R1_Labels = "CJDI"
        - R2_Labels = "GFEN"
        - R3_Labels = "KHAL"
        - R4_Labels = "MOBP"

    This assignment uses every image exactly once and respects all time and size constraints.
