    "To find the total number of splice species, we need to analyze the results from each RT-PCR experiment and combine the findings without double-counting. A splice species corresponds to a unique mRNA variant.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Group experiments by forward primer:** The forward primers (E1F1, E1F2, E1F3) are designed to detect different classes of transcripts.\n    *   `E1F1` detects transcripts containing the E1 exon sequence where this primer binds.\n    *   `E1F2` specifically detects transcripts with the `929^3465` splice junction.\n    *   `E1F3` specifically detects transcripts with the `929^3506` splice junction.\n    Because a single mRNA molecule cannot contain both the unspliced E1F1 site and a splice junction that removes that site, these three classes of transcripts are mutually exclusive.\n2.  **Count species within each class:** For each class, we find the maximum number of distinct bands observed in any of the corresponding experiments. This gives the number of variants for that class.\n    *   **E1F1 Class (Panels B, C, E, H, I):** Panel I (`E1F1/L1R`, 30 cycles) is the most comprehensive experiment for this class, showing **4** distinct bands (species).\n    *   **E1F2 Class (Panels D, F):** Both experiments show **1** distinct band, indicating one species in this class.\n    *   **E1F3 Class (Panel G):** This experiment shows **2** distinct bands, indicating two species in this class.\n3.  **Sum the counts:** The total number of splice species is the sum of the species counted in each mutually exclusive class.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_splice_species():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total number of splice species based on the provided RT-PCR results.\n\n    The logic is to sum the number of unique species identified by each mutually exclusive\n    forward primer class (E1F1, E1F2, E1F3).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Number of species detected using the E1F1 forward primer.\n    # Panels B, C, E, H, and I use this primer.
