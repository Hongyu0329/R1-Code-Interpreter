  Determines the plausible geological events for the rock transition shown.

  The transition from Rock A (deep water) to Rock B (shallower water)
  indicates a marine regression (sea level fall). We evaluate each option:
  i. Onset of glaciation: Causes sea level to fall. Plausible.
  ii. Coastal subsidence: Causes relative sea level to rise. Not plausible.
  iii. Global warming: Causes sea level to rise. Not plausible.
  iv. Decreased Mid-Ocean Ridge Activity: Causes sea level to fall. Plausible.
