The Grignard reagent is a strong base. The first equivalent (1 of {equivalents}) reacts with the most acidic proton in the molecule, the one on the tertiary alcohol (-OH). This is a fast acid-base reaction that forms a magnesium alkoxide (R-O-MgBr) and methane gas."""

With excess Grignard reagent and at high temperature ({temperature_celsius}°C), the magnesium atom of the complex coordinates to both the newly formed alkoxide oxygen at C3 and the adjacent ether oxygen of the benzodioxole ring at C4. This forms a stable 5-membered chelate ring, which holds a reactive Grignard molecule in a specific position relative to the benzodioxole."""

The chelation positions the methyl group (CH3) of the coordinated Grignard reagent perfectly to attack the electrophilic methylene carbon (-CH2-) of the benzodioxole moiety. This nucleophilic attack from the methyl group (which has 1 carbon) onto the methylene carbon (1 carbon) forms a new ethyl group (-CH2CH3, which has 2 carbons). This attack causes the cleavage of the C-O bond at position C5, opening the ring to form a magnesium phenoxide."""
