    "My plan is to analyze the provided sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Algorithm:** I will first break down the recursive function `sort(a, n)`. It has a base case for `n <= 1`. In the recursive step, it calls itself on the first `n-1` elements, then performs a comparison and a potential swap, and, in the worst case, calls itself again on the first `n-1` elements.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Recurrence Relation:** I will model the algorithm's running time with a recurrence relation, `T(n)`. The worst-case scenario is when the `if` condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is always true, which triggers both recursive calls. This leads to the relation `T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-1) + c`, or `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`, where `c` represents the constant time for the comparison and swap operations.\n\n3.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:** I will solve this linear recurrence relation by expansion to find a closed-form expression for `T(n)`. This will reveal the relationship between the input size `n` and the number of operations.\n\n4.  **Determine the Big-O Complexity:** Based on the solved recurrence relation, I will identify the dominant term to determine the asymptotic upper bound (Big-O) for the worst-case time complexity.\n\n5.  **Final Output:** I will write a Python script that prints a step-by-step explanation of this analysis and then select the correct answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the time complexity of the given sorting algorithm and prints the explanation.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the algorithm's time complexity:\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n1.
