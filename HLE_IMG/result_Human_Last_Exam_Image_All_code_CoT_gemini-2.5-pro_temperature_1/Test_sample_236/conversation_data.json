    "The user wants to identify the scientific name of the insect in the image.\n\n1.  **Analyze the image:** The image displays a black and orange/red insect on a yellow flower, which appears to be goldenrod. The insect has the characteristic features of a true bug (Order Hemiptera), such as long antennae and a distinct body shape.\n2.  **Identify the insect:** The coloration, markings (orange/red lines on the thorax and wing edges), and overall shape are characteristic of the Boxelder Bug.\n3.  **Find the scientific name:** The scientific name for the Boxelder Bug is *Boisea trivittata*.\n4.  **Create the Python script:** I will write a simple Python script to print this scientific name as requested.\n\n```python\ndef get_scientific_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns the scientific name of the insect identified in the image.\n    The insect is commonly known as the Boxelder Bug.\n    \"\"\"\n    scientific_name = \"Boisea trivittata\"\n    print(scientific_name)\n\nget_scientific_name()\n```\n<<<Boisea trivittata>>>"
