    "This is a chemical identification task. I will first identify the molecule from the provided image. The molecule is a known natural product. Then, I will write a simple Python script to print its name to fulfill the request for a code-based solution.\n\nThe image shows the chemical structure of a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid. By comparing this structure with known compounds, it can be identified as Matrine. Matrine is an alkaloid found in plants from the *Sophora* genus. I will now provide the Python code to output this name.\n\n```python\ndef identify_alkaloid():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the alkaloid compound from the image and prints its name.\n    The compound is a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The common name for the depicted chemical structure.\n    compound_name = \"Matrine\"\n    print(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n\nidentify_alkaloid()\n```\n<<<Matrine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
