    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the ECG strip, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand ECG Parameters**: The ECG is recorded at a standard paper speed of 25 mm/sec. The grid on the ECG paper is used to measure time intervals. Each small square is 1 mm wide, and each large square is 5 mm wide.\n2.  **Calculate Time per Square**:\n    *   Time for 1 mm (1 small square) = 1 sec / 25 mm = 0.04 seconds.\n    *   Time for 5 mm (1 large square) = 5 * 0.04 seconds = 0.2 seconds.\n3.  **Identify the Longest R-R Interval**: By visually inspecting the entire rhythm strip, we look for the widest gap between two consecutive R-waves (the prominent upward spikes). The most significant pause is located in the second strip from the top.\n4.  **Measure the Interval**: We measure the distance between the R-wave preceding the pause and the R-wave ending the pause. This distance spans exactly 7 large squares.\n5.  **Calculate the Duration**: We multiply the number of large squares by the time per large square to get the total duration in seconds.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_longest_rr_interval():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the longest R-R interval from an ECG strip.\n\n    This function uses standard ECG paper measurements to calculate the duration\n    of the longest R-R interval identified visually on the provided strip.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Standard ECG paper speed in mm/sec\n    paper_speed_mm_per_sec = 25\n\n    # Dimensions of ECG grid squares\n    # 1 large square = 5 small squares (5 mm)\n    # 1 small square = 1 mm\n\n    # Time calculation\n    # Time for 1 large square (5 mm) = 5 mm / 25 mm/sec\n    time_per_large_square_sec = 5 / paper_speed_mm_per_sec\n\n    # From visual inspection of the ECG, the longest R-R interval spans 7 large squares.\n    num_large_squares = 7\n\n    # Calculate the longest R-R interval in seconds\n    longest_rr_interval_sec = num_large_squares * time_per_large_square_sec\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final result\n    print(\"To find the longest R-R interval:\")\n    print(f\"1. The paper speed is {paper_speed_mm_per_sec} mm/sec.\")\n    print(f\"2. The time for one large square (5 mm) is 5 mm / {paper_speed_mm_per_sec} mm/sec = {time_per_large_square_sec} seconds.\")\n    print(f\"3. By inspecting the ECG, the longest interval between two R-waves spans {num_large_squares} large squares.\")\n    print(f\"4. The duration of the longest R-R interval is calculated as: {num_large_squares} large squares * {time_per_large_square_sec} seconds/large square = {longest_rr_interval_sec} seconds.\")\n\ncalculate_longest_rr_interval()\n```\n<<<1.4>>>"
