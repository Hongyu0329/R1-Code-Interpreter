    This function identifies the correct image.
    Based on the visual analysis, the key features for re-identification are:
    1. Horn shape and size.
    2. The pattern of vertical white stripes on the body.
    3. The unique pattern of white spots on the flank and hip.

    - The target nyala has a specific horn curvature and a very distinct cluster of white spots on its lower flank.
    - Image A has a different spot pattern.
    - Image B has an identical spot pattern and horn shape to the target.
    - Image C has different horns and coat color.
    - Image D has a different, more scattered spot pattern.
    - Image E is similar, but the spot pattern is not as precise a match as B.
    - Image F has a different spot pattern.

    Therefore, image B is the correct match.
