# Step 1: Define the parameters m and n based on visual analysis.
# The number of hexagons on the shortest path between two pentagons is m + n - 1.
# By counting on the image, we find 5 hexagons between two adjacent spiral centers.
# So, m + n - 1 = 5  =>  m + n = 6.
# Given that the polyhedron is chiral (has spirals), we know n > 0.
# The hint provided is m > n.
# The possible integer pairs (m, n) are (5, 1) and (4, 2).
# A straight path of 4 hexagons can be traced from a pentagon's center,
# which represents the longer leg 'm' of the path.
# Therefore, we conclude m=4 and n=2.
m = 4
n = 2

# Step 2: Define the number of pentagonal faces, P.
# For any Goldberg polyhedron, P is always 12.
P = 12

# Step 3: Calculate the number of hexagonal faces, H.
# The formula is H = 10 * (m^2 + m*n + n^2 - 1).
m_squared = m**2
mn_product = m * n
n_squared = n**2
T_minus_1 = m_squared + mn_product + n_squared - 1
H = 10 * T_minus_1

# Step 4: Output the results and the calculation as requested.
