    This function solves the SWNT plot identification problem based on physical principles.
    
    The logic is as follows:
    1.  Determine metallic (n-m mod 3 = 0) vs. semiconducting (n-m mod 3 != 0) character
        for n=4, m in {0,1,2,3,4}.
        - Metallic: m=1 (chiral), m=4 (armchair)
        - Semiconducting: m=0 (zigzag), m=2, m=3
    2.  Identify plots corresponding to metallic nanotubes.
        - Band Structure (crossing bands): #1 (crossing at k=0 -> armchair -> m=4), #7 (crossing at k!=0 -> chiral -> m=1).
        - Oscillator Strength (lines through K-points): #2 (vertical lines -> armchair -> m=4), #8 (tilted lines -> chiral -> m=1).
    3.  Identify plots corresponding to semiconducting nanotubes.
        - Band Structure (band gap): #3, #5, #9. Gap size is inverse to diameter.
          Diameter d ~ sqrt(n^2+m^2+nm).
          d(4,3) > d(4,2) > d(4,0) => Eg(4,0) > Eg(4,2) > Eg(4,3).
          Plot #9 (largest gap) -> m=0.
          Plot #5 (smallest gap) -> m=3.
          Plot #3 (medium gap) -> m=2.
        - Oscillator Strength (lines miss K-points): #4, #6.
          Line tilt increases with chiral angle (and m). Plot #6 is more tilted than #4.
          Plot #6 -> m=3.
          Plot #4 -> m=2.
          The plot for m=0 (zigzag, zero tilt) is missing.
    4.  Assemble the sequence of m-values for plots 1 through 9.
    """
    
    # Final m-values assigned to each plot number (1-9)
    # Plot 1: Armchair (4,4) band structure -> m=4
    # Plot 2: Armchair (4,4) oscillator strength -> m=4
    # Plot 3: Semiconducting (4,2) band structure (medium gap) -> m=2
    # Plot 4: Semiconducting (4,2) oscillator strength (lesser tilt) -> m=2

    print("The m value for each plot from #1 to #9 is:")
    # Using a formatted string to make the output look like a sequence in curly braces
    result_string = "{" + ", ".join(map(str, m_values)) + "}"
    print(result_string)
