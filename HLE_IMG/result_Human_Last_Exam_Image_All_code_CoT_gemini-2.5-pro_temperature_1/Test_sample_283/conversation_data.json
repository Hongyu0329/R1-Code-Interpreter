    "This Google Trends graph displays search interest for three annual events related to Black history in the United States.\n\n1.  **Red Line:** This line consistently peaks in mid-to-late January each year. This corresponds to **Martin Luther King Jr. Day**, a U.S. federal holiday observed on the third Monday of January.\n\n2.  **Blue Line:** This line shows smaller, recurring peaks every February. February is **Black History Month** in the United States, an annual observance.\n\n3.  **Yellow Line:** This line peaks annually around mid-to-late June. The interest level for this event has noticeably increased over the years, with a major spike in 2023. This pattern corresponds to **Juneteenth** (June 19th), which commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. It was officially recognized as a federal holiday in 2021, explaining its growing search interest.\n\nSince all three historical events (Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Black History Month, and Juneteenth) are specific to the history and culture of the United States, the country in question is the United States.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the country based on the analysis of the Google Trends graph.\n    The graph shows recurring search interest peaks corresponding to:\n    - Martin Luther King Jr. Day (January, red line)\n    - Black History Month (February, blue line)\n    - Juneteenth (June, yellow line)\n    All three events are primarily observed in the United States.\n    \"\"\"\n    country = \"United States\"\n    print(f\"The country is the {country}.\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<United States>>>\n```"
