    "To determine the Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, first movement, we need to perform a harmonic analysis.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  **Identify the key:** The sonata is in C minor, but this section (starting around measure 27) has modulated to the relative major, E-flat major. The key signature of three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭) confirms this.\n2.  **Identify the notes:** In measure 30, the notes played are F#, A, C, and E♭.\n3.  **Identify the chord:** These notes, when stacked in thirds (F# - A - C - E♭), form an F-sharp fully diminished seventh chord (F#°7).\n4.  **Analyze the harmonic function:** This chord is chromatic to the key of E-flat major. We look at the chord it resolves to in measure 31, which is a G minor chord (G - B♭ - D).\n5.  **Determine the relationship:** The F#°7 chord acts as the leading-tone chord to G minor (since F# is the leading tone of G).\n6.  **Formulate the Roman numeral:** In the key of E-flat major, the G minor chord is the mediant, or the `iii` chord. Therefore, the F#°7 chord is a secondary leading-tone chord that temporarily tonicizes the mediant. This is written as `vii°7/iii`.\n\nThe following Python code outlines this analysis and prints the final Roman numeral.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_beethoven_measure_30():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the harmony of measure 30 from Beethoven's\n    Pathetique Sonata, 1st movement, and provides the correct Roman numeral.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
