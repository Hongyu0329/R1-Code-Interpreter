# The characters are identified as 樂天圖書 in traditional Chinese.
# Here is the simplified Chinese version.

character_1 = "乐"  # Simplified from 樂 (lè)
character_2 = "天"  # Same in traditional and simplified (tiān)
character_3 = "图"  # Simplified from 圖 (tú)
character_4 = "书"  # Simplified from 書 (shū)

# The phrase reads from top-right, top-left, bottom-right, bottom-left.
# So the order is 乐, 天, 图, 书.
print(f"The characters on the seal in simplified Chinese are: {character_1}{character_2}{character_3}{character_4}")
