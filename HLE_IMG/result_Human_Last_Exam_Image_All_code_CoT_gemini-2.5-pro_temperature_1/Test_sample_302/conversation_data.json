    "The seal is written in an ancient script called Seal Script (篆書). It should be read from top to bottom, and right to left.\n\n1.  **Top Right Character**: 樂 (lè), which means joy or music.\n2.  **Top Left Character**: 天 (tiān), which means sky or heaven.\n3.  **Bottom Right Character**: 圖 (tú), which means picture or diagram.\n4.  **Bottom Left Character**: 書 (shū), which means book or writing.\n\nPutting them together, the phrase is 樂天圖書 (lè tiān tú shū). In simplified Chinese, this is 乐天图书. This can be translated as \"Letian's Books\" or \"Optimistic Pictures and Books\". \"Letian\" (樂天) is famously the style name of the Tang dynasty poet Bai Juyi (白居易).\n\n```python\n# The characters are identified as 樂天圖書 in traditional Chinese.\n# Here is the simplified Chinese version.\n\ncharacter_1 = \"乐\"  # Simplified from 樂 (lè)\ncharacter_2 = \"天\"  # Same in traditional and simplified (tiān)\ncharacter_3 = \"图\"  # Simplified from 圖 (tú)\ncharacter_4 = \"书\"  # Simplified from 書 (shū)\n\n# The phrase reads from top-right, top-left, bottom-right, bottom-left.\n# So the order is 乐, 天, 图, 书.\nprint(f\"The characters on the seal in simplified Chinese are: {character_1}{character_2}{character_3}{character_4}\")\n```\n<<<乐天图书>>>"
