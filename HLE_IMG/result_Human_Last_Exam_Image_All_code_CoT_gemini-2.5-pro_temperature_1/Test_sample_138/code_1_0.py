# Step 1: Determine the index for Pair A.
# The left insect is male (longer antennae) and the right is female (pointed abdomen).
# The pattern is M, F, which corresponds to index 3.
index_A = 3

# Step 2: Determine the index for Pair B.
# The left insect is male (curled antennae) and the right is female (straight antennae).
# The pattern is M, F, which corresponds to index 3.
index_B = 3

# Step 3: Determine the index for Pair C.
# The left insect is male (very long antennae) and the right is female (short antennae).
# The pattern is M, F, which corresponds to index 3.
index_C = 3

# Step 4: Print the indices for A, B, and C, separated by commas.
print(f"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}")
