    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will follow the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules for each of the three stereocenters.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify and Number the Stereocenters**: First, we will identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the -OH group, making it an alcohol) to number the stereocenters according to IUPAC nomenclature.\n2.  **Assign Priorities**: For each stereocenter, we will assign priorities (1-4) to the four attached groups based on atomic number.\n3.  **Determine R/S Configuration**: We will orient the molecule so the lowest-priority group (4) is pointing away from the viewer and determine the direction of the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3. Clockwise (CW) is 'R', and Counter-Clockwise (CCW) is 'S'. If the lowest-priority group points towards the viewer, the result is reversed.\n\nThe script below will walk through this process for each center.\n\n```python\ndef determine_absolute_configuration():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the absolute configuration (R/S) for each stereocenter\n    in the given molecule based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify and Number the Stereocenters\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The principal functional group is the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\")\n    print(\"The longest carbon chain containing the C-OH carbon is a pentane chain.\")\n    print(\"Numbering from the left end gives the -OH group the lowest number (2).\")\n    print(\"The molecule is a derivative of pentan-2-ol.\")\n    print(\"The three stereocenters are at carbons C2, C3, and C4.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # --- Analysis of C2 ---\n    print(\"Step 2: Analysis of Stereocenter C2 (Carbon with -OH)\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Groups attached to C2: -OH, -CH3, -H, and the rest of the chain (-C3H(Et)...).\")\n    print(\"Assigning priorities (1=highest, 4=lowest):\")\n    print(\"1. -OH (Oxygen, Z=8)\")\n    print(\"2. -C3H(Et)...
