def solve_epidemiological_puzzle():
    """
    Solves the Wind-Scattered Epidemiological Puzzle by logical deduction.

    The solution is derived by:
    1. Analyzing the qualitative effects of each parameter on the model dynamics.
    2. Using the distinct visual signatures of the quarantine parameters (varied in plots 3, 4, 6)
       to determine the mapping between colors and parameter multipliers (green=2x, orange=1x, blue=0.5x).
    3. Matching the unique visual characteristics of each plot (e.g., scaling property for costs,
       small effect size for baseline mortality, late divergence for hospital-related parameters)
       to the corresponding parameter.

    The final mapping is as follows:
    - Plot 1: fs (6) - Early/smooth divergence in S(t) due to sequestration effect.
    - Plot 2: μs (2) - Late/sharp divergence in S(t) as hospitals are strained.
    - Plot 3: ql (14) - S(t) plateau length varies.
    - Plot 4: qf (15) - S(t) plateau depth varies.
    - Plot 5: ch (12) - Pure scaling of an increasing function (Ch).
    - Plot 6: qs (13) - S(t) plateau start time varies.
    - Plot 7: ai (5) - Time-shifted increasing curves (R, D, or Cl).
    - Plot 8: μ (1) - Very small effect on S(t).
    - Plot 9: βh (9) - Larger epidemic leads to higher cumulative values (R, D, or Cl).
