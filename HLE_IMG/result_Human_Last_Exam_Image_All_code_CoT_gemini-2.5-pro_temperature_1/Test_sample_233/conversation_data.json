    "Based on the analysis of the runic inscription fragment, I can identify the specific runestone.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Runic Inscription:** The image displays runes from the Younger Futhark alphabet, arranged in horizontal bands. I will transliterate key portions of the text.\n    *   Top row: Includes the runes `ᚦ ᚢ ᚱ ᚴ ᚢ ᚦ ᚱ` which transliterate to `þurkuþr`, a name likely corresponding to Old Norse `Þorgautr`.\n    *   Middle row: Shows `ᛋ ᛏ ᛅ ᛁ ᚾ` which is `stain` (stone).\n    *   Bottom row: Shows `ᛅ ᚠ ᛏ ᛁ ᚱ` which is `aftir` (in memory of).\n2.  **Identify the Runestone:** The combination of the name `Þorgautr` and the context of an \"Ingvar runestone\" (a specific group of runestones commemorating those who died on Ingvar the Far-Travelled's expedition) points to a well-known monument. This inscription matches the Gripsholm Runestone.\n3.  **Find the Official ID:** In the standard catalog of Swedish runic inscriptions (Rundata), the Gripsholm Runestone is designated with a unique ID based on its location. The code for the province of Södermanland is \"Sö\".\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that defines the components of the runestone's ID (the province code and the number) and then combines and prints the full official ID.\n\n```python\n# The runestone in the image is identified as the Gripsholm Runestone,\n# one of the Ingvar runestones, based on the visible inscription.\n# This script provides its official catalog ID.\n\n# The runestone ID consists of a code for the province and a number.\n# The province where the stone is located is Södermanland, Sweden.\nprovince_code = \"Sö\"\n\n# The specific number assigned to this runestone in the catalog.\nstone_number = 179\n\n# The final ID is the combination of the two parts.\n# The following line prints the components and the final ID.\nprint(f\"The runestone ID is {province_code} {stone_number}.\")\n```\n<<<Sö 179>>>"
