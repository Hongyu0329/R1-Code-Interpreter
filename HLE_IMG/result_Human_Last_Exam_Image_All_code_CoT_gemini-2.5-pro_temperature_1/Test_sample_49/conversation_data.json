    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step derivation of the cutoff frequency, followed by a Python script to perform the symbolic calculation.\n\n### Plan and Derivation\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to find the cutoff frequency at node `a₀`. This is a low-pass filter formed by the capacitor `C` and the equivalent resistance of the rest of the circuit as seen from node `a₀`.\n\n2.  **Cutoff Frequency Formula:** For a first-order RC filter, the angular cutoff frequency `ω_c` is given by:\n    `ω_c = 1 / (R_th * C)`\n    where `R_th` is the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor `C`.\n\n3.  **Finding the Thevenin Resistance (R_th):**\n    *   To find `R_th`, we look into the terminals `a₀` and ground (`b₀`).\n    *   We must turn off all independent sources. The input `IN` is a voltage source, so we short it to ground. This means node `c₀` is connected to ground.\n    *   The circuit for `R_th` is an infinite ladder of resistors.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Infinite Ladder:**\n    *   The key to solving infinite ladder problems is to note that adding one more section to an infinite ladder does not change its total resistance.\n    *   Let's define `R_in` as the equivalent resistance of the infinite part of the ladder looking upwards from any pair of nodes `c_k` and `d_k` (for `k ≥ 1`).\n    *   Looking into nodes `c_k` and `d_k`, we see the shunt resistor `r` (between `c_k` and `d_k`) in parallel with the path through the next section.\n    *   The path through the next section consists of the series resistor `r` (from `c_k` to `c_{k+1}`), the equivalent resistance `R_in` (between `c_{k+1}` and `d_{k+1}`), and the other series resistor `r` (from `d_{k+1}` to `d_k`). The total resistance of this path is `2r + R_in`.\n    *   This gives us a self-referential equation for `R_in`:\n        `R_in = r || (2r + R_in)`\n    *   Solving this equation `R_in² + 2r*R_in - 2r² = 0` for the positive root yields:\n        `R_in = r * (sqrt(3) - 1)`\n\n5.  **Calculating R_th at node a₀:**\n    *   Now we can calculate the total resistance from `a₀` to ground. The path is `a₀ → d₁ → c₁ → c₀ (ground)`.\n    *   The total resistance `R_th` is the sum of resistances along this path:\n        1.  Resistance from `a₀` to `d₁`: `r`\n        2.  Resistance from `d₁` to `c₁`: This is the parallel combination of the shunt resistor `r` and the equivalent resistance of the upper ladder `R_in`. So, `r || R_in`.\n        3.  Resistance from `c₁` to `c₀` (ground): `r`\n    *   Therefore, the total Thevenin resistance is:\n        `R_th = r + (r || R_in) + r = 2r + (r || R_in)`\n    *   Substituting the value of `R_in`, we can find `R_th`.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Once `R_th` is found, we substitute it into the cutoff frequency formula `ω_c = 1 / (R_th * C)`.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform these symbolic calculations and provides the final expression for the cutoff frequency.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_cutoff_frequency():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the cutoff frequency at node a0 for the given infinite RC ladder network.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbolic variables for resistance, capacitance, and the ladder's equivalent resistance.\n    # We assume r, C, and R_in are positive real values.\n    r, C, R_in = sympy.symbols('r C R_in', positive=True)\n\n    # 1. Set up the equation for the equivalent resistance of the infinite ladder (R_in).\n    # The equation is R_in = r || (2r + R_in), which leads to a quadratic equation:\n    # R_in^2 + 2*r*R_in - 2*r^2 = 0\n    equation = sympy.Eq(R_in**2 + 2*r*R_in - 2*r**2, 0)\n\n    # 2. Solve the quadratic equation for R_in.\n    # The solutions will be a positive and a negative root. Resistance must be positive.\n    R_in_solutions = sympy.solve(equation, R_in)\n    R_in_val = [sol for sol in R_in_solutions if sol.is_positive][0]\n\n    # 3. Calculate the Thevenin equivalent resistance (R_th) seen by the capacitor.\n    # R_th = r + (r || R_in) + r\n    R_parallel = (r * R_in_val) / (r + R_in_val)\n    R_th = 2 * r + R_parallel\n\n    # 4. Simplify the expression for R_th.\n    R_th_simplified = sympy.simplify(R_th)\n\n    # 5. Calculate the angular cutoff frequency (w_c).\n    # w_c = 1 / (R_th * C)\n    w_c = 1 / (R_th_simplified * C)\n\n    # 6. Simplify the final expression for w_c.\n    w_c_simplified = sympy.simplify(w_c)\n    \n    # 7. Print the final result in a structured way.\n    num, den = w_c_simplified.as_numer_denom()\n    \n    # We manually format the denominator for clarity, extracting the coefficients.\n    # The denominator has the form C*r*(k1*sqrt(k2) + k3)\n    # This ensures all numbers are explicitly printed as requested.\n    den_factor = den / (C*r)\n    k1 = den_factor.coeff(sympy.sqrt(3))\n    k3 = den_factor.subs(sympy.sqrt(3), 0)\n    \n    print(\"The cutoff angular frequency w_c is:\")\n    print(f\"w_c = {num} / (C * r * ({k1}*sqrt(3) + ({k3})))\")\n\n\nsolve_cutoff_frequency()\n```\n<<<w_c = sqrt(3) / (C * r * (3*sqrt(3) - 1))>>>"
