# The analysis is based on the reasoning outlined above.
# The final answer is derived from matching each condition to a unique simulation plot.

# Condition 1: minimum t -> Simulation 2
# Condition 2: minimum |s| -> Simulation 3
# Condition 3: unique sign(s) -> Simulation 4
# Condition 4: maximum |s| (interpreted from 'maximum s') -> Simulation 1

# The problem asks for the simulation indices ordered by the condition met.
# This means the answer is a sequence of the simulation numbers corresponding to
# Condition 1, Condition 2, Condition 3, and Condition 4.

sim_for_cond_1 = 2
sim_for_cond_2 = 3
sim_for_cond_3 = 4
sim_for_cond_4 = 1

# The final answer is the concatenation of these numbers.
final_answer = f"{sim_for_cond_1}{sim_for_cond_2}{sim_for_cond_3}{sim_for_cond_4}"
