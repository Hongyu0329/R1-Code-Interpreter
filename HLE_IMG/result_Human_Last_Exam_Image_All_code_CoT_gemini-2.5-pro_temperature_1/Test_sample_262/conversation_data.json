    "Here is a step-by-step thinking process to determine which complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Structure and Variable Components:** All four compounds are cationic Iridium(III) complexes of the general form `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+`, where `C^N` is a cyclometalating phenylpyridine ligand and `N^N` is a 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine ligand. The counter-ion is PF6-. The only difference between the four complexes is the substitution pattern on the phenyl rings of the two `C^N` ligands.\n\n2.  **Relate Structure to Stability and Lifetime:** In light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), the operational lifetime of the device is often limited by the chemical stability of the emitter complex. A primary degradation pathway for these iridium complexes involves the breaking of the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond, especially when the complex is in a reduced state during operation.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Effect of Fluorination:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom. Attaching fluorine atoms to the phenyl ring of the `C^N` ligand has a strong electron-withdrawing effect. This effect strengthens the Ir-C sigma bond, making the ligand less likely to dissociate from the iridium center. A stronger Ir-C bond leads to a more stable complex and, consequently, a longer device lifetime.\n\n4.  **Compare the Four Complexes:**\n    *   **Complex 4:** Has no fluorine atoms on its phenylpyridine ligands (`ppy`). It lacks the stabilizing effect of fluorination, making its Ir-C bond the weakest among the four. Therefore, Complex 4 is expected to be the least stable and have the shortest lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 1:** Has two fluorine atoms (at the 2' and 4' positions) on each phenylpyridine ligand. This provides the strongest electron-withdrawing effect and thus the strongest Ir-C bond. Complex 1 is expected to be the most stable and have the longest lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 2 vs. Complex 3:** Both have a single fluorine atom on each phenylpyridine ligand, so both are expected to be more stable than Complex 4 but less stable than Complex 1. To differentiate them, we must consider the position of the fluorine atom.\n        *   **Complex 2 (4'-F, para-position):** The fluorine provides a stabilizing electron-withdrawing effect without being physically close to the iridium center. This is often called a \"clean\" electronic effect.\n        *   **Complex 3 (2'-F, ortho-position):** The fluorine is very close to the Ir-C bond and the metal center. While it provides a strong stabilizing electronic effect due to its proximity, it can also introduce steric strain or electrostatic repulsion. This additional strain can create a competing destabilizing factor, potentially making the complex more prone to degradation than its para-substituted counterpart (Complex 2).\n\n5.  **Establish Stability Ranking and Conclude:** Based on the analysis, the stability is expected to follow this order:\n    **Complex 1 > Complex 2 > Complex 3 > Complex 4**\n    The question asks for the complexes with **shorter** lifetimes, which correspond to the **least stable** complexes. According to our ranking, these are Complex 3 and Complex 4.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_complex_stability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the stability of four iridium complexes to predict their relative lifetimes in LECs.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the properties of each complex based on their structure\n    complexes = {\n        1: {\"name\": \"Complex 1\", \"substituent\": \"2',4'-difluoro\", \"fluorine_count\": 2},\n        2: {\"name\": \"Complex 2\", \"substituent\": \"4'-fluoro (para)\", \"fluorine_count\": 1},\n        3: {\"name\": \"Complex 3\", \"substituent\": \"2'-fluoro (ortho)\", \"fluorine_count\": 1},\n        4: {\"name\": \"Complex 4\", \"substituent\": \"none\", \"fluorine_count\": 0}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analysis of Complex Stability for LEC Lifetime Prediction:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"Principle: The stability of these iridium complexes, and thus their device lifetime, is enhanced by fluorination of the phenylpyridine ligands.
