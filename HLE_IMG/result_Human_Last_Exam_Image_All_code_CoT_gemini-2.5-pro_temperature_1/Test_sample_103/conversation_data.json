    "This is a tactical chess puzzle. My goal is to find the best move for White by evaluating the most forcing candidate moves, such as checks, captures, and major threats.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Position:** White has a very strong attacking knight on f7, supported by the queen on d5. Black's queen on h4 and bishop on e4 are mounting a serious attack on White's g2 pawn, threatening the king. The situation is critical, and White must act decisively.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Candidate Moves:**\n    *   **Checks are the most forcing moves**, so let's analyze them first. White has several knight checks: Ng5+, Ne5+, Nd6+, and Nh6+.\n    *   **Ng5+ (Option E):** This move delivers a check to the black king on g8. Black's only legal response is to capture the knight with the pawn: `1...hxg5`. After this, White can play `2. Qh5#`. The queen on h5 delivers checkmate, as the black king has no escape squares. This is a forced mate in 2 moves.\n    *   **Nh6+ (Option I):** This also checks the king. Black's only move is `1...Kh8`. White can then force a beautiful \"smothered mate\" sequence with a queen sacrifice: `2. Qg8+!`. Black must capture with the rook (`2...Rxg8`), and then White delivers mate with `3. Nf7#`. This is also a forced win, but it takes 3 moves.\n    *   **Ne5+ (Option G) and Nd6+ (Option H):** These checks do not lead to an immediate mate, but they do win significant material. For instance, after `1. Ne5+ Kg7`, White can play `2. Nxd8`, winning a rook. While winning a rook is great, it's not as decisive as a forced checkmate.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The best move in any chess position is the one that leads to the fastest victory. Both Ng5+ and Nh6+ lead to a forced checkmate. Since Ng5+ achieves the checkmate in 2 moves, while Nh6+ takes 3 moves, **Ng5+ is the objectively best and fastest winning move.**\n\n```python\ndef find_best_chess_move():\n  \"\"\"\n  Analyzes the provided chess position to determine the best move for White.\n  The function prints the analysis of the winning move.\n  \"\"\"\n  print(\"The best move for White is Ng5+.\")\n  print(\"This move initiates a forced checkmate sequence.\")\n  print(\"Let's break it down:\")\n  \n  # Step 1: White's move\n  print(\"1.
