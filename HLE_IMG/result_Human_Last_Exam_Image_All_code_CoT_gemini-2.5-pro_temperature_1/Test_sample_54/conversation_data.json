    "Here is a step-by-step plan to identify the reagents A and B:\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction (1 → 2) to identify reagent A:**\n    *   The starting material (1) is a polycyclic aromatic cation containing three oxygen atoms within its fused ring system (a trioxatriangulenium derivative).\n    *   The product (2) shows that one of these ring oxygen atoms has been replaced by an N-amino group (a nitrogen atom bonded to an -NH2 group).\n    *   This type of transformation, converting a pyrylium-like salt (containing O+) into an N-aminopyridinium-like salt (containing N+-NH2), is characteristically achieved using hydrazine (H2N-NH2). Therefore, reagent A is hydrazine.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction (2 → 3) to identify reagent B:**\n    *   The starting material (2) is the N-amino compound formed in the first step.\n    *   The final product (3) is a quinacridinium derivative. This transformation involves two significant changes from compound 2:\n        1.  A second ring oxygen atom is replaced by a nitrogen atom that is substituted with a propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3).\n        2.  The N-amino group (-N-NH2) is converted into an imino group (-NH).\n    *   The introduction of the N-propyl group indicates that the reagent must be a source of this group, pointing to n-propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2). Primary amines are commonly used to react with these systems, replacing ring oxygen atoms. The conversion of the N-amino group to an NH group is a known reaction that occurs during the synthesis of such quinacridinium systems.\n    *   Therefore, reagent B is n-propylamine.\n\n3.  **Construct the Python code:**\n    *   Based on this analysis, I will create a Python script. The script will define variables for reagent A (Hydrazine) and reagent B (n-Propylamine). It will then print the identities of these reagents and display the overall reaction equations for clarity.\n\n```python\ndef identify_reagents():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the reagents A and B in the provided chemical reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identification of Reagent A\n    # The transformation from compound 1 to 2 involves the replacement of a ring oxygen atom\n    # with an N-NH2 group.
