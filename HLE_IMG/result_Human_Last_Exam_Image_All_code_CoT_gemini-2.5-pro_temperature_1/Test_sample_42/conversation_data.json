    "This is a knowledge-based task. I will use my knowledge base to identify the saint in the icon.\n\n1.  **Analyze the image**: The icon shows an elderly saint with a long, forked white beard, wearing simple monastic robes, and holding a scroll with Cyrillic text. This is a common depiction for a Church Father, especially one from the desert monastic tradition. The style of the fresco, with its expressive highlights and somber palette, is distinctive.\n2.  **Identify the artwork**: This specific fresco is a well-known masterpiece of Orthodox art. It was painted by Theophanes the Greek around 1378 in the Church of the Transfiguration of the Savior on Ilyina Street in Novgorod, Russia.\n3.  **Evaluate the options**:\n    *   A. Saint Anthony the Great: A possible candidate, as he is the father of monasticism and is depicted similarly.\n    *   B. Saint Macarius of Egypt: Also a major desert father. Art historical sources definitively identify this specific fresco by Theophanes the Greek as depicting Saint Macarius of Egypt.\n    *   C. Saint Seraphim of Sarov: A much later Russian saint (d. 1833) with a different typical iconography.\n    *   D. Moses the Prophet: While Theophanes did paint Moses in the same church, that depiction is different. Prophets are shown with scrolls, but this specific image is identified as Macarius.\n    *   E. Saint Varlaam: A less likely candidate compared to the great desert fathers.\n    *   F. Saint Simeon Stylites: He is famously depicted living on a pillar, which is not the case here.\n4.  **Conclusion**: Based on the identification of the artwork as a specific fresco by Theophanes the Greek, the subject is Saint Macarius of Egypt.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script provides a step-by-step analysis to identify the saint in the icon.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the icon to identify the depicted saint.\")\n    print(\"Step 1: The icon shows an elderly, ascetic figure with a long white beard, wearing monastic clothes and holding a scroll.
