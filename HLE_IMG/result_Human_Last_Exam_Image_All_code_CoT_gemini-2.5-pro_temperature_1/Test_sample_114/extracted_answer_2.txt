The reason for the high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is a combination of steric and electronic factors originating from the rigid, cyclic nature of the reaction intermediate, which are absent in the flexible, acyclic system of Reactions 1 and 2.

1.  **General Mechanism:** All three reactions proceed via a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. An N-acyl amino acid is converted *in situ* into a mesoionic 1,3-oxazolium-5-olate (commonly known as a münchnone) using acetic anhydride. This münchnone, which acts as a 1,3-dipole, then reacts with the dipolarophile (methyl propiolate). The initial bicycle adduct is unstable and undergoes a retro-cycloaddition to eliminate CO₂, forming a stable pyrrole product.

2.  **Role of Reactions 1 & 2 (Acyclic System):** The 13C labeling experiment in Reaction 2 is crucial. It reveals that the cycloaddition using the acyclic starting material (N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine) exhibits no regioselectivity, producing a 1:1 mixture of regioisomers. This is because the resulting münchnone intermediate has methyl groups at both the C2 and C4 positions (the termini of the 1,3-dipole). These two ends are sterically and electronically very similar, meaning there is no energetic preference for the alkyne to add in one orientation over the other. The "single product" observed in Reaction 1 is therefore an inseparable 1:1 mixture of these regioisomers.

3.  **Regioselectivity in Reaction 3 (Cyclic System):** In contrast, the starting material in Reaction 3 is the cyclic amino acid N-acetylproline. This leads to the formation of a rigid, fused-ring münchnone intermediate. In this rigid structure, the two ends of the dipole are no longer equivalent:
    *   **Steric Hindrance:** The C4 position is now part of a fused ring junction, making it significantly more sterically hindered than the C2 position (which bears a methyl group). To minimize steric clash, the bulky methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH₃) group of the alkyne preferentially adds to the less hindered C2 side of the dipole.
    *   **Electronic Effects:** The rigid, asymmetric structure also creates a significant electronic difference between C2 and C4. Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) analysis shows that both the primary (HOMO-LUMO energy) and secondary orbital interactions favor one orientation. Specifically, the reaction is controlled by the interaction between the münchnone's Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and the alkyne's Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO). This favors the formation of a bond between C4 of the dipole and the β-carbon (the one with the hydrogen) of the alkyne.

Critically, both the steric and electronic factors independently favor the formation of the *same* regioisomer. This synergistic effect is the reason for the high regioselectivity in Reaction 3, leading to the formation of Product B as a single isomer. The results from Reactions 1 and 2 provide the baseline that demonstrates it is the rigidity and asymmetry imposed by the proline ring that are responsible for this selectivity.
