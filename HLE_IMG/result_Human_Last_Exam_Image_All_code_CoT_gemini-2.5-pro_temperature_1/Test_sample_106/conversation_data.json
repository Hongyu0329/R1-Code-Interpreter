    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Request**\n    The user wants to identify the substituents (either H or CH3) at five specific numbered positions in the product molecule of the given chemical reaction. The answer should be in the format \"1 = V, 2 = W, 3 = X, 4 = Y, 5 = Z\".\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Chemical Reaction**\n    The reaction starts with a saturated pentacyclic alcohol (a triterpenoid derivative) and treats it with catalytic acid (HCl) and heat. This results in a dehydration reaction (loss of H2O) to form an alkene. The prompt explicitly mentions that this transformation involves \"a number of [1,2] shifts,\" which points to a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement mechanism, a common process for terpenes in acidic conditions.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the Product Structure**\n    The most reliable piece of information is the drawing of the final product. The task is to identify the groups at the numbered positions in this structure. The product shown has the characteristic skeleton of olean-12-ene (also known as Î²-amyrin, without the C3-OH group). Let's identify the standard substituents at these positions in the oleanane skeleton.\n    *   **Position 1:** This points to one of the two methyl groups attached to carbon C-4. Therefore, the substituent is **CH3**.\n    *   **Position 2:** This points to the methyl group attached to the ring-junction carbon C-10. Therefore, the substituent is **CH3**.\n    *   **Position 3:** This points to the hydrogen atom attached to the ring-junction carbon C-9. Therefore, the substituent is **H**.\n    *   **Position 4:** This points to the methyl group attached to the ring-junction carbon C-8. Therefore, the substituent is **CH3**.\n    *   **Position 5:** This points to the methyl group attached to the ring-junction carbon C-14. Therefore, the substituent is **CH3**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Resolve Potential Inconsistencies**\n    There is a notable inconsistency in the provided reaction diagram. The starting material is also drawn with an oleanane-type skeleton. A rearrangement of this skeleton would necessarily change the positions of the methyl groups, resulting in a different final skeleton. However, the product is drawn as a standard oleanane. A simple dehydration without rearrangement would not form the double bond at the C12-C13 position. This suggests there might be an error in the drawing of the starting material (it might be an isomer like friedelan-3-ol, which famously rearranges to the oleanane skeleton, although that specific mechanism leads to a different substitution at C-10). Given these conflicting details, the most direct and reliable approach is to identify the substituents based on the clearly depicted product structure.\n\n*   **Step 5: Formulate the Final Answer**\n    Based on the analysis of the product structure (olean-12-ene), the substituents are:\n    *   1 = CH3\n    *   2 = CH3\n    *   3 = H\n    *   4 = CH3\n    *   5 = CH3\n\n*   **Step 6: Generate Python Code**\n    The following Python code will print the final answer in the required format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rearrangement():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the substituents at the specified positions in the product molecule.\n    The product structure is identified as an olean-12-ene skeleton. The substituents\n    at the numbered positions are determined by analyzing this standard structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    substituents = {\n        1: \"CH3\",\n        2: \"CH3\",\n        3: \"H\",\n        4: \"CH3\",\n        5: \"CH3\"\n    }\n\n    # Print the result in the specified format\n    print(f\"1 = {substituents[1]}, 2 = {substituents[2]}, 3 = {substituents[3]}, 4 = {substituents[4]}, 5 = {substituents[5]}\")\n\nsolve_rearrangement()\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = CH3>>>"
