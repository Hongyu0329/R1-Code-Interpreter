The S100B protein binds to the V domain of the RAGE receptor. It can be used as a prognostic marker because its over-expression directly initiates and drives key pathological processes shown in the diagram, including apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss. Therefore, its levels can be used to predict the severity and future course of the neurological disorder.
