# The intramolecular Heck reaction involves several key steps.
# 1. Oxidative addition of Pd(0) into the C-Br bond at carbon 9.
# 2. Migratory insertion of the alkene. The product shows a new bond between carbon 5 and carbon 9.
#    This means the palladium is now attached to carbon 4.
# 3. Beta-hydride elimination. A hydrogen from a carbon adjacent to carbon 4 is eliminated.
#    The adjacent carbons are 3 and 5. Elimination from C5 is a non-productive reverse step.
#    Therefore, a hydrogen from carbon 3 is eliminated.

carbon_atom_1 = 3
carbon_atom_2 = 4

# This elimination process creates a new double bond between the two carbons.
print(f"In the product of the intramolecular Heck reaction, a new alkene (carbon-carbon double bond) is formed between C{carbon_atom_1} and C{carbon_atom_2}.")
