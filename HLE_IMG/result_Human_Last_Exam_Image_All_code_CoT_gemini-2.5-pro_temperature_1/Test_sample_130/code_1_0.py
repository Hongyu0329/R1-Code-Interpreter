def identify_element_from_spectrum():
    """
    Identifies the element based on its characteristic emission spectrum.

    The provided spectrum is highly complex, with a multitude of lines distributed
    across the visible range from blue to red. This pattern is a well-known
    signature of a specific element. By comparing this visual fingerprint to
    known atomic spectra, the element can be identified.

    The spectrum of Hydrogen, for example, is very simple with only four visible lines.
    Helium and Neon have more lines, but Neon is dominated by red and orange,
    and Helium's pattern is different. The extremely dense and complex line
    structure seen in the image is the classic emission spectrum of Iron (Fe).
