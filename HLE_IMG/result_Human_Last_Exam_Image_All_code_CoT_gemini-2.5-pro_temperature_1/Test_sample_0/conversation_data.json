    "This is a mate-in-2 puzzle for Black. My plan is to analyze the board, identify the key threats and pieces, and find a sequence of two moves for Black that results in checkmate, regardless of White's response. The problem has a special constraint: the black queens cannot be moved.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial position:** It's Black's turn to move. The White king is on g1. Its potential escape squares are limited. f1 and f2 are controlled by the black queen on b1. g2 is controlled by the black bishop on h3. The only square the king can currently move to is h1.\n\n2.  **Find Black's first move:** Black needs to make a move that forces a checkmate on the subsequent turn. Let's examine candidate moves (excluding queen moves):\n    *   A check seems like the most forcing option. Let's try moving the knight from d1.\n    *   Consider the move **1... Ne3+**. The knight on d1 moves to e3, delivering a check to the white king on g1.\n\n3.  **Analyze White's response:** Now we must consider all possible legal moves for White in response to 1... Ne3+.\n    *   The king is in check. Can it move? As established, f1, f2, and g2 are all controlled. The only legal move for the king is **2. Kh1**.\n    *   Can the check be blocked? No piece can move between the king on g1 and the knight on e3.\n    *   Can the knight on e3 be captured? No white piece can attack the e3 square.\n    *   Therefore, White's response is forced: **2. Kh1**.\n\n4.  **Find Black's second move (the checkmate):** After 1... Ne3+ 2. Kh1, the white king is on h1. Black needs to deliver the final blow.\n    *   The black knight, now on e3, can move to f1. Let's analyze **2... Nf1#**.\n    *   This move delivers a check to the king on h1.\n    *   Can the king escape?\n        *   The square g1 is now controlled by the knight on f1.\n        *   The square g2 is still controlled by the bishop on h3.\n        *   The king has no escape squares.\n    *   Can the checking piece (the knight on f1) be captured? No.\n    *   Can the check be blocked? No.\n    *   This is checkmate.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The sequence is **Ne3+** followed by **Nf1#**. This is a forced mate in two moves, without moving the black queens.\n\nThe following Python code will print this sequence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the solution to the chess puzzle.\n    The puzzle is a mate in 2 for Black, without moving the queens.\n    \"\"\"\n    move1 = \"Ne3+\"\n    move2 = \"Nf1#\"\n    \n    print(\"The mate-in-2 sequence for Black is:\")\n    print(f\"1. {move1}\")\n    print(f\"2. {move2}\")\n\nsolve_chess_puzzle()\n```\n<<<Ne3+, Nf1#>>>"
