# This script explains the reasoning for selecting the correct image processing method.

# The goal is to identify the filter that transformed the 'Original Image' to the 'Processed Image'.
# The processed image is a smoothed version of the original, with reduced detail and texture.

# Let's analyze the characteristics of the options provided.
# A. Averaging filter + Downsampling + Nearest-neighbor upscaling would create blocky artifacts. The processed image is smooth, not blocky.
# D. Non-Local Means is an edge- and texture-preserving filter. The texture on the parrot is clearly blurred, not preserved.
# E. Downsampling by 4 and then upscaling would cause a very strong blur, potentially losing more edge definition than is seen.

# The choice is between B (DCT) and C (Gaussian Filter). Both are low-pass filters.
# However, the result is extremely smooth and looks like a classic spatial convolution. This makes the Gaussian filter the most direct and likely candidate.

print("The most likely image processing method is C: Applied a Gaussian filter with a 7x7 pixel kernel to the original image.")
print("\nThis conclusion is based on the following observations:")
print("1. The processed image is a smoothly blurred version of the original.")
print("2. There are no blocky artifacts, which rules out methods involving nearest-neighbor upscaling (Option A).")
print("3. Fine textures are heavily smoothed, which makes an edge-preserving filter like Non-Local Means (Option D) unlikely.")
print("4. The effect is a classic example of applying a Gaussian low-pass filter, which smooths an image by taking a weighted average of pixels in a neighborhood.")

# The parameters of the chosen method are:
filter_type = "Gaussian"
kernel_width = 7
kernel_height = 7

print(f"\nDetails of the chosen method (C):")
print(f"Filter Type: {filter_type}")
print(f"The final equation for the kernel size is: {kernel_width}x{kernel_height} pixels")
