    "An elegant way to compute the chromatic polynomial of a graph is by using the deletion-contraction theorem. This theorem states that for any graph G and any edge e in G, the chromatic polynomial P_G(k) satisfies the recurrence relation:\n\nP_G(k) = P_{G-e}(k) - P_{G.e}(k)\n\nwhere:\n*   `P_{G-e}(k)` is the chromatic polynomial of the graph G with the edge `e` deleted.\n*   `P_{G.e}(k)` is the chromatic polynomial of the graph G with the edge `e` contracted.\n\nBy applying this theorem repeatedly, we can break down the original graph into simpler graphs whose chromatic polynomials are known.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph:** The given graph has 5 vertices and 7 edges. Let's label the vertices as in the image. The edges are E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}.\n2.  **Choose an Edge for Deletion-Contraction:** We select the edge e = (1, 2) for our decomposition. This choice simplifies the graph into well-known structures.\n3.  **Compute P_{G.e}(k):** When we contract the edge (1, 2), the new vertex '12' becomes connected to all neighbors of 1 and 2, which are {3, 4, 5}. The subgraph on {3, 4, 5} is a complete graph K3 (a triangle). Since '12' is connected to all of them, the resulting graph `G.e` is the complete graph on 4 vertices, K4. The chromatic polynomial of K_n is k(k-1)...(k-n+1).\n4.  **Compute P_{G-e}(k):** When we delete the edge (1, 2), the resulting graph `G-e` can be seen as the subgraph H on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} with a pendant vertex 1 attached to vertex 5. The subgraph H is a K4 with the edge (2,5) missing. The chromatic polynomial of such a graph with a pendant vertex is `(k-1)` times the polynomial of the base graph H. The polynomial of H (K4-e) can be found using deletion-contraction again: `P_{K4-e} = P_{K4} + P_{K3}`.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Polynomial:** We will use Python with the `sympy` library to perform the polynomial arithmetic: `P_G(k) = P_{G-e}(k) - P_{G.e}(k)`.\n6.  **Print the Result:** The code will print the steps of the calculation and the final polynomial equation, followed by the specific numbers that form the equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_chromatic_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the chromatic polynomial for the given graph using the\n    deletion-contraction theorem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the variable 'k' for the number of colors\n    k = sympy.Symbol('k')\n\n    # The chromatic polynomial for a complete graph K_n is given by:\n    # P_Kn(k) = k * (k-1) * ... * (k-n+1)\n    P_K3 = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2)\n    P_K4 = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) * (k - 3)\n\n    # We apply the deletion-contraction theorem on the edge e = (1, 2).\n    # P_G(k) = P_{G-e}(k) - P_{G.e}(k)\n\n    # 1.
