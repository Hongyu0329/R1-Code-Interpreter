    This function prints the solution to the vortex trajectory puzzle.
    The solution is a 16-character string representing the unique vortex in each plot.
    - B/b: Blue vortex is twice/half strength.
    - G/g: Green vortex is twice/half strength.
    - R/r: Red vortex is twice/half strength.

    # Based on visual analysis of the 16 plots, the sequence is determined as follows:
    # 1: G (Green central, stronger)
    # 2: B (Blue central, stronger)
    # 3: r (Red buffeted, weaker)
    # 4: b (Blue flung out, weaker)
