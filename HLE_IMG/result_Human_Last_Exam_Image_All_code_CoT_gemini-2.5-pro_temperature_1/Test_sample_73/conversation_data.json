    "My plan is to determine the stereochemical configuration, (R) or (S), for each of the four stereocenters indicated in the problem description. The order will be from left to right across the reaction scheme: the stereocenter in the acyl chloride reactant, the stereocenter in the alcohol reactant, the alcohol-derived stereocenter in the product, and finally the acyl-derived stereocenter in the product.\n\n1.  **Analyze the stereocenter in the acyl chloride reactant:** I will assign priorities to the four groups (-OMe, -COCl, -CF3, -Ph) attached to the chiral carbon using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules and then determine its configuration from the given 3D representation.\n2.  **Analyze the stereocenter in the alcohol reactant:** Similarly, I will assign CIP priorities to the groups (-OH, -CH2OMe, -CH2CH(Me)2, -H) on the chiral carbon of the alcohol and determine its configuration.\n3.  **Analyze the alcohol-derived stereocenter in the product:** An esterification reaction does not break any bonds at the alcohol's chiral center. I will verify if the CIP priorities of the substituents change and confirm the configuration in the product.\n4.  **Analyze the acyl-derived stereocenter in the product:** The reaction replaces the -Cl on the acyl chloride with an -O-Alkyl group, forming an ester. While the 3D arrangement of the atoms at the stereocenter itself is unchanged, the change in substituent can alter the CIP priority ranking. I will assign the new priorities and determine how this affects the (R)/(S) designation.\n5.  **Compile the results:** I will present the four stereochemical assignments in the requested order.\n\n```python\ndef solve_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and explains the stereochemical assignment for the four stereocenters\n    in the provided esterification reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Introduction ---\n    print(\"This script determines the (R) or (S) configuration for the four stereocenters in the reaction.\")\n    print(\"The order of analysis is left-to-right: acyl chloride, alcohol, product center from alcohol, product center from acyl chloride.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Stereocenter 1: Acyl Chloride Reactant ---\n    print(\"1.
