    "To find the current I, we first need to determine the total equivalent resistance (Req) of the circuit as seen by the voltage source. The current I is the total current flowing from the 41V source.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve the circuit:\n1.  **Interpret the circuit diagram:** The circuit can be interpreted as two main branches connected in parallel across the 41V source.\n    *   The voltage source is connected between the leftmost vertical wire (let's call it the \"left bus\") and the rightmost vertical wire, which is grounded (the \"right bus\"). So, the potential difference between the left and right buses is 41 V.\n    *   **Branch 1** consists of a single resistor, R_76 = 76 Ω, connected directly between the left and right buses.\n    *   **Branch 2** is a series-parallel combination of the other four resistors (R_8, R_14, R_11, R_29).\n\n2.  **Calculate the equivalent resistance of Branch 2 (R_b2):**\n    *   Resistors R_11 (11 Ω) and R_29 (29 Ω) are in parallel. They share a common junction point and are both connected to the right bus (ground). We'll calculate their equivalent resistance, R_p.\n    *   This parallel combination (R_p) is in series with resistor R_14 (14 Ω).\n    *   This new combination is then in series with resistor R_8 (8 Ω).\n\n3.  **Calculate the total equivalent resistance (Req):**\n    *   Branch 1 (R_76) and Branch 2 (R_b2) are in parallel. We'll combine their resistances to find the total equivalent resistance of the circuit, Req.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total current (I):**\n    *   Using Ohm's Law, the total current I is the source voltage (V) divided by the total equivalent resistance (Req). `I = V / Req`.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Define the given values\nV = 41.0  # Voltage in Volts\nR76 = 76.0\nR8 = 8.0\nR14 = 14.0\nR11 = 11.0\nR29 = 29.0\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate the equivalent resistance of Branch 2 ---\n\n# R11 and R29 are in parallel.\n# Formula for parallel resistors: R_p = (R_a * R_b) / (R_a + R_b)\nprint(\"Step 1: Calculate the equivalent resistance of the parallel combination of R11 and R29.\")\nR_p_11_29 = (R11 * R29) / (R11 + R29)\nprint(f\"R_p = ({R11} * {R29}) / ({R11} + {R29}) = {R_p_11_29:.4f} Ω\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# This parallel combination is in series with R14.\n# Formula for series resistors: R_s = R_a + R_b\nprint(\"Step 2: The result from Step 1 is in series with R14.\")\nR_s1 = R14 + R_p_11_29\nprint(f\"R_s1 = {R14} + {R_p_11_29:.4f} = {R_s1:.4f} Ω\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# This new combination is in series with R8.\nprint(\"Step 3: The result from Step 2 is in series with R8 to get the total resistance of Branch 2.\")\nR_b2 = R8 + R_s1\nprint(f\"R_b2 = {R8} + {R_s1:.4f} = {R_b2:.4f} Ω\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the total equivalent resistance (Req) ---\n\n# Branch 1 (R76) is in parallel with Branch 2 (R_b2).\nprint(\"Step 4: The total equivalent resistance (Req) is R76 in parallel with Branch 2 (R_b2).\")\nReq = (R76 * R_b2) / (R76 + R_b2)\nprint(f\"Req = ({R76} * {R_b2:.4f}) / ({R76} + {R_b2:.4f}) = {Req:.4f} Ω\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the total current I ---\n\n# Using Ohm's Law: I = V / Req\nprint(\"Step 5: Calculate the total current I using Ohm's Law (I = V / Req).\")\nI = V / Req\nprint(f\"I = {V} V / {Req:.4f} Ω\")\nprint(f\"I = {I:.4f} A\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Final Answer\nprint(\"The final value of the current I is:\")\n# Use sys.stdout.write to prevent adding a newline, matching the format request.\nsys.stdout.write(f\"<<<{I:.4f}>>>\")\n```"
