    "This reaction is a multi-component reaction, specifically a type of Strecker synthesis followed by an intramolecular cyclization. Let's break down the steps to identify compound A.\n\n**Step-by-step mechanism:**\n\n1.  **Imine Formation:** The primary amine of 2-aminopyridine acts as a nucleophile and attacks one of the electrophilic aldehyde groups of o-phthalaldehyde. After condensation, this forms an imine intermediate and releases one molecule of water.\n    `2-Aminopyridine + o-Phthalaldehyde → Intermediate-Imine + H₂O`\n\n2.  **Cyanide Addition:** The potassium fluoride (KF) acts as a catalyst to activate the trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN), generating a cyanide ion (CN⁻). This strong nucleophile attacks the carbon of the imine group to form an α-aminonitrile intermediate. The overall process consumes the equivalent of one molecule of hydrogen cyanide (HCN).\n    `Intermediate-Imine + HCN → Intermediate-α-aminonitrile`\n\n3.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The molecule now contains a secondary amine (-NH-) and a second aldehyde group (-CHO) in close proximity. The nitrogen atom of the amine attacks the carbon atom of the remaining aldehyde group. This intramolecular reaction forms a new five-membered ring, resulting in a stable cyclic hemiaminal.\n\nThis final cyclic hemiaminal is **Compound A**. Under the mild conditions specified (28 °C), the reaction likely stops at this stable intermediate. Further dehydration or oxidation might occur under harsher conditions (e.g., higher temperature, presence of an acid catalyst or oxidant) but is not expected here.\n\n**Identification of Compound A:**\n\n*   **Name:** 3-hydroxy-2-(pyridin-2-yl)isoindoline-1-carbonitrile\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₁₄H₁₁N₃O\n\nThe following Python code calculates the molecular weight of the reactants and the product, and prints the balanced chemical equation for the reaction.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies Compound A from the given reaction, provides its\n    molecular formula and name, and prints the balanced chemical equation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define atomic weights for calculation\n    atomic_weights = {\n        'C': 12.011,\n        'H': 1.008,\n        'N': 14.007,\n        'O': 15.999,\n    }\n\n    # Define molecular formulas for reactants and the product\n    # Note: TMSCN provides the 'CN' group, and H2O provides the proton, so we use HCN for balancing.\n    formulas = {\n        \"2-Aminopyridine\": {'C': 5, 'H': 6, 'N': 2},\n        \"o-Phthalaldehyde\": {'C': 8, 'H': 6, 'O': 2},\n        \"HCN (from TMSCN/H2O)\": {'H': 1, 'C': 1, 'N': 1},\n        \"Compound A\": {'C': 14, 'H': 11, 'N': 3, 'O': 1},\n        \"Water (byproduct)\": {'H': 2, 'O': 1}\n    }\n\n    # Function to calculate molecular weight\n    def calculate_mw(formula):\n        mw = 0\n        for atom, count in formula.items():\n            mw += atomic_weights.get(atom, 0) * count\n        return mw\n\n    # Identify Compound A\n    compound_A_name = \"3-hydroxy-2-(pyridin-2-yl)isoindoline-1-carbonitrile\"\n    compound_A_formula_str = \"C14H11N3O\"\n    \n    print(f\"Compound A is {compound_A_name}.\")\n    print(f\"Its molecular formula is {compound_A_formula_str}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Print the balanced chemical equation\n    # Reactants: C5H6N2 + C8H6O2 + HCN\n    # Products: C14H11N3O + H2O\n    print(\"The balanced chemical equation is:\")\n    \n    # Extracting coefficients for printing the equation clearly\n    r1_formula = formulas[\"2-Aminopyridine\"]\n    r2_formula = formulas[\"o-Phthalaldehyde\"]\n    r3_formula = formulas[\"HCN (from TMSCN/H2O)\"]\n    p1_formula = formulas[\"Compound A\"]\n    p2_formula = formulas[\"Water (byproduct)\"]\n\n    # Print out each number in the final equation\n    print(f\"C{r1_formula['C']}H{r1_formula['H']}N{r1_formula['N']} + \"\n          f\"C{r2_formula['C']}H{r2_formula['H']}O{r2_formula['O']} + \"\n          f\"H{r3_formula['H']}C{r3_formula['C']}N{r3_formula['N']} -> \"\n          f\"C{p1_formula['C']}H{p1_formula['H']}N{p1_formula['N']}O{p1_formula['O']} + \"\n          f\"H{p2_formula['H']}O{p2_formula['O']}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Verify mass balance (optional)\n    mw_reactants = (calculate_mw(r1_formula) + \n                    calculate_mw(r2_formula) + \n                    calculate_mw(r3_formula))\n    mw_products = (calculate_mw(p1_formula) + \n                   calculate_mw(p2_formula))\n    \n    print(f\"Molecular weight of Reactants: {mw_reactants:.3f} g/mol\")\n    print(f\"Molecular weight of Products: {mw_products:.3f} g/mol\")\n    print(\"The mass is balanced.\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n```\n<<<3-hydroxy-2-(pyridin-2-yl)isoindoline-1-carbonitrile>>>"
