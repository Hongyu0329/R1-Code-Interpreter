    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the task:\n\n1.  **Identify Each Specimen:** I will first visually identify each mineral based on its crystal habit, color, and luster.\n    *   **Specimen A:** A dark, stubby, prismatic crystal. This is characteristic of a **pyroxene** (e.g., augite).\n    *   **Specimen B:** A thin, flaky, green mineral with perfect cleavage in one direction. This is a classic example of a sheet silicate, likely from the **mica** or **chlorite** group.\n    *   **Specimen C:** A granular aggregate of green crystals. This is a common habit for **olivine**.\n    *   **Specimen D:** A transparent, six-sided prismatic crystal. This is a classic form of **quartz**.\n\n2.  **Classify by Silicate Structure:** Next, I will classify each identified mineral into its silicate group, which is based on how the silica tetrahedra (the basic building blocks) are linked.\n    *   **Olivine (C):** Belongs to the **Nesosilicates**, where the silica tetrahedra are isolated from each other. This is the simplest structure.\n    *   **Pyroxene (A):** Belongs to the **Inosilicates** (single chain), where tetrahedra link to form long single chains.\n    *   **Mica/Chlorite (B):** Belongs to the **Phyllosilicates** (sheet silicates), where tetrahedra link to form two-dimensional sheets.\n    *   **Quartz (D):** Belongs to the **Tectosilicates** (framework silicates), where every tetrahedron is linked to four others, forming a complex three-dimensional framework. This is the most complex structure.\n\n3.  **Order by Complexity:** I will arrange the specimens from the simplest silicate structure to the most complex.\n    *   1st (Least complex): **C (Olivine)** - Isolated Tetrahedra (Nesosilicate)\n    *   2nd: **A (Pyroxene)** - Single Chains (Inosilicate)\n    *   3rd: **B (Mica/Chlorite)** - Sheets (Phyllosilicate)\n    *   4th (Most complex): **D (Quartz)** - Framework (Tectosilicate)\n\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script to formalize this process, store the data, sort it by complexity, and print the final ordered list.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mineral_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies mineral specimens and orders them by increasing silicate structure complexity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify specimens and classify their silicate structure.\n    # We assign a complexity score: 1 (simplest) to 4 (most complex).\n    specimens = [\n        {'label': 'C', 'mineral': 'Olivine', 'group': 'Nesosilicate (Isolated Tetrahedra)', 'complexity': 1},\n        {'label': 'A', 'mineral': 'Pyroxene', 'group': 'Inosilicate (Single Chain)', 'complexity': 2},\n        {'label': 'B', 'mineral': 'Mica/Chlorite', 'group': 'Phyllosilicate (Sheet)', 'complexity': 3},\n        {'label': 'D', 'mineral': 'Quartz', 'group': 'Tectosilicate (Framework)', 'complexity': 4}\n    ]\n\n    # Step 3: Sort the specimens based on the complexity score.\n    sorted_specimens = sorted(specimens, key=lambda x: x['complexity'])\n\n    # Step 4: Print the identification and the final ordered list.\n    print(\"Identifying and ordering mineral specimens by silicate structure complexity:\\n\")\n    for specimen in sorted_specimens:\n        print(f\"Specimen {specimen['label']}:\")\n        print(f\"  - Identification: {specimen['mineral']}\")\n        print(f\"  - Silicate Group: {specimen['group']}\")\n        print(f\"  - Complexity Level: {specimen['complexity']}\\n\")\n\n    ordered_labels = [s['label'] for s in sorted_specimens]\n    final_order_str = \", \".join(ordered_labels)\n\n    print(f\"The order of specimens in increasing silicate structure complexity is: {final_order_str}\")\n\nsolve_mineral_complexity()\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>\n```"
