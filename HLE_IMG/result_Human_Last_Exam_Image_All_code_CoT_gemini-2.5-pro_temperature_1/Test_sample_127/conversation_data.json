    "My plan is to solve this chemical structure problem by codifying the principles of molecular rotation into a Python script.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structure:** I will first represent the relevant parts of the molecule—the phenyl rings G, H, J, K, L and their points of attachment—in a Python data structure.\n2.  **Establish Rotation Rules:** I'll define a function that determines if a ring can rotate \"freely\". Free rotation around a single bond is the default, but it can be prevented by steric hindrance (a physical clash with other parts of the molecule). My rules will be:\n    *   A ring attached at a position far from the crowded central part of the molecule (like position 4 of rings A and C) can rotate freely.\n    *   A ring attached at a position ortho (adjacent) to the point of coordination with the central Iridium atom (like position 6 on rings A, C, or F) will be sterically hindered and cannot rotate freely.\n3.  **Apply Rules and Conclude:** The script will iterate through each ring, apply these rules, and print a step-by-step analysis. Finally, it will print the list of rings that can rotate freely and identify the corresponding answer choice.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_chemistry_rotation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the steric hindrance of phenyl rings in a complex cation\n    to determine which can rotate freely.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Represent the molecular structure data.\n    # We map each peripheral ring (H, K, J, L, G) to the main ring it's attached to\n    # and its position on that ring.\n    rings_data = {\n        'H': {'attached_to_ring': 'A', 'attachment_pos': 4},\n        'K': {'attached_to_ring': 'A', 'attachment_pos': 6},\n        'J': {'attached_to_ring': 'C', 'attachment_pos': 4},\n        'L': {'attached_to_ring': 'C', 'attachment_pos': 6},\n        'G': {'attached_to_ring': 'F', 'attachment_pos': 6},\n    }\n\n    # Information about the parent rings' role in the complex.\n    parent_rings_info = {\n        'A': 'cyclometalated phenyl (bonds to Ir via Carbon)',\n        'C': 'cyclometalated phenyl (bonds to Ir via Carbon)',\n        'F': 'bipyridine ligand ring (bonds to Ir via Nitrogen)',\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing which phenyl rings can rotate freely:\")\n    print(\"=\"*50)\n\n    freely_rotating_rings = []\n\n    # Step 2 & 3: Apply rotation rules to each ring and print the analysis.\n    for ring_id in sorted(rings_data.keys()):\n        data = rings_data[ring_id]\n        parent_ring = data['attached_to_ring']\n        position = data['attachment_pos']\n        parent_info = parent_rings_info[parent_ring]\n\n        print(f\"Processing Ring '{ring_id}':\")\n        print(f\"  - Attached to Ring '{parent_ring}' at position {position}.\")\n\n        # Rule-based check for free rotation\n        if position == 4:\n            can_rotate = True\n            reason = \"This position is 'para' to the ligand's connection point, far from the central Iridium atom and other ligands.
