    This function determines the IUPAC name of the product from the given reaction.
    The reaction is identified as an Oxy-Cope rearrangement, a type of [3,3]-sigmatropic shift,
    which is common for 1,5-dien-3-ols under thermal conditions.
    The reaction proceeds through a rearrangement to form a 10-membered ring enol,
    which then tautomerizes to the final ketone product.
