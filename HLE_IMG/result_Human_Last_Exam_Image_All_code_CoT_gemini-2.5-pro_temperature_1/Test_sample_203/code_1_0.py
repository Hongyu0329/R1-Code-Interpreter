    This function determines the Heesch number for the polygons in the image.

    # Step 1: Define the Heesch number.
    # The Heesch number of a polygon is the maximum number of layers of congruent
    # copies of the polygon that can surround it without overlapping. If a polygon
    # can tile the plane, its Heesch number is defined as infinity.

    # Step 2: Analyze the polygon's properties.
    # The image shows three identical polygons. Let's analyze the shape.
    # The polygon is a hexagon-like shape where opposite sides are 180-degree
    # rotations of each other. This property is known as central symmetry.
    # - The top and bottom edges are straight and parallel.
    # - The top-right side is a 180-degree rotation of the bottom-left side.
    # - The top-left side is a 180-degree rotation of the bottom-right side.

    # Step 3: Apply the relevant mathematical theorem.
    # A theorem in geometry states that any centrally symmetric hexagon can tile
    # the plane. This property holds for non-convex hexagons like the one pictured.
    # Since the polygon can tile the plane, it can be surrounded by an infinite
    # number of layers of itself.

    # Step 4: Determine the Heesch number.
    # Based on the definition, a polygon that tiles the plane has a Heesch number
    # of infinity.
    # We will use the Unicode symbol for infinity.
    heesch_number_polygon = "\u221e"

    # Step 5: State the result for all three polygons.
    # Since all three polygons in the image are identical, they all have the same
    # Heesch number.
    polygon1_heesch = heesch_number_polygon
    polygon2_heesch = heesch_number_polygon
    polygon3_heesch = heesch_number_polygon

    # The final answer requires printing the numbers from the "equation".
    # Here, the "equation" is simply the assignment of the Heesch number to each polygon.
    # Heesch Number(P1) = ∞
    # Heesch Number(P2) = ∞
    # Heesch Number(P3) = ∞
    # We will print the results separated by commas.
