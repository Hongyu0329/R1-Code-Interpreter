    "Here is my step-by-step analysis of the ECG to arrive at the diagnosis.\n\n1.  **Rhythm and Rate Assessment:** The first step is to assess the rhythm and heart rate.\n    *   The rhythm is fast, clearly a tachycardia (rate > 100 bpm). By estimating the R-R interval (around 1.5 to 2 large squares), the rate is approximately 150-200 bpm.\n    *   The rhythm is irregular, as seen by the varying R-R intervals in the rhythm strip.\n\n2.  **QRS Complex Assessment:** Next, I will analyze the QRS complexes.\n    *   The QRS duration is wide (greater than 3 small squares or 0.12 seconds).\n    *   This combination of a fast rate, irregular rhythm, and wide QRS complexes creates a differential diagnosis of an irregular wide complex tachycardia. The main possibilities are Atrial Fibrillation with aberrancy (a bundle branch block), Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation, or Ventricular Tachycardia (which can sometimes be irregular).\n\n3.  **Applying Diagnostic Criteria for Wide Complex Tachycardia:** To differentiate between the possibilities, we look for specific features that point towards a ventricular origin (Ventricular Tachycardia - VT).\n    *   **Lead aVR:** There is a prominent, initial, monophasic R wave in lead aVR. An initial R wave in aVR is highly specific for VT (Vereckei algorithm).\n    *   **Precordial Leads (V1-V6):** All the QRS complexes in the precordial leads are predominantly negative (pointing downwards). This is known as negative concordance, which is another strong predictor of VT.\n    *   **Axis:** The axis is difficult to determine precisely but appears to be leftward/superior.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** While the irregular rhythm could suggest an atrial origin (like Atrial Fibrillation), the presence of highly specific morphological criteria for VT (a dominant R wave in aVR and negative concordance in the precordial leads) makes Ventricular Tachycardia the most likely diagnosis. The irregularity, in this case, does not rule out VT.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided ECG findings to determine the diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"ECG Analysis Steps:\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Assess Rhythm and Rate\")\n    print(\" - Rhythm: The R-R intervals are variable, indicating an irregular rhythm.\")\n    print(\" - Rate: The rate is rapid, approximately 150-200 beats per minute.

This is called 'negative concordance' and is also highly specific for VT.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Evaluate other possibilities\")\n    print(\" - Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy: While it causes an irregular WCT, it would not typically show a dominant R in aVR or precordial concordance.\")\n    print(\" - Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation: Also an irregular WCT, but the specific VT criteria seen here make it less likely.\")\n    print(\" - SVT with Aberrancy: This is typically a regular rhythm.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Conclusion\")\n    print(\" - The combination of a wide complex tachycardia with a dominant R wave in aVR and negative precordial concordance strongly indicates a ventricular origin.\")\n    print(\" - Therefore, the diagnosis is Ventricular Tachycardia.\")\n\nanalyze_ecg()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
