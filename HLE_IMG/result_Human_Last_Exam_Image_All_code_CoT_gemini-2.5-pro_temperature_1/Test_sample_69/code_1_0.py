def solve_cellular_automaton():
    """
    Deduces the elementary cellular automaton rules that could produce the given pattern.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Analyze the pattern to determine which transitions (neighborhood -> next state) are fixed.
    2. Identify which transitions are not present in the pattern, making their outcomes variable.
    3. Calculate the base rule number (assuming variables are 0).
    4. Generate all possible rules by adding combinations of powers of 2 for the variable bits.
    5. Print the derivation and the final sorted list of rules.

    # From visual inspection of the pattern, we deduce the following required transitions:
    # Neighborhood -> Next State
    # (0,0,0) -> 0  (The white background remains white)
    # (0,0,1) -> 1  (The left edge of the triangle grows)
    # (0,1,0) -> 0  (A single black cell surrounded by white becomes white)
    # (1,0,0) -> 1  (The right edge of the triangle grows)
    # (1,0,1) -> 1  (The internal checkerboard pattern propagates)

    # are never observed: (1,1,1), (1,1,0), (0,1,1). The rule's output for these
    # is undetermined.
