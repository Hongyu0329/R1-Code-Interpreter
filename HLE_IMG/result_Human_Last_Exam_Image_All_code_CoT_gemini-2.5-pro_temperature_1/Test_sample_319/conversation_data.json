    "My plan is to identify the phenomenon depicted in the image by analyzing its components.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The image contains two plots. The top plot is a spectrogram (frequency vs. time), and the bottom plot is a waveform (amplitude vs. time).\n2.  **Interpret the Spectrogram:** The spectrogram shows a long, steady horizontal line, which represents a pure tone of a single, constant frequency. This tone is briefly interrupted by a vertical smear of blue, which indicates a short burst of noise containing a wide range of frequencies.\n3.  **Interpret the Waveform:** The waveform shows a perfect, regular sine wave corresponding to the pure tone. During the interruption, the waveform becomes complex and irregular, representing the addition of noise. After the burst, it returns to a clean sine wave.\n4.  **Identify the Illusion:** This setup is a classic demonstration of an auditory illusion. Although the pure tone is physically removed and replaced by noise, a human listener typically perceives the tone as continuing uninterrupted *through* the noise. The brain perceptually \"restores\" the missing sound segment.\n5.  **Name the Phenomenon:** This effect is called the **auditory continuity illusion**. It's a fundamental example of how the brain organizes and interprets sensory information to create a coherent perception of the world.\n6.  **Code Generation:** I will create a Python script that stores the name of this phenomenon in a variable and then prints it to the console.\n\n```python\ndef identify_phenomenon():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the name of the auditory illusion depicted in the image.\n\n    The image shows a pure tone being interrupted by a burst of noise.\n    Perceptually, the tone is often heard as continuing through the noise.\n    This is known as the auditory continuity illusion.\n    \"\"\"\n    phenomenon_name = \"Auditory continuity illusion\"\n    print(f\"The name of the phenomenon is: {phenomenon_name}\")\n\nidentify_phenomenon()\n```\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion>>>"
