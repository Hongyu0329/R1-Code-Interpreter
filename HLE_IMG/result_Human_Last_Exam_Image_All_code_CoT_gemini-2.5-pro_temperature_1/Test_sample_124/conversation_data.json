    "To find the total current flowing from the voltage source, we need to calculate the total equivalent resistance of the circuit and then use Ohm's law (I = V/R).\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the circuit:**\n    *   The circuit has a voltage source V2 = 1V.\n    *   We can see four main parallel branches connected across the voltage source.\n    *   **Branch 1:** Resistor R1 (3 Ω) is connected directly across the voltage source.\n    *   **Branch 2:** Resistor R2 (7 Ω) is also connected in parallel. Its top is connected to ground (negative terminal) via the wire leading from the node between R1 and R2. Its bottom is connected to the positive terminal via the wire leading from the node between R2 and R3.\n    *   **Branch 3:** Resistor R3 (9 Ω) is also in parallel, with its top connected to the positive terminal and its bottom connected to ground.\n    *   **Branch 4:** Resistors R7 (100 Ω) and R8 (100 Ω) are in series with each other. This series combination is then connected in parallel with the other branches.\n\n2.  **Calculate the resistance of the series part (Branch 4):**\n    *   R_series = R7 + R8\n\n3.  **Calculate the total current:**\n    *   The total current (I_total) from the source is the sum of the currents flowing through each parallel branch.\n    *   I_total = I_R1 + I_R2 + I_R3 + I_series\n    *   I_total = (V2 / R1) + (V2 / R2) + (V2 / R3) + (V2 / (R7 + R8))\n\n4.  **Substitute the values and compute the result:**\n    *   V2 = 1 V\n    *   R1 = 3 Ω\n    *   R2 = 7 Ω\n    *   R3 = 9 Ω\n    *   R7 = 100 Ω\n    *   R8 = 100 Ω\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Define the component values from the circuit diagram\nV2 = 1.0  # Voltage in Volts\nR1 = 3.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR2 = 7.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR3 = 9.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR7 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms\nR8 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms\n\n# Step 1: Explain the circuit configuration.\nprint(\"The circuit consists of four parallel branches connected to the 1V source:\")\nprint(f\"1.
