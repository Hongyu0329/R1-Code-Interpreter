    "Based on the analysis of the provided images, the task is to identify the biological process being shown.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n1.  **Analyze the images:** The images are labeled L, M, and N, suggesting a time sequence. They show a filamentous, segmented structure, which is characteristic of a fungal hypha.\n2.  **Examine Image L:** This image shows a mature, relatively straight hypha with visible cross-walls (septa). An arrowhead points towards one of these septa.\n3.  **Examine Image M:** In this frame, a small bulge is forming on the side of the hypha, near the septum indicated by the arrowhead in the previous frame. The hypha has started to curve slightly.\n4.  **Examine Image N:** The bulge has grown significantly and is developing into a new, smaller hypha, forming a lateral branch. The main hypha is now distinctly bent at the point of branching.\n5.  **Synthesize the observations:** The sequence from L to N clearly illustrates the formation of a new branch from an existing hypha. This is a fundamental process of vegetative growth in filamentous fungi, allowing them to explore their environment and form a network (mycelium).\n6.  **Conclusion:** The process depicted is hyphal branching. I will create a Python script to print this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef identify_biological_process():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided image sequence (L, M, N) and identifies the biological process.\n    The images show the following steps:\n    1.  Image L: A mature fungal hypha (a filamentous cell).\n    2.  Image M: The initiation of an outgrowth or bulge from the side of the hypha.\n    3.  Image N: The development of the outgrowth into a new lateral branch.\n    This entire sequence is a key part of how fungi grow and spread.\n    \"\"\"\n    process_name = \"Hyphal branching\"\n    description = (\n        \"The process depicted in the image is hyphal branching. \"\n        \"This is a form of vegetative growth in filamentous fungi where a new branch emerges and grows from the side of an existing hypha, \"\n        \"allowing the fungus to form a complex network called a mycelium.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(description)\n\nidentify_biological_process()\n```\n<<<Hyphal branching>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
