    "Based on my analysis of the image, I will determine the correct caries classification.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will first analyze the provided image to identify the location of the dental lesion on the tooth. The image clearly shows decay on the chewing surface of a back tooth (a molar).\n2.  I will then recall the G.V. Black classification system, which is a standard method for categorizing dental caries based on their location.\n3.  I will match the lesion's location from the image to the corresponding G.V. Black classification. The decay is in the pits and fissures of the occlusal surface.\n4.  Finally, I will generate a Python script that explains this logic and prints the resulting classification. The lesion shown is also \"recurrent\" or \"secondary\" caries, as it's adjacent to an existing filling, but its locational classification is determined by the G.V. Black system.\n\n```python\ndef get_caries_classification():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a dental lesion's location to provide its G.V.
