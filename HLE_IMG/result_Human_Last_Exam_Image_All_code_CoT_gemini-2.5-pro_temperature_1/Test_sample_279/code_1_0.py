    # G.V. Black's classification system is based on the location of the caries on the tooth.
    # The key locations are:
    # Class I: Pits and fissures of occlusal surfaces of posterior teeth.
    # Class II: Proximal (in-between) surfaces of posterior teeth.
    # Class III: Proximal surfaces of anterior teeth not involving the incisal edge.
    # Class IV: Proximal surfaces of anterior teeth involving the incisal edge.
    # Class V: Gingival (gumline) third of the facial or lingual surfaces.
    # Class VI: Cusp tips or incisal edges.

    # Analysis of the image:
    # 1. The tooth is a posterior tooth (molar).
    # 2. The lesion (decay) is on the occlusal (chewing) surface.
    # 3. The lesion is located within the pits and fissures of that surface.
    # 4. This location directly corresponds to G.V. Black's Class I.
