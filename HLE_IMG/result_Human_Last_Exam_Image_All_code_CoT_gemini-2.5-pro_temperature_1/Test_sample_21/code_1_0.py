# Step 1: Define the initial change based on the fiscal expansion.
# Let's assume the government increases spending by 100 units (e.g., $100 billion).
delta_G = 100

print(f"A debt-financed fiscal expansion means government spending (G) increases.")
print(f"Let's assume the change in G, ΔG = {delta_G}\n")

# Step 2: Apply the condition that increased private saving offsets the expansion.
# This is the key assumption of Ricardian Equivalence.
delta_Sp = delta_G
print(f"The problem states this is completely offset by increased private saving (Sp).")
print(f"Therefore, the change in Sp, ΔSp = {delta_Sp}\n")

# Step 3: Calculate the change in public saving (Sg).
# Public saving is T - G. Since T is unchanged and G increases, public saving decreases.
delta_Sg = -delta_G
print(f"The increase in government spending reduces public saving (Sg = T - G).")
print(f"Therefore, the change in Sg, ΔSg = {delta_Sg}\n")

# Step 4: Define the change in Investment (I).
# It's standard to assume investment is unchanged in this specific scenario.
delta_I = 0
print(f"We assume no change in investment (I).")
print(f"Therefore, the change in I, ΔI = {delta_I}\n")

# Step 5: Calculate the total change in the Current Account (CA).
# The formula for the change in the current account is: ΔCA = ΔSp + ΔSg - ΔI
delta_CA = delta_Sp + delta_Sg - delta_I

print("The change in the current account (ΔCA) is calculated as:")
print(f"ΔCA = ΔSp + ΔSg - ΔI")
print(f"ΔCA = {delta_Sp} + ({delta_Sg}) - {delta_I}")
print(f"ΔCA = {delta_CA}\n")

# Step 6: State the final conclusion.
print("Conclusion:")
print("A result of 0 means the current account balance is unchanged.")
print("The increase in private saving perfectly cancels out the decrease in public saving, leading to no net effect on the country's current account.")

# The final answer is the conceptual impact, not the number.
final_answer = "No impact / Unchanged"
