    "Here is my plan to identify the opera from the provided sheet music:\n\n1.  **Analyze Textual Clues:** I will examine the text on the score. The instrument names (\"gr. Fl.\", \"Hob.\", \"Fag.\", \"Br.\"), performance instructions (\"mit DÃ¤mpfer\"), and stage directions (\"Vorhang\") are in German. This strongly suggests the opera is from a German-speaking country (Germany or Austria). The specific direction \"1 (Vorhang)\" indicates that this is the very beginning of a scene or act where the curtain rises.\n\n2.  **Analyze Musical Style:** The score is for a large orchestra with a heavily divided string section. The harmonies are dense and chromatic, which is characteristic of the late-Romantic and early 20th-century periods. This points towards composers like Richard Strauss, Franz Schreker, or Alexander von Zemlinsky.\n\n3.  **Conduct a Targeted Search:** Combining these clues, I will search for a German opera from the early 20th century whose second act begins exactly as shown, with the stage direction \"(Vorhang)\" at rehearsal mark 1.\n\n4.  **Identify and Verify:** This specific combination of clues leads to Franz Schreker's opera *Der ferne Klang* (The Distant Sound). I will then verify this by comparing the provided image to an official score of the beginning of Act II of *Der ferne Klang* to ensure it is an exact match.\n\n5.  **Provide the Answer:** After confirming the identity of the opera, I will write a simple Python script to print the name, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the name of the opera identified from the sheet music.\n    The sheet music is the opening of the second act of Franz Schreker's opera 'Der ferne Klang'.\n    \"\"\"\n    opera_name = \"Der ferne Klang\"\n    print(f\"The opera is: {opera_name}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Der ferne Klang>>>"
