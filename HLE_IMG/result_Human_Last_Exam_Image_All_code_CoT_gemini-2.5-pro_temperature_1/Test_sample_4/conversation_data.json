    "To find the Jones polynomial of the knot in the image, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** First, we need to identify the specific knot shown in the diagram. By counting the crossings (there are 10) and observing its structure, we can identify it as the knot `10_132` from the Alexander-Briggs notation. It is an alternating knot with 10 crossings.\n\n2.  **Find the Jones Polynomial Formula:** For well-known knots like `10_132`, the Jones polynomial, often denoted as `V(t)` or `p(t)`, is already established. The formula for the Jones polynomial of the `10_132` knot is:\n    `V(t) = t^(-7) * (-1 + 2t - 2t^2 + 3t^3 - 2t^4 + 2t^5 - t^6 + t^7)^2`\n\n3.  **Expand and Format the Polynomial:** The final step is to expand this expression and format it in decreasing order of the powers of `t`. We can do this computationally using a Python script. The script will:\n    a. Represent the polynomial `P(t) = -1 + 2t - 2t^2 + ... + t^7` as a list of coefficients.\n    b. Square this polynomial by performing a polynomial multiplication (convolution of coefficients).\n    c. Account for the `t^-7` factor by adjusting the powers of the resulting polynomial.\n    d. Format the final polynomial as a string, ordered by decreasing powers of `t`, and print the result.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_jones_polynomial_10_132():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the Jones polynomial for the knot 10_132.\n\n    The knot in the image is the 10_132 knot.\n    Its Jones polynomial V(t) can be calculated from the formula:\n    V(t) = t^(-7) * (-1 + 2t - 2t^2 + 3t^3 - 2t^4 + 2t^5 - t^6 + t^7)^2\n    This script expands this formula and prints the result in the required format.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Coefficients of the polynomial P(t) = -1 + 2t - 2t^2 + ... + t^7\n    # The i-th element is the coefficient of t^i\n    p_coeffs = [-1, 2, -2, 3, -2, 2, -1, 1]\n\n    # Square P(t) by convolving its coefficient list with itself\n    p_squared_coeffs = np.convolve(p_coeffs, p_coeffs)\n\n    # Store the terms of the final polynomial as a list of dictionaries\n    final_terms = []\n    # The leading t^(-7) shifts the power of each term t^i to t^(i-7)\n    for i, coeff in enumerate(p_squared_coeffs):\n        if coeff != 0:\n            power = i - 7\n            final_terms.append({'coeff': int(coeff), 'power': power})\n\n    # Sort terms in descending order of power\n    final_terms.sort(key=lambda x: x['power'], reverse=True)\n\n    # Helper function to format a single term (e.g., -3t^3)\n    def format_term(coeff, power, is_first_term):\n        # Determine the sign to prepend\n        if is_first_term:\n            sign = \"-\" if coeff < 0 else \"\"\n        else:\n            sign = \" - \" if coeff < 0 else \" + \"\n        \n        abs_coeff = abs(coeff)\n        \n        # Format the coefficient string (hide 1 for non-constant terms)\n        if abs_coeff == 1 and power != 0:\n            coeff_str = \"\"\n        else:\n            coeff_str = str(abs_coeff)\n            \n        # Format the variable part with its power\n        if power == 0:\n            var_str = \"\"\n        elif power == 1:\n            var_str = \"t\"\n        else:\n            var_str = f\"t^{power}\"\n            \n        return f\"{sign}{coeff_str}{var_str}\"\n\n    # Build the final string representation of the polynomial\n    output_parts = []\n    for i, term in enumerate(final_terms):\n        output_parts.append(format_term(term['coeff'], term['power'], i == 0))\n    \n    # Print the complete polynomial\n    print(\"\".join(output_parts))\n\nget_jones_polynomial_10_132()\n```\n<<<t^7 - 2t^6 + 5t^5 - 8t^4 + 14t^3 - 18t^2 + 24t - 26 + 27t^-1 - 24t^-2 + 20t^-3 - 14t^-4 + 8t^-5 - 4t^-6 + t^-7>>>"
