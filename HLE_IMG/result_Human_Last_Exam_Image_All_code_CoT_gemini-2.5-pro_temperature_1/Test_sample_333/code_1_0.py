def solve_airfoil_matching():
    """
    This function determines the correct pairing between airfoil shapes (A-H)
    and their pressure coefficient distributions (1-8).

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  Separate airfoils into symmetrical (A-D) and cambered (E-H) groups.
    2.  For symmetrical airfoils, lift increases with thickness (A<B<C<D).
        This matches the increasing lift (area) in plots 8, 1, 2, 5.
        A->8, B->1, C->2, D->5.
    3.  For cambered airfoils (E,F,G,H) and plots (3,4,6,7):
        - Airfoil H is thinnest, matching the sharpest suction peak in Plot 6. (H->6)
        - Airfoil G has high forward camber, matching the front-loaded Plot 7. (G->7)
        - Airfoil E is thicker than F, producing more lift. Plot 3 has more lift than Plot 4.
          So, E->3 and F->4.
    4.  The final sequence for A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H is 8,1,2,5,3,4,7,6.
