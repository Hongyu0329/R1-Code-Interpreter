    This script solves the visual puzzle by identifying and applying a rule for the number of dots.

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  The shape in each row is consistent. Row 1 has Circles, Row 2 has Squares, Row 3 has Triangles.
        The missing piece is in Row 3, so its shape must be a Triangle.
    2.  A rule is observed for the number of dots in the third column for rows with polygons (Square, Triangle).
        The rule is: Dots_in_Column3 = abs(Number_of_Sides - Dots_in_Column2)
    3.  We apply this rule to Row 3 to find the number of dots in the missing cell.
