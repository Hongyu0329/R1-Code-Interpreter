    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find a point in the pattern around which we can rotate it by a certain angle (less than 360 degrees) so that the tiling looks exactly the same as it did before the rotation.\n\n1.  **Identify a repeating motif:** Let's focus on the star-like shapes that appear throughout the pattern. These are prominent and repeating features.\n\n2.  **Choose a center of rotation:** The most natural center of rotation to test is the very center of one of these star shapes, where the points of several rhombus-like shapes meet.\n\n3.  **Count the \"folds\" of symmetry:** Observe the star shape. It is composed of 5 identical \"arms\" or rhombus-like shapes (colored yellow and orange). If you were to rotate the entire image around the center of this star, the pattern would align perfectly with its original state every time one arm moves to the position of the next.\n\n4.  **Calculate the rotation angle:** Since there are 5 identical arms that make up a full 360-degree circle around the center point, the pattern has 5-fold rotational symmetry. This means it remains unchanged after a rotation of 360 / 5 = 72 degrees.\n\nThis type of pattern is known as a Penrose tiling, which is famous for exhibiting 5-fold rotational symmetry, something impossible in a regular, periodic crystal.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this observation.\n\n```python\ndef find_rotational_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning for determining the rotational symmetry of the given tiling.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of identical segments (the 'arms' of the star) around a central point.\n    # By observing the star-like motifs in the tiling, we can count 5 identical arms.\n    n_fold_symmetry = 5\n    \n    # The total degrees in a full circle.\n    full_circle_degrees = 360\n    \n    # The smallest angle of rotation that leaves the pattern unchanged.\n    angle_of_rotation = full_circle_degrees / n_fold_symmetry\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Identify a central point for rotation in the tiling. The center of the star-like motifs is a suitable point.\")\n    print(f\"Step 2: Count the number of times the pattern repeats in a full 360-degree rotation around this point. We can see {n_fold_symmetry} identical 'arms' forming the star.\")\n    print(f\"Step 3: The order of rotational symmetry is equal to this count, which is {n_fold_symmetry}.\")\n    print(f\"Step 4: This means a rotation of {full_circle_degrees} / {n_fold_symmetry} = {int(angle_of_rotation)} degrees leaves the tiling unchanged.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the rotational symmetry of the tiling is 5.\")\n\nfind_rotational_symmetry()\n```\n<<<5>>>"
