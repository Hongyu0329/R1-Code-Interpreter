def solve_reaction_diffusion_puzzle():
  """
  Analyzes the provided plots for a reaction-diffusion system and determines the parameter
  changes for each simulation based on the visual evidence.

  The analysis steps are as follows:
  1. Identify Plot 2 as the baseline (Code '0').
  2. Compare each plot to the baseline to deduce the change in Diffusion (D/d), Rate Constant (K/k), or Reaction Order (N/n).
  
  - Plot 1: Steeper gradients and slower time evolution compared to Plot 2 indicate slower transport.
    Result: Halved diffusion coefficient (d).
  - Plot 2: This is the reference simulation.
    Result: Initial parameter set (0).
  - Plot 3: Much faster depletion of reactant A and faster production of product B indicate a faster reaction.
    Result: Doubled rate constant (K).
  - Plot 4: Slower reaction, shown by higher reactant concentration and slower product formation.
    Result: Halved rate constant (k).
  - Plot 5: Flatter gradients and a faster approach to steady state indicate faster transport.
    Result: Doubled diffusion coefficient (D).
  - Plot 6: Severely slowed reaction, indicated by very slow product formation. This effect is consistent with increasing the reaction order 'n' while the concentration 'c_A' is less than 1.
    Result: Doubled reaction order (N).
