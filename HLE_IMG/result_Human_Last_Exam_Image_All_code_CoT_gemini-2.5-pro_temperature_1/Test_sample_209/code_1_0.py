    This function solves the giraffe identification task.

    Analysis Steps:
    1.  Examine the target giraffe's coat pattern, focusing on the shoulder and neck area.
    2.  Identify a unique cluster of spots: a large spot above the shoulder, a smaller one above it, and a distinctive 'Y' or 'fork' shape to the right.
    3.  Compare this specific pattern with all the options (A, B, C, D, E, F).
    4.  The pattern is absent in options A, C, D, E, and F.
    5.  The pattern in option B is a precise match to the target image's pattern.
    6.  Therefore, B is the correct image.
