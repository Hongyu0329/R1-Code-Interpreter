    "This image displays a typical North Atlantic rocky intertidal community. Several species are visible, including acorn barnacles and at least two types of periwinkle snails.\n\n1.  **Identify the organisms:** The most prominent organisms are the numerous acorn barnacles (*Semibalanus balanoides*), and several snails.\n2.  **Focus on the snails:** There are large, light-colored snails and smaller, darker ones. The larger snails, with their solid, conical shells, are identifiable as the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*.\n3.  **Determine the geographic distribution:** The Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*) is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean (Europe) and was introduced to the northwestern Atlantic (North America) in the 19th century, where it is now extremely common. While it has been found in a few isolated locations on the Pacific coast (as a non-native introduction), it is not widespread there. Its presence in this type of dense, mixed-species assemblage is overwhelmingly characteristic of the North Atlantic coast.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, the presence of *Littorina littorea* is a strong indicator that the photo was taken on a North Atlantic shore rather than a Pacific one.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the species that indicates the photo was taken on the Atlantic coast.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The most identifiable species in the image that is characteristic of the Atlantic coast\n    # and not the Pacific coast is the Common Periwinkle.\n    scientific_name = \"Littorina littorea\"\n    print(scientific_name)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
