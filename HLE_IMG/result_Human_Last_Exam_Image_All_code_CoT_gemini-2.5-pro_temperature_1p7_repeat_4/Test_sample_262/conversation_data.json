    "To determine which complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes, we need to analyze their chemical stability. The lifetime of these iridium complexes in light-emitting devices is often limited by their susceptibility to chemical degradation. A key factor influencing this stability is the structure of the ligands, particularly the cyclometalating C^N ligands (the phenylpyridine derivatives).\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Structures:** We will compare the four complexes, focusing on the differences in their C^N ligands. All four complexes share the same central iridium ion and the same ancillary N^N ligand (4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine). The variation is in the fluorination of the phenyl rings of the C^N ligands.\n2.  **Relate Structure to Stability:** In the field of organic electronics, it's well-established that introducing fluorine atoms to the phenyl ring of the C^N ligand, especially at the *ortho*-position (the position adjacent to the carbon atom bonded to iridium), significantly enhances the stability of the complex. This is due to two main effects:\n    *   **Steric Hindrance:** The ortho-fluorine atom physically blocks potential chemical attack on the vulnerable Ir-C bond.\n    *   **Electronic Effect:** Fluorine is highly electronegative and withdraws electron density, which strengthens the Ir-C bond.\n3.  **Identify the Least Stable Complexes:** Complexes that lack this ortho-fluorine protection are more prone to degradation and are therefore expected to have shorter operational lifetimes. A complex is only as stable as its weakest link; if even one of the C^N ligands lacks protection, the entire complex is vulnerable.\n4.  **Execute the Analysis with Code:** We will write a Python script that systematically evaluates each complex based on this principle to identify which ones are least stable.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_complex_stability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the stability of four iridium complexes based on ligand fluorination\n    to predict their relative lifetimes.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the properties of the cyclometalating (C^N) ligands present in the complexes.\n    # The key property for stability is the presence of an ortho-fluorine atom.\n    ligands = {\n        'ppy': {'name': '2-phenylpyridine', 'has_ortho_F': False},\n        'F-ppy': {'name': '2-(2\\'-fluorophenyl)pyridine', 'has_ortho_F': True},\n        'dfppy': {'name': '2-(2\\',4\\'-difluorophenyl)pyridine', 'has_ortho_F': True}\n    }\n\n    # Define the composition of each complex based on the provided image.\n    # Note: Complex 3 is heteroleptic (has two different C^N ligands).\n    # Note: Complex 4 appears identical to Complex 2 in the drawing.\n    complex_compositions = {\n        1: ['ppy', 'ppy'],\n        2: ['dfppy', 'dfppy'],\n        3: ['F-ppy', 'ppy'],\n        4: ['dfppy', 'dfppy']\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step Analysis:\\n\")\n    print(\"1.
