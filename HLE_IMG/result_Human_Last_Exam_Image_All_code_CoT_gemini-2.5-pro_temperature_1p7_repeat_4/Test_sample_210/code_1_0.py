def solve_nyala_identification():
    """
    This function solves the nyala re-identification task by analyzing key features.

    Method:
    1.  Identify unique, permanent features on the 'Target' nyala.
        - Horn Shape: The specific curvature and spiral of the horns.
        - Spot Pattern: The unique arrangement of white spots on the flank.
    2.  Compare these features with each of the options (A, B, C, D, E, F).
    3.  Eliminate non-matching individuals.
    4.  Conclude the correct match based on the strongest correspondence of features.

    Analysis:
    - Target: Has a distinct horn shape and a very specific cluster of white spots on its rear flank.
    - A, B, C, E, F: Differ from the target in horn shape, body size, or, most critically, the unique spot pattern.
    - D: Shows an identical horn shape and an exact match for the unique cluster of white spots on the flank.
