    "My plan is to identify the alkaloid shown in the image. I will analyze its key structural features, such as the number and type of rings, the presence of nitrogen atoms (making it an alkaloid), and any functional groups like the carbonyl group. By comparing these features to known alkaloid structures, particularly lupin alkaloids which share this core skeleton, I can determine its name. Finally, I will provide the name in a Python script as requested.\n\n```python\ndef identify_alkaloid():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the chemical compound from its structure.\n    \n    The structure is a tetracyclic alkaloid containing two nitrogen atoms\n    and a lactam (a cyclic amide, indicated by the C=O group in the ring).\n    This specific ring system and functional group arrangement is characteristic\n    of the lupin alkaloid known as Lupanine.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    compound_name = \"Lupanine\"\n    print(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n\nidentify_alkaloid()\n```\n<<<Lupanine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
