    "Based on the visual evidence, the process depicted is **clamp connection formation** in a basidiomycete fungus.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the images:\n1.  **Image L:** This panel shows a fungal hypha, which is composed of elongated cells separated by septa (cross-walls). The arrowhead points to a septum between two cells.\n2.  **Image M:** A small, backward-pointing protrusion or hook begins to form near the septum indicated by the arrowhead. This is the initial stage of the clamp connection.\n3.  **Image N:** The hook has grown larger and is more pronounced, curving back towards the older, sub-apical cell.\n\nThis entire sequence illustrates the formation of a clamp connection, which is a unique structure in many basidiomycete fungi. Its function is to ensure that during cell division, each new daughter cell receives a pair of different nuclei, thus maintaining the dikaryotic state (n+n) of the hypha.\n\n```python\ndef explain_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  Explains the biological process shown in the image.\n  \"\"\"\n  process_name = \"clamp connection formation\"\n  organism_type = \"basidiomycete fungus\"\n  \n  description = (\n      f\"The image displays the process of {process_name}. \"\n      \"This is a characteristic feature of many {organism_type} species. \"\n      \"It is a mechanism to ensure that each new cell in a growing hypha \"\n      \"receives a set of two genetically distinct nuclei (a dikaryon) \"\n      \"following mitosis.\"\n  )\n  \n  # Step-by-step description based on the panels L, M, and N\n  steps = {\n      'L': \"A dikaryotic cell in the hypha is preparing to divide.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
