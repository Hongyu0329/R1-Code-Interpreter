    print("1. The primary difference between molecule N1 and M1 is the addition of a lateral methyl group to ring 1 in M1.")
    print("2. A methyl group adds steric bulk. Steric bulk hinders the free rotation of the ring and the molecule as a whole.")
    print("3. Slower, more hindered motion corresponds to a longer or increased relaxation time (Ï„).")

    print("2. The addition of a lateral methyl group increases the width of the molecule, making it less rod-like.")
    print("3. This increased bulk disrupts the ability of molecules to pack closely, which weakens the intermolecular forces that cause nematic ordering.")
    print("4. Weaker ordering means less thermal energy is needed to disrupt the nematic phase. Thus, the nematic-isotropic transition temperature (T_NI) is expected to decrease.")
