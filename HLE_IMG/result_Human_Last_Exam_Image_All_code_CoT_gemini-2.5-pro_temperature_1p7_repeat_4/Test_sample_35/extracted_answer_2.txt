The S100B protein binds to the extracellular V-C1-C2 domain of the RAGE receptor. It should be considered a prognostic marker because its over-expression directly correlates with the activation of pathways leading to neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration, which are indicative of disease progression and severity.
