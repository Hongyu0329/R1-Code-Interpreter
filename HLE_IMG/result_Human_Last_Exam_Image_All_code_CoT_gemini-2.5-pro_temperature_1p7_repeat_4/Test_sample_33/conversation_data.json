    "This is a complex task that requires analyzing a medical image. I will provide a Python script that systematically analyzes the features of the ECG to arrive at the correct diagnosis.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Identify Key ECG Features:** The script will first define and list the key characteristics observed in the provided ECG image. This includes Rhythm, Heart Rate, QRS complex duration, and QRS morphology.\n2.  **Evaluate Differential Diagnoses:** The script will then systematically evaluate each answer choice against the observed ECG features. It will explain why each potential diagnosis is or is not a good fit.\n3.  **Conclude the Diagnosis:** Based on the process of elimination and feature matching, the script will identify the most likely diagnosis.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg_diagnosis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ECG features to determine the most likely diagnosis from a given list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the observed features from the ECG image.\n    ecg_features = {\n        \"Rhythm\": \"Irregularly irregular\",\n        \"Heart Rate (approx.)\": 250,  # beats per minute\n        \"QRS Duration\": \"Wide (> 0.12s)\",\n        \"QRS Morphology\": \"Bizarre and variable from beat to beat\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- ECG Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"Observed Features:\")\n    for feature, value in ecg_features.items():\n        print(f\"- {feature}: {value}\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Evaluating Differential Diagnoses ---\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Evaluate each potential diagnosis.\n    \n    # B.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
