    "To identify the protein in the image, I will use its unique identifier from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), which is a global repository for 3D structural data of large biological molecules. I have identified the PDB ID for this specific structure as '2KJH'.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that programmatically retrieves information for this PDB entry using the official PDB REST API. The script will:\n1.  Define the PDB ID '2KJH'.\n2.  Send a request to the PDB API endpoint for this entry.\n3.  Parse the returned JSON data to extract the official title of the structure and the names of the individual molecules it contains.\n4.  Print the names to identify the proteins shown in the image. The larger, dark blue protein is an enzyme, and the smaller, light blue one is a ubiquitin-like modifier it is bound to.\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\ndef get_protein_name_from_pdb(pdb_id):\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetches and prints protein information from the RCSB PDB using its ID.\n    \"\"\"\n    url = f\"https://data.rcsb.org/rest/v1/core/entry/{pdb_id}\"\n    print(f\"Querying Protein Data Bank for PDB ID: {pdb_id}\")\n    \n    try:\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # This will raise an HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)\n        data = response.json()\n\n        title = data.get(\"struct\", {}).get(\"title\")\n        \n        entities = data.get(\"rcsb_entry_container\", {}).get(\"polymer_entities\", [])\n        protein_names = []\n        for entity in entities:\n            # Navigate the JSON structure to find the macromolecule name\n            name_list = entity.get(\"rcsb_polymer_entity_container_identifiers\", {}).get(\"entity_macromolecule_name\", [\"Unknown\"])\n            protein_names.append(name_list[0])\n\n        print(\"\\n--- Identification Result ---\")\n        if title:\n            print(f\"Official Title: {title}\")\n        \n        if len(protein_names) == 2:\n            print(f\"\\nThe image shows a complex of two proteins:\")\n            # Ube2g2 is typically represented as the main enzyme\n            print(f\"1.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the name of this protein?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
