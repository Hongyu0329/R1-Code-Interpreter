    # DIKW Model Analysis
    print("1. DIKW Model (Data -> Information -> Knowledge -> Wisdom):")
    print("   - Data: The 'VA Sales List' is raw data.")
    print("   - Information: Applying a 'VA Sales Script' and qualifying leads turns data into contextual information.")
    print("   - Knowledge: 'VA Deals' and 'Work Manuals' represent accumulated knowledge of what works.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This model is highly applicable as it maps directly to the flow of the sales pipeline from raw leads to successful outcomes.\n")

    # SECI Model Analysis
    print("2. SECI Model (Socialization, Externalization, Combination, Internalization):")
    print("   - This model focuses on converting knowledge types to improve organizational capability.")
    print("   - Tacit Knowledge: The personal skills of experienced salespeople.")
    print("   - Externalization: Documenting these skills to improve the 'VA Sales Script' and 'Work Manuals'.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This model is crucial for creating and improving the knowledge assets by capturing expertise from the best performers, which is a key goal.\n")

    # Bloom's Taxonomy Analysis
    print("3. Bloom's Taxonomy:")
    print("   - This is a framework for individual learning and educational objectives.")
    print("   - While useful for training a salesperson, it does not model an organizational system for managing knowledge.")
    print("   - Conclusion: Less suitable for designing a company-wide KM strategy compared to DIKW and SECI.\n")
    
    # Final Recommendation
    print("---------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Final Recommendation:")
    print("Both the DIKW and SECI models are highly relevant and complementary.")
    print(" - DIKW provides the structure for the flow of information in the sales process.")
    print(" - SECI provides the mechanism for creating and sharing knowledge within the team.")
    print("Therefore, using both models together offers the most comprehensive solution.")
