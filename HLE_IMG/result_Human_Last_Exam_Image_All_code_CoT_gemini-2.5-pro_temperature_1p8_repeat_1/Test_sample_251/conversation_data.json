    "My plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze ECG Parameters:** First, I will identify the key parameters from the ECG strip provided in the image. The most critical parameter is the paper speed, which is stated as 25 mm/sec.\n2.  **Understand the ECG Grid:** Standard ECG paper has a grid where each small square is 1 mm and each large square is 5 mm. With a speed of 25 mm/sec, 1 second of recording corresponds to 25 small squares (or 5 large squares). This means one small square (1 mm) represents 1/25 = 0.04 seconds, and one large square (5 mm) represents 5 * 0.04 = 0.2 seconds.\n3.  **Locate the Longest R-R Interval:** I will visually inspect the entire rhythm strip to find the largest distance between two consecutive R-waves (the prominent sharp peaks). There is a very clear, long pause in the fourth rhythm strip from the top. This will be the longest R-R interval.\n4.  **Measure the Interval:** I will measure the distance of this pause in terms of ECG grid squares. By carefully counting, the interval spans approximately 8 full large squares and 3 additional small squares.\n5.  **Calculate the Time:** I will convert this measured distance into time in seconds using the parameters from step 2. The total number of small squares is (8 large squares * 5 small squares/large square) + 3 small squares = 43 small squares. The duration is then 43 squares * 0.04 seconds/square.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that performs this calculation and prints out each step of the process to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_longest_rr_interval():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG strip information.\n\n    The steps are:\n    1.
