  This function solves the flag puzzle.
  
  The image shows a flag with horizontal stripes in the order: Black, White, Red.
  While this was the flag of the historical German Empire, in modern flag quizzes,
  this pattern is often the inverted flag of Yemen.
  
  The flag of Yemen has horizontal stripes in the order: Red, White, Black.
  
  Assuming the puzzle uses the common trick of inverting the flag, the answer is Yemen.
