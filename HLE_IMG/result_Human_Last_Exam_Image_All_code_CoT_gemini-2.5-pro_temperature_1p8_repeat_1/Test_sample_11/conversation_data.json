    "The image displays the top-left corner of a flag with horizontal stripes. From top to bottom, the colors are black, white, and red.\n\nMy plan to identify the country is as follows:\n1.  Analyze the colors and their arrangement: The flag has horizontal stripes of Black, White, and Red.\n2.  Search for current national flags with this specific pattern. The historical flag of the German Empire (1871-1918) and Upper Volta (1959-1984) had this design, but these are not current countries.\n3.  Consider common variations in flag puzzles. The flag of Yemen is a horizontal tricolor with the stripes in the order of Red, White, and Black.\n4.  It's a common trick in these types of quizzes to show a flag upside down. The flag in the image is an inverted version of the flag of Yemen.\n5.  Therefore, the country is most likely Yemen.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_flag_puzzle():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function solves the flag puzzle.\n  \n  The image shows a flag with horizontal stripes in the order: Black, White, Red.\n  While this was the flag of the historical German Empire, in modern flag quizzes,\n  this pattern is often the inverted flag of Yemen.\n  \n  The flag of Yemen has horizontal stripes in the order: Red, White, Black.\n  \n  Assuming the puzzle uses the common trick of inverting the flag, the answer is Yemen.\n  \"\"\"\n  country_name = \"Yemen\"\n  print(country_name)\n\nsolve_flag_puzzle()\n```\n<<<Yemen>>>"
