def analyze_histograms():
    """
    Analyzes flow cytometry histograms to determine which antibodies stained all cells.

    In flow cytometry, if an antibody stains all cells in a population, the entire
    fluorescence distribution for the stained sample (red curve) will shift to a higher
    fluorescence compared to the unstained control (black curve). The resulting
    stained population should be unimodal (a single peak), indicating a homogenous shift.

    - A bimodal distribution in the stained sample, with one peak overlapping the
      control, indicates that only a sub-population was stained.
