    "To determine the stereochemical assignments for the stereocenters in the reaction, we will apply the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules to each chiral center.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reaction is an esterification between an acyl chloride and a secondary alcohol, using pyridine as a base. This type of reaction proceeds via nucleophilic acyl substitution. Crucially, the bonds to the chiral centers in both the acyl chloride and the alcohol are not broken during the reaction. Therefore, the stereochemistry of each stereocenter is retained in the product.\n2.  **Assign Stereocenter 1 (Acyl Chloride):**\n    *   The chiral carbon is bonded to: -C(=O)Cl, -C6H5 (phenyl), -CF3, and -OCH3.\n    *   **Priorities (by atomic number):**\n        1.  -OCH3 (Oxygen, Z=8)\n        2.  -C(=O)Cl (Carbon bonded to Cl, Z=17)\n        3.  -CF3 (Carbon bonded to F, Z=9)\n        4.  -C6H5 (Carbon bonded to C, Z=6)\n    *   **Assignment:** The lowest priority group (-C6H5, #4) is in the plane. The -OCH3 group (priority #1) is pointing back (dash). Looking down the bond to the priority #1 group, the remaining groups (2 -> 3 -> 4) trace a clockwise path. Since the priority #1 group (not #4) is pointing away, a clockwise path indicates an (R) configuration. Thus, the first stereocenter is **(R)**.\n\n3.  **Assign Stereocenter 2 (Alcohol):**\n    *   The chiral carbon is bonded to: -OH, -CH2OCH3, -CH2CH(CH3)2, and -H (implied).\n    *   **Priorities:**\n        1.  -OH (Oxygen, Z=8)\n        2.  -CH2OCH3 (C bonded to O)\n        3.  -CH2CH(CH3)2 (C bonded to C)\n        4.  -H (Hydrogen, Z=1)\n    *   **Assignment:** The lowest priority group (-H, #4) is pointing back (dash, implied). Tracing the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3 gives a counter-clockwise direction. Therefore, the second stereocenter is **(S)**.\n\n4.  **Assign Stereocenters 3 and 4 (Product):**\n    *   As established, the stereochemistry is retained for both chiral centers during the reaction.\n    *   Stereocenter 3 (from the acyl chloride) will remain **(R)**.\n    *   Stereocenter 4 (from the alcohol) will remain **(S)**.\n\nThe sequence of stereochemical assignments from left to right is therefore (R), (S), (R), (S). The following Python code will print this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the stereochemical assignments (R/S) for the four\n    stereocenters in the provided reaction scheme, moving from left to right.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Stereochemical assignment for the first reactant's stereocenter.\n    # Analysis:\n    # 1.
