# Define the given values from the circuit diagram
V2 = 1.0  # Voltage in Volts
R1 = 3.0  # Resistance in Ohms
R2 = 7.0  # Resistance in Ohms
R3 = 9.0  # Resistance in Ohms
R7 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms
R8 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms

# Step 1: Analyze the circuit and simplify.
print("Circuit Analysis:")
print(f"A wire connects the node above R1 (which is at {V2}V) to the node between R2 and R3.")
print("This means the voltage potential across the series combination of R1 and R2 is 0V.")
print("Therefore, no current flows through R1 and R2, and they are shorted out.")
print("The circuit simplifies to R3 in parallel with the series combination of (R7 + R8).\n")

# Step 2: Calculate the resistance of the series branch (R7 and R8).
R_78 = R7 + R8
print("Step 2: Calculate the resistance of the branch with R7 and R8.")
print(f"R_78 = R7 + R8 = {R7} Ω + {R8} Ω = {R_78} Ω\n")

# Step 3: Calculate the total equivalent resistance (Req).
# Req is R3 in parallel with R_78.
# 1/Req = 1/R3 + 1/R_78  => Req = (R3 * R_78) / (R3 + R_78)
Req = (R3 * R_78) / (R3 + R_78)
print("Step 3: Calculate the total equivalent resistance (Req).")
print(f"Req = (R3 * R_78) / (R3 + R_78) = ({R3} * {R_78}) / ({R3} + {R_78})")
print(f"Req = {R3 * R_78} / {R3 + R_78} = {Req:.4f} Ω\n")

# Step 4: Calculate the total current using Ohm's Law (I = V/R).
I_total = V2 / Req
print("Step 4: Calculate the total current (I_total).")
print(f"I_total = V2 / Req = {V2} V / {Req:.4f} Ω")
print(f"I_total = {I_total:.4f} A\n")

print(f"The total current flowing through the circuit is approximately {I_total:.4f} Amperes.")
