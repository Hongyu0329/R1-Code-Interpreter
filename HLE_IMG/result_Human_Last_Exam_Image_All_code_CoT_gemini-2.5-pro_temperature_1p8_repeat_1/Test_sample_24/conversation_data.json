    "This task requires identifying a three-manifold from its Heegaard diagram. This is a problem in low-dimensional topology. The solution involves deriving the fundamental group of the manifold from the diagram and then using classification theorems to identify the manifold.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Heegaard Diagram:** The provided image is a genus-3 Heegaard diagram. It has three `α`-curves (red circles) and three `β`-curves (blue loops). The manifold is constructed by gluing two genus-3 handlebodies along their boundaries according to the pattern of these curves.\n2.  **Derive the Fundamental Group:** The fundamental group, `π₁(M)`, of the manifold `M` can be read from the diagram.\n    *   There is one generator for each `α`-curve: `x₁, x₂, x₃`.\n    *   There is one relator (relation) for each `β`-curve. The relator is a word in the generators obtained by tracing the `β`-curve and recording its signed intersections with the `α`-curves.\n3.  **Trace the Relators:**\n    *   Let a crossing of `αᵢ` from \"outside\" to \"inside\" be represented by the generator `xᵢ`, and a crossing from \"inside\" to \"outside\" be `xᵢ⁻¹`.\n    *   Tracing `β₁` yields the relator `r₁ = x₃ * x₂⁻¹`.\n    *   Tracing `β₂` yields the relator `r₂ = x₁ * x₃⁻¹`.\n    *   Tracing `β₃` yields the relator `r₃ = x₂ * x₁⁻¹`.\n4.  **Simplify the Group Presentation:** The fundamental group is `π₁(M) = <x₁, x₂, x₃ | x₃x₂⁻¹=1, x₁x₃⁻¹=1, x₂x₁⁻¹=1>`.\n    *   The relations simplify to `x₃ = x₂`, `x₁ = x₃`, and `x₂ = x₁`.\n    *   This means all three generators are equal: `x₁ = x₂ = x₃`.\n    *   The group is therefore generated by a single element with no relations: `π₁(M) = <x> ≅ ℤ`, the infinite cyclic group.\n5.  **Identify the Manifold:** A major result in 3-manifold theory states that any closed, orientable 3-manifold whose fundamental group is `ℤ` must be homeomorphic to `S² × S¹` (the product of a 2-sphere and a circle). The Heegaard construction process results in an orientable manifold.\n\nThe following Python code will print this step-by-step deduction.\n\n```python\ndef solve_heegaard_diagram():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the given Heegaard diagram to identify the corresponding 3-manifold.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This program determines the 3-manifold represented by the Heegaard diagram.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the Heegaard diagram's structure.\n    genus = 3\n    print(f\"Step 1: Analyzing the Heegaard Diagram\")\n    print(f\"The diagram is a genus-{genus} Heegaard diagram.
