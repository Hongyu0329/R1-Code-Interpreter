    "This is a surrealist painting with many distinct elements, such as a room that opens up into multiple different landscapes (a glacier, the sea, a cityscape) and has books burning in the fireplace. This style is characteristic of a specific artist. By searching for \"surrealist painting room with different worlds\" or similar descriptions, I can identify the artist. The artist is well-known for creating these types of fantastical, multi-faceted worlds within a single scene. The painting is titled \"Amok\" (also known as \"Eruption of the Bibliotheca\").\n\nI will now write a python script to print the name of the artist.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the artist of the provided painting.\n    \"\"\"\n    artist_name = \"Jacek Yerka\"\n    print(f\"The artist of the painting is: {artist_name}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Jacek Yerka>>>"
