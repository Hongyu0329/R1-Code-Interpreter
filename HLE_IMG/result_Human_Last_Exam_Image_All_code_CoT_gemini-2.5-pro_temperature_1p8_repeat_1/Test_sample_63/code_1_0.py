print(f"This quartet-triplet pattern with a {peak_quartet_protons}:{peak_triplet_protons} proton ratio is a classic signature for two ethyl groups attached to a nitrogen atom, i.e., a diethylamino group -N(C2H5)2.\n")

print("Step 2: Evaluate the initial candidate structures.")
print("Candidates A-G and B-G both have a dimethylamino group, -N(CH3)2. This group would produce a single, sharp singlet peak for 6 protons, not a quartet and a triplet.")
print("Therefore, candidates A-G and B-G can be eliminated.\n")

print("Step 3: Differentiate between the remaining candidates, C-L and D-L.")
print("Both C-L and D-L contain the diethylamino group consistent with the spectrum.")
print("Let's look at the aromatic region and attached groups:")
print(f"- A singlet peak is observed around {peak_singlet_methyl_ppm} ppm, integrating to {peak_singlet_methyl_protons} protons. This signal corresponds to a methyl group attached to the aromatic ring.\n")

print("Analysis of C-L:")
print("Structure C-L has ONE methyl group on the aromatic ring. This predicts a singlet peak with an integration of 3 protons.")
print("This perfectly matches the observed signal at ~2.2 ppm.\n")

print("Analysis of D-L:")
print("Structure D-L has TWO methyl groups on the aromatic ring. This would result in two separate 3-proton singlets (as they are not in equivalent chemical environments) or one 6-proton singlet (if they were equivalent).")
print("The spectrum only shows one 3-proton singlet in this region, which contradicts the structure of D-L.\n")

print("Step 4: Final Conclusion.")
print("The presence of a diethylamino group and a single aromatic methyl group strongly indicates that the correct structure is C-L.")
print("The other peaks in the spectrum also match C-L: a 2H singlet at ~3.3 ppm (-CO-CH2-N), a 1H broad singlet for the amide NH at ~8.8 ppm, and the aromatic signals around 7 ppm.")
print("\nTherefore, the correct structure is C-L.")
