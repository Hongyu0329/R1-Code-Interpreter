# Based on the detailed step-by-step analysis of the physics and visual features.
# The core logic points are:
# 1. c=1 leads to instability, c<=0 is stable.
# 2. b determines symmetry, b>0 pushes positive, b<0 pushes negative.
# 3. d is a constant force, d>0 pushes positive, d<0 pushes negative.
# 4. Plot 15 (repulsion) is identified as C(0,1,0), which has a potential barrier at Phi=0.
# 5. Plot 3 (breather) is identified as c(0,-1,0), due to a strong restoring force.
# 6. Unstable plots (5, 12, 13) must have c=1.
# 7. Other plots are assigned based on their color bias (red/blue) and pattern complexity,
#    matching them to the effects of b and d parameters.
