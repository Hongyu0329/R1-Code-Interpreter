    "To identify the rock specimens, I will analyze their visual characteristics such as texture, color, and composition.\n\n1.  **Specimen H:** This rock is reddish and highly vesicular, meaning it's full of small holes created by gas bubbles escaping from lava. This texture is characteristic of an extrusive igneous rock. Based on its color and vesicular nature, it is identified as **Scoria**.\n2.  **Specimen I:** This specimen is composed of various angular rock fragments cemented together in a finer matrix. This texture is known as clastic. A rock made of large, angular fragments is called a **Breccia**. This could be a sedimentary breccia or a volcanic breccia (tuff).\n3.  **Specimen J:** This rock is light-colored and extremely vesicular, appearing porous and lightweight. Like H, it's an extrusive igneous rock. Its light color and high porosity are defining features of **Pumice**.\n4.  **Specimen K:** This rock exhibits very large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible. This coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture indicates it cooled slowly deep within the Earth's crust, making it an intrusive igneous rock. The presence of large light and dark-colored minerals is common in rocks like granite, but the exceptionally large crystal size specifically points to it being a **Pegmatite**.\n\nI will now write a Python script to output these identifications.\n\n```python\n#\n#\n# This script identifies the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n#\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the name of each rock specimen shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping specimen labels to their identified rock type.\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Breccia',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for label, rock_type in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {label}: {rock_type}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    identify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
