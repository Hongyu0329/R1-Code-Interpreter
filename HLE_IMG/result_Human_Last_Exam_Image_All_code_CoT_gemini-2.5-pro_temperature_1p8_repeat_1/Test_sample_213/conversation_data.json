    "This is a great music history question. Let's identify this piece step by step.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Score for Clues:**\n    *   **Instrumentation:** The instrument names are in German: \"gr. Fl.\" (grosse Fl√∂ten/Flutes), \"Hob.\" (Hoboen/Oboes), \"engl. Horn\" (English Horn), \"Fag.\" (Fagotte/Bassoons), \"Viol.\" (Violinen/Violins), \"Br.\" (Bratschen/Violas), and \"Celli\". This points to a German or Austrian composer.\n    *   **Musical Directions:** The word \"(Vorhang)\" is present. This is German for \"(Curtain)\". The number \"1\" next to it is a rehearsal mark. This, combined with the user's information that it \"opens the second act\", is a very strong clue. It means the curtain rises at this point in the music.\n    *   **Musical Style:** The music is highly chromatic, emotional, and uses a large orchestra. This style is characteristic of the High Romantic period, particularly the works of Richard Wagner or Richard Strauss.\n\n2.  **Synthesize and Search:**\n    *   We are looking for a famous German-language opera where the second act begins with this specific agitated and passionate music, at the moment the curtain rises.\n    *   By searching for the opening of Act II of major German operas from this period, we can find a match. The music for the prelude to Act II of Richard Wagner's opera *Tristan und Isolde* is a perfect match for the score provided. It famously begins with this turbulent passage representing the excitement and impatience of Isolde.\n\n3.  **Final Confirmation:** The music is indeed the opening of the prelude to Act II of *Tristan und Isolde* by Richard Wagner.\n\nI will now provide the answer in the requested Python format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_music_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the opera based on the provided sheet music.\n\n    1.  **Analyze Clues:** The score has German instrument names (\"Hob.\", \"Br.\", \"Vorhang\"), indicating a German-language opera.\n    2.  **Context:** The music is specified as the opening to Act II, with \"(Vorhang)\" meaning the curtain rises.\n    3.  **Identify Music:** The lush, chromatic, and urgent musical style is highly characteristic of Richard Wagner. A search for the score of the Act II Prelude of Wagner's operas confirms this music is from \"Tristan und Isolde\".\n    \"\"\"\n    opera_name = \"Tristan und Isolde\"\n    print(\"This sheet music is the opening of Act II from the opera by Richard Wagner.\")\n    print(f\"The name of the opera is: {opera_name}\")\n\nsolve_music_riddle()\n```\n<<<Tristan und Isolde>>>"
