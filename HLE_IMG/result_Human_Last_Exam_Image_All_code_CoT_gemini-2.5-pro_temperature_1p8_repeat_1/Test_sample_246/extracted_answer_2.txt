Yes, there is strong evidence of insect activity. The white, fuzzy sphere on the stem is an oak gall, which forms after a gall wasp lays its egg inside the plant's tissue (in this case, the stem). Therefore, the insect responsible for the gall lays its eggs within the plant's stems, buds, or leaves. Additionally, a different set of insect eggs can be seen on the underside of a leaf in one of the provided crops.
