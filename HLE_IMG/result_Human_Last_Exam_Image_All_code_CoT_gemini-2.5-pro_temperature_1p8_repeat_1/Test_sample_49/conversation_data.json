    "To determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$, we first need to find the Thevenin equivalent circuit as seen by the capacitor C. The cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$ (in radians per second) is given by the formula $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{eq}C}$, where $R_{eq}$ is the Thevenin equivalent resistance.\n\nHere is the plan to find $R_{eq}$:\n1.  **Simplify the circuit**: The capacitor C is connected between node $a_0$ and ground. To find the Thevenin equivalent resistance, we remove the capacitor and turn off all independent sources. The input source 'IN' at node $c_0$ is turned off by connecting $c_0$ to ground.\n2.  **Calculate Thevenin Resistance ($R_{eq}$)**: We need to find the resistance between node $a_0$ and ground. We can solve this by applying a test voltage $V_t$ at $a_0$ and calculating the current $I_t$ drawn from the test source. Then, $R_{eq} = V_t / I_t$.\n3.  **Solve the Network**: The infinite ladder structure can be analyzed using difference equations for the voltages at each node ($V_{ck}$ and $V_{dk}$). By solving these equations with the boundary conditions ($V_{c0}=0$, $V_{a0}=V_t$, and voltages decay to zero at infinity), we can find the relationship between $V_t$ and $I_t$.\n4.  **Determine Cutoff Frequency**: Once $R_{eq}$ is found in terms of `r`, we can substitute it back into the cutoff frequency formula.\n\nThe following Python code uses the symbolic math library `sympy` to carry out the derivation and present the final formula.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_cutoff_frequency():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function symbolically derives and prints the cutoff frequency for the given ladder network.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbols for the components and variables\n    r, C = sp.symbols('r C', real=True, positive=True)\n    Vt = sp.Symbol('Vt') # Test voltage\n    k = sp.Symbol('k', integer=True) # Node index\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the cutoff frequency formula\")\n    print(\"The cutoff angular frequency, omega_c, is given by:\")\n    print(\"omega_c = 1 / (R_eq * C)\")\n    print(\"where R_eq is the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor C.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Find the Thevenin Equivalent Resistance R_eq\")\n    print(\"We analyze the infinite resistive ladder with the input (c0) grounded and a test voltage Vt applied at node a0.\")\n    print(\"The node voltages V_ck and V_dk can be found by solving the network's difference equations.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe general solution for the node voltages that decay to zero at infinity is:\")\n    print(\"V_ck = A * (2 - sqrt(3))^k + B\")\n    print(\"V_dk = -A * (2 - sqrt(3))^k + B\")\n    print(\"\\nApplying boundary conditions V_c0 = 0 and V_d0 = Vt (at k=0) yields:\")\n    # A + B = 0  => B = -A\n    # -A + B = Vt => -2A = Vt => A = -Vt/2\n    # B = Vt/2\n    A_val = -Vt / 2\n    B_val = Vt / 2\n    print(f\"A = {A_val}, B = {B_val}\")\n\n    # Voltage expressions\n    lambda_decay = 2 - sp.sqrt(3)\n    V_dk_expr = -A_val * (lambda_decay**k) + B_val\n\n    # Calculate V_d0 and V_d1 to find the current It\n    V_d0 = V_dk_expr.subs(k, 0)\n    V_d1 = V_dk_expr.subs(k, 1)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe voltage at node d1 is:\")\n    print(f\"V_d1 = {sp.simplify(V_d1)}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe current It from the test source is It = (V_d0 - V_d1) / r:\")\n    It_expr = (V_d0 - V_d1) / r\n    print(f\"It = {sp.simplify(It_expr)}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe equivalent resistance R_eq = Vt / It is:\")\n    R_eq_expr = sp.simplify(Vt / It_expr)\n    print(f\"R_eq = {R_eq_expr}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Determine the Cutoff Frequency\")\n    print(\"Substituting R_eq into the formula omega_c = 1 / (R_eq * C):\")\n\n    # Deconstruct the expression for clean printing\n    coeff_term = R_eq_expr / r\n    parts = sp.Add.make_args(coeff_term)\n    num_1 = parts[0]\n    num_sqrt = parts[1]\n    radicand = num_sqrt.args[0]\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final equation for the cutoff angular frequency is:\")\n    final_equation = f\"omega_c = 1 / (({num_1} + sqrt({radicand})) * r * C)\"\n    print(final_equation)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe numbers in the final equation's coefficient are:\")\n    print(f\"1) The integer term: {num_1}\")\n    print(f\"2) The number under the square root: {radicand}\")\n\nsolve_cutoff_frequency()\n```\n<<<omega_c = 1 / ((1 + sqrt(3)) * r * C)>>>"
