    "The user wants me to identify the relationship between two molecules. However, the image provided is completely black, so the molecules are not visible. Without seeing the structures, I cannot determine if they are identical, conformers, constitutional isomers, or stereoisomers.\n\nTherefore, my plan is to provide a Python script that will act as a guide. This script will print a series of logical steps and questions that the user can follow to classify the molecules themselves once they have the correct visual information. This approach uses coding skills to solve the user's underlying problem of how to classify isomers, even with the faulty input.\n\n```python\ndef print_isomer_classification_guide():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints a step-by-step guide for classifying the relationship\n    between two chemical molecules.
