    # Option B: Strong candidate, spot and stripe patterns look similar.
    # Option C: Poor image quality and angle make it hard to confirm key spot patterns.
    # Option D: Horn shape, stripe pattern, and the crucial spot cluster on the flank are an identical match to the target.
    # Option E: Leg marking (scar?) and different spot pattern suggest it's another animal.
    # Option F: Key features are obscured by foliage.

    # Final decision is based on the most definitive evidence.
    # The unique pattern of spots on the flank acts like a fingerprint.
    # This pattern is clearly visible and identical in the Target and Option D.
