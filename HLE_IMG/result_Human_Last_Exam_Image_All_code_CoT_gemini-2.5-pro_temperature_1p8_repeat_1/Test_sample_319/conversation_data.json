    "The image you provided illustrates a well-known auditory illusion. The top panel is a spectrogram and the bottom panel is the corresponding waveform.\n\n1.  **Spectrogram Analysis**: The spectrogram shows a continuous pure tone (the single horizontal line) that is briefly interrupted. During this interruption, a burst of broadband noise occurs (the vertical smear).\n2.  **Waveform Analysis**: The waveform shows a perfect sine wave (representing the pure tone), which is then replaced by a complex, noisy signal, and then the sine wave seemingly resumes.\n3.  **The Illusion**: Although the pure tone is physically absent during the noise burst, a human listener will perceive the tone as continuing uninterrupted *through* the noise. The brain \"fills in\" the missing auditory information. This is a common perceptual ability that helps us understand speech and other sounds in noisy environments.\n4.  **Naming the Phenomenon**: This effect is known as the **Auditory continuity illusion**. A specific instance of this involving speech sounds is called the **phonemic restoration effect**.\n\nTo provide the answer in the requested format, here is a Python script that prints the name of the phenomenon.\n\n```python\ndef get_phenomenon_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  Identifies the name of the auditory illusion depicted in the image.\n\n  The image shows a pure tone interrupted by a burst of noise.\n  Listeners typically perceive the tone as continuing through the noise,\n  an illusion the brain creates by \"filling in\" the missing sound.\n  \"\"\"\n  return \"Auditory continuity illusion\"\n\n# Print the name of the phenomenon.\nphenomenon_name = get_phenomenon_name()\nprint(f\"The name of the phenomenon shown in the image is: {phenomenon_name}\")\n\n```\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion>>>"
