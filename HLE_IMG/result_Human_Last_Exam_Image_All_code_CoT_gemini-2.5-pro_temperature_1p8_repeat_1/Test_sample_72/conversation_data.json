    "This is a multi-step photochemical transformation. I will identify the two pericyclic reactions involved based on the principles of organic photochemistry.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Analyze the starting materials, hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene, and the overall transformation under photochemical conditions (hv).\n2.  Propose a chemically reasonable two-step reaction mechanism, noting that the problem states two pericyclic reactions are involved. The most common photochemical pathway for substituted benzenes involves initial isomerization to a valence isomer.\n3.  The first step is the photochemical valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to hexafluoro-Dewar benzene. I will classify this pericyclic reaction based on the number of pi electrons involved (4π) and the reaction type (electrocyclization).\n4.  The second step is the reaction of the highly strained and reactive hexafluoro-Dewar benzene with cyclobutene. This is a cycloaddition reaction. I will classify it based on the number of pi electrons from each component ([2+2]) and the reaction type (cycloaddition).\n5.  Finally, I will write a Python script that prints out the names of these two reactions, including the numbers (4, 2, 2) that characterize them, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_organic_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and describes the two pericyclic reactions in the given photochemical transformation.\n    The overall reaction is hexafluorobenzene + cyclobutene --(hv)--> product.\n    This process occurs in two distinct photochemically allowed steps.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: The first pericyclic reaction is the photoisomerization of hexafluorobenzene.\n    # It converts to its valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene.\n    # This reaction involves 4 pi electrons from the benzene ring forming two new sigma bonds.\n    reaction1_name = \"electrocyclization\"\n    reaction1_electrons = 4\n\n    # Step 2: The second pericyclic reaction is the cycloaddition of the intermediate\n    # hexafluoro-Dewar benzene with cyclobutene.\n    # This involves a 2 pi electron system from Dewar benzene and a 2 pi electron system from cyclobutene.\n    reaction2_name = \"cycloaddition\"\n    reaction2_electrons_a = 2\n    reaction2_electrons_b = 2\n\n    # The prompt requests that the final output includes the numbers from the \"final equation\".\n    # Here, these numbers are the electron counts that define the pericyclic reactions.\n    \n    print(\"The transformation involves two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions:\")\n    print(f\"1.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur in this transformation.
