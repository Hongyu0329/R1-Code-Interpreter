    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find the largest number of times the pattern can be rotated around a central point within a 360-degree turn and still look identical to the original.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking:**\n1.  **Identify repeating elements and potential centers of rotation.** The tiling is made of distinct shapes: dark blue hexagons, light yellow squares, and orange rhombuses. The centers of the most regular shapes are good candidates for centers of rotation. Let's focus on the center of one of the dark blue hexagons.\n2.  **Test the rotational symmetry around the center of a hexagon.** A regular hexagon has 6 sides of equal length. By itself, it has 6-fold rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after rotations of 60, 120, 180, 240, and 300 degrees (multiples of 360/6 = 60 degrees).\n3.  **Verify if the entire pattern conforms to this symmetry.** Let's observe the shapes surrounding the central hexagon. Six squares and six rhombuses are arranged symmetrically around it. If we rotate the entire tiling by 60 degrees about the center of the hexagon, each surrounding shape and tile moves exactly into the position of an identical tile.\n4.  **Conclusion.** Since the entire pattern maps onto itself after a rotation of 60 degrees, it possesses 6-fold rotational symmetry. While there are other centers of rotation (e.g., 4-fold at the center of the squares), the question asks for *the* rotational symmetry, which typically refers to the highest order present in the pattern. The highest order is 6.\n\nI will now write a Python code to explain this process and state the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rotational_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the steps to find the rotational symmetry of the given tiling.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the repeating pattern in the tiling.\")\n    print(\"The tiling is composed of regular hexagons, squares, and rhombuses.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Identify a potential center of rotation.\")\n    print(\"A good candidate is the center of a regular polygon, like one of the dark blue hexagons.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Determine the order of rotation for that center.\")\n    print(\"A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides.
