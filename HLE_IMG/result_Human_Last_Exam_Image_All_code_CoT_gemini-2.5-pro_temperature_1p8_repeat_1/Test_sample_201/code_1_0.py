    This script analyzes the provided tectonic plate map to answer the user's question.

    Step-by-step reasoning:
    1.  The question asks to identify the plate boundary that would likely have the 'longest range of the tallest mountains'.
    2.  Based on Earth geology, the tallest and most extensive mountain ranges (like the Himalayas) are formed at 'convergent boundaries' where continental plates collide.
    3.  On the map, convergent boundaries are marked with red lines and arrows pointing towards each other.
    4.  We must examine the answer choices to find the longest continuous red line between two plates.

    Analysis of Options:
    - A. Kihei & South Avalonia: Convergent, but shorter than other options.
    - B. South Avalonia & South Kesh: No direct boundary.
    - C. North Tethys & South Tethys: Divergent boundary (blue line).
    - D. South Kesh & Eurybian: Convergent, but short.
    - E. Brigantic & Boreal: Convergent, but appears shorter than option I.
    - F. Central Iapetus & Artemian: Convergent, but short.
    - G. Artemian & Eurybian: A mixed boundary, not purely convergent.
    - H. Goidelic & Central Iapetus: Divergent boundary (blue line).
    - I. North Tethys & Brigantic: This is a very long, continuous convergent boundary (red line) between two continental masses (shaded areas). This condition is ideal for creating a long and tall mountain range.

    Conclusion: The boundary between the North Tethys Plate and the Brigantic Plate is the most likely location.
