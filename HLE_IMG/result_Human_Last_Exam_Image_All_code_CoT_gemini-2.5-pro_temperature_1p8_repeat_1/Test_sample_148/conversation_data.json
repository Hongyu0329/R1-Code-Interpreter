    "This is a medical diagnosis question based on a pathology image. I will not be providing a code block as it is not applicable to solving this kind of problem. I will provide a medical interpretation of the image provided.\n\n**Analysis of the Case:**\n\n1.  **Clinical Presentation:** The patient is a 28-year-old female with a mass in the sella turcica. The sella turcica is the location of the pituitary gland. The most common neoplasm in this location, particularly in an adult, is a pituitary adenoma.\n\n2.  **Microscopic Examination (Crush Smear):**\n    *   The image displays clusters of cells with a syncytial appearance (poorly defined cell borders).\n    *   The cells are relatively monotonous, meaning they look similar to each other.\n    *   The nuclei are round to oval, with a stippled or granular chromatin pattern, classically described as \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin. This nuclear feature is characteristic of neuroendocrine tumors.\n    *   The cytoplasm is moderate in amount, eosinophilic (pink), and granular.\n    *   The background contains finely granular material, consistent with fragile cytoplasm that has been stripped from the nuclei during the smear preparation, a common finding in pituitary adenoma crush preparations.\n\n**Differential Diagnosis:**\n*   **Pituitary Adenoma:** The features described above—monotonous cells, \"salt-and-pepper\" nuclei, granular cytoplasm, and syncytial arrangement, combined with the sellar location—are all classic for a pituitary adenoma.\n*   **Craniopharyngioma:** Would typically show features like calcification, \"wet keratin\" (anucleated squamous cells), and palisading basaloid cells, which are not seen here.\n*   **Meningioma:** Would be expected to show whorls, syncytial formations, and intranuclear pseudoinclusions. The nuclear features are different.\n*   **Germinoma:** Usually composed of large cells with prominent nucleoli and a background of lymphocytes. This does not match the image.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of clinical information and the cytomorphological features on the crush smear are pathognomonic for a pituitary adenoma.\n\n<<<Pituitary adenoma>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
