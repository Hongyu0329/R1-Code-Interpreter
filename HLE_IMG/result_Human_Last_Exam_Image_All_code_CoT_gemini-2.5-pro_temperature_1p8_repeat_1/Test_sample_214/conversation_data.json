    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the poetic form.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the information provided in the prompt and the image. The key clues are the text fragments from the poem, the artist's general work, and the line numbers mentioned. The prompt states this is the third line of a four-line stanza and gives the text of a line from a related poem.\n\nSecond, I will count the syllables of the provided lines of poetry. This is crucial as many poetic forms are defined by their syllabic structure.\n\nThird, I will use this syllabic evidence, combined with external knowledge about the artist's work, to identify the specific poetic form. The artist, Mary Ruefle, is well-known for using a particular form in the collection this work belongs to. I will show how the syllable counts fit the pattern of this form, even if some details in the prompt (like the \"four-line stanza\") seem contradictory.\n\nFinally, the Python script will automate the syllable counting for the phrases I identify, display the calculation, and print the name of the poetic form based on its characteristic syllabic structure.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided poetic text to determine its form.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the poetic form based on the provided information...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # The prompt mentions the artist's work is an erasure poem sequence.\n    # The source is Mary Ruefle's \"A Little White Shadow\", a series of erasures\n    # known to follow the Tanka form.
