# The puzzle is to move the red piece to the top-left corner.
# Let's analyze the moves required based on the obstacles.

# 1. Identify the pieces that need to be moved to clear the path.
# - The gray piece at the top-left destination.
# - The large yellow piece blocking the upward path.
# - The small yellow piece blocking the leftward path.
num_obstacles_to_move = 3

# 2. Identify the moves for the red piece itself.
# To get from its starting position (bottom-right area) to the top-left,
# it needs to move up and left.
# Assuming unit steps, it needs to move up 2 units and left 2 units.
moves_up = 2
moves_left = 2
num_red_piece_moves = moves_up + moves_left

# 3. Calculate the total minimum moves.
# The principle of this solution is that we must first move each of the
# blocking pieces (1 move per piece), and then move the red piece into place.
total_moves = num_obstacles_to_move + num_red_piece_moves
