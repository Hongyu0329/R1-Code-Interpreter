# --- Step 1: Define the parameters for the missing simulation ---

# The initial degree of polymerization, N, is 20, as seen from the plots.
N = 20

# The missing simulation corresponds to the linear polymer with m=4.
m = 4

# --- Step 2: Calculate the degree of destruction, a ---

# The degree of destruction 'a' is given by the formula a = m/25.
a = m / 25

# --- Step 3: Calculate the number-average degree of polymerization, N_n ---

# For a linear polymer undergoing random chain scission, the formula for N_n is:
# N_n = N / (1 + a * (N - 1))

N_n = N / (1 + a * (N - 1))

# --- Step 4: Print the calculation steps and the final answer ---
