    "My plan is to identify the jazz standard by analyzing its key characteristics from the sheet music provided.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Key and Form:** The key signature has four flats, and the first chord is F minor (F-), indicating the piece is in F minor. The structure, with a repeating A section and a contrasting B section (bridge), appears to be AABA, which is a very common form for jazz standards from the bebop era.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chord Progression:** I will examine the chord progression, especially of the bridge (the B section), as it's often the most unique part of a tune.\n    *   The A section begins `F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7 | C7 ...`\n    *   The bridge begins `D-7b5 | G7 | C7 | F7 | Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab ...`\n    This sequence of ii-V progressions and cycling dominants in the bridge is highly characteristic of the compositions of Tadd Dameron and is a significant clue.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Melody:** The melodic line starts on F and has a distinctive bebop character, full of eighth notes and chromaticism.\n\n4.  **Synthesize Clues:** The combination of the F minor tonality, the AABA form, and the specific harmonic movements in the bridge strongly points to the tune **\"Hot House\"**, composed by **Tadd Dameron**. \"Hot House\" is a famous contrafact written over the chord changes of Cole Porter's \"What Is This Thing Called Love?\", and this lead sheet represents a common, though slightly unique, arrangement of the tune.\n\nI will now write a simple Python script to print the identified title and composer.\n\n```python\n# Analysis of the provided musical lead sheet.\n# The chord progression, especially in the bridge (B section),\n# and the overall AABA form are characteristic of a specific bebop-era jazz standard.\n# The bridge features a series of descending ii-V and dominant chords, a hallmark\n# of the composer's style.\n\ntitle = \"Hot House\"\ncomposer = \"Tadd Dameron\"\n\nprint(f\"The title of the jazz standard is: {title}\")\nprint(f\"The composer is: {composer}\")\n```\n<<<Title: Hot House, Composer: Tadd Dameron>>>"
