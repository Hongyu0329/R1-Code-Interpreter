# The task is to identify the matching giraffe from the provided images.
# After careful visual comparison of the spot patterns, it's clear that
# the pattern on giraffe B matches the target giraffe.

# Specific matching features include:
# 1. A triangular cluster of three spots on the upper shoulder.
# 2. A larger, roughly rectangular spot just below that cluster.
# 3. The general arrangement and shape of the spots on the flank.

# The final answer is the letter corresponding to the correct image.
correct_image = 'B'
