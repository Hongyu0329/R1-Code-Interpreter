    This function explains and provides the known answer to the number of
    non-isomorphic cycle double covers (CDCs) for the Petersen Graph.
    
    A cycle double cover of a graph is a collection of cycles where each
    edge of the graph is part of exactly two cycles. Finding these and
    classifying them up to isomorphism (i.e., finding structurally
    unique covers) is a non-trivial problem in graph theory.

    The Petersen Graph is a well-known graph with 10 vertices and 15 edges.
