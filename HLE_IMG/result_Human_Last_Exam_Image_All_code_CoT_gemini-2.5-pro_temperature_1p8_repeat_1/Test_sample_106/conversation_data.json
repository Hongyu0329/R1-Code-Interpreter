    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the substituents at the numbered positions in the product molecule:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Reaction:** The starting material is a complex pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol. It reacts with catalytic acid (HCl) at high temperature (110 Â°C). This suggests an acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction, followed by a series of carbocation rearrangements known as Wagner-Meerwein or \"backbone\" rearrangements. Water is eliminated as a byproduct.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Product Structure:** The product is a pentacyclic alkene with the formula C30H50. A new double bond has been formed deep within the carbon skeleton, which is characteristic of a backbone rearrangement. The problem asks to identify the substituents (either a hydrogen atom, H, or a methyl group, CH3) at five specific locations marked with numbers 1 through 5.\n\n3.  **Identify Each Substituent Visually:** We will examine each numbered position in the final product molecule as drawn in the image. In chemical line-angle formulas, a line represents a bond, and if a line extends to an unlabeled terminus, it is assumed to be a methyl (CH3) group. If a line simply indicates a bond to a hydrogen atom, the 'H' symbol may be omitted, but here, wedges and dashes without a group explicitly drawn represent hydrogens.\n\n    *   **Position 1:** This number points to the lower methyl group of the gem-dimethyl group on the far-left ring (Ring A). It is a **CH3** group.\n    *   **Position 2:** This number points to the substituent at the junction of the B and C rings. It is depicted as a line pointing upwards from the ring fusion, which represents a **CH3** group.\n    *   **Position 3:** This number points to a substituent on the C/D ring system, shown with a dashed bond (pointing away). Since there is no \"C\" or \"CH3\" label, it represents a **H** atom.\n    *   **Position 4:** This number points to the substituent at the junction of the C and D rings. It is depicted as a line pointing upwards, representing a **CH3** group.\n    *   **Position 5:** This number points to a substituent on Ring D, shown with a wedged bond (pointing forward). Similar to position 3, the absence of a carbon label indicates it is a **H** atom.\n\n4.  **Format the Output:** Based on the visual analysis, we will format the answer as requested and generate Python code to print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rearrangement():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the substituents at the five specified\n    positions in the product of the chemical rearrangement.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The substituents are identified by visually inspecting the product molecule.\n    # In chemical drawings, a line without a specific atomic label at its end\n    # represents a methyl group (CH3). A bond shown without any label represents a hydrogen atom (H).\n    substituents = {\n        1: \"CH3\",\n        2: \"CH3\",\n        3: \"H\",\n        4: \"CH3\",\n        5: \"H\"\n    }\n\n    # Print the answer in the required format.\n    for position, substituent in substituents.items():\n        print(f\"{position} = {substituent}\")\n\nsolve_rearrangement()\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
