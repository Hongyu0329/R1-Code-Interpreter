    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the two-dimensional pattern created by projecting the atoms of a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice along the [110] direction.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Define the FCC Structure**: An FCC lattice has atoms at the corners of a cube and at the center of each of its six faces. We can describe all atom positions by taking four basis atoms and translating them by integer multiples of the lattice vectors. Let the lattice constant be `a`. The basis atoms in a conventional unit cell (with one corner at the origin) are at coordinates (0,0,0), (a/2, a/2, 0), (a/2, 0, a/2), and (0, a/2, a/2).\n\n2.  **Define the Projection**: Viewing along the [110] direction means we are projecting the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to the vector `v = [1, 1, 0]`.\n    *   The axes of our 2D projection plane can be chosen as vectors orthogonal to `v` and to each other. A convenient choice is `u₁ = [1, -1, 0]` and `u₂ = [0, 0, 1]`.\n    *   Any atom at a 3D position `p = (x, y, z)` will be projected to a 2D coordinate `(c₁, c₂)` where `c₁` is the projection onto `u₁` and `c₂` is the projection onto `u₂`.\n    *   `c₁` is proportional to `x - y`.\n    *   `c₂` is proportional to `z`.\n    *   The projection results in a 2D lattice. It can be shown that this 2D lattice is a **centered rectangular** lattice. The unit cell of this projected pattern is a rectangle with side lengths `a√2` and `a`, and it contains one atom at a corner and one at its center.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Images**: We need to find which image (A, B, C, or D) displays a centered rectangular pattern.\n    *   **Image A**: Shows a simple rectangular pattern. The atoms are arranged in rows and columns without any atoms in the centers of the rectangles.\n    *   **Image B**: This image shows a pattern where atoms form parallelograms (rectangles viewed in perspective), and there is an additional atom in the center of each parallelogram. This matches the description of a centered rectangular pattern.\n    *   **Image C**: This shows a simple rectangular pattern, similar to A but less dense.\n    *   **Image D**: This shows a more complex pattern, which appears to be two interlocking rectangular grids. It is not a standard centered rectangular lattice.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: Image B is the only one that represents a centered rectangular lattice, which is the characteristic projection of an FCC structure along the [110] direction.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this by projecting the atoms of a unit cell and identifying the points that form a single centered rectangular unit.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_fcc_projection_pattern():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the projected coordinates of FCC atoms viewed along the [110] direction\n    to demonstrate the resulting centered rectangular pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define atoms in an FCC conventional unit cell (lattice constant a=1)\n    # These are 8 corners and 6 face centers.\n    atoms_3d = [\n        # Corners\n        (0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1),\n        (1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1),\n        # Face Centers\n        (0.5, 0.5, 0), (0.5, 0, 0.5), (0, 0.5, 0.5),\n        (1, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 1, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 1)\n    ]\n\n    # For a [110] view, the 2D projected coordinates are based on (x-y) and z.\n    # We select a set of atoms that form one rectangular unit in the projection.\n    \n    # These four atoms form the corners of a rectangle in the projection.\n    rect_corners_3d = [(0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (1, 0, 1)]\n    \n    # This atom projects to the center of the above rectangle.\n    center_atom_3d = (0.5, 0, 0.5)\n\n    print(\"The projection of an FCC lattice along [110] results in a centered rectangular pattern.\")\n    print(\"Here are the 3D coordinates of atoms forming one such unit, and their 2D projection.\")\n    print(\"The 2D projection is calculated as (x-y, z).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Rectangle Corner Atoms:\")\n    for atom in rect_corners_3d:\n        x, y, z = atom\n        proj_x = x - y\n        proj_y = z\n        print(f\"  Atom at ({x}, {y}, {z}) projects to ({proj_x:.1f}, {proj_y:.1f})\")\n\n    print(\"\\nCentering Atom:\")\n    x, y, z = center_atom_3d\n    proj_x = x - y\n    proj_y = z\n    print(f\"  Atom at ({x:.1f}, {y:.1f}, {z:.1f}) projects to ({proj_x:.1f}, {proj_y:.1f})\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThis set of projected points forms a rectangle with corners at (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1) and a centering point at (0.5, 0.5).\")\n    print(\"This confirms the 'centered rectangular' nature of the pattern.\")\n    print(\"\\nVisually, image B is the only one showing a centered pattern.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, B is the correct answer.\")\n\nget_fcc_projection_pattern()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
