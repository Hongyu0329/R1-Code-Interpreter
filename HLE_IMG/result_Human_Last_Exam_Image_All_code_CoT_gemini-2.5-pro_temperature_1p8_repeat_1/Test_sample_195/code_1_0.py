def solve_equation():
    """
    This function formulates and prints the equation for f(x) based on graphical analysis.
    
    Analysis:
    1.  Vertical Asymptotes at x=a and x=c => Denominator has factors (x-a) and (x-c).
    2.  x-intercepts at x=-b, x=d, x=b => Numerator has factors (x+b), (x-b), and (x-d).
    3.  Slant Asymptote y=x exists. This happens when the degree of the numerator is one more than the denominator.
        The equation of the slant asymptote is the quotient of the numerator divided by the denominator.
        Let f(x) = (x^2 - b^2)(x-d) / ((x-a)(x-c)).
        Numerator: x^3 - d*x^2 - b^2*x + b^2*d
        Denominator: x^2 - (a+c)x + ac
        Long division gives the quotient (the slant asymptote) as y = x + (a+c-d).
    4.  From the graph, the slant asymptote passes through the origin, so its y-intercept is 0.
        Therefore, a+c-d = 0, which means d = a+c.
    5.  Substituting d = a+c into the function gives the final equation.
