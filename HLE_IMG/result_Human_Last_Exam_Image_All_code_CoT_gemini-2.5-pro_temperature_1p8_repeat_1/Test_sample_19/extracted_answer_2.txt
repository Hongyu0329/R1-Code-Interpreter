1. The music modulates to the key of **E Major**.

2. The original key of the piece is C# minor. **E Major is the relative major of C# minor**. They share the same 4-sharp key signature. Modulation to the relative major is a very common and natural-sounding progression in tonal music, often used to move from a minor-key first theme to a major-key second theme in sonata form.

3. The chord on the first beat of measure 11 contains the notes B (in the bass), D#, and F-double-sharp. This is a B augmented triad. In the new key of E Major, B is the dominant (the fifth scale degree). An augmented triad built on the dominant is labeled with a plus sign. Therefore, the complete and accurate Roman numeral marking is **V+**.
