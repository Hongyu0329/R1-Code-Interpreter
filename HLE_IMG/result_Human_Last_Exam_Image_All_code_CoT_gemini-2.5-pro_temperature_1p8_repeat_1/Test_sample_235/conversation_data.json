    "An erasure poem's metric pattern is often determined by the words chosen from the original text and how they are arranged. To solve this, I will first identify the complete line of text in the poem, then systematically analyze its metrical properties, specifically its syllable count and stress pattern. I will compare these properties against the definitions of the provided answer choices to find the correct match.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Transcribe the words of the erasure poem into a single line of text.\n2.  Count the number of syllables for each word and calculate the total number of syllables in the line. I will use a dictionary of pre-calculated syllable counts for accuracy.\n3.  Evaluate each of the given answer choices based on its definition, primarily the required syllable count per line.\n4.  Eliminate the choices that do not match the poem's total syllable count.\n5.  For the most plausible option, perform a detailed scansion (analysis of stress patterns) to confirm that the poem's rhythm matches the required meter.\n6.  Print the step-by-step analysis and the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef analyze_poem_meter():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the metric pattern of the words in the erasure poem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Transcribe the poem\n    poem_line = \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n    poem_words_str = \"rules and lines an intricate spider's web work\"\n    poem_words = poem_words_str.split()\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: The poem is transcribed into a single line.\")\n    print(f\"Poem: '{poem_line}'\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Count syllables for accuracy using a dictionary\n    syllable_dict = {\n        \"rules\": 1, \"and\": 1, \"lines\": 1, \"an\": 1, \n        \"intricate\": 3, \"spider's\": 2, \"web\": 1, \"work\": 1\n    }\n    \n    total_syllables = 0\n    syllable_calculation = []\n    for word in poem_words:\n        count = syllable_dict.get(word, 0)\n        total_syllables += count\n        syllable_calculation.append(str(count))\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the total number of syllables.\")\n    print(f\"Syllable count per word: {', '.join([f'{w}({syllable_dict[w]})' for w in poem_words])}\")\n    print(f\"The calculation is: {' + '.join(syllable_calculation)} = {total_syllables}\")\n    print(f\"The poem has a total of {total_syllables} syllables.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 3: Evaluate the options based on syllable count\n    options = {\n        'A': ('free verse', 'No fixed syllable count'),\n        'B': ('iambic pentameter', '10 syllables'),\n        'C': ('alexandrine', '12 syllables'),\n        'D': ('sapphic', '11 syllables (for a hendecasyllabic line)'),\n        'E': ('loose iambic trimeter', '~6 syllables'),\n        'F': ('american sentence', '17 syllables')\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Compare the poem's syllable count to the definitions of the answer choices.\")\n    for key, (name, description) in options.items():\n        match_status = \"\"\n        if '11' in description and total_syllables == 11:\n            match_status = \"-> This matches the poem's syllable count.\"\n        elif 'syllable' in description and '11' not in description and 'No fixed' not in description:\n            match_status = \"-> Does not match.\"\n        print(f\"{key}. {name}: {description}. {match_status}\")\n    print(\"\\nBased on syllable count, 'Sapphic' is the only plausible option among the fixed forms.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 4: Confirm Sapphic meter with scansion\n    print(\"Step 4: Confirm the Sapphic pattern with scansion.\")\n    print(\"A Sapphic hendecasyllabic (11-syllable) line has a strict 5-foot meter:\")\n    print(\"Pattern: Trochee | Trochee | Dactyl | Trochee | Spondee (or Trochee)\")\n    print(\"Syllables:   2    |    2    |    3     |    2    |      2\")\n    print(\"Stress:    S - u  |   S - u   | S - u - u  |   S - u   |  S - S (or S - u)\")\n    print(\"(S = Stressed, u = Unstressed)\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nApplying this structure to the poem:\")\n    feet_structure = [\n        (\"rules and\", \"S u\", \"Trochee\"),\n        (\"lines, an\", \"S u\", \"Trochee\"),\n        (\"in-tri-cate\", \"S u u\", \"Dactyl\"),\n        (\"spi-der's\", \"S u\", \"Trochee\"),\n        (\"web work\", \"S S\", \"Spondee\")\n    ]\n    \n    print(\"Poem split into metrical feet:\")\n    print(f\"1.
