    print("Compound A is Tris(2-methoxyphenyl)methanol. In the first step, the acidic pyridinium HCl at 200 Â°C causes both the formation of a carbocation at the central carbon (by loss of -OH) and the demethylation of the three methoxy groups. This is followed by intramolecular cyclization (where the phenoxide oxygens attack the central carbocation) and oxidation to form the stable aromatic trioxatriangulenium cation.")
