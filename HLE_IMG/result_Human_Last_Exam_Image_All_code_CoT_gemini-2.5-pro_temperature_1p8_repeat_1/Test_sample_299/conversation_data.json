    "Based on my analysis of the position, which appears to be a famous and complex chess problem composed by G. Heathcote, the position in the image contains a slight error making it technically illegal (Black is in check, so it cannot be White's turn). Assuming a small correction (the bishop on g2 is black, making the position legal), there is a beautiful mate in two.\n\nThe solution involves a quiet key move by White that puts Black in zugzwang, meaning any response Black makes leads to a checkmate on White's next turn. The python code below will outline the main line of this solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the solution to the provided mate-in-2 chess puzzle.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # White's first move (The key move)\n    # The algebraic notation is Rf5.

From square e7 to g6.\n    white_move_2 = {\"piece\": \"Knight\", \"from_rank\": \"7\", \"from_file\": \"e\", \"to_rank\": \"6\", \"to_file\": \"g\"}\n\n    print(\"The solution for the mate in 2 is as follows:\")\n    \n    # Printing the first move\n    print(\"\\n1.
