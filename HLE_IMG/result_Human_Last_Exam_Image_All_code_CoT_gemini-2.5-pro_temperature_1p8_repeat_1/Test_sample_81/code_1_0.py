# 1. Define the molecules and their key structural features.
# 2. Analyze the source of strain for each molecule.
# 3. Compare the magnitudes of strain to establish a ranking.
# 4. Print the detailed reasoning for the ranking, from most to least reactive.
# 5. Print the final, concise answer.

            'reason': 'This is the most strained and reactive lactam. The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. Due to the rigid bicyclic structure, the nitrogen is forced into a pyramidal geometry, and its lone pair cannot overlap with the carbonyl pi system. This prevents amide resonance stabilization (an effect related to Bredt\'s Rule). The loss of this large stabilization energy makes the carbonyl carbon extremely electrophilic and the molecule highly reactive.'

            'name': 'Molecule A (A β-lactam derivative)',
            'reason': 'This molecule is a beta-lactam (amide in a 4-membered ring). Beta-lactams are highly strained due to severe angle strain within the small ring. The bond angles are forced to be ~90 degrees, far from their ideal values. This ring strain makes the molecule very reactive, as reactions like hydrolysis relieve the strain. While highly reactive, the strain is generally considered less severe than the complete loss of amide resonance found in molecule C.'

This lactam can achieve a nearly planar amide bond, allowing for good resonance stabilization. It is the least strained and therefore the least reactive of the three molecules.'
