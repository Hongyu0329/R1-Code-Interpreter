    "To solve this problem, I will analyze the provided image computationally. The task is to find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm among the nine visualized Wigner 3-j symbols.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Objective**: Determine the ratio of the maximum to minimum infinity-norm from the nine visualizations.\n2.  **Infinity-Norm Definition**: The infinity-norm of a matrix is its largest element in absolute value. In the context of these heatmaps, it corresponds to the most intense color.\n3.  **Color Analysis**: The images use a red-white-green colormap. Typically, white represents zero, while red and green represent positive and negative values, respectively. The intensity of the color (how saturated it is) corresponds to the magnitude of the value. I can quantify this magnitude for each pixel by calculating the absolute difference between its Red (R) and Green (G) color channels, i.e., `abs(R - G)`. For white pixels `Râ‰ˆG` so the magnitude is near zero, while for intense reds or greens, this difference will be large.\n4.  **Implementation**: I will write a Python script that:\n    a.  Loads the image.\n    b.  Splits the main image into the 9 subplots.\n    c.  For each subplot, iterates through its pixels to find the maximum `abs(R - G)` value, which represents its infinity-norm.\n    d.  Compares the 9 calculated norms to find the overall maximum and minimum.\n    e.  Calculates and prints the final ratio.\n\nThis method provides an objective and precise measurement, avoiding the inconsistencies of human visual perception.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport os\n\ndef solve_wigner_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided image of Wigner 3-j symbols to find the ratio\n    of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm.\n\n    This script assumes the image is named 'image.png' and is in the same\n    directory.
