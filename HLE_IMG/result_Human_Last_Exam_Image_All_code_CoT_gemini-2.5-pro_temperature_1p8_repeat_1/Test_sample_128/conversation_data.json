    "This is a fascinating multi-component chemical reaction. To determine the structure of compound A, we need to analyze the roles of each reactant and the likely sequence of reactions.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**: The reactants are 2-aminopyridine (a primary amine), o-phthalaldehyde (a dialdehyde), and TMSCN (a cyanide source). This mixture points towards a three-component condensation reaction, a type of reaction that efficiently builds complex molecules from simple starting materials.\n2.  **Propose a Mechanism**: The reaction likely follows these steps:\n    *   First, the primary amine (`-NH2` of 2-aminopyridine) reacts with one of the aldehyde groups of o-phthalaldehyde to form an imine after losing a molecule of water.\n    *   The cyanide ion (`CN-`), generated from TMSCN and KF, then attacks the newly formed imine.\n    *   This creates an intermediate that contains both a secondary amine and the second, unreacted aldehyde group.\n    *   An intramolecular cyclization occurs where the secondary amine attacks the remaining aldehyde.\n    *   Finally, the resulting cyclic intermediate dehydrates (loses another molecule of water) to form a stable, conjugated heterocyclic system.\n3.  **Determine Product Structure**: Following the mechanism, the final product, Compound A, will be a substituted isoindole. Specifically, it is **2-(pyridin-2-yl)isoindole-1-carbonitrile**.\n4.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to present this information clearly. The script will:\n    *   State the name of the final product.\n    *   Display the balanced chemical equation for the overall transformation, printing all the stoichiometric coefficients as requested.\n    *   Use the cheminformatics library `RDKit` to programmatically verify the molecular formula and calculate the exact mass of Compound A.\n\nHere is the Python code to provide the solution.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies Compound A from the reaction and provides details.\n    \"\"\"\n    # First, check if rdkit is available.\n    try:\n        from rdkit import Chem\n        from rdkit.Chem import Descriptors\n        from rdkit.Chem.rdMolDescriptors import CalcMolFormula\n        rdkit_available = True\n    except ImportError:\n        rdkit_available = False\n\n    # --- Information based on Chemical Principles ---\n\n    # Define Reactant and Product Information\n    aminopyridine = \"2-aminopyridine (C5H6N2)\"\n    phthalaldehyde = \"o-phthalaldehyde (C8H6O2)\"\n    cyanide_source = \"HCN (from TMSCN)\"  # Simplified for stoichiometry\n    \n    product_A_name = \"2-(pyridin-2-yl)isoindole-1-carbonitrile\"\n    product_A_formula_text = \"C14H9N3\"\n    byproduct = \"Water (H2O)\"\n\n    # Print Reaction Information\n    print(f\"The reaction is a three-component condensation to form Compound A.\")\n    print(f\"Compound A is identified as: {product_A_name}\")\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"-\"*40)\n    print(\"Overall Balanced Chemical Equation:\")\n    \n    # Stoichiometry is 1:1:1 -> 1:2, as two dehydration steps occur.\n    print(f\"1 {aminopyridine} + 1 {phthalaldehyde} + 1 {cyanide_source} -> 1 {product_A_formula_text} + 2 {byproduct}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Stoichiometric Coefficients ---\")\n    print(f\"Number for 2-aminopyridine: 1\")\n    print(f\"Number for o-phthalaldehyde: 1\")\n    print(f\"Number for Cyanide Source: 1\")\n    print(f\"Number for Compound A ({product_A_formula_text}): 1\")\n    print(f\"Number for Water (byproduct): 2\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40 + \"\\n\")\n\n    # --- Verification using RDKit (if available) ---\n    if rdkit_available:\n        print(\"Verifying properties of Compound A using RDKit...\")\n        # SMILES string for 2-(pyridin-2-yl)isoindole-1-carbonitrile\n        product_smiles = \"c1cccc2c1C(C#N)=CN2c1ncccc1\"\n        mol_A = Chem.MolFromSmiles(product_smiles)\n        \n        if mol_A:\n            calculated_formula = CalcMolFormula(mol_A)\n            exact_mass = Descriptors.ExactMolWt(mol_A)\n            \n            print(f\"Molecular Formula: {calculated_formula}\")\n            print(f\"Exact Mass: {exact_mass:.4f}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Error: Could not process the molecular structure.\", file=sys.stderr)\n    else:\n        print(\"Note: RDKit library not found.
