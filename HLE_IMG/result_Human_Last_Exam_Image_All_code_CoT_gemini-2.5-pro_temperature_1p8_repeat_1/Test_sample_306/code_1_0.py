def solve_three_body_eccentricity():
    """
    Determines the eccentricity for each plot and lists the plots in ascending order of eccentricity.

    The solution is based on the physical principle that increasing the orbital
    eccentricity 'e' of the stars introduces more chaos into the planet's motion.
    By visually ranking the plots from most regular to most chaotic, we can deduce
    the corresponding order of eccentricity.

    The ordering of plots from least chaotic to most chaotic is determined as:
    8, 1, 7, 2, 3, 5, 9, 6, 4.

    This corresponds to 'n' values from 0 to 8 in the equation e = n / 20.
