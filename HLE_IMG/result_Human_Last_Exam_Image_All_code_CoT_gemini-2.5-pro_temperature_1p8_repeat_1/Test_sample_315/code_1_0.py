def solve_higgs_puzzle():
    """
    This function identifies the plot numbers corresponding to the Higgs boson decay channels.

    The identification is based on the physical properties of Higgs decays:
    1.  Decays to heavy bosons (W+W-, ZZ, t-tbar) have mass thresholds.
    2.  H -> W+W- (1) opens at M_H ~ 161 GeV and is dominant at high mass.
    3.  H -> ZZ (2) opens at M_H ~ 182 GeV, second dominant at high mass.
    4.  H -> t-tbar (3) opens at M_H ~ 346 GeV.
    5.  Below the W+W- threshold, H -> b-bbar (4) is the dominant channel because the b-quark is the heaviest available fermion.
    6.  H -> gg (5) is the second most likely decay for a light Higgs.
    7.  BR(H->ττ) (6) > BR(H->cc) (7) because the tau is heavier than the charm quark.
    8.  H -> γγ (8) is a rare decay and has the smallest branching ratio.
