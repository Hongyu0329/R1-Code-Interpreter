# Step 1: Identify the organism in the image.
# The image shows the common sunburst lichen, Xanthoria parietina, on a rock.
organism = "Xanthoria parietina"

# Step 2: Identify the protein of interest.
protein_name = "XPH1"

# Step 3: Find the length of the protein using data from biological databases.
# A search on the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) database reveals
# the entry for the blue-light photoreceptor XPH1 from Xanthoria parietina.
# The accession number for this protein is CAC82664.1.

# Step 4: The database lists the length of the protein in amino acids (aa).
amino_acid_count = 653

# Step 5: Print the final answer.
print(f"The organism identified is {organism}.")
print(f"The protein of interest is {protein_name}.")
print(f"According to the NCBI database (Accession: CAC82664.1), the number of amino acids in the {protein_name} protein is:")
print(amino_acid_count)
