# The voltage for the second plateau (V_2) can be modeled as the average
# of the potentials associated with the two coexisting stages: Stage 2 and Stage 3.
# The potential for a stage 'k' is given by -μ_k/e.
# So, V_2 = ((-μ_2/e) + (-μ_3/e)) / 2
# This simplifies to the formula V_2 = -(μ_2 + μ_3) / (2e).

# We will print the formula for the second plateau voltage, V.
# The numbers in the formula are 2 and 3.
