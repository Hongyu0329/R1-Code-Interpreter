    "This is my analysis of the provided histopathology image:\n\n1.  **Observe the main structure:** The image displays a kidney glomerulus, which is the filtering unit of the kidney.\n2.  **Identify abnormalities:** The glomerulus is not normal. It is hypercellular, meaning there are far more cells than usual.\n3.  **Focus on the key feature:** The most dramatic finding is the presence of a large, crescent-shaped mass of cells filling the space around the central glomerular tuft (Bowman's space). This is known as a \"cellular crescent.\"\n4.  **Interpret the finding:** The formation of crescents is a reaction to severe injury to the glomerular capillaries. It represents the proliferation of parietal epithelial cells and an influx of inflammatory cells.\n5.  **Formulate the diagnosis:** This histopathological pattern is the hallmark of **Crescentic Glomerulonephritis**, a severe form of kidney disease also known as Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN).\n\nBased on this analysis, I will now provide the Python code to print the diagnosis.\n\n```python\ndef get_histopathological_diagnosis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the key features of the provided histopathology image.\n\n    The image shows a glomerulus with two major pathological findings:\n    1. Glomerular hypercellularity: An increased number of cells within the glomerular tuft.\n    2. Cellular Crescent: A prominent, crescent-shaped proliferation of cells filling Bowman's space,\n       compressing the glomerular tuft.\n\n    These features are the defining characteristics of a specific, severe form of glomerulonephritis.\n    \"\"\"\n    diagnosis = \"Crescentic Glomerulonephritis\"\n    print(f\"The histopathological diagnosis is: {diagnosis}\")\n\nget_histopathological_diagnosis()\n```\n<<<Crescentic Glomerulonephritis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the histopathological diagnosis of this image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
