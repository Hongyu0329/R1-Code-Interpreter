    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will follow the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules. This involves a multi-step process:\n\n1.  **IUPAC Nomenclature**: We first identify the principal functional group and the longest carbon chain that contains it to establish the correct IUPAC name and numbering of the atoms.\n    *   The molecule contains both a hydroxyl (-OH) and an amino (-NH2) group. The alcohol group has higher priority, so the molecule is named as an alcohol (-ol).\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the C-OH carbon has five atoms.\n    *   We number the chain to give the -OH group the lowest possible number. Numbering from the end closest to the OH group gives it position 2.\n    *   The full IUPAC name is: **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**.\n    *   This molecule has three chiral centers at carbons C2, C3, and C4.\n\n2.  **Assign Priorities**: For each chiral center, we assign priorities (1-4, highest to lowest) to the four attached groups based on atomic number.\n3.  **Determine R/S Configuration**: We determine the configuration (R for *Rectus* or S for *Sinister*) by observing the 3D arrangement of the substituents.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis that will be printed by the code:\n\n```python\ndef determine_absolute_configuration():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the step-by-step process for determining the\n    absolute configuration of the provided molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine IUPAC Name and Chiral Centers\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH), which has higher priority than the amine (-NH2).\")\n    print(\"The longest carbon chain containing the carbon bonded to the -OH group is a pentane chain.\")\n    print(\"Numbering from the end closest to the -OH group gives it the lowest number (position 2).\")\n    print(\"The IUPAC name is: 5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol.\")\n    print(\"The chiral centers are the carbons at positions 2, 3, and 4.\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Assign Priorities to Substituents (CIP Rules)\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"For C2 (leftmost stereocenter):\")\n    print(\"  Substituents: -OH, -H, -CH3 (C1), -C3H(Et)...\")\n    print(\"  Priorities: 1: -OH, 2: -C3, 3: -CH3, 4: -H\")\n    print(\"\")\n    print(\"For C3 (middle stereocenter):\")\n    print(\"  Substituents: -H, -CH2CH3 (Ethyl), -C2H(OH)..., -C4H(Me)...\")\n    print(\"  Priorities: 1: -C2 (neighbor C is bonded to O), 2: -C4 (neighbor C is bonded to C,C,H), 3: -Ethyl (neighbor C is bonded to C,H,H), 4: -H\")\n    print(\"\")\n    print(\"For C4 (rightmost stereocenter):\")\n    print(\"  Substituents: -H, -CH3, -CH2NH2 (C5), -C3H(Et)...\")\n    print(\"  Priorities: 1: -CH2NH2 (neighbor C is bonded to N), 2: -C3 (neighbor C is bonded to C,C,H), 3: -CH3 (neighbor C is bonded to H,H,H), 4: -H\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Determine R/S Configuration for Each Center\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Configuration at C2:\")\n    print(\"  - The -OH (1) is on a wedge, and -CH3 (3) is on a dash.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Determine the absolute configuration of the molecule in the picture.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
