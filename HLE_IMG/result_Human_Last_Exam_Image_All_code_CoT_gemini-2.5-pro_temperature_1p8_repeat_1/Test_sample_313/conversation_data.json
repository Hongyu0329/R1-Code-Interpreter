    "This is a word riddle that requires connecting two different meanings of the same phrase, \"X Y\".\n\nHere is my thinking process to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the second clue:** \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This points directly to the history of hat-making. Hat makers, or \"hatters\", historically used mercury nitrate to treat felt. This process, known as carroting, led to mercury poisoning, giving rise to the phrase \"mad as a hatter\". The \"trick\" of the hatter's trade was this dangerous method. This strongly suggests \"X Y\" is related to a \"hatter's trick\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the first clue and the image:** \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\" The image shows a man, who appears to be a professional athlete, receiving a trophy at an awards ceremony. The context strongly suggests a sporting event.\n\n3.  **Connect the clues:** The phrase that bridges the world of sports and the history of mercury-using hatters is \"Hat Trick\".\n    *   In sports (like hockey or soccer), a **Hat Trick** is the achievement of scoring three times in a single game.\n    *   The hatter's method involving mercury can be described as a trade secret or a \"trick\" of the trade. Therefore, \"Another Hat Trick\" refers to the historical hatter's process.\n\nThe term \"Hat Trick\" fits both clues perfectly. The image represents the sporting context of a \"Hat Trick\", while the text describes the historical meaning related to hatters and mercury.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves the word riddle by identifying the phrase \"X Y\".\n\n    The solution is based on two clues:\n    1. A visual clue of a sports award ceremony. This points to the modern meaning of \"Hat Trick\".\n    2. A text clue about mercury salts, which points to the historical \"hatter's trick\" of using mercury in felt processing.\n\n    The common phrase is \"Hat Trick\".\n    \"\"\"\n    x = \"Hat\"\n    y = \"Trick\"\n    \n    # There is no equation to solve, so we will just print the identified phrase.\n    print(f\"{x} {y}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
