    "The image displays several intertidal species, including barnacles and snails, on a rock. To determine whether the photo was taken on the Atlantic or Pacific coast of North America, we need to identify a species that is exclusively found on one of these coasts.\n\n1.  **Identify the prominent species:** The most clearly identifiable organisms are the snails. There are two larger snails and several smaller, darker ones. One of the larger snails has a distinct, light brown shell with darker spiral bands.\n2.  **Analyze the distribution:** This striped snail is identifiable as the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*. This species is native to the coasts of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean (Europe). It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the mid-1800s and has since become a very common and widespread species from Canada to Maryland.\n3.  **Confirm exclusivity:** Crucially, *Littorina littorea* is not established on the Pacific coast of North America. Its presence is therefore a definitive indicator that the ecosystem is on the Atlantic coast. The other large snail, likely an Atlantic Dogwhelk (*Nucella lapillus*), is also an Atlantic-only species, further confirming this conclusion.\n\nThe scientific name of the species that definitively places this photo on the Atlantic coast is *Littorina littorea*.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the species that indicates an Atlantic coast location\n    and prints its scientific name.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The key species in the photo is the Common Periwinkle.\n    # Scientific name: Littorina littorea\n    # Distribution: Native to the European Atlantic, introduced and common on the North American Atlantic coast,\n    # but absent from the Pacific coast.
