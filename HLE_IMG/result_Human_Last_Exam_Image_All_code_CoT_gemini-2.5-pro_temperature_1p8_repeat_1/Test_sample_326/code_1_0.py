def solve_soliton_problem():
    """
    Solves for the value of (1 - max|Φ|) based on the given NLSE problem.

    The solution path is as follows:
    1. The flat-top soliton ansatz reduces the NLSE to an algebraic equation for the maximum amplitude A_max.
    2. The given logarithmic derivative provides the frequency ω = 17/324.
    3. The equation is quadratic in Y = |A_max|^8: (1-R^2)Y^2 + RY - ω = 0, where R = (v2/v1)^2.
    4. We deduce that R = 4/9, as this makes the discriminant of the quadratic a perfect square, leading to a rational solution.
    5. We solve the quadratic for Y, take the physically valid positive root.
    6. We calculate A_max = Y^(1/8).
    7. The final result is 1 - A_max.
