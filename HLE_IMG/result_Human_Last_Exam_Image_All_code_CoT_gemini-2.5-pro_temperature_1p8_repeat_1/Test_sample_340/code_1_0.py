def solve_gravitational_wavelet_signatures():
    """
    Solves the Gravitational Wavelet Signatures puzzle by systematically matching
    wavelet types and letter indices to the nine plots.

    The solution is derived based on the established framework where:
    - Rows are wavelet types: Row 1 = Mexican Hat (M), Row 2 = Paul (P), Row 3 = Gabor (G).
    - Columns are parameter groups: Col 1 = {c,f,i}, Col 2 = {a,d,g}, Col 3 = {b,e,h}.

    Matching within each column is done by correlating visual features (frequency,
    chirpiness, strength) with the physical parameters (mass, PN order) encoded
    in the letter indices.
