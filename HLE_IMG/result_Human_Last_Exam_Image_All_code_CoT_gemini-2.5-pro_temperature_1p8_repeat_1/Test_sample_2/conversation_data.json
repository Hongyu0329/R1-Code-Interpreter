    "To determine the worst-case time complexity of the provided sorting algorithm, we need to analyze its recursive structure.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Algorithm:** Break down the recursive function to understand its operations at each step.\n2.  **Identify the Worst-Case:** Determine the input condition that leads to the maximum number of computations.\n3.  **Formulate a Recurrence Relation:** Express the algorithm's runtime `T(n)` for an input of size `n` in terms of its runtime on smaller inputs.\n4.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:** Solve the relation to find its closed-form solution, which will give us the time complexity in Big-O notation.\n5.  **Present the Analysis:** Use a Python script to explain these steps and print the final conclusion.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef explain_complexity_analysis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided sorting algorithm and explains its worst-case time complexity.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Algorithm Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"The algorithm is a recursive function `sort(a, n)`.
