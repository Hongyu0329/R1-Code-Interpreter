    "This is a fascinating data puzzle. To figure out the country, I need to analyze the timing of the peaks in the Google Trends graph and correlate them with significant annual events of a specific nation.\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Graph's Axes:** The x-axis shows a timeframe from late 2019 to mid-2023. The y-axis shows relative search interest.\n2.  **Identify Recurring Peaks:** Each colored line (red, yellow, blue) represents a search term for a historical event. The graph shows that all three lines have spikes that repeat on a yearly cycle. I will determine the approximate date of these annual peaks.\n3.  **Correlate Peaks with National Events:** I will use the dates of the peaks to hypothesize which national events they represent.\n    *   **Red Line:** This line shows a very strong peak every year in late January. This timing is a perfect match for **Australia Day**, which is on January 26th. It is a major public holiday and often a topic of public discussion, which drives search interest.\n    *   **Yellow Line:** This line shows an extremely high, sharp peak every year around late April. The highest peak on the entire graph is a yellow one. This timing strongly corresponds to **Anzac Day** on April 25th, a national day of remembrance in Australia that is one of the most significant commemorations in the country.\n    *   **Blue Line:** This line has smaller, but still consistent, peaks. They appear to happen annually around late May or early June. This timing aligns with events related to Indigenous Australian history, specifically **National Sorry Day** (May 26th) and **National Reconciliation Week** (May 27th - June 3rd), which includes **Mabo Day** (June 3rd).\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since all three distinct annual events (Australia Day, Anzac Day, and events of National Reconciliation Week) are central to the history and national identity of **Australia**, this is the country in question.\n\nNow, I will provide the Python code to print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_country_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the patterns in the provided Google Trends graph to deduce the country.\n    \n    The analysis is as follows:\n    1. Red Line: Peaks annually in late January, consistent with Australia Day (Jan 26th).\n    2. Yellow Line: Peaks annually in late April, consistent with Anzac Day (April 25th).\n    3. Blue Line: Peaks annually in late May/early June, consistent with National Reconciliation Week events.\n    \n    These three distinct and significant annual commemorations point to one country.\n    \"\"\"\n    country = \"Australia\"\n    print(f\"The country identified from the Google Trends data is: {country}\")\n\nsolve_country_riddle()\n<<<Australia>>>\n```"
