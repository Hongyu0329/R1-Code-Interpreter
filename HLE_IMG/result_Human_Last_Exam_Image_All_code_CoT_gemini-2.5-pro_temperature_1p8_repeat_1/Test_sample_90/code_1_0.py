    Product A (C14H20N2O3):
    
    This product is identified as the hydrolysis product of a key azomethine ylide intermediate formed during the reaction cascade. The molecular formula C14H20N2O3 perfectly corresponds to the addition of one water molecule to the proposed intermediate (C14H18N2O2). The provided NMR data suggest a highly rearranged structure consistent with hydrolytic ring-opening.

    Key structural features deduced from NMR:
    - A trisubstituted pyrrole ring core, formed from the initial cycloaddition and decarboxylation.
    - A methoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH3) originating from the methyl propiolate reagent.
    - An N-acetyl group (-COCH3) from the acetic anhydride.
    - Two three-carbon side chains (e.g., -CH2CH2CH2-), indicating that both rings of the starting material have opened.

    The structure is a pyrrole substituted with a methoxycarbonyl group and two side chains derived from the original starting material. A specific structure would be a pyrrole ring with -COOCH3, an N-acetylaminopropyl group, and a hydroxypropyl group as substituents.

    product_B_desc = """
    Product B (Molecular formula given as C12H14N2O3, likely a typo for C14H18N2O2):

    This product is identified as the result of an intramolecular [1,4]-hydrogen shift from the common azomethine ylide intermediate. This is strongly supported by the 1H-NMR data, particularly the pair of doublets at 7.58 ppm and 5.98 ppm, which is characteristic of a cis-disubstituted double bond that would be present in this structure.

    Key structural features:
    - A complex tricyclic [5,7,5] fused ring system.
    - An N-acetyl group and a methoxycarbonyl group.
    - A cis-double bond within the newly formed ring structure.

    product_C_desc = """
    Product C (C11H16N2O3):
    
    The identity of this product is the most ambiguous due to conflicting evidence between the established reaction mechanism and the provided data. There are two main possibilities:

    1. Based on the cascade mechanism: Product C would be the result of an [8Ï€]-electrocyclization of the azomethine ylide intermediate, forming a complex tetracyclic caged structure (formula C14H18N2O2).

    2. Based on the provided formula: The formula C11H16N2O3 corresponds exactly to an isomer of the N-acetylated starting material (starting material C9H14N2O2 + acetyl C2H2O = C11H16N2O3). The presence of three carbonyl signals in the 13C-NMR suggests it could be a tricyclic lactam, formed by an intramolecular condensation reaction after the initial N-acetylation, creating a spirocyclic center. This represents a separate, simpler reaction pathway.
