def solve_vortex_puzzle():
    """
    Solves the vortex trajectory puzzle by assembling the pre-analyzed results.

    The solution is based on a step-by-step analysis of each plot:
    1. Regular (non-chaotic) plots were analyzed first to establish visual criteria.
       - The unique vortex is the one with a trajectory distinct from the other two, which move as a pair.
       - Strength is determined by path complexity:
         - 'strong' (uppercase) vortices have simple, stately paths (large orbits or central rosettes).
         - 'weak' (lowercase) vortices have complex paths (tight spirals or messy inner trajectories).
    2. The 12 results from the regular plots were arranged in a 4x4 grid.
       g r ? b
       B G ? R
       G R ? B
       b g ? r
    3. Patterns were identified in this grid to deduce the characters for the chaotic plots in column 3.
       - Strength depends on the row: Rows 1 & 4 are weak (lowercase), Rows 2 & 3 are strong (uppercase).
       - A color pattern was identified across the columns, suggesting the missing column 3 should have colors (B,R,B,R).
    4. The final grid is:
       g r b b
       B G R R
       G R B B
       b g r r
    5. The final answer is the concatenation of these characters.
