    "The image displays a sequence of three micrographs labeled L, M, and N, showing a filamentous structure at different points in time. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the process:\n\n1.  **Identify the structure:** The images show a fungal hypha, which is a long, branching, filamentous structure of a fungus. We can see it's made of multiple cells separated by cross-walls (septa).\n2.  **Analyze the sequence:**\n    *   **Image L:** Shows the initial state of a terminal cell of the hypha. It's relatively straight. An arrowhead points to the septum separating it from the sub-terminal cell.\n    *   **Image M:** A small, hook-like bulge (indicated by the arrowhead) has started to form on the side of the terminal cell, growing backward.\n    *   **Image N:** The hook-like structure has grown larger and is curving back towards the sub-terminal cell.\n3.  **Identify the process:** This specific sequence of forming a backward-growing hook that eventually fuses with the cell behind it is characteristic of **clamp connection formation**. This is a complex process found in many species of Basidiomycete fungi. It serves as a crucial mechanism during cell division to ensure that each new cell maintains a dikaryotic state, meaning it contains two distinct haploid nuclei (n+n).\n\nThe following Python code will print a description of this process.\n\n```python\ndef describe_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function describes the biological process shown in the provided image sequence.\n  \"\"\"\n  process_name = \"Clamp connection formation\"\n  description = \"The sequence of images (L, M, N) depicts the formation of a clamp connection in a fungal hypha. \" \\\n                \"This process starts with a small, backward-facing bulge forming on the terminal cell (M), \" \\\n                \"which then grows into a hook-like structure that will eventually fuse with the sub-terminal cell (N). \" \\\n                \"This is a characteristic mechanism for maintaining the dikaryotic (n+n) nuclear state during cell division in Basidiomycete fungi.\"\n  \n  print(description)\n\ndescribe_process()\n```\n<<<Clamp connection formation>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
