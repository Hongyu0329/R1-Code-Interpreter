# The analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) traces points to a specific seizure type.
# EEG Analysis: The traces from L-FC, L-SC, and R-SC show synchronized, high-amplitude, rhythmic spike discharges, indicating a generalized seizure.
# EMG Analysis: The EMG trace shows rhythmic bursts of muscle activity that are precisely correlated with the EEG spikes.
# This pattern of rhythmic muscle jerking (seen on EMG) driven by rhythmic cortical discharges (seen on EEG) is the defining characteristic of a clonic seizure.
# Other options are less likely:
# - Tonic seizures would show sustained, non-rhythmic muscle contraction on the EMG.
# - Absence seizures typically lack strong motor components.
# - A tonic-clonic seizure would have a preceding tonic phase, which is absent here.
# Therefore, the most accurate classification is Clonic Seizure.
