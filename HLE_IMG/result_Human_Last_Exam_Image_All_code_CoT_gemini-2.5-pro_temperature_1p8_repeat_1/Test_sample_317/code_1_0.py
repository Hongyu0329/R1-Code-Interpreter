    This function prints the final 9-character answer based on the analysis.
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  k (Character 1): From the analysis of the x3 equation, Re > 82.5. Since Re = 50*k, the smallest integer k is 2.
    2.  Axis Mappings (Characters 2-5):
        - x1 -> i: Identified as part of the core chaotic system showing a butterfly attractor.
        - x2 -> h: Identified by the dramatic range increase in Simulation 2, linked to parameter 'b'.
        - x3 -> f: Identified by its large-valued range, consistent across multiple plots.
        - x4 -> g: Identified as the remaining variable, part of the driven (x4, x5) subsystem.
    3.  Parameter Changes (Characters 6-9):
        - Sim 1 -> 0: The baseline simulation with no changes.
        - Sim 2 -> B: The large increase in the x2 range indicates a tenfold increase in 'b'.
        - Sim 3 -> E: The flip in sign and large increase in magnitude of x5 points to a tenfold increase in the magnitude of 'e'.
        - Sim 4 -> c: The suppression of chaos and stabilization of x3 indicates a tenfold decrease in 'c'.
