    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** I will visually inspect the raster plot to locate the time points where a large number of neurons fire simultaneously. These events appear as dense vertical bands of dots.\n2.  **Estimate Timestamps:** I will estimate the center time for each identified burst from the x-axis (Time in seconds). Based on the plot, the major bursts are centered at approximately 3, 16, 27, 36, and 48 seconds.\n3.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** I will find the time difference between each consecutive pair of burst timestamps.\n4.  **Calculate the Average IBI:** I will sum all the calculated inter-burst intervals and divide by the number of intervals.\n5.  **Format the Output:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the timestamps, the intervals, the equation for the average, and the final result rounded to two significant figures.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_average_ibi():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies timestamps of synchronized bursts from the provided graph,\n    calculates the inter-burst intervals (IBIs), and computes the average IBI.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify and list the timestamps of the synchronized bursts (in seconds)\n    # from visual inspection of the graph.\n    burst_timestamps = [3, 16, 27, 36, 48]\n    print(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs)\n    inter_burst_intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\n    print(f\"Calculated inter-burst intervals (s): {list(inter_burst_intervals)}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the average IBI\n    average_ibi = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\n\n    # Create the equation string for display\n    interval_sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, inter_burst_intervals))\n    equation = f\"({interval_sum_str}) / {len(inter_burst_intervals)}\"\n\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the average inter-burst interval:\")\n    print(f\"Average IBI = {equation} = {average_ibi:.4f} s\")\n\n    # Step 5: Round the result to two significant figures\n    # For a number like 11.25, rounding to 2 sig figs results in 11.\n    final_answer = float(f\"{average_ibi:.2g}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe average inter-burst interval rounded to two significant figures is: {final_answer} s\")\n\n    return final_answer\n\n# Execute the function and store the final answer\nresult = calculate_average_ibi()\n\n# The final answer in the required format\n# print(f\"\\n<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n<<<11>>>"
