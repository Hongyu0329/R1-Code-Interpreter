    "This square structure is not an ancient ruin, but a more modern historical remnant. It is the foundation of a building from the former **Marfa Army Airfield**, a World War II-era pilot training base in Texas, USA. The base was active in the 1940s and later decommissioned.\n\nWhile the specific foundation itself isn't a named landmark, the entire airfield site is historically significant. The artist Donald Judd later purchased many of the airfield's buildings and land to create the Chinati Foundation, a contemporary art museum, which is located nearby. Therefore, the structure is a historic remnant of 20th-century military activity in the region.\n\nHere is a Python script that converts the provided coordinates and generates a link to view the location on a map.\n\n```python\ndef dms_to_decimal(degrees, minutes, seconds, direction):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts coordinates from Degrees, Minutes, Seconds (DMS) to Decimal Degrees.\n    \"\"\"\n    decimal_degrees = degrees + minutes/60 + seconds/3600\n    if direction in ['S', 'W']:\n        decimal_degrees *= -1\n    return decimal_degrees\n\n# Latitude: 29° 06' 18.75''N\nlat_deg = 29\nlat_min = 6\nlat_sec = 18.75\nlat_dir = 'N'\n\n# Longitude: 103° 47' 50.28''W\nlon_deg = 103\nlon_min = 47\nlon_sec = 50.28\nlon_dir = 'W'\n\n# Perform the conversion\ndecimal_lat = dms_to_decimal(lat_deg, lat_min, lat_sec, lat_dir)\ndecimal_lon = dms_to_decimal(lon_deg, lon_min, lon_sec, lon_dir)\n\n# Construct Google Maps URL\ngoogle_maps_url = f\"https://www.google.com/maps?q={decimal_lat},{decimal_lon}&z=17&t=h\"\n\n# Print the results\nprint(\"--- Location Identification ---\")\nprint(f\"Original Coordinates: {lat_deg}° {lat_min}' {lat_sec:.2f}''{lat_dir}, {lon_deg}° {lon_min}' {lon_sec:.2f}''{lon_dir}\")\nprint(f\"Converted to Decimal Degrees: {decimal_lat}, {decimal_lon}\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Structure Identification ---\")\nprint(\"The structure at these coordinates is the remnant foundation of a building from the Marfa Army Airfield, a historic World War II-era airbase.\")\nprint(\"The site is located near Marfa, Texas.\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Verification Link ---\")\nprint(\"You can view the location on Google Maps (Satellite View):\")\nprint(google_maps_url)\n\n```\n<<<The structure is the foundation of a building from the former Marfa Army Airfield, a World War II historic site.>>>"
