    "To distinguish between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance, the most important feature to observe on the sporophyte is the seta, which is the small stalk that holds the capsule. My plan is to write a Python script that clearly explains this key difference.\n\nThe script will:\n1.  Define the distinguishing characteristics for each species' seta and capsule orientation.\n2.  Use these definitions to print a clear, comparative explanation.\n3.  Conclude by summarizing the main point of differentiation.\n\n```python\ndef explain_grimmia_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the primary visual difference between the sporophytes\n    of Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n    \"\"\"\n    species_1_name = \"Grimmia montana\"\n    species_1_seta = \"a short and straight seta\"\n    species_1_capsule = \"upright and immersed among the leaves\"\n\n    species_2_name = \"Grimmia curviseta\"\n    species_2_seta = \"a short but strongly curved seta\"\n    species_2_capsule = \"nodding or hanging\"\n\n    print(\"The main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta lies in the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule):\\n\")\n    print(f\"1. {species_1_name}:\")\n    print(f\"   - Seta: Has {species_1_seta}.\")\n    print(f\"   - Capsule Position: As a result, its capsule is {species_1_capsule}.\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"2. {species_2_name}:\")\n    print(f\"   - Seta: Has {species_2_seta} (the name 'curviseta' means 'curved seta').\")\n    print(f\"   - Capsule Position: This causes its capsule to be {species_2_capsule}.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Therefore, at a glance, you can distinguish them by checking if the capsule is upright (Grimmia montana) or nodding (Grimmia curviseta).\")\n\n# Execute the function to provide the explanation.\nexplain_grimmia_difference()\n```\n<<<The main difference is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, which keeps the capsule upright and immersed in the leaves, whereas *Grimmia curviseta* has a distinctly curved seta, which causes its capsule to nod or hang downwards.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta that helps distinguish both species at a glance?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
