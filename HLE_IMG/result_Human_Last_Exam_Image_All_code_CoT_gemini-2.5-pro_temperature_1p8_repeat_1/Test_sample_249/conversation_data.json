    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. The image shows the underside of a fish, specifically its adhesive disc or sucker. This specialized organ allows the fish to cling to rocks and other surfaces in areas with strong water movement. The fine, honeycomb-like pattern is characteristic of the papillae on this sucker. The fish belongs to the family known as clingfishes.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to output the scientific name for this family of fish.\n\n```python\ndef get_scientific_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the scientific name of the animal identified in the image.\n  The animal is a clingfish, and the image shows its adhesive disc.\n  \"\"\"\n  scientific_name = \"Gobiesocidae\"\n  print(f\"Yes, there is an animal in the image. It is a fish from the family of clingfishes.\")\n  print(f\"Its scientific family name is: {scientific_name}\")\n\nget_scientific_name()\n```\n<<<Gobiesocidae>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Is there an animal in this image?
