    "This task requires a step-by-step analysis of various spectroscopic data (Mass Spectrometry, IR, ¹³C NMR, DEPT-135, ¹H NMR, and HSQC) to deduce the structure of an unknown organic compound and provide its IUPAC name.\n\nHere is the plan for my analysis:\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** Determine the molecular formula and key fragments from the molecular ion peak and fragmentation pattern.\n2.  **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** Calculate the DoU from the molecular formula to infer the presence of rings or double/triple bonds.\n3.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** Identify the main functional groups present in the molecule.\n4.  **¹³C NMR & DEPT-135:** Determine the number and type of carbon atoms (C, CH, CH₂, CH₃).\n5.  **¹H NMR:** Determine the types of protons, their relative numbers, and their connectivity through splitting patterns.\n6.  **HSQC:** Correlate proton signals with their directly attached carbon signals to confirm connectivity.\n7.  **Structure Assembly & IUPAC Naming:** Combine all the pieces of information to build the final structure and determine its systematic IUPAC name.\n\nBased on this plan, I will provide a Python script that walks through the analysis and prints the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Redirect stdout to capture the print output for the final answer format\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\ndef analyze_compound_and_determine_iupac_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n    The analysis is printed step-by-step.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analysis of Mass Spectrum (MS)\")\n    mw = 135\n    print(f\"The molecular ion peak (M+) is observed at m/z {mw}.\")\n    print(f\"The odd molecular weight of {mw} indicates the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms (Nitrogen Rule), most likely one.\")\n    print(\"A significant fragment peak at m/z 91 is characteristic of a benzyl cation ([C6H5CH2]+), suggesting a benzyl or substituted benzyl group.\")\n    print(\"If the formula is C9H13N, the calculated molecular weight is (9 * 12.01) + (13 * 1.008) + (1 * 14.007) = 135.21.
