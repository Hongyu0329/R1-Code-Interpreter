# The image contains a program in the Piet programming language.
# This is a widely recognized example program that prints "Hello, world!".
# The task requires us to take this output, reverse it, and convert it to lowercase.

# The original string output by the program.
original_string = "Hello, world!"

# Reverse the original string.
# In Python, [::-1] is a common idiom for reversing a sequence.
reversed_string = original_string[::-1]

# Convert the reversed string to all lowercase letters.
final_string = reversed_string.lower()

# Print the final result to the console.
print(final_string)
