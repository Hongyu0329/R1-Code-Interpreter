    "To determine the molecular formula of the product, we need to trace the chemical transformations through the three reaction steps.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Starting Material:**\n    The starting material is a bicyclic compound with a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group and a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group on the nitrogen. The core structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one system (a lactam), which is consistent with the subsequent reaction chemistry.\n    *   The bicyclic core with the CF3 group has the formula C7H5F3NO.\n    *   The PMB group (-CH2-C6H4-OCH3) has the formula C8H9O.\n    *   Adding these together, the starting material has the formula **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n2.  **Step 1: Starting Material → Intermediate 1**\n    *   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a standard oxidative deprotection of the PMB group from a nitrogen atom. The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom (H) is added to the nitrogen.\n    *   **Change in formula:** (- C8H9O) + (+ H)\n    *   **Intermediate 1 Formula:** C(15-8) H(14-9+1) F3 N1 O(2-1) = **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n3.  **Step 2: Intermediate 1 → Intermediate 2**\n    *   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 (Palladium on carbon with hydrogen gas).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. The C=C double bond in the bicyclic ring is reduced to a C-C single bond. This process adds two hydrogen atoms (H2) to the molecule.\n    *   **Change in formula:** + H2\n    *   **Intermediate 2 Formula:** C7 H(6+2) F3 N1 O1 = **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n4.  **Step 3: Intermediate 2 → Product**\n    *   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 °C (strong acid and heat).\n    *   **Reaction:** Intermediate 2 is a lactam (a cyclic amide). Under these conditions, the lactam undergoes acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. The amide bond breaks, opening the ring, and one molecule of water (H2O) is incorporated. The carbonyl group becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and the nitrogen atom becomes an amine (-NH2).\n    *   **Change in formula:** + H2O\n    *   **Product Formula:** C7 H(8+2) F3 N1 O(1+1) = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\nThe final product is a cyclopentane ring substituted with an amino group, a carboxylic acid group, and a trifluoromethyl group. Its molecular formula is C7H10F3NO2.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the molecular formula of the final product by simulating these transformations.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef format_formula(atoms, name):\n    \"\"\"Formats a dictionary of atom counts into a chemical formula string.\"\"\"\n    # Standard order of elements in a formula: C, H, then alphabetical for the rest.\n    formula = \"\"\n    if 'C' in atoms and atoms['C'] > 0:\n        formula += f\"C{atoms['C']}\"\n    if 'H' in atoms and atoms['H'] > 0:\n        formula += f\"H{atoms['H']}\"\n    \n    other_elements = sorted([el for el in atoms if el not in ['C', 'H']])\n    \n    for el in other_elements:\n        if atoms[el] > 0:\n            formula += f\"{el}{atoms[el]}\"\n            \n    print(f\"{name}: {formula}\")\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product through the reaction sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 0: Define the starting material's molecular formula.\n    # The bicyclic core is C7H5F3NO.
