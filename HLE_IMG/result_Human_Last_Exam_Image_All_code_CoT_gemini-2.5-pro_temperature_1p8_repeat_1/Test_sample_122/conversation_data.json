    "Of course, I can help you with this chemistry problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the synthesis to identify the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Amine Protection**\n    *   The starting material is the amino acid **L-tryptophan**.\n    *   The reagents are **CbzCl (benzyl chloroformate)** and **NaOH**. This reaction protects the primary amine group (-NH₂) with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group. This is a standard procedure in peptide synthesis to prevent the amine from reacting in subsequent steps.\n    *   **Intermediate 1** is **N-Cbz-L-tryptophan**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Amide Coupling**\n    *   Intermediate 1, which has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), is reacted with **O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl·H₂NO-Bn)**.\n    *   **EDC** and **HOBt** are coupling agents that activate the carboxylic acid, making it reactive towards the amine. **Et₃N** is a base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt and facilitate the reaction.\n    *   This reaction forms an amide-like bond between the carboxylic acid of tryptophan and the O-benzylhydroxylamine, creating a protected hydroxamic acid.\n    *   **Intermediate 2** is **N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Deprotection**\n    *   Intermediate 2 is treated with **H₂ (hydrogen gas)** and **10% Pd/C (palladium on carbon)**. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction.\n    *   This reaction is a common method for removing benzyl-based protecting groups. It will cleave both the **Cbz group** from the amine and the **benzyl group** from the hydroxamate oxygen.\n    *   The N-Cbz group is removed, regenerating the free amine (-NH₂).\n    *   The O-benzyl group is removed, converting the protected hydroxamate (-CONHOBn) into a hydroxamic acid (-CONHOH).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final product has the original L-tryptophan backbone, but the carboxylic acid group has been converted into a hydroxamic acid group. Therefore, the product is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is the Python code to output the name of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef get_product_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns the name of the final product from the given reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: N-protection of Tryptophan with Cbz group.\n    # Product: N-Cbz-Tryptophan\n    \n    # Step 2: Amide coupling with O-benzylhydroxylamine.\n    # Product: N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate\n    \n    # Step 3: Catalytic hydrogenation to remove both Cbz and Benzyl protecting groups.\n    # Final Product: The carboxylic acid is converted to a hydroxamic acid.\n    \n    product_name = \"Tryptophan hydroxamate\"\n    print(product_name)\n\nget_product_name()\n```\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
