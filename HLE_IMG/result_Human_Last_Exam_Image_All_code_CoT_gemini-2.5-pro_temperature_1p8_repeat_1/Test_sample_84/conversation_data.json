    "I have analyzed the key heraldic elements in the provided coat of arms. The design consists of a shield divided horizontally (per fess), with a blue field on top charged with a yellow crescent moon, and a yellow field on the bottom charged with a black crab. These specific elements are characteristic of the coat of arms of a particular European town.\n\nBased on this analysis, the city with this coat of arms is Hrvatska Kostajnica in Croatia. The provided image is a stylized representation, but the core symbols and their arrangement directly correspond to the official insignia of this town.\n\nHere is the Python code to provide the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_city_with_similar_coat_of_arms():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the city whose coat of arms\n    is very similar to the one described.\n\n    The coat of arms in the image features:\n    - A shield split horizontally (per fess).\n    - Top half: A blue field (azure) with a golden crescent moon (crescent or).\n    - Bottom half: A golden field (or) with a black crab (crab sable).\n\n    This combination of elements is the specific design of the coat of arms\n    for the town of Hrvatska Kostajnica, Croatia.\n    \"\"\"\n    city_name = \"Hrvatska Kostajnica\"\n    print(f\"The city with a very similar coat of arms is: {city_name}\")\n\nfind_city_with_similar_coat_of_arms()\n```\n<<<Hrvatska Kostajnica>>>"
