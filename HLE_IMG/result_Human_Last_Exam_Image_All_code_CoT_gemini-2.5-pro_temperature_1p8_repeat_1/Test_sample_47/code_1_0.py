# According to the circuit diagram, the wire carrying the current 'I' connects
# the 41V source directly to the node above the 29 Ohm resistor.
# This means the voltage at that node is 41V.
# This setup shorts out resistors R1, R2, R3, and R4, as there is no potential
# difference across them.
# Therefore, the current 'I' is the current that flows into that node and then
# flows out through the 29 Ohm resistor to the ground.
# We can calculate this current using Ohm's Law: I = V / R.
# In this case, V is the source voltage and R is R5 (29 Ohms).
