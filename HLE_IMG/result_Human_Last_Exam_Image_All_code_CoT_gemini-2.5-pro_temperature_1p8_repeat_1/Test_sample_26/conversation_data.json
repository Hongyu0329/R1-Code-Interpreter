    "To determine the Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, we must analyze the notes within the context of the piece's harmony. Here is a step-by-step plan for the analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Measure and Notes:** Locate measure 30 in the score. The notes played in this measure are G# and B in the left hand (bass clef), and a melodic figure of C#, G#, E, G# in the right hand (treble clef).\n2.  **Determine the Harmonic Context:** While the sonata's home key is C minor, this section has modulated. The chord in measure 30 strongly leads to the A minor chord in measure 31. This creates a local key center of A minor.\n3.  **Analyze the Chord:** The foundational notes of the chord are G# and B, played in the bass. G# is the leading tone (the 7th degree) of the A minor scale. The notes G# and B are the root and third of a G-sharp diminished triad (G#–B–D). In this context, the triad functions as the leading-tone chord.\n4.  **Formulate the Roman Numeral:** A diminished triad built on the leading tone of a minor key is represented by the Roman numeral **vii°**. Since the bass note is the root of the chord (G#), it is in root position.\n\nThe following Python code outlines this analysis and prints the final result.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_beethoven_pathetique_m30():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides a step-by-step harmonic analysis of measure 30\n    from Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, 1st movement, and prints\n    the resulting Roman numeral.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the musical context\n    piece = \"Beethoven, Piano Sonata No. 8 'Pathetique', Op. 13, Mvt. 1\"\n    measure = 30\n    \n    # Step 2: Identify the notes and the local key\n    # The notes in measure 30 are G#, B, C#, E.\n    # The chord resolves to A minor in measure 31, establishing a local key.\n    local_key = \"A minor\"\n    tonic = \"A\"\n    \n    # Step 3: Analyze the chord's root and quality\n    # The bass note is G#, which is the leading tone (7th degree) of A minor.\n    # The structural harmony is a G-sharp diminished triad (G#-B-D).\n    chord_root_note = \"G#\"\n    scale_degree_number = 7\n    scale_degree_name = \"Leading Tone\"\n    chord_quality = \"diminished\"\n    \n    # Step 4: Construct the Roman numeral\n    # A diminished triad on the leading tone is denoted by 'vii°'.\n    roman_numeral_symbol = \"vii°\"\n\n    print(f\"Harmonic Analysis of {piece}, Measure {measure}:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"1.
