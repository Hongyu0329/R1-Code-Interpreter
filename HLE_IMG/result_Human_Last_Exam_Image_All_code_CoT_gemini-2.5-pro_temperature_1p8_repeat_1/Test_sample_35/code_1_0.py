        "but an initiating step in a direct pathological cascade.\n"
        "2. Activation of Deleterious Pathways: This binding activates downstream pathways, including JNK/JUN, which leads to apoptosis (cell death), "
        "and NFÎºB, which promotes the production of proinflammatory cytokines and directly results in neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration.\n"
        "3. Predicting Disease Course: Since the over-expression of S100B actively drives the core mechanisms of disease progression, its "
        "concentration can indicate the severity and rate of this progression. Higher levels of S100B would suggest a more active disease state and likely a poorer prognosis. "
        "Therefore, it provides predictive information about the future course of the neurological disorder, which is the function of a prognostic marker."
