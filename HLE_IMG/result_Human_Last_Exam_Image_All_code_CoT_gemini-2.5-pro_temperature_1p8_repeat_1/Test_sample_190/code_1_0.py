    """
    This function demonstrates the concept of resampling to address class imbalance,
    which is the most cost-effective solution for the given problem.

    The HMM shows that video processing functions are a minority class. For example,
    in State 1, 'setAudioSource' has a probability of 0.82, while 'setVideoSource'
    is only 0.17. This imbalance leads to poor recommendation performance for video tasks.

    Resampling (specifically oversampling the minority class) artificially balances
    the training data, allowing the model to learn the patterns of the minority class
    (video processing) more effectively. This is a computationally cheap and effective
    method that doesn't require expensive new data collection or complex model changes.

    This code simulates a dataset of processing actions and shows how to balance it.
