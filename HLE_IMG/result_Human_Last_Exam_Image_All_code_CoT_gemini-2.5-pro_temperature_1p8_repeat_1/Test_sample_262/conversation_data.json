    "Answering this question requires analyzing the chemical structures of the four iridium complexes and relating them to their expected stability, which correlates with their operational lifetime in a light-emitting device.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking process:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structures**: First, I will carefully examine the molecular structure of each of the four complexes. They are all cationic Iridium(III) complexes, a class of compounds widely used as phosphorescent emitters.\n    *   **Metal Center**: All four have an Iridium (Ir) metal center.\n    *   **Ligands**: They all share the same ancillary bidentate ligand, which is a 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (a type of N^N ligand). The main difference lies in the two cyclometalating ligands (C^N ligands) and their relative arrangement (stereochemistry).\n    *   **Cyclometalating Ligands**:\n        *   **Complexes 1 and 2** both use two molecules of 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine as their C^N ligands. These ligands have two fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring.\n        *   **Complexes 3 and 4** both use two molecules of 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. These ligands have only one fluorine atom on the phenyl ring.\n    *   **Stereochemistry**:\n        *   **Complexes 1 and 3** are isomers where the two carbon atoms bonded to the iridium (from the phenyl rings) are *cis* to each other (the C-Ir-C angle is about 90°). This is often called the *C,C-cis* isomer.\n        *   **Complexes 2 and 4** are isomers where the two carbon atoms bonded to the iridium are *trans* to each other (the C-Ir-C angle is about 180°). This is the *C,C-trans* isomer.\n\n2.  **Identify Factors Affecting Lifetime**: The operational lifetime of these emitters in devices is primarily limited by their chemical and electrochemical stability. Two key structural factors influence this stability:\n    *   **Fluorination**: Fluorine atoms are strongly electron-withdrawing. Attaching them to the phenyl ring of the cyclometalating ligand makes the complex more difficult to oxidize. Since oxidative degradation is a common failure mechanism, more fluorination generally leads to higher stability and thus a *longer* lifetime. Based on this, complexes 1 and 2 (with two F atoms per ligand) would be expected to be more stable than complexes 3 and 4 (with one F atom per ligand).\n    *   **Stereochemistry and the *trans* effect**: The carbon-metal bond (Ir-C) is a strong covalent bond with a significant *trans* influence, meaning it electronically weakens the bond of the ligand positioned directly opposite to it.\n        *   In the **C,C-cis isomers (1 and 3)**, each strong Ir-C bond is opposite a weaker Iridium-Nitrogen (Ir-N) bond. This is a relatively stable arrangement.\n        *   In the **C,C-trans isomers (2 and 4)**, the two strong Ir-C bonds are positioned directly opposite each other. This creates a \"head-to-head\" situation where the two strong *trans*-influencing ligands compete for the same metal orbitals, mutually weakening each other. This C,C-trans arrangement is known to be thermodynamically less stable than the C,C-cis arrangement.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Conclude**: Comparing the two factors, the destabilizing effect of the C,C-trans geometry is generally more significant than the stabilizing effect of an additional fluorine atom. Complexes with the C,C-trans arrangement are inherently less stable and more prone to decomposition, which would lead to a shorter operational lifetime in an LEC.\n\n    *   Complexes 1 and 3 are the stable *C,C-cis* isomers.\n    *   Complexes 2 and 4 are the unstable *C,C-trans* isomers.\n\n    Therefore, complexes 2 and 4 are the ones expected to show shorter lifetimes.\n\n```python\ndef solve_lec_lifetime():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four Iridium(III) complexes to determine which have shorter lifetimes in LECs.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the structure of the four Iridium(III) complexes.\")\n    print(\"All complexes are [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+ cations.\")\n    print(\" - Complexes 1 & 2 use 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine as the C^N ligand.\")\n    print(\" - Complexes 3 & 4 use 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine as the C^N ligand.\")\n    print(\" - Complexes 1 & 3 are C,C-cis isomers, where the two Ir-C bonds are cis to each other.\")\n    print(\" - Complexes 2 & 4 are C,C-trans isomers, where the two Ir-C bonds are trans to each other.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Identifying factors that affect the lifetime of these emitters.\")\n    print(\"The stability of the complex is a key factor for its lifetime.
