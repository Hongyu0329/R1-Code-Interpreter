    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to determine its title and composer.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Musical Analysis**\n*   **Key Signature:** The key signature has one flat (B♭). This indicates the key of F major or its relative minor, D minor.\n*   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 'C', which stands for common time or 4/4.\n*   **First Chord:** The first chord is labeled \"F-\", which means F minor. The use of a minor tonic chord confirms that the piece is in the key of F minor.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Melody**\nLet's examine the opening melodic phrase in the first measure:\n*   The notes are C, F, G, and A♭.\n*   In the context of F minor, these notes are the 5th, root, 2nd, and minor 3rd of the scale. This opening melodic figure is very distinctive and a strong clue.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Chord Progression**\nThe chord progression is a critical element for identifying a jazz standard.\n*   **A Section (first 8 bars):**\n    *   `| F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7 |`\n    *   `| C7 | F- | 1. C7 || 2. C7 F- |`\n    *   This progression is highly characteristic. It starts on the tonic minor (F-), then moves chromatically down through a series of chords (`E-7b5`, `Eb-6`). The `Dbmaj7` to `G7` to `C7` is also a unique turnaround leading back to the tonic.\n*   **B Section / Bridge (middle 8 bars):**\n    *   `| D-7b5 | G7 | C7 | F7 |`\n    *   `| Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab | G C7 |`\n    *   This section features a series of secondary dominants and ii-V progressions. Notably, the `Bb-7` to `Eb7` progression resolves to `Ab`, which is the relative major key of F minor. Modulating to the relative major for the bridge is a very common technique in songs with a minor-key A section. The `G C7` at the end serves as a turnaround to lead back to the F minor tonic for the final A section.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of the Form**\n*   The piece is structured into sections. The use of a first and second ending after the first 8 bars, followed by a contrasting 8-bar bridge, and then a return to the initial theme, is indicative of a 32-bar AABA form.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesizing the Clues and Identifying the Song**\n*   **Melody:** The opening four notes (C, F, G, A♭) perfectly match the melody for the lyrics \"What is this thing...\"\n*   **Chords:** The chord progression, particularly the chromatic downward motion in the A section (`F-`, `E-7b5`, `Eb-6`) and the modulation to the relative major in the B section, is the hallmark progression of \"What Is This Thing Called Love?\". While the standard is often played in C minor, this lead sheet is simply a transposition to F minor.\n*   **Composer:** \"What Is This Thing Called Love?\" is a famous song written by the American composer and songwriter Cole Porter for the 1929 musical \"Wake Up and Dream\".\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the combined evidence from the melody, chord progression, and form, the piece of music is unmistakably the jazz standard \"What Is This Thing Called Love?\" by Cole Porter.\n\n<<<Title: What Is This Thing Called Love?, Composer: Cole Porter>>>"
