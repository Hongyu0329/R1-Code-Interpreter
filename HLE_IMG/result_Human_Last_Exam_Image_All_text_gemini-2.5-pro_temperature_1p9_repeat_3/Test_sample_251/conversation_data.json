    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the ECG rhythm strip to determine the longest R-R interval.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the longest R-R interval in seconds. The R-R interval is the time between the peaks of two consecutive QRS complexes (the R waves).\n\n2.  **Determine the ECG Calibration:** The top left corner of the ECG strip provides the calibration settings:\n    *   **Paper Speed:** 25 mm/sec. This is the most crucial piece of information for time measurements.\n    *   **Amplitude:** 1 cm/mV (or 10 mm/mV). This is for voltage measurement and not needed for this question.\n\n3.  **Calculate Time per Grid Square:** The ECG is printed on a grid. Using the paper speed of 25 mm/sec, we can calculate the time duration represented by each square:\n    *   **Small square:** Each small square is 1 mm wide.\n        *   Time = 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n    *   **Large square:** Each large square is 5 mm wide (composed of 5 small squares).\n        *   Time = 5 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.20 seconds.\n\n4.  **Visually Scan the ECG for the Longest Interval:**\n    *   The ECG shows several strips of what appears to be Lead II.\n    *   Most of the rhythm is relatively regular and fast (a form of sinus tachycardia). Let's measure a typical interval: In the top strip, the R waves are separated by approximately 3 large squares (15 small squares). This corresponds to 3 * 0.2s = 0.6 seconds. The heart rate is roughly 60 / 0.6 = 100 bpm.\n    *   By visually scanning all the strips, a significant pause or long interval stands out. This pause is located on the fourth horizontal strip from the top, starting after the fourth QRS complex. This is clearly the longest gap between two consecutive beats on the entire tracing.\n\n5.  **Measure the Longest Interval:**\n    *   Focus on the pause identified in the previous step.\n    *   Identify the peak of the R wave just before the pause and the peak of the R wave that ends the pause.\n    *   Count the number of large squares between these two R wave peaks. The R wave just before the pause aligns almost perfectly with a thick vertical grid line. The R wave that ends the pause also aligns almost perfectly with another thick vertical grid line further down the strip.\n    *   Counting the large (5 mm) squares between these two points reveals there are exactly **7 large squares**.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Duration in Seconds:**\n    *   Now, convert the measurement in large squares to time in seconds using the calculation from step 3.\n    *   Duration = (Number of large squares) × (Time per large square)\n    *   Duration = 7 large squares × 0.20 seconds/large square\n    *   Duration = 1.4 seconds.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   Always confirm the paper speed (25 mm/sec is standard, but 50 mm/sec is also used).\n*   Carefully locate the exact peaks of the R waves for an accurate measurement.\n*   Systematically scan the entire strip to ensure you have found the absolute longest interval, not just a locally long one. In this case, the pause is visually very distinct and much longer than any other R-R interval on the strip.\n*   The beat that terminates the long pause has a different shape (morphology) from the preceding beats, suggesting it's an escape beat (likely ventricular), but this does not change the measurement of the R-R interval itself.\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nThe longest interval spans 7 large squares.\n7 large squares * 0.2 seconds/large square = 1.4 seconds.\n\n<<<1.4>>>"
