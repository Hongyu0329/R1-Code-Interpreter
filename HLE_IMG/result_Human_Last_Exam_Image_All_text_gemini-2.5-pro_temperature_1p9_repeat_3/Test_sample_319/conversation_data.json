    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided information:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements.**\nThe image consists of two plots, one above the other, likely representing the same event over the same time period.\n*   **Top Plot (Spectrogram):** This plot shows the frequency content of a sound over time (time on the x-axis, frequency on the y-axis, and intensity as color). We see a distinct, narrow horizontal line, which represents a pure tone of a constant frequency. This line is interrupted in the middle. At the point of interruption, there is a short, vertical smear of blue, which represents a burst of sound containing a wide range of frequencies, characteristic of noise (like a cough, static, or a buzz). The pure tone then resumes after the noise burst. Crucially, the spectrogram shows that the tone is *physically absent* during the noise burst.\n*   **Bottom Plot (Waveform):** This plot shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time. Unlike the spectrogram, the wave is continuous. It begins as a simple, regular sine wave (representing the pure tone). In the middle section, corresponding to the noise burst in the spectrogram, the waveform becomes much more complex, but it does not drop to zero. It appears to be a superposition of the original sine wave and a more chaotic noise signal. After this complex section, the waveform returns to being a simple sine wave. This suggests that perceptually, the tone is heard *continuously* through the noise.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the textual description.**\n*   **\"illusion... similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity\"**: The Necker Cube is a famous visual illusion where a 2D drawing can be perceived as a 3D cube from two different perspectives. The brain switches between these two interpretations. The comparison suggests the phenomenon in question is a perceptual illusion where the brain actively interprets an ambiguous sensory input, filling in missing information to create a coherent perception. The ambiguity here is: did the tone stop and a separate noise occur, or was the tone continuous and simply obscured by noise?\n*   **\"reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\"**: This points to a top-down cognitive process that our brains perform automatically. This ability is fundamental to our perception, helping us make sense of a world where sensory information is often incomplete or corrupted. For example, understanding a conversation in a noisy room requires the brain to \"fill in\" parts of words that are masked by other sounds.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the visual and textual clues.**\n*   The core of the illusion is the discrepancy between the physical stimulus (tone -> noise -> tone, with a gap in the tone) and the subjective perception (a continuous tone with noise momentarily layered on top).\n*   The brain perceives continuity where there is none in the physical signal. It \"fills in\" the missing part of the tone during the noise burst.\n*   This act of perceptual completion or \"filling-in\" based on context is a classic auditory illusion.\n*   This phenomenon was famously studied by Richard M. Warren. He found that when a phoneme (a basic unit of speech) in a recorded sentence was removed and replaced with a burst of noise (like a cough), listeners not only perceived the sentence as complete but often couldn't even identify where the cough had occurred.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the name of the phenomenon.**\nBased on the analysis, the illusion described and depicted is the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**. Although the image uses a simple tone instead of a speech phoneme, the underlying principle is identical, and \"Phonemic Restoration Effect\" is the most common and widely recognized name for this perceptual phenomenon of filling in missing auditory information that has been masked by noise.\n\n<<<Phonemic Restoration Effect>>>"
