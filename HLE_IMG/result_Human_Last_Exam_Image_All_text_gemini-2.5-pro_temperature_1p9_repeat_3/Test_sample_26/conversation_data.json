    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Signature:** The first step is to establish the tonic key of the movement. Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8, \"Pathétique,\" first movement (Grave; Allegro di molto e con brio), is in the key of **C minor**. The key signature shown in the score has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭), which corresponds to either E-flat major or C minor. The strong presence of C minor chords and G major (dominant) chords throughout confirms C minor as the home key.\n\n2.  **Locate Measure 30:** The measure in question is measure 30. Looking at the provided sheet music, we can find the measure number '28' marking the beginning of a line. Measure 30 is the third measure on that line, and it is helpfully circled in the image.\n\n3.  **Identify the Notes in Measure 30:** We need to look at all the notes being played in both the left hand (bass clef) and the right hand (treble clef) within this measure.\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays a single G (below middle C) as a half note, holding it for the entire measure. This note acts as a pedal tone, which is a strong indicator of the chord's root.\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The right hand plays a continuous line of sixteenth notes. The pitches are, in order: D, G♯, B, D, then C, G♯, B, C.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Harmony:** Now we combine the notes from both hands to determine the underlying chord and its function.\n    *   The bass note is **G**.\n    *   The notes in the right hand are **B, C, D, G♯**.\n    *   Let's identify the chord tones versus the non-chord tones. The bass note G is almost certainly the root of the chord, especially since it's functioning as a pedal. In the key of C minor, G is the fifth scale degree, the dominant.\n    *   The major dominant chord (V) in C minor is a **G major triad**, which consists of the notes **G-B-D**.\n    *   Looking at the notes in measure 30, we can clearly find all the members of the G major triad: G (in the bass), B, and D (in the right hand).\n    *   This means the two remaining notes, **C** and **G♯**, are non-chord tones. They serve to add color and tension.\n        *   The **G♯** acts as a chromatic lower neighbor or leading tone to the A that appears in the following measure (measure 31). This creates strong melodic motion and increases harmonic tension.\n        *   The **C** can be analyzed as an appoggiatura (a non-chord tone that is approached by leap and resolved by step, usually downward) to the B natural. Its presence creates a dissonant 4th above the bass G, which resolves to the 3rd (B).\n    *   Despite the presence of these chromatic non-chord tones, the fundamental harmony of the entire measure is clearly built on the G major triad.\n\n5.  **Determine the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   The chord is a G major triad.\n    *   The key is C minor.\n    *   G is the fifth scale degree of C.\n    *   A major triad built on the fifth degree is the **Dominant chord**.\n    *   In Roman numeral analysis, the dominant chord is represented by the numeral **V**. Since the root of the chord (G) is in the bass, the chord is in root position.\n\nTherefore, the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 is V.\n\n<<<V>>>"
