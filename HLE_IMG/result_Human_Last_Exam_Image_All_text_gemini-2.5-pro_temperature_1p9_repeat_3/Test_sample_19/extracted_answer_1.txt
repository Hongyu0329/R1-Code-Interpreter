1. The music modulates to **F# minor**. This is established by the C#7 chord (the V7 of F# minor) on the downbeat of measure 12.
2. F# minor is the **subdominant minor (iv)** of the home key, C# minor. This is a common modulation to a closely-related key, providing harmonic variety.
3. The chord is a **B Major triad**. Its complete and accurate Roman numeral analysis recognizes its function as a pivot chord: it is the **Major Subdominant (IV) in the new key of F# minor**, and is arrived at from its context as the non-diatonic **Major Subtonic (VII) in the old key of C# minor.**
