    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the city with a coat of arms similar to the one in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the main components of the coat of arms in the image.**\n*   **The Shield (Escutcheon):** This is the central element. It is a classic heater shield shape.\n*   **Shield Division:** The shield is divided horizontally into two fields, a practice known in heraldry as \"per fess\".\n*   **Upper Field (Chief):** The top half has a blue background (azure) and features a single gold crescent moon (or).\n*   **Lower Field (Base):** The bottom half has a gold/yellow background (or) and features a prominent black crab (sable).\n*   **The Crown (Coronet):** Above the shield is a silver crown with gold accents and jewels. It has floral-like points (fleurons). This type of crown often signifies nobility or city status.\n*   **The Wreath:** The shield is flanked by two distinct branches tied at the bottom.\n    *   **Left Branch (Dexter side):** This is an olive branch, identifiable by its long, slender green leaves and black olives.\n    *   **Right Branch (Sinister side):** This is an oak branch, identifiable by its lobed leaves and acorns.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate a search based on the most distinctive elements.**\nThe most unique combination of features is the crab, the crescent moon, the blue and gold shield, and the specific olive and oak branches. A search for \"coat of arms with crab and moon blue and gold\" or \"coat of arms with olive and oak branches\" would be a good starting point.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the image elements with known coats of arms.**\n*   A search using the key elements leads directly to the coat of arms of the city of **Biograd na Moru**, located in Croatia.\n*   Let's compare the features of the coat of arms of Biograd na Moru with the image provided:\n    *   **Shield:** The official coat of arms of Biograd na Moru is divided horizontally (\"per fess\"). **This matches.**\n    *   **Fields and Charges:** The upper field is blue (azure) with a crescent, and the lower field is gold (or) with a black crab (sable). This is a **perfect match**. (Note: In some official blazons, the crescent is described as silver/argent, but gold/or is a common artistic variation, and many historical representations show it as gold).\n    *   **Wreath:** The greater (full) coat of arms of Biograd na Moru is officially described as being flanked by an olive branch on the left and an oak branch on the right. This is an **exact match**. The olive branch symbolizes the Mediterranean location and peace, while the oak branch symbolizes strength and the Slavic people.\n    *   **Crown:** The coat of arms of Biograd na Moru is topped with a mural crown, which is typical for a city. The crown in the image is a highly stylized and ornate version, but its presence and function are consistent with the official heraldry of a city.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion.**\nThe image provided is a detailed and realistic artistic interpretation of the full or \"greater\" coat of arms of the city of Biograd na Moru in Croatia. Every key heraldic element—the divided shield, the crab and crescent, the blue and gold colors, and the specific olive and oak branches—corresponds directly to the official symbols of this city.\n\n<<<Biograd na Moru>>>"
