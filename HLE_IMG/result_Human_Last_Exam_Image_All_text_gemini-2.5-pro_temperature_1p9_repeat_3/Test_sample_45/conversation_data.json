    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Rotational Symmetry**\nRotational symmetry means that if you rotate an object around a central point by a certain angle, it will look exactly the same as it did before the rotation. The \"order\" of rotational symmetry is the number of times the object looks identical during a full 360-degree rotation. For example, a square has 4-fold rotational symmetry because it looks the same after rotations of 90°, 180°, 270°, and 360°. We are looking for the highest order of rotational symmetry present in the tiling pattern.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Key Shapes and Motifs in the Tiling**\nCarefully observe the repeating pattern in the image. We can identify several key components:\n*   **Dark Blue Polygons:** These are regular heptagons (7-sided polygons).\n*   **Star-like Motifs:** There are star-like shapes formed by seven dark orange, thin, rhombus-like tiles meeting at a central point.\n*   **Other Tiles:** There are also light orange squares and light orange irregular pentagons that fill the spaces between the heptagons and stars.\n\n**Step 3: Test Potential Centers of Rotation**\nThe centers of highly symmetric shapes or motifs are good candidates for centers of rotation for the entire pattern.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: The center of a dark blue heptagon.**\n    A regular heptagon itself has 7-fold rotational symmetry. Let's see if the surrounding pattern also respects this symmetry. The blue heptagon is surrounded by a ring of 7 identical light-orange pentagonal tiles. Rotating the entire pattern by 360/7 degrees around the center of the heptagon will map the heptagon onto itself and will move each of the surrounding pentagons into the position of its neighbor. Looking further out, this rotation also correctly maps all other tiles (squares, other heptagons, etc.) onto identical tiles. Thus, the center of each blue heptagon is a point of 7-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n*   **Candidate 2: The center of a star-like motif.**\n    Let's consider the center of one of the stars made of seven dark orange rhombi. This star shape itself clearly has 7-fold rotational symmetry. The star is surrounded by 7 light-orange squares. If we rotate the entire pattern by 360/7 degrees around the star's center, the star maps onto itself, and each of the 7 squares moves to the position of its neighbor. This symmetry continues throughout the entire pattern. Therefore, the center of each star is also a point of 7-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 4: Check for Other Symmetries**\nLet's check for other possible rotational symmetries.\n*   **4-fold symmetry:** Consider the center of a light orange square. If we rotate by 90° (360/4), the square maps to itself. However, the tiles at its corners do not match up. For instance, a corner where a blue heptagon is located would rotate to a corner where a light-orange pentagon is located. Since these shapes are different, there is no 4-fold symmetry.\n*   **Other symmetries (2, 3, 5, 6, 8-fold, etc.):** While the pattern does have centers of 2-fold symmetry (e.g., at the center of the squares), the question asks for \"the\" rotational symmetry, which usually implies the highest order of symmetry found in the pattern. There are no obvious motifs or tile arrangements that suggest 3, 5, 6, 8-fold, or any higher symmetry. The most prominent and highest order of symmetry is clearly 7-fold.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe analysis shows that the tiling has multiple centers of 7-fold rotational symmetry. Since 7 is the highest order of rotational symmetry that can be found in the pattern, this is the rotational symmetry of the tiling. The existence of 7-fold symmetry indicates this is an aperiodic tiling, as such symmetry is forbidden in periodic crystals (crystallographic restriction theorem).\n\n<<<7>>>"
