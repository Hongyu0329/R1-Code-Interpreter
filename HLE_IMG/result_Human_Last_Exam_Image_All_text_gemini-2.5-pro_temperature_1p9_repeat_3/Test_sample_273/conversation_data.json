    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral centers and the main carbon chain.**\n\n1.  A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. We need to locate these centers in the molecule.\n2.  Let's identify the atoms and groups attached to each carbon in the central part of the molecule.\n    *   Let the carbon atom on the left be C2 and the one on the right be C3.\n    *   **C2** is bonded to:\n        1.  A hydroxyl group (-OH)\n        2.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        3.  The C3 atom/group\n        4.  An implicit hydrogen atom (-H) since carbon must have four bonds.\n        These four groups (-OH, -CH3, -C3 group, -H) are all different. Therefore, **C2 is a chiral center**.\n    *   **C3** is bonded to:\n        1.  The C2 atom/group\n        2.  An ethyl group (-CH2CH3)\n        3.  A methyl group (-CH3)\n        4.  An aminomethyl group (-CH2NH2)\n        These four groups are also all different. Therefore, **C3 is also a chiral center**.\n\n3.  To assign the configuration (R or S), we first need to determine the IUPAC name to correctly number the carbons.\n    *   The principal functional group is the hydroxyl group (-OH) as it has higher priority than the amino group (-NH2). The name will end in \"-ol\".\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the carbon with the -OH group (C2) must be found.\n    *   The longest chain is `CH3-CH2-(C3)-(C2)-CH3`, which is a 5-carbon chain (pentane).\n    *   We number the chain to give the -OH group the lowest possible number. Numbering from the left methyl group gives the -OH on C4. Numbering from the right methyl group (of the ethyl group) gives the -OH on C2.\n    *   So, the numbering is: `CH3(5)-CH2(4)-(C3)-(C2)-CH(1)3`. The main chain is a pentane. The -OH is on C2.\n    *   The substituents on C3 are a methyl group and an aminomethyl group.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **3-(aminomethyl)-3-methylpentan-2-ol**. The chiral centers are at C2 and C3.\n\n**Step 2: Assign priorities to the substituents on each chiral center using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.**\n\n*   **For C2:** The substituents are -OH, -C3(group), -CH3, and -H.\n    1.  Priority is determined by the atomic number of the atom directly attached to the chiral center.\n    2.  -OH (Oxygen, Z=8) -> **Priority 1**\n    3.  -C3(group) (Carbon, Z=6) -> Priority 2 (since it's bonded to three other carbons)\n    4.  -CH3 (Carbon, Z=6) -> Priority 3 (since it's bonded only to hydrogens)\n    5.  -H (Hydrogen, Z=1) -> **Priority 4**\n\n*   **For C3:** The substituents are -C2(group), -CH2NH2, -CH2CH3, and -CH3.\n    1.  All are attached via Carbon, so we look at the next atoms.\n    2.  -C2(group) is -CH(OH)CH3. The carbon is bonded to (O, C, H). Highest atomic number is O(8).\n    3.  -CH2NH2. The carbon is bonded to (N, H, H). Highest atomic number is N(7).\n    4.  -CH2CH3. The carbon is bonded to (C, H, H). Highest atomic number is C(6).\n    5.  -CH3. The carbon is bonded to (H, H, H). Highest atomic number is H(1).\n    6.  Comparing the highest atomic number for each substituent: O > N > C > H.\n    7.  Priorities are:\n        1.  -CH(OH)CH3 (C2 group) -> **Priority 1**\n        2.  -CH2NH2 -> **Priority 2**\n        3.  -CH2CH3 -> **Priority 3**\n        4.  -CH3 -> **Priority 4**\n\n**Step 3: Determine the absolute configuration (R or S) for each chiral center.**\n\n*   **Configuration of C3:**\n    1.  The lowest priority group (P4, -CH3) is on a dashed bond, meaning it points away from the viewer.\n    2.  We can directly determine the configuration by observing the sequence of the remaining groups from Priority 1 to 3.\n    3.  The groups are arranged: P1 (C2 group) is to the left, P2 (-CH2NH2) is down, and P3 (-CH2CH3) is on a wedge (towards the viewer).\n    4.  The path from P1 to P2 to P3 is **clockwise**.\n    5.  Therefore, the configuration at **C3 is R**.\n\n*   **Configuration of C2:**\n    1.  The drawing shows the bonds to -OH (P1) and -CH3 (P3) as dashed (pointing away). The bond to C3 (P2) is in the plane. For a tetrahedral carbon, the fourth bond, to the implied -H (P4), must be on a wedge (pointing towards the viewer).\n    2.  The lowest priority group (P4, -H) points towards the viewer.\n    3.  We trace the path from P1 -> P2 -> P3 and then reverse the result.\n    4.  From the viewer's perspective, P1 (-OH) is back, P2 (C3 group) is to the right, and P3 (-CH3) is also back.\n    5.  The circular path from P1 to P2 to P3 is **clockwise**.\n    6.  Since the lowest priority group (P4) is pointing towards us, we must reverse the configuration. Clockwise corresponds to R, so reversing it gives S.\n    7.  Therefore, the configuration at **C2 is S**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results.**\n\nThe absolute configuration of the molecule is (2S, 3R).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(2S, 3R)}}$.\n<<< (2S, 3R) >>>"
