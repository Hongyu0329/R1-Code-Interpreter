    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the characters on the seal:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Seal:** The image displays the face of a seal. The characters are carved in reverse so that when stamped, they appear correctly. To read the intended message, we must mentally flip the image horizontally. The script used is a form of ancient Chinese Seal Script (篆書/篆书, zhuànshū).\n\n2.  **Reading Direction:** For a four-character square seal like this, a common reading order is to read the right column from top to bottom, followed by the left column from top to bottom. Another common way is to read the top row from right to left, followed by the bottom row from right to left.\n\n3.  **Flipping the Image and Identifying Characters:**\n    After mentally flipping the seal to see the stamped impression, the layout is:\n    `貴 壽`\n    `康 富`\n\n4.  **Character by Character Analysis:**\n    *   **Top-Right Character:** This character is `貴` (guì). In Seal Script, its structure corresponds to the traditional character for \"nobility\" or \"precious.\"\n    *   **Top-Left Character:** This character is `壽` (shòu). It is a stylized form of the character for \"longevity.\"\n    *   **Bottom-Right Character:** This character is `康` (kāng). This is the character for \"health\" or \"well-being.\"\n    *   **Bottom-Left Character:** This character is `富` (fù). This is the character for \"wealth\" or \"richness.\"\n\n5.  **Reconstructing the Phrase and Converting to Simplified Chinese:**\n    The four traditional characters are `貴`, `壽`, `康`, `富`. Read in the order of top row (right-to-left) and then bottom row (right-to-left), the phrase is `貴壽康富` (guì shòu kāng fù), which is an auspicious blessing for \"Nobility, Longevity, Health, and Wealth.\"\n\n6.  **Final Simplified Characters:**\n    *   `貴` simplifies to `贵`.\n    *   `壽` simplifies to `寿`.\n    *   `康` remains `康`.\n    *   `富` remains `富`.\n\nTherefore, the character content on the seal in simplified Chinese is 贵, 寿, 康, 富.\n\n<<<贵寿康富>>>"
