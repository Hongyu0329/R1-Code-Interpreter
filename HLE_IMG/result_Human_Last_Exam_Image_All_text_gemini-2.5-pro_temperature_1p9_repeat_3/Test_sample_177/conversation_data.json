    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled).\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage reduction in total miles traveled by cars when shifting from the \"Baseline\" (Table 1) mode share to the \"Proposed\" (Table 2) mode share.\n\n**2. Identify Necessary Data and Formula**\n*   **Formula:** Percentage Reduction = [(Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT] * 100%\n*   **Key Data Points:**\n    *   The \"share of total trips\" for each distance segment (e.g., 48% for 0-3 miles).\n    *   The \"mode share\" for cars in each segment. Car travel includes two categories: \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\". We need to sum these to get the total car mode share for each segment.\n    *   The \"Average trip distance\" for each segment (1, 4, 7.5, and 20 miles).\n*   **Careful Point:** The question asks for **Vehicle** Miles Traveled (VMT), not Person Miles Traveled (PMT). Therefore, the \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" figures (2.8 and 3) are not needed for this calculation, as they relate to the number of people per vehicle, not the distance the vehicle itself travels.\n\n**3. General Calculation Approach**\nTo find the total VMT, we will calculate the VMT for each of the four distance segments and then add them together. Since the total number of trips in the system is not given, we can calculate a representative VMT \"factor\" for each scenario. This factor is essentially the average VMT per trip across all trips.\n\n*   VMT Contribution of a segment = (Share of Total Trips) × (Total Car Mode Share in Segment) × (Average Trip Distance)\n\n---\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Part A: Calculate the Baseline Car VMT Factor**\n\n1.  **Segment: 0-3 miles**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 25% (1 occupant) + 28% (>2 occupants) = 53% or 0.53\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.48 (share of trips) × 0.53 (car share) × 1 (avg miles) = **0.2544**\n\n2.  **Segment: 3-5 miles**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 38% + 43% = 81% or 0.81\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.22 (share of trips) × 0.81 (car share) × 4 (avg miles) = **0.7128**\n\n3.  **Segment: 5-10 miles**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 40% + 45% = 85% or 0.85\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.14 (share of trips) × 0.85 (car share) × 7.5 (avg miles) = **0.8925**\n\n4.  **Segment: 10+ miles**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 42% + 47% = 89% or 0.89\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.16 (share of trips) × 0.89 (car share) × 20 (avg miles) = **2.8480**\n\n5.  **Total Baseline VMT Factor:**\n    *   0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Part B: Calculate the Proposed Car VMT Factor**\n\n1.  **Segment: 0-3 miles**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 1% + 2% = 3% or 0.03\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.48 (share of trips) × 0.03 (car share) × 1 (avg miles) = **0.0144**\n\n2.  **Segment: 3-5 miles**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 8% + 19% = 27% or 0.27\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.22 (share of trips) × 0.27 (car share) × 4 (avg miles) = **0.2376**\n\n3.  **Segment: 5-10 miles**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 14% + 27% = 41% or 0.41\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.14 (share of trips) × 0.41 (car share) × 7.5 (avg miles) = **0.4305**\n\n4.  **Segment: 10+ miles**\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 16% + 33% = 49% or 0.49\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.16 (share of trips) × 0.49 (car share) × 20 (avg miles) = **1.5680**\n\n5.  **Total Proposed VMT Factor:**\n    *   0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Part C: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\n1.  **Calculate the VMT reduction:**\n    *   Baseline VMT (4.7077) - Proposed VMT (2.2505) = **2.4572**\n\n2.  **Calculate the percentage reduction:**\n    *   (Reduction / Baseline VMT) * 100% = (2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100% = 0.52195... * 100%\n    *   Rounding to one decimal place gives **52.2%**.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
