    "*   **Step 1: Identify the plant.**\n    The plant shown in the image is characterized by its distinctive leaves. The leaves are a deep green color with a striking, white or cream-colored, reticulated (net-like) pattern of veins. This unique variegation is the key feature for identification. This plant is widely recognized as *Ficus parcellii*, also known as the Clown Fig. It is sometimes classified as a variety of the Rough-leaved Fig, as *Ficus aspera* var. *parcellii*.\n\n*   **Step 2: Research the origin of the plant.**\n    The question asks for the specific island to which the plant was endemic. This requires looking into the history of its discovery and introduction into horticulture. The specific epithet \"parcellii\" often points to the person who discovered it or a related figure.\n\n*   **Step 3: Trace the history of *Ficus parcellii*.**\n    Botanical and horticultural records indicate that *Ficus parcellii* was introduced to Europe in the 1870s by the famous Veitch Nurseries of England. They received the plant from a plant collector who found it.\n\n*   **Step 4: Pinpoint the exact location of discovery.**\n    The plant was found in the garden of a missionary named Mr. Parcell. The plant was named in his honor. Further research reveals that Mr. Parcell's mission was located on a specific island in the South Pacific.\n\n*   **Step 5: Identify the island.**\n    The island where Mr. Parcell was stationed, and where this fig was discovered, is Aneityum (also spelled Aneiteum, and now officially Anatom). Aneityum is the southernmost inhabited island of Vanuatu (a nation formerly known as the New Hebrides). It is from this island that the plant was collected and introduced to the rest of the world. While its exact status in the wild is not perfectly clear, Aneityum is historically cited as its place of origin.\n\n*   **Step 6: Final Answer Formulation.**\n    Combining the steps, the plant is *Ficus parcellii*, which was discovered on the island of Aneityum in Vanuatu. Therefore, this is the island to which it was said to be endemic.\n\n<<<Aneityum>>>"
