    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Roman numeral for the circled notes in measure 8.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Key of the Piece**\nThe title of the piece is \"Fantasy in D minor\" by Mozart. The key signature at the beginning shows one flat (B♭). This signature corresponds to either F major or D minor. Given the title and the harmonic language, the key is D minor. The tonic chord (i) is D-F-A.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Specific Measure and Notes**\nThe question points to measure 8, which is labeled on the score. The circle highlights the harmony on the third and fourth beats of this measure. We need to analyze the notes in both the right hand (treble clef) and the left hand (bass clef) for these two beats.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Chord on Beat 3**\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The notes are G and B♭.\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The notes are B♭ and D.\n*   **Combined Notes:** When we combine all the notes played on the third beat, we have G, B♭, and D. These notes form a G minor triad.\n*   **Roman Numeral:** In the key of D minor, G is the fourth scale degree (the subdominant). A minor triad built on the subdominant is represented by the lowercase Roman numeral **iv**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Chord on Beat 4**\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The notes are A and C♯.\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The notes are also A and C♯.\n*   **Combined Notes:** The notes played on the fourth beat are A and C♯. These notes strongly imply an A major triad (A-C♯-E), with the fifth (E) being omitted, which is common. The C♯ is the raised 7th degree of the D minor scale (the leading tone), which creates a major dominant chord.\n*   **Roman Numeral:** In the key of D minor, A is the fifth scale degree (the dominant). A major triad built on the dominant is represented by the uppercase Roman numeral **V**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Analysis for the Entire Circled Area**\nThe circled passage contains a harmonic progression from the third beat to the fourth beat. The harmony moves from a G minor triad to an A major triad. In the context of D minor, this progression is from the subdominant to the dominant.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe accurate Roman numeral analysis for the circled notes shows a progression from the **iv** chord to the **V** chord.\n\n<<<iv - V>>>"
