    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the IUPAC name of the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   The mass spectrum shows the molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 135.\n*   The molecular weight is 135, which is an odd number. According to the nitrogen rule, this indicates the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule. Let's assume there is one nitrogen atom (N, atomic weight ≈ 14).\n*   The remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121. This mass must be from carbon and hydrogen atoms.\n*   To find a plausible molecular formula, we can test combinations of C and H that add up to 121. The formula C₉H₁₃ has a mass of (9 × 12) + (13 × 1) = 108 + 13 = 121.\n*   Therefore, a plausible molecular formula for the compound is **C₉H₁₃N**.\n*   Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation (DBE) for this formula:\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4.\n*   A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the IR Spectrum**\n*   **~3400-3300 cm⁻¹**: Weak to medium peaks suggest N-H stretching, possibly a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **>3000 cm⁻¹ (approx. 3020-3080 cm⁻¹)**: Sharp peaks are characteristic of C-H stretches of sp²-hybridized carbons, i.e., aromatic C-H bonds.\n*   **<3000 cm⁻¹ (approx. 2850-2980 cm⁻¹)**: Peaks are characteristic of C-H stretches of sp³-hybridized carbons, i.e., aliphatic C-H bonds.\n*   **~1605 cm⁻¹ and ~1450-1500 cm⁻¹**: These absorptions are typical for C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   The absence of a strong peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ rules out a carbonyl group (C=O).\n*   The IR spectrum supports the presence of a substituted benzene ring, aliphatic groups, and an amine group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra**\n*   **¹³C NMR signals**: Seven distinct signals are observed at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. Since the molecular formula is C₉H₁₃N, there must be some symmetry in the molecule.\n*   **Aromatic region (δ 100-160 ppm)**: Four signals at 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm. This pattern (4 signals for 6 carbons) is characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **DEPT-135**: This spectrum distinguishes carbon types.\n    *   Positive signals: CH and CH₃ groups.\n    *   Negative signals: CH₂ groups.\n    *   No signal: Quaternary carbons (C).\n*   The problem states there is \"one negative and five positive signals\" in the DEPT-135 spectrum.\n*   This means there are a total of 6 signals in the DEPT spectrum. Comparing this to the 7 signals in the broadband ¹³C spectrum, we can deduce that one carbon is a quaternary carbon (which doesn't appear in DEPT). The signal at **145.1 ppm** is in the aromatic region and lacks attached protons, making it the ipso-carbon (the point of attachment) of the phenyl ring.\n*   The other three aromatic signals (128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm) are positive in DEPT-135, so they are **CH** groups.\n*   **Aliphatic region (δ < 100 ppm)**: Three signals at 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm.\n    *   The DEPT-135 data indicates one is negative (a **CH₂** group) and two are positive (a **CH** and a **CH₃** group).\n    *   Typically, CH₃ signals appear furthest upfield. So, the signal at **19.2 ppm is the CH₃ group**.\n    *   The remaining signals at **49.6 ppm and 43.5 ppm** correspond to the CH and CH₂ groups.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **δ ~7.2-7.3 ppm (multiplet, integration 5.00)**: This complex signal integrating to 5 protons is definitive evidence for a **monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-)**.\n*   **δ ~1.1 ppm (doublet, integration ~3)**: A signal for 3 protons split into a doublet indicates a **CH₃ group adjacent to a CH group**.\n*   **δ ~2.7 ppm (multiplet, integration ~1)**: A signal for 1 proton confirms the **CH group** that splits the adjacent CH₃. It appears as a multiplet because it is coupled to both the CH₃ group and other neighboring protons.\n*   **δ ~2.8-2.9 ppm (multiplet, integration ~2)**: A signal for 2 protons corresponds to the **CH₂ group**.\n*   The total number of protons accounted for in the aliphatic region is 3+1+2=6. Combined with the 5 aromatic protons, we have 11 protons. The molecular formula is C₉H₁₃N, so the remaining 2 protons likely belong to the **-NH₂ group**, whose signal is often broad and may not be clearly visible or integrated accurately.\n\n**Step 5: Assemble the Structure and Use HSQC**\n*   From the analysis so far, the molecule consists of a C₆H₅- group, a -CH₂- group, a -CH- group, a -CH₃ group, and an -NH₂ group.\n*   The ¹H NMR splitting shows a `-CH-CH₃` fragment. The remaining fragments are `Ph-` , `-CH₂-` and `-NH₂`.\n*   Let's combine these pieces. Possible isomers include:\n    1.  **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**: Ph-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃. This has a CH₂, a CH, and a CH₃, consistent with the carbon types. The splitting pattern (`-CH-CH₃` fragment) is also consistent.\n    2.  **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**: Ph-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂. This also has a CH₂, a CH, and a CH₃, and a `-CH-CH₃` fragment.\n    3.  **1-phenylpropan-1-amine**: Ph-CH(NH₂)-CH₂-CH₃. This has a CH₃ triplet (coupled to CH₂), which contradicts the observed CH₃ doublet. This isomer is ruled out.\n*   **HSQC Spectrum**: This 2D NMR experiment correlates protons with the carbons they are directly bonded to. This will allow us to distinguish between the remaining isomers.\n    *   ¹H at **1.1 ppm** (3H doublet) correlates with ¹³C at **19.2 ppm**. Confirms this is the **CH₃** group.\n    *   ¹H at **~2.7 ppm** (1H multiplet) correlates with ¹³C at **49.6 ppm**. Confirms this is the **CH** group.\n    *   ¹H at **~2.8 ppm** (2H multiplet) correlates with ¹³C at **43.5 ppm**. Confirms this is the **CH₂** group.\n*   Now we assign these fragments to the remaining possible structures:\n    *   **For 1-phenylpropan-2-amine (Ph-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃)**:\n        *   The CH₂ group is benzylic (attached to Ph). Its shift is δC=43.5 ppm.\n        *   The CH group is attached to the amine (-NH₂). Its shift is δC=49.6 ppm.\n        *   This assignment is chemically sound. The carbon atom attached to the electronegative nitrogen atom (CH) is expected to be more deshielded (further downfield) than the benzylic CH₂ carbon.\n    *   **For 2-phenylpropan-1-amine (Ph-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂)**:\n        *   The CH group is benzylic. Its shift would be δC=49.6 ppm.\n        *   The CH₂ group is attached to the amine (-NH₂). Its shift would be δC=43.5 ppm.\n        *   This assignment is less likely. The carbon attached to the amine is usually significantly deshielded. Having the benzylic CH so far downfield and the C-N carbon so far upfield is inconsistent with typical chemical shift values for such structures.\n*   Based on this comprehensive analysis, the compound is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the IUPAC Name**\n*   The parent chain is the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the amine). This is a 3-carbon chain (propane).\n*   We number the chain to give the amine group the lowest possible number.\n    `Ph-C(1)H₂-C(2)H(NH₂)-C(3)H₃`\n*   The amine group is on carbon 2, making it a **propan-2-amine**.\n*   A phenyl group is attached to carbon 1.\n*   Therefore, the full IUPAC name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
