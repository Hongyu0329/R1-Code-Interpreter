    "**Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Benzene + Propanoyl chloride with AlCl₃**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation. This reaction introduces an acyl group onto the benzene ring.\n    *   **Reactants:** Benzene (the aromatic ring) and propanoyl chloride (the acyl halide).\n    *   **Catalyst:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid) activates the acyl chloride to generate a highly electrophilic acylium ion (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O).\n    *   **Mechanism:** The benzene ring attacks the acylium ion in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n    *   **Intermediate-1:** The product is propiophenone, also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one. Its structure is a phenyl group attached to a carbonyl group, which is attached to an ethyl group (C₆H₅-CO-CH₂CH₃).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Intermediate-1 (Propiophenone) + Br₂/FeBr₃**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n    *   **Reactant:** Propiophenone.\n    *   **Reagents:** Br₂ and FeBr₃. FeBr₃ is a Lewis acid that polarizes the Br-Br bond, making one bromine atom highly electrophilic (effectively \"Br⁺\").\n    *   **Directing Effect:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Such groups are deactivating towards electrophilic substitution and are *meta*-directors. This means the incoming electrophile (bromine) will add to the position meta to the acyl group.\n    *   **Intermediate-2:** The product is 3-bromopropiophenone, or 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one. This is propiophenone with a bromine atom at position 3 of the phenyl ring.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Intermediate-2 (3-bromopropiophenone) + H₂/Pd**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Catalytic Hydrogenation/Hydrogenolysis.\n    *   **Reactant:** 3-bromopropiophenone.\n    *   **Reagents:** H₂ gas and Palladium catalyst (often on charcoal, Pd/C).\n    *   **Transformations:** These conditions are strong enough to cause two reductions:\n        *   **Reduction of the Ketone:** The benzylic carbonyl group (C=O) is reduced completely to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a hydrogenolysis reaction.\n        *   **Reduction of the Aryl Halide:** The carbon-bromine bond on the aromatic ring is cleaved and replaced by a carbon-hydrogen bond (hydrogenolysis).\n    *   **Intermediate-3:** Both the bromo group and the carbonyl group are removed. Starting from 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one, both reductions yield propylbenzene (C₆H₅-CH₂CH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Step 4: Intermediate-3 (Propylbenzene) + NBS, (PhCO₂)₂, CCl₄**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Free-Radical Bromination.\n    *   **Reactant:** Propylbenzene.\n    *   **Reagents:**\n        *   NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide) is a specific reagent for providing a low, constant concentration of Br₂, which favors radical substitution over ionic reactions. It is the source of bromine for the reaction.\n        *   (PhCO₂)₂ (Benzoyl peroxide) is a radical initiator. Upon heating, it decomposes to form radicals that start the chain reaction.\n        *   CCl₄ (Carbon tetrachloride) is a non-polar solvent suitable for radical reactions.\n    *   **Selectivity:** This reaction is highly selective for substitution at the *benzylic* position. The benzylic position is the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. This is because abstraction of a benzylic hydrogen atom leads to a benzylic radical (C₆H₅-ĊH-CH₂CH₃), which is highly stabilized by resonance with the aromatic ring. This radical is much more stable than radicals formed at other positions on the alkyl chain.\n    *   **Final Product:** The bromine atom replaces one of the hydrogens at the benzylic carbon of propylbenzene. The final product is **1-bromo-1-phenylpropane**.\n\n**Summary of structures:**\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 3-Bromopropiophenone\n*   **Intermediate-3:** Propylbenzene\n*   **Final Product:** 1-Bromo-1-phenylpropane\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-phenylpropane>>>"
