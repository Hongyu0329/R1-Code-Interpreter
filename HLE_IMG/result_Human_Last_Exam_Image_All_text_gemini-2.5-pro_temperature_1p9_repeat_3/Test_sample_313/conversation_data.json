    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the provided image.**\n*   The clue states: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows two men in suits at what appears to be an awards ceremony. One man is presenting a trophy to the other.\n*   By identifying the people and the event, we can understand the context. The man receiving the award is Nikita Kucherov, a professional ice hockey player for the Tampa Bay Lightning. The man presenting the award is Gary Bettman, the commissioner of the National Hockey League (NHL). The event is the 2019 NHL Awards. On this date, Kucherov received several major awards, including the Hart Memorial Trophy for Most Valuable Player.\n*   Therefore, \"X Y\" must relate to Nikita Kucherov or the sport of ice hockey.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   The clue states: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This clue points to a historical profession or process that involved mercury and is now obsolete because of its toxic effects.\n*   The most famous example of this is the use of mercury(II) nitrate in the felting process for making hats. Workers in this trade were known as **hatters**.\n*   These hatters often suffered from severe mercury poisoning, which caused neurological damage (tremors, shyness, irritability). This phenomenon gave rise to the popular phrase \"mad as a hatter.\"\n*   So, a strong candidate for \"X Y\" is the word \"Hatter\". This profession, in its traditional form using mercury, has indeed ceased.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the two clues to find the single answer \"X Y\".**\n*   The link between the two clues is the word \"Hatter\".\n*   **Meaning 1 (from Clue 2):** A hatter is a person who makes hats. This profession historically involved using toxic mercury salts.\n*   **Meaning 2 (from Clue 1):** In the sport of ice hockey, a player who scores three goals in a single game achieves a \"hat trick\". By extension, a player who accomplishes this feat can be colloquially referred to as a \"hatter\". The image shows a famous hockey player (Nikita Kucherov) at a hockey awards ceremony.\n*   Therefore, the image shows one type of \"hatter\" (a modern hockey player), while the second clue refers to another, historical type of \"hatter\" (the hat maker). The word \"Hatter\" connects both seemingly unrelated clues.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to correctly identify the person and event in the image to establish the \"hockey\" context.\n*   One must possess or find the specific historical knowledge about mercury use in hat making.\n*   The puzzle relies on a polysemy or a pun on the word \"hatter\".\n*   The format \"X Y\" in the question might be misleading, suggesting a two-word answer, but it's simply a placeholder for the term to be found. The single word \"Hatter\" fits perfectly.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe solution is found by connecting the modern, figurative use of the word \"hatter\" in hockey with its historical, literal meaning in a trade that used mercury.\n\n<<<Hatter>>>"
