    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Understand the question:** The goal is to identify which of the four images (A, B, C, D) represents the atomic arrangement of a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure when viewed along the [110] crystallographic direction.\n\n2.  **Recall the characteristics of the FCC [110] projection:** From solid-state physics and crystallography, it is a known property that when an FCC crystal is projected onto a plane perpendicular to the [110] direction, the resulting 2D pattern of atoms forms a **centered rectangular lattice**.\n\n3.  **Define a centered rectangular lattice:** A centered rectangular lattice has atoms at the four corners of a rectangle and one atom at the exact center of the rectangle. An equivalent way to describe this pattern is as a series of parallel rows of equally spaced atoms, where each row is shifted (staggered) relative to its neighboring rows by exactly half the distance of the atomic spacing within the row.\n\n4.  **Analyze each image to see if it matches the centered rectangular pattern:** We will now inspect the projected patterns in each of the four images.\n\n    *   **Image A:** This image shows atoms arranged in clear vertical columns (at x ≈ 1.5 and x ≈ 4). The horizontal rows (e.g., at y ≈ 6.5 and y ≈ 9) show atoms that are vertically aligned. There is no staggering or shift between the rows. This represents a **simple rectangular lattice**, not a centered one. Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Image C:** The atomic positions in this image appear irregular and do not form a recognizable repeating lattice pattern, neither simple rectangular nor centered rectangular. The distances and alignments are inconsistent. Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Image D:** This pattern is more regular than C but does not fit the centered rectangular model. For instance, consider the atoms in the row at y ≈ 6.5 (with x ≈ 1 and 6) and the row at y ≈ 12.5 (with x ≈ 1 and 6). These atoms are aligned vertically, forming simple rectangles. While there are other atoms at different y-levels (e.g., at y ≈ 8.5), their positions do not correspond to the centers of the rectangles formed by the first set of atoms. Thus, this is not a centered rectangular lattice. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Image B:** Let's examine the arrangement in B carefully.\n        *   Look at the horizontal row of atoms at y ≈ 5.5. There are atoms at x ≈ 1 and x ≈ 5. The spacing between them is `5 - 1 = 4` units.\n        *   Look at the horizontal row of atoms at y ≈ 7. There are atoms at x ≈ 3 and x ≈ 7. The spacing between them is `7 - 3 = 4` units.\n        *   Now, compare these two rows. The row at y=7 is shifted horizontally relative to the row at y=5.5. The shift is `3 - 1 = 2` units.\n        *   This shift (2 units) is exactly half of the intra-row spacing (4 units). This staggered arrangement is the defining characteristic of a centered rectangular lattice. The other atoms in the image (`(1,3)`, `(3,2)`, `(5,9)`) are consistent with the extension of this pattern.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, only Image B displays the characteristic centered rectangular pattern that is the projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
