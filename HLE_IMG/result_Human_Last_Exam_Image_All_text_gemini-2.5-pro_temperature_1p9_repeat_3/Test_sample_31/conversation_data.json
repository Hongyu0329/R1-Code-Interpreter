    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture.\n\n### Analysis of the Problem and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot:**\n    *   **Observation:** The first step is to identify the specific knot shown in the diagram. We can analyze its properties from the image.\n    *   **Crossing Number:** By counting the points where the knot crosses over or under itself, we find there are 8 crossings.\n    *   **Alternating Property:** A knot diagram is called \"alternating\" if the crossings alternate between over and under as you trace along the string. By tracing the path of the knot in the diagram, we can verify that it is an alternating diagram. For example, starting from any point and following the strand, one passes successively through over-crossings and under-crossings.\n    *   **Knot Identification:** Based on the crossing number (8) and its specific structure, we can compare it to a standard catalog of knots, such as the Alexander-Briggs notation. The knot depicted is known as **8_18**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The diagram shown is a specific, highly symmetric projection of the knot 8_18. It might look different from other standard projections found in some textbooks, but they are topologically equivalent. It is important to correctly identify the knot type.\n\n2.  **Understand the Rasmussen Invariant (s-invariant):**\n    *   **Definition:** The Rasmussen invariant, denoted as `s(K)`, is a powerful integer invariant of a knot K. It is derived from a modern knot theory framework called Khovanov homology.\n    *   **Computational Complexity:** Calculating the `s`-invariant from its definition is a very complex process, requiring the computation of the Khovanov homology spectral sequence. This is generally not feasible by hand for a knot with 8 crossings.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must find a more direct method to calculate the invariant rather than using the full theoretical machinery.\n\n3.  **Relate the Rasmussen Invariant to Other Invariants:**\n    *   **Rasmussen's Theorem:** A key theorem proved by Jacob Rasmussen provides a significant shortcut for a large class of knots. For any **alternating knot** K, the Rasmussen invariant is equal to the negative of the classical knot signature, `σ(K)`. The formula is:\n        `s(K) = -σ(K)`\n    *   **Applicability:** Since we have identified the knot as `8_18` and established that its diagram is alternating, this theorem is applicable.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is critical to ensure the knot is alternating before applying this formula. For non-alternating knots, this simple relationship does not hold.\n\n4.  **Determine the Knot Signature:**\n    *   **Knot Signature `σ(K)`:** The signature is a classical and important integer invariant of a knot. It can be computed from a Seifert matrix or a Goeritz matrix of the knot.\n    *   **Looking up the Value:** Similar to the `s`-invariant, direct computation of the signature can be tedious. A reliable and efficient method is to consult established knot theory tables and databases, which have pre-computed values for common knots.\n    *   **Signature of 8_18:** According to standard knot theory references (such as Knotinfo or the Knot Atlas), the signature of the `8_18` knot is:\n        `σ(8_18) = -4`\n    *   **Careful Point:** Always rely on reputable mathematical sources for these values to avoid errors.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation of the Final Answer\n\nFollowing the analysis above, we can now compute the Rasmussen invariant in a straightforward manner.\n\n*   **Step 1: Identify the knot.**\n    The knot in the image is the alternating knot with 8 crossings known as **8_18** in Alexander-Briggs notation.\n\n*   **Step 2: Choose the correct formula.**\n    For an alternating knot `K`, the Rasmussen invariant `s(K)` is given by the formula `s(K) = -σ(K)`, where `σ(K)` is the knot signature.\n\n*   **Step 3: Find the signature of the knot 8_18.**\n    From standard knot tables, the signature of `8_18` is `σ(8_18) = -4`.\n\n*   **Step 4: Compute the Rasmussen invariant.**\n    Substitute the signature value into the formula:\n    `s(8_18) = -σ(8_18) = -(-4) = 4`.\n\nTherefore, the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
