    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the substituents at the labeled positions.\n\n**1. Identify the Reaction Type:**\nThe reaction involves a polycyclic alcohol as the starting material, treated with catalytic acid (HCl) and heat (110 Â°C). These conditions are characteristic of an acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction, which proceeds through a carbocation intermediate. The prompt explicitly mentions that the reaction involves a series of [1,2] shifts, confirming a carbocation rearrangement mechanism, likely a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, which is common in terpenoid chemistry.\n\n**2. Propose the Mechanism - Carbocation Formation:**\n*   **Step A:** The hydroxyl group (-OH) on the starting material is protonated by the acid (HCl) to form a good leaving group, water (-OH2+).\n*   **Step B:** The water molecule departs, leaving a secondary carbocation at C3 of the A ring.\n\n**3. Propose the Mechanism - Carbocation Rearrangement Cascade:**\nThis initial secondary carbocation is unstable and will rearrange through a series of [1,2] shifts of neighboring hydride (H) or methyl (CH3) groups to form more stable tertiary carbocations. The driving force is to move the positive charge through the carbon skeleton, ultimately leading to a position where elimination can form a stable, highly substituted alkene. This process is known as a \"backbone rearrangement\".\n\nLet's trace the shifts by identifying the key carbons and their initial substituents in the starting material (based on the provided drawing):\n*   At C4: Two CH3 groups.\n*   At C5: One H atom.\n*   At C10: One CH3 group.\n*   At C9: One H atom.\n*   At C8: One CH3 group.\n*   At C14: One H atom.\n*   At C13: One CH3 group.\n\nThe cascade of shifts proceeds as follows:\n*   **Shift 1:** A methyl group from C4 migrates to the adjacent C3 cation. This forms a more stable tertiary carbocation at C4. (`[1,2]-CH3 shift`)\n*   **Shift 2:** A hydride from C5 migrates to the C4 cation. The positive charge moves to C5. (`[1,2]-H shift`)\n*   **Shift 3:** The methyl group from C10 migrates to the C5 cation. The positive charge moves to C10. (`[1,2]-CH3 shift`)\n*   **Shift 4:** The hydride from C9 migrates to the C10 cation. The positive charge moves to C9. (`[1,2]-H shift`)\n*   **Shift 5:** The methyl group from C8 migrates to the C9 cation. The positive charge moves to C8. (`[1,2]-CH3 shift`)\n*   **Shift 6:** The hydride from C14 migrates to the C8 cation. The positive charge moves to C14. (`[1,2]-H shift`)\n*   **Shift 7:** The methyl group from C13 migrates to the C14 cation. The positive charge moves to C13. (`[1,2]-CH3 shift`)\n\n**Important Note:** The product drawn in the image incorrectly shows two methyl groups remaining at the C4 position. The first step of the established mechanism involves the migration of one of these methyl groups. For the purpose of solving the problem as intended, we will follow the chemically correct mechanism and assume this is a slight error in the drawing of the product.\n\n**4. Propose the Mechanism - Elimination:**\n*   **Step C:** The cascade terminates with a tertiary carbocation at C13. A base (like H2O or Cl-) removes a proton from the adjacent carbon C12.\n*   **Step D:** This elimination forms a stable tetrasubstituted double bond between C12 and C13, yielding the final product.\n\n**5. Determine the Final Substituents:**\nNow, we track what substituent ends up at each of the numbered positions after the rearrangement.\n\n*   **Position 1 (on carbon C5):** C5 starts with an **H**. This H migrates away (to C4). A **CH3** group from C10 migrates to C5. Therefore, the final substituent at position 1 is **CH3**.\n*   **Position 2 (on carbon C10):** C10 starts with a **CH3**. This CH3 migrates away (to C5). An **H** atom from C9 migrates to C10. Therefore, the final substituent at position 2 is **H**.\n*   **Position 3 (on carbon C9):** C9 starts with an **H**. This H migrates away (to C10). A **CH3** group from C8 migrates to C9. Therefore, the final substituent at position 3 is **CH3**.\n*   **Position 4 (on carbon C8):** C8 starts with a **CH3**. This CH3 migrates away (to C9). An **H** atom from C14 migrates to C8. Therefore, the final substituent at position 4 is **H**.\n*   **Position 5 (on carbon C14):** C14 starts with an **H**. This H migrates away (to C8). A **CH3** group from C13 migrates to C14. Therefore, the final substituent at position 5 is **CH3**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the Wagner-Meerwein backbone rearrangement:\n*   1 = CH3\n*   2 = H\n*   3 = CH3\n*   4 = H\n*   5 = CH3\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = H, 5 = CH3>>>"
