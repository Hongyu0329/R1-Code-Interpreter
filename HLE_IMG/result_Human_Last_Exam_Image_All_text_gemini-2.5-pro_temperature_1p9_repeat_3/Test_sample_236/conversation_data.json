    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation and Analysis of the Subject**\nThe image prominently features an insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers.\n*   **Insect Characteristics:** The animal is an insect, identified by its six legs, segmented body (head, thorax, abdomen), and a pair of antennae.\n*   **Coloration:** It has a very distinct color pattern of black and bright orange or reddish-orange.\n*   **Body Shape:** The insect has an elongated-oval shape. Its wings appear leathery at the base and membranous at the tips, which is characteristic of the order Hemiptera (true bugs).\n*   **Detailed Markings:**\n    *   The head is black with some orange lines.\n    *   The section just behind the head (the pronotum) is mostly orange.\n    *   The legs and antennae are black.\n    *   The wings (hemelytra) show a pattern of orange and black.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of the Surrounding Environment**\nThe insect is on a flower.\n*   **Plant Identification:** The flowers are small, yellow, and clustered together on a spike. This morphology is characteristic of Goldenrod (*Solidago* species), a common plant in fields and meadows during late summer and autumn. Many insects are known to visit goldenrod for nectar or to prey on other insects.\n\n**Step 3: Research and Species Identification**\nCombining the insect's features with its location on a goldenrod plant, we can narrow down the possibilities.\n*   **Search Query:** A search for \"black and orange bug on goldenrod\" or \"black and red true bug\" yields several candidates.\n*   **Candidate 1: Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*):** This bug is black with red/orange lines, but the pattern is different. Boxelder bugs typically have three red lines on their pronotum and red outlines on their wings. The insect in the photo has a solid orange pronotum, so this is not a match.\n*   **Candidate 2: Goldenrod Soldier Beetle (*Chauliognathus pensylvanicus*):** This is a beetle, not a bug. While it has similar coloring and is found on goldenrod, its body shape is different (more parallel-sided), and its wings are elytra (hardened forewings) that meet in a straight line down the back, unlike the overlapping membranous tips of a true bug. This is not a match.\n*   **Candidate 3: Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus kalmii*):** This species is a true bug (family Lygaeidae). Its coloration and markings are an excellent match for the insect in the photograph. It typically has a black head with a red/orange spot or lines, a red/orange band across the pronotum, and a red/orange 'X' pattern on its back (though the 'X' may not be fully visible from all angles). The visible pattern on the insect in the photo (orange \"shoulders\" and thorax) is consistent with *Lygaeus kalmii*. Although its common name refers to milkweed, this bug is known to be polyphagous (feeds on various plants) and is frequently found on goldenrod flowers, feeding on nectar and seeds, especially late in the season.\n\n**Step 4: Final Confirmation**\nBy comparing high-resolution images of the Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus kalmii*) with the insect in the photo, the identification is confirmed. The shape, coloration, specific markings on the head and thorax, and overall appearance align perfectly. Therefore, the animal depicted is the Small Milkweed Bug. The question asks for the scientific name.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scientific name of the Small Milkweed Bug is *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"
