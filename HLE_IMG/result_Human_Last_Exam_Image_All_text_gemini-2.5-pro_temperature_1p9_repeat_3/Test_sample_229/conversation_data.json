    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to determine the song's title, musical style, and country of origin.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Melody and Key Analysis:**\n    *   The piece is written in the treble clef and has a 4/4 time signature.\n    *   The key signature shows no sharps or flats, which would typically indicate C major or A minor. The frequent use of C major as the home chord (tonic) throughout the piece confirms the key is **C major**.\n    *   Let's transcribe the opening melodic phrase. The pickup notes are G and A, leading into the first full measure.\n    *   The first full measure contains the notes: C - E - G - A - B - G - A - G.\n    *   This opening melody is highly recognizable and is the main theme of the song **\"Tico-Tico no Fubá\"**.\n\n2.  **Chord Progression and Harmonic Analysis:**\n    *   The sheet music is a \"lead sheet,\" which provides the melody along with chord symbols for accompaniment.\n    *   The chords used include C, G7 (the dominant), F (the subdominant), E7 (the secondary dominant of A minor), and Dm (the supertonic).\n    *   This kind of fast-moving, harmonically rich progression is characteristic of the style. For example, the progression from C to E7 to F in the first line is a common feature in this tune.\n\n3.  **Rhythmic and Stylistic Analysis:**\n    *   The rhythm is very syncopated, featuring many sixteenth notes, quick runs, and a lively, upbeat tempo (the marking at the top, though blurry, appears to be a fast tempo like quarter note = 170+).\n    *   The virtuosic, fast-paced, and syncopated nature of the melody is a defining characteristic of the **Choro** musical style.\n\n4.  **Identifying Country of Origin:**\n    *   The song \"Tico-Tico no Fubá\" was composed in 1917 by **Zequinha de Abreu**, who was a Brazilian composer.\n    *   The musical style, Choro, is also an instrumental Brazilian popular music genre.\n    *   Therefore, the country of origin is **Brazil**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   While this song has become a standard in other genres, particularly **Gypsy Jazz** and **Latin Jazz**, its original and most fundamental classification is Choro. The sheet music's style is entirely consistent with a Choro arrangement.\n*   The title \"Tico-Tico no Fubá\" translates to \"Sparrow in the Cornmeal.\"\n*   The structural markings, such as the D.S. al Coda (\"Dal Segno al Coda,\" meaning \"from the sign to the Coda\"), are standard musical notations to indicate repeats and jumps to the ending section (Coda), which is typical for composed pieces in this style.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the melody, harmony, rhythm, and known musical history, the piece can be confidently identified.\n\n*   **Title:** Tico-Tico no Fubá\n*   **Musical Style:** Choro\n*   **Country of Origin:** Brazil\n\n<<<Title: Tico-Tico no Fubá, Musical Style: Choro, Country of Origin: Brazil>>>"
