    "*   **Step 1: Identify the Artifact and its Style**\n    The image shows a medallion or bracteate (a thin, single-sided medallion) featuring two stylized busts facing each other. The style is not naturalistic like classical Roman or Greek art. Instead, the hair is represented by decorative patterns, and the facial features are simplified. This abstract and decorative style is characteristic of Migration Period Germanic art, specifically Anglo-Saxon art from England.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the Specific Object**\n    This is a well-known artifact called the **Sarre Bracteate** or Sarre Medallion. It was found in a wealthy warrior's grave (Grave 4) in an Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Sarre, in Kent, England.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the Iconography**\n    The design is an imitation of a Late Roman coin, most likely a gold solidus from the late 4th century A.D. Roman coins of this era often depicted two emperors side-by-side or facing each other. The Anglo-Saxon artist has reinterpreted this Roman image of imperial power according to their own artistic traditions, emphasizing pattern and abstraction over realism.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the Archaeological Dating**\n    Archaeologists date the Sarre Bracteate based on two main criteria:\n    1.  **Artistic Style:** The style is consistent with other high-status Kentish jewelry from the early Anglo-Saxon period.\n    2.  **Grave Context:** The other objects found alongside it in Grave 4 help to place it within a specific timeframe.\n    Based on this evidence, the Sarre Bracteate is confidently dated by archaeologists to the **early 7th century A.D.**, roughly between 600 and 650 A.D.\n\n*   **Step 5: Final Answer Formulation**\n    The question asks for the century. Since the object dates to the early 600s A.D., it belongs to the 7th century.\n\n<<<7th century A.D.>>>"
