    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the RT-PCR results to identify all splice species.\n\n**Analysis Goal:** The main goal is to identify and count the number of unique mature mRNA transcripts (splice species) that are evidenced by the provided RT-PCR results.\n\n**Underlying Principles:**\n1.  **RT-PCR:** Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detects and amplifies RNA molecules. It's used here to study mRNA transcripts.\n2.  **Splicing:** The process of removing introns and joining exons. A PCR product smaller than the size predicted from the genomic DNA indicates that one or more introns between the primer binding sites have been spliced out.\n3.  **Splice Species:** Each unique, mature mRNA molecule resulting from splicing is a \"splice species\". Different bands from the same primer pair suggest different splice species.\n4.  **Viral Gene Expression:** The gene map with early (E) and late (L) genes, and early (AE) and late (AL) polyadenylation sites, is characteristic of papillomaviruses. This implies two major classes of transcripts: \"early\" transcripts that terminate at AE, and \"late\" transcripts that read through AE and terminate at AL.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of PCR Panels:**\n\n**1. Identification of Early Splice Species**\n\n*   Early transcripts are expected to be polyadenylated at the AE site, which is located before the L2 gene. PCRs using reverse primers in the E4 or E5 region (E4R, E5R) are suitable for detecting these.\n*   **Panel C (Primers E1F1/E5R):** This PCR uses a general forward primer in E1 and a reverse primer in E5. The gel clearly shows two distinct bands in some lanes (e.g., sample F).\n    *   Band 1: 584 bp\n    *   Band 2: 553 bp\n*   **Panel B (Primers E1F1/E4R):** This confirms the result from Panel C using a reverse primer in E4. It also shows two bands (190 bp and 159 bp). The 31 bp size difference between the bands in Panel B (190-159) is the same as in Panel C (584-553), indicating the same alternative splicing event is being detected.\n*   **Panel D (Primers E1F2/E5R):** This PCR is crucial. The E1F2 primer is specific for a splice junction of nucleotide 929 to 3465. This reaction produces only *one* major band (551 bp), which corresponds in size to band 2 from Panel C (553 bp).\n*   **Conclusion for Early Species:** The presence of two bands in Panel C indicates **two distinct early splice species**. Panel D confirms the identity of one of these species as containing the 929^3465 splice junction. The other species is not detected by the E1F2 primer, meaning it must have a different splice structure (e.g., using the 929^3506 junction or another variant).\n    *   **Early Species Count = 2**\n\n**2. Identification of Late Splice Species**\n\n*   Late transcripts are expected to be polyadenylated at the AL site, downstream of the L1 gene. They will contain the late genes L2 and L1. PCRs using reverse primers in L2 or L1 (L2R, L1R) are used to detect these.\n*   **Panel I (Primers E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles):** This is the most informative panel for late species as it uses a general forward primer (E1F1) and a reverse primer in the most downstream gene shown (L1R), with a high number of cycles for sensitivity. The gel clearly shows four distinct bands.\n    *   Band 1: 450 bp\n    *   Band 2: 419 bp\n    *   Band 3: 378 bp\n    *   Band 4: 187 bp\n*   **Conclusion for Late Species:** The four distinct bands in Panel I provide direct evidence for **four distinct late splice species** that all include the L1 exon.\n    *   **Late Species Count = 4**\n*   **Corroborating Panels (F, G, H):**\n    *   **Panel H (E1F1/L1R, 20 cycles):** This shows the two most abundant late species (bands 1 & 2) at a lower cycle number. The 31 bp difference (450-419) suggests they differ by the same alternative splice event seen in the early transcripts.\n    *   **Panels F (E1F2/L2R) and G (E1F3/L2R):** These panels use splice-junction-specific primers to investigate the structure of L2-containing transcripts.\n        *   Panel F shows one L2-containing species with the 929^3465 junction.\n        *   Panel G shows two L2-containing species with the 929^3506 junction.\n        *   Together, these panels reveal at least three types of late transcripts based on their splice junctions. This is consistent with the finding of four total late species in Panel I; the fourth late species likely has a splice junction not targeted by primers E1F2 or E1F3.\n\n**3. Total Splice Species Count**\n\nThe total number of unique splice species is the sum of the distinct early species and the distinct late species. These two classes of transcripts are different because they use different polyadenylation signals, resulting in different lengths and coding potentials.\n\n*   Number of Early Splice Species = 2\n*   Number of Late Splice Species = 4\n\nTotal Splice Species = 2 + 4 = 6\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of all the provided RT-PCR data, we can identify a total of 6 distinct splice species.\n\n<<<6>>>"
