The final product, compound A, is a neutral cage-like molecule formed after hydrolysis of the acetonide bridges followed by a triple intramolecular acid-catalyzed dehydration. The structure of A has a central carbon atom bonded to a hydroxyl group and three phenyl rings. These three phenyl rings are interconnected by three ether bridges, with each bridge linking the C2 position of one ring to the C6 position of the adjacent ring.

The structure is as follows:
