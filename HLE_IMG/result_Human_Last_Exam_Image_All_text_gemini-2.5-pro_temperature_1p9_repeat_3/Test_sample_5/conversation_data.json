    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observations:**\n    *   **Instrumentation:** The music is for solo piano, as indicated by the grand staff (treble and bass clefs joined together).\n    *   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4 (common time).\n    *   **Key Signature:** The key signature is C major / A minor (no sharps or flats), but the piece is highly chromatic with many accidentals, suggesting frequent modulation or a non-tonal center.\n    *   **Tempo:** The tempo is marked as quarter note = 80, which is a moderate \"Andante\" tempo.\n\n2.  **Structural and Dynamic Analysis:**\n    *   **Introduction (Measures 1-2):** The piece begins very quietly (*p* - piano) with a simple, sparse texture. The right hand plays a simple melodic fragment (E-D-C-B) over sustained notes in the left hand. The mood is calm and somewhat mysterious.\n    *   **Sudden Shift (Measure 3):** There is an abrupt and dramatic change. The dynamic shifts to *f* (forte - loud). The texture becomes much denser, with rapid sixteenth-note arpeggios in the right hand and powerful, rhythmic octave chords in the left hand. This creates a feeling of sudden action and intensity.\n    *   **Main Body (Measures 3 onwards):** The music continues with high energy. The texture is characterized by constant sixteenth-note motion, creating a driving and relentless feel. The dynamic markings continue to evolve (*mp*, *mf*), suggesting a narrative progression within the music.\n    *   **Harmonic Language:** The harmony is rich and chromatic. For example, measure 3 outlines an E major chord, but measure 4 shifts to C# minor based harmony. This harmonic instability, combined with the rhythmic drive, is a key feature.\n    *   **Virtuosity:** The piece is technically demanding, requiring the pianist to navigate fast passages, large chords, and quick dynamic changes. The glissando-like figure at the beginning of measure 12 is a clear indicator of a virtuosic arrangement.\n\n3.  **Connecting the Clues:**\n    *   The dramatic contrast between a quiet, ominous introduction and a sudden, high-energy, and rhythmically driving main section is a hallmark of many \"battle themes\" in video games.\n    *   The harmonic progressions and melodic shapes are characteristic of the composer Nobuo Uematsu, particularly his work for the *Final Fantasy* series.\n    *   The specific melodic/harmonic sequence starting in measure 3 (the rising arpeggios based on E, F#, G#) is the main motif of one of the most famous video game themes ever written.\n\n4.  **Identification:**\n    *   Based on all the evidence—the structure, the heroic yet menacing tone, the virtuosic piano writing, and the specific thematic material—the piece is identifiable as **\"One-Winged Angel\"** from the video game **Final Fantasy VII**. This particular arrangement is likely from one of the official \"Piano Collections\" albums or a similar advanced transcription.\n\n<<<One-Winged Angel from Final Fantasy VII>>>"
