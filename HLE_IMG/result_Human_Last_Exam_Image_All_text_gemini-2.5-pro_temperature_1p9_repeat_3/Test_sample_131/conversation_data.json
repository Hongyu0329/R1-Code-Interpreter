    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the chemical structure.**\n    *   The provided image displays a complex organic molecule.\n    *   We can identify several key features:\n        1.  It is a polycyclic compound, meaning it contains multiple fused rings.\n        2.  It contains two nitrogen (N) atoms incorporated into the ring system. This makes it a heterocyclic amine.\n        3.  It contains a carbonyl group (C=O).\n        4.  The presence of nitrogen atoms in a complex, naturally-derived structure strongly suggests it is an alkaloid.\n        5.  The stereochemistry is indicated with wedged and dashed bonds at several chiral centers.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the functional groups and ring systems.**\n    *   The carbonyl group is adjacent to a nitrogen atom within a six-membered ring. This functional group is called a lactam (a cyclic amide). Specifically, it is a δ-lactam (or piperidin-2-one).\n    *   The overall structure is tetracyclic (composed of four fused rings). All rings are six-membered.\n    *   The core framework can be seen as two fused quinolizidine systems. A quinolizidine is a bicyclic structure with a nitrogen atom at the bridgehead. This tetracyclic skeleton is characteristic of a class of quinolizidine alkaloids, often found in plants of the *Lupinus* (lupin) genus.\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare with known alkaloids.**\n    *   The parent hydrocarbon skeleton (without the carbonyl group) is known as **sparteine**. Sparteine is a tetracyclic alkaloid with the formula C₁₅H₂₆N₂.\n    *   The molecule in the image is an oxygenated derivative of sparteine. The presence of the lactam ring means it is an oxidation product.\n    *   This specific structure, a sparteine skeleton with one carbonyl group forming a lactam, corresponds to a well-known alkaloid named **Lupanine**. Its chemical formula is C₁₅H₂₄N₂O.\n    *   Other related alkaloids like matrine have the same molecular formula but a different ring fusion pattern (they are constitutional isomers). The connectivity shown in the image is unique to the lupanine/sparteine family. The stereochemistry shown is consistent with the most common natural isomer, (-)-lupanine.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the name.**\n    *   Based on the analysis of the ring system, functional groups, and comparison with known alkaloid structures, the compound is identified as Lupanine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
