Yes, there is strong evidence of insect activity. The most prominent evidence is the white, fuzzy, spherical object on the twig. This is an insect gall, likely a woolly sower gall, which is created by a gall wasp. The wasp laid its egg(s) directly inside the plant tissue of the twig, and this gall has grown around the developing larva(e) to provide food and protection. Therefore, the insect's egg was laid inside the twig at the location of the gall. Additionally, there is evidence of another insect laying a cluster of eggs on the underside of one of the leaves.
