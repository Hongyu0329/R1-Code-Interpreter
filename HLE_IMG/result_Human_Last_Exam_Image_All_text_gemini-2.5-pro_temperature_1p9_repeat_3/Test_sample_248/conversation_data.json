    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual evidence in the photograph.**\n    The image shows a community of marine organisms on a wet, dark rock, characteristic of a rocky intertidal zone. Several types of organisms are visible:\n    1.  **Barnacles:** Numerous acorn barnacles are attached to the rock. They have white and brownish-yellow conical shells.\n    2.  **Gastropod Snails:** There are at least three types of snails.\n        *   One large, conical snail with a light background and distinct, thin, brown spiral stripes.\n        *   One large, whitish, more rounded snail.\n        *   Several smaller, dark, globular snails.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the core of the question.**\n    The question asks to identify a single species that, by its known geographic distribution, proves the photo was taken on the Atlantic coast and not the Pacific coast. This means we need to find a species in the photo that is native to or well-established in the Atlantic but absent from the Pacific.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the most likely candidate species and check their geographic ranges.**\n    *   **Barnacles:** Common barnacles on the Atlantic coast include the Northern Rock Barnacle (*Semibalanus balanoides*). Common Pacific coast barnacles include *Balanus glandula*. While *S. balanoides* is primarily an Atlantic species, distinguishing it from Pacific species with 100% certainty from a photograph can be difficult for a non-expert. Moreover, some species can be invasive and appear outside their native range.\n    *   **Whitish Snail:** The whitish snail shell resembles the Atlantic Dogwinkle, *Nucella lapillus*. This species is found on the North Atlantic coasts of both North America and Europe but is **not** found on the Pacific coast. This is a strong candidate.\n    *   **Small, Dark Snails:** These appear to be a species of periwinkle, but their features are not clear enough for definitive identification.\n    *   **Striped Snail:** The most distinct and easily identifiable snail is the one with the prominent stripes. This is a classic example of the Common Periwinkle. The scientific name for this species is *Littorina littorea*.\n\n*   **Step 4: Confirm the geographic distribution of the most promising candidate, *Littorina littorea*.**\n    *   *Littorina littorea*, the Common Periwinkle, is native to the coasts of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean (Europe).\n    *   It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the mid-19th century and has become extremely abundant and is a characteristic species of rocky shores from Labrador, Canada, down to Maryland, USA.\n    *   Crucially, *Littorina littorea* is **not** established on the Pacific coast of North America. While there may have been isolated introductions, it is not a part of the common intertidal fauna there.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude based on the evidence.**\n    The presence of the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*, which is clearly identifiable in the photograph, is a definitive indicator that the location is on the Atlantic coast rather than the Pacific coast of North America. Both *Littorina littorea* and *Nucella lapillus* are valid indicators, but the striped shell of *L. littorea* is particularly clear and unambiguous in the photo.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
