    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Ion (M⁺•) and Isotope Pattern**\n1.  **Highest Mass Cluster:** The peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) are observed around 260-266. The most intense peaks in this region according to the table are at m/z 260 (I=34.8%) and m/z 262 (I=29.0%). This cluster likely represents the molecular ion and its isotopologues.\n2.  **Halogen Identification:** The presence of a cluster of peaks (M, M+2, M+4, M+6) with specific intensity ratios is characteristic of chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br) atoms.\n    *   **Chlorine** has two main isotopes, ³⁵Cl (~75%) and ³⁷Cl (~25%), leading to an M+2 peak with about 1/3 the intensity of the M peak for each Cl atom present.\n    *   **Bromine** has two main isotopes, ⁷⁹Br (~50%) and ⁸¹Br (~50%), leading to M and M+2 peaks of nearly equal intensity.\n3.  **Determining the Number of Chlorine Atoms:** Let's analyze the observed cluster: m/z 260 (I=34.8%), 262 (I=29.0%), 264 (I=12.9%), 266 (I=3.22%). Let's normalize the intensities relative to the peak at m/z 260 (assuming it is the M peak with all ³⁵Cl). The relative intensities are approximately 100 : 83 : 37 : 9.\n    The theoretical pattern for a molecule containing three chlorine atoms (Cl₃) is M : M+2 : M+4 : M+6 with an intensity ratio of roughly 100 : 98 : 32 : 3.5.\n    The observed pattern (100:83:37) is a very good match for the theoretical pattern for **three chlorine atoms**. The minor deviations can be attributed to instrumental variations or contributions from C-13 isotopes.\n4.  **Molecular Weight:** Based on this, the nominal molecular weight of the compound (containing only ³⁵Cl isotopes) is **260 u**. The molecule's formula contains a Cl₃ group.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Fragmentation Pattern**\n1.  **Base Peak:** The base peak (the most intense peak in the spectrum) is at **m/z 225** (I=100%).\n2.  **Initial Fragmentation:** The mass difference between the molecular ion (m/z 260) and the base peak (m/z 225) is 260 - 225 = 35 u. This corresponds precisely to the mass of a chlorine atom (³⁵Cl). This indicates that the primary and most favorable fragmentation pathway is the loss of a single chlorine radical (•Cl).\n    **M⁺• (m/z 260) → [M - Cl]⁺ (m/z 225) + •Cl**\n3.  **Verifying the Base Peak:** The fragment at m/z 225 should now contain two chlorine atoms. Its isotope pattern should show an M' peak (at 225) and an M'+2 peak (at 227) with an intensity ratio of approximately 3:2 (or 100:66.7). The data table shows m/z 225 (I=100) and m/z 227 (I=66.7). This is a perfect match, confirming that the fragment at m/z 225 contains two Cl atoms.\n4.  **Sequential Losses:** We observe other major peaks that correspond to further losses of chlorine:\n    *   **m/z 190:** This corresponds to a loss of 35 u from the base peak (225 - 190 = 35), meaning a second Cl atom is lost. This peak represents the [M - 2Cl]⁺ fragment.\n    *   **m/z 155:** This corresponds to a loss of 35 u from the m/z 190 peak (190 - 155 = 35), meaning the third Cl atom is lost. This peak represents the [M - 3Cl]⁺ fragment.\n5.  **Conclusion from Fragmentation:** The clear, sequential loss of all three chlorine atoms is very strong evidence that the molecule contains a trichloromethyl group (-CCl₃) attached to a structure (R) that can stabilize the positive charge upon fragmentation (R-CCl₃).\n\n**Step 3: Identification of the Unknown Structure (R)**\n1.  The fragment at m/z 155 is the R group cation, [R]⁺. We need to determine the chemical formula of R, which has a mass of 155 u.\n2.  Let's consider possible elemental compositions for R with a mass of 155.\n    *   **Hydrocarbon (CₓHᵧ):** If R is C₁₂H₁₁, then 12*12 + 11*1 = 155. The overall molecular formula would be C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃. While possible, finding a stable C₁₂H₁₁ structure that fits is difficult.\n    *   **Oxygen-containing group (CₓHᵧOₙ):** If R contains one oxygen atom, the mass of the CₓHᵧ part is 155 - 16 = 139 u. A likely formula for this part is C₁₁H₇ (11*12 + 7*1 = 139).\n3.  Let's propose a structure based on the C₁₁H₇O composition for the R group. A very stable aromatic structure with formula C₁₀H₇ is the naphthyl group. This suggests that R might be a naphthoxy group (-O-C₁₀H₇) with an additional carbon.\n4.  Let's test the hypothesis that the molecule is **trichloromethyl naphthyl ether**, with the formula C₁₀H₇-O-CCl₃.\n    *   **Formula and Mass:** C₁₁H₇OCl₃. The nominal mass is 11*12 + 7*1 + 1*16 + 3*35 = 132 + 7 + 16 + 105 = **260 u**. This matches perfectly.\n    *   **Fragmentation:** This structure contains a -CCl₃ group, perfectly explaining the sequential loss of three chlorine atoms. The resulting cation is stabilized by resonance involving the ether oxygen and the aromatic naphthalene ring, explaining why this is the dominant fragmentation pathway. The fragment [R]⁺ at m/z 155 corresponds to the [C₁₁H₇O]⁺ ion.\n\n**Step 4: Final Identification and IUPAC Name**\nThe compound is an ether formed between naphthalene and a trichloromethanol group. There are two possible isomers depending on the point of attachment to the naphthalene ring (position 1 or 2). Without further information, we cannot distinguish between them, but the class of compound is clear. A common isomer is the one with attachment at the 1-position.\n\nThe systematic IUPAC name for this compound, treating naphthalene as the parent structure, is 1-(trichloromethoxy)naphthalene.\n\n<<<1-(Trichloromethoxy)naphthalene>>>"
