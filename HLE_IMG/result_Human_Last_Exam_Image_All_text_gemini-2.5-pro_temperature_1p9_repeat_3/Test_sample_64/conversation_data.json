    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the process being depicted.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Subject**\nThe image displays three panels (L, M, N) showing a microscopic, elongated, and segmented structure. This structure is a filament composed of individual cells arranged end-to-end. The presence of distinct cell walls suggests the organism is likely a plant, alga, or fungus.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Panel L**\nIn panel L, the filament is relatively straight. The cells are rectangular or barrel-shaped and appear full and rigid. This rigidity is due to turgor pressure, where the internal water pressure pushes the plasma membrane against the cell wall, giving the cell a firm shape. An arrowhead points to a septum, the cross-wall between two adjacent cells.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Panel M**\nIn panel M, a change is visible. The filament is now slightly bent. The arrowhead points to the same region as in panel L. At this location, the cell wall appears to be collapsing or indenting inwards. The cell seems to have lost some of its volume and rigidity compared to the state in panel L.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Panel N**\nIn panel N, the change is even more dramatic. The filament is sharply bent at the point indicated by the arrowhead. The cell at this junction has visibly collapsed. It has lost its regular rectangular shape and appears shrunken. This indicates a significant loss of internal pressure and volume.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the Observations and Identify the Process**\nThe sequence from L to M to N shows a progressive process.\n*   It starts with turgid, rigid cells (L).\n*   It proceeds to a state of partial volume loss and collapse (M).\n*   It ends with a significant collapse and shrinkage of the cell (N).\n\nThis process, where the protoplast (the living part of the cell inside the cell wall) shrinks and pulls away from the cell wall due to the loss of water, is known as **plasmolysis**. Water moves out of the cell via osmosis when the cell is placed in a hypertonic solution (a solution with a lower water potential/higher solute concentration than the cell's cytoplasm). The loss of water leads to a loss of turgor pressure, causing the cell to become flaccid and the plasma membrane to detach from the cell wall, which is exactly what is visualized in the progression from L to N. The arrowheads specifically highlight the site of plasmolysis.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The subject must have a rigid cell wall for plasmolysis to be observable in this manner. Animal cells, which lack a cell wall, would shrivel (crenate) but not show plasmolysis.\n*   The arrowheads specifically draw attention to the region of greatest change, the site of the cell collapse.\n*   The sequence L, M, N implies a time-lapse observation of this event.\n*   The macroscopic result of plasmolysis in a single cell within a filament is the bending or kinking of the entire filament.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the process depicted is plasmolysis.\n\n<<<Plasmolysis>>>"
