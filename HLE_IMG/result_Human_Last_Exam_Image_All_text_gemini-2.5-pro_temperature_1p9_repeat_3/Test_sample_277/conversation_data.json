    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to determine the relationship between the molecules presented in the image, specifically to classify what type of isomers they are, if any.\n2.  **Examine the Provided Information:** The question refers to \"the molecules mentioned above\". The space \"above\" the question text contains an image. However, upon inspection, the image is completely black. It does not show any chemical structures, formulas, or names of molecules.\n3.  **Evaluate the Premise of the Question:** The question is based on the premise that there are molecules available for comparison. Since the image is blank and no other information is provided, this premise is false. There are no molecules to analyze.\n4.  **Analyze the Options in Light of the Missing Information:**\n    *   **(a) conformers isomers:** Conformational isomers are different spatial arrangements of the same molecule that can be interconverted by rotation about single bonds. To determine this, we would need to see at least two structures of the same molecule. This information is not provided.\n    *   **(b) constitutional isomers:** These isomers have the same molecular formula but a different connectivity of atoms. To determine this, we would need to see the structures or formulas of at least two different molecules. This information is not provided.\n    *   **(c) Identical:** This means the provided structures are representations of the very same molecule, possibly viewed from different angles. To determine this, we need structures to compare. This information is not provided.\n    *   **(d) stereoisomers:** This is a broad class of isomers that have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the spatial arrangement of their atoms. This includes enantiomers, diastereomers, and conformers. Again, we need molecular structures to make this determination. This information is not provided.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since no molecules are shown, it is impossible to perform the required analysis to select any of the options from (a) to (d). The question is unanswerable as posed because of the missing critical information.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Prerequisite for Isomerism:** The concept of isomerism applies only when comparing two or more chemical species.\n*   **Missing Data:** The core of the problem is the complete absence of the chemical species that need to be compared. The image is empty.\n*   **Logical Deduction:** As none of the specific relationships (conformer, constitutional isomer, identical, stereoisomer) can be confirmed or even investigated, we must conclude that none of these descriptions apply, simply because there is nothing to describe.\n*   **Interpreting Option (e):** Option (e) \"None of these\" is the most appropriate answer in a situation where the conditions for the other options are not met. Because there are no molecules, there is no relationship between them to classify as (a), (b), (c), or (d).\n\nTherefore, based on the provided material, the question is fundamentally flawed, and the only logically defensible choice is that none of the given specific relationships apply.\n\n<<<E>>>"
