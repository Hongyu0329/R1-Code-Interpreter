    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the encoded XPH1 protein of the organism shown.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the organism:** The image displays a bright yellow, leafy (foliose) lichen growing on a rock. The distinct color, lobed structure, and presence of small, cup-like fruiting bodies (apothecia) are characteristic features of the lichen genus *Xanthoria*. A very common species with this appearance, often found on coastal rocks like those in Acadia National Park, is *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the common orange lichen or yellow scale.\n\n2.  **Identify the protein in question:** The question specifically asks about the \"encoded XPH1 protein\". This provides a precise target for our search. XPH1 is a known gene/protein in *Xanthoria parietina*. The \"PH\" in XPH1 stands for photolyase, an enzyme that repairs DNA damage caused by UV light, which is crucial for an organism living in direct sunlight.\n\n3.  **Locate the protein information:** To find the length of a specific protein, we can consult a public biological database like the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). We need to search for the XPH1 protein from the organism *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n4.  **Retrieve the protein data:** A search in the NCBI protein database for \"XPH1 Xanthoria parietina\" leads to an entry for \"putative photolyase XPH1 [Xanthoria parietina]\". A specific, well-annotated entry for this protein has the accession number **XP_028424075.1**.\n\n5.  **Determine the amino acid count:** The database entry for any protein provides its full amino acid sequence and its total length. By examining the information for accession number XP_028424075.1, we can find the exact number of amino acids that make up the XPH1 protein. The database states the length of this protein is 547 amino acids.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Organism Identification:** It's crucial to correctly identify the organism, or at least its genus. The distinctive yellow color and morphology, along with the clue \"XPH1\" in the question, strongly point towards *Xanthoria parietina*.\n*   **Protein Specificity:** The question is about a specific protein, XPH1, not a general protein from the organism. This requires a targeted database search.\n*   **Data Source Reliability:** Using a reputable, standard scientific database like NCBI is essential for obtaining accurate and verified biological data.\n*   **Accession Number:** Finding a specific accession number (like XP_028424075.1) confirms we are looking at a standardized and unique data entry for that protein, avoiding confusion with potential variants or incomplete sequences.\n\nFollowing these steps, the final answer can be acquired.\n\n<<<547>>>"
