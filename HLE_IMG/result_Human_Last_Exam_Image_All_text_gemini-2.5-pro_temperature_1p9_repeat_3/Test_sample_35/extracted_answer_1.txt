The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the V-domain of the RAGE receptor. It should be considered a prognostic marker, not solely an adjunct marker. This is because the provided pathway indicates that S100B is an active driver of the disease pathology; its overexpression directly initiates signaling cascades (via RAGE) that lead to apoptosis, neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Therefore, the level of S100B correlates with the severity and progression of the neurological disorder, allowing it to predict the future course and outcome of the disease.
