    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Goal: Cutoff Frequency**\nThe cutoff frequency (or -3dB frequency) of a filter is the frequency at which the output signal's power is reduced to half its passband power. For a simple first-order low-pass filter, like the one formed by the resistive network and the capacitor C, the angular cutoff frequency, denoted as $ω_c$, is given by the inverse of the time constant τ.\nThe time constant is defined as $τ = R_{th}C$, where $R_{th}$ is the Thévenin equivalent resistance seen from the terminals where the capacitor is connected.\nTherefore, the cutoff frequency is $ω_c = 1/τ = 1/(R_{th}C)$. The problem thus reduces to finding the Thévenin resistance $R_{th}$ at node $a_0$.\n\n**2. Finding the Thévenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nThe Thévenin resistance is found by looking into the terminals across which the capacitor is connected (node $a_0$ and ground node $b_0$), while deactivating all independent sources.\nThe input is at node $c_0$. Assuming it is an ideal voltage source, deactivating it means shorting node $c_0$ to ground.\nSo, we need to calculate the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground, with node $c_0$ also connected to ground. Let's call this resistance $R_{a_0, gnd}$.\n\n**3. Decomposing the Resistance Calculation**\nLooking at the circuit diagram, node $a_0$ is connected to the rest of the network only through a single resistor of resistance $r$ to node $d_1$. Therefore, the total resistance seen from $a_0$ is this resistor $r$ in series with the equivalent resistance seen from node $d_1$ to ground.\n$R_{th} = R_{a_0, gnd} = r + R_{d_1, gnd}$\nOur next task is to find $R_{d_1, gnd}$, the resistance of the infinite ladder looking from node $d_1$ towards infinity, with node $c_0$ grounded.\n\n**4. Using Nodal Analysis and Difference Equations for the Infinite Ladder**\nTo find $R_{d_1, gnd}$, we can analyze the voltage and current relationships in the infinite ladder. Let's denote the voltage at any node $c_n$ as $v_c(n)$ and at node $d_n$ as $v_d(n)$. For our resistance calculation, ground is the reference potential (0V).\nThe ladder structure is uniform for $n \\geq 1$. We can write the Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) equations for a generic node $n \\geq 1$:\nKCL at $c_n$: $(v_c(n) - v_c(n-1))/r + (v_c(n) - v_d(n))/r + (v_c(n) - v_c(n+1))/r = 0 \\implies 3v_c(n) - v_c(n-1) - v_c(n+1) - v_d(n) = 0$\nKCL at $d_n$: $(v_d(n) - v_d(n-1))/r + (v_d(n) - v_c(n))/r + (v_d(n) - v_d(n+1))/r = 0 \\implies 3v_d(n) - v_d(n-1) - v_d(n+1) - v_c(n) = 0$\n\nWe look for solutions of the form $v(n) \\propto k^n$. Since the ladder is infinite, the voltages must decay as $n \\to \\infty$, so we need $|k| < 1$.\nSolving this system of difference equations gives two modes of propagation:\n1.  A symmetric mode where $v_c(n) = v_d(n)$, which gives a propagation constant $k_s=1$.\n2.  An anti-symmetric mode where $v_c(n) = -v_d(n)$, which gives a characteristic equation $k^2 - 4k + 1 = 0$. The decaying solution is $k_a = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe general solution for the voltages that decay at infinity is a linear combination of these modes. Specifically, for our problem with `c_0` grounded, the voltage solution for $n \\geq 1$ that satisfies the boundary condition at `c_0` (i.e., `v_c(0)=0`) can be shown to be:\n$v_c(n) = A(k_a^n - 1)$\n$v_d(n) = -A(1 + k_a^n)$\nfor some constant A.\n\n**5. Calculating $R_{d_1, gnd}$**\nTo find the resistance at $d_1$, we can conceptually apply a test voltage $v_{d_1}=1V$ and calculate the total current $I_{d_1}$ that flows from node $d_1$ into the ladder towards ground. Then $R_{d_1, gnd} = v_{d_1} / I_{d_1}$.\nWith $v_{d_1}=1V$, from $v_d(1) = -A(1+k_a)$, we find $A = -1/(1+k_a)$.\nThe current leaving $d_1$ is the sum of currents through the two branches connected to it (the branch towards $a_0$ is not included here as it's part of the series resistor in step 3):\n$I_{d_1} = I_{d_1 \\to c_1} + I_{d_1 \\to d_2} = \\frac{v_{d_1} - v_{c_1}}{r} + \\frac{v_{d_1} - v_{d_2}}{r}$\nWe find the voltages $v_{c_1}$ and $v_{d_2}$ using our solution:\n$v_{c_1} = A(k_a - 1) = -\\frac{k_a - 1}{k_a + 1} = \\frac{1 - k_a}{1 + k_a}$\n$v_{d_2} = -A(1 + k_a^2) = \\frac{1 + k_a^2}{1 + k_a}$\nSubstituting these into the current equation:\n$I_{d_1} = \\frac{1}{r} \\left[ \\left(1 - \\frac{1-k_a}{1+k_a}\\right) + \\left(1 - \\frac{1+k_a^2}{1+k_a}\\right) \\right]$\n$I_{d_1} = \\frac{1}{r(1+k_a)} [ (1+k_a - (1-k_a)) + (1+k_a - (1+k_a^2)) ]$\n$I_{d_1} = \\frac{1}{r(1+k_a)} [ 2k_a + k_a - k_a^2 ] = \\frac{3k_a - k_a^2}{r(1+k_a)}$\nUsing the characteristic equation $k_a^2 = 4k_a - 1$:\n$I_{d_1} = \\frac{3k_a - (4k_a - 1)}{r(1+k_a)} = \\frac{1-k_a}{r(1+k_a)}$\nSo, $R_{d_1, gnd} = \\frac{v_{d_1}}{I_{d_1}} = \\frac{1}{I_{d_1}} = \\frac{r(1+k_a)}{1-k_a}$.\nSubstituting $k_a = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$:\n$R_{d_1, gnd} = r \\frac{1+(2-\\sqrt{3})}{1-(2-\\sqrt{3})} = r \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}-1} = r \\frac{\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{3}-1)}{\\sqrt{3}-1} = r\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n**6. Final Calculation of $R_{th}$ and Cutoff Frequency**\nNow we substitute this result back into our expression for $R_{th}$:\n$R_{th} = r + R_{d_1, gnd} = r + r\\sqrt{3} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$.\nFinally, the angular cutoff frequency $ω_c$ is:\n$ω_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$.\n\nThe cutoff frequency $f_c$ in Hertz (Hz) is $f_c = ω_c / (2\\pi) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$. The question asks for the frequency in terms of `r` and `C`, and conventionally this implies the angular frequency `ω_c`.\n\nThe cutoff angular frequency is $ \\frac{1}{(1+\\sqrt{3})rC} $."
