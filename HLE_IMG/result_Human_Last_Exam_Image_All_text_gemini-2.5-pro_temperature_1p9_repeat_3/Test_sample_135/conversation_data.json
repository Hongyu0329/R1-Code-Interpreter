    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Evidence:**\n    *   **Subject:** The artwork is a circular bas-relief (a sculptural relief in which the projection from the surrounding surface is low) depicting a religious scene. A priest is administering the Eucharist (Holy Communion) to several kneeling figures, including a child. This is a common Christian sacrament.\n    *   **Style:** The style of the figures, with their classicized faces and flowing drapery, is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance, specifically the Florentine school. The composition is orderly and devotional.\n    *   **Medium:** The piece has a smooth, somewhat glossy finish, which is typical of glazed terracotta, a medium famously perfected by a specific Florentine workshop.\n    *   **Frame:** The roundel is enclosed within an ornate decorative border featuring fruit and leaf garlands, another hallmark of this artistic tradition.\n    *   **Inscription:** At the bottom of the roundel, there is a visible inscription on a cartouche. The clearer crop shows the text \"SACRAMENTI DE LAVTEL\". This is Old French for \"Sacrament de l'Autel,\" meaning \"Sacrament of the Altar.\"\n\n2.  **Connect the Clues:**\n    *   The combination of glazed terracotta, a religious scene in a roundel, and decorative garlands strongly points to the workshop of the **Della Robbia family**. This family of sculptors, founded by Luca della Robbia in the 15th century, was renowned for this type of artwork.\n    *   The inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE LAVTEL\" indicates this piece is part of a series or a larger altarpiece depicting the sacraments.\n\n3.  **Identify the Specific Artwork and Artist:**\n    *   Searching for an altarpiece featuring the \"Sacramenti de l'autel\" in the Della Robbia style leads to the \"Altarpiece of the Seven Sacraments.\"\n    *   This specific altarpiece is located in the church of Saint-Jean-Baptiste in Bricquebec-en-Cotentin, France.\n    *   Art historians have studied this work and, while it comes from the broader Della Robbia family workshop, it is specifically attributed to **Luca della Robbia the Younger** (also known as Luca di Andrea della Robbia). He was the son of Andrea della Robbia and the grand-nephew of the workshop's founder, Luca della Robbia. This work is dated to circa 1515-1520.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The detail shown in the image is from the panel representing the Eucharist on the Altarpiece of the Seven Sacraments.\n    *   The author of this altarpiece is Luca della Robbia the Younger.\n\n<<<Luca della Robbia the Younger>>>"
