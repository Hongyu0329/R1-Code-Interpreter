    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and the first reaction.**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is a bicyclic amide. It is a derivative of 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    *   The bicyclic core has a nitrogen atom at position 2 (part of an amide) and a double bond between carbons C5 and C6.\n    *   The nitrogen atom is protected with a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group. The formula for the PMB group is C8H9O (-CH2-C6H4-OCH3).\n    *   A trifluoromethyl (-CF3) group is attached to C5.\n    *   Let's determine the molecular formula of the starting material:\n        *   Core skeleton (C6H5NO): 6 carbons (C1, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7), 5 hydrogens (on C1, C4, C6, C7), 1 nitrogen, 1 oxygen (carbonyl).\n        *   Substituents: -CF3 (1 carbon, 3 fluorines) and -PMB (8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 oxygen).\n        *   Total C: 6 (core) + 1 (CF3) + 8 (PMB) = 15\n        *   Total H: 5 (core) + 9 (PMB) = 14\n        *   Total F: 3\n        *   Total N: 1\n        *   Total O: 1 (carbonyl) + 1 (PMB) = 2\n        *   Starting Material Formula: C15H14F3NO2.\n\n*   **Reaction 1:** Reagents are CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n    *   CAN is a common oxidizing agent used for the deprotection of PMB groups from amines and alcohols.\n    *   The PMB group (-C8H9O) is cleaved from the nitrogen, and an H atom is added to the nitrogen.\n    *   This means we subtract C8H9O and add H to the formula of the starting material to get the formula of **Intermediate 1**.\n    *   Formula of Intermediate 1 = C15H14F3NO2 - C8H9O + H = C(15-8)H(14-9+1)F3N(1)O(2-1) = **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Intermediate 1 is treated with Pd/C and H2 in MeOH.\n    *   This is a standard catalytic hydrogenation reaction.\n    *   The most reactive functional group for hydrogenation in Intermediate 1 is the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C).\n    *   The double bond (C5=C6) is reduced to a single bond (C5-C6) by the addition of two hydrogen atoms (H2).\n    *   The amide and CF3 groups are typically stable under these conditions.\n    *   To find the formula of **Intermediate 2**, we add H2 to the formula of Intermediate 1.\n    *   Formula of Intermediate 2 = C7H6F3NO + H2 = **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third reaction.**\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Intermediate 2 is treated with 4 N HCl at 70 Â°C.\n    *   These are conditions for the hydrolysis of an amide. Intermediate 2 is a cyclic amide (a lactam).\n    *   Amide hydrolysis involves the addition of one molecule of water (H2O) across the amide bond (C-N bond).\n    *   The C=O group becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The nitrogen atom becomes an amine (-NH2). This process breaks open the bicyclic ring system to form an amino acid.\n    *   The net chemical change to find the formula of the **Product** is the addition of one water molecule (H2O) to Intermediate 2.\n    *   Formula of the Product = C7H8F3NO + H2O = C(7)H(8+2)F3N(1)O(1+1) = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\n**Summary of Formulas:**\n*   Starting Material: C15H14F3NO2\n*   Intermediate 1: C7H6F3NO\n*   Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO\n*   Final Product: C7H10F3NO2\n\nThe final product is an amino acid derived from the ring-opening hydrolysis of the lactam in Intermediate 2. The molecular formula is determined by the net addition of water during this step.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
