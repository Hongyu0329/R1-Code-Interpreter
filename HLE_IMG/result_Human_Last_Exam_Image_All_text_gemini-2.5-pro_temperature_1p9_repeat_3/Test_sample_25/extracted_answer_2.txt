The result should be interpreted as indeterminate or invalid. Although the Ct value of 30.8 is below the cut-off of 40 cycles, the amplification curve shape is not sigmoidal and lacks a clear exponential phase. This poor curve morphology suggests that the amplification is likely non-specific or an artifact, and the result cannot be reliably considered positive. The assay should be repeated.
