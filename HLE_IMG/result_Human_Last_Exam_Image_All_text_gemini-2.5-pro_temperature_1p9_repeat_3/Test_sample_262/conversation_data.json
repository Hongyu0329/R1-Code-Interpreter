    "*   **Step 1: Understand the Question**\n    The question asks to identify which of the four given iridium complexes, used as emitters in Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs), are expected to have shorter lifetimes. In the context of device performance, \"lifetime\" typically refers to the operational stability or how long the device can function before significant degradation. Therefore, we are looking for the complexes that are chemically less stable under operating conditions.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Structure of the Complexes**\n    All four complexes are cationic Iridium(III) coordination compounds. They have the general formula `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+`, where `C^N` represents a cyclometalating ligand (coordinating through both a carbon and a nitrogen atom) and `N^N` represents a bidentate diimine ligand (coordinating through two nitrogen atoms).\n    *   The central metal is Iridium(III).\n    *   The `N^N` ligand is the same for all four complexes: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. Since this part is constant, it will not be the differentiating factor for stability among the four complexes.\n    *   The `C^N` ligands are where the structures differ. These are all substituted 2-phenylpyridine ligands. The key difference is the number and position of fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring.\n\n*   **Step 3: Relate Molecular Structure to Stability and Lifetime**\n    The operational lifetime of these iridium emitters is strongly correlated with their chemical stability. A primary degradation pathway for such complexes involves the cleavage of the Ir-C bond of the cyclometalating ligand. This bond is generally the weakest link in the coordination sphere.\n    The strength of the Ir-C bond can be modified by introducing substituents on the phenyl ring. Fluorine is a very electronegative atom and acts as a strong electron-withdrawing group via the inductive effect.\n    *   **Effect of Fluorination:** When fluorine atoms are attached to the phenyl ring, they pull electron density away from the carbon atom that is bonded to the iridium center. This makes the Ir-C bond stronger and more resistant to cleavage (either through oxidative or reductive processes that can occur during device operation).\n    *   **Principle:** A higher degree of fluorination on the `C^N` ligands leads to stronger Ir-C bonds, resulting in a more stable complex and, consequently, a longer operational lifetime. Conversely, complexes with less or no fluorination will be less stable and have shorter lifetimes.\n\n*   **Step 4: Compare the Fluorination of the Four Complexes**\n    Let's count the number of fluorine atoms on the cyclometalating (`C^N`) ligands for each complex:\n    *   **Complex 1:** Has two `2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine` ligands. Each ligand has 2 fluorine atoms. Total fluorine atoms = 2 * 2 = 4. This is a highly fluorinated, homoleptic complex.\n    *   **Complex 2:** Has one `2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine` ligand (2 F atoms) and one unsubstituted `2-phenylpyridine` ligand (0 F atoms). Total fluorine atoms = 2 + 0 = 2. The presence of an unfluorinated ligand makes it a potential \"weak link\".\n    *   **Complex 3:** Has one `2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine` ligand (1 F atom) and one unsubstituted `2-phenylpyridine` ligand (0 F atoms). Total fluorine atoms = 1 + 0 = 1. This complex has the lowest degree of fluorination and also contains the \"weak link\" of an unfluorinated ligand.\n    *   **Complex 4:** Has two `2-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)pyridine` ligands. Each ligand has 3 fluorine atoms. Total fluorine atoms = 2 * 3 = 6. This is the most heavily fluorinated complex.\n\n*   **Step 5: Rank the Complexes by Expected Lifetime**\n    Based on the principle that more fluorination leads to longer lifetimes:\n    *   Longest Lifetime: Complex 4 (6 F atoms)\n    *   Long Lifetime: Complex 1 (4 F atoms)\n    *   Shorter Lifetime: Complex 2 (2 F atoms, one unfluorinated ligand)\n    *   Shortest Lifetime: Complex 3 (1 F atom, one unfluorinated ligand)\n\n    The question asks for the complexes with **shorter lifetimes**. These are the least stable complexes in the series, which are Complex 2 and Complex 3. Both contain an unfluorinated phenylpyridine ligand, which significantly compromises the overall stability compared to the fully fluorinated complexes 1 and 4.\n\n*   **Step 6: Conclude and Select the Answer**\n    Complexes [2] and [3] have the lowest degree of fluorination and are expected to have the weakest Ir-C bonds among the set. Therefore, they will degrade more quickly and exhibit shorter operational lifetimes in an LEC device. This corresponds to the choice that includes both [2] and [3].\n\nThe correct option is the one listing complexes [2, 3]. Looking at the provided answer choices, this corresponds to H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
