The main distinguishing feature in the sporophyte is the seta. In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is very short and straight, resulting in an erect capsule that is immersed among the gametophyte leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a long, strongly curved or S-shaped (cygneous) seta that holds the capsule well above the leaves in a nodding or hanging position.
