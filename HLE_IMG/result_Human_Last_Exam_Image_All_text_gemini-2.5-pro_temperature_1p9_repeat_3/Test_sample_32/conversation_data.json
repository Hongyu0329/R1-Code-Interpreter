    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Terms:** The question asks for the main difference in the **sporophyte** between two specific moss species, **Grimmia montana** and **Grimmia curviseta**. A key phrase is \"at a glance,\" indicating we are looking for a visible, macroscopic feature.\n2.  **Define the Moss Sporophyte:** The sporophyte is the diploid, spore-producing generation in a moss's life cycle. It is attached to and dependent on the green, leafy gametophyte. The sporophyte consists of three main parts:\n    *   **Foot:** Anchors the sporophyte to the gametophyte.\n    *   **Seta:** A stalk that elevates the capsule. Its length and shape can vary greatly between species.\n    *   **Capsule (Sporangium):** The structure at the top of the seta that produces and releases spores. Its shape, position, and orientation are also important identification features.\n3.  **Research the Sporophyte of *Grimmia montana* (Mountain Grimmia):**\n    *   **Seta:** Descriptions for this species note that the seta is very **short and straight**.\n    *   **Capsule Position:** Because the seta is very short, the capsule is described as being **immersed or emergent**. This means it sits low down among the perichaetial leaves (the special leaves at the top of the stem), not held up high. The capsule is erect. The image provided shows capsules in this immersed position.\n4.  **Research the Sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta*:**\n    *   **Seta:** The species name itself is a major clue: *curviseta* is Latin for **\"curved seta\"**. Botanical sources confirm this species has a relatively **long and strongly curved (arcuate to cygneous/S-shaped)** seta.\n    *   **Capsule Position:** The long, curved seta raises the capsule well above the leaves (it is **exserted**). Due to the curve in the seta, the capsule is typically **nodding or pendent** (hanging downwards).\n5.  **Compare and Identify the Main Difference:**\n    *   ***Grimmia montana*:** Sporophyte has a short, straight seta, resulting in an erect, immersed capsule.\n    *   ***Grimmia curviseta*:** Sporophyte has a long, curved seta, resulting in a nodding or pendent, exserted capsule.\n6.  **Conclusion for \"At a Glance\" Distinction:** The most striking and immediately obvious difference is the seta. In *Grimmia montana*, you would see the capsules nestled within the moss cushion, appearing almost stalkless. In *Grimmia curviseta*, you would see capsules held up and away from the cushion on distinct, bent stalks, resembling little swan's necks.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n\nThe main difference lies in the length and curvature of the seta (the stalk holding the capsule).\n\n*   In **Grimmia montana**, the seta is very short and straight, causing the capsule to be immersed among the leaves.\n*   In **Grimmia curviseta**, the seta is long and strongly curved (cygneous), causing the capsule to be held up and away from the leaves in a nodding or hanging position.\n\n<<<The main distinguishing feature in the sporophyte is the seta. In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is very short and straight, resulting in an erect capsule that is immersed among the gametophyte leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a long, strongly curved or S-shaped (cygneous) seta that holds the capsule well above the leaves in a nodding or hanging position."
