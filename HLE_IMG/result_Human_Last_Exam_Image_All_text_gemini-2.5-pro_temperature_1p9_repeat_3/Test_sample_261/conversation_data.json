    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to identify the book title.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements in the image fragment.**\nThe image displays a portion of a larger illustration. Key elements are:\n*   **Main Subject:** A white or silvery, ethereal creature with a horse-like body and a single horn on its forehead. This is clearly a unicorn.\n*   **Action:** The unicorn is depicted in motion, likely running or galloping, as suggested by its posture and a slight motion blur effect.\n*   **Setting:** The background is dark and murky, resembling a dark forest or a nighttime scene.\n*   **Framing/Border:** To the right of the unicorn, there is a distinct vertical element. It has a golden or yellowish hue with some shading, looking like part of a decorative pillar, frame, or border.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the visual elements to known works of fiction.**\nA unicorn in a dark forest is a powerful image in fantasy literature. One of the most famous instances of this scene occurs in the Harry Potter series.\n*   In the first book, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* (retitled *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* in the United States), Harry Potter ventures into the Forbidden Forest and witnesses a cloaked figure (Lord Voldemort) drinking the blood of a slain unicorn.\n*   The art style is painterly and characteristic of book cover illustrations, particularly those aimed at young adults.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific book cover.**\nKnowing the likely source is the first Harry Potter book, the next step is to find the specific edition and cover that features this artwork.\n*   The art style is highly reminiscent of Mary GrandPré, who illustrated the American editions of the Harry Potter series.\n*   A search for the cover of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* illustrated by Mary GrandPré reveals a full, wraparound dust jacket illustration.\n*   The front cover shows Harry on a broomstick near Hogwarts.\n*   The back cover section of this same illustration depicts the Forbidden Forest. In this section, there is a silvery unicorn running, exactly as seen in the fragment. The golden pillar-like element in the image corresponds to the decorative border that frames the back cover illustration and separates it from the spine.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the identification.**\nThe image fragment is definitively from the back cover of the original United States edition of the first Harry Potter book.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation:**\nThe title of the book is *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
