    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the element corresponding to the given spectral lines.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Image:** The image displays an atomic emission spectrum. When atoms of an element are energized (for example, by heating a gas or passing an electric current through it), they emit light. This light, when passed through a prism or diffraction grating, separates into a series of bright lines of specific colors. Each line corresponds to a specific wavelength of light emitted by the element. This pattern of lines is unique for each element and serves as its \"fingerprint\". The background rainbow of colors helps to indicate the wavelength (position) of each emission line.\n\n2.  **Examine the Spectral Lines:** We need to carefully observe the key features of the spectrum shown:\n    *   **Red Region (right side):** There is a prominent, bright red line and a couple of fainter lines next to it.\n    *   **Yellow-Orange Region:** There is a very distinct and bright yellow line, followed by some orange lines.\n    *   **Green/Cyan Region:** There are several lines. A very bright green line is visible, as well as a distinct blue-green (cyan/teal) line.\n    *   **Blue/Violet Region (left side):** There are multiple lines in this region, including several bright blue and violet lines.\n\n3.  **Compare with Known Spectra of Common Elements:** Now, let's compare this observed pattern with the known emission spectra of some elements.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** The visible spectrum of hydrogen (the Balmer series) is very simple, consisting of four main lines: a red line (H-alpha), a blue-green line (H-beta), and two violet lines (H-gamma and H-delta). The spectrum in the image is much more complex, containing many more lines than hydrogen. Therefore, it is not hydrogen.\n    *   **Sodium (Na):** Sodium's spectrum in the visible range is famously dominated by a very strong pair of yellow lines (a doublet) that are very close together. While the provided spectrum has a yellow line, it also has many other prominent lines in the red, green, and blue regions. The overall pattern does not match sodium.\n    *   **Neon (Ne):** Neon's spectrum is characterized by a large number of bright lines in the red and orange part of the spectrum. This is why neon signs have their characteristic reddish-orange glow. The spectrum in the image shows strong lines across the entire visible range, including prominent green and blue lines, which is not characteristic of neon.\n    *   **Helium (He):** The emission spectrum for helium is known to have a number of strong, well-spaced lines across the entire visible spectrum. Its characteristic lines include a bright red line, a bright yellow line, a bright green line, a blue-green line, and several blue and violet lines. This description perfectly matches the pattern of prominent lines we observed in the image. The number and positions of the bright lines are a classic representation of helium's spectrum.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe pattern of spectral lines in the image, with its distinct and prominent lines in the red, yellow, green, and blue-violet parts of the spectrum, is the unique fingerprint of the element Helium.\n\n<<<Helium>>>"
