    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the musical artist who played at the venue on the specified date.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Venue**\nThe first step is to identify the location shown in the image. The building has several distinctive architectural features:\n*   A modern design combining red brickwork with beige/tan stucco sections.\n*   A herringbone pattern in the brickwork above a large open-air balcony.\n*   A white, crisscross (diagonally-latticed) railing on the balcony.\n*   A unique, carved quatrefoil-like decorative emblem on the beige wall section.\nA reverse image search or a search based on these architectural details identifies the building as the **George S. and Dolores Dor√© Eccles Theater**, located in Salt Lake City, Utah. The photo specifically shows the facade along Regent Street.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Venue's Event Schedule**\nThe question asks for the performer on a specific date: **October 12, 2023**. Now that the venue is identified, the next step is to find its event calendar or performance history for that date.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Musical Artist**\nBy searching for \"Eccles Theater Salt Lake City schedule October 2023\" or looking through archived event listings for the venue, we can find the performance for the specific date.\n*   Event calendars for the Eccles Theater show that on **Thursday, October 12, 2023**, the headlining musical artist was the American rock band **The National**. They were on their \"First Two Pages of Frankenstein Tour,\" and their special guest for that show was Hand Habits.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Venue Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify the building first. The unique architectural combination is the primary key.\n*   **Date Specificity:** The exact date, October 12, 2023, must be used for the search to find the correct artist. A day earlier or later would yield a different or no result.\n*   **Headliner vs. Opener:** The question asks for \"the musical artist.\" While Hand Habits also performed, The National was the main, headlining act for the evening. In this context, the headliner is the expected answer.\n*   **Contextual Clues:** The large semi-truck with a custom sleeper cab is a tour truck, common for musical acts on national tours, which supports the conclusion that the venue hosts concerts.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the artist who performed at the Eccles Theater on the given date.\n\n<<<The National>>>"
