    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**1. Understand the Graph**\nThe image provided is a raster plot.\n*   The **X-axis** represents Time in seconds (s), from 0 to 50 s.\n*   The **Y-axis** represents the Electrode Number, from 0 to 128.\n*   Each **black dot** represents an electrical spike (a neuron firing) detected by a specific electrode at a specific time.\n*   A **\"synchronized burst\"** is an event where a large number of neurons fire at approximately the same time. Visually, this corresponds to a dense vertical band of black dots on the raster plot.\n\n**2. Identify the Timestamps of Synchronized Bursts**\nWe need to scan the graph along the time axis and identify the time points where these dense vertical bands are centered.\n\n*   **Burst 1:** There is a clear burst of activity at the beginning of the recording. It starts around 1 s and ends around 4 s. The center of this burst is approximately at **t1 = 2.5 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The next major burst occurs between 10 s and 20 s. It appears to be centered at **t2 = 16 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** Another burst is visible between 20 s and 30 s. This one seems centered at **t3 = 26 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** A very prominent burst is located between 30 s and 40 s. Its center is at **t4 = 36 s**.\n*   **Burst 5:** The final visible burst is between 40 s and 50 s. It is centered around **t5 = 47 s**.\n\nSo, the timestamps of the five identified bursts are approximately: **2.5 s, 16 s, 26 s, 36 s, and 47 s**.\n\n**3. Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBI)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time duration between the centers of two consecutive bursts. With 5 bursts, we have 4 intervals to calculate.\n\n*   **IBI 1:** Time between burst 2 and burst 1.\n    IBI 1 = t2 - t1 = 16 s - 2.5 s = **13.5 s**\n*   **IBI 2:** Time between burst 3 and burst 2.\n    IBI 2 = t3 - t2 = 26 s - 16 s = **10 s**\n*   **IBI 3:** Time between burst 4 and burst 3.\n    IBI 3 = t4 - t3 = 36 s - 26 s = **10 s**\n*   **IBI 4:** Time between burst 5 and burst 4.\n    IBI 4 = t5 - t4 = 47 s - 36 s = **11 s**\n\n**4. Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual IBIs and divide by the number of intervals (which is 4).\n\n*   **Sum of IBIs** = 13.5 s + 10 s + 10 s + 11 s = 44.5 s\n*   **Number of intervals** = 4\n*   **Average IBI** = (Sum of IBIs) / (Number of intervals) = 44.5 s / 4 = **11.125 s**\n\n**5. Round the Answer to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question requires the final answer to be given to two significant figures.\n\n*   The calculated value is 11.125.\n*   The first significant figure is 1.\n*   The second significant figure is the second 1.\n*   The digit after the second significant figure is 1. Since 1 is less than 5, we round down (we do not change the last significant digit).\n*   Therefore, 11.125 rounded to two significant figures is **11**.\n\nThe final answer is 11 s.\n\n<<<11>>>"
