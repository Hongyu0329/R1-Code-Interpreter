    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find the highest order 'n' such that rotating the entire pattern by an angle of 360/n degrees around a specific point leaves the pattern unchanged.\n\n1.  **Identify Potential Centers of Rotation:** We look for points in the tiling that are centers of symmetrical arrangements.\n    *   The center of each blue hexagon.\n    *   The center of each yellow square that forms the core of a star-like motif.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Symmetry at These Centers:**\n    *   **Center of a blue hexagon:** Each blue hexagon is a regular hexagon. It is surrounded by six identical clusters of other tiles (yellow pentagons). If we rotate the entire pattern by 360 / 6 = 60 degrees around the center of a blue hexagon, the hexagon will align with its original position, and so will all the surrounding tiles, and by extension, the entire tiling. This indicates the presence of **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n    *   **Center of a yellow square:** At the center of the star-like shapes, there is a yellow square. This square is surrounded by four identical clusters of tiles. Rotating the pattern by 360 / 4 = 90 degrees around this point will also leave the pattern unchanged. This indicates the presence of 4-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n3.  **Determine \"The\" Rotational Symmetry:** When a pattern has multiple centers of rotation with different orders, \"the rotational symmetry\" of the pattern refers to the highest order of rotational symmetry found anywhere in it.\n\nIn this case, we have found centers of 6-fold and 4-fold symmetry. The highest order is 6.\n\nTherefore, the rotational symmetry of the tiling is 6. I will now generate a Python script to formally state this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_rotational_symmetry():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function explains the process of finding the rotational symmetry of the provided tiling.\n  \"\"\"\n  print(\"1. Rotational symmetry of order 'n' means the pattern looks the same after being rotated by 360/n degrees.\")\n  print(\"2. We look for points in the tiling that can act as centers of rotation.\")\n  print(\"3. By observing the pattern, we can identify centers of 6-fold symmetry at the center of each blue hexagon.\")\n  print(\"4. We can also identify centers of 4-fold symmetry at the center of the yellow squares in the star-like motifs.\")\n  print(\"5. The rotational symmetry of the entire tiling is defined by the highest order of symmetry found.\")\n  \n  highest_order_symmetry = 6\n  full_circle = 360\n  rotation_angle = full_circle / highest_order_symmetry\n  \n  print(f\"\\nThe highest order of rotational symmetry found is {highest_order_symmetry}.\")\n  print(\"This corresponds to a rotation angle that leaves the pattern unchanged.\")\n  print(f\"The calculation for this angle is: {full_circle} / {highest_order_symmetry} = {int(rotation_angle)} degrees.\")\n  print(f\"Therefore, the rotational symmetry of the tiling is {highest_order_symmetry}.\")\n\nfind_rotational_symmetry()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
