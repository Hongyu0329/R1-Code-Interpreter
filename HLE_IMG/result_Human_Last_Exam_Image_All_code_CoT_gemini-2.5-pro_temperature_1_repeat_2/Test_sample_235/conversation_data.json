    "Here is my step-by-step analysis to determine the metric pattern of the erasure poem.\n\n**Step 1: Transcribe the Poem**\nFirst, I will transcribe the words from the image in their most logical reading order to form the poem's text. Following a top-to-bottom and left-to-right flow, the sentence is:\n\"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n\n**Step 2: Count the Syllables**\nNext, I'll count the syllables for each word in the sentence to find the total syllable count.\n*   `rules`: 1\n*   `and`: 1\n*   `lines`: 1\n*   `an`: 1\n*   `in-tri-cate`: 3\n*   `spi-der's`: 2\n*   `web`: 1\n*   `work`: 1\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11 syllables.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Metric Options**\nNow, I will evaluate the given answer choices based on the poem's 11-syllable structure.\n\n*   **A. free verse:** No specific syllable count or metrical pattern. This is a possibility if no other form fits.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter:** Consists of 10 syllables per line. The poem has 11. This does not fit.\n*   **C. alexandrine:** Consists of 12 syllables per line. The poem has 11. This does not fit.\n*   **D. sapphic:** A Sapphic line (also known as a hendecasyllabic line) has exactly 11 syllables. The classical pattern is very specific: trochee, trochee, dactyl, trochee, trochee/spondee. Let's check if our poem fits this stress pattern (Stressed = DUM, unstressed = da):\n    *   Pattern: DUM da | DUM da | DUM da da | DUM da | DUM DUM (spondee variation)\n    *   Poem: **RULES** and | **LINES**, an | **IN**-tri-cate | **SPI**-der's | **WEB** **WORK**\n    *   The poem's natural stresses are a perfect match for the Sapphic metrical pattern.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** Consists of about 6 syllables per line (three iambic feet). The poem has 11. This does not fit.\n*   **F. american sentence:** Must be exactly 17 syllables long. The poem has 11. This does not fit.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe poem is a single sentence of 11 syllables that perfectly matches the metrical structure of a Sapphic hendecasyllabic line.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this calculation and analysis.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_poem_meter():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the metric pattern of the erasure poem.\n    \"\"\"\n    poem_text = \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n    words = poem_text.replace(',', '').split()\n\n    # Using a dictionary for accurate syllable counts of these specific words\n    syllable_counts = {\n        \"rules\": 1,\n        \"and\": 1,\n        \"lines\": 1,\n        \"an\": 1,\n        \"intricate\": 3,\n        \"spider's\": 2,\n        \"web\": 1,\n        \"work\": 1\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Transcribe the poem and count syllables.\")\n    total_syllables = 0\n    equation_parts = []\n    for word in words:\n        count = syllable_counts.get(word, 0)\n        total_syllables += count\n        equation_parts.append(str(count))\n    \n    equation = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(f\"Poem: '{poem_text}'\")\n    print(f\"Syllable count: {equation} = {total_syllables} syllables.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Evaluate the metric options.\")\n    print(\" - Iambic Pentameter: 10 syllables. (Mismatch)\")\n    print(\" - Alexandrine: 12 syllables. (Mismatch)\")\n    print(\" - American Sentence: 17 syllables. (Mismatch)\")\n    print(\" - Loose Iambic Trimeter: ~6 syllables. (Mismatch)\")\n    print(\" - Sapphic: A Sapphic line has 11 syllables. (Match)\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Analyze the stress pattern for a Sapphic line.\")\n    print(\"The classical Sapphic pattern is: Trochee | Trochee | Dactyl | Trochee | Spondee/Trochee\")\n    print(\"Stress notation (DUM=stressed, da=unstressed): DUM da | DUM da | DUM da da | DUM da | DUM DUM\")\n    print(\"Applying this to the poem:\")\n    print(\"Poem's stress: RULES and | LINES, an | IN-tri-cate | SPI-der's | WEB WORK\")\n    print(\"\\nThe poem's syllable count (11) and stress pattern perfectly match the Sapphic form.\\n\")\n    print(\"Final Answer: The metric pattern is Sapphic.\")\n\nanalyze_poem_meter()\n<<<D>>>\n```"
