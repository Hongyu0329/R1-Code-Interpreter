    "This painting is a 19th-century work that is heavily inspired by Rembrandt's famous painting, \"The Mill\". However, the artist has added a dramatic fire in the background, a common theme in their work. By identifying the artist known for such dramatic landscapes and who worked in the 19th century, we can find the correct title. The artist is the Swedish painter Marcus Larson, and the title of this work is \"The Burning Mill\".\n\nI will now generate a Python script to output this title.\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the title of the provided painting.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The painting is identified as \"The Burning Mill\" by the 19th-century\n    # Swedish artist Marcus Larson.\n    painting_title = \"The Burning Mill\"\n\n    print(f\"The title of the painting from the 19th century is: {painting_title}\")\n\nsolve_task()\n```\n<<<The Burning Mill>>>"
