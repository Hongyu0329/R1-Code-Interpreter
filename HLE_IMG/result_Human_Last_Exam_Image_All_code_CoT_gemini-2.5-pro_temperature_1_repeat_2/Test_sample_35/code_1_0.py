    # The detailed explanation derived from the diagram.
    explanation = """Based on the provided diagram, the S100B protein exhibits a strong affinity for the extracellular domain of the **Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE)**, specifically interacting with the V, C1, and C2 immunoglobulin-like domains.

S100B is best utilized as a **prognostic marker** rather than solely an adjunct marker. The rationale is that the S100B-RAGE interaction is not just correlated with the disease state but is shown to be a direct upstream activator of the core pathological processes. As illustrated, this binding initiates signaling cascades through JNK/JUN and NFκB, culminating in outcomes that define the progression and severity of neurological disorders:
- Production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β)
- Apoptosis (programmed cell death)
- Neuroinflammation
- Neuronal loss
- Neurodegeneration

Because the concentration of S100B directly influences the magnitude of these damaging effects, its levels can be used to predict the future course, severity, and outcome of the disease, which is the definition of a prognostic marker."""

It should be used as a prognostic marker because its levels can predict the severity and progression of neurological disorders by directly activating pathways that cause neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration.>>>"
