    "The knot in the image is known as the 6_2 knot in the Rolfsen knot table. It is an alternating knot.\n\nFor an alternating knot K, the Rasmussen invariant, denoted as s(K), can be calculated from its Alexander polynomial, Δ_K(t), using the formula:\n\ns(K) = 2 * deg(Δ_K(t))\n\nwhere deg(Δ_K(t)) is the degree of the Alexander polynomial.\n\nAlternatively, it can be calculated from the knot signature, σ(K), using the formula:\n\ns(K) = -σ(K)\n\nI will use the first method. The Alexander polynomial for the 6_2 knot is Δ_{6_2}(t) = t² - 3t + 1. The degree of this polynomial is 2.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the Rasmussen invariant based on this information.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rasmussen_invariant_6_2():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Rasmussen invariant for the 6_2 knot.\n\n    The knot in the image is the 6_2 knot, which is an alternating knot.\n    For an alternating knot K, the Rasmussen invariant s(K) is related to the\n    degree of its Alexander polynomial, Delta_K(t), by the formula:\n    s(K) = 2 * deg(Delta_K(t)).\n\n    The Alexander polynomial for the 6_2 knot is t^2 - 3t + 1.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The Alexander polynomial for the 6_2 knot is t^2 - 3t + 1.\n    # The coefficients are [1, -3, 1] for t^2, t^1, t^0 respectively.\n    alexander_poly_coeffs = [1, -3, 1]\n\n    # The degree of the polynomial is the highest power, which is len(coeffs) - 1.\n    degree = len(alexander_poly_coeffs) - 1\n\n    # The formula for the Rasmussen invariant of an alternating knot.\n    # s(K) = 2 * deg(Delta_K(t))\n    rasmussen_invariant = 2 * degree\n\n    print(\"The knot is identified as the 6_2 knot, which is alternating.\")\n    print(\"The Rasmussen invariant s(K) for an alternating knot is calculated as:\")\n    print(\"s(K) = 2 * deg(Delta_K(t))\")\n    print(f\"The Alexander polynomial for the 6_2 knot is t^2 - 3t + 1.\")\n    print(f\"The degree of the Alexander polynomial is {degree}.\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the invariant:\")\n    # Print the equation with the numbers\n    print(f\"s(6_2) = 2 * {degree}\")\n    print(f\"s(6_2) = {rasmussen_invariant}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe Rasmussen invariant of the 6_2 knot is {rasmussen_invariant}.\")\n\ncalculate_rasmussen_invariant_6_2()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
