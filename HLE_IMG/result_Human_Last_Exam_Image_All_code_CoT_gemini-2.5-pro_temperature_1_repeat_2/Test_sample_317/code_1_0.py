    # Part 1: Determine k (First Character)
    # The average value of x_3 is around 17 in sim 1. Re = 50*k â‰ˆ 5 * <x_3>.
    # In sim 2, x_3 peaks at 20. The fixed point x_3 = Re/5 suggests Re=100.
    # Re = 50*k = 100 implies k=2.
    k = 2

    # Part 2: Determine plot labels for horizontal axes (Characters 2-5)
    # x_3 has a large positive mean value (~17), matching the horiz. axis of plot 'f'.
    x3_plot = 'f'
    # x_1 has weaker damping (-2x_1) than x_2 (-9x_2), suggesting larger oscillations.
    # In sim 2, plot 'h' has a much wider horizontal range than plot 'i'.
    # Thus, 'h' corresponds to x_1 and 'i' to x_2.
    x1_plot = 'h'
    x2_plot = 'i'
    # By elimination, the horizontal axis of plot 'g' is x_4.

    # Simulation 1 is the baseline.
    sim1_change = '0'
    # Simulation 2 shows a larger attractor and lower <x_3>, consistent with an increase in parameter 'c' (C).
    sim2_change = 'C'
    # Simulation 3 shows a sign flip in x_5, with dynamics localized to the (x_4,x_5) subsystem.
    # This points to an increase in parameter 'd' (D).
    sim3_change = 'D'
    # Simulation 4 shows a transition from chaos to a limit cycle, consistent with
    # weakening the x_1-x_2 coupling by decreasing parameter 'b' (b).
    sim4_change = 'b'
