    "The image provided illustrates a classic experiment in psychoacoustics.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Visuals:** The image contains two plots.\n    *   The top plot is a spectrogram, which displays the intensity of different frequencies over time. Initially, it shows a single, stable frequency (a pure tone). This tone is then interrupted by a short burst of noise, which appears as a vertical smear across many frequencies. After the noise, the spectrogram shows two distinct, stable frequencies.\n    *   The bottom plot is the corresponding waveform. It starts as a simple, regular sine wave (representing the pure tone). During the noise burst, the waveform becomes complex and random. After the noise, the waveform is more complex than the initial sine wave, consistent with the superposition of two different frequencies.\n\n2.  **Identifying the Phenomenon:** This setup is used to demonstrate an auditory illusion. When a sound (like the initial tone) is interrupted by a burst of noise loud enough to mask it, listeners do not perceive a gap. Instead, the brain perceptually \"restores\" the original sound, filling in the gap so that the tone is heard as continuous *through* the noise. This is a powerful example of the brain making an \"unconscious inference\" about the world – it assumes the tone continued but was simply obscured by the noise, and thus we perceive it that way.\n\n3.  **Connection to the Prompt's Clues:**\n    *   **Necker Cube:** The comparison to the Necker Cube is apt. The Necker Cube is a 2D drawing that our brain interprets as a 3D object (perceptual completion). The auditory illusion involves our brain completing a sound that is physically absent. The \"bistable\" nature of the cube (it can be seen in two orientations) might relate to how the auditory system interprets the sound after the noise—as a continuation of the old sound or as something new.\n    *   **Unconscious Perceptual Ability:** This phenomenon occurs automatically and without conscious effort, revealing a fundamental mechanism of our auditory processing system.\n\nThe specific name for this illusion is the **Auditory continuity illusion**, also known as perceptual restoration of sound.\n\nSince the task requires a code block, but the question is a knowledge-based one that doesn't require calculation, I will provide a Python script that simply prints the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the auditory phenomenon shown in the image.\n    The image shows a tone being interrupted by a burst of noise.\n    Listeners typically perceive the tone as continuing through the noise,\n    an illusion known as the Auditory continuity illusion or perceptual restoration.\n    \"\"\"\n    phenomenon_name = \"Auditory continuity illusion\"\n    print(f\"The name of the phenomenon is: {phenomenon_name}\")\n\nsolve_puzzle()\n```\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion>>>"
