    "Here is my plan to determine the Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata, first movement:\n\n1.  **Identify the Key:** The first movement is in C minor. The key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭).\n2.  **Identify the Notes:** I will examine the notes in measure 30 from the provided sheet music.\n    *   Bass Clef (Left Hand): The notes are a C# octave.\n    *   Treble Clef (Right Hand): The notes are E, G#, and B.\n3.  **Determine the Chord:** I will combine the notes and stack them in thirds to identify the root and quality of the chord. The notes are {C#, E, G#, B}. This forms a **C# minor seventh chord (C#m7)**.\n4.  **Analyze the Harmonic Function:** Roman numerals describe a chord's function within a key. This chord is highly chromatic and non-diatonic to C minor. I will analyze its relationship to the surrounding chords to determine its purpose.\n    *   Measure 29: G7 (V7 of C minor).\n    *   Measure 32: D minor chord (D, F, A). In C minor, a chord built on the second scale degree (D) is the supertonic, written as **ii°**.\n5.  **Identify the Relationship:** The C#m7 chord in measure 30 resolves (or leads) to the D minor chord in measure 32. A chord built on C# that leads to D functions as a **leading-tone chord** to D.\n6.  **Formulate the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   The Roman numeral for a leading-tone seventh chord is **vii°⁷**.\n    *   Since it leads to the supertonic (ii°) and not the tonic, it is a secondary (or applied) leading-tone chord.\n    *   We write this as the leading-tone chord \"of\" the supertonic: **vii°⁷/ii°**.\n7.  **Conclusion:** Although Beethoven alters the standard notes of a C# diminished 7th chord (C#°⁷) to a C# minor 7th chord (C#m7) for color and voice-leading, its function remains the same. The correct Roman numeral represents this function.\n\nI will now write a Python script to print this step-by-step analysis and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_beethoven_chord():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the harmony of measure 30 from Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata, 1st mvt,\n    and provides the correct Roman numeral.\n    \"\"\"\n    key = \"C minor\"\n    measure = 30\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify the notes in the measure\n    bass_notes = \"C#\"\n    treble_notes = \"E, G#, B\"\n    all_notes = \"C#, E, G#, B\"\n    \n    # Step 2: Determine the chord's identity\n    chord_identity = \"C-sharp minor seventh (C#m7)\"\n    \n    # Step 3: Analyze the harmonic context and function\n    # The chord in m. 30 leads to the D diminished/minor chord in m. 32.\n    target_chord_degree = \"ii°\"\n    target_chord_root = \"D\"\n    \n    # The chord in m. 30 is built on C#, the leading tone to D.\n    function = f\"secondary leading-tone chord to the {target_chord_degree}\"\n    \n    # Step 4: Formulate the Roman Numeral\n    leading_tone_numeral = \"vii°⁷\"\n    final_roman_numeral = f\"{leading_tone_numeral}/{target_chord_degree}\"\n    \n    # Print the analysis\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis for measure 30 of Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata:\")\n    print(f\"1.
