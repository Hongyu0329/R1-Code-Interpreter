    "Of course. Here is a plan to identify the meaning of the cuneiform sign.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Analyze the provided image of the cuneiform sign. The sign is a pictograph, a drawing that represents a physical object.\n2.  The image shows a structure with a triangular roof and a rectangular base, which is characteristic of an early depiction of a building.\n3.  I will write a Python script that contains a small knowledge base of relevant cuneiform signs and their meanings.\n4.  The script will identify the sign based on its visual description (\"a house or building structure\").\n5.  It will then look up the meaning in its knowledge base. The Sumerian sign for \"house\" or \"temple\" is **É**.\n6.  Finally, the script will compare this meaning to the given answer choices and print the correct option.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cuneiform_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies a cuneiform sign based on its description\n    and matches it to the correct meaning from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A mini-database of cuneiform signs and their meanings.\n    cuneiform_signs = {\n        \"É\": \"Home\",\n        \"DINGIR\": \"Deity\",\n        \"NINDA\": \"Bread\",\n        \"ENSI\": \"Ruler\",\n        \"KA\": \"Mouth\",\n        \"SU₆\": \"Beard\"\n    }\n\n    # The sign in the image is a pictograph of a building.\n    # This is the Sumerian sign É.\n    identified_sign = \"É\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the provided image of the cuneiform sign.\")\n    print(\"The sign is a pictograph representing a building, likely a house or a temple.\")\n    \n    print(f\"Step 2: Identifying the sign.
