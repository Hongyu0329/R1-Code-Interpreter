    "Here is my thinking process to identify the unknown compound from its mass spectrum:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):**\n    *   I'll first look for the peak with the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), which is likely the molecular ion. The spectrum shows a cluster of peaks at the high-mass end: m/z 260, 262, 264, 266.\n    *   The presence of multiple peaks separated by 2 mass units is characteristic of chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br). Chlorine has isotopes ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl in an approximate 3:1 ratio.\n    *   Let's test the isotope pattern for the cluster starting at m/z 260 against the theoretical pattern for a molecule containing multiple chlorine atoms.\n        *   Observed intensities: I(260) = 34.8, I(262) = 29.0, I(264) = 12.9.\n        *   Let's normalize to the first peak: 100 : (29.0/34.8)*100 : (12.9/34.8)*100 ≈ 100 : 83 : 37.\n        *   The theoretical ratio for 3 chlorine atoms is approximately 100 : 98 : 32.\n    *   This is a reasonably good match. So, I'll hypothesize that the molecular ion (containing only ³⁵Cl) is at **m/z 260** and the molecule contains **three chlorine atoms**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   If the molecular weight is 260 and it contains three ³⁵Cl atoms, the mass of the rest of the molecule is 260 - (3 * 35) = 260 - 105 = 155 amu.\n    *   I need to find a formula for a hydrocarbon (CₓHᵧ) that has a mass of 155.\n    *   Dividing by the mass of carbon (12): 155 / 12 = 12 with a remainder of 11.\n    *   This suggests a formula of C₁₂H₁₁.\n    *   So, the proposed molecular formula is **C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Fragmentation Pattern:**\n    *   **Base Peak (most intense peak):** The table shows the base peak is at **m/z 225** (I=100%).\n    *   The mass difference between the molecular ion (260) and the base peak (225) is 260 - 225 = 35. This corresponds to the loss of one chlorine atom (Cl•), a very common fragmentation pathway. This supports our hypothesis. The fragment is [C₁₂H₁₁Cl₂]⁺.\n    *   **Other Major Peaks:**\n        *   **m/z 190:** The difference from the base peak is 225 - 190 = 35. This represents the loss of a second chlorine atom. The fragment is [C₁₂H₁₁Cl]⁺.\n        *   **m/z 155:** The difference from the previous fragment is 190 - 155 = 35. This represents the loss of the third chlorine atom. The fragment is [C₁₂H₁₁]⁺.\n    *   This sequential loss of all three chlorine atoms is a strong indicator of the structure.\n\n4.  **Identify Key Structural Fragments:**\n    *   The fragmentation pattern suggests the molecule might be composed of distinct parts. Let's look for other significant fragments.\n    *   **m/z 141:** This peak has a very characteristic isotope pattern at m/z 143 and 145. I(141):I(143):I(145) = 28.1 : 27.8 : 9.37, which is a near-perfect match for a fragment containing three chlorine atoms (theoretical ratio ~100:98:32).\n        *   The mass of this fragment is 141. If it's [CₓCl₃]⁺, the mass of carbon is 141 - (3 * 35) = 36 amu. This corresponds to C₃.\n        *   This strongly suggests the presence of the very stable trichlorocyclopropenyl cation, **[C₃Cl₃]⁺**.\n    *   **m/z 119:** If the molecule cleaves to form [C₃Cl₃]⁺ (mass 141), the remaining part would have a mass of 260 - 141 = 119. This corresponds to the [C₉H₁₁]⁺ fragment. The peak at m/z 119 confirms this. A common and stable C₉H₁₁⁺ cation is the mesityl (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) cation.\n\n5.  **Propose the Structure and IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The evidence points to a molecule made of a **C₉H₁₁ (mesityl)** group attached to a **C₃Cl₃ (trichlorocyclopropenyl)** group.\n    *   The structure is 1-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-2,3,3-trichlorocycloprop-1-ene.\n    *   The systematic IUPAC name, assigning the lowest numbers to substituents based on alphabetical order after numbering the double bond, is **1,2,3-trichloro-3-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)cycloprop-1-ene**.\n\n```python\n# Atomic masses (integer masses for this level of analysis)\nmass_C = 12\nmass_H = 1\nmass_Cl = 35\n\n# Proposed Molecular Formula: C12H11Cl3\nmolecular_ion_mass = 12 * mass_C + 11 * mass_H + 3 * mass_Cl\nprint(f\"Proposed Molecular Ion [C12H11Cl3]+ calculation:\")\nprint(f\"12 * {mass_C} (C) + 11 * {mass_H} (H) + 3 * {mass_Cl} (Cl) = {molecular_ion_mass}\")\nprint(f\"This matches the observed M+ peak at m/z 260.\\n\")\n\n# Base Peak: Loss of one Cl\nbase_peak_mass = molecular_ion_mass - mass_Cl\nprint(f\"Base Peak [M-Cl]+ calculation:\")\nprint(f\"{molecular_ion_mass} - {mass_Cl} (Cl) = {base_peak_mass}\")\nprint(f\"This matches the observed base peak at m/z 225.\\n\")\n\n# Second Fragmentation: Loss of second Cl\nsecond_fragment_mass = base_peak_mass - mass_Cl\nprint(f\"Second Fragment [M-2Cl]+ calculation:\")\nprint(f\"{base_peak_mass} - {mass_Cl} (Cl) = {second_fragment_mass}\")\nprint(f\"This matches the observed peak at m/z 190.\\n\")\n\n# Third Fragmentation: Loss of third Cl\nthird_fragment_mass = second_fragment_mass - mass_Cl\nprint(f\"Third Fragment [M-3Cl]+ calculation:\")\nprint(f\"{second_fragment_mass} - {mass_Cl} (Cl) = {third_fragment_mass}\")\nprint(f\"This is the [C12H11]+ fragment and matches the observed peak at m/z 155.\\n\")\n\n# Key Structural Fragments\n# Trichlorocyclopropenyl cation\nc3cl3_fragment_mass = 3 * mass_C + 3 * mass_Cl\nprint(f\"Key Fragment [C3Cl3]+ calculation:\")\nprint(f\"3 * {mass_C} (C) + 3 * {mass_Cl} (Cl) = {c3cl3_fragment_mass}\")\nprint(f\"This matches the observed peak with a 3-Cl isotope pattern at m/z 141.\\n\")\n\n# Mesityl cation\nc9h11_fragment_mass = 9 * mass_C + 11 * mass_H\nprint(f\"Key Fragment [C9H11]+ (Mesityl) calculation:\")\nprint(f\"9 * {mass_C} (C) + 11 * {mass_H} (H) = {c9h11_fragment_mass}\")\nprint(f\"This matches the observed peak at m/z 119.\\n\")\n\n# Final Conclusion\ncompound_name = \"1,2,3-trichloro-3-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)cycloprop-1-ene\"\nprint(f\"The evidence strongly suggests the compound is:\")\nprint(compound_name)\n```\n<<<1,2,3-trichloro-3-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)cycloprop-1-ene>>>"
