# The task is to identify the correct bird from the options provided.
# By carefully comparing the unique scalloped feather pattern on the back of the target bird
# with each of the options, we can find the match.

# Analysis of the target bird reveals a specific arrangement of feathers,
# which acts as a unique identifier, similar to a fingerprint.

# Comparing this unique pattern to all the options (A-I):
# - Image A has a different texture and lighting.
# - Image B is similar but the pattern on the upper back differs slightly.
# - Image C has a different posture and the pattern is less defined.
# - Image D is at a different angle, making direct comparison difficult, but the pattern seems different.
# - Image E shows subtle differences in the feather arrangement on the back.
# - Image F is too dark to make out details clearly.
# - Image G shows a feather pattern on the back and wings that is an exact match to the target bird. The pose is also very similar, allowing for a direct comparison.
# - Image H has a different color tone and the pattern is not an exact match.
# - Image I has much lower contrast and the pattern details do not align perfectly.

# The conclusion is that image G shows the same bird as the target image.
