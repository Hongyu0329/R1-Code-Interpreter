def find_unknot_indices():

  Analyzes the provided image of six knots and identifies which are isotopic to the unknot.

  The knots are indexed 1 through 6 from left to right.
  - K1: 6_1 knot (not unknot)
  - K2: A complicated diagram of the unknot.
  - K3: A simple diagram of the unknot.
  - K4: Figure-eight knot (4_1) (not unknot)
  - K5: Another complicated diagram of the unknot.
  - K6: Cinquefoil knot (5_1) (not unknot)

  The function returns a list of indices of the knots that are unknots.
