    "To calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate Total Baseline Car VMT:** For each distance category, we'll multiply the share of total trips by the total car mode share (1-occupant car + carpool) and then by the average trip distance. Summing these values across all distance categories gives the total baseline VMT.\n2.  **Calculate Total Proposed Car VMT:** We'll repeat the same calculation using the mode share data from the \"Proposed\" table.\n3.  **Calculate the Percentage Reduction:** The reduction is found using the formula: `((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100`.\n\nThe average carpool occupancy is not needed for this calculation, as VMT refers to the miles traveled by the *vehicle*, not the people inside it.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_vmt_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage reduction in Car VMT based on the provided tables.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data from the tables\n    share_of_total_trips = [0.48, 0.22, 0.14, 0.16]\n    avg_trip_distance = [1, 4, 7.5, 20]\n\n    # Baseline mode shares for cars\n    baseline_car_1_occ = [0.25, 0.38, 0.40, 0.42]\n    baseline_car_multi_occ = [0.28, 0.43, 0.45, 0.47]\n\n    # Proposed mode shares for cars\n    proposed_car_1_occ = [0.01, 0.08, 0.14, 0.16]\n    proposed_car_multi_occ = [0.02, 0.19, 0.27, 0.33]\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate Baseline VMT ---\n    baseline_vmt = 0\n    print(\"Calculating Baseline VMT...\")\n    for i in range(len(share_of_total_trips)):\n        # Total car share for the distance category\n        total_car_share = baseline_car_1_occ[i] + baseline_car_multi_occ[i]\n        # VMT for the distance category (Share of Trips * Car Mode Share * Avg Distance)\n        vmt_component = share_of_total_trips[i] * total_car_share * avg_trip_distance[i]\n        baseline_vmt += vmt_component\n        print(f\"  - Distance {i+1}: ({share_of_total_trips[i]} * ({baseline_car_1_occ[i]} + {baseline_car_multi_occ[i]}) * {avg_trip_distance[i]}) = {vmt_component:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"Total Baseline VMT (relative value) = {baseline_vmt:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate Proposed VMT ---\n    proposed_vmt = 0\n    print(\"Calculating Proposed VMT...\")\n    for i in range(len(share_of_total_trips)):\n        # Total car share for the distance category\n        total_car_share = proposed_car_1_occ[i] + proposed_car_multi_occ[i]\n        # VMT for the distance category\n        vmt_component = share_of_total_trips[i] * total_car_share * avg_trip_distance[i]\n        proposed_vmt += vmt_component\n        print(f\"  - Distance {i+1}: ({share_of_total_trips[i]} * ({proposed_car_1_occ[i]} + {proposed_car_multi_occ[i]}) * {avg_trip_distance[i]}) = {vmt_component:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"Total Proposed VMT (relative value) = {proposed_vmt:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate Percentage Reduction ---\n    reduction = baseline_vmt - proposed_vmt\n    percentage_reduction = (reduction / baseline_vmt) * 100\n\n    print(\"Calculating Percentage Reduction...\")\n    print(f\"Reduction = Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT = {baseline_vmt:.4f} - {proposed_vmt:.4f} = {reduction:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"Percentage Reduction = (Reduction / Baseline VMT) * 100\")\n    print(f\"Percentage Reduction = ({reduction:.4f} / {baseline_vmt:.4f}) * 100 = {percentage_reduction:.1f}%\")\n\n    return percentage_reduction\n\n# Run the calculation and print the final answer in the required format\nfinal_answer = calculate_vmt_reduction()\n# The final answer is wrapped in <<<...>>> as requested.\n# print(f\"\\n<<<{final_answer:.1f}>>>\")\n# The problem asks to still output each number in the final equation.
