    "This is an image analysis task. I will analyze the visual characteristics of the microorganisms in the image, such as their shape, structure, and arrangement, as well as the type of stain used. Based on these observations, I will determine the morphology and classify the type of microorganism. I will then create a Python script that prints this detailed analysis as its output.\n\n```python\ndef classify_microorganism_from_image():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints a detailed classification of the microorganism\n    observed in the provided image. The analysis is based on visual\n    interpretation of the stain, morphology, and organism type.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    classification_details = \"\"\"\nClassification of the Microorganism:\n\n1.  **Stain:** The image shows a differential stain, likely a Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain. In this stain, the fungal elements (containing polysaccharides in their cell walls) are colored a bright pink/magenta, while the background host tissue is counterstained blue-green.\n\n2.  **Morphology:** The microorganisms display two distinct forms:\n    *   **Budding Yeasts:** There are numerous round-to-oval cells. Some are seen undergoing budding, a form of asexual reproduction where a smaller daughter cell grows out from a parent cell. These are characteristic of yeast.\n    *   **Pseudohyphae:** There are also filamentous structures formed by the elongation of budding yeast cells that remain attached end-to-end. These are identified as pseudohyphae (rather than true hyphae) because of the visible constrictions at the points of cell attachment (septa).\n\n3.  **Type of Microorganism:** The co-existence of both budding yeast forms and pseudohyphae indicates the organism is a dimorphic fungus. This specific morphology is a hallmark of infection by a species of *Candida*, particularly *Candida albicans*.\n\n**Conclusion:** The image displays a fungal infection characterized by budding yeasts and pseudohyphae, which is highly suggestive of **Candidiasis**.\n\"\"\"\n    print(classification_details)\n\n# Execute the function to print the classification\nclassify_microorganism_from_image()\n```\n<<<The image displays a fungus with two morphological forms: budding yeasts (round/oval cells) and pseudohyphae (chains of elongated cells). This dimorphism is characteristic of a *Candida* species infection.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Based on the image of a stain viewed under a light microscope, classify what is observed in terms of morphology and type of microorganism\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
