    "Yes, there is very clear evidence of insect activity in this image. The prominent white, fuzzy ball on the twig is a type of plant gall, specifically a Wool Sower Gall (also known as a Woolly Oak Gall).\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  I will explain that the white, fuzzy ball is a gall created by an insect.\n2.  I will identify the type of insect responsible, which is a gall wasp.\n3.  I will describe the egg-laying process: the wasp lays its eggs on the twig, and the gall forms around the eggs/larvae as a protective nursery.\n4.  This information will be printed using a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef explain_insect_activity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the evidence of insect activity in the image and where the eggs are laid.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Yes, there is strong evidence of insect activity in the image.\")\n    print(\"\\n1. Evidence of Activity:\")\n    print(\"The most prominent evidence is the white, fuzzy, spherical object on the twig. This is a plant gall, specifically a 'Wool Sower Gall'.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n2. Insect Responsible:\")\n    print(\"This gall is created by a specific type of insect called a gall wasp (species Callirhytis seminator).\")\n\n    print(\"\\n3. Egg-Laying Location:\")\n    print(\"The gall wasp lays its eggs on the twig of a white oak tree. In response to the chemical signals from the eggs or newly hatched larvae, the tree grows this complex gall structure around them.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the eggs are laid inside this white, fuzzy gall. The gall serves as a protective nursery, providing both shelter and food for the developing wasp larvae.\")\n\nexplain_insect_activity()\n```\n<<<Yes, there is evidence of insect activity. The white, fuzzy object is a wool sower gall created by a gall wasp. The wasp lays its eggs on the oak twig, and the gall forms around them. Therefore, the eggs are located inside the gall.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Is there evidence of insect activity in this image?
