    "To find the total current flowing through the circuit, we need to calculate the total equivalent resistance of the circuit and then apply Ohm's Law (I = V/R).\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze the circuit's structure.** The circuit has a voltage source connected to two parallel branches of resistors.\n2.  **Analyze the first branch (left side).** This branch contains resistors R1, R2, and R3. Notice that there is a wire connected in parallel with resistor R2. This wire acts as a short circuit, meaning the current will bypass R2 entirely. Therefore, for calculation purposes, R2 can be removed. The effective resistance of this branch is R1 and R3 in series.\n3.  **Analyze the second branch (right side).** This branch consists of resistors R7 and R8 connected in series.\n4.  **Calculate the equivalent resistance of each branch.**\n    *   `R_branch1 = R1 + R3`\n    *   `R_branch2 = R7 + R8`\n5.  **Calculate the total equivalent resistance (`R_eq`) of the circuit.** Since the two branches are in parallel, the total resistance is given by the formula: `1 / R_eq = 1 / R_branch1 + 1 / R_branch2`.\n6.  **Calculate the total current (`I_total`)**. Using Ohm's Law, the total current flowing from the voltage source is `I_total = V2 / R_eq`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Redirect stdout to capture print output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# Define the component values from the circuit diagram\nV2 = 1.0  # Voltage in Volts\nR1 = 3.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR2 = 7.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR3 = 9.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR7 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms\nR8 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms\n\nprint(\"Step 1: Analyze the circuit and calculate the resistance of each parallel branch.\")\nprint(\"The circuit has two main branches connected in parallel to the 1V source.\")\nprint(\"\\nBranch 1 (left side):\")\nprint(f\"Resistor R2 ({R2} Ω) is short-circuited by a wire, so it's bypassed.
