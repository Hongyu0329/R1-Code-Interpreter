    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the ECG strip, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the ECG Paper Calibration:** The standard speed for an ECG recording is 25 mm/sec, as indicated at the top left of the image. The grid on the ECG paper is made of small 1 mm squares. Therefore, the time represented by one small square is `1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Longest R-R Interval:** We need to visually scan the entire rhythm strip and find the largest gap between two consecutive R-waves (the tall, sharp peaks). A significant pause is visible in the fourth rhythm strip from the top, between the second and third QRS complexes.\n\n3.  **Measure the Interval:** We will count the number of small horizontal squares between the peaks of the two R-waves that form this longest interval.\n    *   The R-wave at the beginning of the pause conveniently falls on a thick vertical line.\n    *   Counting from this line, we can see 7 full large squares (each large square is 5 small squares wide) and then an additional 4 small squares to the peak of the next R-wave.\n    *   Total number of small squares = (7 large squares * 5 small squares/large square) + 4 small squares = 35 + 4 = 39 small squares.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Time in Seconds:** We multiply the number of small squares by the time duration of each square.\n    *   Longest R-R Interval = 39 squares * 0.04 seconds/square.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the constants based on the ECG strip information.\npaper_speed_mm_per_sec = 25  # The paper speed is 25 mm/sec.\nsmall_square_mm = 1          # Each small square on the grid is 1 mm wide.\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the time duration of one small square.\ntime_per_small_square_sec = small_square_mm / paper_speed_mm_per_sec\n\n# Step 3: Count the number of small squares for the longest R-R interval from the ECG.\n# Upon visual inspection, the longest interval is found in the fourth strip.\n# It spans approximately 39 small squares.\nnum_small_squares_for_longest_rr = 39\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the longest R-R interval in seconds.\nlongest_rr_interval_sec = num_small_squares_for_longest_rr * time_per_small_square_sec\n\n# Print the calculation and the final result.\nprint(f\"The paper speed is {paper_speed_mm_per_sec} mm/sec.\")\nprint(f\"Each small square represents {time_per_small_square_sec} seconds.\")\nprint(f\"The longest R-R interval spans {num_small_squares_for_longest_rr} small squares.\")\nprint(f\"Calculation: {num_small_squares_for_longest_rr} squares * {time_per_small_square_sec} sec/square = {longest_rr_interval_sec} seconds\")\nprint(f\"The longest R-R interval is {longest_rr_interval_sec} seconds.\")\n```\n<<<1.56>>>"
