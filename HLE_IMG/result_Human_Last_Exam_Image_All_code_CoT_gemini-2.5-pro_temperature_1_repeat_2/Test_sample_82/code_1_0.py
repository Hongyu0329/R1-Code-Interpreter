    # In an intramolecular Heck reaction, the palladium catalyst facilitates the coupling
    # of an aryl halide with an alkene within the same molecule.

    # 1. Oxidative Addition: Pd(0) inserts into the C9-Br bond.
    # 2. Carbopalladation: The C9-Pd complex adds across the C4=C5 double bond.
    #    The product shows a new bond between C5 and C9. This means C9 attacks C5,
    #    and the Palladium atom becomes attached to C4.
    # 3. Beta-Hydride Elimination: Palladium is on C4. It eliminates a beta-hydrogen
    #    to form a new double bond and regenerate the Pd(0) catalyst.
    #    The beta-carbons to C4 are C3 and C5.
    #    - Elimination from C5 is a reverse reaction.
    #    - Elimination from C3 is the productive pathway.
    #    This creates a new double bond between C3 and C4.
