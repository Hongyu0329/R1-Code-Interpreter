    # Introduction to the reaction type
    intro = (
        "This is a complex multi-step reaction, likely involving a cascade process starting from the N-substituted proline derivative. "
        "The proposed pathway involves the formation of an azomethine ylide by decarboxylation, which then undergoes cycloaddition and further transformations."

    # Description for Product A
    desc_A = (
        "Product A (C14H20N2O3):\n"
        "*   Analysis: The molecular formula C14H20N2O3 can be rationalized as the product of several steps:\n"
        "    1.  The starting material (C9H16N2O2) undergoes decarboxylation (-CO2) to form an azomethine ylide (C8H16N2).\n"
        "    2.  The ylide undergoes a [3+2] cycloaddition with methyl propiolate (C4H4O2) to give an adduct (C12H20N2O2).\n"
        "    3.  This adduct eliminates H2 to form a more stable intermediate P' (C12H18N2O2).\n"
        "    4.  Finally, this intermediate is N-acetylated by acetic anhydride (+C2H2O) to yield product A (C14H20N2O3).\n"
        "*   Structure Description: A complex tetracyclic structure containing an N-acetyl group, a methyl ester, and an enamide moiety (C=C-N-Ac). "
        "The 1H-NMR signals at 7.95 (NH), 6.14 (vinyl H), 3.77 (OMe), and 2.00 (acetyl Me) are all consistent with this structure."
    )

    # Description for Product B
    desc_B = (
        "\nProduct B (C12H14N2O3):\n"
        "*   Analysis: This product is likely derived from the same key intermediate P' (C12H18N2O2) as product A. "
        "The transformation from P' to B involves oxidation (loss of 4 hydrogens and gain of 1 oxygen). "
        "This type of oxidation is common for the dihydropyrrole-type systems formed in these cycloadditions.\n"
        "*   Structure Description: A highly unsaturated, conjugated, tricyclic system. The structure likely contains a fused dihydropyridone or dihydropyrazinone ring. "
        "This explains the presence of three carbonyl signals in the 13C-NMR and the two distinctive coupled vinyl protons at 7.58 and 5.98 ppm in the 1H-NMR."

    # Description for Product C
    desc_C = (
        "\nProduct C (C11H16N2O3):\n"
        "*   Analysis: This is likely a side product that does not involve the cycloaddition with methyl propiolate. "
        "Its formula can be derived from the starting material (SP, C9H16N2O2) reacting with acetic anhydride. "
        "A plausible pathway is the intramolecular cyclization of SP to form a tricyclic lactam L (C9H14N2O2) via dehydration, followed by acetylation (+C2H2O) to give C (C11H16N2O3).\n"
        "*   Structure Description: A tricyclic lactam. The structure contains an acetyl group (explaining the 2.03 ppm signal), "
        "a C=C double bond (explaining the 5.41 ppm vinyl proton), and three carbonyl-type functionalities as seen in the 13C-NMR."
