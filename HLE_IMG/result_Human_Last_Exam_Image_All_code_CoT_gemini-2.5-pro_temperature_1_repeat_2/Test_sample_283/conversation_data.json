    "Of course. Here is my plan to identify the country from the Google Trends graph.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the provided graph to identify the timing of the recurring interest peaks for the three different colored lines (red, blue, and yellow). These peaks correspond to the annual occurrence of the historic events.\n\n1.  **Red Line:** Shows a prominent, sharp peak every year in late January or early February.\n2.  **Blue Line:** Shows a peak every year in June. Notably, the size of this peak increases over the years shown (2020-2023).\n3.  **Yellow Line:** Shows two distinct annual peaks. The highest peak on the entire chart occurs in early July, and another significant peak occurs in late May.\n\nNext, I will search for a country that has major historical events or national observances matching this specific annual pattern.\n\n*   The February peak (red) strongly suggests **Black History Month**.\n*   The June peak (blue), with its increasing search interest, perfectly aligns with **Juneteenth**, which commemorates the end of slavery and was declared a US federal holiday in 2021, leading to a surge in awareness.\n*   The July peak (yellow) corresponds to **Independence Day (July 4th)**, a major national holiday. The May peak (yellow) corresponds to **Memorial Day**.\n\nThis unique combination of events—Black History Month, Juneteenth, Memorial Day, and Independence Day—is specific to the **United States**.\n\nTo formalize this deduction, I will provide a Python script that encodes this knowledge and logic to programmatically identify the country.\n\n```python\ndef identify_country_from_trends():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes described Google Trends patterns to identify the corresponding country.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the patterns observed from the graph.\n    # These represent three \"topics\" of historic events.\n    # Note: One topic (yellow) appears to cover two major holidays.\n    patterns = {\n        \"event_1_red\": {\n            \"month\": \"February\",\n            \"description\": \"A major historic observance peaking annually in February.\"\n        },\n        \"event_2_blue\": {\n            \"month\": \"June\",\n            \"description\": \"A historic event in June with rapidly growing interest since 2020.\"\n        },\n        \"event_3_yellow\": {\n            \"months\": [\"May\", \"July\"],\n            \"description\": \"Represents major national holidays, with a peak in late May and the highest peak in early July.\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Create a knowledge base of events for the prime candidate country.\n    country_events = {\n        \"United States\": [\n            {\"name\": \"Black History Month\", \"month\": \"February\"},\n            {\"name\": \"Memorial Day\", \"month\": \"May\"},\n            {\"name\": \"Juneteenth\", \"month\": \"June\", \"note\": \"Became a federal holiday in 2021, matching growing interest.\"},\n            {\"name\": \"Independence Day\", \"month\": \"July\"}\n        ]\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Match the patterns to the knowledge base.\n    country_name = \"United States\"\n    events = country_events[country_name]\n\n    # Check for a match for each pattern\n    match_1 = any(event for event in events if event[\"month\"] == patterns[\"event_1_red\"][\"month\"])\n    match_2 = any(event for event in events if event[\"month\"] == patterns[\"event_2_blue\"][\"month\"] and \"note\" in event)\n    match_3_may = any(event for event in events if event[\"month\"] == patterns[\"event_3_yellow\"][\"months\"][0])\n    match_3_july = any(event for event in events if event[\"month\"] == patterns[\"event_3_yellow\"][\"months\"][1])\n\n    print(\"Analyzing historical event patterns from the graph...\\n\")\n\n    if match_1 and match_2 and match_3_may and match_3_july:\n        print(f\"Conclusion: The country is the {country_name}.\\n\")\n        print(\"Reasoning:\")\n        print(f\"- Red Line (Peak: {patterns['event_1_red']['month']}): Corresponds to 'Black History Month'.\")\n        print(f\"- Blue Line (Peak: {patterns['event_2_blue']['month']}): Corresponds to 'Juneteenth'. The growing interest shown in the graph aligns with it becoming a federal holiday in 2021.\")\n        print(f\"- Yellow Line (Peaks: {', '.join(patterns['event_3_yellow']['months'])}): Corresponds to two major holidays, 'Memorial Day' and 'Independence Day'.\")\n        print(\"\\nThis specific combination of annual historic events is unique to the United States.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Could not identify the country based on the provided patterns.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    identify_country_from_trends()\n```\n<<<United States>>>"
