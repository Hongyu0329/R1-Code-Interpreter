    "This sheet music is the opening of the second act of Richard Wagner's opera, *Tristan und Isolde*.\n\nHere are the clues that lead to this conclusion:\n1.  **Language and Instructions**: The instrument names (e.g., \"gr. Fl.\" for große Flöten, \"Br.\" for Bratschen) and musical directions (\"Vorhang\" for curtain, \"mit Dämpfer\" for with mute) are in German, pointing towards a German or Austrian composer.\n2.  **Musical Style**: The rich, chromatic harmony, large orchestra, and specific instrumental effects like the string glissandi are characteristic of late-Romantic German opera, particularly the works of Richard Wagner or Richard Strauss.\n3.  **Specific Passage**: The marking \"1 (Vorhang)\" indicates the curtain rises at rehearsal mark 1. This specific musical passage—a shimmering, expectant introduction in B major—is famously the prelude to Act II of *Tristan und Isolde*, setting the scene for Isolde's nighttime wait for Tristan.\n\nI will now provide the answer in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the opera from the provided sheet music.\n    The music is the prelude to Act II of Richard Wagner's \"Tristan und Isolde\".\n    \"\"\"\n    opera_name = \"Tristan und Isolde\"\n    print(f\"The opera is: {opera_name}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Tristan und Isolde>>>"
