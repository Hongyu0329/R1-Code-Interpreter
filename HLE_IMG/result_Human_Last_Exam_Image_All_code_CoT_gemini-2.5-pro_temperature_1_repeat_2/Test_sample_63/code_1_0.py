    print("The spectrum shows the following key signals:")
    print(" - ~1.2 ppm: A triplet with a relative integration of 6H. This indicates two CH3 groups next to a CH2 group.")
    print(" - ~2.8 ppm: A quartet with a relative integration of 4H. This indicates two CH2 groups next to a CH3 group.")
    print("   -> Together, the 6H triplet and 4H quartet are a classic signature for two equivalent ethyl groups: -N(CH2CH3)2.")
    print(" - ~2.4 ppm: A singlet with a relative integration of 3H. This indicates a methyl (CH3) group with no adjacent protons, likely on an aromatic ring.")
    print(" - ~3.3 ppm: A singlet with a relative integration of 2H. This indicates a methylene (CH2) group with no adjacent protons, likely between a C=O and N.")
    print(" - ~7.1 ppm: Signals in the aromatic region, confirming a benzene ring.")
    print(" - ~9.0 ppm: A broad singlet with a relative integration of 1H, characteristic of an amide N-H proton.")
    print("\n------------------------------------------------\n")

    print("Step 2: Evaluating Candidate Structures")
    print(" - Candidates A-G and B-G: Both contain a dimethylamino group -N(CH3)2, which would show a 6H singlet. The spectrum shows an ethyl group pattern. These are incorrect.")
    print(" - Candidate D-L (Lidocaine): This structure has two methyl groups on the aromatic ring. This would produce a 6H singlet for Ar-CH3. The spectrum shows a 3H singlet at ~2.4 ppm. This is a mismatch. Candidate D-L is incorrect.")
    print(" - Candidate C-L: Let's check this structure against our findings.")
    print("   - Two ethyl groups on Nitrogen [-N(C2H5)2]? Yes. Matches the 6H triplet at 1.2 ppm and 4H quartet at 2.8 ppm.")
    print("   - One aromatic methyl group [Ar-CH3]? Yes. Matches the 3H singlet at 2.4 ppm.")
    print("   - Isolated methylene group [-CO-CH2-N]? Yes. Matches the 2H singlet at 3.3 ppm.")
    print("   - Amide proton [-NH-]? Yes. Matches the 1H singlet at 9.0 ppm.")
    print("   - Aromatic ring? Yes. Matches the signals at ~7.1 ppm.")
    print("\n------------------------------------------------\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The spectrum perfectly matches all the predicted signals for structure C-L. The key differentiator is the singlet at 2.4 ppm, which integrates to 3 protons, corresponding to the single aromatic methyl group in C-L.")
