    "My analysis of the image to identify the city is as follows:\n1.  **Architectural Analysis:** The image displays a dense cluster of modern skyscrapers with glass and steel facades. This architectural style is common in major global business districts, particularly in East Asia.\n2.  **Identifying Key Buildings:** By examining the distinct shapes of the buildings, I can identify them as specific landmarks. The tall, prominent skyscraper on the right is the World Trade Center Seoul (Trade Tower). The building with the curved facade to its left is the Parnas Tower. These buildings are part of the COEX complex located in the Gangnam district of Seoul, South Korea.\n3.  **Cross-referencing:** A quick search for images of the \"COEX complex Seoul\" confirms that the buildings in the photograph match the skyline of this area.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the identifiable landmarks, the photograph was taken in Seoul, South Korea.\n\n```python\ndef identify_city():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the city in the provided image based on visual analysis.\n    \n    Analysis Steps:\n    1.
