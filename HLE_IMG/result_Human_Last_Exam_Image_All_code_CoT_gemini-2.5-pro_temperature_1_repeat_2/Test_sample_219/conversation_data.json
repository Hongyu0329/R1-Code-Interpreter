    "Here is a plan to solve the task:\n1.  **Identify Burst Timestamps:** I will visually inspect the provided raster plot to identify the time points where synchronized bursts of neuronal activity occur. These are visible as dense vertical columns of dots, indicating many electrodes firing at once. I will estimate the center time for each of these bursts.\n2.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** I will calculate the time difference between each pair of consecutive bursts. These are the inter-burst intervals.\n3.  **Calculate Average IBI:** I will compute the average of all the calculated inter-burst intervals.\n4.  **Format the Output:** I will round the final average to two significant figures as requested.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that performs these calculations and prints the entire process, including the identified timestamps, the individual intervals, the final calculation, and the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts from the graph.\n# By visual inspection, the dense vertical bands (bursts) are centered at approximately:\nburst_timestamps = [2.5, 16.5, 35.5, 47.5]\nprint(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs).\n# The IBI is the difference between consecutive burst times.\nintervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\nprint(\"Calculating inter-burst intervals:\")\nfor i in range(len(intervals)):\n    print(f\"Interval {i+1}: {burst_timestamps[i+1]} s - {burst_timestamps[i]} s = {intervals[i]:.1f} s\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the average inter-burst interval.\naverage_interval = np.mean(intervals)\nprint(\"Calculating the average inter-burst interval:\")\ninterval_sum_str = \" + \".join([f\"{val:.1f}\" for val in intervals])\nprint(f\"Average = ({interval_sum_str}) / {len(intervals)}\")\nprint(f\"Average = {np.sum(intervals):.1f} / {len(intervals)} = {average_interval:.1f} s\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 4: Round the result to two significant figures.\n# The format specifier 'g' is used for general format, which works well for significant figures.\n# In this case, 15.0 becomes 15 (two significant figures).\nfinal_answer = float(f\"{average_interval:.2g}\")\nprint(f\"The average inter-burst interval rounded to two significant figures is: {final_answer} s\")\n\n```\n<<<15>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts in this graph of firing activity of a neuronal culture and calculate the average inter-burst interval to two significant figures.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
