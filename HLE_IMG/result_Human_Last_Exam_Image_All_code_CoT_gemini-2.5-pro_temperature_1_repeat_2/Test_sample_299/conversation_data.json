    "This is a mate-in-two puzzle. I will find the sequence of moves for White that leads to a checkmate in two moves, regardless of Black's response.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial position:** I'll examine the placement of all pieces to understand the threats and possibilities for both sides. The Black King at e4 is quite restricted.\n2.  **Find the key first move for White:** I'll look for a forcing move, likely a check, that severely limits Black's options. My primary candidate is a knight check that forces a specific capture.\n3.  **Analyze Black's forced reply:** After White's first move, I'll determine Black's only legal response.\n4.  **Find the checkmating second move for White:** With Black's piece moved, a new line of attack should open up, allowing White to deliver the final checkmate.\n5.  **Construct the code:** I will write a Python script to print the solution in standard algebraic notation, showing the move sequence.\n\n**Step-by-step solution:**\n\n1.  White's first move is **Ng6+**. The Knight from e7 moves to g6, delivering a check to the Black King on e4.\n2.  This check forces Black's only legal move. The King cannot move to any safe square (d4 is covered by Qa4, f5 by Rh5, and d3/e3 by Rf3). The check cannot be blocked. The only option is to capture the checking knight with the rook: **Rxg6**.\n3.  Now, with the Black Rook moved from c6 to g6, White delivers the final blow with **Rhg5#**. The Rook from h5 moves to g5. This is checkmate because:\n    *   The King is in check from the Rook on g5.\n    *   All escape squares are covered (d3/e3/f3 by Rf3, d4 by Qa4, and f5 by the Rook on g5).\n    *   The check cannot be blocked or the checking piece captured.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function prints the solution to the chess mate-in-2 puzzle.\n  \"\"\"\n  white_move_1 = \"Ng6+\"\n  black_move_1 = \"Rxg6\"\n  white_move_2_mate = \"Rhg5#\"\n\n  print(\"The solution for the mate in 2 is:\")\n  # Print the first move for both sides\n  print(f\"1. {white_move_1} {black_move_1}\")\n  # Print the final checkmating move\n  print(f\"2. {white_move_2_mate}\")\n\nsolve_chess_puzzle()\n```\n<<<1.
