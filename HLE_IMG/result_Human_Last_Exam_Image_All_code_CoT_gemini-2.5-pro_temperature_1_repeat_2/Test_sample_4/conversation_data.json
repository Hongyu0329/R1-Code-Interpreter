    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** First, I will identify the knot shown in the image. By counting the crossings (8 of them) and observing its alternating nature, I can identify it as the **$8_{19}$ knot**, also known as the true lover's knot.\n2.  **Use a Computational Approach:** Instead of looking up the answer, I will use my coding skills to calculate the Jones polynomial. This is the most reliable method for a complex knot. I will use the Python library `spherogram`, which is designed for computations in knot theory.\n3.  **Represent the Knot:** To use the library, I need a machine-readable representation of the knot. I will use the Planar Diagram (PD) code for the $8_{19}$ knot, which I can obtain from a standard knot atlas.\n4.  **Calculate the Polynomial:** The Python script will create a `Link` object from the PD code and then call the `jones_polynomial()` method. This will return the polynomial as a symbolic expression using the `sympy` library.\n5.  **Format the Output:** The final step is to format this symbolic expression into the user-specified string format, with terms in decreasing order of their degree (e.g., $t^2 + 3t - 5t^{-1}$). My code will parse the symbolic expression, sort the terms, and build the final string according to the required format, ensuring all signs and coefficients are correctly represented.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these steps and print the resulting Jones polynomial.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport subprocess\n\n# This script requires the 'spherogram' and 'sympy' libraries.\n# The following code will attempt to install them if they are not found.\ntry:\n    import spherogram\n    import sympy\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Required libraries not found.
