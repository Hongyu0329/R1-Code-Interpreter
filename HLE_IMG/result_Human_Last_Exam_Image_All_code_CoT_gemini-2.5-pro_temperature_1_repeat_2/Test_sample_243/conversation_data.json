    "Based on my analysis of the plant's distinctive features, specifically the dark green leaves with prominent white or light green reticulated veins, I have identified it as a species of *Helwingia*. The question asks for the specific island to which this plant is endemic.\n\nWhile several *Helwingia* species exist, *Helwingia formosana* is endemic to a single island. The specific epithet \"formosana\" refers to Formosa, the historical name for this island. Therefore, the plant is endemic to Taiwan.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to output the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_endemic_island():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the island where the plant, likely Helwingia formosana, is endemic.\n    \n    The identification process:\n    1. The plant in the image is identified as a member of the genus Helwingia based on its characteristic reticulated leaf venation.\n    2. The question asks for the specific island of endemism.\n    3. Research on Helwingia species reveals that Helwingia formosana is endemic to the island of Taiwan.\n    4. The name \"formosana\" is derived from \"Formosa,\" a historical name for Taiwan.\n    \"\"\"\n    island_name = \"Taiwan\"\n    print(f\"The plant is endemic to the island of: {island_name}\")\n\nfind_endemic_island()\n```\n<<<Taiwan>>>"
