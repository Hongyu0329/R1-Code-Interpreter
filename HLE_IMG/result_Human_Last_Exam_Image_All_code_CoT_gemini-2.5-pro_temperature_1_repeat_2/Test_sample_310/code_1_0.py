# Parameters for the missing simulation
# N0: Initial degree of polymerization
N0 = 20
# m: Integer variable for degree of destruction
m = 1
# a: Degree of destruction
a = m / 25

# The problem is for a linear polymer.
# The number-average degree of polymerization (Nn) for a linear polymer is:
# Nn = N0 / (1 + a * (N0 - 1))

# Perform the calculation
numerator = N0
denominator = 1 + a * (N0 - 1)
Nn = numerator / denominator

# Print the equation with the substituted values and the final result
