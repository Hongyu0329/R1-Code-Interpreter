    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided clinical and pathological information.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the Clinical Information:** Review the patient's age, sex, and the location of the mass to establish a clinical context.\n2.  **Examine the Pathological Image:** Analyze the cytological features from the crush smear, focusing on cellular arrangement, nuclear characteristics (like chromatin), cytoplasmic features, and the background.\n3.  **Formulate a Differential Diagnosis:** Consider the most likely diagnoses for a sellar mass given the clinical and microscopic findings.\n4.  **Reach a Conclusion:** Synthesize all the information to arrive at the most probable diagnosis.\n\nThis plan will be executed within the following Python script.\n\n```python\ndef provide_diagnosis():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the reasoning for the medical diagnosis based on the provided case details and image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Clinical Context\n    patient_age = 28\n    patient_sex = \"female\"\n    mass_location = \"sella turcica\"\n    \n    print(\"1.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
