The stability of Light-emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs) based on ionic Iridium(III) emitters is primarily determined by the chemical stability of the complex itself. A major degradation pathway involves the dissociation of the neutral bidentate ligand (the N^N ligand).

Let's compare the three complexes based on their structural features:

1.  **Complex 1 ([Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+):** This is a standard, well-known complex. The bipyridine (bpy) ligand provides moderate stability, but the Ir-N bonds can break under the electrical stress of device operation, leading to degradation.

2.  **Complex 2 ([Ir(ppy)2(L2)]+):** This complex features a large, planar, and rigid N^N ligand. While rigidity can be beneficial, large planar surfaces often lead to intermolecular pi-pi stacking (aggregation). Aggregation can quench luminescence and create pathways for degradation, negatively impacting device stability.

3.  **Complex 3 ([Ir(dfppy)2(dtbbpy)]+):** This complex is specifically designed for high stability through two key features on its ligands:
    *   **Di-tert-butylbipyridine (dtbbpy) ligand:** The two bulky tert-butyl groups provide significant advantages.
        *   **Steric Hindrance:** They act as a protective shield, preventing other molecules from attacking the Iridium center and hindering the close approach of other complexes, which suppresses aggregation.
        *   **Electronic Effect:** Tert-butyl groups are electron-donating. They increase the electron density on the nitrogen atoms, strengthening the coordinate bond to the Iridium center. This makes the dtbbpy ligand much less likely to dissociate than the unsubstituted bpy in Complex 1.
    *   **Difluorophenylpyridine (dfppy) ligands:** The fluorine atoms are electron-withdrawing, which generally increases the oxidative stability of the complex.

**Conclusion:**
By directly addressing the main instability mechanisms (ligand dissociation and aggregation), Complex 3 is the most robustly designed molecule. The combination of electronic strengthening and steric protection from the dtbbpy ligand is a proven strategy for enhancing the operational lifetime of LECs. Therefore, LECs based on Complex 3 are expected to be the most stable.
