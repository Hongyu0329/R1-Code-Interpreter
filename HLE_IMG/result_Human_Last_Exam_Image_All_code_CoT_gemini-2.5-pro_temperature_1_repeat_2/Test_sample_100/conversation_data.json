    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the molecular formula of the product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:** First, I will determine the molecular formula of the starting compound by counting the number of atoms of each element (Carbon, Hydrogen, Fluorine, Nitrogen, Oxygen). The starting material is 2-(p-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n2.  **Analyze Step 1:** The reaction with CAN (ceric ammonium nitrate) is a standard method for removing the p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group from a nitrogen atom. This process removes the PMB group and adds a hydrogen atom to the nitrogen. I will calculate the change in the atom count.\n3.  **Analyze Step 2:** The reaction with Pd/C and H₂ is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond in the bicyclic ring to a single bond, adding two hydrogen atoms to the molecule.\n4.  **Analyze Step 3:** The reaction with hot aqueous acid (4 N HCl, 70 °C) causes the hydrolysis of the lactam (cyclic amide). This reaction breaks the amide C-N bond and adds a molecule of water (H₂O), forming a carboxylic acid and an amine.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Formula:** By starting with the initial formula and applying the changes from each step sequentially, I will calculate the molecular formula of the final product.\n\nI will now write a Python script to perform these calculations and display the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product of a three-step reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of the starting material.\n    # The starting material is 2-(p-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    # Formula of the bicyclic core (C7H5F3NO):\n    # C: 7, H: 5, F: 3, N: 1, O: 1\n    # Formula of the PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) group (C8H9O):\n    # C: 8, H: 9, O: 1\n    # Total formula = Core + PMB\n    formula = {\n        'C': 7 + 8,\n        'H': 5 + 9,\n        'F': 3,\n        'N': 1,\n        'O': 1 + 1\n    }\n    print(\"Step 0: Starting Material Formula\")\n    print(f\"The molecular formula of the starting material is C{formula['C']}H{formula['H']}F{formula['F']}N{formula['N']}O{formula['O']}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Reaction 1 - Deprotection of PMB group with CAN.\n    # This removes the PMB group (-C8H9O) and adds one Hydrogen atom.\n    # Net change: C: -8, H: -9 + 1 = -8, O: -1.\n    formula['C'] -= 8\n    formula['H'] -= 8\n    formula['O'] -= 1\n    print(\"Step 1: Deprotection (CAN, ACN/H2O)\")\n    print(\"This step removes the C8H9O (PMB) group and adds one H.\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate 1 Formula: C{formula['C']}H{formula['H']}F{formula['F']}N{formula['N']}O{formula['O']}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Reaction 2 - Hydrogenation of the double bond.\n    # This adds two Hydrogen atoms (H2) across the C=C bond.\n    # Net change: H: +2\n    formula['H'] += 2\n    print(\"Step 2: Hydrogenation (Pd/C, H2)\")\n    print(\"This step adds two H atoms.\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate 2 Formula: C{formula['C']}H{formula['H']}F{formula['F']}N{formula['N']}O{formula['O']}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 4: Reaction 3 - Hydrolysis of the lactam.\n    # This adds one water molecule (H2O) to the structure.\n    # Net change: H: +2, O: +1\n    formula['H'] += 2\n    formula['O'] += 1\n    print(\"Step 3: Hydrolysis (4 N HCl)\")\n    print(\"This step adds one H2O molecule.\")\n    print(f\"Final Product Formula: C{formula['C']}H{formula['H']}F{formula['F']}N{formula['N']}O{formula['O']}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Final Answer Formatting\n    final_formula_str = f\"C{formula['C']}H{formula['H']}F{formula['F']}NO{formula['O']}\"\n    # Handling N and O not having a subscript of 1\n    final_formula_str = final_formula_str.replace(\"N1\", \"N\").replace(\"O1\", \"O\")\n    \n    print(f\"The final molecular formula of the product is {final_formula_str}.\")\n\ncalculate_product_formula()\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>\n```"
