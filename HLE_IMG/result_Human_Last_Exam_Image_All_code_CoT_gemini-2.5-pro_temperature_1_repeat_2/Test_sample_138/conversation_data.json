    "To determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair, we can look for common sexual dimorphism traits in Hymenoptera (bees and wasps).\n\n**Analysis Plan:**\n\n1.  **Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):** The most apparent difference is the antennae. The bee on the left has long, slender antennae, which is a typical characteristic of male bees. The bee on the right has shorter, thicker antennae, characteristic of a female. Therefore, pair A is Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to index **3**.\n2.  **Pair B (Paper Wasps):** The wasp on the right exhibits two key male characteristics: antennae that are curled at the tip and a face with extensive yellow markings. The wasp on the left has straight antennae and a more pointed abdomen, which houses the stinger, indicating it is a female. Therefore, pair B is Female, Male (F, M). This corresponds to index **4**.\n3.  **Pair C (Long-horned Bees):** The bee on the left has exceptionally long antennae, a definitive feature of male long-horned bees. The bee on the right has much shorter antennae, indicating it is a female. The difference in antenna length is a primary and reliable characteristic for sexing these bees. Therefore, pair C is Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to index **3**.\n\nCombining these findings, the sequence of indices for pairs A, B, and C is 3, 4, 3.\n\n```python\ndef solve_insect_sexing():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the indices corresponding to the biological sexes\n    of the three pairs of insects shown in the image.\n\n    Analysis:\n    - Pair A: The left insect has long antennae (male), the right has shorter antennae (female). This is M, F, which is option 3.\n    - Pair B: The left insect is a female wasp (straight antennae, stinger). The right insect is a male wasp (curled antennae, yellow face). This is F, M, which is option 4.\n    - Pair C: The left insect is a male long-horned bee (very long antennae). The right insect is a female (shorter antennae). This is M, F, which is option 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Indices for the options provided:\n    # 1) M, M\n    # 2) F, F\n    # 3) M, F\n    # 4) F, M\n    \n    index_A = 3  # Male, Female\n    index_B = 4  # Female, Male\n    index_C = 3  # Male, Female\n    \n    # Print the result in the specified format \"A, B, C\"\n    print(f\"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}\")\n\nsolve_insect_sexing()\n```\n<<<3, 4, 3>>>"
