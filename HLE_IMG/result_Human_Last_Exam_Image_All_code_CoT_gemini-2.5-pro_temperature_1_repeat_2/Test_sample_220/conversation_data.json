    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the expected two-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal lattice when viewed along the [110] crystallographic direction. Then, we compare this expected pattern with the four given images (A, B, C, and D).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the FCC structure:** Recall the atomic positions in a conventional FCC unit cell. Atoms are located at the 8 corners and the 6 face centers.\n2.  **Understand the [110] projection:** Determine how the 3D atomic positions are mapped onto a 2D plane when viewed along the vector [1, 1, 0].\n3.  **Determine the resulting 2D pattern:** The projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction results in a specific, repeating 2D pattern known as a **centered rectangular lattice**. This pattern looks like rows of atoms where each row is shifted horizontally by half the inter-atomic distance relative to the rows immediately above and below it, similar to a classic brick wall pattern.\n4.  **Analyze the options:** Examine each of the four images to see which one displays a centered rectangular pattern.\n    *   **Image A, B, C:** These images do not show a regular, repeating centered rectangular arrangement.\n    *   **Image D:** This image clearly shows horizontal rows of atoms. The atoms in one row (e.g., the row at y≈8) are horizontally centered between the atoms in the adjacent rows (e.g., the rows at y≈6 and y≈12). This arrangement is the characteristic signature of a centered rectangular lattice.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on this analysis, Image D matches the expected pattern for an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n\nThe following Python code outlines this reasoning process.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crystal_structure_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the expected projection of an FCC lattice and identifies the correct image.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analysis of Crystal Lattice Projections\")\n    print(\"=\" * 40)\n    print(\"The goal is to identify the face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"1.
