    print("A face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice has atoms at the 8 cube corners and the 6 face centers.")
    print("When viewed along the [110] direction, the 3D atomic positions are projected onto a 2D plane.")
    print("This projection results in a characteristic 2D lattice pattern known as a 'centered rectangular' lattice.")
    print("The key features of this pattern are:")
    print("  - Atoms are arranged in rows.")
    print("  - Each row is shifted horizontally relative to the adjacent rows by half the atomic spacing within the row.")
    print("  - This creates a pattern similar to bricks in a wall (stretcher bond).\n")
