    "This image displays a typical North Atlantic rocky intertidal community. Several species are visible, including acorn barnacles, common periwinkles, and rough periwinkles. To determine which species definitively places this scene on the Atlantic coast, we need to consider their geographic distributions.\n\n1.  **Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*)**: The larger, striped snail is the common periwinkle. While extremely common on the North American Atlantic coast, it's an invasive species from Europe. It has also been introduced to the Pacific coast (e.g., San Francisco Bay), so its presence isn't a definitive Atlantic indicator.\n2.  **Acorn Barnacles**: The numerous barnacles covering the rock are crucial. The dominant acorn barnacle of the North Atlantic intertidal zone is *Semibalanus balanoides*. This species is found on both the European and North American coasts of the Atlantic Ocean but is absent from the Pacific Ocean. The dominant barnacles on the US Pacific coast belong to different species, such as *Balanus glandula*.\n3.  **Rough Periwinkles (*Littorina saxatilis*)**: The smaller, dark, ribbed snails are likely rough periwinkles. Like the common periwinkle, this species is native to the Atlantic but has been reported as an introduction in some Pacific locations.\n\nTherefore, the presence of the barnacle *Semibalanus balanoides* is the strongest and most definitive evidence that this photograph was taken on a North Atlantic shore rather than a Pacific one.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the species that definitively indicates the photo's location\n    is on the Atlantic coast and prints its scientific name.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The key identifier is the Northern Rock Barnacle, whose range is restricted to the North Atlantic Ocean.\n    scientific_name = \"Semibalanus balanoides\"\n    print(f\"The scientific name of the species that definitively indicates an Atlantic coast location is: {scientific_name}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Semibalanus balanoides>>>"
