    "To identify the rock specimens, I will analyze the visual characteristics of each rock, such as texture, color, and composition.\n\n*   **Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and highly vesicular, meaning it's full of small holes (vesicles). This appearance is characteristic of **Scoria**, an extrusive igneous rock formed from gas-rich lava.\n*   **Specimen I:** This rock is composed of various angular rock fragments (clasts) cemented together in a finer-grained matrix. This texture defines a **Breccia**. Given its association with other volcanic rocks, it is likely a volcanic breccia.\n*   **Specimen J:** This is a light-colored, highly porous rock. Its texture is vesicular, but the overall appearance is very lightweight and almost frothy. This is a classic example of **Pumice**, a felsic extrusive igneous rock so porous it can often float on water.\n*   **Specimen K:** This rock displays large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible. This coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture indicates it cooled slowly deep underground, making it an intrusive igneous rock. The mix of light-colored minerals (likely feldspar and quartz) and some darker minerals suggests it is **Granite** or **Pegmatite** (a very coarse-grained granite).\n\nBased on this analysis, I will generate a Python script to list the identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Breccia',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Granite/Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for letter, name in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {letter}: {name}\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Granite/Pegmatite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
