    """
    This function identifies and prints the name of a product from a WWII-era advertisement.
    
    The advertisement is for Mene Sanitary Towels. The key clues are:
    1.  The slogan "Women are winning the War - of Freedom" is historically linked to the Mene brand.
    2.  The product was marketed to women war workers to help them overcome "inherent limitations," a euphemism for menstruation.
    3.  The name "Mene" is derived from the same classical root (Greek 'mēn' for month) as the French medical term "ménès", fitting the "French-derived name" clue.

    # we can print a descriptive sentence.
