    "This problem describes a chemical transformation that proceeds through a sequence of two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions. To identify these reactions, we need to analyze the reactants and the plausible reaction pathway.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   The reactants are hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆) and cyclobutene (C₄H₆).\n    *   The reaction is initiated by light (`hv`), indicating a photochemical process.\n    *   The reaction involves combining two molecules, which strongly suggests that one of the steps is a cycloaddition reaction.\n\n2.  **Identify the First Pericyclic Reaction:**\n    *   A cycloaddition between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene. Both molecules have π bonds that can participate.\n    *   Under photochemical conditions, a [2+2] cycloaddition between two alkene systems is allowed by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules (specifically, a [suprafacial + suprafacial] approach). This involves one π bond from hexafluorobenzene (a 2π electron system) and the π bond from cyclobutene (another 2π electron system).\n    *   This first reaction is therefore a **[2+2] photocycloaddition**. It forms a bicyclic intermediate (a derivative of bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene).\n\n3.  **Identify the Second Pericyclic Reaction:**\n    *   The problem states a second photochemical pericyclic reaction occurs. This must be an intramolecular rearrangement of the intermediate formed in the first step.\n    *   The intermediate contains a 1,3-cyclohexadiene moiety, which is a conjugated 4π electron system.\n    *   Conjugated polyenes are known to undergo electrocyclic reactions under photochemical conditions. A 4π electron system undergoes a photochemically allowed electrocyclic reaction (e.g., ring-opening or ring-closing).\n    *   Therefore, the second step is a **photochemical electrocyclic reaction** involving the 4π system of the intermediate.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The two types of pericyclic reactions involved are a [2+2] cycloaddition and an electrocyclic reaction. The numbers of π electrons participating in these steps are 4 (from 2+2) for the cycloaddition and 4 for the electrocyclic reaction.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print out this conclusion, incorporating the numbers involved as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the two pericyclic reactions in the given transformation and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The first reaction is an intermolecular cycloaddition.\n    # It involves a 2-pi electron system from hexafluorobenzene and a 2-pi electron system from cyclobutene.\n    reaction1_name = \"[2+2] cycloaddition\"\n    reaction1_electrons_num1 = 2\n    reaction1_electrons_num2 = 2\n\n    # The second reaction is an intramolecular rearrangement of the intermediate.\n    # It involves the 4-pi electron conjugated diene system within the intermediate.\n    reaction2_name = \"Electrocyclic reaction\"\n    reaction2_electrons_num = 4\n\n    print(\"The two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions involved are:\")\n    print(f\"1.
