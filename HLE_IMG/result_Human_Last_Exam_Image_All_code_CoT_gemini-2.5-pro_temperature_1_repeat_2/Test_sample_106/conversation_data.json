    "This is a classic organic chemistry problem involving a carbocation rearrangement, specifically a Wagner-Meerwein shift cascade, often referred to as a backbone rearrangement in terpene chemistry.\n\n### My thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** The reaction involves an alcohol (the starting material) treated with a strong acid (HCl) and heat, producing an alkene (the product) and water. This is a dehydration reaction that proceeds via a carbocation intermediate.\n2.  **Propose the mechanism:**\n    *   **Step A: Protonation and Leaving Group Formation:** The hydroxyl (-OH) group on the starting material is protonated by HCl to form a good leaving group, water (-OH₂⁺).\n    *   **Step B: Carbocation Formation:** The water molecule departs, generating a tertiary carbocation at the carbon where the OH was attached (C3).\n    *   **Step C: The Rearrangement Cascade:** A carbocation is highly reactive and will rearrange to a more stable state if possible. In this complex fused-ring system, this occurs through a series of consecutive 1,2-shifts (a migrating group moves to an adjacent positively charged carbon). The driving force is the formation of a stable tertiary carbocation at each step. Let's trace the cascade:\n        1.  A methyl group (CH₃) from C4 migrates to the carbocation at C3. A new carbocation forms at C4.\n        2.  A hydride (H⁻) from C5 migrates to the carbocation at C4. A new carbocation forms at C5.\n        3.  The methyl group from C10 migrates to the carbocation at C5. A new carbocation forms at C10.\n        4.  The hydride (H⁻) from C9 migrates to the carbocation at C10. A new carbocation forms at C9.\n        5.  The methyl group from C8 migrates to the carbocation at C9. A new carbocation forms at C8.\n        6.  The methyl group from C14 migrates to the carbocation at C8. A new carbocation forms at C14.\n        7.  The methyl group from C13 migrates to the carbocation at C14. A new carbocation forms at C13.\n    *   **Step D: Elimination:** The rearrangement cascade stops when it reaches the C13 carbocation. A proton (H⁺) is then eliminated from an adjacent carbon (C12) to form the final, stable tetrasubstituted alkene. This regenerates the acid catalyst.\n3.  **Determine the final substituents:** Now, I'll track what group ends up at each numbered position in the final product.\n    *   **Position 1 (at C4):** The starting C4 has two methyl groups. One migrates to C3, and the other one remains. Thus, position 1 is a **CH₃**.\n    *   **Position 2 (at C10):** The original methyl group at C10 migrates to C5. The hydrogen from C9 moves to C10. Thus, position 2 is an **H**.\n    *   **Position 3 (at C5):** The original hydrogen at C5 migrates to C4. The methyl group from C10 moves to C5. Thus, position 3 is a **CH₃**.\n    *   **Position 4 (at C8):** The original methyl group at C8 migrates to C9. The methyl group from C14 moves to C8. Thus, position 4 is a **CH₃**.\n    *   **Position 5 (at C9):** The original hydrogen at C9 migrates to C10. The methyl group from C8 moves to C9. Thus, position 5 is a **CH₃**.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis of the reaction mechanism, I can now determine the identity of each substituent. The following Python code will print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rearrangement():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the substituents at the numbered positions\n    in the product of the given chemical reaction.\n\n    The reaction is an acid-catalyzed dehydration followed by a cascade of\n    1,2-Wagner-Meerwein shifts (a \"backbone rearrangement\").\n\n    Mechanism breakdown and substituent tracking:\n    1.  The -OH group leaves, forming a carbocation at C3.\n    2.  A series of 1,2-shifts occur to stabilize the charge:\n        - 1,2-CH3 shift from C4 to C3. Cation at C4.\n        - 1,2-H shift from C5 to C4. Cation at C5.\n        - 1,2-CH3 shift from C10 to C5. Cation at C10.\n        - 1,2-H shift from C9 to C10. Cation at C9.\n        - 1,2-CH3 shift from C8 to C9. Cation at C8.\n        - 1,2-CH3 shift from C14 to C8. Cation at C14.\n        - 1,2-CH3 shift from C13 to C14. Cation at C13.\n    3.  A proton is eliminated from C12 to form the final double bond.\n\n    Tracking the substituents to their final positions:\n    - Position 1 (at C4): One of the two original CH3 groups from C4 remains.\n    - Position 2 (at C10): The H from C9 migrates here.\n    - Position 3 (at C5): The CH3 from C10 migrates here.\n    - Position 4 (at C8): The CH3 from C14 migrates here.\n    - Position 5 (at C9): The CH3 from C8 migrates here.\n    \"\"\"\n    substituents = {\n        1: \"CH3\",\n        2: \"H\",\n        3: \"CH3\",\n        4: \"CH3\",\n        5: \"CH3\"\n    }\n\n    # Format the output as requested: 1 = V, 2 = W, 3 = X, 4 = Y, 5 = Z\n    output_parts = []\n    for position in sorted(substituents.keys()):\n        substituent = substituents[position]\n        output_parts.append(f\"{position} = {substituent}\")\n\n    print(\", \".join(output_parts))\n\nsolve_rearrangement()\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = CH3>>>"
