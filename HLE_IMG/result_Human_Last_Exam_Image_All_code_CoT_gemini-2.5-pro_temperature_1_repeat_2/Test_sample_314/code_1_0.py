    This function provides the solution to the graphene band structure puzzle based on the reasoning outlined above.
    The final answer is a four-digit number representing the simulation indices ordered by the conditions they meet.
    
    1. Minimum t: Simulation 2 (smallest overall energy scale).
    2. Minimum |s|: Simulation 3 (most symmetric bands).
    3. Unique sign(s): Simulation 4 (by elimination).
    4. Maximum s: Simulation 1 (most asymmetric bands).
    
    The ordered indices are 2, 3, 4, 1.
