    "This is a depiction of a famous scene from Greek mythology, illustrated on an Apulian red-figure vase.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to identify the figure:\n1.  **Analyze the scene:** The image shows a chariot, a driver, a passenger, a dead body on the ground, and a winged figure overhead. The style of the vase and the dramatic content are characteristic of South Italian vase painting from the 4th century BC.\n2.  **Identify the characters:**\n    *   The driver wears a Phrygian cap and a patterned sleeved garment, which in Greek art signifies an \"oriental\" or foreign origin.\n    *   The chariot is being drawn by winged creatures (only the wings are clearly visible), indicating it is a magical or divine vehicle.\n    *   There is a dead, nude male on the ground in front of the chariot.\n    *   Another figure, seemingly a lifeless body, is in the chariot with the driver.\n    *   A winged deity with a torch hovers above.\n3.  **Identify the myth:** This collection of elements strongly points to the myth of **Medea**. After her husband Jason abandoned her for a new bride, Medea took revenge by murdering their two sons. She then escaped from Corinth in a magical chariot, drawn by winged serpents, sent by her grandfather, the sun-god Helios. This vase depicts the climax of the story, as told in Euripides' play *Medea*.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The driver of the chariot, the figure in the oriental costume who is actively leaving the scene of the crime, is **Medea**. The bodies of her two murdered sons are with herâ€”one on the ground and the other in the chariot with her. The winged figure is likely a Fury (an avenging spirit) representing the horror of the act. The question asks who is leaving the chariot; Medea is the agent of this departure.\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the main figure leaving in the chariot based on the mythological scene depicted on the vase.\n    The scene is Medea's escape from Corinth.\n    \"\"\"\n    figure_name = \"Medea\"\n    print(f\"The figure driving the chariot and leaving Corinth is {figure_name}.\")\n\nsolve_task()\n```\n<<<Medea>>>"
