    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my analysis of the sheet music and the corresponding Python code to reveal the answer.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the musical piece to identify it.\n1.  **Key and Time Signature:** The piece is in 4/4 time. It begins in C major (no sharps or flats in the key signature), though it quickly uses many accidentals, modulating frequently.\n2.  **Tempo and Dynamics:** The tempo is marked as quarter note = 80, which is a moderate Andante. The piece starts softly (*p*), but has a sudden dynamic shift to forte (*f*) in the third measure, indicating a dramatic change in character.\n3.  **Melody and Harmony:** The most striking feature is the abrupt change in texture. It opens with simple, quiet chords. Then, in measure 3, it erupts into loud, fast, and technically demanding sixteenth-note passages. The right hand plays ascending arpeggios and scalar patterns over broken chords and octaves in the left hand. This virtuosic style is characteristic of the Romantic era.\n4.  **Identification:** The specific pattern of a quiet opening in C major followed by these particular fast arpeggios is the unmistakable introduction to Franz Liszt's famous concert etude, \"La Campanella.\" This piece is the third of his six *Grandes études de Paganini*, S. 141.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will now provide the Python code to display the answer.\n\n```python\ndef guess_the_music():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the piece of music based on its characteristic features\n    and prints the composer and title.\n    \"\"\"\n    composer = \"Franz Liszt\"\n    title = \"La Campanella (from Grandes études de Paganini, S. 141)\"\n\n    print(f\"The sheet music is from the piece:\")\n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\n# Execute the function to reveal the answer\nguess_the_music()\n```\n<<<La Campanella by Franz Liszt>>>"
