    "Based on my analysis of the image series, I will provide a description of the biological process being depicted.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the image sequence:** I will examine the three panels (L, M, N) to understand the changes occurring over time or in different stages. The arrowheads in the images are key pointers to the area of interest.\n2.  **Identify the structure:** The subject is a filamentous, multicellular structure, characteristic of a fungal hypha or a similar organism.\n3.  **Describe the process:** I will describe the step-by-step development shown from panel L to N.\n    *   **Panel L:** Shows a straight segment of the filament. The arrowhead points to a septum (cross-wall).\n    *   **Panel M:** A new bulge or outgrowth appears at the septum indicated by the arrowhead. This is the initiation of a new structure.\n    *   **Panel N:** The bulge has grown and elongated, forming a new lateral branch. The original filament has bent at the point of branching.\n4.  **Name the process:** Based on the visual evidence, the process is identified as hyphal branching.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will create a Python script that uses the `print()` function to output the final answer, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef describe_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  Analyzes the provided image series and prints a description of the biological process.\n  \"\"\"\n  process_name = \"Hyphal Branching\"\n  \n  description = \"\"\"\nThe process depicted in the image series (L, M, N) is hyphal branching in a filamentous organism, likely a fungus.\n\nHere is a step-by-step description:\n1.  Panel L shows a mature hyphal filament. The arrowhead points to a septum, which is a cross-wall that separates cells within the hypha.\n2.  Panel M shows the initiation of a new branch. A small bulge has formed on the side of the hypha, originating from the cell behind the septum indicated by the arrowhead.\n3.  Panel N shows the further development of this bulge into a new, distinct lateral branch that is elongating.\n\nThis process allows the fungus to create a complex, interconnected network of hyphae called a mycelium, which is essential for nutrient absorption and colonization of a substrate.\n\"\"\"\n  \n  print(f\"The process shown is: {process_name}\")\n  print(description)\n\ndescribe_process()\n```\n<<<The process being depicted is hyphal branching, which is the formation of a new branch from an existing filament in an organism like a fungus.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
