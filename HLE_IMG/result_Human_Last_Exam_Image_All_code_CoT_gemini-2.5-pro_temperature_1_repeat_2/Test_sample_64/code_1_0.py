The process depicted in the image series (L, M, N) is hyphal branching in a filamentous organism, likely a fungus.

Here is a step-by-step description:
1.  Panel L shows a mature hyphal filament. The arrowhead points to a septum, which is a cross-wall that separates cells within the hypha.
2.  Panel M shows the initiation of a new branch. A small bulge has formed on the side of the hypha, originating from the cell behind the septum indicated by the arrowhead.
3.  Panel N shows the further development of this bulge into a new, distinct lateral branch that is elongating.

This process allows the fungus to create a complex, interconnected network of hyphae called a mycelium, which is essential for nutrient absorption and colonization of a substrate.
