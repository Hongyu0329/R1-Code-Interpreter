    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 1:** \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n    *   The image shows an awards ceremony. A reverse image search combined with the date \"June 20, 2019\" identifies the event as the 2019 NHL Awards in Las Vegas.\n    *   The man receiving the award is hockey player Nikita Kucherov.\n    *   On that night, Kucherov won three major awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player as voted by players), and the Art Ross Trophy (top point scorer).\n    *   Winning three major awards in one event is commonly referred to as a \"hat trick\" of awards. This gives us a strong candidate for \"X Y\": **Hat Trick**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 2:** \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n    *   I need to see if \"Hat Trick\" fits this clue.\n    *   The term \"hat trick\" originated in cricket in 1858. When a bowler took three wickets on three consecutive balls, a collection was taken, and he was presented with a new hat to commemorate the achievement.\n    *   This links the term to the hat-making industry.\n    *   In the 18th and 19th centuries, hat makers (hatters) used a process called \"carroting\" to turn fur into felt for hats. This process involved using mercuric nitrate, a toxic mercury salt.\n    *   Chronic exposure to mercury vapors caused neurological damage in hatters, leading to symptoms like tremors and dementia. This is the origin of the phrase \"mad as a hatter\".\n    *   Due to the toxicity of mercury, its use in hat-making has been discontinued.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The term \"Hat Trick\" perfectly connects both clues. The first clue refers to Nikita Kucherov's \"hat trick\" of awards at the 2019 NHL Awards. The second clue refers to the historical hat-making process, the origin of the term's prize, which used toxic mercury salts.\n\nNow, I will write a Python script to present this solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the step-by-step solution to the riddle.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the first clue.\")\n    print(\"The image is from the 2019 NHL Awards, held on June 20, 2019.\")\n    print(\"Hockey player Nikita Kucherov is pictured receiving one of three major awards he won that night.\")\n    print(\"Winning three significant awards is often called a 'hat trick'.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the second clue.\")\n    print(\"The second clue mentions a connection to the toxicity of mercury salts.\")\n    print(\"The term 'hat trick' originated in cricket, where a player accomplishing the feat was rewarded with a new hat.\")\n    print(\"Historically, the hat-making (hatter) industry used mercury salts to process felt for hats.\")\n    print(\"This process was highly toxic, leading to mercury poisoning in hatters (the origin of the phrase 'mad as a hatter'), and has since been discontinued.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: The term 'X Y' that connects both clues is 'Hat Trick'.\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
