    print("This disruption weakens the collective intermolecular forces that hold the nematic phase together.")
    print("\nConclusion for Part 2: A less stable nematic phase will transition to the disordered isotropic phase at a lower temperature. Therefore, the addition of the methyl group is expected to decrease the nematic-isotropic transition temperature (T_NI).\n")
