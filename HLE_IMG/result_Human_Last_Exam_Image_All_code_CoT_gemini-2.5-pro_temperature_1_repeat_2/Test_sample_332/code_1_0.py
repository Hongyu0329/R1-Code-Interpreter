    # The etymology of Nightingale is from Old English 'niht' (night) + 'galan' (to sing).

    # The riddle asks for the value of Y.
    # The reasoning is that the image of Earth from space (the "Pale Blue Dot")
    # is a "Song" (a beautiful, poignant message) from the "Night" (the vastness of space).
    # This aligns with Carl Sagan's sentiments.
