    "The main difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that allows for identification at a glance lies in the **seta** (the stalk that supports the capsule).\n\n*   In **Grimmia montana**, the seta is short and **straight**, causing the capsule to be held upright and emergent from the gametophyte leaves.\n*   In **Grimmia curviseta**, as its name suggests (*curvi* = curved, *seta* = stalk), the seta is distinctly **curved or arcuate**, which makes the capsule hang to the side or nod downwards.\n\nThis difference in the orientation of the capsule, dictated by the shape of the seta, is the most obvious distinguishing feature. The provided image shows capsules that are held upright on what appear to be straight setae, which is characteristic of *Grimmia montana*.\n\n```python\ndef explain_grimmia_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the main visual difference between the sporophytes of\n    Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n    \"\"\"\n    main_difference = \"The primary distinguishing feature is the shape of the seta (the stalk supporting the spore capsule).\"\n\n    g_montana_desc = \"Grimmia montana: Has a short, STRAIGHT seta.
