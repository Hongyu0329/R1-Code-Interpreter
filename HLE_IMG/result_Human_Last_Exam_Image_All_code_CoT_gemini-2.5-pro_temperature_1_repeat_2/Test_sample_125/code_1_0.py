# The problem asks for the minimum number of steps for a complex organic synthesis.
# Based on a plausible synthetic pathway involving a sequence of well-established
# organic reactions (Condensation, Michael Addition, Cyclizations, Scholl Reaction),
# a reasonable estimate for the minimum number of steps is 6.

# Step 1: Claisen-Schmidt Condensation of 2-acetylnaphthalene and benzaldehyde.
# Step 2: Michael Addition with another molecule of 2-acetylnaphthalene enolate.
# Step 3: Intramolecular Aldol Condensation to form a new ring.
# Step 4: Dehydration and Aromatization of the aldol product.
# Step 5: Acid-catalyzed Intramolecular Cyclization (Friedel-Crafts type) to build the core.
# Step 6: Final Oxidative Cyclodehydrogenation (Scholl Reaction) to form the target.
