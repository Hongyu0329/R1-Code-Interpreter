def solve_stereochemistry():
    """
    This function determines the stereochemical assignment (R/S) for the four
    stereocenters in the provided reaction scheme and prints the result.

    The analysis is as follows:
    1.  The reaction is an esterification that retains the stereochemistry of the reactants.
    2.  Stereocenter 1 (Acid Chloride): The priorities are (1)-OCH3, (2)-COCl, (3)-CF3, (4)-C6H5.
        The configuration is determined to be (R).
    3.  Stereocenter 2 (Alcohol): The priorities are (1)-OH, (2)-CH2OMe, (3)-CH2CH(CH3)2, (4)-H.
        The configuration is determined to be (R).
    4.  Stereocenters in the Product: The configurations are retained from the reactants. The
        alcohol-derived center is (R) and the acid-derived center is (R).
    5.  The sequence from left to right in the scheme is:
        - Reactant 1: R
        - Reactant 2: R
        - Product (left, from alcohol): R
        - Product (right, from acid): R
