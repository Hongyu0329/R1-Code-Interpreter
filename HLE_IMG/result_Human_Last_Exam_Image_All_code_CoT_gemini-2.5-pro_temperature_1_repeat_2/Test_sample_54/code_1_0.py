# This script identifies the reagents A and B in the provided chemical reaction scheme.

# Analysis of the transformation from compound 1 to compound 2:
# In this step, one of the oxygen atoms within the heterocyclic core of compound 1,
# which is part of a pyrylium salt structure, is replaced.
# The new group is an N-NH2 group, forming an N-aminopyridinium salt (compound 2).
# This specific transformation is achieved by reacting the pyrylium salt with hydrazine.
reagent_A = "hydrazine (H2N-NH2)"

# Analysis of the transformation from compound 2 to compound 3:
# In this step, the remaining oxygen atom in the heterocyclic core of compound 2
# is replaced by a nitrogen atom that is substituted with a propyl group.
# This requires a primary amine, specifically n-propylamine, to form the final
# quinacridinium skeleton of compound 3.
reagent_B = "n-propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)"

# Output the reagents corresponding to each step in the reaction.
