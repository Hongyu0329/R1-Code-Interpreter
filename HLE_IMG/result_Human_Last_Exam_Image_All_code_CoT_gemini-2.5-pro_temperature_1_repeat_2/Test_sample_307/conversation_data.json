    "To find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm of the nine Wigner 3-j symbols, we need to analyze the provided image. The infinity-norm of each symbol corresponds to the element with the largest absolute value, which is represented by the most intense color (deepest red or deepest green) in each of the nine heatmaps.\n\nHere is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the Visualization:** The nine heatmaps use a diverging color scale where white represents zero, and the intensity of red (positive) or green (negative) represents the magnitude of the value. The infinity-norm for each subplot is therefore determined by the pixel with the most saturated color.\n2.  **Quantify Intensity:** A good proxy for the color intensity in this red-green scale is the absolute difference between the red (R) and green (G) channel values of a pixel's color. Grayscale pixels (white background, black borders) will have a low `|R - G|` value and can be filtered out.\n3.  **Implement a Script:** I will write a Python script that loads the image, splits it into the nine subplots, and calculates the maximum `|R - G|` value for each one. This value represents the infinity-norm for that subplot.\n4.  **Calculate the Ratio:** After obtaining the nine infinity-norm values, the script will identify the maximum and minimum values among them and compute their ratio. The final output will display the full equation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation. Please save the image from the problem description as `wigner_symbols.png` in the same directory where you run this script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom PIL import Image\n\ndef solve_wigner_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm\n    from an image of nine Wigner 3-j symbol heatmaps.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Load the image.
