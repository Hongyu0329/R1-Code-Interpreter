    "The title of the jazz standard is \"All the Things You Are\" and the composer is Jerome Kern.\n\nThe piece was originally written for the 1939 musical *Very Warm for May*, with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. It has since become a highly popular jazz standard due to its strong melody and sophisticated chord progression. While the original key is Ab Major, it is very commonly played in other keys, including F minor, as shown in the provided sheet music.\n\nThe sheet music in the image features a common jazz reharmonization of the opening bars, using a \"line clich√©\" with a descending chromatic bass line (F, E, Eb, Db). This harmonic substitution adds a different flavor to the original progression. Many famous jazz artists have recorded \"All the Things You Are,\" including Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, Charlie Parker, and Tony Bennett.\n\n<<<All the Things You Are, Jerome Kern>>>"
