    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules to assign R or S configuration to each chiral center.\n\n### **1. Identify the Parent Chain and Chiral Centers**\n\nFirst, let's identify the parent chain and number the carbon atoms. The principal functional group is the amine (-NH2), so it receives the lowest possible number. The longest carbon chain containing the carbon bonded to the amine group is a pentane chain.\n\nThe IUPAC name is **3-Ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-methylpentan-1-amine**.\n\nThe chiral centers (carbons with four different substituents) are at positions C2, C3, and C4.\n\n### **2. Determine the Configuration of Each Chiral Center**\n\n**Chiral Center at C2 (Carbon with the methyl group):**\n*   **Substituents:** -H (implied, wedged), -CH3 (dashed), -CH2NH2, and the rest of the carbon chain (-C3).\n*   **Assign Priorities (based on atomic number):**\n    1.  **-CH2NH2**: The carbon is bonded to Nitrogen (higher atomic number than carbon).\n    2.  **-CH(Et)CH(OH)CH3** (Rest of the chain at C3): The carbon is bonded to other carbons.\n    3.  **-CH3**: The carbon is bonded only to hydrogens.\n    4.  **-H**: Lowest atomic number.\n*   **Determine Configuration:** The lowest priority group (-H) is on a wedge (pointing towards the viewer). The sequence from priority 1 to 2 to 3 is clockwise (R). Since the lowest priority group is pointing towards the viewer, we reverse the configuration.\n    *   **Configuration at C2 is S.**\n\n**Chiral Center at C3 (Carbon with the ethyl group):**\n*   **Substituents:** -H (implied, dashed), -CH2CH3 (wedged), the chain towards C2, and the chain towards C4.\n*   **Assign Priorities:**\n    1.  **-CH(OH)CH3** (Chain at C4): This carbon is bonded to an Oxygen atom.\n    2.  **-CH(CH3)CH2NH2** (Chain at C2): This carbon is bonded to two other carbons (one of which leads to a nitrogen).\n    3.  **-CH2CH3** (Ethyl group): This carbon is bonded to one other carbon and two hydrogens.\n    4.  **-H**: Lowest priority.\n*   **Determine Configuration:** The lowest priority group (-H) is on a dash (pointing away from the viewer). The sequence from 1 to 2 to 3 is counter-clockwise (S). Since the lowest priority group is pointing away, the configuration is as assigned.\n    *   **Configuration at C3 is S.**\n\n**Chiral Center at C4 (Carbon with the hydroxyl group):**\n*   **Substituents:** -H (implied, wedged), -OH (dashed), -CH3 (terminal methyl), and the rest of the carbon chain (-C3).\n*   **Assign Priorities:**\n    1.  **-OH**: Oxygen has the highest atomic number.\n    2.  **-CH(Et)CH(CH3)CH2NH2** (Rest of the chain at C3): Carbon bonded to other carbons.\n    3.  **-CH3**: Carbon bonded only to hydrogens.\n    4.  **-H**: Lowest priority.\n*   **Determine Configuration:** The lowest priority group (-H) is on a wedge (pointing towards the viewer). The sequence from 1 to 2 to 3 is counter-clockwise (S). Since the lowest priority group is pointing towards the viewer, we reverse the configuration.\n    *   **Configuration at C4 is R.**\n\nThe complete absolute configuration of the molecule is (2S, 3S, 4R).\n\n<<<The absolute configuration of the molecule is (2S, 3S, 4R).>>>"
