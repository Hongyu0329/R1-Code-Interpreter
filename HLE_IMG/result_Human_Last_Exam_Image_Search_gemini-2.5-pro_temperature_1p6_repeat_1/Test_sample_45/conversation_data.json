    "The tiling in the image is known as the Ammann-Beenker tiling. By examining the arrangement of the tiles, we can identify points around which the entire pattern can be rotated to match its original position.\n\nThe constituent shapes are squares and rhombuses. Notice the prominent eight-pointed stars formed by eight rhombuses meeting at a central point. These stars are a key feature of the tiling's symmetry.\n\nThe smallest angle of rotation that leaves the tiling looking the same is 45 degrees, which is 360/8. This can be seen by focusing on one of the central points of the eight-pointed stars. Rotating the entire pattern by 45 degrees around this point will result in the pattern perfectly aligning with its original state.\n\nThis indicates that the tiling possesses 8-fold rotational symmetry. While there are local centers of 2-fold and 4-fold rotational symmetry, the global symmetry of the infinite tiling is 8-fold. The Ammann-Beenker tiling is a well-known example of a quasiperiodic tiling with this type of symmetry. It is a non-periodic tiling, meaning it does not have translational symmetry.\n\n<<<8-fold>>>"
