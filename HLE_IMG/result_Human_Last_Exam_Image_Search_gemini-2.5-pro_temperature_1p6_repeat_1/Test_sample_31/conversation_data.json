    "The knot in the picture is the 8₁₈ knot. The Rasmussen invariant, also known as the s-invariant, is a knot invariant that provides a lower bound for the smooth 4-genus of a knot. For the 8₁₈ knot, the Rasmussen s-invariant is 0.\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant is derived from the Khovanov homology of a knot. It is a powerful tool in knot theory for studying the slicing and unknotting properties of knots. For alternating knots, the Rasmussen invariant is equal to the knot signature.\n\n<<<0>>>"
