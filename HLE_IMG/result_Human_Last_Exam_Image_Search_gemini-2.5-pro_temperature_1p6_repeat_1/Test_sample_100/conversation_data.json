    "To determine the molecular formula of the final product, we must trace the transformation of the starting material through each reaction step.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material and the First Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is a bicyclic lactam. It features a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group protecting the nitrogen atom and a trifluoromethyl (CF₃) group attached to the carbon-carbon double bond. Its chemical structure is a derivative of 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    *   The molecular formula of the starting material is C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂.\n*   **Reaction 1:** The reagents are ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) in a mixture of acetonitrile (ACN) and water (H₂O). CAN is a standard reagent used for the oxidative deprotection of PMB ethers and amines. In this step, the PMB group is cleaved from the nitrogen atom.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this first step is the deprotected lactam, 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    *   To find its molecular formula, we remove the PMB group (C₈H₉O) from the starting material and add a hydrogen atom to the nitrogen.\n    *   Molecular formula of Intermediate 1: C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂ - C₈H₉O + H = C₇H₆F₃NO.\n\n**Step 2: Hydrogenation**\n\n*   **Reaction 2:** Intermediate 1 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium on carbon catalyst (Pd/C) in methanol (MeOH). This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction.\n*   **Transformation:** This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond within the bicyclic system to a single bond. This involves the addition of two hydrogen atoms across the double bond.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The resulting molecule is 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n    *   Molecular formula of Intermediate 2: C₇H₆F₃NO + H₂ = C₇H₈F₃NO.\n\n**Step 3: Hydrolysis**\n\n*   **Reaction 3:** Intermediate 2 is heated with 4 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 70 °C. These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide or, in this case, a lactam (a cyclic amide).\n*   **Transformation:** The hydrolysis reaction cleaves the amide bond within the lactam ring (the bond between the carbonyl carbon and the nitrogen). This process consumes one molecule of water (H₂O) and opens the ring, yielding a carboxylic acid from the carbonyl carbon and an amine from the nitrogen atom. The product is an amino acid with a cyclopentane core.\n*   **Final Product:** The final product is 4-amino-3-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid.\n    *   To find its molecular formula, we add one molecule of water (H₂O) to the formula of Intermediate 2.\n    *   Molecular formula of Final Product: C₇H₈F₃NO + H₂O = **C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂**.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
