    "The main difference in the sporophyte that helps distinguish *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the seta, which is the stalk that supports the capsule.\n\nIn *Grimmia montana*, the seta is **straight**, holding the capsule erect and exserted (above the leaves). Conversely, *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by a **curved (or arcuate) seta**, which causes the capsule to be held at an angle or horizontally.\n\nTo summarize:\n*   ***Grimmia montana***: Straight seta\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta***: Curved (arcuate) seta\n\nAdditionally, the capsules of *Grimmia montana* do not have stomata (pores), a feature absent in *Grimmia curviseta*. However, the straight versus curved nature of the seta is the most readily observable difference for identification at a glance.\n\n<<<The primary distinguishing feature of the sporophyte at a glance is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a curved or arcuate seta.>>>"
