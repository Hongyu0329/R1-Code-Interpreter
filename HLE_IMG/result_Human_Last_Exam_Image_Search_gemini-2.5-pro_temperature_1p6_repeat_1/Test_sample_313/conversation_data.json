    "The two clues point to the \"Hart Trophy\".\n\n**Clue 1: An Event on June 20, 2019**\n\nThe image provided shows an awards ceremony. The man on the right, with the beard, is professional hockey player Nikita Kucherov. The event is the 2019 NHL Awards, which took place in Las Vegas on Wednesday, June 19, 2019. Although the specific date mentioned in the prompt is June 20, news articles reporting on the event were published on that date.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Kucherov won three prestigious awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy, the Ted Lindsay Award, and the Art Ross Trophy. The trophy he is pictured receiving is the Hart Memorial Trophy, awarded to the player judged to be the most valuable to his team.\n\n**Clue 2: The Toxicity of Mercury Salts**\n\nThe second clue refers to a process that has almost ceased due to the toxicity of mercury salts. This process is related to the manufacturing of felt hats. Historically, mercury nitrate was used in a process called \"carroting\" to treat the fur used for making felt hats. This process made the felt higher quality.\n\nHowever, the use of mercury had severe health consequences for hat makers, leading to a neurological disorder known as \"mad hatter disease\" or erethism. Symptoms included tremors, behavioral changes, and memory loss, which gave rise to the phrase \"mad as a hatter\". Due to these toxic effects, the use of mercury in hat production was eventually discontinued.\n\nThe connection between the two clues is the word \"Hart\". While not directly related to the felting process itself, the H-A-R-T of the Hart Trophy connects phonetically and contextually to the hatter's trade that was impacted by mercury. This clever wordplay links a modern sporting award to a historical industrial hazard.\n\n<<<Hart Trophy>>>"
