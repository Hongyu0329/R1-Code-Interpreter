    "The knot in the image is the prime knot 9₄₂, which has nine crossings.\n\nThe Jones polynomial, V(t), for the 9₄₂ knot is:\nt⁻⁴ - t⁻³ + t⁻² - t⁻¹ + 1 - t + t²\n\nFormatting this in decreasing degree order gives:\nt² - t + 1 - t⁻¹ + t⁻² - t⁻³ + t⁻⁴\n\n<<<t^2 - t + 1 - t^-1 + t^-2 - t^-3 + t^-4>>>"
