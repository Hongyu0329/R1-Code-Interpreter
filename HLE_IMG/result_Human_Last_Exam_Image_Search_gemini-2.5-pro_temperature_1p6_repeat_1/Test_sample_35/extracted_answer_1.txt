The protein S100B binds with strong affinity to the V-domain of the RAGE receptor. It can be utilized as both an adjunct and a prognostic marker. It functions as an adjunct marker due to its low specificity, helping to indicate general neuroinflammation across various disorders. However, its direct role in driving pathological cascades and its strong correlation with disease severity and outcomes in specific conditions like traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer's, and multiple sclerosis establish it more significantly as a prognostic marker for assessing the likely course of neurological pathologies.
