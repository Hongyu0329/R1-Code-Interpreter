    "The image provided is completely black and does not contain any molecules. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the isomeric relationship between the \"molecules mentioned above\".\n\nTo answer the question, I would need to see the chemical structures of the molecules in question. Based on their structures, I could determine their relationship according to the following definitions:\n\n*   **Constitutional (or structural) isomers** have the same molecular formula but a different connectivity or bonding arrangement of atoms.\n*   **Stereoisomers** have the same molecular formula and the same connectivity, but they differ in the three-dimensional arrangement of their atoms in space. Stereoisomers can be further divided into:\n    *   **Conformational isomers (conformers)**: These are different spatial arrangements of the same molecule that can be interconverted by rotation around single bonds. They are often considered different representations of the *same* molecule because they interconvert rapidly at room temperature.\n    *   **Configurational isomers**: These are stereoisomers that can only be interconverted by breaking and re-forming chemical bonds. They include enantiomers and diastereomers.\n        *   **Enantiomers** are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, much like a person's left and right hands.\n        *   **Diastereomers** are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. This category includes geometric isomers like *cis-trans* or *E/Z* isomers.\n*   **Identical** molecules have the same molecular formula, the same connectivity, and the same three-dimensional arrangement. They can be superimposed on each other.\n\nWithout the molecular structures, I cannot select the correct option from (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e).\n\n"
