    "Based on visual analysis of the pictograph and comparison with the evolution of cuneiform signs, the image provided is an archaic form of the Sumerian sign **GAR**, also read as **NINDA**.\n\nThis sign is a pictograph of a ration bowl. In its third-millennium BCE context, it was used as a logogram to mean \"bread,\" \"food,\" or \"ration.\" The sign GAR (ð’ƒ») is a Sumerogram for the Akkadian word *akalu*, which means \"food\" or \"bread\".\n\nTherefore, the correct meaning of the cuneiform sign in its third-millennium form is bread.\n\n<<<C>>>"
