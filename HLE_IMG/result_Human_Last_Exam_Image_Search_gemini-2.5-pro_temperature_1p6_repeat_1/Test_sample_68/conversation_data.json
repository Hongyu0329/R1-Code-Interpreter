    "This copper coin is a 9 Deniers piece, struck between 1721 and 1722 for circulation in the French colonies in the Americas. It does not originate from a single, specific colony but was intended for use across several French territories.\n\nThese coins were authorized by an edict from King Louis XV in June 1721 to address the need for small change in the colonies. The mints responsible for their production were in La Rochelle (indicated by the \"H\" mintmark) and Rouen (with a \"B\" mintmark).\n\nThe territories for which these coins were intended included:\n*   **New France**, which encompassed a vast area of North America.\n*   **Louisiana**\n*   **Acadia**\n*   **Canada**\n*   **The French West Indies** (Caribbean)\n\nOne side of the coin features the inscription \"COLONIES FRANÃ‡OISES\" along with the date. The other side displays two crossed \"L\"s under a crown, which was a symbol for King Louis XV, and the Latin legend \"SIT NOMEN DOMINI BENEDICTUM,\" meaning \"Blessed be the name of the Lord.\"\n\nInterestingly, the colonists initially resisted using these coins. A significant quantity was returned to France in 1726. However, the West India Company later successfully redistributed the 9 denier coins in Louisiana, leading to them sometimes being referred to as \"Louisiana Coppers.\"\n\n<<<French Colonies in the Americas (specifically including New France, Louisiana, Acadia, and the French West Indies)>>>"
