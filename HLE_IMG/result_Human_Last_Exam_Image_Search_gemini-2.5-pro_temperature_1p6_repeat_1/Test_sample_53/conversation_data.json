    "The scene depicted on this Apulian red-figure pelike, likely dating to around 420-400 B.C., portrays a mythological victory, with the central figure leaving the chariot being the hero at the moment of his triumph. Based on the specific visual details, the most probable identification of this figure is **Pelops**, and the scene represents his victory in the chariot race against King Oenomaus.\n\n### Detailed Analysis of the Scene\n\nThe vase painting brings together several key figures and symbols that point towards a specific heroic tale:\n\n*   **The Figure Leaving the Chariot (Pelops):** This is the victorious hero, Pelops. Originally from Phrygia (a region in modern-day Turkey), he sought to marry Hippodamia. The image captures the climactic moment of his success. His ascent from the chariot is symbolic of his victory and elevation in status. In some myths, the god Poseidon gifted Pelops a divine chariot and horses to help him win the race.\n\n*   **The Charioteer (Hippodamia or a servant):** The figure driving the chariot is shown wearing an elaborate, patterned garment and a Phrygian cap, a style associated with people from the East in Greek art. This figure is likely **Hippodamia**, the daughter of the defeated king. By siding with Pelops and helping him sabotage her father's chariot, she was a crucial part of his victory. Her depiction in this distinctive attire may emphasize the dramatic and foreign origins of the myth's protagonist.\n\n*   **The Winged Figure (Nike):** Flying above the chariot is Nike, the winged goddess of Victory. Her presence is a clear indicator of a triumphant outcome, and she appears ready to crown the victor. The inclusion of Nike is common in scenes depicting significant victories, both military and athletic, including famous chariot races.\n\n*   **The Figure on the Ground (King Oenomaus):** Lying defeated behind the chariot wheel is King Oenomaus of Pisa. According to prophecy, he was destined to be killed by his son-in-law. To prevent this, he challenged all of his daughter Hippodamia's suitors to a deadly chariot race, killing them after they were defeated. The naked, lifeless figure represents the vanquished king, killed as a result of Pelops's victory.\n\nWhile the scene bears a resemblance to the common \"Apotheosis of Herakles,\" where the hero ascends to Olympus in a chariot driven by Athena or Nike, the specific details—most notably the Phrygian cap of the driver—make the victory of Pelops a more fitting interpretation. The artist is believed to be from the circle of the **Painter of the Berlin Dancing Girl**, one of the pioneering artists of the Apulian style.\n\n<<<Pelops"
