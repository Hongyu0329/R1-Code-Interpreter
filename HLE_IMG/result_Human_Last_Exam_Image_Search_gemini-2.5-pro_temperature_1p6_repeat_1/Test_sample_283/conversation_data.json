    "The Google Trends graph displays interest in three major annual holidays in **China**. The recurring peaks in search volume correspond to the dates of these significant national events.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the evidence:\n\n*   **The Red Line (Chinese New Year):** This line shows a prominent, recurring spike every year between late January and mid-February, which aligns with the timing of the Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival. The highest peak for this term occurs in late January 2020. This timing directly corresponds with the initial COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown of Wuhan, which began on January 23, 2020, just before the New Year celebrations. This explains the unusually high search interest at that time.\n\n*   **The Yellow Line (National Day):** This line shows a sharp peak every year around the beginning of October. This corresponds to the National Day of the People's Republic of China, which is celebrated on October 1st and kicks off a week-long holiday known as \"Golden Week\". The graph shows a particularly massive spike in October 2023, reaching the maximum interest level of 100. This is explained by the 2023 Golden Week being combined with the Mid-Autumn Festival, creating an extended 8-day holiday that led to a massive surge in domestic travel after the end of COVID-related restrictions.\n\n*   **The Blue Line (Labour Day):** The smaller, yet consistent, peaks in early May correspond to China's Labour Day holiday. The holiday period around May 1st is another significant travel period in China, which has recently grown into a five-day holiday, further explaining the consistent search interest.\n\nThe distinct annual patterns of these three trend lines, including the specific timing of their outlier peaks, strongly correlate with the schedule and surrounding major events of Chinese New Year, National Day, and Labour Day.\n\n<<<China>>>"
