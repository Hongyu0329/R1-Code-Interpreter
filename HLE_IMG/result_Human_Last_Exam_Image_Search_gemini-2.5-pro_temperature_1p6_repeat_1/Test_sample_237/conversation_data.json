    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. It is an insect, specifically a type of longhorn beetle. Its scientific name is *Stictoleptura rubra* (formerly known as *Corymbia rubra*).\n\nThis beetle is also commonly known as the red-brown longhorn beetle. It exhibits significant sexual dimorphism, meaning the males and females have different appearances. The insect in the picture is likely a male, characterized by its black head and thorax and brownish-yellow to reddish elytra (wing cases). In contrast, females typically have a red head, pronotum, and elytra.\n\nThe larvae of *Stictoleptura rubra* develop in the dead wood of coniferous trees like pines, firs, and larches. Adults are often seen on flowers during the summer months, where they feed on nectar and pollen. The complete life cycle of this beetle lasts for two to three years. This species is found across Europe, Russia, North Africa, and Turkey.\n\n<<<Stictoleptura rubra>>>"
