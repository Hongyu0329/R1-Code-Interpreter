    "Based on its style, this medallion is ascribed by archaeologists to the 1st century A.D.\n\nThis artifact is identified as a gold Sarmatian medallion, specifically one of a pair of gold discs discovered in a burial mound (kurgan) near the village of Kosika in the Astrakhan region of Russia. These pieces are characteristic of Sarmatian art from that period, which was influenced by both Hellenistic and Iranian artistic traditions.\n\nThe Sarmatians were a confederation of Iranian nomadic peoples who dominated the Pontic-Caspian steppe from roughly the 5th century B.C. to the 4th century A.D. The 1st century A.D. was a period when rich elite burials, such as the one at Kosika, became prominent. The artifacts found in these graves often include intricate gold work.\n\n<<<1st century A.D.>>>"
