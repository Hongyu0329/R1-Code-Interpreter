    "The image displays a phenomenon where a continuous tone, interrupted by a burst of noise, is perceived by the listener as being uninterrupted. The top part of the image, a spectrogram, illustrates how the line representing the tone appears to continue through the wider band of noise. This perceptual \"filling-in\" of missing auditory information is a well-documented auditory illusion.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as the **auditory continuity illusion** or **perceptual restoration** of sound. The brain essentially assumes that the tone continues behind the interrupting noise, much like the visual system assumes an object continues behind an obstruction. For the illusion to occur, the interrupting noise must be sufficiently loud and share appropriate frequency characteristics with the tone it is masking.\n\nThis illusion is a fundamental example of auditory scene analysis, where the brain organizes a complex auditory environment into distinct streams of sound. It is also related to the \"Law of Continuity,\" one of the Gestalt principles of perception.\n\nThe comparison to the Necker Cube is apt because both illusions highlight the constructive nature of perception. Just as the Necker Cube can lead to bistable perception (two stable interpretations of one ambiguous stimulus), the auditory continuity illusion demonstrates how the brain actively constructs a continuous perceptual experience from discontinuous sensory input. Research has specifically noted that bistable dynamics can produce the continuous responses seen in this illusion.\n\nThis ability is considered common and often unconscious, playing a crucial role in our ability to understand speech and other sounds in noisy environments where parts of the signal may be momentarily obscured.\n\n<<<auditory continuity illusion"
