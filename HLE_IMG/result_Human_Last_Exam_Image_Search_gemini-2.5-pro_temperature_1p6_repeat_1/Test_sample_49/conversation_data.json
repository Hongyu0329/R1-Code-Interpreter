    "To determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$, we first need to find the Thevenin equivalent circuit as seen by the capacitor $C$ connected between nodes $a_0$ and $b_0$ (ground). The cutoff frequency, $\\omega_c$, for the resulting RC low-pass filter is given by $\\omega_c = 1 / (R_{th}C)$, where $R_{th}$ is the Thevenin equivalent resistance.\n\n### Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$) Calculation\n\n1.  **Deactivate Sources**: The input voltage source at `IN` (node $c_0$) is deactivated, which means node $c_0$ is connected to ground.\n2.  **Find Equivalent Resistance**: We need to find the equivalent resistance looking into terminal $a_0$ with respect to ground ($b_0$). Let's call this resistance $R_{th}$.\n\nWe can solve this by applying a test voltage $V_t$ at node $a_0$ and calculating the current $I_t$ flowing from the test source. Then, $R_{th} = V_t / I_t$. In this setup, we have $V_{a0} = V_t$ and $V_{c0} = 0$.\n\nThe network is an infinite ladder. We can find the voltages at the nodes using nodal analysis and the properties of infinite ladders. Let $V_{cn}$ and $V_{dn}$ be the voltages at nodes $c_n$ and $d_n$ respectively. For a ladder of this type, the node voltages can be described by a set of coupled linear difference equations.\n\nBy performing Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at a general node pair $(c_n, d_n)$, we can derive two independent difference equations for the sum of voltages $S_n = V_{cn} + V_{dn}$ and the difference of voltages $U_n = V_{cn} - V_{dn}$:\n\n*   $S_{n+1} - 2S_n + S_{n-1} = 0$\n*   $U_{n+1} - 4U_n + U_{n-1} = 0$\n\nThe solutions to these equations, assuming the voltages decay to zero as $n \\to \\infty$, are:\n*   $S_n = \\text{constant} = D$\n*   $U_n = A \\cdot (2-\\sqrt{3})^n$\n\nLet $\\alpha = 2-\\sqrt{3}$. From the above, we can express the individual node voltages as:\n*   $V_{cn} = (D + A\\alpha^n) / 2$\n*   $V_{dn} = (D - A\\alpha^n) / 2$\n\nThe constants $A$ and $D$ are determined by the boundary conditions at the beginning of the ladder ($n=0, 1$). The KCL equations at nodes $c_1$ and $d_1$ are:\n*   At $c_1$: $3V_{c1} - V_{c0} - V_{d1} - V_{c2} = 0$\n*   At $d_1$: $3V_{d1} - V_{a0} - V_{c1} - V_{d2} = 0$\n\nSubstituting the general solutions for $V_{cn}$ and $V_{dn}$ into these equations yields a system for A and D in terms of the boundary voltages $V_{c0}$ and $V_{a0}$:\n*   $D + A = 2V_{c0}$\n*   $D - A = 2V_{a0}$\n\nSolving this system gives:\n*   $A = V_{c0} - V_{a0}$\n*   $D = V_{c0} + V_{a0}$\n\nTo find $R_{th}$, we set $V_{c0} = 0$ and $V_{a0} = V_t$.\nTherefore, $A = -V_t$ and $D = V_t$.\n\nThe current $I_t$ from the test source at $a_0$ flows through the resistor $r$ to node $d_1$.\n$I_t = (V_{a0} - V_{d1}) / r = (V_t - V_{d1}) / r$\n\nWe need to find $V_{d1}$:\n$V_{d1} = (D - A\\alpha^1)/2 = (V_t - (-V_t)\\alpha)/2 = V_t(1+\\alpha)/2$.\n\nNow substitute this into the expression for $I_t$:\n$I_t = (V_t - V_t(1+\\alpha)/2) / r = \\frac{V_t}{r} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1+\\alpha}{2} \\right) = \\frac{V_t}{r} \\left( \\frac{2-1-\\alpha}{2} \\right) = \\frac{V_t(1-\\alpha)}{2r}$.\n\nFinally, the Thevenin resistance is:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{V_t}{I_t} = \\frac{2r}{1-\\alpha}$.\n\nSubstituting $\\alpha = 2-\\sqrt{3}$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r}{1 - (2-\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3}-1} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{(\\sqrt{3}-1)(\\sqrt{3}+1)} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{3-1} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$.\n\n### Cutoff Frequency ($\\omega_c$)\n\nThe circuit at node $a_0$ behaves as a simple RC low-pass filter with resistance $R_{th}$ and capacitance $C$. The transfer function is of the form $H(j\\omega) = \\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} \\propto \\frac{1}{1 + j\\omega R_{th}C}$.\n\nThe cutoff angular frequency $\\omega_c$ is the frequency at which the magnitude of the impedance of the capacitor equals the Thevenin resistance, i.e., $\\omega_c R_{th} C = 1$.\n\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\n\nSubstituting the value of $R_{th}$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThe cutoff frequency at node $a_0$ is therefore $\\frac{1}{rC(1+\\sqrt{3})}$.\n\n<<<$\\frac{1}{rC(1+\\sqrt{3})}$>>>"
