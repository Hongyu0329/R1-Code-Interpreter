    "Based on the visual evidence and common flag designs, the country is likely Yemen.\n\nThe snippet displays a flag with horizontal stripes of black, white, and red from top to bottom. This color order directly matches the historical flag of the German Empire (1871-1918). However, \"Guess the Country\" games typically feature current sovereign states.\n\nThe national flag of Yemen features a simple horizontal tricolor of red, white, and black. This is the exact inverse of the color order presented in the image. It is a common tactic in visual puzzles to invert an image to increase the difficulty. The flags of other Arab nations with similar colors, such as Egypt and Syria, feature symbols on the central white stripe, which are absent here.\n\nTherefore, the most logical conclusion is that the image is an inverted flag of a current country.\n\n<<<Yemen>>>"
