    "The detailed relief in the image is part of the high altarpiece in the Church of Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs in Paris, France. The sculptor of this piece was Jacques Sarazin.\n\nThe altarpiece, completed in 1629, is a monumental work that features paintings by Simon Vouet, including \"The Assumption of the Virgin.\" The stucco angels that are part of the altarpiece were created by Jacques Sarazin.\n\nThe Church of Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs itself has a rich history, with its earliest parts dating back to the 15th century in the Flamboyant Gothic style, while other sections from the 16th century showcase French Renaissance architecture. It is renowned for its significant collection of French Renaissance art. The main altarpiece is a rare survivor from the 17th century in Paris.\n\n<<<Jacques Sarazin>>>"
