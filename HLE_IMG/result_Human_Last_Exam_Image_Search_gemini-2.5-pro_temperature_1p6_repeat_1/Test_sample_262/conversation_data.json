    "An analysis of the four depicted iridium(III) complexes reveals that their operational lifetime in a light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) is primarily influenced by the chemical stability of the ligands, particularly the cyclometalating phenylpyridine (C^N) ligands.\n\nAll four structures are cationic iridium(III) complexes featuring two substituted phenylpyridine ligands and one diimine (4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine) ligand. The key difference between the complexes lies in the position of the two fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring of the cyclometalating ligands. Fluorination is a common strategy to tune the electronic properties of these emitters, but it can also introduce pathways for chemical degradation, which shortens device lifetime.\n\nThe stability of the iridium-carbon (Ir-C) bond is crucial for the overall stability of the complex. The positions of the electron-withdrawing fluorine substituents relative to this bond are therefore highly significant.\n*   **Complexes 2 and 4:** In these complexes, the fluorine atoms are located at *meta* and/or *para* positions relative to the C-Ir bond. This type of substitution effectively lowers the energy of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO), which generally increases the complex's resistance to oxidative degradation without introducing new, highly reactive sites.\n*   **Complexes 1 and 3:** These complexes feature a fluorine atom positioned *ortho* to the C-Ir bond. While the carbon-fluorine (C-F) bond itself is strong, its presence at the *ortho* position creates a known vulnerability. This C-F bond can be susceptible to degradation mechanisms within the LEC device, such as nucleophilic attack, leading to defluorination. This chemical breakdown of the ligand degrades the emitter and shortens the operational lifetime of the device. Research has demonstrated that C<sub>aryl</sub>â€“F bonds, particularly on the cyclometalating ligands, can be inherently unstable under device operating conditions. Studies comparing iridium complexes with different fluorination patterns have often concluded that increasing the fluorine content, or placing fluorine atoms in specific sensitive positions like *ortho*, leads to shorter device lifetimes.\n\nTherefore, Complexes 1 and 3, which both possess an *ortho*-fluorine on their cyclometalating ligands, are expected to be less chemically stable and exhibit shorter lifetimes when used as emitters in LECs compared to Complexes 2 and 4.\n\n<<<F>>>"
