    "The sheet music provided is for the song \"Les Yeux Noirs,\" the French title for the popular Russian romance song \"Ochi Chyornye\" (Dark Eyes). This tune has become a staple in the gypsy jazz repertoire, largely due to its popularization by the legendary guitarist Django Reinhardt.\n\n**Title:** \"Les Yeux Noirs\" (\"Ochi Chyornye\" or \"Dark Eyes\")\n\n**Musical Style:** The original version of the song is a Russian romance in the style of a waltz. However, the arrangement presented in the sheet music, with its 4/4 time signature and characteristic syncopation, is in the **Gypsy Jazz** (also known as Jazz Manouche or Gypsy Swing) style. This particular style was pioneered by Django Reinhardt and is the one with which the song is most frequently associated in the jazz world.\n\n**Country of Origin:** The song has its roots in **Russia**. The lyrics were penned by the Ukrainian poet Yevhen Hrebinka in 1843, and the melody is adapted from a waltz by the German composer Florian Hermann, which was published in 1879. It is widely considered to be a traditional Russian gypsy song.\n\n<<<**Title**: \"Les Yeux Noirs\" (\"Ochi Chyornye\" / \"Dark Eyes\"), **Musical Style**: Gypsy Jazz (originally a Russian Romance), **Country of Origin**: Russia>>>"
