    "The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image fragment is identified as **Sö 9**.\n\nThis identification is based on the distinctive grid-like pattern in which the runes are carved, a feature that is not common on most runestones. Search results confirm that the runestone Sö 9, located in Lifsinge, Södermanland, Sweden, has this unique characteristic. The inscription on this stone commemorates Ulfr, who died with Ingvar. The text was carved by Bergviðr/Barkviðr and Helga in memory of their son. The stone was discovered in 1857 in five pieces and was reassembled and erected near its original location in 1934. It is one of about 26 Ingvar runestones, which were raised to commemorate those who died in the Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled.\n\n<<<Sö 9>>>"
