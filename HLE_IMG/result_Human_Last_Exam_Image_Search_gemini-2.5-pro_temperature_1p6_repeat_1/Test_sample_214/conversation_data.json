    "The poetic form used in this sequence of erasure poems is the **Ermine**.\n\nThis form was invented by the poet and artist Mary Ruefle, who created the work in the image, \"The Other Clouds.\" The Ermine is a contemporary, experimental form of erasure poetry. It is defined by its structure: a four-line stanza, or quatrain, which is then sequentially erased or reduced until only a final two-word phrase or couplet remains.\n\nThe name \"Ermine\" is a metaphor for this process. The longer quatrain represents the animal's white winter coat, while the final, essential two-word phrase (\"nacreous wavers\" in this case) represents the distinctive black tip of its tail. The image provided shows words that form the third line of the initial quatrain. The sequence of erasures continues until only the final two words are left, completing the Ermine poem.\n\n<<<Ermine>>>"
