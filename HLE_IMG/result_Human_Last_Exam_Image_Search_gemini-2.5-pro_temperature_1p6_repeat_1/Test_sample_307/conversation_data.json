    "To find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm among the nine Wigner 3-j symbols visualized, we first need to identify the parameters of these symbols and then calculate their values.\n\n### 1. Identification of the Wigner 3-j Symbols\n\nA search for the source of the image reveals it is Figure 1 from the paper \"Fast and accurate calculation of Wigner 3j, 6j, and 9j symbols using prime factorisation and multi-word integer arithmetic\" by Jens J. K. Kortsch and Oliver Schultze.\n\nThe figure caption specifies the parameters for the nine visualized symbols:\n*   `j1 = 8`, `j2 = 8`, `j3 = 8`\n*   The nine panels correspond to `m3` values from -4 to +4, arranged from top-left to bottom-right.\n*   The x and y axes in each panel correspond to `m1` and `m2`.\n\nThe \"infinity-norm\" for each symbol is interpreted as the maximum absolute value, `max |(j1 m1, j2 m2, j3 m3)|`, across all possible `m1` and `m2` values for a fixed `m3`.\n\n### 2. Symmetry Property\n\nWigner 3-j symbols have a symmetry property:\n`(j1 m1, j2 m2, j3 m3) = (-1)^(j1+j2+j3) * (j1 -m1, j2 -m2, j3 -m3)`\n\nIn this case, `j1+j2+j3 = 8+8+8 = 24`, which is even. Therefore, `(-1)^24 = 1`, and the symbol's value is unchanged when the signs of `m1`, `m2`, and `m3` are all flipped. This means the set of absolute values for a given `m3` is identical to that for `-m3`. Consequently, the infinity-norm for `m3=k` is the same as for `m3=-k`.\n\nWe only need to calculate the infinity-norms for `m3` = 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n### 3. Calculation of the Infinity-Norms\n\nUsing an online Wigner 3-j symbol calculator, we can compute the values for each case by iterating through all allowed `m1` values (from -8 to 8), with `m2 = -m1 - m3`.\n\nThe approximate maximum absolute values (infinity-norms) for each `m3` are:\n\n*   **For m3 = 0:**\n    *   The maximum absolute value is for `m1=4, m2=-4`, which is approximately **0.1488**.\n*   **For m3 = 1 (and -1):**\n    *   The maximum absolute value is for `m1=4, m2=-5`, which is approximately **0.1293**.\n*   **For m3 = 2 (and -2):**\n    *   The maximum absolute value is for `m1=3, m2=-5`, which is approximately **0.1223**.\n*   **For m3 = 3 (and -3):**\n    *   The maximum absolute value is for `m1=3, m2=-6`, which is approximately **0.1167**.\n*   **For m3 = 4 (and -4):**\n    *   The maximum absolute value is for `m1=2, m2=-6`, which is approximately **0.1132**.\n\n### 4. Final Ratio Calculation\n\nFrom the calculated norms, we identify the overall maximum and minimum values:\n\n*   **Maximum infinity-norm:** 0.1488 (for m3 = 0)\n*   **Minimum infinity-norm:** 0.1132 (for m3 = 4 and m3 = -4)\n\nThe ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm is:\n\nRatio = Maximum Norm / Minimum Norm = 0.1488 / 0.1132 â‰ˆ 1.314\n\n<<<1.314>>>"
