    "The title of the painting, a fragment of which is presented, is **\"Windmill Fire\"**.\n\nThis work was painted by the Dutch artist **Egbert van der Poel**. Although the inquiry specified a 19th-century painting, \"Windmill Fire\" dates back to the 17th century, between 1654 and 1664. The visual characteristics of the provided image, including the composition, the depiction of the windmill, the fire in the background, and the dramatic, dark sky, are a clear match with this particular artwork. The painting is housed in the National Museum in Krak√≥w.\n\nEgbert van der Poel was a Dutch Golden Age painter known for his landscapes and genre scenes, and he notably depicted several scenes of fires and the Delft gunpowder explosion of 1654. While other 19th-century artists also painted windmills and even burning windmills, such as Johan Christian Dahl, the specific details in the provided fragment align conclusively with van der Poel's work. It is likely that there was a misunderstanding regarding the century in which the artwork was created.\n\n<<<Windmill Fire>>>"
