    "The histopathological image provided displays a kidney glomerulus with severe abnormalities. The key features observed are:\n\n*   **Crescent Formation:** A prominent, crescent-shaped proliferation of cells is visible within Bowman's space, compressing the central glomerular tuft. This crescent is highly cellular, indicating an acute process, and is formed by the proliferation of parietal epithelial cells along with an influx of inflammatory cells like macrophages. The presence of crescents in over 50% of glomeruli on a biopsy is termed crescentic glomerulonephritis and is a marker of severe glomerular injury, often associated with a rapid decline in kidney function.\n*   **Fibrinoid Necrosis:** Within the glomerular tuft, there are areas of smudgy, intensely eosinophilic (pink) material where the normal architecture is destroyed. This is characteristic of fibrinoid necrosis, which results from severe damage to the capillary walls, allowing plasma proteins like fibrin to leak out.\n*   **Hypercellularity:** The entire glomerulus is hypercellular, both within the capillary loops (endocapillary proliferation) and in the surrounding Bowman's space (the crescent).\n\nThis combination of a cellular crescent and fibrinoid necrosis is the classic presentation of **necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis**. This is a severe form of glomerular injury and is the hallmark of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN).\n\nWhile this is the direct histopathological diagnosis, crescentic glomerulonephritis is further classified based on immunofluorescence findings into three main types. The pattern seen in the image is most commonly associated with **Type III or Pauci-Immune Crescentic Glomerulonephritis**. This type is characterized by the absence (or paucity) of anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies and immune complex deposition. The vast majority of pauci-immune glomerulonephritis cases are associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and are a manifestation of ANCA-associated vasculitis, such as microscopic polyangiitis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis.\n\nTherefore, the most precise histopathological diagnosis based on the provided H&E stained image is necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis, most suggestive of a pauci-immune process like ANCA-associated vasculitis.\n\n<<<Necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis>>>"
