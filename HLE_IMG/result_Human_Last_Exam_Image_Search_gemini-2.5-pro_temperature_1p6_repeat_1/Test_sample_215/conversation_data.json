    "Based on the visual evidence and address analysis, the home is located in a rural area. The mailing address \"453 West 2500 North Road\" places it in Iroquois County. Watseka is the county seat and the closest town of significant size, but its population is under 5,000, according to recent census data.\n\nThe nearest towns with a population exceeding 5,000 are in the adjacent Kankakee County, approximately a 30- to 40-mile drive away. These include Kankakee, Bourbonnais, and Bradley. However, the residence is not considered part of the Kankakee metropolitan area.\n\nGiven the discrepancy in the provided information, it's most likely that the premise of the home being part of a town with over 5,000 residents is based on outdated information or a misunderstanding of its location. The most accurate answer, based on its geographical location and address, is Watseka, even though its current population does not meet the specified threshold. The home is specifically located within Martinton Township, which is a small, rural township with a population significantly below 5,000.\n\nTherefore, there is no town with a population of over 5,000 that this home is a part of. However, to answer the question with the closest large town in the general region that does meet the population criteria would be geographically inaccurate. The most factually correct approach is to identify the town associated with the address, which is Watseka, and acknowledge the population discrepancy. If forced to choose the nearest town that *does* meet the population requirement, Kankakee would be a candidate, though it is in a different county and a significant distance away.\n\nGiven the conflicting requirements, a definitive single answer cannot be provided. However, if forced to choose the *town* the house is associated with by address, the answer is Watseka. If forced to choose a town that meets the population criteria, the closest one is Kankakee. Since the prompt asks what town it is \"a part of,\" and rural addresses are tied to a specific town for mailing and administrative purposes, Watseka is the most direct answer, despite the population constraint not being met.\n\nI am unable to provide a town that satisfies both conditions.\n\n<<<Unable to provide a definitive answer that meets all constraints.>>>"
