    "To compute the chromatic polynomial, P(G, k), of the given graph G, we can use a method based on the graph's structure.\n\n### 1. Analyzing the Graph's Structure\n\nThe graph G has 5 vertices, labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. We can observe the following connections:\n*   Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n*   The subgraph induced by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}, let's call it H, forms a complete graph on four vertices (K₄) minus the edge (2, 5). This subgraph is also known as a diamond graph.\n\nThis structure allows us to compute the chromatic polynomial by first considering the subgraph H, and then accounting for vertex 1.\n\n### 2. Chromatic Polynomial of the Subgraph H (K₄ - e)\n\nWe can find the chromatic polynomial of H, `P(H, k)`, using the deletion-contraction principle on the complete graph K₄. Let the missing edge be `e = (2, 5)`. The deletion-contraction formula is `P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G.e, k)`.\n\nRearranging for the graph with a deleted edge (`G-e`), we get: `P(G-e, k) = P(G, k) + P(G.e, k)`.\n\nIn our case, `H = K₄ - e`. So, `P(H, k) = P(K₄, k) + P(K₄.e, k)`.\n\n*   The chromatic polynomial of a complete graph Kₙ is `P(Kₙ, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)...(k-n+1)`. For K₄, this is `P(K₄, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`.\n*   Contracting the edge `e = (2, 5)` in K₄ results in a complete graph on 3 vertices, K₃. The chromatic polynomial for K₃ is `P(K₃, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)`.\n\nTherefore, the chromatic polynomial of H is:\n`P(H, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) + k(k-1)(k-2)`\n`P(H, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-3) + 1]`\n`P(H, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)²`\n\n### 3. Chromatic Polynomial of the Entire Graph G\n\nNow, we consider vertex 1, which is connected to vertices 2 and 5 of H. To find the chromatic polynomial of the whole graph G, we consider a valid k-coloring of H and determine the number of available colors for vertex 1.\n\nThe number of choices for coloring vertex 1 depends on whether its neighbors, vertices 2 and 5, have the same color or different colors.\n*   If `color(2) = color(5)`, vertex 1 has `k-1` color choices.\n*   If `color(2) ≠ color(5)`, vertex 1 has `k-2` color choices.\n\nLet `N_eq` be the number of ways to color H such that `color(2) = color(5)`.\nLet `N_neq` be the number of ways to color H such that `color(2) ≠ color(5)`.\n\nThen the chromatic polynomial for G is: `P(G, k) = (k-1) * N_eq + (k-2) * N_neq`.\n\nWe know that `N_eq + N_neq = P(H, k)`.\n\nThe number of colorings `N_neq` (where non-adjacent vertices 2 and 5 have different colors) is equivalent to the chromatic polynomial of the graph H with an added edge between 2 and 5. Adding the edge (2, 5) to H completes it into K₄.\n*   `N_neq = P(H + (2,5), k) = P(K₄, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`.\n\nNow we can find `N_eq`:\n*   `N_eq = P(H, k) - N_neq`\n*   `N_eq = k(k-1)(k-2)² - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`\n*   `N_eq = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-2) - (k-3)]`\n*   `N_eq = k(k-1)(k-2) * (1) = k(k-1)(k-2)`.\n\nFinally, we substitute `N_eq` and `N_neq` into the expression for `P(G, k)`:\n`P(G, k) = (k-1) * [k(k-1)(k-2)] + (k-2) * [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)]`\n\nFactor out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\n`P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-1) + (k-2)(k-3)]`\n\nSimplify the expression in the brackets:\n`[(k-1) + (k² - 5k + 6)] = k² - 4k + 5`\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial is:\n`P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)`\n\nExpanding this gives the final polynomial form:\n`P(G, k) = (k³ - 3k² + 2k)(k² - 4k + 5)`\n`P(G, k) = k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³ - 3k⁴ + 12k³ - 15k² + 2k³ - 8k² + 10k`\n`P(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k`\n\n<<<P(k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5) or P(k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k>>>"
