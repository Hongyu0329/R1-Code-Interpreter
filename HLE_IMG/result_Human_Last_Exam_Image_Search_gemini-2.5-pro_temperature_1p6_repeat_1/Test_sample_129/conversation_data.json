    "This protein is the **pro-subtilisin E** in a complex with its propeptide.\n\nThis identification is based on the crystal structure available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the identifier **1SCJ**. The larger, dark blue domain represents the mature subtilisin E enzyme, while the smaller, light blue portion is its propeptide. The propeptide functions as an intramolecular chaperone, which is a part of the protein that helps the main enzyme to fold correctly.\n\nSubtilisin E is a type of enzyme known as a hydrolase, specifically a serine-type peptidase, which is sourced from the bacterium *Bacillus subtilis*. This particular structure is of a mutated form (Ser221Cys) that was autoprocessed, meaning the enzyme cleaved its own propeptide.<<<pro-subtilisin E>>>"
