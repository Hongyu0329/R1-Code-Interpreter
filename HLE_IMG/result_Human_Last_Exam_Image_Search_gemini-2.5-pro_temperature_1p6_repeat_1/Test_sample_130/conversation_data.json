    "The provided image displays the emission spectrum of the element **Uranium**. Each element has a unique spectral fingerprint, and the pattern of colored lines in the image corresponds to the light emitted by excited uranium atoms.\n\nThe distinct lines, ranging from blue to red, represent specific wavelengths of light emitted as electrons in uranium atoms transition between different energy levels. These spectral lines are characteristic of uranium and can be used to identify its presence. For instance, a prominent emission line for uranium atoms is found at 591.5 nm.\n\n<<<Uranium>>>"
