    "To determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the total Car VMT for the Baseline scenario.**\n2.  **Calculate the total Car VMT for the Proposed scenario.**\n3.  **Calculate the percentage reduction using the results from the first two steps.**\n\nFor these calculations, we'll determine a representative VMT by multiplying the share of total trips by the mode share for cars and the average trip distance for each mileage segment. Let's assume a total of 100 trips for simplicity, although the 'N' for total trips will cancel out in the final percentage calculation.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate Baseline Car VMT**\n\nFirst, we sum the mode shares for both car categories (\"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\") for each distance segment in Table 1.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** 25% + 28% = 53%\n*   **3-5 miles:** 38% + 43% = 81%\n*   **5-10 miles:** 40% + 45% = 85%\n*   **10+ miles:** 42% + 47% = 89%\n\nNext, we calculate the VMT for each segment by multiplying the `share of total trips` by the `total car mode share` and the `average trip distance`.\n\n*   **VMT (0-3 miles):** 0.48 (share of trips) × 0.53 (car share) × 1 (avg distance) = 0.2544\n*   **VMT (3-5 miles):** 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = 0.7128\n*   **VMT (5-10 miles):** 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = 0.8925\n*   **VMT (10+ miles):** 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = 2.8480\n\n**Total Baseline VMT** = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077** (arbitrary units per 100 trips)\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate Proposed Car VMT**\n\nWe repeat the same process using the data from Table 2.\n\nFirst, sum the mode shares for the car categories in the Proposed scenario.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** 1% + 2% = 3%\n*   **3-5 miles:** 8% + 19% = 27%\n*   **5-10 miles:** 14% + 27% = 41%\n*   **10+ miles:** 16% + 33% = 49%\n\nNext, calculate the VMT for each segment in the Proposed scenario.\n\n*   **VMT (0-3 miles):** 0.48 (share of trips) × 0.03 (car share) × 1 (avg distance) = 0.0144\n*   **VMT (3-5 miles):** 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = 0.2376\n*   **VMT (5-10 miles):** 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = 0.4305\n*   **VMT (10+ miles):** 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = 1.5680\n\n**Total Proposed VMT** = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505** (arbitrary units per 100 trips)\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n*   **VMT Reduction** = Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT) × 100\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100 ≈ 52.195%\n\nBy changing the composition of mode share, the Car VMT can be reduced by approximately 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
