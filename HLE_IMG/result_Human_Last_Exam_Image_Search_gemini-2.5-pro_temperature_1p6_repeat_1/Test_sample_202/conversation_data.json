    "### Decoding the Rocks: An Identification of Four Specimens\n\nBased on their distinct visual characteristics, the four rock specimens, labeled H, I, J, and K, have been identified, revealing a story of their varied volcanic and intrusive formations.\n\n**Specimen H is Scoria:** This rock's reddish-brown color and porous, vesicular texture are defining features of scoria. Scoria, also known as lava rock, forms when gas-rich lava erupts and cools rapidly, trapping gas bubbles within the rock. This process gives it a cindery appearance. Its color, often dark brown or reddish, is due to its mafic to intermediate composition, rich in iron and magnesium.\n\n**Specimen I is Volcanic Breccia:** The key characteristic of this specimen is the presence of angular fragments cemented together in a lighter-colored matrix. This indicates it is a volcanic breccia. Volcanic breccias are formed from explosive volcanic eruptions that eject fragments of rock, which then become consolidated. The angularity of the clasts suggests that the fragments did not travel far from the volcanic source before being deposited.\n\n**Specimen J is Pumice:** This specimen's light color and highly vesicular, frothy appearance are classic indicators of pumice. Pumice is a type of volcanic glass that forms from the rapid cooling of silica-rich lava. The numerous, tiny vesicles are the result of gas bubbles being trapped as the lava solidified. Its low density, a result of this high porosity, often allows it to float on water.\n\n**Specimen K is Pegmatite:** The most striking feature of specimen K is its very coarse-grained texture with large, interlocked crystals. This identifies it as a pegmatite. Pegmatites are intrusive igneous rocks, meaning they cooled slowly beneath the Earth's surface. This slow cooling allows for the growth of exceptionally large crystals, which in this specimen appear to be composed of light-colored minerals like feldspar and quartz, and darker minerals. Pegmatites often form in the final stages of magma crystallization and can contain rare minerals.\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Volcanic Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite>>>"
