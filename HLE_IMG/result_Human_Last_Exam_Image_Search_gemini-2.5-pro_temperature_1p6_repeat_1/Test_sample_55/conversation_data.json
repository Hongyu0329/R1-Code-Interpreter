    "The notes circled in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasia in D minor, K. 397, form a vii°⁷/V chord, which is the leading-tone seventh chord of the dominant.\n\nTo determine the Roman numeral, we must first identify the key and the notes in the circled chord.\n\n*   **Key:** The piece is in D minor.\n*   **Circled Notes:** The circled notes fall on the second beat of measure 8. The left hand plays E and G. The right hand begins an arpeggiated figure with the notes A and F♯. Together, these four notes—E, G, A, and F♯—create the harmony for this beat.\n\nThis chord's function is best understood by its relationship to the dominant chord of D minor, which is A major. The chord E-G-A-F♯ can be rearranged as F♯-A-C(implied)-E-G. A more common analysis interprets this as a leading-tone chord built on F♯ that resolves to the V (A major) of D minor. Specifically, it is an incomplete G dominant 7th chord in third inversion, functioning as a secondary dominant (V7/V) or more accurately as a leading-tone chord to the dominant, which is **vii°⁷/V**. This means it is the leading-tone seventh chord of A major, the dominant of D minor.\n\nTherefore, the accurate Roman numeral for this chord is vii°⁷/V.\n\n<<<vii°⁷/V>>>"
