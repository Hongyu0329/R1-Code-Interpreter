    "To determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, a harmonic analysis is necessary. The sonata is in the key of C minor.\n\nThe chord in measure 30 functions as a dominant harmony, preparing for the return to the tonic C minor. A closer examination of the notes in this measure reveals the components of an augmented German sixth chord. This type of chromatic chord is used to intensify the movement towards the dominant.\n\nThe notes present in measure 30 are:\n*   **Left Hand:** G octave, which acts as a pedal point on the dominant.\n*   **Right Hand:** The arpeggiated figure consists of G, B-natural, D, and F-sharp.\n\nWhen analyzed together, the notes (G, B, D, Fâ™¯) build a G dominant seventh chord with a raised fifth (F-sharp instead of F-natural). In the context of C minor, G is the dominant (V). Therefore, the chord is a V with a chromatic alteration. Some analyses identify the chord in measure 30 specifically as an augmented 6th chord. It resolves to the dominant chord at the start of the next phrase, which in turn resolves to the tonic. The use of this chord adds to the dramatic tension characteristic of the sonata.\n\nGiven its function and composition, the chord is a chromatically altered dominant. The most appropriate Roman numeral would signify its dominant function with alterations. Therefore, it is an altered V chord, specifically an augmented German sixth chord built on the dominant.\n\n<<<Augmented German sixth chord (or altered V)>>>"
