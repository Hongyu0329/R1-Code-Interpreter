    "Based on the visual evidence in the image, this photo was taken in Mukilteo, Washington.\n\nThe scene features a sunset over Puget Sound, with a bonfire on the gravelly beach, which are characteristic activities at Mukilteo Lighthouse Park. The park is well-known for its stunning sunsets and has six designated fire pits available for public use on a first-come, first-served basis. The view in the photograph, including the dark beach and the forested coastline across the water (likely Whidbey Island), is consistent with images taken from this location. In 2022, HeraldNet readers voted Mukilteo Lighthouse Park as the best place to watch the sunset in Snohomish County.\n\nOther popular locations in the Seattle area, such as Golden Gardens Park and Alki Beach, also allow beach fires in designated pits. However, the specific combination of the gravelly shoreline, the type of view, and the overall environment strongly points to Mukilteo Lighthouse Park as the correct location.\n\n<<<Mukilteo, Washington>>>"
