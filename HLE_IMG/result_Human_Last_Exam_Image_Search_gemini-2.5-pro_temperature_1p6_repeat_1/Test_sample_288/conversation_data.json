    "The image provided is of the Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox in Spokane, Washington.\n\nBased on the theater's 2023-2024 season schedule, there was an event on October 11 and 12, 2023, called the \"Barrister Chamber Soirées\". This was an intimate event featuring musician-curated music in a different setting, the Barrister Winery.\n\nAnother source indicates that on Thursday, October 12, 2023, flutist Patricia Surman performed composer Jerod Impichchaachaaha' Tate's flute concerto, *Tracing Mississippi*, as part of a residency at Colorado's Metropolitan State College. It's possible there's a misunderstanding of the venue or that a different artist was featured on that date. It appears there may have been multiple events associated with the Spokane Symphony and its musicians on that date, but not a single headlining musical artist at the main theater itself. A blog post also mentions the band Metric played on October 12, 2023, but at The Roxy in Los Angeles, not in Spokane.\n\nThe provided search results have conflicting or overlapping information regarding the exact performer at the Martin Woldson Theater on that specific date, though the Spokane Symphony had events scheduled around that time. The main \"Masterworks\" concert at the theater took place on October 7th and 8th.\n\nSince there is no clear record of a single musical artist playing at the Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox on October 12, 2023, it's most likely that the event was the \"Barrister Chamber Soirées\" featuring musicians from the Spokane Symphony.\n\n<<<There was no single named musical artist performing at the Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox on October 12, 2023. The Spokane Symphony held an event called \"Barrister Chamber Soirées\" on that date.>>>"
