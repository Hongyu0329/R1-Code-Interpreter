    "The problem asks for the worst-case time complexity of the given recursive sorting algorithm. Let's analyze the provided pseudocode to establish a recurrence relation for its running time, `T(n)`.\n\nThe pseudocode is:\n```python\ndef sort(a, n):\n  if n > 1:\n    # First recursive call\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n\n    # Comparison and potential swap\n    if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n      swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])\n\n      # Second recursive call (conditional)\n      sort(a, n - 1)\n```\n\n1.  **Base Case:** When `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function does nothing. The time taken is constant, `T(1) = O(1)`.\n\n2.  **Recursive Step (n > 1):**\n    *   `sort(a, n - 1)`: The function is always called recursively on the first `n-1` elements. This takes `T(n-1)` time.\n    *   `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:`: This is a constant time `O(1)` comparison.\n    *   `swap(...)`: This is a constant time `O(1)` operation.\n    *   `sort(a, n - 1)`: This second recursive call is crucial. It only executes if the `if` condition is met.\n\n3.  **Worst-Case Analysis:** The worst-case scenario occurs when the second recursive call is executed for every value of `n` from the initial call down to the base case. This happens when the `if` condition, `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`, is consistently true. A reverse-sorted array (e.g., `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`) would trigger this worst-case behavior.\n\n    In the worst case, the total time `T(n)` is the sum of:\n    *   The time for the first recursive call: `T(n-1)`\n    *   The time for the comparison and swap: `O(1)`\n    *   The time for the second recursive call: `T(n-1)`\n\n    This gives us the recurrence relation:\n    `T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-1) + O(1)`\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c` (where c is a constant)\n\n4.  **Solving the Recurrence Relation:**\n    We can solve this by expansion:\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n    *   `= 2 * [2 * T(n-2) + c] + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n    *   `= 4 * [2 * T(n-3) + c] + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    *   After `k` expansions: `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n    *   The geometric series `(2^(k-1) + ... + 1)` sums to `(2^k - 1)`.\n    *   So, `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^k - 1)`\n    *   We continue until we reach the base case `T(1)`, which happens when `n-k = 1`, so `k = n-1`.\n    *   Substituting `k = n-1`: `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n\n    The dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`. Therefore, the time complexity is exponential.\n\n    `T(n) = O(2^n)`\n\nThis algorithm is a variation of \"Slowsort,\" an example of a humorously inefficient algorithm created for educational purposes.\n\nComparing this result to the answer choices:\n*   A. O(n)\n*   B. O(n log n)\n*   C. O(n^2)\n*   D. O(n^3)\n*   E. O(2^n)\n*   F. does not terminate\n\nThe calculated complexity `O(2^n)` matches choice E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
