    "To find the total area of the shaded regions, we can calculate the area of the blue and red regions separately and then sum them up.\n\n### Analysis of the Shaded Regions\n\nLet's analyze the construction of the blue shaded region. It is depicted as a right-angled triangle.\n- The two legs of the right-angled triangle are given with lengths of **17** and **34**.\n- The right angle is explicitly marked with a square symbol.\n\nThe area of a right-angled triangle is given by the formula:\nArea = ½ × base × height\n\nFor the blue triangle:\n- Base = 34\n- Height = 17\n- Area_blue = ½ × 34 × 17 = 17 × 17 = **289**\n\nSimilarly, the red shaded region is constructed symmetrically to the blue region and is also a right-angled triangle with the same dimensions.\nFor the red triangle:\n- Base = 34\n- Height = 17\n- Area_red = ½ × 34 × 17 = 17 × 17 = **289**\n\n### Total Area\n\nThe problem asks for the total area of the shaded regions. The note about the overlapping area suggests that we should consider the union of these two regions. The diagram shows the blue triangle and the red triangle are adjacent, sharing a common vertex at the center of the sector and a common boundary line. An overlap of a line segment or a point has an area of zero. Therefore, there is no overlapping area to subtract.\n\nThe total shaded area is the sum of the individual areas:\nTotal Area = Area_blue + Area_red\nTotal Area = 289 + 289 = **578**\n\nThe geometric information regarding the circular sector (the radius and the angles `θ`) is consistent with this interpretation. The construction with legs 17 and 34 defines the angle of each colored sector (`2θ = arctan(1/2)`) and the radius of the circle (`R = √(34² + 17²) = √1445`), but the area calculation for the triangles is independent of the radius and angle values once the legs are known.\n\nThe total area of the shaded regions is the sum of the areas of the two triangles.\n\n<<<578>>>"
