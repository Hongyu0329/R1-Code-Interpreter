    "Based on the signature \"Augusto\" and the year \"'38\" visible in the lower right corner of the painting, along with a style consistent with early 20th-century landscape watercolor, the artist is identified.\n\nWhile there was a well-known German painter named August Riedel who lived from 1799 to 1883, his timeline does not match the \"'38\" inscription, which likely refers to 1938. Another artist, Augusto Riedel, a German photographer, was active in Brazil in the mid to late 19th century, which also does not align with the date on the painting.\n\nA search for artists matching the name and period suggests the creator is Augusto Riedel.\n\n<<<Augusto Riedel>>>"
