**Formulation of Total Power Delivered:**
The total power delivered to the grid ($P_{\text{grid}}$) as a function of $P_{\text{wave}}$, $P_{c}$, and $P^{0}{\text{wind}}$ is:
$P_{\text{grid}} = (P^{0}{\text{wind}} + P_{\text{wave}} + P_{c}) - 0.01 \times (P^{0}{\text{wind}} + P_{\text{wave}} + P_{c})^2$

**Optimal Compensation Power ($P{c}^{\text{opt}}$):**
To meet the grid demand of at least $12 \text{ MW}$ while minimizing cable losses, the optimal compensation power is:
$P{c}^{\text{opt}} = -1.055 \text{ MW}$

**Total Power Delivered to the Grid:**
With the optimal compensation power, the total power delivered to the grid, including the effect of cable losses, is:
$P_{\text{grid}} = 12.0 \text{ MW}$
