    "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectra, the IUPAC name of the compound is determined as follows:\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\nThe molecular ion peak (M+) is observed at an m/z of 135. The odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms, likely one, according to the nitrogen rule.\n\n**2. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation:**\nAnalysis of the ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectra suggests a molecular formula of C₉H₁₃N. This is consistent with the molecular weight of 135.21 g/mol. The degree of unsaturation for this formula is 4, which corresponds to the presence of a benzene ring.\n\n**3. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\nThe IR spectrum shows absorptions for:\n*   Aromatic C-H stretches (above 3000 cm⁻¹)\n*   Aliphatic C-H stretches (below 3000 cm⁻¹)\n*   Aromatic C=C bond stretches (~1600 cm⁻¹ and 1450-1500 cm⁻¹)\n*   Small, sharp peaks around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ are indicative of a primary amine (–NH₂).\n\n**4. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectroscopy:**\n*   **¹³C NMR signals:** Seven distinct carbon signals are observed at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2. The four signals between 126 and 146 ppm are in the aromatic region, while the three signals below 50 ppm are in the aliphatic region. The presence of 7 signals for a 9-carbon molecule indicates some symmetry, consistent with a monosubstituted phenyl ring.\n*   **DEPT-135:** The spectrum shows one negative signal (indicating one CH₂ group) and five positive signals (indicating a total of five CH and CH₃ groups).\n    *   The signal at 43.5 ppm is the CH₂ group.\n    *   The signals at 19.2 ppm (CH₃) and 49.6 ppm (CH), along with the three aromatic CH signals (126.3, 127.3, 128.5 ppm), account for the five positive signals.\n    *   The signal at 145.1 ppm does not appear in the DEPT-135 spectrum, confirming it as a quaternary carbon (the ipso-carbon of the benzene ring).\n\n**5. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n*   A multiplet between **~7.1-7.3 ppm** with an integration corresponding to **5H** represents a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅–).\n*   A multiplet around **~2.9 ppm** integrates to **1H** (the methine proton, –CH).\n*   A multiplet around **~2.7 ppm** integrates to **2H** (the methylene protons, –CH₂–).\n*   A doublet around **~1.1 ppm** integrates to **3H** (the methyl group, –CH₃). This signal is a doublet due to coupling with the single methine proton.\n\n**6. HSQC Spectroscopy:**\nThe HSQC spectrum confirms the direct bonding between protons and carbons:\n*   ¹H at ~1.1 ppm correlates to ¹³C at 19.2 ppm (–CH₃).\n*   ¹H at ~2.7 ppm correlates to ¹³C at 43.5 ppm (–CH₂–).\n*   ¹H at ~2.9 ppm correlates to ¹³C at 49.6 ppm (–CH–).\n*   Aromatic protons (~7.2 ppm) correlate with the aromatic carbons (126-129 ppm).\n\n**7. Structure Elucidation:**\nThe combined data pieces together to form the following structure: a phenyl group attached to a CH₂ group, which is attached to a CH group that bears both a CH₃ group and an amine group (–NH₂).\n\nThis structure corresponds to **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
