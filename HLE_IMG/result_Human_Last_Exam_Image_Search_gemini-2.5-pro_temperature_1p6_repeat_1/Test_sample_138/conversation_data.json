    "Based on the distinct biological characteristics of each insect, the sexes can be determined for each pair.\n\n**A: *Coelioxys* (Cuckoo Bees)**\n\nThe most telling feature for identifying the sex of *Coelioxys* bees is the shape of the abdomen. The individual on the left has a sharply pointed, conical abdomen, which is characteristic of a female. She uses this to pierce the nests of host bees to lay her eggs. The insect on the right has a blunter abdomen that ends in several tooth-like spines, which is characteristic of a male. Cuckoo bees are kleptoparasites, meaning the females do not collect pollen and therefore lack scopae (pollen-collecting hairs).\n\n*   **A: Left is Female, Right is Male.**\n\n**B: *Polistes* (Paper Wasps)**\n\nIn paper wasps of the genus *Polistes*, males can be distinguished from females by a few key features. The insect on the right exhibits distinctly curled antennae tips, a feature of male paper wasps. In contrast, the wasp on the left has straight antennae. Additionally, males often have yellower faces than females. The abdomen of the female on the left is more pointed due to the presence of a stinger (modified ovipositor), while the male's abdomen is blunter.\n\n*   **B: Left is Female, Right is Male.**\n\n**C: Megachilid and Long-horned Bee**\n\nThis pair showcases two different types of bees. The bee on the left (C1) is a male long-horned bee, likely from the genus *Melissodes*. This is identifiable by its characteristically long antennae, which are much longer than a female's. Male bees do not collect pollen and lack scopae. The bee on the right (C2) is a female from the family Megachilidae (leaf-cutter or mason bees). This is evident from the prominent collection of yellow pollen on the underside of her abdomen, known as a ventral scopa. This fits the condition in the prompt that the insects are \"without scopae on their legs,\" as Megachilid females carry pollen on their abdomens instead.\n\n*   **C: Left is Male, Right is Female.**\n\n---\nThe correct sequence of indices corresponding to (A: F, M), (B: F, M), and (C: M, F) is: 4, 4, 3.\n\n<<<4, 4, 3>>>"
