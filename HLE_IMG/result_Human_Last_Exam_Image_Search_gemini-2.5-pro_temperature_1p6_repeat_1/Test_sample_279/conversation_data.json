    "Based on the widely used G.V. Black classification system, the lesion shown in the image corresponds to a Class I caries.\n\nThe image displays a molar tooth with an existing silver-colored (amalgam) filling on its occlusal (chewing) surface. The dark areas surrounding the filling indicate recurrent decay. A Class I classification is used for cavities that occur in the pits and fissures of the chewing surfaces of posterior teeth, such as molars and premolars. Since the decay is located in these specific anatomical areas, it falls under the Class I category.\n\nThis type of decay, which forms around or under an existing restoration, is also known as recurrent or secondary caries. However, its classification according to G.V. Black is still determined by its location on the tooth.\n\n<<<Class I>>>"
