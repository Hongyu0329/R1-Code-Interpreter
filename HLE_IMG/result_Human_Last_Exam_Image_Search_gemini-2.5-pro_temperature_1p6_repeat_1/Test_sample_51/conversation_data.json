    "The Ancient Greek word in the image is **μᾶλλον**.\n\nThis is a common adverb in Ancient Greek, and its form remained consistent in Byzantine Greek. It is the comparative form of the adverb μάλα (mála), which means \"very\".\n\nThe meaning of **μᾶλλον** is \"more,\" \"rather,\" or \"instead\". It is used to indicate a greater degree or a preference for one thing over another. For instance, it can be used to form the comparative of an adjective or to express a choice, as in \"rather this than that\".\n\nThe accent over the alpha is a circumflex (πορισπωμένη), which in this Byzantine manuscript is written as a combination of an acute and a grave accent, a common feature in later Greek scripts. This accent indicates that the first syllable is long and receives the pitch accent.\n\n<<<μᾶλλον>>>"
