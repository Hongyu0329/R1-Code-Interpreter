    "This picture was taken in Boston. The distinctive geometric ceiling and the glass panels with a blue circular pattern are signature features of the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center (BCEC). The building, located on Summer Street in Boston, Massachusetts, was designed by Rafael Vi√±oly Architects and is known for its vast, virtually column-free exhibition space under a curving roof. The roof's design includes clerestory windows that allow natural light to fill the main hall.\n\n<<<Boston>>>"
