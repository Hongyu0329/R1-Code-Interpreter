    "Based on a detailed analysis of the provided mass spectrum, the compound is an isomer of **Trichlorotetrahydrobiphenyl**. The systematic IUPAC name for one such representative isomer is **2',3',4'-Trichloro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1,1'-biphenyl**.\n\n### Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:\n\n1.  **Molecular Ion (M+•) Peak**: The cluster of peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) provides the molecular weight and clues about the elemental composition. The pattern of peaks at m/z 260, 262, 264, and 266 is characteristic of a compound containing three chlorine atoms. The peak at m/z 260, corresponding to the molecule with three ³⁵Cl isotopes, indicates the nominal molecular weight. The relative intensities of the isotopic peaks (M+2, M+4, M+6) match the expected distribution for a trichlorinated compound.\n\n2.  **Base Peak and Fragmentation**: The most intense peak in the spectrum, known as the base peak, is at m/z 225. This peak corresponds to the loss of a chlorine atom (mass 35 amu) from the molecular ion (260 - 35 = 225). This is a common fragmentation pathway for chlorinated compounds. The isotopic peak at m/z 227 has a relative intensity of 66.7%, which is consistent with a fragment containing two chlorine atoms.\n\n3.  **Molecular Formula Deduction**:\n    *   The nominal molecular weight is 260 amu.\n    *   Subtracting the mass of three chlorine atoms (3 x 35 = 105) leaves a mass of 155 for the rest of the molecule (CₓHᵧ).\n    *   The most plausible chemical formula for a hydrocarbon fragment with a mass of 155 is C₁₂H₁₁.\n    *   This leads to a total molecular formula of **C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃**.\n\n4.  **Structure Identification**: The formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃ suggests a structure with a significant degree of unsaturation, likely containing aromatic rings. A tetrahydrobiphenyl skeleton (a biphenyl system where one ring is partially hydrogenated) fits the C₁₂H₁₁ empirical formula of the non-chlorinated part. While many isomers are possible, a plausible structure is a trichlorinated tetrahydrobiphenyl.\n\nTherefore, the compound corresponding to the mass spectrum is an isomer of Trichlorotetrahydrobiphenyl.\n\n<<<2',3',4'-Trichloro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1,1'-biphenyl>>>"
