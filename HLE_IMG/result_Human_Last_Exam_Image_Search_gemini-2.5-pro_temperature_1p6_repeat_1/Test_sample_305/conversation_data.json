    "The product featured in the advertisement is **Tampax**.\n\nThis 1942 advertisement, with the headline \"Women are winning the War â€“ of Freedom,\" promoted Tampax as a revolutionary product that allowed women to work in factories and other war-effort jobs without interruption from their periods. This directly addressed the \"inherent limitations\" for the new workforce, as it provided reliable internal sanitary protection that was a significant change from the bulky pads previously used.\n\nThe name of the product is derived from French. The brand name \"Tampax\" is a portmanteau of \"tampon\" and \"vaginal packs.\" The word \"tampon\" itself originates from the medieval French word *tampion*, which means a piece of cloth used to plug a hole.\n\n<<<Tampax>>>"
