    "The icon depicts the Prophet Moses. This can be identified by comparing the image to known frescoes from the Sopoćani Monastery in Serbia.\n\nKey identifying features include:\n*   **Artistic Style:** The fresco's style is characteristic of the 13th-century Byzantine art found in the Sopoćani Monastery, an endowment of King Stefan Uroš I. The monastery's frescoes are considered masterpieces of European painting from that period.\n*   **Location and Subject:** This specific fresco is located on the south wall of the Church of the Holy Trinity within the monastery. It is part of a grouping of Old Testament prophets that also includes Aaron and Solomon. The prophets are depicted as tall figures, conveying a sense of being both physically strong and spiritually wise.\n*   **Iconography of Moses:** While many icons depict Moses holding the tablets of the Ten Commandments, in Eastern Orthodox iconography, it is also common for him to be shown holding a scroll, representing the Law or his prophecies. The figure's aged appearance, with a long white beard, aligns with typical depictions of the prophet.\n\nThe Sopoćani Monastery and its frescoes, including this depiction of the Prophet Moses, were added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1979.\n\n<<<D>>>"
