Here are the structures of the three products, A, B, and C.

**Structure of Product A: N-acetylpyrrolidine**
This product is formed through a Huisgen cycloaddition followed by cycloreversion, which liberates the proline portion of the parent molecule as an isocyanate. Subsequent hydrolysis, decarboxylation, and acetylation by acetic anhydride yield N-acetylpyrrolidine.

**Structure of Product B and Product C: Succinimide**
According to the provided text, products B and C are the identical "tethered imide." This imide is formed as a co-product in two different pathways. It originates from the (3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl) portion of the starting material. Under the reaction conditions, this fragment is converted into the stable cyclic imide, succinimide.
