    "The synchronized bursts are identified as the dense vertical bands of activity, indicating that many electrodes are firing at approximately the same time.\n\nBased on visual inspection of the graph, the timestamps for the beginning of each synchronized burst are approximately:\n*   **Burst 1:** 3 s\n*   **Burst 2:** 16 s\n*   **Burst 3:** 27 s\n*   **Burst 4:** 37 s\n*   **Burst 5:** 49 s\n\nNext, we calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs), which is the time between consecutive bursts:\n*   **Interval 1:** 16 s - 3 s = 13 s\n*   **Interval 2:** 27 s - 16 s = 11 s\n*   **Interval 3:** 37 s - 27 s = 10 s\n*   **Interval 4:** 49 s - 37 s = 12 s\n\nFinally, we calculate the average of these intervals:\n*   **Average IBI** = (13 s + 11 s + 10 s + 12 s) / 4 = 46 s / 4 = 11.5 s\n\nRounding to two significant figures, the average inter-burst interval is 12 s.\n\n<<<12>>>"
