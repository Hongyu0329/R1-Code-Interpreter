    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Benzene + Propanoyl chloride / AlCl₃ → Intermediate-1**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Benzene acts as a nucleophile, and propanoyl chloride, activated by the Lewis acid AlCl₃, acts as an electrophile.\n*   **Mechanism:** The AlCl₃ coordinates with the chlorine atom of propanoyl chloride, forming a highly electrophilic acylium ion (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O). The benzene ring attacks this ion, and subsequent loss of a proton restores aromaticity.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is 1-phenylpropan-1-one, also known as propiophenone.\n    *   Structure: A phenyl group attached to a carbonyl group, which is attached to an ethyl group (C₆H₅-CO-CH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 + Br₂ / FeBr₃ → Intermediate-2**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination).\n*   **Directing Effect:** The substituent on the benzene ring is the propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃). This is an acyl group, which is an electron-withdrawing group and therefore a deactivator and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Mechanism:** The Lewis acid FeBr₃ activates Br₂ to form the electrophile Br⁺. The aromatic ring of propiophenone attacks the Br⁺ at the position meta to the acyl group.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n    *   Structure: Propiophenone with a bromine atom at the meta-position (position 3) on the phenyl ring.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 + H₂ / Pd → Intermediate-3**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation.\n*   **Selectivity:** The reagent H₂/Pd is commonly used to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. While it can also cause hydrogenolysis of aryl halides or reduce aromatic rings, these reactions typically require harsher conditions. The most likely reaction under standard conditions is the reduction of the carbonyl group.\n*   **Mechanism:** The ketone's C=O double bond is reduced to a C-OH single bond by the addition of two hydrogen atoms.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-ol.\n    *   Structure: The carbonyl group of Intermediate-2 is reduced to a hydroxyl group, forming a secondary alcohol.\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 + NBS / (PhCO₂)₂, CCl₄ → Product**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a free-radical bromination.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide) is a source of bromine radicals for selective bromination.\n    *   (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide) is a radical initiator.\n    *   CCl₄ is an inert solvent for radical reactions.\n*   **Selectivity:** Radical bromination is highly selective for the most stable radical intermediate. The C-H bond at the **benzylic position** (the carbon atom attached to both the phenyl ring and the hydroxyl group) is the weakest C-H bond in the aliphatic portion of the molecule because its cleavage leads to a resonance-stabilized benzylic radical.\n*   **Mechanism:** A bromine radical abstracts the benzylic hydrogen atom. The resulting benzylic radical then reacts with a bromine source (Br₂ generated from NBS) to form the final product.\n*   **Final Product:** The hydrogen atom on the benzylic carbon is replaced by a bromine atom. The resulting molecule is **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-ol**.\n    *   Structure: A carbon atom is bonded to a 3-bromophenyl group, a bromine atom, a hydroxyl group, and an ethyl group.\n\n**Summary of Transformations:**\n1.  **Propiophenone** is formed.\n2.  **1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one** is formed.\n3.  **1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-ol** is formed.\n4.  **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-ol** is formed.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-ol>>>"
