    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the functional groups and overall structure.**\n    *   The molecule is a complex polycyclic compound.\n    *   It contains two nitrogen atoms, which are part of the ring system. This is a characteristic feature of alkaloids.\n    *   It contains a carbonyl group (C=O). This carbonyl group is adjacent to a nitrogen atom within a six-membered ring, forming a lactam (a cyclic amide).\n    *   The structure consists of four fused six-membered rings.\n    *   There are several stereocenters, indicated by wedged and dashed bonds, meaning this is a specific stereoisomer of the molecule.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the parent ring system.**\n    *   The core skeleton is a tetracyclic system. This framework is known as the sparteine skeleton. Sparteine itself is an alkaloid with the formula C15H26N2.\n    *   The given molecule has the same carbon-nitrogen skeleton as sparteine but with an oxygen atom.\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare the given structure to known alkaloids with a similar skeleton.**\n    *   The given molecule is an oxidized form of sparteine. Specifically, one of the methylene groups (CH2) adjacent to a nitrogen in sparteine has been oxidized to a carbonyl group (C=O), forming a lactam.\n    *   This specific alkaloid, the lactam derivative of sparteine, is a well-known natural product.\n\n*   **Step 4: Name the compound.**\n    *   The common name for this alkaloid, which is the 2-oxo derivative of sparteine, is **Lupanine**.\n    *   Let's verify the molecular formula. Counting the atoms:\n        *   Carbons: There are 15 carbon atoms.\n        *   Hydrogens: There are 24 hydrogen atoms.\n        *   Nitrogens: There are 2 nitrogen atoms.\n        *   Oxygens: There is 1 oxygen atom.\n    *   The molecular formula is C15H24N2O, which is consistent with lupanine. The structure shown, including the stereochemistry, corresponds to the most common naturally occurring isomer, (-)-lupanine.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Based on the characteristic tetracyclic sparteine skeleton containing a lactam group, the compound is identified as Lupanine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
