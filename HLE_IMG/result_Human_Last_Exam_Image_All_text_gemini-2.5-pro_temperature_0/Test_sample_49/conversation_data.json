    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nThe goal is to find the cutoff frequency of the circuit at node $a_0$. The circuit consists of an infinite resistive ladder network and a capacitor $C$ connected from node $a_0$ to ground. This configuration forms a low-pass filter. The cutoff frequency is the frequency at which the filter's response starts to roll off.\n\n**2. Thevenin Equivalent Circuit**\nThe cutoff frequency is determined by the interaction between the capacitor $C$ and the rest of the circuit. We can simplify the analysis by finding the Thevenin equivalent circuit of the resistive ladder as seen from the terminals of the capacitor, which are node $a_0$ and ground.\nThe transfer function of the resulting RC circuit will be of the form $H(s) = \\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} \\propto \\frac{1}{1 + s R_{th} C}$, where $R_{th}$ is the Thevenin resistance.\nThe cutoff angular frequency, $\\omega_c$, is the frequency at which the magnitude of the impedance of the capacitor equals the Thevenin resistance, i.e., $|1/(j\\omega_c C)| = R_{th}$. This gives the well-known formula:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C}$\nThe cutoff frequency in Hertz is $f_c = \\frac{\\omega_c}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R_{th} C}$.\nThe main task is to calculate the Thevenin resistance $R_{th}$.\n\n**3. Calculating the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to find the equivalent resistance of the network looking into node $a_0$ with all independent sources turned off. The input source `IN` at node $c_0$ is a voltage source, so we turn it off by replacing it with a short circuit to ground. Thus, node $c_0$ is grounded.\n$R_{th}$ is the resistance between node $a_0$ and ground.\n\n**4. Setting up Nodal Analysis for the Infinite Ladder**\nWe can solve for $R_{th}$ by applying a test voltage $V_{test}$ at node $a_0$ and finding the resulting current $I_{test}$. Then $R_{th} = V_{test} / I_{test}$. Let's use nodal analysis. Let $V_n$ denote the voltage at a node $n$. We ground $c_0$, so $V_{c0} = 0$.\n\nThe nodal equations for a generic section 'n' (for $n \\ge 2$) in the infinite ladder are:\nAt node $c_n$: $\\frac{V_{cn} - V_{c,n-1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{cn} - V_{c,n+1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{cn} - V_{dn}}{r} = 0 \\implies 3V_{cn} - V_{c,n-1} - V_{c,n+1} - V_{dn} = 0$\nAt node $d_n$: $\\frac{V_{dn} - V_{d,n-1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{dn} - V_{d,n+1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{dn} - V_{cn}}{r} = 0 \\implies 3V_{dn} - V_{d,n-1} - V_{d,n+1} - V_{cn} = 0$\n\n**5. Solving the Difference Equations**\nWe look for solutions of the form $V_{cn} = A k^n$ and $V_{dn} = B k^n$. Substituting these into the equations gives a system for A and B. This system has non-trivial solutions for two modes:\n*   **Symmetric Mode:** $A=B$, with characteristic value $k_s=1$. The voltage does not decay.\n*   **Anti-symmetric Mode:** $A=-B$, with characteristic values $k$ satisfying $k^2 - 4k + 1 = 0$. The roots are $k = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nFor a physically realistic solution where voltages decay down the infinite ladder, we must choose the modes that decay as $n \\to \\infty$.\n*   The symmetric mode solution is of the form $V_{cn}=V_{dn}=C_1 n + C_2$. For the voltage to be finite as $n \\to \\infty$, we must have $C_1=0$. So, $V_{cn}=V_{dn}=C_2$ (a constant).\n*   For the anti-symmetric mode, we must choose the root $|k|<1$, so $k_a = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe general solution for the voltages for $n \\ge 1$ is a superposition of these decaying modes:\n$V_{cn} = C_s + C_a k_a^n$\n$V_{dn} = C_s - C_a k_a^n$\n\n**6. Applying Boundary Conditions**\nNow we use the nodal equations at the start of the ladder ($n=1$), with $V_{c0}=0$ and a test voltage $V_{a0}$ applied.\nNodal equation at $c_1$: $\\frac{V_{c1} - V_{c0}}{r} + \\frac{V_{c1} - V_{c2}}{r} + \\frac{V_{c1} - V_{d1}}{r} = 0$. With $V_{c0}=0$, this becomes $3V_{c1} - V_{c2} - V_{d1} = 0$.\nSubstituting the general solutions:\n$3(C_s + C_a k_a) - (C_s + C_a k_a^2) - (C_s - C_a k_a) = 0$\n$C_s + C_a(4k_a - k_a^2) = 0$\nSince $k_a$ is a root of $k^2 - 4k + 1 = 0$, we have $4k_a - k_a^2 = 1$.\nSo, the equation simplifies to $C_s + C_a = 0$, which means $C_s = -C_a$.\n\nThe voltages along the ladder are therefore:\n$V_{cn} = -C_a + C_a k_a^n = C_a(k_a^n - 1)$\n$V_{dn} = -C_a - C_a k_a^n = -C_a(k_a^n + 1)$\n\n**7. Finding the Resistance**\nNow we use the nodal equation at $d_1$. The current from the test source is $I_{test} = (V_{a0} - V_{d1})/r$.\nThe nodal equation at $d_1$ is: $\\frac{V_{d1} - V_{a0}}{r} + \\frac{V_{d1} - V_{d2}}{r} + \\frac{V_{d1} - V_{c1}}{r} = 0$.\n$V_{a0} = 3V_{d1} - V_{d2} - V_{c1}$\nSubstitute the expressions for the voltages in terms of $C_a$:\n$V_{c1} = C_a(k_a - 1)$\n$V_{d1} = -C_a(k_a + 1)$\n$V_{d2} = -C_a(k_a^2 + 1)$\n$V_{a0} = 3(-C_a(k_a+1)) - (-C_a(k_a^2+1)) - (C_a(k_a-1))$\n$\\frac{V_{a0}}{-C_a} = 3(k_a+1) - (k_a^2+1) + (k_a-1) = 3k_a+3 - k_a^2-1 + k_a-1 = -k_a^2 + 4k_a + 1$\nUsing $k_a^2 - 4k_a + 1 = 0$, we get $-k_a^2 + 4k_a = 1$.\nSo, $\\frac{V_{a0}}{-C_a} = 1 + 1 = 2 \\implies V_{a0} = -2C_a$.\n\nNow we find the ratio $V_{d1}/V_{a0}$:\n$\\frac{V_{d1}}{V_{a0}} = \\frac{-C_a(k_a+1)}{-2C_a} = \\frac{k_a+1}{2}$\n\nThe Thevenin resistance is $R_{th} = \\frac{V_{a0}}{I_{test}} = \\frac{V_{a0}}{(V_{a0}-V_{d1})/r} = \\frac{r}{1 - V_{d1}/V_{a0}}$.\n$R_{th} = \\frac{r}{1 - (k_a+1)/2} = \\frac{r}{(2 - k_a - 1)/2} = \\frac{2r}{1-k_a}$.\nSubstitute $k_a = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r}{1 - (2 - \\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}$.\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by $(\\sqrt{3}+1)$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{(\\sqrt{3}-1)(\\sqrt{3}+1)} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{3-1} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{2} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$.\n\n**8. Final Answer**\nThe cutoff angular frequency is $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$.\nSubstituting the calculated value of $R_{th}$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$.\nThe cutoff frequency in Hz is $f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$. The question asks for the cutoff frequency, and the angular frequency $\\omega_c$ is the standard form in such theoretical problems.\n\n<<<1/(r*(1+sqrt(3))*C)>>>"
