    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of the current I.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Circuit Diagram and Identify Nodes**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the circuit. This is a combination series-parallel circuit. Let's identify the key nodes (junction points) in the circuit.\n*   **Source Node (V_S):** The entire vertical wire on the left is connected to the positive terminal of the 41 V battery. So, the potential along this wire is 41 V.\n*   **Ground Node (GND):** The entire vertical wire on the right is connected to the negative terminal of the battery and to the ground symbol. So, the potential along this wire is 0 V.\n*   **Node A:** This is the junction point where the 76 Ω, 8 Ω, and 14 Ω resistors meet.\n*   **Node B:** This is the junction point where the 14 Ω, 11 Ω, and 29 Ω resistors meet.\n*   **Current I:** The arrow for current I is shown on the wire connecting Node A and Node B. This means we need to find the current flowing through the 14 Ω resistor. The arrow indicates the direction is from Node A to Node B.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the Parallel Resistor Groups**\n\nThe circuit can be simplified by combining the resistors that are in parallel.\n*   **Left-side parallel group (R_p1):** The 76 Ω and 8 Ω resistors are both connected between the Source Node (41 V) and Node A. Therefore, they are in parallel. Their equivalent resistance (R_p1) is:\n    R_p1 = (76 * 8) / (76 + 8) = 608 / 84 = 152 / 21 Ω ≈ 7.24 Ω.\n*   **Right-side parallel group (R_p2):** The 11 Ω and 29 Ω resistors are both connected between Node B and the Ground Node (0 V). Therefore, they are also in parallel. Their equivalent resistance (R_p2) is:\n    R_p2 = (11 * 29) / (11 + 29) = 319 / 40 Ω = 7.975 Ω.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Simplified Series Circuit**\n\nAfter simplifying the parallel groups, the circuit becomes a simple series circuit consisting of three parts connected between the 41 V source and ground:\n1.  The equivalent resistance R_p1.\n2.  The 14 Ω resistor (let's call it R_mid).\n3.  The equivalent resistance R_p2.\n\nThese three resistances are in series.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Total Equivalent Resistance**\n\nThe total equivalent resistance (R_total) of the entire circuit is the sum of the resistances in the simplified series circuit.\n*   R_total = R_p1 + R_mid + R_p2\n*   R_total = (152 / 21) Ω + 14 Ω + (319 / 40) Ω\n*   To add these, we find a common denominator, which is 21 * 40 = 840.\n*   R_total = (152 * 40) / 840 + (14 * 840) / 840 + (319 * 21) / 840\n*   R_total = (6080 + 11760 + 6699) / 840\n*   R_total = 24539 / 840 Ω ≈ 29.21 Ω.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Current I**\n\nThe current I we are looking for is the current flowing through the 14 Ω resistor. In our simplified series circuit, this is the total current flowing from the source, as the same current flows through all components in a series circuit.\n*   Using Ohm's Law (V = I * R), we can find the total current (I_total), which is equal to I.\n*   I = V_S / R_total\n*   I = 41 V / (24539 / 840 Ω)\n*   I = (41 * 840) / 24539 A\n*   I = 34440 / 24539 A\n*   I ≈ 1.4035 A\n\nThe value of the current I is approximately 1.40 A.\n\n---\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Circuit Interpretation:** The most crucial step is correctly interpreting the schematic. Misinterpreting the connections (e.g., as a different type of bridge circuit) would lead to an incorrect result. The interpretation as a series-parallel combination is the most standard and consistent one for this layout.\n2.  **Location of I:** It's important to correctly identify which current the symbol 'I' represents. Here, it clearly indicates the current in the branch containing the 14 Ω resistor, flowing from the left junction (Node A) to the right junction (Node B).\n3.  **Calculations:** Using fractions throughout the calculation until the final step helps maintain precision and avoid rounding errors.\n4.  **Direction of Current:** The calculation should confirm that the current flows from left to right. Since current flows from higher potential to lower potential, we would expect the voltage at Node A to be higher than at Node B. In the series circuit, voltage drops progressively from the source, so V_A > V_B, confirming the direction of I.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nI = 34440 / 24539 ≈ 1.4035 A. Rounding to three significant figures gives 1.40 A.\n\n<<<1.40>>>"
