    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the rotational symmetry of the tiling shown in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the components of the tiling.**\nThe tiling is a complex pattern made up of several different geometric shapes (tiles) of different colors:\n*   Dark blue regular hexagons.\n*   Light yellow squares.\n*   Orange rhombi.\n*   Light yellow irregular pentagons.\n\n**Step 2: Identify potential centers of rotational symmetry.**\nTo find the rotational symmetry, we look for points in the pattern around which we can rotate the entire tiling so that it looks identical to its original position. We can identify several distinct types of local arrangements that suggest different rotational symmetries.\n\n*   **Center of a blue hexagon:** Each blue hexagon is surrounded by six identical light yellow pentagons. This local arrangement appears to have **6-fold rotational symmetry**. If you rotate the pattern by 360/6 = 60 degrees around the center of a hexagon, the hexagon maps onto itself, and each surrounding pentagon maps onto the next one. The entire pattern seems to maintain this symmetry around these points.\n\n*   **Center of a light yellow square:** Each light yellow square is surrounded by four identical light yellow pentagons. This local arrangement appears to have **4-fold rotational symmetry**. Rotating the pattern by 360/4 = 90 degrees around the center of a square seems to map the entire tiling onto itself.\n\n*   **Center of the star-like motifs:** There are prominent star-like motifs in the pattern. At the center of each of these motifs, five light yellow pentagons meet at a single point. This arrangement is surrounded by five orange rhombi. This structure has **5-fold rotational symmetry**. Rotating the pattern by 360/5 = 72 degrees around this central point maps each pentagon and rhombus onto the next, and the overall pattern appears unchanged.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the implications of these symmetries.**\nWe have identified local centers of 4-fold, 5-fold, and 6-fold rotational symmetry. Now we must consider the properties of geometric tilings.\n\n*   **The Crystallographic Restriction Theorem:** This fundamental theorem in geometry and crystallography states that a periodic tiling (one that repeats regularly in a grid-like fashion) can only have 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, or 6-fold rotational symmetries. It cannot have 5-fold symmetry or any symmetry higher than 6-fold.\n*   Furthermore, a single periodic tiling cannot simultaneously have both 4-fold and 6-fold rotational symmetry centers.\n\n**Step 4: Resolve the contradiction.**\nThe visual evidence of 4-fold, 5-fold, and 6-fold symmetries contradicts the rules for periodic tilings. This leads to a crucial conclusion:\n\n*   The tiling shown in the image is **not a periodic tiling**. It is an example of an **aperiodic tiling**, also known as a **quasicrystalline tiling**. These are ordered but not periodic patterns.\n\nBecause the tiling is aperiodic, the crystallographic restriction theorem does not apply, and it is possible for it to exhibit rotational symmetries forbidden to periodic crystals, such as 5-fold symmetry.\n\n**Step 5: Determine \"the\" rotational symmetry.**\nThe question asks for \"the rotational symmetry\" of the tiling (singular). Since the tiling has multiple different local symmetries (4-fold, 5-fold, and 6-fold), the question is slightly ambiguous. However, in the context of quasicrystals, the most important and defining feature is the presence of \"forbidden\" non-crystallographic symmetry.\n\n*   The 5-fold rotational symmetry is what makes this tiling mathematically special. Its discovery in materials and patterns was a major scientific breakthrough (the 2011 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded for the discovery of quasicrystals). This pattern is a famous example from medieval Islamic architecture (the Darb-i Imam shrine in Isfahan) that was later shown to be a sophisticated quasicrystalline design.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer for \"the\" rotational symmetry is the one that characterizes its unique nature as a quasicrystal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe tiling is an aperiodic quasicrystal. While it contains local motifs with 4-fold and 6-fold symmetry, its most defining characteristic is the presence of 5-fold rotational symmetry, which is forbidden in periodic structures.\n\n<<<5-fold>>>"
