    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the knot**\n\nFirst, we need to identify the knot shown in the diagram.\n1.  **Count the crossings:** By inspecting the diagram, we can count the number of crossings. There is a central \"ladder\" of 5 crossings, and one crossing on each side, for a total of 7 crossings.\n2.  **Check for alternating property:** An alternating knot has a diagram where the crossings alternate between \"over\" and \"under\" as we trace along the knot. Following the path of the knot in the given diagram, we can see that the crossings indeed alternate. Therefore, this is an alternating knot.\n3.  **Identify from knot tables:** The knot is a 7-crossing alternating knot. By comparing the given diagram with standard knot tables (like those in Rolfsen's \"Knots and Links\" or on the Knot Atlas), we can identify this knot as the **7₄ knot**. The diagram provided is a standard representation of this knot.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Rasmussen invariant and its properties**\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant, denoted s(K), is an integer-valued knot invariant derived from Khovanov homology. A key theorem by Jacob Rasmussen states that for any alternating knot K, its Rasmussen invariant is equal to its classical signature.\n*   **Theorem:** For an alternating knot K, s(K) = σ(K).\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to calculating the signature of the 7₄ knot from its given diagram.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the signature of the knot**\n\nThe signature σ(K) can be computed from a diagram D using the Goeritz matrix method.\n\n1.  **Checkerboard Coloring:** We first color the regions of the knot diagram in a checkerboard pattern (black and white). Let's color the unbounded, outer region White (W).\n    *   The 7 regions immediately adjacent to the unbounded region (the \"petal\" like loops) must be Black (B).\n    *   The central region is adjacent to all these 7 black regions, so it must be White (W).\n    *   This gives a valid checkerboard coloring with 2 White regions and 7 Black regions.\n\n2.  **Goeritz Matrix:** We can compute the signature using the Goeritz matrix G_W associated with the White regions (since there are fewer of them). The vertices of the associated graph are the white regions. In our case, we have two white regions: R₁ (unbounded) and R₂ (central). The Goeritz matrix G_W will be a 2x2 matrix.\n    *   The formula for the signature is σ(K) = sign(G_W) - μ_W.\n    *   μ_W is the sum of signs of crossings that are surrounded only by white regions. In our diagram, every crossing separates a white region from a black region. Thus, μ_W = 0.\n    *   The signature is simply σ(K) = sign(G_W).\n\n3.  **Constructing the Goeritz Matrix G_W:**\n    *   The off-diagonal entry G₁₂ is the sum of the signs of the crossings shared by regions R₁ and R₂. Since the unbounded region and the central region are not adjacent (they are separated by the black regions), there are no shared crossings. So, G₁₂ = 0.\n    *   The diagonal entry G_ii is the sum of the signs of the crossings on the boundary of region R_i.\n        *   For G₁₁, we sum the signs of all crossings on the boundary of the unbounded region R₁. All 7 crossings lie on this boundary. This sum is precisely the **writhe** of the diagram, w(D).\n        *   For G₂₂, we sum the signs of all crossings on the boundary of the central region R₂. Again, all 7 crossings lie on this boundary. This sum is also the writhe, w(D).\n\n4.  **Calculate the Writhe w(D):** We need to assign an orientation to the knot and sum the signs of the crossings. Let's orient the central strand downwards and the connecting side strands accordingly.\n    *   Using the right-hand rule (thumb along the over-strand, fingers curl in the direction of the under-strand; if this works, sign is +1, else -1), we find the signs of the 7 crossings:\n        *   Top central: +1\n        *   Second central: -1\n        *   Third central: +1\n        *   Fourth central: -1\n        *   Bottom central: +1\n        *   Left crossing: -1\n        *   Right crossing: +1\n    *   The writhe is the sum: w(D) = (+1) + (-1) + (+1) + (-1) + (+1) + (-1) + (+1) = 1.\n\n5.  **Finalize the Goeritz Matrix and Signature:**\n    *   G₁₁ = w(D) = 1\n    *   G₂₂ = w(D) = 1\n    *   G₁₂ = G₂₁ = 0\n    *   So, the Goeritz matrix is G_W = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]. This is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n    *   The signature of a matrix is the number of positive eigenvalues minus the number of negative eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of the identity matrix are both 1.\n    *   Therefore, sign(G_W) = 2 - 0 = 2.\n    *   The signature of the knot K in the diagram is σ(K) = sign(G_W) = 2.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Rasmussen Invariant**\n\nAs established in Step 2, for an alternating knot like 7₄, the Rasmussen invariant is equal to the signature.\n*   s(K) = σ(K)\n\nFrom our calculation in Step 3, we found σ(K) = 2.\nTherefore, the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture is 2.\n\n(Note: Some sources list the signature of 7₄ as -2. This refers to the mirror image of the knot shown in the diagram. The diagram provided has a writhe of +1, corresponding to the knot with signature +2. Chirality conventions can vary between different knot tables.)\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n*   Knot is alternating 7₄.\n*   s(7₄) = σ(7₄).\n*   σ(7₄) is calculated from the diagram's Goeritz matrix.\n*   The calculation yields σ(7₄) = 2.\n*   Therefore, s(7₄) = 2.\n\n>>>2"
