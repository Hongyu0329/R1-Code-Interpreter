    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which image represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Structure**\nAn FCC crystal structure has atoms at each of the 8 corners of a cubic unit cell and at the center of each of the 6 faces. The basis atoms in a conventional unit cell (with lattice constant 'a') can be represented by coordinates:\n*   (0, 0, 0) - representing all corner atoms through lattice translations.\n*   (a/2, a/2, 0) - representing the face centers on the xy, yz, and xz planes.\n*   (a/2, 0, a/2)\n*   (0, a/2, a/2)\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Projection along the [110] Direction**\nViewing a crystal structure along a specific direction, like [110], means we are looking down a line parallel to the vector from the origin (0,0,0) to the point (a,a,0). All atoms are projected onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to this viewing direction. We need to determine the resulting 2D pattern of the projected atoms.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Theoretical 2D Pattern for FCC [110]**\nWhen the 3D FCC lattice is projected along the [110] direction, the resulting 2D pattern is a **centered rectangular lattice**. Let's verify this:\n1.  **Unit Cell of the Projection:** The repeating unit in the 2D projection will be a rectangle. The sides of this rectangle are aligned with the [001] and [1-10] directions of the original 3D cube.\n2.  **Side Lengths:** The length of the side parallel to the [001] direction is `a`. The length of the side parallel to the [1-10] direction is `a√2`.\n3.  **Side Ratio:** The ratio of the side lengths of the rectangle is `(a√2) / a = √2 ≈ 1.414`.\n4.  **Atom Positions:** The projected pattern has atoms at the four corners of this rectangle and one atom exactly in the center of the rectangle.\n\nSo, we are looking for an image that shows a **centered rectangle** with a side ratio of approximately **1.414**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Given Images**\n\n*   **Image A:** This image shows atoms arranged in a simple rectangular grid. There are atoms at the corners of the rectangles, but no atoms in the centers. This is a **simple rectangular lattice**. This does not match the centered rectangular pattern of FCC [110].\n\n*   **Image B:** This image shows atoms at the corners of a rectangle and one atom in the center. Let's check the side ratio. The horizontal distance between corner atoms is approximately 7 - 1 = 6 units. The vertical distance is approximately 9 - 3 = 6 units. The side ratio is 6/6 = 1. This is a **centered square lattice**. This pattern corresponds to the projection of a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice along the [100] direction, not an FCC [110] projection.\n\n*   **Image C:** This image shows a more complex pattern that appears to be two interlocking simple rectangular grids. It is not immediately identifiable as a single centered rectangular lattice. This pattern does not fit the expected simple centered rectangular structure.\n\n*   **Image D:** This image clearly shows a **centered rectangular lattice**. There are atoms at the corners of a rectangle and an atom in the center. Let's check the side ratio from the plot's axes.\n    *   Let's define a rectangle by the corner atoms at approximately (x,y) = (0.5, 6.0), (5.5, 6.0), (0.5, 12.5), and (5.5, 12.5).\n    *   The center atom is located at approximately (3.0, 9.0), which is the center of this rectangle.\n    *   The horizontal side length is 5.5 - 0.5 = 5.0 units.\n    *   The vertical side length is 12.5 - 6.0 = 6.5 units.\n    *   The ratio of the side lengths is 6.5 / 5.0 = 1.3.\n    *   While this value of 1.3 is not exactly √2 ≈ 1.414, it is the only option that shows a centered rectangle with a side ratio significantly different from 1. The discrepancy is likely due to the perspective projection used to create the 3D-like image, which can distort lengths.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nComparing the theoretical pattern with the given options:\n*   A is a simple rectangle.\n*   B is a centered square.\n*   C is a complex pattern.\n*   D is a centered rectangle.\n\nImage D is the only one that qualitatively matches the expected **centered rectangular** pattern for an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
