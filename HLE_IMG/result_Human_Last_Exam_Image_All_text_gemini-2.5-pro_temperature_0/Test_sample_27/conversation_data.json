    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the full name of the artist.\n\n**Step 1: Examine the image for clues**\nThe first step is to carefully inspect the painting for any identifying marks, particularly a signature. Signatures are most often found in the bottom corners of an artwork.\n\n**Step 2: Locate and decipher the signature**\nLooking at the bottom right corner of the painting, a signature is visible. The last of the cropped images provides a clearer view of this area. The signature appears to read \"Augusto Pina\" followed by the year \"'38\", indicating it was painted in 1938.\n\n**Step 3: Research the artist's name**\nUsing the name \"Augusto Pina\" from the signature, we can search for artists with this name. A search reveals a well-known Portuguese painter.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the artist's identity and full name**\nResearch confirms that there was a Portuguese naturalist painter named Augusto de Pina (1870â€“1956). His style, particularly in his watercolor landscapes, matches the artwork provided. The signature on the painting is consistent with other known signatures of this artist. Therefore, the artist is Augusto de Pina. The question asks for the *full name*.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer Formulation**\nBased on the analysis of the signature and subsequent research, the full name of the artist who created this painting is Augusto de Pina.\n\n<<<Augusto de Pina>>>"
