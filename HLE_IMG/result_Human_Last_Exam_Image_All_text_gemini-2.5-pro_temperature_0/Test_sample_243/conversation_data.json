    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to answer the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the plant in the image.**\nThe image shows a plant with very distinctive leaves. The key features to note are:\n*   **Leaf Color and Texture:** The leaves are a deep, dark green.\n*   **Venation:** The most striking feature is the prominent, intricate network of white or silvery veins that stand out against the dark green background. This is known as reticulate venation.\n*   **Leaf Shape:** The leaves are ovate to lanceolate (oval to spear-shaped).\n*   **Arrangement:** The leaves appear to be arranged in a whorl or a dense cluster at the end of a stem.\n*   **Other features:** In some of the cropped images, small, dark, round structures can be seen, which are likely flower buds or developing fruits.\n\nBased on this unique combination of features, particularly the dramatic reticulated venation on a shrub-like plant, the species can be identified as ***Debregeasia hedyosma***.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the native range of the identified plant.**\nThe question asks for the island to which this plant was endemic. \"Endemic\" means that a species is native and restricted to a specific geographical location.\n\n**Step 3: Research the endemic location of *Debregeasia hedyosma*.**\nA search of botanical and geographical resources reveals that *Debregeasia hedyosma* is a rare species. Its native habitat is very specific. Reputable sources, such as botanical gardens and scientific databases (like Kew's Plants of the World Online), state that this plant is endemic to the Socotra archipelago.\n\n**Step 4: Provide the final answer.**\nThe Socotra archipelago is known for its incredible biodiversity and a high number of endemic species. The main island of this archipelago is also named Socotra. Therefore, the island to which *Debregeasia hedyosma* is endemic is Socotra.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Accurate Plant Identification:** The primary step is correctly identifying the plant. The unique leaf pattern is the most critical clue, distinguishing it from other plants with variegated or patterned leaves.\n*   **Understanding \"Endemic\":** It's important to understand that \"endemic\" means the plant originates from and is found naturally only in that specific area. While it may be cultivated elsewhere in gardens, its wild origin is restricted to that location.\n*   **Specificity of the Location:** The question asks for the name of the island. The Socotra archipelago consists of four islands, with the largest and main island being Socotra. The plant is endemic to this specific island group.\n\n<<<Socotra>>>"
