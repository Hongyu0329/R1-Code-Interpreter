    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the depicted complexes are expected to show shorter lifetimes.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the context and the question.**\nThe question asks to identify which of the four iridium(III) complexes, used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), would have shorter operational lifetimes. A shorter lifetime implies that the complex degrades more quickly under the operating conditions of an LEC.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the general structure of the complexes.**\nAll four complexes share a common structural motif: [Ir(C^N)₂(N^N)]⁺PF₆⁻.\n*   **Central Metal:** Iridium(III) (Ir).\n*   **Ancillary Ligand (N^N):** All four complexes have the same ancillary ligand, which is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. Since this ligand is identical in all four complexes, it is not the differentiating factor for their stability. The bulky tert-butyl groups are typically added to improve solubility and prevent intermolecular interactions that can quench luminescence.\n*   **Cyclometalating Ligands (C^N):** The key difference between the four complexes lies in the substitution pattern on the two identical cyclometalating ligands, which are derivatives of 2-phenylpyridine (ppy). The stability of the complex is highly dependent on the nature and position of substituents on these C^N ligands.\n*   **Counter-ion:** The counter-ion is hexafluorophosphate (PF₆⁻), a common non-coordinating anion that is unlikely to be the primary determinant of the relative stability differences between these complexes.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the specific C^N ligands in each complex.**\nLet's examine the fluorination pattern on the phenyl ring of the 2-phenylpyridine ligand for each complex. The carbon atom of the phenyl ring bonded to iridium is C1'. The other carbons are numbered sequentially around the ring.\n*   **Complex 1:** The ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has fluorine atoms at the C2' (ortho) and C4' (para) positions relative to the Ir-C bond.\n*   **Complex 2:** The ligand is 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has a fluorine atom at the C4' (para) position.\n*   **Complex 3:** The ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has a fluorine atom at the C2' (ortho) position.\n*   **Complex 4:** The ligand is 2-(3,5-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has fluorine atoms at the C3' and C5' (meta) positions.\n\n**Step 4: Relate ligand structure to the stability and lifetime of the emitter.**\nThe operational lifetime of an emitter in an LEC is determined by its chemical and electrochemical stability. Degradation often occurs when the complex is in a reduced or excited state, which are populated during device operation. A critical factor for the stability of cyclometalated iridium complexes is the strength and inertness of the bonds within the ligands, particularly those near the metal center.\n\n*   **The role of ortho-substituents:** Substituents at the ortho position (C2') of the phenyl ring are in close proximity to the Ir-C bond.\n*   **The ortho-C-F bond degradation pathway:** It is a well-established phenomenon in the field of organic electronics that a C-F bond at the ortho position to the metal-carbon bond is a site of instability. During the operation of an LEC, the iridium complex undergoes redox cycling. In the reduced state (e.g., Ir(II) or Ir(I)), the ortho-C-F bond can be susceptible to reductive cleavage. The iridium center can catalyze this cleavage, leading to the formation of an Ir-F bond and the irreversible degradation of the ligand. This specific degradation pathway is a major contributor to the short operational lifetimes of many blue-emitting iridium complexes that rely on ortho-fluorination.\n*   **Stability of meta- and para-C-F bonds:** C-F bonds at the meta and para positions are much more stable. They are further away from the metal center and do not participate in the same metal-assisted cleavage mechanism. Therefore, fluorination at these positions does not typically introduce this specific, highly detrimental degradation pathway.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the stability principle to the four complexes.**\n*   **Complex 1 and Complex 3:** Both of these complexes have a fluorine atom at the C2' (ortho) position. They are therefore susceptible to the rapid degradation pathway involving the reductive cleavage of the ortho-C-F bond. Consequently, they are expected to have poor operational stability and thus shorter lifetimes.\n*   **Complex 2 and Complex 4:** These complexes do not have a fluorine atom at the ortho position. In Complex 2, the fluorine is at the para position, and in Complex 4, the fluorines are at the meta positions. These complexes lack the specific ortho-C-F degradation pathway and are therefore expected to be significantly more stable and exhibit longer lifetimes compared to Complexes 1 and 3.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis of known degradation mechanisms for fluorinated iridium complexes, the presence of an ortho-fluorine substituent on the cyclometalating ligand is a strong indicator of a shorter device lifetime. Complexes 1 and 3 both contain this structural feature. Therefore, they are the ones expected to show shorter lifetimes.\n\nThe correct choice is the one that includes both Complex 1 and Complex 3.\n\n<<<F>>>"
