    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the transformation to identify the two pericyclic reactions involved.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants, Product, and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Reactants:** The reaction involves two molecules:\n    1.  Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆): An aromatic ring with a cyclic, conjugated system of 6 π-electrons.\n    2.  Cyclobutene (C₄H₄): A cyclic alkene with a 2 π-electron system.\n*   **Product:** The product is a C₁₀H₄F₆ molecule, which is a 1:1 adduct of the two reactants. The structure is a complex, polycyclic cage molecule. A detailed analysis of the connectivity reveals it to be a tetracyclic system (containing four rings) with one remaining double bond. The specific structure is 1,2,3,4,9,10-hexafluoro-tetracyclo[4.4.0.0²,⁵.0⁷,¹⁰]deca-3-ene.\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is promoted by light (hv), indicating that it is a photochemical process. The Woodward-Hoffmann rules for pericyclic reactions are different for photochemical and thermal reactions. The question explicitly states that two \"photochemically allowed\" pericyclic reactions occur.\n\n**Step 2: Propose and Evaluate Potential Reaction Mechanisms**\nA pericyclic reaction is a concerted reaction that proceeds through a cyclic transition state. We need to find a sequence of two such reactions that convert the reactants to the given product under photochemical conditions.\n\n**Mechanism A: Initial Isomerization of Hexafluorobenzene**\nOne possible first step is the photochemical valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to one of its isomers, like hexafluoro-Dewar benzene.\n*   **Step 1a:** Hexafluorobenzene → Hexafluoro-Dewar benzene. This can be classified as an intramolecular **[2+2] cycloaddition**. This reaction is photochemically allowed.\n*   **Step 2a:** The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene, then reacts with cyclobutene. A plausible reaction would be another photochemical **[2+2] cycloaddition** between a double bond of Dewar benzene and the double bond of cyclobutene.\n*   **Evaluation:** While both steps are photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions, the final product of this sequence is a tricyclic molecule (a derivative of tricyclo[4.2.0.0²,⁵]decene). This does not match the tetracyclic structure of the actual product. Therefore, this mechanism is incorrect.\n\n**Mechanism B: Initial Intermolecular Cycloaddition**\nAnother possibility is that the two reactant molecules first combine in an intermolecular cycloaddition.\n*   **Step 1b: [4+2] Cycloaddition.** Hexafluorobenzene can act as a 4π component (diene) and cyclobutene as a 2π component (dienophile) in a cycloaddition reaction.\n    *   According to the simplest Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [4s+2s] cycloaddition is thermally allowed but photochemically forbidden. However, it is well-established that benzene and its derivatives can undergo photochemical [4+2] cycloadditions from their excited state. Thus, this is considered a \"photochemically allowed\" reaction in this context.\n    *   This step forms a tricyclic intermediate: a hexafluoro-tricyclo[4.2.2.0²,⁵]deca-7,9-diene. This intermediate contains a bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene core.\n*   **Step 2b: Intramolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition.** The intermediate formed in the first step contains two double bonds (C=C) held in close proximity within the bicyclo[2.2.2]octadiene framework.\n    *   Upon further irradiation, these two double bonds undergo an intramolecular **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n    *   A [2s+2s] cycloaddition is a classic example of a photochemically allowed pericyclic reaction.\n    *   This second step closes another ring, converting the tricyclic intermediate into the final tetracyclic product.\n*   **Evaluation:** This two-step mechanism, consisting of an intermolecular [4+2] cycloaddition followed by an intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition, correctly predicts the structure of the final product. Both steps are considered photochemically allowed.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\nThe transformation proceeds through two sequential photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions. Based on the analysis that leads to the correct product structure, these reactions are:\n1.  An intermolecular **[4+2] cycloaddition**.\n2.  An intramolecular **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n\nBoth of these are specific types of cycloaddition reactions, which are a major class of pericyclic reactions.\n\n<<<A [4+2] cycloaddition and a [2+2] cycloaddition>>>"
