    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organisms in the photograph.**\nThe image displays a typical rocky intertidal zone community. We can clearly identify several types of marine invertebrates:\n*   **Barnacles:** Numerous small, conical, shelled crustaceans attached to the rock surface. These are acorn barnacles.\n*   **Snails (Gastropods):** There are at least three types of snails visible.\n    1.  A larger snail with a light-colored shell featuring distinct, thin, brown spiral stripes.\n    2.  Another large snail, mostly white and appearing somewhat eroded, but with a similar shape to the first one.\n    3.  Several smaller, darker snails with ribbed shells.\n\n**Step 2: Determine which of these organisms has a specific geographic range that can distinguish between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.**\nTo answer the question, we need to find a species that is common on the Atlantic coast but absent (or at least not native and widespread) on the Pacific coast.\n\n*   **Barnacles:** Many species of acorn barnacles inhabit both coasts. For example, *Semibalanus balanoides* is a common barnacle in the North Atlantic, while *Balanus glandula* is a common barnacle on the Pacific coast. While *S. balanoides* is an Atlantic-only species, distinguishing it from Pacific species based solely on this photograph is difficult for a non-expert, as key identification features (like the base of the shell) are not visible.\n*   **Small, dark snails:** These are likely a species of periwinkle, such as *Littorina saxatilis* (Rough Periwinkle). However, this species is found on both sides of the North Atlantic and has also been introduced to the Pacific coast (e.g., San Francisco Bay), so it is not a definitive indicator.\n*   **Large, striped snail:** This snail is the most distinctive organism in the photo. Its size, shape, and prominent spiral stripes are characteristic features of the **Common Periwinkle**, whose scientific name is *Littorina littorea*.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the geographic distribution of *Littorina littorea*.**\n*   **Native Range:** *Littorina littorea* is native to the northeastern Atlantic coasts of Europe.\n*   **Introduced Range:** It was introduced to the Atlantic coast of North America in the mid-1800s and has since become one of the most common and abundant intertidal snails from Canada down to the Mid-Atlantic states of the U.S.\n*   **Pacific Coast Status:** *Littorina littorea* is **not** native to the Pacific Ocean. While there have been a few isolated findings in locations like San Francisco Bay and Puget Sound (likely from accidental introductions via aquaculture), it is not an established, widespread, or characteristic species of the Pacific coast intertidal zone.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude based on the evidence.**\nThe presence of a healthy, free-living population of *Littorina littorea*, as clearly depicted in the photograph, is a definitive indicator that the location is on a shore of the Atlantic Ocean (either in Europe or North America). None of the other clearly identifiable organisms provide such a clear distinction between the two coasts. Therefore, *Littorina littorea* is the species that answers the question.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
