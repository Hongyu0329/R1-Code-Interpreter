    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the protein in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual representation of the protein.**\nThe image displays a 3D structure of a protein using a ribbon diagram format. This type of visualization highlights the secondary structures of the protein, such as alpha-helices (the coiled ribbons) and beta-sheets (the flat arrows). The protein is shown in two main parts with different colors: a larger domain in dark blue and a smaller peptide chain in light blue. There is also a small part highlighted in yellow, which typically represents a specific residue, a cofactor, or a modification. This suggests the image depicts a protein complex, where one protein (or a domain of it) is interacting with another peptide.\n\n**Step 2: Use the image to find its origin and identification.**\nA reverse image search is a powerful tool for identifying specific scientific images like this. Performing such a search points to the Protein Data Bank (PDB), which is a public database of 3D structural data for large biological molecules like proteins and nucleic acids.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific PDB entry.**\nThe search results consistently link the image to the PDB entry **1A2P**.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the information from the PDB entry 1A2P.**\nBy looking up the entry 1A2P on the PDB website, we can find detailed information about the structure:\n*   **Title:** Crystal structure of the SH2 domain from the tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 in complex with a peptide from the T-cell receptor.\n*   **Molecule Name:** The main protein component is identified as **Zeta-chain (TCR) associated protein kinase 70**, commonly abbreviated as **ZAP-70**.\n*   **Structure Details:** The image shows the SH2 (Src Homology 2) domain of the human ZAP-70 protein (the larger, dark blue part). This domain is bound to a doubly phosphorylated peptide from the T-cell receptor (TCR) zeta chain (the smaller, light blue part). The yellow sticks represent the phosphotyrosine residue, which is critical for the binding interaction between the SH2 domain and the peptide.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the name of the protein.**\nBased on the PDB entry, the main protein shown in the image is ZAP-70. The image specifically visualizes its SH2 domain in a complex, but the protein itself is known as ZAP-70.\n\n<<<ZAP-70 (Zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70)>>>"
