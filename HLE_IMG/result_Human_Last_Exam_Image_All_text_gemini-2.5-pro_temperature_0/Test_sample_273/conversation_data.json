    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chiral Centers and the Parent Chain**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the structure of the molecule. By identifying the longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional group (the amine, -NH2), we can name the molecule and number the carbons according to IUPAC rules.\n\n1.  The functional group is an amino group attached to a methylene (-CH2-), so it's a primary amine. Let's label the carbon attached to the NH2 group as C1.\n2.  The longest carbon chain containing C1 is a pentane chain. Let's number it from right to left to give the amine the lowest number (locant 1).\n    *   C1: The carbon in the -CH2NH2 group.\n    *   C2: The carbon attached to C1, a methyl group, and C3.\n    *   C3: The carbon attached to C2, an ethyl group, and C4.\n    *   C4: The carbon attached to C3, a hydroxyl group, and a methyl group.\n    *   C5: The terminal methyl group attached to C4.\n3.  The IUPAC name is **3-ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-methylpentan-1-amine**.\n4.  The chiral centers (stereocenters) are the carbon atoms with four different substituents. In this molecule, C2, C3, and C4 are chiral centers. We need to determine the absolute configuration (R or S) for each of them.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Configuration of C2**\n\n1.  **Assign priorities** to the groups attached to C2 based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules (higher atomic number gets higher priority).\n    *   Groups attached to C2: -CH2NH2, -CH(Et)CH(OH)CH3 (let's call this the C3-group), -CH3, and -H.\n    *   Comparing the atoms directly attached to C2: C, C, C, H. Hydrogen (-H) has the lowest priority (4).\n    *   To prioritize the three carbon groups, we look at the atoms they are attached to:\n        *   -**C**H2NH2: This carbon is attached to (N, H, H).\n        *   -**C**H(Et)... (C3-group): This carbon is attached to (C, C, H).\n        *   -**C**H3: This carbon is attached to (H, H, H).\n    *   Comparing the highest atomic number in each set: N (atomic number 7) > C (atomic number 6). Therefore, -CH2NH2 has the highest priority.\n    *   Comparing the C3-group and -CH3: (C, C, H) vs (H, H, H). C > H, so the C3-group has higher priority than -CH3.\n    *   Priorities at C2: (1) -CH2NH2, (2) C3-group, (3) -CH3, (4) -H.\n\n2.  **Determine R/S configuration**.\n    *   In the drawing, C2 is the rightmost chiral center. The -CH2NH2 group (1) has a wedge bond (pointing out), and the -CH3 group (3) has a dash bond (pointing in). The C3-group (2) and -H (4) are in the plane of the drawing.\n    *   To assign configuration, we can use the swap method. We swap the lowest priority group (-H, priority 4) with the group on the dashed bond (-CH3, priority 3). An odd number of swaps inverts the configuration.\n    *   After swapping, -H (4) is on the dash bond (pointing away). The -CH3 group (3) is now in the plane.\n    *   Now, with the lowest priority group pointing away, we trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3.\n    *   The path is from -CH2NH2 (1, wedge) to the C3-group (2, in plane, left) to -CH3 (3, in plane, down). This traces a clockwise (CW) circle.\n    *   A clockwise path means the configuration of the swapped molecule is R.\n    *   Since we performed one swap, the original configuration is the opposite. Thus, **C2 is S**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Configuration of C3**\n\n1.  **Assign priorities** to the groups attached to C3:\n    *   Groups: -CH(OH)CH3 (C4-group), -CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (C2-group), -CH2CH3 (ethyl), and -H.\n    *   -H is the lowest priority (4).\n    *   Comparing the carbon groups:\n        *   C4-group: Carbon is attached to (O, C, H).\n        *   C2-group: Carbon is attached to (C, C, H).\n        *   Ethyl: Carbon is attached to (C, H, H).\n    *   O > C, so the C4-group is priority (1).\n    *   Comparing C2-group and Ethyl: (C, C, H) vs (C, H, H). The second C in the C2-group gives it higher priority. So, the C2-group is priority (2), and Ethyl is priority (3).\n    *   Priorities at C3: (1) C4-group, (2) C2-group, (3) Ethyl, (4) -H.\n\n2.  **Determine R/S configuration**.\n    *   In the drawing, C3 is the middle chiral center. The ethyl group (3) is on a wedge, and the implied -H (4) is on a dash.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (4) is already pointing away, we can directly trace the path from 1 to 2 to 3.\n    *   The path is from the C4-group (1, left) to the C2-group (2, right) to the Ethyl group (3, up/wedge). This traces a counter-clockwise (CCW) circle.\n    *   Therefore, **C3 is S**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Configuration of C4**\n\n1.  **Identify the drawing issue**.\n    *   At C4, the leftmost chiral center, both the -OH group and the -CH3 group are shown with dashed bonds. For a tetrahedral sp3 carbon, this is a geometrically incorrect representation if the main chain bonds are in the plane. This is most likely a drawing error. We must assume what the intended stereochemistry was.\n\n2.  **Assign priorities** to the groups attached to C4:\n    *   Groups: -OH, -CH(Et)CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (C3-group), -CH3, and -H.\n    *   -OH is priority (1) (O > C).\n    *   -H is priority (4).\n    *   Comparing the C3-group and -CH3: The C3-group carbon is attached to (C, C, H), while the methyl carbon is attached to (H, H, H). So, the C3-group is priority (2) and -CH3 is priority (3).\n    *   Priorities at C4: (1) -OH, (2) C3-group, (3) -CH3, (4) -H.\n\n3.  **Determine R/S configuration (by correcting the drawing)**.\n    *   Let's assume the typo was that one of the dashed bonds should have been a wedge. Let's test the more plausible case where the drawing intended to show a specific conformation via a non-standard representation of the backbone.\n    *   **Interpretation**: Assume the C3-C4 bond is a wedge (coming out of the plane) and the C4-H bond is a dash (going into the plane), with the -OH and -CH3 groups in the plane.\n    *   With the lowest priority group (-H, 4) pointing away, we trace the path 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   The path is from -OH (1, in plane, up-left) to the C3-group (2, wedge, front) to -CH3 (3, in plane, down-left). This traces a clockwise (CW) circle.\n    *   Therefore, this interpretation leads to **C4 being R**.\n    *   *Note: Assuming the typo was OH(dash)/CH3(wedge) also leads to an R configuration for C4, lending some support to this assignment.*\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Results**\n\nBy combining the configurations of the three chiral centers, we get the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n*   C2 is S\n*   C3 is S\n*   C4 is R\n\nThe absolute configuration is (2S, 3S, 4R).\n\n<<(2S, 3S, 4R)>>>"
