**Product A:** The structure is the cycloadduct formed from the azomethine ylide of the starting material and methyl propiolate, which is then acetylated on the nitrogen of the pyrroline substituent. Its structure is methyl 7-(1-acetyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-2,3,5,6,7,7a-hexahydro-1H-pyrrolizine-5-carboxylate.
 

**Product B:** The structure is a rearranged tricyclic product, (Z)-2-(2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-4-oxo-4H,5H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrimidin-1(8H)-ylidene)propanoic acid. (This structure is adjusted to match the C12 formula).
 

**Product C:** The structure is the N-acetylated starting material, 1-(1-acetyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid.
