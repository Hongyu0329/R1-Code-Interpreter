    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step 1: Locate the Measure and Determine the Key**\n*   First, we locate measure 30 in the provided sheet music. The measures are numbered, and we can see measure 28 at the beginning of the second system. Measure 30 is the third measure of that system and is the second measure inside the circled area.\n*   Next, we identify the key signature. There are three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). This indicates the key of C minor or E♭ major. The first movement of the \"Pathetique\" sonata is in C minor. This specific passage is part of the first theme group, which is firmly established in C minor.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Notes in Measure 30**\n*   We need to identify all the notes being played in this measure across both staves.\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays an octave on the note G (G2 and G3).\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The right hand plays a series of fast, broken chords (arpeggios). The notes in each group are G, B-natural (the natural sign cancels the B♭ in the key signature), D, and F-sharp (the sharp sign indicates an alteration).\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to observe the accidentals. The B is natural, and the F is sharp. These are not diatonic to the key of C natural minor.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Chord**\n*   Combining the notes from both hands, the complete harmony for measure 30 consists of the notes: G, B-natural, D, and F-sharp.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Chord Quality**\n*   Let's analyze the structure of this collection of notes:\n    *   The root of the chord is G.\n    *   The notes G, B-natural, and D form a G major triad.\n    *   The note F-sharp is a major seventh above the root G.\n*   A major triad with a major seventh is called a major seventh chord. Therefore, the chord is a G major seventh chord (Gmaj7).\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Roman Numeral**\n*   Roman numeral analysis describes a chord's function within a key.\n    *   The key is C minor.\n    *   The root of our chord is G, which is the fifth scale degree of C minor. The fifth degree is called the dominant.\n    *   A chord built on the dominant is represented by the Roman numeral **V**.\n    *   Because the triad is major (G-B♮-D), we use a capital Roman numeral. The use of the leading tone (B-natural instead of B-flat) to create a major dominant is standard practice in minor keys.\n    *   The chord is a seventh chord, and we must indicate the quality of the seventh. The seventh is F-sharp, a major seventh. This is denoted by the suffix \"maj7\" or \"M7\".\n*   **Careful Point:** This is not a standard dominant seventh chord (V7), which would have a minor seventh (F-natural in this case). The F-sharp is a chromatic alteration that makes the chord a major seventh.\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer Formulation**\n*   Combining the root position (V), the major quality (capital numeral), and the major seventh quality (maj7), the correct and most precise Roman numeral for the Gmaj7 chord in the key of C minor is **Vmaj7**. This chord functions as a highly tense dominant, resolving to the tonic C minor chord (i) in the following measure.\n\n<<<Vmaj7>>>"
