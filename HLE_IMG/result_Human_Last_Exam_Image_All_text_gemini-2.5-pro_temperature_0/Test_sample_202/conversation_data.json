    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens.\n\n**Careful Points for Rock Identification:**\n1.  **Texture:** Look at the size, shape, and arrangement of the grains or crystals. Is it crystalline or clastic (made of fragments)? Are the crystals large (phaneritic) or too small to see (aphanitic)? Are there holes (vesicular)?\n2.  **Composition/Color:** Observe the different minerals present and the overall color of the rock. Light-colored rocks are often \"felsic\" (rich in feldspar and silica), while dark-colored rocks are often \"mafic\" (rich in magnesium and iron).\n3.  **Formation Process:** Use texture and composition to infer how the rock formed.\n    *   **Igneous:** Formed from cooled magma or lava. Intrusive (plutonic) rocks cool slowly underground, forming large crystals (e.g., granite). Extrusive (volcanic) rocks cool quickly at the surface, forming small crystals or glass, and may be vesicular (e.g., pumice, scoria).\n    *   **Sedimentary:** Formed from the accumulation and cementation of sediments (fragments of other rocks, organic matter, or chemical precipitates). Clastic sedimentary rocks are classified by grain size and shape (e.g., breccia, conglomerate, sandstone).\n    *   **Metamorphic:** Formed when existing rocks are changed by heat, pressure, or chemical reactions. They often show features like foliation (layering).\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Specimen H:**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a very porous surface, covered in many small, bubble-like holes (vesicles). The texture of the solid part is fine-grained (aphanitic).\n*   **Interpretation:** The vesicular texture is a clear indicator of an extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock that cooled rapidly from gas-rich lava, trapping the gas bubbles. The reddish color is likely due to the oxidation of iron within the minerals.\n*   **Identification:** This rock is **Scoria**. It is distinguished from pumice by its darker color (red, brown, or black) and typically greater density.\n\n**Specimen I:**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is composed of numerous smaller rock fragments (clasts) that are cemented together in a lighter-colored matrix. The fragments are of various sizes (poorly sorted) and, importantly, have sharp, angular edges.\n*   **Interpretation:** This is a clastic sedimentary rock. The angularity of the clasts signifies that the fragments were not transported far from their source by water or wind, as transport would have rounded the edges.\n*   **Identification:** A clastic sedimentary rock made of angular, gravel-sized fragments is known as **Breccia**.\n\n**Specimen J:**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is very light in color (off-white to light gray) and, like specimen H, is highly vesicular. It appears extremely porous and lightweight, with a frothy or spongy texture.\n*   **Interpretation:** This is another extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock. Its extremely high porosity and light color are key identifiers. It formed from a silica-rich, gas-filled lava that cooled so quickly it created a glassy foam.\n*   **Identification:** This rock is **Pumice**. It is famously low in density and can often float on water.\n\n**Specimen K:**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. The texture is coarse-grained (phaneritic). It contains a mix of light-colored minerals (white, gray, and pinkish/tan) and some darker minerals.\n*   **Interpretation:** The coarse-grained, crystalline texture indicates an intrusive (plutonic) igneous rock that cooled slowly deep beneath the Earth's surface, allowing large crystals to grow. The mineral composition, with light-colored feldspar (the pinkish/tan crystals) and quartz, along with dark minerals like biotite or hornblende, is characteristic of a felsic plutonic rock.\n*   **Identification:** This rock is **Granite**.\n\n---\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Granite\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Granite>>>"
