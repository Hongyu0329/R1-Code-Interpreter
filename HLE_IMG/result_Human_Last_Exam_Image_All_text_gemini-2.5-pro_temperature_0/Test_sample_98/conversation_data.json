    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the century of the medallion:\n\n1.  **Object Identification and Description:** The image shows a highly ornate, circular object with a tab at the top. This is not a medallion but the head of a very large fibula (a type of brooch). It is made of gold and depicts two stylized figures facing each other. The figure on the left is particularly distinct, with a large ram-like horn and patterned hair. The artistic style is not typical of classical Greek or Roman art.\n\n2.  **Archaeological Context:** This specific artifact is known as the great eagle-headed fibula from the Pietroasele Treasure (sometimes spelled Pietroasa). This famous hoard of gold objects was discovered in Romania in 1837.\n\n3.  **Cultural Attribution:** The treasure is associated with the Goths, a Germanic people who were powerful in the region north of the Roman Empire's Danube frontier during the late antique period. The artwork is a prime example of the Migration Period style, which flourished in Europe between the 4th and 8th centuries.\n\n4.  **Dating the Artifact:** Based on stylistic analysis, comparison with other dated objects (like Roman coins), and the historical context of the Goths, archaeologists have confidently dated the Pietroasele Treasure. The objects are believed to have been made and buried in the second half of the 4th century AD. The burial is often linked to the turmoil caused by the invasion of the Huns around 376 AD, which prompted the Goths to flee the area.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since the fibula was created and buried in the period between 350 AD and 400 AD, it belongs to the 4th century AD.\n\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
