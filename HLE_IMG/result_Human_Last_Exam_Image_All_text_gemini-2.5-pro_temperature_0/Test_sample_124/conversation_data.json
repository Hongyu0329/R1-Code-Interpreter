    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the circuit to determine the total current.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the circuit's structure.**\nThe circuit consists of a DC voltage source (V2 = 1 V) connected to three parallel branches. The total current flowing from the source is the sum of the currents in each of these branches. To find the total current, we can first find the total equivalent resistance (R_eq) of the circuit and then use Ohm's Law (I = V/R).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first parallel branch (containing R1, R2, and R3).**\n*   This branch has resistors R1 (3 Ω), R2 (7 Ω), and R3 (9 Ω).\n*   A crucial feature is the wire connecting the point between R1 and R2 to the point between R2 and R3. This wire is in parallel with resistor R2.\n*   Since an ideal wire has zero resistance, it creates a \"short circuit\" across R2. All the current that passes through R1 will flow through this wire, bypassing R2 entirely, because current follows the path of least resistance.\n*   Therefore, R2 does not affect the circuit, and this branch behaves as if R1 and R3 are simply connected in series.\n*   The equivalent resistance of this first branch (R_branch1) is the sum of R1 and R3:\n    R_branch1 = R1 + R3 = 3 Ω + 9 Ω = 12 Ω.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second and third parallel branches.**\n*   The second branch consists only of resistor R7 (100 Ω), which is connected directly across the voltage source. So, R_branch2 = 100 Ω.\n*   The third branch consists only of resistor R8 (100 Ω), which is also connected directly across the voltage source. So, R_branch3 = 100 Ω.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total equivalent resistance (R_eq) of the circuit.**\nThe three branches are in parallel. The formula for the total resistance of parallel resistors is:\n1 / R_eq = 1 / R_branch1 + 1 / R_branch2 + 1 / R_branch3\nSubstitute the values we found:\n1 / R_eq = 1/12 Ω + 1/100 Ω + 1/100 Ω\n1 / R_eq = 1/12 + 2/100\n1 / R_eq = 1/12 + 1/50\nTo add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 300:\n1 / R_eq = (25/300) + (6/300)\n1 / R_eq = 31/300\nNow, we invert the fraction to find R_eq:\nR_eq = 300 / 31 Ω ≈ 9.68 Ω.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total current (I_total).**\nUsing Ohm's Law, the total current flowing from the voltage source is:\nI_total = V2 / R_eq\nI_total = 1 V / (300 / 31 Ω)\nI_total = 31 / 300 A\n\n**Step 6: Convert the result to a decimal value.**\nI_total ≈ 0.10333... A\nThis can also be expressed as 103.33 mA. Rounding to three significant figures, the current is 0.103 A.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The most important point is to correctly identify the short circuit across resistor R2. Mistaking the first branch for a simple series connection of R1, R2, and R3 would lead to an incorrect result.\n*   Ensure the correct formula for parallel resistors is used (sum of reciprocals).\n*   Be careful with the fraction arithmetic to ensure accuracy.\n*   The final answer should be in Amperes (A), the standard unit of current.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nI_total = 31 / 300 A ≈ 0.103 A.\n\n<<<0.103 A>>>"
