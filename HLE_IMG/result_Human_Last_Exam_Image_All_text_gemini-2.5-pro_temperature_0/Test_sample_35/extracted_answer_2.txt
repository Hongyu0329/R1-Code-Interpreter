The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **V-domain** of the RAGE receptor.

S100B could be used as a **prognostic marker** and not solely as an adjunct marker. While its overexpression in disease states allows it to serve as an adjunct for diagnosis, its primary value lies in its prognostic potential. The diagram shows that S100B is an upstream activator of pathways (JNK/JUN and NFÎºB) that directly cause the core pathologies of neurodegeneration, including neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and apoptosis. Therefore, the concentration of S100B is directly proportional to the severity and progression of the disease, allowing clinicians to predict the patient's future clinical course and outcome.
