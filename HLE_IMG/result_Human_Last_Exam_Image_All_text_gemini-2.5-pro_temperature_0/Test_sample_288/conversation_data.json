    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the musical artist who played at the venue on the specified date.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Venue**\nThe first step is to identify the building shown in the image. The architecture is quite distinctive, featuring red brickwork (some in a herringbone pattern), a curved roofline, and a prominent quatrefoil-shaped decorative element on a beige facade. A large semi-truck, typical of those used for touring productions, is parked in front, strongly suggesting the building is a theater or concert hall.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Venue**\nUsing the architectural details as search clues, a reverse image search or a descriptive search (e.g., \"red brick theater with quatrefoil design\") points to the **Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox** located in Spokane, Washington. Comparing the image with other photos of this theater online confirms the match, as all the key architectural elements are identical.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Event Schedule**\nThe question asks for the musical artist who performed at this venue on a specific date: **October 12, 2023**. The next step is to search for the event calendar for the Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox for that particular date.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Performer**\nA search of the theater's past events, concert archives, or local event listings for October 12, 2023, reveals that the **Goo Goo Dolls** were performing at the Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox on that night as part of their \"The Big Night Out Tour\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Venue Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify the venue from the visual information provided in the image. The unique architectural features are the key to this step.\n*   **Date Specificity:** The query is for a very specific date (October 12, 2023). It's important to find the event for that exact day and not a different day in the same month or year.\n*   **Information Verification:** The information about the performer should be cross-referenced from reliable sources, such as the official venue website, reputable ticketing agencies (like Ticketmaster), or concert listing sites (like Bandsintown or Songkick), to ensure accuracy. In this case, multiple sources confirm the Goo Goo Dolls' performance.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the name of the musical artist.\n\n<<<Goo Goo Dolls>>>"
