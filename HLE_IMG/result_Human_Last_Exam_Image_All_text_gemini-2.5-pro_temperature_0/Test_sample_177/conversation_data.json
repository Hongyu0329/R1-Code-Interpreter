    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by comparing the \"Baseline\" scenario (Table 1) with the \"Proposed\" scenario (Table 2).\n\n**2. Define Car VMT**\nVMT stands for Vehicle Miles Traveled. It represents the total distance traveled by vehicles. In this problem, we are concerned with cars. The tables provide two categories for car travel:\n*   `car, 1 occupant`\n*   `car, with more than 2 occupants`\n\nTo calculate the total Car VMT, we need to sum the VMT from both of these categories. The \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" is not needed for this calculation, as VMT measures the miles traveled by the *vehicle*, not the people.\n\n**3. Formulate the Calculation**\nTo find the total VMT, we need to calculate the VMT for each trip distance category and then sum them up. The VMT for a single category is calculated as:\n\n`VMT (category) = (Share of total trips) × (Total car mode share for that category) × (Average trip distance for that category)`\n\nWe will calculate a total \"weighted VMT\" for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios. Since the total number of trips is not given, we can calculate the average VMT per trip, which is sufficient for finding the percentage reduction.\n\n**4. Calculate Total Car VMT for the Baseline Scenario (Table 1)**\n\n*   **0-3 miles category:**\n    *   Total car share = 25% (1 occupant) + 28% (>2 occupants) = 53%\n    *   VMT contribution = 48% (share of trips) × 53% (car share) × 1 (avg distance) = 0.48 × 0.53 × 1 = 0.2544\n\n*   **3-5 miles category:**\n    *   Total car share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   VMT contribution = 22% × 81% × 4 = 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = 0.7128\n\n*   **5-10 miles category:**\n    *   Total car share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   VMT contribution = 14% × 85% × 7.5 = 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = 0.8925\n\n*   **10+ miles category:**\n    *   Total car share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   VMT contribution = 16% × 89% × 20 = 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = 2.8480\n\n*   **Total Baseline VMT (weighted per trip):**\n    *   `VMT_Baseline = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = 4.7077`\n\n**5. Calculate Total Car VMT for the Proposed Scenario (Table 2)**\n\n*   **0-3 miles category:**\n    *   Total car share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   VMT contribution = 48% × 3% × 1 = 0.48 × 0.03 × 1 = 0.0144\n\n*   **3-5 miles category:**\n    *   Total car share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   VMT contribution = 22% × 27% × 4 = 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = 0.2376\n\n*   **5-10 miles category:**\n    *   Total car share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   VMT contribution = 14% × 41% × 7.5 = 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = 0.4305\n\n*   **10+ miles category:**\n    *   Total car share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   VMT contribution = 16% × 49% × 20 = 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = 1.5680\n\n*   **Total Proposed VMT (weighted per trip):**\n    *   `VMT_Proposed = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = 2.2505`\n\n**6. Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\nThe formula for percentage reduction is: `((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) × 100%`\n\n*   VMT Reduction = `4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572`\n*   Percentage Reduction = `(2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100%`\n*   Percentage Reduction ≈ `52.195%`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n*   The question asks for **Car VMT**, not Person Miles Traveled (PMT). Therefore, the average carpool occupancy data is irrelevant and should be ignored.\n*   The \"share of total trips\" and \"Average trip distance\" are constant across both tables and serve as the foundation for the calculation.\n*   For each distance category, the mode shares for the two car types must be added together to get the total car mode share before multiplying.\n*   The final percentage reduction must be calculated relative to the original **Baseline** VMT.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is **52.2%**.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
