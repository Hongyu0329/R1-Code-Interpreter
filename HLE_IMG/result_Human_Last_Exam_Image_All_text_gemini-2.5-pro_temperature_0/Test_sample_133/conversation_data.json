    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Ion Region**\n1.  **Identify the highest mass cluster:** The peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) are in the range of 258-266. This region likely contains the molecular ion (M⁺) and its isotopic peaks.\n2.  **Look for halogen patterns:** The presence of multiple peaks in the molecular ion region, separated by 2 mass units (e.g., M, M+2, M+4), is characteristic of chlorine or bromine.\n3.  **Analyze the isotopic cluster:** Let's examine the cluster starting from m/z 260, as it seems to be the beginning of a logical pattern that fits the relative abundances of chlorine isotopes (³⁵Cl ≈ 75%, ³⁷Cl ≈ 25%, ratio ≈ 3:1).\n    *   m/z 260 (I = 34.8%)\n    *   m/z 262 (I = 29.0%)\n    *   m/z 264 (I = 12.9%)\n    *   m/z 266 (I = 3.22%)\n4.  **Determine the number of chlorine atoms:** We can compare the experimental intensity ratios to the theoretical ratios for multiple chlorine atoms.\n    *   For 3 chlorine atoms, the theoretical ratio of intensities for M⁺ : M+2 : M+4 : M+6 is approximately (3)³ : 3(3)²(1) : 3(3)(1)² : (1)³ = 27 : 27 : 9 : 1, which normalizes to approximately 100 : 100 : 33 : 4.\n    *   The experimental intensities are 34.8, 29.0, 12.9, 3.22. Normalizing to the most intense peak in this group (m/z 260): 100 : 83 : 37 : 9.\n    *   This experimental ratio is a good match for a compound containing **three chlorine atoms**. The monoisotopic molecular ion peak (containing only ¹²C, ¹H, ¹⁶O, ³⁵Cl) is therefore at **m/z 260**. The peak at m/z 258 is likely a fragment ion ([M-2H]⁺) or an impurity.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of Major Fragment Ions**\n1.  **Identify the Base Peak:** The base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum, which is at **m/z 225** (I = 100%).\n2.  **Analyze the formation of the base peak:** The mass difference between the molecular ion (m/z 260) and the base peak (m/z 225) is 260 - 225 = 35 u. This corresponds to the loss of a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl). This is a very common fragmentation pathway for chlorinated compounds, leading to the formation of the [M-Cl]⁺ fragment.\n3.  **Confirm the composition of the base peak:** The base peak at m/z 225 is part of an isotopic cluster:\n    *   m/z 225 (I = 100%)\n    *   m/z 227 (I = 66.7%)\n    *   m/z 229 (I = 22.2%)\n    *   The theoretical intensity ratio for a fragment with two chlorine atoms (M' : M'+2 : M'+4) is (3)² : 2(3)(1) : (1)² = 9 : 6 : 1, which normalizes to 100 : 67 : 11.\n    *   The experimental ratio of 100 : 66.7 : 22.2 is an excellent match for a fragment containing **two chlorine atoms**. This confirms that the parent molecule had three chlorine atoms and lost one to form the base peak.\n\n**Step 3: Deducing the Molecular Structure**\n1.  **Identify other significant fragments:** A prominent peak is observed at **m/z 143** (I = 27.8%). Let's determine how it could be formed.\n    *   The mass difference between the molecular ion (m/z 260) and this fragment is 260 - 143 = 117 u.\n    *   A mass of 117 u corresponds to the trichloromethyl group, •CCl₃ (12 + 3*35 = 117).\n    *   This suggests that the molecule contains a -CCl₃ group attached to a part of the molecule that forms a stable cation with m/z 143.\n2.  **Identify the m/z 143 fragment:** The fragment [M-CCl₃]⁺ has a mass of 143. We need to find a plausible chemical formula for this cation. A very stable aromatic cation with this mass is the **naphthoxy cation, [C₁₀H₇O]⁺**.\n    *   Mass of [C₁₀H₇O]⁺ = (10 × 12) + (7 × 1) + 16 = 120 + 7 + 16 = 143 u.\n3.  **Assemble the structure:** The structure is formed by combining the naphthoxy group (C₁₀H₇O-) and the trichloromethyl group (-CCl₃), linked by the oxygen atom. This gives the structure of **(trichloromethoxy)naphthalene**.\n4.  **Verify the molecular formula and mass:**\n    *   Formula: C₁₁H₇Cl₃O\n    *   Monoisotopic Mass = (11 × 12) + (7 × 1) + (3 × 35) + 16 = 132 + 7 + 105 + 16 = 260 u.\n    *   This matches the molecular ion peak identified in Step 1.\n5.  **Check other fragments:**\n    *   **m/z 190:** [M-Cl-Cl]⁺ = [C₁₁H₇OCl]⁺. Mass = 260 - 35 - 35 = 190. This is a major peak (I=48.4%).\n    *   **m/z 155:** [M-Cl-Cl-Cl]⁺ = [C₁₁H₇O]⁺. Mass = 260 - 3*35 = 155. This is a significant peak (I=16.1%).\n    *   The overall fragmentation pattern (loss of Cl, loss of CCl₃) strongly supports the proposed structure.\n\n**Step 4: Provide the IUPAC Name**\nThe compound is a naphthalene molecule substituted with a -OCCl₃ group. This substituent is called \"trichloromethoxy\". The position of substitution on the naphthalene ring (e.g., 1- or 2-) cannot be determined from this mass spectrum alone. However, a valid systematic IUPAC name can be given by assuming one of the common positions.\n\nFinal Answer: The compound is (trichloromethoxy)naphthalene. A specific systematic name is 2-(trichloromethoxy)naphthalene.\n\n<<<2-(Trichloromethoxy)naphthalene>>>"
