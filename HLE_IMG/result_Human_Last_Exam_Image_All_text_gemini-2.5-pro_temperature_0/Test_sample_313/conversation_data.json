    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue.**\nThe first clue is visual and textual: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows two men at an awards ceremony. The younger man with a beard is receiving a trophy from an older man with white hair.\n*   A search for awards ceremonies on or around this date, featuring individuals matching these descriptions and a similar trophy, points to the 2019 NHL Awards, which took place on June 19, 2019. The slight date discrepancy is common in such questions.\n*   The man receiving the award is Nikita Kucherov of the Tampa Bay Lightning. The man presenting it is NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman. The trophy is the Ted Lindsay Award.\n*   The clue states \"X Y is pictured\". This could refer to a person, or it could refer to an object in the picture. The question \"What is the X Y?\" rather than \"Who is the X Y?\" suggests it might be an object.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\nThe second clue is: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This clue points to a historical object or process that involved mercury and is now obsolete because of health risks.\n*   Several historical items fit this description:\n    *   **Felt hats:** The process of \"carroting\" used mercury nitrate to treat fur for felt, leading to mercury poisoning in hat makers (\"mad as a hatter\").\n    *   **Mercury mirrors:** Before the modern silvering process, mirrors were made using a tin-mercury amalgam. This process was dangerous due to mercury vapors.\n    *   **Daguerreotypes:** An early photographic process that used mercury vapor to develop the image.\n    *   **Calomel:** A mercury chloride compound once used as a medicine.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the clues to find \"X Y\".**\nWe need to find a two-word term (\"X Y\") that fits both clues.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 1: X Y is a person's name.** This seems unlikely. Neither \"Nikita Kucherov\" nor \"Gary Bettman\" has a homonym related to a mercury-based product. Searching for other attendees with fitting names is a dead end.\n\n*   **Hypothesis 2: X Y is an object in the picture.** This seems more promising given the \"What is...\" phrasing. Let's re-examine the objects and connect them to the mercury clue.\n    *   The most prominent object being exchanged is the trophy. Trophies are typically made of metal, often pewter, which is an alloy consisting primarily of **tin**.\n    *   The trophy has a highly polished, reflective surface, making it **mirror**-like.\n    *   Let's combine these observations. The trophy can be described as a \"**Tin Mirror**\" (a mirror-like object made of tin).\n\n**Step 4: Test the hypothesis \"X Y = Tin Mirror\".**\n*   **Clue 1 Check:** \"Tin Mirror is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\" The shiny, pewter (tin-based) trophy is clearly pictured. This fits.\n*   **Clue 2 Check:** \"Another Tin Mirror has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" Historically, mirrors were made from a **tin**-mercury amalgam. This can be accurately described as a type of \"tin mirror\". The use of these mercury-based mirrors has indeed ceased due to toxicity. This also fits perfectly.\n\nBoth clues are satisfied by the term \"Tin Mirror\".\n\n<<<Tin Mirror>>>"
