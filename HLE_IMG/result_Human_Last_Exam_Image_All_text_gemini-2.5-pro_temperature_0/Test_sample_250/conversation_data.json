    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the jazz standard:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Key and Time Signature**\n*   The key signature has four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭). This indicates the key is either A♭ major or its relative minor, F minor.\n*   The time signature is common time (4/4), as indicated by the \"C\" symbol.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chord Progression**\n*   The piece begins and ends on an F minor chord (labeled F-). This confirms the key is F minor.\n*   The first few chords are F- | E-7♭5 | E♭-6 | D♭maj7 G7 |. This is a highly distinctive and recognizable progression in the jazz repertoire.\n*   The B section (starting in the third system) begins with a D-7♭5 chord, which is also a key feature of this tune's structure.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Melody**\n*   Let's transcribe the first few notes of the melody in the key of F minor:\n    *   Measure 1: The notes are C, G, F. (The 5th, 2nd, and root of the F minor scale).\n    *   Measure 2: The notes are E♭, C, B♭.\n    *   Measure 3: The notes are A♭, F, E♭.\n*   This melodic contour, combined with the underlying harmony, is very specific.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Identify the Tune**\n*   The combination of the key (F minor), the unique opening chord progression (F- to E-7♭5), and the specific melodic phrase strongly points to the jazz standard **\"Nica's Dream\"**.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Composer**\n*   \"Nica's Dream\" is a famous composition by the influential hard bop jazz pianist and composer **Horace Silver**. It was first recorded on his 1956 album *Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers*.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Pay close attention to the key signature and the first chord to establish the tonality.\n*   Recognize that handwritten chord symbols like \"F-\" mean F minor. \"E-7♭5\" means E half-diminished seventh.\n*   The combination of both melody and harmony is the most reliable way to identify a tune, as one without the other can sometimes be ambiguous.\n*   The structure, including the first and second endings, is a clue to the form of the piece (in this case, the A section of an AABA form).\n\nBased on this analysis, the title of the piece is \"Nica's Dream\" and the composer is Horace Silver.\n\n<<<Title: Nica's Dream, Composer: Horace Silver>>>"
