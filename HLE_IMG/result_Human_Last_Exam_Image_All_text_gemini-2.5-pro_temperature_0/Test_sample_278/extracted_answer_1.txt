The image displays a fungal infection, specifically showing the characteristic morphology of **Candida species**. The key features observed are **budding yeast cells** (small, oval structures) and **pseudohyphae** (chains of elongated yeast cells with constrictions at the septa), which are stained magenta by a PAS stain against a blue-green tissue background.
