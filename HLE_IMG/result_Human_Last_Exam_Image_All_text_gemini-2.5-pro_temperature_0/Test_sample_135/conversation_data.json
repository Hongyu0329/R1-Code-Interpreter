    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the artwork.**\n*   **Medium and Style:** The artwork is a relief sculpture, likely made of glazed terracotta. This is indicated by the smooth, slightly glossy surfaces and the characteristic modeling of the figures. The style is typical of the Italian Renaissance, specifically the Florentine school, known for its classical harmony, graceful figures, and pious expressions.\n*   **Composition:** The scene is enclosed in a circular frame (a tondo or roundel), which is itself part of a larger, ornate structure, suggesting it's a detail from an altarpiece. The frame is decorated with a classic egg-and-dart motif and surrounded by foliate patterns.\n*   **Subject Matter:** The relief depicts a religious ceremony. A priest, standing at an altar on the left, is giving a communion wafer to a kneeling figure. Other figures, including a child and several adults, are also kneeling in prayer, waiting to receive the sacrament. This scene represents the Eucharist or Holy Communion.\n*   **Inscription:** At the bottom of the roundel, there is a cartouche with the inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This can be interpreted as \"Sacrament of the Altar\" (a mix of Latin \"Sacramenti\" and Old French/Italian \"de l'autel\"), explicitly identifying the subject.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the visual evidence to art history.**\n*   The use of glazed terracotta relief for religious subjects was a specialty of the Della Robbia family workshop in 15th and early 16th-century Florence. Luca della Robbia pioneered the technique, and his nephew, Andrea della Robbia, continued and expanded the workshop's production.\n*   The style of the figures—their gentle piety, the soft drapery, and the clear, ordered composition—is highly characteristic of Andrea della Robbia's work.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific artwork and its author.**\n*   Based on the style and subject, a search for \"Della Robbia altarpiece Eucharist\" or \"Sacrament of the Altar\" is likely to yield results.\n*   This specific roundel is a well-known detail from the **Altarpiece of the Sacraments** (Altare dei Sacramenti).\n*   This altarpiece was created by **Andrea della Robbia** and his workshop around 1484-1486.\n*   It is located in the church of Santi Cosma e Damiano al Vivaio in Incisa in Val d'Arno, Italy. The altarpiece features several reliefs depicting the sacraments, with this one representing the Eucharist.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the analysis.**\n*   The artwork is a detail from the Altarpiece of the Sacraments.\n*   The artist responsible for this work is Andrea della Robbia.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
