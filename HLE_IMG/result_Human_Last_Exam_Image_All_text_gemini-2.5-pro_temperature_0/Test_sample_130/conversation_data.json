    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the image**\nThe image provided is an emission spectrum. An emission spectrum is produced when the electrons of an element are excited to higher energy levels and then fall back to lower levels, emitting light at specific, discrete wavelengths. This pattern of emitted light, seen as bright lines, is unique for each element and acts as its \"fingerprint\". The background shows the continuous visible light spectrum (from violet/blue on the left to red on the right) to indicate the approximate wavelengths of the emission lines.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the pattern of the spectral lines**\nLet's examine the prominent lines visible in the spectrum, moving from right to left (from longer to shorter wavelengths):\n*   **Red Region:** There is a single, very bright and distinct line in the red part of the spectrum.\n*   **Cyan (Blue-Green) Region:** There is another clear, bright line in the cyan region.\n*   **Blue/Violet Region:** There are several lines in the blue and violet regions. A key observation is that these lines get progressively closer to each other as they move towards the far-left (shorter wavelength) side.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the observed pattern with known atomic spectra**\nThis specific pattern is one of the most famous and fundamental spectra in physics and chemistry. It corresponds to the **Balmer series** of the hydrogen atom. The Balmer series describes the electron transitions in a hydrogen atom that end at the second energy level (n=2).\n\n*   The prominent red line is the **Hydrogen-alpha (Hα)** line, which occurs at a wavelength of approximately 656.3 nm. This corresponds to an electron falling from the n=3 to the n=2 energy level.\n*   The cyan line is the **Hydrogen-beta (Hβ)** line, at approximately 486.1 nm (electron transition from n=4 to n=2).\n*   The next line in the blue-violet region is the **Hydrogen-gamma (Hγ)** line, at approximately 434.1 nm (electron transition from n=5 to n=2).\n*   The subsequent violet line is the **Hydrogen-delta (Hδ)** line, at approximately 410.2 nm (electron transition from n=6 to n=2).\n\nThe observed pattern in the image—a strong red line, a strong cyan line, and a series of converging lines in the violet—is a perfect match for the visible emission spectrum of hydrogen.\n\n**Step 4: Rule out other common elements**\n*   **Helium:** Has a very bright yellow line, which is absent in the given spectrum.\n*   **Sodium:** Is famous for its very strong doublet (two lines very close together) in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum. This is not seen here.\n*   **Neon:** Has a large number of very bright lines in the red-orange region, which would look much more crowded than the single red line shown.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the characteristic pattern of the emission lines, particularly the prominent red (Hα) and cyan (Hβ) lines and the converging series in the violet, the element is unequivocally identified.\n\n<<<Hydrogen>>>"
