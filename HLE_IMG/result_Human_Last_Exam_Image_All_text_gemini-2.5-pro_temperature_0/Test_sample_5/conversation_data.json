    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to identify the piece:\n\n1.  **Instrumentation and Form:** The music is written for solo piano, indicated by the grand staff (two staves, treble and bass clef, joined by a brace).\n\n2.  **Key Signature and Time Signature:** The key signature has two sharps (F# and C#), which corresponds to the key of D major or its relative, B minor. The opening chords (D major) suggest the piece is in D major. The time signature is 4/4 (common time).\n\n3.  **Tempo and Dynamics:** The tempo is marked as quarter note = 80, which is a moderate pace (Andante/Moderato). The piece exhibits a wide range of dynamics, starting softly (*p*), then suddenly becoming loud (*f*), and later varying between medium-soft (*mp*) and medium-loud (*mf*). This dramatic contrast is a significant clue.\n\n4.  **Melody and Rhythm Analysis:**\n    *   **Measures 1-2:** The piece opens with a simple, descending melodic line in the right hand (A-G-F#-E-D-C#) over block chords in the left hand. The mood is calm and somewhat somber.\n    *   **Measure 3 onwards:** There is an abrupt and dramatic shift in character. The texture becomes dense and virtuosic, with fast, continuous sixteenth notes in both hands. The right hand plays rapid arpeggios, while the left hand plays powerful broken octaves and chords. This creates a feeling of intensity, action, and urgency.\n    *   **Measure 11:** A fast, upward-sweeping run (written out but marked with a *gliss.*-like notation) adds to the virtuosic and flashy character of the piece.\n\n5.  **Style and Context:** The combination of a quiet, melodic introduction followed by a sudden, explosive, and technically demanding section is characteristic of dramatic themes, often found in film or video game scores. The virtuosic piano writing is reminiscent of romantic composers like Liszt but is very common in modern arrangements of epic orchestral pieces.\n\n6.  **Identification:** This specific musical structure and style are hallmarks of \"One-Winged Angel,\" the iconic final boss theme from the video game *Final Fantasy VII*, composed by Nobuo Uematsu. The quiet opening represents the ominous presence of the antagonist, Sephiroth, which then erupts into his powerful and chaotic battle theme. The piano arrangement captures this transition perfectly. The arpeggiated figures and chord progressions from measure 3 onwards are instantly recognizable to fans of the game and its music.\n\n<<<One-Winged Angel from Final Fantasy VII>>>"
