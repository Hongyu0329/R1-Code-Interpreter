    "This is a step-by-step analysis to determine the title and composer of the provided jazz standard.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Key and Time Signature:**\n*   **Key Signature:** The sheet music displays a key signature with four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭). This indicates the key is either A♭ major or F minor.\n*   **Tonic Chord:** The piece begins with an F minor chord (F-) and ends on an F chord (implied F minor or F major resolution), which strongly suggests the key is F minor.\n*   **Time Signature:** A 'C' symbol is present after the key signature, which denotes common time, or 4/4 time.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Melody:**\n*   The piece begins with two pickup eighth notes on C5.\n*   The first full measure lands on an F5, the tonic note of the F minor chord.\n*   The melody then descends chromatically in the subsequent measures: F5 over F-, D5 over Eø7, D♭5 over E♭-6. This descending melodic line is a very distinctive feature.\n*   The melody in the first 8 bars establishes a clear and memorable theme before the piece moves to the bridge.\n\n**3. Analysis of the Harmony (Chord Progression):**\n*   The chord progression in the first section (\"A\" section) is highly characteristic. Let's list the first few chords:\n    *   Measure 1: F- (F minor)\n    *   Measure 2: Eø7 (E half-diminished 7th)\n    *   Measure 3: E♭-6 (E-flat minor 6th)\n    *   Measure 4: D♭maj7 (D-flat major 7th) leading to G7.\n*   This progression features a chromatically descending bass line (F -> E -> E♭ -> D♭). This specific type of progression, known as a line cliché, is the most recognizable harmonic element of this particular song.\n*   The bridge section (starting around the 9th full measure of the piece, after the repeat) begins with a Dø7 chord followed by a G7 chord. This ii-V progression is also a key identifier.\n\n**4. Identification of the Song and Composer:**\n*   Based on the combination of the key (F minor), the distinctive descending melodic line, and the iconic chromatic chord progression (F- | Eø7 | E♭-6 | D♭maj7), the piece can be identified with high confidence.\n*   These elements are the hallmarks of the jazz standard **\"Yesterdays\"**.\n*   The composer of \"Yesterdays\" is **Jerome Kern**, with lyrics by Otto Harbach. The tune was written for the 1933 musical *Roberta*.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe analysis of the melody and, most definitively, the chord progression, confirms that the sheet music is for the jazz standard \"Yesterdays,\" composed by Jerome Kern.\n\n<<<Title: Yesterdays, Composer: Jerome Kern>>>"
