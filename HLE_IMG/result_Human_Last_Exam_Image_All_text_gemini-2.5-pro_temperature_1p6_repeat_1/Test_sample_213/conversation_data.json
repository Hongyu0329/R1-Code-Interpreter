    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the opera from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Instrumentation and Language:** The instrument names are in German (`gr. Fl.` for grosse Flöten/flutes, `Hob.` for Oboe, `engl. Horn` for English Horn, `Fag.` for Fagott/bassoon, `Viol.` for Violine/violin, `Br.` for Bratsche/viola, `Celli` for cellos). Performance instructions are also in German, such as `mit Dämpfer` (with mute), `(die übrigen)` (the others/the rest), and most importantly, `Vorhang` (Curtain). This strongly suggests the opera is from a German-speaking composer.\n\n2.  **Examine the Musical Context:** The marking `1 (Vorhang)` indicates this music is played right at the beginning of a scene, as the curtain rises. The question specifies this is the opening of the second act. The overall musical style is highly chromatic, with complex harmonies and a rich, layered texture, which is characteristic of the late-Romantic period (late 19th century).\n\n3.  **Identify the Key Musical Motif:** The most prominent and recognizable feature is the solo melody played by the `engl. Horn` (English Horn). This haunting, yearning melody over a soft, shimmering string accompaniment is one of the most famous orchestral openings in all of opera.\n\n4.  **Connect the Clues:** A famous opera by a German composer that opens its second act with a significant English Horn solo is Richard Wagner's *Tristan und Isolde*. The music in the score perfectly matches the Prelude to Act II of this opera. The English Horn melody is a key leitmotif (the \"Sehnsuchtsmotiv\" or \"Yearning Motif\") representing Isolde's longing as she waits for Tristan in the castle garden.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the German language, the late-Romantic style, the specific instrumentation, the context as the opening of Act II, and the unmistakable English Horn melody, the opera is definitively identified.\n\n<<<Tristan und Isolde>>>"
