    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each of the nine works.\n\n**Analysis of each artwork:**\n\n1.  **Top-left:** The painting features whimsical, cartoon-like fish with human faces, rendered with simple ink lines and light color washes. This style is the distinct signature of **Feng Zikai (丰子恺)**, a celebrated modern Chinese artist known for pioneering the *manhua* (comic) style and infusing his works with humanism and social commentary.\n\n2.  **Top-center:** This is a traditional Chinese ink wash painting of chrysanthemums. The vigorous, dark brushstrokes for the leaves and rocks contrasting with the carefully drawn flowers, along with the visible signature \"白石\" (Báishí), identifies the artist as **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**, one of the most influential masters of modern Chinese painting.\n\n3.  **Top-right:** This is an ink and color painting on paper depicting a Tibetan woman. The fluid lines, expressive capture of the subject's character, and focus on ethnic minority themes are all hallmarks of the artist **Ye Qianyu (叶浅予)**, a master of Chinese figure painting.\n\n4.  **Middle-left:** This is a section of Chinese calligraphy in a dynamic cursive script. The visible characters (\"菊有黄香\" - \"chrysanthemums have a yellow fragrance\") and the unique, energetic, and slightly slanted brushwork are from the famous \"Shu Su Tie\" (蜀素帖), a masterpiece by the Song dynasty calligrapher **Mi Fu (米芾)**.\n\n5.  **Middle-center:** This is a modern painting blending abstract and traditional elements. The prominent use of large circles representing the sun and moon above a stylized ink landscape is a defining motif of **Liu Kuo-sung (刘国松)**, a major figure in the modernist movement of Chinese art who pioneered new techniques and styles.\n\n6.  **Middle-right:** This calligraphy is written in the \"Shou Jin Ti\" (瘦金体 - Slender Gold Style). This style is exceptionally unique, characterized by its thin, wiry, and sharp strokes, and it was invented and exclusively used by **Emperor Huizong of Song (宋徽宗)**, who was a gifted artist and calligrapher.\n\n7.  **Bottom-left:** This is a famous example of cursive script calligraphy, known for its raw emotional intensity, evident in the revisions and rushed brushwork. It is a detail from the \"Draft of a Requiem for My Nephew\" (祭姪文稿), written by the great Tang dynasty official and calligrapher **Yan Zhenqing (颜真卿)** in a state of grief.\n\n8.  **Bottom-center:** This is a realist oil portrait of a young woman with a contemplative expression. The meticulous rendering of light and shadow, combined with a romantic and nostalgic atmosphere, is the signature style of **Chen Yifei (陈逸飞)**, a leading figure in Chinese contemporary art known for his \"Romantic Realism\".\n\n9.  **Bottom-right:** This painting depicts a young woman in ethnic dress, likely a Kirghiz girl. The style, characterized by exaggeratedly fluid and calligraphic lines and a unique approach to figural composition, is the unmistakable work of **Cheng Shifa (程十发)**, a renowned modern artist celebrated for his figure paintings and illustrations.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the authors of the nine works, from left to right and top to bottom, are:\n\n1.  Feng Zikai\n2.  Qi Baishi\n3.  Ye Qianyu\n4.  Mi Fu\n5.  Liu Kuo-sung\n6.  Emperor Huizong of Song\n7.  Yan Zhenqing\n8.  Chen Yifei\n9.  Cheng Shifa\n\n<<<Feng Zikai, Qi Baishi, Ye Qianyu, Mi Fu, Liu Kuo-sung, Emperor Huizong of Song, Yan Zhenqing, Chen Yifei, Cheng Shifa>>>"
