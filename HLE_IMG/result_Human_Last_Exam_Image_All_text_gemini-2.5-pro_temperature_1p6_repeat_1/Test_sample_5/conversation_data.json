    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observations:** The sheet music is written for piano, indicated by the grand staff (treble and bass clefs joined by a brace). The tempo is marked at quarter note = 80. The key signature has three sharps (F♯, C♯, G♯), which corresponds to A major or F♯ minor.\n2.  **Analyzing the Sections:**\n    *   **Measures 1-2:** The piece begins quietly (*p* - piano) with a simple melodic line in the right hand over broken octaves in the left hand. The harmony is centered around an A major chord, confirming A major as the likely key for this section.\n    *   **Measure 3:** There is a sudden and dramatic shift in dynamics to *f* (forte) and texture. Both hands play powerful, blocky chords, creating a sense of urgency and power.\n    *   **Measures 4-7:** The dynamic shifts to *mp* (mezzo-piano). The right hand plays repeated chords while the left hand has a descending chromatic bassline. This creates rising tension.\n    *   **Measures 8-10:** The dynamic increases to *mf* (mezzo-forte). This section features a powerful, driving, and highly rhythmic chordal progression. Let's analyze the chords:\n        *   Measure 8: F♯ minor, then C♯ minor.\n        *   Measure 9: D major, then A major.\n    *   **Measures 11-13:** This section features fast arpeggios and runs, indicating a virtuosic and climactic passage.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Piece:**\n    *   The style is highly dramatic, epic, and cinematic, with rapid changes in dynamics and texture. This is very characteristic of modern video game music, especially battle themes.\n    *   The chord progression identified in measures 8-9 (F♯m – C♯m – D – A) is extremely distinctive. This progression is the core of the main theme of \"One-Winged Angel,\" the final boss theme from the video game *Final Fantasy VII*, composed by Nobuo Uematsu.\n    *   Comparing the entire excerpt to piano arrangements of \"One-Winged Angel\" confirms the match. The quiet introduction, the sudden loud chords, the section with the chromatic bass, and the iconic main theme progression are all present in the correct order.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the distinctive chord progression, dramatic style, and overall structure, the music is a piano arrangement of \"One-Winged Angel\" from *Final Fantasy VII*.\n\n<<<One-Winged Angel>>>"
