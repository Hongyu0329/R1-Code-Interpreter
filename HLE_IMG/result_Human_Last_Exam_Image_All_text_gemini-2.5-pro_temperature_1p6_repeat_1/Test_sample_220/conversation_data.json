    "*   **Step 1: Understand the Crystal Structure and Viewing Direction.**\n    *   The question asks to identify the projection of a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal structure when viewed along the [110] direction.\n    *   An FCC unit cell has atoms at the 8 corners of a cube and at the center of its 6 faces.\n    *   The viewing direction [110] means we are looking along the vector that goes from the origin (0,0,0) to the point (a, a, 0), where 'a' is the lattice constant. This is equivalent to projecting the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to the [110] vector.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determine the Theoretical Projection Pattern.**\n    *   When viewing an FCC crystal along the [110] direction, the atoms will be seen to lie on planes perpendicular to this direction.\n    *   These atomic planes are stacked in an alternating sequence (let's call them A and B).\n    *   The atoms on plane A, when projected, form a rectangular grid. The sides of the fundamental rectangle of this grid are oriented along the [001] and [1 -1 0] crystal directions. The side lengths are 'a' and 'a√2', respectively. So the aspect ratio of this rectangle is √2 : 1 ≈ 1.414 : 1.\n    *   The atoms on plane B are positioned such that when projected, they appear exactly in the center of the rectangles formed by the atoms of plane A.\n    *   Therefore, the combined projection of both planes A and B results in a **centered rectangular pattern**. We should look for an image that shows atoms at the corners of a rectangle and another atom at its center.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the Given Images.**\n    *   **Image A:** This image shows a rectangular pattern. If we consider a rectangle formed by four atoms, the other atoms are located at the center of the shorter sides of the rectangle, not at the center of the rectangle's face. This pattern is characteristic of a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n    *   **Image B:** This image shows atoms at the corners of a rectangle (which appears to be a square) and an atom in the very center of the rectangle's face. This pattern is characteristic of an FCC lattice viewed along the [100] direction (i.e., looking straight at one of the cube's faces).\n    *   **Image C:** This pattern consists of two offset rectangular grids of atoms. It does not show a centered rectangular arrangement. It resembles a projection of a simple cubic lattice.\n    *   **Image D:** This image clearly shows a centered rectangular pattern. We can identify rectangles formed by four atoms (e.g., at the corners), with another atom situated in the middle of each rectangle. Let's check the aspect ratio from the plot. A representative rectangle can be identified with a width of approximately (4.5 - 0.5) = 4 units and a height of approximately (12.5 - 6.5) = 6 units. The aspect ratio is 6/4 = 1.5. This value is very close to the theoretical ratio of √2 ≈ 1.414.\n\n*   **Step 4: Final Conclusion.**\n    *   Based on the analysis, Image D is the only one that displays the centered rectangular pattern with the correct approximate aspect ratio expected for an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
