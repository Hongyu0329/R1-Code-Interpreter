    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the ECG Paper Settings:** The settings are provided at the top left of the ECG: \"25 mm/sec; 1 cm/mV\".\n    *   The crucial piece of information for measuring time intervals is the paper speed: **25 mm/sec**.\n    *   The ECG grid is composed of small squares (1 mm x 1 mm) and large squares (5 mm x 5 mm).\n    *   We can calculate the time represented by each square:\n        *   Time for one small square (1 mm) = 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = **0.04 seconds**.\n        *   Time for one large square (5 mm) = 5 mm / 25 mm/sec = **0.20 seconds**.\n\n2.  **Identify the Longest R-R Interval:** The R-R interval is the time between two consecutive R-waves (the highest sharp peaks of the QRS complex). By visually inspecting the entire rhythm strip, we can see that the rhythm is mostly regular, but there is one significant pause. This pause is located in the fourth strip from the top, between the third and fourth QRS complexes on that line. This is clearly the longest R-R interval on the tracing.\n\n3.  **Measure the Duration of the Longest Interval:** To measure the duration, we count the number of squares between the peaks of the two R-waves that define this interval.\n    *   Let's use the R-wave peak before the pause as our starting point. This peak falls conveniently almost exactly on a thick vertical grid line.\n    *   Now, we count the number of large squares (which are easier to count for long intervals) to the peak of the next R-wave.\n    *   Counting the full large squares between the two R-wave peaks, we find there are **8 complete large squares**.\n    *   After the 8th large square, there is a small remaining distance to the peak of the second R-wave. This remaining distance covers approximately **3 small squares**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Time in Seconds:** Now, we convert our measurement in squares to time.\n    *   Duration from the large squares: 8 large squares × 0.20 seconds/large square = **1.60 seconds**.\n    *   Duration from the small squares: 3 small squares × 0.04 seconds/small square = **0.12 seconds**.\n    *   Total duration = 1.60 seconds + 0.12 seconds = **1.72 seconds**.\n\n    *   *Alternative Calculation using only small squares:*\n        *   Total number of small squares = (8 large squares × 5 small squares/large square) + 3 small squares = 40 + 3 = 43 small squares.\n        *   Total time = 43 small squares × 0.04 seconds/small square = **1.72 seconds**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Always confirm the paper speed before making any time-based measurements on an ECG.\n*   Be precise when identifying the peak of the R-wave.\n*   When measuring, it is often helpful to start from an R-wave that aligns with a grid line to simplify counting.\n*   Visually scan the entire strip to ensure you have truly found the longest interval and not just a local variation. In this case, the long pause is very prominent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe longest R-R interval, corresponding to the pause in the rhythm, is measured to be approximately 1.72 seconds.\n\n<<<1.72>>>"
