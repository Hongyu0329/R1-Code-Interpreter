    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the provided information.**\nThe request asks to analyze the molecules shown in the image and determine their isomeric relationship. The image provided is a completely black rectangle. There are no molecules or chemical structures depicted in the image.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the question and the options.**\nThe question is \"Which type of isomers are the molecules mentioned above?\". This requires comparing at least two molecular structures.\nLet's define the given options:\n*   **(a) Conformers (conformational isomers):** These are isomers that have the same molecular formula and the same connectivity but differ in their spatial arrangement due to rotation about single bonds (e.g., staggered vs. eclipsed ethane). They are generally interconvertible at room temperature.\n*   **(b) Constitutional isomers (or structural isomers):** These are isomers that have the same molecular formula but a different connectivity (i.e., the atoms are bonded in a different order).\n*   **(c) Identical:** The structures shown represent the same molecule. They are superimposable on each other.\n*   **(d) Stereoisomers:** These are isomers that have the same molecular formula and the same connectivity but differ in the 3D arrangement of their atoms in space. This is a broad category that includes enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images) and diastereomers (stereoisomers that are not mirror images). Conformers are sometimes considered a subclass of stereoisomers.\n*   **(e) None of these:** This option should be chosen if the molecules do not fit any of the above relationships, or if the question is unanswerable from the given information.\n\n**Step 3: Attempt to perform the comparison.**\nTo determine the relationship between the molecules, we would typically follow these steps:\n1.  Determine the molecular formula for each molecule.\n2.  Compare their atomic connectivity.\n3.  If connectivity is the same, compare their 3D spatial arrangement and check for superimposability.\n\n**Careful Points & Analysis:**\n*   The primary and most critical point is that the image is blank.\n*   Because the image is blank, there are no \"molecules mentioned above\" to analyze.\n*   Without the molecular structures, it is impossible to determine their molecular formulas, their connectivity, or their spatial arrangements.\n*   Therefore, we cannot determine if they are identical, conformers, constitutional isomers, or stereoisomers.\n\n**Step 4: Reach a conclusion.**\nSince none of the specific relationships described in options (a), (b), (c), or (d) can be established due to the lack of information, the question cannot be answered as intended. In the context of a multiple-choice question, the most logical choice is the one that accounts for this situation. Option (e), \"None of these,\" is the most appropriate answer because no specific isomeric relationship can be identified. The condition for any of the other options to be correct is not met.\n\n<<<E>>>"
