    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\n*   **Clue:** \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   **Image Analysis:** The black-and-white image shows two men in suits at an awards ceremony. The younger man with a beard is receiving a trophy from an older man with white hair.\n*   **Identification:** The man receiving the award is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov, a Russian professional ice hockey player. The man presenting the award is Gary Bettman, the commissioner of the National Hockey League (NHL).\n*   **Event:** A search for \"Nikita Kucherov June 20 2019\" confirms that this is the 2019 NHL Awards ceremony, where he won multiple major awards, including the Hart Memorial Trophy for Most Valuable Player.\n*   **Initial Thought:** \"X Y\" could be Nikita Kucherov or Hart Trophy. However, the second clue suggests a more generic term with a double meaning. The image shows a hockey player. A signature achievement in hockey is a \"hat trick\" (scoring three goals in one game).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   **Clue:** \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   **Scientific/Historical Connection:** This points to a historical industrial process involving mercury. The most famous example is the use of mercuric nitrate in the process of \"carroting,\" which turned animal fur into felt for making hats. This process caused neurological damage (mercury poisoning) in hat makers, leading to the phrase \"mad as a hatter.\" This practice is now obsolete due to the toxicity.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the two clues with the term \"X Y\".**\n*   The first clue points to a star hockey player, Nikita Kucherov, whose accomplishments include scoring numerous \"hat tricks.\" The tradition of the \"hat trick\" is said to have originated from the custom of awarding a player a new hat for the achievement. Fans today still throw hats onto the ice to celebrate.\n*   The second clue points to the historical process of making felt hats using mercury.\n*   The connecting term \"X Y\" that fits both clues is **Felt Hat**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the solution.**\n*   **\"Felt Hat is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"** This is a metaphorical statement. A felt hat is not literally in the picture, but the *concept* of a hat trick, and its historical prize of a hat, is embodied by the star player being awarded for his high-scoring season.\n*   **\"Another Felt hat has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"** This statement is factual. It refers to the specific *type* of felt hat that was made using the dangerous mercury-based process, which is no longer in common use.\n\nThe two parts of the clue are successfully bridged by the term \"Felt Hat,\" linking the world of ice hockey to the history of industrial chemistry.\n\n<<<Felt Hat>>>"
