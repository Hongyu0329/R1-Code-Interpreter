    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the rock specimens to identify them.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Specimen H**\n*   **Observation:** This specimen is reddish-brown in color. Its most prominent feature is the high number of visible pores or holes, known as vesicles. The texture is fine-grained, meaning individual mineral crystals are not visible to the naked eye.\n*   **Interpretation:** The vesicular texture indicates that gas was trapped within molten rock (magma or lava) as it cooled and solidified. This rapid cooling process, preventing the formation of large crystals, is characteristic of an extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock. The color and high vesicularity are typical of scoria.\n*   **Identification:** **Scoria**\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Specimen I**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is composed of numerous fragments, or clasts, of various sizes, shapes, and colors (including grey, white, and red). These clasts are sharp and angular, not rounded. They are cemented together by a fine-grained matrix.\n*   **Interpretation:** A rock made of cemented fragments is a clastic rock. Because the fragments are angular and larger than 2 mm, the rock is classified as a breccia. The angularity suggests the fragments were not transported far from their source before being cemented. If the fragments are from a volcanic eruption, it could be a volcanic breccia.\n*   **Identification:** **Breccia**\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Specimen J**\n*   **Observation:** This specimen is very light in color (white to light grey). Like specimen H, it is highly vesicular, containing many small holes, giving it a frothy or spongy appearance. It appears to be very lightweight. Individual crystals are not visible.\n*   **Interpretation:** This is another extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock that cooled rapidly. Its light color indicates a felsic composition (rich in silica). A light-colored, highly vesicular volcanic rock is known as pumice. It is so porous that it can often float in water.\n*   **Identification:** **Pumice**\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Specimen K**\n*   **Observation:** This specimen is composed of large, interlocking mineral crystals that are clearly visible. The texture is coarse-grained (phaneritic). There are multiple minerals present: glassy grey crystals (likely quartz), blocky white to pinkish crystals (likely feldspar), and smaller dark crystals (likely biotite mica or hornblende).\n*   **Interpretation:** The coarse-grained texture indicates that the rock cooled very slowly, deep beneath the Earth's surface. This is characteristic of an intrusive igneous rock. The specific mineral combination of quartz and feldspar, along with minor dark minerals, is the defining composition of granite.\n*   **Identification:** **Granite**\n\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria (an extrusive igneous rock)\n*   **I:** Breccia (a clastic sedimentary or pyroclastic rock)\n*   **J:** Pumice (an extrusive igneous rock)\n*   **K:** Granite (an intrusive igneous rock)\n\n<<<H is Scoria, I is Breccia, J is Pumice, and K is Granite.>>>"
