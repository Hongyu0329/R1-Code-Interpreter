    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Image Subject**\nThe image focuses on a small insect positioned in the center. The insect is resting on a cluster of small, bright yellow flowers. The background is a soft-focus green and yellow, suggesting a natural outdoor setting with more of the same type of plant.\n\n**Step 2: Observe the Insect's Characteristics**\nA detailed look at the insect reveals several key features for identification:\n*   **Order:** It has six legs, a pair of antennae, and a segmented body, classifying it as an insect. The presence of a proboscis (beak-like mouthpart, though not clearly visible) and partially hardened forewings (hemelytra) suggests it belongs to the order Hemiptera, the \"true bugs\".\n*   **Coloration:** The insect has a very distinct color pattern. The head is black. The pronotum (the section behind the head) is black with a bright orange or reddish-orange border. The main part of the wings (hemelytra) is also a similar shade of orange, with some black markings. The legs and antennae are black.\n*   **Shape:** It has an oval to slightly elongated body shape, typical of many plant bugs or seed bugs.\n*   **Size:** While not scalable from the image, it appears to be a relatively small bug, likely under a centimeter in length.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Plant**\nThe plant the insect is on has dense inflorescences of tiny, bright yellow, star-like flowers. This morphology is characteristic of goldenrod (genus *Solidago*), a common late summer and fall blooming wildflower in North America. The common name of an insect is often related to its host plant, which can be a valuable clue.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Clues for Identification**\nWe are looking for a true bug (Hemiptera) with a specific black-and-orange pattern, found on a goldenrod plant.\n*   The common name \"Goldenrod Plant Bug\" immediately comes to mind due to the host plant.\n*   Searching for this insect confirms its appearance. The Goldenrod Plant Bug has the characteristic black head, orange-bordered pronotum, and orange-and-black wings seen in the photograph.\n*   This allows us to discard other similarly colored bugs like boxelder bugs or milkweed bugs, which have different marking patterns and are typically associated with different host plants.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Scientific Name**\nThe common name \"Goldenrod Plant Bug\" corresponds to the scientific name *Lopidea media*. This species belongs to the family Miridae, known as plant bugs.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the distinct coloration (black head, orange-bordered pronotum, orange wings) and the host plant (goldenrod), the insect in the image is definitively identified as a Goldenrod Plant Bug, whose scientific name is *Lopidea media*.\n\n<<<Lopidea media>>>"
