    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the erasure poem to determine its metric pattern:\n\n1.  **Identify the Textual Components:** An erasure poem or collage poem often incorporates elements from the source page beyond the words explicitly selected or isolated. In this image, we have several textual components:\n    *   The title from the source page: \"THE FIRST STEP\"\n    *   The page number from the source page: \"35\"\n    *   The cutout words that form the body of the poem: \"rules\", \"and\", \"lines,\", \"an intricate spider's web\", \"work\".\n\n2.  **Assemble the Full Poem:** To analyze the overall pattern, we should consider all these elements as part of the intended poetic work. A plausible reading combines these elements into a single statement or sentence: \"The first step thirty-five rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work.\"\n\n3.  **Count the Syllables:** The next step is to perform a careful syllable count of this complete text.\n    *   \"The first step\" = The (1) + first (1) + step (1) = 3 syllables.\n    *   \"thirty-five\" (how \"35\" is typically spoken) = thir- (1) + -ty (1) + five (1) = 3 syllables.\n    *   \"rules\" = 1 syllable.\n    *   \"and\" = 1 syllable.\n    *   \"lines,\" = 1 syllable.\n    *   \"an\" = 1 syllable.\n    *   \"intricate\" = in- (1) + -tri- (1) + -cate (1) = 3 syllables.\n    *   \"spider's\" = spi- (1) + -der's (1) = 2 syllables.\n    *   \"web\" = 1 syllable.\n    *   \"work\" = 1 syllable.\n\n    Adding these up: 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 17 syllables.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:** Now, let's examine the provided options in light of our 17-syllable count.\n    *   **A. free verse:** This is a general term for poetry without a consistent meter or rhyme scheme. While the poem doesn't have a repeating metrical foot, the very specific syllable count points to a more precise form.\n    *   **B. iambic pentameter:** This form requires 10 syllables per line in an unstressed-stressed pattern. Our poem has 17 syllables, so this is incorrect.\n    *   **C. alexandrine:** This is a line of 12 syllables. Our poem has 17, so this is incorrect.\n    *   **D. sapphic:** This is a complex stanzaic form with specific metrical patterns and line lengths (11, 11, 11, 5 syllables). This does not match our single-sentence poem.\n    *   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** This form involves lines of approximately 6 syllables (three iambic feet). This does not match.\n    *   **F. american sentence:** This is a poetic form developed by Allen Ginsberg, defined as a single sentence composed of exactly 17 syllables. Our analysis shows the poem fits this definition perfectly.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The total syllable count of all textual elements on the page is exactly 17. This precise count makes \"American sentence\" the most accurate and specific description of the poem's metric pattern (where the \"pattern\" is the fixed syllable count for the entire sentence). The inclusion of this specific form as an answer choice strongly suggests that this careful, holistic reading of the artwork is intended.\n\n<<<F>>>"
