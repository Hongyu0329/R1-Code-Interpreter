    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction:** The reaction shown is the acid-catalyzed dehydration of a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol. The conditions (catalytic HCl, 110 °C) and the formation of water indicate an E1 elimination mechanism, which proceeds through a carbocation intermediate.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Product:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** The skeleton is that of Friedelan-3β-ol. This is a highly strained, relatively linear polycyclic system. Key substituents for the rearrangement are the methyl groups (CH3) and hydrogens (H) at the ring junctions.\n    *   **Product:** The skeleton is that of Olean-12-ene (also known as δ-amyrin). This is a less-strained, more stable \"bent\" structure. The double bond is tetrasubstituted, which is thermodynamically very favorable.\n    *   The question explicitly states that the transformation involves a series of [1,2] shifts. This confirms that a major carbocation rearrangement, specifically a Wagner-Meerwein \"backbone rearrangement,\" has occurred.\n\n3.  **The Wagner-Meerwein Rearrangement Cascade (The \"Zipper\" Reaction):**\n    This rearrangement is driven by the release of strain energy in converting the friedelane skeleton to the more stable oleanane skeleton. It proceeds through a cascade of sequential [1,2]-hydride and [1,2]-methyl shifts.\n\n    *   **Initiation:** The reaction starts with the protonation of the hydroxyl group (-OH) at C-3 by the acid catalyst, followed by the loss of a water molecule (H₂O) to form a secondary carbocation at C-3.\n\n    *   **The Paradox:** A standard backbone rearrangement begins with a [1,2]-methyl shift from the adjacent C-4 to the C-3 cation. This would break up the gem-dimethyl group at C-4 (it would become C(H)(CH₃)). However, the product is drawn with the gem-dimethyl group at C-4 intact. This is a common simplification or error in textbook diagrams. To solve the problem, we must assume the well-established backbone rearrangement occurs and that the drawing is flawed in this one respect, or that position 1 is unchanged for other reasons. We will proceed by trusting the established mechanism to determine the fate of the other groups.\n\n4.  **Tracing the Substituents through the Cascade:**\n    We will track the movement of the original hydrogen and methyl groups to determine what substituent ends up at each numbered position in the final oleanane product. The numbered positions in the product correspond to these carbons in the standard oleanane numbering:\n    *   Position 1: C-4 (part of the gem-dimethyl group)\n    *   Position 2: C-10\n    *   Position 3: C-8\n    *   Position 4: C-14\n    *   Position 5: C-17\n\n    Let's follow the cascade and see which original group occupies these positions in the final product:\n    *   **Cation formation at C-3.**\n    *   **Cascade begins:** The shifts proceed across the molecular backbone: C-3 → C-4 → C-5 → C-10 → C-9 → C-8 → C-14 → C-13.\n    *   **Position 2 (C-10):** The cascade moves the positive charge to C-10. This \"hole\" is filled by a [1,2]-hydride shift from the original C-9. Therefore, the group that ends up at position C-10 is the **hydrogen** from C-9.\n    *   **Position 3 (C-8):** The cascade continues, and the positive charge moves to C-8. This \"hole\" is then filled by a migrating group from C-14. In the Friedelane starting material, C-14 has a methyl group and C-8 has a methyl group. The most accepted mechanism to form the Oleanane skeleton involves the **hydrogen** that was on the original C-14 migrating to C-8. Therefore, the group at position C-8 is **H**.\n    *   **Position 4 (C-14):** After the C-14 hydrogen has moved to C-8, C-14 is left with its original methyl group and becomes a carbocation. This cation is then neutralized by a hydride shift from C-13. Therefore, C-14 retains its original **methyl group**.\n    *   **Position 5 (C-17):** The cascade of shifts happens along the A/B/C/D ring backbone. The C-17 position and its methyl group are not involved in this rearrangement pathway. Thus, it remains unchanged. The group at position 5 is a **methyl group**.\n    *   **Position 1 (C-4):** As discussed, the standard mechanism involves breaking up this group. However, since the product is drawn with an intact gem-dimethyl group, we take this feature from the drawing as a given for the final structure. The group at position 1 is a **methyl group**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the step-by-step analysis of the established rearrangement mechanism:\n    *   1 = **CH3** (from the product drawing/unchanged side)\n    *   2 = **H** (originally from C-9)\n    *   3 = **H** (originally from C-14)\n    *   4 = **CH3** (original C-14 methyl group is retained)\n    *   5 = **CH3** (uninvolved in the rearrangement)\n\nLet me re-evaluate step 4, the occupant of C-8 and C-14, as this is a key divergence point in literature.\nLet's consider an alternative migration from C8(+). If the Me from C-14 migrates to C-8, then C-8 gets a CH3. Then C-14 is left as a cation, and gets an H from C-13.\nIn this case:\n*   Pos 3 (C8) = CH3\n*   Pos 4 (C14) = H\nThis would swap the answers for 3 and 4.\nHowever, careful analysis of the stereochemistry and strain relief strongly favors the path where H migrates from C-14 to C-8. So, the first analysis is more likely correct.\nLet's review again: Cation at C8. H from C14 migrates to C8. So C8 gets H. Position 3 = H. C14 is now a cation, and has lost its H. It still has its original methyl. H from C13 migrates to C14. So C14 ends up with its original methyl, and a new hydrogen from C13. So C14 has a methyl group. Position 4 = CH3. This seems consistent.\n\nFinal check of assignments:\n*   Position 1: CH3 (from drawing)\n*   Position 2: H (gets H from C9)\n*   Position 3: H (gets H from C14)\n*   Position 4: CH3 (keeps original Me)\n*   Position 5: CH3 (unaffected)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is assembled from these deductions.\n\n**Final Answer Derivations:**\n1 = **CH3**\n2 = **H**\n3 = **H**\n4 = **CH3**\n5 = **CH3**\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = CH3>>>"
