    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Concept of Rotational Symmetry**\nRotational symmetry means that a pattern or object looks the same after being rotated by a certain angle around a central point. The \"order\" of rotational symmetry is the number of times the pattern matches its original orientation in a full 360-degree rotation. For periodic tilings like this one, we look for the highest order of rotational symmetry present anywhere in the pattern. According to the crystallographic restriction theorem, periodic tilings can only have 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6-fold rotational symmetries.\n\n**Step 2: Visually Inspect the Tiling for Potential Centers of Rotation**\nThe tiling is composed of three types of colored shapes: dark blue hexagons, light yellow squares, and orange rhombuses. We can test for rotational symmetry by choosing a point in the pattern and mentally rotating the entire image around it. Good candidate points are the centers of the tiles or the vertices where tiles meet.\n\n**Step 3: Test for 6-fold Symmetry**\n*   **Choose a center:** Let's select the center of one of the dark blue hexagons. These hexagons act as hubs for star-like patterns.\n*   **Perform a rotation:** Imagine rotating the entire pattern by 360/6 = 60 degrees around this point.\n*   **Analyze the result:**\n    *   The central blue hexagon rotates onto itself.\n    *   Each of the six yellow squares surrounding the central hexagon moves into the exact position of the next square.\n    *   Each of the six orange rhombuses that are part of the star pattern moves into the position of the next rhombus.\n    *   The entire surrounding pattern of other hexagons, squares, and rhombuses also aligns perfectly with its new position.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the pattern is unchanged after a 60-degree rotation, it will also be unchanged after rotations of 120, 180, 240, and 300 degrees. This means the pattern matches itself 6 times in a full 360-degree rotation. Therefore, there are centers of **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n**Step 4: Test for Other Symmetries (for confirmation)**\n*   **4-fold Symmetry:** Let's choose the center of a light yellow square. If we rotate the pattern by 360/4 = 90 degrees around this point, the square rotates onto itself, and each of the four adjacent blue hexagons moves into the position of the next one. The pattern is invariant, so there are also centers of **4-fold rotational symmetry**.\n*   **2-fold Symmetry:** Let's choose the center of an orange rhombus. Rotating by 360/2 = 180 degrees maps the rhombus onto itself and swaps the positions of the larger pattern elements around it. The tiling has centers of **2-fold rotational symmetry**.\n*   **3-fold Symmetry:** A pattern with 6-fold symmetry must also contain points of 3-fold symmetry (since a rotation of 120 degrees is two 60-degree rotations). These points exist within the pattern as well.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Overall Rotational Symmetry of the Tiling**\nThe question asks for \"the\" rotational symmetry of the tiling. In this context, it refers to the highest order of rotational symmetry found within the pattern. We have identified centers of 2-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold symmetry. The highest of these is 6-fold.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe tiling has points of 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
