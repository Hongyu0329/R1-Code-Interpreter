    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and image to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements.**\nThe image consists of two graphs, both plotting some property of a sound over time (the horizontal axis).\n*   **Top Graph (Spectrogram):** This graph shows frequency content over time. There is a persistent horizontal band, which represents a pure tone of a constant frequency. In the middle of the graph, this band is interrupted. Simultaneously with the interruption, there is a vertical smear covering a wide range of frequencies, which represents a short burst of noise.\n*   **Bottom Graph (Waveform):** This graph shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time. On the left, it shows a smooth, regular sine wave, corresponding to the pure tone. In the middle, the waveform becomes irregular and chaotic, corresponding to the noise burst. On the right, the smooth sine wave resumes.\n*   **Conclusion from Visuals:** The image graphically represents a pure tone that is stopped, replaced by a short burst of noise, and then started again.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the textual description.**\nThe text provides several critical clues about the nature of the phenomenon:\n*   **\"Illusion\":** This tells us that what is perceived is different from the physical reality depicted in the graphs.\n*   **\"Similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity\":** The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where a 2D line drawing can be perceived as a 3D cube in two different orientations. The brain flips between these two stable perceptions. This analogy suggests that the auditory illusion in question involves the brain choosing a single, stable interpretation from ambiguous or incomplete sensory input. In this case, the input is \"tone-noise-tone.\"\n*   **\"Reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\":** This indicates that our brain performs this \"trick\" automatically and frequently without our awareness. The ability is to create a seamless perceptual experience from a broken or noisy signal.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the visual and textual information.**\nPutting everything together, the scenario is as follows:\n*   **Physical Stimulus:** A continuous tone is interrupted by a loud burst of noise.\n*   **Perceptual Illusion:** When a listener hears this, their brain does not perceive a gap in the tone. Instead, it perceives the tone as continuing uninterrupted *behind* the noise. The brain effectively \"fills in\" the missing part of the tone.\n*   **Connection to Clues:** This \"filling-in\" is the \"unconscious perceptual ability.\" It resolves the ambiguity of the \"tone-noise-tone\" signal into a more coherent story of \"a continuous tone that was temporarily masked by noise.\" This is analogous to how the brain resolves the Necker Cube's ambiguity into one of two stable 3D shapes.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the name of the phenomenon.**\nThis well-documented auditory illusion is a form of perceptual restoration. There are a few specific names for it:\n*   The general principle is called the **Perceptual Restoration Effect**.\n*   When applied to non-speech sounds like the pure tone shown, it is most accurately called the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**.\n*   The most famous and earliest described version of this effect involves restoring missing speech sounds (phonemes), and it is called the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**. For example, if someone hears the sentence \"The governors met with their legi*latures,\" where the \"s\" sound is replaced by a cough, they will typically perceive the word \"legislatures\" intact, believing the cough merely overlapped with the speech.\n\nGiven that the Phonemic Restoration Effect is the most famous and foundational discovery in this area, and textbook diagrams often use simplified tones to illustrate this general principle, \"Phonemic Restoration Effect\" is the most likely and recognized name for this phenomenon.\n\n<<<Phonemic restoration effect>>>"
