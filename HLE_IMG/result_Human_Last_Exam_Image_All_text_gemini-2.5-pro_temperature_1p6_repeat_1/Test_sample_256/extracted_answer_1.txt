True. In the upper right section of the image, to the right of a solid dark brown figure, there is a red inscription that clearly forms letters from the Latin alphabet, possibly "nU" or a similar combination. The Latin alphabet was introduced by Europeans and is not a symbolic system native to the ancient Southwest cultures that created the surrounding rock art.
