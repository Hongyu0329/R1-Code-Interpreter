**Product A:** The structure is a dihydropyrrolizine formed from the cycloaddition of the münchnone C and methyl propiolate, followed by decarboxylation. The nitrogen of the dihydropyrrolizine is substituted with the 1-(2-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl) group. The dihydropyrrole ring of the core is substituted with a methyl group and a methoxycarbonyl group.

**Product B:** The structure has the same dihydropyrrolizine core and N-substituent as product A. It is formed from A by loss of C2H6, corresponding to the replacement of the ring's methyl group with a hydrogen atom and the hydrolysis of the methoxycarbonyl group to a carboxylic acid group.

**Product C:** The structure is a münchnone (a mesoionic 1,3-dipole). It is a bicyclic system with a pyrrolidine ring fused to a 1,3-oxazolium-5-olate ring. The nitrogen atom is at the bridgehead and is substituted with the 1-(2-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl) group. The oxazolium ring bears a methyl substituent.

Here are the structures represented graphically:
*   **Structure C:** A bicyclo[3.3.0]octane core, consisting of a pyrrolidine ring fused along a N-C bond with a 1,3-oxazolone ring, creating a mesoionic oxazolium-5-olate. The bridgehead nitrogen is bonded to a 1,5-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-one ring at position 5. The oxazolone ring has a methyl group at the position adjacent to the ring oxygen.
*   **Structure A:** A dihydropyrrolizine core (fused pyrrolidine and dihydropyrrole rings). The bridgehead nitrogen is bonded to a 1,5-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-one ring at position 5. The dihydropyrrole ring is substituted by a methyl group and a -COOCH3 group.
*   **Structure B:** The same dihydropyrrolizine core as A, with the same N-substituent. The dihydropyrrole ring is substituted with a hydrogen (in place of A's methyl group) and a -COOH group (in place of A's -COOCH3 group).
