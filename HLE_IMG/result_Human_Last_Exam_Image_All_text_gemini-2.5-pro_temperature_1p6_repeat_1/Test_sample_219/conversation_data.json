    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the timestamps of synchronized bursts and the average inter-burst interval from the provided graph.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Graph:** The provided image is a raster plot. The vertical axis represents the \"Electrode Number\" (from 0 to 128), and the horizontal axis represents \"Time\" in seconds (s). Each black dot signifies a neuronal firing event, also known as a spike or action potential.\n\n2.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** A \"synchronized burst\" is characterized by a high density of firing events occurring across many electrodes simultaneously within a short time frame. Visually, these appear as dense, vertical bands on the raster plot. We need to locate these bands and estimate the time at which they are centered.\n    *   Scanning the plot from left to right, we can identify four distinct, major synchronized bursts.\n    *   **Burst 1:** The first prominent burst is centered at approximately **2 seconds**.\n    *   **Burst 2:** The next major burst occurs just before the 20-second mark, centered at approximately **17 seconds**.\n    *   **Burst 3:** The third clear burst is located between the 30 and 40-second marks, centered at approximately **34 seconds**.\n    *   **Burst 4:** The final burst shown in the plot is found just before the 50-second mark, centered at approximately **48 seconds**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is important to distinguish these large, network-wide bursts from smaller, localized firing events that do not involve a significant portion of the neuronal culture. The four selected bursts are the most prominent and globally synchronized events in the recording.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** The inter-burst interval is the time duration between two consecutive bursts. We calculate this by subtracting the timestamp of an earlier burst from the timestamp of the following one.\n    *   **IBI 1 (between Burst 1 and 2):** 17 s - 2 s = **15 s**\n    *   **IBI 2 (between Burst 2 and 3):** 34 s - 17 s = **17 s**\n    *   **IBI 3 (between Burst 3 and 4):** 48 s - 34 s = **14 s**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Ensure that the intervals are calculated between consecutive bursts only.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval:** To find the average IBI, we sum the individual IBIs and divide by the number of intervals.\n    *   Sum of IBIs = 15 s + 17 s + 14 s = 46 s\n    *   Number of intervals = 3\n    *   Average IBI = 46 s / 3 â‰ˆ 15.333... s\n\n5.  **Round to Two Significant Figures:** The question requires the final answer to be expressed to two significant figures.\n    *   The calculated average is 15.333... s.\n    *   The first significant figure is 1.\n    *   The second significant figure is 5.\n    *   The third digit is 3, which is less than 5, so we do not round up the second significant figure.\n    *   Thus, the average IBI rounded to two significant figures is **15 s**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Pay close attention to the rules of rounding for significant figures.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   **Identified Burst Timestamps:** Approximately 2 s, 17 s, 34 s, and 48 s.\n*   **Calculated Average Inter-Burst Interval:** 15 s (to two significant figures).\n\n<<<15>>>"
