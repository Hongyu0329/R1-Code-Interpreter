The protein in question, S100B, exhibits a strong affinity for the **V-domain** of the **Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE)**.

S100B could be used as a **prognostic marker** for neurological disorders. This is because its presence and concentration are directly linked to the activation of pathological pathways (NFkB, JNK/JUN) that cause neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. These processes are the direct drivers of disease progression and severity. Therefore, measuring S100B levels would not simply indicate the presence of a disease (adjunct role) but would provide crucial information about the *activity and aggressiveness* of the pathology, allowing for a prediction of the patient's future clinical course and outcome (prognostic role).
