    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the fundamental structure.**\n    The provided image shows a complex organic molecule. We can identify several key features:\n    *   It has four fused rings, making it a tetracyclic compound.\n    *   There are two nitrogen atoms integrated into the ring system, making it a heterocyclic compound and a diamine. The presence of these nitrogen atoms in a plant-derived structure suggests it is an alkaloid, as stated in the question.\n    *   There is a carbonyl group (C=O) on one of the rings. This carbonyl group is adjacent to a nitrogen atom, which means it is part of a lactam functional group.\n    *   There are multiple stereocenters, indicated by wedged and dashed bonds, which define a specific three-dimensional shape.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the core skeleton.**\n    The tetracyclic framework C₁₅N₂ is characteristic of a class of alkaloids known as quinolizidine alkaloids, specifically the lupin alkaloids. The parent structure for many of these is sparteine (C₁₅H₂₆N₂), which has the same ring system but lacks the oxygen atom.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the specific compound.**\n    The given molecule is an oxidized derivative of sparteine. The presence of the carbonyl group (ketone/lactam) at a specific position is the defining feature. This particular structure, with the carbonyl at the C-2 position of the A-ring (the piperidone ring), is a well-known alkaloid.\n\n*   **Step 4: Name the compound.**\n    By comparing the given structure to known lupin alkaloids, we can identify it as **lupanine**. Lupanine (C₁₅H₂₄N₂O) is precisely the 2-oxo derivative of sparteine. The stereochemistry shown is that of the most common natural isomer, (-)-lupanine. It is a major alkaloid found in the seeds of plants from the *Lupinus* (lupin) genus.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
