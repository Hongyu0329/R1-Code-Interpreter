    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the century of the medallion:\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Medallion**\nThe image shows a metal medallion, likely made of gold or silver, depicted in a black and white photograph. The object is circular with a rectangular tab at the top, suggesting it was designed to be worn as a pendant or attached to something. The central design features two figures in profile, facing each other (a \"confronted busts\" motif). The artistic style is not naturalistic in the classical Greek or early Roman sense. The figures have large, prominent eyes, stylized hair, and somewhat flattened features, which is characteristic of art from Late Antiquity.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Iconography**\nThe most striking feature is on the figure to the left: a large, curved ram's horn. This is the primary iconographic clue. In the Roman world, the ram's horn is the defining attribute of the syncretic deity Jupiter-Ammon (a fusion of the Roman Jupiter and the Egyptian ram-headed god Amun). The figure on the right is likely his divine consort, Juno. Depicting emperors and their empresses in the guise of powerful deities like Jupiter and Juno was a common practice on ceremonial medallions during the later Roman Empire, used to project power and divine favor.\n\n**Step 3: Identification of the Specific Artifact**\nBased on the unique style and iconography (confronted busts of Jupiter-Ammon and Juno), this artifact can be identified as a well-known gold medallion from the **Tметоvo Treasure** (sometimes spelled Tmetovo). This famous hoard was discovered in Tметоvo, Bulgaria.\n\n**Step 4: Archaeological Dating**\nThe Tметоvo Treasure is a significant find from the Late Roman period. Archaeologists and numismatists have studied the coins and medallions within the hoard extensively. The style of the artwork and the associated coinage securely date the treasure to the middle of the **4th century AD**. More specifically, this medallion is often attributed to the reign of Emperor Constantius II (337–361 AD).\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe medallion is a product of the mid-4th century AD, created during the Constantinian dynasty of the Roman Empire. Therefore, the century to which archaeologists ascribe this medallion is the 4th century AD.\n\n<<<4th century AD>>>"
