    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the total area of the shaded regions.\n\n**1. Analyze the Geometric Setup**\nFirst, we need to understand the geometry of the figure from the given information.\n* The figure includes a circular sector with its center at the bottom vertex, let's call it O.\n* There are numbers 17 and 34 and several right-angle symbols.\n* Let's analyze the construction on the left side (blue region). There is a right-angled triangle implied. Let the leftmost point on the arc be A. There's a point P such that triangle OAP is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at A. The length of the side AP is given as 17, and the length of the hypotenuse OP is given as 34.\n* Using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle OAP: OA² + AP² = OP².\n* OA is the radius of the sector, let's call it R. So, R² + 17² = 34².\n* R² = 34² - 17² = (2 × 17)² - 17² = 4 × 17² - 17² = 3 × 17².\n* R = √(3 × 17²) = 17√3.\n* Let's find the angle α = ∠AOP in this triangle. We have sin(α) = AP/OP = 17/34 = 1/2.\n* This means α = 30° or π/6 radians.\n\n**2. Relate the Construction to the Sector Angles (θ)**\n* The diagram shows the total angle of the sector is divided into four equal angles, each labeled θ.\n* The construction on the left, which gives the angle α = 30°, corresponds to the part of the sector that subtends the first two angles, so its total angle is 2θ.\n* Therefore, we must have α = 2θ, which implies 2θ = 30°, so θ = 15°.\n* The total angle of the large circular sector is 4θ = 4 × 15° = 60°.\n* The construction on the right (red region) is symmetrical, defining an identical triangle and confirming 2θ = 30°.\n\n**3. Define the Shaded Regions**\n* The shaded regions are the areas \"on top of\" the circular arc, between the arc and an outer boundary formed by straight lines.\n* Let's set up a coordinate system for easier calculation. Let the center O be the origin (0,0) and let the central radius (the one labeled OA₂ in thought process, between the second and third θ) lie on the positive y-axis.\n* The radius is R = 17√3. The total angle is 60°, so the sector extends from -30° to +30° with respect to the y-axis.\n* The point P from the left-side construction lies on the line that makes a 30° angle with the leftmost radius OA (which is at -30° from the y-axis). The direction of this angle is towards the center of the sector. Thus, the line OP aligns with the central radius on the y-axis. The point P has coordinates (0, 34).\n* By symmetry, the construction point Q from the right side is the same point P(0, 34).\n* Let's call the vertices on the arc A₀ (leftmost), A₂, and A₄ (rightmost).\n* The blue shaded region can be interpreted as the area of the triangle with vertices A₀, P, A₂ minus the area of the circular segment defined by the chord A₀A₂ and the arc A₀A₂.\n* The red shaded region is similarly the area of the triangle with vertices A₄, P, A₂ minus the area of the circular segment A₂A₄.\n\n**4. Calculate the Area of One Shaded Region (e.g., the Blue Region)**\n* Area(Blue) = Area(Triangle A₀PA₂) - Area(Segment A₀A₂).\n* **Area(Segment A₀A₂) = Area(Sector OA₀A₂) - Area(Triangle OA₀A₂).**\n    * The angle of sector OA₀A₂ is 2θ = 30°. The radius is R = 17√3.\n    * Area(Sector OA₀A₂) = (30°/360°) × πR² = (1/12) × π × (17√3)² = (1/12) × π × 867 = 289π/4.\n    * Area(Triangle OA₀A₂) = (1/2)R²sin(30°) = (1/2) × (17√3)² × (1/2) = (1/4) × 867 = 867/4.\n    * Area(Segment A₀A₂) = 289π/4 - 867/4.\n* **Area(Triangle A₀PA₂):**\n    * Vertices are A₀(-R/2, R√3/2), P(0, 34), and A₂(0, R). R=17√3.\n    * A₀ = (-17√3/2, 51/2), P = (0, 34), A₂ = (0, 17√3).\n    * We can take the base as the segment PA₂ on the y-axis. Base length = 34 - 17√3.\n    * The height is the absolute value of the x-coordinate of A₀, which is 17√3/2.\n    * Area(Triangle A₀PA₂) = (1/2) × base × height = (1/2) × (34 - 17√3) × (17√3/2) = (17/2)(2-√3) × (17√3/2) = (289√3(2-√3))/4 = (578√3 - 867)/4.\n* **Area(Blue):**\n    * Area(Blue) = (578√3 - 867)/4 - (289π/4 - 867/4)\n    * Area(Blue) = (578√3 - 867 - 289π + 867)/4 = (578√3 - 289π)/4.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Area**\n* The red region is symmetrical to the blue region, so its area is the same: Area(Red) = (578√3 - 289π)/4.\n* The problem asks for the total area of the shaded regions. The note about the overlap implies we should find the area of the union of the two regions: `Area(Union) = Area(Blue) + Area(Red) - Area(Overlap)`.\n* The blue region lies in the second quadrant (and a bit of the first) and the red region lies in the first quadrant. They only meet at the line segment PA₂. An intersection along a line has an area of zero. Therefore, `Area(Overlap) = 0`.\n* Total Area = Area(Blue) + Area(Red).\n* Total Area = 2 × Area(Blue) = 2 × (578√3 - 289π)/4 = (578√3 - 289π)/2.\n* We can factor out 289: Total Area = 289(2√3 - π)/2.\n\n**6. Final Calculation**\n* Now, we compute the numerical value.\n* Using √3 ≈ 1.73205 and π ≈ 3.14159:\n* Total Area = 289 × (2 × 1.73205 - 3.14159) / 2\n* Total Area = 289 × (3.46410 - 3.14159) / 2\n* Total Area = 289 × (0.32251) / 2\n* Total Area = 93.10539 / 2 ≈ 46.55\n\nLet's re-calculate using the alternate identical form `289(√3 - π/2)` to avoid potential rounding errors.\n* Total Area = 289 × (1.7320508 - 3.1415927 / 2)\n* Total Area = 289 × (1.7320508 - 1.5707963)\n* Total Area = 289 × 0.1612545\n* Total Area ≈ 46.60255\n\nFinal check: The two interpretations presented in the thought process lead to the same final expression, `289(√3 - π/2)`, which strengthens the confidence in the result.\n\nTotal Area = `289(√3 - π/2)` ≈ 46.60\n\nFinal answer will be provided rounded to one decimal place.\n\n<<<46.6>>>"
