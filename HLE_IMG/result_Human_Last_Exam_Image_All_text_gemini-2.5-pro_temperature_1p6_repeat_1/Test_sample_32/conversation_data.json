    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the question:** The question asks for the primary, easily visible difference between the sporophytes of two specific moss species: *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. The sporophyte is the reproductive structure in mosses that produces spores, typically consisting of a foot, a stalk (seta), and a capsule.\n\n2.  **Analyze the scientific names for clues:** Scientific names often contain descriptive information.\n    *   *Grimmia montana*: The specific epithet \"montana\" refers to its habitat, meaning \"of the mountains.\" This doesn't give a clue about its physical appearance.\n    *   *Grimmia curviseta*: The specific epithet \"curviseta\" is derived from Latin. \"Curvus\" means \"curved,\" and \"seta\" refers to the stalk that supports the moss capsule. Therefore, the name itself strongly suggests that this species has a **curved seta**.\n\n3.  **Consult morphological descriptions of *Grimmia montana*:** Botanical sources and bryophyte floras describe the sporophyte of *Grimmia montana* as having a very short and **straight seta**. This means the capsule sits upright, either immersed within or just emergent from the leaves of the gametophyte.\n\n4.  **Consult morphological descriptions of *Grimmia curviseta*:** As its name implies, the key diagnostic feature for the sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta* is its seta. The seta is distinctly **curved or arcuate**. This curvature causes the capsule to be oriented at an angle, often appearing asymmetric or nodding, rather than being held erect.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the key difference:** By comparing the descriptions, the most prominent and defining difference between the sporophytes of these two species is the shape of the seta.\n    *   **Grimmia montana:** Straight seta, leading to an erect capsule.\n    *   **Grimmia curviseta:** Curved seta, leading to a bent or nodding capsule.\n\n6.  **Conclusion for \"at a glance\" identification:** When examining fertile specimens of these two mosses, the orientation of the capsule, which is determined by the straight versus curved seta, is the most immediate and reliable feature to tell them apart.\n\n***\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Presence of Sporophytes:** This distinguishing feature is only useful when the mosses are fertile and have mature sporophytes. Without them, identification must rely on gametophyte characteristics, which can be more subtle.\n*   **Condition of the Specimen:** The seta must be intact to observe its curvature. In very old or damaged specimens, this feature might be lost.\n*   **Synonymy and Taxonomy:** In bryology, names and classifications can change. *Grimmia curviseta* has sometimes been treated as a variety or synonym of other species, but the name itself is tied to the feature of a curved seta.\n*   **Viewing the Seta:** Since the seta in many *Grimmia* species is very short, careful observation, possibly with a hand lens, may be required to see its shape clearly amongst the leaves.\n\n***\nThe main distinguishing feature in the sporophyte of *Grimmia montana* compared to *Grimmia curviseta* is the curvature of the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). *Grimmia montana* has a short, straight seta, resulting in an erect capsule. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta*, as its name implies (\"curvi-\" meaning curved, \"seta\" meaning stalk), has a distinctly curved or arcuate seta, which causes its capsule to be bent over or nodding.\n\n<<<The main difference is the curvature of the seta. *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a curved (arcuate) seta.>>>"
