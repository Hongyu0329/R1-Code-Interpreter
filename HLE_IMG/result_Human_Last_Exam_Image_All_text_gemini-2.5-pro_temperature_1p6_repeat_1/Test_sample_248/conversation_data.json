    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observation of the Image:** The photograph displays a community of marine invertebrates on a wet rock surface, characteristic of an intertidal zone (the area between high and low tide lines). The visible organisms are primarily barnacles and snails.\n\n2.  **Identification of Organisms:**\n    *   **Barnacles:** The rock is heavily colonized by acorn barnacles, which are sessile (non-moving) crustaceans. There appear to be both living individuals (with closed opercular plates) and dead, eroded shells. Many barnacle species exist on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, so they might not be the most definitive indicator without microscopic examination. The most common intertidal barnacle on the NE Atlantic coast is *Semibalanus balanoides*, which fits this general appearance.\n    *   **Snails (Gastropods):** There are at least two distinct types of snails present.\n        *   **Type 1 (Larger, lighter snails):** There are two larger snails with lighter-colored shells. One is whitish and slightly eroded, while the other is light tan with faint brown spiral bands. Their shape is typical of a dogwinkle or whelk. This morphology is consistent with the Atlantic dogwinkle, *Nucella lapillus*.\n        *   **Type 2 (Smaller, darker snails):** There are several smaller, darker snails with a more conical shape and visible ridges on their shells. This appearance is highly characteristic of the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*.\n\n3.  **Geographic Range Analysis:** To determine if the photo is from the Atlantic or Pacific, we need to examine the known geographic distributions of the identifiable species. The key is to find a species present in the photo that is exclusively found on one coast.\n    *   ***Nucella lapillus* (Atlantic Dogwinkle):** This species is native to the coasts of the North Atlantic Ocean, including North America and Europe. It is *not* found on the Pacific Coast of North America. Its presence would indicate an Atlantic location.\n    *   ***Littorina littorea* (Common Periwinkle):** This snail is native to the northeastern Atlantic coasts of Europe. It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the 19th century and has since become extremely abundant from Canada to Maryland. Crucially, *Littorina littorea* is **not found** as an established, widespread species on the Pacific Coast of North America. Its presence in a natural intertidal setting like this is a definitive sign that the location is on the Atlantic Coast.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The presence of the small, dark, ridged snails, which are clearly identifiable as the Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*), definitively places the photograph on the Atlantic Coast. While the other species like the barnacles (*Semibalanus balanoides*) and the dogwinkles (*Nucella lapillus*) also point to an Atlantic habitat, *Littorina littorea* is a classic and unmistakable indicator species for this purpose.\n\nThe scientific name of the species that definitively indicates an Atlantic rather than Pacific Coast location is *Littorina littorea*.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
