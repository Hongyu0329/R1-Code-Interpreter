The high regioselectivity observed in Reaction 3 is due to the structure of the N-acetylproline starting material. The results from Reactions 1 and 2 are crucial for building this rationale.

1.  **Reaction 1's Contribution:** This reaction, using an acyclic substrate, produces a single product, demonstrating that the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between the münchnone intermediate and methyl propiolate is itself a highly regioselective process.

2.  **Reaction 2's Contribution:** The 13C labeling experiment reveals that for the acyclic N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine, a scrambling process occurs *before* the cycloaddition. This process renders the two ends of the münchnone dipole (C2 from the acetyl group and C4 from the alanine group) equivalent, leading to a 1:1 mixture of labeled products. This indicates the existence of an equilibrium between two isomeric münchnones.

3.  **Rationale for Reaction 3:** In Reaction 3, the starting material is N-acetylproline. When it forms a münchnone, the C4 position of the dipole is a bridgehead carbon of the rigid proline ring. The scrambling mechanism that operates in Reaction 2 is structurally impossible here, as it would require breaking the N-Cα bond within the stable five-membered ring. Consequently, only a single, non-equilibrating münchnone intermediate is formed. This single, stable intermediate then undergoes the intrinsically regioselective cycloaddition (established in Reaction 1), resulting in the formation of a single, highly favored regioisomeric product (Product B).
