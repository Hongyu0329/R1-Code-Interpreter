    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the image**\nThe image provided is an emission spectrum. It shows a series of bright, discrete vertical lines of various colors against a dark background. Each chemical element, when energized (for example, by heat or electricity), emits light at specific wavelengths, creating a unique pattern of lines like this. This pattern is often referred to as the element's \"fingerprint.\" The colors are arranged by wavelength, with shorter wavelengths (blue, violet) on the left and longer wavelengths (red) on the right.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the key features of the spectrum**\nTo identify the element, we must carefully observe the pattern of the linesâ€”their colors, positions, and relative brightness.\n*   **Red Region:** There is a prominent, bright red line on the far right.\n*   **Yellow-Orange Region:** There is a distinct and bright line in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum.\n*   **Green Region:** There are several lines in the green area.\n*   **Cyan (Blue-Green) Region:** A very prominent and bright line is visible in this part of the spectrum.\n*   **Blue/Violet Region:** There are multiple lines in the blue and violet section on the far left.\n\nThe spectrum is quite rich, with numerous lines across the entire visible range, indicating it is not the simplest element (like hydrogen).\n\n**Step 3: Compare the observed spectrum with known spectra of common elements**\nWe will now compare the pattern we've observed with the known spectra of a few common elements.\n\n*   **Hydrogen:** The visible spectrum of hydrogen (the Balmer series) is simple, with four main lines: a red line (H-alpha), a cyan line (H-beta), and two violet lines (H-gamma and H-delta). The spectrum in the image is far more complex, containing many more lines, particularly a bright yellow one and several in the green, which are absent in the simple hydrogen spectrum. Therefore, it is not hydrogen.\n\n*   **Neon:** Neon is famous for its bright reddish-orange glow. Its emission spectrum is heavily dominated by a large number of lines crowded in the red and orange parts of the spectrum. While the image does have red and orange lines, it also has very strong lines in the green, cyan, and blue regions. The spectral \"weight\" is not as skewed towards red as it is for neon. Thus, it is unlikely to be neon.\n\n*   **Sodium:** The most dominant feature of the sodium spectrum is a very intense pair of lines (a doublet) located very close together in the yellow part of the spectrum. The given spectrum has a line in the yellow region, but it also has many other strong lines across the spectrum. The overall pattern does not match sodium.\n\n*   **Helium:** The emission spectrum of Helium is well-known and matches the observed pattern remarkably well. Helium has several prominent, well-spaced lines across the visible spectrum:\n    *   A strong **red** line.\n    *   A strong **yellow** line.\n    *   Several **green** lines.\n    *   A prominent **cyan** (blue-green) line.\n    *   Several **blue-violet** lines.\nThis exact combination of strong lines in the red, yellow, green, cyan, and blue regions is the characteristic fingerprint of Helium. The image provided is a standard representation of the visible emission spectrum of Helium.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the detailed comparison, the pattern of spectral lines shown in the image, with its prominent red, yellow, green, cyan, and blue lines, perfectly matches the atomic emission spectrum of the element Helium.\n\n<<<Helium>>>"
