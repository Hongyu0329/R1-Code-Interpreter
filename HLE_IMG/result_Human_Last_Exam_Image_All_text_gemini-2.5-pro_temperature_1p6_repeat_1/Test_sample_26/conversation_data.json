    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Piece, Movement, and Key:** The music is from Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8, Op. 13 \"Pathétique,\" first movement. The main key of this movement is C minor. The key signature of three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭) confirms this.\n\n2.  **Locate Measure 30:** The score page begins with measure 20. The second system of staves starts with measure 28. Measure 30 is the third measure in that system and is circled in the provided image.\n\n3.  **Identify the Notes in Measure 30:**\n    *   **Treble Clef (Right Hand):** The notes on the first beat are G4 and E♮4 (the natural sign cancels the E♭ in the key signature). The E♮ quickly resolves to D4 on the second eighth-note of the beat. The notes on the second beat are D4 and B♮3 (the natural sign cancels the B♭ in the key signature).\n    *   **Bass Clef (Left Hand):** The left hand plays octaves on G3 and B♮2 for the first two beats.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Harmony:**\n    *   We need to combine the notes being played simultaneously to identify the chord.\n    *   The core notes present on beat 1 are G (in the bass), B♮ (in the bass), and G (in the right hand). The E♮ in the right hand is a non-chord tone, specifically an appoggiatura, as it occurs on a strong part of the beat and resolves down by step to the chord tone D.\n    *   The full chord spelled out by the notes (G, B♮, D) is a G major triad.\n\n5.  **Determine the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   Roman numeral analysis requires relating the identified chord back to the home key of C minor.\n    *   The scale degrees of C minor are: C(i), D(ii°), E♭(III), F(iv), G(v), A♭(VI), B♭(VII). The harmonic minor scale raises the 7th degree to create a leading tone (B♮), which is necessary for a strong dominant function.\n    *   The chord we identified is a G major triad (G-B♮-D).\n    *   The root of this chord, G, is the fifth scale degree of C minor.\n    *   A major triad built on the fifth scale degree is the **dominant** chord.\n    *   In Roman numeral notation, a major chord is represented by an uppercase Roman numeral. Therefore, the dominant chord in a minor key is written as **V**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Key Signature vs. Accidentals:** It is essential to pay attention to accidentals (like the ♮ signs on B and E) as they alter the notes from the key signature and are critical for defining the harmony. The B♮ is particularly important as it creates the leading tone, making the chord a major dominant (V) instead of a minor dominant (v).\n*   **Non-Chord Tones:** Recognizing the E♮ as an appoggiatura is crucial. Mistaking it for a chord tone would lead to an incorrect analysis (e.g., trying to analyze a G-B♮-D-E♮ chord).\n*   **Context:** The chord in measure 30 (V) logically follows the tonic chord (i) in measure 29 and precedes the subdominant (iv) in measure 31, fitting into the harmonic progression of the section.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe notes in measure 30 form a G major triad, which functions as the dominant chord in the key of C minor. The correct Roman numeral is V.\n\n<<<V>>>"
