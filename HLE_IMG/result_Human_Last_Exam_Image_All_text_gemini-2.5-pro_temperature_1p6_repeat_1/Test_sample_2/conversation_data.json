    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algorithm's Logic\n\nLet's break down the function `sort(a, n)`. This function aims to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a` (i.e., the subarray `a[0...n-1]`).\n\n1.  **`def sort(a, n):`**: Defines a function named `sort` that takes an array `a` and its size `n` as input.\n2.  **`if n > 1:`**: This is the recursive condition. If the size of the subarray is 1 or less, it's considered sorted, so nothing is done. This is the base case of the recursion.\n3.  **`sort(a, n - 1)`**: This is the first recursive call. It sorts the prefix of the array of size `n-1`, which is `a[0...n-2]`. After this call completes, we can assume that `a[0] <= a[1] <= ... <= a[n-2]`.\n4.  **`if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:`**: This line compares the last element of the current subarray (`a[n-1]`) with the second to last element (`a[n-2]`). Since the prefix `a[0...n-2]` is already sorted, `a[n-2]` is the largest element in that prefix.\n5.  **`swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`**: If `a[n-1]` is smaller than `a[n-2]`, they are swapped. The goal here is to place the larger of the two at position `n-1`. However, this swap might disrupt the sorted order of the prefix `a[0...n-2]` because the smaller element (`a[n-1]`) has been moved into it.\n6.  **`sort(a, n - 1)`**: This is the second recursive call. It is executed only if the swap happened. Its purpose is to re-sort the now-disrupted prefix `a[0...n-2]`.\n\nIn essence, the algorithm works by first sorting the first `n-1` elements, then placing the `n`-th element correctly relative to the `(n-1)`-th, and if that required a swap, it re-sorts the first `n-1` elements again.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe worst-case time complexity occurs when the algorithm performs the maximum amount of work. In this code, the most work is done when the second recursive call, `sort(a, n - 1)`, is executed. This happens when the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true.\n\nFor the worst case, we want this condition to be true at every level of the recursion (for every `n > 1`). Let's see if we can find an input array that causes this.\n\nConsider an array sorted in reverse order, for example, `a = [n, n-1, ..., 2, 1]`.\n\nLet's analyze `sort(a, n)` with this input:\n1.  **`sort(a, n - 1)`** is called on the prefix `[n, n-1, ..., 2]`. Let's assume this call successfully sorts its subarray. The result will be `[2, 3, ..., n]`. So the full array `a` becomes `[2, 3, ..., n, 1]`.\n2.  Now, the condition **`if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`** is checked. This becomes `if 1 < n`. For any `n > 1`, this condition is true.\n3.  A **`swap`** occurs. `a` becomes `[2, 3, ..., 1, n]`.\n4.  The second call to **`sort(a, n - 1)`** is executed on the new prefix `[2, 3, ..., 1]`.\n\nThis shows that for a reverse-sorted array, the `if` condition is always met, triggering both recursive calls at each step. This is indeed the worst-case scenario.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Recurrence Relation\n\nLet `T(n)` be the time complexity for `sort(a, n)` in the worst case.\n- The first recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` takes `T(n-1)` time.\n- The comparison and swap take constant time, `O(1)`. Let's call it `c`.\n- The second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` also takes `T(n-1)` time.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation for the worst-case time complexity is:\n`T(n) = T(n-1) + c + T(n-1)`\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n\nThe base case is for `n=1`, where the function does almost nothing, so `T(1)` is a constant.\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Recurrence Relation\n\nLet's solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c` by expansion:\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n`T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n`T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 3c`\n`T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n`T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^k - 1)`\n\nWe expand until we hit the base case `T(1)`. This happens when `n-k = 1`, so `k = n-1`.\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n\nSince `T(1)` and `c` are constants, the expression is dominated by the `2^(n-1)` term.\n`T(n) = O(2^(n-1))`, which is equivalent to `O(2^n)`.\n\nThis recurrence relation is famously associated with the Towers of Hanoi problem, which also has an exponential `O(2^n)` complexity.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nThe worst-case time complexity of the given algorithm is exponential.\n\n- A. O(n): Incorrect.\n- B. O(n log n): Incorrect.\n- C. O(n^2): Incorrect.\n- D. O(n^3): Incorrect.\n- E. O(2^n): Correct.\n- F. does not terminate: Incorrect. The recursive calls are on a smaller size `n-1`, so it will eventually reach the base case `n <= 1` and terminate.\n\nThe final answer is O(2^n).\n\n<<<E>>>"
