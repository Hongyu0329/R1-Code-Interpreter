    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Content:** The image displays a circular sculpted relief, known as a tondo, set within a larger, ornate frame, which appears to be part of an altarpiece or tabernacle. The material looks like marble or possibly a fine-grained stone. The scene is religious, depicting a priest administering the Eucharist (Holy Communion) to several kneeling figures, including a child in the foreground.\n2.  **Examine the Style:** The style of the sculpture is characteristic of the Italian Early Renaissance (Quattrocento). The figures are rendered with classical grace, idealized features, and naturalistic drapery. The composition is balanced and clear. The technique involves varying depths of relief, from shallow carving in the background (a technique called *rilievo schiacciato*) to higher relief for the foreground figures, creating a convincing illusion of space. This style is closely associated with Florentine masters of the 15th century.\n3.  **Identify the Inscription:** At the bottom of the tondo, there is a cartouche with an inscription. Zooming in, the text can be deciphered as \"SACRAMENTI DE LAVTEL\". This is a combination of Latin and old French/Italian, meaning \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" a direct reference to the Eucharist depicted above.\n4.  **Synthesize and Research:** Based on the Florentine Renaissance style, the tondo format, the subject matter (Eucharist), and the specific inscription, we can search for the artwork. The style is particularly reminiscent of the sculptor Luca della Robbia, known for his serene and gentle figures, as well as his mastery in both marble and glazed terracotta.\n5.  **Confirm the Identification:** A search for \"Luca della Robbia Sacrament of the Altar relief\" or \"Tabernacle SACRAMENTI DE LAVTEL\" leads to the identification of this artwork. This relief is a central part of the **Tabernacle of the Sacrament** (also known as the **Tabernacle of Peretola**), created by Luca della Robbia around 1441-1443. Originally made for the church of Sant'Andrea in Peretola (near Florence), it is now housed in the Museo di San Marco in Florence. The work is celebrated as a masterpiece of Renaissance marble sculpture.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Medium:** While Luca della Robbia is famous for glazed terracotta, this specific piece is carved in marble, showcasing his skill in that medium as well.\n*   **Inscription:** The inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE LAVTEL\" is a key identifier, directly linking the image to its title and subject.\n*   **Style:** The serene classicism, clarity of narrative, and masterful use of perspective through relief are hallmarks of Luca della Robbia's style, distinguishing him from contemporaries like Donatello, who often favored more dramatic and emotional expressions.\n*   **Context:** Recognizing that this is a detail from a larger work (a tabernacle) is important for a complete understanding and accurate identification.\n\nBy combining visual analysis with historical and art-historical knowledge, the author can be confidently identified.\n\n<<<Luca della Robbia>>>"
