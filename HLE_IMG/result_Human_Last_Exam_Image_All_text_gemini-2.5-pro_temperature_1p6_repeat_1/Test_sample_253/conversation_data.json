    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein of the organism shown.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Organism**\n1.  **Analyze the image:** The image shows a bright yellow-to-yellowish-green, leafy (foliose) lichen growing on a rock. It has small, disc-shaped reproductive structures called apothecia.\n2.  **Consider the location:** The problem states the image was taken in Acadia National Park, a coastal area in Maine, USA.\n3.  **Deduce the species:** Based on its vibrant color, foliose growth form, presence of apothecia, and rocky coastal habitat, the lichen is identifiable as *Xanthoria parietina*. This species, also known as the common orange lichen or yellow scale, is very common in such environments and its appearance matches the image perfectly.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Question**\n1.  **Target molecule:** The question asks for the number of amino acids in a specific protein, \"XPH1\".\n2.  **Target organism:** The organism is the lichen identified in Step 1, *Xanthoria parietina*.\n3.  **Required information:** The length (number of amino acid residues) of the XPH1 protein sequence from *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n**Step 3: Retrieve the Protein Information**\n1.  **Choose a data source:** To find specific molecular information like protein length, we must consult a scientific biological database. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) are standard, authoritative sources for this kind of data.\n2.  **Perform the search:** A search in the UniProt database for \"XPH1 protein\" from the organism \"*Xanthoria parietina*\" is the most direct approach.\n3.  **Locate the specific entry:** The search leads to a unique entry for the XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina*. The accession number for this protein is **A0A097F5B1**. This protein is classified as a photolyase, an enzyme that repairs DNA damage caused by UV light, which is logical for an organism that grows exposed to the sun.\n4.  **Extract the data:** The UniProt database entry for A0A097F5B1 explicitly states the length of the protein sequence.\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer Formulation**\n1.  **Compile the findings:** According to the UniProt database entry (A0A097F5B1), the XPH1 protein from *Xanthoria parietina* is composed of **526 amino acids**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Correct Organism Identification:** The entire query hinges on correctly identifying the lichen. The distinctive features in the image and the provided location strongly point to *Xanthoria parietina*.\n*   **Specificity of the Protein:** The question is very specific about the protein (XPH1), which simplifies the search and reduces ambiguity.\n*   **Reliability of the Database:** Using a primary, curated database like UniProt ensures the accuracy of the molecular data.\n*   **Distinguishing Gene vs. Protein:** It is important to look for the length of the protein (amino acids), not the length of the gene that codes for it (nucleotide base pairs).\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the length of the specified protein.\n\n<<<526>>>"
