    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe goal is to calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) when moving from the Baseline scenario (Table 1) to the Proposed scenario (Table 2).\n\n**Formula for Percentage Reduction:**\nPercentage Reduction = [(VMT_Baseline - VMT_Proposed) / VMT_Baseline] * 100%\n\n**Understanding VMT Calculation:**\nVMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled) represents the total miles traveled by vehicles. To calculate this accurately from the given tables, we need to consider the number of trips, the share of those trips made by car, and the average distance of those trips for each distance category. Since the total number of trips is not given, we can work with a weighted VMT value which will be proportional to the actual VMT. The common constant (Total Trips) will cancel out when calculating the percentage reduction.\n\n**Weighted VMT Formula:**\nWeighted VMT = Σ [(Share of total trips for a distance range) × (Total car mode share for that range) × (Average trip distance for that range)]\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Car VMT:** We must include both \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\" modes. We simply add their mode shares together for each distance category to get the total car mode share.\n2.  **VMT vs. PMT:** The question explicitly asks for \"Vehicle Miles Traveled\" (VMT), not Person Miles Traveled (PMT). Therefore, the \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" data is not needed, as it relates to the number of people per vehicle, not the miles the vehicle itself travels.\n3.  **Use of \"Total\" column:** The \"Total\" column for mode share represents the average share of trips across all distances, not the average share of miles. Using this column to calculate VMT would be inaccurate because it doesn't correctly weight the high mileage of longer trips. We must calculate the VMT for each distance segment individually and then sum them.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Weighted Car VMT for the Baseline Scenario\n\nFirst, we find the total car mode share for each distance category in Table 1 by adding the shares of \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** 25% + 28% = 53% (or 0.53)\n*   **3-5 miles:** 38% + 43% = 81% (or 0.81)\n*   **5-10 miles:** 40% + 45% = 85% (or 0.85)\n*   **10+ miles:** 42% + 47% = 89% (or 0.89)\n\nNow, we calculate the weighted VMT for the Baseline scenario by applying the formula for each distance category and summing the results.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** (48% of trips) × (53% car share) × (1 mile avg. dist.) = 0.48 × 0.53 × 1 = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles:** (22% of trips) × (81% car share) × (4 miles avg. dist.) = 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles:** (14% of trips) × (85% car share) × (7.5 miles avg. dist.) = 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles:** (16% of trips) × (89% car share) × (20 miles avg. dist.) = 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = 2.8480\n\n**Total Baseline Weighted VMT** = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Weighted Car VMT for the Proposed Scenario\n\nSimilarly, we find the total car mode share for each distance category in Table 2.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** 1% + 2% = 3% (or 0.03)\n*   **3-5 miles:** 8% + 19% = 27% (or 0.27)\n*   **5-10 miles:** 14% + 27% = 41% (or 0.41)\n*   **10+ miles:** 16% + 33% = 49% (or 0.49)\n\nNow, we calculate the weighted VMT for the Proposed scenario.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** (48% of trips) × (3% car share) × (1 mile avg. dist.) = 0.48 × 0.03 × 1 = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles:** (22% of trips) × (27% car share) × (4 miles avg. dist.) = 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles:** (14% of trips) × (41% car share) × (7.5 miles avg. dist.) = 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles:** (16% of trips) × (49% car share) × (20 miles avg. dist.) = 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = 1.5680\n\n**Total Proposed Weighted VMT** = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction in Car VMT\n\nNow we use the weighted VMT values to find the percentage reduction.\n\n*   **VMT Reduction** = VMT_Baseline - VMT_Proposed = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / VMT_Baseline) × 100%\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100%\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = 0.52195... × 100% ≈ **52.2%**\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
