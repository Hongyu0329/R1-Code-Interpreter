    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Cutoff Frequency**\n\nThe circuit consists of a resistive ladder network followed by a capacitor $C$ to ground. The node $a_0$ is the point between the network and the capacitor. This forms a low-pass filter. The cutoff frequency is the frequency at which the magnitude of the filter's transfer function drops to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ (or -3 dB) of its DC (zero frequency) value.\n\nFor a first-order low-pass filter, the angular cutoff frequency, denoted by $\\omega_c$, is given by the formula:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C}$\nwhere $R_{th}$ is the Thevenin equivalent resistance of the circuit \"seen\" by the capacitor $C$. The frequency in Hertz, $f_c$, is related by $f_c = \\omega_c / (2\\pi)$. We will determine the expression for $\\omega_c$.\n\n**2. Finding the Thevenin Equivalent Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\n\nTo find $R_{th}$, we look into the terminals where the capacitor is connected, which are $a_0$ and $b_0$ (ground). We must deactivate all independent sources. In this case, the input voltage source `IN` at node $c_0$ is deactivated by shorting it to ground.\n\nThe circuit for finding $R_{th}$ is as follows:\n- Node $c_0$ is grounded.\n- We need to find the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground.\n- Looking from node $a_0$, there is a resistor $r$ connected to node $d_1$. The rest of the infinite ladder network is connected from that point onwards.\n- The resistance seen from $a_0$ is the sum of the resistor $r$ (between $a_0$ and $d_1$) and the equivalent resistance of the network seen from node $d_1$ with respect to ground ($c_0$).\n- Therefore, $R_{th} = r + R_{d1,c0}$, where $R_{d1,c0}$ is the equivalent resistance between node $d_1$ and node $c_0$ of the infinite ladder.\n\n**3. Calculating the Ladder Resistance ($R_{d1,c0}$)**\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the resistance between nodes $d_1$ and $c_0$ of the infinite resistor ladder. We can solve this by analyzing the node potentials along the ladder. Let $V_{cn}$ and $V_{dn}$ be the potentials at nodes $c_n$ and $d_n$ respectively.\n\nWe apply a current $I$ at node $d_1$ and extract it at node $c_0$. We then calculate the resulting potential difference $V_{d1} - V_{c0}$. By definition, $R_{d1,c0} = (V_{d1} - V_{c0}) / I$. Let's set $V_{c0} = 0$.\n\nThe Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) equations at any node $(c_n, d_n)$ for $n \\geq 1$ in the homogeneous part of the ladder are:\nAt node $c_n$: $(V_{cn} - V_{c(n-1)})/r + (V_{cn} - V_{c(n+1)})/r + (V_{cn} - V_{dn})/r = 0 \\implies 3V_{cn} - V_{c(n-1)} - V_{c(n+1)} - V_{dn} = 0$\nAt node $d_n$: $(V_{dn} - V_{d(n-1)})/r + (V_{dn} - V_{d(n+1)})/r + (V_{dn} - V_{cn})/r = 0 \\implies 3V_{dn} - V_{d(n-1)} - V_{d(n+1)} - V_{cn} = 0$\n\nWe look for solutions of the form $V_{cn} = A k^n$ and $V_{dn} = B k^n$. Substituting these into the equations yields two characteristic decay constants. For the potentials to be finite as $n \\to \\infty$, we must choose the decaying solutions. The physically relevant decaying solution corresponds to a propagation factor $k_0 = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe general form of the decaying potential solution for our specific boundary conditions ($V_{c0}=0$ and current injection at $d_1$) can be shown to be:\n$V_{cn} = A(1 - k_0^n)$\n$V_{dn} = A(1 + k_0^n)$\nwhere $A$ is a constant proportional to the injected current.\n\nThis set of potentials must be generated by a current $I$ injected at $d_1$ and extracted at $c_0$. Let's calculate this current $I$ from the potential at the sink, node $c_0$:\n$I = I_{out, c0} = (V_{c1} - V_{c0}) / r = V_{c1} / r$\nUsing our solution: $V_{c1} = A(1 - k_0^1) = A(1-k_0)$.\nSo, $I = A(1-k_0) / r$.\n\nWe can verify that the same current $I$ is injected at $d_1$ by summing the currents leaving $d_1$:\n$I_{in, d1} = (V_{d1}-V_{c1})/r + (V_{d1}-V_{d2})/r$\nSubstituting the potentials:\n$V_{d1} = A(1+k_0)$\n$V_{d2} = A(1+k_0^2)$\n$V_{c1} = A(1-k_0)$\n$I_{in, d1} = \\frac{A}{r}[(1+k_0) - (1-k_0) + (1+k_0) - (1+k_0^2)] = \\frac{A}{r}[3k_0 - k_0^2]$\nUsing the characteristic equation for $k_0$, which is $k_0^2 - 4k_0 + 1 = 0$, we have $k_0^2 = 4k_0 - 1$.\n$3k_0 - k_0^2 = 3k_0 - (4k_0 - 1) = 1 - k_0$.\nSo, $I_{in, d1} = A(1-k_0)/r = I$. The solution is consistent.\n\nNow we can calculate the resistance $R_{d1,c0}$:\n$R_{d1,c0} = \\frac{V_{d1} - V_{c0}}{I} = \\frac{V_{d1}}{I} = \\frac{A(1+k_0)}{A(1-k_0)/r} = r \\frac{1+k_0}{1-k_0}$\nSubstituting $k_0 = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$:\n$R_{d1,c0} = r \\frac{1 + (2-\\sqrt{3})}{1 - (2-\\sqrt{3})} = r \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}-1} = r \\frac{\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{3}-1)}{\\sqrt{3}-1} = r\\sqrt{3}$\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nNow we have all the pieces:\n$R_{th} = r + R_{d1,c0} = r + r\\sqrt{3} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$\n\nFinally, the angular cutoff frequency is:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C} = \\frac{1}{r(1+\\sqrt{3}) C}$\n\nThe cutoff frequency in Hz would be $f_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r C (1+\\sqrt{3})}$. As \"cutoff frequency\" can refer to either $\\omega_c$ or $f_c$ in a symbolic context, we provide the simpler expression for the angular frequency $\\omega_c$.\n\n<<<1/(r*C*(1+sqrt(3)))>>>"
