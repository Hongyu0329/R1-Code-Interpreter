    "**Step-by-step analysis of the image:**\n\n1.  **Identify the artwork's style and origin:** The image is of an ancient Greek vase. The technique is red-figure pottery, where figures are left in the natural red-orange color of the clay against a black painted background. Details are added with fine black lines. The elaborate decorative elements (like the palmettes) and the use of added white paint suggest it is from the South Italian (likely Apulian) school of vase painting, dating to the 4th century BCE.\n\n2.  **Analyze the central action:** The most dramatic part of the scene is a figure falling headfirst out of a chariot. This figure is a nude male, depicted in a moment of crisis or death. The act of \"leaving the chariot\" is clearly involuntary and catastrophic.\n\n3.  **Identify the figures in the scene:**\n    *   **The falling figure:** A nude youth, tumbling towards the ground. This is the subject of the question.\n    *   **Figures in the chariot:** There are two figures inside the chariot. One, on the left, is the driver, holding the reins and a goad. This figure wears an ornate, spotted garment and a Phrygian cap, often used in Greek art to denote a non-Greek or \"oriental\" person (like a Trojan or Amazon). A large white wing is visible behind this figure. The second figure is a woman in flowing white robes.\n    *   **The horse:** A white horse is pulling the chariot.\n\n4.  **Connect the scene to Greek mythology:** The theme of a mortal falling to his death from a celestial chariot is the core of a very specific and famous myth: the story of Phaethon.\n    *   **The Myth of Phaethon:** Phaethon was the mortal son of Helios, the god of the sun. To prove his divine parentage, Phaethon begged his father to let him drive the sun chariot for a day. Helios reluctantly agreed. Phaethon, being unable to control the powerful immortal horses, veered off course, first scorching the heavens and then threatening to burn the Earth. To prevent a global catastrophe, Zeus, the king of the gods, struck Phaethon with a thunderbolt. Phaethon, ablaze, fell from the chariot into the Eridanus river below.\n\n5.  **Correlate the myth with the visual evidence:**\n    *   The falling nude youth perfectly matches the description of Phaethon being struck down by Zeus. His helpless, tumbling pose captures the essence of his fall.\n    *   The chariot is the sun chariot.\n    *   The other figures are often interpreted as his sisters, the Heliades, who mourned him so much they were turned into poplar trees. Some interpretations might identify the winged figure as Eos (Dawn), who precedes the sun chariot and witnesses the tragedy. Regardless of the precise identity of the occupants of the chariot, the central figure defined by the dramatic fall is unequivocally Phaethon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the iconic visual representation of a youth falling from a celestial chariot, a hallmark scene in Greek art, the figure leaving the chariot is identified as Phaethon from Greek mythology.\n\n<<<Phaethon>>>"
