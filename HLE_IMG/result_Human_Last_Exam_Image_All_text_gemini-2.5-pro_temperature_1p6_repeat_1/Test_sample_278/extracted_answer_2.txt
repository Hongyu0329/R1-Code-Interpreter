The image displays a fungus, specifically a yeast showing dimorphism. The key morphological features are round to oval budding yeast cells (blastoconidia) and filamentous structures known as pseudohyphae, which are characterized by chains of elongated cells with constrictions at the septations. This morphology is highly characteristic of an invasive infection by a species of *Candida*.
