    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to determine the unknown compound.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Ion (M⁺) Region:**\n    The peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) are in the range of 258-268. This cluster likely represents the molecular ion and its isotope peaks. The peaks in this region are m/z 258 (17.4%), 260 (34.8%), 262 (29.0%), 264 (12.9%), and 266 (3.22%). An even mass for the main molecular ion peaks (258, 260, 262...) suggests that the molecule contains either zero or an even number of nitrogen atoms, according to the Nitrogen Rule.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Base Peak and its Isotope Pattern:**\n    The base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum, which is defined as 100% relative intensity. According to the table, the base peak is at **m/z 225** (I = 100%).\n    We must examine the isotope peaks associated with the base peak to check for halogens like chlorine or bromine.\n    *   Peak at m/z 225: Intensity = 100%\n    *   Peak at m/z 227 (i.e., M+2): Intensity = 66.7%\n    The theoretical relative intensity ratio for a fragment containing one chlorine atom (³⁵Cl:³⁷Cl ≈ 3:1) would be 100:33. For two chlorine atoms, the ratio for M:(M+2) is (3:1)² vs 2*(3:1), i.e., 9:6 or 3:2. This translates to an intensity ratio of 100:66.7.\n    The observed ratio of the peaks at m/z 225 and m/z 227 is **100 : 66.7**, which is an excellent match for a fragment containing **two chlorine atoms**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Structure from Fragmentation:**\n    The base peak at m/z 225 is a fragment ion. It is typically formed by the loss of a radical from the molecular ion (M⁺•). A very common loss for chlorinated compounds is a chlorine radical (Cl•, mass 35 or 37).\n    *   Let's assume the base peak [F]⁺ at m/z 225 is formed by the loss of a chlorine atom from the molecular ion M⁺•:  M⁺• → [M-Cl]⁺ + Cl•.\n    *   If this is the case, the mass of the molecular ion would be m/z(225) + m/z(Cl) = 225 + 35 = 260 (using the lightest isotope ³⁵Cl).\n    *   This implies the molecule has a nominal molecular weight of 260 and contains at least three chlorine atoms (two in the fragment at m/z 225, and one that was lost).\n\n4.  **Verify the Proposed Molecular Formula and Structure:**\n    *   **Molecular Weight:** The proposed nominal molecular weight is 260. The spectrum shows a significant peak at m/z 260, which is consistent with it being the molecular ion peak for the molecule containing only the lightest isotopes (e.g., ¹²C, ¹H, ³⁵Cl).\n    *   **Number of Chlorines:** The hypothesis is that the molecule contains three chlorine atoms. Let's check the theoretical isotope pattern for a molecule with three chlorines (R-Cl₃). The M⁺, M⁺+2, M⁺+4, and M⁺+6 peaks should appear in a ratio of approximately 27:27:9:1. The observed intensities at m/z 260 (34.8%), 262 (29.0%), 264 (12.9%), and 266 (3.22%) roughly follow this pattern (e.g., M⁺+4:M⁺+6 ratio of 12.9:3.22 is ~4:1, not far from the theoretical 9:1 when accounting for other factors). Although not a perfect match, it is plausible.\n    *   **Fragmentation Pathway:**\n        *   **M⁺• (m/z 260)** loses Cl• to form **[M-Cl]⁺ (m/z 225)**. This is our base peak, containing two Cl atoms. This fits perfectly.\n        *   Let's see if the fragment at m/z 225 loses another chlorine atom. 225 - 35 = 190. The spectrum shows a strong peak at **m/z 190** (I = 48.4%). This corresponds to a fragment with one chlorine atom.\n        *   Let's see if the fragment at m/z 190 loses the last chlorine atom. 190 - 35 = 155. The spectrum shows a peak at **m/z 155** (I = 16.1%). This corresponds to the core non-chlorinated part of the molecule.\n    This sequential loss of three chlorine atoms (260 → 225 → 190 → 155) provides strong evidence for a molecule with a core structure of mass 155 attached to three chlorine atoms.\n\n5.  **Identify the Core Structure and Final Compound:**\n    *   The core fragment (let's call it R) has a mass of 155.\n    *   Since the molecular weight (260) is even and there is no evidence for nitrogen, R is likely composed of C, H, and possibly O. For R to have an odd mass of 155, it must contain an odd number of hydrogen atoms if it's a C, H, O-only fragment.\n    *   A plausible chemical formula for a fragment with mass 155 is **C₁₁H₇O**. (11×12 + 7×1 + 16×1 = 132 + 7 + 16 = 155).\n    *   This suggests the original molecule has the formula **C₁₁H₇Cl₃O**. The nominal mass is 11×12 + 7×1 + 3×35 + 16×1 = 132 + 7 + 105 + 16 = 260. This is consistent.\n    *   A common chemical structure for a parent molecule C₁₁H₁₀O (from which C₁₁H₇Cl₃O would be derived by substituting 3 H with 3 Cl) is **methoxynaphthalene**.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown compound is an isomer of **trichloromethoxynaphthalene**.\n\n6.  **Provide the IUPAC Name:**\n    There are many possible isomers for trichloromethoxynaphthalene. Without further spectroscopic data (like NMR), the exact positions of the chlorine atoms cannot be determined. However, we can provide a valid systematic IUPAC name for one of the possible isomers. A plausible example is **2,3,4-trichloro-1-methoxynaphthalene**.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The compound that corresponds to the mass spectrum is an isomer of trichloromethoxynaphthalene, with the molecular formula C₁₁H₇Cl₃O.\n\n<<<2,3,4-trichloro-1-methoxynaphthalene>>>"
