    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Roman numeral for the circled notes.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key Signature and Key**\nThe piece is Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397. The key signature at the beginning of the piece shows one flat (B♭). This corresponds to the key of D minor or F major. Given the title and the overall tonality, the piece is in D minor. The tonic (the \"I\" chord) is D minor.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Specific Measure and Notes**\nThe question directs us to measure 8. The large red number \"8\" on the left of the staff points to this measure. The circled notes are on the third beat of this measure.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Notes in the Circled Chord**\nWe need to read the notes in both the treble and bass clefs for the circled beat.\n*   **Bass Clef (Left Hand):** The single note is a G on the bottom line of the staff.\n*   **Treble Clef (Right Hand):** There are three notes played together as a chord. From bottom to top, they are B♭ (on the middle line), D (in the fourth space), and F (in the top space).\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Notes to Form the Full Chord**\nWhen we combine all the notes being played simultaneously, we have G, B♭, D, and F.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Chord's Root, Quality, and Inversion**\nTo identify the chord, we can stack these notes into thirds:\n*   The lowest note that allows the others to stack in thirds above it is G.\n*   G to B♭ is a minor third.\n*   G to D is a perfect fifth.\n*   G to F is a minor seventh.\n*   This combination of intervals (root, minor third, perfect fifth, minor seventh) forms a **G minor seventh chord (Gm7)**.\n*   The note in the bass is G, which is the root of the chord. Therefore, the chord is in **root position**.\n\n**Step 6: Assign the Roman Numeral**\nNow we relate the G minor seventh chord back to our home key of D minor.\n*   We need to find the scale degree of the chord's root (G) in the D minor scale (D, E, F, G, A, B♭, C).\n*   G is the fourth scale degree (D=1, E=2, F=3, **G=4**). The Roman numeral for the fourth degree is IV.\n*   In a minor key, the chord built on the fourth degree is typically minor. We use a lowercase Roman numeral to indicate a minor chord: **iv**.\n*   Since the chord is a seventh chord, we add the number \"7\" to the Roman numeral: **iv⁷**.\n*   As determined in Step 5, the chord is in root position, so no additional figures for inversion are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe circled chord consists of the notes G, B♭, D, and F, which form a G minor seventh chord (Gm7). In the key of D minor, G is the subdominant (fourth scale degree), and the resulting chord is the subdominant minor seventh chord.\n\n<<<iv⁷>>>"
