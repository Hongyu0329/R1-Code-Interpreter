    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each artwork:\n\n**Artwork 1 (Top-left):**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a figure painting depicting women from an ethnic minority, likely the Yi people, recognizable by their elaborate cockscomb-like hats. The style combines realistic rendering of the faces with expressive, traditional ink wash techniques for the clothing. A red seal and a signature are visible in the upper right. The signature reads \"邦彦\" (Bāngyàn). This points to the artist **Shi Bangyan (石邦彦)**, who is known for his paintings of Yi people. The title of this specific work is often \"赶场天\" (Gǎn chǎng tiān), meaning \"Market Day\".\n\n**Artwork 2 (Top-center):**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a black-and-white ink sketch of a landscape, likely featuring village houses. The style is highly abstract and linear, reducing the complex forms of buildings and trees to energetic, calligraphic lines and dots. This distinctive style, which bridges Chinese ink tradition and Western modernism, is a hallmark of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**.\n\n**Artwork 3 (Top-right):**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy written in a very dynamic and powerful cursive script (草书, cǎo shū). The energetic, almost frenetic brushstrokes, the dramatic variations in ink wetness, and the continuous flow of characters are characteristic of the modern calligraphy master **Lin Sanzhi (林散之)**.\n\n**Artwork 4 (Middle-left):**\n*   **Analysis:** This is another work of Chinese calligraphy, this time in a clear and elegant semi-cursive script (行书, xíng shū). The signature on the far left is clearly legible as \"启功书\" (Qǐ Gōng shū), meaning \"Written by Qi Gong\". The seals underneath also confirm the artist's identity. The author is **Qi Gong (启功)**, one of the most celebrated calligraphers of the 20th century, known for his unique and graceful style.\n\n**Artwork 5 (Middle-center):**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a highly realistic oil painting of a young woman with short hair, dressed in a simple white shirt, holding a paintbrush. It is one of the most iconic works of Chinese contemporary art. This painting is titled \"Youth\" (or \"The Sketcher\") and was painted by **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**, a leading figure of the Neoclassical Realism movement in China.\n\n**Artwork 6 (Middle-right):**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a painting of a woman in traditional costume with a large headdress, surrounded by sparrows in autumn leaves. The style is highly recognizable, featuring an elegantly stylized female figure with elongated features, flattened planes of color, and a lyrical, decorative quality. This unique fusion of Western Fauvism/Modernism with Chinese ink painting elements is the signature style of **Lin Fengmian (林風眠)**.\n\n**Artwork 7 (Bottom-left):**\n*   **Analysis:** This work depicts a vibrant courtyard scene with hanging luffa gourds and laundry. The style uses thick, bright colors, bold patterns, and a flattened perspective to create a rich, decorative composition. This focus on rural life, geometric forms, and the synthesis of Western color theory with Chinese ink is characteristic of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**. The signature in the bottom left, \"荼\" (Tú), is one of his art names, and the date \"一九九二\" (1992) is also visible.\n\n**Artwork 8 (Bottom-center):**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a monumental landscape painting (山水画, shānshuǐhuà) showing a river gorge with a fleet of boats. The technique involves building up dense, dark layers of ink to create a sense of weight, depth, and solemnity. This powerful and innovative approach to landscape painting, often depicting grand revolutionary or natural sites, is the signature style of **Li Keran (李可染)**.\n\n**Artwork 9 (Bottom-right):**\n*   **Analysis:** This is an ink painting of a single lobster. The brushwork is minimal yet powerful, capturing the creature's form and vitality with remarkable spontaneity and skill. Painting aquatic life like shrimp, crabs, and lobsters with such lively and calligraphic brushwork was the most famous specialty of **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**, one of the most renowned modern Chinese painters.\n\n---\nBased on the analysis, the authors of the 9 works from left to right, top to bottom are:\n\n1.  Shi Bangyan (石邦彦)\n2.  Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)\n3.  Lin Sanzhi (林散之)\n4.  Qi Gong (启功)\n5.  Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)\n6.  Lin Fengmian (林風眠)\n7.  Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)\n8.  Li Keran (李可染)\n9.
