    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Determine its Molecular Formula:**\n    *   The starting material is a bicyclic lactam. The core structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one skeleton.\n    *   This skeleton has a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group on the double bond and a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group on the nitrogen atom.\n    *   Let's count the atoms to determine the molecular formula:\n        *   **Bicyclic Core:** It contains 6 carbon atoms (C1, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7), 1 nitrogen atom (N2), and 1 oxygen atom (in the C=O group).\n        *   **Substituents on the core:**\n            *   A CF3 group is attached to one of the carbons of the double bond (let's say C5). This group adds 1 carbon and 3 fluorine atoms.\n            *   Let's count hydrogens on the substituted core: C1(H), C4(H), C6(H), C7(H2). Total core hydrogens = 5.\n            *   So far, the formula for the bicyclic part is C7H5F3NO.\n        *   **PMB group:** The p-methoxybenzyl group has the formula -CH2-C6H4-OCH3.\n            *   Carbon atoms in PMB: 1 (from CH2) + 6 (from benzene ring) + 1 (from OCH3) = 8 carbons.\n            *   Hydrogen atoms in PMB: 2 (from CH2) + 4 (from C6H4) + 3 (from OCH3) = 9 hydrogens.\n            *   Oxygen atoms in PMB: 1.\n            *   Formula of PMB group: C8H9O.\n        *   **Total Molecular Formula of Starting Material:** We combine the bicyclic part (C7H5F3NO) and the PMB group (C8H9O).\n            *   C: 7 + 8 = 15\n            *   H: 5 + 9 = 14\n            *   F: 3\n            *   N: 1\n            *   O: 1 (carbonyl) + 1 (PMB) = 2\n            *   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Reaction: Formation of Intermediate 1**\n    *   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Oxidative deprotection. CAN is a standard reagent for removing the PMB protecting group from nitrogen atoms.\n    *   **Transformation:** The N-PMB bond is cleaved, and the PMB group is removed. The nitrogen atom becomes bonded to a hydrogen atom (N-H).\n    *   **Change in Molecular Formula:** We remove the PMB group (C8H9O) and add one hydrogen atom.\n        *   Change: -C8, -H9, -O1, +H1.\n        *   Net change: -C8, -H8, -O1.\n    *   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 1:** C(15-8)H(14-8)F3N(1)O(2-1) = **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Reaction: Formation of Intermediate 2**\n    *   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 in MeOH.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Catalytic hydrogenation.\n    *   **Transformation:** This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) to a single bond (C-C) by adding two hydrogen atoms. The lactam (amide) carbonyl group is resistant to these mild hydrogenation conditions.\n    *   **Change in Molecular Formula:** Two hydrogen atoms are added to the molecule.\n        *   Change: +H2.\n    *   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 2:** C(7)H(6+2)F3N(1)O(1) = **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Third Reaction: Formation of the Final Product**\n    *   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n    *   **Reaction Type:** Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.\n    *   **Transformation:** These conditions cause the hydrolysis of the lactam (a cyclic amide). The amide bond (C-N) within the ring is cleaved. A molecule of water (H2O) is consumed in this process, opening the ring to form a carboxylic acid (-COOH) from the carbonyl group and an amino group (-NH2) from the nitrogen atom. The product is an amino acid. Under the acidic conditions (HCl), the amino group will be protonated to an ammonium group (-NH3+). However, for calculating the molecular formula, we consider the neutral form.\n    *   **Change in Molecular Formula:** One molecule of water (H2O) is added to Intermediate 2.\n        *   Change: +H2, +O1.\n    *   **Molecular Formula of the Final Product:** C(7)H(8+2)F3N(1)O(1+1) = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\n**Summary of Atom Count Changes:**\n*   **Start:** C15H14F3NO2\n*   **Step 1 (-PMB, +H):** -> C7H6F3NO\n*   **Step 2 (+H2):** -> C7H8F3NO\n*   **Step 3 (+H2O):** -> C7H10F3NO2\n\nThe final product is a trifluoromethyl-substituted amino-cyclopentanecarboxylic acid with the molecular formula C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
