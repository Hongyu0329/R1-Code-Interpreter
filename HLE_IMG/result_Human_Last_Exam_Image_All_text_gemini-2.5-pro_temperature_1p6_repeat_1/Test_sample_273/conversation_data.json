    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chiral Centers**\n\nA chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. We can identify three such centers in the given molecule. For clarity, let's number them from left to right based on their position in the main carbon chain shown.\n\n*   **C2:** The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl (-OH) group.\n*   **C3:** The carbon atom bonded to the ethyl (-CH2CH3) group.\n*   **C4:** The carbon atom bonded to both a methyl (-CH3) group and an aminomethyl (-CH2NH2) group.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Absolute Configuration of C2**\n\n1.  **Assign Priorities (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules):** The groups attached to C2 are -OH, -CH3, the rest of the chain at C3 (let's call it -C3), and an implicit hydrogen atom (-H). Priorities are based on atomic number.\n    *   Priority 1: -OH (Oxygen, Z=8)\n    *   Priority 2: -C3 (This carbon is attached to other carbons)\n    *   Priority 3: -CH3 (This carbon is attached only to hydrogens)\n    *   Priority 4: -H (Hydrogen, Z=1)\n\n2.  **Analyze Stereochemistry:** The drawing shows both the -OH group and the -CH3 group on dashed wedges, meaning they point away from the viewer. For a tetrahedral carbon, if two groups point back, the other two groups (-H and -C3) must point forward (towards the viewer) on wedged bonds.\n\n3.  **Determine R/S:** The lowest priority group (-H) is pointing forward. We determine the direction of the sequence 1 -> 2 -> 3 and then reverse the result.\n    *   Viewing the molecule from the front, the path from -OH (1) to -C3 (2) to -CH3 (3) is counter-clockwise.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group is pointing forward, we reverse the assignment. Counter-clockwise (S) becomes **R**.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C2 is **R**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Absolute Configuration of C3**\n\n1.  **Assign Priorities:** The groups attached to C3 are the part of the chain towards C2 (-C2), the part towards C4 (-C4), an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), and an implicit hydrogen atom (-H).\n    *   Priority 1: -C2 (-CH(OH)CH3). The carbon is attached to an Oxygen (high atomic number).\n    *   Priority 2: -C4 (-CH(CH3)CH2NH2). The carbon is attached to two other carbons.\n    *   Priority 3: -CH2CH3 (Ethyl). The carbon is attached to one other carbon.\n    *   Priority 4: -H\n\n2.  **Analyze Stereochemistry:** The drawing shows the ethyl group on a solid wedge (pointing forward). The C2-C3 and C3-C4 bonds are in the plane of the drawing. This implies the fourth group, -H, must be on a dashed wedge (pointing away).\n\n3.  **Determine R/S:** The lowest priority group (-H) is pointing away. This is the standard orientation for assignment. We trace the path from 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   The path from -C2 (1) to -C4 (2) to -Ethyl (3) is clockwise.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group is pointing away, the configuration is directly given by this direction. Clockwise is **R**.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C3 is **R**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Absolute Configuration of C4**\n\n1.  **Assign Priorities:** The groups attached to C4 are -CH2NH2, -CH3, the rest of the chain at C3 (-C3), and an implicit hydrogen atom (-H).\n    *   Priority 1: -CH2NH2 (The carbon is attached to a Nitrogen, Z=7).\n    *   Priority 2: -C3 (The carbon is attached to other carbons, Z=6).\n    *   Priority 3: -CH3 (The carbon is attached only to hydrogens).\n    *   Priority 4: -H\n\n2.  **Analyze Stereochemistry:** The drawing shows the -CH2NH2 group on a solid wedge (forward) and the -CH3 group on a dashed wedge (away). The -C3 and -H groups are depicted as being in the plane of the drawing.\n\n3.  **Determine R/S:** The lowest priority group (-H) is in the plane. To assign the configuration, we can mentally swap it with the group that is pointing away (-CH3).\n    *   **Swap:** Swap -H (priority 4) and -CH3 (priority 3). The new hypothetical molecule has -H pointing away and -CH3 in the plane where -H was.\n    *   **Assign:** In this new arrangement, with -H in the back, we trace the path 1 -> 2 -> 3. The path from -CH2NH2 (1, forward) to -C3 (2, in plane) to -CH3 (3, in plane) is clockwise. This means the hypothetical molecule has an R configuration.\n    *   **Reverse:** Since we performed one swap, the actual molecule has the opposite configuration. R becomes **S**.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C4 is **S**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer**\n\nCombining the configurations for the three chiral centers from left to right (C2, C3, C4):\n*   C2 is **R**\n*   C3 is **R**\n*   C4 is **S**\n\nThe absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3R, 4S).\n\n<<(2R, 3R, 4S)>>"
