The final product is a symmetrical, cage-like polycyclic aromatic cation formed by the initial hydrolysis of all six methoxy groups to hydroxyl groups, followed by a triple acid-catalyzed cyclodehydration reaction. This cascade creates three fused xanthene systems, resulting in a trioxatriptycene-like core with a central carbocation. The three hydroxyl groups from the C3 positions remain as substituents on the structure. A drawing of the molecule is provided in the detailed explanation above.
