No. The framework describes salience as being shaped by four components: Access, Prominence, Simplicity, and Clarity. All four of these components are defined as properties of the simulation or the information within it (e.g., physical availability, audiovisual cues, complexity of data), not as characteristics of the individual learner. The provided text and diagram do not include or account for the learner's individual differences as a factor that determines salience.
