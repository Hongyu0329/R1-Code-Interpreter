    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the runestone:\n\n1.  **Analyze the image's key features**: The image displays a section of a runestone with runes carved into a distinct grid-like pattern. The inscription is organized into horizontal bands separated by incised lines. The characters are runes from the Younger Futhark script, and the 'x' symbol is used as a word or section separator.\n\n2.  **Identify the category of runestone**: The question specifies that this is an \"Ingvar runestone\". This refers to a specific group of about 30 runestones erected in memory of those who participated in the Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled in the early 11th century.\n\n3.  **Transcribe the visible runes**: Let's attempt to read the runes in each visible row, moving from left to right. We'll use the Younger Futhark system for transliteration.\n\n    *   **Top Row**: The runes visible in the top band appear to be `...r n i x k a f u`. This transliterates from the runes ...ᚱᚾᛁ x ᚴᛅᚠᚢ. In Old Norse, this would be `...rni : kafu`. This likely represents the end of the phrase *arni gāfu* (\"gave to the eagle\"), a common kenning for killing enemies in battle.\n\n    *   **Middle Row**: The runes in this row are clearly `x t u u x`. This transliterates from the runes x ᛏᚢᚢ x. In Old Norse, this would be `: tūu :` which corresponds to the word *dōttu* or *dóu* (\"they died\").\n\n    *   **Bottom Row**: The runes here read `x s u n a r x`. This transliterates from x ᛋᚢᚾᛅᚱ x, which in Old Norse is `: sunar :`. This is part of the word *sunnarla* (\"in the south\").\n\n4.  **Synthesize the transcribed text**: Piecing the rows together, we get a narrative fragment: \"...gave to the eagle. They died in the south...\" This is a very common theme on memorial runestones, especially the Ingvar stones, which describe the ill-fated expedition.\n\n5.  **Match the text and style to a specific Ingvar Runestone**: The unique grid-like style (classified as Pr 5 or \"Profile style 5\") and the transcribed text can be used for identification. The most famous Ingvar runestone featuring this style and text is the Gripsholm Runestone.\n\n6.  **Verify with the Gripsholm Runestone inscription**: The inscription on the Gripsholm Runestone ends with the following lines:\n    *   `... austarla : arni : kafu :` (...in the East, gave to the eagle)\n    *   `: tuu : sunarla : a : sirklandi :` (died in the south, in Serkland [the land of the Saracens/Arabs])\n\n    Our transcription perfectly matches the final part of this inscription:\n    *   The top row in the image shows `...rni : kafu`.\n    *   The middle row shows `: tuu :`.\n    *   The bottom row shows `: sunar...`, the first part of `sunarla`.\n\n7.  **Identify the Runestone ID**: The Gripsholm Runestone is cataloged in the *Sveriges runinskrifter* (Swedish Runic Inscriptions) project. Its official designation is based on the province it is in, Södermanland (abbreviated as Sö), and its catalog number.\n\nTherefore, the ID of the runestone is Sö 179.\n\n<<<Sö 179>>>"
