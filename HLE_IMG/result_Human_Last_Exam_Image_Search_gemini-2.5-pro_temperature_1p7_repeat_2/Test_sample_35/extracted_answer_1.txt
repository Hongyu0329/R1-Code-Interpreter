Based on the information, the S100B protein exhibits a strong affinity for the V-domain of the RAGE receptor. It should be considered a prognostic marker because its levels directly correlate with and actively contribute to the pathological mechanisms (neuroinflammation, apoptosis, neurodegeneration) that determine the severity and progression of neurological disorders.
