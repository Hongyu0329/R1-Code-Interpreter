    "The element with these spectral lines is **Uranium**.\n\nThe provided image displays a complex emission spectrum with a multitude of fine lines across the visible range. This intricate pattern is a characteristic \"fingerprint\" of the element Uranium. Uranium has a very complex electron structure, which results in a large number of spectral lines. In fact, one atlas of Uranium's emission spectrum lists 4,928 distinct spectral lines.\n\nUranium's spectrum is so dense with lines that it can be used for the wavelength calibration of scientific instruments like spectrographs and lasers. Studies of Uranium's spectral lines have also been used for purposes such as analyzing isotopic composition.\n\n<<<Uranium>>>"
