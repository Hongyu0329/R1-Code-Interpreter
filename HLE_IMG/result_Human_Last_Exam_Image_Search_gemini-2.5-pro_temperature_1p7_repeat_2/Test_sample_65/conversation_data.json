    "The bryophyte in the image is characterized by its light, bright green, feathery shoots that are regularly and pinnately branched. The branches become shorter towards the tip of the shoot, creating an appearance similar to a small fern frond or a feather. The leaves are strongly curved to one side, a feature known as falcate-secund, and are also strongly pleated.\n\nThis distinctive appearance is characteristic of the species *Ptilium crista-castrensis*, commonly known as knight's plume moss or ostrich-plume feather moss. This moss belongs to the order Hypnales. Therefore, the scientific name of the genus to which this plant belongs is *Ptilium*.\n\nOther moss genera, such as *Hypnum*, also have curved, or falcate-secund, leaves. However, the highly regular, comb-like, pinnate branching that gives the \"ostrich-plume\" look is a hallmark of *Ptilium crista-castrensis*.\n\n<<<Ptilium>>>"
