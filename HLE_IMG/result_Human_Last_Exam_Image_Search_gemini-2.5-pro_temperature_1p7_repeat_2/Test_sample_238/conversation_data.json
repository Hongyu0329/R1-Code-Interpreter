    "The black organism in the photo, which appears as small, pin-like structures growing on the larger shelf fungus, is a type of slime mold, likely **_Hemitrichia calyculata_**, commonly known as the Push Pin Slime Mold.\n\nKey identifying features from the image and search results are:\n\n*   **Appearance**: The organism presents as tiny, dark, stalked structures. This matches the description of the fruiting bodies of *Hemitrichia calyculata*, which are stalked sporangia, typically 1-3 mm tall with slender, reddish-brown to black stalks. The \"pin\" head, or sporotheca, can range from yellow to brown.\n*   **Habitat**: This slime mold is commonly found growing on decaying wood and other fungi. The photo clearly shows it growing on a polypore, or bracket fungus.\n*   **Classification**: While they resemble fungi, slime molds (Myxomycetes) are not true fungi but belong to the kingdom Protista. They play a role as decomposers in their ecosystem.\n\nIt's worth noting that other organisms can have a similar appearance. Black pin mold, for instance, is a type of fungus from the genera *Mucor* or *Rhizopus* that also forms pin-like structures. However, the distinct cup-like shape of the head (calyculus) and its specific habitat growing on other fungi strongly point towards *Hemitrichia calyculata*.\n\n<<<Hemitrichia calyculata>>>"
