    "The circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, form an E major chord, which functions as a secondary dominant. In the key of D minor, this chord is the dominant of the dominant, or V/V.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n*   **Key Signature:** The piece is in D minor.\n*   **Circled Notes (Measure 8):** The notes played are E in the bass, and G-sharp and B in the treble, which together constitute an E major triad.\n*   **Harmonic Function:** An E major chord is not diatonic to the key of D minor. Its function is to lead to the chord of A major. The A major chord is the dominant (V) of D minor.\n*   **Resolution (Measure 9):** The chord in measure 8 resolves to an A major chord in measure 9, which serves as the dominant of the home key.\n*   **Roman Numeral:** The E major chord acts as the dominant of the A major chord. Since the A major chord is the V of D minor, the E major chord is the dominant of the V chord. This relationship is notated as V/V (read as \"five of five\"). One analysis describes the progression as a \"downwards movement from Gm - Fm - Eb - E (Which is 'dominant of dominant') and then at last A.\"\n\nTherefore, the accurate Roman numeral for the chord is V/V.\n<<<V/V>>>"
