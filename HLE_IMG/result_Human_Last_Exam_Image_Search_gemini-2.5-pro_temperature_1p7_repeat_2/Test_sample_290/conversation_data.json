    "The image was likely taken at Chambers Creek Regional Park in University Place, Washington. This 930-acre park features over two miles of saltwater shoreline on the Puget Sound, with views of the mountains.\n\nKey features in the image match the description of the park. The park has a beach accessible via a pedestrian overpass that crosses railroad tracks, which are often bordered by chain-link fences for safety. The presence of a bonfire is consistent with beach activities, though specific regulations may vary. Some Seattle-area parks, like Golden Gardens and Alki Beach, have designated fire pits, and beach fire rules are updated seasonally.\n\nChambers Creek Regional Park is located in University Place, near Tacoma, and offers a variety of amenities including trails and an off-leash dog area on the beach.\n\n<<<University Place, Washington>>>"
