    "The plant in the image is the juvenile form of *Pittosporum turneri*, commonly known as Turner's kohuhu or the tent pole tree. This species is endemic to the central North Island of New Zealand.\n\nThe juvenile plant is characterized by its glossy, leathery leaves with a distinct net-like pattern of veins, as seen in the photograph. It grows as a cylindrical shrub with interlacing branches. As the plant matures, its foliage changes, and it grows into a tree that can reach up to 8 meters in height.\n\n*Pittosporum turneri* is a rare species, considered nationally vulnerable in New Zealand. It grows on the margins of montane to subalpine forests, often near streams or in frost hollows.\n\n<<<North Island>>>"
