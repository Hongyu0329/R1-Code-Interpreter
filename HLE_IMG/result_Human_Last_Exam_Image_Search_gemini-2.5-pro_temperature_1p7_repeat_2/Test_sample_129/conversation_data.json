    "Based on a structural analysis, the image displays the **Human Growth Hormone bound to a single receptor**. This structure is registered in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the ID **1A22**.\n\nThe complex consists of two main parts derived from *Homo sapiens*:\n*   **Human Growth Hormone (hGH)**: The larger, dark blue portion of the structure. It is classified as an all-alpha protein, specifically a long-chain cytokine.\n*   **Extracellular Domain of the Growth Hormone Receptor**: The smaller, light blue portion. This part is classified as an all-beta protein with an immunoglobulin-like fold.\n\nThe specific structure shown is of a G120R mutant of hGH, which acts as an antagonist and binds to only one molecule of the receptor's extracellular domain. This structural information helps in understanding the molecular details of how the hormone recognizes its receptor.\n\n<<<Human Growth Hormone bound to its receptor>>>"
