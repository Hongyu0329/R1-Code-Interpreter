    Identifies the genus of the epiphytic species based on visual characteristics.
    The organism in the image exhibits a flat, ribbon-like body (thallus) that
    repeatedly forks into two identical branches (dichotomous branching).
    This creates a distinctive net-like pattern on the tree bark.
    
    This morphology is highly characteristic of the liverwort genus Metzgeria.
