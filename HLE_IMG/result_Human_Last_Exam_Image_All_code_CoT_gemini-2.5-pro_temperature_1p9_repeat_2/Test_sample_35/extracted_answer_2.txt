The protein S100B binds with strong affinity to the extracellular V, C1, and C2 domains of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE). S100B could be utilized as a prognostic marker because its overexpression directly activates signaling pathways (RAGE-NFÎºB and RAGE-JNK/JUN) that lead to the core pathological features of neurological disorders, including neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Therefore, its levels directly reflect the severity and progression of the disease, allowing for a prediction of the patient's future outcome.
