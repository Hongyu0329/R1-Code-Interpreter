    "This image displays a typical North Atlantic rocky intertidal community. To pinpoint the location as Atlantic rather than Pacific, we need to identify a species exclusive to the Atlantic coast.\n\n1.  **Observe the organisms:** The photo shows a variety of invertebrates on a wet rock surface. We can clearly see:\n    *   Numerous acorn barnacles (sessile crustaceans).\n    *   Two larger, light-colored predatory snails (likely Dog Whelks).\n    *   Several smaller, dark, rounded snails (periwinkles).\n    *   Many very small, grey, dot-like snails.\n\n2.  **Analyze distributions:** While many barnacle and whelk species have counterparts on both coasts, one of the snails present is a key indicator. The small, dark, rounded snails are identifiable as the common periwinkle.\n\n3.  **Identify the key species:** The common periwinkle's scientific name is *Littorina littorea*. This species is native to the northeastern Atlantic coast of Europe. It was introduced to the Atlantic coast of North America in the 19th century and has since become extremely widespread and abundant from Canada to Maryland. Crucially, it is not established on the Pacific coast of North America.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The presence of *Littorina littorea* in this intertidal scene is a definitive sign that the photograph was taken on a shore of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe following Python code will print the scientific name of this indicator species.\n\n```python\ndef find_indicator_species():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the species in the image that indicates an Atlantic coast location.\n    \n    The image contains several small, dark, rounded snails known as the common periwinkle.\n    This species, Littorina littorea, is abundant on the North Atlantic coasts of both\n    Europe and North America (where it is an introduced species).\n    It is not found on the Pacific coast of North America.\n    Therefore, its presence is a definitive indicator of an Atlantic location.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The scientific name of the Common Periwinkle.\n    scientific_name = \"Littorina littorea\"\n    \n    print(f\"The scientific name of the indicator species is: {scientific_name}\")\n\nfind_indicator_species()\n```\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
