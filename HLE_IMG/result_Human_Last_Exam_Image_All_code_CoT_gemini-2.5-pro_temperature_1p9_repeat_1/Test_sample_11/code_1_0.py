    This function solves the flag puzzle.
    
    The visible flag segment has three horizontal stripes: black, white, and red.
    This could historically be the German Empire.
    However, a common quiz trick is to show a current country's flag upside down.
    The flag of Yemen consists of red, white, and black horizontal stripes.
    When flipped upside down, it matches the black, white, and red pattern shown.
    Therefore, the country is likely Yemen.
