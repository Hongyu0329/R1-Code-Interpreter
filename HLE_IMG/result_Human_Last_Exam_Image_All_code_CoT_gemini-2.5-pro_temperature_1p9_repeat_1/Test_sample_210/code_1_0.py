    This function identifies the correct image by comparing key features.

    1.  The target nyala has a unique pattern of three white spots on its lower flank, forming a distinct triangle.
    2.  Image A is a younger male with different features.
    3.  Image B perfectly matches the three-spot triangle pattern on the flank of the target.
    4.  Image C has a different coat color and stripe pattern.
    5.  Image D and E have different spot patterns on their flanks.
    6.  Image F has horns with a slightly different shape.

    Therefore, image B shows the same nyala as the target.
