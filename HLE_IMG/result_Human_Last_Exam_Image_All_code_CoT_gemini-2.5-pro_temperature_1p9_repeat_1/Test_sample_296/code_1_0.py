# This python script will print the identified Russian idiom.
# The idiom is identified by analyzing the two drawings.
# The first drawing is a pun on the word "булочная" (bakery) by showing men breaking "булыжник" (cobblestone).
# The second drawing illustrates the meaning: not to take a taxi for a trivial matter like going to a bakery.
