    "Based on the melody, chord progression, and overall style of the provided sheet music, I can identify the song.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Music:** The music is written in a 4/4 time signature and features a syncopated, eighth-note-heavy melody. The harmony consists of chords like C, E7, F, and G7, which are common in jazz. The use of altered chords and the complex melodic line are characteristic of the Bebop and Hard Bop eras of jazz.\n*   **Identification:** The first bar of the melody (E, E, D, C over a C major chord) followed by the second bar (C, D, E, F#, G over an E7 chord) is the opening signature phrase of the jazz standard \"Joya\".\n*   **Composer and Origin:** \"Joya\" was composed by the American jazz trumpeter Kenny Dorham, a prominent figure in the Hard Bop movement.\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   **Title:** Joya\n    *   **Musical Style:** Hard Bop / Jazz\n    *   **Country of Origin:** USA\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef get_song_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides information about the song based on the provided sheet music.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_details = {\n        \"Title\": \"Joya\",\n        \"Musical Style\": \"Hard Bop / Jazz\",\n        \"Country of Origin\": \"USA\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Title: \" + song_details[\"Title\"])\n    print(\"Musical Style: \" + song_details[\"Musical Style\"])\n    print(\"Country of Origin: \" + song_details[\"Country of Origin\"])\n\n    # This part is just to fulfill the \"final answer format\" requirement,\n    # the main answer is printed above.\n    final_answer_data = {\n        \"title\": song_details[\"Title\"],\n        \"style\": song_details[\"Musical Style\"],\n        \"origin\": song_details[\"Country of Origin\"]\n    }\n    return json.dumps(final_answer_data)\n\n# Execute the function to print the song information\nsong_info_json = get_song_info()\n# The final answer is constructed from the data and formatted as requested.\n# final_answer_string = f\"<<<Title: {json.loads(song_info_json)['title']}, Musical Style: {json.loads(song_info_json)['style']}, Country of Origin: {json.loads(song_info_json)['origin']}>>>\"\n# print(final_answer_string)\n```\n<<<Title: Joya, Musical Style: Hard Bop / Jazz, Country of Origin: USA>>>"
