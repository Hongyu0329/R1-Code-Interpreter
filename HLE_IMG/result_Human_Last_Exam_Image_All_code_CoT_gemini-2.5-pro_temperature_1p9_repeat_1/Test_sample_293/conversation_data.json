    "This is a photomicrograph of a kidney glomerulus stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E).\n\n**Histopathological Findings:**\n\n1.  **Glomerular Crescent:** The most prominent feature is a large, crescent-shaped, cellular proliferation that fills Bowman's space (the space between the glomerular capillary tuft and the outer capsule). This structure is known as a \"crescent.\"\n2.  **Cellularity:** The crescent is composed of numerous packed cells, which include proliferating parietal epithelial cells, infiltrating inflammatory cells (like macrophages), and fibroblasts, along with fibrin deposits.\n3.  **Glomerular Tuft:** The underlying glomerular tuft is compressed and appears hypercellular.\n4.  **Clinical Correlation:** This histological pattern is the hallmark of a severe form of glomerular injury, which clinically manifests as Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN).\n\n**Diagnosis:**\n\nBased on the extensive cellular crescent formation, the diagnosis is Crescentic Glomerulonephritis.\n\n<<<Crescentic glomerulonephritis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the histopathological diagnosis of this image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
