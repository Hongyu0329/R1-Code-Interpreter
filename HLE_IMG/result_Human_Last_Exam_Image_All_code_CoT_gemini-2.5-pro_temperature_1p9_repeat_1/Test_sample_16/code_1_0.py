    """
    This script analyzes the provided insect wings to determine the trophic level of each.

    The analysis proceeds as follows:
    1.  Wing A is identified as belonging to a parasitoid wasp (Order: Hymenoptera).
    2.  Wing B is identified as belonging to a hoverfly (Family: Syrphidae), whose larvae are predators.
    3.  Wing C is identified as a true bug's hemelytron (Order: Hemiptera), which can be either predatory or herbivorous.
    4.  By matching the firm identifications of A and B against the options, the correct choice is determined.

    # Step 1: Analyze Wing A
    # Description: Hymenopteran wing with a prominent pterostigma and characteristic closed cells.
    # This venation is typical of families like Ichneumonidae or Braconidae.
    # Family Trophic Level: These families are overwhelmingly composed of parasitoids.
    wing_a_id = "Hymenoptera (e.g., Ichneumonidae)"
    wing_a_trophic_level = "Parasitoid"

    # Step 2: Analyze Wing B
    # Description: Dipteran wing with features of the family Syrphidae (hoverflies),
    # such as the vena spuria and curved apical veins.
    # Family Trophic Level: While adults are nectarivores, many larvae are aphid predators.
    # The highest trophic level is predator.
    wing_b_id = "Diptera (Syrphidae)"
    wing_b_trophic_level = "Predator"

    # Step 3: Analyze Wing C
    # Description: A hemelytron, the characteristic forewing of a true bug (Order: Hemiptera, Suborder: Heteroptera),
    # with a leathery base and membranous tip.
    # Family Trophic Level: This order contains many herbivorous families (e.g., Miridae) and predatory families (e.g., Reduviidae).
    # Its identity is resolved by examining the answer choices.
    wing_c_id = "Hemiptera (Heteroptera)"
    wing_c_trophic_level = "Herbivore" # Deduced from the options available.

    # Step 4: Synthesize results and find the correct option.
    # The combination of A='Parasitoid' and B='Predator' is unique to one answer choice.
    # This choice identifies C as 'Herbivore', which is a common role for Hemiptera.
    # The matching choice is E.
