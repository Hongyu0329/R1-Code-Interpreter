    "This is a fascinating data puzzle. To figure out the country, I will analyze the significant peaks in the Google Trends data and correlate them with major historical events that occurred between late 2019 and mid-2023.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Blue Line:** Identify the prominent spike and its timing.\n2.  **Analyze the Yellow Line:** Identify its three major spikes and their timings.\n3.  **Analyze the Red Line:** Observe its pattern of frequent, sharp spikes, focusing on the largest ones.\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings:** Correlate these dated events with a single country's recent history.\n5.  **Write a Python Script:** Create a simple script to print the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n*   **Blue Line Peak (Late May/Early June 2020):** This prominent, sharp spike corresponds directly to the widespread protests that erupted across the United States following the death of George Floyd on May 25, 2020. The smaller peaks around the same time in subsequent years likely correspond to anniversaries of the event.\n\n*   **Yellow Line Peaks:**\n    *   **January 2021:** This peak aligns with the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol, a major political and historical event in the United States.\n    *   **September 2022:** This aligns with the death of Queen Elizabeth II. While a British event, it generated immense and prolonged search interest in the U.S.\n    *   **June 2023:** This massive peak, the highest on the chart, corresponds to the intense global media coverage of the Titan submersible incident near the Titanic wreckage. This event dominated search trends in the U.S.\n\n*   **Red Line Peaks:** This line shows multiple, recurring spikes, which is characteristic of search interest in response to recurring tragic events, such as mass shootings, or other major breaking news.\n    *   **Late January/Early February 2020:** The largest early spike corresponds with the death of basketball star Kobe Bryant on January 26, 2020, an event that deeply impacted the U.S.\n    *   **May 2022:** This peak aligns with the tragic school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe events—the George Floyd protests, the Capitol attack, and the specific national tragedies and news phenomena—are all exceptionally significant events within the recent history of the **United States**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the country identified from the Google Trends data analysis.\n    \n    The analysis of the trend peaks points to a specific country:\n    - Blue Peak (late May 2020): George Floyd protests.\n    - Yellow Peak (Jan 2021): U.S. Capitol attack.\n    - Yellow Peak (June 2023): Titan submersible incident.\n    - Red Peak (Jan 2020): Death of Kobe Bryant.\n    - Red Peak (May 2022): Uvalde school shooting.\n    \n    These are all major events in recent American history.\n    \"\"\"\n    country = \"United States\"\n    print(country)\n\nsolve_puzzle()\n```\n<<<United States>>>"
