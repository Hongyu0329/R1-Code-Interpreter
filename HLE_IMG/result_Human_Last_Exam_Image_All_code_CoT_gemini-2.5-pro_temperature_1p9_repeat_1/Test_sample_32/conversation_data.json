    "Based on botanical descriptions, the most significant and easily observable difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* lies in the seta (the stalk that supports the capsule).\n\n*   ***Grimmia montana*** has a very short, **straight** seta. This results in the spore capsule being held upright (erect) and appearing immersed or barely emergent among the leaves.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta*** is named for its defining characteristic: a **curved** seta (*curvi* + *seta*). This curved stalk causes the capsule to be nodding or hanging downwards.\n\nThis difference in the seta's shape and the resulting capsule orientation is the primary way to distinguish the two species at a glance when they are fertile.\n\n```python\ndef explain_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the main sporophyte difference between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Distinguishing Feature between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta\"\n    print(title)\n    print(\"=\" * len(title))\n\n    distinction_point = \"The primary difference lies in the seta (the capsule stalk) and the resulting orientation of the capsule.\"\n    \n    g_montana_desc = \"\"\"\n    Grimmia montana:\n    - Seta: Short and STRAIGHT.\n    - Capsule Orientation: Held upright (erect) and is typically immersed or only slightly emergent above the leaves.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    g_curviseta_desc = \"\"\"\n    Grimmia curviseta:\n    - Seta: Distinctly CURVED or arcuate (as the name 'curviseta' suggests).\n    - Capsule Orientation: Nodding or hanging downwards, often nestled within the leaves due to the curved stalk.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    summary = \"\\nIn summary, at a glance, you can distinguish them by looking for an UPRIGHT capsule (G. montana) versus a HANGING/NODDING capsule (G. curviseta).\"\n\n    print(distinction_point)\n    print(g_montana_desc)\n    print(g_curviseta_desc)\n    print(summary)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    explain_difference()\n```\n<<<The seta of Grimmia curviseta is curved, causing the capsule to hang downwards, while the seta of Grimmia montana is straight, holding the capsule erect.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
