    "This is a piece for solo piano. I can identify it by analyzing its key signature, time signature, tempo, and the characteristic melodic and rhythmic patterns.\n\n*   **Key Signature and Tonality:** It starts with one sharp (F#), suggesting G major or E minor. The first chord played by the left hand in measure 2 is an E minor chord, and the melody centers around notes of the E minor scale, confirming the key is E minor.\n*   **Tempo and Mood:** The tempo is marked at quarter note = 80, a moderate pace. However, the musical content, with its sudden dynamic shifts from *p* (piano) to *f* (forte) and the dense, running sixteenth-note passages, suggests a very dramatic and virtuosic character.\n*   **Distinctive Figures:** The opening two measures present a quiet, questioning motive. This is immediately contrasted in measure 3 with loud, powerful chords. From measure 4 onwards, the piece is dominated by rapid, chromatic sixteenth-note figures in both hands. This style is highly characteristic of the Romantic era, particularly the works of Frédéric Chopin or Franz Liszt.\n\nBy comparing these features to well-known piano literature, the piece is identifiable as the beginning of **Frédéric Chopin's Etude Op. 25, No. 5 in E minor**, sometimes nicknamed the \"Wrong Note\" etude due to its intentionally dissonant grace notes.\n\n```python\ndef guess_the_music():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the name of the music identified from the sheet music.\n    \"\"\"\n    composer = \"Frédéric Chopin\"\n    work = \"Etude\"\n    opus = 25\n    number = 5\n    key = \"E minor\"\n    \n    print(f\"The music is: {composer}, {work} Op. {opus}, No. {number} in {key}\")\n\nguess_the_music()\n```\n<<<Frédéric Chopin - Etude Op. 25, No. 5 in E minor>>>"
