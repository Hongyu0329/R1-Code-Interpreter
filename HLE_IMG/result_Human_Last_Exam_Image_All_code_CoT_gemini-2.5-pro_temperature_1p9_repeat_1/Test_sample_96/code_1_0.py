# Step 1: Define mathematical constants.
pi = math.pi
sqrt3 = math.sqrt(3)

# Step 2: Calculate the area of intersection (Area(C ∩ R)) in pieces,
# based on the analytical derivation.

# For x in [-2, -1), the area of intersection is the full circle slice.
# The exact value is 4*pi/3 - sqrt(3).
A1 = (4 * pi / 3) - sqrt3

# For x in [-1, 0), the area is under y=1.
# The exact value is 1 + pi/3 + sqrt(3)/2.
A2 = 1 + (pi / 3) + (sqrt3 / 2)

# For x in [0, 1), the area is under y=0.
# The exact value is pi/3 + sqrt(3)/2.
A3 = (pi / 3) + (sqrt3 / 2)

# For x in [1, sqrt(3)), the area is under y=-1.
# The exact value is 1 + pi/3 - sqrt(3).
A4 = 1 + (pi / 3) - sqrt3

# Step 3: Sum the areas to get the total intersection area.
# The symbolic sum is (4pi/3 - sqrt3) + (1 + pi/3 + sqrt3/2) + (pi/3 + sqrt3/2) + (1 + pi/3 - sqrt3)
# = 7*pi/3 + 2 - sqrt3.
Area_intersect = A1 + A2 + A3 + A4

# Step 4: Calculate the final area.
# This is Area(Circle) - Area(C ∩ R) = 4*pi - (7*pi/3 + 2 - sqrt3)
# = 5*pi/3 - 2 + sqrt3.
Area_circle = 4 * pi
Final_Area = Area_circle - Area_intersect

# Step 5: Print the results as requested.
print("The final equation for the required area is: (5/3)*pi + sqrt(3) - 2")
# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
