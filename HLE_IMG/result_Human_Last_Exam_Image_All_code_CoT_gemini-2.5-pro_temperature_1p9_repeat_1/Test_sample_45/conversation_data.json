    "My plan is to determine the rotational symmetry of the provided tiling by identifying the highest order of rotation that leaves the pattern unchanged.\n\n1.  **Analyze the tiling's components**: I will first identify the repeating shapes in the pattern, such as the dark blue hexagons and the light yellow squares. These shapes are strong candidates for centers of rotational symmetry.\n2.  **Test for different orders of symmetry**:\n    *   I will examine the center of a dark blue hexagon. A regular hexagon has 6 sides, suggesting a potential 6-fold rotational symmetry. I'll verify if a rotation of 360/6 = 60 degrees around this point maps the entire tiling onto itself.\n    *   I will then examine the center of a light yellow square. A square has 4 sides, suggesting a potential 4-fold rotational symmetry. I'll check if a rotation of 360/4 = 90 degrees leaves the pattern invariant.\n    *   I will also note other points of symmetry, such as vertices where three tiles meet, which typically have 3-fold symmetry.\n3.  **Determine the highest order**: The question asks for \"the rotational symmetry\", which commonly refers to the highest order of symmetry present in the pattern. I will compare the orders of symmetry found (3-fold, 4-fold, 6-fold) and identify the maximum value.\n4.  **Generate Python code**: I will write a Python script that codifies this reasoning. The script will use `print` statements to explain the concept, show the calculations for the rotation angles for each symmetry type, and state the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the rotational symmetry of the tiling in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the rotational symmetry of the provided tiling.\")\n    print(\"A tiling has n-fold rotational symmetry if it looks the same after being rotated by 360/n degrees.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Analyzing the symmetry around the center of a hexagon\n    hexagon_sides = 6\n    hexagon_angle = 360 / hexagon_sides\n    print(f\"1.
