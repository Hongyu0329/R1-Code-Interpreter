    This function identifies the matching giraffe based on visual pattern analysis.
    The analysis compares the unique spot patterns of the target giraffe
    with the options provided.

    Analysis Steps:
    1. The target giraffe's spot pattern on the shoulder and torso is used as a reference.
    2. This pattern is compared against all options (A, B, C, D, E, F).
    3. Option E shows an identical match in spot shape, size, arrangement, and coloration.
    4. Options A, B, C, D, and F have different patterns and/or coloration.
