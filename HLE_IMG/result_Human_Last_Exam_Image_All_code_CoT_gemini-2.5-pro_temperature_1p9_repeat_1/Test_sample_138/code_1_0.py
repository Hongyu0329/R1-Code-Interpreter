# The analysis of insect pairs determined the following:
# Pair A: The left insect is Male (longer antennae), the right is Female (more robust body). This is index 3 (M, F).
# Pair B: The left insect is Female (straight antennae), the right is Male (curled antennae). This is index 4 (F, M).
# Pair C: The left insect is Male (very long antennae), the right is Female (short antennae). This is index 3 (M, F).

# Assigning the determined indices to variables
index_A = 3
index_B = 4
index_C = 3

# Printing the result in the required format "A, B, C"
print(f"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}")
