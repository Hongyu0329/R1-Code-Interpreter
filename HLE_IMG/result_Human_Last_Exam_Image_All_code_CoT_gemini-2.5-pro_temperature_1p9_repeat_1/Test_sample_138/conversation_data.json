    "I will determine the biological sexes for each pair of insects and then use Python to format the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Pair A:** These appear to be cuckoo bees (e.g., *Triepeolus*). I will look for sexual dimorphism common in this group, such as differences in antennae length and abdomen shape. Male bees often have longer antennae and a more slender abdomen than females.\n2.  **Analyze Pair B:** These are paper wasps (*Polistes*). A key distinguishing feature in many male wasps is that the tips of their antennae are curled or hooked. Females have straight antennae and a visible stinger (ovipositor).\n3.  **Analyze Pair C:** These are long-horned bees (e.g., *Melissodes*). As their name suggests, males are characterized by exceptionally long antennae. Males may also have yellow or white markings on their faces. Females have much shorter antennae.\n4.  **Consolidate Results:** For each pair, I will determine the sexes (Left, Right) and find the corresponding index from the provided list (1: M,M; 2: F,F; 3: M,F; 4: F,M).\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** Write a simple Python script to print the final indices for A, B, and C in the required comma-separated format.\n\n### Analysis:\n*   **Pair A:** The insect on the left has longer, thicker antennae compared to the more robust insect on the right. This suggests the left insect is a male and the right insect is a female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n*   **Pair B:** The wasp on the right clearly shows antennae that are curled at the tip, which is a definitive characteristic of a male wasp in this family. The wasp on the left has straight antennae and a pointed abdomen, indicating it is a female. This corresponds to option **4 (F, M)**.\n*   **Pair C:** The bee on the left has remarkably long antennae that extend far beyond its head, a classic feature of a male long-horned bee. The bee on the right has standard, much shorter antennae, identifying it as a female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation:\n*   A = 3\n*   B = 4\n*   C = 3\n\nThe final result is \"3, 4, 3\". I will now generate the Python code to print this.\n\n```python\n# The analysis of insect pairs determined the following:\n# Pair A: The left insect is Male (longer antennae), the right is Female (more robust body). This is index 3 (M, F).\n# Pair B: The left insect is Female (straight antennae), the right is Male (curled antennae). This is index 4 (F, M).\n# Pair C: The left insect is Male (very long antennae), the right is Female (short antennae). This is index 3 (M, F).\n\n# Assigning the determined indices to variables\nindex_A = 3\nindex_B = 4\nindex_C = 3\n\n# Printing the result in the required format \"A, B, C\"\nprint(f\"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}\")\n```\n<<<3, 4, 3>>>"
