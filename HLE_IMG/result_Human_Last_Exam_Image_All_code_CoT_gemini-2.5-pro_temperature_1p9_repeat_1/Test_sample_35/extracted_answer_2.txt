The S100B protein exhibits a strong affinity for the **V-domain of the RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts) receptor**. Based on the signaling pathway shown, S100B can be used as a **prognostic marker** in the pathology of neurological disorders. Its role extends beyond being a simple adjunct marker because it is not merely associated with the disease state; it actively drives the disease's progression. The binding of S100B to RAGE initiates downstream signaling cascades (including JNK/JUN and NF-ÎºB) that directly lead to apoptosis, neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Consequently, the level of S100B expression can be used to predict the future course and severity of the disease, which is the defining characteristic of a prognostic marker.
