The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE), specifically its extracellular V, C1, and C2 domains. It could be used as a prognostic marker. This is because its overexpression and binding to RAGE directly activate downstream signaling pathways (NFÎºB, JNK/JUN) that lead to pathological outcomes like neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and apoptosis. The levels of S100B, therefore, correlate with the mechanisms driving disease progression, allowing it to predict the future severity and course of the disorder. This predictive capability defines a prognostic marker.
