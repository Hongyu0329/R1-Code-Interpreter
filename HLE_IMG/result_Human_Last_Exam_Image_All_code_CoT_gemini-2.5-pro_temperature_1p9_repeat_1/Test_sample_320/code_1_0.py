def solve_cellular_automaton_puzzle():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the cellular automaton visualization puzzle.

    The solution is derived by:
    1. Determining the required number of patterns for each time step (t=2 to t=8) from the problem statement.
    2. Estimating a minimum time step (`t_min`) for each image based on its size.
    3. Grouping images into four plausible evolutionary sequences based on visual characteristics.
    4. Matching these sequences to the four rules by ensuring consistency with the time step distributions and the `t_min` constraint.
    
    The resulting groups are:
    - Rule 1 (t=2,3,4,5): GLIN
    - Rule 2 (t=3,4,5,6): KJBP
    - Rule 3 (t=4,5,6,7): FDHO
    - Rule 4 (t=5,6,7,8): CMEA
