    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve this riddle:\n1.  **Analyze the first clue:** \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\" The image shows an awards ceremony. A quick search reveals that the 2019 NHL Awards were held on June 19, 2019. The man receiving the award is hockey player Nikita Kucherov. That night, he won three major individual awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy, the Ted Lindsay Award, and the Art Ross Trophy. In sports, achieving three of something significant is famously called a \"hat trick\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the second clue:** \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This points to a historical manufacturing process. Mercury salts were notoriously used in the process of turning fur into felt for hats. This process, called carroting, caused mercury poisoning in the workers, who were known as \"hatters\", leading to the expression \"mad as a hatter\". Thus, the object this clue refers to is a \"felt hat\".\n\n3.  **Synthesize the clues:** The solution is a pun that connects the two clues.\n    *   **Hat**: From Nikita Kucherov's \"hat trick\" of awards.\n    *   **Felt**: From the powerful emotion he surely *felt* upon receiving these honors.\n    *   Putting them together gives the answer: **Felt Hat**.\n\n4.  **Final Check:** The phrase \"Felt Hat\" fits both parts of the riddle perfectly. The concept of a \"Felt Hat\" (emotional feeling + hat trick) is metaphorically pictured, and the literal \"Felt Hat\" (the object) matches the description in the second clue.\n\nThe following Python code will print this logic and construct the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle by breaking it down and explaining the logic.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The two words that form the solution\n    word_x = \"Felt\"\n    word_y = \"Hat\"\n\n    print(\"Solving the riddle by breaking it into parts:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    \n    # Explanation for the first word\n    print(\"Clue 1: An event on June 20, 2019, shows Nikita Kucherov winning a 'hat trick' of 3 NHL awards.\")\n    print(f\"From the emotions of the winner, we can derive the first word X: '{word_x}'\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Explanation for the second word\n    print(\"Clue 2: An object whose manufacturing used toxic mercury salts.\")\n    print(\"This refers to old-fashioned hats, whose felt was treated with mercury.\")\n    print(f\"From the 'hat trick' and the historical clue, we derive the second word Y: '{word_y}'\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    \n    # Final answer composition\n    print(\"Combining the two words gives the final answer.\")\n    print(f\"The final answer is: {word_x} {word_y}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Felt Hat>>>"
