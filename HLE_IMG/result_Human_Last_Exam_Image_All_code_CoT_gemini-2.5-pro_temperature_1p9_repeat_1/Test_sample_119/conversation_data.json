    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structure and IUPAC name of the unknown compound using the provided spectral data.\n\n**1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n*   **Mass Spectrum (MS):** The molecular ion peak (M⁺) is at m/z = 135. The odd molecular weight strongly suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms, likely one (the Nitrogen Rule).\n*   **Formula Calculation:** Based on the NMR data (detailed below), the molecular formula is C₉H₁₃N. Let's verify the mass: (9 × 12.01) + (13 × 1.008) + (1 × 14.007) ≈ 135.16. This matches the MS data.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C₉H₁₃N, the DBE is calculated as: DBE = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 = 9 - (13/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 6.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 4. A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n\n**2. Functional Group Analysis**\n*   **IR Spectrum:** The spectrum shows absorptions for aromatic C-H stretches (>3000 cm⁻¹), aliphatic C-H stretches (<3000 cm⁻¹), and aromatic C=C stretches (~1600 cm⁻¹), confirming the presence of a substituted benzene ring. A broad peak around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ indicates an N-H stretch from an amine.\n*   **¹³C NMR:**\n    *   There are 7 distinct carbon signals. Since the formula is C₉H₁₃N, this indicates some symmetry.\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** Four signals at 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm confirm a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-R). A monosubstituted ring has 6 carbons but only 4 unique chemical environments (ipso, ortho, meta, para).\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** Three signals at 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm for the three carbons in the side chain.\n*   **DEPT-135:**\n    *   This spectrum distinguishes carbon types: CH/CH₃ are positive, CH₂ are negative, and quaternary carbons are absent.\n    *   We are told there is one negative signal (1 x CH₂) and five positive signals (5 x CH/CH₃).\n    *   The carbon at 145.1 ppm does not appear in the DEPT spectrum, confirming it is the quaternary *ipso*-carbon of the benzene ring.\n    *   The remaining three aromatic carbons are CH groups (3 positive signals).\n    *   The three aliphatic carbons must therefore consist of one CH₂ group (the negative signal) and two CH/CH₃ groups (2 positive signals).\n\n**3. Structural Elucidation**\n*   **¹H NMR & HSQC:** We use the proton NMR and the 2D HSQC (which connects protons to their attached carbons) to assemble the structure.\n    *   **C₆H₅- (phenyl group):** A multiplet around 7.2 ppm integrating to 5H, correlating to the aromatic carbons.\n    *   **-CH₃ group:** The ¹H NMR shows a 3H doublet at ~1.2 ppm. A doublet means it is adjacent to a single proton (a CH group). The HSQC links this signal to the ¹³C signal at 19.2 ppm.\n    *   **-CH group:** The ¹H NMR shows a 1H multiplet at ~2.8 ppm. This is the CH group splitting the adjacent CH₃. The HSQC links this proton to the ¹³C signal at 49.6 ppm.\n    *   **-CH₂ group:** The ¹H NMR shows a 2H multiplet at ~2.7 ppm. This corresponds to the CH₂ identified from DEPT. The HSQC links these protons to the ¹³C signal at 43.5 ppm.\n*   **Assembling the Pieces:** The identified fragments are C₆H₅-, -CH-, -CH₂-, -CH₃, and an amine group (-NH₂ to account for the formula C₉H₁₃N).\n    *   The connectivity must be **C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃**.\n    *   This structure, 1-phenylpropan-2-amine, is consistent with all data. The benzylic -CH₂- group corresponds to the C/H signals at 43.5/2.7 ppm. The -CH(NH₂)- group corresponds to the signals at 49.6/2.8 ppm, and the terminal -CH₃ group corresponds to the signals at 19.2/1.2 ppm. The chemical shifts are consistent, as a carbon attached to nitrogen (-CH(NH₂)-) is expected to be further downfield (49.6 ppm) than a benzylic carbon (-CH₂-Ph, 43.5 ppm).\n\nThe following python code outlines the reasoning process.\n\n```python\ndef determine_iupac_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script outlines the step-by-step deduction of the compound's structure\n    and IUPAC name based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation ---\n    print(\"--- Analysis Summary ---\")\n    print(\"\\n1.
