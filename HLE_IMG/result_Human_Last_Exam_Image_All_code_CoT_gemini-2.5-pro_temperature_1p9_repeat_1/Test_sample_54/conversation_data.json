    "Here is a step-by-step plan to identify the unknown reagents A and B in the provided reaction scheme:\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction (1 → 2)**: I will carefully compare the molecular structures of compound 1 and compound 2. The key is to identify the structural change that occurred. This transformation, changing one functional group or atom into another, points directly to the type of reaction and thus the required reagent (A).\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction (2 → 3)**: Similarly, I will compare the structures of compound 2 and compound 3. This transformation appears more complex, involving a rearrangement of the molecular skeleton and the introduction of a new substituent. I will deduce reagent B by identifying the chemical group that has been added to the molecule.\n3.  **Formulate the answer**: Based on the analysis, I will identify reagent A and reagent B.\n4.  **Write the Python code**: I will write a Python script that prints the names and chemical formulas of the identified reagents as the solution.\n\nHere is the python code to solve the problem:\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the names of reagents A and B\n    based on the transformations shown in the provided chemical reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Reagent A: The reaction from compound 1 to 2 involves the conversion of a xanthenylium cation\n    # (which contains a positively charged oxygen atom, O+, in a central ring) to an N-aminoacridinium\n    # cation (where the O+ is replaced by a positively charged nitrogen atom bonded to an amino group, N+-NH2).\n    # This specific transformation is a well-known reaction of pyrylium salts with hydrazine.\n    # Therefore, reagent A is Hydrazine. Its chemical formula is N2H4.\n    reagent_A = \"Hydrazine (N2H4)\"\n\n    # Reagent B: The reaction from compound 2 to 3 shows a skeletal rearrangement from an\n    # acridinium system to a quinacridinium system. Critically, a propyl group (-CH2CH2CH3)\n    # attached to a nitrogen atom is introduced into the molecular structure. The most direct\n    # chemical source for an N-propyl group is propylamine. The reaction is likely a complex\n    # rearrangement initiated by the nucleophilic attack of propylamine.\n    # Therefore, reagent B is Propylamine. Its chemical formula is CH3CH2CH2NH2.\n    reagent_B = \"Propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)\"\n\n    print(\"Reagent A is: Hydrazine (N2H4)\")\n    print(\"Reagent B is: Propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n<<<A is Hydrazine and B is Propylamine.>>>"
