    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, I will determine the theoretical atomic pattern for a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal when viewed along the [110] direction. This involves understanding the FCC structure and how atomic positions are projected onto a 2D plane perpendicular to the viewing direction.\n2.  I will write a Python script to perform this projection computationally. The script will:\n    a. Define the atomic positions in a standard FCC conventional unit cell. To see the repeating pattern clearly, I'll consider a larger supercell (e.g., 2x2x1).\n    b. Define the projection plane. For a [110] viewing direction, the projection plane is the (110) plane. The axes on this plane can be chosen along the `[00-1]` (or `[001]`) and `[1-10]` directions.\n    c. Project the 3D coordinates of each atom onto this 2D plane.\n    d. Print the resulting 2D coordinates.\n3.  Next, I will analyze the generated pattern of 2D coordinates. I expect the pattern to be a \"centered rectangular lattice\". This means the atoms form a grid of rectangles, where each rectangle has an additional atom at its center.\n4.  Finally, I will compare this computationally-derived pattern with the four options (A, B, C, D) provided in the image to find the correct match.\n    *   **Image A** shows a \"dumbbell\" pattern characteristic of the diamond cubic structure ([110] view), not FCC.\n    *   **Image C** shows a disordered pattern with no long-range order, characteristic of an amorphous material.\n    *   **Image D** shows a simple rectangular pattern, without any centering atoms.\n    *   **Image B** shows a pattern of rectangles with atoms at their corners and in their centers, consistent with the expected centered rectangular pattern for FCC [110].\n\nBy following these steps, I can use my coding skills to verify the expected crystallographic pattern and select the correct image.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef generate_fcc_projection_110():\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates and prints the projected atomic positions of an FCC lattice\n    viewed along the [110] direction.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define atomic positions in an FCC supercell.\")\n    # Basis atoms for a conventional FCC unit cell (lattice constant a=1)\n    basis_atoms = [[0, 0, 0], [0.5, 0.5, 0], [0.5, 0, 0.5], [0, 0.5, 0.5]]\n\n    # Generate atoms in a 2x2x2 supercell for a clearer pattern\n    atoms_3d = []\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            for k in range(2):\n                for b in basis_atoms:\n                    atoms_3d.append(np.array(b) + np.array([i, j, k]))\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Project the 3D atomic positions along the [110] direction.\")\n    # The projection plane is perpendicular to [110].
