# Step 1: Define the known values from the conversation.
ry = 0.5  # radius of yellow circle in cm

# Step 2: From the geometric analysis, we deduced the radius of the white circle.
# The condition is that sqrt(rw*ry) must result in a value on the 0.5cm grid system.
# We tested rw=2.0 -> rw*ry = 2.0*0.5 = 1.0, and sqrt(1.0) = 1.0. This fits.
rw = 2.0  # radius of white circle in cm
print(f"Radius of a white circle (rw) = {rw} cm")
print(f"Radius of a yellow circle (ry) = {ry} cm")

# Step 3: Determine the y-coordinate of the center of the bottom row of white circles (y_1).
# This is derived from the tangency of a bottom yellow circle (on y=0 edge) with two white circles.
# The formula is (y_1 - ry)^2 = 2*rw*ry + ry^2
y1 = ry + math.sqrt(2 * rw * ry + ry**2)
print(f"\nThe y-coordinate of the center of the bottom row circles (y_1) is derived from:")
print(f"(y1 - {ry})^2 = 2 * {rw} * {ry} + {ry}^2")
print(f"(y1 - {ry})^2 = {2*rw*ry + ry**2}")
print(f"y1 - {ry} = {math.sqrt(2*rw*ry + ry**2)}")
print(f"y1 = {ry} + {math.sqrt(2*rw*ry + ry**2)} = {y1} cm")

# Step 4: Determine the total width (W) and the long side of the green rectangle (Lg).
# From analyzing the middle and rightmost white circles: W = 9 * rw
W = 9 * rw
# From analyzing the positions of the bottom row circles and rectangles: W - Lg = 6 * rw
Lg = W - 6 * rw
print(f"\nThe total width of the box (W) is derived from W = 9 * rw = 9 * {rw} = {W} cm")
print(f"The long side of a green rectangle (Lg) is {Lg} cm")

# Step 5: Determine the vertical separation (dy) between rows and the y-coordinate of the middle row (y_middle).
# The height of the green rectangle corresponds to the vertical separation of the rows.
dy = Lg
y_middle = y1 + dy
print(f"\nThe vertical separation of row centers (dy) is {dy} cm")
print(f"The y-coordinate of the center of the middle row circles (y_middle) is y1 + dy = {y1} + {dy} = {y_middle} cm")

# Step 6: Determine the coordinates of the center of the right-most white circle.
# This circle is in the middle row and tangent to the right edge of the box.
x_center = W - rw
y_center = y_middle
print(f"\nThe x-coordinate of the center is W - rw = {W} - {rw} = {x_center} cm")
print(f"The y-coordinate of the center is y_middle = {y_center} cm")

print("\nFinal Answer Equation:")
print(f"The center of the right-most white circle is at x = W - rw = {W} - {rw} = {x_center}")
print(f"and y = y1 + Lg = {y1} + {Lg} = {y_center}")
print(f"\nSo the final coordinate is {x_center}:{y_center}")
