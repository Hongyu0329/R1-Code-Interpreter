    Analyzes the provided image to identify the influential early 20th-century theorist.

    # 1. The image is a collage in the style of Surrealism. This is evident from the
    #    juxtaposition of unrelated elements (a postcard, an antelope-headed person,
    #    a disembodied bone, fragmented text) to create a dream-like, illogical scene.

    # 2. Key surrealist themes present in the image include:
    #    - The Unconscious Mind: The overall composition mimics the logic of a dream.
    #    - Hybridity: The central figure is a human-animal hybrid, representing subconscious
    #      desires or psychological states. The text explicitly mentions "developing hybrids."
    #    - Mythology and Psychology: The reference to "Persephone" taps into myth as a source
    #      of deep psychological archetypes, a common surrealist practice.

    # 3. The Surrealist movement, which emerged in the 1920s, drew its core philosophical
    #    and psychological ideas directly from the work of one major theorist. This
    #    theorist's work on dream interpretation and the unconscious was the primary
    #    inspiration for surrealist artists.

    theorist_name = "Sigmund Freud"

    # 4. Formulate the explanation.
    explanation = (
        "The artwork is a collage that clearly draws on the ideas of the Surrealist movement.\n\n"
        "This is demonstrated by its dream-like quality, the irrational combination of imagery, and its focus on psychological themes. "
        "The central figure, a hybrid creature, and the textual references to mythology ('Persephone') and internal states ('superstitious about everything') "
        "are hallmarks of Surrealist art.\n\n"
        "The primary theoretical foundation for the Surrealist movement was the psychoanalytic work of the Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud. "
        "His theories on the unconscious mind, dream analysis, and the symbolism of repressed thoughts provided the intellectual framework for surrealist artists seeking to explore the inner world of the human psyche."
