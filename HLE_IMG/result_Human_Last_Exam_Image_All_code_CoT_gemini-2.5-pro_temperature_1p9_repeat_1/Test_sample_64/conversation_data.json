    "My plan is to analyze the sequence of images provided to understand the biological process they depict.\n\n1.  **Image Analysis:** The images are labeled L, M, and N, suggesting a time sequence.\n    *   In panel **L**, we see a filamentous structure composed of several cells separated by cross-walls (septa). An arrowhead points to a septum. This structure is typical of a fungal hypha or a filament of certain algae.\n    *   In panel **M**, a bulge or outgrowth has appeared at the side of the filament, originating from the cell near the septum indicated in panel L. The arrowhead in M points to this new developing structure.\n    *   In panel **N**, the outgrowth has elongated significantly, forming a new, distinct branch that is itself composed of cells. The arrowhead points to the junction of this new branch with the original filament.\n\n2.  **Process Identification:** The sequence L -> M -> N clearly shows the formation of a new lateral branch from an existing filament. This method of growth allows the organism to expand its network. In fungi, this process is known as **hyphal branching**. It is a fundamental aspect of mycelial growth and development.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to print this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef identify_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  Analyzes the image sequence and identifies the depicted biological process.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The image sequence (L, M, N) shows a filamentous organism.\n  # L: A straight filament of cells (hypha) is shown.\n  # M: A lateral bulge forms on the side of the hypha.\n  # N: The bulge elongates into a new filament, creating a branch.\n  # This entire process is known as hyphal branching.\n  process_name = \"The process depicted is hyphal branching, which is the formation of a new side branch from an existing fungal filament (hypha).\"\n  print(process_name)\n\nidentify_process()\n```\n<<<The process depicted is hyphal branching, which is the formation of a new side branch from an existing fungal filament (hypha).>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
