    "Here is my plan to identify the rock specimens:\n\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and highly vesicular (full of small holes). This texture is characteristic of scoria, a type of volcanic rock formed from frothy lava that cools rapidly.\n2.  **Analyze Specimen I:** This specimen is composed of angular fragments of various sizes cemented together. This is a characteristic of a breccia. Since the fragments appear to be volcanic in origin, it's likely a volcanic breccia.\n3.  **Analyze Specimen J:** This is a light-colored, highly vesicular, and lightweight-looking rock. Its frothy appearance is typical of pumice, a volcanic rock that is so porous it can often float on water.\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:** This rock displays very large, interlocking crystals that are clearly visible. This coarse-grained texture is known as pegmatitic. Therefore, the rock is a pegmatite, an intrusive igneous rock that cooled very slowly, allowing for the growth of large crystals.\n\nI will now write a Python code to present these identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens based on visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Volcanic Breccia',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for letter, rock_type in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {letter}: {rock_type}\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Volcanic Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
