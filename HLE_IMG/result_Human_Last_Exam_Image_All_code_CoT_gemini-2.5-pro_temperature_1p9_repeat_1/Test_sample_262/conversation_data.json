    "The task is to determine which of the four iridium complexes are expected to have shorter operational lifetimes when used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Structures:** I will examine the molecular structures of the four provided iridium complexes. All complexes share a central iridium atom, two cyclometalating ligands (C^N type, a phenylpyridine derivative), and one bipyridine ligand (N^N type). The key difference between them is the position and number of fluorine atoms on the phenyl rings of the cyclometalating ligands.\n2.  **Relate Structure to Lifetime:** The operational stability and lifetime of such phosphorescent emitters are heavily dependent on the strength and stability of the chemical bonds within the molecule, particularly the cyclometalating bond between the iridium and the carbon atom of the phenyl ring (Ir-C bond).\n3.  **Identify Key Destabilizing Feature:** In the literature on organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and LECs, it is well-known that placing a substituent, especially a sterically demanding or electronegative one like fluorine, at the *ortho* position of the phenyl ring (i.e., the carbon adjacent to the Ir-C bond) leads to instability. This ortho-substitution can weaken the Ir-C bond, making the complex more susceptible to degradation during device operation, which in turn leads to a shorter lifetime.\n4.  **Evaluate Each Complex:** I will apply this principle to each of the four complexes:\n    *   **Complex 1:** Has fluorine atoms at the ortho and para positions. The ortho-fluorine is a destabilizing feature.\n    *   **Complex 2:** Has a fluorine atom only at the para position. This avoids the ortho-destabilization and is generally a stable configuration.\n    *   **Complex 3:** Has a fluorine atom at the ortho position. This is a destabilizing feature.\n    *   **Complex 4:** Has no fluorine atoms. It serves as a baseline but lacks the specific ortho-destabilization.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the presence of the destabilizing ortho-fluorine group, I will identify the complexes expected to have shorter lifetimes.\n\n```python\ndef find_shorter_lifetime_complexes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies which of the four iridium complexes are expected to have shorter\n    lifetimes based on their chemical structure.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define the scientific principle.\n    # The operational lifetime of these complexes is primarily dictated by their chemical stability.\n    # A major degradation pathway involves the breaking of the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond.\n    print(\"Scientific Principle:\")\n    print(\"The stability of cyclometalated iridium complexes, and thus their operational lifetime in devices, is highly sensitive to substituents on the phenyl ring.\")\n    print(\"Specifically, a fluorine atom at the 'ortho' position (adjacent to the Ir-C bond) introduces steric and electronic strain that weakens the Ir-C bond.\")\n    print(\"A weaker Ir-C bond leads to faster molecular degradation and, consequently, a shorter device lifetime.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 3: Evaluate each complex based on this principle.\n    # We will identify which complexes have this destabilizing feature.\n    complexes_data = {\n        1: {'feature': 'ortho and para fluorine', 'has_ortho_F': True},\n        2: {'feature': 'para fluorine', 'has_ortho_F': False},\n        3: {'feature': 'ortho fluorine', 'has_ortho_F': True},\n        4: {'feature': 'no fluorine', 'has_ortho_F': False}\n    }\n\n    shorter_lifetime_ids = []\n    print(\"Evaluation of Complexes:\")\n    for cid, data in complexes_data.items():\n        if data['has_ortho_F']:\n            print(f\"Complex {cid}: Contains an ortho-fluorine.
