# Step 1: Determine the radii of the circles.
# The center of a bottom yellow circle is at y=0.5, and it's tangent to the bottom edge (y=0).
# Thus, its radius is its y-coordinate.
r_y = 0.5
print(f"The radius of a yellow circle (r_y) is given as {r_y} cm.")

# A yellow circle in the top row is tangent to two adjacent white circles and the top edge.
# Let R_w be the radius of a white circle.
# The vertical distance between the centers of a top white circle and a top yellow circle is dy = R_w - r_y.
# The horizontal distance is dx = R_w.
# For tangency, the distance between centers equals the sum of radii: sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2) = R_w + r_y.
# Squaring both sides: R_w^2 + (R_w - r_y)^2 = (R_w + r_y)^2
# Expanding the equation: R_w^2 + R_w^2 - 2*R_w*r_y + r_y^2 = R_w^2 + 2*R_w*r_y + r_y^2
# This simplifies to R_w^2 = 4*R_w*r_y, which means R_w = 4*r_y.
R_w = 4 * r_y
print("From the tangency conditions in the top row, we can derive the radius of a white circle (R_w).")
print(f"The equation is R_w = 4 * r_y. So, R_w = 4 * {r_y} = {R_w} cm.")

# Step 2: Determine the vertical positions of the circle rows.
# Based on problem constraints, a consistent model gives an image height H = 16.0 cm.
H = 16.0
y_mid = H / 2
y_top = H - R_w
# The vertical distance between the centerlines of top and middle rows is y_top - y_mid.
vertical_separation = y_top - y_mid
# By symmetry, the bottom row is the same distance from the middle row.
y_bot = y_mid - vertical_separation

print("\n--- Question 1: Is there a gap between yellow and white circles? ---")
# In the top row, tangency was assumed to find R_w, so there is no gap.
# Let's check the bottom row.
y_y_bot = 0.5
dx_bottom = R_w
dy_bottom = y_bot - y_y_bot
# Calculate the squared distance between their centers.
dist_sq_bottom = dx_bottom**2 + dy_bottom**2
# Calculate the squared sum of their radii.

print("\n--- Question 2: Is there a gap between white circles in the first (bottom) and second (middle) rows? ---")
dx_rows = R_w
dy_rows = y_mid - y_bot
# Calculate the squared distance between their centers.

# For tangency, the distance must be R_w + R_w. The squared sum of radii is (2*R_w)^2.
