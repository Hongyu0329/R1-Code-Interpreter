def solve_epidemiological_puzzle():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the Wind-Scattered Epidemiological Puzzle.
    The solution was determined by analyzing the shapes and orderings of the curves in each plot
    and matching them to the expected behavior of the system when each parameter is varied.
    
    The reasoning for each plot is as follows:

    - Plot 5 (Increasing, Blue > Orange > Green): This pattern occurs when a parameter slows the epidemic. The curves are smooth, suggesting a parameter that affects the overall speed. This points to the incubation period, `a_i`.
    - Plot 7 (Increasing, Blue > Orange > Green): This shows a similar pattern to plot 5, but with a distinct plateau whose length varies. This is characteristic of changing the quarantine length, `q_l`.
    
    - Plot 2 (Decreasing, Blue > Orange > Green): This pattern occurs when a parameter helps the epidemic spread (lower final Susceptible population for higher parameter values). The horizontal shift in the 'kink' of the curve is characteristic of changing the quarantine start time, `q_s`.

    - Plot 3 (Decreasing, Green > Orange > Blue): This pattern means the parameter hinders the epidemic. The plot shows an extremely effective quarantine period (a very flat line for S(t)). This strong effect is best explained by varying the fraction of severe cases, `f_s`, as more severe cases get hospitalized, greatly reducing transmission.

    - Plot 9 (Increasing, Green > Orange > Blue): This pattern implies a direct scaling relationship. It must correspond to varying a cost parameter (`c_h` or `c_l`) and plotting the corresponding cost (`C_h` or `C_l`). The sharp rise is more consistent with Lost Productivity Costs (`C_l`) which tracks all infected individuals, a larger group than just hospitalized ones.
    
    - Plot 8 (Decreasing, Green > Orange > Blue): The parameter hinders the epidemic, but the effect is visibly smaller than in other plots (curves are close together). This suggests a parameter with a lesser impact, such as the mortality rate for hospitalized patients, `μ_h`, since the hospitalized population is smaller and already has a low transmission rate.

    - Plot 4 & 6 (Decreasing, Green > Orange > Blue): These are both caused by mortality rates (`μ_n` or `μ_s`) that hinder the epidemic by removing infectious individuals. Distinguishing them is subtle, but based on the slightly larger curve separation, Plot 4 is likely tied to the parameter with a stronger base effect, which is the mortality rate for severe cases, `μ_s`. Plot 6 corresponds to the mortality rate for normal cases, `μ_n`.
    
    - Plot 1 (Decreasing, Green > Orange > Blue): This parameter hinders the epidemic, leading to more Susceptibles remaining. It uniquely shows a strong rebound after the quarantine ends. This happens when a parameter (like the hospital bed growth rate `r_b`) effectively suppresses the first wave, leaving more 'fuel' for a second wave.
