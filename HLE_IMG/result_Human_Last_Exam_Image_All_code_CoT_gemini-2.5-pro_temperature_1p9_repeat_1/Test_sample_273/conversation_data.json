    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will follow the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules for each of the three chiral centers.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Chiral Centers:** The molecule has three stereocenters. According to IUPAC nomenclature for alkanols, we number the longest carbon chain containing the hydroxyl group (-OH) to give the -OH the lowest possible locant. The name is **4-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**. The chiral centers are at carbons C2, C3, and C4.\n2.  **Assign Priorities:** For each chiral center, we will assign priorities (1-4, with 1 being the highest) to the four attached groups based on atomic number.\n3.  **Determine R/S Configuration:** We will analyze the 3D orientation of the groups as depicted in the image. We'll determine if the sequence from priority 1 to 2 to 3 is clockwise (R) or counter-clockwise (S), making sure to correctly orient the molecule so the lowest priority group (4) points away from the viewer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Analysis of Chiral Center C3:**\n    *   **Groups:** -CH(OH)CH3, -CH(CH3)CH2NH2, -CH2CH3 (ethyl), and -H.\n    *   **Priorities:**\n        1.  `-CH(OH)CH3` (since C2 is bonded to a high-Z atom, Oxygen)\n        2.  `-CH(CH3)CH2NH2` (C4's branch contains Nitrogen)\n        3.  `-CH2CH3` (ethyl group)\n        4.  `-H` (lowest priority)\n    *   **Configuration:** In the drawing, the ethyl group (priority 3) is on a wedge (pointing forward), and the two larger groups (priorities 1 and 2) are in the plane. The implied hydrogen (priority 4) must be on a dash (pointing away). Since the lowest priority group is away, we look at the sequence 1 → 2 → 3. This traces a **clockwise** direction. Therefore, **C3 is (R)**.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Chiral Center C4:**\n    *   **Groups:** -CH2NH2, -C3(Et)(...), -CH3, and -H.\n    *   **Priorities:**\n        1.  `-CH2NH2` (the carbon is attached to Nitrogen, Z=7)\n        2.  `-C3(Et)(...)` (the carbon is attached to other carbons)\n        3.  `-CH3`\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Configuration:** The methyl group (priority 3) is on a dash. This means the implied hydrogen (priority 4) must be on a **wedge** (pointing forward). When the lowest priority group is forward, we determine the configuration from the remaining groups and then reverse the result. The sequence 1 → 2 → 3 is **counter-clockwise (S)**. Reversing this gives **(R)**. Therefore, **C4 is (R)**.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Chiral Center C2:**\n    *   **Groups:** -OH, -C3(Et)(...), -CH3, and -H.\n    *   **Priorities:**\n        1.  `-OH` (Oxygen, Z=8)\n        2.  `-C3(Et)(...)` (attached to C)\n        3.  `-CH3`\n        4.  `-H`\n    *   **Configuration:** The drawing at C2 is unconventional, with both -OH (priority 1) and -CH3 (priority 3) shown on dashes. For a tetrahedral carbon, this implies that the other two groups, -H (priority 4) and the bond to C3 (priority 2), must both be on wedges (pointing forward). Since the lowest priority group (-H) is on a **wedge**, we will reverse the result. Viewing the molecule, the sequence 1 → 2 → 3 is **counter-clockwise (S)**. Reversing this gives **(R)**. Therefore, **C2 is (R)**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the absolute configuration is (2R, 3R, 4R).
