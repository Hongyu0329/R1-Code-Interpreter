    # As per the Heck reaction mechanism applied to this specific molecule:
    # 1. Oxidative addition of Pd(0) occurs at the C9-Br bond.
    # 2. Migratory insertion follows. As the product shows a new bond between C5 and C9,
    #    the C9 attacks C5, and the Pd atom gets attached to C4.
    # 3. Beta-hydride elimination creates the new alkene. The Pd is on C4.
    #    The beta-carbons are C3 and C5.
    # 4. C5 has no hydrogens available for elimination.
    # 5. C3 has hydrogens, so elimination occurs from here.
    
    # Therefore, the new double bond is formed between C3 and C4.
