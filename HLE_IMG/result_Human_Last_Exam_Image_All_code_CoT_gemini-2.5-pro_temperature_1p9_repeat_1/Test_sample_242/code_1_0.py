def solve_metathesis_cascade():
    """
    Analyzes the alkene metathesis cascade and determines the identity and stereochemistry
    of the substituents R1, R2, R3, and R4.

    The analysis is as follows:
    1.  Identify key stereocenters in the starting material (SM):
        - C1 (top bridgehead): Quaternary, with Me(up) and CO-vinyl(down).
        - C4 (bottom bridgehead): Tertiary, with Me(down).
        Note: The SM drawing contains a pentavalent carbon, which is an error.
        We proceed assuming the intended structure has these features.

    2.  Map these centers to the product (P) structure:
        - The quaternary center C(R1) in P should derive from C1 in SM. This suggests R1 = Me (up).
        - The tertiary bridgehead C(R3) in P should derive from C4 in SM. This suggests R3 = Me (down).

    3.  Compare this logical deduction (R1=Me UP, R3=Me DOWN) with the provided options.
        - None of the options match this result. This confirms the problem is likely flawed.

    4.  Re-evaluate by assuming one part of the deduction is more reliable.
        - The assignment R3 = Me DOWN appears in options C, D, E. Let's assume this is correct.
        - These options then state R1 = H and R4 = Me. This requires an un-explained migration and inversion of the methyl group from C1.
        - Option C: R1 = H UP, R2 = H UP, R3 = Me DOWN, R4 = Me DOWN.
        - The relative stereochemistry of the bridgeheads C(R1) and C(R3) should be trans, which is satisfied by H(UP) and Me(DOWN).
        - Given the inconsistencies, a definitive proof is impossible. However, based on similar literature examples and assuming potential typos in the problem statement, C presents a plausible (though not rigorously derivable) outcome.
