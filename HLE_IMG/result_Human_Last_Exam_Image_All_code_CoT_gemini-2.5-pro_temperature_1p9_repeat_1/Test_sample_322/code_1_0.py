def solve_vortex_puzzle():
    """
    This function prints the 16-character sequence identifying the unique vortex in each plot.
    
    The logic is based on visual analysis of the vortex trajectories:
    - A strong vortex (R, G, B) has a central, simpler trajectory that acts as a pivot for the other two.
    - A weak vortex (r, g, b) has a more complex, chaotic, or tightly confined trajectory.
    
    The analysis for each plot is as follows:
    1: b (Blue, half)
    2: b (Blue, half)
    3: r (Red, half)
    4: R (Red, twice)
    5: g (Green, half)
    6: g (Green, half)
    7: g (Green, half)
    8: B (Blue, twice)
    9: g (Green, half)
    10: b (Blue, half)
    11: b (Blue, half)
    12: G (Green, twice)
    13: g (Green, half)
    14: b (Blue, half)
    15: r (Red, half)
    16: B (Blue, twice)
