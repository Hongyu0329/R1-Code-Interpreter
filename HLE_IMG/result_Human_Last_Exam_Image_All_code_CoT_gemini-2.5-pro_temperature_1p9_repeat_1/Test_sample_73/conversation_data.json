    "This is an stereochemistry problem that requires assigning the configuration, (R) or (S), to each chiral center according to the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the first reactant (acyl chloride):** Identify the four groups attached to the stereocenter, assign their priorities based on CIP rules, and determine the configuration (R or S) from the 3D drawing.\n2.  **Analyze the second reactant (alcohol):** Repeat the process of identifying groups, assigning priorities, and determining the configuration for its stereocenter.\n3.  **Analyze the reaction:** This is an esterification reaction. A nucleophilic acyl substitution occurs where the alcohol attacks the acyl chloride. This type of reaction proceeds with **retention of configuration** at both stereocenters. This means the 3D spatial arrangement of the groups around each chiral center does not change.\n4.  **Analyze the first product stereocenter (from the alcohol):** The configuration is retained. The chemical change from -OH to an -O-ester group does not alter the relative CIP priorities of the substituents on that chiral carbon. Therefore, its stereochemical descriptor will remain the same.\n5.  **Analyze the second product stereocenter (from the acyl chloride):** The configuration is also retained spatially. However, the chemical change from -C(=O)Cl to an -C(=O)O-ester group **does** change the relative CIP priorities of the groups. Specifically, the priority of this group relative to the -CF3 group changes. This will cause the (R/S) descriptor to flip, even though the reaction occurred with retention.\n6.  **Construct the final sequence:** Combine the four determined stereochemical assignments in order from left to right.\n\nThe python code below will print out the final assignments for each stereocenter.\n\n```python\ndef solve_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the stereochemical assignments for the four stereocenters\n    in the provided reaction scheme.\n    The analysis follows the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Analysis ---\n    # The reaction is an esterification that proceeds with retention of configuration at both chiral centers.\n\n    # Stereocenter 1: Acyl Chloride Reactant\n    # Chiral carbon attached to: -OCH3, -CF3, -C6H5, -C(=O)Cl\n    # CIP Priorities: 1: -OCH3, 2: -C(=O)Cl, 3: -CF3, 4: -C6H5\n    # From the 3D structure, the configuration is (S).\n    assignment_1 = \"S\"\n\n    # Stereocenter 2: Alcohol Reactant\n    # Chiral carbon attached to: -OH, -H, -CH2OCH3, -CH2CH(CH3)2\n    # CIP Priorities: 1: -OH, 2: -CH2OCH3, 3: -CH2CH(CH3)2, 4: -H\n    # From the 3D structure, the configuration is (R).\n    assignment_2 = \"R\"\n\n    # Stereocenter 3: Product Stereocenter from Alcohol\n    # The reaction retains the configuration.
