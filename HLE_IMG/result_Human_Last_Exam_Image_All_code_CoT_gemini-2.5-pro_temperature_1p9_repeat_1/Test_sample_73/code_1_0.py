    # --- Analysis ---
    # The reaction is an esterification that proceeds with retention of configuration at both chiral centers.

    # Stereocenter 1: Acyl Chloride Reactant
    # Chiral carbon attached to: -OCH3, -CF3, -C6H5, -C(=O)Cl
    # CIP Priorities: 1: -OCH3, 2: -C(=O)Cl, 3: -CF3, 4: -C6H5
    # From the 3D structure, the configuration is (S).
    assignment_1 = "S"

    # Stereocenter 2: Alcohol Reactant
    # Chiral carbon attached to: -OH, -H, -CH2OCH3, -CH2CH(CH3)2
    # CIP Priorities: 1: -OH, 2: -CH2OCH3, 3: -CH2CH(CH3)2, 4: -H
    # From the 3D structure, the configuration is (R).
    assignment_2 = "R"

    # Stereocenter 3: Product Stereocenter from Alcohol
    # The reaction retains the configuration. The relative priorities of the groups do not change.
    # Therefore, the configuration remains (R).
    assignment_3 = "R"

    # Stereocenter 4: Product Stereocenter from Acyl Chloride
    # The reaction retains the spatial configuration. However, the change from -C(=O)Cl to -C(=O)OR'
    # changes the CIP priority order.
    # New Priorities: 1: -OCH3, 2: -CF3, 3: -C(=O)OR', 4: -C6H5
    # Because two groups (formerly #2 and #3) have swapped priority, the R/S descriptor flips from S to R.
    assignment_4 = "R"
