    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** First, I will identify the specific knot shown in the image. By examining its crossings and structure, I can determine its classification in knot theory, typically using the Alexander-Briggs notation. The knot in the image has 6 crossings and is commonly known as the **Stevedore knot**, or **6₁**.\n\n2.  **Recall Knot Properties:** The 6₁ knot has several well-known properties. Crucially for this problem, it is a **slice knot**. A knot is called slice if it is the boundary of a smooth, properly embedded 2-dimensional disk in the 4-dimensional ball. By definition, the slice genus `g_s(K)` of a slice knot K is 0.\n\n3.  **Apply the Rasmussen Invariant Property:** The Rasmussen invariant, `s(K)`, is a powerful knot invariant. A fundamental property connects it to the slice genus through the **slice-Bennequin inequality**:\n    `|s(K)| ≤ 2 * g_s(K)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Invariant:** Using the property that `g_s(6₁) = 0`, I can substitute this value into the inequality to find the Rasmussen invariant `s(6₁)`. The calculation will show that the invariant must be 0.\n\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script to formally present these steps and calculate the final result based on the inequality.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rasmussen_invariant_of_6_1():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the Rasmussen invariant for the knot shown in the image.\n\n    The knot is identified as the 6_1 knot (Stevedore knot). This knot is known\n    to be a 'slice knot', which is a key property for determining its\n    Rasmussen invariant, s(K).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the properties of the 6_1 knot\n    knot_name = \"6_1 (Stevedore knot)\"\n    # The slice genus of a slice knot is 0 by definition.\n    g_s = 0\n\n    print(f\"The knot in the image is the {knot_name}.\")\n    print(f\"It is a slice knot, so its slice genus, g_s(K), is {g_s}.\")\n    print(\"\\nTo find the Rasmussen invariant, s(K), we use the slice-Bennequin inequality:\")\n    print(\"|s(K)| <= 2 * g_s(K)\")\n    print(\"\\nPlugging in the slice genus for the 6_1 knot:\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Apply the inequality\n    rhs_value = 2 * g_s\n    \n    print(f\"|s(6_1)| <= 2 * {g_s}\")\n    print(f\"|s(6_1)| <= {rhs_value}\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Deduce the result\n    # Since the absolute value of an integer cannot be negative,\n    # the only possible value for s(6_1) is 0.\n    rasmussen_invariant = 0\n    \n    print(\"\\nBecause the absolute value must be greater than or equal to zero, the inequality implies:\")\n    print(f\"s(6_1) = {rasmussen_invariant}\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the Rasmussen invariant of the {knot_name} is {rasmussen_invariant}.\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the result.\ncalculate_rasmussen_invariant_of_6_1()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
