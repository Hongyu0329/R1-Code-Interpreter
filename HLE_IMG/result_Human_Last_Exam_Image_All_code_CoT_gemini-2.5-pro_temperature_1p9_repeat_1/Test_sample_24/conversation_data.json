    "This image displays a genus-3 Heegaard diagram known as the Dunwoody diagram. This diagram is a representation of the **Poincaré homology sphere**.\n\nThe Poincaré homology sphere (also called the Poincaré dodecahedral space) is a famous example in topology. It's a 3-manifold that has the same homology groups as the 3-sphere (S³), meaning it's indistinguishable from a sphere from the perspective of homology. However, it is not the 3-sphere, as its fundamental group is non-trivial.\n\nThe fundamental group of the Poincaré homology sphere is the **binary icosahedral group**, denoted I* or <2,3,5>. This group is isomorphic to the special linear group SL(2, 5), which is the group of 2x2 matrices with determinant 1 over the finite field with 5 elements (F₅).\n\nWhile deriving this fact from the diagram itself is a complex task involving advanced techniques in low-dimensional topology (like handle slides), we can computationally verify a key property of the resulting manifold: the size of its fundamental group.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the order of the group SL(2, F₅). The general formula for the order of SL(2, F_q) is `q * (q^2 - 1)`. For the Poincaré sphere's fundamental group, `q=5`.\n\n```python\n# The fundamental group of the Poincaré sphere is SL(2, 5).\n# We calculate its order using the formula for SL(2, F_q) where q=5.\nq = 5\n\n# The formula for the order is q * (q^2 - 1).\norder = q * (q**2 - 1)\n\n# Print the equation with the numbers substituted\nprint(f\"The order of the fundamental group is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"{q} * ({q}^2 - 1) = {q} * ({q*q} - 1) = {q} * ({q*q - 1}) = {order}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe fundamental group has {order} elements.\")\n\n# Another way to calculate this is to iterate through all matrices and count.\n# This serves as a verification of the formula.\ncount = 0\nfor a in range(q):\n    for b in range(q):\n        for c in range(q):\n            for d in range(q):\n                # Check if the determinant ad - bc is 1 (mod q)\n                if (a * d - b * c) % q == 1:\n                    count += 1\nprint(f\"Verification by direct counting: {count}\")\n```\n<<<The Poincaré homology sphere>>>"
