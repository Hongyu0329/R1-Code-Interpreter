Based on the analysis of VVA Consulting's sales process and goals, a combined approach is recommended.

1.  DIKW Model: This model is ideal for structuring the flow from raw data to strategic insight.
    - Data: 'VA Sales List'
    - Information: Qualified leads from the list.
    - Knowledge: Understanding which scripts and proposal templates ('VA Deals', 'Work Manual/Template') are most effective.
    - Wisdom: Developing long-term strategic improvements to the sales process.

2.  SECI Model: This model is crucial for capturing and scaling the expertise of the sales team.
    - The creation of a 'VA Sales Script' or a 'Work Manual' is a perfect example of Externalization (turning an expert's tacit knowledge into explicit, documented knowledge for everyone to use).
    - Sharing insights in team meetings (Socialization) and allowing new hires to learn from the manuals (Internalization) completes the knowledge-sharing cycle.

Bloom's Taxonomy is less suitable as it is a framework for individual learning, not for managing an organization's collective knowledge assets.

Conclusion: To effectively boost and maintain sales results, VVA Consulting should implement both the DIKW and SECI models. DIKW provides the structure for data, and SECI provides the mechanism for creating and sharing the human knowledge needed to enrich that structure.
