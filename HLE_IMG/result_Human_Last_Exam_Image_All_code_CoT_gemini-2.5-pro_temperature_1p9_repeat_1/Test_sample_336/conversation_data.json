    "To solve this problem, I will perform the following steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Product Molecule**: The image displays a chemical reaction. My first step is to identify the final product molecule on the right side of the reaction arrow. This molecule is N-(5-fluoropyridin-2-yl)-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-amine.\n2.  **SMILES Representation**: I will represent this molecule using its SMILES (Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System) string, which is `Fc1cc(Nc2ncnc3c2CCNC3)ncc1`. This notation allows the computer to understand the molecule's structure.\n3.  **Use a Cheminformatics Library**: I will use the powerful Python library `RDKit` to handle the chemical calculations.\n4.  **Check logP Condition**: The problem requires the calculation for molecules with a Crippen logP greater than 1. I will compute this value for the product molecule to confirm it meets the criterion.\n5.  **Calculate Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI)**:\n    *   The ECI calculation needs to include all atoms, including hydrogens. Therefore, I will first add explicit hydrogen atoms to the molecular structure.\n    *   The formula for ECI is the sum over all atoms `i` of the product of the atom's degree `V_i` and its eccentricity `E_i`:  `ECI = Î£ (V_i * E_i)`.\n    *   **Degree (`V_i`)**: This is the number of bonds an atom has.\n    *   **Eccentricity (`E_i`)**: This is the longest shortest-path distance from an atom to any other atom in the molecule.\n6.  **Output the Results**: The python script will calculate the ECI, print the full equation showing each `V_i * E_i` term, and then output the final summed value.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nimport sys\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\n    from rdkit.Chem import Crippen\n    import numpy as np\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"RDKit is not installed.
