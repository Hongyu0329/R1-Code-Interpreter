    "This is the orchestral introduction to Act II of Richard Wagner's opera, *Tristan und Isolde*.\n\nThe visual clues leading to this conclusion are:\n1.  **Instrumentation:** A large late-Romantic orchestra, typical of Wagner. The presence of parts like \"engl. Horn\" (English Horn) and extensive string divisi (\"1. Pult\", \"2. Pult\", \"die übrigen\") are characteristic.\n2.  **Language:** All markings are in German (\"Vorhang\" for curtain, \"mit Dämpfer\" for with mute, \"Bratsche\" for viola), pointing to a German or Austrian composer.\n3.  **Musical Style:** The harmony is highly chromatic, which is a hallmark of Wagner's mature style, particularly in *Tristan und Isolde*.\n4.  **Specific Indication:** The text \"1 (Vorhang)\" above the first violin part is a dead giveaway. It translates to \"1 (Curtain)\" and marks the moment the curtain rises at the start of Act II. This introduction is famous for depicting the pulsating excitement and anticipation of the lovers' clandestine meeting.\n\nNo code is required to solve this task.\n<<<Tristan und Isolde>>>"
