Indexing of Prominent XRD Peaks for CuO Nanoparticles
=======================================================
 2θ (degree)   (h k l)
        32.5   (1 1 0)
        35.6  (-1 1 1)
        38.7   (1 1 1)
        48.8  (-2 0 2)
        53.5   (0 2 0)
        58.3   (2 0 2)
        61.5  (-1 1 3)

Note:
1. Peak positions (2θ) are estimated from the provided plot.
2. (h k l) indices are based on the standard reference pattern for
   monoclinic CuO (JCPDS card no. 45-0937).
