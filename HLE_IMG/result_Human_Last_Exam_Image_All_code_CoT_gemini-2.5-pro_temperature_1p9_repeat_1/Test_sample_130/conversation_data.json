    "The image displays an emission spectrum, which is a unique fingerprint for each chemical element. This particular spectrum is characterized by a very large number of fine lines distributed across the entire visible range, from violet/blue to red. This high complexity and density of lines are hallmarks of elements with many electrons, particularly transition metals.\n\nBy comparing this visual pattern to known atomic spectra, we can identify the element.\n*   Simple elements like Hydrogen or Helium have very few, distinct lines.\n*   Elements like Neon are famous for bright lines concentrated in one area (red-orange for Neon).\n*   The spectrum shown, with its thousands of lines forming a dense \"forest\", is the classic emission spectrum of **Iron (Fe)**.\n\nThe following Python code simulates the identification process by matching a description of the observed spectrum against a small database of spectral characteristics.\n\n```python\ndef identify_element_from_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies an element based on a description of its emission spectrum.\n\n    In a real-world application, this would involve processing numerical wavelength\n    data.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which element has these spectral lines?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
