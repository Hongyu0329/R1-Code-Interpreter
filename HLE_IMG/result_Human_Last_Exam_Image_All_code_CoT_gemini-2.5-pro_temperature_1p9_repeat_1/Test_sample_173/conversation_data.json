    "To determine the time signature of the musical measure, we need to sum the durations of all the notes within it. The time signature tells us how many beats are in a measure and what kind of note gets one beat.\n\nLet's analyze the rhythm in the upper staff (right hand), counting sixteenth notes as our base unit. A sixteenth note has one-sixteenth the duration of a whole note.\n\n1.  **First Beat:** We see a group of four notes with two beams. These are four sixteenth notes. Their total duration is 4 * (1/16) = 4/16 = 1/4. This is equivalent to one quarter note.\n2.  **Second Beat:** This group consists of a sixteenth rest followed by three sixteenth notes. The total duration is (1/16) + 3 * (1/16) = 4/16 = 1/4. This is also equivalent to one quarter note.\n3.  **Third Beat:** This is another group of four sixteenth notes. The total duration is 4 * (1/16) = 4/16 = 1/4. This is again equivalent to one quarter note.\n4.  **Fourth Beat:** This group is another sixteenth rest followed by three sixteenth notes. The total duration is (1/16) + 3 * (1/16) = 4/16 = 1/4. This is also equivalent to one quarter note.\n\nNow, let's add up the durations of all the beats in the measure to find the total. The script below will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the duration of a sixteenth note as a fraction of a whole note.\nsixteenth_note = 1/16\n\n# Calculate the duration of each beat in the measure.\n# Beat 1: four sixteenth notes\nbeat_1_duration = 4 * sixteenth_note\n# Beat 2: one sixteenth rest and three sixteenth notes\nbeat_2_duration = 1 * sixteenth_note + 3 * sixteenth_note\n# Beat 3: four sixteenth notes\nbeat_3_duration = 4 * sixteenth_note\n# Beat 4: one sixteenth rest and three sixteenth notes\nbeat_4_duration = 1 * sixteenth_note + 3 * sixteenth_note\n\n# Sum the durations of the beats to get the total duration of the measure.\ntotal_duration = beat_1_duration + beat_2_duration + beat_3_duration + beat_4_duration\n\n# Express the result in terms of quarter notes.\n# A quarter note has a duration of 1/4.\nquarter_note = 1/4\nnum_quarter_notes = total_duration / quarter_note\n\nprint(\"Analyzing the rhythm of the measure:\")\nprint(f\"Beat 1 consists of 4 sixteenth notes. Duration = 4 * 1/16 = {beat_1_duration:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Beat 2 consists of 1 sixteenth rest + 3 sixteenth notes. Duration = 1/16 + 3/16 = {beat_2_duration:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Beat 3 consists of 4 sixteenth notes. Duration = 4 * 1/16 = {beat_3_duration:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Beat 4 consists of 1 sixteenth rest + 3 sixteenth notes. Duration = 1/16 + 3/16 = {beat_4_duration:.2f}\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the total duration:\")\nprint(f\"Total duration = {beat_1_duration:.2f} + {beat_2_duration:.2f} + {beat_3_duration:.2f} + {beat_4_duration:.2f} = {total_duration}\")\nprint(f\"A whole note has a duration of 1. A quarter note has a duration of {quarter_note:.2f}.\")\nprint(f\"The measure contains {int(num_quarter_notes)} quarter-note beats.\")\nprint(\"\\nThis means the time signature has a '4' on top (4 beats) and a '4' on the bottom (quarter note gets the beat).\")\nprint(\"The time signature is 4/4.\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
