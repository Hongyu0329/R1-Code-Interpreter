    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Identify Burst Timestamps:** I will carefully examine the provided raster plot to identify the time points where synchronized bursts of neuronal activity occur. These bursts are characterized by a high density of firing events (black dots) across a large number of electrodes in a short time window, appearing as vertical bands in the plot.\n2.  **Estimate Center Times:** For each identified burst, I will estimate its center time in seconds based on the x-axis scale.\n3.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** I will calculate the time difference between the center times of each consecutive pair of bursts.\n4.  **Calculate the Average IBI:** I will compute the average of all the calculated inter-burst intervals.\n5.  **Format the Output:** I will present the final average rounded to two significant figures, as requested. I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the steps for clarity.\n\nBased on visual inspection of the graph, I have identified the following synchronized bursts at these approximate timestamps:\n*   Burst 1: ~4 s\n*   Burst 2: ~16 s\n*   Burst 3: ~27 s\n*   Burst 4: ~37 s\n*   Burst 5: ~49 s\n\nNow, I will use Python to calculate the average inter-burst interval.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_average_ibi():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the average inter-burst interval from a list of burst timestamps.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts from the graph.\n    burst_timestamps = [4, 16, 27, 37, 49]\n    print(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs).\n    inter_burst_intervals = []\n    print(\"\\nCalculating Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):\")\n    for i in range(len(burst_timestamps) - 1):\n        interval = burst_timestamps[i+1] - burst_timestamps[i]\n        inter_burst_intervals.append(interval)\n        print(f\"Interval {i+1}: {burst_timestamps[i+1]} s - {burst_timestamps[i]} s = {interval} s\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nCalculated IBIs (s): {inter_burst_intervals}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the average IBI.\n    average_ibi = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\n    \n    # Create the equation string for the average calculation\n    interval_sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, inter_burst_intervals))\n    average_equation = f\"Average IBI = ({interval_sum_str}) / {len(inter_burst_intervals)} = {average_ibi} s\"\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the average IBI:\")\n    print(average_equation)\n    \n    # Step 4: Round the result to two significant figures.\n    # To round to two significant figures, we can use a format specifier.\n    # 11.25 has four significant figures.
