    This function finds the minimum positive integer N for which the set S(N) is non-empty.

    The set S(N) contains pairs of positive integers (n1, n2) such that:
    1. n1 <= N and n2 <= N
    2. There exists r > 0 for which the group GG_{n1, n2}(r) is infinite.

    A known result states that the condition for the group to be infinite is:
    1/n1 + 1/n2 < 1
    For positive integers n1, n2, this is equivalent to:
    (n1 - 1) * (n2 - 1) > 1

    The program searches for the smallest N for which such a pair (n1, n2) exists.
