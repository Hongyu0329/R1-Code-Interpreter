# The image shows a program in the Piet language.
# This specific program is the canonical "Hello, world!" example.
# The program's output is the string "Hello, world!".

# As per the instructions, we need to take this output,
# reverse it, and convert it to lowercase.

# The original string
original_output = "Hello, world!"

# Reverse the string using slicing
reversed_output = original_output[::-1]

# Convert the reversed string to lowercase
final_answer = reversed_output.lower()

# Print the final result
print(final_answer)
