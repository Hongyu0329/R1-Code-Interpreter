    This function identifies and prints the name of the missing reactant in the
    provided chemical reaction scheme.

    The reaction is a synthesis of a substituted imidazole from an alpha-haloketone.
    By analyzing the structure of the final product and the starting alpha-haloketone,
    we can deduce the structure of the second reactant.

    - Starting material 2: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one
    - Final Product: tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate

    The alpha-haloketone provides the C4-C5 fragment of the imidazole.
    The missing reactant must provide the N1-C2-N3 fragment with the
    appropriate substituents (a Boc group on N1 and an amino group on C2).
    This corresponds to a protected guanidine.
