    "To determine the time complexity of the given sorting algorithm, we need to analyze its recursive structure in the worst-case scenario.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Case:** The recursion stops when `n <= 1`. This takes constant time, `O(1)`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Recursive Step (for n > 1):**\n    *   `sort(a, n - 1)`: The function calls itself on a subproblem of size `n-1`. Let's denote its cost as `T(n-1)`.\n    *   `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: This is a constant time `O(1)` comparison.\n    *   `swap(...)`: This is also a constant time `O(1)` operation.\n    *   `sort(a, n - 1)`: This is the crucial part. This second recursive call is *conditional*.\n\n3.  **Determine the Worst-Case Scenario:** The worst-case complexity occurs when the work done at each step is maximized. This happens when the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true, forcing the second recursive call to `sort(a, n - 1)` to execute. This scenario consistently happens when sorting an array that is in reverse sorted order. After the first `sort(a, n-1)` correctly sorts the first `n-1` elements, the smallest element of the whole array will be at index `n-1`, making the comparison `a[n-1] < a[n-2]` true.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation:** In the worst case, the total time `T(n)` is the sum of the costs of its sub-parts:\n    *   The first call to `sort(a, n-1)`: `T(n-1)`\n    *   The comparison and swap: `O(1)`\n    *   The second call to `sort(a, n-1)`: `T(n-1)`\n\n    This gives us the recurrence relation:\n    `T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-1) + O(1)`\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c` (where `c` is a constant)\n\n5.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:** Let's expand the relation to see the pattern:\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 3c`\n    *   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 7c`\n    *   ...\n    *   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + (2^k - 1) * c`\n\n    When we expand all the way to the base case `T(1)`, we set `k = n-1`:\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-1) - 1) * c`\n    The dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`. In Big O notation, this is `O(2^n)`.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this exponential growth by instrumenting the function to count the number of calls for a worst-case input (a reverse-sorted array).\n\n```python\n# A global counter to track the number of times the sort function is called.\ncall_count = 0\n\ndef swap(arr, i, j):\n    \"\"\"A helper function to swap two elements in a list.\"\"\"\n    arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n\ndef sort(a, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    The provided sorting algorithm, instrumented to count recursive calls.\n    \"\"\"\n    global call_count\n    call_count += 1\n    \n    if n > 1:\n        # First recursive call\n        sort(a, n - 1)\n        \n        # This condition is always met for a reverse-sorted array,\n        # leading to the worst-case behavior.\n        if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n            swap(a, n - 1, n - 2)\n            # Second (expensive) recursive call\n            sort(a, n - 1)\n\ndef demonstrate_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs the sort algorithm on worst-case inputs of increasing size\n    to demonstrate its exponential time complexity.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Demonstrating the exponential growth of function calls for the worst-case scenario.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n    print(f\"{'n':<5}{'Function Calls':<20}{'Expected (2^n - 1)':<20}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n    \n    # We will test for n from 1 up to 16\n    for n in range(1, 17):\n        global call_count\n        # Reset the counter for each run\n        call_count = 0\n        \n        # The worst-case input is a reverse-sorted array\n        worst_case_array = list(range(n, 0, -1))\n        \n        sort(worst_case_array, n)\n        \n        expected_calls = 2**n - 1\n        \n        print(f\"{n:<5}{call_count:<20}{expected_calls:<20}\")\n        \ndemonstrate_complexity()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
