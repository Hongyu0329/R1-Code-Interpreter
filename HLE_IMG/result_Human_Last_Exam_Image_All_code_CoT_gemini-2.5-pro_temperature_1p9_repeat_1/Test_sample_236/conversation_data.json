    "My analysis of the image reveals an insect with characteristic black and orange markings. This insect is commonly found on Goldenrod flowers, as depicted. Based on its distinct coloration and body shape, particularly the lines on its back and the area behind its head (pronotum), I have identified it as a Boxelder Bug. The scientific name for this species is *Boisea trivittata*.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print this scientific name.\n\n```python\ndef get_scientific_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function returns the scientific name of the insect in the image.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The insect is identified as a Boxelder Bug.\n  scientific_name = \"Boisea trivittata\"\n  print(scientific_name)\n\nget_scientific_name()\n```\n<<<Boisea trivittata>>>"
