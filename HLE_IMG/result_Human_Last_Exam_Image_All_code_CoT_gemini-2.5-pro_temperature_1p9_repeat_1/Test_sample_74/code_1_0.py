    # Conclusion on other choices (briefly, as they are more clearly incorrect)
    # B is incorrect because MTP and baseline are very similar.
    # D is incorrect because max entropy means LOW functional connectivity.
    # E, H, N are incorrect because NGSC is between [0, 1].
    # F is incorrect as the lowest values are from baseline/placebo.
    # I is incorrect because NGSC can be calculated for a single scan.
    # J is incorrect because complexity and connectivity are anti-correlated.
    # L is incorrect as it fails for P1 (mean psi ~0.72 < max other ~0.73).
    # M is incorrect because NGSC=0 means perfect dependence (synchrony).
