    This function returns the IUPAC name of the product from the described reaction.
    The reaction is an oxy-Cope rearrangement followed by tautomerization.
    Starting material: An allylic alcohol with a specific side chain.
    Reaction: Heat.
    Product: A substituted cyclohexanone.
    IUPAC Name determination steps:
    1. The parent is identified as cyclohexanone.
    2. The position of the new side chain is at C-3.
    3. The side chain is named as (1-methoxybut-1-en-3-yl). The (E) stereoisomer of the double bond is assumed to be the major product for thermodynamic reasons.
