    "To determine which triangulation violates the empty circle property of Delaunay triangulations, we need to check if for any triangle in the triangulation, its circumcircle contains another point from the set. If we find such a case, the triangulation is not Delaunay.\n\nWe will analyze the triangulations by assigning approximate coordinates to the points and then programmatically checking the empty circle condition for suspect triangles.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Assign Coordinates:** We will assign 2D coordinates to the 7 points based on their visual positions in the images.\n2.  **Identify Suspects:** By visual inspection, triangulations with \"long and skinny\" or large-area triangles are more likely to violate the property. Triangulations B and D have such triangles.\n3.  **The In-Circle Test:** We will use the \"in-circle\" test, which is a standard method in computational geometry. A point `d` is inside the circumcircle of a counter-clockwise ordered triangle `(a, b, c)` if the following determinant is positive:\n\n    ```\n    | ax  ay  ax² + ay²  1 |\n    | bx  by  bx² + by²  1 | > 0\n    | cx  cy  cx² + cy²  1 |\n    | dx  dy  dx² + dy²  1 |\n    ```\n\n4.  **Verification for B:** We will test a suspect triangle from triangulation B. Let's check the triangle formed by vertices (T, BL, BR) and see if point CL lies inside its circumcircle.\n5.  **Verification for D:** We will test a suspect triangle from triangulation D. A very prominent large triangle is (TL, BL, BR). Let's check if point CL lies inside its circumcircle.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the results of the tests, we will identify which triangulations violate the empty circle property.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It defines the point coordinates, performs the in-circle test for the suspect cases in B and D, prints the calculations, and provides the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks which triangulations violate the Delaunay empty circle property.\n    \"\"\"\n    points = {\n        'TL': np.array([10, 80]),  # Top-Left\n        'T':  np.array([50, 95]),  # Top\n        'TR': np.array([90, 80]),  # Top-Right\n        'CL': np.array([30, 40]),  # Center-Left\n        'CR': np.array([70, 40]),  # Center-Right\n        'BL': np.array([0, 0]),    # Bottom-Left\n        'BR': np.array([100, 0])   # Bottom-Right\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing Triangulation B\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------\")\n    print(\"We test if the circumcircle of triangle T(T, BL, BR) contains point P(CL).\")\n\n    p_T = points['T']\n    p_BL = points['BL']\n    p_BR = points['BR']\n    p_CL = points['CL']\n    \n    # Check orientation of triangle (T, BL, BR)\n    # Area = p_T[0]*(p_BL[1]-p_BR[1]) + p_BL[0]*(p_BR[1]-p_T[1]) + p_BR[0]*(p_T[1]-p_BL[1])\n    # Area = 50*(0-0) + 0*(0-95) + 100*(95-0) = 9500 > 0, so it's CCW.\n    # We can proceed with the standard in-circle test.\n\n    # Matrix for the in-circle test\n    M_B = np.array([\n        [p_T[0],  p_T[1],  p_T[0]**2 + p_T[1]**2,  1],\n        [p_BL[0], p_BL[1], p_BL[0]**2 + p_BL[1]**2, 1],\n        [p_BR[0], p_BR[1], p_BR[0]**2 + p_BR[1]**2, 1],\n        [p_CL[0], p_CL[1], p_CL[0]**2 + p_CL[1]**2, 1]\n    ])\n    \n    det_B = np.linalg.det(M_B)\n\n    print(\"The in-circle test determinant for B's triangle (T, BL, BR) and point CL is calculated.\")\n    # Show the values that go into the equation\n    print(f\"Equation is det(M) where M is:\")\n    for row in M_B:\n        print(f\"  [{row[0]:5.0f} {row[1]:5.0f} {row[2]:7.0f} {row[3]:2.0f}]\")\n    print(f\"Determinant value = {det_B:.0f}\")\n\n    violators = []\n    if det_B > 1e-9: # Using a small tolerance for floating point comparisons\n        print(\"Result: The determinant is positive, so point CL is inside the circumcircle.\")\n        print(\"Conclusion: Triangulation B violates the empty circle property.\\n\")\n        violators.append('B')\n    else:\n        print(\"Result: Point CL is not inside the circumcircle.
