    "This is a chess puzzle where we need to find a forced checkmate in two moves for Black, with the constraint that the black queens cannot be moved.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n\n1.  **Analyze the White King's position:** The white king is on `h1`. Let's examine its escape squares:\n    *   `g1`: Controlled by the black queen on `b1`.\n    *   `g2`: Controlled by the black queen on `a2`.\n    *   `h2`: Attacked by the black queen on `b1` (even though it's occupied by a white pawn).\n    *   Conclusion: The white king is completely trapped and has no legal moves.\n\n2.  **Identify the Mating Threat:** Because the king is immobilized, any check from a black piece that cannot be captured or blocked will be an immediate checkmate.\n    *   A powerful potential check is moving the knight from `d1` to `f2` (`...Nf2+`). This would attack the king on `h1`. Since the king has no escape squares, we must check if this move can be stopped.\n\n3.  **Find White's Defense:** Can White stop `...Nf2#`?\n    *   Yes, the white bishop on `c1` can move to `f2` and capture the knight (`Bxf2`).\n\n4.  **Formulate Black's First Move:** To make the `...Nf2#` threat unstoppable, Black's first move must eliminate the defender of the `f2` square, which is the white bishop on `c1`.\n    *   Black's move: **`1... Nxc1`**. The knight on `d1` captures the bishop on `c1`. This move also adheres to the rule of not moving the black queens.\n\n5.  **Analyze White's Response:** After `1... Nxc1`, what are White's legal moves? White's king cannot move. The only pieces that can move are the pawns.\n    *   Move A: `c3-c4`\n    *   Move B: `e5-e6`\n    *   Neither of these moves helps White's position or stops Black's plan.\n\n6.  **Deliver the Final Blow (Black's Second Move):** Regardless of whether White plays `c4` or `e6`, Black's next move is the same.\n    *   Black's move: **`2... Nf2#`** (checkmate).\n    *   Let's confirm it's mate:\n        *   The king is in check from the knight.\n        *   The king cannot move to any of its adjacent squares (`g1`, `g2`, `h2`), as they are all controlled by the black queens.\n        *   The knight on `f2` cannot be captured because the bishop that could do so was captured on the first move.\n        *   The check cannot be blocked.\n    *   Therefore, it's a forced mate in 2.\n\nThe sequence of black's moves is `Nxc1`, followed by `Nf2#`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function prints the solution to the chess puzzle.\n  The puzzle is a mate in 2 for black, without moving the queens.\n\n  The sequence is as follows:\n  1. Nxc1: Black's knight at d1 captures White's bishop at c1. This removes the only piece\n            that can defend the f2 square. White is forced to respond with a pawn move\n            (either c4 or e6), as the king is trapped.\n  2. Nf2#: Black's knight moves to f2, delivering checkmate. The White king cannot move\n           as all its escape squares (g1, g2, h2) are controlled by the black queens,\n           and the checking knight cannot be captured.\n  \"\"\"\n  move1 = \"Nxc1\"\n  move2 = \"Nf2#\"\n  print(f\"{move1}, {move2}\")\n\nsolve_chess_puzzle()\n```\n<<<Nxc1, Nf2#>>>"
