    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that analyzes the clues to determine the poetic form.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the number of lines in the stanza and the text of the known lines from the information provided.\n2.  Calculate the number of syllables in the known lines.\n3.  Describe the structure of the most likely poetic form based on these syllable counts.\n4.  Compare the known lines to this form and draw a conclusion. The most distinctive clue is the number of lines (four) and the syllable count of the final line.\n\n```python\ndef solve_poetic_form():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes clues from the prompt to identify the poetic form.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
