# Define the component values from the circuit diagram.
V_source = 1.0  # Voltage of the source V2 in Volts.
R1 = 3.0    # Resistance of R1 in Ohms.
R2 = 7.0    # Resistance of R2 in Ohms.
R3 = 9.0    # Resistance of R3 in Ohms.
R7 = 100.0  # Resistance of R7 in Ohms.
R8 = 100.0  # Resistance of R8 in Ohms.

# --- Circuit Analysis ---
# In this circuit, R1 and R3 are short-circuited by wires.
# Current will follow the path of least resistance, bypassing them.
# So, the circuit simplifies to two parallel branches connected to the voltage source.
# Branch 1 contains only R2.
# Branch 2 contains R7 and R8 in series.

print("Step 1: Calculate the current in the first parallel branch (through R2).")
# The resistance of this branch is just R2, as R1 and R3 are shorted.
R_branch1 = R2

print(f"I_branch1 = V_source / R2 = {V_source} V / {R_branch1} Ω = {I_branch1:.4f} A")

print("\nStep 2: Calculate the current in the second parallel branch (through R7 and R8).")
# R7 and R8 are in series, so their resistances add up.
R_branch2 = R7 + R8
I_branch2 = V_source / R_branch2
print(f"The combined resistance of R7 and R8 is {R7} Ω + {R8} Ω = {R_branch2} Ω.")
print(f"I_branch2 = V_source / (R7 + R8) = {V_source} V / {R_branch2} Ω = {I_branch2:.4f} A")

print("\nStep 3: Calculate the total current from the source.")
# The total current is the sum of the currents in the two parallel branches.
I_total = I_branch1 + I_branch2
print("The total current is the sum of the currents from both branches.")
print("\nFinal Equation:")
print(f"I_total = (V_source / R2) + (V_source / (R7 + R8))")
