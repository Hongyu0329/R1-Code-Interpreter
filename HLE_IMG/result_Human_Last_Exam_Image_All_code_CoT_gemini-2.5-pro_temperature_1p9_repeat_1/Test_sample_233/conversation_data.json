    "I have identified the runestone by analyzing the runes visible in the image and cross-referencing them with the known corpus of Ingvar runestones.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Transliterate the Runes:** I will transliterate the visible Younger Futhark runes in each of the three rows shown in the image fragment.\n2.  **Identify Key Phrases:** I will identify key Old Norse words from the transliteration, such as `sun sin` (\"his son\").\n3.  **Search the Runestone Database:** I will use these key phrases to find a match among the cataloged Ingvar runestones. The inscription fragment `...þurbiurn : sun sin : han...` is a strong clue.\n4.  **Confirm the Match:** The fragment perfectly matches a section of the inscription on the runestone cataloged as **Sö 281**. This stone commemorates Þorbjörn, who \"met his end on the eastern route with Ingvarr\".\n5.  **Output the Result:** I will write a Python script to present this finding, print the final ID, and then print each digit of the ID number as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_runestone_id():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the Ingvar runestone from the provided image fragment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze the runes in the image fragment.\n    # The runes are from the Younger Futhark alphabet.\n\n    # Top row transliteration: ...ᚦᚢᚱᛒᛁᚢᚱᚾ... which is \"thurbiurn\", a spelling of the name Þorbjörn (Thorbjorn).\n    # Middle row transliteration: ...ᛋᚢᚾ + ᛋᛁᚾ... which is \"sun sin\" meaning \"his son\".\n    # Bottom row transliteration: ...ᚼᛅᚾ... which is \"han\" meaning \"he\".\n\n    fragment_transliteration = {\n        \"Top Row\": \"...thurbiurn...\",\n        \"Middle Row\": \"...sun sin...\",\n        \"Bottom Row\": \"...han...\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Match the fragment to a known Ingvar runestone inscription.\n    # This specific sequence of words is found on the Sö 281 runestone.\n    # The relevant part of the Sö 281 inscription is:\n    # Old Norse: \"... at Þorbiorn, sun sinn.
