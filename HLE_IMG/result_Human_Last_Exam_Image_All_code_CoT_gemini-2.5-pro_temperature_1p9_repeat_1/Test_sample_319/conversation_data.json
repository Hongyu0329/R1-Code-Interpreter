    "Based on the analysis of the provided image and description, here is the step-by-step thinking process to identify the phenomenon:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Information:** The image contains two plots. The top one is a spectrogram, which shows the frequency content of a sound over time. The bottom plot is the corresponding waveform, showing the sound's amplitude over time.\n    *   Initially, both plots depict a simple, pure tone: a single horizontal line in the spectrogram and a regular sine wave in the waveform.\n    *   This continuous tone is then interrupted by a brief, different sound. In the spectrogram, this interruption appears as a vertical smear, which represents a burst of broadband noise (sound containing many frequencies at once). In the waveform, the simple sine wave is replaced by a complex, non-repeating pattern during this burst.\n    *   After the burst of noise, the pure tone resumes.\n\n2.  **Connect to the Description:** The prompt describes this as a perceptual illusion related to our brain's unconscious abilities, similar to the bistable perception of the Necker Cube. The Necker Cube demonstrates how the brain actively interprets ambiguous visual information. Similarly, this auditory stimulus is designed to trick our auditory perception.\n\n3.  **Identify the Illusion:** When a listener hears this sound sequence (tone -> noise -> tone), the brain often does not perceive the tone as being interrupted. Instead, it \"fills in\" the missing segment of the tone during the noise burst. The listener perceives the tone as continuous, as if it carried on *behind* the noise. This is a powerful demonstration of the brain's predictive and restorative capabilities in processing sensory input.\n\n4.  **Determine the Name:** This well-documented perceptual phenomenon is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**. It is also sometimes referred to as perceptual restoration of sound. A famous variant involving speech sounds is called the phonemic restoration effect. Given the pure tone stimulus shown, \"Auditory Continuity Illusion\" is the most accurate and general term.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies the perceptual phenomenon illustrated in the image.\n# The image shows the physical stimulus for an auditory illusion.\n# A pure tone is presented, interrupted by a burst of noise, and then the tone continues.\n# The human brain perceives the tone as continuous, seemingly flowing uninterrupted behind the noise.\n# This process of the brain \"filling in\" missing auditory information is a specific type of perceptual restoration.\n\nphenomenon_name = \"Auditory Continuity Illusion\"\n\nprint(f\"The name of the phenomenon depicted is the: {phenomenon_name}\")\n```\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion>>>"
