# This script identifies the perceptual phenomenon illustrated in the image.
# The image shows the physical stimulus for an auditory illusion.
# A pure tone is presented, interrupted by a burst of noise, and then the tone continues.
# The human brain perceives the tone as continuous, seemingly flowing uninterrupted behind the noise.
# This process of the brain "filling in" missing auditory information is a specific type of perceptual restoration.
