    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this chemistry problem.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Overall Reaction:** I will start by examining the reactants (hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene), the product (a complex fused ring system), and the reaction conditions (photochemical, indicated by 'hv').\n2.  **Propose a Stepwise Mechanism:** A direct reaction between the two stable starting molecules to form such a complex product in one step is unlikely. I will propose a more plausible two-step mechanism, which is common in photochemical reactions.\n3.  **Identify Step 1:** The first step likely involves the photochemical activation of one of the reactants. Hexafluorobenzene is known to undergo photochemical isomerization to its valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene. I will identify the type of pericyclic reaction corresponding to this transformation.\n4.  **Identify Step 2:** The second step involves the reaction of the highly reactive intermediate (hexafluoro-Dewar benzene) with the second reactant (cyclobutene). By analyzing the change in bonding and the structure of the final product, I will classify this second reaction type.\n5.  **Formulate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that clearly states the two types of pericyclic reactions involved in the transformation, fulfilling the user's request for a coding solution.\n6.  **Provide the Final Answer:** Finally, I will summarize the answer concisely in the requested `<<<answer>>>` format.\n\nHere is the Python code that identifies and explains the reactions:\n\n```python\ndef explain_pericyclic_reactions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the two types of pericyclic reactions\n    involved in the given chemical transformation.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The reaction proceeds in two sequential photochemical steps.\n    \n    # Step 1: Photochemical isomerization of hexafluorobenzene.\n    # This reaction is a valence isomerization, which is a type of electrocyclic reaction.\n    # It is allowed under photochemical conditions for a 6-pi electron system.\n    reaction1 = \"photochemical electrocyclic reaction\"\n    \n    # Step 2: Reaction of the intermediate with cyclobutene.\n    # The hexafluoro-Dewar benzene intermediate reacts with cyclobutene in a\n    # cycloaddition. Since two double bonds (2 pi electrons each) are involved,\n    # it is a [2+2] cycloaddition. This reaction is also photochemically allowed.\n    reaction2 = \"photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition\"\n    \n    print(\"The transformation involves two sequential photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions:\")\n    print(f\"1. A {reaction1}, where hexafluorobenzene converts to its valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene.\")\n    print(f\"2.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur in this transformation.
