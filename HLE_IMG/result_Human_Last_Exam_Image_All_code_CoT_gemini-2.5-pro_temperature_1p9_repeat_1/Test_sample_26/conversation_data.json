    "Here is my step-by-step plan for analyzing the specified musical measure:\n\n1.  **Identify the context:** The piece is Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata, first movement. The global key signature is C minor (three flats: B♭, E♭, A♭).\n2.  **Locate the measure:** I will focus on measure 30, which is highlighted in the provided musical score.\n3.  **Identify the notes:** I will read the notes on both the treble and bass clefs for measure 30. The bass clef contains G octaves. The treble clef contains a chord with the notes F♯, B♮, and D.\n4.  **Determine the chord:** Combining all notes gives G, B♮, D, F♯. Stacking these notes in thirds reveals a G major seventh chord (Gmaj7).\n5.  **Analyze the chord's function:** The root of the chord is G, which is the fifth scale degree (the dominant) of the home key, C minor. The Roman numeral for the dominant is V.\n6.  **Determine the full Roman numeral:** The chord is a major triad (G-B♮-D), so the 'V' is uppercase. The seventh is a major seventh (F♯), which is a chromatic alteration of the typical minor seventh (F♮) found in a V7 chord in a minor key. This is indicated by appending \"maj7\" to the numeral.\n7.  **Construct the code:** I will write a Python script that follows these analytical steps and prints the final Roman numeral, clearly showing how it was derived.\n\n```python\ndef get_roman_numeral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and prints the Roman numeral for the chord in measure 30 of\n    Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, 1st movement.\n    \"\"\"\n    key = \"C minor\"\n    measure = 30\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify notes in the measure\n    notes_in_chord = [\"G\", \"B-natural\", \"D\", \"F-sharp\"]\n    \n    # Step 2: Determine the chord's root and quality\n    root = \"G\"\n    quality = \"Major 7th\"\n    chord_name = f\"{root}{quality.replace(' ', '')}\" # Gmaj7\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the Roman numeral based on the key\n    # G is the 5th scale degree in C minor, which is the dominant.\n    roman_numeral_base = \"V\"\n    \n    # The chord has a major third (B-natural) and a major seventh (F-sharp)\n    roman_numeral_quality = \"maj7\"\n    final_roman_numeral = roman_numeral_base + roman_numeral_quality\n\n    # Print the analysis step-by-step\n    print(f\"Analysis for measure {measure} of Beethoven's 'Pathetique' Sonata (1st Mov.):\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(f\"1.
