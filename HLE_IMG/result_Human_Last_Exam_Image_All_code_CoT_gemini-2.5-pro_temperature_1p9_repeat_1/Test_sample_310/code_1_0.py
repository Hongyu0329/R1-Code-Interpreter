    This function calculates the number-average degree of polymerization (N_n)
    for the missing simulation plot.

    Steps:
    1. Define the initial degree of polymerization (N), identified from the plots as 20.
    2. Define the parameters for the missing case, which was deduced to be a linear polymer
       with a degradation index m = 3.
    3. Calculate the degree of destruction 'a' using the formula a = m / 25.
    4. Apply the formula for the number-average degree of polymerization for a linear polymer:
       N_n = N / (1 + (N - 1) * a).
    5. Print the full equation with the values plugged in, along with the final result.
