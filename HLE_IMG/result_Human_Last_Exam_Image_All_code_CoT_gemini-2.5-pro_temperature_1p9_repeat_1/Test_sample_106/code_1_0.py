# The analysis of the backbone rearrangement provides the identity of each substituent.
# 1 = The methyl group at C4 is not involved in the main cascade and remains.
# 2 = The H from C9 migrates to C10.
# 3 = The CH3 from C14 migrates to C8.
# 4 = The H from C13 migrates to C14.
# 5 = The H originally at C13 migrates away, and C13 becomes part of a double bond. We assign H based on the identity of the migrating group.
