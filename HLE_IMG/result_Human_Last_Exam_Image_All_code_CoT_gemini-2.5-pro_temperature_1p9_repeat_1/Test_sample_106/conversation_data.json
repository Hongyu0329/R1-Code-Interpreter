    "This is a classic organic chemistry problem involving a complex carbocation rearrangement known as a \"backbone rearrangement\" common in triterpenoid structures. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the reaction:** The reaction is the acid-catalyzed dehydration of a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol. The catalytic HCl and heat protonate the hydroxyl group, which leaves as water to form a carbocation. This carbocation then initiates a series of 1,2-shifts (Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement) to form a more stable final product.\n2.  **Trace the rearrangement:** The final product has a double bond between carbons C13 and C18. This is the characteristic product of the oleanane backbone rearrangement. We will trace the standard sequence of hydride (H⁻) and methyl (CH₃⁻) shifts that leads to this product. The rearrangement cascade effectively moves a positive charge across the carbon skeleton from the initial site toward the location of the final double bond.\n3.  **Determine the final substituents:** By tracking which group migrates to which position during the cascade, we can determine the identity of the substituents at the labeled positions (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) in the final product.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\nThe rearrangement is a cascade of 1,2-shifts. Let's trace what ends up at each labeled position:\n\n*   **Position 1 (on C4):** The backbone rearrangement cascade typically starts at C5. The initial formation of the carbocation might involve the rings further to the left, but in the most accepted mechanism for this transformation, the gem-dimethyl group at C4 is not involved in the shifts. Therefore, the methyl group originally at position 1 remains there.\n    *   **1 = CH3**\n\n*   **Position 2 (on C10):** In the first step of the main cascade, the cation at C5 is stabilized by a 1,2-methyl shift from C10. This moves the C10-methyl to C5 and leaves a cation at C10. In the next step, this C10 cation is stabilized by a 1,2-hydride shift from C9. Thus, the hydrogen atom originally on C9 moves to C10.\n    *   **2 = H**\n\n*   **Position 3 (on C8):** Following the cascade, the positive charge migrates from C9 to C8. This C8 cation is then stabilized by a 1,2-methyl shift from C14. So, the methyl group originally at C14 moves to C8.\n    *   **3 = CH3**\n\n*   **Position 4 (on C14):** After the previous step, the cation is at C14. It is stabilized by a 1,2-hydride shift from C13. This moves the hydrogen atom originally on C13 to C14.\n    *   **4 = H**\n\n*   **Position 5 (on C13):** The cation now resides at C13. The reaction terminates with the elimination of a proton from the adjacent C18, forming the stable tetrasubstituted C13=C18 double bond. When this happens, C13 becomes sp² hybridized and part of the alkene. Its original substituent (the hydrogen atom that moved to C14) is gone, and no new substituent has taken its place. However, the question demands an answer of H or CH3. This is a common ambiguity or flaw in such problems. The most logical interpretation is to identify the group that was originally at C13 and migrated during the reaction. That group was a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **5 = H**\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis of the rearrangement, we can now write the code to print the final answer.\n\n```python\n# The analysis of the backbone rearrangement provides the identity of each substituent.\n# 1 = The methyl group at C4 is not involved in the main cascade and remains.\n# 2 = The H from C9 migrates to C10.\n# 3 = The CH3 from C14 migrates to C8.\n# 4 = The H from C13 migrates to C14.\n# 5 = The H originally at C13 migrates away, and C13 becomes part of a double bond. We assign H based on the identity of the migrating group.\n\nsubstituents = {\n    1: \"CH3\",\n    2: \"H\",\n    3: \"CH3\",\n    4: \"H\",\n    5: \"H\"\n}\n\nprint(f\"1 = {substituents[1]}, 2 = {substituents[2]}, 3 = {substituents[3]}, 4 = {substituents[4]}, 5 = {substituents[5]}\")\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = H, 5 = H>>>"
