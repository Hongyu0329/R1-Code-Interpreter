def solve_cone_distance():
    """
    This function explains and calculates the furthest distance on a cone surface.
    
    The problem is solved by unrolling the cone into a sector of a circle.
    Let 'd' be the diameter of the cone's base.
    
    1. Define cone parameters in terms of 'd'.
    - Base diameter = d
    - Base radius (r) = d / 2
    - Slant height (s) = d
    
    2. Unroll the cone into a sector.
    - The sector's radius is the slant height, so Sector Radius = d.
    - The sector's arc length is the cone's base circumference.
      Circumference = 2 * pi * r = 2 * pi * (d / 2) = pi * d.
    
    3. Calculate the angle of the sector (theta).
    - Arc Length = Sector Radius * theta
    - pi * d = d * theta
    - theta = pi radians (180 degrees).
    - This means the unrolled cone is a semicircle of radius 'd'.
    
    4. Find the furthest distance on the semicircle.
    - The starting point P is on the arc of the semicircle.
    - The furthest point Q on the semicircle area is one of the corners on the straight edge.
    - The path from P to Q is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whose
      other two sides are radii of the semicircle, each with length 'd'.
      
    5. Calculate the distance using the Pythagorean theorem.
    - distance^2 = d^2 + d^2 = 2 * d^2
    - distance = sqrt(2) * d
    """
    # We can calculate the coefficient for 'd'.
    # Let's assume d=1 for calculation of the coefficient.
    d = 1
    # The two legs of the right triangle have length d.
    leg1_squared = d**2
    leg2_squared = d**2
    
    # Hypotenuse squared = leg1^2 + leg2^2
    hypotenuse_squared = leg1_squared + leg2_squared
    
    # The coefficient is the square root of this sum
    coefficient = math.sqrt(hypotenuse_squared)
