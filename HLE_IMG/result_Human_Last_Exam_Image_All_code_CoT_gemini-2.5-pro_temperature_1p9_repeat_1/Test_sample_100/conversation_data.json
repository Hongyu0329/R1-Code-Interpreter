    "My plan is to determine the molecular formula of the product by following the reaction scheme step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material**: First, I will identify the chemical structure of the starting compound and determine its molecular formula by counting the number of Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), Fluorine (F), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O) atoms. The structure is a derivative of 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one, which is a bicyclic lactam. It has a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group and a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group.\n2.  **Analyze Step 1**: The reaction with CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) is a standard method for removing the PMB protecting group from a nitrogen atom. This process replaces the PMB group with a hydrogen atom. I will calculate the change in the molecular formula to get the formula of **Intermediate 1**.\n3.  **Analyze Step 2**: The reaction with Palladium on Carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2) is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the ring to a single bond (C-C) by adding two hydrogen atoms. I will update the molecular formula to get that of **Intermediate 2**.\n4.  **Analyze Step 3**: The reaction with hot aqueous acid (4 N HCl, 70 Â°C) causes the hydrolysis of the lactam (cyclic amide) functional group. This ring-opening reaction results in the net addition of one molecule of water (H2O) to the formula of Intermediate 2, yielding the final **Product**, which is an amino acid.\n5.  **Final Calculation and Output**: I will calculate the final molecular formula and write a Python script to automate this counting process and print the result clearly, showing the count for each element in the final product.\n\n```python\ndef solve_molecular_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the molecular formula of the final product based on the provided reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of the starting material.\n    # Structure: 2-(p-methoxybenzyl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    # Bicyclic core (C6H5F3NO): C=6, H=5, F=3, N=1, O=1 (from C=O).\n    # PMB group (-C8H9O): C=8, H=9, O=1.\n    # Total atoms in Starting Material: C=14, H=14, F=3, N=1, O=2.\n    starting_material = {'C': 14, 'H': 14, 'F': 3, 'N': 1, 'O': 2}\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the formula for Intermediate 1.\n    # Reaction: Deprotection of PMB group using CAN.
