def calculate_synthesis_steps():
    """
    This function calculates and explains the minimum number of steps required for the described chemical synthesis.

    The synthesis of as-indaceno[3,2,1,8,7,6-pqrstuv]picene (C38H16) is best
    achieved using benzaldehyde (C7H6O) and 2-acetylnaphthalene (C12H10O) as building blocks.
    The most efficient route consists of three distinct chemical steps:

    1.  Claisen-Schmidt Condensation: Formation of a C19 chalcone intermediate from
        benzaldehyde and 2-acetylnaphthalene.
    2.  McMurry Coupling: Dimerization of two C19 chalcone molecules to create a C38
        hydrocarbon precursor.
    3.  Scholl Reaction: Intramolecular cyclization and aromatization of the C38
        precursor to yield the final planar product.

    Each of these is a major transformation that constitutes one step. The minimum number of steps is therefore the sum of these individual steps.
