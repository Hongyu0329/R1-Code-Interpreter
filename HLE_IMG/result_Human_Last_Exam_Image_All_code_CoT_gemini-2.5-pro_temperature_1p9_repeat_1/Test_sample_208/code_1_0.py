    # Step 1: Define the rules from the riddle.
    # We model the clock face from 0 to 11, where 12 o'clock is 0.
    # Time 't' is in hours, starting from t=0 at noon.

    # "The hour hand moves in steps of three."
    # We interpret this as a speed of 3 hour-marks per hour.
    v_h = 3 

    # "The minute hand gains, with every tick, A quarter turn"
    # A quarter turn is 3 hour-marks (3/12 of the clock face).
    # "Gains" implies its speed relative to the hour hand is 3 hour-marks per hour.
    v_rel = 3
    
    # Therefore, the minute hand's absolute speed is the hour hand's speed plus the relative speed.

    # Step 2: Set up the equation for when they meet.
    # The hands meet when their positions are the same. Let's find the time 't'.
    # Position of hour hand at time t: (v_h * t) % 12
    # Position of minute hand at time t: (v_m * t) % 12
    # They meet when (v_m * t) % 12 == (v_h * t) % 12.
    # This is equivalent to ((v_m - v_h) * t) being a multiple of 12.
    # So, v_rel * t = 12 * k, for some integer k > 0.
    
    # We are looking for the first meeting time, so we use k=1.
    k = 1
    multiple_of_12 = 12 * k
