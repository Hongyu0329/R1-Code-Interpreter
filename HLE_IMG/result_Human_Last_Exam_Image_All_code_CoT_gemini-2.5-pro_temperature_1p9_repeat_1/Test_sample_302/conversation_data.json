    "My plan to identify the characters on the seal is as follows:\n1.  First, I will recognize that the script is ancient Chinese Seal Script (篆书, zhuànshū).\n2.  Next, I will apply the traditional reading order for square seals, which is from top to bottom and from right to left.\n3.  I will then identify each character based on this order:\n    *   Top-right character: 尋 (xún)\n    *   Bottom-right character: 常 (cháng)\n    *   Top-left character: 不 (bù)\n    *   Bottom-left character: 憂 (yōu)\n4.  The full phrase in Traditional Chinese is 尋常不憂.\n5.  Finally, I will convert these characters to Simplified Chinese to get \"寻常不忧\", which means \"ordinarily without worries\" or \"living a simple, carefree life\". I will then write a Python script to print this result.\n\n```python\n# The seal is engraved with four characters in Chinese Seal Script (篆书).\n# The reading order is top-to-bottom, right-to-left.\n\n# The characters are identified as:\n# 1. Top-right: 尋 (xún) - to seek\n# 2. Bottom-right: 常 (cháng) - common\n# 3. Top-left: 不 (bù) - not\n# 4. Bottom-left: 憂 (yōu) - to worry\n\n# The phrase is 尋常不憂. In Simplified Chinese, 憂 is written as 忧.\n# The other characters remain the same.\n# So the simplified text is 寻常不忧.\n\nsimplified_chinese_text = \"寻常不忧\"\n\nprint(f\"The character content on the seal in simplified Chinese is: {simplified_chinese_text}\")\n\n```\n<<<寻常不忧>>>"
