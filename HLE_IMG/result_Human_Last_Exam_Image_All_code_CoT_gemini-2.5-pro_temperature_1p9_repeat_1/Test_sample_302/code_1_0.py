# The seal is engraved with four characters in Chinese Seal Script (篆书).
# The reading order is top-to-bottom, right-to-left.

# The characters are identified as:
# 1. Top-right: 尋 (xún) - to seek
# 2. Bottom-right: 常 (cháng) - common
# 3. Top-left: 不 (bù) - not
# 4. Bottom-left: 憂 (yōu) - to worry

# The phrase is 尋常不憂. In Simplified Chinese, 憂 is written as 忧.
# The other characters remain the same.
# So the simplified text is 寻常不忧.
