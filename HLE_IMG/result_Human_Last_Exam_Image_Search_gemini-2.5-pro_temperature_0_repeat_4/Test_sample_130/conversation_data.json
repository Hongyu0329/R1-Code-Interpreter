    "The spectral lines shown in the image belong to the element **Uranium (U)**.\n\nThe image displays a very dense and complex emission spectrum, which is a characteristic fingerprint of heavy elements. Uranium, with its intricate electron structure, produces a multitude of spectral lines across the visible spectrum and beyond. Each element has a unique emission spectrum that can be used for its identification.\n\nThe visual complexity of the provided spectrum, with its numerous lines in the blue, green, yellow, and red regions, is a strong indicator of uranium. Scientific databases and spectral charts confirm that uranium's emission spectrum is exceptionally rich in lines, a feature that is clearly visible in the image provided. For instance, some analyses of uranium's spectrum have identified thousands of individual emission lines.\n\n<<<Uranium>>>"
