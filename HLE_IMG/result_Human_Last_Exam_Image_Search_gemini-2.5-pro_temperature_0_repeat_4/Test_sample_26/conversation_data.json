    "Based on the sheet music provided, the chord in measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata is a G dominant seventh chord.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the analysis:\n*   **Key Signature:** The movement is in C minor.\n*   **Notes in Measure 30:**\n    *   The right hand plays the notes G, B-natural, D, and F.\n    *   The left hand plays a G octave.\n*   **Chord Identification:** The combination of these notes (G, B♮, D, F) forms a G dominant seventh chord (G7).\n*   **Roman Numeral Analysis:** In the key of C minor, the fifth scale degree (the dominant) is G. A dominant seventh chord built on this note is represented by the Roman numeral V7. Some analyses also note the presence of an augmented 6th chord in this measure.\n\nThe passage from measures 29-30 consists of arpeggios and broken chords. Specifically, the section from measure 27 to 34 features broken V chords that establish the key of C minor.\n\nTherefore, the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 is V7.\n\n<<<V7>>>"
