    "Based on the analysis of the provided mass spectrum, the compound is identified as **Bifenox**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step interpretation of the mass spectrum that leads to this conclusion:\n\n1.  **Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak**: The peak at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) that is part of a clear isotopic pattern appears to be at m/z 260, with other peaks in its cluster at 262, 264, and 266. This cluster suggests the presence of multiple chlorine atoms. However, a detailed analysis of the fragmentation pattern is more revealing.\n\n2.  **Base Peak**: The most intense peak in the spectrum (the base peak) is at **m/z 225**. This peak has a relative intensity of 100%.\n\n3.  **Isotope Pattern Analysis**: The cluster of peaks around the base peak is highly informative.\n    *   m/z 225 (Intensity = 100)\n    *   m/z 227 (Intensity = 66.7)\n    *   The intensity ratio of the peaks at m/z 225 and m/z 227 is approximately 100:66.7, which simplifies to roughly 3:2. This is the characteristic isotopic signature for a fragment containing **two chlorine atoms**.\n\n4.  **Fragmentation Analysis**:\n    *   The most significant fragmentation pathway is the loss of a specific fragment from the molecular ion to form the highly stable base peak at m/z 225.\n    *   The peak at **m/z 262** (I=29.0) likely represents the loss of a methoxy group (-OCH₃, mass 31) from a heavier molecular ion.\n    *   The peak at **m/z 190** (I=48.4) corresponds to the loss of a chlorine atom (mass 35) from the base peak fragment at m/z 225 (225 - 35 = 190).\n    *   The peak at **m/z 141** (I=28.1) is also a significant fragment.\n\n5.  **Compound Identification**: A search of mass spectral databases for a compound with a base peak at m/z 225 and significant fragments at m/z 190 and 262 points to the herbicide **Bifenox**.\n    *   **Molecular Formula**: C₁₄H₉Cl₂NO₅\n    *   **Molecular Weight**: 342.13 g/mol\n    *   The molecular ion for Bifenox (containing two ³⁵Cl atoms) would be at m/z 341. This peak is not prominent in the provided spectrum, which is common for compounds that fragment easily.\n    *   The major fragments observed in the spectrum are consistent with the structure of Bifenox. The base peak at m/z 225 corresponds to the [C₇H₄Cl₂NO₂]⁺ fragment, and the peak at m/z 262 corresponds to the loss of the nitro group (NO₂) from the [M-OCH₃]⁺ fragment.\n\n6.  **IUPAC Name**: The systematic IUPAC name for Bifenox is **methyl 5-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-2-nitrobenzoate**.\n\n<<<methyl 5-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)-2-nitrobenzoate>>>"
