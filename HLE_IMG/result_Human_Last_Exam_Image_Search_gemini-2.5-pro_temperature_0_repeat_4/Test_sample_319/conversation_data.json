    "The image displays a spectrogram and a waveform that illustrate an auditory illusion. The top part of the image, the spectrogram, shows a continuous tone that is interrupted by a burst of noise. The bottom part, the waveform, shows the corresponding sound wave. The prompt mentions that this illusion is similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity, where a 2D drawing of a cube can be perceived in two different 3D orientations. This suggests we are looking for an auditory phenomenon where perception can switch between two interpretations.\n\nThe specific illusion depicted is known as the **auditory continuity illusion** or **temporal induction**. In this illusion, when a sound is interrupted by a sufficiently loud noise, the brain perceptually \"fills in\" the gap, making the original sound seem continuous. The image shows exactly this: a steady tone (the horizontal line in the spectrogram and the regular sine wave in the waveform) is momentarily replaced by broadband noise (the vertical bar in the spectrogram and the more chaotic waveform). An observer would likely perceive the tone as continuing uninterrupted through the noise.\n\nA related phenomenon, particularly when the interrupted sound is speech, is the **phonemic restoration effect**. In this case, if a phoneme (a basic unit of speech sound) in a word is replaced by a noise like a cough or a buzz, listeners often perceive the word as intact. This is considered a specific instance of the more general auditory continuity illusion.\n\nBoth illusions demonstrate a key aspect of perception: the brain's tendency to create a continuous and coherent experience from incomplete sensory information, often influenced by context and prior knowledge. This \"filling-in\" is an unconscious process, making it a surprisingly common perceptual ability. The bistable nature, similar to the Necker Cube, arises because one can be aware of the interruption (the noise) and yet perceive the underlying sound as continuous.\n\nGiven the visual evidence of a simple tone being interrupted by noise, the most accurate and general name for this phenomenon is the auditory continuity illusion.\n\n<<<auditory continuity illusion"
