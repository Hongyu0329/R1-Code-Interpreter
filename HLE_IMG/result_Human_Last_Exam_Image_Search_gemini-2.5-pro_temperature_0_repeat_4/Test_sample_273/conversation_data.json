    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule shown, each of the three chiral centers must be analyzed using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. The chiral centers are the three carbon atoms on the main chain that are each bonded to four different groups. We will refer to them as the left, middle, and right chiral centers as they appear in the image.\n\n### Analysis of the Chiral Centers:\n\n**1. Rightmost Chiral Center:**\n*   **Groups Attached:**\n    1.  The rest of the carbon chain to the left.\n    2.  An aminomethyl group (-CH₂NH₂).\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃), shown with a dashed bond (pointing away).\n    4.  A hydrogen atom (H), which is implied to be on a wedged bond (pointing forward).\n*   **Priority Assignment (highest to lowest):**\n    1.  The rest of the carbon chain (highest priority due to further branching).\n    2.  The aminomethyl group (-CH₂NH₂), as nitrogen has a higher atomic number than carbon.\n    3.  The methyl group (-CH₃).\n    4.  The hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Configuration:** With the lowest priority group (H) pointing forward, the sequence from priority 1 to 2 to 3 is counter-clockwise. According to the CIP rules, this would normally indicate an S configuration, but since the hydrogen is pointing forward, the configuration is inverted to **R**.\n\n**2. Middle Chiral Center:**\n*   **Groups Attached:**\n    1.  The chiral group to the left (containing the hydroxyl group).\n    2.  The chiral group to the right.\n    3.  An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), shown with a wedged bond (pointing forward).\n    4.  A hydrogen atom (H), implied to be on a dashed bond (pointing away).\n*   **Priority Assignment:**\n    1.  The group to the left, as it contains an oxygen atom which has a higher atomic number than the atoms in the other groups.\n    2.  The group to the right, which has higher priority than the ethyl group due to the nitrogen atom in the aminomethyl group.\n    3.  The ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    4.  The hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Configuration:** The lowest priority group (H) is pointing away. The sequence from priority 1 to 2 to 3 traces a counter-clockwise path. Therefore, the configuration is **S**.\n\n**3. Leftmost Chiral Center:**\n*   **Groups Attached:**\n    1.  A hydroxyl group (-OH), shown with a dashed bond.\n    2.  The rest of the carbon chain to the right.\n    3.  A methyl group (-CH₃), also shown with a dashed bond.\n    4.  A hydrogen atom (H), which is implied to be on a wedged bond.\n*   **Priority Assignment:**\n    1.  The hydroxyl group (-OH).\n    2.  The rest of the carbon chain to the right.\n    3.  The methyl group (-CH₃).\n    4.  The hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Configuration:** The lowest priority group (H) is pointing forward. The sequence from priority 1 to 2 to 3 is clockwise. Because the hydrogen is pointing forward, the configuration is inverted from R to **S**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the absolute configuration of the molecule, from left to right, is S, S, R.\n\n<<<S, S, R>>>"
