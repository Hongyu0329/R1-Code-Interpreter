    "The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image fragment is identified as **Sö 281**.\n\nThis identification is based on the highly distinctive grid pattern in which the runes are carved, a feature that is rare on runestones. This stone is a fragment made of gneiss and is located in the Strängnäs Cathedral in Södermanland, Sweden. It was discovered being used as a doorstep in the cathedral in 1863 and was subsequently moved into the church wall.\n\nThe inscription on Sö 281 commemorates a brother of a man named Ulf who died in \"Serkland\" (the Saracen lands) while with Ingvar the Far-Travelled. The Ingvar runestones are a group of about 26 runestones from the Viking Age raised in memory of those who participated in Ingvar's ill-fated expedition to the Caspian Sea area between 1036 and 1041.\n\nThe transliterated Old Norse text on the stone reads:\n\"...[a]lui : lit · kira : kubl : ifti... ... burþur : ulfs · þiʀ · a[u]... ... [m]iþ · ikuari : o : sirk·la[t]...\"\n\nThis translates to:\n“... had the monument made in memory of … Ulv's brother. They in / to the east … with Ingvar in Serkland.”\n\n<<<Sö 281>>>"
