    "Based on the visual characteristics of the specimens and knowledge of mineralogy, the minerals are identified and ordered by increasing silicate structure complexity as follows:\n\n*   **Specimen C: Olivine**\n    This specimen displays a characteristic olive-green color and granular habit. Olivine is a **nesosilicate**, which has the simplest silicate structure, consisting of isolated silica tetrahedra linked by cations.\n\n*   **Specimen A: Pyroxene or Amphibole**\n    This is a dark, prismatic crystal. This habit is common for inosilicates like pyroxene and amphibole. Pyroxenes are **single-chain silicates**, and amphiboles are **double-chain silicates**. Both chain structures are more complex than the isolated tetrahedra of nesosilicates.\n\n*   **Specimen B: Chlorite or Mica**\n    This specimen is green and has a flaky, layered appearance, which is characteristic of **phyllosilicates** (sheet silicates). Minerals in this group, like mica and chlorite, have silica tetrahedra linked together to form continuous sheets. This sheet structure is more complex than the chain structures of inosilicates.\n\n*   **Specimen D: Quartz**\n    This translucent, brownish crystal with a glassy luster and conchoidal fracture is identifiable as smoky quartz. Quartz is a **tectosilicate**, where every silica tetrahedron shares all four of its oxygen atoms with neighboring tetrahedra, creating a complete three-dimensional framework. This is the most complex silicate structure.\n\nThe order of increasing silicate structure complexity is:\n**Nesosilicate (isolated) < Inosilicate (chain) < Phyllosilicate (sheet) < Tectosilicate (framework)**\n\nTherefore, the correct order for the specimens is C, A, B, D.\n\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
