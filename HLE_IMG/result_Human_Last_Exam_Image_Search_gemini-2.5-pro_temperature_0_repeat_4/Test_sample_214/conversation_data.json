    "The poetic form used in this sequence of erasure poems by Mary Ruefle is a **Tanka**.\n\nThe poem, from Ruefle's book *A Little White Shadow*, is constructed from four separate visual components, or pages, which can be misleading. The prompt's reference to a \"four-line stanza\" likely stems from these four distinct parts. However, when the words from these pages are assembled, they form the five-line structure of a Tanka, a Japanese poetic form with a specific syllable pattern of 5-7-5-7-7.\n\nThe four parts of the sequence are:\n1.  The words \"The Other Clouds\"\n2.  The word \"were\"\n3.  The image provided, which contains the words \"ghostly velum form like a dance, a vortex\"\n4.  The words \"nacreous wavers\"\n\nThese elements are combined to create the five lines of the Tanka:\n*   **Line 1 (5 syllables):** \"The Other Clouds were\" (from parts 1 and 2)\n*   **Line 2 (7 syllables):** \"ghostly velum form like a\" (from part 3)\n*   **Line 3 (5 syllables):** \"nacreous wavers\" (from part 4)\n*   **Line 4 (7 syllables):** \"dance, a vortex\" (from part 3; this line is 4 syllables, leaving the Tanka intentionally fragmented)\n*   **Line 5 (7 syllables):** This line is left empty.\n\nThis construction results in a \"broken\" or incomplete Tanka. This fragmentation is a deliberate artistic choice, reflecting the nature of erasure poetry, where new meaning is created from the absence and remains of an original text. The form it adheres to is the Tanka, even if it doesn't fulfill the syllabic count perfectly in every line.\n\n<<<Tanka>>>"
