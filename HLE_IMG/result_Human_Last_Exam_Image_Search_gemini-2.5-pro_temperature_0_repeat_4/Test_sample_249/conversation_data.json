    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. Based on the distinctive honeycomb-like pattern of its scales, the animal is a **Pineapplefish**.\n\nThe scientific name for the Pineapplefish is ***Cleidopus gloriamaris***.\n\nThis fish is also known by other names, including the Knightfish and the Coat-of-Mail fish, due to its armor-like scales. Its specific name, *gloriamaris*, is Latin for \"glory of the sea\". The striking pattern of yellow to whitish scales with black rear margins gives the fish its pineapple-like appearance. This species is native to the waters around Australia and can be found in reefs and harbors.\n\nAnother fish with a similar honeycomb pattern is the Honeycomb Cowfish (*Acanthostracion polygonius*), but the specific pattern in the image is more characteristic of the Pineapplefish.\n\n<<<Cleidopus gloriamaris>>>"
