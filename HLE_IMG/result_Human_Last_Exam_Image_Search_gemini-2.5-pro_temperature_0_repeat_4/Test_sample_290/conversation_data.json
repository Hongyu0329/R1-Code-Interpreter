    "Based on the visual evidence in the image and corroborating search results, the photograph was taken at **Richmond Beach Saltwater Park** in the city of **Shoreline, Washington**.\n\nThe key features that identify this location are:\n\n*   **Chain-Link Fence and Railroad Tracks:** The most definitive clue is the chain-link fence in the foreground, which is positioned to separate a viewing area from the beach. Numerous sources confirm that Richmond Beach Saltwater Park has a pedestrian bridge and pathways that run alongside and over BNSF railway tracks to get to the shoreline. This fencing is a necessary safety feature due to the active train line. One source explicitly mentions a fence between the beach and the train tracks.\n*   **Sunset View:** The park is noted for its beautiful sunset views over Puget Sound, which match the lighting conditions in the photograph.\n*   **Beach and Shoreline:** The image shows a dark, sandy or pebbly beach with driftwood, which is characteristic of Richmond Beach. The treeline visible across the water is consistent with the views from this location.\n*   **Bonfire:** While Seattle's Golden Gardens and Alki Beach are more famous for legal bonfires in designated pits, the fire in the image is a contributing element to the scene. Although one source states fires are not permitted at Richmond Beach, another mentions a fire pit section, and a park master plan from 2007 refers to \"beach barbecues.\" Regardless of the fire's official sanction, the combination of the fence, the implied presence of train tracks, and the specific geography strongly points to this park.\n\nThe photograph was likely taken from the pedestrian overpass or a bluff trail, looking down at the beach at sunset.\n\n<<<Shoreline, Washington>>>"
