    "Based on the visual characteristics of the protein structure in the image, and through cross-referencing with protein databases, the protein is identified as **human pro-cathepsin L**.\n\nThe image displays the crystal structure of a mutant of human pro-cathepsin L, which is a type of cysteine protease. This protein is synthesized as an inactive proenzyme. The structure clearly shows two distinct domains:\n\n*   The larger dark blue region is the mature cathepsin L enzyme.\n*   The smaller, light blue segment is the N-terminal prosegment. This prosegment consists of three alpha-helices and has a globular form. It functions to inhibit the enzyme's activity until it is cleaved.\n\nThis particular structural representation is cataloged in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under the accession code 1CS8.\n\n<<<human pro-cathepsin L>>>"
