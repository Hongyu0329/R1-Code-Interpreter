    "The molecule shown in the image is a synthetic carbon nanoring. More specifically, it is a macrocycle composed of eight para-phenylene units, four cis-ethenylene (-CH=CH-) units, and four ethynylene (-Câ‰¡C-) units.\n\nThis particular nanostructure was first synthesized and characterized by a team of chemists, and in their scientific publication, they refer to it as **\"nanoring 1\"**. A more descriptive name for the molecule is a **carbon nanoring composed of four p-phenylene-cis-ethenylene and four p-phenylene-ethynylene units**.\n\n<<<a carbon nanoring composed of four p-phenylene-cis-ethenylene and four p-phenylene-ethynylene units>>>"
