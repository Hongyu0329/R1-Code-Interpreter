    "The chemical transformation shown involves two main steps. The first is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, and the second is the formation of a substituted imidazole ring.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\nButylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃), a Lewis acid catalyst. This reaction attaches the bromoacetyl group (-COCH₂Br) to the benzene ring, primarily at the para position due to the directing effect of the butyl group. The product of this first step is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n**Step 2: Imidazole Ring Formation**\nThe intermediate, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, which is an α-haloketone, reacts with the unknown reactant to form the final product. The final product is a 1,2-disubstituted 4-aryl-imidazole. Specifically, its structure is *tert*-butyl (2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1*H*-imidazol-1-yl)carbamate.\n\nTo form this structure from the α-bromoketone, the reactant must provide the remaining atoms of the imidazole ring and its substituents. The α-bromoketone provides the C4 and C5 atoms of the ring and the butylphenyl substituent. The reactant must therefore supply the N1, C2, and N3 atoms, along with the amino group at C2 and the *tert*-butoxycarbonylamino (-NH-Boc) group at N1.\n\nThe molecule that fits this requirement is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine**, which is also known as *tert*-butyl N-(amino(imino)methyl)hydrazine-1-carboxylate.\n\nThe reaction proceeds through a cyclocondensation mechanism, a common method for synthesizing substituted imidazoles from α-haloketones.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine>>>"
