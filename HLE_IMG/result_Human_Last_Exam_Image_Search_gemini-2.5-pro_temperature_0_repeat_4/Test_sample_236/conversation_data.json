    "The animal depicted in the center of the image is the Goldenrod Soldier Beetle. Its scientific name is *Chauliognathus pensylvanicus*.\n\nThis insect is also commonly known as the Pennsylvania leatherwing. It is a species of soldier beetle frequently found on goldenrod and other yellow flowers in late summer and early fall.\n\n**Description:**\nThe Goldenrod Soldier Beetle is about half an inch to three-quarters of an inch long. It has a distinctive orange, elongated body with black markings. The head and legs are black, and there is a prominent black spot on the thorax (the part behind the head) and a black patch at the tip of each of its soft, flexible wing covers. These soft wing covers are a characteristic that earns them the name \"leatherwings.\"\n\n**Habitat and Behavior:**\nThese beetles are common throughout North America, particularly in the Midwest. They are often found in meadows and fields on a variety of flowers, though they show a preference for yellow ones like goldenrod. Adults feed on pollen and nectar, and also prey on small insects like aphids. They are considered beneficial insects as they help with pollination and control pest populations.\n\n<<<*Chauliognathus pensylvanicus*>>>"
