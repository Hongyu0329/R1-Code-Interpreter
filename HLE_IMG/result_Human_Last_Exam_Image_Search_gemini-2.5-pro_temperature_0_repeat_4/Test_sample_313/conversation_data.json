    "The correct answer is **Calder**. Here is the explanation:\n\nThe question presents a two-part riddle that connects an event pictured on a specific date with an obsolete industrial process.\n\n*   **The Image and the Event:** The image shows Nikita Kucherov of the Tampa Bay Lightning receiving an award from NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman. This event is the 2019 NHL Awards ceremony, which took place in Las Vegas on June 19, 2019, a day off from the date mentioned in the prompt. At this same awards ceremony, the **Calder** Memorial Trophy is presented to the league's rookie of the year.\n\n*   **The Chemical Process:** The second clue refers to a process that has been discontinued due to the toxicity of mercury salts. This clue points to the **Caldero** process, an old method for extracting silver from ore that used mercury and is now obsolete. The name \"Caldero\" is a very close match to \"Calder.\" Mining operations, such as those at the McDermitt caldera, have used processes that resulted in mercury contamination requiring significant environmental cleanup.\n\nTherefore, \"X Y\" is **Calder**, which links the Calder Memorial Trophy awarded at the pictured event to the obsolete and toxic Caldero mercury process.\n\n<<<Calder>>>"
