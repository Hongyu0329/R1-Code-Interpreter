    "The characters on the seal, read from top to bottom and right to left, are 霍諝不巖.\n\nIn simplified Chinese, the characters are: **霍诩不岩 (huò xǔ bù yán)**.\n\n*   **霍 (huò):** This is a surname.\n*   **诩 (xǔ):** The traditional form is 諝. It can mean to praise or be related to intelligence. 霍諝 was the name of a scholar-official in the Eastern Han Dynasty.\n*   **不 (bù):** This character means \"not\".\n*   **岩 (yán):** The traditional form is 巖. It means \"rock\" or \"cliff,\" and can metaphorically describe someone as stern or imposing.\n\nThe phrase \"不岩\" (bù yán) likely serves as a personal motto or style name, suggesting a personality that is \"not stern\" or \"approachable.\" Therefore, the seal most likely belongs to a person named 霍諝 (Huo Xu) with the style name 不巖 (Bu Yan).\n\n<<<霍诩不岩>>>"
