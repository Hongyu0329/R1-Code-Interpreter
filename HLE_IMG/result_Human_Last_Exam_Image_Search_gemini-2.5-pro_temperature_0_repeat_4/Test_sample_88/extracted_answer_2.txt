**Product A (C₁₄H₂₀N₂O₃):** The [2+2] cycloadduct of ketene (derived from acetic anhydride) and the primary [3+2] cycloadduct. The primary [3+2] cycloadduct is formed from the reaction of the azomethine ylide (generated from the starting material) and methyl propiolate.

**Product B (C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₃):** The N-oxide of the fully aromatized [3+2] cycloadduct. The initial cycloadduct undergoes oxidative aromatization of both the pyrrolizidine core and the dihydropyrrole substituent, followed by N-oxidation of the pyrrolizine nitrogen.

**Product C (C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₃):** The acetylated starting material. This is a side product formed by the C-acetylation of the enamine tautomer of (3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)proline with acetic anhydride.
