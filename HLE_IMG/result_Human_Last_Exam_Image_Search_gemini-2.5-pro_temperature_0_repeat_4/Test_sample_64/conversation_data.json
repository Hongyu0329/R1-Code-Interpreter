    "The process depicted in the image is the formation of a **clamp connection** in a fungal hypha. This is a characteristic process in many species of Basidiomycota fungi.\n\nThe three panels show the progression of this formation:\n*   **Panel L:** Shows the tip of a hypha with two nuclei (not distinctly visible but implied by the process) in the terminal cell, separated from the subterminal cell by a septum (the cross-wall indicated by the arrowhead).\n*   **Panel M:** A small, hook-like structure, which is the beginning of the clamp connection, starts to grow from the terminal cell in a backward direction. The arrowhead points to the initiation of this clamp.\n*   **Panel N:** The clamp continues to grow and curve back, preparing to fuse with the subterminal cell.\n\nClamp connections are specialized structures that ensure each new cell in a growing hypha receives a pair of genetically distinct nuclei after cell division. This process is crucial for maintaining the dikaryotic (n+n) state of the mycelium, which is a key feature of the life cycle of many basidiomycetes, including the fungus *Schizophyllum commune* from which this image was taken. The presence or absence of clamp connections is an important feature used in the classification of fungal species.\n\n<<<clamp connection formation>>>"
