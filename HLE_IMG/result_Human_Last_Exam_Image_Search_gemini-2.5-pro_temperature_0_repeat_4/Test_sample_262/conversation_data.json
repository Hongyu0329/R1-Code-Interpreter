    "To determine which of the four depicted iridium complexes are expected to show shorter lifetimes as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), we must analyze their molecular structures and relate them to known degradation pathways for such compounds.\n\n### Structural Analysis of the Complexes\n\nAll four complexes share a common structure: a cationic iridium(III) core, `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+`, with a PF6‚Åª counter-ion. The ancillary diimine ligand (`N^N`) is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine in all cases. The key difference between the complexes lies in the substitution pattern of the two cyclometalating phenylpyridine (`C^N`) ligands. Specifically, the number and position of fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring vary.\n\n*   **Complex 1:** The phenyl rings are substituted with two fluorine atoms at the 4- and 5-positions (relative to the C-Ir bond). This means there are no fluorine atoms at the *ortho*-position (position 2).\n*   **Complex 2:** The phenyl rings are substituted with two fluorine atoms at the 2- and 4-positions. This complex has a fluorine atom at the *ortho*-position.\n*   **Complex 3:** The phenyl rings are substituted with a single fluorine atom at the 2-position. This complex also has a fluorine atom at the *ortho*-position.\n*   **Complex 4:** The phenyl rings are substituted with three fluorine atoms at the 2-, 3-, and 4-positions. This complex also features a fluorine atom at the *ortho*-position.\n\n### Relationship Between Structure and Emitter Lifetime\n\nThe operational stability and lifetime of iridium(III) emitters in LECs are critically dependent on the strength and stability of the bonds within the molecule, particularly the Ir-C bond of the cyclometalating ligand. A well-established principle in the design of organometallic emitters is that substituents at the *ortho*-position of the cyclometalated phenyl ring can significantly impact device lifetime.\n\nSpecifically, the presence of a fluorine atom at the *ortho*-position (adjacent to the Ir-C bond) is known to be detrimental to the stability of the complex. This instability leads to faster degradation of the emitter during device operation and, consequently, a shorter lifetime for the LEC. The degradation can occur through mechanisms such as reductive elimination involving the C-F bond.\n\nApplying this principle to the four complexes:\n*   **Complex 1** lacks an *ortho*-fluorine substituent. This configuration is generally associated with higher stability and longer operational lifetimes.\n*   **Complexes 2, 3, and 4** all possess at least one fluorine atom in the *ortho*-position of the phenylpyridine ligands. This structural feature makes them more susceptible to degradation under the operating conditions of an LEC.\n\nTherefore, Complexes 2, 3, and 4 are expected to exhibit shorter lifetimes compared to Complex 1.\n\n<<<N>>>"
