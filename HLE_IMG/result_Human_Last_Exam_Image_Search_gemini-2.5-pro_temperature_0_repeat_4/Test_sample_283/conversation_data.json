    "Based on the recurring annual spikes in the Google Trends data, the country in question is Poland. The graph shows interest in three significant historical events that are commemorated annually.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the events corresponding to the colored lines on the graph:\n*   **Yellow Line:** This line shows a sharp spike in interest around the end of August and the beginning of September each year. This corresponds to two major World War II anniversaries in Poland:\n    *   **The Warsaw Uprising:** Commemorated annually, beginning on August 1st. The uprising in 1944 was a 63-day struggle by the Polish Home Army to liberate Warsaw from German occupation.\n    *   **The Outbreak of World War II:** Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, an event marked with solemn ceremonies each year.\n\n*   **Blue Line:** This line shows a smaller, but consistent, spike in late spring. This likely represents the **Day of Remembrance for the Victims of the Katyn Massacre**, which is observed on April 13th. This day commemorates the mass execution of nearly 22,000 Polish military officers and intelligentsia by the Soviet NKVD in 1940.\n\n*   **Red Line:** This line has a more complex pattern with peaks in the winter and late spring. This could represent a combination of historical remembrances:\n    *   **Polish Independence Day:** Celebrated on November 11th, this major national holiday marks Poland regaining its independence in 1918. This could contribute to the early winter interest.\n    *   **End of World War II in Europe:** Commemorated on May 8th, this would align with the late spring spike.\n    *   Other significant historical dates, such as the adoption of the **Constitution of May 3, 1791**, are also celebrated and could contribute to the spring interest.\n\nThe consistent, annual pattern of these searches, aligned with key dates in Polish history, strongly indicates that the country is Poland.\n\n<<<Poland>>>"
