    "The plant in the image is endemic to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand.\n\nThe plant is identifiable as *Veronica dieffenbachii* (previously *Hebe dieffenbachii*), commonly known as Dieffenbach's koromiko. This bushy shrub is distinguished by its dark green, narrow leaves and is native exclusively to the Chatham Islands archipelago, which includes Chatham, Pitt, Mangere, and South East Islands.\n\nWhile the plant in the photograph strongly resembles common garden hybrids like *Hebe x franciscana* 'Blue Gem', the question asks for the endemic location of the species. *Hebe x franciscana* is a hybrid of two other New Zealand native species, *Hebe speciosa* and *Hebe elliptica*. However, *Veronica dieffenbachii* is a distinct species endemic specifically to the Chatham Islands and is a very close visual match. It grows in coastal areas, often in mixed shrubland and along forest margins.\n\nThe Chatham Islands are known for their unique flora, with about 47 plant species that are found nowhere else in the world. *Veronica dieffenbachii* is one of these unique endemic plants.\n\n<<<Chatham Islands>>>"
