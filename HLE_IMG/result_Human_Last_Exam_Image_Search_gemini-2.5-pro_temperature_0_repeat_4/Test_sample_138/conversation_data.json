    "Based on the distinct biological characteristics of the insects shown, the sexes for each pair can be determined.\n\n*   **Pair A:** These are cuckoo bees of the genus *Coelioxys*. Females in this genus are identified by a distinctly pointed, conical abdomen, which they use to pierce the nests of their host bees to lay eggs. The insect on the right has this characteristic sharply pointed abdomen, identifying it as a female. Males, in contrast, have a less pointed abdomen which is often armed with spines or teeth at the tip. The insect on the left has a blunter abdomen and what appear to be longer antennae, consistent with a male. Therefore, pair A is Male, Female.\n\n*   **Pair B:** These are paper wasps of the genus *Polistes*. In many *Polistes* species, males can be distinguished from females by their facial markings. Males often have a predominantly yellow face, while females have more black or brown markings. The wasp on the right has a mostly yellow face, indicating it is a male. The wasp on the left has a darker face with less yellow, identifying it as a female. Additionally, male paper wasps often have antennae with curled tips, a feature subtly visible on the right-hand insect. Thus, pair B is Female, Male.\n\n*   **Pair C:** These are long-horned bees, likely from the tribe Eucerini (e.g., genus *Melissodes*). A significant difference between the sexes in this group is the length of the antennae. Males have exceptionally long antennae, often as long as or longer than their bodies, which gives them their common name. The bee on the left clearly displays these very long antennae, identifying it as a male. Females have much shorter antennae. The bee on the right has noticeably shorter antennae, making it a female.\n\nFollowing this analysis, the correct indices are:\nA: M, F (3)\nB: F, M (4)\nC: M, F (3)\n\n3, 4, 3\n<<<3, 4, 3>>>"
