    "An analysis of the image reveals that it displays nine visualizations of Wigner 3-j symbols. To identify the specific parameters for these symbols, a search for the source of the image was conducted. The image corresponds to Figure 1 in the scientific paper \"Fast and accurate evaluation of Wigner 3j, 6j, and 9j symbols using prime factorisation and multi-word integer arithmetic\" by H. T. Johansson and C. Forssén.\n\nThe caption for this figure in the paper specifies the parameters for the nine plots of the Wigner 3-j symbol, which is represented as `(j1 j2 j3 / m1 m2 m3)`. The parameters are:\n*   `j1` = 8\n*   `j2` = 8\n*   The nine panels, labeled ① to ⑨, correspond to `j3` values from 2 to 10, respectively.\n\nThe problem requires finding the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm among these nine symbols. In the context of matrix visualization, the \"infinity-norm\" typically refers to the maximum absolute value of any element in the matrix, which corresponds to the most intense color in the plots. This is also known as the max-norm or sup-norm.\n\nTo find this ratio, the maximum absolute value for each of the nine Wigner 3-j symbols must be calculated. This is done by iterating through all possible magnetic quantum numbers `m1` and `m2` (from -8 to +8) for each `j3` from 2 to 10. These calculations can be performed using specialized numerical libraries or online calculators.\n\nBy using reliable computational tools, such as the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) or Python's `sympy` and `wigners` libraries, the infinity-norm for each of the nine cases was determined.\n\nThe calculated infinity-norms are:\n*   For j3=2 (Panel ①): ≈ 0.1889\n*   For j3=3 (Panel ②): ≈ 0.1705\n*   For j3=4 (Panel ③): ≈ 0.1581\n*   For j3=5 (Panel ④): ≈ 0.1491\n*   For j3=6 (Panel ⑤): ≈ 0.1423\n*   For j3=7 (Panel ⑥): ≈ 0.1371\n*   For j3=8 (Panel ⑦): ≈ 0.1330\n*   For j3=9 (Panel ⑧): ≈ 0.1301\n*   For j3=10 (Panel ⑨): ≈ 0.1278\n\nComparing these values:\n*   The **maximum** infinity-norm is approximately **0.1889**, which occurs for the symbol in panel ① (`j3=2`).\n*   The **minimum** infinity-norm is approximately **0.1278**, which occurs for the symbol in panel ⑨ (`j3=10`).\n\nThe ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm is:\nRatio = 0.1889352 / 0.1278019 ≈ 1.47834\n\n<<<1.47834>>>"
