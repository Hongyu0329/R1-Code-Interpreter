    "The circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, form a G-sharp diminished seventh chord.\n\nTo determine the correct Roman numeral, we must analyze the chord in the context of the piece's key, which is D minor.\n\n*   **Notes:** The notes in the arpeggiated chord are G-sharp, B, D, and F.\n*   **Chord Quality:** When stacked in thirds (G#-B-D-F), these notes create a G-sharp diminished seventh chord (G#°7).\n*   **Function in D minor:** The key of D minor has a dominant chord of A major (V), which contains the leading-tone C-sharp. The chord in question, G#°7, functions as the leading-tone chord to the dominant (A). The note G-sharp is the leading tone to A. Therefore, this chord is a secondary leading-tone chord.\n\nIn Roman numeral analysis, a secondary leading-tone chord is indicated as vii°7 of the chord it leads to. Since this G#°7 chord leads to the V chord (A major), its proper Roman numeral is vii°7/V.\n\n<<<vii°7/V>>>"
