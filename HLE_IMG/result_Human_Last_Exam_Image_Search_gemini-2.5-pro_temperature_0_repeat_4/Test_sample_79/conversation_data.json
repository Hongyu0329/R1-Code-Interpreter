    "The square structure visible at the coordinates 29° 06' 18.75''N and 103° 47' 50.28''W is the archaeological site of a Spanish fort known as **Presidio de Belén**, which was part of the larger **Presidio del Norte**. This historic site is located in Presidio County, Texas, in a region historically known as La Junta de los Ríos, where the Río Conchos and the Rio Grande meet.\n\nThis area is considered the oldest continuously cultivated region in the United States, with evidence of farming dating back centuries. The first Europeans, a Spanish expedition led by Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, arrived in 1535. The Spanish established missions in the 1680s and later built presidios, or forts, to protect their interests and the missions from Indian raids.\n\nCaptain Alonso Rubín de Celís began construction of the Presidio de Belén on the Texas side of the Rio Grande in 1759, and it was completed in the summer of 1760. The fort was attacked by Native Americans on the very day of its completion. The presidio was briefly abandoned in 1766 but was re-established by order of the King of Spain in 1772.\n\nThe site is a significant historical landmark, representing the Spanish colonial frontier in Texas. The region of La Junta de los Ríos was a cultural crossroads for various native groups and later for the Spanish, becoming a key point for trade, conflict, and cultural exchange. The name of Presidio County itself is a reference to the historic fort. Today, the faint outline of the adobe fort is all that remains visible from an aerial view.\n\n<<<The square ancient structure is the archaeological site of the Spanish fort Presidio de Belén, a significant historic landmark in Presidio, Texas.>>>"
