    "Upon examining the image, the main character is holding a large, horn-shaped container that is overflowing with red flowers and fruit.\n\nA cornucopia, also known as a horn of plenty, is a symbol of abundance and is typically a large, horn-shaped basket filled with produce and flowers. This matches the object in the woman's arms. While she is holding red flowers (which could be roses) and fruit, these are the contents of the larger object. The most accurate and complete description of what she is holding is a cornucopia filled with these items. The teardrop shape is a small detail, and there is no moth under glass.\n\nTherefore, the best description is a cornucopia of fruit and flowers.\n\n<<<C>>>"
