    "The reaction shown is an acid-catalyzed dehydration of a dammarane-type triterpenoid, which initiates a cascade of shifts known as a backbone rearrangement. This type of rearrangement is a classic example of a Wagner-Meerwein shift. The process is driven by the formation of more stable carbocation intermediates and the relief of steric strain.\n\nThe mechanism proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Carbocation Formation:** The alcohol at position C3 is protonated by HCl and leaves as a water molecule, forming a secondary carbocation at C3.\n2.  ** Shifts Cascade:** A series of sequential-hydride (H⁻) and-methyl (CH₃⁻) shifts occur, moving the positive charge through the carbon skeleton. This cascade proceeds in a concerted, anti-periplanar fashion.\n    *   A methyl group from C4 migrates to C3. The positive charge is now at C4 (tertiary).\n    *   A hydrogen from C5 migrates to C4. The positive charge is now at C5 (tertiary).\n    *   The methyl group from C10 migrates to C5. The positive charge is now at C10 (tertiary).\n    *   A hydrogen from C9 migrates to C10. The positive charge is now at C9.\n    *   A hydrogen from C8 migrates to C9. The positive charge is now at C8 (tertiary).\n    *   The methyl group from C14 migrates to C8. The positive charge is now at C14 (tertiary).\n    *   A hydrogen from C13 migrates to C14. The positive charge is now at C13 (tertiary).\n3.  **Elimination:** Finally, a proton is eliminated from C12 to form the stable, tetrasubstituted double bond seen in the final product.\n\nBy tracking the movement of each group, we can determine the final substituents at the indicated positions:\n\n*   **Position 1 (originally C4):** Started with two CH₃ groups. One migrated away, and an H migrated in. The remaining group is **CH₃**.\n*   **Position 2 (originally C10):** Started with a CH₃ group, which migrated away. An H migrated in. The final substituent is **H**.\n*   **Position 3 (originally C9):** Started with an H, which migrated away. Another H migrated in. The final substituent is **H**.\n*   **Position 4 (originally C8):** Started with an H, which migrated away. A CH₃ group migrated in. The final substituent is **CH₃**.\n*   **Position 5 (originally C14):** Started with a CH₃ group, which migrated away. An H migrated in. The final substituent is **H**.\n\nTherefore, the substituents at the numbered positions are:\n\n1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
