    "The book that has the presented fragment on its cover is \"Stalking the Unicorn\" by Mike Resnick. The cover art was created by the renowned fantasy artist Boris Vallejo and was published by Tor Books in 1987.\n\nThe novel is a blend of the fantasy and mystery genres, following the story of a private investigator from New York, John Justin Mallory, who is hired by an elf to find a stolen unicorn. The narrative takes Mallory into an alternate, magical version of Manhattan filled with mythical creatures as he races against time to solve the case.\n\nThe cover art by Boris Vallejo depicts a dynamic and fantastical scene that captures the essence of the novel. The fragment provided is a clear match to the unicorn featured on the cover of the 1987 edition of the book.\n\n<<<Stalking the Unicorn>>>"
