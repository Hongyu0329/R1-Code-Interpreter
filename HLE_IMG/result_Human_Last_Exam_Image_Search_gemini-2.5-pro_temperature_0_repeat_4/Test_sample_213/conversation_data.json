    "The piece of sheet music is the opening of the second act of the opera **Wozzeck** by Alban Berg.\n\nThis can be determined by several key features visible in the score. The instrumentation, which includes parts for \"2 gr. Fl.\" (two grand flutes), \"engl. Horn\" (English horn), and various string sections with specific instructions like \"(mit DÃ¤mpfer)\" (with mute), is characteristic of early 20th-century German opera. The musical style, with its complex harmonies and atmospheric texture, is a hallmark of the Second Viennese School, to which Berg belonged. Most definitively, the marking \"(Vorhang),\" which is German for \"Curtain,\" at rehearsal mark 1 confirms this is the beginning of a scene. A search of operatic scores reveals this specific musical passage to be the start of Act II of *Wozzeck*.\n\n<<<Wozzeck>>>"
