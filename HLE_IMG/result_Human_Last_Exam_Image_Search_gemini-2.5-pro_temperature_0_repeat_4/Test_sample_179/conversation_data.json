    "The piano piece shown in the image is Frédéric Chopin's \"Fantaisie-Impromptu\".\n\nThis composition is in the key of C-sharp minor. The visualization clearly shows the characteristic opening arpeggios. The piece was composed in 1834 but was published after Chopin's death. It was assigned the posthumous opus number 66.\n\nTherefore, the correct opus number is 66. None of the answer choices match this number. There might be an error in the question or the provided answer choices. However, if forced to choose the closest option, it's important to note that Chopin's *Grande valse brillante* is Op. 18 and his *Four Mazurkas* are Op. 17, both composed in the same year as the Fantaisie-Impromptu. His *Piano Sonata No. 2*, which contains the famous \"Funeral March,\" is Op. 35. The other opus numbers listed do not correspond to widely known piano pieces by Chopin that match this musical pattern.\n\nGiven the provided options and the confirmed identity of the piece as Fantaisie-Impromptu, Op. 66, none of the answers are correct. There seems to be a mistake in the question's answer choices.\n\nAssuming there is a typo in the question and it refers to another piece, or a significant error in the options, let's re-evaluate. However, the musical passage is unmistakably the Fantaisie-Impromptu. The opus number for this piece is definitively 66.\n\nSince I must provide an answer based on the visual information, and the visual information points to a piece with an opus number not listed, I cannot logically select any of the given choices. The premise of the question is flawed.\n\nHowever, for the purpose of completing the task, I will point out the discrepancy. The piece is Fantaisie-Impromptu, Op. 66. None of the choices are correct.\n\n<<<E"
