    "The provided image displays four distinct rock specimens, labeled H, I, J, and K. Based on their visual characteristics and geological classifications, they can be identified as follows:\n\n**Specimen H: Scoria**\nThis rock is characterized by its reddish-brown color and highly vesicular texture, meaning it is riddled with gas bubbles. This appearance is typical of scoria, a type of volcanic rock that forms when gas-rich lava is ejected and cools rapidly. The red color is a result of the oxidation of iron during the eruption. Unlike pumice, scoria has a higher density and will not float in water.\n\n**Specimen I: Volcanic Breccia**\nSpecimen I is composed of large, angular fragments of other rocks cemented together in a finer-grained matrix. This texture defines it as a breccia. Given the context of the other volcanic specimens, this is likely a volcanic breccia, which can be formed by explosive volcanic activity or the compaction of lava chunks and ash. The angularity of the fragments indicates they were not transported far from their source before being cemented together.\n\n**Specimen J: Pumice**\nThis specimen is a light-colored, highly porous rock. Its frothy appearance is due to a high concentration of vesicles created by gas escaping during a rapid, explosive volcanic eruption. Pumice is essentially a volcanic glass foam and is often so low in density that it can float on water. It is typically light in color, ranging from white to gray or tan.\n\n**Specimen K: Pegmatite**\nThis rock displays very large, interlocking crystals, a key characteristic of pegmatite. Pegmatites are igneous rocks that form during the final stages of magma crystallization, where water-rich fluids allow for the growth of exceptionally large crystals. While most pegmatites have a composition similar to granite, consisting of quartz, feldspar, and mica, the term \"pegmatite\" primarily refers to this very coarse-grained texture.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Volcanic Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
