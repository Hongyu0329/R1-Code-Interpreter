    "The product is Bovril.\n\nThe advertisement shown, with the headline \"Women are winning the War - of Freedom,\" was part of a campaign for Bovril, a salty meat extract paste. The ad campaign claimed to help the new workforce of women overcome the \"inherent limitations\" of their sex by providing them with the strength of beef.\n\nThe name \"Bovril\" was created in the 1870s and has a partially French-derived origin. The \"Bo-\" part of the name comes from the Latin word *bos*, meaning ox. The French word for beef, *boeuf*, stems from this same Latin root. The second part of the name, \"-vril,\" was taken from a popular 1871 novel, *The Coming Race*, where \"Vril\" was an energy-giving fluid.\n\n<<<Bovril>>>"
