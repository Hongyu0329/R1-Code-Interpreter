    "To calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we will follow these steps:\n1.  Calculate the total Car VMT for the Baseline scenario (Table 1).\n2.  Calculate the total Car VMT for the Proposed scenario (Table 2).\n3.  Calculate the percentage reduction using the results from the first two steps.\n\nFor these calculations, we will assume a total of 1,000 trips to simplify the process. The final percentage will be independent of the total number of trips assumed.\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of trips for each distance category based on the \"share of total trips\":\n*   **0-3 miles:** 48% of 1,000 = 480 trips\n*   **3-5 miles:** 22% of 1,000 = 220 trips\n*   **5-10 miles:** 14% of 1,000 = 140 trips\n*   **10+ miles:** 16% of 1,000 = 160 trips\n\nThe average trip distance for each category is:\n*   **0-3 miles:** 1 mile\n*   **3-5 miles:** 4 miles\n*   **5-10 miles:** 7.5 miles\n*   **10+ miles:** 20 miles\n\n### Step 1: Calculate Baseline Car VMT\n\nWe calculate the VMT for each distance segment by multiplying the number of trips by the mode share for cars and the average trip distance. We sum the VMT for \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n\n*   **VMT (0-3 miles):** 480 trips * (25% + 28%) * 1 mile = 480 * 0.53 * 1 = 254.4 miles\n*   **VMT (3-5 miles):** 220 trips * (38% + 43%) * 4 miles = 220 * 0.81 * 4 = 712.8 miles\n*   **VMT (5-10 miles):** 140 trips * (40% + 45%) * 7.5 miles = 140 * 0.85 * 7.5 = 892.5 miles\n*   **VMT (10+ miles):** 160 trips * (42% + 47%) * 20 miles = 160 * 0.89 * 20 = 2,848.0 miles\n\n**Total Baseline Car VMT** = 254.4 + 712.8 + 892.5 + 2,848.0 = **4,707.7 miles**\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Proposed Car VMT\n\nWe repeat the calculation using the mode share percentages from Table 2.\n\n*   **VMT (0-3 miles):** 480 trips * (1% + 2%) * 1 mile = 480 * 0.03 * 1 = 14.4 miles\n*   **VMT (3-5 miles):** 220 trips * (8% + 19%) * 4 miles = 220 * 0.27 * 4 = 237.6 miles\n*   **VMT (5-10 miles):** 140 trips * (14% + 27%) * 7.5 miles = 140 * 0.41 * 7.5 = 430.5 miles\n*   **VMT (10+ miles):** 160 trips * (16% + 33%) * 20 miles = 160 * 0.49 * 20 = 1,568.0 miles\n\n**Total Proposed Car VMT** = 14.4 + 237.6 + 430.5 + 1,568.0 = **2,250.5 miles**\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Percentage Reduction\n\nThe reduction in VMT is the difference between the Baseline and Proposed VMT. The percentage reduction is this difference divided by the Baseline VMT.\n\n*   **VMT Reduction:** 4,707.7 miles - 2,250.5 miles = 2,457.2 miles\n*   **Percentage Reduction:** (2,457.2 / 4,707.7) * 100% â‰ˆ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
