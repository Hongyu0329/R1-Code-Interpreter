    "The secret word encrypted in the image is hidden within the colorful static pattern that serves as the background for the main character. This technique of hiding a message within another image is a form of steganography. While it can be done in complex ways by altering the digital data of the image, in this case, it is a visual puzzle.\n\nUpon close inspection of the static field, the letters \"C A K E\" can be discerned. The letters are formed by the pixels in the static but are arranged to create readable shapes. The presence of the Minecraft cake in the upper right corner of the image serves as a direct clue, reinforcing that \"CAKE\" is the hidden word. The main character in the image is Urotsuki, the protagonist of the game *Yume 2kki*. In the game, there is a \"Cake Effect\" that Urotsuki can acquire.\n\n<<<CAKE>>>"
