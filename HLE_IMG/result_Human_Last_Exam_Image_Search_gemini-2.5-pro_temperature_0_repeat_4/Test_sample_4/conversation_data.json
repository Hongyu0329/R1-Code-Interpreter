    "The knot depicted in the image is known in knot theory as the prime knot 9_42.\n\nThe Jones polynomial, denoted as V(t), for the 9_42 knot is:\n\n$t^2 - t + 2 - t^{-1} + t^{-2} - t^{-3} + t^{-4}$\n\nAn interesting characteristic of the 9_42 knot is that it is non-amphichiral, meaning it is different from its mirror image. However, its Jones polynomial is the same as that of its mirror image, which is an unusual property.\n\n<<<t^2 - t + 2 - t^{-1} + t^{-2} - t^{-3} + t^{-4}>>>"
