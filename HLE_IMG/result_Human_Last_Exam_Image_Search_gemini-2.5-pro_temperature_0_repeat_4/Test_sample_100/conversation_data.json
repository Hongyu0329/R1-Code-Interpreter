    "The reaction scheme involves three sequential transformations to arrive at the final product. The molecular formula of the product is determined by analyzing the changes occurring in each step.\n\n**Step 1: Deprotection of the PMB group**\n\nThe starting material is treated with ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) in a mixture of acetonitrile and water. CAN is a common reagent used for the oxidative deprotection of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers and amines. In this step, the PMB group (C8H9O) attached to the nitrogen atom is cleaved, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen, forming Intermediate 1. This results in a loss of C8H8O from the starting material.\n\n**Step 2: Hydrogenation**\n\nIntermediate 1 is then subjected to catalytic hydrogenation using palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2) in methanol. This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond within the bicyclic ring system to a single bond by adding two hydrogen atoms. This transformation leads to the formation of Intermediate 2. The CF3 group and the lactam (cyclic amide) are unaffected under these conditions.\n\n**Step 3: Hydrolysis of the Lactam**\n\nFinally, Intermediate 2 is treated with 4 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 70 Â°C. These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the lactam. During hydrolysis, a molecule of water (H2O) is added across the amide bond, cleaving the ring. This process converts the cyclic amide into an amino acid, where the carbonyl group becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and the nitrogen atom becomes an amino group (-NH2).\n\n**Determination of the Final Molecular Formula**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The molecular formula of the starting material, 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-(p-methoxybenzyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one, is C15H14F3NO2.\n2.  **Intermediate 1:** After the removal of the PMB group (-C8H9O) and the addition of a hydrogen atom (+H), the change is a net loss of C8H8O. The formula for Intermediate 1 is C7H6F3NO.\n3.  **Intermediate 2:** The hydrogenation of the double bond adds two hydrogen atoms (+H2). The formula for Intermediate 2 is C7H8F3NO.\n4.  **Product:** The hydrolysis of the lactam adds one molecule of water (+H2O). The formula for the final product is C7H10F3NO2.\n\nThe final product is 3-amino-5-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
