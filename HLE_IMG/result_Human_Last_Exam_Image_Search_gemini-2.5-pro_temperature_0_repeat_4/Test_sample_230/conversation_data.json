    "The title of the 19th-century painting from which the fragment is presented is **\"A Windmill and Houses beside Water: Stormy Sky\"**.\n\nThe artwork was painted by the Dutch artist **Jacob Maris**, likely between 1880 and 1890. Maris was a prominent figure in the Hague School of painters.\n\nThis painting is a characteristic example of Maris's later work, known for its loose, sketchy style and use of thick impasto paint to create texture. The dramatic, stormy sky is a dominant feature of the composition, so much so that the painting was previously titled \"La Tourmente,\" which translates to 'Turmoil' or 'Turbulence'. The scene depicts a quintessential Dutch landscape with a windmill as the central focus, set against a backdrop of what appears to be a fire in the distance under the dark, cloudy sky.\n\n<<<A Windmill and Houses beside Water: Stormy Sky>>>"
