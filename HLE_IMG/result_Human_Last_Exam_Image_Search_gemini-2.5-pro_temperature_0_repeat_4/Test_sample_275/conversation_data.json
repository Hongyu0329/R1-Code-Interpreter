    "Based on the provided RT-PCR results, we can identify the different splice species by analyzing the bands produced in each experiment. The most informative experiment for determining the total number of splice species is Panel I, which uses the primer pair E1F1/L1R with a high number of cycles (30 cycles) to detect even low-abundance transcripts.\n\n**Identification of Splice Species:**\n\n*   **Panel I (E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles):** This panel clearly shows four distinct bands, which indicates the presence of at least four different splice species that span the region from the E1 gene to the L1 gene. The sizes of the PCR products for these four species are:\n    *   **Species 1:** 450 bp\n    *   **Species 2:** 419 bp\n    *   **Species 3:** 378 bp\n    *   **Species 4:** 187 bp\n\nThe results from the other panels provide additional information about the structure and relative abundance of these four species:\n\n*   **Panel H (E1F1/L1R, 20 cycles):** At fewer cycles, only the two most abundant species are visible, corresponding to the 450 bp and 419 bp products.\n*   **Panel G (E1F3/L2R, 30 cycles):** This reaction uses a primer (E1F3) specific for the 929^3506 splice junction. It produces two bands (1,003 bp and 931 bp), indicating that two of the four species contain this specific splice.\n*   **Panels D (E1F2/E5R) and F (E1F2/L2R):** These reactions use a primer (E1F2) specific for the 929^3465 splice junction. The single band in each panel (551 bp and 972 bp, respectively) confirms that at least one of the four species contains this splice.\n*   **Panel B (E1F1/E4R):** The two bands (190 bp and 159 bp) suggest that among the four total species, there are two different splicing patterns occurring in the region between the E1 and E4 genes.\n*   **Panel C (E1F1/E5R):** Similarly, the two bands here (584 bp and 553 bp) indicate two different splicing patterns exist in the E1 to E5 region across the four species.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy integrating the information from all panels, we can conclude that the experiments have detected a total of four distinct splice species. Panel I provides the most direct count, and the other panels help characterize the internal splice variations within this set of four transcripts.\n\nThe four splice species are those that produce PCR products of 450 bp, 419 bp, 378 bp, and 187 bp when amplified with the E1F1 and L1R primers.\n\n<<<4>>>"
