    "Based on the widely used G.V. Black classification system, the lesion shown in the image corresponds to a Class I caries.\n\nThis classification is determined by the location of the decay on the tooth. The image displays a posterior tooth (a molar) with a lesion in the pits and fissures of the occlusal (chewing) surface. According to G.V. Black's system, caries that affect the pits and fissures of posterior teeth are defined as Class I.\n\nThe presence of a filling indicates that this is recurrent or secondary caries, which is new decay occurring at the margin of an existing restoration. However, the classification itself is based on the anatomical location, which in this case remains Class I.\n\n<<<Class I>>>"
