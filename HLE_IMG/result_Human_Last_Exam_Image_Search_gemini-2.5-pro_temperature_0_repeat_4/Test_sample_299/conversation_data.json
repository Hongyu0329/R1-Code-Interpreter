    "Here is the solution for the two-move checkmate:\n\n**Move 1:** White moves the King from h4 to h3 (Kh3).\n\nThis quiet move puts Black in a state of *zugzwang*, where any move Black makes will lead to an unavoidable checkmate.\n\n**Move 2:** Regardless of Black's move, White's second move is Queen from a4 to d1 (Qd1#), resulting in checkmate.\n\nHere's the breakdown of Black's possible responses and why they all lead to the same outcome:\n\n*   **If Black moves the King to d4 (1... Kd4):** White plays 2. Qd1#. The Black King is trapped. The escape squares are all covered:\n    *   c3 and c4 are covered by the pawn on b4.\n    *   c5 is covered by the Knight on b7.\n    *   e3 and f3 are covered by the Rook on f3.\n    *   f5 is covered by the Rook on h5 and the Knight on e7.\n*   **If Black moves the King to d3 (1... Kd3):** White plays 2. Qd1#. The Black King is again trapped:\n    *   c2 and e2 are covered by the Bishop on g2.\n    *   c3 and c4 are covered by the pawn on b4.\n    *   e3 is covered by the Rook on f3.\n    *   e4 is covered by the Queen on d1.\n*   **If Black makes any other move (e.g., 1... Rc1):** The King remains on e4, and White plays 2. Qd1#. The King's escape squares are covered by the Queen on d1 (d3, d4), the Rook on f3 (f3), the Rook on h5 (f5), and the Knight on e7 and Black's own Queen control d5.\n\n<<<1. Kh3, 2. Qd1#>>>"
