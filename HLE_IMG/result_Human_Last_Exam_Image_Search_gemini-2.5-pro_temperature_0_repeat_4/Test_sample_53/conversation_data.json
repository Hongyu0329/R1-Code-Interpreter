    "The figure leaving the chariot is the sorceress Medea.\n\nThis scene is depicted on an Apulian red-figure calyx-krater, a type of mixing vessel, dating to around 370 BCE. The artwork illustrates the dramatic conclusion of Euripides' famous tragedy, *Medea*.\n\nIn the play, Medea seeks revenge on her husband, Jason, who has abandoned her for another woman. Her vengeance culminates in the murder of their two children. The vase painting captures the moment immediately after this horrific act. Medea is shown escaping in a chariot drawn by winged serpents, a gift from her grandfather, the sun god Helios. The large, luminous halo surrounding her head signifies her divine ancestry and the supernatural power she wields.\n\nBelow the ascending chariot, the bodies of her slain children are visible on an altar. Figures on the ground, including a distraught Jason, look on in horror."
