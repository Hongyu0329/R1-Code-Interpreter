    "The cuneiform sign shown in the image is íÇç (√â).\n\nThis sign represents the Sumerian word for \"house\" or \"temple\". Its form is pictographic, depicting a building with a roof. The use of this sign to mean house or temple is attested in the third millennium BCE. For instance, a wall plaque from Ur, dated to 2500 BCE, shows the evolution of this sign. The term √â.GAL (íÇçíÉ≤), literally \"big house,\" was used to denote a city's palace.\n\nTherefore, the correct meaning of the sign is \"Home\".\n\n<<<D>>>"
