    "The knot in the picture is the 8₁₉ knot in the Rolfsen table. The Rasmussen s-invariant for this knot is -6.\n\nThe 8₁₉ knot is also known as the T(4,3) torus knot and the pretzel knot P(3,3,-2). It is notable for being the first non-homologically thin knot in the Rolfsen table. The Rasmussen invariant is a knot invariant derived from Khovanov homology that provides a lower bound for the smooth 4-genus of a knot. For alternating knots, the Rasmussen s-invariant is equal to the knot signature. The signature of the 8₁₉ knot is indeed -6.\n\n<<<−6>>>"
