    "The image displays a large, ornate scientific instrument from the 18th century. Based on its features—a large wheel with handles for turning, a prominent brass conductor, and a spherical terminal—it is an electrostatic generator.\n\nThis specific apparatus is the famous large electrostatic generator designed by Martinus van Marum in 1784. It was built by John Cuthbertson in Amsterdam and is now the centerpiece of the instrument room at the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, Netherlands. The machine features two large glass disks, 1.65 meters in diameter, which were rotated by two men to generate static electricity through friction. It was capable of producing sparks up to 61 centimeters long, which corresponds to a voltage of about 330,000 volts. Van Marum used this powerful instrument for a variety of experiments, investigating the effects of electricity on different materials, plants, and animals.\n\n<<<B>>>"
