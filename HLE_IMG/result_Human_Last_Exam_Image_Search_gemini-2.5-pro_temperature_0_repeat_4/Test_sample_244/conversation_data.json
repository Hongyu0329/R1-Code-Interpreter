    "The epiphytic species in the image is a type of liverwort. Based on its dark, flattened (thalloid), and forked branching growth pattern that presses closely against the tree bark, it belongs to the genus ***Metzgeria***.\n\nThis appearance is characteristic of the Forked Veilwort, *Metzgeria furcata*, a common thallose liverwort found on the bark of various trees. This species forms yellowish-green to dull green mats, and its thalli (the flattened plant body) are about 1 mm wide with a distinct midrib and forked tips. While there are other similar species, the overall morphology in the photograph strongly points to *Metzgeria*.\n\nAnother possibility could be a leafy liverwort from the genus *Frullania*, which also grows as dark patches on tree bark. However, *Frullania* species are leafy, not thalloid, a distinction that requires close examination. The organism in the image displays a distinctly flattened and ribbon-like (thalloid) structure with dichotomous branching, which is more consistent with *Metzgeria*.\n\n<<<Metzgeria>>>"
