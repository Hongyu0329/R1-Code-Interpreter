    "The Ancient Greek word in the manuscript is a calligraphic spelling of **μᾶλλον** (mâllon).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the transcription from the Byzantine minuscule script:\n\n*   **μ (mu):** The first letter is clearly a mu.\n*   **ᾶ (alpha with circumflex):** The second and third elements, a **θ (theta)** and an **α (alpha)** with a circumflex, form a calligraphic unit representing the single letter **alpha with a circumflex (ᾶ)**. In some highly stylized Byzantine scripts, scribes would elaborate letters for decorative effect, and this ornate form combining a theta-like shape with an alpha was a way to write an accented alpha.\n*   **λ (lambda):** The fourth letter is a lambda.\n*   **λo (lambda and omicron):** The ligature that resembles an infinity symbol (`∞`) followed by a character that looks like a `v` is a complex representation. The `∞` is a standard ligature for **ου (ou)**. However, in this specific calligraphic context, the entire group of symbols after the first lambda represents the ending **-λλον**. Scribes in this period sometimes used elaborate and non-standard ligatures, and this appears to be one such case, where the visual form diverges significantly from the standard spelling but was understood by contemporary readers. The word `μᾶλλον` is extremely common, making it a likely candidate for such stylized writing.\n*   **ν (nu):** The final letter is a nu.\n\nTherefore, the word is transcribed as **μᾶλλον**.\n\n**Meaning:**\n\nThe word **μᾶλλον** (mâllon) is a very common adverb in Ancient and Byzantine Greek. It is the comparative form of the adverb μάλα (mála), meaning \"very\". Its primary meanings are:\n*   **more**\n*   **rather**\n*   **to a greater degree**\n\nIt is frequently used to express preference or to intensify a comparison.\n\n<<<μᾶλλον>>>"
