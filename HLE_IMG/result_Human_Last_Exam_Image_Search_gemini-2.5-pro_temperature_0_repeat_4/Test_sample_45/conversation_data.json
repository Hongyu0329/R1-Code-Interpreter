    "The tiling in the image has a **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\nThis specific pattern is a well-known semi-regular tiling called the **rhombitrihexagonal tiling**. An analysis of its geometric structure reveals multiple centers of rotation:\n\n*   **6-fold symmetry:** The center of each dark blue hexagon is a point of 6-fold rotational symmetry. Rotating the entire pattern by 60 degrees (360Â°/6) around these points leaves the tiling unchanged.\n*   **4-fold symmetry:** The center of each light orange square is a point of 4-fold rotational symmetry. A 90-degree rotation around these points also leaves the tiling unchanged.\n*   **2-fold symmetry:** The vertices where two hexagons and two rhombuses meet are centers of 2-fold rotational symmetry (a 180-degree rotation).\n\nWhen a tiling possesses multiple types of rotational symmetry, its overall symmetry is defined by the highest order of rotation present. In this case, the highest order is 6. This is confirmed by its classification in the wallpaper group system as **p6m**, where the \"6\" explicitly denotes the 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
