    "Based on the analysis of the provided graph, the synchronized bursts of neuronal firing activity are identified at the following approximate timestamps:\n\n*   **Burst 1:** 2 s\n*   **Burst 2:** 16 s\n*   **Burst 3:** 27 s\n*   **Burst 4:** 37 s\n*   **Burst 5:** 49 s\n\nThe inter-burst intervals (the time between consecutive bursts) are calculated as follows:\n\n*   **Interval 1:** 16 s - 2 s = 14 s\n*   **Interval 2:** 27 s - 16 s = 11 s\n*   **Interval 3:** 37 s - 27 s = 10 s\n*   **Interval 4:** 49 s - 37 s = 12 s\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is the sum of these intervals divided by the number of intervals:\n\nAverage Inter-Burst Interval = (14 + 11 + 10 + 12) / 4 = 47 / 4 = 11.75 s\n\nRounding the result to two significant figures gives 12 s.\n\n<<<12>>>"
