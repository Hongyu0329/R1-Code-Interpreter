    "The primary difference in the sporophyte that allows for distinguishing *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the orientation of the seta, the stalk that supports the capsule.\n\nIn *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight, holding the capsule in an erect position. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by an arcuate, or curved, seta. This curvature gives the capsule a bent or nodding appearance. This distinct difference in the seta is a key diagnostic feature for separating the two species when sporophytes are present.\n\n<<<The main distinguishing feature is the seta: it is straight in *Grimmia montana* and curved (arcuate) in *Grimmia curviseta*.>>>"
