    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork:\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Evidence:** The image shows a bas-relief (a sculpture where the figures project slightly from the background) set within a decorative circular frame, which is itself part of a larger, more ornate structure, likely an altarpiece or tabernacle. The medium appears to be stone or, more likely given the style, glazed terracotta. The image is in black and white, but the fine details of the carving are clear.\n\n2.  **Identify the Subject Matter:** The central scene depicts a Christian sacrament. A priest, standing at an altar with a candle, is administering communion to a group of five kneeling figures (a child, two monks, and two women). This is the Sacrament of the Eucharist.\n\n3.  **Examine the Inscription:** At the bottom of the circular relief, there is a scroll or cartouche with an inscription. Although slightly obscured, the words \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\" can be discerned. This is an archaic form of French/Italian for \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" which directly confirms the subject as the Eucharist.\n\n4.  **Determine the Artistic Style and Period:** The style is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance, specifically the Florentine school of the 15th century (Quattrocento). The figures are rendered with naturalism, grace, and a sense of calm piety. The composition is clear and balanced. This particular combination of serene expression, classical drapery, and the use of a circular relief (a *tondo*) within a larger architectural frame points towards a specific group of artists.\n\n5.  **Connect Style to a Specific Artist:** The graceful style and the likely medium of glazed terracotta are hallmarks of the work of **Luca della Robbia** (c. 1399/1400â€“1482) and his family workshop in Florence. He was a master sculptor renowned for popularizing this medium for architectural decoration.\n\n6.  **Identify the Specific Artwork:** A search based on the artist, subject, and inscription (\"Luca della Robbia,\" \"Eucharist,\" \"Sacrament of the Altar\") confirms the identity of the piece. This roundel is a detail from the predella (the base platform) of the *Tabernacle of the Holy Sacrament*. Luca della Robbia created this masterpiece between 1441 and 1443 for the chapel of the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence. It is now located in the church of Santa Maria a Peretola, Florence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the distinct artistic style, the specific subject matter confirmed by the inscription, and art historical records, the author of this relief is unequivocally identified.\n\n<<<Luca della Robbia>>>"
