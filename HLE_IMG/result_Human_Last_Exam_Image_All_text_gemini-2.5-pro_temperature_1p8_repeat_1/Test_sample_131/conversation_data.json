    "This is a step-by-step analysis to identify the name of the given alkaloid compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the overall structure and functional groups.**\n1.  **Heterocyclic Nature:** The molecule is a polycyclic compound containing two nitrogen atoms incorporated into the ring system. This is a characteristic feature of an alkaloid.\n2.  **Ring System:** The structure consists of four fused six-membered rings, making it a tetracyclic compound.\n3.  **Functional Groups:** There is a carbonyl group (C=O) present. This carbonyl group is adjacent to a nitrogen atom within one of the six-membered rings. An amide group within a cyclic structure is called a lactam. Since the ring is six-membered, this is specifically a Î´-lactam. The two nitrogen atoms are tertiary, although one is an amide nitrogen.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the core skeleton.**\n1.  The fundamental skeleton is based on a quinolizidine framework. A quinolizidine system is a bicyclic structure with two fused six-membered rings sharing a nitrogen atom at a bridgehead position.\n2.  The given molecule can be viewed as being composed of two such quinolizidine-like units fused together. This specific tetracyclic skeleton is characteristic of the lupin alkaloids.\n\n**Step 3: Compare with known alkaloids.**\n1.  The combination of a tetracyclic system and a lactam functional group strongly points towards a specific class of quinolizidine alkaloids.\n2.  **Sparteine:** Sparteine has the same tetracyclic ring system but lacks the carbonyl (C=O) group; it's the corresponding fully reduced amine. Therefore, the compound is not sparteine.\n3.  **Cytisine:** Cytisine contains an unsaturated, aromatic-like pyridone ring. The given compound's rings are all saturated (alicyclic), except for the carbonyl carbon. So, it's not cytisine.\n4.  **Matrine:** Matrine is another tetracyclic lactam alkaloid, but its rings are fused in a different manner.\n5.  **Lupanine:** The depicted structure, with its specific four-ring fusion pattern and the location of the lactam, perfectly matches the structure of the alkaloid known as lupanine.\n\n**Step 4: Consider the stereochemistry.**\n1.  The wedges and dashes indicate a specific three-dimensional arrangement of the atoms (stereochemistry).\n2.  The stereochemistry shown in the diagram corresponds to the most common naturally occurring isomer of this alkaloid, which is formally (-)-lupanine.\n3.  In common usage, this specific isomer is simply referred to by the name \"lupanine\".\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis of the tetracyclic lactam structure, which is characteristic of the quinolizidine alkaloid family found in lupin plants, the compound is identified as Lupanine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
