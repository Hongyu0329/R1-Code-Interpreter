    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Instrumentation and Language.**\n    The sheet music lists instruments in German: \"2 gr. Fl.\" (2 Grosse Flöten / 2 Flutes), \"I. Hob.\" (Erste Oboe / 1st Oboe), \"engl. Horn\" (English Horn), \"I. Fag.\" (Erstes Fagott / 1st Bassoon), and strings (\"Viol.\", \"Br.\", \"Celli\"). The instructions are also in German, such as \"(die übrigen)\" meaning \"(the rest)\", \"(mit Dämpfer)\" meaning \"(with mute)\", and most importantly, **\"(Vorhang)\"**, which means **\"(Curtain)\"**. This confirms the piece is from a German or Austrian opera or play, and the marking \"(Vorhang)\" indicates the point where the curtain rises.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Musical Style.**\n    The harmony is extremely chromatic and dissonant, far removed from traditional tonality. The key signature is complex, and accidentals are abundant throughout the score. The texture is dense with divided string sections (\"1. Pult\", \"2. Pult\", etc.). The dynamics range from very soft (*pp*) to loud (*mf*) with sudden changes. There are expressive markings like *diminuendo* and *glissando*. This combination of a large orchestra, extreme chromaticism, and dramatic contrasts is characteristic of early 20th-century German expressionism. Composers like Richard Strauss and Arnold Schoenberg are prime candidates.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify Key Musical Features.**\n    A prominent feature is the **Solo Viola (\"Solo Br.\")** part, which has a distinct, agitated melodic line at the beginning. The moment the curtain rises (\"Vorhang\") is marked by a sudden tutti outburst at a *mezzo-forte* dynamic, followed by dramatic upward glissandi in the strings. This creates a shocking, theatrical effect.\n\n*   **Step 4: Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Opera.**\n    We are looking for a German opera from the early 20th century that opens its second major section (as specified in the prompt) with a dark, quiet, agitated introduction featuring a solo viola, followed by a violent orchestral crash as the curtain rises. These specific features are famously associated with the entrance of Klytämnestra in Richard Strauss's one-act opera, **Elektra** (1909). This passage is the orchestral introduction to the Klytämnestra scene, which functions as the second major part of the opera. The music perfectly depicts her nightmarish, anxiety-ridden state before she appears on stage. A direct comparison with the score of *Elektra* confirms this is the correct piece.\n\n<<<Elektra>>>"
