    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the medallion to determine its historical period:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the object and its form.**\nThe image displays a round medallion with a tab at the top, which suggests it was designed to be worn as a pendant or displayed. The medium appears to be worked metal, likely gold, given the common material for such prestigious items in antiquity. The image on the medallion is a relief sculpture showing two busts.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the iconography of the figures.**\n*   **Figure on the Left:** This is a male figure with a beard. Most importantly, he has large, curved ram's horns. This is the definitive attribute of the god Jupiter-Ammon (a fusion of the Roman Jupiter and the Egyptian god Amun). Roman emperors, especially those with connections to North Africa or wishing to emphasize their divine authority, were sometimes depicted with these horns.\n*   **Figure on the Right:** This figure is identified as a woman due to her facial features and, most notably, her elaborate hairstyle. The hair is styled in a complex, helmet-like fashion, with structured waves parted in the center and covering the ears. This specific and highly recognizable hairstyle is known as the *Scheitelfrisur* and is almost exclusively associated with one Roman empress: Julia Domna.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the historical figures and period.**\nThe combination of a Roman emperor depicted as Jupiter-Ammon alongside an empress with the distinctive hairstyle of Julia Domna points to a specific imperial couple:\n*   **Emperor Septimius Severus:** He was of North African origin (from Leptis Magna in modern-day Libya) and actively promoted the cult of Jupiter-Ammon, frequently appearing with the god's ram's horns in his portraiture.\n*   **Empress Julia Domna:** She was the wife of Septimius Severus and is famous in Roman art for her elaborate wig-like hairstyles.\nThe depiction is a classic example of imperial propaganda from the Severan dynasty.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the century.**\nSeptimius Severus reigned as Roman Emperor from 193 A.D. to 211 A.D. Julia Domna was his empress during this entire period. Any artifact depicting them together in this manner would have been produced during their reign. Since the majority of their rule (from 201 A.D. to 211 A.D.) and the associated artistic style fall within the 3rd century A.D., archaeologists firmly place medallions of this type in that period. This specific style is characteristic of early 3rd-century Roman imperial art.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the answer.**\nBased on the identification of the figures as Emperor Septimius Severus and Empress Julia Domna, the medallion dates to their reign (193-211 A.D.). Therefore, it is ascribed to the 3rd century A.D.\n\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
