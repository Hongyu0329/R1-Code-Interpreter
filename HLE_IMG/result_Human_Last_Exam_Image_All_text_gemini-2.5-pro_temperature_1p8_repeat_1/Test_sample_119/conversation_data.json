    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation from Mass Spectrometry**\n*   The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 135.\n*   According to the **Nitrogen Rule**, a molecule with an odd molecular weight contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We assume one nitrogen atom (N, atomic weight ~14).\n*   The ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectra (analyzed below) suggest the presence of a benzene ring (C₆H₅, mass = 77).\n*   The remaining mass is 135 - 77 (for C₆H₅) - 14 (for N) = 44. This mass corresponds to a C₃H₈ fragment (3 * 12 + 8 * 1 = 44).\n*   This gives a tentative molecular formula of C₉H₁₃N.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for C₉H₁₃N is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 4. A DoU of 4 is consistent with a single benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Functional Group Identification from IR Spectroscopy**\n*   The two sharp peaks around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   The peaks just above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C(sp²)-H bonds (aromatic).\n*   The peaks just below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C(sp³)-H bonds (aliphatic).\n*   The absorptions in the 1450-1600 cm⁻¹ range are consistent with C=C stretching in an aromatic ring.\n*   The IR spectrum confirms the molecule contains a primary amine, an aromatic ring, and aliphatic groups.\n\n**Step 3: Carbon Skeleton Analysis from ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135**\n*   **¹³C NMR (δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2):** There are 7 distinct carbon signals, indicating 7 unique carbon environments. Since the formula is C₉H₁₃N, some carbons must be chemically equivalent.\n*   Four signals (145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm) are in the aromatic region, consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring (1 ipso, 1 para, and two sets of equivalent ortho and meta carbons).\n*   Three signals (49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm) are in the aliphatic region, consistent with the C₃ side chain.\n*   **DEPT-135 (one negative, five positive signals):**\n    *   Quaternary carbons are absent in DEPT-135. The signal at 145.1 ppm is the ipso-carbon (quaternary).\n    *   The one negative signal indicates one CH₂ group.\n    *   The five positive signals indicate five CH or CH₃ groups. Three of these are the aromatic CH carbons. Therefore, the aliphatic side chain contains one CH and one CH₃ group.\n    *   So, the C₃ side chain consists of one CH, one CH₂, and one CH₃ group.\n\n**Step 4: Proton Environment and Connectivity from ¹H NMR**\n*   A multiplet at δ ~7.2-7.3 ppm integrating to 5 protons (5.00) confirms a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   A doublet at δ ~1.2 ppm integrating to 3 protons (3.24) is a CH₃ group coupled to a single proton.\n*   A multiplet at δ ~2.7 ppm integrating to 1 proton (0.97) is a CH group. The coupling to the CH₃ group is consistent.\n*   A multiplet at δ ~2.8 ppm integrating to 2 protons (1.96) is a CH₂ group.\n*   The N-H protons of the primary amine are not clearly resolved but are accounted for by the formula and IR data.\n\n**Step 5: Structure Elucidation using HSQC**\n*   The HSQC spectrum correlates each proton signal to its directly attached carbon.\n    *   ¹H δ~1.2 ppm (CH₃) correlates with ¹³C δ=19.2 ppm.\n    *   ¹H δ~2.7 ppm (CH) correlates with ¹³C δ=49.6 ppm.\n    *   ¹H δ~2.8 ppm (CH₂) correlates with ¹³C δ=43.5 ppm.\n*   Now we assemble the fragments: C₆H₅-, -NH₂, -CH-, -CH₂-, -CH₃.\n*   Two main isomers are possible:\n    1.  **1-phenylpropan-2-amine:** C₆H₅–CH₂–CH(NH₂)–CH₃\n    2.  **2-phenylpropan-1-amine:** C₆H₅–CH(CH₃)–CH₂–NH₂\n*   Let's check the carbon shifts against our data:\n    *   In **Isomer 1**, the benzylic carbon is a CH₂ (δ¹³C≈40-45 ppm) and the carbon bearing the amine is a CH (δ¹³C≈50-55 ppm). This matches our HSQC data: CH₂ is at 43.5 ppm and CH is at 49.6 ppm.\n    *   In **Isomer 2**, the benzylic carbon is a CH (δ¹³C≈45 ppm) and the carbon bearing the amine is a CH₂ (δ¹³C≈45-50 ppm). This assignment is inconsistent with our data, where the CH is significantly more downfield than the CH₂.\n*   The spectroscopic data unambiguously supports the structure of **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n**Step 6: IUPAC Name**\n*   The principal functional group is the amine (-NH₂).\n*   The longest carbon chain containing the amine group is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n*   Number the chain to give the amine group the lowest possible number. This places the amine at carbon 2 (propan-2-amine).\n*   A phenyl group is attached to carbon 1.\n*   Combining these parts gives the IUPAC name.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe IUPAC name of the compound is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
