    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to identify the song:\n\n1.  **Initial Observation:** The music is for solo piano, as indicated by the grand staff (treble and bass clefs joined together).\n\n2.  **Analysis of the First Section (Measures 1-2):**\n    *   **Time Signature:** 4/4 (common time).\n    *   **Key Signature:** No sharps or flats, suggesting C major or A minor.\n    *   **Tempo:** ♩ = 80, a moderate walking pace (Andante).\n    *   **Dynamics:** *p* (piano), meaning soft.\n    *   **Melody:** The right hand plays a simple and recognizable tune: E-F-G-A | G-F-E-D. This melodic fragment is famously the beginning of the chorus of the song \"Bad Apple!!\" from the Touhou Project video game series.\n    *   **Harmony:** The left hand plays simple chords, starting with a C major chord, creating a calm and unassuming atmosphere.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Second Section (Measure 3 onwards):**\n    *   **Sudden Change:** There is an abrupt and dramatic shift in character at measure 3.\n    *   **Dynamics:** The dynamic marking changes to *f* (forte), meaning loud. In measure 4 it's *mp* (mezzo-piano) and in measure 8 it's *mf* (mezzo-forte), indicating frequent dynamic shifts.\n    *   **Rhythm and Texture:** The rhythm becomes a continuous, rapid-fire stream of sixteenth notes in both hands. This creates a dense, virtuosic, and high-energy texture, characteristic of a toccata or a piece from the electronic \"speedcore\" or \"happy hardcore\" genres transcribed for piano.\n    *   **Harmony:** The harmony becomes intensely chromatic and complex. For example, measure 3 is built on a C-sharp diminished seventh chord, a dissonant and unstable sound that drives the music forward. This style is far removed from the simple C major of the opening.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Clues:**\n    *   The piece begins with a well-known, slow melody from \"Bad Apple!!\".\n    *   It then \"surprises\" the listener by launching into an extremely fast and difficult section with a completely different character.\n    *   This combination of a \"Bad Apple!!\" musical quote as a \"troll\" or \"fake-out\" intro followed by an intensely difficult main section is a famous feature of a specific beatmap in the rhythm game *osu!*.\n    *   The beatmap is for the song **\"FREEDOM DiVE↓\"** composed by the artist **xi**. The specific difficulty level known for this intro is \"[FOUR DIMENSIONS]\".\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The sheet music is a transcription of the song \"FREEDOM DiVE↓\" by xi, specifically arranged to include the \"Bad Apple!!\" fake-out intro from the famous *osu!* beatmap.\n\n<<<xi - FREEDOM DiVE↓>>>"
