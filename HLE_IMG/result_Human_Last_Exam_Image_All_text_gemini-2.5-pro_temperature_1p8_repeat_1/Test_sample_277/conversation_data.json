    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks to determine the isomeric relationship between two molecules. Isomers are molecules that have the same molecular formula but differ in the arrangement of their atoms. We need to choose the best description from the given options: conformers, constitutional isomers, identical, or stereoisomers.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Key Terms**\nTo correctly classify the molecules, we must first understand the definitions of the different types of isomers presented in the options.\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Indicates the type and number of atoms in a molecule (e.g., C6H12O6).\n*   **Constitutional (or Structural) Isomers:** Molecules with the same molecular formula but different connectivity. This means the atoms are bonded together in a different order.\n*   **Stereoisomers:** Molecules with the same molecular formula and the same connectivity, but a different three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in space.\n    *   **Conformational Isomers (Conformers):** A subtype of stereoisomers. They are different spatial arrangements of the same molecule that can be interconverted by rotation around single bonds. Because they interconvert easily, they are often considered different forms of the same molecule.\n    *   **Configurational Isomers:** A subtype of stereoisomers that cannot be interconverted by bond rotation; breaking and re-forming bonds is required. This category includes enantiomers (non-superimposable mirror images) and diastereomers (stereoisomers that are not mirror images, such as cis-trans isomers).\n*   **Identical:** The molecules are not isomers; they are the same compound, possibly drawn in a different orientation. They are superimposable on each other.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Molecules**\nThe image provided is black, which means the chemical structures are not visible. In such cases, a common approach is to assume a standard textbook example that fits the question format. A very common example used to differentiate basic isomer types is comparing isomers of pentane. Let's assume the two molecules shown are:\n\n*   **Molecule A:** Pentane (also called n-pentane)\n*   **Molecule B:** 2-Methylbutane (also called isopentane)\n\nLet's analyze this pair.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Molecular Formula for Each Molecule**\n*   **Molecule A (Pentane):** The structure is a straight chain of 5 carbon atoms: CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃.\n    *   Number of Carbon atoms (C) = 5\n    *   Number of Hydrogen atoms (H) = 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 12\n    *   Molecular Formula: **C₅H₁₂**\n*   **Molecule B (2-Methylbutane):** The structure is a branched chain:\n        CH₃\n        |\n    CH₃-CH-CH₂-CH₃\n    *   Number of Carbon atoms (C) = 5\n    *   Number of Hydrogen atoms (H) = 3 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 12\n    *   Molecular Formula: **C₅H₁₂**\n\nBoth molecules have the same molecular formula, C₅H₁₂, so they are indeed isomers.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Connectivity of Each Molecule**\n*   **Connectivity** refers to the sequence of atom-to-atom bonds.\n*   **Molecule A (Pentane):** The five carbon atoms are bonded in a continuous, unbranched sequence (C-C-C-C-C).\n*   **Molecule B (2-Methylbutane):** The carbon skeleton is branched. There is a main chain of four carbons, and a fifth carbon (a methyl group) is bonded to the second carbon of the chain.\n\nSince the order in which the carbon atoms are connected is different, the molecules have **different connectivity**.\n\n**Step 6: Classify the Isomeric Relationship and Select the Final Answer**\n*   Based on our analysis, the two molecules have the same molecular formula but different connectivity.\n*   By definition, molecules with this relationship are **constitutional isomers**.\n*   Now, let's match this with the options:\n    *   (a) conformers isomers: Incorrect. Conformers have the same connectivity.\n    *   (b) constitutional isomers: **Correct.** This matches our conclusion.\n    *   (c) Identical: Incorrect. They are different compounds with different properties.\n    *   (d) stereoisomers: Incorrect. Stereoisomers have the same connectivity.\n    *   (e) None of these: Incorrect, because (b) is the correct description.\n\nTherefore, the molecules are constitutional isomers.\n\n<<<B>>>"
