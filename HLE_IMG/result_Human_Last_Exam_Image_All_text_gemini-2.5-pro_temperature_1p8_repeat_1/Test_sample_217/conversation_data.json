    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the image:** The provided image is a line drawing of an early cuneiform sign. The form is highly pictographic, meaning it visually resembles the object it represents. The sign consists of a rectangular base with vertical and nested lines inside, topped by a triangular shape resembling a roof. The overall structure strongly suggests a building or a dwelling.\n\n2.  **Consider the historical context:** The question specifies the \"third-millennium form\" of the sign. This period (3000-2001 BCE) includes the Early Dynastic and Ur III periods of Mesopotamian history. During this era, cuneiform script was evolving from its purely pictographic origins into a more abstract system of wedges. The sign shown is a characteristic example of an archaic, pictographic form from this time.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the options against the visual evidence:**\n    *   **A. Tool:** Signs for tools usually depicted the specific tool (e.g., a pickaxe, a plow). This image does not look like a typical tool.\n    *   **B. Guard:** This is an abstract concept. While a guard might be at a building, the sign itself is a building, not a person guarding it. The sign for a soldier/guard (ERINâ‚‚) looks different.\n    *   **C. Bread:** The sign for bread (NINDA) was a pictograph of a round or oval loaf, which is visually distinct from the sign in the image.\n    *   **D. Home:** This option fits the pictograph perfectly. The image is a schematic drawing of a house, hut, or shelter. In Sumerian, the sign for \"house\" or \"temple\" is *Ã©*. This image is the known archaic form of the sign *Ã©*.\n    *   **E. Deity:** The sign for a deity (DINGIR) was a star-like symbol (ð’€­). This is completely different from the image.\n    *   **F. Beard:** The sign for a beard (SU) was typically drawn on a pictograph of a human head and does not resemble this structure.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The pictograph clearly represents a building. In the Sumerian cuneiform script of the third millennium BCE, this specific sign (*Ã©*) stood for \"house,\" \"household,\" or \"temple.\" Therefore, \"Home\" is the correct meaning.\n\n<<<D>>>"
