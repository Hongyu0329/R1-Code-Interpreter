    "This analysis aims to calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by comparing the Baseline scenario (Table 1) with the Proposed scenario (Table 2).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to quantify the change in total miles traveled by cars (VMT) as a percentage reduction from the baseline to the proposed scenario.\n\n**2. List Careful Points**\n*   **VMT vs. PMT:** The question specifically asks for Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), not Person Miles Traveled (PMT). This means the average carpool occupancy figures (2.8 and 3) are not needed for this calculation, as they relate to PMT. We are concerned with the miles each vehicle travels, not how many people are in it.\n*   **Data Aggregation:** We need to calculate the total VMT for all car trips. The tables provide two categories of car trips: \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\". The mode shares for these two categories must be summed up to get the total car mode share for each distance bracket.\n*   **Weighted Calculation:** The total VMT is not a simple average. It's a weighted sum based on the \"share of total trips\" for each distance category. Trips in categories with a higher share of the total contribute more to the overall VMT.\n*   **Formula:** The core calculation for the VMT contribution of each distance category is:\n    *VMT Contribution = (Share of Total Trips) × (Average Trip Distance) × (Total Car Mode Share for that category)*\n\n**3. Calculate Total Car VMT for the Baseline Scenario (Table 1)**\nWe will compute the VMT for each distance category and then sum them.\n\n*   **Category 1: 0-3 miles**\n    *   Share of Total Trips = 48% (0.48)\n    *   Average Trip Distance = 1 mile\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 25% + 28% = 53% (0.53)\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.48 × 1 × 0.53 = 0.2544\n\n*   **Category 2: 3-5 miles**\n    *   Share of Total Trips = 22% (0.22)\n    *   Average Trip Distance = 4 miles\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 38% + 43% = 81% (0.81)\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.22 × 4 × 0.81 = 0.7128\n\n*   **Category 3: 5-10 miles**\n    *   Share of Total Trips = 14% (0.14)\n    *   Average Trip Distance = 7.5 miles\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 40% + 45% = 85% (0.85)\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.14 × 7.5 × 0.85 = 0.8925\n\n*   **Category 4: 10+ miles**\n    *   Share of Total Trips = 16% (0.16)\n    *   Average Trip Distance = 20 miles\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 42% + 47% = 89% (0.89)\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.16 × 20 × 0.89 = 2.8480\n\n*   **Total Baseline Car VMT:**\n    *   `Baseline VMT = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = 4.7077` (This represents a weighted average VMT contributed by cars per trip in the system).\n\n**4. Calculate Total Car VMT for the Proposed Scenario (Table 2)**\nNext, we repeat the same calculation using the figures from Table 2.\n\n*   **Category 1: 0-3 miles**\n    *   Share of Total Trips = 48% (0.48)\n    *   Average Trip Distance = 1 mile\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 1% + 2% = 3% (0.03)\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.48 × 1 × 0.03 = 0.0144\n\n*   **Category 2: 3-5 miles**\n    *   Share of Total Trips = 22% (0.22)\n    *   Average Trip Distance = 4 miles\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 8% + 19% = 27% (0.27)\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.22 × 4 × 0.27 = 0.2376\n\n*   **Category 3: 5-10 miles**\n    *   Share of Total Trips = 14% (0.14)\n    *   Average Trip Distance = 7.5 miles\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 14% + 27% = 41% (0.41)\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.14 × 7.5 × 0.41 = 0.4305\n\n*   **Category 4: 10+ miles**\n    *   Share of Total Trips = 16% (0.16)\n    *   Average Trip Distance = 20 miles\n    *   Total Car Mode Share = 16% + 33% = 49% (0.49)\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.16 × 20 × 0.49 = 1.5680\n\n*   **Total Proposed Car VMT:**\n    *   `Proposed VMT = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = 2.2505`\n\n**5. Calculate the Final Percentage Reduction**\nFinally, we calculate the percentage reduction using the VMT totals for both scenarios.\n\n*   **VMT Reduction Amount** = Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction Amount / Baseline VMT) × 100\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100 ≈ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the percentage reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
