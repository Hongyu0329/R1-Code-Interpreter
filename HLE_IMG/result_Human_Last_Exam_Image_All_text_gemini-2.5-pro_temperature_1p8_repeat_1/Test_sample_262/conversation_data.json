    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks to identify which of the four iridium(III) complexes are expected to have shorter operational lifetimes when used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). A shorter lifetime implies lower chemical or electrochemical stability under operating conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Structures of the Four Complexes**\nAll four complexes are cationic iridium(III) complexes with a general formula `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+PF6-`.\n*   The metal center is Iridium(III).\n*   The `N^N` ligand is the same in all four complexes: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (`dtbbpy`). This ligand acts as an ancillary or spectator ligand. The bulky tert-butyl groups are known to enhance solubility and morphological stability. Since this ligand is common to all four complexes, it is not the primary factor distinguishing their lifetimes.\n*   The `C^N` ligands are cyclometalating 2-phenylpyridine (`ppy`) derivatives. This is where the four complexes differ. The phenyl ring of the `ppy` ligand is substituted with fluorine atoms.\n    *   **Complex 1:** Has two identical `C^N` ligands. Each ligand has **two fluorine atoms** on the phenyl ring. Let's denote this ligand as `F2ppy`.\n    *   **Complex 2:** Is heteroleptic with respect to the `C^N` ligands. It has one `F2ppy` ligand (with two fluorines) and one unsubstituted `ppy` ligand (with **no fluorine atoms**).\n    *   **Complex 3:** Has two identical `C^N` ligands. Each ligand has **one fluorine atom** on the phenyl ring. Let's denote this ligand as `Fppy`.\n    *   **Complex 4:** Is heteroleptic with respect to the `C^N` ligands. It has one `Fppy` ligand (with one fluorine) and one unsubstituted `ppy` ligand (with **no fluorine atoms**).\n\n**Step 3: Relate Molecular Structure to Emitter Lifetime**\nThe operational stability (and thus lifetime) of these iridium complexes in LECs and related devices like OLEDs is strongly influenced by the strength of the coordination bonds, particularly the cyclometalating Ir-C bond. This bond is often the \"weakest link\" and a primary site for degradation.\n*   Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom. When attached to the phenyl ring of the `ppy` ligand, it exerts a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect).\n*   This electron-withdrawing effect pulls electron density away from the phenyl ring, including the carbon atom bonded to the iridium center.\n*   This lowers the energy of the sigma orbital involved in the Ir-C bond, making the bond stronger and more stable.\n*   A stronger Ir-C bond is more resistant to cleavage under thermal, electrical, or photochemical stress during device operation. This leads to enhanced stability and a longer lifetime for the emitter.\n*   The more fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring, the stronger the electron-withdrawing effect, and the stronger the Ir-C bond.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Expected Stabilities of the Four Complexes**\nBased on the principle described in Step 3, we can rank the stability of the `C^N` ligands:\nStability: `ppy` (no F) < `Fppy` (one F) < `F2ppy` (two F).\n\nNow let's evaluate the complexes:\n*   **Complex 1 ([Ir(F2ppy)2(dtbbpy)]+):** Both `C^N` ligands are heavily fluorinated. This complex is expected to have the strongest Ir-C bonds among the four. Therefore, it should be the most stable and have the **longest lifetime**.\n*   **Complex 3 ([Ir(Fppy)2(dtbbpy)]+):** Both `C^N` ligands are fluorinated. This complex will be very stable, likely more stable than complexes containing non-fluorinated ligands. Its lifetime should be **long**, although perhaps slightly shorter than Complex 1 since `Fppy` is less stabilizing than `F2ppy`.\n*   **Complex 2 ([Ir(F2ppy)(ppy)(dtbbpy)]+):** This complex contains one highly stable `F2ppy` ligand and one unstable `ppy` ligand. The presence of the unsubstituted `ppy` ligand introduces a \"weak link\" into the complex â€“ the relatively weak Ir-C(ppy) bond. Degradation is likely to initiate at this site. Therefore, this complex is expected to have a **shorter lifetime** compared to Complexes 1 and 3.\n*   **Complex 4 ([Ir(Fppy)(ppy)(dtbbpy)]+):** Similar to Complex 2, this complex contains one unsubstituted `ppy` ligand alongside a more stable fluorinated ligand (`Fppy`). It also possesses the same \"weak link\" (the Ir-C(ppy) bond). Therefore, this complex is also expected to have a **shorter lifetime** compared to Complexes 1 and 3.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude and Select the Answer**\nThe question asks for the complexes with shorter lifetimes. Our analysis indicates that the presence of a non-fluorinated `ppy` ligand is detrimental to the operational stability. Complexes 2 and 4 are the only two that contain this less stable ligand. Therefore, they are expected to degrade faster and show shorter lifetimes.\n\nThe complexes expected to show shorter lifetimes are [2] and [4]. This corresponds to answer choice I.\n\n<<<I>>>"
