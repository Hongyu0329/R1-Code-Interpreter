The result should be interpreted as invalid or indeterminate. Although the fluorescence signal crosses the threshold (Ct = 30.8) before the assay cut-off of 40 cycles, the shape of the amplification curve is not a valid sigmoidal curve. It shows a linear drift rather than a true exponential amplification, which suggests the signal is an artifact and not a reliable positive result. The test should be repeated.
