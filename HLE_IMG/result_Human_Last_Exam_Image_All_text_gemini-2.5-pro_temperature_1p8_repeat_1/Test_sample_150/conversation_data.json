    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n    *   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl).\n    *   **Catalyst:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The AlCl₃ coordinates with the chlorine atom of the acyl chloride, facilitating the formation of an electrophilic acylium ion (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O). The benzene ring, acting as a nucleophile, attacks the acylium ion in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n    *   **Intermediate-1:** The product is propiophenone, which is 1-phenylpropan-1-one.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-1:** C₆H₅-C(=O)-CH₂CH₃\n\n2.  **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone).\n    *   **Reagents:** Br₂ and FeBr₃ (Lewis acid catalyst).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on the benzene ring of propiophenone. The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring towards electrophilic attack and acts as a *meta*-director. Therefore, the bromine atom will be added to the *meta* position relative to the propanoyl group.\n    *   **Intermediate-2:** The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-2:** 3-Br-C₆H₄-C(=O)-CH₂CH₃\n\n3.  **Step 3: Reduction (Catalytic Hydrogenation)**\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n    *   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd (hydrogen gas with a palladium catalyst).\n    *   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd is a powerful reduction method. In this molecule, there are two functional groups that can be reduced: the ketone group and the aryl bromide.\n        *   **Ketone reduction:** The benzylic ketone can be fully reduced to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a form of hydrogenolysis. (C=O -> CH₂)\n        *   **Aryl bromide reduction:** The carbon-bromine bond on the aromatic ring can also be cleaved by hydrogenolysis (C-Br -> C-H).\n    *   Under typical H₂/Pd conditions, both reductions are expected to occur, leading to the complete removal of both the oxygen atom from the carbonyl group and the bromine atom from the ring.\n    *   **Intermediate-3:** The product is propylbenzene.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-3:** C₆H₅-CH₂CH₂CH₃\n\n4.  **Step 4: Radical Bromination**\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (propylbenzene).\n    *   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide), CCl₄ (solvent).\n    *   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is used for free-radical bromination, which selectively occurs at the most stable radical position. Benzoyl peroxide acts as a radical initiator. NBS provides a low, steady concentration of bromine radicals (Br•).\n    *   **Selectivity:** In propylbenzene (C₆H₅-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃), the possible radical intermediates are:\n        *   Primary radical on the terminal carbon.\n        *   Secondary radical on the middle carbon of the propyl chain.\n        *   Benzylic radical on the carbon attached to the benzene ring.\n    *   The benzylic radical (C₆H₅-ĊH-CH₂CH₃) is by far the most stable because it is not only a secondary radical but is also stabilized by resonance with the adjacent phenyl ring.\n    *   **Final Product:** The reaction will proceed via the benzylic radical, leading to the formation of (1-bromopropyl)benzene. The IUPAC name for this compound is 1-bromo-1-phenylpropane.\n    *   **Structure of the Final Product:** C₆H₅-CH(Br)-CH₂CH₃\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe final product is 1-bromo-1-phenylpropane.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-phenylpropane>>>"
