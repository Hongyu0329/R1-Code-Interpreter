    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the overall transformation.**\n    The reaction starts with two molecules: hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆), an aromatic compound, and cyclobutene (C₄H₄), a cyclic alkene. The reaction is driven by light (hv), which indicates it is a photochemical process. The product is a single, complex polycyclic molecule (C₁₀H₄F₆), which is an adduct of the two starting materials. The problem statement explicitly mentions that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are involved.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the first pericyclic reaction.**\n    It is unlikely that the stable aromatic ring of hexafluorobenzene reacts directly with cyclobutene. Aromatic compounds like benzene can undergo photochemical rearrangements to form less stable valence isomers. One of the most common photochemical reactions of benzene is its isomerization to Dewar benzene (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene).\n    *   **Reaction type:** This transformation involves the reorganization of the π-electron system within the hexafluorobenzene molecule. Specifically, two double bonds (4 π-electrons) rearrange to form one double bond and two new sigma bonds, creating a new four-membered ring. This is characteristic of an **electrocyclic reaction**.\n    *   **Woodward-Hoffmann Rules:** According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for photochemical reactions, a 4n π-electron system (where n=1, so 4π electrons) undergoes an electrocyclic reaction via a disrotatory pathway, which is symmetry-allowed.\n    *   **Intermediate:** So, the first step is the photochemical electrocyclic reaction of hexafluorobenzene to form its valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the second pericyclic reaction.**\n    The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene, is a bicyclic molecule with two strained C=C double bonds. This intermediate then reacts with the cyclobutene molecule.\n    *   **Bond analysis:** In the final product, the double bond of cyclobutene is gone, and one of the double bonds of the Dewar benzene intermediate is also gone. Two new single (sigma) bonds are formed that connect the two reactant molecules, creating a new four-membered ring.\n    *   **Reaction type:** The formation of a cyclic compound from two unsaturated molecules (each contributing a π-system) by forming new sigma bonds at the termini of the π-systems is the definition of a **cycloaddition reaction**. In this specific case, two π-electrons from a C=C bond in hexafluoro-Dewar benzene react with the two π-electrons from the C=C bond in cyclobutene. This is a **[π2 + π2] cycloaddition**, often simplified to **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n    *   **Woodward-Hoffmann Rules:** A [2+2] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed via a suprafacial-suprafacial ([π2s + π2s]) approach. This explains why the reaction proceeds under UV light to form the observed fused four-membered ring system.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the types of reactions.**\n    The overall transformation proceeds through a two-step sequence involving two distinct pericyclic reactions:\n    1.  An **electrocyclic reaction** (of hexafluorobenzene).\n    2.  A **[2+2] cycloaddition reaction** (between hexafluoro-Dewar benzene and cyclobutene).\n\n*   **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    The question asks for the kinds of pericyclic reactions involved. Based on the step-by-step analysis, the two reactions are an electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\n<<<A 4π electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition.>>>"
