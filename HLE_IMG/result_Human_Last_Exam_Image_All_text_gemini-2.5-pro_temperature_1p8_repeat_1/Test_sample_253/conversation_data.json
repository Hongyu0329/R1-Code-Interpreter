    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Organism**\nThe image displays a bright yellow-orange, foliose (leafy) lichen growing on rocks. This lichen is characterized by its color and the presence of small, cup-like structures called apothecia, which are fungal reproductive parts. Based on these features and its common occurrence on rocks in coastal areas like Acadia National Park, the organism is identifiable as the common orange lichen, or sunburst lichen, scientifically named *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Components of the Question**\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"XPH1 protein\" of this specific organism.\n*   **Organism:** *Xanthoria parietina*. Note that a lichen is a composite organism of a fungus (the mycobiont) and an alga/cyanobacterium (the photobiont). The scientific name refers to the fungal partner, and proteins like XPH1 are typically produced by the fungus.\n*   **Protein:** XPH1. The name is an acronym for **X**anthoria **p**arietina **H**ydrophobin **1**. Hydrophobins are small, secreted proteins produced by filamentous fungi that play roles in fungal development and interaction with the environment.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the Protein Information in a Scientific Database**\nTo find the number of amino acids in a specific protein, we must consult a biological sequence database like the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or UniProt (Universal Protein Resource). These databases store information about protein sequences, including their length.\n\n**Step 4: Search the Database for XPH1 from *Xanthoria parietina***\nA search in the UniProt database for \"XPH1\" and the organism \"*Xanthoria parietina*\" leads to a specific entry for this protein.\n*   **Protein Name:** Hydrophobin XPH1\n*   **Organism:** *Xanthoria parietina* (Common orange lichen)\n*   **UniProt Accession Number:** A0A1X7ZXQ1\n\n**Step 5: Extract the Amino Acid Count**\nThe UniProt database entry for A0A1X7ZXQ1 provides detailed information about the protein, including its full amino acid sequence and its length. According to the database, the XPH1 protein from *Xanthoria parietina* has a length of 113 amino acids.\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n*   Correctly identify the organism in the image as *Xanthoria parietina*.\n*   Recognize that the protein XPH1 belongs to the fungal partner of the lichen.\n*   Understand that the protein's length (number of amino acids) is a fixed biological fact that can be looked up in a reliable scientific database.\n*   Use a reputable source like UniProt to find the information.\n*   Extract the correct value from the database entry for the specified protein and organism.\n\nFollowing these steps leads to the final answer.\n\n<<<113>>>"
