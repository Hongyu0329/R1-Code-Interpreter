    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n**1. Identify the Key and Context:**\n*   The piece is Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor, Op. 13.\n*   This section, the *Allegro di molto e con brio*, is in the home key of C minor. The key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭).\n*   Measure 30 is part of a passage (mm. 29-34) that builds dominant tension before a cadence back to the tonic, C minor. The primary harmonic goal of this section is to lead to the dominant chord, G major.\n\n**2. Analyze the Bass Line (Left Hand):**\n*   In measure 30, the left hand plays a broken chord figure: G - B♮ - D - B♮.\n*   These notes clearly outline a G major triad. In the key of C minor, G major is the dominant chord (V). The B♭ of the C natural minor scale is raised to B♮ to create the leading tone to the tonic C. This is standard for a dominant chord in a minor key. The left hand establishes a V chord (G major) as the underlying harmony, acting as a pedal point.\n\n**3. Analyze the Melody and Harmony (Right Hand):**\n*   The right hand plays faster-moving figures above the left hand's G major triad.\n*   **Beat 1:** The right hand plays G on top, with D and F♯ below. The F♯ is a chromatic note (not in the key of C minor).\n*   **Beat 2:** The right hand plays G on top, with C and E♭ below. The E♭ is from the key signature.\n*   This pattern repeats for beats 3 and 4.\n\n**4. Combine and Identify the Full Harmony:**\n*   Let's list all the unique pitches present in this measure:\n    *   From the left hand: G, B♮, D. (The V chord).\n    *   From the right hand: F♯, G, D, C, E♭.\n*   The total collection of notes is: **G, B♮, C, D, E♭, F♯**.\n\n**5. Determine the Chord's Function and Identity:**\n*   The bass firmly establishes a dominant pedal (G). The notes in the right hand create tension over this dominant pedal.\n*   The crucial chromatic note is **F♯**. F♯ is the leading tone to G. A chord containing the leading tone to the dominant typically has a \"dominant of the dominant\" function.\n*   The two most common chords that function as a dominant to G are:\n    1.  **V/V (five of five):** A D dominant 7th chord (D - F♯ - A - C).\n    2.  **vii°7/V (seven-diminished-seven of five):** An F♯ diminished 7th chord (F♯ - A - C - E♭).\n*   Let's compare the notes in the measure to the notes of the vii°7/V chord (F♯°7). The theoretical notes are F♯, A, C, E♭.\n*   Our measure contains F♯, C, and E♭. The A is missing, which is common.\n*   Crucially, the notes that create the most tension and chromatic color over the G pedal are F♯, C, and E♭, which are the core components of the vii°7/V chord.\n*   This passage demonstrates a common technique where a secondary leading-tone chord is superimposed over a dominant pedal. The functional harmony is best described by the chord creating the tension (the upper structure).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chord in measure 30 is a secondary leading-tone diminished seventh chord built on F♯ (the leading tone to G), placed over a G major (V) pedal. The Roman numeral for this harmony is **vii°7/V**.\n\n<<<vii°7/V>>>"
