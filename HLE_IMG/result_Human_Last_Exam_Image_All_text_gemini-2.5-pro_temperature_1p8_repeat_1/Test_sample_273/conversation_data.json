    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Chiral Centers**\n\nFirst, we need to identify the chiral centers in the molecule. A chiral center (or stereocenter) is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In the given structure, there are three chiral centers along the main carbon backbone. Let's label them C2, C3, and C4 from right to left for the purpose of analysis (this is not necessarily the IUPAC numbering).\n\n*   **C2:** The rightmost chiral center is bonded to a methyl group (-CH3), an aminomethyl group (-CH2NH2), a hydrogen atom (implicit), and the rest of the carbon chain (the C3 group).\n*   **C3:** The middle chiral center is bonded to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), a hydrogen atom (implicit), the C2 group, and the C4 group.\n*   **C4:** The leftmost chiral center is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), a hydrogen atom (implicit), and the C3 group.\n\nA note on the drawing of C4: The drawing shows both the -OH and -CH3 groups with dashed lines (going into the page). For a standard tetrahedral sp3 carbon with two bonds in the plane of the page, this is geometrically impossible. We must assume a non-standard representation or a drawing error. The most charitable and logical interpretation that preserves tetrahedral geometry is to assume the two C-C backbone bonds are in the plane, and the implicit hydrogen atom at C4 is on a wedge (coming out of the page).\n\n**2. Assign Priorities to Substituents for Each Chiral Center**\n\nWe use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules, which rank substituents based on atomic number.\n\n**Analysis of C2 (rightmost center):**\n*   **Substituents:** -H, -CH3, -CH2NH2, and the C3-group (-CH(Et)...).\n*   **Priority Assignment:**\n    1.  We compare the atoms directly bonded to C2. These are H, C, C, C. H is the lowest priority (4).\n    2.  For the three carbon substituents, we look at the atoms they are bonded to:\n        *   -CH2NH2: C is bonded to (N, H, H).\n        *   C3-group: C is bonded to (C, C, H).\n        *   -CH3: C is bonded to (H, H, H).\n    3.  Comparing the highest atomic number at the first point of difference: N (in -CH2NH2) > C (in C3-group). Thus, -CH2NH2 is the highest priority group.\n    4.  Comparing the C3-group and -CH3: the C3-group is bonded to other carbons while -CH3 is only bonded to hydrogens. So, the C3-group has higher priority than -CH3.\n*   **Priority Order for C2:** (1) -CH2NH2 > (2) C3-group > (3) -CH3 > (4) -H.\n\n**Analysis of C3 (middle center):**\n*   **Substituents:** -H, -CH2CH3 (Et), C2-group (-CH(CH3)CH2NH2), and C4-group (-CH(OH)CH3).\n*   **Priority Assignment:**\n    1.  H is the lowest priority (4).\n    2.  Comparing the three carbon substituents:\n        *   C4-group: C is bonded to (O, C, H).\n        *   C2-group: C is bonded to (C, C, H).\n        *   Ethyl-group: C is bonded to (C, H, H).\n    3.  The C4-group has an oxygen atom, which has a higher atomic number than carbon. So, the C4-group is priority (1).\n    4.  The C2-group is bonded to two other carbons (in the CH3 and the chain toward C3), while the ethyl group is bonded to only one other carbon. Thus, the C2-group has higher priority than the ethyl group.\n*   **Priority Order for C3:** (1) C4-group > (2) C2-group > (3) -CH2CH3 > (4) -H.\n\n**Analysis of C4 (leftmost center):**\n*   **Substituents:** -H, -OH, -CH3, and the C3-group.\n*   **Priority Assignment:**\n    1.  Comparing atoms directly bonded to C4: O > C > H.\n    2.  -OH has the highest priority (1). H has the lowest priority (4).\n    3.  Between the C3-group and -CH3, the C3-group is a larger carbon chain, so it has higher priority.\n*   **Priority Order for C4:** (1) -OH > (2) C3-group > (3) -CH3 > (4) -H.\n\n**3. Determine the R/S Configuration for Each Chiral Center**\n\n**Configuration of C2:**\n*   **Geometry:** -CH2NH2 (1) is wedge (front), -CH3 (3) is dash (back). The C-C backbone bond (to C3, #2) and the C-H bond (#4) are in the plane.\n*   **Determination:** We orient the molecule so the lowest priority group (H, #4) is pointing away. However, here it's in the plane. A simple method is to swap the H (#4) with the group pointing away, which is -CH3 (#3). Now H is in the back. The order of the remaining groups (1 -> 2 -> new 3) is now: -CH2NH2 (wedge) -> C3-group (plane) -> H (in plane, was -CH3). This traces a clockwise (CW) path. Since we performed one swap, the original configuration is the opposite, i.e., counter-clockwise (CCW).\n*   **C2 configuration is S.**\n\n**Configuration of C3:**\n*   **Geometry:** The ethyl group (#3) is on a wedge (front). The two C-C backbone bonds are in the plane. For a standard tetrahedral representation, the implicit H (#4) must be on a dash (back).\n*   **Determination:** With the lowest priority group (H, #4) in the back, we trace the path from 1 -> 2 -> 3. The C4-group (#1) is to the left, the C2-group (#2) is to the right, and the ethyl group (#3) is in front. The path from 1 -> 2 -> 3 is clockwise (CW).\n*   **C3 configuration is R.**\n\n**Configuration of C4:**\n*   **Geometry:** As discussed, we assume the implicit H (#4) is on a wedge (front). -OH (#1) and -CH3 (#3) are on dashes (back). The C3-group (#2) is in the plane.\n*   **Determination:** The lowest priority group (H, #4) is in front. We trace the path 1 -> 2 -> 3. The -OH (#1) is back, the C3-group (#2) is in the plane, and the -CH3 (#3) is also back. Viewing from the front, this path is clockwise (CW). Because the lowest priority group is pointing towards us, we reverse the result. CW becomes CCW.\n*   **C4 configuration is S.**\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nTo provide the full absolute configuration, we should use the IUPAC numbering. The structure is 3-ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-methylpentan-1-amine. The chiral centers are at positions 2, 3, and 4.\n*   The center we labeled C2 corresponds to C2 in the IUPAC name. Its configuration is **S**.\n*   The center we labeled C3 corresponds to C3 in the IUPAC name. Its configuration is **R**.\n*   The center we labeled C4 corresponds to C4 in the IUPAC name. Its configuration is **S**.\n\nTherefore, the absolute configuration of the molecule is (2S, 3R, 4S).\n\n<<< (2S, 3R, 4S) >>>"
