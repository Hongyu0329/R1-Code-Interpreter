    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to distinguish the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant structure:** The question asks about the sporophyte. In mosses, the sporophyte is the spore-producing generation that grows from the leafy gametophyte. It typically consists of a foot (embedded in the gametophyte), a stalk (called the **seta**), and a capsule (called the **sporangium**) which contains the spores. For visual identification at a glance, we primarily look at the seta and the capsule.\n\n2.  **Analyze the name *Grimmia curviseta*:** The specific epithet \"*curviseta*\" provides a major clue. It is derived from Latin: \"*curvus*\" meaning \"curved\" and \"*seta*\" referring to the stalk. This name directly indicates that a key feature of this species is its curved seta.\n\n3.  **Examine the sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta*:** Due to its distinctly curved or bent (arcuate) seta, the capsule of *Grimmia curviseta* is not held upright. Instead, it is nodding, pendent (hanging down), or cernuous (drooping), often nestled amongst the leaves of the gametophyte. This swan-neck curve of the seta is a prominent feature.\n\n4.  **Examine the sporophyte of *Grimmia montana*:** In contrast, *Grimmia montana* has a very short and **straight** seta. This holds the capsule in an erect position. The capsule appears emergent (partially exposed) to shortly exserted (held just above) the surrounding perichaetial leaves (the special leaves at the base of the seta). The image provided, showing erect capsules on very short, straight setae, is characteristic of *Grimmia montana* or a closely related species with similar features.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the main difference:** The most striking and easily observable difference between the sporophytes of these two species is the **shape and orientation of the seta**.\n    *   *Grimmia montana* has a **short, straight seta**, resulting in an **erect capsule**.\n    *   *Grimmia curviseta* has a **distinctly curved seta**, resulting in a **nodding or pendent capsule**.\n\n**List of careful points:**\n\n*   **Focus on the Seta:** While the capsules themselves might have subtle differences, the most reliable and \"at-a-glance\" distinguishing feature of the sporophyte is the seta's shape.\n*   **Understand Terminology:** Knowing that \"sporophyte\" refers to the seta and capsule, and that \"curviseta\" literally means \"curved seta,\" is key to answering the question.\n*   **Observe Capsule Orientation:** The shape of the seta directly influences the orientation of the capsule. A straight seta leads to an erect capsule, while a curved seta leads to a nodding or hanging capsule. This orientation is what you see in the field.\n*   **Check for Maturity:** These features are best observed on mature but not overly old sporophytes. In the provided image, the capsules are old (dehisced), but their erect posture is still clearly visible.\n*   **Consider the Gametophyte:** While the question asks about the sporophyte, remember that both species belong to the \"hoary\" grimmia group, meaning their leaves have silvery hair-points, giving the plant a greyish-white cast. Therefore, the leafy part of the plant looks similar, making the sporophyte features even more important for quick differentiation.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe main difference is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is very short and straight, holding the capsule in an erect position. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is distinctly curved or swan-necked, causing the capsule to be nodding or pendent (hanging downwards).\n\n<<<The main difference is in the seta (the stalk). *Grimmia montana* has a short, straight seta that holds the capsule erect, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a strongly curved seta that causes the capsule to be nodding or pendent.>>>"
