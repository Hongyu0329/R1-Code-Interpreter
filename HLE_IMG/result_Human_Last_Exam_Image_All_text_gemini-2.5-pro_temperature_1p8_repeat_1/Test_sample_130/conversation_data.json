    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Image:** The image provided is an emission spectrum. An emission spectrum is produced when atoms of an element are excited (e.g., by heat or electricity) and then release that energy in the form of light. The light is not a continuous rainbow but consists of a series of discrete, bright lines at specific wavelengths (colors). This pattern of lines is a unique \"fingerprint\" for each chemical element.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Features of the Spectrum:** Let's break down the visible lines in the provided spectrum from right to left (from longer wavelength to shorter wavelength):\n    *   **Red Region:** There is a distinct, bright red line. There are also a couple of fainter lines nearby.\n    *   **Yellow/Orange Region:** There is a very prominent, bright yellow line.\n    *   **Green Region:** There are several lines, including a noticeable bright green one and another slightly bluer-green (cyan) one.\n    *   **Blue/Violet Region:** There is a cluster of several distinct lines in the blue and violet parts of the spectrum.\n\n3.  **Compare with Known Spectra of Common Elements:**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** The visible spectrum of hydrogen (the Balmer series) is very simple, consisting of four main lines: a red line (656 nm), a blue-green line (486 nm), a blue-violet line (434 nm), and a violet line (410 nm). The spectrum in the image is far more complex than this. Therefore, it is not hydrogen.\n    *   **Sodium (Na):** Sodium's spectrum is famously dominated by a very strong, closely spaced pair of yellow lines (a \"doublet\") around 589 nm. While the image shows a bright yellow line, it also has many other strong lines in the red, green, and blue regions, which are not characteristic of a pure sodium spectrum.\n    *   **Neon (Ne):** Neon is known for its many bright lines in the red and orange part of the spectrum, which is why neon signs are typically reddish-orange. The spectrum in the image has significant lines across the entire visible range, especially in the green and blue, so it is not neon.\n    *   **Helium (He):** The emission spectrum of Helium is well-known and matches the image very closely. Its characteristic visible lines include:\n        *   A bright red line (~667.8 nm)\n        *   A very bright yellow line (~587.6 nm)\n        *   A bright green line (~501.6 nm)\n        *   A blue-green (cyan) line (~492.2 nm)\n        *   A bright blue-violet line (~447.1 nm)\n        *   Several other lines in the blue and violet region.\n    This pattern of a strong red, a very strong yellow, a prominent green, and multiple blue/violet lines perfectly matches the spectrum shown in the image.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the unique pattern of bright emission lines across the red, yellow, green, and blue-violet parts of the spectrum, the element can be positively identified by comparing it to known elemental spectra. The pattern is the characteristic fingerprint of Helium.\n\n<<<Helium>>>"
