    "*   **Step 1: Identify the main structure of the coordination complex.**\n    The central metal atom is Iridium (Ir) with a +1 charge. It is coordinated by three bidentate ligands. This is a common structure for Iridium(III) complexes used in photochemistry and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).\n    1.  **Ligand 1 (ppy¹ type):** Composed of rings A (phenyl) and B (pyridine). The nitrogen of pyridine B and carbon-6 (C6) of the phenyl ring A coordinate to the Iridium center, forming a cyclometalated ligand (C^N).\n    2.  **Ligand 2 (ppy² type):** Composed of rings C (phenyl) and D (pyridine). The nitrogen of pyridine D and carbon-6 (C6) of the phenyl ring C coordinate to the Iridium center, forming a second cyclometalated ligand (C^N).\n    3.  **Ligand 3 (bpy type):** Composed of rings E and F, both of which are pyridine rings. The two nitrogen atoms from rings E and F coordinate to the Iridium center, forming a bidentate N,N-ligand, characteristic of a bipyridine (or related diazine) ligand.\n    So the overall complex is of the type [Ir(C^N)₂(N^N)]⁺.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the peripheral phenyl rings in question.**\n    The question asks about the rotational freedom of the phenyl rings labeled G, J, L, K, and H. These are all substituents attached to the main ligand framework via single carbon-carbon bonds.\n\n*   **Step 3: Define \"free rotation\".**\n    Free rotation can occur around a single bond (sigma bond) connecting two parts of a molecule. Rotation is considered \"restricted\" or \"hindered\" if there is a significant energy barrier, which is typically caused by steric hindrance (atomic clash) or electronic effects (like being part of a larger, rigid planar system). In this context, we are looking for rings whose rotation is significantly hindered by neighboring atoms or groups.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the local environment of each peripheral phenyl ring to assess its rotational freedom.**\n\n    *   **Ring H:** It is attached to carbon-4 (C4) of ring A. On ring A, C4 is *meta* to the C6-Ir bond and *para* to the C3-B bond. Positions that are *meta* or *para* to bulky groups generally experience low steric hindrance. Therefore, the single bond connecting ring H to ring A allows for free rotation.\n\n    *   **Ring J:** It is attached to carbon-4 (C4) of ring C. This is analogous to ring H. C4 is *meta* to the C6-Ir bond and *para* to the C3-D bond. This position is also relatively unhindered, so the bond connecting ring J to ring C allows for free rotation.\n\n    *   **Ring G:** It is attached to carbon-5 (C5) of ring F (a pyridine). Ring F is part of the bipyridine-type ligand. The nitrogen is at position 6 and the connection to ring E is at position 2 (assuming standard numbering). C5 is *meta* to both the N-Ir bond at C6 and the C2-E bond. This is not a sterically congested position. Thus, ring G can rotate freely.\n\n    *   **Ring K:** It is attached to carbon-2 (C2) of ring A. This position is *ortho* to the C3 position, which is bonded to the bulky pyridine ring B. This `ortho` substitution creates significant steric clash between the ortho-hydrogens of ring K and the ortho-hydrogen of ring B. This arrangement severely restricts rotation. Furthermore, the diagram explicitly shows a dotted line from C6 of ring K to the Iridium center (Ir...C6(K)), indicating a specific stabilizing interaction (anagostic or similar weak coordination). This interaction would lock ring K into a fixed orientation, preventing free rotation.\n\n    *   **Ring L:** It is attached to carbon-5 (C5) of ring A. This position is *ortho* to the C6 position, which is directly bonded to the very bulky Iridium atom and its entire coordination sphere. Any rotation of ring L around the C5(A)-C(L) bond would cause one of its ortho-hydrogens to sweep past the Iridium center and its other ligands, leading to a massive steric clash. This severe steric hindrance restricts the free rotation of ring L.\n\n*   **Step 5: Consolidate the results.**\n    *   Rings that can rotate freely: G, J, H.\n    *   Rings with restricted rotation: K, L.\n\n*   **Step 6: Compare with the given answer choices.**\n    The set of freely rotating rings is {G, J, H}. This corresponds to answer choice E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
