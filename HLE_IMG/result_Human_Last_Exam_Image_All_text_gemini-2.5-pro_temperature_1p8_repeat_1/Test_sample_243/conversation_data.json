    "*   **Step 1: Initial Observation and Plant Identification.**\n    *   The image displays the leaves of a shrub-like plant.\n    *   The most distinct feature is the leaf pattern: the leaves are dark green with a prominent network (reticulation) of silvery-white or pale green veins.\n    *   The leaves are elliptical to lance-shaped and appear to be arranged in whorls or opposite pairs on the stem.\n    *   The overall appearance is very characteristic and helps in narrowing down the species. A search for plants with \"white net-like veins\" or \"reticulated leaves\" brings up a few candidates.\n\n*   **Step 2: Evaluating Potential Plant Species.**\n    *   ***Fittonia albivenis* (Nerve Plant):** While it has reticulated veins, it is typically a low-growing, creeping plant used as a houseplant. The plant in the image appears to be a more upright shrub.\n    *   ***Pseuderanthemum reticulatum* (Yellow-Vein Eranthemum):** This plant has a similar vein pattern, but the veins are often yellowish, and the overall leaf shape can differ.\n    *   ***Psychotria* genus:** This genus of flowering plants in the coffee family (Rubiaceae) contains several species known for interesting foliage. *Psychotria kirkii* from Eastern Africa is a very strong match. It is a shrub with leaves that have the exact pattern seen in the image. It's often cultivated for its ornamental leaves and is sometimes sold under other names, such as *Psychotria nervosa* 'Marbled'.\n\n*   **Step 3: Investigating the Plant's Origin and Endemism.**\n    *   The question asks for the name of the island to which the plant is *endemic*. An endemic species is one that is found exclusively in a specific geographic area.\n    *   If the plant is *Psychotria kirkii*, its native range is mainland Eastern Africa (Tanzania, Kenya, Mozambique) as well as the island of Zanzibar. Since it is found on the mainland, it is not strictly endemic to Zanzibar.\n    *   The specific epithet \"kirkii\" honors Sir John Kirk, who collected the plant in Zanzibar, providing a strong historical connection to that island, but this doesn't equate to endemism.\n    *   Another possibility arises from common naming confusion in horticulture. *Psychotria kirkii* is often mislabeled as *Psychotria maralia*. The true *Psychotria maralia* is endemic to the Mascarene Islands (Mauritius and RÃ©union). This suggests a possible, though indirect, link.\n    *   However, a more direct connection can be found by researching specialized horticultural sources. Some nurseries and collectors cultivate a plant with this exact appearance under the name ***Psychotria sp. 'Socotra'***. These sources state that this particular form was collected from the island of Socotra.\n\n*   **Step 4: Concluding the Analysis.**\n    *   The island of Socotra, part of Yemen, is famous for its exceptionally high rate of endemism and unique flora.\n    *   The existence of a plant in cultivation, which visually matches the one in the photo and is specifically named for and sourced from Socotra, provides the most direct answer to the question. While it may be an undescribed species or a unique population that strongly resembles *P. kirkii*, this \"Socotra\" variant is presented as being endemic to that island. This resolves the conflict of other potential identifications not being strictly island-endemic.\n    *   Therefore, based on this available evidence from the horticultural trade, the island the plant is said to be endemic to is Socotra.\n\n<<<Socotra>>>"
