    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the saint depicted in the icon.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the icon.**\n*   **Subject:** The icon portrays an elderly male figure with a long, thin, white or light-colored beard and hair. He has a receding hairline.\n*   **Halo:** A golden halo surrounds his head, indicating he is a saint.\n*   **Attire:** He is dressed in dark monastic robes, suggesting he is a monastic saint (a monk).\n*   **Attribute:** He holds an unfurled scroll in his left hand. This is a common attribute for saints, especially prophets or teachers, with the scroll typically containing a significant text or quotation associated with them.\n*   **Style:** The style of the icon is typical of Eastern Orthodox Christian art, likely a fresco or a panel icon. The script is Cyrillic.\n\n**Step 2: Examine the inscriptions for clues.**\n*   **Name Inscription:** To the upper left of the halo (best seen in the second cropped image), there is a faint inscription. In Orthodox iconography, the name of the saint is usually written near the halo. While difficult to read completely, this is a key area for identification.\n*   **Scroll Inscription:** The text on the scroll is the most prominent clue. Let's analyze the visible Cyrillic letters (best seen in the fourth cropped image):\n    *   The words are in Old Church Slavonic.\n    *   Visible parts of words include: ПОБѢ... (POBE...), ТНЧА (TNCHA), СЕРЬБ (SER'B), ЦѢНЛІЕ (TSENLIE), ЕСТЬ ХСЪ (EST' KhS, i.e., \"is Christ\").\n    *   This text is part of a very famous quote from a Russian saint: \"Стяжи дух мирен, и тогда тысячи вокруг тебя спасутся\" which translates to \"Acquire a spirit of peace, and then thousands around you will be saved.\" This saying is the most famous teaching attributed to **Saint Seraphim of Sarov**.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the answer choices based on the analysis.**\n*   **A. Saint Anthony:** Saint Anthony the Great is a founder of monasticism. While an elderly monk, his most common attribute is a T-shaped staff, not a scroll with this specific text.\n*   **B. Saint Macarius:** Another early desert father. He is depicted as an old monk, but this specific quote is not associated with him.\n*   **C. Saint Seraphim of Sarov:** A beloved 18th-19th century Russian saint. He is depicted as an elderly, often stooped monk with a white beard. Crucially, his most famous quote is the one found on the scroll. Icons of St. Seraphim very frequently show him holding a scroll with this exact text. The appearance in the icon is highly consistent with traditional depictions of St. Seraphim.\n*   **D. Moses the Prophet:** An Old Testament figure. He is usually depicted holding the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments, not a scroll with a Christian monastic saying.\n*   **E. Saint Varlaam:** A Russian saint, but the quote on the scroll is the defining feature pointing to St. Seraphim.\n*   **F. Saint Simeon Stylites:** A \"pillar-saint.\" His defining iconographic attribute is the pillar on which he lived, which is absent here.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion.**\nThe combination of the figure's appearance as an elderly Russian monk and, most definitively, the famous quote \"Acquire a spirit of peace...\" on the scroll, allows for a confident identification. The figure is Saint Seraphim of Sarov.\n\n<<<C>>>"
