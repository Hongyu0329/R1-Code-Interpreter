    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual information in the images.**\n    The images, labeled L, M, and N, show a time-lapse or comparative view of a filamentous structure, which appears to be composed of a chain of cells. These are likely cells from a plant, alga, or fungus, as they possess a rigid outer layer, the cell wall. The images are micrographs, showing the cells at high magnification.\n\n*   **Step 2: Compare the states of the cells in each image.**\n    *   In image **L**, the cells appear plump and full. The plasma membrane (the boundary of the cell's cytoplasm) is pressed firmly against the inside of the cell wall. This is a normal, turgid state for such a cell. The black arrowhead points to a septum, the cross-wall separating two adjacent cells.\n    *   In image **M**, the same filament is shown, but the cells have visibly changed. The cell below the arrowhead is beginning to constrict and shrink. The contents of the cell (the protoplast) are starting to pull away from the cell wall, particularly in the middle of the cell.\n    *   In image **N**, this process is even more advanced. The protoplast has shrunk significantly and pulled away from the cell wall, causing a noticeable gap between the two. The cell has lost its rigidity and appears flaccid, and the filament has started to bend.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the biological process corresponding to these changes.**\n    The observed phenomenon is the shrinking of the protoplast (the living part of the cell, including the cytoplasm and vacuole, enclosed by the plasma membrane) away from the cell wall. This occurs when a cell with a cell wall is placed in a hypertonic solutionâ€”a solution with a lower water potential (higher solute concentration) than the cell's interior. Due to osmosis, water moves from inside the cell (higher water potential) to the surrounding solution (lower water potential), causing the cell to lose water and volume. This specific process of the protoplast pulling away from the cell wall due to water loss is called **plasmolysis**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the depicted process.**\n    The sequence from L to N clearly illustrates the stages of plasmolysis. Image L represents the turgid state before plasmolysis, while images M and N show incipient and advanced stages of plasmolysis, respectively. The arrowheads highlight a key area where this cellular collapse is occurring. Therefore, the process being depicted is plasmolysis.\n\n<<<Plasmolysis>>>"
