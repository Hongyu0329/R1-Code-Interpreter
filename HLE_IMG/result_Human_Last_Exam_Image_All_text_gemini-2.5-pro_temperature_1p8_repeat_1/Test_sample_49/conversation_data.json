    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\nThe circuit is a low-pass filter. It consists of an infinite resistive ladder network that acts as the resistive part of the filter, and a capacitor `C` connected from the output node $a_0$ to ground, acting as the frequency-dependent element. The input signal is applied at node `g` (also labeled $c_0$).\nThe cutoff frequency is the frequency at which the filter's output signal power is attenuated to half of its passband (DC) power. For a first-order low-pass filter, this corresponds to the angular frequency $\\omega_c$ where the output voltage magnitude drops to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its DC value.\n\n**2. Finding the Cutoff Frequency Formula**\nThe voltage at node $a_0$, which is the voltage across the capacitor, can be found using the Thevenin equivalent circuit of the resistive ladder as seen from terminals $a_0$ and ground. Let this be a Thevenin voltage $V_{th}$ in series with a Thevenin resistance $R_{th}$. The capacitor $C$ is connected across this Thevenin equivalent circuit.\n\nThe transfer function $H(j\\omega) = V_{out}/V_{in} = V_{a0}/V_{g}$ will be:\n$H(j\\omega) = \\frac{V_{th}}{V_{in}} \\cdot \\frac{Z_C}{R_{th} + Z_C} = G_{dc} \\cdot \\frac{1/(j\\omega C)}{R_{th} + 1/(j\\omega C)} = G_{dc} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 + j\\omega R_{th}C}$\nwhere $G_{dc} = V_{th}/V_{in}$ is the DC gain of the network.\n\nThe magnitude of the transfer function is $|H(j\\omega)| = |G_{dc}| / \\sqrt{1 + (\\omega R_{th}C)^2}$.\nThe cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$ occurs when the denominator is $\\sqrt{2}$, which means $(\\omega_c R_{th}C)^2 = 1$.\nTherefore, the angular cutoff frequency is given by:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\nThe cutoff frequency in Hertz is $f_c = \\omega_c / (2\\pi) = 1/(2\\pi R_{th}C)$. We will determine the angular cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$. The main task is to find the Thevenin resistance $R_{th}$.\n\n**3. Calculating the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to calculate the equivalent resistance seen from node $a_0$ looking into the network with all independent sources deactivated. Deactivating the input voltage source at `IN` (node $g=c_0$) means grounding this node. The circuit for calculating $R_{th}$ is the resistive ladder with node $c_0$ grounded, and we are finding the resistance between node $a_0$ (which we can label $d_0$) and ground.\n\nWe can solve this using nodal analysis. Let's apply a test voltage $V_T$ at node $d_0$, so $v_{d0} = V_T$. Since $c_0$ is grounded, $v_{c0} = 0$. We need to find the total current $I_T$ supplied by the test source. Then $R_{th} = V_T / I_T$.\n\nThe ladder consists of nodes $c_n$ and $d_n$ for $n=0, 1, 2, ...$. The KCL equations for any node $n \\ge 1$ are:\nAt node $c_n$: $\\frac{v_{cn}-v_{c,n-1}}{r} + \\frac{v_{cn}-v_{c,n+1}}{r} + \\frac{v_{cn}-v_{dn}}{r} = 0 \\implies 3v_{cn} - v_{c,n-1} - v_{c,n+1} - v_{dn} = 0$ (Eq. 1)\nAt node $d_n$: $\\frac{v_{dn}-v_{d,n-1}}{r} + \\frac{v_{dn}-v_{d,n+1}}{r} + \\frac{v_{dn}-v_{cn}}{r} = 0 \\implies 3v_{dn} - v_{d,n-1} - v_{d,n+1} - v_{cn} = 0$ (Eq. 2)\n\n**4. Solving the Difference Equations**\nThis system of coupled linear difference equations can be solved by making a substitution. Let $s_n = v_{cn} + v_{dn}$ and $m_n = v_{cn} - v_{dn}$.\n\nAdding (Eq. 1) and (Eq. 2):\n$3(v_{cn}+v_{dn}) - (v_{c,n-1}+v_{d,n-1}) - (v_{c,n+1}+v_{d,n+1}) - (v_{cn}+v_{dn}) = 0$\n$2s_n - s_{n-1} - s_{n+1} = 0 \\implies s_{n+1} - 2s_n + s_{n-1} = 0$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nThe characteristic equation is $k^2-2k+1=0$, or $(k-1)^2=0$, with a double root $k=1$. The general solution is $s_n = A(1)^n + B n(1)^n = A + Bn$. Since the potentials in a passive network must be bounded as $n \\to \\infty$, we must have $B=0$. So, $s_n = A$ (a constant).\nUsing the boundary condition at $n=0$: $s_0 = v_{c0} + v_{d0} = 0 + V_T = V_T$. Since $s_n$ is constant for all $n \\ge 0$, we have $s_n = V_T$.\n\nSubtracting (Eq. 2) from (Eq. 1):\n$3(v_{cn}-v_{dn}) - (v_{c,n-1}-v_{d,n-1}) - (v_{c,n+1}-v_{d,n+1}) + (v_{cn}-v_{dn}) = 0$\n$4m_n - m_{n-1} - m_{n+1} = 0 \\implies m_{n+1} - 4m_n + m_{n-1} = 0$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nThe characteristic equation is $k^2-4k+1=0$. The roots are $k = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16-4}}{2} = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}$.\nThe general solution is $m_n = C_1(2+\\sqrt{3})^n + C_2(2-\\sqrt{3})^n$.\nSince the potentials must decay to zero as we move away from the source, $v_{cn} \\to 0$ and $v_{dn} \\to 0$ as $n \\to \\infty$. Thus, $m_n \\to 0$. As $2+\\sqrt{3} > 1$, its corresponding coefficient must be zero, so $C_1=0$.\nThe solution is $m_n = C_2(2-\\sqrt{3})^n$.\nUsing the boundary condition at $n=0$: $m_0 = v_{c0} - v_{d0} = 0 - V_T = -V_T$.\n$m_0 = C_2(2-\\sqrt{3})^0 = C_2$. So, $C_2 = -V_T$.\nThe solution for $m_n$ is $m_n = -V_T (2-\\sqrt{3})^n$.\n\n**5. Final Calculation of $R_{th}$**\nThe current $I_T$ from the test source flows through the resistor between $d_0$ and $d_1$.\n$I_T = \\frac{v_{d0} - v_{d1}}{r}$.\nWe have $v_{d0} = V_T$. We need to find $v_{d1}$.\nWe can find $v_{d1}$ from $s_1$ and $m_1$:\n$s_1 = v_{c1} + v_{d1} = V_T$\n$m_1 = v_{c1} - v_{d1} = -V_T(2-\\sqrt{3})$\nSubtracting the second equation from the first: $(v_{c1}+v_{d1}) - (v_{c1}-v_{d1}) = V_T - (-V_T(2-\\sqrt{3}))$.\n$2v_{d1} = V_T(1 + 2 - \\sqrt{3}) = V_T(3 - \\sqrt{3})$.\n$v_{d1} = \\frac{V_T(3-\\sqrt{3})}{2}$.\n\nNow, substitute this into the expression for $I_T$:\n$I_T = \\frac{V_T - \\frac{V_T(3-\\sqrt{3})}{2}}{r} = \\frac{V_T}{r} \\left(1 - \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{V_T}{r} \\left(\\frac{2-3+\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{V_T}{r} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{2}$.\n\nFinally, the Thevenin resistance is:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{V_T}{I_T} = \\frac{V_T}{\\frac{V_T}{r} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{2}} = r \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}-1} = r \\frac{2(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{(\\sqrt{3}-1)(\\sqrt{3}+1)} = r \\frac{2(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{3-1} = r(\\sqrt{3}+1)$.\n\n**6. Determining the Cutoff Frequency**\nNow substitute $R_{th}$ into the formula for the angular cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(\\sqrt{3}+1)C}$.\nThe cutoff frequency in Hertz is $f_c = \\frac{\\omega_c}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r(\\sqrt{3}+1)C}$. Conventionally, when asked for a symbolic expression, the angular frequency $\\omega_c$ is often the intended answer due to its cleaner form.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation: The question asks for the cutoff frequency. We will provide the expression for the angular cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$.\n\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{(1+\\sqrt{3})rC}$\n\n<<<1/((1+sqrt(3))*r*C)>>>"
