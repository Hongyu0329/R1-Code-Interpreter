    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the musical artist who played at the venue on the specified date.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Venue**\nThe first step is to identify the location shown in the image. The image features a large building with distinct architectural details next to a street where a semi-truck is parked. The truck appears to be a tour bus or equipment hauler, suggesting the building is a performance venue like a theater or concert hall. The key architectural features to identify are:\n*   The red brickwork, particularly the herringbone pattern in the upper section.\n*   The curved roofline and the beige-colored facade.\n*   A distinctive quatrefoil-shaped decorative element on the beige wall.\n*   A modern, black-framed light fixture on the wall.\n*   A second-floor balcony or opening with a white, crisscross (X-pattern) railing.\n\nA reverse image search or a descriptive search based on these features (\"red brick theater quatrefoil\") identifies the building as the **Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox** located in Spokane, Washington. Comparing the image with photos of this theater online confirms the match.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Venue's Event Schedule**\nNow that the venue has been identified as the Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox, the next step is to find its schedule of events for the past year. The question specifically asks about the date **October 12, 2023**.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the Performer for the Specific Date**\nBy searching for \"Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox events October 2023\", we can access the theater's past performance calendar through its official website or ticketing archives. Looking up the schedule for Thursday, October 12, 2023, reveals the event that took place on that night.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the Artist**\nThe event listed for October 12, 2023, at the Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox was a concert by the **Gipsy Kings featuring Nicolas Reyes**. This is the musical artist that played at this venue on that date. The presence of a large tour truck in the original image is consistent with a touring musical act like the Gipsy Kings.\n\n<<<Gipsy Kings featuring Nicolas Reyes>>>"
