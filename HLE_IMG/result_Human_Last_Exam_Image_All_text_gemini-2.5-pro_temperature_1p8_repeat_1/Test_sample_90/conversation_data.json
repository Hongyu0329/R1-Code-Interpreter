    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the structures of products A, B, and C.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material (SM):** 1-(4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid, (C₁₀H₁₄N₂O₂). This is an N-substituted α-amino acid, which can exist as a zwitterion.\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   **Methyl propiolate (MP):** An unsymmetrical, electron-deficient alkyne (H−C≡C−COOCH₃, C₄H₄O₂). It is a dipolarophile.\n    *   **Acetic Anhydride (Ac₂O):** A dehydrating and acetylating agent.\n    *   **Triethylamine (TEA):** A non-nucleophilic base.\n    *   **Heat (70 °C):** To provide activation energy.\n\n*   **Overall Reaction Type:** This combination of reagents (N-substituted amino acid, Ac₂O, and an alkyne) is characteristic of a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction. The starting material and Ac₂O react to form a mesoionic 1,3-dipole. This dipole then reacts with the dipolarophile (methyl propiolate). The complexity of the starting material and the formation of three products suggest that the primary cycloadduct undergoes subsequent rearrangements, fragmentations, or side reactions.\n\n**2. Formation of the 1,3-Dipole and Primary Adduct**\n\n*   The reaction of the starting material (SM) with acetic anhydride (Ac₂O) generates a bicyclic mesoionic pyrimidinium olate. This is the 1,3-dipole. The formation involves an intramolecular cyclization-dehydration process.\n    `SM (C₁₀H₁₄N₂O₂) + Ac₂O → Dipole (C₁₀H₁₂N₂O) + 2 AcOH`\n*   This dipole then undergoes a [3+2] cycloaddition with methyl propiolate (MP).\n    `Dipole (C₁₀H₁₂N₂O) + MP (C₄H₄O₂) → Primary Adduct (P1, C₁₄H₁₆N₂O₃)`\n*   This primary adduct, P1, is a highly strained, polycyclic molecule which serves as a common intermediate for products A and B. Product C is likely formed from a side reaction that does not involve methyl propiolate.\n\n**3. Analysis of Product C**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₃ (DoU = 5)\n*   **NMR Data:**\n    *   ¹³C NMR shows three C=O peaks (168, 166.8, 164.9) and eight sp³ carbon peaks. The absence of sp² carbons (other than C=O) indicates a saturated cyclic system.\n    *   ¹H NMR shows a singlet at 2.03 ppm (3H), characteristic of an acetyl group (CH₃CO−). A downfield doublet of doublets at 5.41 ppm (1H) suggests a proton on a carbon atom flanked by heteroatoms (N) and/or carbonyl groups.\n*   **Formation:** Product C is formed from the starting material and acetic anhydride, without the involvement of methyl propiolate. Literature precedents for this reaction show the formation of a tricyclic system. Given the formula (DoU=5) and NMR (3 C=O, so DoU=3 from carbonyls, meaning 2 rings remain), a bicyclic structure is more likely, meaning one of the rings from the SM has opened. The structure consistent with the data is formed by acetylation and rearrangement, resulting in a bicyclic dione.\n\n**Structure of C:** A plausible structure that fits the spectral data and molecular formula is a bicyclic system containing a pyrrolidine ring fused to an N-acetylated piperidine-dione ring.\n\n**4. Analysis of Product B**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₃ (DoU = 7)\n*   **NMR Data:**\n    *   ¹³C NMR shows three C=O peaks, two sp² peaks (147.8, 129.1), and eight sp³ peaks.\n    *   ¹H NMR shows two vinyl protons as doublets at 7.58 and 5.98 ppm with a coupling constant of J = 6.1 Hz, indicative of a cis-disubstituted double bond within a ring, likely part of a dihydropyridone system. There is no signal for a methoxy group (-OCH₃).\n*   **Formation:** The molecular formula of B can be related to the primary adduct P1:\n    `B (C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₃) = P1 (C₁₄H₁₆N₂O₃) - C₂H₂`\n    This corresponds to the fragmentation of the primary cycloadduct P1 with the loss of acetylene (C₂H₂). This is a plausible retro-cycloaddition type rearrangement. The loss of the ester's methyl group and rearrangement lead to the final structure.\n\n**Structure of B:** The structure is a tricyclic system containing a dihydropyridone ring fused to the original pyrrolidine ring skeleton. The loss of the C₂H₂ fragment and rearrangement result in the observed spectroscopic features.\n\n**5. Analysis of Product A**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₁₄H₂₀N₂O₃ (DoU = 6)\n*   **NMR Data:**\n    *   ¹³C NMR shows two C=O peaks (171.3, 167.8), four sp² carbon peaks (136.3, 134.9, 110.5, 101.5), a methoxy carbon (51.7), and seven other sp³ carbons. The four sp² carbons suggest a substituted heteroaromatic ring, like a pyrrole, or a conjugated diene system within a ring.\n    *   ¹H NMR shows a vinyl proton at 6.14 ppm, a methoxy singlet at 3.77 ppm, an acetyl-like singlet at 2.00 ppm, and a broad NH-like singlet at 7.95 ppm.\n*   **Formation:** The molecular formula of A can be related to the primary adduct P1:\n    `A (C₁₄H₂₀N₂O₃) = P1 (C₁₄H₁₆N₂O₃) + 4H`\n    This indicates that product A is a reduced form of the primary adduct P1. The addition of four hydrogen atoms (equivalent to two H₂ molecules) saturates two double bonds or one double bond and one ring in P1. The source of hydrogen is likely a disproportionation reaction where another intermediate is oxidized, or from a less common reduction pathway involving the reagents. The structure of A retains the methyl ester group from methyl propiolate. The broad singlet at 7.95 ppm, given the lack of obvious NH groups in related structures, could be an artifact or part of a less common tautomer.\n\n**Structure of A:** The structure is a tricyclic system derived from the reduction of the primary adduct P1. It contains the intact carbon skeleton of P1, including the methyl ester group, but with a higher degree of saturation.\n\n---\n### **Final Structures**\n\nBased on the detailed step-by-step analysis and comparison with known chemical reactions of this type:\n\n*   **Product A (C₁₄H₂₀N₂O₃):** A reduced version of the initial [3+2] cycloadduct. It is a tricyclic system containing a tetrahydropyridine ring, the original pyrrolidine rings, a methyl ester group, and an acetyl group.\n*   **Product B (C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₃):** A fragmentation product of the initial cycloadduct. It is a tricyclic system containing a dihydropyridone ring.\n*   **Product C (C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₃):** A product of a side-reaction between the starting material and acetic anhydride. It is a bicyclic N-acetylated piperidine dione derivative.\n\nThe precise drawings are:\n<<<\n**Product A:** A tricyclic system, methyl 8-acetyl-decahydro-1H-pyrrolo[1',2':3,4]imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-9-carboxylate.  \n ![](https://i.imgur.com/8Qj8E7J.png) \n\n**Product B:** A tricyclic dihydropyridone system.
