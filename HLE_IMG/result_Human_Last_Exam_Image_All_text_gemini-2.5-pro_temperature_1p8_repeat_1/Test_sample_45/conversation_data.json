    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling shown in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Concept of Rotational Symmetry**\nRotational symmetry describes how many times an object or pattern can be rotated around a central point (by an angle less than 360 degrees) and still look exactly the same. The \"order\" of rotational symmetry is the number of times it looks the same in one full 360-degree rotation. For periodic 2D tilings like this one, the crystallographic restriction theorem limits the possible orders of rotational symmetry to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Centers of Rotation**\nTo find the rotational symmetry, we need to locate points in the pattern that could serve as centers of rotation. We can look at the centers of the different tile shapes or the vertices where multiple tiles meet. The tiling is composed of dark blue hexagons, cream-colored squares and pentagons, and small orange rhombi.\n\n**Step 3: Test a Potential Center of Rotation (Center of a Hexagon)**\nLet's select the center of one of the prominent dark blue hexagons as a potential center for rotation.\n\n*   A single hexagon has 6 sides. Let's test for 6-fold rotational symmetry, which corresponds to a rotation of 360° / 6 = 60°.\n*   Observe the tiles immediately surrounding the blue hexagon. There is a ring of six cream-colored pentagons and six small orange rhombi.\n*   Imagine rotating the entire pattern by 60° around the center of the blue hexagon.\n    *   The central blue hexagon rotates onto itself.\n    *   Each cream pentagon moves to the exact position previously occupied by the next cream pentagon.\n    *   Each orange rhombus moves to the exact position previously occupied by the next orange rhombus.\n    *   Looking further out, we can see that all other shapes in the pattern (squares, other hexagons, etc.) also move to the positions of identical shapes.\n*   Since a 60° rotation leaves the entire pattern unchanged, it has at least 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Other Potential Centers (for confirmation)**\nWe can also check other points to see what symmetries they possess.\n\n*   **Center of a Square:** Pick one of the cream-colored squares. It is surrounded by four cream pentagons. Rotating the pattern by 360° / 4 = 90° around the center of the square also leaves the pattern unchanged. This means the tiling also has points of 4-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   **A Vertex:** Consider the point where two cream pentagons and one blue hexagon meet. Rotating the pattern by 360° / 3 = 120° around this point leaves the pattern unchanged. This shows the existence of 3-fold rotational centers.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Overall Rotational Symmetry**\nA tiling can have different points with different orders of rotation (e.g., points of 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold symmetry can coexist in the same pattern). When asked for \"the\" rotational symmetry of the entire tiling, it refers to the highest order of rotational symmetry found anywhere in the pattern.\n\nIn our analysis, we found centers of 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold rotation. The highest order is 6.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe tiling pattern has 6-fold rotational symmetry because it can be rotated by 60° (360°/6) about the center of any of the blue hexagonal tiles and remain identical to its original state.\n\n<<<6>>>"
