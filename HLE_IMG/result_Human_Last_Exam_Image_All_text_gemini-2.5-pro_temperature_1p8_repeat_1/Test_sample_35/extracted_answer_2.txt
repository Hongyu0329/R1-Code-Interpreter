The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the V-domain of the RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts) receptor.

S100B could be used as a prognostic marker. The diagram shows that the binding of S100B to RAGE activates signaling pathways (such as NF-κβ and JNK/JUN) that lead directly to the key pathological outcomes of neurological disorders, including neuroinflammation, apoptosis (neuronal cell death), and neurodegeneration. Therefore, the level of S100B expression would not only indicate the presence of the disease pathology but would also directly correlate with its severity and rate of progression. This ability to predict the future course and outcome of the disease is the definition of a prognostic marker, making it more than just an adjunct marker for diagnosis.
