The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is caused by the significant and fixed asymmetry of its münchnone intermediate. The intermediate, derived from N-acetylproline, has chemically distinct substituents at its reactive termini: a methyl group at the C2 position and a methine carbon as part of a fused ring at the C4 position. This inherent and permanent asymmetry creates a large energetic difference between the possible transition states for the cycloaddition, leading to the exclusive formation of one regioisomer, Product B.

Reactions 1 and 2 provide crucial evidence for this rationale. The isotopic labeling in Reaction 2 demonstrates that when the münchnone C2 and C4 substituents are identical (both methyl, from N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine), a rapid equilibration scrambles their positions, leading to a loss of regioselectivity with respect to the dipole. This shows that the termini become indistinguishable. By contrast, this scrambling is impossible in Reaction 3 due to the different nature of the substituents. Reaction 1 shows that the cycloaddition is inherently regioselective towards the alkyne. Therefore, the results from Reactions 1 and 2 prove that the high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 arises specifically because its structurally locked, asymmetric münchnone cannot equilibrate, forcing the inherently selective cycloaddition to proceed down a single pathway.
