    "*   **Step 1: Understand the question.**\n    The question asks to identify the crystal lattice pattern that corresponds to a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure when viewed along the [110] crystallographic direction.\n\n*   **Step 2: Recall the structure of a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice.**\n    An FCC lattice has atoms at the eight corners of a cube and at the center of each of the six faces. The positions of the atoms in a conventional unit cell (with lattice parameter 'a') can be given by fractional coordinates:\n    *   Corners: (0,0,0) and all permutations of (1,0,0) type corners.\n    *   Face Centers: (1/2, 1/2, 0), (1/2, 0, 1/2), (0, 1/2, 1/2) and their equivalents by symmetry.\n    In total, there are 4 atoms per conventional unit cell.\n\n*   **Step 3: Understand the concept of viewing a crystal along a specific direction.**\n    Viewing a 3D crystal lattice along a direction, like [110], means projecting all the atomic positions onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to this direction. The plane perpendicular to the [hkl] direction is the (hkl) plane. So, we are projecting the atoms onto the (110) plane.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the theoretical projection pattern for FCC along [110].**\n    1.  **Identify the repeating unit on the (110) plane:** The natural choice for a repeating unit on the (110) plane is a rectangle. The sides of this rectangle are parallel to the [001] and [1-10] directions, which are both perpendicular to the [110] viewing direction. The side lengths are 'a' (along [001]) and 'a√2' (along [1-10]).\n    2.  **Identify the atomic layers:** The atoms in an FCC crystal can be grouped into parallel planes of type (110). These planes stack in an A-B-A-B... sequence along the [110] direction.\n    3.  **Project the layers:**\n        *   The atoms in the 'A' planes project to form a rectangular grid. They will be at the corners of the rectangles described above.\n        *   The atoms in the 'B' planes, which are located halfway between the 'A' planes, will project to the exact center of the rectangles formed by the 'A' plane atoms.\n    4.  **Conclusion for the pattern:** The superposition of these projected layers results in a 2D pattern known as a **centered rectangle**. This pattern consists of a rectangular grid of atoms with an additional atom at the center of each rectangle.\n\n*   **Step 5: Analyze the given images to find the one matching the \"centered rectangle\" pattern.**\n    *   **Image A:** This image shows atoms arranged in a simple rectangular grid (two vertical columns). There are no atoms in the centers of the rectangles formed by any four adjacent atoms. This is not a centered rectangle.\n    *   **Image B:** This pattern appears somewhat hexagonal and less ordered than a simple grid. A hexagonal pattern is characteristic of an FCC crystal viewed along the [111] direction. This is not a centered rectangle.\n    *   **Image C:** The atoms in this image do not form a clear, repeating rectangular or centered-rectangular pattern. The arrangement seems more complex and does not fit the expected pattern.\n    *   **Image D:** This image clearly shows the centered rectangular pattern.\n        *   There is a primary rectangular grid formed by the atoms in the columns at x≈1 and x≈5. For example, atoms at (1,9), (5,9), (1,12), and (5,12) form a rectangle.\n        *   There is a second set of atoms (in the column at x≈3) located in the centers of the rectangles formed by the first set. For example, the center of the rectangle mentioned above is at x=(1+5)/2=3 and y=(9+12)/2=10.5. There is an atom at approximately (3, 11), which matches the position of a centering atom. This topological arrangement is precisely a centered rectangle.\n\n*   **Step 6: Final Answer.**\n    Based on the analysis, Image D is the only one that shows the characteristic centered rectangular projection of an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
