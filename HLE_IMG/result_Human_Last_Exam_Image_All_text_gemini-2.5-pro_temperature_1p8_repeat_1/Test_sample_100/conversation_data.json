    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the product.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    *   The starting material is a bicyclic lactam. The core structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one skeleton.\n    *   The nitrogen atom (N) is protected with a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group. The formula for a PMB group is C8H9O.\n    *   A trifluoromethyl (CF3) group is attached to one of the carbons of the double bond.\n    *   Let's determine the molecular formula of the starting material.\n        *   The core bicyclic lactam skeleton, without the PMB and CF3 substituents, is 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. This has the formula C6H5NO. (Carbons: C1,C3,C4,C5,C6,C7; Hydrogens: H on C1, C4, C5, C6, and 2H on C7).\n        *   We substitute one H on the double bond (let's say C6) with a CF3 group. The formula of this core becomes C6H4F3NO.\n        *   We replace the H on the nitrogen atom with the PMB group (C8H9O).\n        *   Total Carbons: 6 (core) + 8 (PMB) = 14 carbons.\n        *   Total Hydrogens: 4 (core) + 9 (PMB) = 13 hydrogens. Let's re-verify the H count on the core. C1(H), C4(H), C5(H), C7(H2). So that's 5 hydrogens. So total H is 5 + 9 = 14.\n        *   Total Fluorines: 3.\n        *   Total Nitrogens: 1.\n        *   Total Oxygens: 1 (from carbonyl) + 1 (from PMB) = 2.\n    *   The molecular formula of the starting material is C14H14F3NO2.\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Reaction to form Intermediate 1:**\n    *   The reagent is Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in acetonitrile/water (ACN/H2O).\n    *   CAN is a specific oxidizing agent used for the deprotection of electron-rich groups, particularly the p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group.\n    *   The reaction cleaves the bond between the nitrogen and the PMB group, replacing the PMB group with a hydrogen atom.\n    *   To find the formula of Intermediate 1, we subtract the atoms of the PMB group (C8H9O) from the starting material and add one hydrogen atom.\n    *   Formula of Intermediate 1 = (C14H14F3NO2) - (C8H9O) + H\n    *   C: 14 - 8 = 6\n    *   H: 14 - 9 + 1 = 6\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   So, the molecular formula of **Intermediate 1** is **C6H6F3NO**. This corresponds to the structure 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Reaction to form Intermediate 2:**\n    *   The reagents are Palladium on Carbon (Pd/C) and Hydrogen gas (H2) in methanol (MeOH).\n    *   This is a standard catalytic hydrogenation reaction. It reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) to a single bond (C-C).\n    *   The reaction adds two hydrogen atoms across the double bond of Intermediate 1.\n    *   To find the formula of Intermediate 2, we add H2 to the formula of Intermediate 1.\n    *   Formula of Intermediate 2 = C6H6F3NO + H2 = C6H(6+2)F3NO = **C6H8F3NO**.\n    *   The structure of **Intermediate 2** is 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one. The double bond has been saturated.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Third Reaction to form the Final Product:**\n    *   The reagents are 4 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 70 Â°C.\n    *   These are strong acidic and thermal conditions that cause the hydrolysis of the lactam (a cyclic amide).\n    *   During hydrolysis, a molecule of water (H2O) is consumed to break the amide bond (the N-C=O bond).\n    *   The C=O group is converted to a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the nitrogen atom is converted to an amino group (-NH2). Under the acidic conditions (HCl), the amino group will be protonated to form an ammonium salt (-NH3+ Cl-). However, the molecular formula is typically given for the neutral species unless otherwise specified.\n    *   The reaction opens the bicyclic ring system to form a substituted cyclopentane derivative which is an amino acid.\n    *   To find the molecular formula of the final product, we add the atoms of one water molecule (H2O) to the formula of Intermediate 2.\n    *   Formula of Product = C6H8F3NO + H2O\n    *   C: 6\n    *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   The molecular formula of the final product is **C6H10F3NO2**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Reagent Functionality:** It is crucial to correctly identify the function of each reagent. CAN for PMB deprotection, Pd/C and H2 for hydrogenation, and HCl/heat for amide hydrolysis.\n*   **Atom Conservation:** Keep careful track of the atoms added or removed in each step. A simple bookkeeping of C, H, N, O, F atoms prevents errors.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Recognize that hydrogenation saturates the double bond and hydrolysis breaks the amide bond by adding a water molecule.\n*   **Product Form:** The final product is formed under acidic conditions, so it exists as an ammonium salt in the reaction mixture. However, the molecular formula usually refers to the neutral form, which is an amino acid. The question asks for the molecular formula of the product, which is a neutral representation.\n*   **Structural Integrity:** Understand that the bicyclic core is maintained until the final hydrolysis step, where it opens up to form a monocyclic (cyclopentane) product. This structural transformation corresponds to the addition of H2O to the molecular formula.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation Summary:**\n*   Starting Material: C14H14F3NO2\n*   Step 1 (deprotection): - C8H9O, + H  -> Intermediate 1: C6H6F3NO\n*   Step 2 (hydrogenation): + H2 -> Intermediate 2: C6H8F3NO\n*   Step 3 (hydrolysis): + H2O -> Final Product: C6H10F3NO2\n\n<<<C6H10F3NO2>>>"
