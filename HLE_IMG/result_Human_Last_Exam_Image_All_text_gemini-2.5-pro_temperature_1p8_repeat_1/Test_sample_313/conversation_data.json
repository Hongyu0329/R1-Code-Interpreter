    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first part of the clue.**\n*   \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows an awards ceremony. The man on the right, receiving the trophy, is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov, a professional ice hockey player.\n*   A quick search confirms that the 2019 NHL Awards ceremony took place on June 19-20 in Las Vegas. On that night, Nikita Kucherov won the Hart Memorial Trophy (Most Valuable Player) and the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player voted by peers) for his performance in the 2018-2019 season. The date in the clue is precise.\n*   This establishes the context: a highly successful hockey player. A key achievement in hockey is the \"hat trick\" (scoring three goals in one game). Nikita Kucherov is famous for his offensive skill and scoring hat tricks.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second part of the clue.**\n*   \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This part of the clue refers to a historical fact. Mercury salts, specifically mercuric nitrate, were famously used in the 18th and 19th centuries in the process of \"carroting,\" which turned animal fur into felt for making high-quality hats.\n*   Workers in this industry, known as \"hatters,\" were chronically exposed to mercury vapor, which is a neurotoxin. This exposure led to a condition called erethism, characterized by tremors, slurred speech, confusion, and other neurological symptoms.\n*   This gave rise to the popular English expression \"mad as a hatter.\" The profession of a hatter using this toxic mercury-based process has indeed ceased.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the two clues to find \"X Y\".**\n*   The second clue strongly points to the term \"Hatter\" or, more specifically, \"Mad Hatter.\" \"X Y\" is a two-word phrase, which fits \"Mad Hatter\" perfectly.\n*   Now, we must connect \"Mad Hatter\" to the person in the image, Nikita Kucherov.\n    *   The **\"Hatter\"** part of the name is a pun on his connection to hockey's \"hat tricks.\" A player who scores one causes fans to throw hats on the ice.\n    *   The **\"Mad\"** part of the name is a figurative description of his incredible, almost \"insane\" or \"mad\" skill level during his 128-point season, which earned him the awards he is pictured receiving.\n*   Therefore, the puzzle presents two versions of a \"Mad Hatter\":\n    1.  The one pictured: Nikita Kucherov, a figurative \"Mad Hatter\" due to his \"mad\" skills and connection to \"hat tricks.\"\n    2.  The \"other\" one: The historical hatter, who was literally driven \"mad\" by mercury poisoning, a profession that has ceased to exist.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy combining the analysis of the image and date with the historical trivia about mercury, we can deduce that the answer is a term that fits both contexts through literal and figurative interpretation.\n\n<<<Mad Hatter>>>"
