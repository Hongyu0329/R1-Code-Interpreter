    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Algorithm's Logic\n\nLet's break down the function `sort(a, n)`:\n1.  **Base Case**: The recursion stops when `n` is 1 or less (`if n > 1:`). A single-element array is considered sorted by definition.\n2.  **First Recursive Call**: `sort(a, n - 1)` is called. The purpose of this call is to sort the first `n - 1` elements of the array, from index `0` to `n - 2`.\n3.  **Comparison and Swap**: It then compares the last element of the current subproblem (`a[n-1]`) with the element at `a[n-2]`. After the first recursive call, `a[n-2]` should be the largest element among the first `n-1` elements.\n    -   If `a[n-1]` is smaller than `a[n-2]`, it means they are out of order.\n    -   The `swap` operation is performed to place the larger of the two at index `n-1`.\n4.  **Second Recursive Call**: If the swap happened, the smaller element is now at `a[n-2]`, potentially disrupting the sorted order of the first `n-1` elements. To fix this, the algorithm calls `sort(a, n - 1)` again. This ensures the first `n-1` elements are re-sorted with the new element now at `a[n-2]`.\n\n### Step 2: Formulating the Recurrence Relation\n\nLet `T(n)` represent the time taken by the `sort` function for an input of size `n`.\n\n-   The work done inside the function, excluding the recursive calls, consists of a comparison and a potential swap. This takes constant time, which we can denote as `O(1)` or `c`.\n-   The first recursive call is `sort(a, n - 1)`, which takes `T(n - 1)` time.\n-   The second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` is conditional. To find the **worst-case** complexity, we must assume the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is always true, forcing this second call to execute every time. This call also takes `T(n - 1)` time.\n\nTherefore, the recurrence relation for the worst-case time complexity is:\n`T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + c`\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n\nThe base case is `T(1) = O(1)` (a constant amount of work).\n\n### Step 3: Solving the Recurrence Relation\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation using the substitution or expansion method.\n\n-   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n-   Substitute `T(n-1)`: `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n-   Substitute `T(n-2)`: `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n-   After `k` substitutions, a pattern emerges:\n    `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) + ... + 1)`\n\nThe sum `1 + 2 + ... + 2^(k-1)` is a geometric series which equals `(2^k - 1) / (2 - 1) = 2^k - 1`.\nSo, `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^k - 1)`\n\nThe recursion stops when it reaches the base case `T(1)`. This happens when `n - k = 1`, or `k = n - 1`. Substituting `k = n - 1`:\n\n-   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n-   Since `T(1)` is a constant, let's call it `d`.\n-   `T(n) = d * 2^(n-1) + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n-   `T(n) = (d + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\nThe dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`. In Big O notation, we ignore constants, so the complexity is `O(2^n)`.\n\n### Step 4: Identifying the Worst-Case Input\n\nThe worst-case scenario occurs when the `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` condition is true for every recursive step. An array sorted in reverse order (e.g., `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`) would trigger this behavior, causing the maximum number of swaps and recursive calls.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n1.  **Termination**: The algorithm always calls `sort` on a smaller problem size (`n-1`), eventually reaching the base case (`n <= 1`). Thus, the algorithm does terminate.\n2.  **Best Case**: If the input array is already sorted, the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` will always be false. The second recursive call is never made. The recurrence becomes `T(n) = T(n-1) + c`, which solves to `O(n)`.\n3.  **Worst Case**: As established, the worst case triggers both recursive calls, leading to the `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c` recurrence.\n4.  **Comparison to other algorithms**: This algorithm is extremely inefficient. Its structure leads to an exponential number of operations, much worse than common sorting algorithms like Merge Sort (`O(n log n)`) or even simple ones like Bubble Sort (`O(n^2)`). The structure with two recursive calls on size `n-1` is a classic indicator of `O(2^n)` complexity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe recurrence relation for the worst-case performance is `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + O(1)`, which resolves to an exponential time complexity of `O(2^n)`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
