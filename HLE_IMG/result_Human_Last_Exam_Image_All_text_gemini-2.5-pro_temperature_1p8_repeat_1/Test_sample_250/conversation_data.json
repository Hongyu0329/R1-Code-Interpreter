    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the jazz standard from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Key Signature and Time Signature**\n*   **Key Signature:** There are four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭) in the key signature. This indicates the key of A♭ major or its relative minor, F minor.\n*   **First Chord:** The first chord is labeled \"F-\", which signifies an F minor chord. This chord is the tonic (i) of the F minor scale, confirming that the piece is in the key of F minor.\n*   **Time Signature:** The \"C\" symbol represents common time, which is 4/4.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Melodic Contour of the Opening Phrase**\n*   **Measure 1 (over F- chord):** The melody consists of a C (the 5th of F) followed by an A♭ (the minor 3rd of F).\n*   **Measure 2 (over E-7b5 chord):** The melody consists of a B♭ (the flat 5th of E) followed by a G (the minor 3rd of E).\n*   This melodic pattern of playing the 5th down to the 3rd of the chord (or in the second measure, the b5 down to the 3rd) is a very distinctive opening theme.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Harmonic Progression**\n*   The first two bars feature a progression from `F-` (i minor) to `Eø7` (vii°7 of F minor, also written as E-7b5). This `i-` to `viiø7` movement is a characteristic progression in jazz harmony.\n*   The overall progression begins: `| F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7 | C7 ...`\n*   The combination of the opening melodic phrase and this initial chord progression is highly characteristic of a specific, well-known jazz standard.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Tune**\n*   The unique opening signature—both the melodic shape (`5th -> 3rd` and `b5th -> 3rd`) and the `i-` to `viiø7` harmony—is the iconic introduction to the jazz standard **\"Recorda Me\"**.\n*   While there are some variations in this specific chart compared to the original recording (for example, the chord in bar 3 is often Eb-7, and the progression in the bridge and later parts of the A section can differ in various fake books), the first two bars are the unmistakable musical fingerprint of this tune.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Composer**\n*   The jazz standard \"Recorda Me\" (which means \"Remember Me\" in Portuguese) was composed by the acclaimed tenor saxophonist and composer **Joe Henderson**. It was the opening track on his debut album, *Page One*, released in 1963.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis of the melody and harmony, especially the distinctive opening two measures, the sheet music is for the jazz standard \"Recorda Me\" composed by Joe Henderson.\n\n<<<Title: Recorda Me, Composer: Joe Henderson>>>"
