*   **Product A (C14H20N2O3)** is the result of a multi-step sequence starting with the N-acylation of the starting material to form intermediate **C**. This intermediate then forms a münchnone 1,3-dipole via dehydration with acetic anhydride. The münchnone undergoes a [3+2] cycloaddition with methyl propiolate, followed by the extrusion of CO2 to give a primary product (C14H18N2O2). Product A is the final isolated compound formed by the hydration of the imine group of this primary product during workup.
*   **Product B (C12H14N2O3)** is formed through an alternative pathway where the starting material first forms an azomethine ylide 1,3-dipole via decarboxylative condensation (loss of CO2 and H2O). This ylide then undergoes a [3+2] cycloaddition with methyl propiolate to give a primary cycloadduct (C12H16N2O2). Product B is the result of the oxidation of this primary cycloadduct (e.g., formation of a lactam, C-H2 -> C=O), which accounts for the loss of two hydrogens and gain of one oxygen.
*   **Product C (C11H16N2O3)** is the simplest product, resulting from the direct N-acylation of the secondary amine in the proline ring of the starting material by acetic anhydride.
