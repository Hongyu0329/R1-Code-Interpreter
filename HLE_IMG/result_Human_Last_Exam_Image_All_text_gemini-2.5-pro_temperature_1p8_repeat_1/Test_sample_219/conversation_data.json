    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval from the provided graph.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Raster Plot**\nThe image provided is a raster plot, which displays the firing activity of multiple neurons over time.\n*   The **horizontal axis (x-axis)** represents **Time** in seconds (s). It ranges from 0 to 50 seconds.\n*   The **vertical axis (y-axis)** represents the **Electrode Number**, from 0 to 128. Each horizontal line corresponds to the recordings from a single electrode.\n*   Each **black dot** represents a spike, or an action potential, fired by a neuron at a specific electrode at a specific time.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts**\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a period where a large number of neurons fire in a short amount of time. In the raster plot, these events appear as dense vertical bands of black dots, indicating that many electrodes detected spikes at roughly the same time.\n\nBy visually inspecting the plot, we can identify these vertical bands. We will estimate the time at the center of each burst.\n\n*   **Burst 1:** The first distinct burst occurs early in the recording. Its center is approximately at **t₁ = 2 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** A very dense and clear burst is visible after the 10-second mark. Its center is approximately at **t₂ = 13 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** Following the second burst, there is another synchronized event, though less dense. Its center is approximately at **t₃ = 18 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** Another similar burst occurs shortly after the third one. Its center is approximately at **t₄ = 23 s**.\n*   **Burst 5:** A very prominent burst is centered around **t₅ = 35 s**.\n*   **Burst 6:** The last major burst is near the end of the recording, centered around **t₆ = 47 s**.\n\nThe timestamps of the synchronized bursts are: {2, 13, 18, 23, 35, 47} seconds.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between consecutive bursts. We have 6 bursts, so there are 5 intervals to calculate.\n\n*   **IBI₁ (between Burst 1 and 2):** 13 s - 2 s = 11 s\n*   **IBI₂ (between Burst 2 and 3):** 18 s - 13 s = 5 s\n*   **IBI₃ (between Burst 3 and 4):** 23 s - 18 s = 5 s\n*   **IBI₄ (between Burst 4 and 5):** 35 s - 23 s = 12 s\n*   **IBI₅ (between Burst 5 and 6):** 47 s - 35 s = 12 s\n\nThe list of inter-burst intervals is {11, 5, 5, 12, 12} seconds.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual IBIs and divide by the number of intervals.\n\n*   **Sum of IBIs:** 11 + 5 + 5 + 12 + 12 = 45 s\n*   **Number of intervals:** 5\n*   **Average IBI:** 45 s / 5 = 9.0 s\n\n**Step 5: Apply Significant Figures Requirement**\nThe question asks for the answer to be given to two significant figures. Our result, 9.0 s, correctly has two significant figures.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The identification of the exact center of a burst is based on visual estimation and can have minor variations. However, the calculated average is robust to small changes in these estimations.\n*   It's important to identify all distinct synchronous events. The bursts at 18 s and 23 s are less prominent than the others but are clearly separated and synchronized events that should be included in the calculation for an accurate representation of the network's firing rhythm.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe timestamps of the synchronized bursts are approximately 2 s, 13 s, 18 s, 23 s, 35 s, and 47 s.\nThe average inter-burst interval is 9.0 s.\n\n<<<9.0>>>"
