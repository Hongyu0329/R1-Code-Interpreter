    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the textual description:**\n    *   The prompt describes an **illusion**. This means that what is perceived is different from the physical reality of the stimulus.\n    *   It is compared to the **Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity**. The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where the brain interprets a 2D drawing in one of two possible 3D configurations, and perception can flip between them. This comparison suggests the phenomenon involves the brain actively interpreting incomplete or ambiguous sensory information to construct a coherent perception.\n    *   It reveals a **\"common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability.\"** This implies it's a fundamental process of our perceptual system that happens automatically to make sense of the world.\n\n2.  **Analyze the visual elements (the graphs):**\n    *   The image consists of two plots representing a sound. The horizontal axis in both plots represents time.\n    *   **Top plot (Spectrogram):** This graph shows the frequency content of the sound over time. There is a single, narrow horizontal band, which represents a pure tone of a constant frequency. Crucially, this band is **interrupted** in the middle. In place of the interruption, there is a vertical smear, representing a burst of sound containing a wide range of frequencies (i.e., noise, like static or a cough). This plot shows the *physical reality* of the sound: a tone, followed by noise, followed by the same tone again. The tone is physically absent during the noise burst.\n    *   **Bottom plot (Waveform):** This graph shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time. It starts as a regular, periodic sine wave (the pure tone), then transitions into a complex, non-periodic signal (the noise), and then returns to being a regular sine wave. This visually represents the same sequence of events as the spectrogram.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the information to identify the illusion:**\n    *   The physical stimulus is a discontinuous tone interrupted by noise.\n    *   The \"illusion\" described is what a human listener perceives. When presented with this stimulus, a person typically does not hear a tone that stops and then starts again. Instead, they perceive the tone as **continuing without interruption**, sounding as if it is \"behind\" the burst of noise.\n    *   The brain fills in the missing portion of the tone, assuming that the more plausible event is a continuous sound being temporarily masked by a louder one, rather than a sound source coincidentally stopping just as another starts and then restarting just as the second one stops.\n\n4.  **Name the phenomenon:**\n    *   This mental \"filling-in\" of missing auditory information that has been occluded by other sounds is a well-documented psychoacoustic effect.\n    *   When applied to speech sounds (e.g., hearing a complete word even when a phoneme is replaced by a cough), it is called the **phonemic restoration effect**.\n    *   More generally, as is the case here with a non-speech tone, the phenomenon is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion** or sometimes simply **Perceptual Restoration** (in an auditory context). The most precise and common name for this specific demonstration is the Auditory Continuity Illusion.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Physical Stimulus vs. Perceptual Experience:** The key to understanding this illusion is differentiating between the physical sound waves (as shown in the spectrogram) and the subjective experience of the listener. The tone is physically absent, but perceptually present.\n*   **Plausibility of the \"Occluder\":** The illusion is strongest when the interrupting sound (the noise) is a plausible masker for the original sound. It needs to be sufficiently loud and spectrally rich to have hypothetically drowned out the tone.\n*   **Top-Down Processing:** This illusion is a classic example of top-down processing, where the brain uses context, experience, and expectations to interpret sensory input, rather than just passively receiving bottom-up data. The brain's \"knowledge\" that sounds persist and are often occluded leads it to construct a continuous perception.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis confirms that the image and description pertain to the illusion where a sound interrupted by noise is perceived as continuous. The most specific and recognized name for this phenomenon is the Auditory Continuity Illusion.\n\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion"
