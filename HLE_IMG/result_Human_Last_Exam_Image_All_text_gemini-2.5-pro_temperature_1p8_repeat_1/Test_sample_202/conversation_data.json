    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\nThe task is to identify the four rock specimens labeled H, I, J, and K based on their visual characteristics. We will analyze each specimen by observing its texture, color, and overall structure, which are key indicators of its origin and classification (igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic).\n\n**Specimen H:**\n1.  **Observation:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a highly porous, spongy texture. It is covered in small holes or cavities called vesicles.\n2.  **Analysis:** The vesicles are formed by gas bubbles escaping from lava as it cooled. This indicates the rock is extrusive (volcanic). The reddish color is often due to the oxidation of iron. Rocks with this appearance are known as scoria. Scoria is less dense than solid rock but typically sinks in water, unlike pumice.\n3.  **Identification:** Scoria.\n\n**Specimen J:**\n1.  **Observation:** This specimen is light-colored (white to light gray) and, like specimen H, is very porous and filled with vesicles. It appears very lightweight.\n2.  **Analysis:** The highly vesicular texture indicates a rapid, frothy volcanic eruption. The light color suggests a felsic composition, meaning it is rich in silica. This combination of characteristics is the definition of pumice. Pumice is so low in density due to its high porosity that it can often float on water.\n3.  **Identification:** Pumice.\n\n**Specimen I:**\n1.  **Observation:** This rock is composed of various smaller rock fragments (clasts) and mineral grains cemented together in a fine-grained, light-gray matrix. The fragments are of different colors and sizes and appear somewhat angular.\n2.  **Analysis:** This fragmental (clastic) texture is characteristic of either a sedimentary rock (like breccia or conglomerate) or a pyroclastic igneous rock. Since the clasts appear to be of volcanic origin (angular rock fragments in a fine ash-like matrix), this is a pyroclastic rock. A rock formed from consolidated volcanic ash and larger fragments is called a tuff or a volcanic breccia. Tuff is the more general and common term.\n3.  **Identification:** Tuff (or Volcanic Breccia).\n\n**Specimen K:**\n1.  **Observation:** This rock is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. The crystals have different colors, including white/light gray, pinkish, and dark greenish-black. The rock has a coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture.\n2.  **Analysis:** The large, interlocking crystals indicate that the rock cooled very slowly, deep beneath the Earth's surface. This identifies it as an intrusive (plutonic) igneous rock. The mix of light-colored minerals (likely feldspar and quartz) and dark minerals (like hornblende or biotite mica) is characteristic of granite. The exceptionally large size of the crystals suggests it could be a pegmatite, which is a very coarse-grained igneous rock, often of granitic composition.\n3.  **Identification:** Granite (specifically, a Granite Pegmatite).\n\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Tuff\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Granite\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Tuff, J: Pumice, K: Granite>>>"
