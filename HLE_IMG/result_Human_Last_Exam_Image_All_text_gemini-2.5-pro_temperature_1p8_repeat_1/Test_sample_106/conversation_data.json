    "This problem describes an acid-catalyzed dehydration of a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol, which leads to a complex rearrangement known as a backbone rearrangement. Our goal is to determine the final substituents (either H or CH3) at five specific positions labeled in the product.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Reaction Initiation:** The reaction starts with the protonation of the hydroxyl (-OH) group on the starting material by the catalytic acid (HCl). The protonated hydroxyl group (-OH2+) is an excellent leaving group and departs as a water molecule. This leaves behind a secondary carbocation at carbon 3 (C3).\n\n2.  **Carbocation Rearrangement:** The secondary carbocation at C3 is unstable and will rearrange to form more stable carbocations, typically tertiary ones. This occurs through a series of [1,2]-shifts of adjacent hydride (H:-) or methide (CH3:-) groups. The question states that a number of [1,2] shifts are involved. We must trace the movement of the positive charge and the migrating groups to determine the final structure.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Product Structure for Clues:**\n    *   **The gem-dimethyl group:** A crucial observation from the product's structure is that the carbon at position 1's location (C4) still has two methyl groups (\"H3C\" and \"CH3\" are explicitly drawn). In the starting material, C4 is a quaternary carbon with two methyl groups. If the rearrangement started with the typical [1,2]-methyl shift from C4 to C3, C4 would end up with only one methyl group and a hydrogen that would migrate in a subsequent step. The fact that the gem-dimethyl group at C4 is intact in the product strongly suggests that it was not involved in the initial rearrangement step.\n    *   **The Double Bond:** The final product has a double bond between what corresponds to the C8 and C9 positions in the triterpene skeleton. An alkene is formed by deprotonation of a carbon atom adjacent to a carbocation. Therefore, the rearrangement cascade must have ended with the positive charge at either C8 or C9.\n\n4.  **Proposing a Plausible Mechanism:**\n    *   Given that C4 is untouched, the initial C3 carbocation must be stabilized by a migration from a different neighbor. A [1,2]-hydride shift from C2 would lead to another secondary carbocation, which is not favorable. A plausible, though less common, alternative is a **[1,3]-hydride shift** from C5 to C3. In the rigid polycyclic framework, C3 and C5 are spatially close enough for this to occur. This bypasses C4 completely, leaving its gem-dimethyl group unchanged.\n    *   **Shift 1:** A hydride (H:-) shifts from C5 to C3. This resolves the C3 carbocation and creates a new, more stable tertiary carbocation at C5.\n    *   **Shift 2:** The C5 carbocation is adjacent to C10, which bears a methyl group. A [1,2]-methyl shift from C10 to C5 occurs. The positive charge moves to C10 (tertiary carbocation).\n    *   **Shift 3:** The C10 carbocation is adjacent to C9, which bears a hydrogen atom. A [1,2]-hydride shift from C9 to C10 takes place. The positive charge now resides at C9 (tertiary carbocation).\n    *   **Termination (Elimination):** The rearrangement cascade stops here. The carbocation at C9 is adjacent to C8, which has a hydrogen. A base (like H2O or Cl-) removes this proton from C8, forming the final, stable C8=C9 double bond.\n\n5.  **Determining the Substituents at the Numbered Positions:** Now we can track what substituent is at each labeled position in the final product.\n\n    *   **Position 1 (at C4):** This carbon was not involved in the rearrangement. It started with two methyl groups and ends with two methyl groups. Thus, the substituent is **CH3**.\n    *   **Position 3 (at C5):** This carbon started with a hydrogen atom, which migrated to C3 in the first shift. Then, a methyl group from C10 migrated to C5. Therefore, the final substituent at C5 is **CH3**.\n    *   **Position 2 (at C10):** This carbon started with a methyl group, which migrated to C5. Then, a hydrogen atom from C9 migrated to C10. Therefore, the final substituent at C10 is **H**.\n    *   **Position 4 (at C14):** The rearrangement cascade terminated at C9. The carbons further down the backbone, including C14, were not affected. C14 started with a methyl group and retains it. The substituent is **CH3**.\n    *   **Position 5 (at C13):** Similar to C14, C13 was not involved in the rearrangement. It started with a hydrogen atom and retains it. The substituent is **H**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   Position 1 is a methyl group (CH3).\n*   Position 2 is a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   Position 3 is a methyl group (CH3).\n*   Position 4 is a methyl group (CH3).\n*   Position 5 is a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nFinal answer in the requested format:\n1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
