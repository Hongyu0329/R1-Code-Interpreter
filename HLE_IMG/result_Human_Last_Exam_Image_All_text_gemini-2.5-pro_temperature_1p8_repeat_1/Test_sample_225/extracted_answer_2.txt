The product A is the tris(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)methylium ion. The reaction is the complete acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the six methoxy ether groups to hydroxyl groups under the harsh conditions (refluxing in HCl for 12 hours).

The final structure is a central carbon atom with a positive charge (C+) bonded to three 2,3-dihydroxyphenyl groups.
