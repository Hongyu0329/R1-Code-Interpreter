def solve_heesch_number():
    """
    This function determines the Heesch number for the polygons in the image.

    Step-by-step thinking:
    1.  The image displays three identical purple polygons on a triangular grid. We need to find the Heesch number for each.
    2.  Let's analyze the shape of a single polygon. It is a non-convex dodecagon (a 12-sided polygon). Its boundary is modified from a basic hexagon.
        - The top edge has a protrusion. Its opposite (bottom) edge has a matching notch.
        - The top-right edge has a protrusion. Its opposite (bottom-left) edge has a matching notch.
        - The top-left edge is straight. Its opposite (bottom-right) edge is also straight.
    3.  This pattern of "opposite sides matching" (where a protrusion is the "match" for a notch) indicates that the polygon has 180-degree rotational symmetry, also known as central symmetry.
    4.  A key theorem in geometry states that any centrally symmetric polygon can tile the plane. Such a shape can be translated and rotated to cover the entire plane without gaps or overlaps.
    5.  The Heesch number is the maximum number of layers of copies of a shape that can surround it. If a shape tiles the plane, it can be surrounded by an infinite number of layers. By definition, its Heesch number is infinity.
    6.  Since all three polygons in the figure are identical, they all have the same properties and thus the same Heesch number.
    7.  Therefore, the Heesch number for each of the three polygons is infinity.
