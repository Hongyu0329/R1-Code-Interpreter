    print("   - Image A: Shows a 'simple rectangular' pattern. The atoms form a simple grid without any atoms in the center of the rectangles. This is incorrect.")
    print("   - Image C: Shows a pattern with clear hexagonal symmetry. This corresponds to the FCC [111] projection, not [110].")
    print("   - Image D: Shows a pattern on a square grid with atoms at the corners, the middle of each edge, and the center of the square. This is the known pattern for an FCC [100] projection.")
    print("   - Image B: Shows atoms forming a shape consistent with a 'centered rectangle'. Despite the perspective drawing, we can identify a quadrilateral defined by four atoms with a fifth atom in its center. This matches the theoretical pattern for the FCC [110] view.")

    print("   Based on eliminating the other options and matching the theoretical pattern, Image B represents the FCC structure viewed along the [110] direction.")
