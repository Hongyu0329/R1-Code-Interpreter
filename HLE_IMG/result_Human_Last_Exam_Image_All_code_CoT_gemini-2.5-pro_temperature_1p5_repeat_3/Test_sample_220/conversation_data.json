    "To determine which pattern represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction, we can analyze the expected projection pattern and compare it with the given images.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the FCC structure:** Recall the positions of atoms in an FCC lattice.\n2.  **Determine the theoretical projection:** Calculate or determine from known crystallographic principles what the 2D projection of an FCC lattice looks like when viewed down the [110] axis. The result is a **centered rectangular pattern**. The sides of this rectangle are aligned with the `[001]` and `[1,-1,0]` directions in the crystal, and their length ratio is `sqrt(2):1`.\n3.  **Analyze the given images:**\n    *   **Image A:** Shows a simple rectangular grid of atoms. This is not a centered pattern.\n    *   **Image D:** Shows a square grid with atoms at the corners, the center of each edge, and the center of the square itself. This is the characteristic projection of an FCC lattice viewed along the **[100]** direction.\n    *   **Image C:** Shows a pattern with hexagonal symmetry. This is characteristic of an FCC lattice viewed along the **[111]** direction.\n    *   **Image B:** Shows atoms arranged at the corners of a quadrilateral (representing a rectangle in perspective) with another atom in the center. This arrangement is consistent with the **centered rectangular** pattern expected for the [110] view.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, Image B is the correct representation.\n\nThe following Python code will print this step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crystallography_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning for identifying the correct crystal lattice pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analysis of the Crystal Lattice Patterns:\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------\")\n    \n    print(\"1. The Target Structure: We are looking for the projection of a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice when viewed along the [110] direction.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n2. Theoretical Projection Pattern for FCC [110]:\")\n    print(\"   - When an FCC crystal is viewed along its [110] axis, the atoms project onto a 2D plane forming a 'centered rectangular' lattice.\")\n    print(\"   - This means the repeating unit cell in the projection is a rectangle with atoms at its four corners and one atom in the geometric center.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n3. Analyzing the Given Images:\")\n    print(\"   - Image A: Shows a 'simple rectangular' pattern. The atoms form a simple grid without any atoms in the center of the rectangles. This is incorrect.\")\n    print(\"   - Image C: Shows a pattern with clear hexagonal symmetry. This corresponds to the FCC [111] projection, not [110].\")\n    print(\"   - Image D: Shows a pattern on a square grid with atoms at the corners, the middle of each edge, and the center of the square. This is the known pattern for an FCC [100] projection.\")\n    print(\"   - Image B: Shows atoms forming a shape consistent with a 'centered rectangle'. Despite the perspective drawing, we can identify a quadrilateral defined by four atoms with a fifth atom in its center. This matches the theoretical pattern for the FCC [110] view.\")\n          \n    print(\"\\n4. Conclusion:\")\n    print(\"   Based on eliminating the other options and matching the theoretical pattern, Image B represents the FCC structure viewed along the [110] direction.\")\n\nsolve_crystallography_problem()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
