    "This is an interesting and challenging image. Based on the unique, honeycomb-like pattern of hexagonal plates on its skin, I can identify the animal. This pattern is characteristic of a specific family of fish.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the family of the animal based on the distinctive hexagonal scale-like plates which form a rigid carapace or shell. This pattern is a key feature of boxfishes.\n2.  Attempt to narrow down the species. The coloration and specific pattern of spots within the hexagonal grid are reminiscent of the adult form of the Yellow Boxfish.\n3.  Provide the scientific name for this species.\n4.  Write a simple Python script to print the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef identify_animal():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the animal in the image and prints its scientific name.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The image shows a close-up of a fish with a unique honeycomb-like pattern.\n  # This rigid, bony carapace is characteristic of the Boxfish family (Ostraciidae).\n  # The specific pattern of dark outlines with lighter, sometimes spotted, centers\n  # strongly suggests it is an adult Yellow Boxfish.\n  common_name = \"Yellow Boxfish\"\n  scientific_name = \"Ostracion cubicus\"\n\n  print(f\"Yes, there is an animal in the image. It appears to be a type of boxfish.\")\n  print(f\"Its scientific name is: {scientific_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n  # The script will be executed directly.\n  # No external arguments are needed for this task.\n  identify_animal()\n\n```\n<<<Ostracion cubicus>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Is there an animal in this image?
