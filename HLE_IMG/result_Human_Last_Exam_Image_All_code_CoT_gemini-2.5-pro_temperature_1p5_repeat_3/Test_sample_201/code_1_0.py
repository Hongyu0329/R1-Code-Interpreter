    This function analyzes the plate tectonic map to determine the location of the longest mountain range.

    1.  Principle: The tallest and longest mountain ranges are formed at convergent plate boundaries,
        where two plates collide.
    2.  Map Legend:
        - Red lines with inward arrows (▶◀) represent convergent boundaries (mountain building).
        - Blue lines with outward arrows (◀▶) represent divergent boundaries (rifting).
        - Green lines with sliding arrows (→ ←) represent transform boundaries (earthquakes).
    3.  Goal: Find the longest continuous red line that corresponds to one of the answer choices.
    4.  Analysis of Choices:
        - A. Kihei Plate and South Avalonia Plate: A long, continuous red line. Strong candidate.
        - B. South Avalonia Plate and South Kesh Plate: No direct boundary.
        - C. North Tethys Plate and South Tethys Plate: No direct boundary.
        - D. South Kesh Plate and Eurybian Plate: A short red line.
        - E. Brigantic Plate and Boreal Plate: A short red line.
        - F. Central Iapetus Plate and Artemian Plate: Mixed boundary, short convergent section.
        - G. Artemian Plate and Eurybian Plate: Mostly divergent and transform.
        - H. Goidelic Plate and Central Iapetus Plate: Divergent (blue line).
        - I. North Tethys Plate and Brigantic Plate: A long red line, but visually shorter than A.
    5.  Conclusion: The boundary between the Kihei Plate and the South Avalonia Plate (A) is the longest
        convergent boundary among the choices.

    answer = "A"
    explanation = "The tallest and longest mountain ranges form at convergent plate boundaries, indicated by the red lines with arrows pointing towards each other. Comparing the lengths of the convergent boundaries listed in the options, the boundary between the Kihei Plate and the South Avalonia Plate is the most extensive continuous one."
