    # Step 1: Analyze the reaction
    print("1. The Reaction:")
    print("   - The reaction involves an aromatic cation (Pr-DAOTA) with concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4).")
    print("   - These are conditions for electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically sulfonation, where a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H) is added to an aromatic ring.")
    print("   - The starting molecule is symmetrical. The most activated positions for electrophilic attack are para to the central oxygen atom.")
    print("   - The reaction likely results in a symmetrical disulfonation, with one -SO3H group added to each of the two outer benzene-like rings.")
    print("   - The addition of two polar -SO3H groups makes the product (Compound 1) water-soluble, which matches the problem description.\n")

    # Step 2: Analyze the 1H NMR of the product
    print("2. 1H NMR Analysis of Compound 1:")
    print("   - We need to find the most deshielded proton. Deshielding is caused by proximity to electron-withdrawing groups or location in an electron-deficient aromatic ring.")
    print("   - Compound 1 has several aromatic protons. The protons on the central pyridine-like ring are expected to be the most deshielded because this ring is part of a positively charged system and is flanked by two electronegative nitrogen atoms.")
    print("   - The proton in the very middle of this central ring is the most electron-poor proton in the entire molecule, and thus the most deshielded.\n")

    # Step 3: Determine the splitting pattern and integration
    print("3. Splitting Pattern and Integration of the Most Deshielded Proton:")
    print("   - Splitting Pattern: This most deshielded proton has two adjacent protons, one on each side.")
    print("     - Due to the molecule's symmetry, these two neighboring protons are chemically equivalent.")
    print("     - According to the n+1 rule (where n is the number of equivalent neighbors), the signal will be split into n+1 = 2+1 = 3 peaks.")
    print("     - Therefore, the splitting pattern is a triplet.")
    print("   - Integration: The integration of an NMR signal corresponds to the number of protons it represents.")
    print("     - There is only one proton in this specific chemical environment in the molecule.")
    print("     - Therefore, the signal will integrate to 1H.\n")
    
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The highest deshielded proton peak shows a splitting pattern of a triplet and an integration of 1H.")
