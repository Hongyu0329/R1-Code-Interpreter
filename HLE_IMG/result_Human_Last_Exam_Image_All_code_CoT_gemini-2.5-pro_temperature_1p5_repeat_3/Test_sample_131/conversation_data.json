    "This is a chemical identification task. My plan is to:\n1.  Analyze the chemical structure provided in the image.\n2.  Identify its key features, such as the ring system, functional groups, and stereochemistry.\n3.  The structure is a tetracyclic system containing two nitrogen atoms and one ketone group. This skeleton is characteristic of Lycopodium alkaloids.\n4.  By comparing it with known structures, I can identify the specific compound. This particular arrangement of atoms and stereocenters corresponds to the alkaloid lycopodine.\n5.  I will then write a simple Python script to print out the name of the compound as requested.\n\n```python\ndef identify_alkaloid():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the alkaloid from the provided image.\n    The structure shown is that of Lycopodine, a prominent member of the Lycopodium alkaloids.\n    \"\"\"\n    compound_name = \"Lycopodine\"\n    print(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    identify_alkaloid()\n```\n<<<Lycopodine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
