        "This is because its level of expression directly correlates with the severity of the disease's progression. "
        "As shown in the pathway, the binding of S100B to RAGE activates downstream signaling cascades, including JNK/JUN and NFκβ. "
        "These activations lead to critical pathological outcomes such as apoptosis (cell death), the production of proinflammatory cytokines, neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. "
        "Since higher levels of S100B would trigger these damaging events more strongly, its measurement provides predictive information about the future course and severity of the neurological disorder, which is the definition of a prognostic marker."
