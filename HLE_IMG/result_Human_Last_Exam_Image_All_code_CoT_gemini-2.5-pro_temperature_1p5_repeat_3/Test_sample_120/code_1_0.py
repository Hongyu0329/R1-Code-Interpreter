    The question asks what the addition of a methyl group implies about the relaxation dynamics. The methyl group is added to Ring 1 of the N1 molecule to form the M1 molecule. We must compare the relaxation time (⟨τ⟩) for Ring 1 in both plots.

    - In the N1 plot (left), at a temperature of 350 K, the value of ⟨τ⟩ for Ring 1 (blue diamond) is approximately 25 ns.
    - In the M1 plot (right), at the same temperature of 350 K, the value of ⟨τ⟩ for Ring 1 (blue diamond) is significantly higher, at approximately 150 ns.

    A higher relaxation time indicates slower molecular motion. Therefore, the data shows that the addition of a methyl group increases the relaxation time of the methylated ring. This eliminates options A, C, and E.

    analysis_part2 = """
    The question asks whether the T_NI will increase or decrease. The nematic liquid crystal phase is stabilized by favorable intermolecular interactions that promote long-range orientational alignment.

    - The added methyl group is a lateral substituent; it protrudes from the side of the main molecular axis.
    - This creates steric bulk, which hinders the molecules from packing together closely and efficiently.
    - This disruption weakens the overall intermolecular forces that stabilize the ordered nematic phase.
    - Consequently, less thermal energy (a lower temperature) is needed to overcome these forces and transition to the disordered isotropic phase.

    Therefore, the addition of a methyl group is expected to disrupt the liquid crystalline ordering and lead to a lower nematic-isotropic transition temperature. This conclusion rules out option B.
