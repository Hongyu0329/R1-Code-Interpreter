    "This problem requires identifying the biological sexes of insects in three pairs, labeled A, B, and C. The key is to look for common sexual dimorphism in Hymenoptera (bees and wasps).\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Pair A (Cuckoo Bees, likely *Triepeolus*):**\n    *   The insect on the left has longer, thicker antennae and a more slender abdomen. In many bee species, males have longer antennae (13 segments) than females (12 segments). This is likely a male.\n    *   The insect on the right has shorter antennae and a broader abdomen with a more pointed tip, which is characteristic of a female's abdomen containing an ovipositor (or stinger). This is likely a female.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n2.  **Pair B (Paper Wasps, likely *Polistes*):**\n    *   The insect on the right shows a very clear characteristic of a male paper wasp: the tips of its antennae are distinctly curled or hooked. Also, males often have more yellow on their faces.\n    *   The insect on the left has straight antennae and a more pointed abdomen, typical of a female with a stinger.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Female, Male (F, M). This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n3.  **Pair C (Long-horned Bees, likely *Melissodes* or similar):**\n    *   This pair shows extreme sexual dimorphism in antennae length, which is characteristic of this group.\n    *   The insect on the left has extremely long antennae that curve back over its body, a classic feature of a male long-horned bee.\n    *   The insect on the right has much shorter, standard bee-like antennae, which is characteristic of a female. Although the prompt mentions taxa without scopae, the primary and most obvious distinguishing feature here is the antennae.\n    *   **Conclusion for C:** Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   A: M, F -> 3\n*   B: F, M -> 4\n*   C: M, F -> 3\n\nThe final answer string is \"3, 4, 3\".\n\n```python\n# The reasoning for identifying the sexes of the insects is as follows:\n# Pair A: The left bee is male (longer antennae), and the right bee is female (shorter antennae, pointed abdomen). This is option 3.\n# Pair B: The left wasp is female (straight antennae), and the right wasp is male (curled antennae tips). This is option 4.\n# Pair C: The left bee is male (extremely long antennae), and the right bee is female (short antennae). This is option 3.\n\n# Assigning the index for each pair\nindex_A = 3\nindex_B = 4\nindex_C = 3\n\n# Printing the final answer in the required format\nprint(f\"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}\")\n```"
