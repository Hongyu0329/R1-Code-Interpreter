# The reasoning for identifying the sexes of the insects is as follows:
# Pair A: The left bee is male (longer antennae), and the right bee is female (shorter antennae, pointed abdomen). This is option 3.
# Pair B: The left wasp is female (straight antennae), and the right wasp is male (curled antennae tips). This is option 4.
# Pair C: The left bee is male (extremely long antennae), and the right bee is female (short antennae). This is option 3.

# Assigning the index for each pair
index_A = 3
index_B = 4
index_C = 3

# Printing the final answer in the required format
print(f"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}")
