    This function identifies the matching nyala based on unique physical characteristics.
    
    Analysis:
    1.  Observe the target nyala, focusing on unique patterns like the stripes and spots on its flank, as well as the shape of its horns.
    2.  The target has a very specific cluster of white spots on its lower rear flank.
    3.  Compare this unique spot pattern with the nyalas in options A through F.
    4.  Option B is the only image that displays an identical spot pattern, along with a consistent horn shape and stripe pattern.
    
    Therefore, B is the correct match.
