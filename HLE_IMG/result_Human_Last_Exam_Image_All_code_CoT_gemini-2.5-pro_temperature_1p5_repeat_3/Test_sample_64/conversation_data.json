    "Based on the visual evidence in the series of images (L, M, N), the process being depicted is plasmolysis in a filamentous organism, likely an alga or a fungus.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of what is happening in the images:\n\n1.  **Image L:** This image shows the initial state. The filament consists of turgid, rectangular cells arranged end-to-end. The cell walls are straight, and the filament is rigid. This is the normal, healthy state of the cells in an isotonic or hypotonic environment, where high internal turgor pressure keeps the cells firm.\n2.  **Image M:** The organism has likely been placed in a hypertonic solution (a solution with a higher solute concentration than the cell's interior). Due to osmosis, water has begun to move out of the cells. The arrowhead points to a septum (the cross-wall between two cells) where the protoplast (the cell membrane and its contents) has started to pull away from the cell wall. This loss of water causes a decrease in turgor pressure, and the cell begins to lose its rigidity, resulting in a slight bulge and bend.\n3.  **Image N:** Plasmolysis is more advanced. More water has left the cells, and the protoplast has retracted further from the cell wall, especially at the septa, causing a pronounced bulge. The loss of turgor is significant, leading to the filament becoming flaccid and bending more sharply at the weakened point.\n\nIn summary, the sequence shows the progressive loss of water from the cells, the retraction of the cell contents from the cell wall, and the resulting loss of structural integrity, all of which are characteristic stages of plasmolysis.\n\n<<<Plasmolysis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
