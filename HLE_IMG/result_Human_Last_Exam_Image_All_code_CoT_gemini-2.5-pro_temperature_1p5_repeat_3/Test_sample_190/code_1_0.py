# This problem is a conceptual question about machine learning strategy.
# It asks for the best approach to solve a problem, not a numerical calculation.
# Therefore, no code is needed to solve for a numerical answer.
# The analysis below explains the reasoning for the chosen answer.

    print("Problem Analysis:")
    print("The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) has states that handle both audio and video functions (e.g., State 1, State 3).")
    print("Due to imbalanced training data, the probabilities heavily favor audio functions.")
    print("This leads to poor recommendations for less frequent video processing tasks.")
    print("The goal is to find the most cost-effective way to improve video recommendation accuracy.\n")
    
    print("Evaluation of Answer Choices:")
    
    print("A. Add more training data for video processing:")
    print("   - Effectiveness: High. More data would improve the model's accuracy.")
    print("   - Cost: Very high. Data acquisition and labeling are expensive and time-consuming.")
    
    print("\nB. Use resampling to reduce the imbalance:")
    print("   - Effectiveness: Medium. It can help balance probabilities but doesn't fix the underlying structural issue of ambiguous states.")
    print("   - Cost: Low. It's a simple data preprocessing step.")
    
    print("\nC. Train a specific model for video and another for audio:")
    print("   - Effectiveness: High. Specialized models perform well.")
    print("   - Cost: High. It increases complexity, requiring maintenance of two models and a classifier to route requests.")

    print("\nD. Add specific states to indicate audio or video processing:")
    print("   - Effectiveness: Very High. This fixes the root cause of the problem by creating separate, unambiguous paths for audio and video workflows.")
    print("   - Cost: Medium. Requires a one-time model redesign and retraining on existing data. This is more cost-effective than continuous data collection or managing multiple models.")

    print("\nE. Use a model with a longer context window, such as LLM:")
    print("   - Effectiveness: High. More complex models can capture more context.")
    print("   - Cost: Very High. Involves a complete change in architecture, with significantly higher computational and implementation costs.\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("Option D is the most cost-effective solution. It addresses the fundamental flaw in the model's design—ambiguous states—with a one-time engineering effort. This provides a robust and highly effective solution without the high recurring costs of data collection (A) or the complexity of options (C) and (E). It is a more fundamental and effective fix than simply resampling the data (B).")
