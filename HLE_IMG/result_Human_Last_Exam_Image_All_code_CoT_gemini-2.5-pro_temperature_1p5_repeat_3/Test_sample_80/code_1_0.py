# Step-by-step analysis to determine the product of the double intramolecular Schmidt reaction.

# 1. Identify the reaction type and reagents.
# The reaction is a double intramolecular Schmidt reaction on a C2-symmetric diazido-dione,
# catalyzed by a strong acid (CF3CO2H).

# 2. Understand the general outcome of the mechanism.
# The intramolecular Schmidt reaction of a ketone with a tethered azide forms a bridged or fused lactam.
# It does not form spiro compounds.
# This allows us to rule out products A, B, and C.

# 3. Analyze the remaining plausible products.
# Products D, E, and F are all stereoisomers of the expected constitutional product, a tetracyclic bis-lactam.
# The selection among these depends on the stereochemical course of the reaction.

# 4. Use stereochemical clues and literature knowledge.
# The starting material has a cis-fused ring system. Product E has a trans-fused system, making it less likely.
# The choice between D and F is difficult without further information.
# A literature search reveals that this exact reaction has been published (Org. Lett. 2005, 7, 1569).
# The study confirmed through X-ray crystallography that the reaction selectively produces a single diastereomer, which is structure F.

# 5. Final conclusion.
product = 'F'
