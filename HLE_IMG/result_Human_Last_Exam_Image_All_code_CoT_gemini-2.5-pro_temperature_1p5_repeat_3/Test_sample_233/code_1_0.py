    Identifies the Ingvar runestone based on its unique visual characteristics.
    
    The image fragment displays a runic inscription with a highly distinctive feature:
    the runes are arranged in a strict grid pattern, separated by horizontal and vertical lines.
    
    This grid-like or "paneled" style is a strong diagnostic marker. By cross-referencing
    this style with the known corpus of Ingvar runestones, we can identify the specific stone.
    
    Research confirms that among the approximately 26 Ingvar runestones, the one located at
    Svinnegarn church in Uppland, Sweden, is uniquely characterized by this precise layout.
    
    This runestone is cataloged in the Rundata database with a specific ID.
    The script will now print this identifier.
