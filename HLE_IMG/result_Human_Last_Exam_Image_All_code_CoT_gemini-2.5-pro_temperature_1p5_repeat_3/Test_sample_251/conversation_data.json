    "Here is my plan to solve the task:\n\n1.  **Analyze the ECG Parameters**: I will first read the parameters provided on the ECG strip to understand the time scale. The paper speed is given as 25 mm/sec. I know that a standard large square on an ECG grid is 5 mm wide.\n2.  **Calculate Time per Square**: Using the paper speed, I will calculate the time duration corresponding to one large square. The formula is: `Time per square = Width of square / Paper speed`.\n3.  **Identify the Longest R-R Interval**: I will visually scan the entire rhythm strip to locate the longest gap between two consecutive R-waves (the sharp, tall spikes). This corresponds to the slowest heart rate on the strip.\n4.  **Measure the Interval**: Once the longest interval is found, I will count the number of large squares that fit into this gap, from the peak of one R-wave to the peak of the next.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Duration**: I will multiply the number of large squares counted in the previous step by the time per large square calculated in step 2 to get the final answer in seconds.\n6.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a Python script that automates these calculations and prints out the step-by-step process and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_longest_rr_interval():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the longest R-R interval from an ECG strip.\n\n    This function determines the longest R-R interval based on standard ECG parameters\n    and visual analysis of the provided image.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define ECG parameters from the image.\n    paper_speed_mm_per_sec = 25  # The paper speed is 25 mm/sec.\n    large_square_width_mm = 5    # The width of one large square is 5 mm.\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the time duration of one large square.\n    time_per_large_square = large_square_width_mm / paper_speed_mm_per_sec\n\n    # Step 3: Visually identify and measure the longest R-R interval from the image.\n    # By inspecting the ECG strip, the longest interval is found on the fourth line.\n    # Counting the squares between the peaks of the two relevant R-waves reveals\n    # that the interval covers 7 large squares.\n    num_large_squares = 7\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the total duration of the longest R-R interval.\n    longest_rr_interval_sec = num_large_squares * time_per_large_square\n\n    # Step 5: Print the detailed explanation and the final calculation.\n    print(\"To determine the longest R-R interval:\")\n    print(f\"1.
