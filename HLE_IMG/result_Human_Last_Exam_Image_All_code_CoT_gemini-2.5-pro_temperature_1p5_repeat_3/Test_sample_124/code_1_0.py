    Analyzes the provided circuit diagram to calculate the total current.

    The analysis shows that due to the specific wiring:
    1. Resistors R1, R2, and R3 are all in parallel with the voltage source.
    2. Resistor R8 is short-circuited by a wire, so no current flows through it.
    3. Resistor R7 is connected in parallel with the voltage source.

    Therefore, the total current is the sum of the currents through the four
    parallel resistors: R1, R2, R3, and R7.
