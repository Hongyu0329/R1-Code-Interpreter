    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical reaction to identify reagents A and B.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the transformation from Compound 1 to Compound 2 (Reaction A)**\n\n1.  **Examine the structures:** Compound 1 is a heterocyclic cation containing a pyrylium ring (a six-membered ring with a positively charged oxygen atom). Specifically, it appears to be a derivative of a dibenzo[c,h]xanthen-7-ylium salt.\n2.  Compound 2 is structurally very similar to Compound 1, but the oxygen atom in the central heterocyclic ring has been replaced by a nitrogen atom, and this nitrogen is bonded to an amino group (-NH2). The resulting structure is an N-aminopyridinium salt derivative.\n3.  **Identify the reaction type:** The conversion of a pyrylium salt to an N-aminopyridinium salt is a well-known reaction in organic chemistry. It occurs by treating the pyrylium salt with a suitable nitrogen-based nucleophile.\n4.  **Propose Reagent A:** The reagent required to introduce an N-NH2 group is hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂). Hydrazine acts as a nucleophile, attacking the pyrylium ring, which leads to a ring-opening and ring-closing sequence that replaces the oxygen atom with the H₂N-N< group.\n    *   **Therefore, Reagent A is Hydrazine.**\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the transformation from Compound 2 to Compound 3 (Reaction B)**\n\n1.  **Examine the structures:** This transformation is more complex as it involves changes at two different locations in the molecule.\n    *   **Change at the bottom:** The N-aminopyridinium group (>N⁺-NH₂) in Compound 2 is converted to a simple pyridinium-like amine group (>N-H) in Compound 3. This is a deamination reaction (loss of the -NH₂ group).\n    *   **Change at the top:** On the upper part of the molecule, one of the methoxy groups (-OCH₃) is lost, and a new six-membered ring containing an N-propyl group (-N-CH₂CH₂CH₃) is formed.\n2.  **Identify the reaction type and propose Reagent B:**\n    *   The formation of the N-propyl group strongly suggests that the reagent contains a propyl group attached to a nitrogen atom. The simplest such reagent is **propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) **.\n    *   Let's see if propylamine can account for the observed changes. The overall positive charge of the molecule makes the attached benzene rings electron-deficient and thus susceptible to nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr). Propylamine can act as a nucleophile, attacking the carbon atom bearing a methoxy group, leading to the displacement of the methoxy group.\n    *   The resulting intermediate could then undergo an intramolecular cyclization to form the new N-propyl containing ring observed in Compound 3.\n    *   The deamination at the bottom (>N⁺-NH₂ → >N-H) could occur under the reaction conditions (e.g., with heating) required for the substitution and cyclization at the top.\n    *   Thus, a single reagent, propylamine, can plausibly account for the new structural features in Compound 3.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n*   Reagent A is **Hydrazine**.\n*   Reagent B is **Propylamine**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the reagents A and B for the given chemical reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    reagent_A = \"Hydrazine (H2N-NH2)\"\n    reagent_B = \"Propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)\"\n\n    print(\"Analysis of the reaction steps:\")\n    print(\"Step 1 (Compound 1 to 2): A pyrylium salt is converted to an N-aminopyridinium salt.\")\n    print(f\"This is a characteristic reaction with hydrazine. Therefore, Reagent A is: {reagent_A}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2 (Compound 2 to 3): A new N-propyl ring is formed by replacing a methoxy group, and the N-amino group is deaminated.\")\n    print(f\"The most likely reagent to introduce the N-propyl group is propylamine. Therefore, Reagent B is: {reagent_B}\")\n\nsolve_reaction()\n```\n<<<Reagent A is Hydrazine and Reagent B is Propylamine.>>>"
