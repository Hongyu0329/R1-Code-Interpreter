    "Here is my plan to solve this task:\n1.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts**: I will visually inspect the provided graph to identify the timestamps of the major synchronized bursts. A burst is a dense vertical cluster of dots, indicating that many neurons fired at nearly the same time.\n2.  **Estimate Timestamps**: I will estimate the time (in seconds) for the approximate center of each identified burst based on the x-axis scale (0 to 50 seconds).\n3.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals**: I will calculate the time difference between each consecutive pair of burst timestamps. These are the inter-burst intervals.\n4.  **Calculate Average Interval**: I will sum all the calculated intervals and divide by the number of intervals to find the average.\n5.  **Format the Output**: I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the entire process, including the identified timestamps, the individual intervals, the full equation for the average, and the final result rounded to two significant figures.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_average_interval():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies timestamps of synchronized bursts from a graph, calculates the \n    inter-burst intervals, and computes the average interval.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify and list the approximate timestamps of the major synchronized bursts from the graph.\n    # Bursts are visible as dense vertical columns of firing activity.\n    burst_timestamps = [2, 11, 18, 27, 36, 47]\n    print(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (time difference between consecutive bursts).\n    intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\n    print(\"Calculating inter-burst intervals:\")\n    for i in range(len(intervals)):\n        print(f\"  Interval {i+1}: {burst_timestamps[i+1]} s - {burst_timestamps[i]} s = {intervals[i]} s\")\n    print(f\"\\nCalculated inter-burst intervals (s): {list(intervals)}\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate the average of these intervals.\n    sum_of_intervals = np.sum(intervals)\n    number_of_intervals = len(intervals)\n    average_interval = np.mean(intervals)\n\n    # Step 5: Display the full calculation and the final answer.\n    # The equation string is built to show all numbers used in the calculation.\n    equation_str = f\"({ ' + '.join(map(str, intervals)) }) / {number_of_intervals}\"\n    print(f\"Average inter-burst interval calculation: {equation_str} = {average_interval:.2f} s\")\n\n    # Round the final answer to two significant figures. \n    # For a number like 9.0, this is equivalent to one decimal place.\n    final_answer = float(f\"{average_interval:.1f}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe average inter-burst interval rounded to two significant figures is {final_answer} s.\")\n\ncalculate_average_interval()\n```\n<<<9.0>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
