  This function identifies the main figure in the chariot based on the mythological scene
  depicted on the ancient Greek vase.

  The scene shows:
  - A driver in Eastern (Phrygian) attire.
  - A chariot used for a dramatic escape.
  - A dead youth on the ground.

  This iconography specifically corresponds to the myth of Medea fleeing Corinth
  after taking revenge on her husband Jason.
