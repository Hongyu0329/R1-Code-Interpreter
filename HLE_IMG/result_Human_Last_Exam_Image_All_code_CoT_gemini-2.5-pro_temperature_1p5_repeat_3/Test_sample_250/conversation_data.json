    "This handwritten lead sheet displays a famous jazz standard. I can identify it by analyzing its key, melody, and unique chord progression.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n1.  **Key Signature and Tonality:** The key signature has four flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db). The piece starts and ends on an F minor chord, indicating the key is F minor.\n2.  **A Section Analysis:** The first section (the 'A' section) is characterized by a descending chromatic line from the tonic, F. The chords are `F-`, `E-7b5`, `Eb-6`, and `Dbmaj7`. This progression, with a descending bass line (F, E, Eb, Db), is a hallmark of this particular tune. The melody also follows this descent.\n3.  **B Section (Bridge) Analysis:** The most telling part is the bridge, which begins at the `D-7b5` chord. The progression is:\n    *   `D-7b5 | G7` (a ii-V progression resolving to C minor)\n    *   `C-7 | F7` (a ii-V progression resolving to Bb major)\n    *   `Bb-7 | Eb7` (a ii-V progression resolving to Ab major)\n    This sequence of descending ii-V progressions is the unmistakable bridge of the jazz standard \"Nica's Dream\".\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the characteristic A section with its chromatic descent and the iconic bridge with its cycle of ii-V's, the tune is \"Nica's Dream,\" composed by the great hard-bop pianist and composer Horace Silver.\n\nHere is the Python code to print the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_music_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the title and composer of the jazz standard\n    from the provided sheet music analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Nica's Dream\"\n    composer = \"Horace Silver\"\n    \n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nsolve_music_puzzle()\n```\n<<<Title: Nica's Dream, Composer: Horace Silver>>>"
