    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot.\n\n1.  **Knot Identification:** First, I will identify the knot shown in the picture. By counting its crossings (it has 7) and comparing its structure to standard knot tables, the knot is identified as the **7₆ knot**.\n\n2.  **Property of the Knot:** The 7₆ knot is an **alternating knot**, meaning that as we trace along the knot, the crossings alternate between going over and under.\n\n3.  **Rasmussen Invariant Formula:** For alternating knots, there's a straightforward formula to calculate the Rasmussen s-invariant. The invariant, denoted as `s(K)`, is the negative of the knot's **signature**, denoted as `σ(K)`. The formula is: `s(K) = -σ(K)`.\n\n4.  **Knot Signature:** The signature of the 7₆ knot is a well-known value in knot theory. From standard knot tables, the signature `σ(7₆)` is **-4**.\n\n5.  **Calculation:** Using the formula and the known signature, I will calculate the Rasmussen s-invariant.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan and prints the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rasmussen_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Rasmussen invariant for the knot 7_6.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the knot and its properties.\n    knot_name = \"7_6\"\n    knot_type = \"alternating\"\n    \n    # Step 2: State the known signature for this knot from knot theory tables.\n    knot_signature = -4\n    \n    # Step 3: Apply the formula for the Rasmussen s-invariant for alternating knots.\n    # The formula is s(K) = -σ(K), where σ(K) is the knot signature.\n    rasmussen_invariant = -knot_signature\n    \n    # Step 4: Print the explanation and the final calculation.\n    print(f\"The knot in the image is identified as the {knot_name} knot, which is an {knot_type} knot.\")\n    print(\"For an alternating knot K, the Rasmussen s-invariant is the negative of its signature σ(K).\")\n    print(f\"The signature of the {knot_name} knot is known to be: σ({knot_name}) = {knot_signature}\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the Rasmussen s-invariant s(K) = -σ(K):\")\n    print(f\"s({knot_name}) = -({knot_signature})\")\n    print(f\"s({knot_name}) = {rasmussen_invariant}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe Rasmussen invariant of the knot is {rasmussen_invariant}.\")\n\ncalculate_rasmussen_invariant()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
