    "To determine the Roman numeral for the circled chord in measure 8, we need to follow a few steps of music theory analysis.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Key:** First, we'll establish the key of the piece by looking at the key signature and the surrounding harmonic context.\n2.  **Identify the Notes:** We'll carefully read the notes in both the treble and bass clefs for the specific chord that is circled.\n3.  **Analyze the Chord:** By stacking the identified notes into thirds, we can determine the chord's root, quality (major, minor, diminished, dominant 7th, etc.), and inversion (which note is in the bass).\n4.  **Determine the Function:** We'll relate the chord back to the home key to understand its function. Since the chord is not diatonic to the key, we will analyze it as a secondary chord.\n5.  **Construct the Roman Numeral:** Finally, we will assemble all this information into the correct Roman numeral, including figures for the inversion and the secondary function.\n\nThe following Python code will walk through this analysis and print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_mozart_chord():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the circled chord in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397,\n    and provides the accurate Roman numeral analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the key.\n    key_signature = \"One flat (Bb)\"\n    tonal_center = \"D minor\"\n    print(f\"Step 1: The key signature is {key_signature}, and the piece is established in {tonal_center}.\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Identify the notes in the circled chord.\n    # The chord is on the 3rd beat of measure 8.\n    # Left hand (bass clef): A (ledger line), C (space), Eb (space), A (line)\n    # Right hand (treble clef): F (space)\n    notes_in_chord = {'F', 'A', 'C', 'Eb'}\n    bass_note = 'A'\n    print(f\"\\nStep 2: The notes sounding in the chord are F, A, C, and Eb.

It functions as a secondary dominant.\n    # F7 is the V7 (dominant 7th) chord of Bb major.\n    # In D minor, Bb major is the submediant (VI) chord.\n    target_chord = \"VI (the submediant, Bb major)\"\n    print(f\"\\nStep 4: This chord functions as a secondary dominant.
