    "My plan to determine the molecular formula of the final product is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material**: I will first determine the molecular formula of the initial reactant by counting the atoms of each element (Carbon, Hydrogen, Fluorine, Nitrogen, Oxygen) in its structure. The structure is 2-(4-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n2.  **Analyze Step 1**: The first reaction uses CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate), a reagent known for oxidatively removing the PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) protecting group from a nitrogen atom. This process replaces the PMB group with a hydrogen atom. I will calculate the change in atom counts and determine the formula for Intermediate 1.\n3.  **Analyze Step 2**: The second reaction is a catalytic hydrogenation (Pd/C, H2), which reduces the carbon-carbon double bond in the molecule. This adds two hydrogen atoms. I will update the atomic composition to find the formula for Intermediate 2.\n4.  **Analyze Step 3**: The final step is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (4 N HCl, 70 Â°C). This reaction opens the lactam (cyclic amide) ring by adding a molecule of water (H2O), forming an amino acid. I will add the atoms of water to the formula of Intermediate 2 to get the molecular formula of the final product.\n5.  **Final Output**: I will use a Python script to perform these calculations step-by-step and print the final molecular formula.\n\n```python\ndef solve_molecular_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product of a three-step reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of the starting material.\n    # The starting material is 2-(4-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    # Let's break it down to count the atoms.\n    # Bicyclic core (C6H5N) + Carbonyl O + CF3 group + PMB group.\n    # Core (2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one backbone, without CF3 and PMB): C6H6NO\n    # C1(CH), C3(C=O), C4(CH), C5(CH), C6(CH), C7(CH2), N2(NH)\n    # Total C in core = 6, H = 6, N=1, O=1.
