    print("1. Electronic Stabilization: Adding electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Fluorine) to make the complex harder to oxidize.")
    print("2. Steric Protection: Adding bulky groups (e.g., tert-butyl) to physically shield the complex from degradation.")
    print("\nComparing the complexes:")
    print("- Complex 1: This is a standard benchmark emitter with no special stabilizing groups.")
    print("- Complex 2: This complex has a large ancillary ligand but lacks strong electronic stabilization (no fluorine) and its steric protection is not as targeted as in Complex 3.")
    print("- Complex 3: This complex is explicitly designed for high stability:")
    print("  - It has Fluorine (F) atoms on the main ligands, providing electronic stabilization against oxidation.")
    print("  - It has bulky tert-butyl groups on the other ligand, providing steric protection against ligand dissociation.")
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("Complex 3 incorporates both major stabilization strategies, making it the most robust molecule.")
