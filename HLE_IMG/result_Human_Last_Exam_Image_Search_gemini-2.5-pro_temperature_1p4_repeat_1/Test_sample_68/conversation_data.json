    "This coin originates from **French Louisiana**.\n\nThe coin is a 9 Deniers, often referred to as the \"Louisiana Copper,\" which was minted in 1721 and 1722 for circulation in France's American colonies. The inscription \"COLONIES FRANCOISES\" is visible on the reverse, and the obverse features the interlaced \"L\" monogram of King Louis XV.\n\nThese copper coins were authorized by an edict in June 1721 to provide much-needed small change throughout France's expansive territories in the New World, which included the administrative district of \"Louisianne.\" The coins were produced at the Rouen (mintmark \"B\") and La Rochelle (mintmark \"H\") mints. Although initially intended for broader use, they were eventually redistributed by the West India Company and successfully circulated in Louisiana.\n\n<<<French Louisiana>>>"
