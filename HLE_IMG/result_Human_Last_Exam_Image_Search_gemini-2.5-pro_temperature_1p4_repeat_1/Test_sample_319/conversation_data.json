    "The image and description point to the phenomenon known as the **auditory continuity illusion** or **perceptual restoration**.\n\nThis auditory illusion occurs when a sound, such as a pure tone or a segment of speech, is interrupted by a short burst of another sound, typically noise. If the interrupting noise is loud enough to mask the gap, the brain perceptually \"fills in\" the missing portion of the original sound, leading to the perception that the sound is continuous.\n\nThe image provided illustrates this:\n*   The top panel is a spectrogram showing a single-frequency tone (the horizontal line) being interrupted by a brief, broadband noise (the vertical line). Physically, the tone stops, is replaced by noise, and then resumes.\n*   However, due to the auditory continuity illusion, a listener is likely to perceive the tone as continuing uninterrupted *through* the noise.\n\nThis phenomenon reveals the brain's remarkable ability to maintain perceptual continuity by making intelligent guesses to fill in missing sensory information, an ability that is constantly at work, usually without our conscious awareness. This \"filling-in\" is not just for simple tones but also works for more complex sounds like melodies and speech, where it is often called the phonemic restoration effect. The reference to the Necker Cube highlights the perceptual ambiguity involved; one can be aware of the physical reality (tone, noise, tone) or experience the illusion of a continuous tone playing behind a noise.\n\n<<<auditory continuity illusion>>>"
