    "Based on the visual evidence and knowledge of mineralogy, the specimens can be identified and then ordered by the complexity of their silicate structures.\n\n**Specimen Identification:**\n\n*   **A - Augite (Pyroxene):** The specimen is a dark, stubby, prismatic crystal, which is a common habit for pyroxene minerals like augite.\n*   **B - Mica (likely Muscovite or Chlorite):** This specimen displays a distinct flaky or sheet-like structure, characteristic of mica group minerals. The green color suggests it could be chlorite or a green variety of muscovite.\n*   **C - Olivine:** The granular mass of olive-green crystals is highly characteristic of olivine.\n*   **D - Quartz:** This is a translucent, terminated hexagonal crystal, a classic form for quartz.\n\n**Silicate Structure Complexity:**\n\nSilicate minerals are classified based on how their fundamental building blocks, the silica tetrahedra (SiOâ‚„), are linked together. The complexity increases with the number of shared oxygen atoms per tetrahedron.\n\n1.  **C - Olivine (Nesosilicate):** Olivine has the simplest structure, consisting of isolated silica tetrahedra that are not directly linked to each other but are bonded by other metal ions.\n2.  **A - Augite/Pyroxene (Inosilicate - Single Chain):** In pyroxenes, each tetrahedron shares two oxygen atoms with its neighbors, forming a single chain.\n3.  **B - Mica (Phyllosilicate - Sheet):** Micas are sheet silicates where each tetrahedron shares three oxygen atoms with adjacent tetrahedra, forming flat sheets.\n4.  **D - Quartz (Tectosilicate - Framework):** Quartz represents the most complex structure where every tetrahedron shares all four of its oxygen atoms with other tetrahedra, creating a complete three-dimensional framework.\n\nTherefore, the correct order from least complex to most complex silicate structure is Olivine (C), Augite (A), Mica (B), and Quartz (D).\n\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
