    "Based on a comparison of the provided image with chemical structures from reliable sources, the compound is identified as **Lupanine**.\n\nLupanine is a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid and has the chemical formula C₁₅H₂₄N₂O. It is the major alkaloid found in the seeds of several *Lupinus* species. The structure contains a lactam (a cyclic amide), which distinguishes it from the related alkaloid sparteine. It should not be confused with Matrine, which is a stereoisomer with a different ring fusion.\n\nOther names for this compound include (+)-Lupanine and 2-Oxosparteine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
