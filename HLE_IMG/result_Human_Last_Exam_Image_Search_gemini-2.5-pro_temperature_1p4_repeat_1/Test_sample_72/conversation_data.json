    "The reaction shown involves two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions to transform hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene into the final product.\n\nBased on established photochemical reactions of hexafluorobenzene and alkenes, the two pericyclic reactions involved are a **[2+2] cycloaddition** followed by an **electrocyclic ring opening**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the transformation:\n\n1.  **Photochemical [2+2] Cycloaddition**: The first step is a light-induced [2+2] cycloaddition between one of the double bonds of hexafluorobenzene and the double bond of cyclobutene. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [2+2] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed. This reaction forms a tricyclic intermediate containing a highly strained four-membered ring fused to both the benzene and the cyclobutene rings.\n\n2.  **Electrocyclic Ring Opening**: The intermediate formed in the first step is not stable and rapidly undergoes another pericyclic reaction. The original cyclobutene ring in the intermediate opens up in an electrocyclic reaction. This is a 4-electron (4Ï€) process. Under thermal conditions, this ring-opening would be conrotatory. However, it's part of a larger photochemical sequence, and such subsequent rearrangements of initial photoadducts are common. This ring-opening relieves the strain of the cyclobutene ring and leads to the formation of the final, more stable bicyclic product shown.\n\nIn summary, the transformation proceeds through an initial photochemically-allowed [2+2] cycloaddition, which is then followed by a thermally-allowed electrocyclic ring opening of the strained intermediate.\n\n<<<[2+2] cycloaddition and electrocyclic ring opening>>>"
