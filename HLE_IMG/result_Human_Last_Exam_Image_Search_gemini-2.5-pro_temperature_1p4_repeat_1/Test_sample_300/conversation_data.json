    "<<<From top to bottom, and left to right:\n\n1.  **Xu Beihong (徐悲鸿):** This painting of three women in traditional attire is characteristic of Xu Beihong's figure paintings, which blend Chinese ink and wash techniques with Western realism. The artist's signature, \"悲鸿\" (Bēihóng), is visible in the upper right corner.\n\n2.  **Pan Tianshou (潘天寿):** This black and white ink wash landscape is in the bold and powerful style of Pan Tianshou, a master of modern Chinese painting known for his monumental landscapes and vigorous brushwork.\n\n3.  **Mao Zedong (毛泽东):** This piece of cursive calligraphy is a rendition of a poem by Li Bai. The wild and expressive \"crazy cursive\" script (狂草) is a hallmark of Mao Zedong's highly personal and powerful calligraphic style.\n\n4.  **He Shaoji (何绍基):** This calligraphy is by the Qing dynasty scholar and artist He Shaoji. His distinctive style, which is deeply rooted in ancient stele inscriptions, is evident in the work's heavy, solid, and archaic brushstrokes.\n\n5.  **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊):** This oil painting is the famous work \"Youth\" (also known as *The Young Female Singer*) from 1984 by Jin Shangyi, a leading figure in Chinese Neo-Realism. The subject of the portrait is the renowned singer Peng Liyuan.\n\n6.  **Shi Hu (史虎):** This vibrant portrait of a woman from an ethnic minority group is the work of contemporary artist Shi Hu. He is known for his innovative use of color and expressive lines, combining traditional and modern elements to depict such themes.\n\n7.  **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中):** This colorful painting of a courtyard with loofah gourds and laundry is by the celebrated modern painter Wu Guanzhong. The artist's signature is visible in the painting, and the style, which fuses Western modernism with Chinese artistic sensibilities, is unmistakably his.\n\n8.  **Li Keran (李可染):** This dramatic landscape featuring red boats against dark cliffs is a classic example of Li Keran's \"red landscapes.\" He was a master at using ink and color to create powerful and monumental mountain scenes, often inspired by Mao Zedong's poetry.\n\n9.  **Qi Baishi (齐白石):** The painting of a single lobster is by the great master Qi Baishi. While he is most famous for his paintings of shrimp, his depictions of other creatures like lobsters and crabs share the same lively spirit, minimalist composition, and masterful brushwork.>>>"
