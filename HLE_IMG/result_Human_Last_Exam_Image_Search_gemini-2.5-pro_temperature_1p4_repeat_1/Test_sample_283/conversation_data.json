    "Based on the recurring annual peaks in the Google Trends graph, the events correspond to significant historical commemorations in the United States.\n\n*   **Red Line (early December):** The consistent spike at the beginning of December points to National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, which is observed annually on December 7th in the United States. This day commemorates the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, which led to the United States' entry into World War II. Each year, ceremonies are held to honor the 2,403 Americans who were killed.\n\n*   **Blue Line (late May):** The recurring peak at the end of May aligns with Memorial Day, a U.S. federal holiday observed on the last Monday of May. This day honors military personnel who died while serving in the United States Armed Forces. It is a day for visiting cemeteries and memorials, and it also informally marks the beginning of summer.\n\n*   **Yellow Line (early September):** The sharp, annual spike in late August or early September corresponds to the anniversary of the September 11 attacks. This pivotal and tragic event in the nation's history is commemorated annually on September 11th with ceremonies at the sites of the attacks to remember the nearly 3,000 people who lost their lives.\n\nThese three events—Pearl Harbor Day, Memorial Day, and the September 11th attacks—are all major historical moments that are deeply ingrained in the history of the United States and are widely commemorated each year.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
