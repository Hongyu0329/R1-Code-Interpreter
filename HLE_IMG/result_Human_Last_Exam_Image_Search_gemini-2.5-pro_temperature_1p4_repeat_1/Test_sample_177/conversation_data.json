    "Here is the step-by-step calculation to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled).\n\nTo find the total VMT, we calculate a weighted VMT for each scenario by summing the VMT contributed by each trip distance category. The VMT for each category is calculated using the formula:\n\n**VMT Category = (Share of Total Trips) × (Total Car Mode Share for the category) × (Average Trip Distance)**\n\n### **1. Calculate Baseline Car VMT**\n\nFirst, we calculate the total car mode share for each distance category in the Baseline scenario (Table 1) by adding the share of \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** (25% + 28%) = 53%\n*   **3-5 miles:** (38% + 43%) = 81%\n*   **5-10 miles:** (40% + 45%) = 85%\n*   **10+ miles:** (42% + 47%) = 89%\n\nNext, we calculate the VMT for each category and sum them up.\n\n*   **0-3 miles VMT:** 0.48 (share of trips) × 0.53 (car share) × 1 (avg distance) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles VMT:** 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles VMT:** 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles VMT:** 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = 2.8480\n\n**Total Baseline VMT =** 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n### **2. Calculate Proposed Car VMT**\n\nWe repeat the process for the Proposed scenario (Table 2). First, the total car mode share for each distance category:\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** (1% + 2%) = 3%\n*   **3-5 miles:** (8% + 19%) = 27%\n*   **5-10 miles:** (14% + 27%) = 41%\n*   **10+ miles:** (16% + 33%) = 49%\n\nNext, we calculate the VMT for each category and sum them up.\n\n*   **0-3 miles VMT:** 0.48 (share of trips) × 0.03 (car share) × 1 (avg distance) = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles VMT:** 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles VMT:** 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles VMT:** 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = 1.5680\n\n**Total Proposed VMT =** 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n### **3. Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage reduction using the following formula:\n\n**Percentage Reduction = ((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) × 100**\n\n*   **VMT Reduction:** 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction:** (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100 ≈ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction in Car VMT is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
