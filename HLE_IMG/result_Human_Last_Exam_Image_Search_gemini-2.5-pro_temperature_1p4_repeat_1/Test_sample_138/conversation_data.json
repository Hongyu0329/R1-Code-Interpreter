    "Here is the identification of the biological sexes for each pair of insects:\n\n*   **Pair A:** The insect on the left (A1) belongs to the genus *Coelioxys*. The long, sharply pointed, cone-shaped abdomen is a definitive characteristic of a female of this genus, used for piercing host nests to lay eggs. The insect on the right (A2) is another cuckoo bee, likely from the genus *Triepeolus*. Distinguishing sex in this genus can be subtle without seeing specific features clearly, but given the options and the clear identification of A1 as female, further analysis is needed. The antennae do not appear unusually long, which would suggest it is not a male. The overall context of the pairings would suggest A2 is also female. Thus, this pair is Female, Female.\n*   **Pair B:** These are paper wasps of the genus *Polistes*. In this genus, males are reliably identified by the distinctly curled or hooked tips of their antennae. The wasp on the left (B1) has straight antennae, characteristic of a female, while the wasp on the right (B2) clearly displays curled antennae, identifying it as a male. Therefore, this pair is Female, Male.\n*   **Pair C:** These bees belong to the long-horned bee tribe (Eucerini), likely the genus *Melissodes*. Males in this group are distinguished by their exceptionally long antennae and often have a yellow or pale patch on their face (clypeus). The bee on the left (C1) exhibits both of these traits—very long antennae and a pale face—making it a male. The bee on the right (C2) has noticeably shorter antennae and a dark face, which are characteristic features of a female. Thus, this pair is Male, Female.\n\nBased on this analysis, the indices corresponding to (A, B, C) are:\nA = (F, F) -> 2\nB = (F, M) -> 4\nC = (M, F) -> 3\n\n<<<2, 4, 3>>>"
