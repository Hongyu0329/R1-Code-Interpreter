    "The molecule depicted in the image is **cyclocarbon**.\n\nThis molecule is an allotrope of carbon, meaning it is a substance made entirely of carbon atoms, with the chemical formula C₁₈. It consists of a ring of 18 carbon atoms that are connected by alternating single and triple bonds. Due to this ring structure, it is also referred to as a cyclocarbon.\n\nCyclocarbon is a subject of significant interest in the scientific community and was successfully synthesized and imaged in its solid state in 2019. Its structure has been confirmed to be polyynic, with distinct alternating single and triple bonds, which gives the molecule a nine-sided appearance. This arrangement makes it a semiconductor.\n\nThe synthesis of cyclocarbon was a long-standing challenge for chemists. It was ultimately achieved by using atomic manipulation techniques at very low temperatures (5 Kelvin) to remove carbon monoxide groups from a precursor molecule, C₂₄O₆, or by the dehalogenation of C₁₈Br₆ on a sodium chloride surface.\n\nThe unique cyclic structure of cyclocarbon gives it uncommon properties, and it is considered a subject worthy of in-depth exploration for potential applications in fields like catalysis, electrochemical devices, and optoelectronics.\n\n<<<cyclocarbon>>>"
