    "The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that allows for their distinction at a glance is the **curvature of the seta**.\n\nIn *Grimmia montana*, the sporophyte features a **straight, erect seta** which holds the capsule upright. Capsules on this species are noted as being rare but are supported by these short, straight stalks when present.\n\nConversely, *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by its **arcuate, or curved, seta**. This curvature gives the capsule a bent or nodding appearance. The species name *curviseta* itself, which translates to \"curved bristle,\" highlights this defining feature.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward way to distinguish between the two species when they are bearing sporophytes is to observe the seta: it is straight in *Grimmia montana* and curved in *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n<<<The key distinguishing feature of the sporophyte is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a curved (arcuate) seta.>>>"
