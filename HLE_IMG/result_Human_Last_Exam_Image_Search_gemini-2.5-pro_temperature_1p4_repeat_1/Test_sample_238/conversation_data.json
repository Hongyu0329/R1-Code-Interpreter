    "The small, black, pin-like organisms visible on the surface of the shelf fungus are a type of slime mold known as **_Hemitrichia calyculata_**.\n\nThis organism is commonly called the \"Push Pin Slime Mold\" due to its appearance. It is frequently found in moist environments, growing on decaying wood and other organic material, including other fungi.\n\nThe visible structures are the mature fruiting bodies, which start as a mobile, protoplasmic mass called a plasmodium. This plasmodium feeds on bacteria and other microorganisms. When ready to reproduce, it forms these stalked, cup-shaped structures that eventually release spores. While they may appear to be parasitic, they play a role as decomposers in their ecosystem. The larger fungi they are growing on are a type of bracket or shelf fungus, likely from the *Trametes* genus, commonly known as Turkeytail.\n\n<<<Hemitrichia calyculata>>>"
