    "To determine the longest R-R interval on the provided rhythm strip, one must first understand the calibration of the ECG paper. The strip indicates a paper speed of 25 mm/sec. At this standard speed, each small 1 mm square on the horizontal axis represents 0.04 seconds, and each large 5 mm square represents 0.20 seconds. The R-R interval is the time elapsed between two consecutive R-waves, which are the highest peaks in the QRS complex.\n\nUpon visual inspection of the entire ECG, a significant pause is noticeable in the fourth rhythm strip down. This is the longest interval between two consecutive heartbeats shown.\n\nTo calculate the duration of this interval:\n*   **Identify the R-waves:** Locate the R-wave immediately preceding the pause and the one immediately following it.\n*   **Count the squares:** Carefully count the number of squares between the peaks of these two R-waves. The interval spans approximately 7 full large squares and 4 small squares.\n*   **Calculate the time:**\n    *   7 large squares x 0.20 seconds/large square = 1.40 seconds\n    *   4 small squares x 0.04 seconds/small square = 0.16 seconds\n    *   Total time = 1.40 seconds + 0.16 seconds = 1.56 seconds.\n\nAlternatively, counting the total number of small squares gives approximately 39 squares.\n*   39 small squares x 0.04 seconds/small square = 1.56 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the longest R-R interval on this rhythm strip is 1.56 seconds.\n\n<<<1.56>>>"
