    "The cuneiform sign in the image represents the Sumerian word for \"guard\" or \"watch.\" Specifically, this sign dates to the Pre-Sargonic period of the third millennium BCE.\n\nThe sign is a compound ideogram. It is cataloged in modern sign lists under designations like LAK-387. It represents the Sumerian term *enun*, which translates to \"guard\" or \"watchpost.\" Divination was an important practice in Mesopotamia, with the first references to it found in sources from the third millennium BCE. Ur III texts also mention the *aga'-us*, or royal guard.\n\nThis particular sign is complex, but its components are related to its meaning. It incorporates elements that signify an enclosure or building with a person of authority, befitting the concept of a guard. The term *en*, meaning \"lord\" or \"priest,\" is a component of the word *enun*.\n\nThe other options are represented by different cuneiform signs:\n*   **Bread** (Sumerian: *ninda*) has a sign resembling a bowl.\n*   **Home/House** (Sumerian: *e₂*) is typically a simpler sign, a basic rectangle or square, though this sign for \"guard\" does incorporate a building-like structure.\n*   **Deity** (Sumerian: *dingir*) is represented by a star-shaped sign.\n*   **Beard** (Sumerian: *su₆*) has its own distinct sign.\n\n<<<B>>>"
