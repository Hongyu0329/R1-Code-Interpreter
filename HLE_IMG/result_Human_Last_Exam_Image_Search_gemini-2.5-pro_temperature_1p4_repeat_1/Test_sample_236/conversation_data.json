    "The animal depicted in the center of the image is a Goldenrod Soldier Beetle. Its scientific name is *Chauliognathus pensylvanicus*.\n\nThis beetle is also commonly known as the Pennsylvania leatherwing. It belongs to the soldier beetle family, Cantharidae. As its name suggests, it is frequently found on goldenrod flowers, but also visits other plants.\n\nAdults are active in the late summer and early fall and feed on pollen and nectar, but they are also known to prey on small insects like aphids. The larvae are carnivorous and live in the soil, where they consume other insects. Despite sometimes appearing in large numbers, they are considered beneficial insects as they are pollinators and help control pest populations. They do not harm plants and are harmless to humans.\n\n<<<Chauliognathus pensylvanicus>>>"
