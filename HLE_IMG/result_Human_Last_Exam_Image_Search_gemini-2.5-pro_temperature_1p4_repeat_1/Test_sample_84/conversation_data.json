    "The coat of arms that is very similar to the one in the image belongs to the city of **Polignano a Mare**, Italy. This town is located in the Metropolitan City of Bari, in the Puglia region of Southern Italy.\n\nThe official coat of arms of Polignano a Mare features a shield that is horizontally divided. The top blue half contains a golden crescent moon, while the bottom golden half displays a dark-colored sea creature, which has been identified as a marine falcon or a crab in different descriptions. This closely matches the central shield depicted in the provided image.\n\nPolignano a Mare is a historic town situated on the Adriatic coast, known for its dramatic cliffs, sea caves, and a picturesque ancient village. Its local economy relies on tourism, fishing, and agriculture. The area has been settled since prehistoric times and is believed to be the site of the ancient Greek city of Neapolis of Apulia. The town is also famous as the birthplace of the renowned singer Domenico Modugno, famous for the song \"Volare\".\n\nWhile the core elements of the shield in the image match that of Polignano a Mare, the crown and the surrounding olive and oak branches in the provided picture are artistic embellishments. Official versions of the city's coat of arms may feature different crowns or wreaths.\n\n<<<Polignano a Mare>>>"
