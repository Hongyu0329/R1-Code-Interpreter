    "The accurate Roman numeral for the circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, is **vii°/V**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the analysis:\n*   **Key Signature:** The piece is in D minor.\n*   **Circled Notes:** The notes circled in measure 8 are G#, B, and D. This combination of notes forms a G-sharp diminished triad (G#°).\n*   **Harmonic Function:** In the key of D minor, the dominant chord (V) is A major. The chord G#° acts as the leading-tone triad to this A major chord. The leading tone is the note a half-step below the root of the target chord, in this case, G# is the leading tone to A.\n*   **Roman Numeral Notation:** A leading-tone diminished triad is represented by the Roman numeral vii°. Since this particular chord is functioning as the leading tone to the dominant (V) chord, it is referred to as a secondary or applied leading-tone chord. This relationship is notated by using a slash, resulting in the final Roman numeral: **vii°/V** (read as \"seven diminished of five\"). The measure resolves to the dominant (A major) in the following beat, confirming this harmonic analysis.\n\n<<<vii°/V>>>"
