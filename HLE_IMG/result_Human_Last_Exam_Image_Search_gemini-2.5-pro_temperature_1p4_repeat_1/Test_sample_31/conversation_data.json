    "The knot in the picture is identified as the **8₁₈ knot** by comparing its diagram with knot tables. The number 8 indicates that it is a knot with a crossing number of 8, and the subscript 18 is its index in the Rolfsen table of knots.\n\nThe Rasmussen s-invariant is a powerful tool in knot theory that provides information about the topology of the knot. For the 8₁₈ knot, the **Rasmussen s-invariant is 0**. This value is derived from the knot's Khovanov homology, which is a more complex algebraic structure associated with the knot.\n\nThe 8₁₈ knot has a variety of interesting properties. For instance, it can be created by tightly folding a flat ribbon into a heptagonal shape. It is also recognized for its use as a decorative \"Hungarian Knot\" in French military uniforms.\n\n<<<0>>>"
