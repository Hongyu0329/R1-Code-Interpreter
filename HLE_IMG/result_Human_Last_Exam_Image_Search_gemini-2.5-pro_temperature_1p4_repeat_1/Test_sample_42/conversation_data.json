    "Based on the visual evidence and search results, the icon depicts **Saint Simeon Stylites**.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n*   A reverse image search and searching for icons with similar features frequently lead to images identified as Saint Simeon Stylites.\n*   Specifically, this fresco is located in the **Studenica Monastery** in Serbia, a UNESCO World Heritage site founded in the late 12th century by Stefan Nemanja (who later became Saint Simeon the Myrrh-bearer).\n*   While Saint Simeon Stylites is famous for living on a pillar, he is not always depicted that way in iconography, especially in group frescoes or bust-length portraits. The key identifiers are his elderly appearance, long beard, and monastic clothing.\n*   The fresco in question is specifically of Saint Simeon the Stylite (the Pillar-dweller), not to be confused with the monastery's founder, Saint Simeon the Myrrh-bearer (Stefan Nemanja). The monastery contains frescoes of both, among many other saints.\n*   The other saints listed have different common iconographic representations. For example, Saint Anthony and Saint Macarius are also ancient desert monks but this specific face and style is identified in art historical sources as Simeon Stylites. Moses is from the Old Testament and depicted differently, while Saint Seraphim of Sarov is a much later Russian saint with a different typical portrayal.\n\nTherefore, the figure in the icon is Saint Simeon Stylites.\n\n<<<F>>>"
