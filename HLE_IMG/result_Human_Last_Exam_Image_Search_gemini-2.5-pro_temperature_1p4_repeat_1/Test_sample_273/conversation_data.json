    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we must assign the configuration (R or S) to each of its three chiral centers using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\nFirst, let's identify the chiral centers and the parent carbon chain. The longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional group (the hydroxyl group, -OH) is a pentane chain. Numbering from the left end gives the hydroxyl group the number 2 position. Thus, the parent name is **pentan-2-ol**.\n\nThe chiral centers are at positions C2, C3, and C4 of this chain.\n\n1.  **Configuration at C2 (the carbon with the -OH group):**\n    *   **Assign priorities:** The groups attached to C2 are -OH, the rest of the carbon chain starting with C3, -CH3, and an implicit -H.\n        1.  -OH (highest atomic number)\n        2.  -C3 (carbon attached to other carbons)\n        3.  -CH3 (carbon attached only to hydrogens)\n        4.  -H (lowest atomic number)\n    *   **Determine configuration:** The drawing shows the -OH group on a wedge (coming out of the page) and the -CH3 group on a dash (going into the page). For a tetrahedral carbon, this implies the -H is in the plane. To determine the configuration, we can visualize looking down the C-H bond (priority 4). From this viewpoint, the arrangement of priorities 1, 2, and 3 (-OH, -C3, -CH3) is counter-clockwise.\n    *   **Result for C2:** The configuration is **S**.\n\n2.  **Configuration at C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group):**\n    *   **Assign priorities:** The groups attached to C3 are the C2 part of the chain, the C4 part of the chain, an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), and an implicit -H.\n        1.  -C2 (this carbon is bonded to an oxygen)\n        2.  -C4 (this carbon is bonded to a nitrogen and two other carbons)\n        3.  -CH2CH3 (ethyl group)\n        4.  -H\n    *   **Determine configuration:** The ethyl group is on a wedge (out of the page), implying the -H is on a dash (into the page). With the lowest priority group (-H) pointing away, we trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3. This path (-C2 to -C4 to -Ethyl) is clockwise.\n    *   **Result for C3:** The configuration is **R**.\n\n3.  **Configuration at C4 (the carbon with the methyl and aminomethyl groups):**\n    *   **Assign priorities:** The groups attached to C4 are the C3 part of the chain, a -CH2NH2 group, a -CH3 group, and an implicit -H.\n        1.  -C3 (part of the main chain)\n        2.  -CH2NH2 (the carbon is bonded to nitrogen)\n        3.  -CH3\n        4.  -H\n    *   **Determine configuration:** The -CH3 group is on a dash (into the page), which means the implicit -H must be on a wedge (out of the page). We trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (-C3 to -CH2NH2 to -CH3), which is clockwise. However, since the lowest priority group (-H) is pointing towards us, we must reverse the result.\n    *   **Result for C4:** Clockwise (R) is reversed to **S**.\n\nCombining the configurations for all chiral centers, we get the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n<<<(2S, 3R, 4S)>>>"
