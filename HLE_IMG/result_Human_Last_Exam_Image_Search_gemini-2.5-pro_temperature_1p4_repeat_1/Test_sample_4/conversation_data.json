    "The knot in the image is known as the 9₄₂ knot. Its Jones polynomial, denoted as V(t), is:\n\nt⁻⁴ - t⁻³ + t⁻² - t⁻¹ + 1 - t + t² - t³ + t⁴\n\nAn interesting characteristic of the 9₄₂ knot is that it is non-amphichiral, meaning it is not equivalent to its mirror image. However, its Jones polynomial is the same as that of its mirror image, which is unusual as the Jones polynomial can typically distinguish between a knot and its mirror image.\n\n<<<t⁴ - t³ + t² - t + 1 - t⁻¹ + t⁻² - t⁻³ + t⁻⁴>>>"
