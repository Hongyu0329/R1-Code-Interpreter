    "The reaction proceeds in three steps:\n\n1.  **PMB Deprotection:** The starting material is a bicyclic amide with a *p*-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group on the nitrogen atom. The first step uses ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) in aqueous acetonitrile (ACN/H₂O). CAN is a strong oxidizing agent commonly used for the removal of PMB protecting groups. This reaction cleaves the PMB group from the nitrogen, replacing it with a hydrogen atom, to form **Intermediate 1**.\n    *   Starting Material Formula: C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂\n    *   Change: Removal of PMB group (C₈H₉O) and addition of H. Net change: -C₈H₈O.\n    *   Intermediate 1 Formula: C₇H₆F₃NO\n\n2.  **Hydrogenation:** The second step involves catalytic hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂) in methanol (MeOH). This is a standard procedure for the reduction of a carbon-carbon double bond to a single bond. The alkene in Intermediate 1 is reduced, adding two hydrogen atoms across the double bond to yield **Intermediate 2**.\n    *   Intermediate 1 Formula: C₇H₆F₃NO\n    *   Change: Addition of H₂.\n    *   Intermediate 2 Formula: C₇H₈F₃NO\n\n3.  **Hydrolysis:** The final step is the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the lactam (a cyclic amide) in Intermediate 2. The reaction is carried out with 4 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 70 °C. Acid hydrolysis cleaves the amide bond within the bicyclic system by adding one molecule of water (H₂O). This opens the ring to form a substituted aminocyclopentane carboxylic acid as the final **Product**.\n    *   Intermediate 2 Formula: C₇H₈F₃NO\n    *   Change: Addition of H₂O.\n    *   Product Formula: C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the final product is determined by adding the atoms of water to the molecular formula of Intermediate 2.\n\n<<<C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂>>>"
