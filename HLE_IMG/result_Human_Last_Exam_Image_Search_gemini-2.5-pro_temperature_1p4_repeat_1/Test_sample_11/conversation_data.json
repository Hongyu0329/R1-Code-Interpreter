    "The flag snippet displays horizontal stripes of black, white, and red from top to bottom. This specific color order is characteristic of several flags, but when considering current sovereign states, it most closely relates to the flags of several Arab nations which use the Pan-Arab colors.\n\nThe flag of Yemen features a simple horizontal tricolor of red, white, and black. The image in the query, however, shows black, white, and red. This suggests the flag could be that of Yemen, but displayed upside down, a common element in flag-guessing games.\n\nOther prominent flags with similar colors include those of Egypt and Syria. The flag of Egypt consists of red, white, and black horizontal bands, with the national emblem, the Eagle of Saladin, in the center of the white band. The flag of Syria also uses a red, white, and black tricolor, but is distinguished by two green stars in the middle white stripe. Since the snippet is from a corner and shows only plain stripes, these flags are possibilities, though the color order in the snippet (starting with black) does not match.\n\nHistorically, a black, white, and red horizontal tricolor was the flag of the German Empire from 1871 to 1918. However, modern flag quizzes typically focus on contemporary nations.\n\nGiven the common use of the red, white, and black tricolor in the Arab world, and the frequency of Yemen in such quizzes, it is the most probable answer, despite the inverted color order in the image.\n\n<<<Yemen>>>"
