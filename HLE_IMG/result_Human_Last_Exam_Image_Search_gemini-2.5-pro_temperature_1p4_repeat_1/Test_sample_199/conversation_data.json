    "The object in the image is a large, ornate electrostatic generator. This specific instrument is the famous large electrostatic generator of the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, Netherlands.\n\nThis massive device was designed by Martin van Marum and constructed by John Cuthbertson in 1784. It operates by friction: the hand crank turns two large glass disks, each 1.65 meters in diameter. As the disks rotate, they rub against leather cushions, which generates a large amount of static electricity. This charge is then collected by metal combs and stored in large conductors or, originally, massive batteries of Leyden jars. The machine was capable of producing potentials up to 330,000 volts, creating sparks over 60 cm long.\n\nElectrostatic generators like this were fundamental instruments in the 18th century for the new science of electricity, used for both research and public demonstrations. This particular generator is the largest of its kind in the world and remains the centerpiece of the Teylers Museum's instrument room.\n\n<<<B>>>"
