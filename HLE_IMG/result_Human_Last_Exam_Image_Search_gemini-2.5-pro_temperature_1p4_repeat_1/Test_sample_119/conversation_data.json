    "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectra (Mass Spectrometry, IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, DEPT-135, and HSQC), the compound is identified as **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n### Spectroscopic Analysis Breakdown:\n\n*   **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** The molecular ion peak at m/z 135 indicates a molecular weight of 135 g/mol. The odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms (typically one), which leads to a likely molecular formula of C₉H₁₃N.\n*   **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:** The spectrum shows absorptions characteristic of N-H stretching (around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹, indicating a primary or secondary amine), aromatic C-H stretching (~3030 cm⁻¹), aliphatic C-H stretching (~2960 cm⁻¹), and aromatic C=C double bond stretching (~1600, 1495, 1450 cm⁻¹). The absence of a strong peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ rules out a carbonyl group.\n*   **¹³C NMR Spectroscopy:** Seven distinct carbon signals are observed:\n    *   **Aromatic region:** 145.1 ppm (quaternary C, ipso-carbon attached to the propyl chain), 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm (aromatic CH carbons).\n    *   **Aliphatic region:** 49.6 ppm (CH group attached to nitrogen), 43.5 ppm (CH₂ group), and 19.2 ppm (CH₃ group).\n*   **DEPT-135:** The spectrum shows one negative signal (indicating one CH₂ group) and five positive signals (three aromatic CH groups, one aliphatic CH group, and one CH₃ group). The quaternary carbon at 145.1 ppm is absent, as expected. This data perfectly matches the proposed structure.\n*   **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:** The spectrum displays signals for:\n    *   **~7.2 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** Protons of the monosubstituted phenyl ring.\n    *   **~2.8 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** Protons of the benzylic methylene group (-CH₂-Ph).\n    *   **~2.7 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** Proton of the methine group (-CH-NH₂).\n    *   **~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H):** Protons of the methyl group (-CH₃), split by the adjacent CH proton.\n    The two protons of the -NH₂ group are likely exchanged or broadened, and their signal may be integrated within the baseline.\n*   **HSQC Spectroscopy:** This 2D spectrum confirms the connectivity between protons and their directly attached carbons:\n    *   The proton at ~1.2 ppm correlates with the carbon at ~19 ppm (CH₃ group).\n    *   The protons at ~2.8 ppm correlate with the carbon at ~43 ppm (CH₂ group).\n    *   The proton at ~2.7 ppm correlates with the carbon at ~50 ppm (CH-N group).\n    *   The aromatic protons (~7.2 ppm) correlate with the aromatic carbons (~126-129 ppm).\n\nAll spectroscopic evidence consistently supports the structure of 1-phenylpropan-2-amine, which is the IUPAC name for the compound commonly known as amphetamine.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
