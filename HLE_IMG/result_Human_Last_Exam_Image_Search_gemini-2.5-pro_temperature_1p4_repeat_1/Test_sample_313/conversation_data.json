    "The two clues provided point to the term \"Hat Trick.\"\n\nThe image displays an event from the world of ice hockey. Pictured are Andrei Vasilevskiy of the Tampa Bay Lightning receiving the Vezina Trophy for the league's best goaltender at the 2019 NHL Awards. The event took place on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas. In ice hockey, a \"hat trick\" is a significant achievement where a player scores three goals in a single game.\n\nThe second clue refers to a process that has been largely discontinued due to the toxicity of mercury salts. This alludes to the history of felt hat manufacturing. In the 18th and 19th centuries, mercuric nitrate was used to treat fur for making felt hats. This process, known as \"carroting,\" exposed hat makers to mercury vapors, leading to a neurological disorder called \"mad hatter disease,\" characterized by symptoms like tremors and psychosis. The use of mercury in hat making was banned in the United States in 1941.\n\nThe term \"hat trick\" originated in the sport of cricket in 1858 when a bowler who took three wickets on three consecutive balls was rewarded with a new hat from his club. The hats of that era were often the same felt hats produced with the now-banned toxic mercury process.\n\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
