    "The style of the altarpiece detail, a glazed terracotta relief with a surrounding garland of fruit and flowers, is characteristic of the Della Robbia workshop, a prominent family of artists in Renaissance Florence. The founder of the workshop, Luca della Robbia, invented the unique glazed terracotta technique. The business was later inherited and continued by his nephew, Andrea della Robbia, and subsequently by Andrea's son, Giovanni della Robbia.\n\nThe specific work, a roundel depicting the Sacrament of the Altar, is attributed to Andrea della Robbia. Similar works, such as glazed terracotta ciboriums and other religious scenes, are credited to him and his workshop.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
