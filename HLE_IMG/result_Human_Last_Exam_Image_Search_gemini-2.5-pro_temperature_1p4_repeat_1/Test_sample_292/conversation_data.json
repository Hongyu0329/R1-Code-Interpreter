    "This picture was taken in **Chicago**.\n\nThe photograph shows the interior of the **McCormick Place Lakeside Center**, which is part of the largest convention center in North America. In the summer of 2024, the building's extensive glass surfaces were retrofitted with a bird-friendly film featuring a distinct pattern of white dots. This measure was implemented to prevent bird collisions, a significant issue at this location.\n\nThe $1.2 million project involved applying the dotted film to approximately 120,000 square feet of glass. The installation was a response to a major incident in October 2023, where nearly 1,000 birds died in a single day from striking the building's windows. The new film makes the glass visible to birds, and data has already shown a significant decrease in bird collision deaths since its installation. The project was completed ahead of the fall 2024 bird migration season.\n\n<<<Chicago>>>"
