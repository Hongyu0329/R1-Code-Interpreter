    "On October 12, 2023, the musical group Black Veil Brides performed as part of their co-headlining \"BVB & VV: TOUR 2023\" with Ville Valo. However, this performance took place at the Grey Eagle Event Centre in Calgary, Canada, not at The Cotillion in Wichita, Kansas.\n\nThe tour schedule for Black Veil Brides in October 2023 included dates in Edmonton on October 11th, Vancouver on October 14th, and Spokane on October 15th, making a performance in Wichita on October 12th geographically and logistically improbable.\n\nA review of past events at The Cotillion in Wichita does not show any performance scheduled for October 12, 2023. While the venue has hosted a variety of concerts, including one by Kevin Gates on October 20, 2023, there is no record of an event on the date in question.\n\nTherefore, based on available information, no musical artist played at The Cotillion in Wichita on October 12, 2023.\n\n<<<No musical artist played at The Cotillion on October 12, 2023.>>>"
