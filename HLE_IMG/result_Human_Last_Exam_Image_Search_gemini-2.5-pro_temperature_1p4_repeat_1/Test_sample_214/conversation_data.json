    "The sequence of erasure poems in \"The Other Clouds\" by Mary Jo Bang adheres to the poetic form of the **tanka**.\n\nA tanka is a Japanese form of poetry consisting of five lines with a specific syllable structure. While traditionally written in a single unbroken line in Japanese, the English version is typically broken into five lines. The form is characterized by the following syllable count per line:\n*   **Line 1:** 5 syllables\n*   **Line 2:** 7 syllables\n*   **Line 3:** 5 syllables\n*   **Line 4:** 7 syllables\n*   **Line 5:** 7 syllables\n\nThe first three lines are known as the *kami-no-ku* (upper phrase) and typically present a description or image. The third line often acts as a \"pivot,\" leading into the final two lines, the *shimo-no-ku* (lower phrase), which offer a reflection or emotional response to the initial image.\n\nAlthough your question mentions a \"four-line stanza,\" scholarly reviews of Mary Jo Bang's book *A Doll for Throwing*, which contains \"The Other Clouds\" sequence, state that these specific erasure poems are \"all cast in the form of a tanka.\" It is common for poets writing in English to use the five-line structure of the tanka with some flexibility in the syllable count.\n\n<<<Tanka>>>"
