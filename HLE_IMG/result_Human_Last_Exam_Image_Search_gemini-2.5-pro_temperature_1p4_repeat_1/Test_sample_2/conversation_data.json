    "To determine the time complexity of the given sorting algorithm, we can analyze its recursive structure.\n\n### Algorithm Analysis\n\nThe provided pseudocode is:\n```python\ndef sort(a, n):\n  if n > 1:\n    # 1. First recursive call\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n\n    # 2. Comparison and potential swap\n    if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n      swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])\n\n    # 3. Second recursive call\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n```\n\nLet's define `T(n)` as the time complexity for an input of size `n`.\n\n1.  **Base Case:** When `n` is 1 or less, the function does nothing. This takes constant time, `O(1)`.\n2.  **Recursive Step:** When `n > 1`, the function performs three main operations:\n    *   It calls itself with an input of size `n - 1`. This contributes `T(n - 1)` to the complexity.\n    *   It performs a comparison and an optional swap. These are constant time operations, `O(1)`.\n    *   It calls itself again with an input of size `n - 1`. This contributes another `T(n - 1)` to the complexity.\n\n### Recurrence Relation\n\nCombining these parts, we can write the recurrence relation for the time complexity:\n\n`T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + O(1)`\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant)\n\nThis relation shows that for each increase in problem size by one, the amount of work roughly doubles. This is characteristic of an exponential growth pattern.\n\nLet's expand the recurrence to see the pattern:\n*   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n*   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n*   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n*   ...\n*   After `k` steps: `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + (2^k - 1) * c`\n\nTo reach the base case `T(1)`, we set `k = n - 1`:\n`T(n) = 2^(n - 1) * T(1) + (2^(n - 1) - 1) * c`\n\nAs `n` becomes large, the dominant term is `2^(n - 1)`, which is proportional to `2^n`. Therefore, the time complexity is `O(2^n)`. The recursive calls form a binary tree of depth `n`, leading to exponential complexity.\n\nThe worst case occurs when the swap is performed at each step (e.g., a reverse-sorted array), ensuring both recursive calls are always executed.\n\nComparing this to the given options:\nA. O(n)\nB. O(n log n)\nC. O(n^2)\nD. O(n^3)\nE. O(2^n)\nF. does not terminate\n\nThe analysis correctly identifies the complexity as `O(2^n)`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
