    "The jazz standard in the provided image is titled \"Stablemates\" and was composed by Benny Golson. The sheet music displays the characteristic melody and chord progression of this piece.\n\nKey features identifiable in the score are its F minor key signature, the unique opening chord sequence of F-, E-7b5, Eb-6, and the melodic line that aligns with Golson's composition. The bridge, which modulates to Ab major, is also a hallmark of \"Stablemates.\" The presence of minor ii-V-I progressions and specific chords like the minor 7b5 further confirms the piece's identity.\n\n<<<Stablemates by Benny Golson>>>"
