    "The scene depicted on the Attic red-figure pelike (a type of jar) is a well-known mythological event: the abduction of Tithonus by Eos.\n\nThe figure leaving in the chariot is **Eos**, the winged goddess of the dawn. She is driving the chariot and carrying away her mortal lover, **Tithonus**, a Trojan prince, whom she has seized. The figure being lifted into the chariot is Tithonus.\n\nThe confusion in the question \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\" may arise because no one is depicted literally exiting the vehicle. Instead, Eos is piloting the chariot away from the ground, effectively \"leaving\" the scene with Tithonus, who is \"leaving\" his mortal life behind. Scenes of Eos pursuing or abducting youths became a popular theme on 5th-century Athenian vases.\n\nThe key figures in the scene are:\n*   **Eos:** The winged goddess driving the chariot.\n*   **Tithonus:** The mortal youth being held and abducted by Eos.\n*   **Fallen Man:** An unidentified figure lying on the ground below the chariot.\n\nAccording to the myth, Eos fell in love with Tithonus and asked Zeus to grant him immortality. However, she forgot to ask for eternal youth, so Tithonus lived forever but withered with age. This vase captures the beginning of their story, the moment of abduction.\n\n<<<Tithonus>>>"
