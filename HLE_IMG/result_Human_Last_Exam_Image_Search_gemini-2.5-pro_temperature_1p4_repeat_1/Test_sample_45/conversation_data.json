    "The tiling pattern in the image displays **10-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\nBy examining the center of the provided image, a clear, repeating motif is visible. This central motif, and indeed the entire visible patch, can be rotated by 36 degrees (360/10) around its central point and appear unchanged. This type of symmetry, where five-fold or ten-fold rotations are present, is a hallmark of quasicrystalline structures, often referred to as Penrose tilings.\n\nThe pattern is constructed from a set of geometric shapes, including decagons (10-sided polygons), pentagons (5-sided polygons), and rhombi, which fit together in a non-repeating, or aperiodic, manner. While traditional crystals are restricted to 2, 3, 4, and 6-fold symmetries, quasicrystals can exhibit these \"forbidden\" symmetries. The specific arrangement in the image, with its decagonal and pentagonal shapes, is characteristic of tilings that produce a ten-fold symmetric diffraction pattern.\n\n<<<10-fold>>>"
