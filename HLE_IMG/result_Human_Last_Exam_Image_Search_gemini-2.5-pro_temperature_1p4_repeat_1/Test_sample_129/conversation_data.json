    "The protein depicted in the image is **Hen Egg-White Lysozyme**.\n\nThis enzyme is a classic example used in biochemistry and structural biology. It is a relatively small protein, consisting of 129 amino acids, and its structure has been extensively studied. Hen egg-white lysozyme is known for its antibacterial properties, as it catalyzes the breakdown of polysaccharides found in the cell walls of many bacteria.\n\nKey structural features of hen egg-white lysozyme include:\n*   A compact, globular shape composed of two domains.\n*   A mix of secondary structures, including alpha-helices and beta-sheets.\n*   A prominent active site cleft that binds to carbohydrate substrates.\n*   Four stabilizing disulfide bridges.\n\nThe specific representation in the image is likely from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), with an entry ID such as 1HEL or 1HEW. The different coloring of the chain, with a light blue segment, often serves to highlight specific regions of the protein, such as the N-terminus. The small yellow structure visible in the active site cleft is likely a bound inhibitor molecule.\n\n<<<Hen Egg-White Lysozyme>>>"
