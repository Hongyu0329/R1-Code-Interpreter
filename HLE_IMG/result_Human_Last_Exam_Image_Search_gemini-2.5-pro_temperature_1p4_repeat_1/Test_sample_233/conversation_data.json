    "The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image fragment is identified as **Sö 179**, also known as the Gripsholm Runestone. This identification is confirmed by comparing the visible runes in the provided image with the full inscription of Sö 179.\n\nThe Gripsholm Runestone is one of approximately 26 Ingvar runestones, which were raised to commemorate those who died during a Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled between 1036 and 1041. This particular stone was raised by a woman named Tóla in memory of her son Harald, who was Ingvar's brother.\n\nThe full inscription reads: \"Tóla had this stone raised in memory of her son Haraldr, Ingvarr's brother. They travelled valiantly far for gold, and in the east gave (food) to the eagle. (They) died in the south in Serkland.\" The phrase \"gave food to the eagle\" is a kenning, or a poetic Norse metaphor, for winning a battle.\n\nDiscovered in the early 1820s, the runestone was being used as a threshold in the cellar of the \"theatre tower\" at Gripsholm Castle. It remained there for about a century before being retrieved and fully deciphered. Today, it stands beside the driveway of Gripsholm Castle. The stone is notable for its lengthy inscription in the *fornyrðislag* poetic meter and its relatively simple ornamentation.\n\n<<<Sö 179>>>"
