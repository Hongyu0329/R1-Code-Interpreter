    "Based on a detailed analysis of the provided mass spectrum, the compound is identified as a chlorinated derivative of dichlorodiphenyl-dichloroethane (DDD).\n\n**Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n\n1.  **Molecular Ion (M⁺) Region:** The highest significant mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) cluster appears around m/z 318-322. However, the spectrum shown stops at m/z 280, and the table lists peaks up to m/z 268. This indicates the spectrum might not be showing the molecular ion, which is common for some compounds that fragment easily. The most intense peaks in the high-mass region are at m/z 260, 262, and 264.\n\n2.  **Base Peak:** The most intense peak (base peak) in the spectrum is at **m/z 225**, with a relative intensity of 100%.\n\n3.  **Key Fragmentation Pattern:** A very common fragmentation pathway for chlorinated pesticides like DDT and its metabolites involves the loss of a chloromethyl or dichloromethyl group. The most telling feature in this spectrum is the very intense base peak at m/z 225. Let's analyze the isotopic pattern around this peak:\n    *   m/z 225 (Intensity = 100)\n    *   m/z 227 (Intensity = 66.7)\n    This ~3:2 ratio (100:66.7) is characteristic of a fragment containing two chlorine atoms.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Compound:** The spectrum strongly matches that of **o,p'-DDD**, a metabolite of the pesticide DDT.\n    *   **Structure:** o,p'-DDD has a chemical structure where one chlorine is on the ortho-position of one phenyl ring and another is on the para-position of the other phenyl ring.\n    *   **Formula:** The chemical formula is C₁₄H₁₀Cl₄.\n    *   **Molecular Weight:** The molecular weight is approximately 320 g/mol. The molecular ion is not visible in the provided spectrum, which is characteristic for this compound under electron ionization.\n\n5.  **Fragmentation Explained:**\n    *   The base peak at **m/z 225** corresponds to the loss of the dichloromethyl group (-CHCl₂) from the parent molecule, a characteristic fragmentation for DDD isomers.\n    *   The significant peak at **m/z 190** results from the loss of an additional chlorine atom from the m/z 225 fragment. The ratio of the peaks at m/z 190 (I=48.4) and m/z 192 (I=24.5) is approximately 2:1, which, while not a perfect 3:1, is indicative of a fragment with one remaining chlorine atom.\n    *   Other prominent peaks, such as **m/z 118** and **m/z 141**, are also consistent with the fragmentation of the o,p'-DDD structure.\n\n**IUPAC Name:**\n\nThe systematic IUPAC name for the identified compound, o,p'-DDD, is **1-chloro-2-[2,2-dichloro-1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl]benzene**.\n\n<<<1-chloro-2-[2,2-dichloro-1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl]benzene>>>"
