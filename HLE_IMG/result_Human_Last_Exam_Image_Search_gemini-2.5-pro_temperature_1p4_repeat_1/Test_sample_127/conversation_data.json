    "To determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely, we must analyze the steric hindrance around the single bond that connects each phenyl ring to the main molecular framework. Free rotation occurs when the energy barrier to rotation is low, which is generally not the case when bulky groups are positioned near the bond axis.\n\n1.  **Ring H and Ring K:** Ring H is attached to carbon C4 of ring A, and ring K is attached to the adjacent carbon C5 of ring A. The proximity of these two bulky phenyl groups (H and K) to each other creates significant steric clash. This type of 1,2-disubstitution with bulky groups severely restricts rotation around their respective bonds to ring A. Therefore, neither ring H nor ring K can rotate freely.\n\n2.  **Ring J and Ring L:** A similar situation exists for rings J and L. Ring J is attached to carbon C4 of ring C, and ring L is attached to the adjacent carbon C5 of ring C. These two phenyl groups are also adjacent to each other, leading to high steric hindrance that prevents free rotation for both J and L.\n\n3.  **Ring K and Ring L additional hindrance:** In addition to the hindrance from the adjacent phenyl groups (H and J respectively), rings K and L are also attached to carbons (C5 on A and C5 on C) that are adjacent to the carbons (C6 on A and C6 on C) coordinated to the central Iridium atom. The bulky coordination sphere of the Iridium atom provides another major steric barrier, further preventing the rotation of rings K and L.\n\n4.  **Ring G:** Ring G is attached to carbon C6 of ring F. This position is *ortho* (adjacent) to the nitrogen atom (N1 of ring F) that is coordinated to the Iridium center. The rotation of ring G would cause its ortho hydrogens to sweep past the coordinating nitrogen and clash with the very crowded environment around the Iridium atom, including parts of the other ligands (like ligand E). Introducing substituents at the ortho-position of a coordinating pyridine or bipyridine ligand is a known strategy to create rigid ligands with locked conformations due to steric hindrance with the metal center and other ligands. This phenomenon is often referred to as atropisomerism, which occurs when rotation around a single bond is so hindered that different rotational isomers can be isolated. Therefore, ring G cannot rotate freely.\n\nBased on this analysis, all five phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, and L) are subject to significant steric hindrance that prevents free rotation.\n\n<<<N>>>"
