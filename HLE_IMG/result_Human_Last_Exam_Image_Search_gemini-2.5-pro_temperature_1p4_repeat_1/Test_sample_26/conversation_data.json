    "The correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata is **V⁷** (a dominant seventh chord).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the analysis:\n*   **Key Signature:** The movement is in C minor.\n*   **Notes in Measure 30:** The notes played in this measure are G, B-natural, D, and F. The G is the root, the B-natural is the major third (which is the leading tone to the tonic, C), the D is the perfect fifth, and the F is the minor seventh.\n*   **Chord Identification:** These notes together form a G dominant seventh chord (G7).\n*   **Harmonic Function:** In the key of C minor, the fifth scale degree (the dominant) is G. A dominant seventh chord is built on this fifth degree. Therefore, the chord functions as the dominant seventh of the home key. Some analyses also point to the use of an augmented 6th chord in the vicinity, specifically at measure 30.\n\n<<<V⁷>>>"
