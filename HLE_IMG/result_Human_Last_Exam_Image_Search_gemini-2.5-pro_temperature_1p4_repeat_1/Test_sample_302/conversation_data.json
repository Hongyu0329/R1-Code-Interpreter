    "The four characters on the seal, written in traditional seal script (篆書), are read from top to bottom and right to left.\n\nThe characters are **景德不孤**.\n\nIn simplified Chinese, they are written as **景德不孤 (jǐng dé bù gū)**.\n\nThis phrase can be translated as \"Great virtue is not alone.\" It is likely an allusion to a famous saying by Confucius from the Analects, \"德不孤，必有邻\" (dé bù gū, bì yǒu lín), which means \"Virtue is not left to stand alone; it is sure to have neighbors.\" The seal's inscription, therefore, carries a positive and scholarly connotation, suggesting that a person of great virtue will naturally attract like-minded companions.\n\n<<<景德不孤>>>"
