    "Based on the transformations shown in the chemical reaction scheme:\n\n**Step 1: Conversion of Compound 1 to Compound 2**\n\n*   Compound **1** is a trioxatriangulenium cation, a type of stable carbocation with three fused pyrylium-like rings.\n*   Compound **2** is formed by replacing one of the oxygen atoms in a five-membered ring of compound **1** with a nitrogen atom that is part of an amino group (-NH2). This type of reaction, where a pyrylium salt is converted into an N-substituted pyridinium salt, is achieved by reacting it with a primary amine or a similar nitrogen nucleophile.\n*   To introduce an N-NH2 group, the required reagent is **hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂)**.\n\nTherefore, **Reagent A is hydrazine**.\n\n**Step 2: Conversion of Compound 2 to Compound 3**\n\n*   This step involves two changes to the molecule:\n    1.  A second pyrylium-like ring in compound **2** (the one on the top right) is converted into an N-propyl pyridinium ring. This requires a reaction with **n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)**.\n    2.  The N-amino group (N-NH₂) on the first nitrogen atom is converted into an N-H group. This is a deamination reaction.\n*   While deamination often requires specific reagents, it can sometimes be accomplished by heating N-aminopyridinium salts under certain conditions. It is plausible that the reaction conditions required for the substitution with n-propylamine (likely heating) also cause the elimination of the amino group.\n*   Thus, the primary reagent responsible for the main structural change from 2 to 3 is n-propylamine.\n\nTherefore, **Reagent B is n-propylamine**.\n\n<<<A is Hydrazine (N₂H₄) and B is n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)>>>"
