    "Based on the rules of a 4x4 Kenken puzzle, each row and column must contain the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 exactly once. Therefore, regardless of the specific arrangement of the cages, the top horizontal line of the solved puzzle must contain the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nIt is important to note that the provided Kenken puzzle image is flawed as it contains cages with mathematically impossible clues for a standard 4x4 grid (e.g., a two-cell cage adding to \"8+\", and a two-cell cage adding to \"2+\"). Such a puzzle cannot be solved. However, the question asks for the numbers that would be present on the top line after a puzzle is solved, which for any valid 4x4 puzzle are always the same.\n\nThe four numbers present on the top horizontal line are 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n<<<1234>>>"
