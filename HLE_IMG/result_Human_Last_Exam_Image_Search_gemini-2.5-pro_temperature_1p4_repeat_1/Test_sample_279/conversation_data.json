    "Based on its location, the lesion shown in the image corresponds to a G.V. Black Class I caries.\n\nThe image displays a molar with a dark, metallic restoration, likely an amalgam filling. Surrounding this filling, there is evidence of new decay. This condition is known as secondary or recurrent caries. The classification of a carious lesion, however, is determined by its anatomical location.\n\nAccording to the G.V. Black classification system, the most influential system for categorizing cavities, a Class I lesion is defined as decay that occurs in the pits and fissures of the occlusal (biting) surfaces of posterior teeth (molars and premolars). Since the decay in the picture, including the original filled cavity and the new secondary decay, is located on the occlusal surface of the molar, it is classified as a Class I lesion.\n\n<<<Class I>>>"
