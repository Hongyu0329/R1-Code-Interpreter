    "Based on the visual analysis of the four rock specimens and the information gathered from the search results, the following identifications can be made:\n\n**Specimen H: Scoria**\nThis specimen is reddish-brown and highly vesicular, with many visible holes. This appearance is characteristic of scoria, an extrusive igneous rock. Scoria forms when gas-rich lava erupts and cools quickly, trapping gas bubbles within the rock. Its color can range from black or dark gray to a deep reddish-brown. Scoria is denser than pumice and will sink in water.\n\n**Specimen I: Breccia**\nThis rock is composed of large, angular fragments of other rocks cemented together. This is the defining characteristic of breccia, a clastic sedimentary rock. The fragments in breccia have not been transported far from their source, which is why they retain their sharp edges. Breccias can have a variety of compositions depending on the source of the rock fragments.\n\n**Specimen J: Pumice**\nThis is a light-colored, very porous rock with a frothy appearance. This is consistent with pumice, a volcanic rock known for its low density. Pumice is formed from felsic magmas and cools so rapidly that the atoms do not have time to form crystals, resulting in a glassy texture. It contains a high concentration of trapped gas bubbles, which makes it very lightweight and capable of floating on water.\n\n**Specimen K: Pegmatite**\nThis specimen is a coarse-grained igneous rock with very large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible. This texture is characteristic of pegmatite. Pegmatites are typically granitic in composition, consisting mainly of quartz, feldspar, and mica, but are distinguished by their exceptionally large crystals. The large crystals form during the final stages of magma crystallization from a water-rich residual melt, which allows the mineral components to move rapidly and form large crystals.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
