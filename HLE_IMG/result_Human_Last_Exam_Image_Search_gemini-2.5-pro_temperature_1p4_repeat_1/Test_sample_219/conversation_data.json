    "Based on the provided graph, the analysis is as follows:\n\n**1. Identification of Synchronized Bursts:**\nSynchronized bursts are visible as dense vertical lines, indicating that many electrodes are firing at approximately the same time. These are observed at the following approximate timestamps:\n*   Burst 1: Centered around **2 s**\n*   Burst 2: Centered around **18 s**\n*   Burst 3: Centered around **36 s**\n*   Burst 4: Centered around **50 s**\n\n**2. Calculation of Inter-Burst Intervals (IBI):**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time between the start of consecutive bursts.\n*   IBI 1 (between Burst 2 and Burst 1): 18 s - 2 s = 16 s\n*   IBI 2 (between Burst 3 and Burst 2): 36 s - 18 s = 18 s\n*   IBI 3 (between Burst 4 and Burst 3): 50 s - 36 s = 14 s\n\n**3. Calculation of Average Inter-Burst Interval:**\nThe average IBI is calculated by summing the individual intervals and dividing by the number of intervals.\n*   Average IBI = (16 s + 18 s + 14 s) / 3\n*   Average IBI = 48 s / 3\n*   Average IBI = 16 s\n\nThe average inter-burst interval, to two significant figures, is 16 s.\n<<<16>>>"
