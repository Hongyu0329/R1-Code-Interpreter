    "The Delaunay triangulation has a fundamental property called the \"empty circle property\". This property states that for any triangle in the triangulation, the unique circle that passes through its three vertices (the circumcircle) must not contain any other points from the set in its interior.\n\nTo solve this problem, we will visually inspect each of the four triangulations (A, B, C, and D) to find a triangle that violates this property.\n\n1.  **Analyze Figure B:** This figure contains a very large triangle formed by the top-most vertex and the two bottom-most vertices.\n2.  **Identify a \"bad\" triangle:** Let's name the vertices of this triangle T.\n3.  **Check for enclosed points:** Visually, the two interior points of the point set lie within the boundaries of triangle T.\n4.  **Apply the empty circle property:** Since the two interior points are inside the triangle T, they must also be inside the circumcircle of T.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The presence of these points inside the circumcircle of triangle T is a clear violation of the empty circle property. Therefore, triangulation B is not a Delaunay triangulation.\n\nThe other figures do not have such an obvious violation. Figure A appears to be a valid Delaunay triangulation. Figure C is technically not a triangulation as it contains a non-triangular (pentagonal) face in the middle. Figure D is more complex, but the violation in B is unequivocal.\n\nThe following Python code mathematically verifies this conclusion by defining the coordinates of the points, calculating the properties of the circumcircle for the suspect triangle in Figure B, and checking if any other points lie within it. The check is performed using a standard determinant method.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef is_in_circumcircle(p1, p2, p3, p_test, triangle_name, point_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if p_test is inside the circumcircle of triangle (p1, p2, p3)\n    using a determinant-based geometric predicate.\n    It prints the matrix and determinant used for the calculation.\n\n    Args:\n        p1, p2, p3: Tuples representing the coordinates of the triangle vertices.\n        p_test: A tuple representing the coordinates of the point to check.\n        triangle_name: A string name for the triangle for printing.\n        point_name: A string name for the test point for printing.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if p_test is inside the circumcircle, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    ax, ay = p1\n    bx, by = p2\n    cx, cy = p3\n    px, py = p_test\n\n    # To ensure the test `det > 0` corresponds to \"inside\", the triangle\n    # vertices must be ordered counter-clockwise (CCW). We check the orientation\n    # and swap two vertices if the order is clockwise.\n    # The orientation is determined by the sign of the 2D cross-product:\n    # (bx-ax)*(cy-ay) - (by-ay)*(cx-ax)\n    orientation = (bx - ax) * (cy - ay) - (by - ay) * (cx - ax)\n    if orientation < 0:  # If clockwise, swap p2 and p3 to make it CCW.\n        p2, p3 = p3, p2\n        bx, by = p2\n        cx, cy = p3\n\n    # The in-circle test is based on the sign of this determinant:\n    # | ax-px  ay-py  (ax-px)²+(ay-py)² |\n    # | bx-px  by-py  (bx-px)²+(by-py)² |\n    # | cx-px  cy-py  (cx-px)²+(cy-py)² |\n    \n    # We calculate each term of the matrix for clarity.\n    m11 = ax - px\n    m12 = ay - py\n    m13 = m11**2 + m12**2\n    \n    m21 = bx - px\n    m22 = by - py\n    m23 = m21**2 + m22**2\n\n    m31 = cx - px\n    m32 = cy - py\n    m33 = m31**2 + m32**2\n    \n    matrix = np.array([\n        [m11, m12, m13],\n        [m21, m22, m23],\n        [m31, m32, m33]\n    ])\n\n    print(f\"Checking if point {point_name}{p_test} is in the circumcircle of triangle {triangle_name}{p1, p2, p3}:\")\n    print(\"The test matrix is constructed using the coordinates of the triangle vertices and the test point:\")\n    print(\"Matrix = [[p1_x-p_x, p1_y-p_y, (p1_x-p_x)²+(p1_y-p_y)²], ...]\")\n    print(\"\\nFor this test, the matrix is:\")\n    print(f\"| {m11:8.2f} {m12:8.2f} {m13:8.2f} |\")\n    print(f\"| {m21:8.2f} {m22:8.2f} {m23:8.2f} |\")\n    print(f\"| {m31:8.2f} {m32:8.2f} {m33:8.2f} |\")\n\n    det_val = np.linalg.det(matrix)\n    print(f\"\\nThe determinant of the matrix is: {det_val:.2f}\")\n\n    if det_val > 0:\n        print(f\"Result: The determinant is positive.
