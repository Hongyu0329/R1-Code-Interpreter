    "To determine which diagram shows a physically valid quantum evolution, we must check if the plotted quantities obey the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics for a two-level system (a qubit).\n\n### Key Physical Principles:\n\n1.  **Range of Expectation Values:** The expectation value of the Pauli Z operator, `<σz>`, must lie within the range of its eigenvalues, which are -1 and +1. Therefore, we must have `-1 ≤ <σz> ≤ 1`.\n\n2.  **State Purity and Bloch Vector:** The state of a qubit can be represented by a Bloch vector `r = (<σx>, <σy>, <σz>)`. The length of this vector, `|r|`, must be less than or equal to 1 (`|r| ≤ 1`). A pure state has `|r| = 1`, while a mixed state has `|r| < 1`. The plotted quantities relate to the length of the Bloch vector by the formula:\n    `|r|² = <σx>² + <σy>² + <σz>² = (2 * |<σ+>|)² + <σz>²`\n    where `|<σ+>|` is the magnitude of the expectation value of the spin-raising operator. Thus, for a physically valid evolution, the condition `(2 * |<σ+>|)² + <σz>² ≤ 1` must hold at all times.\n\n3.  **Von Neumann Entropy (S):** The entropy `S` is a measure of the mixedness of a state. It is related to the length of the Bloch vector `|r|`.\n    *   `S ≥ 0`.\n    *   `S = 0` if and only if the state is pure, which means `|r| = 1`.\n    *   `S` is a monotonically decreasing function of `|r|`. As the state gets more mixed (`|r|` decreases), its entropy `S` increases.\n\n### Analysis of the Plots:\n\nWe will now apply these principles to each diagram. We will focus on the strictest constraints, particularly `|r|² ≤ 1`. We'll test this by picking points from the graphs where the value of `(2 * |<σ+>|)² + <σz>²` is likely to be maximal.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef check_physicality(plot_name, sz, sigplus_abs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given set of expectation values is physically valid.\n    A state is physical if the length of its Bloch vector is not greater than 1.\n    The squared length of the Bloch vector |r|^2 is (2*|<sigma+>|)^2 + <sz>^2.\n    \"\"\"\n    bloch_vector_len_sq = (2 * sigplus_abs)**2 + sz**2\n    is_valid = bloch_vector_len_sq <= 1\n    \n    print(f\"Analyzing Plot {plot_name}:\")\n    print(f\"  At the chosen point, <sz> = {sz}, |<σ+>| = {sigplus_abs}\")\n    print(f\"  Calculated |r|² = (2 * {sigplus_abs})² + {sz}² = {bloch_vector_len_sq:.2f}\")\n    if is_valid:\n        print(\"  The condition |r|² <= 1 is satisfied at this point.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"  VIOLATION: |r|² = {bloch_vector_len_sq:.2f} > 1.
