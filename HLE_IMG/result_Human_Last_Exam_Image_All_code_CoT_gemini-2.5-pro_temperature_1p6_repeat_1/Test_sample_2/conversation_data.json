    "To determine the time complexity of the given sorting algorithm, we will analyze its recursive structure and formulate a recurrence relation.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Case:** The recursion stops when `n <= 1`. In this case, the function does nothing, which takes constant time. Let's denote the time complexity as `T(n)`. So, `T(1) = O(1)`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Recursive Step:** When `n > 1`, the function performs the following operations:\n    *   `sort(a, n - 1)`: A recursive call on a subproblem of size `n - 1`. This takes `T(n - 1)` time.\n    *   `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]: swap(...)`: A comparison and a potential swap. These are constant time operations, `O(1)`.\n    *   `sort(a, n - 1)`: A second recursive call on a subproblem of size `n - 1`. This also takes `T(n - 1)` time.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation:** The total time `T(n)` is the sum of the times for these operations. In the worst-case scenario, the `if` condition is always true, and the second recursive call is always executed.\n    Therefore, the recurrence relation is:\n    `T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1) + T(n - 1)`\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant representing the `O(1)` work).\n\n4.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:** Let's expand the relation to find a pattern:\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    *   `= 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 3c`\n    *   `= 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 7c`\n    *   In general, after `k` steps: `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + (2^k - 1) * c`\n\n    To solve this, we expand until we reach the base case `T(1)`. Let `k = n - 1`, so `n - k = 1`.\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-1) - 1) * c`\n\n    Since `T(1)` is a constant, let's call it `c'`.\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c' + 2^(n-1) * c - c`\n    `T(n) = (c' + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`. In Big-O notation, we ignore constants, so the time complexity is `O(2^n)`. This exponential growth is characteristic of algorithms with this recursive structure, similar to the classic Towers of Hanoi problem.\n\nThe following Python script prints out the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef explain_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the step-by-step analysis of the algorithm's time complexity.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the Algorithm's Structure\")\n    print(\"The function `sort(a, n)` is a recursive function.\")\n    print(\"The base case is `n <= 1`, where it performs a constant number of operations.\")\n    print(\"Let T(n) be the time complexity for an input of size n.
