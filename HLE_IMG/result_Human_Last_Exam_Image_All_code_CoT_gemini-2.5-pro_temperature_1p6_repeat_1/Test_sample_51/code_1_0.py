# This script prints the transcription of the Ancient Greek word from the image.
# The word is identified by analyzing the Byzantine minuscule script.
# The letters are identified as: μ (mu), α (alpha) with a circumflex accent, λ (lambda),
# a ligature for ου (ou), and ν (nu).
# When combined, they form the word μᾶλουν (mâloun), which is a Byzantine
# spelling of the classical word μᾶλλον (mâllon), meaning "more" or "rather".
