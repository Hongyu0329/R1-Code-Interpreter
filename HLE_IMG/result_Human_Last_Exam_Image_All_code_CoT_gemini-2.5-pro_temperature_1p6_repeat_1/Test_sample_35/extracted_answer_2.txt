Based on the provided diagram, the S100B protein shows a strong affinity for the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE). The arrow from S100B clearly points to it binding the extracellular V-C1-C2 domain of the RAGE receptor.

S100B could be used as a prognostic marker for neurological disorders, not just solely as an adjunct marker. Here's why:
1.  **Direct link to pathology:** The activation of the RAGE receptor by S100B initiates downstream signaling cascades that are central to the progression of neurological diseases. These pathways include the JNK/JUN pathway leading to apoptosis (neuronal cell death) and the NFκB pathway, which promotes the production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β) and directly results in neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration.
2.  **Predicting Disease Course:** A prognostic marker helps predict the likely outcome or course of a disease. Since the levels of S100B directly correlate with the severity of key pathological events (like the extent of neuronal loss and inflammation), measuring S100B levels can provide valuable information about the future progression and severity of the disorder. Therefore, it serves as a powerful indicator of prognosis.
