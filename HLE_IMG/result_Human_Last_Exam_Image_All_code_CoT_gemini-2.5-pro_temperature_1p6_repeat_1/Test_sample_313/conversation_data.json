    "My plan to solve this riddle involves two main steps based on the clues provided:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Visual Clue:** The image shows an awards ceremony. Although the date \"June 20, 2019\" points towards the NHL awards, a detailed visual analysis of the trophy and the participants reveals that the event is actually the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) awards ceremony. The person receiving the award is Nikita Gusev, and the trophy is the KHL MVP award. The name of this award is the \"Golden Stick\". This gives us \"Golden Stick\" as the first possible meaning for \"X Y\".\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the Textual Clue:** The second clue states, \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" I need to find a second meaning for \"Golden Stick\" that fits this description. I'll investigate historical processes involving mercury. This leads to **mercury-gilding** (or fire-gilding), an old and highly toxic method used to apply a thin layer of gold to metal objects. An object created by this method, such as a ceremonial or decorative stick, could literally be called a \"golden stick\". This process has been almost entirely replaced by safer methods like electroplating due to the danger of mercury poisoning.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** The two clues converge perfectly on the answer. The \"X Y\" pictured is the \"Golden Stick\" award, and \"another X Y\" is a literal golden stick created via the toxic mercury-gilding process. Therefore, the answer is \"Golden Stick\". I will write a Python script to print this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle by identifying the two meanings of \"X Y\".\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Clue 1: The image shows the KHL MVP award ceremony.\n    # The name of the award is \"Golden Stick\".\n    award_name = \"Golden Stick\"\n    \n    # Clue 2: Refers to a historical process using mercury salts.\n    # This process is mercury-gilding, used to make objects golden.\n    # An object made this way could be a literal \"golden stick\".\n    # This process is no longer common due to its toxicity.\n    historical_object = \"golden stick\" # Created via mercury-gilding\n    \n    # The answer \"X Y\" refers to both the award and the historical object.\n    final_answer = award_name\n    \n    print(final_answer)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Golden Stick>>>"
