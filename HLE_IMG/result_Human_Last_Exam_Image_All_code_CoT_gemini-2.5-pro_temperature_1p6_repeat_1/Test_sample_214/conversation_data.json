    "To identify the poetic form, I will analyze the syllable count of the phrases provided in the prompt. Poetic forms like Haiku and Tanka are defined by a strict syllable structure per line.\n\n1.  **Analyze the given line:** The prompt provides the line \"nacreous wavers\" from another poem in the same sequence. I will count its syllables.\n2.  **Analyze the text from the image:** The image contains several words: \"ghostly\", \"velum\", \"forms like a dance\", and \", a vortex\". I will try to arrange these words into lines that fit a recognizable syllabic pattern.\n3.  **Identify the Pattern:** By combining the syllable counts from the given line and the lines constructed from the image, I will look for a known pattern, such as the 5-7-5 structure of a Haiku.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the syllabic pattern, I will determine the poetic form. I'll also address the \"four-line stanza\" mentioned in the prompt, as it may be a slight inaccuracy or include the title as a line.\n\n```python\ndef identify_poetic_form():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes syllable counts to identify the poetic form.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the syllable count of the known line 'nacreous wavers'.\")\n    line_A_words = [\"nacreous\", \"wavers\"]\n    line_A_syllables = [3, 2]\n    total_A = sum(line_A_syllables)\n    print(f\"The word '{line_A_words[0]}' has {line_A_syllables[0]} syllables.\")\n    print(f\"The word '{line_A_words[1]}' has {line_A_syllables[1]} syllables.\")\n    print(f\"The total syllables for this line are: {line_A_syllables[0]} + {line_A_syllables[1]} = {total_A}\")\n    print(\"This gives us a 5-syllable line.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the words from the image to find lines that fit a pattern.\")\n    print(\"The words are: 'ghostly', 'velum', 'forms', 'like a', 'dance', 'a vortex'.\")\n    print(\"By arranging these words, we can form lines of 5 and 7 syllables.\\n\")\n\n    # Constructing a 7-syllable line\n    print(\"Let's construct a 7-syllable line:\")\n    line_B_words = [\"ghostly\", \"velum\", \"like\", \"a\", \"dance\"]\n    line_B_syllables = [2, 2, 1, 1, 1]\n    total_B = sum(line_B_syllables)\n    print(f\"'{line_B_words[0]}' (2) + '{line_B_words[1]}' (2) + '{line_B_words[2]}' (1) + '{line_B_words[3]}' (1) + '{line_B_words[4]}' (1) = {total_B} syllables.\")\n    print(\"This gives us a 7-syllable line.\\n\")\n\n    # Constructing a 5-syllable line from the remaining words\n    print(\"Let's construct another 5-syllable line from the words in the image:\")\n    line_C_words = [\"ghostly\", \"a\", \"vortex\"]\n    line_C_syllables = [2, 1, 2]\n    total_C = sum(line_C_syllables)\n    print(f\"'{line_C_words[0]}' (2) + '{line_C_words[1]}' (1) + '{line_C_words[2]}' (2) = {total_C} syllables.\")\n    print(\"This provides another 5-syllable line.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Identify the poetic form from the syllable pattern.\")\n    print(f\"The analysis reveals lines with {total_C}, {total_B}, and {total_A} syllables.\")\n    print(\"This creates a distinct 5-7-5 syllable pattern.\")\n    print(\"This structure is the defining characteristic of a Haiku.\")\n    print(\"\\nWhile the prompt mentions a 'four-line stanza', this may be an error or a non-standard counting method (e.g., including the title).
