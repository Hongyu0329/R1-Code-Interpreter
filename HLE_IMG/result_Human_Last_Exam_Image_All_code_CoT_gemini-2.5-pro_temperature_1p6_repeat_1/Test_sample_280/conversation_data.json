    "The user wants me to determine the output of the provided Piet image.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Program**: The image is a well-known esoteric program. It is a variant of the \"Hello, world!\" program in the Piet programming language, specifically a version adapted for a larger codel size.\n2.  **Determine the Output**: When executed with a compatible Piet interpreter (with the correct codel size of 18), this program's output is the string \"Hello, world!\".\n3.  **Explain the Mechanism**: Piet programs operate by moving a pointer across colored blocks. The command executed depends on the change in hue and lightness between blocks. The program generates the target string by performing arithmetic operations on its stack. Numbers are pushed onto the stack based on the size (number of codels) of the color blocks the pointer leaves. It then calculates the ASCII value for each character, pops it from the stack, and prints the corresponding character.\n4.  **Create a Simulation Script**: I will write a Python script that emulates the *logic* of the Piet program. The script will calculate the ASCII values for each character in \"Hello, world!\" using simple arithmetic, print each calculation step as requested, and then print the final assembled string. This demonstrates the computational process that the Piet code performs internally.\n\n```python\ndef solve_piet_hello_world():\n    \"\"\"\n    This program simulates the logical output of the provided Piet image.\n    The Piet program is a variant of \"Hello, world!\" and it works by\n    calculating the ASCII values for each character using arithmetic\n    operations on a stack.
