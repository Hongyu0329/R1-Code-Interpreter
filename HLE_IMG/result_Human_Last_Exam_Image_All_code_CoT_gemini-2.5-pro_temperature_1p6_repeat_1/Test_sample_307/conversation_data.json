    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Objective**: The goal is to calculate the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm of the nine matrices represented visually in the provided image.\n\n2.  **Image Processing**: The core of the task is to extract numerical data from the image. The Python script will perform the following steps:\n    *   **Load Image**: It will first download the image from the given URL using the `requests` library and load it using `Pillow` (PIL).\n    *   **Grid Extraction**: The image is a 3x3 grid. The script will iterate through this grid, cropping each of the nine panels. The precise coordinates for cropping are determined by analyzing the image layout (panel size, gaps between panels).\n    *   **Matrix Conversion**: Each panel visualizes a matrix. By observing the image, each matrix appears to be an 11x11 grid of colored blocks. The script will iterate through each block in a panel, sample the color at its center, and convert that color into a number.\n\n3.  **Color-to-Value Mapping**: A diverging colormap (red-white-green) is standard for this type of visualization.\n    *   Green typically represents positive values.\n    *   Red typically represents negative values.\n    *   White represents values close to zero.\n    *   The script will use the formula `value = (G - R) / 255.0` to map an `(R, G, B)` color to a numerical value. This maps colors to a range of [-1, 1]. This relative scaling is sufficient because we are calculating a ratio, where any constant scaling factor would cancel out.\n\n4.  **Infinity-Norm Calculation**:\n    *   For each of the nine extracted matrices, the script will compute the infinity-norm. For a matrix *A*, this norm is defined as the maximum absolute row sum: `||A||∞ = max_i Σ_j |A_ij|`.\n    *   The `numpy` library will be used for efficient matrix operations.\n\n5.  **Final Ratio**:\n    *   After calculating the nine infinity-norms, the script will identify the maximum and minimum values among them.\n    *   The final ratio is then calculated as `max_norm / min_norm`.\n    *   The script will print the entire final equation, showing the values used in the calculation, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the analysis:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport requests\nimport io\n\ndef solve_wigner_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function performs the entire task:\n    1. Downloads the image of Wigner 3-j symbols.\n    2. Extracts the 9 matrices from the image.\n    3. Calculates the infinity-norm for each matrix.\n    4.
