# The solution involves a sequence of 'macro' moves, where each move relocates a piece.
# The problem asks for the minimum number of such moves.

# 1. Moves to clear the path for the red piece to move left.
# The bottom-left quadrant is blocked by two pieces: a 2x1 grey piece and a 2x1 beige piece.
# Each must be moved out of the way.
moves_clear_path_left = 2

# 2. Move the red piece into the now-empty bottom-left quadrant.
move_red_piece_left = 1

# 3. Moves to clear the path for the red piece to move up.
# The top-left quadrant is blocked by two pieces: a 1x2 grey piece and a 1x1 grey piece.
# Each must be moved out of the way.
moves_clear_path_up = 2

# 4. Move the red piece into the now-empty top-left quadrant (the final destination).
move_red_piece_up = 1

# Calculate the total minimum number of moves.
total_moves = moves_clear_path_left + move_red_piece_left + moves_clear_path_up + move_red_piece_up

# Print the breakdown of the calculation.
