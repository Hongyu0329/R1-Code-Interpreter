    # Based on the analysis, the groupings are as follows:
    # Rule 1 (t=2,3,4,5): Starts with the simple 5x5 border (H), evolves into a cross-in-a-box (L),
    # then breaks into four clusters (F), which then morph into rotated L-shapes (E).
    r1_labels = "HLFE"
    
    # Rule 2 (t=3,4,5,6): Starts with a square with a cross-shaped hole (O), evolves into a
    # checkerboard ring (M), which then breaks into four large L-shapes (A), and finally
    # evolves into a complex fractal-like pattern (B).
    r2_labels = "OMAB"

    # Rule 3 (t=4,5,6,7): This sequence has a consistent "pointy star" visual theme. It starts with
    # four T-shapes (D), which become more fragmented (I), then larger and more detailed (N),
    # and culminates in the large, ornate circular pattern (P).
    r3_labels = "DINP"

    # Rule 4 (t=5,6,7,8): This is the "shrinking" or "decaying" rule, where the patterns are small
    # for their time step. It starts with four corner blocks (K), fills in the center (C),
    # loses the center (J), and finally decays into a tiny central cross (G).
