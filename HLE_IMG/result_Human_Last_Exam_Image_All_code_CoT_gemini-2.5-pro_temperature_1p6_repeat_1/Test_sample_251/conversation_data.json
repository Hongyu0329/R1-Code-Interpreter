    "My plan is to analyze the provided ECG rhythm strip to find the longest R-R interval.\n\n1.  **Understand ECG Parameters:** The ECG is recorded at a standard paper speed of 25 mm/sec. The grid consists of small 1 mm squares and large 5 mm squares.\n    *   Time for one small square = 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n    *   Time for one large square = 5 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.2 seconds.\n\n2.  **Locate the Longest R-R Interval:** By visually inspecting the entire rhythm strip, I will find the greatest distance between two consecutive R-waves (the highest peaks of the QRS complex). The most significant pause is clearly visible on the fourth line of the tracing.\n\n3.  **Measure the Interval:** I will count the number of large squares between the peaks of the two R-waves that form this longest interval. On the fourth strip, starting from the second R-wave, the pause to the next R-wave covers exactly 8 large squares.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Time in Seconds:** I will multiply the number of large squares by the time duration of one large square to get the total interval in seconds.\n    *   Calculation: 8 large squares * 0.2 seconds/large square.\n\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the result along with the values used in the calculation.\n\n```python\n# The standard speed for an ECG rhythm strip is 25 mm/sec.\n# The grid is made of 1mm small squares and 5mm large squares.\n# Time per small square = 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n# Time per large square = 5 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.2 seconds.\n\n# By observing the ECG strip, the longest interval between two R-waves (R-R interval)\n# is found on the fourth line of the trace.\n# We can measure this interval by counting the number of large squares between the two R-wave peaks.\nnum_large_squares = 8\n\n# The time for one large square is 0.2 seconds.\ntime_per_large_square_sec = 0.2\n\n# Calculate the longest R-R interval in seconds.\nlongest_rr_interval_sec = num_large_squares * time_per_large_square_sec\n\nprint(f\"To find the longest R-R interval, we measure the distance in large squares and multiply by the time per large square.\")\nprint(f\"Longest interval in large squares: {num_large_squares}\")\nprint(f\"Time per large square (sec): {time_per_large_square_sec}\")\nprint(f\"Calculation: {num_large_squares} * {time_per_large_square_sec} = {longest_rr_interval_sec}\")\nprint(f\"The longest R-R interval is {longest_rr_interval_sec} seconds.\")\n\n```\n<<<1.6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the longest R-R interval in seconds on this rhythm strip ECG?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
