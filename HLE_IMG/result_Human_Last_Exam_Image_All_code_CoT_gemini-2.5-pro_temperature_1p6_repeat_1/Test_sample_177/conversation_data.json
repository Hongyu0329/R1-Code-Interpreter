    "To determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Data:** Extract all the necessary percentages and distances for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios from the provided tables. This includes the share of total trips for each distance category, the average trip distance for each category, and the mode shares for both \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n2.  **Calculate Baseline Car VMT:** For each distance category, I'll calculate the VMT by multiplying the share of total trips, the total car mode share (1 occupant + multi-occupant), and the average trip distance. Summing these values across all distance categories will give the total relative VMT for the baseline scenario.\n3.  **Calculate Proposed Car VMT:** I will repeat the same calculation using the mode share data from the Proposed scenario (Table 2).\n4.  **Calculate Percentage Reduction:** Finally, I'll use the calculated VMTs for the baseline and proposed scenarios to find the percentage reduction using the formula:\n    `Percentage Reduction = ((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100`\n\nThe 'Average Carpool Occupancy' is not used because the calculation is for *Vehicle* Miles Traveled, where each car trip (including carpools) counts as one vehicle.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and print the results.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n# Redirect stdout to a file to suppress the intermediate output and only show the final answer\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = open('output.txt', 'w')\n# Step 1: Define the data from the tables.\n# Common data for both scenarios\nshare_of_total_trips = [0.48, 0.22, 0.14, 0.16]  # For distance ranges: 0-3, 3-5, 5-10, 10+ miles\navg_trip_distance = [1, 4, 7.5, 20]               # Average miles for each distance range\n\n# Baseline car mode shares (as decimals)\nbaseline_car_1_occ = [0.25, 0.38, 0.40, 0.42]\nbaseline_car_multi_occ = [0.28, 0.43, 0.45, 0.47]\n\n# Proposed car mode shares (as decimals)\nproposed_car_1_occ = [0.01, 0.08, 0.14, 0.16]\nproposed_car_multi_occ = [0.02, 0.19, 0.27, 0.33]\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total relative VMT for the Baseline scenario.\n# VMT for each category = (share of total trips) * (total car mode share) * (avg trip distance)\nbaseline_total_car_share = [(b1 + b2) for b1, b2 in zip(baseline_car_1_occ, baseline_car_multi_occ)]\nbaseline_vmt = 0\nfor i in range(len(share_of_total_trips)):\n    baseline_vmt += share_of_total_trips[i] * baseline_total_car_share[i] * avg_trip_distance[i]\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the total relative VMT for the Proposed scenario.\nproposed_total_car_share = [(p1 + p2) for p1, p2 in zip(proposed_car_1_occ, proposed_car_multi_occ)]\nproposed_vmt = 0\nfor i in range(len(share_of_total_trips)):\n    proposed_vmt += share_of_total_trips[i] * proposed_total_car_share[i] * avg_trip_distance[i]\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the percentage reduction.\npercentage_reduction = ((baseline_vmt - proposed_vmt) / baseline_vmt) * 100\n\n# Step 5: Print the detailed calculation and the final answer.\nprint(\"Calculation of Car VMT Reduction\")\nprint(\"---------------------------------\")\nprint(f\"1.
