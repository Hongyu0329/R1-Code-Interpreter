    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find a point on the tiling around which we can rotate the entire pattern so that it looks identical to the original pattern. The \"order\" of the rotational symmetry is the number of times the pattern matches itself during one full 360-degree rotation.\n\n1.  **Identify a center of rotation:** Let's focus on the center of one of the dark blue, regular hexagons in the pattern.\n2.  **Test for rotation:** If we rotate the entire tiling around this central point, we can see how many times it aligns perfectly with its original orientation.\n3.  **Count the orientations:** A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides and 6 equal angles. As we rotate the pattern around the center of a blue hexagon, the pattern will look unchanged every time one vertex of the hexagon moves to the position of the next vertex. This happens 6 times in a full 360-degree rotation.\n4.  **Calculate the angle:** The smallest angle of rotation that maps the tiling onto itself is 360 degrees divided by the order of symmetry. In this case, it's 360 / 6 = 60 degrees.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since the pattern can be rotated 6 times and appear unchanged, it has a 6-fold rotational symmetry. While there are other points with 4-fold or 2-fold symmetry, the highest order of rotational symmetry present in the tiling is 6.\n\nThe following Python code will state this conclusion and print the calculation for the angle of rotation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rotational_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the rotational symmetry of the provided tiling.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To find the rotational symmetry, we identify a point around which the tiling can be rotated and remain unchanged.\")\n    print(\"Let's choose the center of one of the dark blue hexagons as our point of rotation.\")\n    print(\"\\nIf we rotate the entire pattern around this point, it will perfectly overlap with its original position 6 times in a full 360-degree turn.\")\n    print(\"This means the tiling has 6-fold rotational symmetry.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe smallest positive angle of rotation for which the tiling looks the same is calculated by dividing 360 degrees by the order of symmetry.\")\n\n    total_degrees = 360\n    order_of_symmetry = 6\n    angle_of_rotation = total_degrees / order_of_symmetry\n\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    print(f\"{total_degrees} degrees / {order_of_symmetry} = {int(angle_of_rotation)} degrees\")\n\nsolve_rotational_symmetry()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
