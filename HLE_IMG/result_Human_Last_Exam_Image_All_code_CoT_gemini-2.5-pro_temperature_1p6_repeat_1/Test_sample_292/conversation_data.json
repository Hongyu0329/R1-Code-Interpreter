    "This image features the distinctive ceiling of the Grand Hall in the Pennsylvania Convention Center. The patterned glass with blue dots is part of an art installation called \"Fabric of the Sky\" by artist Peter Zimmerman, and the unique truss system is a recognizable feature of this building. Therefore, the picture was taken in Philadelphia.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to output this information.\n```python\ndef solve_city_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the city from the architectural features in the image.\n    The image shows the Grand Hall of the Pennsylvania Convention Center.\n    \"\"\"\n    city = \"Philadelphia\"\n    print(f\"The picture was taken in the city of: {city}\")\n\nsolve_city_puzzle()\n```\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    This picture was taken in 2024.
