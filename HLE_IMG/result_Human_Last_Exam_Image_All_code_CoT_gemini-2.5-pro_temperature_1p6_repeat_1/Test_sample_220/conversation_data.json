    "To determine which pattern corresponds to a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction, we can project the atomic positions of an FCC lattice onto a 2D plane perpendicular to this direction.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the FCC Structure**: An FCC lattice consists of atoms at the corners of a cube and at the center of each face. We can define a basis of atoms within a single unit cell.\n2.  **Define the Projection**: Viewing along the [110] direction means we are projecting the 3D atomic coordinates onto a 2D plane. We can choose two orthogonal vectors that lie in this plane to be our new 2D axes. A convenient choice for the projection axes are the `[001]` and `[1,-1,0]` directions.\n3.  **Generate and Project Coordinates**: We will generate the 3D coordinates for a set of atoms in an FCC supercell and then calculate their corresponding 2D projected coordinates.\n4.  **Analyze the Pattern**: By examining the projected coordinates, we can determine the resulting 2D pattern. The atoms fall into two distinct layers when viewed along [110]. One layer forms a rectangular grid, and the second layer forms another identical grid that is shifted to lie exactly in the centers of the first grid's rectangles. This combined pattern is called a **centered rectangle**.\n5.  **Match with Images**: We will then compare this theoretical pattern to the given images A, B, C, and D. Image B is the only one that displays a centered rectangular pattern.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan by generating and projecting the coordinates to demonstrate the centered rectangular pattern.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef generate_fcc_projection():\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates and projects FCC atomic coordinates for a [110] view.\n\n    The function first defines the basis atoms of an FCC unit cell. It then\n    generates atoms in a 2x2x2 supercell. Finally, it projects these atoms\n    onto the plane perpendicular to the [110] direction, using the [001]\n    and [1,-1,0] directions as the projection axes.\n\n    The projected points are separated into two sets based on their depth to\n    illustrate the two interpenetrating rectangular lattices that form the\n    final \"centered rectangle\" pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Let the lattice constant a = 1 for simplicity.\n    a = 1.0\n\n    # Basis atoms in a conventional FCC unit cell (coordinates as fractions of a)\n    basis_atoms = [\n        [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],\n        [0.5, 0.5, 0.0],\n        [0.5, 0.0, 0.5],\n        [0.0, 0.5, 0.5]\n    ]\n\n    # Generate atoms in a 2x2x2 supercell to see the repeating pattern\n    atoms_3d = []\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            for k in range(2):\n                for basis_atom in basis_atoms:\n                    atoms_3d.append([\n                        i + basis_atom[0],\n                        j + basis_atom[1],\n                        k + basis_atom[2]\n                    ])\n\n    # Project atoms onto the plane perpendicular to [110]\n    # We use v1 = [1,-1,0] and v2 = [0,0,1] as the axes for the 2D plane.\n    # The depth is determined by the [110] direction.\n    # projected_x = (x - y) * a\n    # projected_y = z * a\n    # depth = (x + y) * a\n    \n    # We use a small tolerance for floating point comparisons\n    TOL = 1e-6\n    \n    layer_A_coords = set()\n    layer_B_coords = set()\n\n    for x, y, z in atoms_3d:\n        # Check the depth layer.
