    "To determine the molecular formula of the final product, we will analyze the reaction step-by-step, calculating the change in atomic composition at each stage.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Determine the formula of the starting material.** The starting material is a substituted `2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one`. We will find the formula of this core structure and then add the substituents (PMB and CF3) to get the initial molecular formula.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1 (Deprotection).** The reaction with CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) removes the PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) protecting group from the nitrogen, replacing it with a hydrogen atom. We will calculate the formula of Intermediate 1 by subtracting the atoms of the PMB group and adding one hydrogen.\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 2 (Hydrogenation).** The reaction with Pd/C and H2 is a catalytic hydrogenation, which will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond in the bicyclic system. This adds two hydrogen atoms to the molecule. We will calculate the formula of Intermediate 2.\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 3 (Hydrolysis).** The reaction with strong acid (4 N HCl) and heat hydrolyzes the lactam (cyclic amide). This process consumes one molecule of water (H2O) to open the ring, forming a carboxylic acid and an amine. We will calculate the final product's formula by adding H2O to the formula of Intermediate 2.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan and prints the formula at each step.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef get_formula_string(atoms):\n    \"\"\"Generates a molecular formula string from a dictionary of atom counts.\"\"\"\n    # Standard order: C, H, then alphabetical for the rest.\n    order = ['C', 'H'] + sorted([k for k in atoms if k not in ['C', 'H']])\n    \n    formula = \"\"\n    for elem in order:\n        count = atoms.get(elem, 0)\n        if count > 0:\n            formula += elem\n            if count > 1:\n                formula += str(count)\n    return formula\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product from the given reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base core molecule: 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one (C6H7NO)\n    core = {'C': 6, 'H': 7, 'N': 1, 'O': 1, 'F': 0}\n    \n    # Substituents\n    # p-Methoxybenzyl group (C8H9O) replaces one H atom.\n    pmb_group = {'C': 8, 'H': 9, 'O': 1}\n    # Trifluoromethyl group (CF3) replaces one H atom.\n    cf3_group = {'C': 1, 'F': 3}\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Starting Material ---\n    c0 = core['C'] + pmb_group['C'] + cf3_group['C']\n    h0 = core['H'] - 2 + pmb_group['H'] # -1H for PMB substitution, -1H for CF3 substitution\n    n0 = core['N']\n    o0 = core['O'] + pmb_group['O']\n    f0 = core['F'] + cf3_group['F']\n    start_formula = {'C': c0, 'H': h0, 'N': n0, 'O': o0, 'F': f0}\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of the starting material.\")\n    print(f\"The core is C6H7NO.
