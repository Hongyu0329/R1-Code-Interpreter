# The user wants me to identify the best-supported statement from a list of options
# based on a provided text and set of images about gene evolution in Drosophila.
# The core task is to analyze the evidence and logic to select the correct multiple-choice answer.
# The final output should just be the letter of the correct answer.

# Plan:
# 1. I have already analyzed the text and images in detail in my thought process.
# 2. I have evaluated all the options against the evidence.
# 3. My conclusion is that option P provides the most accurate and complete summary of the findings.
#    - It correctly identifies the duplication event leading to a paralog/ortholog pair.
#    - It correctly assigns the left element as the paralog and the right element as the ortholog.
#    - It states the correct reasoning (parsimony of CDS number, where the right element's structure is more similar to the D. melanogaster gene).
#    - It correctly states that the RNA-Seq evidence shows they are separate genes.
# 4. Therefore, the code will simply print the final identified answer.

print("Here is a breakdown of the reasoning:")
print("1. Gene Duplication: The presence of one element in D. melanogaster and two in D. willistoni points to a gene duplication event in the D. willistoni lineage. This creates an ortholog (the gene copy that retains the original function) and a paralog (the copy that is free to diverge).")
print("2. Separate Genes: The RNA-Seq data clearly shows different expression levels and tissue-specific patterns for the left and right elements. This is strong evidence that they are two separate, independently regulated genes, not isoforms of a single gene.")
print("3. Assigning Ortholog/Paralog Status: The principle of parsimony is used. Most isoforms of the original CG14879 gene in D. melanogaster have two CDSs. The 'right element' in D. willistoni appears to have a more complex, multi-exon structure (involving CDS 1a/1b) that is more structurally similar to the ancestral two-CDS gene. Therefore, it is the most likely ortholog. The 'left element' is consequently the paralog.")
print(f"4. Conclusion: Option {answer} correctly summarizes all these points: it identifies the left element as the paralog and the right as the ortholog, provides the reason (parsimony of CDS number), and notes that they are separate genes.")
