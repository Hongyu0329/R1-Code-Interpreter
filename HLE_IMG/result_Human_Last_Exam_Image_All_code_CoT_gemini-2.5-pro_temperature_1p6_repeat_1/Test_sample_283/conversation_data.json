    "Based on the analysis of the Google Trends graph, the country can be identified by the annual events that cause the recurring search interest spikes.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph Pattern:** The graph displays three distinct search trends (red, blue, and yellow) from December 2019 to mid-2023. Each trend shows sharp, regular spikes at the same time each year, indicating they are related to annual holidays, events, or traditions.\n\n2.  **Identify the Blue Line's Event:** The blue line has a very sharp, isolated spike in early November every single year. This pattern strongly correlates with Guy Fawkes Night (also known as Bonfire Night), a major cultural event celebrated almost exclusively in the United Kingdom on November 5th.\n\n3.  **Identify the Yellow Line's Event:** The yellow line shows a massive spike in late winter/early spring (February or March). This timing perfectly matches Shrove Tuesday, known colloquially in the UK as \"Pancake Day.\" It's a day when searches for pancake recipes skyrocket. While pre-Lenten traditions exist elsewhere, the term \"Pancake Day\" and the associated search frenzy are particularly characteristic of the UK.\n\n4.  **Identify the Red Line's Events:** The red line shows multiple spikes throughout the year. The most prominent ones occur around late December/early January and again in late spring (around May). These correspond directly to the major UK \"Bank Holidays,\" specifically the Christmas/Boxing Day/New Year period and the Spring Bank Holidays in May. The term \"Bank Holiday\" is the common phrasing used in the UK for public holidays, and people frequently search for their dates.\n\n**Conclusion:** The combination of these three search trends—Bonfire Night (November), Pancake Day (February/March), and Bank Holidays (especially Christmas and Spring)—points unequivocally to one country where all three are significant annual events.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the patterns in the Google Trends graph to identify the country.\n\n    - The blue line shows an annual spike in early November, which corresponds to Guy Fawkes Night (Bonfire Night).\n    - The yellow line shows an annual spike in late winter/early spring, corresponding to Pancake Day (Shrove Tuesday).\n    - The red line shows spikes corresponding to major UK Bank Holidays, such as Christmas/Boxing Day and the Spring Bank Holiday.\n\n    These three events are uniquely and collectively characteristic of one country.\n    \"\"\"\n    country = \"United Kingdom\"\n    print(f\"The country is the {country}.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<United Kingdom>>>"
