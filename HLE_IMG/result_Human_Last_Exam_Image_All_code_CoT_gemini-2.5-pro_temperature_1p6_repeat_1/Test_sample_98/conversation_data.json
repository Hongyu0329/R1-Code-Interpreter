    "This medallion is a famous artifact from the Tillya Tepe hoard, also known as the Bactrian Gold, discovered in Afghanistan. To determine its age, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Artifact's Origin:** I'll first confirm the specific find context of this medallion, which is the Tillya Tepe archaeological site.\n2.  **Find the Established Date:** I'll look up the established archaeological dating for the Tillya Tepe graves. This hoard is well-studied, and its date is generally agreed upon.\n3.  **Determine the Century:** Based on the date range provided by archaeologists (typically around the early 1st century AD), I will pinpoint the specific century.\n4.  **Format the Answer:** I will write a simple Python script to output the century number and format it as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_century():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the century of the Tillya Tepe medallion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Tillya Tepe graves, where the medallion was found, are generally dated\n    # by archaeologists to the period between 25 B.C. and 50 A.D.\n    # The art style and coins found in the graves confirm this dating.\n    # The core period of this range falls within the 1st century A.D.\n    start_year_ad = 1\n    end_year_ad = 100\n\n    # The 1st century A.D. corresponds to the years 1 through 100.\n    century = math.ceil(start_year_ad / 100)\n    era = \"A.D.\"\n\n    print(f\"The medallion is from the Tillya Tepe treasure, dated to the early part of the {century}st century {era}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the century number is: {century}\")\n    print(f\"The era is: {era}\")\n\nsolve_century()\n```\n<<<1 A.D.>>>"
