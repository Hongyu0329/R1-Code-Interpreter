    "My plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  I will carefully examine the architecture of the skyscrapers in the provided panoramic image and the cropped hints.\n2.  I will look for unique buildings or a distinctive skyline arrangement that can act as a fingerprint for a specific city. The buildings feature modern glass facades, with one having a notable grid-like structure and another a curved design. The building on the far left has a unique style as well.\n3.  By cross-referencing these architectural details with images of major world cities, I can identify the location. Specifically, the building on the left strongly resembles the Seoul City Hall (New Wing), and the cluster of buildings is characteristic of Seoul's main business district.\n4.  Once the city is identified, I will generate a Python script to print out the name of the city as the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_city_from_image():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the visual information from the provided image to identify the city.\n    \n    The image showcases several modern skyscrapers. Key identifiable landmarks include:\n    1. The building on the left, which is the distinctive Seoul City Hall (New Wing).\n    2. The cluster of buildings in the center is recognizable as part of Seoul's main business and financial district.\n    \n    Based on these architectural landmarks, the city is identified.\n    \"\"\"\n    city_name = \"Seoul\"\n    year = 2024\n    \n    print(f\"The image taken in {year} was most likely taken in the city of {city_name}.\")\n\nfind_city_from_image()\n```\n<<<Seoul>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    This image was taken in 2024.
