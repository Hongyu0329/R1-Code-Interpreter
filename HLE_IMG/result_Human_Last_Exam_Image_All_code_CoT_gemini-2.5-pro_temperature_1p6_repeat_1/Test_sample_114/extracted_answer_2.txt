The regioselectivity in Reaction 3 arises from a rigid, bicyclic munchone intermediate that prevents the substituent-scrambling rearrangement that is observed in the flexible, acyclic intermediate of Reactions 1 and 2. The results from Reactions 1 and 2 are crucial because they demonstrate this scrambling occurs in the acyclic system, providing the necessary contrast to explain the selectivity in the rigid, cyclic system.
