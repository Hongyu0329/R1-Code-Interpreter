# Step 1: Identify the knot and its properties from the image.
knot_name = "7_4"

# The knot diagram in the image has 7 crossings. Upon inspection, all of these
# crossings are positive (right-handed). A knot with a diagram containing only
# positive crossings is called a "positive knot".

# Step 2: State the formula for the Rasmussen s-invariant of positive knots.
# A theorem, formerly the Milnor Conjecture, states that for a positive knot K,
# its Rasmussen invariant s(K) is twice its slice genus g4(K).
# The formula is: s(K) = 2 * g4(K)

# Step 3: Provide the known slice genus for the 7_4 knot.
# This value is obtained from standard knot theory tables.
slice_genus_7_4 = 1

# Step 4: Calculate the Rasmussen s-invariant using the formula.
rasmussen_invariant = 2 * slice_genus_7_4

# Step 5: Print the explanation and the final result.
print(f"The knot shown in the picture is a diagram of the {knot_name} knot.")
print("This specific diagram qualifies it as a 'positive knot' because all its crossings are positive.")
print("\nFor any positive knot K, the Rasmussen invariant s(K) is given by the formula:")
print("s(K) = 2 * g4(K), where g4(K) is the slice genus of the knot.")
print(f"\nThe slice genus for the {knot_name} knot is known to be {slice_genus_7_4}.")
print("\nUsing this information, we can calculate the Rasmussen invariant:")
# The final equation with each number is printed below.
print(f"s({knot_name}) = 2 * {slice_genus_7_4} = {rasmussen_invariant}")

print(f"\nTherefore, the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture is {rasmussen_invariant}.")
