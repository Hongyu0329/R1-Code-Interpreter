    "Based on the visual analysis of the provided knot diagram, here is the step-by-step plan to determine its Rasmussen invariant:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot and its Properties**: First, I will identify the knot in the image. By counting the crossings, we see it has 7 crossings. Comparing its structure to knot tables, this diagram represents the **7₄ knot**. A crucial observation of this specific diagram is that all 7 crossings are \"positive\" (or right-handed). A knot that possesses a diagram with only positive crossings is known as a **positive knot**.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Theorem**: For positive knots, there is a powerful theorem (formerly the Milnor Conjecture, proven by Kronheimer and Mrowka) that directly relates the Rasmussen s-invariant to another knot invariant called the slice genus, denoted `g₄(K)`. The formula is:\n    `s(K) = 2 * g₄(K)`\n\n3.  **Find the Slice Genus**: The slice genus `g₄(K)` is a known property for most simple knots and can be looked up in knot theory databases like the Knot Atlas or KnotInfo. For the 7₄ knot, the slice genus is 1.\n    `g₄(7₄) = 1`\n\n4.  **Calculate the Rasmussen Invariant**: With the slice genus value, I can now apply the formula from Step 2 to calculate the Rasmussen invariant for the knot depicted in the image.\n\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: Finally, I will write a Python script that implements this logic, defining the known values and performing the calculation. The script will print out the reasoning and the final equation step-by-step as requested.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Identify the knot and its properties from the image.\nknot_name = \"7_4\"\n\n# The knot diagram in the image has 7 crossings. Upon inspection, all of these\n# crossings are positive (right-handed). A knot with a diagram containing only\n# positive crossings is called a \"positive knot\".\n\n# Step 2: State the formula for the Rasmussen s-invariant of positive knots.\n# A theorem, formerly the Milnor Conjecture, states that for a positive knot K,\n# its Rasmussen invariant s(K) is twice its slice genus g4(K).\n# The formula is: s(K) = 2 * g4(K)\n\n# Step 3: Provide the known slice genus for the 7_4 knot.\n# This value is obtained from standard knot theory tables.\nslice_genus_7_4 = 1\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the Rasmussen s-invariant using the formula.\nrasmussen_invariant = 2 * slice_genus_7_4\n\n# Step 5: Print the explanation and the final result.\nprint(f\"The knot shown in the picture is a diagram of the {knot_name} knot.\")\nprint(\"This specific diagram qualifies it as a 'positive knot' because all its crossings are positive.\")\nprint(\"\\nFor any positive knot K, the Rasmussen invariant s(K) is given by the formula:\")\nprint(\"s(K) = 2 * g4(K), where g4(K) is the slice genus of the knot.\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe slice genus for the {knot_name} knot is known to be {slice_genus_7_4}.\")\nprint(\"\\nUsing this information, we can calculate the Rasmussen invariant:\")\n# The final equation with each number is printed below.\nprint(f\"s({knot_name}) = 2 * {slice_genus_7_4} = {rasmussen_invariant}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nTherefore, the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture is {rasmussen_invariant}.\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"
