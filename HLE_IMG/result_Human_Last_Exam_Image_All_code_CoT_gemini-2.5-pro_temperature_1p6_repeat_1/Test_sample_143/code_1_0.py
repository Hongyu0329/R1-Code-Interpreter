# The analysis for each image pair leads to the following conclusions:
# A: The right image shows a clear invasion (dense monoculture) of Garlic Mustard, while the left shows it in a mixed, native setting. This is option 3.
# B: Both images show Large-leaved Lupine thriving in disturbed environments, characteristic of its invasive nature. This is option 2.
# C: The left image shows a Papaya tree in an unsuitable, non-native habitat (gravelly floodplain), while the right shows it in a more suitable, native-like habitat. This is option 4.

# Assign the identified indices to variables.
index_A = 3
index_B = 2
index_C = 4

# Print the final answer as a comma-separated string of indices.
print(f"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}")
