    "Here is my plan to solve this musical analysis problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Signature:** I will first examine the key signature of the piece. The piece is in C minor, which has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭).\n\n2.  **Locate Measure 30:** I will find measure 30 on the provided score. It is the third measure on the second system, highlighted by a circle.\n\n3.  **Identify the Notes:** I will identify all the notes being played in both the right and left hands within measure 30.\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The notes are F♯ and A, played as an octave.\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The notes are F♯, A, C, and E♭.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Harmony:** I will combine all the unique notes to determine the chord. The notes are F♯, A, C, and E♭. This combination forms an F♯ fully diminished seventh chord (F♯°7).\n\n5.  **Determine the Roman Numeral:** I will analyze the function of this F♯°7 chord within the key of C minor.\n    *   The dominant (V) chord in C minor is G major.\n    *   The F♯°7 chord serves as the leading-tone seventh chord to the dominant (G). The root of the chord, F♯, is the leading tone of G.\n    *   Therefore, the correct Roman numeral is \"vii°7/V\", which means \"the leading-tone seventh chord of the dominant\".\n\n6.  **Generate the Code:** I will write a Python script that states these facts and prints the final Roman numeral.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_measure_30():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes measure 30 of Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata, 1st Movement,\n    and provides the correct Roman numeral analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n    key = \"C minor\"\n    measure = 30\n    \n    # Notes found in measure 30\n    notes_in_chord = [\"F#\", \"A\", \"C\", \"Eb\"]\n    \n    # Analysis of the chord\n    chord_name = \"F-sharp diminished seventh (F#°7)\"\n    dominant_of_key = \"G major (V)\"\n    function_of_chord = f\"Leading-tone seventh chord to the dominant ({dominant_of_key})\"\n    roman_numeral = \"vii°7/V\"\n    \n    # Print the step-by-step analysis\n    print(f\"Analysis of Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata, 1st Mvt., Measure {measure}:\")\n    print(f\"1. The key is {key}.\")\n    print(f\"2. The notes in measure {measure} are: {', '.join(notes_in_chord)}.\")\n    print(f\"3. These notes form an {chord_name}.\")\n    print(f\"4. This chord functions as the {function_of_chord}.\")\n    print(f\"5. Therefore, the correct Roman numeral is: {roman_numeral}\")\n\nanalyze_measure_30()\n```\n<<<vii°7/V>>>"
