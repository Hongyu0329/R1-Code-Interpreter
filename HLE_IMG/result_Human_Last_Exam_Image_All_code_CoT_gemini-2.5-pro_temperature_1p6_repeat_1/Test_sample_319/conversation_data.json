    "The image displays a spectrogram and waveform that illustrate a famous auditory illusion.\n\n**Analysis of the stimulus:**\n1.  **Initial phase:** The top panel (spectrogram) shows a single horizontal line, and the bottom panel (waveform) shows a clean sine wave. This represents a continuous pure tone at a constant frequency.\n2.  **Interruption phase:** A vertical, wideband feature appears in the spectrogram, corresponding to a noisy, complex section in the waveform. This is a burst of noise that replaces the pure tone for a short duration.\n3.  **Post-interruption phase:** After the noise burst, the tone-like sound returns.\n\n**The Illusion:**\nWhen a person listens to this sound, the brain doesn't perceive the tone as stopping and then starting again. Instead, it perceives the tone as continuing *through* the noise burst. The brain perceptually \"fills in\" the missing part of the tone, assuming that the tone is simply being masked by the louder noise. This creates a seamless auditory experience.\n\nThis phenomenon is a classic example of **auditory scene analysis**, where the brain organizes complex sounds into meaningful streams or objects. It is analogous to visual illusions like the Necker Cube because the brain chooses one plausible interpretation (the tone continues) over another (the tone stops and a new sound begins).\n\nThe name for this specific auditory illusion is the **Auditory continuity illusion**.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_illusion():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the name of the perceptual phenomenon\n  illustrated by the provided image.\n\n  The image shows a pure tone being interrupted by a burst of noise.\n  The auditory system tends to perceive the tone as continuing uninterrupted\n  through the noise. This is a classic auditory illusion.\n  \"\"\"\n  phenomenon_name = \"Auditory continuity illusion\"\n  print(phenomenon_name)\n\nsolve_illusion()\n```\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion>>>"
