# The side length of the red regular hexagon.
s = 3

# The formula for the area of a regular hexagon is (3 * sqrt(3) / 2) * s^2.
# This is equivalent to 6 times the area of an equilateral triangle with side s, which is 6 * (s^2 * sqrt(3) / 4).
area = (3 * math.sqrt(3) / 2) * (s**2)

# We print the equation with the values substituted to show the calculation.
# The result is rounded to two decimal places as in the answer choices.
