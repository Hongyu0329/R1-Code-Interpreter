    This function identifies the correct statements based on the analysis of the plots.
    
    Step 1: The plots are paired based on their axis ranges: {1,4}, {2,6}, {3,5}.
    Step 2: We test the consistency of the given answer choices.
    Step 3: Option J suggests that statements 3, 5, and 10 are correct.
      - Statement 3 assigns pair {1,4} to system C.
      - Statement 5 assigns pair {3,5} to system B.
      - This implies pair {2,6} corresponds to system A.
      - Statement 10 identifies the high Lewis number plots as {3,4,6}.
    Step 4: We check this for internal consistency.
      - Pair C={1,4}: Plot 1 is Low-Le, Plot 4 is High-Le. (Consistent)
      - Pair B={3,5}: Plot 3 is High-Le, Plot 5 is Low-Le. (Consistent)
      - Pair A={2,6}: Plot 2 is Low-Le, Plot 6 is High-Le. (Consistent)
    Step 5: The set of statements {3, 5, 10} is fully consistent.
