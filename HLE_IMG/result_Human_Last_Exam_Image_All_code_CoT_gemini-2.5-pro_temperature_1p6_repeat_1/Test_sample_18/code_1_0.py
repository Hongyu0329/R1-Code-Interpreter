    Solves the complex retrograde analysis chess problem.
    The position presented contains several illegalities under standard chess rules:
    1. White has 8 pawns on the board, which is impossible.
    2. The Black King at c6 and Black Pawn at c7 cannot legally occupy those squares simultaneously.
    
    The resolution to these paradoxes implies a unique game history where the piece on d6 is actually a Black Pawn that has just moved from d7.
    Therefore, Black's move is to advance this pawn. This starts a forced mate.
