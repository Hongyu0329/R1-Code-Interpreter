The image depicts the process of hyphal lysis (cell bursting) in a filamentous organism. Panel L shows an intact hypha. Panel M shows the initiation of lysis with a bulge forming at a septum (the connection between cells), as indicated by the arrowhead. Panel N shows the advanced stage of lysis, where the cell has collapsed and buckled at the weakened septum due to internal pressure.
