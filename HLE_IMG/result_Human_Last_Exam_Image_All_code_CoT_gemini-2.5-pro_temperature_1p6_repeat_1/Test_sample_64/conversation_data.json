    "This image depicts a biological process occurring in a filamentous organism, likely a fungal hypha, over time (panels L, M, and N).\n\n*   **Panel L:** Shows a healthy, turgid hyphal filament with distinct segments separated by cross-walls called septa. The arrowhead points to one such septum.\n*   **Panel M:** A bulge begins to form at the septum indicated by the arrowhead. This suggests a weakening of the cell wall at this specific point.\n*   **Panel N:** The hypha has visibly bent and collapsed at the weakened septum. The bulge is more pronounced, indicating that the cell has burst or lysed due to internal turgor pressure exceeding the structural integrity of the cell wall at that location.\n\nTherefore, the process shown is **hyphal lysis** or **bursting at the septum**. I will provide a Python script to print this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef describe_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  Describes the biological process shown in the image series.\n  \"\"\"\n  process_description = (\n      \"The image depicts the process of hyphal lysis (cell bursting) in a filamentous organism. \"\n      \"Panel L shows an intact hypha. Panel M shows the initiation of lysis with a bulge forming at a septum (the connection between cells), as indicated by the arrowhead. \"\n      \"Panel N shows the advanced stage of lysis, where the cell has collapsed and buckled at the weakened septum due to internal pressure.\"\n  )\n  print(process_description)\n\ndescribe_process()\n```\n<<<The image depicts the process of hyphal lysis (cell bursting) in a filamentous organism.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
