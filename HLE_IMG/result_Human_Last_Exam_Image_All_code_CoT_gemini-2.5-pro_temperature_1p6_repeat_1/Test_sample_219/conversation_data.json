    "My plan is to first visually identify the time points corresponding to the center of each synchronized burst of neuronal activity. These bursts are visible as dense vertical columns in the graph, indicating that many electrodes are firing at the same time. After listing these timestamps, I will calculate the time intervals between each consecutive burst. Finally, I will compute the average of these inter-burst intervals and round the result to two significant figures as requested.\n\n1.  **Identify Burst Timestamps:** I will examine the x-axis (Time (s)) and locate the four most prominent synchronized bursts.\n    *   The first burst is centered at approximately 5 seconds.\n    *   The second burst is centered at approximately 17 seconds.\n    *   The third burst is centered at approximately 36 seconds.\n    *   The fourth burst is centered at approximately 49 seconds.\n\n2.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** I will find the difference in time between consecutive bursts.\n    *   IBI 1 = 17 s - 5 s = 12 s\n    *   IBI 2 = 36 s - 17 s = 19 s\n    *   IBI 3 = 49 s - 36 s = 13 s\n\n3.  **Calculate Average IBI:** I will sum the intervals and divide by the number of intervals.\n    *   Average IBI = (12 + 19 + 13) / 3 = 44 / 3 â‰ˆ 14.67 s\n\n4.  **Round to Significant Figures:** The result (14.67) will be rounded to two significant figures, which is 15.\n\nI will now write a Python code to formalize and display these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_average_ibi():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies timestamps of synchronized bursts from a graph,\n    calculates the inter-burst intervals (IBIs), and computes the average IBI.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the timestamps of the synchronized bursts from the graph.\n    # These are visually estimated from the densest vertical bands of activity.\n    burst_timestamps = [5, 17, 36, 49]\n    print(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the intervals between consecutive bursts.\n    inter_burst_intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\n    print(f\"Calculated inter-burst intervals (s): {list(inter_burst_intervals)}\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the average of the inter-burst intervals.\n    average_ibi = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\n    \n    # Print the calculation steps for the average\n    intervals_str = ' + '.join(map(str, inter_burst_intervals))\n    print(f\"Calculation for average IBI: ({intervals_str}) / {len(inter_burst_intervals)}\")\n    print(f\"Unrounded average IBI: {average_ibi:.4f} s\")\n\n    # Step 4: Round the average to two significant figures.\n    # The format specifier 'g' is used for general format, which works well for significant figures.\n    rounded_average_ibi = float(f\"{average_ibi:.2g}\")\n    print(f\"\\nAverage inter-burst interval rounded to two significant figures: {rounded_average_ibi} s\")\n\ncalculate_average_ibi()\n```\n<<<15>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts in this graph of firing activity of a neuronal culture and calculate the average inter-burst interval to two significant figures.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
