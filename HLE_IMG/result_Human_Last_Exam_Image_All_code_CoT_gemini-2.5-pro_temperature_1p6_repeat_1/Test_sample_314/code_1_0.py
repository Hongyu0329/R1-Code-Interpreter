def solve_graphene_puzzle():
    """
    Solves the puzzle by determining which simulation plot corresponds to each condition.

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  Condition (1) minimum t: Plot 3. By elimination, and checked for consistency.
    2.  Condition (2) minimum |s|: Plot 2. It is visually the most symmetric (least asymmetric).
    3.  Condition (3) unique sign(s): Plot 4. Conduction and valence band asymmetry is inverted compared to others.
    4.  Condition (4) maximum s: Plot 1. It is visually the most asymmetric.

    The question asks for the simulation indices ordered by the condition met.
