    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to identify the compound from the given mass spectrum:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak:** I'll first look for the peak with the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), which usually corresponds to the molecular ion. The cluster of peaks at the highest m/z values is at 262, 264, and 266. This is our molecular ion cluster.\n\n2.  **Determine the Number of Halogen Atoms:** The presence of multiple peaks in the M⁺ cluster (M⁺, M⁺+2, M⁺+4) strongly suggests the presence of chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br) atoms, which have common heavy isotopes.\n    *   Chlorine has isotopes ³⁵Cl (~75.8%) and ³⁷Cl (~24.2%), in a ratio of approximately 3:1.\n    *   Bromine has isotopes ⁷⁹Br (~50.7%) and ⁸¹Br (~49.3%), in a ratio of approximately 1:1.\n    *   The observed intensities are I(262)=29.0, I(264)=12.9, and I(266)=3.22. The relative ratio is approximately 9 : 4 : 1.\n    *   The theoretical ratio for two chlorine atoms (Cl₂) is (3:1)² which gives M⁺ : M⁺+2 : M⁺+4 intensities in a ratio of 9:6:1.\n    *   Our observed ratio (9:4:1) is a reasonable match for the presence of **two chlorine atoms**, with the M⁺+2 peak being slightly less intense than theory, which can occur due to fragmentation.\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z=262 represents the molecule containing the lightest isotopes, in this case, two ³⁵Cl atoms.\n    *   The mass of the non-halogen part of the molecule is: 262 (M⁺) - 2 * 35 (mass of ³⁵Cl) = 192 u.\n    *   I need to find a combination of carbon and hydrogen atoms that adds up to 192. A very plausible combination is **C₁₅H₁₂** (15 * 12 + 12 * 1 = 180 + 12 = 192).\n    *   Therefore, the most likely molecular formula is **C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Fragmentation Pattern:**\n    *   **Base Peak (most intense peak):** The table shows the base peak is at **m/z = 225** (I=100).\n    *   **Loss of Chlorine:** There is a significant peak cluster at m/z 227 (I=66.7) and m/z 229 (I=22.2).\n        *   The intensity ratio I(227)/I(229) is 66.7/22.2 ≈ 3.0, which is the classic 3:1 signature for a fragment containing **one chlorine atom**.\n        *   This fragment corresponds to the loss of one chlorine atom from the molecular ion: [M - Cl]⁺. Let's check the mass: 262 (M⁺) - 35 (³⁵Cl) = 227. This matches perfectly.\n    *   **Formation of the Base Peak:** The base peak at m/z=225 is 2 units less than the [M-Cl]⁺ fragment at 227. This corresponds to the loss of two hydrogen atoms (H₂). The ion at m/z 225 is therefore `[M - Cl - H₂]⁺`. The fact that this is the most intense peak suggests it is a very stable, highly conjugated/aromatic ion.\n    *   **Other Fragments:** The peak at m/z=192 corresponds to the loss of both chlorine atoms [M - 2Cl]⁺, which gives the `C₁₅H₁₂` hydrocarbon part.\n\n5.  **Propose a Structure and Name:**\n    *   The molecular formula is C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂. The fragmentation suggests an aromatic structure that can form a stable cation.\n    *   A very plausible structure that fits the formula is **1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)prop-1-ene**.\n    *   Let's check this structure: It has a C=C double bond and two dichlorinated phenyl rings, which fits the formula and high degree of unsaturation. The loss of a chlorine atom, followed by rearrangement and loss of H₂, could form a highly stable, delocalized cation, explaining the base peak at m/z 225.\n    *   The systematic IUPAC name for this structure is **1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)prop-1-ene**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mass_spectrometry():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the mass spectrometry problem by calculating and explaining the key fragments.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Key masses from the spectrum table\n    mass_molecular_ion = 262  # M+ peak for the molecule with 2 * 35Cl\n    mass_base_peak = 225      # The most intense peak\n    mass_M_minus_Cl = 227     # Peak corresponding to the loss of one 35Cl\n    \n    # Atomic masses for calculation\n    mass_Cl35 = 35\n    mass_H = 1\n    mass_C = 12\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the molecular ion and determine the non-halogen mass\n    mass_of_two_Cl = 2 * mass_Cl35\n    non_halogen_mass = mass_molecular_ion - mass_of_two_Cl\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the mass of the hydrocarbon part of the molecule.\")\n    print(f\"The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z = {mass_molecular_ion}.\")\n    print(f\"This peak corresponds to the molecule with the lightest isotopes (two ³⁵Cl atoms).\")\n    print(f\"Mass of two ³⁵Cl atoms = 2 * {mass_Cl35} = {mass_of_two_Cl} u.\")\n    print(f\"Mass of the rest of the molecule = M+ - (mass of two ³⁵Cl atoms)\")\n    print(f\"                             = {mass_molecular_ion} - {mass_of_two_Cl} = {non_halogen_mass} u.\")\n    \n    # Propose the hydrocarbon formula\n    num_C = 15\n    num_H = 12\n    calculated_hydrocarbon_mass = num_C * mass_C + num_H * mass_H\n    \n    print(f\"\\nA plausible formula for a mass of {non_halogen_mass} is C{num_C}H{num_H}, as {num_C}*{mass_C} + {num_H}*{mass_H} = {calculated_hydrocarbon_mass}.\")\n    print(\"This gives a total molecular formula of C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the fragmentation pattern\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the fragmentation pattern to confirm the structure.\")\n    # Loss of one chlorine atom\n    calculated_fragment1 = mass_molecular_ion - mass_Cl35\n    print(f\"A major fragment is seen at m/z = {mass_M_minus_Cl}.
