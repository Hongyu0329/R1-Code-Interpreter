    "To identify the name of the alkaloid compound shown in the image, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure:** I will examine the provided chemical structure to identify its key features. This includes the number and type of rings, the functional groups present, and the stereochemistry.\n2.  **Identify key features:** The molecule is polycyclic, containing four fused rings. It has two nitrogen atoms, making it a diamine derivative. One of the six-membered rings contains a carbonyl group (C=O) adjacent to a nitrogen atom, which forms a lactam functional group.\n3.  **Search chemical databases:** Based on these features (tetracyclic, two nitrogens, lactam), I will search chemical databases to find a matching compound. The specific arrangement of the rings and the stereochemistry are crucial for an exact match.\n4.  **Confirm the name:** The structure matches a well-known lupin alkaloid. The specific compound with this exact tetracyclic lactam structure is named Matrine.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that stores this name in a variable and prints it as the output.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify the name of the alkaloid shown in the image.\n\n# Step 1: The image displays a complex chemical structure.\n# Step 2: Analysis of the structure reveals it is a tetracyclic (four-ring) compound\n# containing two nitrogen atoms and a lactam functional group (a cyclic amide).\n# Step 3: This specific ring system and functional group combination is characteristic of the\n# lupin alkaloid known as Matrine.\n\n# Step 4: We store the identified name in a variable and print it.\ncompound_name = \"Matrine\"\n\nprint(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n```\n<<<Matrine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
