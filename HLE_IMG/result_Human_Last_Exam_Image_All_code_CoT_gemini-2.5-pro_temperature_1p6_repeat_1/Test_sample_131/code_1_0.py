# The task is to identify the name of the alkaloid shown in the image.

# Step 1: The image displays a complex chemical structure.
# Step 2: Analysis of the structure reveals it is a tetracyclic (four-ring) compound
# containing two nitrogen atoms and a lactam functional group (a cyclic amide).
# Step 3: This specific ring system and functional group combination is characteristic of the
# lupin alkaloid known as Matrine.

# Step 4: We store the identified name in a variable and print it.
compound_name = "Matrine"

print(f"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}")
