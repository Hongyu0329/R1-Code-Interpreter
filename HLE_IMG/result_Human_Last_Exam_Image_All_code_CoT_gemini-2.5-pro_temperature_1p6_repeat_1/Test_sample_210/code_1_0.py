    This function analyzes the features of the target nyala and compares them
    to the options provided to find the matching individual.

    The key features for comparison are:
    1. Horn shape: The target has lyre-shaped horns with a specific outward curve on the left horn's tip.
    2. Stripe pattern: A unique arrangement of vertical white stripes on the flank.
    3. Spot pattern: A distinct cluster of white spots on the lower flank.

    - Option A is a younger male with smaller horns.
    - Option B is a plausible match, but some details are less clear.
    - Option C has poor image quality and the horns look different.
    - Option D is an excellent match. The horn shape, stripe pattern, and facial spots align perfectly with the target.
    - Option E has a white band on its leg, which the target lacks.
    - Option F is partially obscured.

    Based on the highly consistent and clearly visible features, Image D shows the same nyala as the target.
