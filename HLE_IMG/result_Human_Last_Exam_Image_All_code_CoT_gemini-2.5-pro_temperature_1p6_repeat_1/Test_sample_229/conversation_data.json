    "This is a knowledge-based task. My plan is to first identify the song from the provided sheet music by analyzing its melody and chord progression. Then, I will research the song's composer to determine its country of origin and musical style. Finally, I will write a Python script to present these findings.\n\n1.  **Melody and Chord Analysis**: The melody and the chord changes (e.g., C, E7, F, G7) are characteristic of a well-known jazz standard. The opening melodic phrase is particularly distinctive.\n2.  **Song Identification**: Based on the musical elements, the song is \"Bluesette\".\n3.  **Research**: \"Bluesette\" was composed by Jean \"Toots\" Thielemans.\n4.  **Style and Origin**: Toots Thielemans was a Belgian musician. The piece is a quintessential jazz standard. Although originally composed as a jazz waltz (in 3/4 time), the provided sheet music is in 4/4 time, which is a common swing or bebop arrangement.\n5.  **Code Generation**: I will now create a Python script to output this information.\n\n```python\ndef get_song_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the information about the provided sheet music.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Bluesette\"\n    musical_style = \"Jazz\"\n    country_of_origin = \"Belgium\"\n\n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Musical Style: {musical_style}\")\n    print(f\"Country of Origin: {country_of_origin}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_song_info()\n```\n<<<Title: Bluesette, Musical Style: Jazz, Country of Origin: Belgium>>>"
