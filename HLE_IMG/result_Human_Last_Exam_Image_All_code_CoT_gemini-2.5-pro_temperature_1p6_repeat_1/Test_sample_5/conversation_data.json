    "Based on the musical characteristics of the score, I can identify the piece for you.\n\nHere's my analysis:\n1.  **Style:** The piece exhibits features typical of the late Romantic era. It has a wide dynamic range (from *p* to *f*), dense chordal textures, virtuosic arpeggiated figures, and rich, chromatic harmony. This style is highly characteristic of the Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff.\n2.  **Structure and Motifs:** The excerpt begins with a relatively calm melodic section (*Poco meno mosso*) before moving into more agitated and chord-heavy passages. This contrast between lyrical sections and dramatic, powerful ones is a hallmark of the composer.\n3.  **Identification:** This sheet music is from the middle section (*Agitato*) of Sergei Rachmaninoff's famous **Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op. 3, No. 2**. While the prelude's home key is C-sharp minor, this middle section modulates frequently, and some editions write it with a neutral key signature (as seen here) to simplify reading the numerous accidentals.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the music piece.\n\n```python\ndef guess_the_music():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the name of the musical piece from the sheet music.\n  \"\"\"\n  composer = \"Sergei Rachmaninoff\"\n  piece_title = \"Prelude in C-sharp minor\"\n  opus_number = \"Op. 3, No. 2\"\n  \n  full_title = f\"{composer} - {piece_title}, {opus_number}\"\n  \n  print(\"The music is:\")\n  print(full_title)\n  print(\"\\nThe provided image shows the middle section (starting at 'Poco meno mosso').\")\n\nguess_the_music()\n```\n<<<Sergei Rachmaninoff - Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op. 3, No. 2>>>"
