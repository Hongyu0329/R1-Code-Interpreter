    print("Step-by-step analysis of the themes:")
    print("1. Analysis of the Image:")
    print("   - The image depicts a ghostly figure described as a 'lost small deity of the past'.")
    print("   - This explicitly introduces the theme of 'the fading of religious beliefs'.")
    print("   - The aged, faded aesthetic of the image itself suggests themes of decay, loss, and the passage of time.")
    print("\n2. Analysis of the Poem:")
    print("   - The line 'Velvet fades' points to the impermanence of material objects and beauty.")
    print("   - The metaphor 'like a photochromic lens' illustrates change and transience.")
    print("   - Both lines together powerfully evoke 'the transient, passing nature of existence'.")
    print("\n3. Synthesis and Conclusion:")
    print("   - The combination of the 'lost deity' and the 'fading' metaphors points to two key themes.")
    print("   - Theme 1: The fading of religious beliefs (from the 'lost deity').")
    print("   - Theme 2: The transient, passing nature of existence (from the poem and the overall aesthetic).")
    print("\n4. Evaluating the Answer Choices:")
    print("   - Option B: 'The transient, passing nature of existence and the fading of religious beliefs' aligns perfectly with this analysis.")
    print("   - Other options are either too narrow (e.g., focusing only on death or memory loss) or less central (e.g., technology).")
    print("\nFinal Answer Selection:")
    print("The most fitting answer is B.")
