    "To identify the molecule in the image, I will first break it down into its constituent chemical building blocks. By analyzing the ball-and-stick model, I can identify the different types of structural units, such as phenylene rings, ethynylene linkers, and ethenylene linkers.\n\nNext, I will carefully count the number of each of these units in the entire cyclic structure.\n\nThen, using these counts, I will write a Python script to calculate the total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the molecule, thereby determining its molecular formula. This script will explicitly show the calculation steps.\n\nFinally, based on the determined molecular formula and a search of the chemical literature for this specific structure, I will provide the common name assigned to this molecule.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Backup stdout\nstdout_backup = sys.stdout\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer\nsys.stdout = io.StringIO()\n\n# --- Start of the user-facing script ---\n\n# The molecule is a large macrocycle composed of three types of building blocks:\n# 1. Phenylene (-C6H4-): A benzene ring with two connection points.\n# 2. Ethynylene (-C≡C-): A carbon-carbon triple bond.\n# 3.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name the molecule.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
