def find_endemic_island():
    """
    This function solves the riddle about the plant's endemic island.

    The key steps in the reasoning are:
    1. The question asks where the plant 'was' endemic, implying it's either extinct or its range changed.
    2. The most famous case of a plant that was endemic to a single island and is now extinct is the Saint Helena Olive (Nesiota elliptica).
    3. Descriptions of this plant's leaves (elliptical, with pale, prominent veins) are a general match for the image.
    4. The unique phrasing of the question points directly to this specific case.
    5. Therefore, the island is Saint Helena.
