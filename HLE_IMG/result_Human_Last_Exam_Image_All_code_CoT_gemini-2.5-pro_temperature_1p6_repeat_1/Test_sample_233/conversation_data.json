    "The image provided shows a fragment of a runestone with a very distinctive inscription style. The runes are arranged in a strict grid pattern, with horizontal and vertical lines separating them. This unique style is characteristic of the Ingvar runestone known as the Tystberga stone, located in Södermanland, Sweden.\n\nIts official catalog ID is **Sö 173**.\n\nTo confirm this, we can transliterate a portion of the runes. The top visible row of runes reads, from left to right: `...ᚦ ᚢ ᚱ ᚢ ᚦ ᛦ...` which transliterates to `...þuruþʀ...`. This is the beginning of the name `Þrúðr` (Thrudr), which appears on Side B of the Sö 173 inscription.\n\nTherefore, the ID of the runestone is Sö 173.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to construct this ID, as requested by the prompt. The script will form the number 173 from its constituent parts to satisfy the \"equation\" requirement.\n\n```python\n# The runestone ID consists of a catalog prefix and a number.\n# The catalog is Södermanlands runinskrifter, abbreviated as \"Sö\".\ncatalog_prefix = \"Sö\"\n\n# The number of the runestone is 173.\n# Let's construct this number from its digits to form an \"equation\".\nhundreds = 1\ntens = 7\nones = 3\n\n# The equation to form the number\nnumber = hundreds * 100 + tens * 10 + ones * 1\n\n# The final ID is the concatenation of the prefix and the number.\nrunestone_id = f\"{catalog_prefix} {number}\"\n\n# Print the \"equation\" as requested\nprint(f\"The ID number is derived from the following calculation:\")\nprint(f\"{hundreds} * 100 + {tens} * 10 + {ones} * 1 = {number}\")\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(f\"\\nThe ID of the Ingvar runestone is: {runestone_id}\")\n\n```\n<<<Sö 173>>>"
