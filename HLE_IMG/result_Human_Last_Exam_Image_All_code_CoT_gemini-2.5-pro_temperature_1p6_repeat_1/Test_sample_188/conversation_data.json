    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to compute the chromatic polynomial for the given graph, followed by the Python code to present the result.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph Structure:** First, I'll identify the vertices and edges from the image. The graph has 5 vertices and 7 edges. Let's denote the graph as G.\n    *   Vertices V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n    *   Edges E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}\n    This structure can be seen as two K₃ (complete graphs on 3 vertices) {2,3,4} and {3,4,5} sharing the edge (3,4), with an additional vertex 1 connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n\n2.  **Use the Deletion-Contraction Principle:** This is a powerful recursive method to compute chromatic polynomials. The formula is:\n    P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k)\n    where `P(G, k)` is the chromatic polynomial of graph G, `G - e` is the graph with edge `e` deleted, and `G / e` is the graph with edge `e` contracted. I will choose the edge e = (1, 2) as it simplifies the graph structure nicely.\n\n3.  **Compute P(G - e, k):**\n    *   Let G' = G - (1,2). In this new graph, vertex 1 is only connected to vertex 5.\n    *   The rest of the graph on vertices {2,3,4,5} consists of the two K₃ triangles {2,3,4} and {3,4,5} sharing the edge (3,4). This is a \"diamond graph\".\n    *   The chromatic polynomial of G' can be found to be: P(G', k) = k(k-1)²(k-2)²\n\n4.  **Compute P(G / e, k):**\n    *   Let G'' = G / (1,2). We merge vertices 1 and 2 into a single new vertex, let's call it `v₁₂`.\n    *   The new graph G'' has 4 vertices: {v₁₂, 3, 4, 5}.\n    *   Analyzing the new connections, we find that every vertex in G'' is connected to every other vertex. Thus, G'' is a complete graph K₄.\n    *   The chromatic polynomial of K₄ is well-known: P(K₄, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n\n5.  **Combine and Simplify:** Finally, I'll subtract the two polynomials as per the deletion-contraction formula and simplify the expression to get the final chromatic polynomial for the original graph G.\n    *   P(G, k) = [k(k-1)²(k-2)²] - [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)]\n    *   Factoring and simplifying this expression yields the final polynomial.\n\nThe following Python code presents the derived result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_chromatic_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function computes and prints the chromatic polynomial for the given graph.\n    The derivation is done using the deletion-contraction method.\n\n    1. Graph Definition (G):\n       - Vertices: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n       - Edges: {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}\n\n    2. Method: Deletion-Contraction on edge e = (1,2)\n       P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k)\n\n    3. Polynomial for G' = G - (1,2):\n       - This graph is a diamond graph on {2,3,4,5} with vertex 1 attached only to 5.\n       - Its chromatic polynomial is P(G', k) = k(k-1)^2(k-2)^2\n\n    4. Polynomial for G'' = G / (1,2):\n       - This graph is the complete graph K4.\n       - Its chromatic polynomial is P(K4, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n\n    5. Final Polynomial Calculation:\n       P(G, k) = k(k-1)^2(k-2)^2 - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n               = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) ]\n               = k(k-1)(k-2) * (k^2 - 3k + 2 - k + 3)\n               = k(k-1)(k-2) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)\n               = (k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)\n               = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k\n    \"\"\"\n    k = sympy.Symbol('k')\n\n    # The factored form of the polynomial\n    poly_factored = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) * (k**2 - 4*k + 5)\n\n    # The expanded form of the polynomial\n    poly_expanded = sympy.expand(poly_factored)\n\n    # Coefficients from the expanded polynomial\n    c5 = poly_expanded.coeff(k, 5)\n    c4 = poly_expanded.coeff(k, 4)\n    c3 = poly_expanded.coeff(k, 3)\n    c2 = poly_expanded.coeff(k, 2)\n    c1 = poly_expanded.coeff(k, 1)\n\n    print(\"The chromatic polynomial of the graph is P(k):\")\n    # Print the equation, showing each number as requested.\n    print(f\"P(k) = {c5}*k^5 + ({c4})*k^4 + {c3}*k^3 + ({c2})*k^2 + {c1}*k\")\n    print(f\"P(k) = k^5 - 7*k^4 + 19*k^3 - 23*k^2 + 10*k\")\n\nsolve_chromatic_polynomial()\n```\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
