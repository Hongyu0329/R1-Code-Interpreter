# This script is designed to provide the solution to the giraffe identification task.
# After careful visual analysis of the spot patterns, the correct match was determined.

# The target giraffe has a unique pattern on its side. I identified a specific
# cluster of spots: one shaped like a 'Y', another hexagonal patch above it,
# and a rectangular one next to it.

# By comparing this specific pattern cluster with all the options,
# it was found that only one giraffe has an identical pattern.

# Let's assign the correct option to a variable.
correct_image_letter = 'B'

# Print the final answer.
print(f"The image showing the same giraffe as the target is: {correct_image_letter}")
