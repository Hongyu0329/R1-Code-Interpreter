Yes, there is strong evidence of insect activity. The large white, fuzzy sphere is a woolly oak gall, which forms when a cynipid gall wasp lays an egg in the plant's tissue. The gall serves as a nursery and food source for the developing wasp larva inside. The egg that created this gall was laid directly on the twig where the gall is located. The adult wasp that eventually emerges from this gall will lay its eggs on the leaves or twigs of an oak tree.
