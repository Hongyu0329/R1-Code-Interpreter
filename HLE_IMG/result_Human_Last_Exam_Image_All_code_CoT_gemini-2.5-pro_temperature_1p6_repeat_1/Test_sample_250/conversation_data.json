    "This is a great musical puzzle! Based on the distinctive harmony in the sheet music, I can identify the title and composer. Here's my step-by-step thinking process:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Sheet Music**: I first looked at the key signature (two flats, B♭ and E♭), the time signature (4/4), and, most importantly, the chord progression. The piece starts in F minor.\n2.  **Identify the Characteristic Chord Progression**: The first four bars have a very unique and memorable sequence of chords: `F- | E-7(♭5) E♭-6 | D♭maj7 G7 | C7`. The chromatic descending motion from F to E to E♭ to D♭ is a strong clue.\n3.  **Cross-Reference with Jazz Standards**: I mentally scanned and searched for jazz standards that use this specific progression. While some tunes have descending lines (like \"Yesterdays\" or \"My Funny Valentine\"), this exact sequence of chord qualities and the subsequent modulation is highly specific.\n4.  **Pinpoint the Tune**: This progression is the signature A section of the jazz standard \"Israel\".\n5.  **Confirm the Composer and Other Sections**: I then confirmed the composer of \"Israel\" is John Carisi. To be certain, I compared the rest of the provided sheet music to the standard form of \"Israel\".\n    *   The bridge section in the sheet music (`D-7(♭5) | G7 | C7 | F7 | B♭-7 | E♭7 | A♭...`) perfectly matches the bridge of \"Israel,\" which is famous for its chain of `ii-V` progressions.\n    *   The last \"A\" section, which resolves to an F major chord, is a common arrangement choice for this tune.\n6.  **Final Conclusion**: The evidence from the chord progression in both the A and B sections confirms that the piece is \"Israel\" by John Carisi.\n\nHere is a Python script to print the answer.\n\n```python\ndef get_jazz_standard_info():\n  \"\"\"\n  Prints the title and composer of the identified jazz standard.\n  \"\"\"\n  title = \"Israel\"\n  composer = \"John Carisi\"\n  print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n  print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nget_jazz_standard_info()\n```\n<<<Title: Israel, Composer: John Carisi>>>"
