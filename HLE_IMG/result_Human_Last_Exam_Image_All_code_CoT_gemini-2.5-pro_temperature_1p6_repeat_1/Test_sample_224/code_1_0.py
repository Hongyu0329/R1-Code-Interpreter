    This function provides the number of non-isomorphic cycle double covers
    for the Petersen graph.

    A cycle double cover (CDC) of a graph is a collection of cycles where each
    edge of the graph is covered exactly twice. Two CDCs are considered
    isomorphic if one can be transformed into the other by a symmetry (an
    automorphism) of the graph.

    Determining this number computationally is a highly complex problem.
    The result presented here is based on established findings in mathematical
    graph theory literature. Research has shown that the Petersen graph has
    exactly 6 such non-isomorphic cycle double covers.
