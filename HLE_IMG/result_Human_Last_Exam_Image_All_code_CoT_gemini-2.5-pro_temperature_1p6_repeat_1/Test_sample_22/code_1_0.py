def find_unknot_indices():
    """
    Analyzes six knot diagrams to identify which are isotopic to the unknot.

    The knots are indexed 1 to 6 from left to right.
    Knot theory principles and visual inspection (using Reidemeister moves) are used
    to determine the nature of each knot.

    - K1 is the 6_1 knot (knotted).
    - K2 is a complex representation of the unknot.
    - K3 is the 6_2 knot (knotted).
    - K4 is the figure-eight knot (4_1) (knotted).
    - K5 is another complex representation of the unknot.
    - K6 is the mirror of the 6_1 knot (knotted).
    
    The function returns a list of indices corresponding to the unknots.
