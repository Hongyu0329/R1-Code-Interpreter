    "This image displays a genus-3 Heegaard diagram. To identify the 3-manifold it represents, we can determine its fundamental group, `π_1(M)`, from the diagram. The process involves identifying the generators and relations.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify Generators:** The three red circles, `α_1`, `α_2`, `α_3`, correspond to the three generators of the fundamental group, which we will label `a_1`, `a_2`, and `a_3`. These `α` curves are the meridians of a genus-3 handlebody `H_α`.\n2.  **Identify Relators:** The blue curves, `β_1`, `β_2`, `β_3`, define the relators of the group presentation. The blue lines form the graph of a triangular prism. In the standard interpretation of such diagrams, the `β` curves are the boundaries of the three quadrilateral faces of this prism. Although they intersect in the drawing, for a Heegaard diagram they are assumed to be pushed off each other to be disjoint.\n3.  **Derive the Group Presentation:** We will read the relators by seeing how each `β` curve winds around the handles defined by the `α` curves. Traversing the i-th handle from the inner vertex to the outer gives a generator `a_i`, and traversing in the reverse direction gives `a_i^{-1}`.\n    *   The curve `β_1` (not explicitly labeled, but by symmetry we can assign it) is the boundary of the quadrilateral face connecting vertices {1, 2, 2, 1}. Following this loop, we traverse handle 2 forwards (`a_2`) and handle 1 backwards (`a_1^{-1}`). This gives the relator `a_2 * a_1^{-1} = 1`.\n    *   The curve `β_2` corresponds to the face connecting {2, 3, 3, 2}. This gives the relator `a_3 * a_2^{-1} = 1`.\n    *   The curve `β_3` corresponds to the face connecting {3, 1, 1, 3}. This gives the relator `a_1 * a_3^{-1} = 1`.\n4.  **Simplify the Group:** We solve the relations to find the structure of the fundamental group.\n5.  **Identify the Manifold:** The fundamental group is a powerful invariant that will allow us to identify the manifold.\n\nThe following Python code will print out this chain of reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef identify_manifold():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the steps to identify the 3-manifold\n    from the given Heegaard diagram by calculating its fundamental group.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbolic generators for the fundamental group\n    a_1, a_2, a_3 = sympy.symbols('a_1 a_2 a_3')\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the Heegaard diagram components.\")\n    print(\"The diagram is a genus-3 Heegaard diagram.\")\n    print(\"The red curves (α_1, α_2, α_3) define the generators of the fundamental group.\")\n    print(f\"Generators: {a_1}, {a_2}, {a_3}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Identify the relators from the blue curves (β_1, β_2, β_3).\")\n    print(\"The blue graph is a triangular prism.
