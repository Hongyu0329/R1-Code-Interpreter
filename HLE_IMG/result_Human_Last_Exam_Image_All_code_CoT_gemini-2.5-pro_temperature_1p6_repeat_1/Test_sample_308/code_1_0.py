def solve_roller_drive_puzzle():
    """
    Solves the roller drive matching puzzle by applying kinematic principles and geometric analysis.

    The solution is based on the following logic:
    1. The number of cycles in the displacement plot (Np) generally equals the number of lobes on the driver (Nd).
    2. An exception occurs for smooth systems where Nd = 2 * N_driven. In these cases, Np = Nd / 2.
    3. Secondary features (shape, symmetry) distinguish between configurations with the same Np.

    # Mapping of Plot (A-H) to Configuration (1-8)
    # The list is indexed 0-7, corresponding to A-H.
    # The value is the configuration number.
    
    # A=2: Np=3. From Config 2 (Nd=6, Nn=3) by 2:1 symmetry rule.
    # B=7: Np=5. From Config 7 (Nd=5), unique lobe count.
    # C=3: Np=2. From Config 3 (Nd=2), unique asymmetric shape.
    # D=4: Np=4. From Config 4 (Nd=4), spiky shape. Default rule applies.
    # E=5: Np=6. From Config 5 (Nd=6). Default rule applies (6:4 is not 2:1).
    # F=1: Np=4. From Config 1 (Nd=4), highly symmetric/regular shape.
    # G=8: Np=3. From Config 8 (Nd=3), spiky driven roller creates sharp peaks.
    # H=6: Np=2. From Config 6 (Nd=4, Nn=2) by 2:1 symmetry rule.
