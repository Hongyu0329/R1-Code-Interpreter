    "This is a detail from an altarpiece, specifically a predella panel depicting the \"Sacrament of the Altar\" (the Eucharist). Based on the style of the glazed terracotta relief and the inscription, this work is attributed to a famous Renaissance artist.\n\nHere is the plan to identify the author:\n1.  **Analyze the artwork's style**: The white and blue glazed terracotta is a hallmark of the Della Robbia family workshop in Florence during the Renaissance.\n2.  **Identify the specific work**: The inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE LAVTEL\" (Sacrament of the Altar) and the scene of communion are key identifiers.\n3.  **Search for the artwork**: A search for \"Della Robbia Sacramenti de Lavtel\" leads to the altarpiece in the church of Santi Fiora e Lucilla in Santa Fiora, Italy.\n4.  **Confirm the artist**: This particular altarpiece is a well-known work by Andrea della Robbia, created between 1464 and 1470.\n\nTherefore, the author is Andrea della Robbia. I will now generate the Python code to print this name.\n\n```python\ndef find_artist():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the author of the artwork.\n  The artwork is a detail of a glazed terracotta altarpiece from the Italian Renaissance.\n  Based on the style and the inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE LAVTEL\", the piece is identified as part of the\n  altarpiece in Santa Fiora, Italy. Art historical sources attribute this work to Andrea della Robbia.\n  \"\"\"\n  author = \"Andrea della Robbia\"\n  print(f\"The author of this altarpiece detail is: {author}\")\n\nfind_artist()\n```\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
