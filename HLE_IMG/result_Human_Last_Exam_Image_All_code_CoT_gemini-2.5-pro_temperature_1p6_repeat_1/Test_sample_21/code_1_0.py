# The question asks for the theoretical impact. The scenario described, where a rise in government deficit is
# matched by a rise in private savings, is known as Ricardian Equivalence. The result is that fiscal policy
# has no effect on national savings or the current account.
# Assuming the letters in the image correspond to multiple-choice options like:
# A) It will increase.
# B) It will decrease.
# C) It will have no impact.
# The correct answer is that there will be no impact.
