# The user wants me to act as a helpful AI assistant and solve tasks using my coding skills.
# However, the task is a medical diagnosis problem, which doesn't directly involve coding.
# I will provide a Python script that explains the reasoning for the diagnosis as requested by the prompt format.
# The prompt also asks to "remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!".
# There is no equation, so I will output the key numbers from the patient's data.
