    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the stereochemical assignments:\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reactant (the acid chloride on the left):**\n    *   Identify the chiral center: It's the carbon atom connected to four different groups: a phenyl group (-Ph), a methoxy group (-OMe), a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3), and a carbonyl chloride group (-COCl).\n    *   Assign priorities to these groups based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules:\n        1.  **-OMe**: The oxygen atom has the highest atomic number (8) of the atoms directly attached to the chiral center.\n        2.  **-COCl**: The carbon atom is attached to a chlorine (atomic number 17), which outranks the fluorine atoms in the -CF3 group.\n        3.  **-CF3**: The carbon atom is attached to three fluorine atoms (atomic number 9).\n        4.  **-Ph**: The carbon atom is attached to other carbon atoms (atomic number 6), giving it the lowest priority.\n    *   Determine the configuration: The lowest priority group (-Ph, #4) is in the plane of the paper. The group on the dashed bond (-CF3, #3) is pointing away. To simplify, we can mentally swap the lowest priority group (-Ph) with the group pointing away (-CF3). Now, the path from priority 1 (-OMe) to 2 (-COCl) to 3 (-Ph) is clockwise, suggesting an (R) configuration for this imaginary molecule. Since we performed one swap, the original molecule must have the opposite configuration, which is **(S)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reactant (the alcohol in the middle):**\n    *   Identify the chiral center: It's the carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (-OH). The four groups are -OH, -H (implicit), -CH2OMe, and -CH2CH(Me)2.\n    *   Assign priorities:\n        1.  **-OH**: Oxygen has the highest atomic number.\n        2.  **-CH2OMe**: The carbon is bonded to an oxygen, which takes precedence over the carbon in the other alkyl chain.\n        3.  **-CH2CH(Me)2**: (isobutyl group).\n        4.  **-H**: Hydrogen has the lowest atomic number.\n    *   Determine the configuration: The -OH group is on a wedge (pointing out). This implies the lowest priority group (-H, #4) is on a dash (pointing away). With the lowest priority group in the back, we trace the path from 1 -> 2 -> 3. This path is clockwise. Therefore, the configuration is **(R)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the product (the ester on the right):**\n    *   The reaction is a standard esterification. It proceeds via a nucleophilic acyl substitution where the alcohol's oxygen attacks the carbonyl carbon of the acid chloride. Crucially, none of the bonds to the two original chiral centers are broken during this reaction.\n    *   Therefore, the stereochemistry of both centers is retained in the product.\n    *   The stereocenter from the acid chloride remains **(S)**.\n    *   The stereocenter from the alcohol remains **(R)**.\n\n4.  **Assemble the final sequence:**\n    *   The question asks for the assignments for the four stereocenters moving from left to right across the entire reaction scheme.\n    *   First, the stereocenter in the acid chloride reactant: **(S)**.\n    *   Second, the stereocenter in the alcohol reactant: **(R)**.\n    *   Third, in the product molecule, the stereocenter on the left side (from the alcohol): **(R)**.\n    *   Fourth, in the product molecule, the stereocenter on the right side (from the acid chloride): **(S)**.\n    *   The complete sequence is: (S), (R), (R), (S).\n\n```python\ndef solve_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and prints the stereochemical assignments for the reaction.\n    The order is: Reactant 1, Reactant 2, Product-left-center, Product-right-center.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Stereochemical assignment for the first reactant (acid chloride)\n    reactant1_config = \"(S)\"\n\n    # Stereochemical assignment for the second reactant (alcohol)\n    reactant2_config = \"(R)\"\n\n    # The reaction is an esterification that retains the stereochemistry of both centers.\n    # The product is drawn with the alcohol-derived part on the left and the acid-derived part on the right.\n    product_config_left = reactant2_config  # from alcohol\n    product_config_right = reactant1_config # from acid chloride\n\n    # The four assignments moving from left to right in the scheme are:\n    # 1. Reactant 1\n    # 2. Reactant 2\n    # 3. Product's left stereocenter (derived from alcohol)\n    # 4.
