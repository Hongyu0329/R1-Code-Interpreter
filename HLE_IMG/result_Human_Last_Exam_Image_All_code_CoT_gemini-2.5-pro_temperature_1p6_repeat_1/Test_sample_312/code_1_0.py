    This function executes the plan to identify the chiral index 'm' for each plot.

    1.  Properties of (4,m) SWNTs:
        - (4,0): Zigzag, Semiconducting, Smallest diameter.
        - (4,1): Chiral, Metallic, Small diameter.
        - (4,2): Chiral, Semiconducting, Medium diameter.
        - (4,3): Chiral, Semiconducting (small gap), Large diameter.
        - (4,4): Armchair, Metallic, Largest diameter.

    2.  Identify Oscillator Plots (#2, #4, #6, #8):
        - Plot #6 (horizontal lines) -> Zigzag -> m=0.
        - Plot #4 (vertical lines) -> Armchair -> m=4.
        - Plot #8 (tilted lines through K-points) -> Chiral Metallic -> m=1.
        - Plot #2 (tilted lines avoiding K-points) -> Chiral Semiconducting. Based on line density, it corresponds to (4,2) -> m=2.
        - The oscillator plot for (4,3) is missing.

    3.  Pair Oscillator and Band Structure Plots:
        - (4,0): Smallest diameter, largest gap semiconductor -> Plot #9. Thus, Plots #6 and #9 correspond to m=0.
        - (4,1): Small diameter, metallic -> Plot #1. Thus, Plots #8 and #1 correspond to m=1.
        - (4,4): Largest diameter, metallic -> Plot #5. Thus, Plots #4 and #5 correspond to m=4.
        - (4,2): Medium diameter, semiconductor -> Plot #7. Thus, Plots #2 and #7 correspond to m=2.
        - (4,3): The remaining tube. Its band structure is the remaining plot, #3. This is consistent as (4,3) has a large diameter (high band density) and a small gap (appearing metallic).

    4.  Assemble the final sequence of 'm' values for plots 1 through 9.
