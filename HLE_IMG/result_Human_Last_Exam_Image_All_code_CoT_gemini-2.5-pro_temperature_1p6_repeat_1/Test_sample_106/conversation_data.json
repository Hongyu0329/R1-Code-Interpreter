    "Here is my thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Overall Reaction:** The reaction starts with a saturated pentacyclic alcohol and, upon heating with a catalytic amount of acid (HCl), it dehydrates (loses H₂O) and rearranges to form a new alkene. The problem statement explicitly mentions that the transformation involves \"[1,2] shifts,\" which points towards a Wagner-Meerwein type carbocation rearrangement.\n\n2.  **Identify Reactant and Product Skeletons:**\n    *   **Reactant:** The reactant is a derivative of a pentacyclic triterpene. By comparing its structure to known triterpenes, it can be identified as having an oleanane skeleton. The specific compound is oleanan-3β-ol. Let's note the key substituents at the carbons that might be involved in rearrangement:\n        *   Two methyl groups on C4.\n        *   A hydrogen on C5.\n        *   A methyl group on C8.\n        *   A hydrogen on C9.\n        *   A methyl group on C10.\n        *   A hydrogen on C13.\n        *   A methyl group on C14.\n    *   **Product:** The product has a double bond between C12 and C13, which is characteristic of the olean-12-ene skeleton. Several substituents are highlighted with numbers 1 through 5.\n\n3.  **Propose a Reaction Mechanism:** The goal is to find a plausible series of steps that converts the reactant to the product. The driving force is the formation of a stable tertiary carbocation and ultimately the thermodynamically stable tetrasubstituted alkene.\n\n    *   **Step 1: Carbocation Formation.** The acid protonates the -OH group, turning it into a good leaving group (-OH₂⁺). This leaves as a water molecule, generating a secondary carbocation at C3.\n    *   **Step 2: Initial 1,2-Shift.** The C3 secondary carbocation is relatively unstable. It can rearrange to a more stable tertiary carbocation. A 1,2-methyl shift from the adjacent C4 (which has two methyl groups) to C3 is highly favorable. This moves one of the methyl groups from C4 to C3 and places the positive charge on C4, which is a tertiary carbocation.\n    *   **Step 3: Transannular Hydride Shift.** Now we have a carbocation at C4 (`C4+`). To form the observed double bond at C12=C13, the positive charge needs to migrate to C13. While a full \"backbone rearrangement\" cascade of multiple 1,2-shifts is possible, it leads to a substitution pattern inconsistent with the product drawing. A more direct route is a transannular hydride shift. In the rigid cage-like structure of the triterpene, the hydrogen at C13 is spatially close to the carbocation at C4. A hydride ion (H⁻) shifts from C13 directly to C4. This is a long-range, but geometrically feasible, 1,2-shift (in terms of space, not bond connectivity). This shift neutralizes the charge at C4 (leaving it with one original methyl group and the new hydrogen) and transfers the positive charge to C13.\n    *   **Step 4: Elimination.** We now have a tertiary carbocation at C13 (`C13+`). To form the final stable alkene, a proton (H⁺) is removed from an adjacent carbon. The removal of a proton from C12 creates the C12=C13 double bond, yielding the final product.\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Substituents:** Based on this mechanism, let's track the substituents at the numbered positions.\n\n    *   **Position 1 (on C4):** C4 started with two CH₃ groups. One CH₃ migrated to C3. An H migrated from C13 to C4. Thus, C4 is left with one CH₃ group. The substituent at position 1 is **CH₃**.\n    *   **Position 2 (on C10):** The methyl group on C10 was not involved in this mechanism. It remains a **CH₃**.\n    *   **Position 3 (on C5):** The hydrogen atom on C5 was not involved. It remains an **H**. (The dashed bond to a dot in the diagram signifies an H atom).\n    *   **Position 4 (on C8):** The methyl group on C8 was not involved. It remains a **CH₃**.\n    *   **Position 5 (on C9):** The hydrogen atom on C9 was not involved. It remains an **H**.\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    *   1 = CH₃\n    *   2 = CH₃\n    *   3 = H\n    *   4 = CH₃\n    *   5 = H\n\nI will now generate the Python code to print this answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rearrangement():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the substituents at the numbered positions in the product\n    of the given rearrangement reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    substituents = {\n        1: \"CH3\",\n        2: \"CH3\",\n        3: \"H\",\n        4: \"CH3\",\n        5: \"H\"\n    }\n\n    # Print the result in the specified format\n    # The final equation is the list of substituents at each position.\n    output_parts = []\n    for position in sorted(substituents.keys()):\n        substituent = substituents[position]\n        output_parts.append(f\"{position} = {substituent}\")\n\n    print(\", \".join(output_parts))\n\nsolve_rearrangement()\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
