    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Identify Molecules**: I will first identify the three distinct molecules depicted in the image: the two reactants and the final product of the chemical reaction.\n2.  **Determine SMILES**: I will determine the SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) string for each of these three molecules. This canonical representation is necessary for computational processing.\n    *   Reactant 1 (R1): Based on the structure, this appears to be `3-((2,3,4-trimethoxybenzyl)oxy)-5-fluoropyridin-2-amine`.\n    *   Reactant 2 (R2): The drawing shows a `pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazine` derivative with a chlorine atom on one of the nitrogen atoms of the five-membered ring. I'll interpret this as `6-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazine`.\n    *   Product (P): The product of the reaction appears to be `N-(6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazin-2-yl)-5-fluoropyridin-2-amine`.\n3.  **Filter by Crippen logP**: The problem specifies that we should only consider molecules with a Crippen logP value greater than 1. Using the `rdkit` library in Python, I will calculate this value for all three molecules.\n4.  **Calculate Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI)**: For each molecule that passes the logP > 1 filter, I will calculate its Eccentric Connectivity Index. The ECI of a molecule is the sum of products of vertex degree (v_i) and eccentricity (e_i) for all atoms `i` in the molecule, including hydrogens (`ECI = Î£ v_i * e_i`). The eccentricity of an atom is the length of the longest shortest path from that atom to any other atom in the molecular graph.\n5.  **Sum and Output**: I will sum the ECI values of all qualifying molecules. The final python code will print out each individual `degree * eccentricity` term that contributes to this total sum, followed by the final result, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport rdkit\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem import Crippen\nfrom rdkit.Chem import GraphDescriptors\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies molecules with Crippen logP > 1 from a given set,\n    calculates their Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI), and prints the sum.\n    The ECI calculation includes hydrogen atoms.\n    \"\"\"\n    # SMILES strings for the three molecules based on visual interpretation of the reaction\n    # Reactant 1: 3-((2,3,4-trimethoxybenzyl)oxy)-5-fluoropyridin-2-amine\n    smiles_r1 = \"COC1=C(OC)C(OC)=CC=C1COC2=C(N)C(=CN=C2)F\"\n    # Reactant 2: 6-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazine\n    smiles_r2 = \"c1cnc2c(n1)CN(Cl)C2\"\n    # Product: N-(6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazin-2-yl)-5-fluoropyridin-2-amine\n    smiles_p = \"Fc1cc(Nc2cnc3c(n2)NCC3)cn1\"\n\n    molecules = {\n        \"Reactant 1\": smiles_r1,\n        \"Reactant 2\": smiles_r2,\n        \"Product\": smiles_p\n    }\n\n    qualifying_molecules = []\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Depicted Molecules ---\")\n    for name, smiles in molecules.items():\n        mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)\n        if mol is None:\n            print(f\"Could not parse SMILES for {name}\")\n            continue\n        \n        mol_h = Chem.AddHs(mol)\n        logp = Crippen.MolLogP(mol_h)\n        print(f\"{name} (SMILES: {smiles}) has Crippen logP = {logp:.3f}\")\n        \n        if logp > 1:\n            print(f\"-> This molecule qualifies (logP > 1).\")\n            qualifying_molecules.append(mol_h)\n        else:\n            print(f\"-> This molecule does not qualify (logP <= 1).\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Calculating Sum of Eccentric Connectivity Indices ---\")\n\n    total_eci = 0\n    all_terms_for_print = []\n\n    if not qualifying_molecules:\n        print(\"No molecules with logP > 1 found.\")\n    else:\n        for mol_h in qualifying_molecules:\n            dist_matrix = Chem.GetDistanceMatrix(mol_h)\n            num_atoms = mol_h.GetNumAtoms()\n            for i in range(num_atoms):\n                atom = mol_h.GetAtomWithIdx(i)\n                degree = atom.GetDegree()\n                # Eccentricity for atom i is the max value in its row/column in the distance matrix\n                eccentricity = int(max(dist_matrix[i]))\n                term_value = degree * eccentricity\n                total_eci += term_value\n                all_terms_for_print.append(f\"{degree}*{eccentricity}\")\n\n        equation_str = \" + \".join(all_terms_for_print)\n        print(\"The final sum is calculated from the following terms (degree * eccentricity for each atom):\")\n        print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_eci}\")\n\n    # Final answer in the required format\n    print(f\"\\nFinal calculated sum: {total_eci}\")\n    print(f\"<<<{total_eci}>>>\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n```"
