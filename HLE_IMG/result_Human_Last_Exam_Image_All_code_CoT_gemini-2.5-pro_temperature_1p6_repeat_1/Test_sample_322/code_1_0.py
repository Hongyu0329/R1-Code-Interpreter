    Analyzes the 16 vortex trajectory plots to identify the unique vortex in each.

    The analysis is based on visual inspection of the dynamics:
    - A vortex with twice the strength (uppercase) acts as a central pivot, with the other two orbiting it.
    - A vortex with half the strength (lowercase) is pushed around by the dominant pair of stronger vortices.

    The sequence corresponds to plots #1 through #16.

    G/g: Green (twice/half strength)
    R/r: Red (twice/half strength)
