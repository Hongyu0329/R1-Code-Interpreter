    "Based on the visual characteristics of the organism in the image, I can identify its genus. The epiphyte on the tree bark exhibits a very distinctive morphology: it is dark, flattened, and forms an intricate, web-like pattern through repeated forked branching (dichotomous branching). This structure is characteristic of a thalloid liverwort, specifically one from the genus *Metzgeria*, commonly known as forked veilworts.\n\nHere is a Python script to output the identified genus.\n\n```python\ndef identify_genus():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the genus of the epiphytic species in the image.\n    The species shows a dark, flat, dichotomously branching thallus,\n    which is characteristic of the forked veilworts.\n    \"\"\"\n    genus = \"Metzgeria\"\n    print(f\"The genus of the epiphytic species is: {genus}\")\n\nidentify_genus()\n```\n<<<Metzgeria>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the genus of the epiphytic species in this image? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
