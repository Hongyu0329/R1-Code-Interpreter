    This function prints the solution to the Navier-Stokes plot analysis problem.
    The solution is deduced through a step-by-step analysis of the system's
    equations and the provided simulation plots.

    The 9-character solution string is composed as follows:
    - Character 1: The integer k, where Re = 50*k. Deduced from the average value of x3.
    - Characters 2-5: The plot labels (f,g,h,i) corresponding to the horizontal axes x1, x2, x3, and x4 respectively. Deduced by comparing axis ranges and dynamic behavior between simulations.
    - Characters 6-9: The parameter change for each simulation (1, 2, 3, 4). Deduced by observing the effect of the change on the system's attractor.
