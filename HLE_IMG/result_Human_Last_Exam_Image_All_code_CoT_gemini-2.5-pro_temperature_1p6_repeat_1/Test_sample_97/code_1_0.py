print("Let R be the radius of a white circle. Let h be the vertical distance between the centerlines of adjacent rows of white circles.")
print("If circles in adjacent rows are tangent, they form a hexagonal packing.")
print("In this packing, the relationship between h and R is given by the equation from three mutually tangent circles: h^2 + R^2 = (2*R)^2.")
print("This simplifies to h = R * sqrt(3).")
print("The problem states all coordinates are multiples of 0.5. This means R, h, and circle center coordinates must be rational numbers.")
print("However, if R is a rational number, R * sqrt(3) is an irrational number.")
print("The y-coordinate of a circle's center in the bottom row, y_B, would be y_M - h, where y_M is the rational y-coordinate of the middle row's center.")
print("A rational number (y_M) minus an irrational number (h) results in an irrational number. This contradicts the given rules.")
print("Therefore, the initial assumption of tangency between white circles in different rows is false. There must be a gap.")

print("Let r be the radius of a yellow circle. From the coordinates (4, 0.5) and tangency to the edge, we know r = 0.5 cm.")
print("If a yellow circle is tangent to a white circle, the distance between their centers is R + r = R + 0.5.")

r = 0.5
print(f"Substituting r = {r}, the final equation is: y_B^2 - {2.0*r} * y_B = {2.0*r} * R, which simplifies to y_B^2 - y_B = R")
print("We must check if this equation can be satisfied with R and y_B being multiples of 0.5.")
print("Let's test y_B = 3.0 (which is a multiple of 0.5).")
y_B_example = 3.0
R_example = y_B_example**2 - y_B_example
print(f"The equation becomes R = {y_B_example}^2 - {1.0} * {y_B_example} = {R_example}")
print(f"The resulting R = {R_example} is also a multiple of 0.5. So a valid solution exists where the circles are tangent.")
