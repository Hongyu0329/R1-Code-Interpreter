    "Here is my plan to solve the task:\n\n1.  **Analyze each molecule's structure:** I will identify the key structural features of each lactam (A, B, and C) that influence its stability and reactivity. The main factors to consider are ring strain and amide resonance.\n2.  **Evaluate Ring Strain:** I will compare the ring sizes. β-lactams (4-membered rings) are much more strained than γ-lactams (5-membered rings) or δ-lactams (6-membered rings). Higher strain leads to higher reactivity.\n3.  **Evaluate Amide Resonance:** Amide resonance (delocalization of the nitrogen lone pair into the carbonyl) stabilizes the amide bond and makes it less reactive. I will check if any of the structures have a geometry that prevents this resonance. A key concept here is **Bredt's Rule**, which states that a double bond cannot be formed at a bridgehead position in a small bicyclic system. This applies to the resonance contributor where the nitrogen forms a double bond with the carbonyl carbon. If resonance is inhibited, the carbonyl becomes more ketone-like and highly reactive.\n4.  **Combine Factors and Rank:** I will combine these factors to establish a final ranking from most reactive to least reactive. The inhibition of amide resonance (as seen in bridged systems like C) is a very powerful effect, generally making a lactam more reactive than one that is only strained by ring angle (like A).\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that formalizes this logic, stores the information about each molecule, sorts them according to the derived reactivity order, and prints the final ranking with a clear explanation for each molecule's position.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams_reactivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks lactams A, B, and C from most strained/reactive to least.\n\n    The ranking is based on two main principles:\n    1.  Amide Resonance Inhibition (Bredt's Rule Effect): Structures that force the\n        amide nitrogen into a non-planar (pyramidal) geometry prevent resonance.\n        This severely destabilizes the lactam and makes it extremely reactive.\n    2.  Ring Strain: Smaller lactam rings (e.g., 4-membered β-lactams) have\n        significant angle strain, making them more reactive than less-strained\n        larger rings (e.g., 5-membered γ-lactams).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    molecules = {\n        'A': {\n            'description': \"Contains a 4-membered β-lactam ring. Its high reactivity comes from significant ring strain.\",\n            'rank': 2\n        },\n        'B': {\n            'description': \"Contains a 5-membered γ-lactam ring. This is the most stable and least strained system among the three.\",\n            'rank': 3\n        },\n        'C': {\n            'description': \"A bridged lactam where the nitrogen is at a bridgehead. This geometry prevents planarity, thus inhibiting amide resonance (Bredt's rule effect). This makes the carbonyl carbon extremely electrophilic and the molecule exceptionally reactive.\",\n            'rank': 1\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Sort molecules by their rank (1 = most reactive, 3 = least reactive)\n    ranked_order = sorted(molecules.keys(), key=lambda k: molecules[k]['rank'])\n\n    print(\"Ranking from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive:\\n\")\n    print(\" -> \".join(ranked_order))\n    print(\"\\n--- Justification ---\")\n\n    for i, molecule_id in enumerate(ranked_order):\n      position = \"\"\n      if i == 0:\n        position = \"Most Reactive\"\n      elif i == 1:\n        position = \"Intermediate Reactivity\"\n      else:\n        position = \"Least Reactive\"\n      \n      print(f\"\\n{i+1}.
