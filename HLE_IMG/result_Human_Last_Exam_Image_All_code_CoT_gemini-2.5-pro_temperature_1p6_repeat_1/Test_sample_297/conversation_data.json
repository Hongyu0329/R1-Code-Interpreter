    "My plan is to find the secret message hidden in the image.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The image has peculiar borders. The right border shows a clean, repeating sequence of 8 colors: Black, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Magenta, Cyan, White. The left border has a noisy sequence of the same colors. This suggests that the right border is a key or legend, and the left border contains the encoded data. The main character is pointing towards this left border, further reinforcing this idea.\n2.  **Determine the Encoding:** The 8 colors can be mapped to 3-bit numbers (0 to 7), based on their Red, Green, and Blue components. For example, Black (no colors) is `000` (0), Red is `001` (1), Green is `010` (2), Yellow (Red+Green) is `011` (3), and so on, up to White (Red+Green+Blue) being `111` (7). This establishes a way to convert each colored pixel on the left border into a 3-bit value.\n3.  **Extract the Data:** I will write a Python script to perform the decoding. The script will:\n    *   Download and open the image.\n    *   Iterate down a column of pixels on the left border (from `y=16` to `y=583`, below the top border and above the bottom one).\n    *   For each pixel, find the closest match in our 8-color palette and get its corresponding 3-bit value.\n    *   Append these 3 bits to a long bitstream.\n4.  **Decode the Message:** Once the full bitstream is extracted from the border, I will group the bits into 8-bit chunks (bytes). Each byte will then be converted into an ASCII character.\n5.  **Reveal the Word:** By joining all the decoded characters, the hidden secret word will be revealed, which I will then print.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport io\nimport math\nfrom PIL import Image\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Downloads the image, extracts the hidden message from the left border,\n    decodes it, and prints the secret word.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The URL of the image containing the secret message\n    image_url = \"https://storage.googleapis.com/testmaker-prod-project-184518.appspot.com/assets/images/30372_1_400_600_400_600.png\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the mapping from colors to 3-bit values (trits)\n    # The value is calculated as: 4*Blue_bit + 2*Green_bit + 1*Red_bit\n    COLOR_MAP = {\n        (0, 0, 0): 0,        # Black: 000\n        (255, 0, 0): 1,      # Red:   001\n        (0, 255, 0): 2,      # Green: 010\n        (255, 255, 0): 3,    # Yellow:011\n        (0, 0, 255): 4,      # Blue:  100\n        (255, 0, 255): 5,    # Magenta:101\n        (0, 255, 255): 6,    # Cyan:  110\n        (255, 255, 255): 7   # White: 111\n    }\n\n    # Helper function to find the closest color in our map for a given pixel\n    def get_closest_color_value(pixel_rgb):\n        min_dist = float('inf')\n        value = -1\n        # Unpack the pixel's RGB, ignoring alpha if it exists\n        r1, g1, b1 = pixel_rgb[:3]\n        for color_rgb, trit_val in COLOR_MAP.items():\n            r2, g2, b2 = color_rgb\n            # Calculate Euclidean distance in RGB space\n            dist = math.sqrt((r1 - r2)**2 + (g1 - g2)**2 + (b1 - b2)**2)\n            if dist < min_dist:\n                min_dist = dist\n                value = trit_val\n        return value\n\n    # Step 2: Download and load the image\n    try:\n        response = requests.get(image_url)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes\n        img = Image.open(io.BytesIO(response.content))\n        pixels = img.load()\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error loading image: {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 3: Extract the bitstream from the left border\n    bit_stream = []\n    # The data is in a column on the left border.
