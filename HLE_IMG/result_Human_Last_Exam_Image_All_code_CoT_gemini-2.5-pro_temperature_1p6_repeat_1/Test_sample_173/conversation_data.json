    "To determine the time signature of the musical measure, we need to add up the durations of all the notes and rests within one measure for both the top and bottom staves. The total duration must be the same for both. The time signature is expressed as a fraction where the top number indicates the number of beats per measure, and the bottom number indicates the note value that gets one beat (e.g., 4 for a quarter note, 8 for an eighth note).\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Top Staff (Right Hand):** I will identify the notes and rests and calculate their total duration. The notes are grouped in a way that suggests distinct beats.\n    *   The measure is composed of three groups of beamed notes. Each group consists of notes and/or rests equivalent to four sixteenth notes.\n    *   Four sixteenth notes equal one quarter note (4 * 1/16 = 1/4).\n    *   Since there are three such groups, the total duration is three quarter notes.\n2.  **Analyze the Bottom Staff (Left Hand):** I will perform the same calculation for the bottom staff to confirm the duration.\n    *   The first beat consists of a dotted eighth note followed by a sixteenth note. A dotted eighth note (3/16) plus a sixteenth note (1/16) equals four sixteenth notes (4/16), which simplifies to one quarter note (1/4).\n    *   The second and third beats are each a single quarter note.\n    *   The total duration is one quarter note + one quarter note + one quarter note, which equals three quarter notes.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Both staves have a total duration equivalent to three quarter notes. This means there are 3 beats per measure, and the quarter note gets the beat. Therefore, the time signature is 3/4.\n\nI will now write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_time_signature():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the note durations in the provided musical measure to determine the time signature.\n    The analysis is done for both the top and bottom staves.
