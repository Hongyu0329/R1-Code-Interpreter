    "Here is my thinking process to solve this geometry problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:**\n    *   We have a large circular sector with its center at the bottom vertex (let's call it O).\n    *   The radius of the sector is given as `R = 34`.\n    *   The sector is divided into four smaller sectors by radii, and each has an angle labeled `θ`. The total angle of the large sector is `4θ`.\n    *   There are blue and red shaded regions which overlap in the middle. The total area of these shaded regions is what we need to find.\n    *   A crucial piece of information is a line segment of length 17. Looking closely at the diagram, this segment starts from a point on the leftmost arc (let's call it P1 on radius r1) and ends at a point (let's call it H) on the next radius (r2). A right-angle symbol indicates that the segment P1H is perpendicular to the radius r2.\n    *   Symmetry is apparent in the figure. The red region is a mirror image of the blue region.\n\n2.  **Determine the angle θ:**\n    *   Consider the right-angled triangle formed by the center O, the point P1 on the arc, and the point H on radius r2. The vertices are O, H, and P1. The right angle is at H.\n    *   The hypotenuse of this triangle is the radius from O to P1, so `OP1 = R = 34`.\n    *   The side opposite the angle `θ` (which is `<H O P1`) is the segment `P1H`. Its length is given as `17`.\n    *   Using trigonometry in the right-angled triangle `OHP1`:\n        `sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse = P1H / OP1 = 17 / 34 = 1/2`.\n    *   The angle `θ` for which `sin(θ) = 1/2` is `30°` or `π/6` radians.\n\n3.  **Identify key geometric shapes:**\n    *   The blue shaded region appears to be associated with the sector from radius `r1` to `r3`, which has an angle of `2θ`.\n    *   Since `θ = 30°`, the angle `2θ = 60°`.\n    *   Let's examine the triangle formed by the center O and the endpoints of this `60°` arc, P1 and P3. The vertices are O, P1, and P3.\n    *   The sides `OP1` and `OP3` are both radii, so `OP1 = OP3 = 34`.\n    *   The angle between these two sides is `2θ = 60°`.\n    *   A triangle with two equal sides and a `60°` angle between them is an equilateral triangle.\n    *   To confirm, the length of the third side (the chord P1P3) can be calculated: `2 * R * sin((2θ)/2) = 2 * 34 * sin(30°) = 68 * (1/2) = 34`.\n    *   So, triangle `OP1P3` is an equilateral triangle with a side length of 34.\n\n4.  **Formulate a hypothesis for the area:**\n    *   In many complex geometry problems of this type, the area of a complex shaded region is often equal to the area of a simpler shape hidden within the construction.\n    *   The fact that the given numbers (`17` and `34`) lead to a perfect equilateral triangle (`OP1P3`) is a very strong hint.\n    *   By symmetry, the triangle `OP2P4` associated with the red region is also an equilateral triangle with the same area.\n    *   The sum of the areas of the two triangles that defined the geometry in the first place is `Area(OHP1) + Area(OKP4)`. Let's calculate this.\n        *   In triangle `OHP1`: `OH = 34 * cos(30) = 17*sqrt(3)`. Area = `(1/2) * OH * P1H = (1/2) * 17*sqrt(3) * 17 = 289*sqrt(3)/2`.\n        *   The sum of the two construction triangles is `2 * (289*sqrt(3)/2) = 289*sqrt(3)`.\n    *   Now, let's calculate the area of the equilateral triangle `OP1P3`. Area = `(sqrt(3)/4) * side^2 = (sqrt(3)/4) * 34^2 = (sqrt(3)/4) * 1156 = 289*sqrt(3)`.\n    *   The areas match. This suggests a deep connection. A common pattern in such problems is that the complex shaded area can be rearranged or is equivalent to this simple, elegant shape's area. I will proceed with the hypothesis that the total shaded area is equal to the area of this equilateral triangle.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final area:**\n    *   The total shaded area is equal to the area of the equilateral triangle with side length 34.\n    *   The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is `Area = (sqrt(3)/4) * a^2`, where `a` is the side length.\n    *   `Area = (sqrt(3)/4) * 34^2 = 289 * sqrt(3)`.\n\nNow, I will write the Python code to perform this calculation and present the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_area():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total area of the shaded regions based on the geometric properties of the figure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The radius of the large circular sector\n    radius = 34\n    \n    # A key feature is a right-angled triangle formed by the center O, a point P1 on the arc,\n    # and a point H on an adjacent radius.
