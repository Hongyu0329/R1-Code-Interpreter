    "The characters on the seal are in an ancient style of Chinese calligraphy known as seal script (篆書, zhuànshū). Chinese seals are traditionally read from right to left, and from top to bottom.\n\nFollowing this convention:\n1.  **Top Right Character:** 長 (cháng), which simplifies to **长**.\n2.  **Bottom Right Character:** 樂 (lè), which simplifies to **乐**.\n3.  **Top Left Character:** 不 (bù), which is the same in simplified script.\n4.  **Bottom Left Character:** 忘 (wàng), which is the same in simplified script.\n\nWhen read together, they form the phrase **长乐不忘 (cháng lè bù wàng)**, which is an auspicious saying meaning \"Eternal happiness, never forgotten.\"\n\nHere is a Python script to display the simplified Chinese characters.\n\n```python\n# The characters identified from the seal, in simplified Chinese.\nseal_characters = \"长乐不忘\"\n\n# Print the result.\nprint(f\"The characters on the seal in simplified Chinese are: {seal_characters}\")\n```\n<<<长乐不忘>>>"
