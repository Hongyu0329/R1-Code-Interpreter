    "Based on the visual evidence, the lesion shown is secondary or recurrent caries located in the pits and fissures of the occlusal (biting) surface of a posterior tooth, surrounding an existing restoration. According to G.V. Black's classification system, which is based on the location of the carious lesion, this falls into a specific category.\n\nHere is a python script that outlines the logical steps to arrive at the classification.\n\n```python\ndef get_caries_classification(location, tooth_type):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the G.V. Black caries classification based on lesion location.\n    The image shows a lesion on the occlusal surface of a posterior tooth.\n    Even though it is recurrent decay around a filling, its location\n    is the determining factor for its G.V. Black class.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Dental Caries Classification Diagnosis ---\")\n    print(f\"Step 1: Identify the location of the lesion.\")\n    print(f\"Observation: The decay is in the pits and fissures on the occlusal surface of a '{tooth_type}'.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Apply G.V. Black's Classification Rules.\")\n\n    classification = \"Undetermined\"\n    # G.V.
