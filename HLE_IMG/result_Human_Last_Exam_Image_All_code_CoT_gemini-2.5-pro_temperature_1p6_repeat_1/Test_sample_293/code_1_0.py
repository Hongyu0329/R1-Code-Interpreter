    - Tissue: Kidney
    - Main Structure: Glomerulus
    - Key Finding: A large, cellular, crescent-shaped proliferation of cells is observed filling Bowman's space.
                   This is a classic 'crescent' formation. The underlying glomerular tuft is compressed.
    
    Diagnosis:
    The presence of extensive glomerular crescents is the hallmark of Crescentic Glomerulonephritis.
