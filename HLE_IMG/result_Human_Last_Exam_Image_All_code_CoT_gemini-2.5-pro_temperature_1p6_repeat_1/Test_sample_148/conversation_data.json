    "Based on the clinical information and the provided image, here is my analysis:\n\n**Patient Information:** 28-year-old female with a mass in the sella turcica. The sella turcica is the location of the pituitary gland.\n\n**Image Analysis:**\nThe crush smear image displays the following features:\n1.  **Cellularity and Arrangement:** There are cohesive, syncytial-like clusters of cells, meaning the cell borders are indistinct. The cells are also seen individually and in smaller groups.\n2.  **Cell Morphology:** The cells are quite uniform (monomorphic) in size and shape.\n3.  **Nuclear Features:** The nuclei are round to oval and contain stippled or \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin. This chromatin pattern is characteristic of neuroendocrine tumors.\n4.  **Cytoplasmic Features:** The cytoplasm is granular and eosinophilic (pink).\n5.  **Background:** The background has a finely granular, somewhat fibrillary appearance, which is often seen in smears of pituitary adenomas.\n6.  **Mitotic Activity/Necrosis:** There are no obvious signs of high-grade features like prominent mitotic activity, significant nuclear pleomorphism, or necrosis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of the clinical presentation (a mass in the pituitary region in a young adult) and the cytological features (monotonous cells with \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin arranged in syncytial sheets) is classic for a pituitary adenoma.\n\nI do not have a coding task to perform. I will provide the final diagnosis directly.\n<<<Pituitary adenoma>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
