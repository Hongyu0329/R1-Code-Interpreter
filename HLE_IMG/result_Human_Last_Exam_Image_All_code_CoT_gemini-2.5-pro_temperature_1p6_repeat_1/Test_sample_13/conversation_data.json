    "To solve this Kakuro puzzle and find the numbers in the two top white squares, we will use logical deduction based on the given clues. Let's label the two top squares as 'A' (left) and 'B' (right), and the square below 'A' as 'C'.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Identify the definite mathematical relationships (equations) for the top part of the puzzle from the most reliable clues.\n2.  List the possible combinations of single digits (1-9) for each of these sums.\n3.  Use a process of elimination to find the unique values for squares 'A' and 'B'.\n4.  The code will implement this logical process and print the determined values along with the equations that prove the result.\n\nHere are the key equations we can deduce from the puzzle diagram:\n*   **Row 1:** The clue to the left is `15`. This applies to the two top squares, 'A' and 'B'.\n    *   `A + B = 15`\n*   **Column 1:** The clue above square 'A' is `17`. The column run consists of 'A' and the square below it, 'C'.\n    *   `A + C = 17`\n*   **Column 2:** The clue above square 'B' is `29`. The column run below it has four squares. The sum of four unique digits from 1-9 that equals 29 is unique.\n    *   `B + (three other cells) = 29`. The only combination of four unique digits summing to 29 is `{5, 7, 8, 9}`. Therefore, 'B' must be one of these four numbers.\n\nNow, we can use this information to find the specific values for A and B.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_kakuro_top_squares():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the top two squares of the Kakuro puzzle using logical deduction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Find the unique combination of 4 distinct digits (1-9) that sum to 29\n    possible_digits = list(range(1, 10))\n    sum_29_combo = []\n    for combo in itertools.combinations(possible_digits, 4):\n        if sum(combo) == 29:\n            sum_29_combo = list(combo)\n            break\n    \n    # From A + C = 17, the only pair of unique digits is {8, 9}\n    # We test both possibilities for A.\n    \n    # Case 1: Assume A = 8\n    A_1 = 8\n    C_1 = 17 - A_1  # C must be 9\n    B_1 = 15 - A_1  # B must be 7\n    \n    # Check if B_1 is valid.
