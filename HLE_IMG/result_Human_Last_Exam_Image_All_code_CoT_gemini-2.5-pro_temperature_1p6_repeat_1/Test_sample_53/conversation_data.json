    "This image is a photograph of an Apulian red-figure pelike (a type of jar) dating from around 340-330 BC, attributed to the circle of the Darius Painter. The scene depicted is a classic mythological one. My plan to identify the figure is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the iconography**: I will examine the key figures and symbols in the scene. We see a chariot, a winged driver, a passenger ascending, and a fallen figure on the ground.\n2.  **Interpret the scene**: The combination of a chariot and an ascent to the sky strongly suggests an \"apotheosis,\" which is the elevation of a mortal to divine status. The winged figure is a clear indicator of divinity.\n3.  **Identify the figures**:\n    *   The winged driver is likely Nike, the goddess of Victory, who often escorts heroes to Olympus.\n    *   The fallen figure on the ground represents the mortal world of strife and death that the hero is leaving behind.\n    *   The main passenger, who is being carried upwards and away, is the hero undergoing deification. In Greek mythology, the most famous hero to receive this honor is Heracles (Hercules). This scene represents his final journey to Mount Olympus to join the gods after completing his labors and dying a mortal death.\n\nTherefore, the figure leaving the chariot is the hero Heracles.\n\n```python\ndef identify_figure():\n  \"\"\"\n  Identifies the mythological figure leaving the chariot in the provided image of a Greek vase.\n  \"\"\"\n  \n  # The scene depicted on the Apulian red-figure vase is the Apotheosis of Heracles.\n  # \"Apotheosis\" means the elevation of someone to divine status.\n  \n  # The figure driving the chariot is Nike, the winged goddess of Victory.\n  driver = \"Nike\"\n  \n  # The figure lying on the ground represents the mortal toils Heracles is leaving behind.\n  \n  # The figure ascending in the chariot, being escorted to Mount Olympus, is the hero Heracles.\n  passenger = \"Heracles\"\n  \n  print(f\"The scene shows the apotheosis (deification) of a hero.\")\n  print(f\"The winged figure driving the chariot is {driver}.\")\n  print(f\"The figure leaving the chariot to ascend to the heavens is the hero Heracles.\")\n\nidentify_figure()\n```\n<<<Heracles>>>"
