    Analyzes fictional flow cytometry data to determine which antibody stained all cells.
    
    In flow cytometry histograms:
    - The black curve represents the baseline fluorescence of unstained cells (negative control).
    - The red curve represents the fluorescence of cells after adding an antibody.
    - If an antibody stains ALL cells, the entire population shifts to a higher fluorescence.
      This means the red curve should appear as a single peak, shifted to the right of the
      black curve's position, with no cells remaining at the baseline fluorescence level.
