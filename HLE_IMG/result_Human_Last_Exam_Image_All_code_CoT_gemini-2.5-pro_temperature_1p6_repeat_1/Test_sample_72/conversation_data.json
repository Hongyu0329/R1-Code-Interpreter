    "This problem describes a two-step photochemical synthesis. To identify the pericyclic reactions involved, we can break down the transformation into logical steps based on the reactants and the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **First Reaction:** The first reactant is hexafluorobenzene. A common photochemical reaction for benzene and its derivatives is an electrocyclic reaction to form a \"Dewar benzene\" isomer. This is a [6π] electrocyclic ring closure. Under photochemical conditions (indicated by `hv`), the Woodward-Hoffmann rules predict that a 6π-electron electrocyclization proceeds in a disrotatory fashion, which is sterically feasible. This reaction converts hexafluorobenzene into its reactive isomer, hexafluoro-bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene (hexafluoro Dewar benzene).\n\n2.  **Second Reaction:** The intermediate, hexafluoro Dewar benzene, then reacts with the second reactant, cyclobutene. This reaction forms the final product by creating a new four-membered ring that fuses the two molecules. This is a cycloaddition reaction. Specifically, one π-bond (2 electrons) from the Dewar benzene reacts with the π-bond (2 electrons) from cyclobutene. This is therefore a [2+2] cycloaddition. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [2πs + 2πs] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed.\n\nTherefore, the two sequential pericyclic reactions are a [6π] electrocyclization followed by a [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\n```python\ndef identify_pericyclic_reactions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and describes the two pericyclic reactions in the given transformation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The first step is the photochemical electrocyclization of hexafluorobenzene.\n    reaction1 = {\n        \"name\": \"[6π] electrocyclization\",\n        \"electrons\": 6\n    }\n\n    # The second step is the photochemical cycloaddition of the intermediate\n    # with cyclobutene.\n    reaction2 = {\n        \"name\": \"[2+2] cycloaddition\",\n        \"electrons_A\": 2,\n        \"electrons_B\": 2\n    }\n\n    print(\"The transformation involves two sequential photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    \n    # Describe the first reaction\n    print(f\"1.
