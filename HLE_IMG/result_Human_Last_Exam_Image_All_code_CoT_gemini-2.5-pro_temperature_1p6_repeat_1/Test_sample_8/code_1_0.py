    # Step 1: Understand the 3D arrangement from Image 1 and the text.
    # The parasite has a fixed chirality. When looking at the cell from its
    # posterior (tail) end towards its anterior (front) end, the new flagellum
    # is always on the same side relative to the old one. By observing Image 1,
    # we can deduce this relative position. If you orient the cell with its
    # posterior towards you, the new flagellum is on the right.

    # Step 2: Understand the viewpoint of Images 2 and 3.
    # The problem states that the view for these transverse sections is
    # from the posterior to the anterior. This is the key link.
    viewing_perspective = "from posterior to anterior"

    # Step 3: Apply the 3D rule to the 2D cross-sections.
    # Since the viewpoint of the cross-sections matches our reference orientation,
    # the rule is simple: the flagellum on the right side of the image is the new one.
    new_flagellum_side = "right"
    old_flagellum_side = "left"

    # Step 4: Analyze each image.
    # Image 2 has two flagella, one on the left and one on the right.

    # Image 3 also has two flagella, one on the left and one on the right.

    # Step 5: Print the conclusion.
