    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step plan to determine the cutoff frequency, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation and display the result.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The task is to find the cutoff frequency ($\\omega_c$) at node $a_0$. For an RC circuit, the cutoff frequency is given by $\\omega_c = 1 / (R_{th} C)$, where $R_{th}$ is the Thévenin equivalent resistance seen from the terminals of the capacitor C (nodes $a_0$ and ground $b_0$).\n\n2.  **Calculate Thévenin Resistance ($R_{th}$):**\n    *   To find $R_{th}$, we need to calculate the equivalent resistance of the network connected to the capacitor. This is done by looking into terminal $a_0$ with all independent sources turned off.\n    *   We assume the input `IN` is a voltage source, so we set it to zero, which means node $c_0$ is connected to ground.\n    *   The problem then becomes finding the resistance of an infinite resistor ladder between node $a_0$ (let's call it $d_0$) and ground.\n\n3.  **Solve the Infinite Ladder Network:**\n    *   The infinite ladder can be analyzed by setting up recurrence relations for the voltages at each node ($v_{cn}$ and $v_{dn}$).\n    *   We can inject a test current of 1A into node $d_0$ and calculate the resulting voltage $v_{d0}$. The Thévenin resistance will then be $R_{th} = v_{d0} / 1\\text{A}$.\n    *   The node equations form a system of linear difference equations. We find a general solution for these equations that remains bounded as the node index $n$ goes to infinity.\n    *   The general solution consists of a common mode and a differential mode. The decaying solution (differential mode) propagates as $(2-\\sqrt{3})^n$. The bounded common mode is a constant offset.\n    *   We use the boundary conditions at the beginning of the ladder (at nodes $c_1$ and $d_1$, with $c_0$ grounded and current injected at $d_0$) to solve for the unknown coefficients in our general solution.\n\n4.  **Derive the Final Expression:**\n    *   Once we find the expression for $v_{d0}$ (which is $R_{th}$), we substitute it into the cutoff frequency formula $\\omega_c = 1 / (R_{th} C)$.\n    *   The final result will be an expression for $\\omega_c$ in terms of the given resistance $r$ and capacitance $C$.\n    *   I will use the `sympy` library in Python to carry out the symbolic algebra, ensuring an exact and simplified final expression.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan:\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_ladder_cutoff_frequency():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the cutoff frequency at node a0 in the given infinite ladder network\n    by finding the Thevenin equivalent resistance symbolically using sympy.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbolic variables for resistance, capacitance, and other helper variables\n    r, C = sympy.symbols('r C', positive=True, real=True)\n    A, B = sympy.symbols('A B') # Coefficients for the general solution\n\n    # The decaying mode eigenvalue for the recurrence relations is lambda = 2 - sqrt(3)\n    lambda_val = 2 - sympy.sqrt(3)\n\n    # Based on the analysis of the recurrence relations and boundary conditions,\n    # a system of equations for the coefficients A and B is derived.\n    # Equation 1 from KCL at node c1: A*(4 - lambda) + B = 0\n    # Equation 2 from KCL at node d1: A*(lambda - 4) + B = r\n    \n    eq1 = sympy.Eq(A * (4 - lambda_val) + B, 0)\n    eq2 = sympy.Eq(A * (lambda_val - 4) + B, r)\n    \n    # Solve this system for A and B\n    solution = sympy.solve([eq1, eq2], (A, B))\n    A_sol = solution[A]\n    B_sol = solution[B]\n\n    # The Thevenin resistance R_th is the voltage at node d0 (=a0) for a 1A test current.\n    # v_d0 = v_d1 + r, where v_d1 is the voltage at node d1.\n    # For n=1, the voltage v_d1 is given by -A + B from the general solution form.\n    v_d1 = -A_sol + B_sol\n    R_th = v_d1 + r\n    \n    # Simplify the resulting expression for R_th\n    R_th_simplified = sympy.simplify(R_th)\n\n    # The cutoff angular frequency is omega_c = 1 / (R_th * C)\n    omega_c = 1 / (R_th_simplified * C)\n    omega_c_simplified = sympy.simplify(omega_c)\n\n    # Deconstruct the final expression to print it clearly\n    num, den = sympy.fraction(omega_c_simplified)\n    # The denominator is proportional to r*C.
