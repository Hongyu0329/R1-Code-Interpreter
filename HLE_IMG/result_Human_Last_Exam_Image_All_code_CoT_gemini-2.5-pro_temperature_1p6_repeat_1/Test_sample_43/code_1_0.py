    1. The Grignard reagent (CH3MgBr), being a strong base, first deprotonates the primary alcohol of compound 1.
    2. The resulting magnesium alkoxide forms a stable six-membered chelate with the adjacent oxygen of the benzodioxole ring.
    3. This chelation activates the methylene (-CH2-) carbon of the benzodioxole for nucleophilic attack.
    4. The alkoxide oxygen, held in close proximity, acts as an intramolecular nucleophile and attacks this activated methylene carbon.
    5. This attack leads to the cleavage of the C-O bond on the other side of the methylene group, opening the 5-membered ring and forming a magnesium phenoxide.
    6. The overall process is a ring expansion, converting the 5-membered benzodioxole ring into a 7-membered dioxepine ring.
    7. After workup, the final product contains this new 7-membered ring and a phenol group. This corresponds exactly to the description in option C.
