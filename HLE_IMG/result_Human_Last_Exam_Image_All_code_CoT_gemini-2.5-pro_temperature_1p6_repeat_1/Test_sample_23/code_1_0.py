# 1. Define all the given variables from the problem in SI units.
rho = 997  # Density of water in kg/m^3
g = 9.81   # Acceleration due to gravity in m/s^2
Q = 2.86e-3 # Volume flow rate in m^3/s

# Pressures P1 and P2 are atmospheric and equal, so they cancel out.
P_ambient = 1.0e5 # N/m^2 (Assuming the typo 105 meant 1.0e5, value not needed as P1=P2)
P_manometer = 1.33e5 # N/m^2 (This data is considered secondary to friction parameters)

# Elevations relative to the pump level (z=0)
z1 = 2.0    # Height of water surface in the tank in m
z2 = -3.0   # Height of the exit in m

# Pipe and friction parameters from the table
r = 15.5 / 1000 # Pipe radius in m
L = 14.9        # Pipe length in m
L_D_bend = 31   # Equivalent L/D for the bend
f = 0.004       # Fanning friction factor
K_contraction = 0.4 # Loss coefficient for entrance (shrinkage)
K_expansion = 0.8   # Loss coefficient for exit (expansion)

# 2. Calculate intermediate values
D = 2 * r  # Pipe diameter in m
A = math.pi * r**2 # Pipe cross-sectional area in m^2
v2 = Q / A  # Fluid velocity at exit (and in the pipe) in m/s
v2_squared_over_2g = v2**2 / (2 * g) # Kinetic energy head in m

# 3. Calculate total head loss (h_L)
# Head loss from straight pipe friction
hL_pipe_factor = 4 * f * (L / D)
hL_pipe = hL_pipe_factor * v2_squared_over_2g

# Head loss from the bend, using equivalent L/D
hL_bend_factor = 4 * f * L_D_bend
hL_bend = hL_bend_factor * v2_squared_over_2g

# Head loss from fittings (entrance contraction and exit expansion)
hL_fittings_factor = K_contraction + K_expansion
hL_fittings = hL_fittings_factor * v2_squared_over_2g

# Total head loss
hL_total = hL_pipe + hL_bend + hL_fittings

# 4. Solve for the pump head (h_p) using the rearranged Bernoulli equation
# h_p = (z2 - z1) + (v2^2 / 2g) + h_L
delta_z = z2 - z1
h_p = delta_z + v2_squared_over_2g + hL_total

# 5. Calculate the work of the pump (Power) in Watts
Work_pump = rho * g * Q * h_p

# --- Output the results and the final equations ---
