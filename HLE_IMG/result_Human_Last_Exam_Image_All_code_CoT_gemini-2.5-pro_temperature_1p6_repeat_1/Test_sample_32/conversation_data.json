    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the explanation of the difference between the two species, presented in a Python script as requested.\n\nThe main difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* lies in the seta, the stalk that supports the spore capsule.\n\n```python\ndef explain_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    grimmia_montana_char = \"Grimmia montana: The sporophyte capsule is supported by a very short, straight seta. This causes the capsule to be 'immersed' or 'emergent,' meaning it is nestled among the upper leaves and does not rise significantly above them, as seen in the provided image.\"\n    \n    grimmia_curviseta_char = \"Grimmia curviseta: The sporophyte capsule is supported by a longer seta that is distinctly curved or cygneous (swan-necked), especially when moist. This 'exserts' the capsule, holding it well above the surrounding leaves on a noticeable arching stalk. The species name 'curviseta' literally means 'curved seta'.\"\n\n    main_difference_summary = \"At a glance, the key difference is the posture of the capsule: immersed on a straight stalk in Grimmia montana versus exserted on a distinctly curved stalk in Grimmia curviseta.\"\n\n    print(\"Key Sporophyte Differences:\\n\")\n    print(f\"1. {grimmia_montana_char}\\n\")\n    print(f\"2. {grimmia_curviseta_char}\\n\")\n    print(f\"Summary: {main_difference_summary}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    explain_difference()\n```\n<<<The primary visual difference is the seta (stalk). *Grimmia montana* has a short, straight seta, making the capsule appear immersed among the leaves.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
