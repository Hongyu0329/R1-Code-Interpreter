    "To calculate the total current flowing from the voltage source, we must first find the total equivalent resistance of the circuit.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Circuit:** We will carefully trace the connections of each component to understand how they are arranged (series, parallel, etc.).\n2.  **Identify Parallel Branches:** Based on the analysis, we'll see that the circuit simplifies into several parallel branches connected directly across the voltage source.\n3.  **Calculate Branch Currents:** We will use Ohm's Law (I = V/R) to calculate the current flowing through each of these parallel branches.\n4.  **Sum the Currents:** According to Kirchhoff's Current Law, the total current leaving the source is the sum of the currents in each parallel branch.\n5.  **Write the Code:** A Python script will be written to perform these calculations and display the process, including the final equation with all the values, and the final result.\n\n### Circuit Analysis:\nLet's define the top wire connected to the positive terminal of the voltage source as Node A, and the bottom ground wire as Node B.\n*   **Resistor R1 (3 Ω):** One end is connected to Node A. The other end is connected to a point that has a direct wire connection to Node B. Therefore, R1 is connected in parallel across the source (between A and B).\n*   **Resistor R3 (9 Ω):** One end is connected to Node B. The other end is connected to a point that has a direct wire connection to Node A. Therefore, R3 is also in parallel across the source.\n*   **Resistor R2 (7 Ω):** One end is connected to the same point as R1 and the wire to Node B. The other end is connected to the same point as R3 and the wire to Node A. Thus, R2 is also connected in parallel between Node A and Node B.\n*   **Resistors R7 (100 Ω) and R8 (100 Ω):** These two are connected in series with each other. This entire series branch is then connected between Node A and Node B.\n\nConclusion: The circuit consists of four parallel branches: R1, R2, R3, and the series combination of (R7 + R8). The total current is the sum of the currents through each of these four branches.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_circuit():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total current flowing through the provided circuit.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
