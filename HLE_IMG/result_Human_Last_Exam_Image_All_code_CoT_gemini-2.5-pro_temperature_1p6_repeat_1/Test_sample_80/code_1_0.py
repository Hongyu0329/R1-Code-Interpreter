    This script provides a step-by-step analysis to determine the product
    of the double intramolecular Schmidt reaction shown.
    """
    # Step 1: Analyze the asymmetry of the reaction.
    # The starting material has two different side chains: a 3-azidopropyl group
    # and a 4-azidobutyl group. This makes the molecule asymmetric.
    # The product of the reaction must therefore also be asymmetric.
    print("The starting material is asymmetric.")

    # Step 2: Eliminate symmetric product options.
    # Options A, B, D, and E all have a C2 axis of symmetry.
    print("Eliminating symmetric options: A, B, D, E.")
    eliminated_options = ['A', 'B', 'D', 'E']
    remaining_options = ['C', 'F']
    print(f"Remaining options are: {remaining_options}")

    # Step 3: Analyze the predicted reaction pathway.
    # A double intramolecular Schmidt reaction occurs. The standard mechanism
    # predicts the formation of a 7-membered and an 8-membered lactam ring.
    # This intermediate is not an option. It undergoes a further transannular
    # lactamization, creating a complex, polycyclic cage structure.
    print("The reaction is a tandem Schmidt/transannular lactamization cascade.")

    # Step 4: Evaluate the remaining options.
    # Option C shows incorrect lactam ring sizes (5- and 6-membered).
    # Option F is a complex, asymmetric, polycyclic diamide, which is the
    # known product from this type of cascade reaction.
    final_product = 'F'
    print("Option C is inconsistent with the mechanism.")
    print(f"Option F represents the correct complex cage structure formed.")
    print(f"\nTherefore, the expected product is F.")
