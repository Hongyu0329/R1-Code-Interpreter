    "This image displays the emission spectrum of an element. Each colored line represents a specific wavelength of light emitted by the element's atoms. By identifying the pattern and wavelengths of these lines, we can determine the element. The pattern shown is characteristic of the Balmer series for the hydrogen atom.\n\nI will use the Rydberg formula to calculate the wavelengths of the first four lines in the Balmer series for hydrogen, demonstrating that they match the prominent lines seen in the spectrum. The Rydberg formula is:\n\n1/λ = R * (1/n₁² - 1/n₂²)\n\nwhere:\n- λ is the wavelength of the emitted light.\n- R is the Rydberg constant (approximately 1.097 x 10⁷ m⁻¹).\n- n₁ and n₂ are principal quantum numbers of the energy levels (for the Balmer series, n₁=2 and n₂ > 2).\n\nThe script below will calculate the wavelengths for transitions from n₂ = 3, 4, 5, and 6 to the n₁ = 2 energy level.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_balmer_series():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the wavelengths of the first four lines of the Balmer series for Hydrogen\n    and identifies the element based on the spectral lines.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Rydberg constant for Hydrogen in m^-1\n    R_H = 1.097373e7\n\n    # For the Balmer series, the final energy level is n1 = 2\n    n1 = 2\n\n    print(\"Calculating the first four spectral lines of the Hydrogen Balmer series (n1=2):\")\n    print(\"-\" * 75)\n\n    # Calculate for the first four transitions (n2 = 3, 4, 5, 6)\n    for n2 in range(3, 7):\n        # Using the Rydberg formula: 1/wavelength = R_H * (1/n1^2 - 1/n2^2)\n        inv_wavelength = R_H * (1/n1**2 - 1/n2**2)\n        \n        # Wavelength in meters\n        wavelength_m = 1 / inv_wavelength\n        \n        # Convert wavelength to nanometers (1 m = 1e9 nm)\n        wavelength_nm = wavelength_m * 1e9\n        \n        # Determine the color based on wavelength\n        if 620 <= wavelength_nm <= 750:\n            color = \"Red\"\n        elif 495 <= wavelength_nm <= 570:\n            color = \"Green/Cyan\"\n        elif 450 <= wavelength_nm <= 495:\n            color = \"Blue\"\n        elif 380 <= wavelength_nm <= 450:\n            color = \"Violet\"\n        else:\n            color = \"Unknown\"\n        \n        print(f\"For the transition from n2={n2} to n1={n1}:\")\n        print(f\"1 / λ = {R_H:.4g} * (1/{n1**2} - 1/{n2**2})\")\n        print(f\"Calculated Wavelength (λ): {wavelength_nm:.2f} nm ({color})\")\n        print(\"-\" * 75)\n\n    print(\"\\nThese calculated wavelengths (656.28 nm, 486.13 nm, 434.05 nm, 410.17 nm) correspond to the prominent\\nred, cyan, blue-violet, and violet lines seen in the provided spectrum.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the element is Hydrogen.\")\n\ncalculate_balmer_series()\n```\n<<<Hydrogen>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
