    # Analysis of each statement based on the provided plot.
    # statement_1_correct: "Both methanol and ethanol have approximately the same structuring effect..."
    # This is debatable. Methanol's peaks are clearly higher, implying more structure.
    # However, if interpreted broadly (both have 2 shells), it could be seen as true. Let's call it 'weakly true'.
    # statement_2_correct: "Ethanol creates a more structured local aqueous environment..." -> False. Peaks are lower.
    # statement_3_correct: "Methanol creates a more structured local aqueous environment..." -> True. Peaks are higher.
    # statement_4_correct: "Both alcohols induce a similar orientation of water..." -> True. Relative peak positions of OA-OW and OA-HW are very similar.
    # statement_5_correct: "Ethanol creates 3 obvious hydration shells..." -> False. Only 2 are obvious.
    # statement_6_correct: "Methanol creates 3 obvious hydration shells..." -> False. Only 2 are obvious.

    # Summary of correct statements: 3 and 4.
    # Let's check the answer choices.
    # A. 2 -> Incorrect.
    # B. 3 -> Correct statement, but is it the best choice?
    # C. 1, 6 -> 1 is weak, 6 is false. Incorrect.
    # D. 1, 4 -> 1 is weak, 4 is true. Plausible if the intended narrative is "similarity".
    # E. 4, 6 -> 4 is true, 6 is false. Incorrect.
    # F. 2, 5 -> Both false. Incorrect.
    # G. 4 -> Correct statement, but is it the best choice?

    # Dilemma: No option for {3, 4}. Statements 1 and 3 are contradictory.
    # Assuming there's a unique best answer and paired answers are preferred.
    # The only plausible paired answer is D = {1, 4}, as E contains a definitively false statement (6).
    # This implies that statement 1 should be considered true in the context of the question.
    # Rationale for D: It presents a coherent narrative that both alcohols have a similar effect on water.
    # Statement 1 notes the similarity in the overall structuring (e.g., number of shells).
    # Statement 4 notes the similarity in the orientation of H-bonding.

    print("Statement 3 is correct: Methanol (purple curve) shows higher RDF peaks than ethanol (green curve), indicating a more structured local water environment.")
    print("Statement 4 is also correct: The positions of the first OA-OW peak (at ~2.7 Å) and the first OA-HW peak (at ~1.8 Å) are nearly identical for both alcohols. This signifies a similar hydrogen-bonding orientation.")
    print("Statements 1, 2, 5, and 6 are incorrect.")
    print("Since there is no answer choice containing both 3 and 4, the question is ambiguous.")

    print("Statement 1 ('approximately the same structuring effect') is qualitatively questionable due to different peak heights, but may be considered correct in a broader sense (e.g., both form two solvation shells).")
    print("Choice E combines statement 4 with statement 6, which is clearly false (there are not 3 obvious shells).")
