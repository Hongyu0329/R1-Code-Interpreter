    This function solves the riddle by identifying the components based on the provided clues.
    
    1. The riddle connects a Carl Sagan quote about human unity to a crater's name.
    2. The most famous literary expression of this unity is Sa'di's poem starting with "Bani Adam" ("Sons of Adam").
    3. This gives us the "X of Y" phrase: "Sons of Adam".
    4. The image shows the Sa'di crater on Mercury.
    5. The question asks for 'Y'.
    
    In the phrase "Sons of Adam", Y is "Adam".
    """
    Y = "Adam"
    print(Y)
