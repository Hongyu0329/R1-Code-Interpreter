    explanation = """The thermal transformation shown occurs via a sequence of two pericyclic reactions:

1.  The first step is a thermal **electrocyclic ring-opening** of the four-membered cyclobutene ring. This reaction involves 4 electrons (the 2 pi electrons of the double bond and the 2 sigma electrons of the breaking single bond). According to Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a thermal 4-electron electrocyclic reaction proceeds via a **conrotatory** motion. This step converts the initial bicyclic reactant into a monocyclic cyclodecapentaene intermediate.

2.  The second step is a thermal **electrocyclic ring-closure** of the resulting cyclodecapentaene intermediate. A 1,3,5-hexatriene portion of this intermediate undergoes cyclization. This is a 6-electron process. According to the rules, a thermal 6-electron electrocyclic reaction proceeds via a **disrotatory** motion. This specific stereochemical pathway leads to the formation of the final product, cis-9,10-dihydronaphthalene.
