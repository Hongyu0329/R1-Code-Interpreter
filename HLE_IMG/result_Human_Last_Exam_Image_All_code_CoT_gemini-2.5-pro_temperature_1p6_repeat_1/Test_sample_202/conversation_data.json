    "I will identify the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n\n*   **Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and highly vesicular, meaning it is full of small holes created by gas bubbles escaping from lava. This is characteristic of **Scoria**.\n*   **Specimen I:** This rock is composed of consolidated volcanic ash and small rock fragments (clasts) cemented together in a lighter-colored matrix. This texture identifies it as a pyroclastic rock, specifically **Tuff**.\n*   **Specimen J:** This is a light-colored, almost white, vesicular volcanic rock. Its frothy, lightweight appearance is a classic feature of **Pumice**.\n*   **Specimen K:** This rock displays large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible. The light colors (white, grey, and pinkish) indicate it is felsic in composition. A coarse-grained, intrusive, felsic rock is **Granite**.\n\nI will now generate a Python code to display these identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Tuff',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Granite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for label, rock_type in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {label}: {rock_type}\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Tuff, J: Pumice, K: Granite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
