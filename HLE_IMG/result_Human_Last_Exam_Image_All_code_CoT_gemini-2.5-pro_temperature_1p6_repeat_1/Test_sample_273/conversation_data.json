    "Here is my plan to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Molecule:** I will first identify the main carbon backbone and the substituents attached to it based on the provided 2D wedge-dash chemical drawing. I will assign numbers to the carbons in the main chain according to IUPAC nomenclature rules, where the principal functional group (-OH) gets the lowest possible number.\n2.  **Identify Chiral Centers:** I will locate all stereocenters (chiral carbons) in the molecule. A chiral carbon is one that is attached to four different groups.\n3.  **Assign Priorities:** For each chiral center, I will assign priorities (1, 2, 3, 4) to the four attached groups based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules. Priority is determined by the atomic number of the atom directly bonded to the chiral center. If there's a tie, I'll proceed along the substituent chains until the first point of difference.\n4.  **Determine R/S Configuration:**\n    *   I will orient the molecule in space so that the lowest priority group (4) is pointing away from the viewer (represented by a dashed bond).\n    *   I will then trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3.\n    *   If the path is clockwise, the configuration is 'R' (from the Latin *rectus*, for right).\n    *   If the path is counter-clockwise, the configuration is 'S' (from the Latin *sinister*, for left).\n    *   If the lowest priority group is pointing towards the viewer (a wedged bond), I will trace the path 1 -> 2 -> 3 and then reverse the result (Clockwise -> S, Counter-clockwise -> R).\n5.  **Final Assembly:** I will combine the configurations for all chiral centers with the IUPAC name to give the complete stereochemical description of the molecule. The Python script below will print out this step-by-step analysis.\n\n```python\ndef determine_configuration():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the absolute configuration (R/S) for the chiral centers\n    of the given molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: IUPAC Name and Chiral Center Identification\")\n    # Based on IUPAC rules, the principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH).\n    # The longest carbon chain containing the C-OH carbon is a 5-carbon pentane chain.\n    # Numbering from left to right gives the -OH group the lowest number (2).\n    # The substituents are an ethyl group at C3 and an aminomethyl group at C4.\n    # The image corresponds to a stereoisomer of 4-(aminomethyl)-3-ethylpentan-2-ol.\n    # Let's refer to the carbons by their number in this chain.\n    iupac_name = \"4-(aminomethyl)-3-ethylpentan-2-ol\"\n    chiral_centers = [\"C2\", \"C3\", \"C4\"]\n    print(f\"The molecule is identified as an isomer of: {iupac_name}\")\n    print(f\"The chiral centers are at positions: {', '.join(chiral_centers)}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Analysis for C2 ---\n    print(\"--- Analysis for Chiral Center C2 ---\")\n    print(\"Substituents on C2: -OH, -CH3 (C1), -C3_group, -H\")\n    print(\"Priority Assignment (CIP Rules):\")\n    print(\"1: -OH (highest atomic number O vs C)\")\n    print(\"2: -C3_group (-CH(Et)-...)\")\n    print(\"3: -CH3 (C1)\")\n    print(\"4: -H (lowest atomic number)\")\n    print(\"Spatial Orientation: The lowest priority group (-H) is pointing forwards (wedged).\")\n    print(\"Path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3 is counter-clockwise.\")\n    print(\"Result: Counter-clockwise with H in front gives R configuration.\")\n    c2_config = \"2R\"\n    print(f\"Configuration at C2 is: {c2_config}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Analysis for C3 ---\n    print(\"--- Analysis for Chiral Center C3 ---\")\n    print(\"Substituents on C3: -C2_group, -C4_group, -Ethyl, -H\")\n    print(\"Priority Assignment (CIP Rules):\")\n    print(\"1: -C2_group (-CH(OH)-... contains O)\")\n    print(\"2: -C4_group (-CH(CH2NH2)-...)\")\n    print(\"3: -Ethyl (-CH2CH3)\")\n    print(\"4: -H\")\n    print(\"Spatial Orientation: The lowest priority group (-H) is pointing backwards (dashed).\")\n    print(\"Path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3 is clockwise.\")\n    print(\"Result: Clockwise with H in back gives R configuration.\")\n    c3_config = \"3R\"\n    print(f\"Configuration at C3 is: {c3_config}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Analysis for C4 ---\n    print(\"--- Analysis for Chiral Center C4 ---\")\n    print(\"Substituents on C4: -CH2NH2, -C3_group, -CH3, -H\")\n    print(\"Priority Assignment (CIP Rules):\")\n    print(\"1: -CH2NH2 (C is bonded to N)\")\n    print(\"2: -C3_group (C is bonded to C,C,H)\")\n    print(\"3: -CH3 (C is bonded to H,H,H)\")\n    print(\"4: -H\")\n    print(\"Spatial Orientation: The lowest priority group (-H) is pointing forwards (wedged).\")\n    print(\"Path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3 is clockwise.\")\n    print(\"Result: Clockwise with H in front gives S configuration.\")\n    c4_config = \"4S\"\n    print(f\"Configuration at C4 is: {c4_config}\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Final Conclusion ---\n    print(\"--- Final Configuration ---\")\n    final_config = f\"({c2_config}, {c3_config}, {c4_config})\"\n    print(f\"The absolute configuration of the molecule is {final_config}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    determine_configuration()\n```\n<<<(2R, 3R, 4S)>>>"
