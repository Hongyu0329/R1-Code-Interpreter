    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Objective:**\nCalculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) when switching from the Baseline (Table 1) to the Proposed (Table 2) mode share composition.\n\n**Formula for Percentage Reduction:**\nPercentage Reduction = [(Baseline Car VMT - Proposed Car VMT) / Baseline Car VMT] * 100%\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **VMT vs. PMT:** The question asks for Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), not Person Miles Traveled (PMT). VMT is concerned with the miles traveled by the vehicle itself. Therefore, both 'car, 1 occupant' and 'car, with more than 2 occupants' trips count as single vehicle trips. The 'Average Carpool Occupancy' figures (2.8 and 3) are not needed for this calculation and should be ignored.\n2.  **Weighted Calculation:** The overall VMT is a weighted sum across all distance categories. The total number of trips is not given, but we can calculate a relative VMT value by assuming a total of 100 trips. The final percentage will be the same regardless of the total number of trips assumed.\n3.  **Calculation Structure:** To get the total Car VMT for a scenario, we must calculate the VMT for each distance segment and then sum them.\n    *   VMT for a segment = (Share of total trips in segment) × (Mode share of cars in segment) × (Average trip distance of segment).\n\n---\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can compute a \"relative VMT contribution\" for each segment. Let's represent this relative VMT for a total of 100 trips.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Total Car VMT for the Baseline Scenario**\n\nWe'll calculate the VMT for each distance category and sum them. The formula for each segment's VMT contribution is: `(% Share of Total Trips) * (Average Trip Distance) * (Combined Car Mode Share)`.\n\n*   **0-3 miles segment:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 48% (or 0.48)\n    *   Average trip distance: 1 mile\n    *   Combined Car Mode Share: 25% (1 occupant) + 28% (>2 occupants) = 53% (or 0.53)\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.48 * 1 * 0.53 = **0.2544**\n\n*   **3-5 miles segment:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 22% (or 0.22)\n    *   Average trip distance: 4 miles\n    *   Combined Car Mode Share: 38% + 43% = 81% (or 0.81)\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.22 * 4 * 0.81 = **0.7128**\n\n*   **5-10 miles segment:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 14% (or 0.14)\n    *   Average trip distance: 7.5 miles\n    *   Combined Car Mode Share: 40% + 45% = 85% (or 0.85)\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.14 * 7.5 * 0.85 = **0.8925**\n\n*   **10+ miles segment:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 16% (or 0.16)\n    *   Average trip distance: 20 miles\n    *   Combined Car Mode Share: 42% + 47% = 89% (or 0.89)\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.16 * 20 * 0.89 = **2.8480**\n\n*   **Total Baseline Car VMT (Relative):**\n    *   0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Car VMT for the Proposed Scenario**\n\nWe use the same method but with the mode share values from Table 2.\n\n*   **0-3 miles segment:**\n    *   Combined Car Mode Share: 1% + 2% = 3% (or 0.03)\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.48 * 1 * 0.03 = **0.0144**\n\n*   **3-5 miles segment:**\n    *   Combined Car Mode Share: 8% + 19% = 27% (or 0.27)\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.22 * 4 * 0.27 = **0.2376**\n\n*   **5-10 miles segment:**\n    *   Combined Car Mode Share: 14% + 27% = 41% (or 0.41)\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.14 * 7.5 * 0.41 = **0.4305**\n\n*   **10+ miles segment:**\n    *   Combined Car Mode Share: 16% + 33% = 49% (or 0.49)\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.16 * 20 * 0.49 = **1.5680**\n\n*   **Total Proposed Car VMT (Relative):**\n    *   0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\n*   **VMT Reduction** = Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = **2.4572**\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT) * 100\n*   Percentage Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100 = 0.52195... * 100\n*   Percentage Reduction ≈ **52.2%**\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
