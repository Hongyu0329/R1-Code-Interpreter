    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the artwork's subject and style:** The image shows a bas-relief sculpture in a circular format, known as a *tondo*. The scene depicted is a Christian sacrament, specifically the Eucharist or First Communion, where a priest is administering the communion wafer to kneeling figures. The style of the figures, with their graceful poses and flowing drapery, is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance.\n\n2.  **Examine the inscription:** At the bottom of the circular relief, there is a cartouche with a partially visible inscription. The words \"SACRAMENTI\" and what appears to be \"DE L'AVTEL\" or \"DELL'ALTARE\" can be discerned. This likely reads \"Sacramento dell'Altare\" (Italian) or \"Sacrament de l'autel\" (French), meaning \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" which is another name for the Eucharist. This confirms the subject matter.\n\n3.  **Identify the medium and artistic family:** The work appears to be made of glazed terracotta, a technique perfected and popularized by the Della Robbia family, a renowned Florentine dynasty of sculptors during the Renaissance. The combination of the subject matter, the tondo format, the white and blue glazing (implied by the monochrome image but typical of their work), and the Renaissance style strongly points to the Della Robbia workshop.\n\n4.  **Identify the specific artwork and artist:** Based on the style, medium, and subject, this relief can be identified as a detail from a larger work. It is the *Eucharist* tondo from the **Altarpiece of the Sacraments** located in the Salutati Chapel in the Cathedral of Fiesole, Italy. Art historical sources attribute this masterpiece to **Andrea della Robbia** (1435â€“1525), the nephew of Luca della Robbia who inherited the family workshop. The altarpiece was created around 1490.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The author of this detail of the altarpiece is the Italian Renaissance sculptor Andrea della Robbia.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   The black and white nature of the photograph requires recognizing the style and form rather than relying on color, which is a key feature of Della Robbia ware (typically blue and white).\n*   The inscription is partially obscured but provides a crucial clue (\"Sacrament of the Altar\") to identify the specific scene within a series.\n*   It's important to distinguish between members of the Della Robbia family (Luca, Andrea, Giovanni, etc.), as their styles have subtle differences. In this case, the work is a well-documented piece by Andrea della Robbia.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
