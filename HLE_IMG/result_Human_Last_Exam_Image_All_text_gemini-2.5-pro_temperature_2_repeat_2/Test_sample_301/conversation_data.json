    "This is an analysis to identify the author of each of the nine works of art, ordered from left to right, top to bottom.\n\n**First row:**\n\n1.  **Top Left:** This painting shows four fish with whimsical, almost human-like expressions. This playful and modern interpretation of a traditional subject is the signature style of **Han Meilin (韩美林)**, a famous contemporary Chinese artist known for his depictions of animals.\n2.  **Top Middle:** This is a Chinese ink wash painting of chrysanthemums and a rock. The vigorous, calligraphic brushstrokes used for the rock and flowers, combined with the inscription and seal, are characteristic of **Wu Changshuo (吴昌硕)**, a prominent master of the late Qing Dynasty.\n3.  **Top Right:** This is a realistic oil portrait of a Tajik woman. This specific work, titled \"Tajik Bride\" (塔吉克新娘), is one of the most iconic masterpieces of **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**, a leading figure in Chinese Neoclassicism and realist oil painting.\n\n**Second row:**\n\n4.  **Middle Left:** This is a work of Chinese calligraphy in a dynamic, semi-cursive script. The characters are powerful and fluid. Based on the style, which is strong and has a distinct structure within its flow, it is identifiable as the work of **Li Yong (李邕)**, a renowned calligrapher of the Tang Dynasty. This particular piece appears to be a rubbing or copy of his famous \"Yuelu Temple Stele\" (岳麓寺碑).\n5.  **Middle Center:** This is an abstract painting that combines geometric forms (the two sun-like circles) with elements of traditional Chinese landscape painting. This fusion of Eastern and Western aesthetics, transforming concrete scenery into abstract forms, is the hallmark of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**, one of the most important Chinese painters of the 20th century.\n6.  **Middle Right:** This is another example of Chinese calligraphy, this time in a very elegant, slender, and carefully balanced Regular Script (楷书). This style is strongly associated with **Chu Suiliang (褚遂良)**, one of the Four Great Calligraphers of the Early Tang Dynasty. The text appears to be a colophon discussing famous steles.\n\n**Third row:**\n\n7.  **Bottom Left:** This calligraphy is in a \"wild\" Cursive Script (狂草), characterized by its highly energetic, fluid, and linked strokes, where individual characters are often difficult to discern. This expressive and untamed style is the signature of the Tang Dynasty monk and calligrapher **Huaisu (怀素)**, particularly reminiscent of his famous \"Autobiography\" scroll.\n8.  **Bottom Middle:** This is a highly realistic oil portrait of a pensive-looking young woman. The romantic, melancholic atmosphere and the meticulous, classical realist technique are trademarks of the modern artist **Chen Yifei (陈逸飞)**.\n9.  **Bottom Right:** This is a line-and-wash painting of a woman in an ornate, likely Central Asian or Indian-inspired costume and headdress. The fine, decorative lines, the elongated and graceful figures, and the influence from the art of the Dunhuang murals are distinctive features of the contemporary female artist **Wang Meifang (王美芳)**.\n\n<<<Han Meilin, Wu Changshuo, Jin Shangyi, Li Yong, Wu Guanzhong, Chu Suiliang, Huaisu, Chen Yifei, Wang Meifang>>>"
