    "### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$. A cutoff frequency is characteristic of a filter circuit. The circuit consists of an infinite resistive ladder network connected to a capacitor C. This configuration forms a low-pass filter.\n\n2.  **Model the Circuit:** The capacitor C connected to node $a_0$ sees the rest of the network as a Thévenin equivalent circuit. This equivalent circuit consists of a Thévenin voltage source $V_{th}$ in series with a Thévenin resistance $R_{th}$. The voltage across the capacitor is the output voltage, $V_{out} = V_{a0}$. The overall transfer function for this simple RC filter section is:\n    $H(s) = \\frac{V_{a0}(s)}{V_{th}(s)} = \\frac{Z_C}{R_{th} + Z_C} = \\frac{1/(sC)}{R_{th} + 1/(sC)} = \\frac{1}{1 + sCR_{th}}$\n    where $s = j\\omega$ is the complex frequency.\n\n3.  **Define Cutoff Frequency:** The cutoff frequency is the frequency at which the magnitude of the transfer function drops to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its maximum value. For this first-order low-pass filter, the maximum gain is at DC ($\\omega=0$) and is equal to 1 (in relation to $V_{th}$). The cutoff angular frequency $\\omega_c$ is found when the magnitude of the denominator is $\\sqrt{2}$:\n    $|1 + j\\omega_c C R_{th}| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (\\omega_c C R_{th})^2} = \\sqrt{2}$\n    This leads to the well-known result:\n    $\\omega_c C R_{th} = 1 \\implies \\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\n    The problem thus reduces to finding the Thévenin resistance $R_{th}$ seen by the capacitor at node $a_0$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Thévenin Resistance ($R_{th}$):** To find $R_{th}$ at node $a_0$, we need to find the equivalent resistance looking into node $a_0$ with all independent sources turned off. The input source \"IN\" is connected at node $g_0$. Assuming it is a voltage source, we turn it off by grounding node $g_0$. The resistance is measured between $a_0$ and ground ($b_0$). So we are looking for the resistance between $a_0$ and ground with $g_0$ also grounded.\n\n5.  **Solving the Infinite Ladder:** The network is an infinite symmetric ladder. A powerful method for solving such symmetric circuits is the superposition of common-mode and differential-mode excitations.\n    Let's apply a test voltage $V_{test}$ at node $a_0$ and calculate the injected current $I_{test}$. Then $R_{th} = V_{test}/I_{test}$. The boundary conditions are $V_{a0} = V_{test}$ and $V_{g0} = 0$.\n    We decompose this excitation into two simpler, symmetric cases:\n    a) **Common Mode (CM):** $V'_{a0} = V'_{g0} = V_{test}/2$.\n    b) **Differential Mode (DM):** $V''_{a0} = V_{test}/2$, $V''_{g0} = -V_{test}/2$.\n    The original excitation is the sum of these two cases: $V_{a0} = V'_{a0} + V''_{a0} = V_{test}$ and $V_{g0} = V'_{g0} + V''_{g0} = 0$. The total current will be $I_{test} = I'_{a0} + I''_{a0}$.\n\n6.  **Common-Mode Analysis:** Due to the symmetric excitation ($V'_{a0} = V'_{g0}$) and symmetric network structure, the voltage on the top rail ($d_n$) will be equal to the voltage on the bottom rail ($c_n$) at every stage: $V'_{dn} = V'_{cn}$. Consequently, no current flows through the horizontal \"rung\" resistors connecting the two rails. The circuit effectively becomes two independent semi-infinite chains of resistors. The KCL at node $d_n$ simplifies to $2V'_{dn} - V'_{d,n-1} - V'_{d,n+1}=0$. The only bounded solution for an infinite ladder that starts with $V'_{d0} = V_{test}/2$ is a constant voltage: $V'_{dn} = V_{test}/2$ for all $n \\ge 0$.\n    The current flowing from the source at $a_0$ is $I'_{a0} = (V'_{a0} - V'_{d1}) / r = (V_{test}/2 - V_{test}/2) / r = 0$.\n\n7.  **Differential-Mode Analysis:** Due to the anti-symmetric excitation ($V''_{a0} = -V''_{g0}$), the voltages on the two rails will be opposite at every stage: $V''_{dn} = -V''_{cn}$. We can write the KCL equation at a node, say $d_n$, and substitute this condition.\n    The general KCL at $d_n$ is $V''_{d,n-1} + V''_{cn} + V''_{d,n+1} - 3V''_{dn} = 0$.\n    Substituting $V''_{cn} = -V''_{dn}$:\n    $V''_{d,n-1} - V''_{dn} + V''_{d,n+1} - 3V''_{dn} = 0 \\implies V''_{d,n+1} - 4V''_{dn} + V''_{d,n-1} = 0$.\n    This is a linear second-order difference equation. Its characteristic equation is $\\lambda^2 - 4\\lambda + 1 = 0$, with roots $\\lambda = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}$.\n    For the voltage to decay to zero at infinity, we must choose the root with magnitude less than 1, which is $\\lambda = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$.\n    The solution is of the form $V''_{dn} = A \\lambda^n$. Using the boundary condition at $n=0$, $V''_{d0} = V''_{a0} = V_{test}/2$, we find $A=V_{test}/2$.\n    So, $V''_{dn} = (V_{test}/2)(2-\\sqrt{3})^n$.\n    The current from the source at $a_0$ in this mode is:\n    $I''_{a0} = (V''_{a0} - V''_{d1}) / r = (V''_{d0} - V''_{d0}\\lambda)/r = \\frac{V''_{d0}}{r}(1-\\lambda)$.\n    $I''_{a0} = \\frac{V_{test}/2}{r}(1 - (2-\\sqrt{3})) = \\frac{V_{test}}{2r}(\\sqrt{3}-1)$.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation of $R_{th}$ and $\\omega_c$**:\n    The total current is $I_{test} = I'_{a0} + I''_{a0} = 0 + \\frac{V_{test}}{2r}(\\sqrt{3}-1) = \\frac{V_{test}}{2r}(\\sqrt{3}-1)$.\n    The Thévenin resistance is $R_{th} = \\frac{V_{test}}{I_{test}} = \\frac{V_{test}}{\\frac{V_{test}}{2r}(\\sqrt{3}-1)} = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3}-1}$.\n    To simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by $(\\sqrt{3}+1)$:\n    $R_{th} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{(\\sqrt{3}-1)(\\sqrt{3}+1)} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{3-1} = r(\\sqrt{3}+1)$.\n    Finally, substitute this into the expression for the cutoff angular frequency:\n    $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(\\sqrt{3}+1)C}$.\n\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency, which can refer to angular frequency $\\omega_c$ (in rad/s) or cyclical frequency $f_c$ (in Hz), where $\\omega_c = 2\\pi f_c$. In the context of expressions, typically the formula for $\\omega_c$ is provided unless specified otherwise.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{(1+\\sqrt{3})rC}}$.\n\n<<<1/((1+sqrt(3))*r*C)>>>"
