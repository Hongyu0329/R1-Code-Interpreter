    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material**\n    *   The starting material is a complex bicyclic molecule. Let's identify its key features to determine its molecular formula.\n    *   The core structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octene system. This means it has a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane framework where one carbon has been replaced by a nitrogen atom. Let's assign numbers to the atoms of the bicyclic core. The bridgehead carbons are C1 and C4. There are three bridges connecting them. One bridge contains the nitrogen at position 2 and a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 3. Another bridge has a double bond between C5 and C6. The last bridge is a saturated C7-C8 linkage.\n    *   Substituents:\n        *   A trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) is attached to the double bond, let's say at position C5.\n        *   A para-methoxybenzyl group (PMB) is attached to the nitrogen atom. The PMB group has the formula -CH2-C6H4-OCH3.\n    *   Based on this structure (N-(p-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-5-en-3-one), we can calculate the molecular formula of the starting material.\n        *   **Carbons (C):** 7 in the bicyclic core (C1, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8), 1 in the CF3 group, and 8 in the PMB group (1 in -CH2-, 6 in the benzene ring, 1 in -OCH3). Total C = 7 + 1 + 8 = 16.\n        *   **Hydrogens (H):** 7 on the bicyclic core (1H on C1, 1H on C4, 1H on C6, 2H on C7, 2H on C8). 9 on the PMB group (2H in -CH2-, 4H on the benzene ring, 3H in -OCH3). Total H = 7 + 9 = 16.\n        *   **Fluorines (F):** 3 in the -CF3 group.\n        *   **Nitrogens (N):** 1 in the bicyclic core.\n        *   **Oxygens (O):** 1 in the carbonyl group (C=O) and 1 in the methoxy group (-OCH3) of the PMB. Total O = 2.\n    *   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C16H16F3NO2**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1: Formation of Intermediate 1**\n    *   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n    *   **Transformation:** CAN is a standard reagent used for the oxidative cleavage of para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting groups from nitrogen atoms. The N-PMB bond is broken, and the nitrogen becomes N-H. The PMB group is converted to p-methoxybenzaldehyde.\n    *   **Change in Molecular Formula:** We remove the PMB group (C8H9O) and add one hydrogen atom to the nitrogen.\n        *   Starting Material: C16H16F3NO2\n        *   Subtract PMB: -C8H9O  ->  Result: C8H7F3NO\n        *   Add H: +H  ->  Result: C8H8F3NO\n    *   The molecular formula of **Intermediate 1** is **C8H8F3NO**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 2: Formation of Intermediate 2**\n    *   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 in MeOH (Methanol).\n    *   **Transformation:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The palladium-on-carbon catalyst with hydrogen gas will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond (C5=C6) to a single bond (C5-C6). Two hydrogen atoms are added across the double bond. Other functional groups like the lactam (amide) and the CF3 group are stable under these mild conditions.\n    *   **Change in Molecular Formula:** We add one molecule of hydrogen (H2) to Intermediate 1.\n        *   Intermediate 1: C8H8F3NO\n        *   Add H2: +H2  ->  Result: C8H10F3NO\n    *   The molecular formula of **Intermediate 2** is **C8H10F3NO**.\n\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 3: Formation of the Final Product**\n    *   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n    *   **Transformation:** These conditions (strong acid and heat) cause the hydrolysis of the lactam (a cyclic amide). The amide bond (N2-C3) is cleaved by the addition of a water molecule (H2O). The carbonyl carbon (C3) becomes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and the nitrogen atom (N2) becomes an amino group (-NH2). This process opens the ring containing the lactam.\n    *   The bicyclic structure of Intermediate 2 is cleaved, resulting in a substituted cyclohexane ring. The final product is 4-amino-2-(trifluoromethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid. (Although the product exists as its ammonium salt in the HCl solution, the molecular formula usually refers to the neutral molecule).\n    *   **Change in Molecular Formula:** We add one molecule of water (H2O) to Intermediate 2.\n        *   Intermediate 2: C8H10F3NO\n        *   Add H2O: +H2O  ->  Result: C8H12F3NO2\n    *   Let's confirm by counting atoms in the product structure (4-amino-2-(trifluoromethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid):\n        *   **C:** 6 in the cyclohexane ring + 1 in -COOH + 1 in -CF3 = 8.\n        *   **H:** 9 on the cyclohexane ring + 1 in -COOH + 2 in -NH2 = 12.\n        *   **F:** 3 in -CF3.\n        *   **N:** 1 in -NH2.\n        *   **O:** 2 in -COOH.\n    *   The counting matches the calculation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe molecular formula of the final product is **C8H12F3NO2**.\n\n<<<C8H12F3NO2>>>"
