    "An explicit step-by-step analysis is as follows:\n### Step 1: Understand the Algorithm's Logic\nThe provided code defines a recursive function `sort(a, n)` that aims to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`. Let's break down its operation for a given `n > 1`:\n\n1.  **`sort(a, n - 1)`:** The function first makes a recursive call to sort the subarray `a[0...n-2]`. After this call, we can assume that the first `n-1` elements of the array are sorted.\n2.  **`if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`:** It then compares the last element of the current scope, `a[n-1]`, with the element just before it, `a[n-2]`. After the first step, `a[n-2]` is the largest element in the sorted prefix `a[0...n-2]`.\n3.  **Conditional block:**\n    *   If `a[n - 1] >= a[n - 2]`, the `if` condition is false. This means `a[n-1]` is in the correct position relative to the now-sorted prefix. The entire subarray `a[0...n-1]` is sorted, and the function returns for this level of recursion.\n    *   If `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`, the condition is true. The element `a[n-1]` is out of place.\n        *   **`swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`:** The algorithm swaps these two elements. Now `a[n-1]` (which was the original `a[n-2]`) is correctly placed as the largest element. However, the new `a[n-2]` (which was the original `a[n-1]`) has been moved into the prefix `a[0...n-2]` and may have disrupted its sorted order.\n        *   **`sort(a, n - 1)`:** Because the prefix might now be unsorted, the algorithm makes a *second* recursive call to `sort(a, n - 1)` to re-sort the prefix `a[0...n-2]` completely.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Recurrence Relation for Time Complexity\nLet `T(n)` be the time complexity of `sort(a, n)`. The base case is `T(1) = O(1)`, as the function does nothing for `n <= 1`.\nFor `n > 1`, the time complexity is the sum of the complexities of its parts:\n*   The first `sort(a, n - 1)` call takes `T(n-1)`.\n*   The comparison and potential swap take constant time, `O(1)`.\n*   The second, conditional `sort(a, n - 1)` call, if executed, takes `T(n-1)`.\n\nSo, the recurrence relation is:\n*   **Best Case:** `T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1)` (if the `if` condition is always false).\n*   **Worst Case:** `T(n) = T(n-1) + O(1) + T(n-1) = 2 * T(n-1) + O(1)` (if the `if` condition is always true).\n\nThe question asks for the **worst-case** time complexity.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Worst-Case Input\nThe worst case occurs when the second recursive call `sort(a, n-1)` is made at every step of the recursion (for `n`, `n-1`, ..., `2`). This happens if the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is always true after the first `sort(a, n-1)` call completes.\nLet's consider an array sorted in reverse order, for example, `[4, 3, 2, 1]`. Let's trace `sort(a, 4)`:\n1.  `sort(a, 3)` is called on the prefix `[4, 3, 2]`. This call will eventually sort the prefix, so `a` becomes `[2, 3, 4, 1]`.\n2.  The `if` condition is checked: `if a[3] < a[2]` -> `if 1 < 4`. This is **true**.\n3.  A swap occurs, making `a` become `[2, 3, 1, 4]`.\n4.  The second `sort(a, 3)` is called.\n\nThis pattern holds for any reverse-sorted array. At step `k`, `sort(a, k-1)` sorts the prefix, leaving the smallest element at the end (e.g., `[2, 3, ..., k, 1]`). The comparison `1 < k` will be true, triggering the second recursive call. Thus, a reverse-sorted array represents a worst-case scenario.\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Worst-Case Recurrence Relation\nWe need to solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`, where `c` is a constant and `T(1) = d` (another constant). We can solve this by expansion:\n*   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n*   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n*   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n*   ... after `k` steps ...\n*   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) + ... + 1)`\nThe geometric series sum is `(2^k - 1)`.\n*   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^k - 1)`\nWe continue until we reach the base case `T(1)`. Let `n-k = 1`, which means `k = n-1`.\n*   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n*   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * d + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n*   `T(n) = (d+c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\nIn Big-O notation, the dominant term is `2^(n-1)`, which is `O(2^n)`.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\nThe number of operations grows exponentially with the size of the input `n`. The worst-case time complexity is `O(2^n)`. This matches option E.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n*   **Base Case:** The recursion has a proper base case (`n <= 1`), so it will terminate.\n*   **Recurrence Structure:** The key feature is the two recursive calls on a problem of size `n-1`, not `n/2` or some other fraction. This leads to `2T(n-1)`.\n*   **Worst-Case Condition:** Confirmed that a reverse-sorted array reliably triggers the `if` condition at each level of recursion, justifying the use of the `2T(n-1)` formula.\n*   **Recurrence Solution:** The solution to `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c` is exponential, specifically `O(2^n)`.\n\nFinal Answer is `O(2^n)`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
