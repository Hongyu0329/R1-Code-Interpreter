    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to determine the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Ion (M⁺) and Molecular Mass**\n\n1.  The mass spectrum shows a cluster of peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) region. These are likely the molecular ion peaks.\n2.  The most significant cluster appears to start at m/z 260 and includes peaks at 262, 264, and 266. Looking at the table, the intensities are:\n    *   m/z 260: I = 34.8%\n    *   m/z 262: I = 29.0%\n    *   m/z 264: I = 12.9%\n    *   m/z 266: I = 3.22%\n3.  The nominal molecular mass (corresponding to the ion with the lightest isotopes, e.g., ¹²C, ¹H, ³⁵Cl) is likely 260 u.\n4.  The pattern of peaks separated by 2 mass units is characteristic of the presence of chlorine or bromine atoms.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Number of Chlorine/Bromine Atoms**\n\n1.  The natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is approximately ³⁵Cl (75.8%) and ³⁷Cl (24.2%), a ratio of roughly 3:1.\n2.  The natural abundance of bromine isotopes is approximately ⁷⁹Br (50.7%) and ⁸¹Br (49.3%), a ratio of roughly 1:1.\n3.  Let's analyze the isotopic pattern of the molecular ion cluster {260, 262, 264, 266}.\n    *   Relative intensities to the first peak (m/z 260): I(260)=100, I(262)=83.3, I(264)=37.1, I(266)=9.3.\n    *   The theoretical pattern for 3 chlorine atoms (Cl₃) is M⁺ : M⁺+2 : M⁺+4 : M⁺+6 in a ratio of approximately (3)³:3(3)²(1):3(3)(1)²:(1)³ which simplifies to 27:27:9:1, or in relative terms normalized to the first peak, approx. 100:96:33:4.\n    *   The observed pattern (100:83:37:9) is a reasonably good match for a molecule containing **three chlorine atoms**.\n\n4.  This conclusion is strongly supported by the presence of a Cl⁺ ion peak at m/z 35 (I=3.09%) and its isotope at m/z 37 (I=1.04%), with a ratio of ~3:1.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Major Fragmentation Peaks**\n\n1.  **Base Peak (m/z 225):** The most intense peak is at m/z 225 (I=100%).\n    *   The mass difference between the molecular ion (260) and the base peak (225) is 260 - 225 = 35 u. This corresponds to the loss of a single chlorine atom (Cl•).\n    *   This fragmentation, M⁺• → [M-Cl]⁺ + Cl•, is very common.\n    *   The fragment at m/z 225, being [M-Cl]⁺, should contain two chlorine atoms.\n    *   Let's check its isotopic signature. We expect peaks at m/z 225, 227 (M+2), and 229 (M+4). The theoretical intensity ratio for a Cl₂ fragment is ~9:6:1, or normalized to the first peak, 100:66:11.\n    *   From the table: I(225)=100, I(227)=66.7, I(229)=22.2.\n    *   The observed ratio of 100:66.7:22.2 is an excellent match for the theoretical pattern of a fragment containing **two chlorine atoms**. This confirms our analysis.\n\n2.  **Other Significant Fragments:**\n    *   **m/z 190:** Mass difference from the base peak (225) is 225 - 190 = 35. It is generally not possible for an even-electron ion like [M-Cl]⁺ to lose a radical like Cl•. A more plausible pathway is the loss of a neutral molecule like HCl (mass 36). 225 - 36 = 189. The peak at 190 is likely the [M-Cl-HCl]⁺ fragment.\n    *   **m/z 153 & 155:** Following the same logic, loss of another HCl molecule from the m/z 189 fragment (189 - 36 = 153) would explain the peak at m/z 153. This sequential loss of HCl is characteristic of chlorinated cycloalkanes.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Molecular Formula**\n\n1.  We have established the nominal molecular mass is 260 and the molecule contains 3 chlorine atoms.\n2.  The mass contribution of 3x³⁵Cl is 105 u.\n3.  The mass of the rest of the molecule (let's call it the CₓHᵧ part) is 260 - 105 = 155 u.\n4.  We need to find a formula for CₓHᵧ that equals 155 u. Using the Rule of 13 (155 ÷ 13 = 11 with a remainder of 12), a possible formula is C₁₁H(11+12) = C₁₁H₂₃. This is not plausible for a stable molecule with the required unsaturation.\n5.  A better guess for a hydrocarbon fragment with mass 155 is **C₁₂H₁₁** (12*12 + 11*1 = 144 + 11 = 155).\n6.  Therefore, a plausible molecular formula for the compound is **C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃**.\n7.  Let's check the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃: DBE = C - (H+X)/2 + 1 = 12 - (11+3)/2 + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = 6. This indicates the presence of rings and/or double bonds, such as an aromatic ring (4 DBE) and other unsaturation.\n\n**Step 5: Propose a Structure and IUPAC Name**\n\n1.  The fragmentation pattern (loss of Cl•, then sequential losses of HCl) suggests a structure that has both easily removable Cl atoms and H atoms on carbons adjacent to other C-Cl bonds.\n2.  A structure that fits the formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃ and the DBE of 6 is a trichlorinated phenylcyclohexene. This structure has a phenyl group (C₆H₅-, provides 4 DBE), a cyclohexene ring (C₆H₇- with the substituent, provides 2 DBE), and three chlorine atoms. The formula of 1-phenylcyclohexene is C₁₂H₁₄. Substituting 3 H atoms with 3 Cl atoms gives C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃.\n3.  A plausible isomer that accounts for the fragmentation is **1-phenyl-4,5,6-trichlorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n    *   The C-Cl bonds on the saturated part of the ring would be readily cleaved.\n    *   The presence of hydrogen atoms on the chlorine-bearing carbons (or adjacent carbons) allows for the observed sequential elimination of HCl.\n4.  While other isomers exist, this structure class is consistent with all the major features of the mass spectrum.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the molecular ion, isotopic patterns, and fragmentation pathways, the compound is identified as an isomer of phenyltrichlorocyclohexene.\n\n>>> 1-phenyl-4,5,6-trichlorocyclohex-1-ene"
