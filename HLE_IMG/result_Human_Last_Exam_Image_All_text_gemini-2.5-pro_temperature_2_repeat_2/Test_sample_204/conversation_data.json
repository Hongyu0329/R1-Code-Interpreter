    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the order of the specimens based on increasing silicate structure complexity.\n\n### **Step-by-step analysis**\n\n**1. Identify each mineral specimen:**\n\n*   **Specimen A:** This specimen is a dark-colored (dark green to black) mineral with a prismatic crystal habit (elongated in one direction). It appears to have two cleavage directions. This morphology is characteristic of minerals in the Inosilicate group, specifically pyroxenes (which have cleavage angles near 90°) or amphiboles (cleavage near 60°/120°). A common example is Augite (pyroxene) or Hornblende (amphibole). Both belong to the **Inosilicates (chain silicates)**.\n*   **Specimen B:** This specimen is clearly layered and separates into thin, flexible sheets. It has a greenish color and a pearly luster. This property, known as perfect basal cleavage, is the defining characteristic of sheet silicates like micas and chlorite. This mineral belongs to the **Phyllosilicates (sheet silicates)**.\n*   **Specimen C:** This is an aggregate of small, glassy, olive-green crystals with a granular texture. This appearance is classic for **Olivine**. Olivine is the primary member of the **Nesosilicates (isolated tetrahedra silicates)**.\n*   **Specimen D:** This is a transparent, glassy (vitreous luster) crystal that shows a six-sided (hexagonal) prism shape, although it is not perfectly formed. It lacks obvious cleavage and would likely exhibit conchoidal fracture. This is a classic example of **Quartz**. Quartz belongs to the **Tectosilicates (framework silicates)**.\n\n**2. Understand the hierarchy of silicate structures:**\n\nThe complexity of silicate minerals is determined by the way the fundamental building blocks, the silica tetrahedra (SiO₄), are linked together. The complexity increases with the number of shared oxygen atoms per tetrahedron. The order from least complex to most complex is:\n\n*   **Nesosilicates (Isolated Tetrahedra):** SiO₄ tetrahedra are isolated and linked only by cations. This is the simplest structure.\n    *   *Example: Olivine (Specimen C)*\n*   **Inosilicates (Chain Silicates):** Tetrahedra are linked to form single or double chains by sharing oxygen atoms. This is more complex than isolated tetrahedra.\n    *   *Example: Pyroxenes and Amphiboles (Specimen A)*\n*   **Phyllosilicates (Sheet Silicates):** Tetrahedra share three of their four oxygen atoms to form continuous sheets. This structure is more interconnected than chains.\n    *   *Example: Micas and Chlorite (Specimen B)*\n*   **Tectosilicates (Framework Silicates):** Every tetrahedron shares all four of its oxygen atoms with neighboring tetrahedra, creating a complete three-dimensional framework. This is the most complex and polymerized structure.\n    *   *Example: Quartz (Specimen D)*\n\n**3. Order the specimens:**\n\nBased on the identification and the hierarchy of silicate structures, we can now order the specimens from the least complex to the most complex silicate structure.\n\n1.  **Least Complex:** Nesosilicate -> **Specimen C (Olivine)**\n2.  **Next:** Inosilicate -> **Specimen A (Pyroxene/Amphibole)**\n3.  **Next:** Phyllosilicate -> **Specimen B (Mica/Chlorite)**\n4.  **Most Complex:** Tectosilicate -> **Specimen D (Quartz)**\n\nTherefore, the final order is C, A, B, D.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C, A, B, D}$."
