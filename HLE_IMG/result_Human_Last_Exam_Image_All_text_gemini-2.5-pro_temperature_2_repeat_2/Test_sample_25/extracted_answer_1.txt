The result should be interpreted as invalid. Although a Ct value (30.8) was generated before the cut-off (40 cycles), the amplification curve is not a valid sigmoidal shape. The curve shows a slow, linear drift rather than a true exponential amplification, which suggests the signal is likely due to non-specific amplification or an assay artifact. Therefore, the result is unreliable and the test should be repeated.
