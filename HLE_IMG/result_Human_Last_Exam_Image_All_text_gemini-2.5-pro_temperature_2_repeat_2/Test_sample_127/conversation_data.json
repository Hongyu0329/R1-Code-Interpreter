    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Structure:** The image displays a complex iridium (Ir) cation. It's an octahedral complex, likely Ir(III), which is common for such structures. The central Ir atom is coordinated by three bidentate ligands.\n    *   One ligand is composed of rings E and F, which appears to be a 2,2'-bipyridine (an N,N-type ligand), coordinating through the nitrogen atoms of both rings.\n    *   Another ligand is composed of rings C and D, with a substituent J. This is a phenylpyridine derivative (a C,N-type ligand). The solid wedge bond from Ir to C6 of ring C indicates a cyclometalation, i.e., a direct Ir-C sigma bond. The ligand coordinates through this carbon (C6 of C) and the nitrogen of the pyridine ring D.\n    *   The third ligand is composed of rings A and B, with substituents H, K, and L. This is another highly substituted phenylpyridine derivative (a C,N-type ligand). It coordinates through the nitrogen of pyridine ring B. The dotted line from Ir to C6 of ring A suggests a similar cyclometalation or at least a strong interaction at this position. The + charge on the complex is consistent with an Ir(III) center with two anionic C,N-ligands and one neutral N,N-ligand: [Ir(C^N)₂(N^N)]⁺.\n\n2.  **Define \"Free Rotation\":** In the context of solution chemistry, \"free rotation\" refers to the rotation around a single bond that has a low energy barrier. High energy barriers are caused by steric hindrance, which is the repulsion between atoms or groups of atoms that are brought too close together as the bond rotates. We need to evaluate the steric environment around the single bond that connects each phenyl ring (G, H, J, K, L) to the main ligand framework.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Phenyl Ring:**\n\n    *   **Ring G:** Ring G is attached to position C6 of the pyridine ring D. Pyridine D is coordinated to the iridium center via its nitrogen atom (N). Position C6 is directly adjacent to the coordinating nitrogen atom. Therefore, ring G is positioned very close to the large and sterically demanding iridium coordination sphere (Ir atom and its other ligands). Rotation of ring G would cause severe steric clashes between its ortho-hydrogens and the rest of the complex. **Therefore, rotation of ring G is hindered.**\n\n    *   **Ring K:** Ring K is attached to position C6 of the phenyl ring A. This is the same position (C6) where the cyclometalation or strong interaction with the iridium atom occurs. The phenyl ring K is therefore directly attached to the atom that is bonded to the iridium center. This creates an extremely crowded environment. **Therefore, rotation of ring K is hindered.**\n\n    *   **Ring L:** Ring L is attached to position C5 of the phenyl ring A. Let's examine its neighbors on ring A. At C6, there is ring K and the interaction with Ir. At C4, there is ring H. Ring L is \"sandwiched\" between two very bulky groups. Rotation of ring L would be sterically blocked by the group at C6 (phenyl K plus the iridium coordination) on one side and the phenyl ring H on the other. **Therefore, rotation of ring L is hindered.**\n\n    *   **Ring H:** Ring H is attached to position C4 of the phenyl ring A. Its neighbors on ring A are the pyridine ring B (at C3) and the phenyl ring L (at C5). Both pyridine and phenyl groups are large. Ring H is flanked by two bulky substituents. This situation is analogous to a 2,6-disubstituted biphenyl system, which is known to have a very high barrier to rotation. **Therefore, rotation of ring H is hindered.**\n\n    *   **Ring J:** Ring J is attached to position C4 of the phenyl ring C. Let's examine its neighbors on ring C. At C3, there is the pyridine ring D. At C5, there is just a hydrogen atom (which is not explicitly drawn but is implied by valence rules). Ring J is flanked by one bulky group (pyridine D) and one very small group (a hydrogen atom). While the pyridine at the adjacent position will create some rotational barrier, this environment is significantly less crowded than that of rings G, K, L, and H. Compared to the others, which are hindered by the metal center directly or by two bulky groups, ring J is the only one with a much less restricted environment. It has the highest degree of rotational freedom. **Therefore, ring J is the most likely to rotate freely.**\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the steric analysis, rings G, K, L, and H all experience significant steric hindrance that will prevent free rotation. Ring J is in the least sterically crowded position and is the only ring that can be considered to rotate freely.\n\n5.  **Match with Answer Choices:** The conclusion is that only ring J can rotate freely. Looking at the answer choices, option L corresponds to \"J\".\n\n<<<L>>>"
