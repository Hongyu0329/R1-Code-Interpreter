{"A": "In chemical A, a hexahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole ring is formed by the [3+2] cycloaddition reaction. The nitrogen atom of the substituent pyrroline ring is acetylated. The methyl ester group and a hydrogen atom are attached to the newly formed five-membered ring.", "B": "In chemical B, the primary cycloadduct undergoes oxidation. A pyrrole ring is formed through aromatization, and a ketone group is introduced, forming a dihydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrol-5-one ring system.", "C": "Chemical C is the mixed anhydride formed from the starting material and acetic anhydride. The carboxylic acid group of the proline derivative has reacted with acetic anhydride."}
