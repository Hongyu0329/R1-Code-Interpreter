    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key signature and the home key.**\nThe key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). The sonata's first movement is in C minor. We will perform the analysis relative to the home key of C minor.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the measure in question.**\nThe question specifies measure 30. This measure is circled in the provided image.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the notes present in measure 30.**\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** On the first beat, there is an octave A (A2 and A3). On the third beat, there is a chord containing C#3, E3, and A3. So the left hand provides the notes A, C#, and E.\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The right hand plays a pattern of sixteenth notes throughout the measure. The notes are C#5, E5, G#5, and B4. The sharp on C# and G# are explicit accidentals. The E is natural because the preceding measures contained E naturals (like in the G7 chord in m. 29) and there is no E-flat re-established. The B is natural.\n\n**Step 4: Combine all the notes to identify the chord.**\nThe complete set of notes played in measure 30 is A, C#, E, G#, and B. Stacking these notes in thirds starting from the root A gives us:\n*   A (Root)\n*   C# (Major Third)\n*   E (Perfect Fifth)\n*   G# (Major Seventh)\n*   B (Major Ninth)\nThis combination of notes forms an **A major 9th chord (Amaj9)**.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the harmonic function of the chord in its musical context.**\nTo find the correct Roman numeral, we must understand the chord's function, not just its name. We need to look at the chords immediately before and after it.\n*   **Measure 29 (the preceding measure):** The chord is a G7 chord (G-B♮-D-F). In the key of C minor, G7 is the dominant seventh chord, which is notated as **V7**.\n*   **Measure 31 (the following measure):** The left hand plays a D octave, and the right hand plays F#, A, C, and E♭. This forms a D7(♭9) chord (D dominant seventh with a flatted ninth). This D7 chord is the dominant of G. In C minor, G is the dominant (V). Therefore, the D7 chord is the dominant of the dominant, notated as **V7/V**.\n*   **Analyzing Measure 30:** The chord in measure 30 is Amaj9. It moves to a D7(♭9) chord in measure 31. The root of the chord moves from A to D, which is an ascending perfect fourth. This root movement (like A to D, G to C, or D to G) is characteristic of a dominant chord resolving to its tonic.\n*   Therefore, the A-major-based chord in measure 30 is acting as the dominant of the D-major-based chord in measure 31.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the Roman numeral.**\nBased on the functional analysis:\n*   The home key is C minor (**i**).\n*   Its dominant is G major (**V**).\n*   The dominant of G is D major (**V/V**).\n*   The chord in measure 30, A major, is functioning as the dominant of D major. Therefore, it is the dominant of the dominant of the dominant.\n*   This is notated as **V/V/V**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Chord Quality:** A functioning dominant is typically a major triad or a dominant seventh chord (major triad with a minor seventh). Here, Beethoven uses an A major 9th chord (Amaj9), which has a *major* seventh (G#). This is a chromatic alteration. The G# creates a stronger pull upwards to the A in the following D7 chord. Despite this chromatic color, the root relationship A → D is so strong that the dominant function is clear.\n2.  **Context is Key:** Simply identifying the chord as being built on the raised sixth degree of C minor (`♯VI`) would be technically correct in terms of the scale degree, but it would miss the chord's crucial role in the harmonic progression. Harmonic analysis prioritizes function over literal spelling.\n3.  **Chain of Dominants:** This passage is an example of a chain of secondary dominants, which builds tension by delaying the arrival at a stable chord. The sequence is V/V/V (Amaj9 in m. 30) → V/V (D7(b9) in m. 31) → V (implied target G, the dominant of C minor).\n\n<<<V/V/V>>>"
