1. The music modulates to the key of B minor.
2. The tonic of the new key, B, is the subtonic (the flattened 7th degree) of the original key, C# minor. This creates a chromatic modulation, a common device for Beethoven to achieve a darker and more dramatic effect than a traditional modulation to the relative major.
3. The complete Roman numeral marking for the first beat of measure 11 is `i` in the new key of B minor. The chord is fundamentally a B minor tonic chord, with the G# functioning as a dissonant non-chord tone (a pedal/appoggiatura).
