    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Textual Clues**\nThe prompt provides several key pieces of information:\n*   **It's an illusion:** This means what is perceived is different from the physical reality of the stimulus.\n*   **It's similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity:** The Necker Cube is a 2D drawing that the brain interprets as a 3D cube. Its ambiguity lies in the fact that there are two equally plausible 3D orientations, and our perception can flip between them. This comparison suggests the phenomenon in question involves the brain \"filling in\" missing information or resolving ambiguity to create a coherent, stable perception from an incomplete or ambiguous signal.\n*   **It reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability:** This indicates it's a fundamental part of how our sensory system works automatically in everyday life, without us actively thinking about it.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Visual Information**\nThe image consists of two graphs representing a sound event over time.\n*   **Top Graph (Spectrogram):** This graph plots frequency (vertical axis) against time (horizontal axis). We see a long, thin horizontal line, which represents a pure tone of a constant frequency. In the middle, this line is interrupted by a thick vertical bar, which represents a sound containing a wide range of frequencies, such as a burst of static, a cough, or a click. Visually, our brain tends to see the horizontal line as a single entity continuing *behind* the vertical bar.\n*   **Bottom Graph (Waveform):** This graph plots sound amplitude (vertical axis) against time (horizontal axis). On the left, we see a regular, smooth sine wave, which is the physical representation of the pure tone. In the middle section, this sine wave abruptly stops and is replaced by a complex, irregular, and noisy signal. After the noise, the pure sine wave resumes. This graph reveals the physical reality: the tone is **not** present during the noise burst; it has been completely removed and replaced.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Illusion**\nBy combining the text and images, we can understand the illusion:\n*   The physical stimulus is a tone that is interrupted by a burst of noise.\n*   The perceptual experience (the illusion) is that the tone continues uninterrupted *through* the noise.\n*   The brain effectively \"restores\" or \"fills in\" the missing segment of the tone, assuming it's the most logical continuation of the sound, which has simply been momentarily masked by another sound. This process is automatic and unconscious, fitting the prompt's description.\n\n**Step 4: Name the Phenomenon**\nThis well-known auditory illusion is a classic example of top-down processing in perception. The general principle is often called the **Auditory Continuity Illusion** or **Auditory Induction**.\nHowever, the most famous and widely cited specific example of this phenomenon was demonstrated by psychologist Richard Warren. He showed that if a speech sound (a phoneme) in a sentence was deleted and replaced with a meaningless sound like a cough or a tone, people would report hearing the entire, complete sentence. They would not notice the missing phoneme and would struggle to locate where the cough occurred. This powerful effect on speech perception is called the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**.\n\nGiven the prompt's reference to a \"surprisingly common\" ability, it strongly alludes to the practical effect of understanding speech in noisy environments, which makes the **Phonemic Restoration Effect** the most precise and well-known name for this type of perceptual completion illusion, even though the image uses a simpler tone for illustrative purposes.\n\n<<<Phonemic Restoration Effect>>>"
