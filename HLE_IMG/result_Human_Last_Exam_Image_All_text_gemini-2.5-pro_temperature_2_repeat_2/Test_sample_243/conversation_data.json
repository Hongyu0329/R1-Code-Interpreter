    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key features of the plant in the image.**\n    The plant shown is an evergreen shrub. Its most distinctive feature is its leaves. The leaves are dark green, have an elliptical to lanceolate shape, and a smooth margin. They possess a very prominent and intricate network of pale, cream-colored or light green veins (reticulated venation) that contrasts sharply with the darker leaf surface. The leaves appear to be arranged in opposite pairs or whorls around the stem.\n\n2.  **Identify the plant species based on its features.**\n    These unique characteristics, especially the reticulated venation on leathery, whorled leaves, are hallmarks of the species *Pittosporum cornifolium*. This plant is commonly known as Tawhiri karo. A visual comparison with documented images of *Pittosporum cornifolium* confirms the identification.\n\n3.  **Determine the native range of the identified plant.**\n    The next step is to research the natural habitat and endemic range of *Pittosporum cornifolium*. Botanical sources and conservation databases confirm that *Pittosporum cornifolium* is an endemic species.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the specific endemic location.**\n    This species is endemic to New Zealand. Its distribution is predominantly throughout the **North Island**, from the northernmost parts down to the south. While there are some scattered populations in the northern parts of the South Island (specifically the Marlborough Sounds and northwest Nelson), its primary and most continuous range is the North Island.\n\n5.  **Address the question's phrasing.**\n    The question asks for \"the name of the island\" (singular) to which the plant is endemic. Given that the plant's main, largest, and most contiguous habitat is the North Island, this is the most precise and appropriate answer to the question.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the plant is *Pittosporum cornifolium*, and it is primarily endemic to the North Island of New Zealand.\n\n<<<North Island>>>"
