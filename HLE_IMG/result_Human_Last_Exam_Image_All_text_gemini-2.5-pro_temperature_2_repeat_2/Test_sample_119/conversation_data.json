    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is observed at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 135 g/mol.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight (135) suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule, most likely one nitrogen atom.\n*   **Fragmentation:** There are significant fragment peaks at m/z 91 and m/z 105. A peak at m/z 91 is very characteristic of a benzyl cation (C₆H₅CH₂⁺) or its rearranged, more stable form, the tropylium ion (C₇H₇⁺). This strongly suggests the presence of a C₆H₅CH₂- moiety in the structure.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** There are two distinct, medium-intensity peaks in this region. This pattern is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **~3000-3100 cm⁻¹:** Peaks in this area indicate sp² C-H stretching, which is consistent with an aromatic ring.\n*   **~2850-2960 cm⁻¹:** Peaks here are due to sp³ C-H stretching from aliphatic groups.\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹ and ~1450-1500 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions correspond to C=C stretching vibrations within an aromatic ring.\n*   **Absence of strong peak at ~1700 cm⁻¹:** This confirms the absence of a carbonyl (C=O) group. The compound is not an amide, ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid.\n\n**Summary from MS and IR:**\nThe compound has a molecular weight of 135, contains one nitrogen atom as a primary amine (-NH₂), and includes a benzene ring attached to an aliphatic side chain. A plausible molecular formula would be C₉H₁₃N. The degree of unsaturation for C₉H₁₃N is DBE = 9 - (13/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 4, which is consistent with one benzene ring.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **δ 7.1-7.3 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** This signal pattern and integration are characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n*   **δ ~2.9 ppm (multiplet, ~1H):** A signal corresponding to a single proton in a complex environment (coupled to multiple other protons).\n*   **δ ~2.8 ppm (multiplet, ~2H):** A signal for two protons, likely a CH₂ group, also showing complex splitting.\n*   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, ~3H):** A signal for three protons split into a doublet, indicating a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (-CH).\n*   **-NH₂ Protons:** The two protons of the primary amine group are often broad and may be underlying the other signals or exchanged with solvent, hence they are not clearly identified as a separate peak with a clean integration. The total count from the clearly integrated C-H protons is 5 (aromatic) + 1 + 2 + 3 = 11. With the two amine protons, the total is 13, matching the formula C₉H₁₃N.\n\n**4. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis**\n*   **¹³C Chemical Shifts (ppm):** 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. There are 7 unique carbon signals.\n*   **DEPT-135 Information:** \"one negative and five positive signals\".\n    *   DEPT-135 shows CH and CH₃ groups as positive signals, CH₂ groups as negative signals, and quaternary carbons (like the ipso-carbon of the ring) as no signal.\n    *   **Negative Signal (1):** This must be one CH₂ group.\n    *   **Positive Signals (5):** These correspond to CH and CH₃ groups.\n    *   **No Signal (1):** This must be one quaternary carbon.\n*   **Signal Assignment:**\n    *   **Aromatic Region (δ 126-146 ppm):**\n        *   145.1 ppm: This is the quaternary ipso-carbon (C-1 of the ring, attached to the side chain). It is absent in the DEPT-135 spectrum.\n        *   128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm: These three signals are the aromatic CH carbons. These account for three of the five positive signals in the DEPT-135 spectrum.\n    *   **Aliphatic Region (δ < 60 ppm):**\n        *   49.6 ppm: Typically for a carbon attached to a nitrogen (C-N).\n        *   43.5 ppm: Likely the CH₂ group (would be the negative DEPT signal).\n        *   19.2 ppm: A typical shift for an aliphatic methyl (CH₃) group.\n    *   The aliphatic carbons consist of one CH₂, one CH, and one CH₃. This gives one negative signal and two positive signals, which together with the three positive aromatic CH signals makes five positive signals in total. This perfectly matches the DEPT-135 data.\n\n**5. HSQC Analysis (¹H-¹³C Correlation)**\n*   The HSQC spectrum correlates each proton with the carbon it is directly bonded to.\n*   **Aromatic Region:** The protons at δ ~7.2 ppm correlate with the carbons at δ 126.3, 127.3, and 128.5 ppm, confirming they are aromatic C-H groups.\n*   **Aliphatic Correlations:**\n    *   The proton doublet at **δ ~1.2 ppm** correlates with the carbon at **δ 19.2 ppm**. This confirms the **CH₃** group.\n    *   The proton multiplet at **δ ~2.8 ppm** correlates with the carbon at **δ 43.5 ppm**. This confirms the **CH₂** group.\n    *   The proton multiplet at **δ ~2.9 ppm** correlates with the carbon at **δ 49.6 ppm**. This confirms the **CH** group.\n\n**6. Structure Determination and Naming**\n*   The pieces are: a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-), a CH₂ group, a CH group, a CH₃ group, and an NH₂ group.\n*   The ¹H NMR shows a CH₃ group adjacent to a CH group (CH-CH₃ fragment).\n*   The NH₂ group is likely on the CH, as the ¹³C shift (49.6 ppm) is characteristic for a C-N bond. This gives a -CH(NH₂)-CH₃ fragment.\n*   Combining the remaining pieces gives the full structure: C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃.\n*   This structure is consistent with all data:\n    *   The benzylic CH₂ protons are next to a stereocenter (the CH carbon), making them diastereotopic and resulting in a complex multiplet, as observed at ~2.8 ppm.\n    *   The CH proton is coupled to the adjacent CH₂ (2H) and CH₃ (3H), leading to a complex multiplet, as observed at ~2.9 ppm.\n    *   MS fragmentation to give a benzyl cation (m/z 91) is explained by the cleavage of the C-C bond between the CH₂ and CH groups.\n\n*   **IUPAC Name:**\n    1.  The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (amine) is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n    2.  Number the chain to give the amine group the lowest possible number. This places the -NH₂ on carbon 2. The parent name is propan-2-amine.\n    3.  A phenyl group (C₆H₅-) is a substituent on carbon 1.\n    4.  The final name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
