    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total current flowing through the circuit.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main objective is to calculate the total current flowing out of the positive terminal of the voltage source, V2. This can be found using Ohm's Law (I = V / R_eq), where V is the total voltage and R_eq is the total equivalent resistance of the circuit.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Circuit Structure:** The circuit is composed of a voltage source (V2 = 1 V) connected to two main branches in parallel.\n    *   The left branch contains resistors R1, R2, and R3.\n    *   The right branch contains resistors R7 and R8.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Equivalent Resistance of the Left Branch:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Observe the connection around R2. There is a wire connecting the node above R2 (between R1 and R2) to the node below R2 (between R2 and R3). This wire is in parallel with R2.\n    *   An ideal wire has a resistance of 0 Ω. When a component is in parallel with a short circuit (0 Ω resistance), all the current will flow through the path of least resistance (the wire), bypassing the component.\n    *   Therefore, resistor R2 is short-circuited and effectively removed from the current path.\n    *   This simplifies the left branch to R1 and R3 being connected in series.\n    *   The equivalent resistance of the left branch (let's call it R_left) is:\n        R_left = R1 + R3 = 3 Ω + 9 Ω = 12 Ω.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Equivalent Resistance of the Right Branch:**\n    *   Resistors R7 and R8 are connected one after the other in a single line. This is a series connection.\n    *   The equivalent resistance of the right branch (let's call it R_right) is the sum of their resistances:\n        R_right = R7 + R8 = 100 Ω + 100 Ω = 200 Ω.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Equivalent Resistance (R_eq) of the Circuit:**\n    *   The two branches (left and right) are connected in parallel to the voltage source.\n    *   The total equivalent resistance is calculated using the formula for parallel resistors: 1/R_eq = 1/R_left + 1/R_right.\n    *   1/R_eq = 1/12 Ω + 1/200 Ω\n    *   To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 600.\n    *   1/R_eq = (50/600) + (3/600) = 53/600 Ω⁻¹\n    *   Therefore, the total equivalent resistance is:\n        R_eq = 600 / 53 Ω ≈ 11.32 Ω.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Current (I_total):**\n    *   Using Ohm's Law, I_total = V2 / R_eq.\n    *   V2 = 1 V\n    *   R_eq = 600 / 53 Ω\n    *   I_total = 1 V / (600 / 53 Ω) = 53 / 600 A.\n    *   Converting the fraction to a decimal:\n        I_total ≈ 0.088333... A.\n\nThe total current flowing through the circuit is approximately 0.0883 Amperes.\n\n<<<0.0883"
