    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Benzene + Propanoyl chloride with AlCl₃**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The Lewis acid catalyst, AlCl₃, reacts with propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl) to form a highly electrophilic acylium ion ([CH₃CH₂C=O]⁺). The nucleophilic benzene ring then attacks this electrophile in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n    *   **Intermediate-1:** The product is propiophenone (also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n        *   Structure: A phenyl group (C₆H₅) is attached to the carbonyl carbon of a propionyl group (-COCH₂CH₃).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Propiophenone + Br₂/FeBr₃**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically bromination of the benzene ring.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The propionyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) attached to the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group due to the carbonyl. Electron-withdrawing groups are deactivating and *meta*-directing. Therefore, the incoming bromine electrophile (Br⁺), generated from Br₂ and the Lewis acid FeBr₃, will add to the *meta* position (carbon 3) of the phenyl ring relative to the propionyl group.\n    *   **Intermediate-2:** The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one (or *m*-bromopropiophenone).\n        *   Structure: Propiophenone with a bromine atom at the meta position of the phenyl ring.\n\n3.  **Step 3: 1-(3-Bromophenyl)propan-1-one + H₂/Pd**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. For a benzylic ketone (a ketone where the carbonyl group is directly attached to a benzene ring), catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd often results in the complete reduction of the carbonyl group to a methylene (-CH₂-) group. This is a type of hydrogenolysis.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The C=O group is reduced completely to a CH₂ group. The aryl-bromine bond is generally stable under these conditions and remains intact.\n    *   **Intermediate-3:** The product is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n        *   Structure: A benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) at position 3.\n\n4.  **Step 4: 1-Bromo-3-propylbenzene + NBS/(PhCO₂)₂, CCl₄**\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a free-radical bromination.\n    *   **Mechanism:** NBS (*N*-bromosuccinimide) is a reagent used for selective bromination at allylic or benzylic positions. (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide) is a radical initiator. The reaction proceeds via a free-radical chain mechanism. A bromine radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the benzylic position (the carbon atom of the alkyl chain directly attached to the benzene ring) because the resulting benzylic radical is resonance-stabilized. This benzylic radical then reacts with a bromine source to form the final product.\n    *   **Product:** In 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene, the benzylic carbon is the first carbon of the propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃). A bromine atom replaces one of the two hydrogen atoms on this benzylic carbon.\n    *   **Final Product Structure:** The molecule has a propane chain. At carbon 1 of the propane chain, there is a bromine atom and a (3-bromophenyl) group.\n    *   **Final Product Name:** Based on IUPAC nomenclature, we identify the longest carbon chain, which is propane. The substituents on this chain are a bromine atom at position 1 and a 3-bromophenyl group also at position 1. Therefore, the name of the final product is **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\n**Summary of Transformations:**\n*   Benzene → Propiophenone (Friedel-Crafts acylation)\n*   Propiophenone → 1-(3-Bromophenyl)propan-1-one (*meta*-bromination)\n*   1-(3-Bromophenyl)propan-1-one → 1-Bromo-3-propylbenzene (Ketone reduction)\n*   1-Bromo-3-propylbenzene → 1-Bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane (Benzylic bromination)\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
