    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the overall structure.**\n    The image provided is a chemical structure of a complex organic molecule. It features a fused ring system composed of four rings. It contains two nitrogen atoms incorporated into the ring system and one oxygen atom as part of a carbonyl group (C=O). The presence of nitrogen atoms in a heterocyclic system, often derived from natural sources, is characteristic of an alkaloid.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the core skeleton.**\n    The molecule has a tetracyclic (four-ring) framework. This specific framework containing two nitrogen atoms is known as the sparteine skeleton. Sparteine itself is an alkaloid with the formula C₁₅H₂₆N₂ and does not contain any oxygen atoms. The rings are all saturated six-membered rings (piperidine-like).\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the functional groups.**\n    The key functional group that distinguishes this molecule from sparteine is the carbonyl group (C=O). This carbonyl group is adjacent to one of the nitrogen atoms, forming a cyclic amide, which is called a lactam. Since it is in a six-membered ring, it is a δ-lactam.\n\n*   **Step 4: Relate the structure to known alkaloids.**\n    The molecule is an oxidized derivative of sparteine. The alkaloid formed by the oxidation of sparteine at the C-2 position (the carbon atom next to a nitrogen, forming a lactam) is known by the common name **Lupanine**. Lupanine is a prominent member of the quinolizidine class of alkaloids, commonly found in plants of the *Lupinus* genus (lupins).\n\n*   **Step 5: Consider the stereochemistry.**\n    The use of wedges (bonds coming out of the plane) and dashes (bonds going into the plane) indicates a specific stereoisomer. The relative configuration of the chiral centers shown in the diagram corresponds to the structure of the most common, naturally occurring isomer of lupanine, which is (-)-lupanine. Without getting into the absolute configuration (R/S notation for each center), this specific three-dimensional arrangement is recognized as lupanine. Other stereoisomers, like α-isolupanine, have a different spatial arrangement.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the characteristic sparteine skeleton modified with a lactam functional group, the compound is identified as lupanine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
