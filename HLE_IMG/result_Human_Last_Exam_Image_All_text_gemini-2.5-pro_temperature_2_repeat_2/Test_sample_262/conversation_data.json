    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The goal is to determine which of the four provided iridium(III) complexes, used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), are expected to have shorter operational lifetimes.\n\n2.  **Understand the Relationship between Structure and Lifetime:** The operational lifetime of an emissive complex in an LEC is largely dependent on its chemical and electrochemical stability under the device's operating conditions. Degradation of the complex, which leads to a loss of emission and reduced lifetime, often occurs through the dissociation of ligands from the metal center. Therefore, stronger metal-ligand bonds generally lead to greater stability and longer lifetimes.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structures of the Complexes:**\n    *   All four complexes share the same basic structure: a cationic iridium(III) core, [Ir(C^N)₂(N^N)]⁺, with a PF₆⁻ counter-anion.\n    *   The central metal is Iridium(III) (Ir).\n    *   The bidentate diimine (N^N) ligand is the same in all four complexes: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. The bulky tert-butyl groups primarily influence solubility and prevent aggregation and are not expected to be the main differentiator for stability in this series.\n    *   The key difference lies in the two cyclometalating (C^N) ligands, which bind to the iridium through one carbon-iridium bond and one nitrogen-iridium bond. The strength of the Ir-C bond is a critical factor for the overall stability of the complex.\n\n4.  **Examine the Cyclometalating (C^N) Ligands in Each Complex:**\n    *   **Complex 1:** Contains two identical C^N ligands: 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. Both ligands have two fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring.\n    *   **Complex 2:** Contains one 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligand (fluorinated) and one 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligand (non-fluorinated).\n    *   **Complex 3:** Contains one 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine ligand (fluorinated) and one 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligand (non-fluorinated).\n    *   **Complex 4:** Contains one 2-(2,3,4-trifluorophenyl)pyridine ligand (fluorinated) and one 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligand (non-fluorinated).\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Effect of Fluorination on Stability:**\n    *   Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom. When substituted onto the phenyl ring of the C^N ligand, it acts as an electron-withdrawing group.\n    *   This electron withdrawal has a stabilizing effect on the molecule. Specifically, it strengthens the carbon-iridium (Ir-C) bond. A stronger bond is more resistant to breaking, thus hindering ligand dissociation and other degradation pathways.\n    *   Therefore, C^N ligands with fluorine substituents form more stable complexes compared to their non-fluorinated counterparts.\n    *   The 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligand, being non-fluorinated, forms a weaker Ir-C bond compared to the various fluorinated phenylpyridine ligands.\n\n6.  **Compare the Expected Lifetimes:**\n    *   **Complex 1:** Both C^N ligands are fluorinated. This symmetric, highly fluorinated structure is expected to be the most chemically stable among the four, leading to the **longest** operational lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 2, 3, and 4:** Each of these complexes contains one fluorinated C^N ligand and one non-fluorinated ppy ligand. The presence of the ppy ligand introduces a \"weak link\" in the molecule. The Ir-C bond of the ppy ligand is more susceptible to cleavage than the Ir-C bond of the fluorinated ligands. Degradation is likely to initiate at this less stable site.\n    *   Consequently, all three complexes containing a ppy ligand ([2], [3], and [4]) are expected to be less stable than Complex [1]. They are therefore expected to exhibit **shorter** operational lifetimes.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The complexes that are expected to show shorter lifetimes are those containing the less stable, non-fluorinated ppy ligand. These are complexes [2], [3], and [4].\n\n8.  **Final Answer Selection:** Based on the analysis, the correct answer must include complexes 2, 3, and 4. This corresponds to answer choice N.\n\n***\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Focus on the key structural difference:** The only variable component affecting stability is the nature of the C^N ligands.\n*   **Recognize the role of fluorination:** Fluorination is a common and effective strategy to enhance the stability and photophysical properties of phosphorescent metal complexes. It strengthens the critical Ir-C bond.\n*   **Identify the \"weakest link\":** In a heteroleptic complex (a complex with different types of ligands), the overall stability is often dictated by the least stable component. In complexes 2, 3, and 4, the ppy ligand is the least stable C^N ligand.\n*   **Interpret \"shorter lifetimes\":** This is a relative term. The comparison is made among the four given complexes. Complexes 2, 3, and 4 are expected to have shorter lifetimes *relative* to Complex 1.\n\nFinal conclusion: Complexes 2, 3, and 4 all contain a non-fluorinated ppy ligand, which makes them less stable and more prone to degradation than Complex 1, which only contains fluorinated C^N ligands. Therefore, complexes 2, 3, and 4 are expected to have shorter lifetimes.\n\n<<<N>>>"
