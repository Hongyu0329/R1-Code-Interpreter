    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the title and composer of the provided jazz standard.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Musicological Examination:**\n    *   **Key Signature:** The key signature has four flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db). This indicates a key of Ab Major or its relative, F Minor.\n    *   **Time Signature:** The symbol is \"alla breve\" or \"cut time\" (2/2).\n    *   **First Chord:** The piece begins on an F minor chord (notated as `F-`). This strongly suggests the overall key is F minor.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the 'A' Section (First 8 bars):**\n    *   **Melody:** The piece starts with a very distinctive descending melodic phrase: C, Ab, G, F. In the key of F minor, these are the 5th, minor 3rd, 2nd, and root of the scale. This is a highly recognizable melodic hook.\n    *   **Harmony (Chord Progression):** The chords in the first four bars are `| F- | Eø7 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7 |`. This progression features a chromatic descending bass line (F -> E -> Eb -> Db) which is a hallmark of this particular tune. The progression creates a clear and memorable harmonic sound.\n    *   **Identification of the 'A' Section:** The combination of this unique melodic opening and the specific descending chord progression is the signature of the jazz standard **\"Recorda Me\"**.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the 'B' Section (The Bridge):**\n    *   The chord progression of the bridge is `| Dø7 | G7 | C7 | F7 | Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab | G C7 |`. This is a sequence of chords that logically move through different harmonic centers before returning to the F minor tonality for the final 'A' section.\n    *   It is worth noting that this bridge progression is different from the one found in some common published versions of \"Recorda Me\" (like the one in the \"Real Book\"). However, handwritten lead sheets like this often contain personal variations, reharmonizations, or common jam session substitutions.\n\n4.  **Conclusion and Composer Identification:**\n    *   Despite potential variations in the bridge, the \"A\" section is musically identical to \"Recorda Me\". The melody and harmony of the A section are so unique and well-known that they serve as the definitive identifier for the piece.\n    *   This jazz standard was composed by the renowned tenor saxophonist and composer **Joe Henderson**. It first appeared on his debut album \"Page One\" in 1963 and has since become a classic of the jazz repertoire.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Handwritten lead sheets can contain errors, simplifications, or personal variations on the standard chord changes. It's crucial to identify the most defining characteristics of the tune.\n*   The primary identifier is often the main theme or \"head\", which in this AABA form is the 'A' section.\n*   \"Recorda Me\" is the correct title, though sometimes it is misspelled. It is Portuguese for \"Remember Me\".\n\nFinal identification based on the overwhelming evidence from the 'A' section:\n\n**Title:** Recorda Me\n**Composer:** Joe Henderson\n\n<<<Title: Recorda Me, Composer: Joe Henderson>>>"
