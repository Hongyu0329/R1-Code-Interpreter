    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Identify the reaction:** The reaction is the acid-catalyzed dehydration of a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol (germanicol) with cat. HCl at 110 Â°C. The loss of a water molecule (H2O) leads to the formation of a rearranged alkene product. The chemical formula changes from C30H52O to C30H50.\n2.  **Initial carbocation formation:** The acid (H+) protonates the hydroxyl (-OH) group at C-3, converting it into a good leaving group, water (-OH2+). The loss of a water molecule generates a secondary carbocation at the C-3 position.\n3.  **Carbocation rearrangement:** The problem states that the reaction involves a \"number of [1,2] shifts\". This points to a Wagner-Meerwein type \"backbone rearrangement\", which is common for this class of compounds under acidic conditions. This is a cascade of sequential [1,2]-hydride and [1,2]-methyl shifts that relieves ring strain and leads to a thermodynamically more stable carbocation, which then eliminates a proton to form the final alkene. The rearrangement propagates the positive charge through the carbon skeleton.\n4.  **Tracing the [1,2] shifts:** We will trace the movement of the carbocation and the migrating groups. We'll use the standard numbering for the triterpenoid skeleton.\n    *   **Start:** Secondary carbocation at C-3.\n    *   **Shift 1:** A [1,2]-methyl shift occurs. The axial methyl group from the quaternary C-4 migrates to C-3. This forms a more stable tertiary carbocation at C-4.\n    *   **Shift 2:** A [1,2]-hydride shift. The axial hydrogen atom from C-5 migrates to the carbocation at C-4. This moves the positive charge to C-5, forming another tertiary carbocation.\n    *   **Shift 3:** A [1,2]-methyl shift. The axial methyl group from the quaternary C-10 migrates to the carbocation at C-5. The positive charge is now at C-10.\n    *   **Shift 4:** A [1,2]-hydride shift. The axial hydrogen from C-9 migrates to the carbocation at C-10. The positive charge moves to C-9.\n    *   **Shift 5:** A [1,2]-methyl shift. The axial methyl group from C-8 migrates to the carbocation at C-9. The positive charge is now at C-8.\n    *   **Shift 6:** A [1,2]-methyl shift. The methyl group from C-14 migrates to the carbocation at C-8. The positive charge is now at C-14.\n    *   **Shift 7:** A [1,2]-hydride shift. The hydrogen atom from C-13 migrates to the carbocation at C-14. This forms the final tertiary carbocation at C-13, known as the oleanyl cation.\n5.  **Elimination:** The carbocation at C-13 undergoes an elimination (E1) reaction. A proton is lost from an adjacent carbon to form a stable double bond. The product shown has a double bond at the C-13/C-18 position, which is a common and stable outcome (olean-18-ene). This is formed by the removal of a proton from C-18.\n6.  **Determining the final substituents:** Now we determine the identity (H or CH3) of the substituent at each of the numbered positions in the final product based on the migration cascade.\n    *   **Position 1 (at C-4):** The starting material has two methyl groups at C-4. The axial one migrated to C-3. The equatorial methyl group remained. A hydrogen atom from C-5 migrated to C-4. Therefore, position 1, which points to the remaining methyl group, is **CH3**.\n    *   **Position 2 (at C-10):** The starting material has a methyl group at C-10. This methyl group migrated to C-5. A hydrogen atom from C-9 migrated to C-10. Therefore, the substituent at position 2 is now an **H**. (Note: The diagram shows a methyl group here, which is inconsistent with the standard mechanism. In such cases, the mechanistic pathway is typically trusted over a potentially simplified or erroneous drawing.)\n    *   **Position 3 (at C-8):** The starting material has a methyl group at C-8. This methyl group migrated to C-9. A methyl group from C-14 migrated to C-8. Therefore, the substituent at position 3 is now a **CH3**.\n    *   **Position 4 (at C-14):** The starting material has a methyl group at C-14. This methyl group migrated to C-8. A hydrogen atom from C-13 migrated to C-14. Therefore, the substituent at position 4 is now an **H**.\n    *   **Position 5 (at C-13):** The starting material has a hydrogen atom at C-13. This hydrogen atom migrated to C-14. C-13 then becomes part of the final double bond. The question is asking for the identity of the substituent at this position. Since the original occupant that took part in the rearrangement was a hydrogen atom, we identify it as **H**.\n\nCombining these results gives the final answer.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1.  **C-4:** The equatorial methyl group remains. Answer: **CH3**\n2.  **C-10:** The original methyl group leaves, and a hydrogen arrives from C-9. Answer: **H**\n3.  **C-8:** The original methyl group leaves, and a methyl group arrives from C-14. Answer: **CH3**\n4.  **C-14:** The original methyl group leaves, and a hydrogen arrives from C-13. Answer: **H**\n5.  **C-13:** The original hydrogen atom leaves. Answer: **H**\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = H, 5 = H>>>"
