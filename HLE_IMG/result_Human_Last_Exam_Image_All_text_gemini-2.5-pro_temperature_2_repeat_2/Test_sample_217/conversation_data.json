    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the meaning of the cuneiform sign.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the image:** The image displays a single cuneiform sign. It has a distinct structure: a rectangular base, vertical and nested horizontal lines within the base, and a triangular shape on top, resembling a roof. There are also small horizontal strokes extending from the sides and top.\n2.  **Identify the sign's nature:** The form of the sign is pictographic, meaning it is a simplified drawing of a physical object. The visual representation strongly suggests a building or a dwelling.\n3.  **Trace the sign's history:** This particular sign is known in Assyriology as **Ã‰** (also transcribed as Eâ‚‚). It is one of the earliest and most fundamental cuneiform signs, with its origins dating back to the Uruk period (late 4th millennium BCE). The form shown in the image is a classic archaic or third-millennium BCE representation of a house or reed hut. The triangle represents the roof, and the rectangle below represents the walls and entrance.\n4.  **Determine the meaning:** The Sumerian logogram **Ã‰** directly translates to \"house\" or \"temple\". Temples were considered the \"house\" of a deity. Therefore, the core meaning is \"house\" or \"dwelling.\"\n5.  **Evaluate the answer choices:**\n    *   A. Tool: Cuneiform signs for tools (like a plow, `apin`, or an adze, `nagar`) have different shapes, usually depicting the tool itself. This sign is not a tool.\n    *   B. Guard: A guard is a person or a role. Signs for professions or people do not typically look like buildings.\n    *   C. Bread: The sign for bread (`ninda`) is also a pictograph, but it depicts a ration bowl or a loaf of bread, which has a round or ovoid shape. This is incorrect.\n    *   D. Home: \"Home\" is a synonym for \"house\" or \"dwelling\". This aligns perfectly with the pictographic origin and established meaning of the sign Ã‰.\n    *   E. Deity: The determinative sign for a deity (`dingir`) is a star-like symbol (ð’€­). This is clearly not the sign shown.\n    *   F. Beard: The sign for a beard (`su`) is a pictograph of the lower part of a human face with a beard. It looks very different from the sign in the image.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   **Form Evolution:** Cuneiform signs evolved over millennia, from pictographs to more abstract and simplified wedge-based forms. The question specifically asks for the third-millennium form, and the image provided is an excellent example of the sign's appearance during that period (specifically the Early Dynastic period).\n*   **Logographic Meaning:** This sign is primarily a logogram, meaning the sign itself stands for a whole word (\"house\"), rather than a syllable.\n*   **Context:** While the sign Ã‰ can be part of larger compound words (e.g., Ã‰.GAL, \"big house,\" meaning \"palace\"), its fundamental meaning on its own is \"house.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe analysis shows that the cuneiform sign is a pictograph of a house and is known as Ã‰, which means \"house\" or \"temple\" in Sumerian. Among the given choices, \"Home\" is the correct meaning.\n\n<<<D>>>"
