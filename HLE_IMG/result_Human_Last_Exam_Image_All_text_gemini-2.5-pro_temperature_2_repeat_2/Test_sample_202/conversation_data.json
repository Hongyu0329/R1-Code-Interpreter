    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify each rock specimen:\n\n**Analysis of Specimen H**\n*   **Step 1: Observe the visual characteristics.** Specimen H is reddish-brown and has a rough surface. It is covered in many small holes or bubbles.\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the texture.** The presence of numerous holes (called vesicles) indicates that the rock was formed from lava that contained a lot of trapped gas. As the lava cooled and solidified, the gas bubbles were preserved, creating a porous texture. This is known as a vesicular texture, which is characteristic of extrusive (volcanic) igneous rocks.\n*   **Step 3: Interpret the color.** The reddish-brown color suggests the presence of iron, which has been oxidized (rusted). This is common in mafic lava flows.\n*   **Step 4: Combine the observations to identify the rock.** A highly vesicular, reddish-brown to black extrusive igneous rock is known as **scoria**. It is sometimes called lava rock.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen I**\n*   **Step 1: Observe the visual characteristics.** Specimen I is composed of numerous smaller rock fragments of various sizes, colors, and shapes. These fragments are cemented together by a finer-grained material (matrix).\n*   **Step 2: Examine the shape of the fragments (clasts).** The fragments are visibly sharp and angular, not rounded.\n*   **Step 3: Classify the rock based on its composition and texture.** A rock made of fragments of other rocks is called a clastic rock. When the fragments are angular and larger than 2 mm, the rock is classified as **breccia**. If the fragments were rounded, it would be a conglomerate. Given the angularity of the clasts, this specimen is a breccia. It could be of either sedimentary or volcanic origin (volcanic breccia).\n\n**Analysis of Specimen J**\n*   **Step 1: Observe the visual characteristics.** Specimen J is very light in color (whitish-gray) and has a very porous, frothy appearance. The vesicles are very small and numerous, giving it an almost styrofoam-like look.\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the texture and color.** The extremely high number of vesicles indicates it formed from a gas-rich, explosive volcanic eruption where the lava cooled extremely rapidly. The light color suggests a felsic (silica-rich) composition.\n*   **Step 3: Combine the observations to identify the rock.** A light-colored, highly vesicular volcanic rock with a glassy, frothy texture is known as **pumice**. Due to its high porosity, pumice has a very low density and can often float on water.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen K**\n*   **Step 1: Observe the visual characteristics.** Specimen K is made of large, interlocking crystals that are clearly visible to the naked eye. The rock has a crystalline, not fragmental or vesicular, structure.\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the texture.** The presence of large, visible crystals (a phaneritic texture) indicates that the rock cooled slowly, deep beneath the Earth's surface. This allowed ample time for large crystals to grow. This is characteristic of an intrusive igneous rock.\n*   **Step 3: Observe the mineral composition.** The rock is composed of light-colored minerals (white to pinkish, likely feldspar) and grayish, glassy-looking minerals (likely quartz), along with some darker minerals (likely biotite mica or hornblende).\n*   **Step 4: Combine the observations to identify the rock.** A coarse-grained, intrusive igneous rock with a felsic composition (rich in quartz and feldspar) is called **granite**.\n\n---\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Granite\n\n<<<\nH: Scoria\nI: Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Granite\n>>>"
