    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks for the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm among the nine visualized matrices (Wigner 3-j symbols).\n\n2.  **Define Infinity-Norm:** The infinity-norm of a matrix, denoted as `||A||_∞`, is the maximum absolute row sum. Mathematically, `||A||_∞ = max_i Σ_j |a_ij|`. In the context of the given heatmaps, this means we need to find the horizontal row in each image where the sum of the magnitudes of the cell values is the largest. The magnitude is represented by the intensity of the color (red or green), with white representing zero.\n\n3.  **Identify the Matrix with the Maximum Infinity-Norm:**\n    *   We need to visually compare the nine plots to find the one with the \"hottest\" row. The \"hottest\" row is the one with the highest sum of color intensities.\n    *   Plots 3 and 9 are the most prominent candidates. They have circular/oval shapes and feature the most saturated, vibrant red and green colors, indicating high-magnitude values.\n    *   Comparing plot 3 and plot 9, plot 9 appears to have a slightly higher concentration of peak-intensity cells, especially in the rows near the horizontal center.\n    *   Therefore, the matrix visualized in **plot 9** is concluded to have the maximum infinity-norm.\n\n4.  **Identify the Matrix with the Minimum Infinity-Norm:**\n    *   We need to find the plot with the \"coldest\" or palest rows.\n    *   Plots 6 and 8 are the main candidates, as they are both very pale and have elongated shapes.\n    *   Comparing them, plot 6 is clearly the most \"washed-out\" or faint. The colors are extremely desaturated compared to all other plots, including plot 8.\n    *   Therefore, the matrix visualized in **plot 6** is concluded to have the minimum infinity-norm.\n\n5.  **Estimate the Ratio of Norms (`||W_9||_∞ / ||W_6||_∞`):**\n    *   This requires estimating the maximum row sum for both plot 9 and plot 6 and then dividing them. We can do this by estimating the number of colored cells in the respective rows and their average magnitudes.\n    *   Let's define a magnitude scale where the most saturated color (the brightest reds/greens in plot 9) has a value of 1.0, and white has a value of 0.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Plot 9 (Maximum Norm):**\n        *   The \"hottest\" row is near the horizontal center.\n        *   Let's count the number of colored cells in this row (`N_9`). It is approximately **10**.\n        *   The magnitudes of these cells are high. Some are near the maximum of 1.0, while others are of medium intensity (e.g., 0.5-0.7). A reasonable estimate for the average magnitude of the cells in this row (`AvgMag_9`) is around **0.65**.\n        *   Estimated Norm(9) ≈ `N_9 × AvgMag_9` ≈ `10 × 0.65 = 6.5`.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Plot 6 (Minimum Norm):**\n        *   The \"hottest\" row is also at the horizontal center.\n        *   The number of colored cells in this row (`N_6`) is approximately **12**.\n        *   The magnitudes of all cells are very low. The brightest cell in this plot is very pale, with a magnitude estimated to be around 0.15-0.20 compared to the maximum in plot 9. The average magnitude (`AvgMag_6`) for the cells in the central row will be even lower, estimated at around **0.10**.\n        *   Estimated Norm(6) ≈ `N_6 × AvgMag_6` ≈ `12 × 0.10 = 1.2`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Ratio:**\n    *   Ratio = (Maximum Norm) / (Minimum Norm) ≈ Norm(9) / Norm(6)\n    *   Ratio ≈ `6.5 / 1.2` ≈ `5.4167`\n\n7.  **Final Answer Formulation:** The detailed visual estimation consistently produces a value around 5.4. Given the nature of the question, a precise decimal answer is likely expected. The value 5.4 is the most plausible result derived from the visual evidence.\n\n<<<5.4>>>"
