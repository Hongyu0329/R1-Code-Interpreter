The main difference is the seta (the stalk that supports the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, causing the capsule to be immersed or emergent (nestled among the leaves). In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a long and distinctly curved or swan-necked (cygneous) seta, which holds the capsule exserted (well above the leaves), often in a nodding position.
