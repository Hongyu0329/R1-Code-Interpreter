    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Graph Structure:** The provided image is a Google Trends graph. The x-axis represents time, from December 2019 to late 2023. The y-axis represents relative search interest, from 0 to 100. There are three data series plotted: a red line, a yellow line, and a blue line. The question states that these represent search interest for three different historic events that all occurred in the same country. The key to solving this is identifying the pattern of the peaks, which suggests annual commemorations or anniversaries.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Red Line:**\n    *   The red line shows a very large initial spike in late January / early February 2020.\n    *   It then shows smaller, but still significant, spikes around the same time each year (early 2021, early 2022, early 2023).\n    *   This pattern is characteristic of a major, world-changing event that happened in early 2020, with subsequent anniversaries reminding people of it.\n    *   A significant historical event that fits this profile is the **Wuhan lockdown**, which marked the beginning of global awareness of the COVID-19 pandemic. The lockdown began on January 23, 2020. This event is strongly associated with **China**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Yellow Line:**\n    *   The yellow line exhibits a very sharp, distinct peak every year in early June.\n    *   One peak, around June 2022, is the highest point on the entire graph, reaching the maximum interest level of 100.\n    *   This strong annual spike in early June points to the anniversary of a very famous and politically sensitive event.\n    *   The **Tiananmen Square Massacre**, which occurred on June 4, 1989, is a major event in modern Chinese history. Its anniversary is a time of heightened global interest, discussion, and censorship every year. This matches the pattern perfectly. The country is **China**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Blue Line:**\n    *   The blue line shows smaller annual peaks. These peaks consistently occur in late May or very early June, slightly before the yellow line's peaks.\n    *   Given that the other two events point strongly to China, this third event must also be from Chinese history and have an anniversary in late May.\n    *   The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 were not a single-day event. They built up over several weeks. A key escalation was the declaration of **Martial Law in Beijing on May 20, 1989**.\n    *   The anniversary of the lead-up to the massacre, including the declaration of martial law, would explain the search interest spike in late May, just before the spike for the anniversary of the massacre itself on June 4th. This event is part of the history of **China**.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   **Red Line Event:** Wuhan Lockdown / COVID-19 Outbreak (January 23, 2020).\n    *   **Blue Line Event:** Tiananmen Protests / Declaration of Martial Law (May 20, 1989).\n    *   **Yellow Line Event:** Tiananmen Square Massacre (June 4, 1989).\n    *   All three are significant historic events.\n    *   The anniversaries of these events perfectly match the annual spikes seen in the graph.\n    *   All three events took place in **China**. The interconnectedness of these events (major crises and events of state control) is something a historian would readily identify.\n\nThe country in which all three of these historic events took place is China.\n\n<<<China>>>"
