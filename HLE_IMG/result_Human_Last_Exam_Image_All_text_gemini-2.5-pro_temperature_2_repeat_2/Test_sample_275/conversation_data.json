    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify all the splice species from the provided RT-PCR results.\n\n**Overall Strategy**\n\nThe goal is to identify and count every unique mRNA molecule (splice species) implied by the bands on the gel. A splice species is defined by its unique combination of exons and its polyadenylation site (early or late). We will analyze each PCR experiment (each panel) to identify the species it detects, being careful not to double-count species that are detected in multiple experiments.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Early Transcripts (Panels B, C, D)**\n\nThese experiments use reverse primers (E4R, E5R) located before the late region, thus detecting transcripts that are polyadenylated at the early site (AE).\n\n*   **Panel B (E1F1/E4R) & C (E1F1/E5R):** These panels both show two distinct bands.\n    *   Band 1 (190 bp in B, 584 bp in C) represents the first early splice species.\n    *   Band 2 (159 bp in B, 553 bp in C) represents a second early splice species, which is 31 bp shorter.\n*   **Panel D (E1F2/E5R):** This uses a primer (E1F2) that only amplifies transcripts with the `929^3465` splice. It produces a single band (551 bp) corresponding to band 2 in panel C. This confirms that the second early species contains the `929^3465` splice. No new species is identified.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Early Transcripts:** There are **2** distinct early splice species.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Late, L1-Containing Transcripts (Panels H, I)**\n\nThese experiments use a reverse primer (L1R) in the L1 gene, detecting transcripts that are polyadenylated at the late site (AL) and contain the L1 exon.\n\n*   **Panel I (E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles):** This is the more sensitive experiment and reveals the full complexity. Four distinct bands are visible.\n    *   Band 1 (450 bp)\n    *   Band 2 (419 bp)\n    *   Band 3 (378 bp)\n    *   Band 4 (187 bp)\n*   **Panel H (E1F1/L1R, 20 cycles):** This less sensitive experiment confirms the two major species (450 bp and 419 bp).\n\n*   **Conclusion for Late, L1-Containing Transcripts:** There are **4** distinct late splice species that include the L1 exon.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Late, L2-Containing Transcripts (Panels E, F, G)**\n\nThese experiments use a reverse primer (L2R) in the L2 gene, detecting late transcripts that contain the L2 exon. These are distinct from the L1-containing species.\n\n*   **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** This uses a primer (E1F3) specific for the `929^3506` splice. It reveals two distinct bands.\n    *   Band 1 (1,003 bp) represents one L2-containing species.\n    *   Band 2 (931 bp) represents a second L2-containing species.\n    These **2** species are unique because they are defined by the specific `929^3506` splice.\n*   **Panel F (E1F2/L2R):** This uses a primer (E1F2) specific for the `929^3465` splice. It shows a single band (972 bp). This represents a third L2-containing late species, which is distinct from the two identified in Panel G because it uses a different splice junction.\n*   **Panel E (E1F1/L2R):** This uses the general E1F1 primer and shows one band (1,005 bp). This confirms the existence of the major L2-containing transcript identified in Panel F (the size difference is due to the different forward primer positions) but does not identify a new species.\n\n*   **Conclusion for Late, L2-Containing Transcripts:** There are a total of **3** distinct late splice species that include the L2 exon (2 from Panel G + 1 from Panel F).\n\n**Step 4: Final Count**\n\nTo find the total number of splice species, we sum the unique species identified in each class:\n\n*   Early Species: 2\n*   Late, L1-containing Species: 4\n*   Late, L2-containing Species: 3\n\nTotal Number of Splice Species = 2 + 4 + 3 = 9.\n\n**List of All Identified Splice Species:**\n\n1.  **Early Species 1:** Detected in panels B/C (long version).\n2.  **Early Species 2:** Detected in panels B/C (short version), contains the 929^3465 splice.\n3.  **Late L1 Species 1:** Detected in panel I (450 bp).\n4.  **Late L1 Species 2:** Detected in panel I (419 bp).\n5.  **Late L1 Species 3:** Detected in panel I (378 bp).\n6.  **Late L1 Species 4:** Detected in panel I (187 bp).\n7.  **Late L2 Species 1:** Detected in panel G (1,003 bp), contains the 929^3506 splice.\n8.  **Late L2 Species 2:** Detected in panel G (931 bp), also contains the 929^3506 splice but is shorter.\n9.  **Late L2 Species 3:** Detected in panel F (972 bp), contains the 929^3465 splice.\n\n<<<9>>>"
