    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Analyze the first clue:** \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\" The image shows two men in suits at what appears to be an awards ceremony. The man on the right, with a beard, is receiving a trophy from the older man on the left. The date, June 20, 2019, points to the annual NHL Awards, which took place on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas.\n    2.  **Identify the individuals:** The man on the right is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov, a player for the Tampa Bay Lightning. At the 2019 NHL Awards, he won the Hart Memorial Trophy (league MVP) and the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player as voted by the players). The man on the left is Gary Bettman, the Commissioner of the NHL, who often presents major awards. The image captures the moment Kucherov is receiving an award.\n    3.  **Connect to the term X Y:** Nikita Kucherov is a famous ice hockey player. A very common and significant term in ice hockey is \"hat trick,\" which is when a player scores three goals in a single game.\n    4.  **Analyze the second clue:** \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This clue points to an industrial or historical process.\n    5.  **Connect the clues:** The process of making felt hats in the 18th and 19th centuries used a mercury compound (mercury(II) nitrate) to separate fur from the pelt and mat the fibers together. This process was known as \"carroting\". The \"trick\" of making a felt hat involved this toxic process. The constant exposure to mercury led to neurological damage in hatmakers, coining the phrase \"mad as a hatter.\" This dangerous method has been discontinued.\n    6.  **Synthesize the answer:** The term \"Hat Trick\" connects both clues perfectly.\n        *   It is a key concept in the sport of the person pictured (Nikita Kucherov). The image represents the world of professional hockey, where a \"hat trick\" is a celebrated achievement.\n        *   The \"trick\" of making a \"hat\" (felt hat) is the historical process that used mercury salts and has now ceased due to its toxicity.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   The date in the question (June 20) is one day off from the actual event date (June 19), which is a minor discrepancy.\n    *   The phrase \"is pictured\" is used representatively. The concept of a \"hat trick\" is pictured through the subject (a famous hockey player) and the context (a hockey awards ceremony), not a literal depiction of three goals being scored or hats being thrown.\n    *   The double meaning of \"hat trick\" is central to solving the puzzleâ€”one meaning from sports and another from historical industry.\n\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
