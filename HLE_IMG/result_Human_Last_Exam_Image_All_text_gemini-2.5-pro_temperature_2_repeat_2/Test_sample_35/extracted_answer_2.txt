The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **V-domain of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE)**.

This protein could be used as a **prognostic marker** in the pathology of neurological disorders. Although its involvement in multiple diseases means it can also serve as an adjunct marker, its primary value comes from its prognostic potential. As shown in the diagram, S100B is an upstream initiator of signaling pathways that directly cause neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Therefore, its expression level is not just correlated with the disease but is a direct indicator of the pathogenic activity, allowing it to predict the severity and future course of the disorder.
