    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling shown in the image.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the concept of Rotational Symmetry:** A pattern has n-fold rotational symmetry if it appears identical after being rotated by an angle of 360/n degrees around a specific point (the center of rotation). For a tiling, which is assumed to cover an infinite plane, we look for such centers of rotation. The question asks for the rotational symmetry of the tiling, which is typically understood as the highest order of rotational symmetry present.\n\n2.  **Examine the Components of the Tiling:** The tiling is constructed from a few distinct shapes:\n    *   Dark blue regular hexagons.\n    *   Light yellow squares.\n    *   Light yellow \"bow-tie\" or star-shaped pentagons.\n    *   Orange rhombi (diamonds).\n\n3.  **Identify Potential Centers of Rotation:** We need to find points in the pattern around which a rotation will leave the entire tiling unchanged. Let's test the centers of the most regular shapes.\n\n    *   **Center of a dark blue hexagon:** Let's choose the center of one of the blue hexagons as a potential center of rotation. A regular hexagon itself has 6-fold symmetry (it looks the same after rotations of 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, and 300°). We must check if the surrounding pattern also respects this symmetry.\n        *   Each blue hexagon is surrounded by six identical yellow star-pentagons and six orange rhombi.\n        *   If we rotate the entire pattern by 60° (360°/6) around the center of the hexagon, the hexagon itself is mapped onto its original position.\n        *   Each surrounding yellow star-pentagon is mapped onto the position of the next one.\n        *   Each orange rhombus is also mapped onto the position of the next one.\n        *   Extending this observation to the rest of the pattern, it appears that the entire tiling is mapped onto itself by a 60° rotation. This means the tiling possesses **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n    *   **Center of a light yellow square:** Now let's consider the center of a yellow square. A square has 4-fold rotational symmetry (90° rotations).\n        *   Each square is surrounded by four orange rhombi.\n        *   Rotating by 90° (360°/4) around the square's center maps the square onto itself and each orange rhombus onto the next one. The surrounding pattern also seems to align perfectly.\n        *   This indicates that the tiling also has centers of **4-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n    *   **Other Centers:** One can also find other centers of rotation. For example, the center of an orange rhombus is a center of **2-fold rotational symmetry** (a 180° rotation leaves the tiling unchanged). There are also points of **3-fold rotational symmetry** (at the vertices where a hexagon and two star-pentagons meet, a 120° rotation leaves the tiling unchanged).\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The tiling has centers of rotation of several different orders (2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold). When asked for \"the rotational symmetry\" of a pattern, the standard convention is to state the highest order of symmetry present. In this case, the highest order is 6.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Global vs. Local Symmetry:** It is important to ensure that the symmetry applies to the entire tiling, not just a local cluster of tiles. The 6-fold rotation around the hexagon centers clearly maps the entire repeating pattern onto itself.\n*   **Crystallographic Restriction Theorem:** This theorem states that any periodic crystal or tiling can only have 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6-fold rotational symmetry. This pattern is periodic, and our finding of 6-fold symmetry is consistent with this theorem. The initial thought that there might be 5-fold symmetry is incorrect for a periodic tiling; the 5-sided shapes are part of a larger structure that does not have overall 5-fold symmetry.\n*   **Identifying the Highest Order:** The question implicitly asks for the highest order of symmetry, as this defines the overall symmetry classification of the pattern (its plane symmetry group is p6m). While 4-fold and other symmetries exist, the 6-fold symmetry is the highest and most defining rotational characteristic.\n\nThe final answer is the highest order of rotational symmetry found, which is 6.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
