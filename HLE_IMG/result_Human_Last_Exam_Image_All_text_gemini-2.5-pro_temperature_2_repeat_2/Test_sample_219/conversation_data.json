    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph and the Task**\nThe image provided is a raster plot, a common way to visualize the firing activity (spikes) of multiple neurons over time.\n*   The **y-axis** represents the different electrodes, each recording the activity of one or more neurons. The scale is from Electrode 0 to Electrode 128.\n*   The **x-axis** represents time in seconds (s), with major ticks every 10 seconds from 0 to 50 s.\n*   Each black dot represents an electrical spike (an action potential) recorded at a specific electrode at a specific time.\n\nThe task is twofold:\n1.  Identify the time points (timestamps) of \"synchronized bursts\". A synchronized burst is a short period where a large fraction of the recorded neurons fire at a high rate, appearing as a dense vertical band in the raster plot.\n2.  Calculate the \"average inter-burst interval\" (IBI), which is the average time between these consecutive bursts. The final answer for the average IBI should be given to two significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Timestamps of Synchronized Bursts**\nBy visually inspecting the graph from left to right, we can identify distinct vertical bands of dense activity. We will estimate the start time of each of these bursts by reading their position on the x-axis.\n\n1.  **Burst 1:** The first clear, dense burst of activity starts at approximately **2 s**.\n2.  **Burst 2:** The second burst begins at approximately **12 s**.\n3.  **Burst 3:** A third, slightly less intense but still clearly synchronized burst, starts at approximately **22 s**.\n4.  **Burst 4:** A fourth, very prominent burst starts at approximately **33 s**.\n5.  **Burst 5:** The final burst visible in this time window starts at approximately **46 s**.\n\nSo, the identified timestamps for the start of the synchronized bursts are: **2 s, 12 s, 22 s, 33 s, and 46 s**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time duration between the start of one burst and the start of the next. With 5 bursts, we can calculate 4 intervals.\n\n*   **IBI between Burst 1 and Burst 2:** `12 s - 2 s = 10 s`\n*   **IBI between Burst 2 and Burst 3:** `22 s - 12 s = 10 s`\n*   **IBI between Burst 3 and Burst 4:** `33 s - 22 s = 11 s`\n*   **IBI between Burst 4 and Burst 5:** `46 s - 33 s = 13 s`\n\nThe calculated inter-burst intervals are 10 s, 10 s, 11 s, and 13 s.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual intervals and divide by the number of intervals (which is 4).\n\n*   **Sum of IBIs:** `10 s + 10 s + 11 s + 13 s = 44 s`\n*   **Average IBI:** `44 s / 4 = 11 s`\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer with Significant Figures**\nThe question requires the average inter-burst interval to be given to two significant figures. Our calculated average is 11 s. The number 11 has two significant figures (the '1' in the tens place and the '1' in the ones place). Therefore, the value already meets the requirement.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Burst Definition:** Visually identifying bursts can be subjective. The event at 22s is weaker but follows the pattern and is a synchronized network event, so it is correctly included. Excluding it would significantly alter the result.\n*   **Timestamp Accuracy:** The reading of the x-axis has a certain margin of error. However, as long as the readings are consistent, small variations (e.g., reading 2.5s instead of 2s) do not change the final answer when rounded to two significant figures.\n*   **Significant Figures:** Adhering to the specified precision is crucial for the final answer.\n\n**Summary of results:**\n*   **Burst timestamps:** ~2 s, ~12 s, ~22 s, ~33 s, ~46 s.\n*   **Inter-burst intervals:** 10 s, 10 s, 11 s, 13 s.\n*   **Average Inter-burst interval:** 11 s (which is correctly expressed to two significant figures).\n\n<<<11>>>"
