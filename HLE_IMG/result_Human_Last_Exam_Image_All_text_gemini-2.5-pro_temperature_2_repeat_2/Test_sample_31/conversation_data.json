    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the knot**\n\n1.  **Crossing Number:** First, we count the number of crossings in the provided diagram. By careful inspection, we can identify 6 distinct crossings. The three crossings stacked vertically on the left are clearly visible, and there are three other crossings distributed around the knot. Therefore, this is a diagram of a 6-crossing knot.\n2.  **Alternating Property:** We need to check if the knot diagram is alternating. An alternating diagram is one where the crossings alternate between 'over' and 'under' as we travel along the knot. Let's trace a path along the strand:\n    *   Start at the top of the central twisted column, on the over-strand.\n    *   Following it down, it goes **under** at the middle crossing of the column.\n    *   Continuing down, it goes **over** at the bottom crossing of the column.\n    *   It then loops to the left and goes **under** at the bottom-most crossing.\n    *   It continues up and to the right, going **over** at the right-most crossing.\n    *   Finally, it loops up and to the left, going **under** at the central-left crossing before returning to the start.\n    The sequence of crossings is over, under, over, under, over, under. Since the crossings alternate, this is an alternating diagram of an alternating knot.\n3.  **Knot Type Identification:** The knot is a 6-crossing alternating knot. The knots with crossing number 6 are denoted 6_1, 6_2, and 6_3. All three of these happen to be alternating knots. We must distinguish which one this diagram represents. By comparing the given diagram to standard knot tables (like the Rolfsen or Thistlethwaite tables):\n    *   The **6_1 knot** (Stevedore's knot) usually has a diagram resembling a figure-eight with a twisted band passing through it.\n    *   The **6_2 knot** has a known minimal diagram that perfectly matches the one in the picture, characterized by a vertical column of three positive twists.\n    *   The **6_3 knot** has a different, more symmetric standard diagram.\n    Based on this visual evidence, we can confidently identify the knot as **6_2**.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the formula for the Rasmussen invariant for alternating knots**\n\n1.  **Rasmussen invariant (s-invariant):** The Rasmussen invariant, denoted `s(K)`, is a powerful integer-valued invariant of a knot K derived from its Khovanov homology.\n2.  **Theorem for Alternating Knots:** A key result in modern knot theory, established by Jacob Rasmussen, provides a simple way to calculate the s-invariant for any alternating knot. The theorem states that for an alternating knot K, its Rasmussen invariant is the negative of its classical signature, σ(K).\n    *   **Formula:** `s(K) = -σ(K)`\n\n**Step 3: Find the signature of the 6_2 knot**\n\n1.  **Knot Signature (σ):** The signature is a classical knot invariant that can be calculated in several ways (e.g., from a Seifert matrix or the Goeritz matrix). However, for well-known knots, this value is readily available in standard knot theory references and online databases.\n2.  **Look up the value:** Consulting a reliable source like the \"Knot Atlas\" (or other knot theory tables), we find the properties for the 6_2 knot.\n    *   Knot: 6_2\n    *   Signature: `σ(6_2) = -2`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Rasmussen invariant**\n\n1.  **Apply the formula:** Now we combine the information from the previous steps using the formula `s(K) = -σ(K)`.\n2.  **Calculation:**\n    *   `s(6_2) = -σ(6_2)`\n    *   `s(6_2) = -(-2)`\n    *   `s(6_2) = 2`\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant of the knot 6_2 is 2. This result is consistent with other known properties of the invariant; for example, it is an even integer, and its magnitude provides a lower bound for twice the slice genus of the knot (`|s(6_2)| = 2`, and `2 * g_4(6_2) = 2 * 1 = 2`, so `2 ≤ 2`).\n\n<<<2>>>"
