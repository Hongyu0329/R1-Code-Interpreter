    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the song's details:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the musical notation.**\n*   **Time Signature & Tempo:** The music is written in 4/4 time. At the top left, there is a tempo marking \"M.M. = 176\" (or something very close to that number), indicating a very fast tempo (uptempo).\n*   **Key Signature & Chords:** There is no key signature, and the piece heavily features C major chords, ending on a C chord in the Coda. This indicates the key is C Major. The chord symbols provided (C, E7, F, G7, C-, D-, A-) are typical for jazz or popular music lead sheets.\n*   **Rhythm & Melody:** The rhythm is highly syncopated, filled with sixteenth notes and quick passages. The melody is virtuosic, with fast runs and arpeggios. This points towards a lively, technically demanding style.\n*   **Structure:** The notation includes \"To Go Out - Take D.S. To Coda\", which means after playing through, the performer should go back to the sign (the S-like symbol, \"segno,\" in the ninth measure) and play until the instruction \"To Coda\", then jump to the Coda section to finish. This is a standard structure for popular songs and jazz standards.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the specific tune from its musical features.**\n*   The most telling feature is the combination of the melody and the specific chord progression in the first section.\n*   **Melody:** The opening melodic phrase in the first full measure is `C-E-G-A G-F-E-F`.\n*   **Chords:** The chord progression begins `C | C | E7 | E7 | F | F | ...`.\n*   The combination of this distinct, bouncy melody with the unusual but characteristic harmonic move from an E7 chord to an F chord is the defining signature of the famous Brazilian song \"Tico-Tico no Fub치\". The E7 acts as a V7/vi (leading to A minor), but its resolution to F (the subdominant) is a well-known feature of this piece.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the style and origin of the identified song.**\n*   **Title:** The song is \"Tico-Tico no Fub치\".\n*   **Country of Origin:** The composer of the piece is Zequinha de Abreu, who was from **Brazil**. The song was written in 1917.\n*   **Musical Style:** The original and primary musical genre of \"Tico-Tico no Fub치\" is **Choro**. Choro is a traditional Brazilian instrumental music style known for its fast tempos, syncopation, and virtuosity, often considered a precursor to Samba and Bossa Nova. Due to its international popularity and improvisational nature, it has been widely adopted into the **Latin Jazz** and general jazz repertoire.\n\n<<<Title: Tico-Tico no Fub치, Musical Style: Choro (often played as Latin Jazz or Samba), Country of Origin: Brazil>>>"
