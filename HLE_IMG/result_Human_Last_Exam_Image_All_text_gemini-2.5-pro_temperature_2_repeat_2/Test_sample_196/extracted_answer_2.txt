1. **[4π + 2π]**: One molecule acts as a 4π component (e.g., as a C2-O1-C6 1,3-dipole) and the other as a 2π component (e.g., the C4=C5 double bond).
2. **[4π + 4π]**: Each molecule acts as a 4π component (e.g., two 1,3-dipoles or two diene systems reacting with each other).
3. **[6π + 4π]**: One molecule acts as a 6π component (using the 6π system of the pyrylium ring) and the other as a 4π component (e.g., as a diene).
4. **[8π + 2π]**: One molecule acts as an 8π component (using the entire conjugated π-system including the exocyclic oxygen) and the other as a 2π component (e.g., the C4=C5 double bond).
