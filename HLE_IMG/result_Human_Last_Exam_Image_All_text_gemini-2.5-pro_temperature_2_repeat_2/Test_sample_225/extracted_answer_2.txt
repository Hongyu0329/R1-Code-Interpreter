The final product, compound A, is tris(2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)methanol. The reaction involves the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the three ketene acetal bridges of the starting material. Each hydrolysis cleaves a bridge to form two phenolic hydroxyl groups and a molecule of acetic acid. After the hydrolysis of all three bridges, the central triphenylmethylium cation reacts with water to form the stable tertiary alcohol (carbinol).

The structure of compound A is a central carbon atom single-bonded to one hydroxyl group and three 2,6-dihydroxyphenyl rings.
