    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the name of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: N-protection of Tryptophan**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The synthesis begins with (S)-tryptophan, which is an alpha-amino acid. It possesses a primary amine group (-NH2), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and an indole side chain. The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is (S).\n*   **Reagents:** Benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a classic reaction for the protection of an amine group. Under the basic conditions provided by NaOH, the amino group of tryptophan is nucleophilic and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl. This process attaches a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) protecting group to the nitrogen atom. The Cbz group is a carbamate. The NaOH also serves to deprotonate the carboxylic acid and neutralize the HCl formed during the reaction.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan. The amino group has been converted to an N-Cbz group (-NH-Cbz), while the carboxylic acid group remains.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of an O-benzyl hydroxamate**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide): A water-soluble carbodiimide used as a coupling agent to activate the carboxylic acid.\n    *   HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole): An additive that reacts with the EDC-activated acid to form a more stable active ester, which reduces side reactions and racemization.\n    *   Et3N (Triethylamine): A non-nucleophilic organic base used to neutralize acids in the reaction mixture.\n    *   HClÂ·H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): This is the nucleophile that will react with the activated carboxylic acid. The base, Et3N, deprotonates the ammonium salt to release the free O-benzylhydroxylamine (H2N-O-Bn).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an amide coupling reaction. The carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 is activated by EDC/HOBt. The activated acid then reacts with the amine-like nitrogen of O-benzylhydroxylamine to form a new bond. The resulting functional group, -C(=O)NH-O-Bn, is an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. In this molecule, both the original amine and carboxylic acid functionalities are modified with benzyl-containing groups.\n\n**Step 3: Hydrogenolysis for Deprotection**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on Carbon catalyst) and H2 (Hydrogen gas).\n*   **Analysis:** These are standard conditions for catalytic hydrogenolysis. This reaction is highly effective at cleaving C-O bonds where the carbon is benzylic (i.e., part of a -CH2-Ph group). Intermediate 2 has two such groups:\n    1.  The Cbz group on the nitrogen (R-NH-COO-CH2-Ph) is cleaved, which deprotects the amine and regenerates the primary amine (-NH2).\n    2.  The O-benzyl group on the hydroxamate oxygen (R-CO-NH-O-CH2-Ph) is also cleaved. This converts the O-benzyl hydroxamate into a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NH-OH).\n*   **Final Product:** Both benzyl-based protecting groups are removed in this single step. The final product retains the core structure of tryptophan, but the carboxylic acid group has been transformed into a hydroxamic acid group.\n\n**Conclusion: Naming the Product**\n\nThe final product has the structure of the amino acid tryptophan, where the carboxyl group (-COOH) has been replaced by a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH). The systematic IUPAC name for this molecule is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide. However, based on common nomenclature for amino acid derivatives, the product is named by taking the name of the parent amino acid and adding the name of the derived functional group. Thus, the common and widely accepted name for the product is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
