    "*   **Step 1: Initial Observation of the Image.**\n    The image shows a small insect with a distinct coloration resting on a cluster of yellow flowers. The insect is the central subject of the photograph. The background is a soft-focus green and yellow, suggesting a natural outdoor environment.\n\n*   **Step 2: Detailed Analysis of the Insect.**\n    *   **General Morphology:** The animal is an insect, having six legs, a pair of antennae, and a segmented body (head, thorax, abdomen). It belongs to the order Hemiptera, commonly known as \"true bugs,\" which is suggested by its body shape and the appearance of its wings.\n    *   **Coloration and Pattern:** The insect's body is predominantly black. It is marked with conspicuous reddish-orange lines. Specifically, there are orange markings around the edges of the pronotum (the dorsal plate of the thorax, just behind the head). The wings, when folded, also show distinct orange lines along their outer edges. The head is black, and there appear to be small reddish markings near the eyes.\n    *   **Antennae and Legs:** The antennae are long, thin, and black. The legs are also black.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identification of the Host Plant.**\n    The insect is on a plant with dense, plume-like clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. This is characteristic of goldenrod (*Solidago* species), a very common wildflower in North America, especially in late summer and autumn. Insects found on specific plants can often be identified more easily, as many have specific host associations.\n\n*   **Step 4: Species Identification and Verification.**\n    The specific pattern of reddish-orange lines on a black body is a classic identifier for the Boxelder Bug. Although their primary food source and breeding ground are boxelder trees (*Acer negundo*), they also feed on other maples and ash trees. They are known to become migratory in the fall, seeking places to overwinter, and during this time they often gather in large numbers on sunny surfaces and various plants, including goldenrod, to feed on nectar or moisture. Comparing the insect in the image to reference photos of the Boxelder Bug confirms the visual match.\n\n*   **Step 5: Determining the Scientific Name.**\n    Having identified the common name of the insect as the Boxelder Bug, the next step is to find its scientific name. The scientific binomial name for the Boxelder Bug is *Boisea trivittata*. The species name \"*trivittata*\" is Latin for \"three-striped,\" referring to the three red stripes typically found on the pronotum of the insect (though the central one can sometimes be faint or absent).\n\n<<<Boisea trivittata>>>"
