    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the reactants and the overall transformation.**\n    *   The reactants are hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆) and a cyclobutene derivative. Hexafluorobenzene is a 6π-electron aromatic system. The cyclobutene has a 2π-electron system (the double bond).\n    *   The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hv`.\n    *   The product is a complex tricyclic molecule. It appears to be formed by the combination of the two reactant molecules.\n    *   The problem statement specifies that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are involved. This guides the analysis towards a two-step mechanism, where each step is a pericyclic reaction.\n\n2.  **Hypothesize the first pericyclic reaction.**\n    *   Aromatic compounds like benzene and its derivatives can undergo photochemical valence isomerization to form other isomers. A very common photoisomer of benzene is Dewar benzene (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene).\n    *   So, the first step is likely the photoisomerization of hexafluorobenzene to Dewar hexafluorobenzene.\n        C₆F₆ (Hexafluorobenzene) --(hv)--> Dewar-C₆F₆ (Hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene)\n    *   Let's classify this reaction. This transformation is a concerted rearrangement of electrons and is therefore a pericyclic reaction. It can be classified as an **electrocyclic reaction** (a photochemically allowed disrotatory 4π-electron cyclization of a butadiene-like portion of the benzene ring). Alternatively, it is sometimes formally described as an **intramolecular [2π+2π] cycloaddition**. Given the fundamental types of pericyclic reactions, \"electrocyclic reaction\" is a suitable description.\n\n3.  **Analyze the structure of the intermediate, Dewar hexafluorobenzene.**\n    *   Dewar hexafluorobenzene consists of two four-membered rings fused together along a C-C bond. Each four-membered ring contains a double bond, so it can be seen as two cyclobutene rings fused together.\n\n4.  **Hypothesize the second pericyclic reaction.**\n    *   The intermediate, Dewar hexafluorobenzene, reacts with the second reactant, cyclobutene.\n    *   Dewar hexafluorobenzene has two π bonds, and cyclobutene has one π bond. A cycloaddition reaction is a plausible second step.\n    *   The reaction between a π bond of Dewar hexafluorobenzene and the π bond of cyclobutene would be a [2π+2π] cycloaddition.\n        Dewar-C₆F₆ + Cyclobutene --(hv)--> Product\n    *   [2π+2π] cycloadditions are photochemically allowed via a suprafacial-suprafacial pathway. This fits the reaction conditions. Thus, the second reaction is a **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n5.  **Verify the product structure.**\n    *   Let's see if the product of this two-step sequence matches the given product structure.\n    *   The starting Dewar hexafluorobenzene can be seen as two fused four-membered rings (let's call them Ring A and Ring B), each with a double bond.\n    *   The [2+2] cycloaddition of cyclobutene (which becomes Ring C, a cyclobutane) to the double bond of Ring A will saturate that double bond.\n    *   The resulting product will consist of three fused four-membered rings in a linear fashion: Ring B (still a cyclobutene) fused to Ring A (now a cyclobutane) which is fused to Ring C (a cyclobutane).\n    *   This predicted structure, a tricyclo[4.2.0.0²,⁵]decene derivative, perfectly matches the topology of the product shown in the image (a cyclobutene ring fused to a cyclobutane ring, which is in turn fused to another cyclobutane ring). The substituents (F and H atoms) would be located on this tricyclic skeleton. (Note: There might be a discrepancy in the number of H atoms shown in the drawing versus a standard cyclobutene C₄H₆, but this does not affect the identification of the reaction types based on the skeletal transformation).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe two pericyclic reactions involved in the transformation are:\n1.  An **electrocyclic reaction** (the photoisomerization of hexafluorobenzene to Dewar hexafluorobenzene).\n2.  A **[2+2] cycloaddition** (the photochemical reaction between Dewar hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene).\n\n<<<Electrocyclic reaction and [2+2] cycloaddition>>>"
