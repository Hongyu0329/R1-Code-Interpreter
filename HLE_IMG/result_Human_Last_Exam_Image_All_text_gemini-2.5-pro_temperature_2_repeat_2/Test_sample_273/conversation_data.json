    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify Chiral Centers:**\n    The molecule has three chiral centers (stereocenters), which are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. We will analyze them from left to right as they appear in the provided image.\n    *   **C2 (leftmost):** The carbon atom bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a methyl group (-CH3).\n    *   **C3 (middle):** The carbon atom bonded to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).\n    *   **C4 (rightmost):** The carbon atom bonded to a methyl group (-CH3) and an aminoethyl group (-CH2NH2).\n\n2.  **Determine the Absolute Configuration of C2 (the C-OH center):**\n    *   **Groups attached:**\n        a.  -OH (hydroxyl group)\n        b.  -CH(Et)... (the rest of the carbon chain to the right, C3)\n        c.  -CH3 (methyl group)\n        d.  -H (implied hydrogen)\n    *   **Stereochemistry from the drawing:** The bond to -OH is a dash (pointing away). The bond to -CH3 is also a dash. The bond to the C3 group is in the plane of the drawing. For a tetrahedral carbon, the fourth bond, to the implied -H, must be on a wedge (pointing towards the viewer). This is an unusual representation, but it is geometrically plausible.\n    *   **Assign priorities (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Rules):**\n        1.  -OH (Oxygen has atomic number 8)\n        2.  -C3 group (Carbon bonded to C, C, H)\n        3.  -CH3 group (Carbon bonded to H, H, H)\n        4.  -H (Hydrogen has the lowest atomic number)\n    *   **Determine R/S:** The lowest priority group (-H) is pointing towards the viewer (wedge). We trace the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3. This path (-OH -> -C3 -> -CH3) is clockwise (R). Since the lowest priority group is pointing towards us, we reverse the assignment.\n    *   **Conclusion for C2:** The absolute configuration is **S**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Absolute Configuration of C3 (the C-Et center):**\n    *   **Groups attached:**\n        a.  -C2 group (-C(OH)(CH3)...)\n        b.  -C4 group (-C(CH3)(CH2NH2)...)\n        c.  -CH2CH3 (ethyl group)\n        d.  -H (implied hydrogen)\n    *   **Stereochemistry from the drawing:** The bond to the ethyl group is a wedge. The bonds to C2 and C4 are in the plane. Therefore, the bond to the implied -H must be a dash (pointing away).\n    *   **Assign priorities:**\n        1.  -C2 group (the attached carbon is bonded to O, C, H). Oxygen gives this group the highest priority.\n        2.  -C4 group (the attached carbon is bonded to C, C, H).\n        3.  -CH2CH3 group (the attached carbon is bonded to C, H, H). Comparing C4 and Ethyl: C4 is C(C,C,H) while Ethyl is C(C,H,H), so C4 has higher priority.\n        4.  -H\n    *   **Determine R/S:** The lowest priority group (-H) is pointing away (dash). We trace the path 1 -> 2 -> 3. The path (-C2 -> -C4 -> -Et) is counter-clockwise (S). Since the lowest priority group is pointing away, we keep this assignment.\n    *   **Conclusion for C3:** The absolute configuration is **S**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Absolute Configuration of C4 (the C-CH2NH2 center):**\n    *   **Groups attached:**\n        a.  -CH2NH2 (aminoethyl group)\n        b.  -C3 group (-CH(Et)...)\n        c.  -CH3 (methyl group)\n        d.  -H (implied hydrogen)\n    *   **Stereochemistry from the drawing:** The bond to -CH2NH2 is a wedge. The bond to -CH3 is a dash. The bond to C3 is in the plane. To maintain tetrahedral geometry, the implied -H must also lie in the plane.\n    *   **Assign priorities:** We compare the first atom attached to C4 for each group.\n        1.  -CH2NH2: The carbon is attached to a Nitrogen (atomic #7). So C is attached to (N, H, H).\n        2.  -C3 group: The carbon is attached to C(C2), C(ethyl), H. So C is attached to (C, C, H).\n        3.  -CH3 group: The carbon is attached to (H, H, H).\n        4.  -H\n        The priorities are determined by the atoms attached to the carbons of the substituents. Nitrogen (in CH2NH2) outranks carbon (in C3). Carbon (in C3) outranks hydrogen (in CH3). The full priority list is:\n        1.  -CH2NH2\n        2.  -C3 group\n        3.  -CH3\n        4.  -H\n    *   **Determine R/S:** The lowest priority group (-H) is in the plane of the drawing. We can use the \"swap\" method. We swap the positions of the lowest priority group (-H, P4) and the group pointing away (-CH3, P3, on a dash). After the swap, -H is on a dash, and -CH3 is in the plane. Now we determine the configuration for this modified molecule. We view the molecule with the -H pointing away. The path from 1 -> 2 -> 3 is (-CH2NH2 -> -C3 -> -CH3). This traces a counter-clockwise (S) circle. Because we performed one swap, we must reverse this result.\n    *   **Conclusion for C4:** The absolute configuration is **R**.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nFollowing the chain from left to right, the configurations of the three chiral centers are S, S, and R. Adopting a numbering scheme where these carbons are C2, C3, and C4 respectively, the configuration is (2S, 3S, 4R).\n\n<<< (2S, 3S, 4R)>>>"
