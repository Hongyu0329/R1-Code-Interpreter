    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question about the medallion's century:\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Artifact**\nThe image displays a circular object, a medallion, with an attached piece at the top suggesting it might be part of a larger item like a brooch or pendant. The style is embossed or repouss√© metalwork. It features two figures in profile, appearing to face each other. The figure on the left is more distinct, showing stylized hair and features, including what resembles a large, curved ram's horn. The overall impression is one of antique, but not classical Greek or Roman, craftsmanship. It has a powerful, somewhat \"barbaric\" quality typical of a later period.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of the Artifact**\nBy searching for \"medallion with two facing profiles\" or \"gold brooch horned figure,\" the object can be positively identified. This is the famous \"Great Fibula\" (or Eagle Brooch, or Patera) from the **Pietroasa Treasure** (also known as the Petrossa Treasure). This significant gold hoard was discovered in Pietroasele, Romania, in 1837. The medallion in the image is the central decorative element of this very large and elaborate fibula (a type of brooch used to fasten garments).\n\n**Step 3: Determining the Historical Context and Origin**\nArchaeological and historical consensus attributes the Pietroasa Treasure to the Goths, specifically the Tervingi, a Gothic tribe that inhabited the region north of the Danube. The style of the artifacts is a fusion of late Roman provincial craftsmanship and Germanic artistic traditions, which is characteristic of the **Migration Period** (also known as the Barbarian Invasions).\n\n**Step 4: Dating the Artifact**\nScholars have extensively studied the Pietroasa Treasure. The date of its creation and burial is placed in the **late 4th century A.D.** The hoard was likely buried for safekeeping around the time of the Hunnic invasions, which began to affect the Gothic tribes in this region around 376 A.D. Therefore, archaeologists ascribe the fibula to the 4th century A.D. (the period from 301 A.D. to 400 A.D.).\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Object Type:** The piece is not a standalone medallion but the central plate of a very large fibula, a key point for identification.\n*   **Artistic Style:** The style is not purely Roman but a syncretic \"barbarian\" art style, typical for wealthy chieftains of the Migration Period. This helps in dating and attributing the object.\n*   **Dating Precision:** While the object is firmly placed in the 4th century A.D., more precise dating points to the second half of that century. However, the question asks for the century, making \"4th century A.D.\" the correct scope.\n*   **Answer Format:** The question asks for the century, but provides an example answer \"9 A.D.\", which is a specific year, not a century. This suggests an unusual format is required. Interpreting this literally, it seems the format requested is \"[Century Number] A.D.\". For the 4th century, this would translate to \"4 A.D.\".\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer Formulation**\nBased on the archaeological evidence, the fibula belongs to the 4th century A.D. Applying the specific, albeit unusual, format suggested by the example (\"9 A.D.\" for a century), the final answer is derived by taking the century's number.\n\n<<<4 A.D.>>>"
