    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Roman numeral for the circled notes in measure 8.\n\n**1. Identify the Key Signature and Tonic Key**\n*   The key signature at the beginning of the piece has one flat (Bb).\n*   This indicates the key is either F Major or D minor.\n*   The title of the piece is \"Fantasy in D minor,\" which confirms that the home key is D minor. The tonic note is D.\n\n**2. Locate and Identify the Circled Notes**\n*   The question directs us to the notes circled in measure 8. This circle primarily highlights the harmony on the third beat of the measure.\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The notes played on beat 3 are E followed by G-sharp (the sharp accidental is written next to the G).\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** On beat 3, there is a sequence of four sixteenth notes: C-sharp (accidental is written), E, D, and B. The presence of G-sharp and C-sharp suggests a temporary modulation or use of notes from the D melodic minor scale. The B is B-natural, common in this context.\n*   **Combined Notes:** The full set of distinct pitches sounding on beat 3 is E, G#, B, D, and C#.\n\n**3. Determine the Underlying Chord and its Quality**\n*   Let's identify the core harmony from these notes. We can stack them in thirds to find a recognizable chord.\n*   The notes E, G#, B, and D form an **E dominant 7th chord (E7)**.\n    *   Root: E\n    *   Major Third: G#\n    *   Perfect Fifth: B\n    *   Minor Seventh: D\n*   The remaining note, C#, acts as a chromatic non-chord tone (an embellishment). It's a common feature in florid, fantasy-like passages to include such decorations over a clear underlying harmony. The E7 is the structural chord for this beat.\n\n**4. Analyze the Chord's Function in the Key of D minor**\n*   To find the Roman numeral, we must determine the relationship of the chord's root (E) to the home key's tonic (D).\n*   In the key of D minor, the V (dominant) chord is A major (A-C#-E).\n*   The chord we have identified is E7. The chord E major (E-G#-B) is the dominant of A.\n*   Therefore, the E7 chord is functioning as the **dominant of the dominant**.\n\n**5. Determine the Roman Numeral and Inversion**\n*   The Roman numeral for the \"dominant of the dominant\" is written as **V/V**.\n*   Since the chord is a dominant seventh, we add a '7': **V7/V**.\n*   The lowest note of the chord sounding on the beat is E, which is the root of the chord. This means the chord is in **root position**.\n*   So, the accurate and complete Roman numeral for the harmony on beat 3 of measure 8 is V7/V.\n\n<<<V7/V>>>"
