    "This is a piece for solo piano. Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify it:\n\n1.  **Initial Observations:**\n    *   **Instrumentation:** The grand staff indicates it's piano music.\n    *   **Time Signature:** 4/4 common time.\n    *   **Tempo:** A tempo marking of Quarter Note = 80 is given at the beginning.\n    *   **Key Signature:** The initial key signature is one flat (B-flat), which suggests either F major or D minor.\n    *   **Dynamics:** There are sharp contrasts in dynamics, starting with *p* (piano, soft), then jumping to *f* (forte, loud) in measure 3. Later, there are markings for *mp* (mezzo-piano, moderately soft) and *mf* (mezzo-forte, moderately loud).\n\n2.  **Musical Analysis:**\n    *   **Measures 1-2:** The piece begins quietly with a simple melodic line in the right hand over block chords in the left hand. The *ottava* (8--) sign over the right hand in measure 2 indicates it should be played an octave higher than written. The overall mood is calm and introductory.\n    *   **Measure 3 onwards:** There is a dramatic and abrupt change in character. The music becomes loud, fast, and virtuosic. Both hands engage in rapid sixteenth-note arpeggios and broken chords. This kind of sudden shift from a lyrical or slow section to a fast, fiery, and technically demanding passage is a hallmark of the rhapsody form, particularly those by Franz Liszt.\n    *   **Harmony and Texture:** The harmonies are rich and full. The texture starting from measure 3, with arpeggiated figures climbing up in the right hand (G minor, C major, F major, B-flat major) against a rhythmic chordal bass, is very distinctive. The music is highly chromatic, with many accidentals (sharps, flats, and naturals) appearing from measure 4 onwards, indicating frequent key changes and a Romantic-era harmonic language.\n    *   **The \"Friska\" section:** This fast, energetic, and dance-like character is typical of the \"Friska\" (fresh/lively) section that concludes many of Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsodies.\n\n3.  **Identification:**\n    *   The combination of a slow, improvisatory-sounding introduction (or a brief quiet passage) followed by an explosive, virtuosic section filled with brilliant arpeggios is highly characteristic of Franz Liszt's **Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 in C-sharp minor**.\n    *   The passage starting from measure 3 is an unmistakable excerpt from the famous *Friska* section of this piece. While the piece's home key is C-sharp minor, it traverses many different keys, and this excerpt represents one of those sections. This work is one of the most famous pieces in the classical piano repertoire and is widely recognized, partly due to its frequent use in popular culture, most notably in the Tom and Jerry cartoon \"The Cat Concerto\".\n\n<<<Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 by Franz Liszt>>>"
