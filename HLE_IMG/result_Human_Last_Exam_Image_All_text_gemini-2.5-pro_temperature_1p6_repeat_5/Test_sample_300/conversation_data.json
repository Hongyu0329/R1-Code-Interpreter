    "Step-by-step analysis:\nThe task is to identify the author of each of the 9 artworks presented in a 3x3 grid, proceeding from left to right and top to bottom.\n\n1.  **Artwork 1 (Top Left):** This is a figure painting in Chinese ink and color on paper. It depicts women in the traditional attire of a Chinese ethnic minority. The style, characterized by detailed facial features combined with expressive brushwork for the clothing and a somewhat impressionistic background, is highly characteristic of the contemporary artist **Shi Guoliang (史国良)**, who is renowned for his paintings of Tibetan people and other ethnic minorities.\n\n2.  **Artwork 2 (Top Middle):** This is an ink wash painting of a landscape. The style is abstract, using strong, rhythmic lines to depict buildings and trees. This method of abstracting forms from nature into semi-abstract linear and dotted patterns is a hallmark of the modern master **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**. He is famous for integrating Western modernism with Chinese ink painting traditions.\n\n3.  **Artwork 3 (Top Right):** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in cursive script (草书). The text includes lines from the famous Tang dynasty poem \"Spring River Flower Moon Night\". The elegant, flowing, and well-structured style is instantly recognizable as that of **Qi Gong (启功)**, one of the most celebrated calligraphers of the 20th century. His style, often called \"Qi Style\" (启体), is unique and widely admired.\n\n4.  **Artwork 4 (Middle Left):** This is another piece of Chinese calligraphy, in a vigorous running-cursive script (行草). The forceful and dynamic brushstrokes are the signature style of the contemporary artist **Fan Zeng (范曾)**. He is famous for both his painting and calligraphy, which share this powerful and distinctive character. The signature \"范曾\" is also visible on the left.\n\n5.  **Artwork 5 (Middle Center):** This is a realistic oil painting. It portrays a young female artist standing before a large traditional mural. This hyper-realistic style, influenced by European academicism, is a key example of Chinese Realism. The work is a very famous painting titled \"The Artist\" (or \"Painter\") by **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**, a leading figure in the Chinese realist painting movement.\n\n6.  **Artwork 6 (Middle Right):** This is a modern Chinese ink and color portrait of an ethnic minority woman. The style is distinctive, combining fine line drawing for the face with bold ink washes for the hair and clothes, set against a decorative background of birds and leaves. This lyrical and expressive style of figure painting is the signature of **Lin Yong (林墉)**, an artist from Guangdong province famous for his portraits of women.\n\n7.  **Artwork 7 (Bottom Left):** This is a colorful painting depicting a rural courtyard scene with hanging loofah gourds and laundry. The vibrant colors, decorative composition, and focus on the beauty of everyday life are trademarks of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**. He painted numerous works in this style, blending folk art aesthetics with a modern sense of form and color.\n\n8.  **Artwork 8 (Bottom Middle):** This is a Chinese landscape painting (山水画) showing boats on a river amidst towering, dark mountains. The use of heavy, layered ink to create a sense of weight and volume in the mountains, combined with the small, bright red accents of the boat sails, is a classic technique of **Li Keran (李可染)**. He was a master of modern Chinese landscape painting, known for his majestic and powerful compositions.\n\n9.  **Artwork 9 (Bottom Right):** This is an ink wash painting of a single lobster. The artist masterfully uses varying tones of ink and fluid brushwork to capture the creature's translucent shell and lifelike form. The most famous master of painting shrimp, crabs, and other aquatic life in 20th-century China was **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**. This painting of a lobster displays all the hallmarks of his renowned style: simplicity, vitality, and virtuoso brushwork.\n\nFinal list of authors, from left to right, top to bottom:\n1.
