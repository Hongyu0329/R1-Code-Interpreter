    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the full name of the artist who created the painting.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observation:** The image provided is a watercolor painting of a landscape. It depicts a body of water in the foreground, with a shoreline and green, rolling hills in the background.\n\n2.  **Search for Clues in the Painting:** The most crucial clue for identifying an artist is often their signature. Looking at the original image, a signature is visible in the bottom right-hand corner.\n\n3.  **Examine the Cropped Images:** The provided crops help to see details more clearly. One of the crops specifically focuses on the bottom right corner, magnifying the signature.\n\n4.  **Deciphering the Signature:** Upon close inspection of the magnified signature, we can discern a name and a date. The name appears to be \"Picabia\". Following the name, there is a date which reads \"'38\", indicating the year 1938. There is also a word before the name which is harder to read, possibly a dedication or location.\n\n5.  **Researching the Artist:** Based on the surname \"Picabia,\" a search for artists with this name is conducted. This quickly leads to the well-known French avant-garde artist, Francis Picabia.\n\n6.  **Verifying the Artist and Artwork:** Francis Picabia (1879â€“1953) was a significant figure in the Dada and Surrealist movements. During the late 1930s and early 1940s, he produced a series of figurative paintings, including landscapes of the French Riviera, which match the style and subject matter of the painting in question. This specific artwork is often titled \"Paysage\" (Landscape) and is dated to 1938, which perfectly matches the signature.\n\n7.  **Determining the Full Name:** The question asks for the *full name* of the artist. Research shows that his full birth name was Francis-Marie Martinez de Picabia.\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion:** By analyzing the signature on the painting and conducting research, the artist is identified as Francis Picabia. His full name is Francis-Marie Martinez de Picabia.\n\n<<<Francis-Marie Martinez de Picabia>>>"
