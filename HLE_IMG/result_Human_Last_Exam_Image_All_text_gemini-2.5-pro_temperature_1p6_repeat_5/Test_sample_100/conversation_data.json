    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and determine its molecular formula.**\nThe starting material is a complex bicyclic lactam. Let's break it down into its components to determine its molecular formula.\n*   **The core structure:** It appears to be a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one skeleton. This skeleton is composed of:\n    *   Two bridgehead carbons (C1, C4), each with one hydrogen atom.\n    *   A one-carbon bridge (C7), which is a CH2 group.\n    *   A two-carbon bridge containing a double bond (C5=C6), with one hydrogen on each of C5 and C6.\n    *   A three-atom bridge containing the lactam functional group, -N-C(=O)-, connecting the bridgeheads. The nitrogen is C2 and the carbonyl carbon is C3.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   A trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) is attached to the double bond, replacing a hydrogen atom (let's say at C6).\n    *   A p-methoxybenzyl group (PMB) is attached to the nitrogen atom. The PMB group has the formula -CH2-C6H4-OCH3. Its molecular formula is C8H9O.\n*   **Calculating the molecular formula of the starting material:**\n    *   Let's start with the basic 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one skeleton with a hydrogen on the nitrogen (C6H7NO).\n    *   Replace the hydrogen on the nitrogen with a PMB group (C8H9O): C6H(7-1)NO + C8H9O -> C14H15NO2.\n    *   Replace a hydrogen on the double bond (e.g., at C6) with a CF3 group: C14H(15-1)NO2 + CF3 -> C(14+1)H14F3NO2.\n    *   So, the molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction (formation of Intermediate 1).**\n*   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Transformation:** CAN is a standard reagent for the oxidative deprotection of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers and amines. It cleaves the N-PMB bond and replaces the PMB group with a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Change in Molecular Formula:** The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom (H) is added.\n    *   Net change in atoms: -C8, -H(9-1), -O1 => -C8H8O.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 1:**\n    *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   H: 14 - 8 = 6\n    *   F: 3 (unchanged)\n    *   N: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Intermediate 1 has the formula **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction (formation of Intermediate 2).**\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 in MeOH.\n*   **Transformation:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The palladium-on-carbon catalyst with hydrogen gas will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the bicyclic ring to a single bond (C-C). The lactam carbonyl and CF3 group are generally stable under these conditions.\n*   **Change in Molecular Formula:** The reduction of a C=C bond adds two hydrogen atoms (H2).\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 2:**\n    *   Starting with Intermediate 1 (C7H6F3NO) and adding H2.\n    *   C: 7\n    *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 1\n    *   Intermediate 2 has the formula **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third reaction (formation of the final Product).**\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n*   **Transformation:** These conditions (strong acid and heat) cause the hydrolysis of the lactam (a cyclic amide). The amide bond is cleaved by the addition of a water molecule (H2O), opening the ring to form an amino acid. The N-C(=O) bond breaks, yielding an amine (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH).\n*   **Change in Molecular Formula:** The hydrolysis reaction consumes one molecule of water.\n*   **Molecular Formula of the final Product:**\n    *   Starting with Intermediate 2 (C7H8F3NO) and adding H2O.\n    *   C: 7\n    *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   The final product has the formula **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\n**Summary of atom changes:**\n*   Starting Material: C15H14F3NO2\n*   After Step 1 (-C8H8O): C7H6F3NO\n*   After Step 2 (+H2): C7H8F3NO\n*   After Step 3 (+H2O): C7H10F3NO2\n\nThe molecular formula of the final product is C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
