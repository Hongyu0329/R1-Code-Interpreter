The image displays a fungal infection, specifically showing a yeast of the genus *Candida*. The key morphological features observed are: 1) oval-shaped budding yeast cells and 2) elongated filamentous structures known as pseudohyphae, which are chains of budding cells that have failed to detach. This dimorphic presentation (both yeast and pseudohyphae forms) is characteristic of *Candida* species, such as *Candida albicans*.
