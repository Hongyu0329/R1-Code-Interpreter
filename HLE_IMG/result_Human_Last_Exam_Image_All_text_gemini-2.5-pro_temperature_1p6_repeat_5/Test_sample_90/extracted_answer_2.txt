The structures of the three products are as follows:

**Product A:**

      |         |
      C === C --CH2
     /         /
  --N--CH2-CH2
   |      \
  CH2 ----CH -- (CH2)3-NH-Ac
```
To describe this structure more clearly: It is a 2,3,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-pyrrolizine core. At position 1, there is a methyl carboxylate group (`-COOCH3`). At position 7, there is a 3-(acetylamino)propyl side chain (`-CH2CH2CH2NHCOCH3`). There is a double bond between C1 and C2 of the pyrrolizine ring. (Note: A more accurate depiction based on the likely regio/stereochemistry is needed, but this captures the connectivity based on the analysis).
Here is a possible depiction:
A fused 5-5 ring system (pyrrolizine). On one ring, there is a C=C double bond. One carbon of the double bond has a -COOMe group, the other has a hydrogen. The bridgehead nitrogen is attached to a `-CH2CH2CH2NHAc` chain.

**Product B:**
A tetracyclic structure. Specifically, it's (4aS,10aS,10bS)-4a-hydroxy-2-methyl-2,3,4,4a,10a,10b-hexahydro-1H,5H-pyrrolo[1',2':4,5][1,4]diazepino[1,2-a]quinoline-1,5-dione.
It is a complex fused system derived from a domino reaction. The structure contains three rings, a cis-double bond as part of a vinylogous ureide system, and a bridgehead carbon bonded to both N and O.

**Product C:**
A tricyclic lactam. (2S,5'S)-1'-acetyl-5'-methylspiro[pyrrolidine-2,2'-[1,7]naphthyridine]-4',5,6'(1'H,3'H,8'H)-trione.
This structure is a saturated bicyclic system containing three carbonyl groups as indicated by the spectral data, including an N-acetyl group. It is formed via an intramolecular cyclization and acetylation/rearrangement of the starting material.
A simplified representation is: The original pyrrolidine ring is intact with its carboxylic acid (or a methyl ester derivative formed in situ). The pyrroline ring has undergone cyclization with the pyrrolidine part and has been acetylated and rearranged to form a saturated, tricyclic structure containing three carbonyls.

Let's present simplified, more likely structures based on common reaction patterns that fit the provided data.

**Product A (C14H20N2O3):**
A pyrrolizine core with a `COOCH3` group from the cycloaddition. The bridgehead nitrogen is attached to a `CH2CH2CH2NHCOCH3` side chain, which resulted from the ring-opening and acetylation of the original pyrroline substituent.

**Product B (C12H14N2O3):**
A compact, tricyclic structure containing a lactam, another carbonyl, an enone/vinylogous amide `(-CH=CH-C=O)` functionality, and a bridgehead carbon `(-O-C-N-)`.
