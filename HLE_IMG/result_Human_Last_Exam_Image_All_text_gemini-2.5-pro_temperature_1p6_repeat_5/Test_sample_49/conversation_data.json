    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency ($\\omega_c$) of the filter circuit at node $a_0$. The circuit consists of an infinite resistive ladder network and a capacitor $C$. The output is the voltage at node $a_0$ across the capacitor $C$. This configuration forms a low-pass filter.\n\n**2. The Concept of Cutoff Frequency**\nFor a first-order low-pass filter, the voltage transfer function $H(s) = V_{out}(s)/V_{in}(s)$ has a single pole. The cutoff frequency (in radians per second) is determined by the location of this pole and is given by the formula:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\nwhere $R_{th}$ is the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor $C$.\n\n**3. Determine the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we need to calculate the equivalent resistance at the terminals of the capacitor ($a_0$ and $b_0$) with all independent sources in the circuit turned off.\n*   The input is at node `IN`, which is connected to node $c_0$. We assume this is a voltage source referenced to ground ($b_0$).\n*   Turning off the input voltage source means setting its voltage to zero, which effectively connects node $c_0$ to ground.\n*   The capacitor $C$ is connected between nodes $a_0$ and $b_0$ (ground).\n*   Therefore, $R_{th}$ is the resistance seen looking into node $a_0$ with respect to ground, under the condition that node $c_0$ is also grounded.\n\n**4. Analyze the Circuit for $R_{th}$**\nLet's analyze the circuit based on a literal interpretation of the provided diagram.\n*   Node $c_0$ is grounded.\n*   We apply a test voltage $U_0$ at node $a_0$ and calculate the current $I_t$ drawn from the source. Then $R_{th} = U_0 / I_t$.\n*   Let $V_n$ be the voltage at node $c_n$ and $U_n$ be the voltage at node $d_n$ (with $d_0 = a_0$).\n*   We have the boundary conditions: $V_0 = 0$ (since $c_0$ is grounded) and $U_0$ is our test voltage.\n\nBy applying Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at the nodes of the ladder:\n*   KCL at node $a_0 (=d_0)$: The current $I_t$ flows from the test source into $a_0$ and then through the resistor towards $d_1$.\n    $I_t = \\frac{U_0 - U_1}{r}$  (Eq. A)\n*   KCL at node $c_1$: $\\frac{V_1 - V_0}{r} + \\frac{V_1 - V_2}{r} + \\frac{V_1 - U_1}{r} = 0$. Since $V_0=0$, this simplifies to:\n    $3V_1 - V_2 - U_1 = 0$ (Eq. B)\n*   KCL at node $d_1$: $\\frac{U_1 - U_0}{r} + \\frac{U_1 - U_2}{r} + \\frac{U_1 - V_1}{r} = 0$. This gives:\n    $-U_0 + 3U_1 - U_2 - V_1 = 0$ (Eq. C)\n*   For any node $n \\ge 2$, the ladder is uniform, leading to the general difference equations:\n    $V_{n-1} - 3V_n + V_{n+1} + U_n = 0$\n    $U_{n-1} - 3U_n + U_{n+1} + V_n = 0$\n\n**5. Solve the Difference Equations**\nWe look for solutions that decay to zero as $n \\to \\infty$. The decaying solution modes for this type of ladder network are known. We express the voltages for $n \\ge 1$ as a combination of these modes. By analyzing the system in terms of common mode ($S_n=V_n+U_n$) and differential mode ($D_n=V_n-U_n$), we find the decaying solutions are of the form:\n$V_n = \\frac{1}{2}(A + E\\lambda^n)$\n$U_n = \\frac{1}{2}(A - E\\lambda^n)$\nwhere $\\lambda = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$ is the decaying root of the characteristic equation for the differential mode, and A, E are constants. This form is valid for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nNow, we use the boundary equations (B and C) to find A and E.\n1.  Substitute the solution forms into Eq. B ($3V_1 - V_2 - U_1 = 0$). This leads to the condition $A + E = 0$, so $A = -E$.\n2.  Substitute the solution forms into Eq. C (rewritten as $U_0 = 3U_1 - U_2 - V_1$). This, combined with $A = -E$, gives the condition $U_0 = -E$.\n\nSo, we have $E = -U_0$ and $A = -E = U_0$.\n\n**6. Calculate $R_{th}$**\nNow we can find the voltage $U_1$ in terms of $U_0$:\n$U_1 = \\frac{1}{2}(A - E\\lambda) = \\frac{1}{2}(U_0 - (-U_0)\\lambda) = \\frac{U_0}{2}(1 + \\lambda)$\nSubstitute $\\lambda = 2-\\sqrt{3}$:\n$U_1 = \\frac{U_0}{2}(1 + 2 - \\sqrt{3}) = \\frac{U_0}{2}(3 - \\sqrt{3})$\n\nNow use Eq. A to find $R_{th}$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{U_0}{I_t} = \\frac{U_0}{(U_0 - U_1)/r} = \\frac{r}{1 - U_1/U_0}$\n$R_{th} = \\frac{r}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}(3 - \\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2r}{2 - (3 - \\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2r}{-1 + \\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}$\n\nTo simplify, we rationalize the denominator:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\\sqrt{3} - 1)(\\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\n**7. Determine the Cutoff Frequency**\nFinally, we substitute the calculated $R_{th}$ into the formula for the cutoff frequency:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThis is the angular cutoff frequency. If the cutoff frequency in Hertz ($f_c$) was required, it would be $f_c = \\omega_c / (2\\pi)$. The question asks for \"cutoff frequency\", which typically means $\\omega_c$ in this context."
