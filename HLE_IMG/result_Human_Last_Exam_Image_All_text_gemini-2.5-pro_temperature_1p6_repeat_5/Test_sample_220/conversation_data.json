    "*   **Step 1: Understand the question.**\n    The question asks to identify which of the four patterns (A, B, C, D) represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure when viewed along the [110] crystallographic direction.\n\n*   **Step 2: Recall or determine the projected patterns of an FCC lattice along high-symmetry directions.**\n    A crystal lattice looks different when viewed from different directions. The projection of the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane depends on the viewing direction. For an FCC lattice, the projections along the principal directions are well-known:\n    1.  **View along [100] direction:** The projection of the FCC unit cell shows atoms at the four corners of a square and one atom at the very center of the square. When these projected unit cells are tiled to form the lattice pattern, they create a simple square grid of atoms.\n    2.  **View along [111] direction:** The {111} planes in an FCC lattice are the close-packed planes, arranged in an ABCABC... stacking sequence. When viewed from a direction perpendicular to these planes (the [111] direction), the atoms form a hexagonal pattern.\n    3.  **View along [110] direction:** The projection along the [110] direction results in a pattern known as a **centered rectangle**. This means the projected unit cell is a rectangle with atoms at the four corners and an additional atom at the exact center of the rectangle. The aspect ratio of this rectangle (length/width) is sqrt(2):1.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze each image and match it to the known projection patterns.**\n    *   **Image A:** This image shows atoms arranged in a simple rectangular grid (2 columns, 3 rows). This pattern is consistent with the [100] projection of an FCC lattice (which results in a simple square grid, a special case of a rectangular grid).\n    *   **Image D:** This image shows the same rectangular grid pattern as Image A, but with more atoms, suggesting a view through a thicker slice of the crystal. It also corresponds to the [100] projection.\n    *   **Image C:** This image clearly shows a hexagonal pattern. A central atom is surrounded by six other atoms in a hexagon. This is the characteristic projection of an FCC lattice along the [111] direction.\n    *   **Image B:** By process of elimination, this pattern must correspond to the view along the [110] direction. While the perspective drawing makes it difficult to perfectly trace the centered rectangular cells, its appearance is distinct from the simple rectangular grid of A/D and the hexagonal pattern of C. It is the only option consistent with the expected centered rectangular pattern for the [110] view. A close look reveals atoms that could form rectangles with other atoms in their centers (e.g., the atom at approximately (4, 5.5) appears to be a center atom for a rectangle defined by atoms like (1, 5) and (7, 5)).\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the analysis.**\n    Based on the standard projections of an FCC crystal:\n    *   A/D = [100] view (simple rectangular/square pattern)\n    *   C = [111] view (hexagonal pattern)\n    *   B = [110] view (centered rectangular pattern)\n    Therefore, image B represents a face-centered cubic structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
