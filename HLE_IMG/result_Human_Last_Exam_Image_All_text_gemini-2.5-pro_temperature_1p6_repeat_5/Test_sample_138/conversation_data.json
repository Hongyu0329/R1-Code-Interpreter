    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\nThe goal is to determine the biological sexes (Male or Female) for the two insects in each pair labeled A, B, and C. The key information provided is that these are pollinators from taxa without scopae on their legs, and both sexes feed on nectar. Scopae are dense pollen-collecting hairs on the hind legs of many female bees. Their absence is a critical clue.\n\n**General Principles of Sex Determination in Bees and Wasps:**\n*   **Antennae:** Males often have longer antennae with more segments (e.g., 13 in most bees/wasps) than females (12 segments). In some wasps, male antennae are curled at the tip.\n*   **Abdomen Tip:** A female's abdomen ends in a stinger (modified ovipositor) and typically has 6 visible segments. A male's abdomen lacks a stinger, often has a more rounded or specialized tip with claspers, and typically has 7 visible segments.\n*   **Facial Markings:** Males of many bee and wasp species have yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus), which are absent or different in females.\n*   **Pollen Collection:** Only females collect pollen to provision nests. The problem states these taxa lack leg scopae, so we might look for abdominal scopae (pollen-carrying hairs on the underside of the abdomen, typical of Megachilidae) or consider kleptoparasitic bees whose females don't collect pollen at all.\n\n**Analysis of Pair A:**\n*   **Insects:** These are Cuckoo Bees, likely from the genus *Coelioxys*. These bees are kleptoparasites (they lay eggs in the nests of other bees), so the females do not have scopae for pollen collection, fitting the description.\n*   **Left Insect (A-left):** The abdomen is long and tapers to a single, sharp point. This cone-shaped abdomen is characteristic of a female *Coelioxys*, which uses it to pierce the host bee's nest cell to lay an egg. This is a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Right Insect (A-right):** The abdomen is not sharply pointed. Instead, the tip has multiple spines or prongs. This multi-pronged abdominal tip is a key feature of a male *Coelioxys*. This is a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The pair is Female, Male (F, M). This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair B:**\n*   **Insects:** These are Paper Wasps, likely from the genus *Polistes*. Wasps do not have scopae for pollen collection.\n*   **Left Insect (B-left):** The antennae are relatively short and straight. The tip is not curled. This is characteristic of a female paper wasp. This is a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Right Insect (B-right):** The antennae are noticeably curled or hooked at the tips. This is a classic and reliable feature for identifying male *Polistes* wasps. This is a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The pair is Female, Male (F, M). This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair C:**\n*   **Insects:** This pair shows two different-looking bees, illustrating sexual dimorphism. The \"no leg scopae\" rule applies to the individuals shown.\n*   **Left Insect (C-left):** This bee has two definitive male characteristics: 1) Very long antennae, which is why its group is called \"long-horned bees\" (tribe Eucerini). 2) A yellow or cream-colored patch on its face (clypeus). Male bees do not have scopae. This is a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Right Insect (C-right):** This bee has short antennae, unlike the male on the left. It has broad, distinct bands of yellowish hair on its abdomen. To fit the \"no leg scopae\" rule for a female, it could be a leafcutter bee (family Megachilidae). Female leafcutter bees carry pollen using an \"abdominal scopa\" (dense hairs on the underside of the abdomen), not on their legs. The overall build, short antennae, and lack of male facial markings point to this individual being a female. This is a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** The pair is Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   Pair A: F, M → Index 4\n*   Pair B: F, M → Index 4\n*   Pair C: M, F → Index 3\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of these indices separated by commas.\n\n<<<4,4,3>>>"
