**Product A:** The structure is methyl 4-(1-acetyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-2,3,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-pyrrolizine-7-carboxylate. It is a fused bicyclic (pyrrolizine) system formed via a [3+2] cycloaddition. The nitrogen is substituted with an N-acetylated dihydropyrrole ring, and the newly formed ring contains a methoxycarbonyl group.

**Product B:** The structure is 1-(4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic propiolic anhydride. It is a mixed anhydride where the carboxylic acid of the starting material has reacted with methyl propiolate, eliminating methanol. The resulting functional group is -CO-O-CO-Câ‰¡CH.

**Product C:** The structure is 1-(1-acetyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid. It is formed by the reaction of the imine in the starting material's substituent with acetic anhydride, resulting in an N-acetylated enamine structure, while the proline-carboxylic acid core remains intact.
