The high regioselectivity observed in Reaction 3 is due to the formation of a single, stable munchone intermediate that cannot undergo the facile isomerization seen in Reactions 1 and 2. In Reaction 3, the starting material, N-acetylproline, forms a munchone where the C2 substituent is a methyl group and the C4 substituent is a methine locked within a fused ring. The potential rearranged isomer would be significantly higher in energy due to increased ring strain, so no equilibration occurs. This locked intermediate then proceeds to a single cycloaddition product. Reactions 1 and 2 provide the rationale for this conclusion by demonstrating that when the C2 and C4 substituents are energetically similar (both are methyl groups), they exist in a rapid 1:1 equilibrium, leading to scrambling of the labels and an apparent lack of regioselectivity. Therefore, the regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is a direct consequence of the proline ring's structure preventing the isomerization of the key dipolar intermediate.
