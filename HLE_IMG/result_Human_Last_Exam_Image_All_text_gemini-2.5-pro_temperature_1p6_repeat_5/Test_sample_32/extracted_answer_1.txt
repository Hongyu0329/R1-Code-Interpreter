The main difference in the sporophyte that distinguishes *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the shape of the seta (the stalk) and the orientation of the capsule. In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule in an erect position. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a seta that is strongly curved or swan-necked (cygneous), causing the capsule to be nodding or to hang downwards (pendent).
