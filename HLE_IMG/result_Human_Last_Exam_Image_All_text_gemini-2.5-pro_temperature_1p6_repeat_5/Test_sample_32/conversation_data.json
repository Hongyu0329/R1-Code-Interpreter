    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the distinguishing features between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The question asks for the main, most easily observable (\"at a glance\") difference in the **sporophyte** of two moss species: *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. The sporophyte in mosses consists of the foot (which attaches to the leafy plant), the seta (stalk), and the capsule (which contains the spores).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Name *Grimmia curviseta*:** A crucial clue is often in the scientific name. The specific epithet \"*curviseta*\" is Latin for \"curved seta\". This strongly suggests that a curved seta is a key characteristic of this species.\n\n3.  **Research the Sporophyte of *Grimmia montana*:** Botanical descriptions and floras note that *Grimmia montana* has a sporophyte characterized by a **short, straight seta**. Because the seta is straight and relatively short, the capsule is held **erect** and is often immersed among the upper leaves or just barely emergent above them. The capsules in the provided image, being erect and sitting low in the moss cushion, are consistent with the appearance of *Grimmia montana*.\n\n4.  **Research the Sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta*:** As its name implies, *Grimmia curviseta* is defined by its sporophyte. It possesses a **distinctly curved or cygneous (swan-necked) seta**, especially when moist. This curvature causes the capsule to be **cernuous (nodding) or pendent (hanging downwards)**, rather than erect.\n\n5.  **Compare the Two Sporophytes:**\n    *   ***Grimmia montana***: Seta is **straight** -> Capsule is **erect**.\n    *   ***Grimmia curviseta***: Seta is **curved/cygneous** -> Capsule is **nodding/pendent**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion on the Main Difference:** The most significant and visually immediate difference between the sporophytes of the two species is the **shape of the seta and the resulting orientation of the capsule**. This is not a subtle microscopic detail but a macroscopic feature that allows for identification at a glance when the plants are fertile.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Focus on the Sporophyte:** The question specifically asks about the sporophyte, not the gametophyte (the leafy green part), although the two species can be difficult to distinguish by leaves alone.\n*   **Fertility is Key:** This distinguishing feature is only present when the moss has produced sporophytes. Sterile patches cannot be identified using this characteristic.\n*   **Moisture Level:** The curvature of the seta in *Grimmia curviseta* is most pronounced when the plant is moist. When dry, the seta can straighten somewhat, but it usually retains a noticeable bend, unlike the consistently straight seta of *G. montana*.\n*   **Synonymy:** Note that *Grimmia curviseta* is now often placed in a different genus, as *Codriophorus curvisetus*, but the distinguishing characteristic remains the same regardless of its generic placement.\n\n<<<The main difference in the sporophyte that distinguishes *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the shape of the seta (the stalk) and the orientation of the capsule. In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule in an erect position. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a seta that is strongly curved or swan-necked (cygneous), causing the capsule to be nodding or to hang downwards (pendent)."
