    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure and identify chiral centers.**\n\nFirst, we need to correctly interpret the line-angle formula of the molecule. The most common convention for such drawings is to assume the main carbon chain is represented by the zig-zag backbone. The substituents are attached to this chain with wedges (pointing out of the page) or dashes (pointing into the page). If only one substituent's stereochemistry is shown on a carbon, the implicit hydrogen atom is assumed to be on the opposite side (e.g., if a group is wedged, the H is dashed).\n\n1.  **Identify the main functional group and the longest carbon chain.** The principal functional group is the amine (-NH2). According to IUPAC nomenclature, we should number the longest carbon chain containing the carbon attached to the amine group to give it the lowest possible number.\n    *   The group on the right is -CH₂NH₂. The carbon in this group is **C1**.\n    *   C1 is attached to a carbon with a dashed methyl group. This is **C2**.\n    *   C2 is attached to a carbon with a wedged ethyl group. This is **C3**.\n    *   C3 is attached to a carbon with a wedged hydroxyl group. This is **C4**.\n    *   C4 is attached to a terminal methyl group (the end of the line on the far left). This is **C5**.\n    *   The IUPAC name skeleton is **4-hydroxy-3-ethyl-2-methylpentan-1-amine**.\n\n2.  **Identify the chiral centers.** A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   **C1** (-CH₂NH₂) is bonded to two hydrogens, so it is not chiral.\n    *   **C2** is bonded to C1(-CH₂NH₂), C3(-CH(Et)-...), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a hydrogen (-H). These are four different groups, so **C2 is a chiral center**.\n    *   **C3** is bonded to C2(-CH(Me)-...), C4(-CH(OH)-...), an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), and a hydrogen (-H). These are four different groups, so **C3 is a chiral center**.\n    *   **C4** is bonded to C3(-CH(Et)-...), C5(-CH₃), a hydroxyl group (-OH), and a hydrogen (-H). These are four different groups, so **C4 is a chiral center**.\n    *   **C5** (-CH₃) is bonded to three hydrogens, so it is not chiral.\n\nWe have three chiral centers: C2, C3, and C4. We need to determine the absolute configuration (R or S) for each.\n\n**Step 2: Assign priorities to substituents on each chiral center (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Rules).**\n\n**For Chiral Center C2:**\n*   **Substituents:** -CH₂NH₂, -CH(Et)CH(OH)CH₃ (C3-group), -CH₃, and -H.\n*   **Priorities:**\n    1.  **-CH₂NH₂**: The carbon (C1) is attached to a Nitrogen (atomic number 7). Let's represent this as C-(N, H, H).\n    2.  **-CH(Et)CH(OH)CH₃**: The carbon (C3) is attached to two other carbons and a hydrogen. C-(C, C, H).\n    3.  **-CH₃**: The carbon is attached to three hydrogens. C-(H, H, H).\n    4.  **-H**: Lowest priority.\n    Comparing the first point of difference, N > C > H. Thus, the priorities are:\n    1.  -CH₂NH₂\n    2.  -CH(Et)CH(OH)CH₃\n    3.  -CH₃\n    4.  -H\n\n**For Chiral Center C3:**\n*   **Substituents:** -CH(OH)CH₃ (C4-group), -CH(CH₃)CH₂NH₂ (C2-group), -CH₂CH₃ (ethyl), and -H.\n*   **Priorities:** All are connected via carbon. We look at the atoms attached to these carbons.\n    1.  **-CH(OH)CH₃**: The carbon (C4) is attached to an Oxygen, a Carbon, and a Hydrogen. C-(O, C, H).\n    2.  **-CH(CH₃)CH₂NH₂**: The carbon (C2) is attached to two Carbons and a Hydrogen. C-(C, C, H).\n    3.  **-CH₂CH₃**: The carbon of the ethyl group is attached to one Carbon and two Hydrogens. C-(C, H, H).\n    4.  **-H**: Lowest priority.\n    Comparing the lists of attached atoms (sorted by atomic number), (O, C, H) > (C, C, H) > (C, H, H). Thus, the priorities are:\n    1.  -CH(OH)CH₃\n    2.  -CH(CH₃)CH₂NH₂\n    3.  -CH₂CH₃\n    4.  -H\n\n**For Chiral Center C4:**\n*   **Substituents:** -OH, -CH(Et)CH(Me)CH₂NH₂ (C3-group), -CH₃ (C5), and -H.\n*   **Priorities:**\n    1.  **-OH**: Oxygen has a higher atomic number (8) than carbon (6). Highest priority.\n    2.  **-CH(Et)CH(Me)CH₂NH₂**: Attached via carbon.\n    3.  **-CH₃**: Attached via carbon.\n    4.  **-H**: Lowest priority.\n    To distinguish between the two carbon groups, we see that the C3-group is a larger chain (-C-C-...) while the -CH₃ group is terminal. Therefore, the C3-group has higher priority. The final priorities are:\n    1.  -OH\n    2.  -CH(Et)CH(Me)CH₂NH₂\n    3.  -CH₃\n    4.  -H\n\n**Step 3: Determine the R/S configuration for each chiral center.**\n\n**Configuration at C2:**\n*   The substituents are arranged as: -CH₃ is dashed (away), so the implicit -H must be wedged (towards us).\n*   The lowest priority group (-H, priority 4) is pointing towards us.\n*   Trace the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3: -CH₂NH₂ → C3-group → -CH₃. This path is counter-clockwise (CCW).\n*   Because the lowest priority group is pointing towards us, we reverse the assignment. CCW (S) becomes **R**.\n*   **Configuration at C2 is R.**\n\n**Configuration at C3:**\n*   The substituents are arranged as: -CH₂CH₃ is wedged (towards us), so the implicit -H must be dashed (away).\n*   The lowest priority group (-H, priority 4) is pointing away from us, which is the standard orientation for assignment.\n*   Trace the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3: C4-group → C2-group → -CH₂CH₃. This path is clockwise (CW).\n*   Because the lowest priority group is pointing away, we keep the assignment.\n*   **Configuration at C3 is R.**\n\n**Configuration at C4:**\n*   The substituents are arranged as: -OH is wedged (towards us), so the implicit -H must be dashed (away).\n*   The lowest priority group (-H, priority 4) is pointing away from us.\n*   Trace the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3: -OH → C3-group → -CH₃. This path is counter-clockwise (CCW).\n*   Because the lowest priority group is pointing away, we keep the assignment.\n*   **Configuration at C4 is S.**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Correct interpretation of the drawing:** This is the most critical step. Assuming the standard convention for zig-zag chains with wedge/dash bonds is essential.\n2.  **Accurate IUPAC numbering:** This ensures the final configuration is assigned to the correct carbon atom (e.g., 2R, not 4R).\n3.  **Rigorous application of CIP rules:** Errors in priority assignment are common. It's important to compare atoms layer by layer until a point of difference is found.\n4.  **Correctly determining R/S based on the orientation of the lowest priority group:** Remember to reverse the result (S↔R) if the lowest priority group points towards the viewer.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   The chiral center at position C2 has an **R** configuration.\n*   The chiral center at position C3 has an **R** configuration.\n*   The chiral center at position C4 has an **S** configuration.\n\nCombining these results, the absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3R, 4S).\n\n<<<2R, 3R, 4S>>>"
