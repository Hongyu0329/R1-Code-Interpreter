    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Plant in the Image**\nThe first step is to identify the plant shown in the picture. The most striking characteristic is its leaves. The leaves are dark green, ovate to elliptical in shape, and feature a very distinct and intricate network of sunken, lighter-colored (white or pale green) veins. This pattern is often described as reticulated or looking like a spiderweb. The leaves appear to be arranged oppositely or in whorls on the stem. This unique leaf venation is a key identifier. A search for plants with these features leads to the identification of *Debregeasia healeana*, a rare flowering plant.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Question**\nThe question asks for the name of the island to which this plant was endemic. \"Endemic\" means that a species is exclusively found in a specific geographic area and nowhere else in the world.\n\n**Step 3: Research the Native Habitat of *Debregeasia healeana***\nNow that the plant is identified as *Debregeasia healeana* (common name: *Maʻoloa* or Gaudichaud's debregeasia), we need to find its native range. Researching this species in botanical databases and conservation resources reveals the following:\n*   *Debregeasia healeana* is a member of the nettle family (Urticaceae).\n*   It is native to the Hawaiian Islands.\n*   The species is listed as federally endangered.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the Specific Island of Endemism**\nWhile the plant is from the Hawaiian Islands, the term \"endemic\" often applies to a more specific location within an archipelago. More detailed sources, such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the \"Manual of the Flowering Plants of Hawaiʻi,\" specify that *Debregeasia healeana* is historically and currently known only from a single island. This island is Kauaʻi. The plant grows in the wet forests of Kauaʻi's mountains.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Visual Identification:** The unique reticulated leaf pattern is the single most important clue. Misidentifying the plant would lead to an incorrect answer.\n*   **Definition of \"Endemic\":** Understanding that endemic means native and restricted to a particular location is crucial.\n*   **Specificity:** The question asks for \"the island\" (singular), suggesting the plant is not endemic to the entire Hawaiian chain but to one specific island.\n*   **Reliable Sources:** Information about the native range of rare and endangered species should be cross-referenced with reliable sources like government conservation agencies, university herbaria, or major botanical gardens.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently conclude that the plant is *Debregeasia healeana* and it is endemic to the island of Kauaʻi.\n\n<<<Kauaʻi>>>"
