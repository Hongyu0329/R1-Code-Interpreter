    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The image shows a drawing of a cuneiform sign. Cuneiform writing was developed by the ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia. This specific writing style uses wedge-shaped marks, typically impressed on clay tablets. The image is a line drawing of such a sign.\n\n2.  **Identify the Form:** The sign has a clear structure. It consists of a lower rectangular part with internal lines suggesting a floor plan, and an upper triangular part resembling a gabled roof. This visual structure strongly suggests a pictographic origin representing a building.\n\n3.  **Trace the Sign's Origin and Evolution:** This sign is the Sumerian logogram **Ã‰**. In its earliest pictographic form (late 4th millennium BC), it was a simple rectangle representing the floor plan of a house. By the third millennium BC (the period specified in the question, such as the Early Dynastic or Ur III periods), it had evolved into the more stylized form seen in the image, but it still retained the recognizable features of a building.\n\n4.  **Determine the Meaning:** The Sumerian word **Ã‰** translates directly to \"house\" or \"temple.\" A temple was considered the \"house of a god.\" Therefore, the core meaning of this sign is a dwelling or a significant building.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A. Tool:** Signs for tools were typically pictographs of those specific tools (e.g., a plow, a sickle). This sign does not resemble a tool.\n    *   **B. Guard:** The cuneiform sign for \"guard\" (EN.NUN) has a different structure.\n    *   **C. Bread:** The sign for bread (NINDA) typically looked like a ration bowl or a specific shape of loaf. It is different from the sign shown.\n    *   **D. Home:** This is a synonym for \"house,\" which is the primary meaning of the sign **Ã‰**. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **E. Deity:** The sign for a deity (DINGIR) is a star-like symbol (ð’€­) and looks very different.\n    *   **F. Beard:** The sign for a beard (SU) was part of a pictograph of a human head and does not look like this sign.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The sign shown is the third-millennium form of the Sumerian logogram **Ã‰**, which means \"house\" or \"temple.\" Among the given options, \"Home\" is the most accurate meaning.\n\n<<<D>>>"
