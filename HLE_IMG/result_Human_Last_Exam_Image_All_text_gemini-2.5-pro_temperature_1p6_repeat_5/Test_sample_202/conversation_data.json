    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Specimen H**\n*   **Observation:** Specimen H is a reddish-brown rock with a rough surface. It is covered in numerous small holes or cavities. These holes are called vesicles. The overall rock texture where crystals are not visible to the naked eye is called aphanitic.\n*   **Interpretation:** The vesicles indicate that gas bubbles were trapped within the lava as it cooled and solidified. This vesicular texture is characteristic of extrusive (volcanic) igneous rocks that cooled quickly at the Earth's surface. The reddish color is often due to the oxidation of iron-rich minerals.\n*   **Identification:** A reddish, highly vesicular, aphanitic volcanic rock is known as **scoria**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Specimen I**\n*   **Observation:** Specimen I is composed of many sharp, angular fragments (clasts) of different rocks cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. The clasts vary in color (gray, reddish) and size.\n*   **Interpretation:** A rock made of cemented fragments is a clastic rock. When the fragments are angular rather than rounded, the rock is called a breccia. Since the other specimens (H and J) are volcanic, it's highly probable that this is a **volcanic breccia**, formed from the accumulation of angular rock fragments ejected during an explosive volcanic eruption.\n*   **Identification:** The rock is a **breccia**, more specifically, a **volcanic breccia**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Specimen J**\n*   **Observation:** Specimen J is a light-colored (white to light gray) rock that is also highly vesicular, similar to specimen H. It appears very porous and lightweight, almost frothy. The texture is aphanitic.\n*   **Interpretation:** Like scoria, this rock is a vesicular, extrusive igneous rock. However, its very light color indicates a felsic (silica-rich) composition. The extremely high porosity and low density are key characteristics.\n*   **Identification:** A light-colored, frothy, vesicular volcanic rock is called **pumice**. It is often so light that it can float on water.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Specimen K**\n*   **Observation:** Specimen K is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. This coarse-grained texture is called phaneritic. The crystals are of different minerals, identifiable by their colors: light-colored minerals (white, translucent, or pinkish) and dark, greenish-black minerals. The crystals are exceptionally large.\n*   **Interpretation:** The large crystal size indicates that the rock cooled very slowly, deep beneath the Earth's surface. This is characteristic of an intrusive (plutonic) igneous rock. The mineral assemblage of light-colored minerals (likely quartz and feldspar) and dark minerals (like hornblende or biotite mica) is typical of granite. However, the term for an igneous rock with exceptionally large crystals (typically over 1 cm) is pegmatite.\n*   **Identification:** Due to its very coarse-grained texture, this rock is identified as a **pegmatite**.\n\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Volcanic Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Pegmatite\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Volcanic Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite>>>"
