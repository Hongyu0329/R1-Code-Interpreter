    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of splice species.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe goal is to identify all unique mRNA splice species revealed by the different RT-PCR experiments and count them. A splice species is defined by a unique combination of spliced exons and its termination point (early at A<sub>E</sub> or late at A<sub>L</sub>).\n\n**Careful Points & Analysis Strategy:**\n1.  **Primer Specificity:** The primers `E1F2` and `E1F3` are crucial as they are \"splice-junction specific.\" `E1F2` only amplifies transcripts with the `E1^E4` splice (`929^3465`), and `E1F3` only amplifies those with the `E1^E5` splice (`929^3506`).\n2.  **Early vs. Late Transcripts:** The reverse primers determine which group of transcripts is amplified. `E4R`, `E5R`, and `L2R` amplify early transcripts (terminating at A<sub>E</sub>). `L1R` amplifies late transcripts (terminating at A<sub>L</sub>). An early and a late transcript are different species even if their 5' splicing is identical.\n3.  **Cross-Panel Correlation:** A single splice species can be detected in multiple experiments with different primer pairs, producing bands of different sizes. We must trace each species across the panels to avoid double-counting.\n4.  **Counting Unique Bands:** Each distinct band within a lane for a given primer pair represents at least one unique splice pattern between those primer sites. The most comprehensive panel for a given transcript type (e.g., Panel I for late transcripts) should be used as the primary source for counting.\n\n**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**\n\n**Step 1: Identify and Count Late Splice Species (Panel H & I)**\n*   **Primer Pair:** `E1F1/L1R` specifically amplifies late transcripts.\n*   **Analysis:** Panel H (20 cycles) shows 2 bands (450 bp, 419 bp). Panel I, run with more PCR cycles (30), is more sensitive and reveals two additional, less abundant transcripts. Panel I shows a total of four distinct bands.\n*   **Bands:** 450 bp, 419 bp, 378 bp, and 187 bp.\n*   **Conclusion:** Each of these four bands represents a unique late splice species.\n*   **Count:** **4 species**\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Count `E1^E5` Spliced Early Species (Panel G)**\n*   **Primer Pair:** `E1F3/L2R`. `E1F3` is specific for the `E1^E5` splice junction. `L2R` confirms these are early transcripts.\n*   **Analysis:** Panel G shows two distinct bands.\n*   **Bands:** Band 1 (1,003 bp) and band 2 (931 bp).\n*   **Conclusion:** These two bands represent two different splice species that both contain the `E1^E5` splice but differ in their splicing pattern between E5 and L2. These are distinct from the late species.\n*   **Count:** **2 species**\n\n**Step 3: Identify and Count `E1^E4` Spliced Early Species (Panels B, C, D, E, F)**\n*   **Primer Pairs:** We use the `E1F2`-containing reactions (`E1F2/E5R` in D, `E1F2/L2R` in F) to specifically track this species.\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   Panel F (`E1F2/L2R`) shows one band (972 bp). This confirms the existence of a single species with the `E1^E4` splice that extends to L2.\n    *   We can trace this single species through the other panels:\n        *   It corresponds to the 1,005 bp band in Panel E (`E1F1/L2R`).\n        *   It corresponds to the 551 bp band in Panel D (`E1F2/E5R`) and the 553 bp band (band 2) in Panel C (`E1F1/E5R`).\n        *   It corresponds to the 159 bp band (band 2) in Panel B (`E1F1/E4R`).\n*   **Conclusion:** All these bands—B2, C2, D, E, and F—represent the detection of a single, coherent splice species that has the `E1^E4` splice and extends to L2.\n*   **Count:** **1 species**\n\n**Step 4: Identify Other Early Species (Panels B & C)**\n*   **Analysis:** We have accounted for band 2 in both panels B and C. We now look at band 1 in those panels.\n    *   Panel B shows band 1 at 190 bp.\n    *   Panel C shows band 1 at 584 bp.\n    *   This species does *not* contain the specific `E1^E4` (`929^3465`) splice, as it's not detected by the `E1F2` primer. It represents an alternative splice pattern in the E1-E4 region.\n    *   In Panel E (`E1F1/L2R`), we only see one band (1,005 bp), which we already assigned to the species from Step 3. The absence of a second band suggests this new species (B1/C1) does not extend to the L2R primer binding site, likely terminating at A<sub>E</sub>.\n*   **Conclusion:** Band 1 in panels B and C represents a distinct early splice species, different from all others identified so far.\n*   **Count:** **1 species**\n\n**Step 5: Final Tally**\nTo find the total number of splice species, we sum the counts from each distinct category:\n*   From late transcripts (Step 1): 4 species\n*   From `E1^E5` early transcripts (Step 2): 2 species\n*   From `E1^E4` early transcript (Step 3): 1 species\n*   From other early transcript (Step 4): 1 species\n\n**Total = 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 8**\n\nThere are a total of 8 distinct splice species identified in this image.\n\n<<<8>>>"
