**Product A** is N-acetylproline amide: A pyrrolidine ring with an acetyl group on the nitrogen atom (N1) and a primary amide group (-CONH₂) on the adjacent carbon (C2).

**Product B** is tetrahydro-3H-pyrrolizin-3-one: A bicyclic structure with two five-membered rings fused together that share a common nitrogen atom. One of the rings contains a ketone group at position 3 (a lactam).

**Product C** is 1-acetyl-2-acetylpyrrolidine: A pyrrolidine ring with an acetyl group on the nitrogen atom (N1) and another acetyl group on the adjacent carbon atom (C2).
