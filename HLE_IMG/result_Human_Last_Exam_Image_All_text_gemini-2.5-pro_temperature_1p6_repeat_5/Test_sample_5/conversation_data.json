    "This is a piece for solo piano. Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the music:\n\n1.  **Initial Observations:**\n    *   **Instrumentation:** The music is written on a grand staff (treble and bass clefs joined), which is standard for piano music.\n    *   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4 (indicated by the 'C' for common time).\n    *   **Key Signature:** There are two sharps in the key signature, F# and C#. This indicates the key of D major or its relative minor, B minor. Looking at the chords and overall mood (e.g., the B minor chord at the start of measure 4), the piece is firmly in **B minor**.\n    *   **Tempo:** The tempo marking is `♩ = 80`, which is a moderately paced Andante.\n\n2.  **Structural and Stylistic Analysis:**\n    *   **Form and Contrast:** The most striking feature is the extreme contrast in dynamics and texture. The piece begins quietly (`p` - piano) with a lyrical, somber melody in the right hand over sustained chords in the left hand (measures 1-2).\n    *   **Sudden Outburst:** In measure 3, the music erupts suddenly and loudly (`f` - forte) into a completely different texture. Both hands are engaged in rapid, continuous sixteenth-note passagework.\n    *   **Texture in the Loud Section:** The texture from measure 3 onwards is highly virtuosic. The right hand plays ascending arpeggios, while the left hand plays descending broken chords. This creates a powerful, turbulent, and full sound characteristic of late-Romantic piano music.\n    *   **Harmonic Language:** The harmony is rich and chromatic. For instance, the move from the quiet opening to the chord in measure 3 (a C# diminished seventh chord, which functions as the leading-tone chord to D) is very dramatic. The progression through measures 8-10 features a characteristic descending chromatic bass line (B -> Bb -> A).\n\n3.  **Identifying the Composer and Piece:**\n    *   The combination of a dark, brooding key (B minor), a lyrical melodic style, massive piano textures, and extreme dynamic shifts strongly points towards the composer **Sergei Rachmaninoff**. He is famous for this kind of writing.\n    *   Considering the specific features—the B minor key, the quiet two-bar \"return\" theme, and the immediate explosion into arpeggiated figures—this is unmistakably his **Prelude in B minor, Op. 32, No. 10**. This prelude is famous for its depiction of a return home, with the quiet opening bars representing the main theme, followed by the dramatic development section depicting the journey or inner turmoil.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe sheet music is from Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in B minor, Op. 32, No. 10.\n\n<<<Sergei Rachmaninoff - Prelude in B minor, Op. 32, No. 10>>>"
