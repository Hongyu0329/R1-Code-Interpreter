The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **V-C1-C2 domains of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE)**.

This protein could be used as a **prognostic marker** for neurological disorders. According to the diagram, S100B binding to RAGE directly initiates signaling cascades (JNK/JUN, NFÎºB) that lead to key pathological outcomes, including neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Since S100B actively drives the mechanisms of disease progression, its expression level can predict the future severity and course of the disorder. A higher concentration of S100B would suggest a more aggressive disease progression and, therefore, a poorer prognosis. While it might be used adjunctively due to its presence in other diseases, its primary value lies in its ability to predict the outcome of the pathology, which defines it as a prognostic marker.
