    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the molecule and the groups in question:**\n    The image shows a cationic Iridium(III) coordination complex. It has three bidentate ligands forming an octahedral geometry around the central Ir³⁺ ion. We are asked to determine which of the peripheral phenyl rings, labeled G, H, J, K, and L, can rotate freely.\n\n2.  **Define \"Free Rotation\":**\n    Free rotation refers to the rotation of a group around a single bond (a sigma bond). In reality, there is always an energy barrier to rotation. \"Free\" rotation implies that this barrier is low enough to be easily overcome at room temperature, allowing for rapid rotation on the human or NMR timescale. Rotation can be restricted or prevented by steric hindrance, where the rotating group would physically clash with other parts of the molecule.\n\n3.  **Determine the attachment points of each phenyl ring:**\n    We need to carefully examine the drawing to see where each phenyl ring (G, H, J, K, L) is connected to the main ligand framework.\n    *   **Ring G:** A line connects it to position C3 of pyridine ring F.\n    *   **Ring H:** A line connects it to position C4 of phenyl ring A.\n    *   **Ring J:** A line connects it to position C4 of phenyl ring C.\n    *   **Ring K:** A line connects it to position C5 of phenyl ring A.\n    *   **Ring L:** A line connects it to position C5 of phenyl ring C.\n\n4.  **Analyze the steric environment for each ring to assess its rotational freedom:**\n\n    *   **Rings K and L:**\n        *   Ring K is attached to C5 of phenyl ring A. The adjacent carbon, C6 of ring A, is bonded directly to the Iridium center (this is a cyclometalation site).\n        *   Ring L is attached to C5 of phenyl ring C. Similarly, the adjacent carbon, C6 of ring C, is bonded to the Iridium center.\n        *   For rings K or L to rotate, their ortho hydrogen atoms (or any substituents at their ortho positions) would have to sweep past the very large Iridium atom and the other ligands attached to it. This would cause a severe steric clash.\n        *   Therefore, the rotation of rings K and L is severely restricted or completely blocked. They are considered \"locked\" in place.\n\n    *   **Rings H and J:**\n        *   Ring H is attached to C4 of phenyl ring A. Its neighboring positions on ring A are C3 and C5. The drawing shows a substituent at C3 (part of the connection to pyridine ring B) and a substituent at C5 (the phenyl ring K).\n        *   Ring J is in an analogous position on the other cyclometalating ligand, attached to C4 of ring C, with neighbors at C3 (pyridine D) and C5 (phenyl L).\n        *   These rings (H and J) are \"sandwiched\" between two bulky groups. For ring H to rotate, it must pass by the pyridine group on one side and the phenyl group K on the other. This creates a very high energy barrier to rotation. Such a sterically hindered environment often leads to atropisomerism, where the rotamers are stable and do not interconvert easily.\n        *   Therefore, the rotation of rings H and J is also severely restricted and they cannot be considered \"freely rotating\".\n\n    *   **Ring G:**\n        *   Ring G is attached to C3 of pyridine ring F. Its neighbors on ring F are at positions C2 and C4.\n        *   At position C2, ring F is connected to the other pyridine ring of the bipyridine ligand, ring E. This is a bulky group.\n        *   At position C4, there is an implied hydrogen atom, which is a very small group.\n        *   For ring G to rotate, it will experience a steric clash on the side facing ring E, but very little hindrance on the side facing the hydrogen atom at C4.\n        *   Compared to all the other phenyl rings (H, J, K, L), ring G is in the least sterically crowded environment. While its rotation is not entirely without hindrance, the barrier is expected to be significantly lower than for the others, and low enough to be considered \"free\" rotation at room temperature.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis of steric hindrance:\n    *   Rings K and L are locked due to direct interaction with the metal center.\n    *   Rings H and J are locked due to being sandwiched between two other bulky substituents.\n    *   Ring G is the only phenyl group with a significantly lower rotational barrier, as it is only sterically hindered on one side.\n    *   Therefore, among the given choices, only ring G can be considered to rotate freely.\n\n6.  **Match with Answer Choices:**\n    The set of freely rotating rings is {G}. This corresponds to answer choice K.\n\n<<<K>>>"
