    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the substituents at the labeled positions.\n\n**1. Overview of the Reaction**\nThe reaction starts with a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol. Under acidic conditions (catalytic HCl) and high temperature (110°C), the alcohol undergoes dehydration (loss of H₂O) followed by a series of carbocation rearrangements to form a more stable alkene product. The problem states that the rearrangement involves multiple [1,2] shifts. The final product has an olean-12-ene skeleton, which is a common and thermodynamically stable structure for pentacyclic triterpenoids.\n\n**2. Identifying the Labeled Positions**\nFirst, we must correctly identify the carbon atoms corresponding to the numbered positions in the product. Using standard triterpenoid numbering, we can map the labels as follows:\n*   **Position 1:** The dashed (α) substituent on carbon C-4.\n*   **Position 2:** The wedged (β) substituent on carbon C-10.\n*   **Position 3:** The dashed (α) substituent on carbon C-5.\n*   **Position 4:** The wedged (β) substituent on carbon C-8.\n*   **Position 5:** The dashed (α) substituent on carbon C-14.\n\n**3. Tracing the Reaction Mechanism Step-by-Step**\n\nThe mechanism is a classic example of a Wagner-Meerwein backbone rearrangement.\n\n*   **Step A: Formation of the Initial Carbocation.** The hydroxyl group at C-3 is protonated by HCl, forming a good leaving group (-OH₂⁺). This group departs, generating a secondary carbocation at C-3.\n\n*   **Step B: First [1,2]-Shift (C-4 → C-3).** To form a more stable carbocation, a methyl group (CH₃) migrates from the adjacent quaternary carbon C-4 to C-3. This is a [1,2]-methyl shift. The positive charge is now at C-4, which is a tertiary carbocation.\n\n*   **Step C: Second [1,2]-Shift (C-5 → C-4).** A hydrogen atom (H) from C-5 migrates to the positively charged C-4. This is a [1,2]-hydride shift. The positive charge moves to C-5.\n    *   **Analysis of Position 1 (C-4):** C-4 initially had two methyl groups. It lost one to C-3 and gained a hydrogen from C-5. The original hydrogen at C-5 was α (dashed). It migrates to the α-face of the C-4 cation. Thus, the α-substituent at C-4 is now a hydrogen.\n        *   **1 = H**\n\n*   **Step D: The Cascade Continues from C-5.** Now we have a carbocation at C-5. At this point, a crucial step occurs. While a simple [1,2]-shift of the methyl group from C-10 to C-5 is possible, it is known that in many such rearrangements, a transannular [1,4]-hydride shift from C-9 to C-5 occurs instead. This bypasses the migration of the C-10 methyl group and leads to the observed oleanane product which retains a methyl group at C-10. This pathway is favored as it directly forms a stable tertiary carbocation at C-9. Although the question mentions \"[1,2] shifts,\" this is often used as a general term for these complex cascades, and this [1,4] shift is a key feature. Let's assume this path is taken.\n    *   **Analysis of Position 2 (C-10):** The methyl group at C-10 does not migrate. Therefore, it remains in its original position.\n        *   **2 = CH₃**\n    *   **Analysis of Position 3 (C-5):** C-5 loses its original hydrogen (to C-4) and gains a new hydrogen from C-9. The position labeled '3' is the α-position, which is now occupied by the newly arrived hydrogen.\n        *   **3 = H**\n\n*   **Step E: Cascade from C-9.** The positive charge is now at C-9. The rearrangement continues with a series of [1,2]-shifts down the backbone.\n    *   A [1,2]-methyl shift occurs from C-8 to C-9. The charge moves to C-8.\n\n*   **Step F: Cascade from C-8.** A [1,2]-methyl shift occurs from C-14 to C-8. The charge moves to C-14.\n    *   **Analysis of Position 4 (C-8):** The original methyl group at C-8 migrates to C-9. Then, a new methyl group migrates in from C-14. The β-position at C-8 is now occupied by the methyl group that came from C-14.\n        *   **4 = CH₃**\n\n*   **Step G: Cascade from C-14.** A [1,2]-hydride shift occurs from C-13 to C-14. The charge moves to C-13.\n    *   **Analysis of Position 5 (C-14):** The original methyl group at C-14 has migrated to C-8. C-14 then gains a hydrogen from C-13. This new hydrogen occupies the α-position.\n        *   **5 = H**\n\n*   **Step H: Final Elimination.** The carbocation at C-13 is stabilized by the elimination of a proton from the adjacent C-12, forming the final, thermodynamically stable, tetrasubstituted double bond between C-12 and C-13.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\nBy collating the results from the step-by-step analysis:\n*   1 = H\n*   2 = CH₃\n*   3 = H\n*   4 = CH₃\n*   5 = H\n\nFinal check: 1=H, 2=CH3, 3=H, 4=CH3, 5=H.\n\n<<<1 = H, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
