    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Venue:** The first step is to identify the venue shown in the image. The building has very distinctive architectural features:\n    *   A mix of red brick (some in a herringbone pattern) and tan stucco-like surfaces.\n    *   A prominent curved archway and roofline on the left side.\n    *   A decorative quatrefoil-shaped relief on the tan wall.\n    *   An upper-level open area or balcony with a white, crisscross (diaper or lozenge pattern) railing.\n    *   A large semi-truck, typical of a touring band's equipment hauler, is parked in front, reinforcing the idea that this is a performance venue.\n\n2.  **Determine the Venue's Name and Location:** Using these visual clues, a reverse image search or a descriptive search (e.g., \"theater red brick quatrefoil design\") points to the **Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox** located in Spokane, Washington. A quick comparison with images of the theater on Google Maps and its official website confirms that the building in the photo is indeed the Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox.\n\n3.  **Find the Event Schedule for the Specific Date:** The question asks who played at this venue on a specific date: October 12, 2023. The next step is to find the event calendar for the Martin Woldson Theater for that date.\n\n4.  **Identify the Performer:** By searching the theater's official website archives, ticketing sites, or general event listings for \"Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox October 12, 2023,\" we can find the performance that took place on that night. The event scheduled and performed on that date was the **Goo Goo Dolls** on their \"The Big Night Out Tour\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Venue Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify the venue first. The unique architectural details are key to a successful identification.\n*   **Date Specificity:** The question is very specific about the date (October 12, 2023). It's important to look up the schedule for that exact day and not a surrounding one.\n*   **Ignoring Irrelevant Information:** The year the photo was taken (2024) is contextual but does not change the core question, which is about a past event in 2023. The truck is a clue that it's a performance venue, but its specific details are not needed to find the answer.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the name of the musical artist.\n\n<<<Goo Goo Dolls>>>"
