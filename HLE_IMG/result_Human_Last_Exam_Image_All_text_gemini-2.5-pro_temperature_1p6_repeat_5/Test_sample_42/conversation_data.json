    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Observe the main subject of the icon:** The image shows an elderly man with a long, pointed, white or light-blond beard, and a high, balding forehead. He has a golden halo, which signifies sainthood in Christian iconography. He is dressed in what appears to be a dark monastic robe or mantle (a purple-brown color) over a blue inner garment.\n\n2.  **Analyze the objects and text:** The saint is holding a large, unrolled scroll in his left hand. The scroll contains text written in a Cyrillic script, likely Church Slavonic. This is common in icons of saints who were teachers, writers, or prophets, with the scroll containing a quote from their teachings or from scripture. In the background, particularly visible in the cropped images, there are faint inscriptions which would typically identify the saint.\n\n3.  **Examine the artistic style:** The style of the icon, with its elongated figures, expressive features, and specific use of color and gold leaf, is characteristic of the Byzantine or post-Byzantine tradition. This is a fresco, not a portable panel icon, judging by the wall texture.\n\n4.  **Identify the specific artwork:** To be certain of the identity, we can try to locate this specific artwork. A reverse image search reveals that this is a well-known fresco from the Monastery of St. Nicholas Anapausas in Meteora, Greece. It was painted in the 16th century (around 1527) by the famous Cretan master, Theophanes the Greek.\n\n5.  **Confirm the subject's identity:** Art historical sources and catalogues of the frescoes at Meteora identify this figure as **Saint Simeon Stylites the Elder** (c. 390 â€“ 459 AD). Saint Simeon was a Syrian ascetic who achieved fame for living for 37 years on a small platform on top of a pillar near Aleppo. He is depicted here not on his pillar, but as a venerable elder and teacher, which is a common way to portray saints in a series of figures.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the answer choices:**\n    *   A. Saint Anthony: A possible candidate based on general appearance (Desert Father), but the specific artwork is identified otherwise.\n    *   B. Saint Macarius: Similar to St. Anthony, a plausible candidate by appearance but incorrect for this specific fresco.\n    *   C. Saint Seraphim of Sarov: A much later Russian saint with different typical iconography.\n    *   D. Moses the Prophet: An Old Testament figure, typically shown with tablets of law, not a monastic habit and scroll in this manner.\n    *   E. Saint Varlaam: An ascetic hermit, so the appearance is plausible, but this fresco is known to depict St. Simeon.\n    *   F. Saint Simeon Stylites: This matches the identification of the famous fresco by Theophanes of Crete in the Monastery of St. Nicholas Anapausas, Meteora.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** Based on the identification of the specific fresco and its location and artist, the saint depicted is Saint Simeon Stylites.\n\n<<<F>>>"
