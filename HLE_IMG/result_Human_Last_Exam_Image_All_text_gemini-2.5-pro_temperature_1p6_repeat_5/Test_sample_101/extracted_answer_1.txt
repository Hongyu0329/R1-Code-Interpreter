The final product, Compound A, is 2-(cyano(phenylamino)methyl)pyridin-3-ol. Its structure consists of a pyridine ring with a hydroxyl group at position 3 and a -CH(CN)(NHPh) group at position 2.
The structure can be visualized as follows:
A pyridine ring has a hydroxyl group (-OH) on carbon 3. On the adjacent carbon (position 2), there is a chiral carbon atom. This chiral carbon is bonded to a hydrogen atom, a cyano group (-CN), a phenylamino group (-NH-Ph), and to the pyridine ring itself.
