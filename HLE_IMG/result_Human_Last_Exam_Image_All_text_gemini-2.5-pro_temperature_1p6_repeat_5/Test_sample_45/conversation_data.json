    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling shown in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question and the concept of rotational symmetry.**\nThe question asks for the rotational symmetry of the given tiling. Rotational symmetry of an object (or a pattern) means it looks the same after a certain amount of rotation around a central point. The \"order\" of rotational symmetry is the number of times the pattern matches itself in one full 360-degree rotation. For example, 4-fold rotational symmetry means the pattern looks the same after rotations of 90°, 180°, and 270°.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the components and potential centers of rotation.**\nThe tiling is composed of three different shapes:\n*   Regular hexagons (blue)\n*   Squares (light yellow)\n*   Rhombi or diamonds (orange)\n\nPotential centers for rotation are typically found at the center of a tile, at a vertex where multiple tiles meet, or at the midpoint of an edge between two tiles. We should look for the point that allows for the highest order of rotation, as this defines the overall symmetry of the pattern.\n\n**Step 3: Test the center of a hexagon as a potential center of rotation.**\nLet's select one of the blue hexagons near the center of the image and consider its center as the point of rotation.\n*   **Observation:** The central hexagon is surrounded by a ring of other tiles. Each of its 6 sides is adjacent to a light yellow square. At each of its 6 vertices, a square and an orange rhombus meet the hexagon.\n*   **Hypothesis:** This arrangement appears highly symmetric. Let's test for 6-fold rotational symmetry, which corresponds to a rotation of 360°/6 = 60°.\n*   **Verification:** If we rotate the entire pattern by 60° around the center of this hexagon:\n    *   The central blue hexagon rotates onto itself.\n    *   The square attached to one side of the hexagon moves to the exact position of the square that was attached to the next side. This works because there is a square on every side.\n    *   The rhombus at one vertex of the hexagon moves to the exact position of the rhombus at the next vertex. This works because there is a rhombus at every vertex.\n    *   Since the entire immediate surrounding of the hexagon maps perfectly onto itself, and the overall tiling is a repeating pattern, a 60° rotation will map the entire tiling onto itself.\n*   **Conclusion:** The pattern has 6-fold rotational symmetry around the center of each hexagon.\n\n**Step 4: Test other potential centers to confirm the highest order.**\n*   **Center of a Square:** Let's examine a light yellow square. One of its sides is adjacent to a hexagon, while the other three sides are adjacent to orange rhombi. If we rotate the pattern by 90° (for 4-fold symmetry) around the center of the square, the side with the hexagon would need to land on a side that also has a hexagon. This is not the case. Therefore, there is no 4-fold symmetry around the center of a square. A 180° rotation also fails for the same reason.\n*   **Center of a Rhombus:** A rhombus itself has 2-fold symmetry. However, its surroundings in the pattern are not symmetric enough to allow a 180° rotation of the entire tiling around its center.\n*   **Vertices:** There are different types of vertices where tiles meet. For example, one type of vertex joins a hexagon, a square, and a rhombus. The internal angles are 120°, 90°, and 150° respectively. There is no non-trivial rotational symmetry around such a point.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\nWe have found centers of 6-fold rotation. According to the crystallographic restriction theorem, for a periodic pattern that can tile a plane, the only possible rotational symmetries are 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold (and the trivial 1-fold). Since we have found 6-fold symmetry, this is the highest possible order for this pattern. The rotational symmetry of the tiling is therefore defined by this highest order.\n\nThe tiling has 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
