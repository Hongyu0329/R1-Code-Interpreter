    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph and Identify Synchronized Bursts**\nThe provided image is a raster plot that displays neuronal firing activity over time. The x-axis represents time in seconds (s), and the y-axis represents the electrode number (from 0 to 128). Each dot corresponds to a single neuron firing. A \"synchronized burst\" is a period where many neurons across multiple electrodes fire at a high rate nearly simultaneously. These appear as dense vertical bands in the plot.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Timestamps of Each Synchronized Burst**\nWe will scan the graph along the time axis and identify the approximate center of each major synchronized burst.\n\n*   **Burst 1:** The first distinct burst is centered at approximately **t₁ = 3 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The second burst is centered at approximately **t₂ = 12 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** The third burst occurs around **t₃ = 18 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** There is a very strong and wide burst centered at approximately **t₄ = 35.5 s**.\n*   **Burst 5:** The final major burst is centered at approximately **t₅ = 48 s**.\n\nSo, the timestamps for the five identified synchronized bursts are approximately 3 s, 12 s, 18 s, 35.5 s, and 48 s.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time duration between the centers of two consecutive bursts. We have five bursts, which means there are four intervals.\n\n*   **Interval 1:** between Burst 2 and Burst 1 = t₂ - t₁ = 12 s - 3 s = 9 s.\n*   **Interval 2:** between Burst 3 and Burst 2 = t₃ - t₂ = 18 s - 12 s = 6 s.\n*   **Interval 3:** between Burst 4 and Burst 3 = t₄ - t₃ = 35.5 s - 18 s = 17.5 s.\n*   **Interval 4:** between Burst 5 and Burst 4 = t₅ - t₄ = 48 s - 35.5 s = 12.5 s.\n\nThe calculated inter-burst intervals are 9 s, 6 s, 17.5 s, and 12.5 s.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual intervals and divide by the number of intervals (4).\n\n*   Sum of IBIs = 9 + 6 + 17.5 + 12.5 = 45 s.\n*   Average IBI = (Sum of IBIs) / (Number of intervals) = 45 s / 4 = 11.25 s.\n\n**Step 5: Round the Answer to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question asks for the final answer to be expressed with two significant figures.\n\n*   The calculated average is 11.25 s.\n*   To round to two significant figures, we look at the third digit (2). Since it is less than 5, we keep the second significant digit as it is.\n*   The average inter-burst interval is **11 s**.\n\n<<<11>>>"
