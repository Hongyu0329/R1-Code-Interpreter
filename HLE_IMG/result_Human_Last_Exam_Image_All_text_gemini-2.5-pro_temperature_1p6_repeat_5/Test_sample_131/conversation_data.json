    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Functional Groups and Ring System**\n    *   The molecule is a polycyclic organic compound.\n    *   It contains two nitrogen atoms, which makes it a diamine derivative and classifies it as an alkaloid, as stated in the question.\n    *   It contains a carbonyl group (C=O) within a six-membered ring that also contains a nitrogen atom. This functional group is a cyclic amide, also known as a lactam.\n    *   The core structure consists of four fused six-membered rings. This type of tetracyclic framework is common among certain classes of alkaloids.\n    *   The bonds shown with wedges and dashes indicate that the molecule is chiral and has a specific three-dimensional stereochemistry.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the Parent Skeleton**\n    *   The fused tetracyclic system containing two nitrogen atoms is characteristic of the quinolizidine alkaloids.\n    *   The basic saturated skeleton (without the carbonyl group) is known as sparteine. The given compound is therefore an oxo-derivative of sparteine.\n\n*   **Step 3: Compare with Known Alkaloids**\n    *   We compare the given structure to common quinolizidine alkaloids.\n    *   **Sparteine:** Has the same ring system but lacks the C=O group.\n    *   **Matrine:** Has a similar tetracyclic structure but with a different connectivity of the rings.\n    *   **Cytisine:** Is a tricyclic system and thus has a different core structure.\n    *   **Anagyrine:** Contains a pyridone ring (an unsaturated lactam), whereas the structure shown has a fully saturated lactam ring (a piperidone).\n    *   **Lupanine:** The structure of lupanine is defined as a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid with a lactam group at position C2. The depicted structure, including the ring fusion and the specific stereochemistry, precisely matches that of lupanine, specifically the naturally occurring (-)-lupanine isomer.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the Name**\n    *   Based on the analysis of the functional groups, the ring system, and comparison with known structures, the compound is identified as lupanine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
