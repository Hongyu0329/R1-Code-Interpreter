    "An explicit step-by-step analysis of the algorithm and its time complexity is as follows.\n\n**1. Understand the Algorithm's Structure**\n\nThe provided algorithm is a recursive function `sort(a, n)` that aims to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`. Let's break down its logic for the case `n > 1`:\n\n*   **`sort(a, n - 1)`:** This is the first recursive call. It attempts to sort the subarray `a[0...n-2]`. Let's assume, for now, that this call successfully sorts this prefix. After this call, we would have `a[0] <= a[1] <= ... <= a[n-2]`.\n*   **`if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:`**: This condition checks if the last element of the current segment, `a[n-1]`, is smaller than the largest element of the just-sorted prefix, `a[n-2]`.\n*   **`swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`**: If the condition is true, it swaps these two elements. After the swap, the original `a[n-2]` (which was the largest element from the prefix) is now at `a[n-1]`. The original `a[n-1]` (a smaller element) is now at `a[n-2]`, potentially disrupting the sorted order of the `a[0...n-2]` prefix.\n*   **`sort(a, n - 1)`:** This is the crucial second recursive call. It is executed *only if* the swap occurred. Its purpose is to re-sort the prefix `a[0...n-2]` because the swap might have broken its sorted state.\n\n**2. Formulate the Recurrence Relation**\n\nLet `T(n)` be the time taken by the `sort(a, n)` function in the worst case.\n\n*   **Base Case:** If `n <= 1`, the function does nothing, so `T(1) = O(1)`.\n*   **Recursive Step (`n > 1`):** The total time is the sum of the time for its component parts.\n    *   The first call `sort(a, n - 1)` takes `T(n - 1)`.\n    *   The comparison and potential swap take constant time, `O(1)`.\n    *   The second call `sort(a, n - 1)`, which happens in the worst case, also takes `T(n - 1)`.\n\nTo find the worst-case complexity, we must assume the scenario that leads to the most work. The most work occurs when the `if` condition is true, triggering the second recursive call. Therefore, the worst-case recurrence relation is:\n`T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + O(1)`\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant)\n\n**3. Solve the Recurrence Relation**\n\nWe can solve `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c` by expansion:\n\n*   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n*   `T(n) = 2 * [2 * T(n - 2) + c] + c = 2^2 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n*   `T(n) = 2^2 * [2 * T(n - 3) + c] + 2c + c = 2^3 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n*   ...after `k` expansions...\n*   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) + ... + 1)`\n\nThe sum `1 + 2 + ... + 2^(k-1)` is a geometric series equal to `2^k - 1`. So:\n`T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^k - 1)`\n\nWe continue expanding until we reach the base case `T(1)`. Let `n - k = 1`, which means `k = n - 1`. Substituting this back into the equation:\n\n*   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n*   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c_1 + c * 2^(n-1) - c` (where `c_1` is the constant time for `T(1)`)\n*   `T(n) = (c_1 + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\nThe dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`. In Big O notation, constant factors and lower-order terms are ignored.\n\nTherefore, `T(n) = O(2^(n-1))`, which is equivalent to `O(2^n)`.\n\n**4. Consider the Worst-Case Input**\n\nA simple worst-case input is a reverse-sorted array, e.g., `[n, n-1, ..., 2, 1]`.\n*   Let's see what happens with `sort([3, 2, 1], 3)`.\n    1.  Call `sort([3, 2], 2)`. This will sort the prefix, resulting in the array state `[2, 3, 1]`.\n    2.  Back in the `n=3` call, `a[2]` (which is 1) is compared to `a[1]` (which is 3). `1 < 3` is true.\n    3.  Swap them. The array becomes `[2, 1, 3]`.\n    4.  Call `sort([2, 1], 2)` again. This is another worst-case call for a size 2 array.\nThis confirms that a reverse-sorted array forces the algorithm to always take the most expensive path, justifying our use of the recurrence `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c`.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nThe algorithm's structure leads to a recurrence relation of `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c` in the worst case. Solving this recurrence yields an exponential time complexity.\n\n*   The algorithm terminates because each recursive call is on a smaller problem size (`n-1`), eventually reaching the base case (`n <= 1`).\n*   The time complexity is `O(2^n)`.\n\nComparing this result with the given choices, option E matches our analysis.\n\n<<<E>>>"
