    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the medallion.**\n    The image shows a round medallion with an integral suspension loop at the top. It features two male busts in profile, facing each other (a style known as \"confronted busts\"). The figures are clean-shaven and appear to wear simple diadems. The most striking feature is the artistic style: the hair is rendered in a highly stylized, almost pattern-like fashion, resembling a cap of tight curls. The eyes are large and prominent, with a fixed gaze. This particular style is a hallmark of Late Roman imperial portraiture.\n\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the iconography.**\n    The depiction of two co-rulers facing each other was a common theme in Roman imperial art from the 3rd century onward. It was meant to symbolize `concordia`, or harmony, between the Augusti. This suggests the medallion was minted during a period of joint rule.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the subjects and the specific artifact.**\n    By comparing the portrait style with known Roman imperial art, the figures can be identified as the emperors Constantius II and Constans, sons of Constantine the Great. This specific gold medallion is a well-known artifact, originating from the Szilágysomlyó (or Șimleu Silvaniei) treasure found in modern-day Romania.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the historical date.**\n    Constantius II and Constans reigned as co-emperors from 337 A.D., following their father's death, until the death of Constans in 350 A.D. The medallion must have been minted within this 13-year period. Numismatic studies typically date this piece to c. 340-350 A.D.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the century.**\n    The date range of 337 A.D. to 350 A.D. falls entirely within the 4th century A.D. (which covers the years from 301 to 400 A.D.). Therefore, archaeologists confidently ascribe this medallion to the 4th century A.D.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n*   The style is distinct from classical Roman art and should be recognized as Late Antique/Late Roman.\n*   The depiction of two rulers is a significant clue pointing to a specific historical period of co-emperorship.\n*   The unique, cap-like hairstyle is a key diagnostic feature for the Constantinian dynasty's portraiture.\n*   It's important to use the precise reign dates of the identified emperors to narrow down the manufacturing date of the artifact.\n\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
