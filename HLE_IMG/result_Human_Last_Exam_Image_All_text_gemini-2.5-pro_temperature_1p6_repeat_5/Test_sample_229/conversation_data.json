    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the title, musical style, and country of origin of the song from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Musical Style Analysis:**\n    *   **Format:** The music is written as a \"lead sheet,\" featuring a single melody line with chord symbols written above. This format is very common in jazz and related popular music styles, as it provides the essential harmonic and melodic information for performers to interpret and improvise upon.\n    *   **Rhythm:** The melody is heavily syncopated, with many notes falling on off-beats and tied across bar lines. This rhythmic complexity is a defining characteristic of jazz.\n    *   **Harmony:** The chord progression uses frequent seventh chords (E7, G7), minor chords (C-, D-, A-), and chromatic passing chords. The progression `C | E7 | F ...` and turnarounds involving cycles of fifths are staples of the jazz vocabulary.\n    *   **Melody:** The melodic line contains many arpeggiated figures (outlining the chords) and chromatic passing tones (like the F# over the E7 chord and the D# in measure 5). This virtuosic, arpeggio-heavy style is particularly indicative of a specific subgenre of jazz.\n    *   **Instrumentation (implied):** This style of music, often called \"Jazz Manouche\" or \"Hot Club Jazz,\" was pioneered by guitarist Django Reinhardt. The melodic phrasing is highly idiomatic to the guitar. The typical rhythm section would consist of rhythm guitars playing a percussive \"la pompe\" style and an upright bass.\n    *   **Conclusion on Style:** Based on the combination of the syncopated melody, lead sheet format, jazz harmony, and guitar-like phrasing, the musical style is **Gypsy Jazz** (or Jazz Manouche).\n\n2.  **Country of Origin Analysis:**\n    *   The Gypsy Jazz style originated in and around Paris, **France**, during the 1930s. Its primary creator and most famous proponent was the Belgian-born French Romani guitarist Django Reinhardt and his Quintette du Hot Club de France. Therefore, the country of origin associated with this musical style is France.\n\n3.  **Song Title Identification:**\n    *   By transcribing the first few bars of the melody and comparing them to well-known Gypsy Jazz standards, we can identify the specific tune.\n    *   The pickup notes are G, G.\n    *   The melody over the first several bars is: `C B C E | G F# G B | A G F E | F E D# D | C...`\n    *   The chord progression starts: `C | E7 | F | ...`\n    *   This exact melody and core harmonic structure belong to the famous Gypsy Jazz standard **\"Douce Ambiance\"**, composed by Django Reinhardt. The title is French and translates to \"Sweet Atmosphere\" or \"Gentle Mood.\"\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n*   Pay attention to the format (lead sheet).\n*   Analyze the key characteristics: syncopated rhythm, jazz chord voicings (7ths), and arpeggiated melodic lines.\n*   Recognize these features as hallmarks of Gypsy Jazz.\n*   Connect the style (Gypsy Jazz) to its founder (Django Reinhardt) and country of origin (France).\n*   Identify the specific melody by comparing it to famous tunes from the genre. The melody of \"Douce Ambiance\" is a clear match.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n*   **Title:** Douce Ambiance\n*   **Musical Style:** Gypsy Jazz (or Jazz Manouche)\n*   **Country of Origin:** France\n\n<<<**Title:** Douce Ambiance, **Musical Style:** Gypsy Jazz, **Country of Origin:** France>>>"
