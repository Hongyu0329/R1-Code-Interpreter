    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\n*   The first part of the clue is \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows a man with a beard receiving a trophy from an older man in a formal setting, which looks like an awards ceremony.\n*   A search for major awards ceremonies around June 20, 2019, points to the 2019 NHL Awards, which were held on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas.\n*   By comparing the man receiving the award to photos from that event, he can be identified as Russian ice hockey player **Nikita Kucherov**.\n*   At the 2019 NHL Awards, Kucherov won three major individual awards for his performance in the 2018-19 season: the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), the Art Ross Trophy (top point scorer), and the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player as voted by players).\n*   Winning three significant achievements is often referred to as a **\"hat-trick\"**. This provides a strong candidate for \"X Y\". So, Nikita Kucherov, famous for his \"hat-trick\" of awards (and on-ice hat-tricks), is pictured.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   The second clue is \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This clue points to a historical process or profession that involved mercury.\n*   The most well-known historical use of mercury that has been discontinued for safety reasons is in the hat-making industry.\n*   Hatters used mercury(II) nitrate to turn fur into felt. This process was highly toxic and caused neurological damage (erethism) in the workers, leading to the expression \"mad as a hatter\".\n\n**Step 3: Connect the two clues.**\n*   The term that connects both clues is **\"Hat Trick\"**.\n*   **Clue 1:** The image shows a hockey player, Nikita Kucherov, who is associated with the term \"hat-trick\" both for scoring three goals in a game and for winning a trio of major awards in 2019.\n*   **Clue 2:** This is a pun on the term. The \"trick\" of the hat-making trade (the process of using mercury to make felt) is the \"another X Y\" that has ceased to be used due to its toxicity.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The date in the prompt (June 20) is one day off from the actual event date (June 19), but this is a minor discrepancy common in such questions and might refer to the date of a news report about the event.\n*   The solution relies on a pun and connecting two seemingly unrelated fields: modern sports and historical industrial processes.\n*   The term \"X Y\" represents two words, which fits \"Hat Trick\".\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy identifying the person in the image and his achievement (a hat-trick of awards) and linking the term \"hat-trick\" via a pun to the historical use of mercury in hat-making, we can determine the answer.\n\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
