    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided image.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual information in the image.**\nThe image consists of two plots, one above the other, likely representing the same auditory event in two different ways.\n*   **Top Plot (Spectrogram):** This plot shows frequency over time. The long, thin horizontal blue line represents a sound with a constant frequencyâ€”a pure tone. In the middle of the plot, this line is broken. At the point of the break, there is a vertical blur that covers a wide range of frequencies. This vertical blur represents a short burst of a different sound that is spectrally complex, like white noise, a cough, or a click. This plot clearly shows that the pure tone is *physically absent* during the burst of noise.\n*   **Bottom Plot (Waveform):** This plot shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time. The left side shows a regular, repeating sine wave, which corresponds to the pure tone. In the middle, the waveform becomes irregular and chaotic, corresponding to the burst of noise. After this section, the regular sine wave resumes. Again, this plot confirms that the pure tone signal is replaced by the noise signal; it is not present \"underneath\" the noise.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the textual information in the question.**\nThe question describes the phenomenon illustrated by the image with several key clues:\n*   **It's an \"illusion\":** This means that what is perceived is different from the physical reality shown in the plots.\n*   **Similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity:** The Necker Cube is an optical illusion where a 2D drawing of a cube can be perceived in two different 3D orientations. The brain actively interprets the ambiguous 2D information to create a coherent 3D perception. This comparison suggests that the auditory phenomenon in question also involves the brain \"filling in the gaps\" or interpreting ambiguous sensory data to form a coherent whole.\n*   **Reveals a \"common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\":** This indicates that our brains perform this function automatically and frequently in everyday life without us being aware of it.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the visual and textual information to identify the phenomenon.**\nCombining the analysis, we have:\n*   A physical stimulus where a tone is interrupted and replaced by a burst of noise.\n*   The description of an illusion where the brain creates a coherent perception from incomplete information, a process that happens unconsciously.\n\nWhen a listener hears this sound, the illusion is that they perceive the pure tone as being continuous, seeming to carry on \"behind\" the intervening noise. The brain assumes that it is more likely for a continuous tone to be briefly masked by a noise than for a tone to stop exactly when a noise begins and then start again exactly when the noise ends. This perceptual \"filling in\" of the missing tone is the illusion.\n\nThis specific auditory illusion is a well-documented phenomenon in perceptual psychology. It is a prime example of perceptual restoration, where the brain restores missing parts of a sensory signal.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the specific name of the phenomenon.**\nThe most famous example of this type of perceptual restoration is called the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**. It was first demonstrated by Richard M. Warren in 1970. In his classic experiment, a phoneme (a basic unit of sound in speech) was removed from a recorded sentence and replaced with a non-speech sound like a cough or a burst of static. Participants in the study typically did not notice that the phoneme was missing at all; they reported hearing both the complete, uninterrupted word and the cough.\n\nAlthough the image uses a simple tone instead of a speech phoneme, it illustrates the exact same underlying principle. This more general case is sometimes called the **auditory continuity illusion** or **temporal induction**. However, the **Phonemic Restoration Effect** is the most widely known name for this perceptual ability and is often used to refer to the principle in general, even when non-speech sounds are used in demonstrations.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The core of the illusion is the brain's top-down processing, using context and prior knowledge to shape perception.\n*   The illusion only works if the interrupting sound is loud and complex enough to have realistically masked the original sound. If the interruption is silence, the listener correctly perceives a gap.\n*   The comparison to the Necker Cube is apt because both illusions demonstrate that perception is not a passive reception of sensory data but an active process of interpretation and construction.\n\nBased on this analysis, the name of the phenomenon is the Phonemic Restoration Effect.\n\n<<<Phonemic Restoration Effect>>>"
