    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the jazz standard:\n\n1.  **Initial Musicological Analysis:**\n    *   **Key Signature:** The key signature has one flat (B♭). This indicates the key of F Major or D minor.\n    *   **First Chord:** The first chord listed is F- (F minor). The piece consistently uses notes from the F minor scale (e.g., A♭ in the first bar melody). This confirms the key is F minor.\n    *   **Time Signature:** Although not explicitly written as a fraction, the grouping of notes in each measure indicates a 4/4 time signature, which is common for jazz standards.\n\n2.  **Melodic Analysis (A Section):**\n    *   **Bar 1 (F-):** The melody starts on C, then moves to F, G, and A♭. These are the 5th, root, 2nd, and minor 3rd of the F minor scale. This opening phrase is quite distinctive.\n    *   **Bar 2 (E-7♭5):** The melody moves to B♭ and A natural.\n    *   **Bar 3 (E♭-6):** The melody moves to D♭ and C.\n    *   The first three bars present a clear melodic contour descending alongside the harmony.\n\n3.  **Harmonic Analysis (Chord Progression):**\n    *   The most striking feature is the chord progression in the first three bars of the A section: **F- | E-7♭5 | E♭-6**. This features a chromatic descending bass line (F -> E -> E♭), which is a very strong characteristic of a specific well-known tune.\n    *   The rest of the A section continues with **| D♭maj7 G7 | C7 | F- | C7 |**. This is a standard progression leading back to the tonic (F-).\n    *   The bridge (B section) starts on a **D-7♭5** chord, and progresses through a series of ii-V-I related chords: **| D-7♭5 | G7 | C7 | F7 | B♭-7 | E♭7 | A♭ | G C7 |**. This is also a classic jazz bridge structure.\n\n4.  **Identification:**\n    *   The combination of the key (F minor), the distinctive melody (starting on the 5th and moving up to the minor 3rd), and especially the unique chromatic descending chord progression **F- -> E-7♭5 -> E♭-6** points definitively to one famous jazz standard.\n    *   Searching for a jazz standard with this progression immediately identifies the tune as **\"Yesterdays\"**.\n    *   To confirm, we identify the composer of \"Yesterdays\". The music was composed by **Jerome Kern**, with lyrics by Otto Harbach, for the 1933 musical \"Roberta\".\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the unique melodic and harmonic features, the sheet music is for the jazz standard \"Yesterdays\".\n    *   The composer of \"Yesterdays\" is Jerome Kern.\n\n<<<Title: Yesterdays, Composer: Jerome Kern>>>"
