    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the identity of the figure leaving the chariot.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Art Style and Medium:** The image is of an ancient Greek vase painted in the red-figure style. This technique, developed in Athens around 530 BCE, involves painting figures in red clay color on a black background, with details incised or painted on top. The use of added white, particularly for the wing and parts of the clothing, is also characteristic of later red-figure pottery (c. 5th century BCE).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Central Scene:** The main action revolves around a chariot.\n    *   **Chariot Driver:** A figure dressed in ornate, non-Greek attire (often identified as Phrygian or Persian style, characterized by the spotted sleeves and elaborate headwear) is driving the chariot. This \"exotic\" dress in Greek art often signifies a figure from the East or a mythological \"barbarian.\"\n    *   **The Chariot:** The chariot has a prominent wing visible above the occupants, indicating it is a magical, flying chariot, not an ordinary one used for racing or warfare.\n    *   **The Falling Figure:** A naked young male figure is depicted falling or having fallen from the back of the chariot. He is positioned head-down, with his body arching over the wheel.\n    *   **Other Occupant:** There appears to be another figure in the chariot behind the driver, draped in cloth.\n\n3.  **Identify the Mythological Subject:** The combination of a powerful female figure in foreign dress, a magical flying chariot, and dead children is highly characteristic of one specific Greek myth: the escape of Medea from Corinth.\n    *   **Medea:** Medea was a sorceress from Colchis, a kingdom on the Black Sea. In the famous tragedy by Euripides, after her husband Jason abandons her to marry a Greek princess, Medea enacts a terrible revenge.\n    *   **The Revenge:** She murders Jason's new bride and the bride's father, King Creon. To complete her revenge and leave Jason with nothing, she then murders the two sons she had with him.\n    *   **The Escape:** To escape Jason's wrath, her divine ancestor, the sun-god Helios, sends her a magical flying chariot (often drawn by winged serpents or dragons). She flees Corinth in this chariot, often depicted carrying the bodies of her dead children.\n\n4.  **Connect the Figures to the Myth:**\n    *   The driver in the ornate, foreign costume is **Medea**.\n    *   The figure falling from the chariot is one of her **murdered sons**. This dramatic composition shows her discarding the body of her child as she makes her escape. The other child is likely the draped figure still inside the chariot.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe question asks to identify the figure *leaving* the chariot. Based on the visual evidence and the mythological context, the figure depicted in the process of exiting the chariot (by falling out of it) is one of the sons of Medea and Jason, whom Medea has just killed before her escape.\n\n<<<One of Medea's sons>>>"
