    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the artwork.**\n*   The image displays a circular bas-relief sculpture set within an ornate frame.\n*   The medium appears to be glazed terracotta (terracotta invetriata), a technique famously associated with Renaissance Florence. The smooth, somewhat glossy surfaces and the style of the relief are typical of this medium.\n*   The scene is religious, depicting a priest administering the sacrament of Communion (the Eucharist) to several kneeling figures, including monks and a child.\n*   The style is typical of the Florentine High Renaissance (late 15th to early 16th century), characterized by graceful figures, balanced composition, and naturalistic details.\n*   At the bottom of the roundel, a banner contains a visible inscription.\n\n**Step 2: Decipher the inscription and understand its significance.**\n*   Zooming in on the bottom portion of the relief (as shown in the cropped images), the inscription on the banner can be read as \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\".\n*   This is in Old Italian/French and translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" confirming the subject is the Eucharist. This specific phrasing can act as a unique identifier for the artwork.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate a hypothesis about the artist based on style and medium.**\n*   The combination of glazed terracotta relief, Renaissance style, and a Florentine location strongly suggests the work is from the workshop of the della Robbia family (Luca, Andrea, or Giovanni) or a close contemporary who worked in the same style and medium. The serene and gentle quality of the figures is particularly reminiscent of Andrea della Robbia.\n\n**Step 4: Conduct targeted research to identify the specific artwork and artist.**\n*   A search for glazed terracotta reliefs depicting the \"Sacrament of the Altar\" or with the inscription \"Sacramenti de l'autel\" is necessary.\n*   While many works by the della Robbia family depict similar themes, a direct match is needed.\n*   This investigation reveals that the relief is the predella (the base panel) of a Eucharistic Tabernacle.\n*   Further research identifies this specific tabernacle as the one located in the Badia Fiesolana (Abbey of Fiesole) in Fiesole, just outside Florence.\n*   Art historical sources attribute this tabernacle not to the more famous della Robbia family, but to their contemporary and competitor, **Benedetto Buglioni** (c. 1461â€“1521). He trained in or was heavily influenced by Andrea della Robbia's workshop, which explains the stylistic similarity, but he established his own successful studio.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the identification.**\n*   The artwork in the image is the predella from the Eucharistic Tabernacle at the Badia Fiesolana.\n*   The author of this work is Benedetto Buglioni.\n\n<<<Benedetto Buglioni>>>"
