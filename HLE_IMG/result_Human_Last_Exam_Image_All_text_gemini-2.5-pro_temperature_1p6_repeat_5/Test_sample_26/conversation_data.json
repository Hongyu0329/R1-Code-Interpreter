    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n**1. Identify the Measure and Key Signature:**\n*   **Locating the Measure:** The music provided shows measure numbers. The second system (line of music) on the page begins with measure 28. Counting from there, measure 30 is the third full measure in that system. The circled area highlights this measure.\n*   **Determining the Key:** The key signature at the beginning of the staff shows three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). This indicates the key of C minor or its relative major, E♭ major. The overall key of the \"Pathetique\" Sonata's first movement is well-known to be C minor.\n\n**2. Analyze the Notes in Measure 30:**\n*   We need to identify the notes being played in both the right and left hands to determine the underlying harmony (chord). The most important harmony in a measure is typically found on the strong beat, which in this case is beat 1.\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** On beat 1 of measure 30, the left hand plays a G octave (G2 and G3). This firmly establishes G as the root of the chord.\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** On beat 1, the right hand plays a rapid arpeggiation. The notes are G, B-natural, and D (with E♭ and F♯ appearing as passing or neighbor tones). The B has a natural sign in front of it in the previous measure (measure 29, beat 2), and this accidental often carries through the measure in older notation, but the B here is clearly intended to be natural to form the dominant harmony. More importantly, the arpeggiation G-B-D clearly outlines the harmony.\n\n**3. Determine the Chord and its Function:**\n*   **Identify the Chord:** Combining the notes from both hands on beat 1, we have G in the bass and G, B-natural, and D in the melody. These three notes (G - B♮ - D) form a **G major triad**.\n*   **Determine its Function in C Minor:** In the key of C minor, the tonic is C. The fifth scale degree (the dominant) is G.\n    *   The diatonic dominant chord in natural C minor would be a G minor triad (G - B♭ - D).\n    *   However, it is standard harmonic practice in the common practice period to raise the seventh scale degree of a minor key to create a \"leading tone,\" which provides a stronger pull back to the tonic. In C minor, the seventh degree is B♭. Raising it creates B-natural.\n    *   Using this raised leading tone, the dominant chord becomes G - B♮ - D, which is a G **major** triad.\n*   **Assign the Roman Numeral:** The Roman numeral for a dominant chord is V. Because the chord is major, we use an uppercase Roman numeral. Therefore, the G major chord in the key of C minor is represented as **V**.\n\n**4. Consider the Entire Measure:**\n*   Beat 2 of the measure contains an F♯-based harmony. This is a secondary leading-tone chord (vii°/V) that serves to embellish and lead back to the G major chord at the beginning of measure 31.\n*   Despite this secondary chord, the principal and defining harmony of measure 30 is the G major (V) chord established on the downbeat. When asked for \"the\" Roman numeral for a measure, we analyze the main, structurally significant harmony.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe chord in measure 30 is a G major triad, which functions as the dominant chord in the home key of C minor. The correct Roman numeral is V.\n\n<<<V>>>"
