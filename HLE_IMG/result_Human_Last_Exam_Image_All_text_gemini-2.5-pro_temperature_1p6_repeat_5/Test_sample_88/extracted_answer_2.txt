**Product A:** The structure is a tricyclic system formed from a [3+2] cycloaddition followed by C-acylation and reduction. It features a dihydropyrrolizine core substituted with both an acetyl group and a methoxycarbonyl group. The nitrogen atom of the core is attached to a pyrrolidin-2-yl substituent (the imine group from the starting material's side chain is reduced).
**Product B:** The structure is an oxidation product of the initial cycloadduct. It is a tricyclic system featuring a pyrrolizidinone core (a lactam). This core is substituted with a methoxycarbonyl group and, at the nitrogen atom, a (3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-yl) group.
**Product C:** The structure is the mixed anhydride of the starting material and acetic acid. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of the starting proline derivative is converted to an anhydride group (-CO-O-COCH3).
