3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-diene which has the following structure: 
```
     CH3
      |
(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH2-C=CH-CH3
``` 
or more explicitly drawn as:
```
        CH3
       /
CH3 - C = C - CH2 - CH2 - CH = C(CH3)2
      |   |             
      H   CH3 is wrong. The correct structure is:

        CH3
        |
CH3 - CH = C - CH2 - CH2 - CH = C(CH3)2

```
The product is 3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.
Final Answer Structure:
```
      CH3        
      |         
CH3 - CH=C - CH2 - CH2 - CH=C(CH3)2
``` 
This compound is known as 3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-diene. The E stereoisomer is formed from geraniol.
Let me redraw the structure corresponding to `(CH3)2C=CHCH2CH2C(CH3)=CHCH3`.
```
       H   CH3        H   H
        \ /          \ /
         C=C          C=C
        / \          / \
(CH3)2C   H-CH2-CH2-H   CH3
```
This is getting complicated. Let's just write the chemical name and draw the final structure simply.

The product A is 3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

```
       CH3
       |
(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH2-C=CH-CH3
```
I will provide the structure as an image. Since I can't generate images, I will provide the chemical name and a SMILES representation.

Chemical name: **3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-diene**
The stereochemistry of the double bond starting from C2 in geraniol is E, which is preserved. Thus, the product is **(E)-3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-diene**.

Structure:
```
   CH3
   |
C=C-CH2-CH2-C=C-C
```
This is a very schematic representation. Let's try again with all atoms shown implicitly.
```
     / \
   /     \
 /         \   /
/             =
               \
```
This is not helpful. Let's provide the final drawn structure.
Final Answer Structure:
A chemical drawing of 3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.
```
      CH3        
      |         
CH3 - CH = C - CH2 - CH2 - CH = C(CH3)2
```
This structure correctly represents **3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-diene**.

Final check of the IUPAC name from the structure `(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH-CH3`:
Chain: `C(1)H3-C(2)H=C(3)(CH3)-C(4)H2-C(5)H2-C(6)H=C(7)(CH3)2`
This gives the name 3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-diene. This is correct.

Final Product A:
(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH-CH3 which is 3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.
