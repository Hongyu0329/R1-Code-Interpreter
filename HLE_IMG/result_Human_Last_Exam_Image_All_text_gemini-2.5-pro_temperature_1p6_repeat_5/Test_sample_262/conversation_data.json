    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Identify the core structure of the complexes.** All four compounds are cationic Iridium(III) complexes. They have the general formula `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+[PF6]−`. The central Iridium ion (Ir) is coordinated to two cyclometalating ligands (C^N) and one diimine ligand (N^N). The counter-ion is hexafluorophosphate (PF6−).\n    2.  **Identify the differences between the complexes.** The diimine ligand (N^N) is the same in all four complexes: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. The bulky tert-butyl groups are known to enhance solubility and prevent aggregation, which generally benefits device lifetime. Since this ligand is constant, it does not explain the differences in lifetime among the four complexes. The key difference lies in the two cyclometalating C^N ligands.\n        *   **Complex 1:** The C^N ligand is 2-phenylpyridine (ppy). The phenyl ring is unsubstituted.\n        *   **Complex 2:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. The phenyl ring has two fluorine substituents.\n        *   **Complex 3:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. The phenyl ring has one fluorine substituent.\n        *   **Complex 4:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)pyridine. The phenyl ring has three fluorine substituents.\n    3.  **Relate molecular structure to device lifetime.** In light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) and related devices like organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), the lifetime of the emitter is critically dependent on its chemical and electrochemical stability. A common degradation pathway for these Ir(III) complexes involves the cleavage of the Ir-C bond of the cyclometalating ligand, which is often the weakest bond in the coordination sphere.\n    4.  **Analyze the effect of substituents on stability.** The strength of the Ir-C bond is influenced by the electronic properties of the C^N ligand.\n        *   Fluorine (F) is a highly electronegative atom. When attached to the phenyl ring, it acts as a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG) through the inductive effect.\n        *   Electron-withdrawing groups decrease the electron density on the phenyl ring, including the carbon atom that forms the Ir-C bond. This makes the carbon atom less nucleophilic (less carbanionic character) and strengthens the covalent Ir-C sigma bond.\n        *   A stronger Ir-C bond leads to a higher bond dissociation energy, making the complex more resistant to degradation, thus resulting in a longer operational lifetime.\n        *   Furthermore, fluorination lowers the energy of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO), which is typically centered on the metal and the phenyl part of the C^N ligand. A lower HOMO energy makes the complex more difficult to oxidize, further enhancing its stability.\n    5.  **Rank the complexes by expected stability.** Based on the number of stabilizing fluorine atoms on the C^N ligands, we can predict the relative stability and thus the lifetime of the emitters.\n        *   **Complex 1:** 0 fluorine atoms. Expected to be the least stable.\n        *   **Complex 3:** 1 fluorine atom. Expected to be more stable than Complex 1.\n        *   **Complex 2:** 2 fluorine atoms. Expected to be more stable than Complex 3.\n        *   **Complex 4:** 3 fluorine atoms. Expected to be the most stable.\n        The expected order of lifetime is: **Complex 1 < Complex 3 < Complex 2 < Complex 4**.\n    6.  **Interpret the question and select the answer.** The question asks which complexes are expected to show \"shorter lifetimes\". The use of the plural \"complexes\" and \"lifetimes\" suggests that we should select more than one complex. Based on our stability ranking, the complexes with the shorter lifetimes are those at the beginning of the series. The two least stable complexes are Complex 1 and Complex 3. These two complexes have zero or only one fluorine atom, respectively, whereas Complexes 2 and 4 are di- and tri-fluorinated, a common strategy for designing highly robust emitters. Therefore, it is logical to group Complex 1 and Complex 3 as the ones with shorter lifetimes compared to the more heavily fluorinated and more stable Complexes 2 and 4.\n\n*   **Careful points:**\n    *   The diimine ligand `dtbbpy` is constant and does not affect the relative stability ranking.\n    *   The primary factor determining stability differences is the fluorination of the C^N ligand.\n    *   Stability (and lifetime) correlates positively with the number of electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms.\n    *   The question uses the plural (\"shorter lifetimes\"), which implies selecting a group of complexes, not just the single one with the absolute shortest lifetime.\n    *   The most logical grouping separates the less-fluorinated complexes (0 or 1 F) from the more-fluorinated complexes (2 or 3 F).\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Complexes 1 and 3, being non-fluorinated and mono-fluorinated respectively, are expected to be significantly less stable and thus exhibit shorter lifetimes compared to the di-fluorinated Complex 2 and the tri-fluorinated Complex 4.\n\n<<<F>>>"
