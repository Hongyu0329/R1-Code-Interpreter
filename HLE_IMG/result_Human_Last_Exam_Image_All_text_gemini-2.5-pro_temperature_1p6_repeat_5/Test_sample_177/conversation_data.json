    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe goal is to calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) when switching from the Baseline scenario (Table 1) to the Proposed scenario (Table 2).\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n*   **Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT):** This is the total number of miles traveled by vehicles. Since the question asks for \"Car VMT\", we are interested in the miles traveled by cars, regardless of the number of occupants. A trip by a car with 1 occupant and a trip by a car with 3 occupants both count as one vehicle trip.\n*   **Weighted Calculation:** To find the total VMT, we need to consider the number of trips for each distance category and the average mileage for each category. We will calculate a VMT Index for each scenario, which is proportional to the actual total VMT.\n*   **Formula:**\n    Percentage Reduction = [ (Baseline Car VMT Index - Proposed Car VMT Index) / Baseline Car VMT Index ] * 100\n\n---\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Car VMT Index for the Baseline Scenario (Table 1)**\n\nFirst, for each distance category, we determine the total share of trips made by car by adding the shares of \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\". Then, we calculate a VMT contribution for each category by multiplying the `share of total trips` by the `total car share` and the `average trip distance`.\n\n*   **Distance 0-3 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 48% (0.48)\n    *   Total car share: 25% + 28% = 53% (0.53)\n    *   Average trip distance: 1 mile\n    *   VMT Contribution: 0.48 * 0.53 * 1 = 0.2544\n\n*   **Distance 3-5 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 22% (0.22)\n    *   Total car share: 38% + 43% = 81% (0.81)\n    *   Average trip distance: 4 miles\n    *   VMT Contribution: 0.22 * 0.81 * 4 = 0.7128\n\n*   **Distance 5-10 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 14% (0.14)\n    *   Total car share: 40% + 45% = 85% (0.85)\n    *   Average trip distance: 7.5 miles\n    *   VMT Contribution: 0.14 * 0.85 * 7.5 = 0.8925\n\n*   **Distance 10+ miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 16% (0.16)\n    *   Total car share: 42% + 47% = 89% (0.89)\n    *   Average trip distance: 20 miles\n    *   VMT Contribution: 0.16 * 0.89 * 20 = 2.8480\n\n*   **Total Baseline Car VMT Index:**\n    Sum of contributions = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Car VMT Index for the Proposed Scenario (Table 2)**\n\nWe repeat the same calculation using the mode share data from Table 2.\n\n*   **Distance 0-3 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 48% (0.48)\n    *   Total car share: 1% + 2% = 3% (0.03)\n    *   Average trip distance: 1 mile\n    *   VMT Contribution: 0.48 * 0.03 * 1 = 0.0144\n\n*   **Distance 3-5 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 22% (0.22)\n    *   Total car share: 8% + 19% = 27% (0.27)\n    *   Average trip distance: 4 miles\n    *   VMT Contribution: 0.22 * 0.27 * 4 = 0.2376\n\n*   **Distance 5-10 miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 14% (0.14)\n    *   Total car share: 14% + 27% = 41% (0.41)\n    *   Average trip distance: 7.5 miles\n    *   VMT Contribution: 0.14 * 0.41 * 7.5 = 0.4305\n\n*   **Distance 10+ miles:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 16% (0.16)\n    *   Total car share: 16% + 33% = 49% (0.49)\n    *   Average trip distance: 20 miles\n    *   VMT Contribution: 0.16 * 0.49 * 20 = 1.5680\n\n*   **Total Proposed Car VMT Index:**\n    Sum of contributions = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction in Car VMT**\n\nNow, we use the VMT indices calculated in the previous steps to find the percentage reduction.\n\n*   **VMT Reduction:**\n    Baseline VMT Index - Proposed VMT Index = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n\n*   **Percentage Reduction:**\n    (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT Index) * 100 = (2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100 ≈ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n---\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n1.  **Baseline VMT Index Calculation:**\n    (0.48 * (0.25+0.28) * 1) + (0.22 * (0.38+0.43) * 4) + (0.14 * (0.40+0.45) * 7.5) + (0.16 * (0.42+0.47) * 20) = 4.7077\n2.  **Proposed VMT Index Calculation:**\n    (0.48 * (0.01+0.02) * 1) + (0.22 * (0.08+0.19) * 4) + (0.14 * (0.14+0.27) * 7.5) + (0.16 * (0.16+0.33) * 20) = 2.2505\n3.  **Percentage Reduction:**\n    ((4.7077 - 2.2505) / 4.7077) * 100 = (2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100 ≈ 52.2%\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
