# The user wants to find the most cost-effective solution to improve a model's accuracy.
# The problem describes a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for a media processing system.
# The key issue is that video processing functions have low probabilities because the training data was skewed towards audio processing.

# Let's analyze the provided options:

# A. Add more training data for video processing
#    - Pros: Directly addresses the data scarcity for video. Likely to be effective.
#    - Cons: Collecting and labeling new data is typically very expensive and time-consuming. This conflicts with the "cost-effective" requirement.

# B. Use resampling to reduce the imbalance between audio and video processing functions in training data
#    - Pros: A standard technique for class imbalance. It's very cheap to implement as it only involves reprocessing existing data.
#    - Cons: It's a data-level patch for a model that has a structural flaw (mixed-purpose states). Its effectiveness might be limited. It helps balance probabilities but doesn't help the model distinguish context.

# C. Train a specific model for video processing and retrain this model for only audio processing data
#    - Pros: Creates highly specialized and accurate models for each task.
#    - Cons: Increases operational complexity and cost. Requires maintaining and deploying two models instead of one, and a method to choose between them.

# D. Add specific states to indicate the model is processing audio or video
#    - Pros: This is a structural fix to the model itself. It directly resolves the ambiguity where a single state handles both audio and video functions. For example, instead of a single 'State 1' for 'setSource', there would be a 'State 1a (setAudioSource)' and 'State 1b (setVideoSource)', each leading to its own distinct workflow path. This is a fundamental improvement.
#    - Cons: Requires a one-time effort to redesign the model's state graph.
#    - Cost-Effectiveness: This is very cost-effective. The main cost is the one-time human effort for the redesign, followed by retraining on the *existing* data. It provides a robust, long-term solution by fixing the root cause of the problem.

# E. Use a model with a longer context window, such as LLM
#    - Pros: Potentially very powerful and could understand the context.
#    - Cons: Extreme overkill. The cost of training, fine-tuning, and inference for an LLM is orders of magnitude higher than for an HMM. This is the least cost-effective option.

# Comparison:
# - Option A (new data) and E (LLM) are too expensive.
# - Option B (resampling) is the cheapest but may not be effective enough.
# - Option C (two models) is effective but adds deployment complexity.
# - Option D (remodeling) directly fixes the model's logical flaw with a moderate, one-time effort, offering a high-quality solution for a reasonable cost. It represents the best trade-off between cost and effectiveness.

# Therefore, adding specific states is the most cost-effective solution because it corrects the fundamental design flaw of the model, leading to significant accuracy improvements without the high cost of new data acquisition or a vastly more complex architecture.

print("The most cost-effective solution is D.")
print("The current HMM has a structural flaw: single states (like state 1, 3, 4) are responsible for conceptually different tasks (e.g., configuring audio vs. configuring video).")
print("This forces the model to choose based on raw probability, which is skewed by the imbalanced training data.")
print("Option D, adding specific states for audio and video, corrects this fundamental flaw. For example, creating a 'setVideoSource' state that transitions to a 'setVideoEncoder' state would create a clear path for video processing recommendations.")
print("This is a one-time model redesign that can be trained on existing data. It is more robust than simple resampling (B) and cheaper and less complex than collecting new data (A), using two models (C), or switching to a vastly more expensive architecture (E).")
print("It provides the best balance of cost and a significant, structural improvement in model accuracy.")
