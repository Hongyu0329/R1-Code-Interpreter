    "This image fragment is from the cover of a very famous book. My plan is to identify the book and then, as per the instructions, write a simple Python script to print its title.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image**: The image shows a white, ethereal unicorn with a golden horn, galloping. It appears to be emerging from a dark area and is partially obscured by a stone-like pillar on the right. The art style is painterly and characteristic of fantasy novel covers.\n2.  **Identify the Book**: This specific artwork is from the original U.S. cover of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*, illustrated by Mary GrandPr√©. The unicorn is seen through an archway on the cover. In the United Kingdom and other regions, the book is titled *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*. I will use the U.S. title as it corresponds to the specific cover art shown.\n3.  **Create a Python Script**: I will now write a simple Python script that stores the book title in a variable and then prints it to the console.\n\n```python\n# The provided image is a cropped section of a book cover.\n# The artwork, featuring a ghostly unicorn next to a stone pillar,\n# is from the original US cover illustration for the first Harry Potter book.\n\nbook_title = \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\"\n\nprint(\"The title of the book is:\")\nprint(book_title)\n```\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
