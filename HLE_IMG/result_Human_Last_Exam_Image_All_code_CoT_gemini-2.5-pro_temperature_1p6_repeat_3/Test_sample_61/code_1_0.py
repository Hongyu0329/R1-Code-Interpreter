    # - An indanone core (C9H8O) from which one hydrogen at the 2-position is removed (-> C9H7O fragment)
    # - A benzyl group (C7H7) is added at that position.
    
    # Let's count atoms based on the structure:
    # Indanone part:
    # - Fused benzene ring: 6 Carbons, 4 Hydrogens
    # - Five-membered ring: 3 Carbons (C=O, C-H, CH2), 3 Hydrogens, 1 Oxygen
    # Total for indanone core with a placeholder at position 2: 9 Carbons, 7 Hydrogens (4+3), 1 Oxygen
    # Benzyl group part:
    # - Phenyl ring: 6 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens
    # - Methylene linker (CH2): 1 Carbon, 2 Hydrogens
