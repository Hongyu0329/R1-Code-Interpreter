    "To solve this problem, I will first visually identify the synchronized bursts in the provided raster plot. A synchronized burst is characterized by a high density of firing events across many electrodes within a short time window, appearing as a vertical band in the graph. Then, I will calculate the time interval between each consecutive burst. Finally, I will compute the average of these inter-burst intervals and round the result to two significant figures.\n\n1.  **Identify Burst Timestamps**: I will inspect the x-axis (Time (s)) to find the approximate center time of each major vertical band of activity.\n    *   The first burst is centered at approximately 3 seconds.\n    *   The second burst is centered at approximately 18 seconds.\n    *   The third burst is centered at approximately 36 seconds.\n    *   The fourth burst is centered at approximately 49 seconds.\n\n2.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**: I will calculate the time difference between the identified consecutive bursts.\n    *   Interval 1 = 18 s - 3 s = 15 s\n    *   Interval 2 = 36 s - 18 s = 18 s\n    *   Interval 3 = 49 s - 36 s = 13 s\n\n3.  **Calculate and Round the Average IBI**: I will average the intervals and round the result to two significant figures.\n    *   Average = (15 + 18 + 13) / 3 = 46 / 3 â‰ˆ 15.33 s\n    *   Rounding 15.33 to two significant figures gives 15.\n\nThe following Python code will perform and document these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_average_ibi():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies timestamps of synchronized bursts from a raster plot,\n    calculates the inter-burst intervals (IBI), and computes the average IBI.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify the timestamps of the synchronized bursts from the graph.\n    # These are the approximate times (in seconds) where dense vertical bands of activity are observed.\n    burst_timestamps = [3, 18, 36, 49]\n    print(f\"Step 1: The identified timestamps of the synchronized bursts are {burst_timestamps[0]} s, {burst_timestamps[1]} s, {burst_timestamps[2]} s, and {burst_timestamps[3]} s.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (the time between consecutive bursts).\n    inter_burst_intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs).\")\n    for i in range(len(inter_burst_intervals)):\n        t1 = burst_timestamps[i]\n        t2 = burst_timestamps[i+1]\n        interval = inter_burst_intervals[i]\n        print(f\"  Interval {i+1}: {t2} s - {t1} s = {interval} s\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the average inter-burst interval.\n    average_ibi = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the average IBI.\")\n    # Display the full calculation equation\n    interval_sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, inter_burst_intervals))\n    print(f\"  Average IBI = ({interval_sum_str}) / {len(inter_burst_intervals)}\")\n    print(f\"  Average IBI = {sum(inter_burst_intervals)} / {len(inter_burst_intervals)} = {average_ibi:.4f} s\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Step 4: Round the average IBI to two significant figures.\n    # For a number like 15.33..., the first two significant digits are 1 and 5.\n    final_answer = float('{:.2g}'.format(average_ibi))\n    print(\"Step 4: Round the result to two significant figures.\")\n    print(f\"The average inter-burst interval is {final_answer} s.\")\n    \n    return final_answer\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_average_ibi()\n\n```\n<<<15>>>"
