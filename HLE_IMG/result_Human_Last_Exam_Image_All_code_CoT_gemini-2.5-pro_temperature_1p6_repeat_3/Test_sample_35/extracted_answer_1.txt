The protein S100B binds to the RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts). It can be used as a prognostic marker because its levels directly correlate with the severity of key pathological outcomes like neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and apoptosis, thus helping to predict the progression and future course of the neurological disorder.
