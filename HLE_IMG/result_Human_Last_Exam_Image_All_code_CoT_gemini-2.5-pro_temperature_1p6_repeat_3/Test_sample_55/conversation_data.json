    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for the chord.\n\n1.  **Identify the Key:** The key signature has one flat (B♭), and the piece is titled \"Fantasy in D minor\". This establishes the tonic as D minor.\n\n2.  **Identify the Notes:** In measure 8, the circled chord contains the following notes played simultaneously:\n    *   Left Hand: E, G\n    *   Right Hand: G, B♭\n    *   The complete set of notes is E, G, and B♭.\n\n3.  **Determine the Chord's Root and Quality:**\n    *   When we stack these notes in thirds, we get E - G - B♭.\n    *   The interval from E to G is a minor third.\n    *   The interval from G to B♭ is also a minor third.\n    *   A triad built with two minor thirds is a **diminished triad**. The root of this chord is E.\n\n4.  **Relate the Chord to the Key:**\n    *   The key is D minor. The D natural minor scale is D, E, F, G, A, B♭, C.\n    *   The root of our chord, E, is the second scale degree (the supertonic) of D minor.\n    *   In a minor key, the triad built on the supertonic is typically a diminished chord.\n\n5.  **Construct the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   The Roman numeral for the second scale degree is **ii**. We use lowercase because it's a diminished chord (and not a major chord).\n    *   To indicate a diminished quality, we add a diminished symbol: **°**.\n    *   The lowest note played is E, which is the root, so the chord is in root position. No inversion figures are needed.\n\nTherefore, the correct Roman numeral for the chord E-G-B♭ in the key of D minor is **ii°**.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_chord():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the chord in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor.\n    \"\"\"\n    key = \"D minor\"\n    notes_in_chord = [\"E\", \"G\", \"B-flat\"]\n    root = \"E\"\n    quality = \"diminished\"\n    \n    # The scale degrees in a minor key are: i, ii°, III, iv, v, VI, VII\n    # (Using natural minor for this analysis)\n    d_minor_scale = {\n        \"D\": \"i (tonic)\",\n        \"E\": \"ii (supertonic)\",\n        \"F\": \"III (mediant)\",\n        \"G\": \"iv (subdominant)\",\n        \"A\": \"v (dominant)\",\n        \"B-flat\": \"VI (submediant)\",\n        \"C\": \"VII (subtonic)\"\n    }\n    \n    scale_degree_number = \"ii\"\n    quality_symbol = \"°\"\n    \n    roman_numeral = f\"{scale_degree_number}{quality_symbol}\"\n    \n    print(\"Music Theory Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"1.
