# Accurate animal re-identification relies on matching unique and stable features.
# For these nyalas, the most distinctive feature is the pattern of white spots on their flanks.

# 1. Observation of the Target Image:
# The target nyala has a specific pattern of spots on its rear flank.
# There is a prominent cluster of three spots forming a small, distinct triangle high on the hip.
# There are also other, less prominent spots scattered below this main cluster.

# 2. Comparison with Options:
# We compare this unique spot pattern with the patterns on the nyalas in images A through F.
# - Image A: A different, younger individual.
# - Image C: Different coloration and build.
# - Image D: The spot pattern does not match the target's triangular cluster.
# - Image E: The spot pattern is different.
# - Image F: Obscured, but what is visible does not clearly match.
# - Image B: The spot pattern on the hip is a perfect match to the target. The triangular cluster of three spots is clearly visible and identical.

# 3. Conclusion:
# The identical spot pattern serves as a fingerprint, confirming that the nyala in Image B is the same as the target.
