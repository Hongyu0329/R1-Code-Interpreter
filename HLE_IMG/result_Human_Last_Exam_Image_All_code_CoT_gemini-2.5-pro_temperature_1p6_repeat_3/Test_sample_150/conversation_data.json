    "Here is my plan to solve the chemical reaction puzzle:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** The first reaction involves benzene, propanoyl chloride, and AlCl₃. This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation, which will attach the propanoyl group to the benzene ring, forming **Intermediate-1**, which is 1-phenylpropan-1-one (propiophenone).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination.** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone) is then reacted with Br₂ and FeBr₃. The acyl group on the ring is a meta-director. Therefore, a bromine atom will be added to the meta position of the benzene ring, yielding **Intermediate-2**, 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Catalytic Reduction.** Intermediate-2 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with H₂ and a Palladium catalyst. This powerful reduction will do two things:\n    *   Reduce the benzylic ketone group (C=O) to a methylene group (CH₂).\n    *   Reduce the aryl bromide (C-Br) to a C-H bond via hydrogenolysis.\n    The result is **Intermediate-3**, which is propylbenzene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Free-Radical Bromination.** Finally, Intermediate-3 (propylbenzene) is treated with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) and a radical initiator ((PhCO₂)₂). This reagent combination is specific for bromination at the benzylic position (the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring), as the benzylic radical is the most stable radical that can be formed. This results in the **Final Product**, (1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\nI will now write a Python script that programmatically follows these steps and prints the name of each intermediate and the final product.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemical_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script tracks the transformations in a multi-step organic synthesis\n    to identify the name of the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation\n    reactant_1 = \"Benzene\"\n    reagent_1 = \"Propanoyl chloride / AlCl3\"\n    intermediate_1 = \"Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one)\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation\")\n    print(f\"   Reactant: {reactant_1}\")\n    print(f\"   Reagent: {reagent_1}\")\n    print(f\"   Product (Intermediate-1): {intermediate_1}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination\n    reactant_2 = intermediate_1\n    reagent_2 = \"Br2 / FeBr3\"\n    intermediate_2 = \"1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\"\n    print(\"Step 2: Electrophilic Bromination\")\n    print(f\"   Reactant: {reactant_2}\")\n    print(f\"   Reagent: {reagent_2}\")\n    print(f\"   Description: The acyl group is a meta-director.\")\n    print(f\"   Product (Intermediate-2): {intermediate_2}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation\n    reactant_3 = intermediate_2\n    reagent_3 = \"H2 / Pd\"\n    intermediate_3 = \"Propylbenzene\"\n    print(\"Step 3: Catalytic Reduction\")\n    print(f\"   Reactant: {reactant_3}\")\n    print(f\"   Reagent: {reagent_3}\")\n    print(f\"   Description: The ketone is reduced to an alkane and the aryl bromide is removed (hydrogenolysis).\")\n    print(f\"   Product (Intermediate-3): {intermediate_3}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 4: Free-Radical Bromination\n    reactant_4 = intermediate_3\n    reagent_4 = \"NBS / (PhCO2)2, CCl4\"\n    final_product = \"(1-Bromopropyl)benzene\"\n    print(\"Step 4: Free-Radical Benzylic Bromination\")\n    print(f\"   Reactant: {reactant_4}\")\n    print(f\"   Reagent: {reagent_4}\")\n    print(f\"   Description: NBS selectively brominates the most stable radical position, which is the benzylic position.\")\n    print(f\"   Product (Final Product): {final_product}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_chemical_reaction()\n```\n<<<(1-Bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
