    This function returns the IUPAC name of the product from the given reaction scheme.
    
    The reaction sequence involves:
    1. A Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons (HWE) reaction to form an alpha-phosphono-alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.
    2. A domino reaction sequence: a Michael addition of mercaptoacetaldehyde followed by an intramolecular HWE cyclization.
    
    The final product is a substituted 2,5-dihydrothiophene.
    The numbers in the name are:
    - 2,5: Indicate the positions of saturation in the dihydrothiophene ring.
    - 4: Indicates the position of the carboxylate group.
