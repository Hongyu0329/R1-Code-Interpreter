    "This task requires identifying the chemical compound from its structure. The compound shown is a tetracyclic alkaloid containing a lactam (a cyclic amide) group. This specific structure belongs to a well-known natural product.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the common name of the alkaloid from its chemical structure.\n2.  Write a simple Python script to print this name, as requested by the prompt format.\n\nThe compound is **Matrine**.\n\n```python\ndef identify_alkaloid():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the alkaloid compound\n    represented by the provided chemical structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The compound is a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid.\n    # It is commonly found in plants from the Sophora genus.\n    compound_name = \"Matrine\"\n    print(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n\nidentify_alkaloid()\n```\n<<<Matrine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
