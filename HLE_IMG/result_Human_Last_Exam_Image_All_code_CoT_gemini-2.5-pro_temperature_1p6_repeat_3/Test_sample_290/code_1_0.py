    This function identifies the city from the provided image.
    
    The visual clues in the image are:
    1. A beach scene at sunset.
    2. A bonfire on the beach, which is only permitted in specific locations.
    3. A treeline and body of water characteristic of the Pacific Northwest.
    4. A chain-link fence in the foreground, suggesting a public viewpoint.

    These clues strongly point to Golden Gardens Park in Seattle, Washington, which is a well-known location for beach bonfires with views matching the photo.
