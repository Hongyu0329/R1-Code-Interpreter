    "The images show a time-lapse sequence (L, M, and N) of a biological process occurring in a filamentous organism, most likely a fungal hypha.\n\nHere is a step-by-step description of what is happening:\n\n1.  **Image L:** This image shows a segment of the filament composed of several cells separated by cross-walls (septa). The structure is growing from its tip (apical growth). The arrowhead points to a septum in a sub-apical cell (a cell behind the tip cell).\n2.  **Image M:** A new point of growth, a small bulge or protrusion, has started to form on the side of the sub-apical cell. The arrowhead points to this initiating branch.\n3.  **Image N:** This new protrusion has elongated and developed into a new filament, forming a distinct lateral branch. The arrowhead now points to the junction where the new branch originates from the main filament.\n\nThis entire sequence depicts the process of **lateral branch formation**, a key mechanism by which filamentous fungi expand and form an interconnected network called a mycelium.\n\n<<<The process depicted is the formation of a lateral branch from a fungal hypha.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
