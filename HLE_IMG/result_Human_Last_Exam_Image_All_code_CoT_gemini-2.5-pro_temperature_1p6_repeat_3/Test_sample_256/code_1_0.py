    Analyzes the image to find a symbol not related to ancient Southwest cultures.
    """
    # Step 1: Analyze the image content. The image contains numerous pictographs in a style
    # consistent with ancient Southwest art (e.g., Pecos River Style). These include
    # anthropomorphic (human-like) figures, often interpreted as shamans, animal figures,
    # and geometric patterns like sunbursts and zig-zags.

    # Step 2: Search for an anomaly. Upon careful inspection of the upper-right quadrant
    # of the image, there are two distinct characters painted that do not match the style
    # or origin of the other pictographs.

    # Step 3: Identify the anomalous symbol. These characters are clearly the letters 'R' and 'O'
    # from the Latin alphabet. This alphabet was introduced to the Americas by Europeans and was
    # not used by the indigenous cultures who created the original rock art.

    # Step 4: Evaluate the claim. The presence of the letters 'RO', likely modern graffiti,
    # confirms that there is at least one symbol not related to the original cultures.
    # While 'RO' itself isn't a universally recognized religious symbol, letters are fundamental
    # to writing names and religious concepts from other cultures (like Christianity) that were
    # foreign to the creators of the pictographs. Therefore, the statement is true.

    is_true = True
    symbol = "the letters 'RO'"

    # Step 5: Formulate and print the final answer.
    print(f"True. It is possible to distinguish at least one symbol not related to these cultures.")
    print(f"The symbol consists of {symbol}, which can be seen in the upper-right section of the image.")
    print("These letters are from the Latin alphabet, which was unknown to the ancient Southwest cultures that created the original pictographs. They are likely modern graffiti.")
