# Step 1-4: Theoretical Derivation
# The projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction
# results in a centered rectangular lattice.
# The axes of the rectangle can be aligned with the [001] and [1-10] crystal directions.
# Let H be the height of the unit rectangle (along [001]).
# Let W be the width of the unit rectangle (along [1-10]).

# The repeat distance along [001] is the lattice constant 'a'.
H = 1 # We can set a=1 for calculating the ratio.

# The repeat distance along [1-10] is the length of the vector a*(1,-1,0).
W = math.sqrt(1**2 + (-1)**2 + 0**2) # using a=1

# Calculate the aspect ratio
aspect_ratio = W / H

print("Theoretical aspect ratio W/H of the projected unit cell:")
print(f"H (length along [001]) = a")
print(f"W (length along [1-10]) = a * sqrt(2)")
print(f"Aspect Ratio W/H = (a * sqrt(2)) / a = {aspect_ratio:.3f}")
print("")

# Step 5: Analysis of Image B
# From visual inspection and coordinate estimation from the grid.
# We identify a potential centered rectangular unit cell in image B.
# Approximate corner coordinates: (1, 2.5), (9, 2.5), (1, 7.5), (9, 7.5)
# Approximate center coordinate: (5, 5)
W_b = 9 - 1
H_b = 7.5 - 2.5
aspect_ratio_b = W_b / H_b

print("Measured aspect ratio for Image B:")
print(f"Width (W) = {W_b}")
print(f"Height (H) = {H_b}")
print(f"Aspect Ratio W/H = {W_b} / {H_b} = {aspect_ratio_b:.3f}")
print("\nThe measured ratio from image B (1.600) is close to the theoretical value of sqrt(2) (~1.414).")
print("Image B shows a centered rectangle that is wider than it is tall, which matches the theory.")
print("Image A appears taller than wide. Therefore, B is the correct answer.")
