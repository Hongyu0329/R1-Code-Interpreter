    "To determine which pattern represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the FCC lattice structure:** An FCC lattice consists of atoms at the corners of a cube and at the center of each of its six faces. We can define the lattice constant as 'a'.\n\n2.  **Define the viewing direction and projection plane:** We are viewing the crystal along the [110] direction. The plane of projection is perpendicular to this direction. A convenient choice for the axes on this plane is the [001] direction and the [1-10] direction. Let's align the vertical axis (y-axis of our projection) with the [001] crystal direction and the horizontal axis (x-axis of our projection) with the [1-10] crystal direction.\n\n3.  **Determine the projected pattern:**\n    *   The projection of the 3D FCC lattice onto this 2D plane results in a 2D pattern. It is a known result in crystallography that this projection yields a **centered rectangular lattice**.\n    *   This immediately eliminates options C and D, which show simple rectangular lattices (atoms only at the corners of the rectangles), not centered ones. The choice is between A and B.\n\n4.  **Calculate the aspect ratio of the unit rectangle:** To distinguish between A and B, we need to find the aspect ratio of the sides of the unit rectangle in the projected pattern.\n    *   The side length of the unit rectangle along our chosen vertical axis ([001] direction) corresponds to the shortest repeat distance of the FCC lattice in that direction. This distance is simply the lattice constant, `a`. So, the height (H) of the unit rectangle is `a`.\n    *   The side length along our horizontal axis ([1-10] direction) corresponds to the shortest repeat distance in that direction. The shortest lattice vector (a vector connecting two equivalent atoms) in the [1-10] direction is `a[1, -1, 0]`. Its length is `sqrt(a^2 + (-a)^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(2a^2) = a√2`. So, the width (W) of the unit rectangle is `a√2`.\n    *   The aspect ratio of the projected unit rectangle is `W / H = (a√2) / a = √2`.\n\n5.  **Compare with the given images:**\n    *   The value of √2 is approximately 1.414.\n    *   This means the unit rectangle should be wider than it is tall by a factor of about 1.414.\n    *   Visually inspecting image **A**, the pattern seems taller than it is wide.\n    *   Visually inspecting image **B**, the pattern seems wider than it is tall. Let's verify this with a rough measurement assuming the grid lines are spaced by 1 unit.\n        *   In image B, we can identify a rectangular unit cell with corners that have atoms. For instance, consider the rectangle with corners approximately at (1, 2.5), (9, 2.5), (1, 7.5), and (9, 7.5).\n        *   The center of this rectangle would be at (5, 5). The image shows an atom very close to this position, confirming the centered rectangular structure.\n        *   The width of this rectangle is `W = 9 - 1 = 8`.\n        *   The height is `H = 7.5 - 2.5 = 5`.\n        *   The aspect ratio is `W / H = 8 / 5 = 1.6`.\n    *   This measured ratio (1.6) is reasonably close to the theoretical value of √2 ≈ 1.414. The difference can be attributed to the drawing's perspective and slight inaccuracies.\n\nTherefore, image B correctly represents the FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1-4: Theoretical Derivation\n# The projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction\n# results in a centered rectangular lattice.\n# The axes of the rectangle can be aligned with the [001] and [1-10] crystal directions.\n# Let H be the height of the unit rectangle (along [001]).\n# Let W be the width of the unit rectangle (along [1-10]).\n\n# The repeat distance along [001] is the lattice constant 'a'.\nH = 1 # We can set a=1 for calculating the ratio.\n\n# The repeat distance along [1-10] is the length of the vector a*(1,-1,0).\nW = math.sqrt(1**2 + (-1)**2 + 0**2) # using a=1\n\n# Calculate the aspect ratio\naspect_ratio = W / H\n\nprint(\"Theoretical aspect ratio W/H of the projected unit cell:\")\nprint(f\"H (length along [001]) = a\")\nprint(f\"W (length along [1-10]) = a * sqrt(2)\")\nprint(f\"Aspect Ratio W/H = (a * sqrt(2)) / a = {aspect_ratio:.3f}\")\nprint(\"\")\n\n# Step 5: Analysis of Image B\n# From visual inspection and coordinate estimation from the grid.\n# We identify a potential centered rectangular unit cell in image B.\n# Approximate corner coordinates: (1, 2.5), (9, 2.5), (1, 7.5), (9, 7.5)\n# Approximate center coordinate: (5, 5)\nW_b = 9 - 1\nH_b = 7.5 - 2.5\naspect_ratio_b = W_b / H_b\n\nprint(\"Measured aspect ratio for Image B:\")\nprint(f\"Width (W) = {W_b}\")\nprint(f\"Height (H) = {H_b}\")\nprint(f\"Aspect Ratio W/H = {W_b} / {H_b} = {aspect_ratio_b:.3f}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe measured ratio from image B (1.600) is close to the theoretical value of sqrt(2) (~1.414).\")\nprint(\"Image B shows a centered rectangle that is wider than it is tall, which matches the theory.\")\nprint(\"Image A appears taller than wide.
