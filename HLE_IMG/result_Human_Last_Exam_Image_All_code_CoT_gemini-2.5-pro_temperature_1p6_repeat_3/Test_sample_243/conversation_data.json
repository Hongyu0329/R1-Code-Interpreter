    "My analysis of the image reveals a plant with distinctive dark green leaves and a prominent white, reticulated (net-like) vein pattern. This striking feature is characteristic of the species *Debregeasia healeana*.\n\nTo answer your question, I will identify the island to which this plant is endemic.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
