    "My plan is to analyze the distinctive elements within the surrealist painting to identify the artwork and its creator. I will conduct a search using keywords that describe the unique and disparate scenes depicted, such as \"surrealist painting,\" \"ocean flooding into a room,\" \"books burning in a fireplace,\" \"hot air balloon,\" and \"Leaning Tower of Pisa.\" This will allow me to pinpoint the title of the painting and, consequently, its artist. Once the artist is identified, I will output the name using a Python script.\n\n```python\n# The painting is a work of surrealism, filled with symbolic and dream-like imagery.\n# By searching for key elements like \"surrealist painting room with ocean\" or \"painting burning books in fireplace,\"\n# we can identify the artwork.\n# This specific painting is titled \"Au Bonheur des Dames\" (To the Happiness of Ladies), created in 1956.\n# The artist is a famous Spanish-Mexican surrealist painter.\n\nartist_name = \"Remedios Varo\"\nprint(artist_name)\n```\n<<<Remedios Varo>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Please name the artist of the following painting:\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
