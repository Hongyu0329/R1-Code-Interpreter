# The task is to identify the bird in the target image from a set of options.
# By carefully comparing the distinct scalloped feather pattern on the back,
# the posture, and the lighting conditions, we can find the matching individual.

# Analysis of the target bird:
# - A distinct scalloped pattern on the back and wings.
# - The head is turned slightly to its right.
# - Lighting comes from the right, making that side brighter.
# - A specific, slightly irregular arrangement of feathers on the upper back.

# Comparison with options:
# - A, B, D, E, F, G, H, I all show some differences in pattern, lighting, angle, or coloration.
# - Image C shows a bird with the identical posture, lighting, and, most importantly,
#   the exact same scalloped feather pattern on the back as the target bird.
#   The minor irregularities in the pattern are a perfect match.

# The correct image is C.
