    "The element with these spectral lines is **Uranium (U)**.\n\nEach chemical element has a unique emission spectrum, which acts as a \"fingerprint.\" The image provided shows a particularly dense and complex pattern of spectral lines across the visible spectrum. This high density of lines is a known characteristic of the emission spectrum for uranium.\n\nUranium is a silvery-grey metallic element with atomic number 92. It is naturally occurring and weakly radioactive. Its discovery in 1789 is credited to the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who named it after the planet Uranus, which had been discovered just a few years earlier. The metal itself was first isolated in 1841 by Eugène-Melchior Péligot. Later, in 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered its radioactive properties.\n\nSome key properties and uses of uranium include:\n*   **High Density:** Uranium is a very dense metal, about 1.7 times denser than lead.\n*   **Nuclear Fuel:** Its most significant contemporary use is as a fuel for nuclear power plants and for nuclear weapons. The isotope uranium-235 is fissile, meaning it can sustain a nuclear chain reaction, releasing enormous amounts of energy.\n*   **Other Uses:** Depleted uranium is used in kinetic energy penetrators, armor plating, and as a shielding material against other radiation due to its high density. Historically, it was used as a colorant for glass and ceramic glazes, producing yellow or orange-red colors.\n\nThe specific spectrum shown, with its multitude of emission lines, has been identified in various scientific databases and publications as that of uranium.\n\n<<<Uranium>>>"
