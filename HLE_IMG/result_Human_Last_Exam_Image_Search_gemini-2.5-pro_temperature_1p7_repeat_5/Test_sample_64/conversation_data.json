    "The process depicted in the image, showing a sequence from L to N, is cell fusion between adjacent cells in a fungal hypha. This process is also known as anastomosis.\n\nThe image shows a microscopic view of a filamentous fungus, likely a species such as *Aspergillus nidulans* or *Neurospora crassa*, which are common models for studying this phenomenon.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the stages shown:\n*   **Panel L:** Two adjacent hyphal compartments (cells) are separated by a cross-wall called a septum. The arrowhead points to this intact septum.\n*   **Panel M:** The process of fusion begins. The septum starts to break down, and one cell begins to bulge into the adjacent cell. This bulging is often driven by a difference in turgor pressure, where the healthier cell with higher pressure expands into a damaged or dying cell with lower pressure.\n*   **Panel N:** The septum has largely dissolved, allowing the cytoplasm of the two cells to merge. The fusion creates a continuous, interconnected filament, which is a characteristic feature of mycelial networks in fungi.\n\nThis cell-to-cell fusion is a fundamental process in the life of filamentous fungi. It is crucial for creating an interconnected mycelial network that allows for the efficient transport of water, nutrients, and signaling molecules throughout the colony. The fusion process involves complex signaling between the cells, cell wall remodeling, and the merging of plasma membranes.\n\n<<<cell fusion (anastomosis) in a fungal hypha>>>"
