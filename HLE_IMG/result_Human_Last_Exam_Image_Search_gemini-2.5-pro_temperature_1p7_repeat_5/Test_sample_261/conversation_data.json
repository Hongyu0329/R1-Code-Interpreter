    "The title of the book that has the presented fragment on the cover is **\"The Fantasy Worlds of Peter S. Beagle\"**.\n\nThe image fragment is a detail from the cover art of the 1978 omnibus edition, which includes the novel \"The Last Unicorn.\" The artwork features a glowing, ethereal unicorn running past a prominent, warmly lit structure against a dark background, which is consistent with the provided image. This omnibus contains several of Peter S. Beagle's fantasy works, including \"The Last Unicorn,\" \"A Fine and Private Place,\" and others.\n\nSeveral editions of \"The Last Unicorn\" have been published over the years with a wide variety of cover art, but the specific image in question is from this particular 1978 omnibus publication.\n\n<<<The Fantasy Worlds of Peter S. Beagle>>>"
