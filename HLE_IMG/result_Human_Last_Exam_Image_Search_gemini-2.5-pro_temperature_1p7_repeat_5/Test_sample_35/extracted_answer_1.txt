Based on the provided diagram, the S100B protein exhibits a strong affinity for the **V and C1 domains** of the **RAGE receptor**. This protein can be used as a **prognostic marker** because its interaction with RAGE directly initiates downstream pathways (such as NFÎºB activation) that lead to neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. This direct causal link to disease progression allows it to predict the future course and severity of the pathology, which is the function of a prognostic marker.
