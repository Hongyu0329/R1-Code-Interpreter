    "This image displays the **crystal structure of the TRAF domain of human TRAF2 in a complex with a peptide from the CD40 receptor**. The protein data bank (PDB) entry for this structure is 1QSC.\n\nThe larger, dark blue portion of the structure is the TRAF (TNF receptor-associated factor) domain of TRAF2. The smaller, light blue portion is a peptide derived from the cytoplasmic domain of the CD40 receptor.\n\nTRAF2 is an adapter protein that is part of the TNF receptor-associated factor family. These proteins are crucial for mediating signal transduction from members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily. Specifically, TRAF2 is involved in activating key signaling pathways like MAPK8/JNK and NF-ÎºB in response to TNF-alpha. It does this by binding to the cytoplasmic domains of receptors, a process illustrated in this structure where it is complexed with a part of the CD40 receptor.\n\n<<<TRAF2 (Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2)>>>"
