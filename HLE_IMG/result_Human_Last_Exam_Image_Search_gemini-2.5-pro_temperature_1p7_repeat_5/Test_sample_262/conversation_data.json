    "To determine which of the depicted complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), we must analyze their molecular structures and relate them to known degradation pathways of iridium(III) emitters.\n\n### Structural Analysis of the Complexes\n\nAll four complexes share a common architecture: they are cationic iridium(III) complexes with the general formula `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+`, where:\n*   **Ir** is the central iridium ion.\n*   **C^N** represents a cyclometalating phenylpyridine-type ligand. The complexes differ in the fluorine substitution pattern on this ligand.\n*   **N^N** is the ancillary ligand, which is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dtbbpy) for all four complexes.\n*   **PF6-** is the counterion.\n\nThe key difference between the four complexes lies in the fluorination of the phenyl ring of the C^N ligands. Assuming each complex contains two identical C^N ligands, the substitution patterns are as follows:\n\n*   **Complex 1:** The C^N ligand is 2-(4,5-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has two fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring, but none at the critical 2'-position (ortho to the Ir-C bond).\n*   **Complex 2:** The C^N ligand is 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has a single fluorine atom at the 4'-position (para to the Ir-C bond).\n*   **Complex 3:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It features a crucial fluorine atom at the 2'-position.\n*   **Complex 4:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine, the ligand used in the well-known stable blue emitter FIrpic. It has fluorine atoms at both the 2'- and 4'-positions.\n\n### Impact of Fluorination on Emitter Lifetime\n\nThe operational stability of iridium complexes in LECs is a major challenge. Degradation often occurs from a non-emissive, metal-centered (³MC) excited state. This state can be populated from the emissive triplet state, and its population leads to the distortion and eventual breaking of the metal-ligand bonds, particularly the vital Ir-C bond.\n\nFluorination of the C^N ligand is a widely used strategy to enhance emitter stability, but the position of the fluorine atom is critical:\n*   **Fluorination at the 4'- or 5'-positions (para/meta to the Ir-C bond):** Fluorine's strong electron-withdrawing nature stabilizes the molecule's frontier orbitals. This generally increases the oxidation potential and can strengthen the Ir-C bond, contributing to improved stability.\n*   **Fluorination at the 2'-position (ortho to the Ir-C bond):** This specific substitution has a profound effect on stability. It is understood to sterically protect the vulnerable Ir-C bond and, more importantly, to raise the energy of the destructive ³MC excited state. This makes it harder for the molecule to access this degradation pathway, leading to significantly enhanced operational lifetimes.\n\n### Evaluating the Complexes\n\nBased on this understanding, we can predict the relative stabilities:\n\n*   **Complexes 3 and 4** both contain a fluorine atom at the 2'-position. They are therefore expected to benefit from the significant stabilization imparted by *ortho*-fluorination and exhibit longer operational lifetimes. Complex 4, with an additional fluorine at the 4'-position, is expected to be particularly stable.\n*   **Complexes 1 and 2** lack the 2'-fluorine substituent. While their fluorine atoms do provide some electronic stabilization compared to a non-fluorinated equivalent, they do not benefit from the unique protective effect of *ortho*-fluorination. Consequently, they are more susceptible to degradation via the ³MC state and are expected to show shorter lifetimes in LEC devices.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe complexes that are expected to show shorter lifetimes are those without fluorine atoms at the 2'-position of the phenylpyridine ligand. These are **Complex 1** and **Complex 2**.\n\n<<<E>>>"
