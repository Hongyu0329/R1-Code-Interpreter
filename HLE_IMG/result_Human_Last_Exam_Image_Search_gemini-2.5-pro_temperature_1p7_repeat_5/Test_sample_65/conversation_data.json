    "The bryophyte depicted in the image, characterized by its slender, braided, or rope-like stems, belongs to the genus *Pterigynandrum*.\n\nThis appearance is due to the plant's somewhat curved, ovate leaves that are pressed against the stem. A representative species with these distinct features is *Pterigynandrum filiforme*, also known as Capillary Wing-moss. It typically grows on rocks or tree bark.\n\n<<<Pterigynandrum>>>"
