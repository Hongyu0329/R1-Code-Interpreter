    "The molecule shown in the image is **cyclocarbon**.\n\nIt is an allotrope of carbon with the molecular formula C₁₈. The molecule consists of a ring of 18 carbon atoms connected by alternating single and triple bonds. This structure makes it a polyyne and a cyclocarbon.\n\nFor many years, the precise structure of cyclocarbon was a subject of debate, with scientists discussing whether the atoms were linked by alternating single and triple bonds or by consecutive double bonds (a cumulene structure). In 2019, researchers at IBM and the University of Oxford successfully synthesized and characterized the molecule for the first time. Using high-resolution atomic force microscopy, they confirmed that the structure consists of alternating single and triple bonds.\n\nThe synthesis was achieved by removing carbon monoxide (CO) groups from a precursor molecule, C₂₄O₆, on an inert salt surface at very low temperatures (around 5 Kelvin). A later synthesis method in 2020 demonstrated a higher yield by using a C₁₈Br₆ precursor.\n\nCyclocarbon is the smallest cyclo[n]carbon predicted to be relatively stable. Due to its high reactivity, it is challenging to isolate. Researchers are exploring its potential for creating other carbon-rich materials and its possible applications in molecular electronics.\n\n<<<cyclocarbon>>>"
