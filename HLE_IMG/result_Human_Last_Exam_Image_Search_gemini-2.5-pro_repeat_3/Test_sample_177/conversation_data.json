    "To determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we will calculate the total VMT for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios and then find the percentage difference.\n\nVMT is calculated by multiplying the number of vehicle trips by the average trip distance. Since the data is provided in shares, we will calculate a VMT index, which represents the average vehicle miles per trip across the entire system.\n\n### **1. Calculate Baseline Car VMT**\n\nFirst, we calculate the total share of car trips (car, 1 occupant + car, with more than 2 occupants) for each distance category in the Baseline scenario (Table 1).\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** 25% + 28% = 53%\n*   **3-5 miles:** 38% + 43% = 81%\n*   **5-10 miles:** 40% + 45% = 85%\n*   **10+ miles:** 42% + 47% = 89%\n\nNext, we calculate the VMT contribution from each distance category by multiplying the share of total trips, the share of car trips for that distance, and the average trip distance.\n\n*   **VMT for 0-3 miles:** 0.48 (share of total trips) × 0.53 (car mode share) × 1 mile = 0.2544\n*   **VMT for 3-5 miles:** 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 miles = 0.7128\n*   **VMT for 5-10 miles:** 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 miles = 0.8925\n*   **VMT for 10+ miles:** 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 miles = 2.8480\n\n**Total Baseline Car VMT Index = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = 4.7077**\n\n### **2. Calculate Proposed Car VMT**\n\nWe repeat the same calculation for the Proposed scenario (Table 2).\n\nFirst, the total share of car trips for each distance category:\n*   **0-3 miles:** 1% + 2% = 3%\n*   **3-5 miles:** 8% + 19% = 27%\n*   **5-10 miles:** 14% + 27% = 41%\n*   **10+ miles:** 16% + 33% = 49%\n\nNext, we calculate the VMT contribution from each distance category:\n*   **VMT for 0-3 miles:** 0.48 × 0.03 × 1 mile = 0.0144\n*   **VMT for 3-5 miles:** 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 miles = 0.2376\n*   **VMT for 5-10 miles:** 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 miles = 0.4305\n*   **VMT for 10+ miles:** 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 miles = 1.5680\n\n**Total Proposed Car VMT Index = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = 2.2505**\n\n### **3. Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage reduction using the VMT indices from the Baseline and Proposed scenarios.\n\n*   **VMT Reduction:** 4.7077 (Baseline) - 2.2505 (Proposed) = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction:** (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100% ≈ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the percentage of Car VMT that can be reduced is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
