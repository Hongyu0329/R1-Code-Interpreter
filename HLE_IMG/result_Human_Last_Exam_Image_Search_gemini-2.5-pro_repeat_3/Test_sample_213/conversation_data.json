    "The sheet music provided is the opening of Richard Strauss's opera *Salome*.\n\nThe opera, which is in one act, is based on the 1891 French play *Salomé* by Oscar Wilde, with the German libretto translated by Hedwig Lachmann. The score is notable for its large and exotic orchestration, which includes instruments like the heckelphone, celesta, and organ to create a distinctive and atmospheric sound world. The music in the image, with its specific instrumentation including English Horn (\"engl. Horn\"), and musical directions in German such as \"(Vorhang)\" for the curtain to rise and \"(mit Dämpfer)\" for using a mute, are all characteristic of Strauss's detailed scoring. The opera premiered in Dresden on December 9, 1905.\n\n<<<Salome>>>"
