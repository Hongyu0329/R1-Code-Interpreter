    "B.\n\nThe face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, when viewed along the crystallographic direction, exhibits a distinctive atomic pattern. The projection of the atoms onto the (110) plane forms a **centered rectangular lattice**.\n\nLet's analyze the provided images to identify this pattern:\n*   **Image A and D:** These images show atoms arranged in a simple rectangular grid. There are atoms at the corners of the rectangles, but not in the centers. This does not match the expected pattern for an FCC view.\n*   **Image C:** The atomic arrangement in this image does not form a repeating centered rectangular pattern.\n*   **Image B:** This image correctly depicts a centered rectangular pattern. We can identify unit cells where atoms are located at the four corners of a rectangle, with another atom situated in the center of that rectangle. For instance, considering a rectangle formed by atoms at the approximate coordinates (1, 5.5), (7, 5.5), (1, 8.5), and (7, 8.5), there is a corresponding atom at its center, (4, 7). This repeating centered-rectangular motif is the characteristic signature of an FCC structure viewed along the direction.\n\nTherefore, image B represents the face-centered cubic structure viewed along the direction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
