    "Based on an analysis of the score and harmonic context, the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata is **V6/5 / v**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the analysis:\n*   **Key Signature:** The sonata's home key is C minor.\n*   **Local Key:** The passage leading up to measure 30 modulates to G minor, which is the dominant minor (v) of C minor.\n*   **Chord Analysis:** Measure 30 contains the notes D (in the bass), and F-sharp, A, and C in the right hand. These notes form a D dominant 7th chord (D-F#-A-C).\n*   **Chord Inversion:** With the D in the bass, the chord is in root position as far as the D7 is concerned. However, the full notation is V6/5 because it's the first inversion of a dominant 7th chord. In this context, the chord is D7, the dominant of G.\n*   **Function:** Since G minor is the dominant (v) of the home key (C minor), the D7 chord is functioning as the dominant of the dominant.\n*   **Roman Numeral:** This \"dominant of the dominant\" function is notated as a secondary dominant, written as V6/5 of v, or V6/5/v.\n\nThis analysis is consistent with standard harmonic practice in the Classical period. The use of secondary dominants is a common technique to create tension and lead strongly to a new key area."
