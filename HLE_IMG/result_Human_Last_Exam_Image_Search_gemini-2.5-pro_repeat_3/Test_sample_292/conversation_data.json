    "This picture was taken in the city of **Winnipeg, Canada**.\n\nThe photograph displays the distinctive interior of the **RBC Convention Centre**. The most prominent feature is the unique geometric ceiling of the \"City Room,\" an iconic space within the convention center's expansion. This ceiling is composed of 324 identical suspended modules that form a pattern inspired by ice crystals and floe patterns.\n\nThe design, a collaboration between LMN Architects, LM Architectural Group, and Number TEN Architects, features a large, glazed connection that bridges York Avenue, offering dramatic views of the downtown area. The expansion, completed in 2015, nearly doubled the size of the facility and includes the visually striking City View Room with its floor-to-ceiling windows. The ceiling's intricate, dynamically lit armature creates a dramatic effect visible both from within the event space and from the street below.\n\n<<<Winnipeg>>>"
