    "The Google Trends graph displays recurring annual search interest for three distinct historical events, and the pattern of these peaks strongly indicates the country in question is the **United States**.\n\nThe evidence lies in the specific timing of the search spikes, which correspond to major anniversaries and holidays in American history, particularly within African American history.\n\n*   **The Red Line (Peaks in January and June):** This line shows two major spikes each year.\n    *   The first peak occurs in January, which aligns with **Martin Luther King Jr. Day**, a U.S. federal holiday observed on the third Monday of January. Search interest in Dr. King and the Civil Rights Movement consistently rises during this time.\n    *   The second peak is in June, corresponding with **Juneteenth** (June 19), which commemorates the end of slavery in the United States. Search interest in Juneteenth saw a dramatic and sustained increase following the events of 2020 and its designation as a federal holiday in 2021.\n\n*   **The Yellow Line (Peak in late August/early September):** This sharp, annual peak corresponds with the anniversary of the **March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom**, which took place on August 28, 1963. This was the event where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his iconic \"I Have a Dream\" speech.\n\n*   **The Blue Line (Peak in late May/early June):** This recurring peak marks the anniversary of the **Tulsa Race Massacre**, which occurred from May 31 to June 1, 1921. Public awareness and search interest for this event grew significantly around its 100th anniversary in 2021, establishing a new pattern of annual commemoration.\n\nThe combination of these specific, annually recurring search trends for events so central to the American historical narrative makes it evident that the country is the United States.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
