    "Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided spectral data, the compound is identified as 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n\n### **Analysis of Spectroscopic Data**\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is observed at an m/z of 135.\n    *   Applying the Nitrogen Rule, the odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms, likely one.\n    *   This leads to a probable molecular formula of C₉H₁₃N, which has a calculated molecular weight of 135.21 g/mol.\n    *   The degree of unsaturation for C₉H₁₃N is 4, which is consistent with the presence of a benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**\n    *   The peaks just above 3000 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of sp² C-H stretching, indicating an aromatic ring.\n    *   The peaks just below 3000 cm⁻¹ correspond to sp³ C-H stretching from an aliphatic chain.\n    *   Two small peaks in the range of 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ are indicative of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   Peaks around 1600-1450 cm⁻¹ confirm the C=C stretching of the aromatic ring.\n\n3.  **¹H NMR Spectroscopy:**\n    *   **δ 7.1-7.3 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** This signal corresponds to the five protons of a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n    *   **δ ~2.8 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** This signal represents a methylene group (-CH₂-). Its position suggests it is a benzylic group, adjacent to the phenyl ring.\n    *   **δ ~2.7 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** This signal is from a methine group (-CH-).\n    *   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H):** This signal is characteristic of a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n    *   The 2 protons of the amine group (-NH₂) are likely very broad or exchanging with solvent, and thus not clearly integrated. This is a common occurrence for amine protons.\n\n4.  **¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectroscopy:**\n    *   There are a total of 7 carbon signals, which matches the expected number for 1-phenylpropan-2-amine (3 from the side chain and 4 from the phenyl ring due to symmetry).\n    *   **Aromatic Region:** δ 145.1 (quaternary C), 128.5 (CH), 127.3 (CH), 126.3 (CH).\n    *   **Aliphatic Region:** δ 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n    *   The DEPT-135 spectrum shows one negative signal and five positive signals. This is perfectly consistent with the proposed structure:\n        *   **Negative signal:** One -CH₂- group (at 43.5 ppm).\n        *   **Positive signals:** Three aromatic -CH- groups, one aliphatic -CH- group (at 49.6 ppm), and one -CH₃ group (at 19.2 ppm).\n        *   The quaternary carbon (at 145.1 ppm) is absent, as expected.\n\n5.  **HSQC Spectroscopy:**\n    *   This 2D spectrum correlates the proton signals with their directly attached carbon atoms, confirming the assignments:\n        *   ¹H at ~2.8 ppm correlates with ¹³C at 43.5 ppm (-CH₂-).\n        *   ¹H at ~2.7 ppm correlates with ¹³C at 49.6 ppm (-CH-).\n        *   ¹H at ~1.2 ppm correlates with ¹³C at 19.2 ppm (-CH₃-).\n        *   ¹H signals at ~7.2 ppm correlate with the aromatic ¹³C signals (~126-129 ppm).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll spectroscopic evidence converges to a single structure: a propane chain with a phenyl group on carbon 1 and an amine group on carbon 2. The IUPAC name for this compound is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
