    "The cuneiform sign in the image is É, the Sumerian symbol for a house or temple. In its early pictographic form from the third millennium BCE, as shown, it is a top-down view or ground plan of a rectangular structure. The Sumerian word É is the likely origin for Semitic words for \"palace\" or \"temple,\" such as the Hebrew *heikhal* and the Arabic *haykal*.\n\nThis sign corresponds to answer choice D, \"Home.\" A look at the archaic signs for the other options reveals different pictographs:\n*   **Deity:** The sign for a deity (DINGIR) was a star-like symbol, representing the heavens.\n*   **Bread:** The sign for bread (NINDA) was often a pictograph of a bowl.\n*   **Guard:** The term for a royal guard appears in texts from the Ur III period (late third millennium), but the sign is different.\n\n<<<D>>>"
