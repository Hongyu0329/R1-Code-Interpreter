    "The product is **Bourjois**.\n\nThis French cosmetics company created an advertising campaign during World War II under the slogan \"Women are winning the War - of Freedom,\" the same headline seen in the provided image. These ads often depicted women in factories and other war-related jobs.\n\nDuring the war, maintaining appearances was promoted as a patriotic duty to keep morale high. Advertisements for companies like Bourjois framed the use of makeup as a way for women to retain their charm, poise, and sense of self while performing difficult, unfeminine work, thus helping them overcome the psychological limitations and hardships imposed by their new roles. The Bourjois name itself is distinctly French.\n\n<<<Bourjois>>>"
