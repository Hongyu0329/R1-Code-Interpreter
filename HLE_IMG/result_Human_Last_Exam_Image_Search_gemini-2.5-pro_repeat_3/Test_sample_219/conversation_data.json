    "Based on the analysis of the provided graph, the synchronized bursts are identified at the following approximate timestamps:\n\n*   **Burst 1:** 2 s\n*   **Burst 2:** 8 s\n*   **Burst 3:** 17 s\n*   **Burst 4:** 25 s\n*   **Burst 5:** 36 s\n\nThe inter-burst intervals (the time between consecutive bursts) are calculated as follows:\n\n*   **Interval 1:** 8 s - 2 s = 6 s\n*   **Interval 2:** 17 s - 8 s = 9 s\n*   **Interval 3:** 25 s - 17 s = 8 s\n*   **Interval 4:** 36 s - 25 s = 11 s\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is the sum of these intervals divided by the number of intervals:\n\nAverage Inter-Burst Interval = (6 s + 9 s + 8 s + 11 s) / 4 = 34 s / 4 = 8.5 s.\n\nTo two significant figures, the average inter-burst interval is 8.5 s.\n\n<<<8.5>>>"
