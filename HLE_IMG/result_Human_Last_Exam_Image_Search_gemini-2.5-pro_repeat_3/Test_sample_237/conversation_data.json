    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. It is an insect, specifically a type of longhorn beetle.\n\nBased on its coloration and markings—a black head and thorax with reddish-orange wing covers (elytra) that have black tips—the animal is identified as a female **Black-striped Longhorn Beetle**.\n\nThe scientific name of this beetle is ***Stenurella melanura***. This species is widespread in Europe and parts of Asia. The larvae develop in the decaying wood of both deciduous and coniferous trees, while the adults are commonly found on flowers from May through September, where they feed on pollen and nectar. There is a noticeable difference between the sexes; females have reddish elytra, while males have yellow-brown elytra with a less pronounced black tip.\n\n<<<Stenurella melanura>>>"
