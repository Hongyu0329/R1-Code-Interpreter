    "The square structure visible at coordinates 29° 06' 18.75''N and 103° 47' 50.28''W is the archeological site of a Spanish mission and historic Native American pueblo known as the Polvo site (41PS21), which is part of the old settlement of El Polvo, near Redford, Texas.\n\nThis significant location on the Rio Grande was historically the site of the Tapacolmes pueblo. A Spanish mission, San Pedro de Alcántara de los Tapalcomes, was established here around the turn of the 17th century but was found in ruins by 1747. The area was later resettled in the 19th century and became known as El Polvo, which means \"the dust\" in Spanish. In the early 20th century, a U.S. Cavalry post, Camp Polvo, was also located here.\n\n**Yes, this is a historic landmark.** The Polvo site is a rich archeological area with both historic and prehistoric cultural deposits. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on March 25, 1976, and designated a Texas State Archeological Landmark on November 7, 1983. Though the last remnants of the old Spanish mission walls were reportedly leveled in the 1950s, the site remains a protected and historically significant location.\n\n<<<The square structure at the given coordinates is the archeological site of the Polvo site (41PS21), which includes the ruins of a Spanish mission and the historic Tapacolmes pueblo. It is a designated historic landmark, listed on the National Register of Historic Places and as a Texas State Archeological Landmark.>>>"
