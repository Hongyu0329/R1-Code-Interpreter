    "The image displays a protein modification process known as SUMOylation. The larger protein in dark blue is being modified by the smaller, light-blue protein, which is a Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier (SUMO) protein.\n\nSUMO proteins are part of a family of small proteins that attach to and detach from other proteins within a cell to alter their function. This process is a type of post-translational modification involved in many cellular activities, including gene expression, protein stability, and stress response.\n\nThe attachment of SUMO to a target protein is a multi-step enzymatic process similar to ubiquitination. It involves an E1 activating enzyme, an E2 conjugating enzyme, and often an E3 ligase, which facilitates the formation of a covalent isopeptide bond between the SUMO protein and a lysine residue on the target protein. Unlike ubiquitination, which often tags proteins for degradation, SUMOylation typically modifies a protein's function or interactions. SUMO-modified proteins can also recruit other proteins that contain a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM).\n\n<<<SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier) protein>>>"
