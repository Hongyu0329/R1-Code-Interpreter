    "The X Y is a **Silver Mirror**.\n\nThis answer is derived from the two clues provided:\n\n1.  **The Visual Clue:** The image displays a man receiving a spherical, highly reflective award. This award has the appearance of a convex mirror, which is a type of silver mirror.\n\n2.  **The Textual Clue:** This clue states that another \"Silver Mirror\" has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts. This refers to the historical method of manufacturing mirrors using a tin-mercury amalgam. This process, which was common from the 16th to the 19th century, was extremely hazardous to the health of the workers due to mercury's high toxicity. In 1835, a new, non-toxic method using silver nitrate was invented, which eventually replaced the dangerous mercury process.\n\nTherefore, \"Silver Mirror\" is the term that connects the object in the picture (a mirror-like award) with the historical process involving toxic mercury salts.\n\n<<<Silver Mirror>>>"
