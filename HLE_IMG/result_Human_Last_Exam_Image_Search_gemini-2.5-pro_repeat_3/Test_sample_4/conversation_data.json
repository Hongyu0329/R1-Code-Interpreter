    "The knot depicted is known in knot theory as the 9₄₂ knot. Notably, the Jones polynomial for this knot is the same as for its mirror image.\n\nThe Jones polynomial, denoted as V(t), for the 9₄₂ knot is:\n\nt⁻⁶ - t⁻⁵ + t⁻⁴ - t⁻³ + t⁻² - t⁻¹ + 1\n\nThis can also be expressed as:\n\n1 - t⁻¹ + t⁻² - t⁻³ + t⁻⁴ - t⁻⁵ + t⁻⁶\n<<<t⁻⁶ - t⁻⁵ + t⁻⁴ - t⁻³ + t⁻² - t⁻¹ + 1>>>"
