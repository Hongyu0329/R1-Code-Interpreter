    "To determine the time complexity of the given algorithm, we first need to establish its recurrence relation, which describes the computational cost of the function in terms of its input size `n`.\n\n### Algorithm Breakdown\n\nThe provided pseudocode is:\n```python\ndef sort(a, n):\n  if n > 1:\n    # 1. Recursive call on a smaller problem\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n\n    # 2. Comparison and potential swap (constant time operations)\n    if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n      swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])\n\n      # 3. Another recursive call if the swap occurred\n      sort(a, n - 1)\n```\n\nLet's denote the time complexity for `sort(a, n)` as `T(n)`. We analyze the cost of the operations within the function:\n\n*   The first recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` has a cost of `T(n - 1)`.\n*   The comparison `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` and the `swap` operation both take constant time, which can be represented as `O(1)` or `c`.\n*   The second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` also has a cost of `T(n - 1)`.\n\n### Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe worst-case time complexity occurs when the `if` condition is always met, triggering the second recursive call. This happens, for example, with a reverse-sorted array. In this scenario, the recurrence relation becomes:\n\nT(n) = T(n - 1) + c + T(n - 1)\nT(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c\n\nThis is a linear, non-homogeneous recurrence relation. We can solve it by expansion:\n*   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n*   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n*   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n*   ...after k steps...\n*   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^k - 1)`\n\nThe recursion stops at the base case `n = 1`, where `T(1)` is a constant. We reach the base case when `n - k = 1`, so `k = n - 1`. Substituting `k` back into the equation:\n\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n\nAs `n` becomes large, the dominant term is `2^(n-1)`. Therefore, the time complexity is exponential.\n\nO(T(n)) = O(2^n)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe algorithm makes two recursive calls on a subproblem of size `n-1` in the worst case. This doubling of calls at each step of the recursion leads to an exponential number of operations.\n\n<<<E>>>"
