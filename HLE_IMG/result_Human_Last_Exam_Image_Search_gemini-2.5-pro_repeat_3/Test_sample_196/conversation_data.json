    "In the absence of a dipolarophile, 3-oxidopyryliums undergo a dimerization reaction. This transformation can be described as a pericyclic cycloaddition process. Based on the different ways the π-system of the 3-oxidopyrylium zwitterion can be partitioned, there are several possible formal descriptions of this dimerization in terms of the number of π-electrons involved from each monomer, denoted as [mπ + nπ]. Four such possibilities are:\n\n1.  **[4π + 2π]:** This describes the dimerization as a Diels-Alder reaction. One 3-oxidopyrylium molecule acts as a 4π-electron diene component, while the second molecule provides a 2π-electron dienophile component from one of its double bonds. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a thermal [4s + 2s] (suprafacial-suprafacial) cycloaddition is allowed, making this a very common and plausible description.\n\n2.  **[6π + 4π]:** This higher-order cycloaddition describes one molecule participating with its entire 6π-electron delocalized system, reacting with a 4π-electron diene fragment of the second molecule. This formalism aligns with the characterization of the dimerization as a [5+3] cycloaddition in some literature, where one molecule contributes a 5-atom (6π electron) fragment and the other a 3-atom (4π electron) fragment. A thermal reaction of this type is allowed if one component reacts antarafacially, i.e., in a [6s + 4a] or [6a + 4s] manner.\n\n3.  **[4π + 4π]:** In this description, both molecules react as 4π-electron systems. For example, each could react as a 1,3-dipole or as a diene fragment. This type of cycloaddition is thermally allowed if it proceeds with one component being suprafacial and the other antarafacial ([4s + 4a]).\n\n4.  **[6π + 2π]:** This formalism involves one 3-oxidopyrylium molecule engaging its full 6π-electron system, while the second molecule participates as a simple 2π-electron component (an alkene). The resulting reaction would form an eight-membered ring. This process is thermally allowed if it occurs in a suprafacial-antarafacial manner ([6s + 2a] or [6a + 2s]).\n\n<<<\n*   [4π + 2π]\n*   [6π + 4π]\n*   [4π + 4π]\n*   [6π + 2π]\n>>>"
