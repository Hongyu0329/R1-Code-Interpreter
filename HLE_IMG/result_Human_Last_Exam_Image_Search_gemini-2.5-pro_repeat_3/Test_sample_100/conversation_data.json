    "My analysis of the reaction steps is confirmed by the search results.\n\n*   **Step 1: CAN deprotection.** Ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) or DDQ are standard reagents for the oxidative deprotection of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers and amines. The PMB group is cleaved, and the nitrogen becomes a secondary amine (N-H). This confirms that Intermediate 1 is formed by removing the PMB group (C8H9O) and adding one hydrogen atom.\n*   **Step 2: Catalytic Hydrogenation.** Pd/C with H2 is a standard method for the catalytic hydrogenation of alkenes to alkanes. Search results indicate that this reaction is generally chemoselective for the C=C double bond, and other functional groups like amides (lactams) are typically not reduced under these conditions, especially under neutral conditions and short reaction times. This confirms that Intermediate 2 is formed by the addition of two hydrogen atoms across the double bond of Intermediate 1.\n*   **Step 3: Acid Hydrolysis of Lactam.** Lactams can be hydrolyzed under acidic conditions (e.g., using HCl) to yield amino acids. The reaction involves the addition of a water molecule (H2O) across the amide bond, which opens the ring. The bicyclic lactam in this reaction is expected to open to form a monocyclic amino acid. This confirms that the final product is formed by adding one molecule of H2O to Intermediate 2.\n\n**Summary of Molecular Formula Changes:**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** 2-(4-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    *   Molecular Formula: C15H14F3NO2\n\n2.  **Intermediate 1:** 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    *   Reaction: Deprotection of PMB group.\n    *   Change: - C8H9O (PMB group) + H (on Nitrogen) = -C8H8O\n    *   Molecular Formula: C15-8 H14-8 F3 N O2-1 = C7H6F3NO\n\n3.  **Intermediate 2:** 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n    *   Reaction: Hydrogenation of C=C bond.\n    *   Change: + H2\n    *   Molecular Formula: C7H6+2F3NO = C7H8F3NO\n\n4.  **Product:**\n    *   Reaction: Hydrolysis of lactam.\n    *   Change: + H2O\n    *   Molecular Formula: C7 H8+2 F3 N O1+1 = C7H10F3NO2\n\nThe molecular formula of the final product is C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
