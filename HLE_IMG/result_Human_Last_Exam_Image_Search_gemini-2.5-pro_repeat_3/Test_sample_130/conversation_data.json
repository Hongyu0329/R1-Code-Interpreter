    "The spectral lines shown in the image belong to the element **Uranium**.\n\nThe distinct pattern of colored lines is a unique fingerprint for each element when it is heated and its light is passed through a prism. The image provided corresponds to the known emission spectrum of Uranium. Scientific sources confirm that this complex spectrum, with its numerous lines in the blue, green, yellow, orange, and red regions, is characteristic of Uranium atoms. For example, a strong emission line for Uranium atoms is found at 591.5 nm, which falls within the yellow-orange part of the spectrum visible in the image.\n\n<<<Uranium>>>"
