    "Based on the provided histopathological image and clinical information, the diagnosis is **Mucormycosis**.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\nA 28-year-old female presenting with a mass in the sella turcica could have a differential diagnosis that includes pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma, or inflammatory and infectious lesions. However, the histopathology is definitive in this case.\n\n*   **Histopathological Findings**: The image, which appears to be stained with Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), reveals critical diagnostic features. Prominently visible are large, broad, ribbon-like fungal hyphae. These hyphae are characteristically irregular in width and show sparse or no septations (pauciseptate or aseptate). A key feature is the branching pattern, which occurs at wide, often right angles (90 degrees). The surrounding tissue shows a dense inflammatory infiltrate and areas of necrosis, which is typical for this aggressive, angioinvasive fungus.\n\n*   **Correlation with Clinical Presentation**: Mucormycosis is a severe, rapidly progressing fungal infection. The rhinocerebral form is the most common, often originating in the nose and paranasal sinuses and capable of extending into adjacent structures, including the orbit, palate, and intracranial cavity. Invasion into the sella turcica can mimic a pituitary tumor clinically and on imaging. While often associated with immunocompromised states like diabetes mellitus, it can also occur in immunocompetent individuals.\n\n*   **Differential Diagnosis**:\n    *   **Aspergillosis**: This is another important fungal infection that can present in the sella turcica. However, *Aspergillus* hyphae are typically slender, uniform in width, regularly septate, and exhibit acute-angle (45-degree) branching. The morphology in the image is inconsistent with aspergillosis.\n    *   **Pituitary Adenoma**: This would be composed of sheets of uniform neuroendocrine cells and would not contain fungal organisms.\n    *   **Other Infections**: Bacterial abscesses or tuberculosis could be considered, but the histopathology clearly demonstrates fungal elements, not bacteria or the characteristic granulomas of tuberculosis.\n\nThe combination of a sellar mass and the distinct histopathological features of broad, pauciseptate hyphae with right-angle branching is classic for mucormycosis.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"
