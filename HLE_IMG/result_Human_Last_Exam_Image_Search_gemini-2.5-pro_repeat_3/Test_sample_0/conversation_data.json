    "The sequence for a mate in 2 for black, without moving the black queens, is as follows:\n\n1.  **Ng3+**\n2.  **Rf3#**\n\nHere is the explanation of the sequence:\n*   Black's first move is Knight to g3 (Ng3), which places the white king in check.\n*   White's only possible move is to capture the knight with the pawn on h2 (hxg3). The king cannot move to g1 (blocked by the queen on b1) or g2 (blocked by the queen on a2).\n*   Black's second move is Rook to f3 (Rf3), which results in a checkmate. The white king on h1 is attacked by the rook, and its escape squares (g1 and g2) are blocked by the black queens and the white pawn on g3. The rook on f3 cannot be captured.\n\nIt is worth noting that there are other possible sequences for a mate in 2, such as 1. Rf2+ followed by 2. Ng3#, and 1. Bh2+ followed by 2. Ng3#.\n\n<<<1. Ng3+, 2. Rf3#>>>"
