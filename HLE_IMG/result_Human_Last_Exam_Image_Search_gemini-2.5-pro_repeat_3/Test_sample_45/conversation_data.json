    "The tiling in the image exhibits several rotational symmetries. By visually inspecting the pattern, we can identify different points around which the tiling can be rotated to appear unchanged.\n\nThe most prominent feature is the dark blue hexagon. If we consider the center of any of these hexagons, the entire tiling can be rotated by multiples of 60 degrees (360Â°/6) and remain identical. This indicates a **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\nAdditionally, there are other centers of rotation:\n*   **3-fold symmetry:** At the points where three hexagons come close together, forming a triangular arrangement of squares and other shapes, there is a center of 3-fold rotational symmetry. A rotation of 120 degrees around these points leaves the pattern unchanged.\n*   **2-fold symmetry:** There are also points of 2-fold rotational symmetry. For example, rotating the tiling 180 degrees around the center of any of the lighter orange squares will result in the same pattern.\n\nWhen a tiling has multiple rotational symmetries, its overall rotational symmetry is typically defined by the highest order of rotation present. In this case, the highest order is 6.\n\nThis type of pattern is a form of Islamic geometric tiling. Such designs are known for their intricate and complex patterns built from repeating simple shapes like circles, squares, and polygons. The specific wallpaper group for this tiling, based on its symmetries, is p6m.\n\nTherefore, the rotational symmetry of the tiling is 6-fold.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
