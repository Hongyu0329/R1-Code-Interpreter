    "Based on the location of the decay shown in the image, the lesion corresponds to a **Class I** caries classification.\n\nAccording to the widely used G.V. Black classification system, Class I caries are those that occur in the pits and fissures of teeth. This includes the chewing (occlusal) surfaces of molars and premolars, which is where the lesion in the photograph is located.\n\nThe decay is visible in the grooves of the occlusal surface surrounding a pre-existing restoration. When decay forms around an existing filling, it is known as recurrent caries, but its classification is still determined by its anatomical location on the tooth. Since this lesion is confined to the pits and fissures of the occlusal surface, it is classified as Class I.\n\n<<<Class I>>>"
