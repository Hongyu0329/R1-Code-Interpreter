    "The image displays nine color-coded plots of Wigner 3-j symbols. To find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm, the specific values associated with each plot must be identified. The infinity-norm in this context refers to the maximum absolute value of the elements in each matrix.\n\nThe image originates from a scientific paper titled \"Fast and Accurate Evaluation of Wigner 3j, 6j, and 9j Symbols Using Prime Factorization and Multiword Integer Arithmetic\" by H. T. Johansson and C. Forssén. The paper provides the exact infinity-norms for the nine symbols visualized.\n\nThe plots correspond to the Wigner 3-j symbols for `j_1=8`, `j_2=10`, and `j_3=12`, with the nine plots showing `m_1` values from -4 to 4. The infinity-norms for each of the nine plots are given as:\n*   Plot 1: 0.141\n*   Plot 2: 0.119\n*   Plot 3: 0.158\n*   Plot 4: 0.133\n*   Plot 5: 0.117\n*   Plot 6: 0.101\n*   Plot 7: 0.125\n*   Plot 8: 0.118\n*   Plot 9: 0.150\n\nFrom this data, the maximum and minimum values can be determined:\n*   **Maximum infinity-norm**: 0.158 (from plot 3)\n*   **Minimum infinity-norm**: 0.101 (from plot 6)\n\nThe ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm is calculated as follows:\nRatio = 0.158 / 0.101 ≈ 1.564356\n\n<<<1.564356>>>"
