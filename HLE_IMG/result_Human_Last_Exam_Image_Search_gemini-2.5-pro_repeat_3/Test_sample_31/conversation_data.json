    "The knot in the picture is the 8₁₉ knot. According to the Knot Atlas, the Rasmussen s-invariant for this knot is -6.\n\nThe 8₁₉ knot is notable for being the first non-homologically thin knot in the Rolfsen table, which means its Khovanov homology has \"off-diagonal\" elements. It is also a torus knot, specifically T(4,3), and can be represented as the pretzel knot P(3,3,-2).\n\nThe Rasmussen s-invariant is a powerful tool in knot theory derived from Khovanov homology. It provides a lower bound for the smooth 4-genus of a knot. For alternating knots, the s-invariant is equal to the knot's signature. However, 8₁₉ is a non-alternating knot. The signature of 8₁₉ is 6, while its Rasmussen s-invariant is -6.\n\n<<<The Rasmussen invariant of the knot 8₁₉ is -6.>>>"
