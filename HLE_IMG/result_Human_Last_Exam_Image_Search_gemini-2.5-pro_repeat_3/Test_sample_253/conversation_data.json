    "The organism in the image is a yellow lichen, identified as likely being *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the common orange lichen or shoreline lichen. This identification is supported by its appearance and its documented presence in Acadia National Park. This lichen is notable for its symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga.\n\nThe XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* is a type of hydrophobin, a class of proteins found in fungi that are involved in forming a water-repellent surface. This is crucial for the lichen's survival, as it allows for gas exchange while preventing the organism from becoming waterlogged.\n\nScientific research on the XPH1 protein has determined its amino acid sequence. One study indicates that the mature XPH1 protein has a size of **83 amino acids**. Another study mentions that the encoded protein, including a secretion signal, contains 110 amino acids, with the open reading frame being interrupted by two introns. The discrepancy might arise from considering the pre-processed protein versus the mature, functional protein. However, the more detailed analysis showing the cDNA and deduced amino acid sequence points to the mature protein having 83 amino acids.\n\n<<<83>>>"
