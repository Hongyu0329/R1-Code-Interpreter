    "The animal depicted in the center of the image is the Small Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name is *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\nThis red and black bug is identifiable by the distinct red, X-shaped marking on its wings and a red band on the segment behind its head. The head is black, often with a red spot on top. Adults are about 10 to 12 mm long.\n\nWhile its common name refers to milkweed, the Small Milkweed Bug is known to be an opportunistic feeder. It consumes the nectar and seeds of various plants, including goldenrod (*Solidago* sp.), which appears to be the plant in the image. This insect is found throughout North America.\n\nThere are two recognized subspecies: *Lygaeus kalmii angustomarginatus* (the eastern small milkweed bug) and *Lygaeus kalmii kalmii* (the western small milkweed bug).\n\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"
