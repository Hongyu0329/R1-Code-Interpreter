    "The transformation involves two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions.\n\nThe overall reaction proceeds in two main steps:\n\n1.  **Valence Isomerization of Hexafluorobenzene:** The first step is the photochemical isomerization of hexafluorobenzene into its highly strained valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene. This pericyclic reaction is a 4π-electron electrocyclic ring-closing (also called an electrocyclization). According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, 4π electrocyclic reactions are allowed under photochemical conditions. This reaction can also be described as an intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\n2.  **Intermolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition:** The second step is the reaction between the hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene intermediate and cyclobutene. This is an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition between one of the double bonds of Dewar benzene and the double bond of cyclobutene to form the final product. This type of cycloaddition, involving 4π electrons, is also a photochemically allowed pericyclic reaction.\n\nTherefore, the two pericyclic reactions are a **4π electrocyclization** and an **intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n<<<4π electrocyclization and [2+2] cycloaddition>>>"
