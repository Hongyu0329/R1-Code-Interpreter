    "This coin is a 9 Deniers issue for the French Colonies, struck between 1721 and 1722 under King Louis XV. While the inscription \"COLONIES FRANCOISES\" suggests a general issuance for all French territories, these coins were specifically intended for France's colonies in the New World. This included New France (which covered modern-day Canada, especially Quebec, and the Louisiana territory) and the French West Indies.\n\nThe coin in the image features two crossed 'L's under a crown on one side, with the legend \"SIT NOMEN DOMINI BENEDICTUM,\" which translates to \"Blessed be the name of the Lord.\" The other side has the words \"COLONIES FRANCOISES\" and a mint mark. The visible mint mark in the image appears to be an \"H,\" indicating it was struck at the La Rochelle mint in France. Coins with a \"B\" for the Rouen mint were also produced.\n\nAlthough minted for the colonies in general, they are often referred to as \"Louisiana Copper\" because they were eventually redistributed and circulated more successfully in Louisiana after initially being rejected by colonists in other regions who preferred coins containing silver. The Company of the Indies, a private trading company, imported these coins, but faced difficulties in circulating them, with most being returned to France by 1726.\n\nTherefore, while not from a single, exclusive colony, this coin originates from an issue primarily circulated in the French American colonies, with a strong association with New France and particularly Louisiana.\n\n<<<New France (including Louisiana and Canada)>>>"
