    "The small, black, pin-like organisms growing on the surface of the shelf fungus are a type of slime mold. Specifically, they appear to be a species from the genus *Hemitrichia*, such as *Hemitrichia calyculata*.\n\nThese structures are the fruiting bodies of the slime mold, which are in the process of releasing spores. Slime molds in this stage are sometimes referred to as \"Push Pin Slime Mold\".\n\nThe larger, fan-shaped fungus they are growing on is a type of bracket fungus, commonly known as a polypore. Based on its appearance with concentric bands of color, it is likely a Turkey Tail mushroom (*Trametes versicolor*) or a related species. These fungi are saprophytic, meaning they feed on decaying wood. It is common to find different species of fungi and slime molds growing in close proximity on dead or dying trees.\n\n<<<Hemitrichia calyculata>>>"
