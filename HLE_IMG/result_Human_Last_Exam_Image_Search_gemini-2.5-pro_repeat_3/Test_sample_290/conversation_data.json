    "Based on the visual evidence in the photograph, this image was taken at Golden Gardens Park in Seattle, Washington.\n\nThe key features that lead to this conclusion are:\n\n*   **Beach Bonfires:** The image clearly shows a bonfire on the beach. Seattle Parks and Recreation allows beach fires in designated fire pits at both Golden Gardens and Alki Beach. In 2022, the beach fire season at Golden Gardens began on May 28th.\n*   **Landscape:** The view across the water, with the forested shoreline of Puget Sound, is characteristic of the view from Golden Gardens Park. The park is well-known for its exceptional sunset views over the Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains.\n*   **Foreground:** The presence of a chain-link fence in the immediate foreground is consistent with the fencing found in certain areas of Golden Gardens Park, particularly near the railroad tracks and parking areas adjacent to the beach.\n\nThese elements combined strongly suggest the location is Golden Gardens Park.\n\n<<<Seattle>>>"
