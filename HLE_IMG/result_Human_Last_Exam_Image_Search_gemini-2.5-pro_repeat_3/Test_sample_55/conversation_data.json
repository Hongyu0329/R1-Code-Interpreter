    "The circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, form a D major chord.\n\nTo determine the correct Roman numeral, we must analyze the chord in the context of the piece's home key, which is D minor. The notes present in the measure are D, F-sharp, and A. These notes constitute a D major triad.\n\nIn a minor key, the tonic chord is typically minor (in this case, D-F-A). However, it is a common practice to use a major tonic chord, which involves raising the third of the scale (from F to F-sharp). When a major chord is built on the tonic in a minor key, it is represented by a capital Roman numeral.\n\nTherefore, the accurate Roman numeral for the D major chord in the key of D minor is I.\n\n<<<I>>>"
