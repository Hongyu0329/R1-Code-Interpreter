    "The medallion is a silver-gilt phalera, an ornamental disk likely used for horse harnesses, and is attributed by archaeologists to the 2nd to 1st century BC. This artifact is a product of Sarmatian toreutics, the art of working metal, from the Late Hellenistic period.\n\nPhalerae of this type, often featuring mythological subjects or portraits, were widespread across the Eurasian steppes. They are characteristic of the material culture of the Sarmatians, an Iranian-speaking nomadic people who dominated the Pontic steppe from around the 5th century BCE to the 4th century CE. Numerous examples have been discovered in elite Sarmatian burials, often as part of a set of horse trappings.\n\nWhile the exact location of its discovery is not specified, it belongs to a well-documented category of artifacts found in a vast area stretching from the Ural Mountains to the Balkans. The style often shows a blend of local and Hellenistic influences, which is consistent with the period of intense cultural interaction in the region. The depiction of two facing busts, likely a male and a female figure, is a known theme in this art form, although this particular example is a significant find.\n\n<<<1st century B.C.>>>"
