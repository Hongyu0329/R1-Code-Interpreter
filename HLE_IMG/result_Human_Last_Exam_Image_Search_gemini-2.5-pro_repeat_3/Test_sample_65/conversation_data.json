    "The bryophyte in the image belongs to the genus *Ptilidium*.\n\nThis identification is based on the highly characteristic appearance of the plant, which is a type of leafy liverwort. The name *Ptilidium* comes from a Greek word meaning \"small feather,\" which refers to the plant's feathery look. This appearance is created by leaves that are deeply divided into multiple, fine, hair-like fringes called cilia. The overlapping, curled, and finely divided leaves give the plant its distinctive \"braided\" or \"hirsute\" appearance, making the genus relatively easy to recognize.\n\nThe genus includes three species, with *Ptilidium ciliare* (Ciliated Fringewort) and *Ptilidium pulcherrimum* being the most widespread. These species typically grow in mats on substrates like soil, rocks, or tree bark in various habitats, including forests and heaths.\n\n<<<Ptilidium>>>"
