    "The lifetimes of the iridium complexes in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are primarily determined by their chemical stability under operational conditions. A key factor in the stability of these `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+` type complexes is the strength of the bonds within the cyclometalating (C^N) ligands, especially the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond.\n\nThe four complexes differ in the fluorination of the phenyl rings on their cyclometalating ligands:\n*   **Complex 1:** 2',4'-difluorophenylpyridine ligands\n*   **Complex 2:** 4'-fluorophenylpyridine ligands\n*   **Complex 3:** 2'-fluorophenylpyridine ligands\n*   **Complex 4:** Unsubstituted phenylpyridine ligands\n\nIntroducing fluorine atoms, which are highly electronegative, onto the phenyl ring generally enhances the stability of the complex. This is due to the strengthening of the C-F bonds compared to C-H bonds and the stabilization of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO), which makes the complex more resistant to oxidative degradation. It has been noted that lifetimes of devices based on fluorine-free iridium complexes have, so far, proven to be suboptimal.\n\nBased on these principles, we can assess the relative stability of the four complexes:\n*   **Complex 4**, which lacks any fluorine substituents on the C^N ligands, is expected to be the least stable. The C-H bonds are weaker than C-F bonds, and the Ir-C bond is more susceptible to degradation pathways.\n*   **Complex 2** has a fluorine atom at the *para* (4') position. This provides moderate stabilization through its electron-withdrawing inductive effect, making it more stable than Complex 4.\n*   **Complex 3** features fluorination at the *ortho* (2') position. While *ortho*-fluorination can sometimes introduce competing non-radiative decay pathways, it is also known to significantly strengthen the crucial Ir-C bond, thereby enhancing overall stability against chemical degradation.\n*   **Complex 1** benefits from fluorination at both the *ortho* and *para* positions. This combination is generally expected to provide the greatest stability, making it the most robust complex with the longest operational lifetime.\n\nTherefore, the stability and expected lifetime increase in the order: Complex 4 < Complex 2 < Complex 3 < Complex 1. The question asks for the complexes that are expected to show *shorter* lifetimes. Compared to the highly stabilized fluorinated complexes (especially Complex 1), the non-fluorinated Complex 4 and the less-stabilized para-fluorinated Complex 2 would exhibit shorter operational lifetimes.\n\n<<<I>>>"
