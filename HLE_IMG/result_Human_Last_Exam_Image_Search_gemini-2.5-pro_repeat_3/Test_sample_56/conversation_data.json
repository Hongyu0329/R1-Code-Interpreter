    "The artist of the painting, titled \"La Vocation,\" is the Spanish surrealist painter Josep Baqués. Born in 1931, Baqués is known for a personal style that blends magic with reality and dreams with symbols. His work often creates an imaginary and poetic space where different eras intersect.\n\nWhile the style of the painting is reminiscent of the more famous surrealist René Magritte, and is sometimes misattributed to him, \"La Vocation\" is correctly attributed to Baqués. Baqués's art is considered to be both traditional and modern, demonstrating a knowledge of artistic tradition while incorporating surrealistic elements. He is noted for his imaginative capacity and rigorous technical training, which are evident in the detailed and dreamlike quality of his paintings.\n\n<<<Josep Baqués>>>"
