    "Based on the visual characteristics and the information from the search results, here is the identification of the rock specimens:\n\n*   **H: Scoria** This specimen is reddish-brown and highly vesicular (full of bubble-like cavities). Scoria is an extrusive igneous rock that is typically dark in color (brown, black, or reddish) and can be basaltic or andesitic in composition. Its vesicular nature is due to gas bubbles being trapped as lava cools. Scoria is denser than pumice and will sink in water. The reddish color is often due to the oxidation of iron.\n\n*   **I: Volcanic Breccia** This rock is composed of large, angular fragments of other rocks cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This texture is characteristic of a breccia. Given that the other rocks are volcanic, this is likely a volcanic breccia, which can form from explosive eruptions that fragment and mix different types of volcanic rocks. Volcanic breccias are defined as being composed predominantly of angular volcanic fragments larger than 2 mm.\n\n*   **J: Pumice** This specimen is light-colored and has a very porous, \"frothy\" appearance with many small vesicles. Pumice is a type of volcanic rock that is so vesicular it is often lightweight enough to float on water. It is typically light in color, ranging from white to light-gray or tan, and forms from the rapid cooling of gas-rich, felsic lava.\n\n*   **K: Pegmatite** This rock displays very large, interlocking crystals, which is its defining characteristic. Pegmatite is a coarse-grained igneous rock, often with a composition similar to granite, consisting mainly of quartz, feldspar, and mica. The exceptionally large crystals, often larger than 1 cm, form during the final stages of a magma's crystallization from a water-rich melt.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Volcanic Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
