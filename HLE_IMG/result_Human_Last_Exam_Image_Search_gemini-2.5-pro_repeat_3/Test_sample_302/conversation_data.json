    "The characters on the seal, read from top to bottom and right to left, are 長樂未央 (cháng lè wèi yāng).\n\nThis is a traditional four-character idiom that translates to \"eternal joy without end.\" The phrase was a common auspicious saying during the Han Dynasty and was often used on architectural elements like瓦當 (wǎ dāng), which are decorative end tiles for eaves, as well as on bronze mirrors and seals.\n\nThe term \"Changle\" (長樂) and \"Weiyang\" (未央) were also the names of two prominent palaces in the Han Dynasty, and the phrase initially served as a blessing for the emperor's reign to be everlasting.\n\nIn simplified Chinese, the characters are written as 长乐未央.\n\n<<<长乐未央>>>"
