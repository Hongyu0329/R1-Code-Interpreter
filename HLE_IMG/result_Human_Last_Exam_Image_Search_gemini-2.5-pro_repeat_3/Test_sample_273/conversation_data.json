    "The absolute configuration of the molecule is determined by assigning the stereochemical descriptor (R or S) to each of its three chiral centers using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. The chiral centers are numbered C2, C3, and C4 from left to right for clarity.\n\n**1. Priority Assignment:**\nThe substituents on each chiral carbon are ranked based on atomic number.\n*   **At C2 (the carbon with the -OH group):** The priorities are (1) -OH, (2) the rest of the carbon chain to the right (C3), (3) -CH3, and (4) -H (implicit).\n*   **At C3 (the carbon with the ethyl group):** The priorities are (1) the portion of the molecule to the left (C2, which is bonded to an oxygen), (2) the portion to the right (C4, which leads to a nitrogen), (3) the ethyl group, and (4) -H (implicit).\n*   **At C4 (the carbon with the -CH2NH2 group):** The priorities are (1) the rest of the carbon chain to the left (C3), (2) the -CH2NH2 group (due to the nitrogen), (3) -CH3, and (4) -H (implicit).\n\n**2. Determination of R/S Configuration:**\nThe 3D arrangement of the substituents determines the configuration. The molecule is oriented so the lowest-priority group (4) points away from the viewer. If the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 is clockwise, the configuration is R; if it is counter-clockwise, the configuration is S. If the lowest priority group points towards the viewer, the result is reversed.\n\n*   **Configuration at C2:** The substituents are -OH (dash), -CH3 (dash), and -C3 (wedge). The implicit H (priority 4) must be on a wedge, pointing towards the viewer. The path from priority 1 (-OH) to 2 (-C3) to 3 (-CH3) is counter-clockwise, which suggests an S configuration. However, since the lowest priority group is pointing forward, the configuration is reversed to **R**.\n*   **Configuration at C3:** The substituents are -C2 (dash), the ethyl group (wedge), and -C4 (wedge). The implicit H (priority 4) must be on a dash, pointing away. With the lowest priority group in the back, the path from 1 (-C2) to 2 (-C4) to 3 (ethyl group) is counter-clockwise. Therefore, the configuration is **S**.\n*   **Configuration at C4:** The substituents are -C3 (dash), -CH2NH2 (wedge), and -CH3 (dash). The implicit H (priority 4) must be on a wedge, pointing forward. The path from 1 (-C3) to 2 (-CH2NH2) to 3 (-CH3) is clockwise, suggesting an R configuration. As the lowest priority group is in front, the configuration is reversed to **S**.\n\nCombining these results, the absolute configuration of the molecule is (2R, 3S, 4S).\n\n<<<(2R, 3S, 4S)>>>"
