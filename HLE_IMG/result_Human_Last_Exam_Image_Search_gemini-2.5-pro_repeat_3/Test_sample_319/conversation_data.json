    "This image illustrates the **auditory continuity illusion**, also known as **temporal induction**.\n\nThis perceptual phenomenon occurs when a sound, such as a tone, is interrupted by a brief burst of another sound, like white noise. Although the original sound is physically absent during the interruption, the brain perceptually \"fills in\" the gap, leading to the experience of a continuous, uninterrupted sound. The image provided shows a spectrogram and a waveform of this exact scenario: a steady tone is physically stopped while noise is introduced, yet it is typically perceived as continuing through the noise.\n\nFor the illusion to be effective, the interrupting noise must be loud enough to plausibly mask the original sound if it were present. This effect is a general auditory process and is not limited to simple tones; it also occurs with more complex sounds like speech and music. When it occurs with speech, where a missing phoneme is replaced by a sound like a cough or noise, it is more specifically called the **phonemic restoration effect**.\n\nThe auditory continuity illusion demonstrates the brain's remarkable ability to create a coherent and continuous representation of the world from incomplete sensory information, a process similar to how the mind resolves the visual ambiguity of the Necker Cube.\n\n<<<auditory continuity illusion>>>"
