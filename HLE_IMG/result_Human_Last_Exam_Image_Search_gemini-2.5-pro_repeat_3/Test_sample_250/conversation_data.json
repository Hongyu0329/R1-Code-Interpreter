    "The jazz standard is titled \"What a Difference a Day Makes\". The music was composed in 1934 by Mexican songwriter María Grever. The original Spanish title is \"Cuando vuelva a tu lado,\" which translates to \"When I Return to Your Side.\" The English lyrics were written by Stanley Adams, also in 1934.\n\nThe song became widely popular in the United States after Dinah Washington's rhythm and blues version was released in 1959, which won a Grammy Award. It has since been recorded by a wide variety of artists in many genres, including Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Natalie Cole.\n\n<<<\"What a Difference a Day Makes\" by María Grever>>>"
