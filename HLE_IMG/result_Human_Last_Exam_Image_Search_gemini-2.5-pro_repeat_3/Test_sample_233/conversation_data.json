    "The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image fragment is identified as **Sö 179**, also known as the Gripsholm Runestone.\n\nA detailed analysis of the runes and the distinct grid-like carving style in the provided image confirms a match with the Gripsholm Runestone. The visible runic text in the middle row of the fragment, `...ᛋ ᛏ ᛅ ᛁ ᚾ...` (`...stain...`), is a key part of the inscription on Sö 179. The full inscription on this part of the stone reads \"Tola let ræisa stæin þennsa at sun sinn Harald, broður Ingvars\" which translates to \"Tóla had this stone raised in memory of her son Haraldr, Ingvarr's brother.\"\n\nThe Gripsholm Runestone is one of about 26 Ingvar runestones, which were raised to commemorate those who died in a Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled around 1036-1041. This particular stone was discovered in the 19th century, having been used as a doorstep in Gripsholm Castle. It now stands near the castle. The inscription is notable for its poetic verse about the journey.\n\n<<<Sö 179>>>"
