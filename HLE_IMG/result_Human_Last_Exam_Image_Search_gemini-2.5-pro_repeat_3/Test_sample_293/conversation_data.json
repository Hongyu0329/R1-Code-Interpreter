    "The histopathological diagnosis for the provided image is **Crescentic Glomerulonephritis**.\n\nThis diagnosis is based on the following key features visible in the micrograph:\n\n*   **Glomerular Crescent Formation:** The most prominent feature is the large, crescent-shaped, cellular proliferation that fills Bowman's space (the area between the glomerulus and the outer capsule). This crescent is composed of proliferating parietal epithelial cells and infiltrating inflammatory cells, which are compressing the central glomerular tuft.\n*   **Hypercellularity:** The glomerular tuft itself is hypercellular, meaning there is an increased number of cells within the capillaries and mesangium.\n*   **Compressed Glomerular Tuft:** The voluminous crescent is squeezing the capillary loops of the glomerulus into a condensed, smaller structure.\n\nCrescentic glomerulonephritis is a pattern of severe glomerular injury, not a single disease. It is clinically referred to as Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN) because it leads to a rapid decline in kidney function over days to weeks. The presence of crescents in over 50% of glomeruli in a biopsy is a hallmark of this condition.\n\nFurther classification of crescentic glomerulonephritis depends on immunofluorescence and serological findings, which categorize it into three main types:\n\n1.  **Type I (Anti-GBM Antibody Disease):** Caused by antibodies against the glomerular basement membrane (GBM).\n2.  **Type II (Immune Complex-Mediated):** Associated with diseases like lupus nephritis or post-infectious glomerulonephritis, where immune complexes deposit in the glomeruli.\n3.  **Type III (Pauci-Immune):** Characterized by a lack of significant immune deposits and is typically associated with ANCA vasculitis (e.g., granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis).\n\nWithout immunofluorescence or clinical history, the light microscopy image alone points conclusively to the morphological diagnosis of crescentic glomerulonephritis.\n\n<<<Crescentic Glomerulonephritis>>>"
