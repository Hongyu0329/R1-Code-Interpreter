    "The figure leaving the chariot is the mythological Greek princess Hippodamia.\n\nThis Apulian red-figure vase depicts a famous scene from Greek mythology: the abduction of Hippodamia by Pelops. The key figures in this scene are:\n\n*   **Hippodamia:** The woman being carried away in the chariot. Her father, King Oenomaus, was warned by a prophecy that he would be killed by his son-in-law. To prevent this, he would challenge each of his daughter's suitors to a chariot race; if the suitor lost, he would be killed.\n*   **Pelops:** The hero driving the chariot, identifiable by his distinctive Phrygian cap. He desired to marry Hippodamia and accepted the deadly challenge. According to most versions of the myth, Pelops won the race and Hippodamia's hand by bribing her father's charioteer, Myrtilus, to sabotage the king's chariot.\n*   **Oenomaus:** The figure lying on the ground, having been dragged to his death by his horses when his sabotaged chariot fell apart during the race.\n*   **Nike:** The small winged figure flying above the chariot represents Victory, symbolizing Pelops's triumph in the race.\n\nThe scene, therefore, captures the dramatic moment of Pelops escaping with Hippodamia after having won the deadly race against her father. The story of Pelops and Hippodamia was a popular subject in Greek art, particularly on vases from Southern Italy, and was considered the founding myth of the Olympic Games.<<<Hippodamia>>>"
