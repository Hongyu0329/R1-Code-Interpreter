    "The process depicted in the image is **septation** in the filamentous fungus *Aspergillus nidulans*.\n\nThis biological process is analogous to cytokinesis in animal cells, where a parent cell divides into two daughter cells. In filamentous fungi, septa are cross-walls that partition the long, thread-like structures called hyphae into individual cellular compartments.\n\nThe three panels (L, M, and N) show a time-lapse sequence of the formation of a new septum:\n*   The arrowheads point to the site where the new septum will form.\n*   This process involves the assembly of a ring-like structure made of proteins called septins at the division site.\n*   This septin ring acts as a scaffold, recruiting other proteins necessary to synthesize the new cell wall that grows inwards from the outer wall, eventually forming a complete partition.\n*   Panel L shows a mature hypha with an existing septum.\n*   Panels M and N illustrate the progressive formation of a new septum at the location indicated by the arrowheads, showing a characteristic swelling before the final cross-wall is completed.\n\nSeptation is crucial for the normal growth, development, and survival of filamentous fungi, particularly in response to cell wall stress.\n\n<<<septation in a filamentous fungus>>>"
