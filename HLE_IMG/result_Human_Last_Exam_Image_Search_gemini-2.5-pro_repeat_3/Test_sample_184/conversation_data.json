    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two products of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: 4π Electrocyclic Ring Opening**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reaction Type:** The first step is a thermal (indicated by Δ) 4π electrocyclic ring opening of a cyclobutene derivative. The starting material is 1-methoxy-4-methyl-4-methoxycyclobutene. It possesses a single chiral center at C4, with the methyl (Me) group pointing out (wedge) and the methoxy (OMe) group pointing in (dash).\n2.  **Apply Woodward-Hoffmann Rules:** For a thermal 4π electrocyclic reaction, the ring opening must proceed in a **conrotatory** fashion. This means the substituents on the breaking C3-C4 bond rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise).\n3.  **Determine the Product Constitution:** The ring opening of the cyclobutene `C1(MeO)=C2(H)-C3(H2)-C4(Me,OMe)` breaks the C3-C4 bond to form a conjugated 1,3-butadiene. The connectivity of the resulting diene is `C4(Me,OMe)=C1(MeO)-C2(H)=C3(H2)`. The structure is `(Me)(OMe)C=C(MeO)-CH=CH2`.\n4.  **Determine the Product Stereochemistry:** The stereocenter at C4 in the cyclobutene is converted into the planar, sp²-hybridized C4 of the diene. However, the chirality is not lost. The stereospecific conrotatory opening transfers the point chirality of the starting material into the planar/axial chirality of the resulting diene. This produces a single, specific chiral diene enantiomer (or a specific diastereomer if new stereocenters were formed, which is not the case here).\n\n**Step 2: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n\n1.  **Identify the Diene and Dienophile:**\n    *   **Diene:** The chiral diene formed in Step 1: `(Me)(OMe)C=C(MeO)-CH=CH2`.\n    *   **Dienophile:** Ethyl acrylate (`CH2=CH-CO2Et`).\n2.  **Determine the Regioselectivity:** The Diels-Alder reaction can proceed with two different regiochemical orientations (\"ortho\" or \"meta\").\n    *   The C1 position of the diene (`C(Me,OMe)`) is extremely sterically hindered.\n    *   To minimize steric repulsion, the bulky C1 of the diene will preferentially attack the less substituted carbon of the dienophile (`CH2`).\n    *   Consequently, the C4 of the diene (`CH2`) will attack the more substituted carbon of the dienophile (`CH(CO2Et)`).\n    *   This leads to the **\"meta\" adduct**, which corresponds to the constitutional isomer shown in products **C, D, G, and H**. In these products, the `CO2Et` group is at the C4 position of the newly formed cyclohexene ring.\n3.  **Determine the Stereoselectivity:**\n    *   **Stereocenter C6:** The stereochemistry at C6 of the product is determined by the stereochemistry of the C4 atom in the original cyclobutene. The drawing shows Me with a wedge and OMe with a dash. This stereochemical information is retained through the reaction sequence. Therefore, the products must have the Me group as a wedge and the OMe group as a dash at C6. This narrows down the possibilities to products **C and G** (and also A and E for the other regioisomer).\n    *   **Stereocenter C4:** The question specifies that the reaction occurs in an **endo** fashion. The chiral diene has two non-equivalent, diastereotopic faces. The achiral dienophile can approach from either face.\n        *   Endo attack on one face of the diene will lead to one diastereomeric product.\n        *   Endo attack on the other face will lead to the other diastereomeric product.\n    *   These two products will have the same stereochemistry at C6 (determined by the starting material) but opposite stereochemistry at the newly formed C4 center.\n4.  **Identify the Final Products:** Let's examine products C and G:\n    *   **Product C:** C6 has Me (wedge) and OMe (dash). C4 has CO2Et (dash).\n    *   **Product G:** C6 has Me (wedge) and OMe (dash). C4 has CO2Et (wedge).\n\n    Products C and G fit all the requirements:\n    *   They have the correct \"meta\" constitutional structure.\n    *   They have the correct stereochemistry at C6, derived from the starting material.\n    *   They are epimers at C4, consistent with being the two diastereomers formed from endo attack on the two different faces of the chiral diene.\n\nTherefore, the two products formed are C and G.\n\n<<<C and G>>>"
