    "To determine which triangulation violates the empty circle property of Delaunay triangulations, we must first understand the property itself.\n\n**Delaunay Triangulation and the Empty Circle Property**\n\nA triangulation of a set of points is a Delaunay triangulation if it satisfies the empty circle property. This property states that for every triangle in the triangulation, the unique circle that passes through its three vertices (the circumcircle) must contain no other point from the set in its interior.\n\nAn equivalent condition, often easier to assess visually, involves the angles. A Delaunay triangulation maximizes the minimum angle of all triangles in the set, avoiding long, skinny triangles where possible.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\n*   **A and C:** These appear to be valid triangulations. The triangles are relatively well-shaped, and it is not immediately obvious that any circumcircle would contain another point. They appear to be plausible Delaunay triangulations.\n*   **D:** This figure is not a valid triangulation. A triangulation is a planar graph, meaning its edges should not cross. In figure D, multiple edges intersect, so it cannot be a Delaunay triangulation.\n*   **B:** This is a valid triangulation, but it contains a clear violation of the empty circle property. Consider the four points on the right side of the figure. They form a convex quadrilateral. This quadrilateral is divided into two triangles by a diagonal. One of these triangles, formed by the two rightmost outer points and the bottom-right inner point, is a very skinny, obtuse triangle. For an obtuse triangle, the center of its circumcircle lies outside the triangle itself. Due to the obtuse angle, the circumcircle is very large and bulges out, clearly enclosing the fourth point of the quadrilateral (the top-right inner point) within its interior. This is a direct violation of the empty circle property.\n\nTherefore, the triangulation in figure B violates the empty circle property.\n\n<<<B>>>"
