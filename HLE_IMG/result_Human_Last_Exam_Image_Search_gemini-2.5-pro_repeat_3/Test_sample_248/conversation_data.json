    "The image displays several species common to a rocky intertidal habitat, including barnacles and various snails. Among these, the species that definitively indicates the photograph was taken on the Atlantic Coast rather than the Pacific Coast is the common periwinkle.\n\nThe common periwinkle is native to the northeastern Atlantic coasts of Europe and was introduced to North America in the mid-19th century. Its range in North America extends from Labrador, Canada, down to New Jersey in the United States. It is now the most common marine snail along the North Atlantic coast.\n\nWhile there have been sporadic introductions of the common periwinkle to the Pacific Coast, often through the live seafood trade, these have not resulted in established, self-sustaining populations. Therefore, its presence as a dominant, free-living organism in a natural tide pool setting, as shown in the photo, is a clear indicator of an Atlantic coastal location.\n\nAnother potential indicator in the photo is the Atlantic dogwinkle (*Nucella lapillus*), a predatory sea snail. Its natural range is also restricted to the North Atlantic Ocean, on both the European and North American coasts. The larger snails in the image are consistent with the appearance of the Atlantic dogwinkle, which coexists with the common periwinkle in this habitat.\n\n<<<*Littorina littorea*>>>"
