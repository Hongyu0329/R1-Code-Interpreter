    "Here is a step-by-step solution to find the total area of the shaded regions.\n\n### 1. Analyze a Single Shaded Region\n\nLet's focus on the blue shaded region on the left. The reasoning for the red region on the right will be identical due to symmetry.\n\nThe blue shaded region is formed by taking a right-angled triangle and subtracting a circular sector from it.\n\n*   **The Triangle:**\n    *   Let the center of the circle be vertex 'O'.\n    *   Let the point of tangency on the arc be 'L'.\n    *   Let the outer vertex be 'M'.\n    *   The triangle is OLM. The diagram shows a right angle at L, which means the side ML is tangent to the circle at point L.\n    *   The length of the radius, side OL, is given as 34.\n    *   The length of the tangent segment, side ML, is given as 17.\n    *   The area of the right-angled triangle OLM is:\n        Area_triangle = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * OL * ML = (1/2) * 34 * 17 = 289.\n\n*   **The Circular Sector:**\n    *   The triangle OLM contains a sector of the circle. This sector has its center at O, a radius R = 34, and an angle that we'll call θ (which is the angle LOM).\n    *   We can find θ using trigonometry in the right-angled triangle OLM:\n        tan(θ) = opposite / adjacent = ML / OL = 17 / 34 = 1/2.\n    *   Therefore, the angle in radians is θ = arctan(0.5).\n    *   The area of a circular sector is given by the formula `(angle_in_radians / 2) * R²`.\n    *   Area_sector = (arctan(0.5) / 2) * 34² = (arctan(0.5) / 2) * 1156 = 578 * arctan(0.5).\n\n*   **Area of One Shaded Region:**\n    *   The area of the blue shaded region is the area of the triangle minus the area of the sector.\n    *   Area_one_region = Area_triangle - Area_sector = 289 - 578 * arctan(0.5).\n\n### 2. Calculate the Total Shaded Area\n\nThe figure shows two identical shaded regions (one blue, one red). Therefore, the total shaded area is twice the area of one region.\n\n*   Total_Area = 2 * Area_one_region\n*   Total_Area = 2 * (289 - 578 * arctan(0.5))\n*   Total_Area = 578 - 1156 * arctan(0.5)\n\nThe note about an overlapping area in the problem description appears to be a potentially confusing hint. The diagram clearly shows two separate shaded regions. The calculation based on the clear information in the diagram leads to the result above. This result can also be found by taking the sum of the areas of the two large triangles (2 * 289 = 578) and subtracting the area of the central unshaded sector, which has an angle of 2θ (Area = (2θ/2)*R² = θ*R² = 1156 * arctan(0.5)). This confirms the result.\n\nThe final exact area is given by the expression:\n\n**578 - 1156 * arctan(0.5)**\n\nUsing a calculator, this is approximately 42.023.\n\n<<<578 - 1156 * arctan(0.5)>>>"
