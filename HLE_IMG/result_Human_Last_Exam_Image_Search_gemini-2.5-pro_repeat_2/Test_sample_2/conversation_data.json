    "To determine the time complexity of the given algorithm, we can analyze its recursive structure.\n\nThe algorithm is defined as:\n`def sort(a, n):`\n`    if n > 1:`\n`        sort(a, n - 1)`\n`        if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:`\n`            swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`\n`        sort(a, n - 1)`\n\nLet's define T(n) as the time taken by the algorithm for an input of size `n`.\n\n1.  **Base Case:** When `n <= 1`, the function does nothing and returns. This takes constant time, which we can denote as O(1).\n\n2.  **Recursive Step:** When `n > 1`, the function performs the following operations:\n    *   It makes a recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)`. The time for this is T(n - 1).\n    *   It performs a comparison and an optional swap. This takes constant time, O(1).\n    *   It makes a second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)`. The time for this is also T(n - 1).\n\nBy adding the time for these operations, we can write a recurrence relation for T(n):\nT(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1) + T(n - 1)\nT(n) = 2T(n - 1) + c (where 'c' is a constant for the O(1) operations)\n\nThis recurrence relation is independent of the actual values in the array, so the worst-case, average-case, and best-case complexities will be the same.\n\nTo solve this recurrence, we can expand it:\n*   T(n) = 2T(n - 1) + c\n*   T(n) = 2(2T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4T(n - 2) + 2c + c\n*   T(n) = 4(2T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c\n*   ...after k steps...\n*   T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)\n\nThe sum is a geometric series which equals `2^k - 1`.\nT(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^k - 1)\n\nWe continue until we reach the base case T(1). This happens when `n - k = 1`, so `k = n - 1`. Substituting `k = n - 1`:\nT(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)\n\nSince T(1) is a constant, this expression is dominated by the `2^(n-1)` term. Therefore, the time complexity is O(2^n). This exponential growth is characteristic of recurrence relations of the form `T(n) = aT(n-k) + f(n)` where `a > 1`. The structure of this recursion is famously similar to the Tower of Hanoi problem, which also has a complexity of O(2^n).\n\n<<<E>>>"
