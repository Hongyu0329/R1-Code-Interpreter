    "The circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397 form an F-sharp half-diminished seventh chord, which functions as a secondary leading-tone chord. The precise Roman numeral for this chord is **viiø⁷/iv**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the analysis:\n*   **Key Signature:** The piece is in D minor.\n*   **Notes:** The circled notes, when combined from both the treble and bass clefs, are F-sharp, A, C-natural, and E.\n*   **Chord Quality:** These notes spell out an F-sharp half-diminished seventh chord (F#m7b5). A half-diminished seventh chord is built with a root, a minor third, a diminished fifth, and a minor seventh (F#-A-C-E).\n*   **Harmonic Function:** In the key of D minor, the F-sharp acts as the leading tone to G. The G minor chord is the subdominant (iv) of D minor. Therefore, the F-sharp half-diminished seventh chord is functioning as a secondary, or applied, leading-tone chord that resolves to the subdominant.\n*   **Roman Numeral:** The Roman numeral for a secondary leading-tone chord is \"vii\" followed by its quality (in this case, \"ø⁷\" for half-diminished) and a slash indicating the chord it is leading to (\"/iv\").\n\nThis type of chromatic harmony is characteristic of the dramatic and improvisatory nature of a \"fantasia\" and adds emotional depth to the music.\n\n<<<viiø⁷/iv>>>"
