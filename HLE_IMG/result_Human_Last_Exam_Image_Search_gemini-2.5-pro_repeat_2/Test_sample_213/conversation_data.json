    "The piece of sheet music is the opening of the second act of the opera **Wozzeck** by the Austrian composer **Alban Berg**.\n\nThe visual evidence of the score, including the instrumentation (2 große Flöten, Englischhorn, etc.), the complex and chromatic musical language, and the German performance directions (\"Vorhang,\" \"mit Dämpfer\"), strongly points to this work. Composed between 1914 and 1922, *Wozzeck* is a seminal work of the early 20th century and is considered one of the first and most famous avant-garde operas. It is based on the incomplete play *Woyzeck* by Georg Büchner.\n\nThe opera is structured in three acts, with each act containing five scenes. The provided score represents the beginning of Act II, Scene 1, which functions as the first movement (a Sonata movement) of a five-movement symphony that structures the entire second act. A look at the full score available through IMSLP confirms that the provided image is indeed the first page of the second act of *Wozzeck*.\n\n<<<Wozzeck>>>"
