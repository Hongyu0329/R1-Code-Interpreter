    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. First, we identify the chiral centers and then assign the configuration (R or S) to each one.\n\n**1. IUPAC Name and Chiral Centers**\n\nThe molecule's structure is `HO-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2NH2`. Following IUPAC nomenclature, the principal functional group is the amine, so we number the longest carbon chain starting from the carbon adjacent to the NH2 group.\n\nThe longest chain has five carbons. The IUPAC name is **3-Ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-methylpentan-1-amine**.\n\nThe chiral centers are located at carbons C2, C3, and C4.\n\n**2. 3D Representation**\n\nThe provided image is a perspective drawing where the main carbon chain (backbone) is depicted as a zig-zag in the plane of the page. The wedged (solid) bonds point out of the page, and the dashed bonds point into the page. Implicit hydrogen atoms are placed to complete the tetrahedral geometry at each chiral center.\n\n*   **At C4:** The -OH group is on a dashed bond (in), so the implicit -H must be on a solid wedge (out).\n*   **At C3:** The ethyl group is on a solid wedge (out), so the implicit -H must be on a dashed bond (in).\n*   **At C2:** The methyl group is on a dashed bond (in), so the implicit -H must be on a solid wedge (out).\n\n**3. Assigning Configurations (R/S)**\n\nWe will now assign priorities to the substituents on each chiral center and determine the configuration.\n\n**Configuration at C4:**\n*   **Priorities:** 1: -OH, 2: -C3, 3: -CH3 (C5), 4: -H.\n*   **Orientation:** The lowest priority group (-H) is pointing out of the page (solid wedge).\n*   **Tracing:** The path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (-OH → -C3 → -CH3) is clockwise.\n*   **Assignment:** Since the lowest priority group points out, we reverse the result. Clockwise (R) becomes **S**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The configuration at C4 is **(4S)**.\n\n**Configuration at C3:**\n*   **Priorities:** We compare the groups attached to C3:\n    1.  -C4 (attached to O, C, H)\n    2.  -C2 (attached to C, C, H)\n    3.  -Ethyl (attached to C, H, H)\n    4.  -H\n*   **Orientation:** The lowest priority group (-H) is pointing into the page (dashed bond).\n*   **Tracing:** The path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (-C4 → -C2 → -Ethyl) is clockwise.\n*   **Assignment:** Since the lowest priority group points in, the configuration is as traced. Clockwise is **R**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The configuration at C3 is **(3R)**.\n\n**Configuration at C2:**\n*   **Priorities:** We compare the groups attached to C2:\n    1.  -CH2NH2 (the carbon is bonded to a nitrogen)\n    2.  -C3 (the carbon is bonded to C, C, H)\n    3.  -CH3 (the carbon is bonded to H, H, H)\n    4.  -H\n*   **Orientation:** The lowest priority group (-H) is pointing out of the page (solid wedge).\n*   **Tracing:** The path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (-CH2NH2 → -C3 → -CH3) is clockwise.\n*   **Assignment:** Since the lowest priority group points out, we reverse the result. Clockwise (R) becomes **S**.\n*   **Conclusion:** The configuration at C2 is **(2S)**.\n\nCombining the configurations for all chiral centers, the absolute configuration of the molecule is (2S, 3R, 4S).\n\n<<< (2S, 3R, 4S)>>>"
