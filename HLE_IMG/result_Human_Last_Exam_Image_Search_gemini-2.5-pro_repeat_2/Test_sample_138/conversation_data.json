    "Here are the biological sexes for each pair of insects:\n\n**Pair A: Male, Female (M, F)**\nThe insects in pair A are cuckoo bees, likely of the genus *Triepeolus*. These bees are cleptoparasites, meaning the females lay their eggs in the nests of other bee species, and therefore lack scopae (pollen-collecting hairs). A general rule for sexing many bee species is that males have longer antennae (13 segments) and more abdominal segments (7) than females, who have shorter antennae (12 segments) and fewer abdominal segments (6). The individual on the left (A, left) exhibits the characteristically long antennae of a male bee. The individual on the right (A, right) has shorter antennae, indicating it is a female.\n\n**Pair B: Male, Male (M, M)**\nThe insects in pair B are paper wasps of the genus *Polistes*. Wasps are pollinators that do not have scopae. In many *Polistes* species, males can be distinguished from females by their longer, often curled, antennae. Females have a stinger, while males do not. Both individuals in this pair display the long, curled antennae characteristic of male paper wasps.\n\n**Pair C: Male, Female (M, F)**\nThe insects in pair C belong to a taxon where the females lack scopae on their legs. This condition is met by bees in the family Megachilidae (leafcutter and mason bees), whose females carry pollen on a scopa located on the underside of their abdomen instead of their legs. The individual on the left (C, left) has very long antennae and a hairy face, which are classic traits of a male bee. Male bees do not collect pollen and thus lack scopae. The individual on the right (C, right) has noticeably shorter antennae, identifying it as a female.\n\nTherefore, the correct sequence of sexes is M, F for pair A; M, M for pair B; and M, F for pair C. This corresponds to options 3, 1, and 3 respectively.\n\n3, 1, 3<<<3, 1, 3>>>"
