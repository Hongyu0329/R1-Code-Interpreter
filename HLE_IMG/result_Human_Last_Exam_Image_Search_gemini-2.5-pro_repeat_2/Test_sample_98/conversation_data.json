    "This medallion is a Sarmatian phalera, a decorative plaque for horse harnesses, dating back to the Hellenistic period. This particular style of phalera, with figurative representations, is attributed by archaeologists to the 2nd to 1st centuries BC.\n\nThe figures depicted are likely from Greek mythology, with the horned figure representing a syncretic deity like Zeus-Ammon or a satyr. These artifacts are associated with the Sarmatians, an Iranian equestrian nomadic people who dominated the Pontic steppe. A similar phalera, made from a Hellenistic silver cup, was dated to the late-2nd or mid-1st century BC.\n\n<<<2nd-1st century B.C.>>>"
