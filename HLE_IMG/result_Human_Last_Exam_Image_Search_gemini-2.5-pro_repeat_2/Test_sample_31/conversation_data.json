    "The knot in the picture is the **8₁₉ knot** in the Rolfsen table. This knot is also known as the pretzel knot P(-2, 3, 3) and the torus knot T(4, 3).\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant, often denoted as s(K), is an integer-valued knot invariant derived from Khovanov homology. For the 8₁₉ knot, the Rasmussen invariant is **-6**.\n\n<<<−6>>>"
