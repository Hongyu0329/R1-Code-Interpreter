    "To determine that the photo was taken on the Atlantic rather than the Pacific Coast, we must identify a species present that is exclusive to the Atlantic. A close examination of the organisms in the image reveals several common intertidal species, including barnacles and two types of snails.\n\nThe most definitive species for this purpose is the Common Periwinkle, identifiable as the small, dark, ribbed snails in the photograph. This species has the scientific name *Littorina littorea*.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the key species and their distribution:\n\n*   ***Littorina littorea*** **(Common Periwinkle):** Native to the northeastern Atlantic coasts of Europe, this snail was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the mid-19th century. It is now abundant on rocky shores from Labrador, Canada, down to New Jersey and is considered the most common marine snail along the North Atlantic coast. While there have been sporadic sightings on the West Coast, from California to Washington, established and sustained populations have not been documented there. Its overwhelming prevalence and established range are characteristic of the Atlantic coast.\n\n*   ***Nucella lapillus*** **(Atlantic Dog Whelk):** The larger, lighter-colored snails are likely Atlantic Dog Whelks. This species is found throughout the littoral zone of the North Atlantic. On the North American side, its range extends from Long Island, New York, northward to Greenland, but it is not found on the Pacific coast.\n\n*   ***Semibalanus balanoides*** **(Northern Rock Barnacle):** The barnacles seen in the image are consistent with the appearance of the Northern Rock Barnacle. This species is found on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America, making it unsuitable for distinguishing between the two oceans.\n\nBecause *Littorina littorea* is firmly established and abundant on the Atlantic coast but not on the Pacific, its presence is the clearest indicator that the photograph was taken in the Atlantic intertidal zone.\n\n<<<*Littorina littorea*>>>"
