    "The image displays a phenomenon known as the **auditory continuity illusion** or **perceptual restoration of sound**. This auditory illusion occurs when a sound, such as the pure tone shown in the image, is interrupted by a brief burst of another sound, like noise.\n\nAs depicted in the image's top panel (a spectrogram), a continuous tone is physically replaced by a short burst of noise. However, the auditory system often \"fills in\" the gap, leading to the perception that the original tone continues uninterrupted through the noise. This is a common and typically unconscious perceptual ability that helps in understanding speech and other sounds in noisy environments.\n\nFor the illusion to be effective, the interrupting noise must be loud enough and have the right characteristics to convincingly mask the deletion of the original sound. This perceptual \"filling-in\" is not limited to simple tones; it also occurs with more complex and varied sounds like speech and music. When a missing speech sound is perceptually restored, the effect is often specifically called the phonemic restoration effect. This ability demonstrates how the brain uses context and expectations to construct a coherent and continuous auditory experience from incomplete sensory information.\n\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion>>>"
