    "A Delaunay triangulation is a specific way of connecting a set of points to form triangles. Its defining feature is the **empty circle property**: for every triangle in the triangulation, the unique circle that passes through its three vertices (the circumcircle) must not contain any other points from the set in its interior.\n\nTo determine which of the given triangulations violate this property, we can inspect each one:\n\n*   **Triangulation A:** This triangulation violates the empty circle property. For example, consider the triangle formed by the three leftmost points (the bottom-left outer point, the side-left outer point, and the top-left inner point). The circumcircle of this long, thin triangle would be very large and would contain the bottom inner point.\n*   **Triangulation B:** This triangulation appears to be a valid Delaunay triangulation. The triangles are relatively \"fat,\" and for any given triangle, its circumcircle does not seem to enclose any other points. This configuration maximizes the minimum angle of all triangles in the mesh, a known property of Delaunay triangulations.\n*   **Triangulation C:** This triangulation clearly violates the empty circle property. It contains several long, \"skinny\" triangles. For instance, the circumcircle of the triangle formed by the two bottom outer points and the bottom inner point visibly contains the other two inner points.\n*   **Triangulation D:** This figure is not a valid triangulation because it is not a planar graph; its edges cross each other. A triangulation must divide the plane into triangles without any edge crossings. Since it fails this fundamental requirement of a triangulation, it inherently cannot be a Delaunay triangulation.\n\nTherefore, triangulations A and C violate the empty circle property.\n\nA,C.\n<<<A,C.>>>"
