**Product A** is the dihydropyrrolizine product formed from the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between the azomethine ylide of N-acetyl-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)proline and methyl propiolate, where the imine group of the dihydropyrrole substituent has been subsequently reduced.
**Product B** is a pyrrole derivative formed from the initial cycloaddition product via a thermal elimination of ethene.
**Product C** is N-acetyl-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)proline, formed by the direct acetylation of the starting material.
