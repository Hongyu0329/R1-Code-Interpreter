    "The reaction scheme involves three sequential transformations. To determine the molecular formula of the final product, each step will be analyzed to track the change in atomic composition.\n\n**Step 1: Deprotection of the PMB group**\n\nThe starting material is reacted with ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) in a mixture of acetonitrile (ACN) and water. CAN is a strong oxidizing agent commonly used for the cleavage of *p*-methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers and amines. In this reaction, the PMB group attached to the nitrogen atom is removed and replaced by a hydrogen atom, yielding Intermediate 1.\n\n*   **Starting Material Molecular Formula:** The bicyclic core of the starting material, including the trifluoromethyl (CF3) and carbonyl (=O) groups, has a formula of C7H5F3NO. The PMB group (-CH2C6H4OCH3) has a formula of C8H9O. Combining these gives the starting material's molecular formula: **C15H14F3NO2**.\n*   **Transformation:** The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen.\n*   **Change in Formula:** -C8H9O + H = -C8H8O\n*   **Intermediate 1 Molecular Formula:** C15H14F3NO2 - C8H8O = **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n**Step 2: Catalytic Hydrogenation**\n\nIntermediate 1 is treated with hydrogen gas (H2) and a palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst in methanol (MeOH). This is a standard catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The Pd/C catalyst facilitates the addition of hydrogen across the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) within the bicyclic system, saturating it to a single bond (C-C).\n\n*   **Intermediate 1 Molecular Formula:** C7H6F3NO\n*   **Transformation:** Addition of one molecule of hydrogen (H2) across the double bond.\n*   **Change in Formula:** + H2\n*   **Intermediate 2 Molecular Formula:** C7H6F3NO + H2 = **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Acidic Hydrolysis of the Lactam**\n\nIntermediate 2 is heated in the presence of strong aqueous acid (4 N HCl). Intermediate 2 is a bicyclic lactam (a cyclic amide). Under these conditions, the lactam undergoes hydrolysis. The amide bond within the ring is cleaved by the addition of a water molecule (H2O), opening the ring to form a product containing both an amino group (-NH2, which will be protonated to -NH3+ in the acidic medium) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\n*   **Intermediate 2 Molecular Formula:** C7H8F3NO\n*   **Transformation:** Addition of one molecule of water (H2O) to hydrolyze the lactam.\n*   **Change in Formula:** + H2O\n*   **Product Molecular Formula:** C7H8F3NO + H2O = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\nFollowing the sequence of reactions, the molecular formula of the final product is determined by summing the atomic changes at each step.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
