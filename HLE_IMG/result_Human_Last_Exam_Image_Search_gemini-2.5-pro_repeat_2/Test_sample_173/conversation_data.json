    "To determine the time signature of the musical measure provided, we need to count the total value of the notes and rests within it. A time signature consists of two numbers; the top number indicates how many beats are in a measure, and the bottom number indicates what type of note gets one beat.\n\n**Analysis of the Treble Clef (Top Staff):**\n\n*   The measure is composed entirely of sixteenth notes and sixteenth rests. A sixteenth note receives one-quarter of a beat in time signatures with a 4 on the bottom.\n*   The first beat consists of one sixteenth rest followed by three sixteenth notes.\n*   The second beat also contains a sixteenth rest followed by three sixteenth notes.\n*   The third and fourth beats each contain a group of four sixteenth notes.\n*   Counting the total number of sixteenth notes (and rests) in the treble clef: there are 16 sixteenth notes in total (4 per beat). Since four sixteenth notes equal one quarter note, this measure contains the equivalent of four quarter notes.\n\n**Analysis of the Bass Clef (Bottom Staff):**\n\n*   The bass clef contains a single whole note chord. A whole note sustains for four quarter note beats.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth the treble and bass clefs indicate that the measure contains a total of four quarter-note beats. Therefore, the time signature is 4/4. This is also known as \"common time\".\n\n<<<C>>>"
