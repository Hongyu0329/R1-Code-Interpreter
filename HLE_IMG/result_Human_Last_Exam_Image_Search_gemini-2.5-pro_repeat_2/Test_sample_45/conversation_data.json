    "The tiling in the image exhibits **10-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\nThis type of pattern is known as an aperiodic tiling, and it is closely related to quasicrystals and Islamic Girih tiles. Here's a breakdown of its symmetry:\n\n*   **Identifying the Pattern:** The tiling is constructed from a set of shapes, including decagons (10-sided polygons), elongated hexagons, and bow-tie-shaped hexagons. These specific tiles are known as Girih tiles, which have been used in Islamic architecture since around 1200 C.E.\n\n*   **Rotational Symmetry:** The overall pattern has points around which it can be rotated by a fraction of a full circle to produce an identical image. In this tiling, there are prominent decagonal \"star\" motifs. The center of each of these motifs is a point of 10-fold rotational symmetry. This means the tiling remains unchanged after a rotation of 36 degrees (360/10).\n\n*   **Aperiodicity and Quasicrystals:** While the tiling has rotational symmetry, it lacks translational symmetry, meaning it does not repeat in a simple grid-like pattern. This is a hallmark of aperiodic tilings. In 2007, physicists Peter Lu and Paul Steinhardt demonstrated that these medieval Islamic tilings possess properties consistent with quasicrystals, which were only formally described by modern mathematicians in the 1970s. Such tilings can be created using a set of prototiles, like Penrose tiles, that enforce aperiodic, yet orderly, structures.\n\nIn summary, the tiling is a sophisticated pattern with local centers of 10-fold rotational symmetry, a characteristic feature of decagonal quasicrystals.\n\n<<<10>>>"
