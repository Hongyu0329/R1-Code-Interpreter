The sheet music itself indicates a \"Medium Swing\" tempo, which is a common style for performing this piece. It is often played in a swing or traditional jazz style and has been recorded by numerous jazz artists, including Django Reinhardt and Louis Armstrong. In recent years, the term \"coquette\" has also been used to describe a whimsical and dreamy pop music aesthetic, though this is separate from the original song's genre.\n\n**Country of Origin:** The song was composed in 1928 by American composer Johnny Green and Canadian composer Carmen Lombardo, with lyrics by American lyricist Gus Kahn. Therefore, the song has both American and Canadian origins, though it is most closely associated with the American jazz and popular music scene of its time.<<<**Title:** Coquette\n**Musical Style:** Jazz Standard, Swing, Foxtrot\n**Country of Origin:** United States/Canada>>>"
