    "A face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, when viewed along the direction, exhibits a characteristic atomic arrangement. The direction in a cubic lattice is along a face diagonal. The projection of the atoms onto a plane perpendicular to this direction results in a centered rectangular pattern.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why the pattern in image D is correct:\n*   **FCC Structure:** In an FCC lattice, atoms are located at each corner of the cubic unit cell and at the center of each face.\n*   ** Projection:** When looking along the direction, the atoms from different layers of the crystal structure are projected onto a 2D plane.\n*   **Resulting Pattern:** This projection creates a repeating unit that is a rectangle with an atom at its center. The atoms at the corners of the rectangle come from atoms at the corners and two face-centers of the 3D unit cell, while the atom in the center of the rectangle comes from atoms on other faces. The planes of atoms in an FCC crystal are stacked in a way that creates this centered appearance when viewed from the direction.\n\nAnalyzing the given options:\n*   **A:** Shows a simple rectangular arrangement, not a centered one.\n*   **B:** The arrangement does not clearly show a repeating centered rectangular unit cell.\n*   **C:** The atoms are arranged sparsely and do not form a centered rectangular pattern.\n*   **D:** This image clearly shows a pattern of centered rectangles. There are atoms forming the corners of a rectangle, with another atom positioned in the center. This matches the known projection of an FCC lattice along the direction.\n\n<<<D.>>>"
