    "The product in the advertisement is **Bovril**.\n\nDuring World War II, Bovril was heavily advertised to British workers, particularly women who had taken on strenuous factory jobs, with the message that it provided strength and energy. Advertisements from the era celebrated the \"fine spirit\" of women tackling \"unaccustomed, strenuous, and often dangerous war tasks.\"\n\nThe name \"Bovril\" has a French connection. The product, a meat extract, was developed in the 1870s by a Scotsman, John Lawson Johnston, to fulfill a contract to supply one million cans of beef to the French army during the Franco-Prussian War. The first part of its name, \"Bo-\", comes from the Latin *bovīnus* (pertaining to an ox), which is also the root of the French word for beef, *bœuf*. The second part, \"-vril,\" was taken from a popular 1871 novel, \"The Coming Race,\" where \"Vril\" was an energy-giving fluid, thus associating the product with strength derived from an ox.\n\n<<<Bovril>>>"
