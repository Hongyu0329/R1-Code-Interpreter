    "The correct answer is **Silver Mirror**. This solution resolves both parts of the riddle.\n\n**The Pictured Clue:** The image displays a man receiving a shiny, spherical trophy. This reflective object can be described as a \"silver mirror.\"\n\n**The Toxicity Clue:** Historically, the primary method for making mirrors involved backing glass with a tin-mercury amalgam. This process has almost entirely ceased due to the high toxicity of mercury and the health risks it posed to workers. Modern mirrors are typically made using silver nitrate or aluminum.\n\nWhile there were several award ceremonies on or around June 20, 2019, including the broadcast of the AFI Life Achievement Award to Denzel Washington and the AILA Founders Award to Ron Klasko, the key to this riddle lies in the visual pun of the trophy and the historical context of the term.\n\n<<<Silver Mirror>>>"
