    "The square structure shown in the image is located near Redford in Presidio County, Texas, in an area historically known as El Polvo. The coordinates place it within a region of significant historical and archaeological importance called La Junta de los Ríos.\n\nThe structure is most likely the ruins of **Camp Polvo**, a U.S. Cavalry post that was active between 1916 and 1920 during the search for Pancho Villa. Descriptions of the area mention the ruins of an adobe cavalry fort and customs station.\n\n**Yes, this is a historic landmark.** The area of El Polvo, which includes the site of the historic Tapacolmes pueblo and a later Spanish mission, has been designated a State Archeological Landmark. The Polvo site (41PS21) was also added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 25, 1976.\n\nThe La Junta de los Ríos region, at the confluence of the Rio Grande and the Río Conchos, has been inhabited for centuries. It was home to various Native American groups, including the Jumano people, and was later a site of Spanish exploration and settlement, with numerous missions and pueblos established in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries.\n\n<<<The square structure is likely the ruins of Camp Polvo, a U.S. Cavalry post, located within the El Polvo/Redford area, which is a designated State Archeological Landmark and is on the National Register of Historic Places.>>>"
