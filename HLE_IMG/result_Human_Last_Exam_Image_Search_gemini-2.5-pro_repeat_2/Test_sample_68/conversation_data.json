    "This coin is a 9 Deniers piece minted for the French colonies in North America, an area often referred to as New France. The \"H\" mint mark indicates that it was produced at the La Rochelle mint in France in either 1721 or 1722.\n\nThe obverse of the coin displays the crowned double \"L\" monogram of King Louis XV, with the inscription \"SIT NOMEN DOMINI BENEDICTUM,\" which translates to \"Blessed be the name of the Lord.\" The reverse side, as seen in the image, clearly shows the words \"COLONIES FRANÃ‡OISES\" above the date and mint mark.\n\nThese coins were intended for circulation throughout France's vast territories in the New World. They were initially shipped to Quebec, Canada, and were intended for use in Louisiana, Acadia, and Canada. Historical and archaeological findings confirm their circulation in areas that are now part of the United States, including near the New Orleans settlement and in states such as Illinois, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida.\n\n<<<French America (New France)>>>"
