    "To find the value of the current I, we can use nodal analysis, a method for determining the voltage at various points (nodes) in a circuit.\n\n### 1. Circuit Interpretation:\n*   The circuit is powered by a 41 V DC source.\n*   The left vertical wire is at a potential of 41 V.\n*   The right vertical wire is connected to the ground, meaning it is at a potential of 0 V.\n*   There are five resistors with values of 76 Ω, 8 Ω, 14 Ω, 11 Ω, and 29 Ω.\n*   The current `I` is the current flowing out of the junction connected to the 8 Ω resistor and into the part of the circuit containing the 14 Ω and 29 Ω resistors.\n\n### 2. Nodal Analysis:\nWe need to determine the voltages at the two central nodes. Let's label them as follows:\n*   **Va**: The node connecting the 76 Ω, 14 Ω, and 11 Ω resistors.\n*   **Vb**: The node connecting the 8 Ω, 14 Ω, and 29 Ω resistors.\n\nBy applying Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL), which states that the sum of currents entering a node must equal the sum of currents leaving it, we can set up two equations.\n\n*   **Equation for Node Va:**\n    (Va - 41) / 76 + Va / 11 + (Va - Vb) / 14 = 0\n\n*   **Equation for Node Vb:**\n    (Vb - 41) / 8 + Vb / 29 + (Vb - Va) / 14 = 0\n\n### 3. Calculation:\nSolving this system of two linear equations gives the voltage at node Vb:\n*   Vb ≈ 26.48 V\n\nThe current `I` is the current that flows from the 41 V source through the 8 Ω resistor to node Vb. We can calculate this using Ohm's Law (I = V/R). The voltage difference across the 8 Ω resistor is (41 V - Vb).\n\n*   I = (41 V - 26.48 V) / 8 Ω\n*   I = 14.52 V / 8 Ω\n*   I = 1.815 A\n\nThe value of the current I is approximately 1.815 Amperes.\n\n<<<1.815>>>"
