    "To determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Path√©tique\" Sonata, a harmonic analysis is required.\n\nThe key signature of the movement is C minor. Measure 30, which is part of a connecting episode, contains the notes G, B-natural, D, and F, played as broken chords between the right and left hands.\n\nWhen stacked, these notes form a G dominant seventh chord (G7). In the key of C minor, the dominant chord is built on the fifth scale degree, which is G. Therefore, a G7 chord functions as the dominant seventh. The Roman numeral for a dominant seventh chord is V7.\n\nSome analyses might refer to this as part of a passage featuring augmented 6th chords, which also appear in this section (e.g., measure 34). However, the specific harmony within measure 30 is a clear dominant seventh.\n\n<<<V7>>>"
