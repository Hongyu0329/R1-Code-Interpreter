    "The plant in the image is *Pittosporum cornifolium*, also known by its Māori name, tāwhiri karo.\n\nThis plant is endemic to New Zealand. It is found on the North Island and in the Marlborough Sounds of the South Island. While it can grow on the ground, it is often found as an epiphyte, growing on other trees in forests. It also grows on rock crevices and cliffs. Although considered rare and threatened in the wild on the main islands, it is more common on offshore islands in the north-east. There is also significant morphological variation in plants found on the Poor Knights Islands, which has led some to suggest it could be recognized as a distinct taxon.\n\n<<<North Island (New Zealand)>>>"
