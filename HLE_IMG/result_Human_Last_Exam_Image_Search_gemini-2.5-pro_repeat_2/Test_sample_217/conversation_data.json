    "The cuneiform sign in the image is known as √â. Its third-millennium form, as depicted, is a pictograph representing a house or a temple.\n\nThe Sumerian word for \"house\" or \"temple\" is √â, and the sign visually represents a building. This sign, transliterated as E2, is one of the earliest characters in cuneiform writing, which originated around 3000 B.C.E. The term √â is also found in compound words such as √â.GAL (íÇçíÉ≤), which means \"palace\" or literally \"big house\". Throughout the third millennium BCE, which corresponds to the Early to Middle Bronze Age, this sign was used in administrative and legal documents, such as contracts for the sale of a field and a house.\n\nTherefore, the correct meaning of the sign is \"Home.\"\n\n<<<D>>>"
