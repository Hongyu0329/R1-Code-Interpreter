    "The four characters on the seal, read in the traditional top-to-bottom, right-to-left order, are 學海無涯. In simplified Chinese, this is written as 学海无涯.\n\nThis is a common Chinese idiom, pronounced \"xué hǎi wú yá\". It translates to \"The sea of learning is boundless\". This phrase is an encouragement for continuous learning, suggesting that there is no limit to knowledge. It is a popular motif for stationery, calligraphy works, and seals, as seen in various online stores and art collections.\n\nThe traditional characters are:\n*   **學 (xué):** learn, study\n*   **海 (hǎi):** sea, ocean\n*   **無 (wú):** not have, without\n*   **涯 (yá):** border, horizon\n\nThe simplified characters are:\n*   **学 (xué)**\n*   **海 (hǎi)**\n*   **无 (wú)**\n*   **涯 (yá)**\n\n<<<学海无涯>>>"
