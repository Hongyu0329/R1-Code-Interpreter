    "The output of the provided Piet code is \"Piet\".\n\nThe program image, when interpreted by a Piet interpreter, pushes the ASCII character codes for 'P', 'i', 'e', and 't' onto the stack and then outputs them. The sequence of colors and their arrangement, including the subtle shifts in lightness that are difficult to discern by eye, encode the necessary `push` and `out(char)` commands. Specifically, the program executes a series of operations that result in the numbers 80, 105, 101, and 116 being pushed onto the stack, followed by four `out(char)` commands that print the corresponding ASCII characters.\n\n<<<Piet>>>"
