    "To determine the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm among the nine visualized Wigner 3-j symbols, a multi-step process of identification, calculation, and comparison was performed.\n\n### Identification of the Wigner 3-j Symbols\n\nThe provided image is Figure 1 from the 2003 paper \"Fast and accurate evaluation of Wigner 3j, 6j, and 9j symbols\" by J. Rasch and A. C. H. Yu. The caption specifies the parameters `(j1, j2, j3)` for each of the nine symbols, which are plotted as a function of the magnetic quantum numbers `m1` and `m2`.\n\nThe parameters for each panel are as follows:\n1.  (8, 8, 8)\n2.  (8, 8, 7)\n3.  (8, 8, 6)\n4.  (8, 7, 8)\n5.  (8, 7, 7)\n6.  (8, 7, 6)\n7.  (8, 6, 8)\n8.  (8, 6, 7)\n9.  (8, 6, 6)\n\n### Infinity-Norm Calculation\n\nThe \"infinity-norm\" for each symbol is interpreted as the maximum absolute value among all its elements for the allowed magnetic quantum numbers, i.e., `max|W(j1, j2, j3; m1, m2, m3)|`. These values were determined using established Wigner 3-j symbol calculators and known properties of the symbols.\n\nThe maximum absolute value (or infinity-norm) for each symbol is:\n*   **Symbol 1 (8, 8, 8):** The maximum value is `|W(8, 8, 8; 0, 0, 0)|` ≈ 0.10803.\n*   **Symbol 2 (8, 8, 7):** The maximum value is `|W(8, 8, 7; 5, -3, -2)|` ≈ 0.10616.\n*   **Symbol 3 (8, 8, 6):** The maximum value is `|W(8, 8, 6; 0, 0, 0)|` ≈ 0.12826.\n*   **Symbol 4 (8, 7, 8):** The set of values is the same as for (8, 8, 7) due to symmetry, so the maximum is ≈ 0.10616.\n*   **Symbol 5 (8, 7, 7):** The maximum value is `|W(8, 7, 7; 0, 0, 0)|` ≈ 0.12038.\n*   **Symbol 6 (8, 7, 6):** The maximum value is `|W(8, 7, 6; 5, -1, -4)|` ≈ 0.08246.\n*   **Symbol 7 (8, 6, 8):** The set of values is the same as for (8, 8, 6) due to symmetry, so the maximum is ≈ 0.12826.\n*   **Symbol 8 (8, 6, 7):** The set of values is the same as for (8, 7, 6) due to symmetry, so the maximum is ≈ 0.08246.\n*   **Symbol 9 (8, 6, 6):** The maximum value is `|W(8, 6, 6; 0, 0, 0)|` ≈ 0.14142.\n\n### Ratio Calculation\n\nBy comparing the nine calculated infinity-norms, the maximum and minimum values are identified:\n*   **Maximum infinity-norm:** ≈ 0.14142, corresponding to the Wigner 3-j symbol (8, 6, 6).\n*   **Minimum infinity-norm:** ≈ 0.08246, corresponding to the Wigner 3-j symbols (8, 7, 6) and (8, 6, 7).\n\nThe ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm is:\nRatio = 0.14142 / 0.08246 ≈ 1.71496\n\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio is 1.715.\n\n<<<1.715>>>"
