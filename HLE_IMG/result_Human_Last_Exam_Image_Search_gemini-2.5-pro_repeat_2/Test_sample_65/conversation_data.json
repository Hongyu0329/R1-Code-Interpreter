    "The bryophyte in the image belongs to the genus *Herbertus*. This identification is based on the plant's very characteristic appearance, which includes densely packed, scaly leaves that give the shoots a distinctive braided or cord-like look.\n\n*Herbertus* is a genus of leafy liverworts found worldwide. A key feature of this genus is that the leaves are deeply divided into two lobes, and the underleaves are similar in size and shape to the main lateral leaves. This arrangement of leaves and equally large underleaves gives the shoots a bushy, almost radially symmetrical appearance, which is evident in the photograph. The reddish-brown coloration on the older parts of the plant is also typical for species within this genus, such as *Herbertus aduncus*. While there are many species in the genus, the overall morphology shown in the picture is a clear indicator of *Herbertus*.\n\n<<<Herbertus>>>"
