    "Based on the visual information from the image and supporting documentation, the protein shown is **Crk-II** (also known as Proto-oncogene c-Crk).\n\nThe image corresponds to the crystal structure of the N-terminal SH2 domain of the human Crk-II protein. Crk-II is an adapter protein involved in signal transduction, linking tyrosine kinases to other cytoplasmic proteins. It plays a role in regulating cell growth, differentiation, and migration.\n\nThe structure of Crk-II consists of one SH2 (Src Homology 2) domain and two SH3 (Src Homology 3) domains. The image specifically shows the SH2 domain (in dark blue) which binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. The light blue portion represents an N-terminal extension, and the yellow stick figure highlights a specific residue or a bound molecule which, in some contexts, can be a phosphorylated tyrosine that regulates the protein's activity.\n\n<<<Crk-II>>>"
