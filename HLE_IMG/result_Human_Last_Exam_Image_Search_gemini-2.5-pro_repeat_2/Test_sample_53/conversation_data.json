    "The figure leaving the chariot is Hippolytus.\n\nThis Apulian red-figured pelike, attributed to the Chamay Painter and dated to circa 350-340 B.C., is housed in the British Museum under the registration number F307. The scene depicted is the death of Hippolytus.\n\nIn the composition, the winged figure of a Fury, a chthonic deity of vengeance, is shown startling the horses of Hippolytus' chariot. This causes the chariot to overturn, and Hippolytus is seen falling from it. Below, the figure lying on the ground is the personification of the sea, who is also recoiling in horror at the unfolding tragedy.\n\nAccording to Greek mythology, Hippolytus was the son of Theseus, the king of Athens. Hippolytus was a devout follower of the virgin goddess Artemis and scorned Aphrodite, the goddess of love. As revenge for this slight, Aphrodite caused Hippolytus's stepmother, Phaedra, to fall in love with him. After he rejected her advances, Phaedra falsely accused him of assault to Theseus, who then cursed his son. Theseus called upon his father, the sea god Poseidon, to punish Hippolytus. Poseidon sent a sea monster (in some versions, a bull from the sea) to frighten Hippolytus's horses, leading to his fatal fall from the chariot. The figure in oriental attire in the chariot with Hippolytus is likely a paidagogos, a tutor or attendant.\n\n<<<Hippolytus>>>"
