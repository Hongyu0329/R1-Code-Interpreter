    "Based on the visual elements presented in the image, the secret word is encrypted through a series of thematic clues that point to a specific piece of media.\n\nThe image contains several key elements:\n*   A background and foreground filled with visual noise, or **static**.\n*   A box in the top-left corner composed entirely of **static**.\n*   A general \"glitch art\" aesthetic, which is a form of visual **static**.\n\nThese elements strongly point to the 2015 video game titled *The Static Speaks My Name*. The game is described as a \"dark, sad, weird and funny first-person exploration game\" which aligns with the image's \"weirdcore\" aesthetic. The gameplay itself begins with the player entering a floating object that resembles a cloud of television static.\n\nThe other objects in the image, such as the anime-style character and the Minecraft cake, contribute to the overall surreal and glitchy tone of the artwork, which is reflective of the game's themes.\n\nThe most prominent and recurring theme in both the image and the game it references is the concept of \"static.\" Therefore, the static itself is the key to the encrypted word.\n\n<<<STATIC>>>"
