    "The author of this detail of the Altarpiece is Isaia da Pisa.\n\nThis circular marble relief is a detail from the Altar of the Holy Sacrament, which was originally located in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. The altar was commissioned by the French Cardinal Guillaume d'Estouteville in the mid-15th century and was sculpted by Isaia da Pisa, an Italian sculptor active in Rome between 1428 and 1464.\n\nThe altarpiece was later dismantled in 1573. While some parts of the altar are now lost, other fragments have been preserved. One notable surviving piece, the \"Upper Part of a Tabernacle for the Holy Sacrament,\" is currently housed in the Art Institute of Chicago. Another panel from the same altar remains in the sacristy of the Chapel of Sixtus V in the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. The relief in the image, depicting a communion scene and bearing the inscription \"SACRAMENT DE L'AUTEL\" (Sacrament of the Altar), is consistent in style and subject matter with the known work of Isaia da Pisa for this specific commission.\n\n<<<Isaia da Pisa>>>"
