    "To calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we first need to compute the total Car VMT for both the Baseline (Table 1) and Proposed (Table 2) scenarios.\n\nThe calculation can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n### 1. Understand the Formula\nVehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) for each scenario is the sum of VMT across all distance categories. For each category, the VMT is calculated as:\n\n*VMT (category) = (Share of Total Trips) x (Mode Share for Cars) x (Average Trip Distance)*\n\nThe total car mode share is the sum of the shares for \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\". The occupancy rate for carpools is not needed for calculating VMT, as VMT measures the miles traveled by the vehicle itself, not by the people inside it.\n\nFor simplicity, we can calculate a weighted VMT, assuming a total of 100 trips. The final percentage will be the same regardless of the total number of trips assumed.\n\n### 2. Calculate Baseline Car VMT (Table 1)\nWe calculate the VMT for each trip distance category and then sum them up.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 25% + 28% = 53%\n    *   VMT = (48% of trips) x (53% car share) x 1 mile = 0.48 x 0.53 x 1 = 0.2544\n\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   VMT = (22% of trips) x (81% car share) x 4 miles = 0.22 x 0.81 x 4 = 0.7128\n\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   VMT = (14% of trips) x (85% car share) x 7.5 miles = 0.14 x 0.85 x 7.5 = 0.8925\n\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   VMT = (16% of trips) x (89% car share) x 20 miles = 0.16 x 0.89 x 20 = 2.8480\n\n*   **Total Baseline VMT (weighted):**\n    *   0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n### 3. Calculate Proposed Car VMT (Table 2)\nWe repeat the same calculation using the data from the Proposed scenario.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   VMT = (48% of trips) x (3% car share) x 1 mile = 0.48 x 0.03 x 1 = 0.0144\n\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   VMT = (22% of trips) x (27% car share) x 4 miles = 0.22 x 0.27 x 4 = 0.2376\n\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   VMT = (14% of trips) x (41% car share) x 7.5 miles = 0.14 x 0.41 x 7.5 = 0.4305\n\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   VMT = (16% of trips) x (49% car share) x 20 miles = 0.16 x 0.49 x 20 = 1.5680\n\n*   **Total Proposed VMT (weighted):**\n    *   0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n### 4. Calculate the Percentage Reduction\nFinally, we calculate the percentage reduction using the total weighted VMT for both scenarios.\n\n*   **VMT Reduction** = Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT) x 100\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (2.4572 / 4.7077) x 100 â‰ˆ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
