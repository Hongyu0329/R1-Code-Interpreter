    "This piece of music is the title theme from the game *Touhou Hisoutensoku*. The track is officially titled \"Hisoutensoku\" or \"ぼくらの非想天則\" (Bokura no Hisoutensoku).\n\nThe sheet music provided is a piano arrangement of this theme. The piece is known for its distinct opening, which starts with a simple C major scale before erupting into a series of fast, energetic arpeggios, exactly as depicted in the score. It was composed by U2 Akiyama (あきやまうに) of the group Twilight Frontier.\n\n<<<Hisoutensoku>>>"
