    "The flag snippet shown, featuring horizontal stripes of black, white, and red from top to bottom, does not correspond to the current flag of any UN-recognized country.\n\nHowever, a common feature in this type of puzzle is to invert the flag. If the image is viewed upside down, the color order becomes red, white, and black. This is the national flag of Yemen.\n\nSeveral other Arab nations use a similar red, white, and black tricolor, but with additional symbols. For instance, Egypt's flag includes a golden eagle in the center, and Syria's flag has two green stars. The flag of Yemen is a plain tricolor, which matches the simple, unadorned stripes in the image.\n\nTherefore, the country represented by the inverted image is Yemen.\n\n<<<Yemen>>>"
