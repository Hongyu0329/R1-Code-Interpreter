    "Based on the letter forms in the Byzantine Greek manuscript, the word is **μᾶλλον** (mâllon).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the transcription:\n*   **μ (mu)**: The first letter is a standard minuscule mu.\n*   **α (alpha) with circumflex (◌̃)**: The second letter is an alpha with a circumflex accent. The circumflex is typical for this word.\n*   **λλ (double lambda)**: The middle part of the word, which appears as a single complex shape, represents a double lambda. In the cursive minuscule script of Byzantine manuscripts, ligatures (where two or more letters are joined) were common to increase writing speed. The shape in the image is a ligature for two lambdas.\n*   **ο (omicron)**: This is the standard rounded form of the letter.\n*   **ν (nu)**: The final letter is a minuscule nu.\n\nThis word, **μᾶλλον** (mâllon), is the comparative form of the adverb *μάλα* (mála), which means \"very.\" Therefore, μᾶλλον translates to \"more,\" \"rather,\" or \"to a greater degree.\" It is a very common word throughout all periods of the Greek language, from Ancient to Modern Greek. The use of minuscule script, with its rounded, connected letters and ligatures, became the standard book hand in Byzantine manuscripts from the 9th and 10th centuries onwards.\n\n<<<μᾶλλον>>>"
