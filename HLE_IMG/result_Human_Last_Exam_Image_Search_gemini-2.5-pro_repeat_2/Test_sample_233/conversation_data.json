    "The runestone depicted in the image fragment is the Gripsholm Runestone, which has the identifier **Sö 179**.\n\nThis identification is based on the visible runic inscriptions and the fact that it is designated as an Ingvar runestone. The runes visible in the fragment, `...ᛋᛏᛅᛁᚾ...` (stain) and `...ᚦᛁᚾᛅ...` (þinsa), which translate to \"stone\" and \"this\", are part of the full inscription on Sö 179. The complete inscription memorializes Haraldr, the brother of Ingvar, who died during Ingvar the Far-Travelled's expedition to Serkland (the Saracen lands).\n\nThe Gripsholm Runestone is one of about 26 Ingvar runestones, which were raised to commemorate those who died on this Viking expedition that took place between 1036 and 1041. It is considered one of the most famous of the Ingvar runestones and is located at Gripsholm Castle in Mariefred, Södermanland, Sweden. The stone was discovered in the early 1820s being used as a threshold in the castle's cellar.\n\nThe full inscription on the stone reads: \"Tóla had this stone raised in memory of her son Haraldr, Ingvarr's brother. They travelled valiantly far for gold, and in the east gave (food) to the eagle. (They) died in the south in Serkland.\"\n\n<<<Sö 179>>>"
