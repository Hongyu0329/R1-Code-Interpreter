    "This icon is a fresco depicting Saint Simeon Stylites.\n\nThe image is a well-known 13th-century fresco from the Sopoćani monastery in Serbia. This monastery, built from 1259 to 1270, is a UNESCO World Heritage site celebrated for its exceptional Byzantine and Serbian medieval art. The frescoes date to around 1270-1276 and are considered a peak of European painting of that era.\n\nSaint Simeon the Stylite (c. 390–459 AD) was a Syrian Christian ascetic famous for living for 36 years on a small platform on top of a pillar (in Greek, *stylos*). He is a venerated saint in the Orthodox, Catholic, and Oriental Orthodox Churches. Icons often depict him as an elderly monk with a long beard, sometimes on his pillar and other times, as seen here, holding a scroll with a spiritual message.\n\nThe other saints listed as options have different common iconographic representations. For instance, while also an elderly monk, St. Seraphim of Sarov lived much later (18th-19th century) and is depicted in a different artistic style. Moses the Prophet is typically shown holding the Tablets of the Law, not a scroll. The specific artistic style, historical location, and widespread identification of this particular artwork confirm the subject is Saint Simeon Stylites.\n\n<<<F>>>"
