    "The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that allows for distinction at a glance is the seta, which is the stalk that supports the capsule.\n\nIn *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight. Conversely, *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by an arcuate, or curved, seta. This gives the capsule of *G. curviseta* a bent or arched appearance relative to the stem, a feature that is readily observable.\n\n<<<The main difference is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a curved (arcuate) seta.>>>"
