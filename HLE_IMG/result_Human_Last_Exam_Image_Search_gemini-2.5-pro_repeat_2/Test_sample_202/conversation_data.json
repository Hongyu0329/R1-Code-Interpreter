    "H. **Scoria:** This rock is reddish-brown and highly vesicular, meaning it is full of gas bubbles, which gives it a frothy appearance. Scoria is a type of volcanic rock that forms when gas-rich lava is ejected from a volcano. Its color is due to the presence of iron.\n\nI. **Volcanic Breccia:** This rock is composed of angular fragments of other rocks that have been cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This texture indicates that the rock fragments were not transported far from their source before being lithified. The presence of various rock types within the sample makes it a polymict breccia.\n\nJ. **Pumice:** This is a light-colored, vesicular, and porous volcanic rock. It forms from the rapid cooling of frothy, gas-rich lava. Its light color suggests a felsic composition, rich in silica. Due to its high porosity, some pumice can even float on water.\n\nK. **Pegmatite:** This rock is characterized by its very large, interlocking crystals. Pegmatites are intrusive igneous rocks, meaning they cooled slowly beneath the Earth's surface, which allowed for the growth of large crystals. The specimen shows a mix of light-colored minerals, likely feldspar and quartz, and darker minerals.\n\n<<<H. Scoria\nI. Volcanic Breccia\nJ. Pumice\nK. Pegmatite>>>"
