    "The reaction shown is an acid-catalyzed dehydration of a triterpenoid alcohol, which proceeds through a series of carbocation rearrangements known as Wagner-Meerwein or \"backbone\" rearrangements. The starting material, friedelan-3Î²-ol, undergoes a cascade of methyl and hydride shifts to form a more stable final product.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the mechanism to determine the final positions of the substituents:\n\n1.  **Carbocation Formation:** The hydroxyl (-OH) group is protonated by the catalytic HCl and leaves as a water molecule. This generates a secondary carbocation at the C-3 position.\n2.  ** Methyl Shift:** To form a more stable tertiary carbocation, a methyl group from the adjacent C-4 shifts to C-3. This leaves a positive charge at C-4.\n3.  ** Hydride Shift:** The hydrogen atom at C-5 shifts to the C-4 carbocation, moving the positive charge to C-5.\n4.  ** Methyl Shift:** The methyl group from C-10 shifts to the C-5 carbocation. The positive charge is now at C-10.\n5.  ** Hydride Shift:** The hydrogen at C-9 shifts to the C-10 carbocation, transferring the positive charge to C-9.\n6.  ** Methyl Shift:** The methyl group from C-8 shifts to the C-9 carbocation, leaving C-8 with the positive charge.\n7.  ** Methyl Shift:** The methyl group from C-14 shifts to the C-8 carbocation. The positive charge is now at C-14.\n8.  ** Methyl Shift:** The methyl group from C-13 shifts to the C-14 carbocation, moving the positive charge to C-13.\n9.  **Elimination:** Finally, a proton is removed from C-18, which is adjacent to the C-13 carbocation. This forms a stable, tetrasubstituted double bond between C-13 and C-18, yielding the final product, olean-13(18)-ene.\n\nBased on this cascade of rearrangements, the identity of the substituents at the numbered positions are as follows:\n\n*   **1:** The original methyl group at C-4 that did not migrate.\n*   **2:** The original methyl group from C-10 that migrated to C-5.\n*   **3:** The original hydrogen atom from C-9 that migrated to C-10.\n*   **4:** The original methyl group from C-8 that migrated to C-9.\n*   **5:** The original methyl group from C-14 that migrated to C-8.\n\nTherefore, the substituents are:\n\n1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = CH3\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = CH3>>>"
