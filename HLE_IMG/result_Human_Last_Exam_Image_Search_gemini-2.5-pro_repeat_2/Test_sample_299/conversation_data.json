    "Based on the provided image, here is the solution for the mate in 2 moves:\n\nThe initial move for White is a sacrifice with the rook to put the black king in check:\n**1. Rh5-e5+**\n\nThis move forces Black's response. The Black king on e4 is in check and cannot move to any adjacent squares as they are all under attack:\n*   d3 and f3 are controlled by the Rook on f3.\n*   d4 is controlled by the Queen on a4.\n*   f5 is controlled by the Knight on e7.\n\nBlack's only legal move is to capture the attacking rook with the pawn:\n**1. ...fxe5**\n\nNow, White delivers the final checkmate with the knight:\n**2. Nb7-d6#**\n\nThis is checkmate because:\n*   The Black king on e4 is in check from the Knight on d6.\n*   The king has no escape squares:\n    *   d3 and e3 are controlled by the Rook on f3.\n    *   d4 is controlled by the Queen on a4.\n    *   d5 is occupied by the Black Queen.\n    *   f5 is controlled by the checking Knight on d6.\n*   The checking knight cannot be captured, and the check cannot be blocked.\n\n<<<1. Rhe5+ fxe5 2. Nbd6#>>>"
