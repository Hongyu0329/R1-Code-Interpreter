    "I am sorry, but the image provided is completely black. Therefore, I cannot see the molecules you are referring to. To determine the relationship between the molecules (whether they are conformers, constitutional isomers, identical, or stereoisomers), I need to be able to see their chemical structures.\n\nPlease provide the image of the molecules, and I will be happy to help you answer the question."
