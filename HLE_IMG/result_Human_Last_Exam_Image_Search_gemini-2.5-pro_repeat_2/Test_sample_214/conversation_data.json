    "The poetic form used in this sequence is a \"slim page\" poem, a term coined by the author M.A.C. Farrant for the works in her collection *The Other Clouds*.\n\nThis form has the following characteristics:\n*   **Structure:** Each poem is a four-line stanza, also known as a quatrain.\n*   **Composition:** It is a work of erasure poetry, with the text sourced from Arthur Conan Doyle's 1913 novella, *The Poison Belt*.\n*   **Form:** It is a type of syllabic verse, where the number of syllables in each line is a key organizing principle.\n\nBased on an analysis of the provided image and the information in the prompt, the specific four-line stanza is as follows:\n\n> , a vortex (3 syllables)\n> form like a dance (4 syllables)\n> ghostly velum (4 syllables)\n> nacreous wavers (4 syllables)\n\nThis reveals a 3-4-4-4 syllabic pattern for this particular stanza. The entire collection in *The Other Clouds* follows this model of short, syllabic quatrains presented as erasure/collage art. In an interview, Farrant described her goal as seeking a \"purity of expression, one that is concise and restrained, yet reveals essence\".\n\n<<<A \"slim page\" quatrain>>>"
