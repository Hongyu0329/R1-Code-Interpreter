    "The artist of the painting is Dominique Appia.\n\nThe title of the artwork is \"Entre les trous de la mémoire,\" which translates to \"Between the Holes of Memory.\" This surrealist painting is one of the most famous works by the Swiss artist.\n\nDominique Appia (1926-2017) was a painter from Geneva, Switzerland, known for his dreamlike compositions that often feature elements of his native city. His work juxtaposes familiar objects and environments in fantastical scenarios, blurring the lines between reality and imagination. \"Entre les trous de la mémoire\" is a prime example of his style, inviting viewers into a room where different worlds and realities converge.\n\n<<<Dominique Appia>>>"
