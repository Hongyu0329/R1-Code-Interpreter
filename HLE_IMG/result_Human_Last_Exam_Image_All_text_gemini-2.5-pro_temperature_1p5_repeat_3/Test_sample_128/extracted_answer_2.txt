The final answer is a chemical structure. Here is a representation of the final answer: A benzene ring is fused to a five-membered ring containing nitrogen. This forms an isoindole core. The nitrogen atom of the isoindole ring is attached to a pyridin-2-yl group. The carbon atom at position 1 of the isoindole ring (adjacent to the nitrogen) is attached to a cyano group (-CN). The molecule is aromatic. The chemical name is 1-cyano-2-(pyridin-2-yl)-2H-isoindole.
