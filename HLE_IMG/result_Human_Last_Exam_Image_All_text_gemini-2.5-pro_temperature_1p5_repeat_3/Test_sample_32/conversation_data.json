    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The question asks for the most prominent visual difference in the sporophyte (the spore-producing structure) between two specific moss species, *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. The key is a difference that allows for identification \"at a glance.\"\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of a Moss Sporophyte:** A typical moss sporophyte consists of three main parts:\n    *   **Foot:** Anchors the sporophyte to the gametophyte (the leafy green part).\n    *   **Seta:** The stalk that elevates the capsule.\n    *   **Capsule:** The structure at the top of the seta that produces and releases spores.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Name *Grimmia curviseta*:** The specific epithet \"*curviseta*\" provides a significant clue. In Latin, \"curvus\" means curved, and \"seta\" refers to the stalk of the sporophyte. The name itself translates to \"curved stalk Grimmia,\" suggesting that a curved seta is a key characteristic of this species.\n\n4.  **Research the Sporophyte of *Grimmia montana*:** Botanical descriptions and floras indicate that *Grimmia montana* has a very short and **straight** seta. This means the capsule is held upright (erect) and is typically immersed among the upper leaves of the plant (perichaetial leaves). The capsules in the provided image are erect and appear immersed, consistent with the description of *G. montana*.\n\n5.  **Research the Sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta*:** As its name implies, *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by having a distinctly **curved or arcuate** seta. This curvature causes the capsule to be bent over, appearing to nod or hang downwards, rather than standing erect.\n\n6.  **Compare and Conclude:** The main and most easily observable difference between the sporophytes of these two species is the shape of the seta and the resulting orientation of the capsule.\n    *   In **Grimmia montana**, the seta is **straight**, leading to an **erect capsule**.\n    *   In **Grimmia curviseta**, the seta is **curved**, leading to a **bent or nodding capsule**.\n\nThis difference in the seta's curvature is a definitive feature that can be used to distinguish the two species easily when they are fertile and bearing sporophytes.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Presence of Sporophytes:** This distinction can only be made when the mosses have produced sporophytes. Without them, identification relies on gametophyte characteristics, which can be more subtle.\n*   **Maturity of Sporophyte:** The curvature of the seta in *G. curviseta* is most apparent when the sporophyte is mature.\n*   **Environmental Factors:** While a primary genetic trait, the exact degree of curvature might show some variation, but the fundamental difference (straight vs. curved) remains.\n*   **Taxonomic Note:** Some taxonomic systems may treat *Grimmia curviseta* as a variety or synonym of another species, but its name and the associated feature are well-established for identification purposes.\n\nThe final answer hinges on this clear morphological difference in the stalk that supports the spore capsule.\n\n<<<The main difference is the shape of the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight, causing the capsule to be erect. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is distinctly curved (arcuate), causing the capsule to be bent over or nodding."
