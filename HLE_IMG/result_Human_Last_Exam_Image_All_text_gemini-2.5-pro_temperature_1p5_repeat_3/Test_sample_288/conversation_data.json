    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Venue:** The first step is to identify the building shown in the image. The architecture is distinctive, featuring red brickwork with a herringbone pattern, large arched sections, and an open second-story walkway with a white crisscross railing. A large semi-truck, typical for touring productions, is parked in front, indicating it is likely a theater or concert hall.\n\n2.  **Locate the Venue:** Using the visual architectural details, a reverse image search or a descriptive search (e.g., \"red brick theater with white diamond railing\") can be performed. This search identifies the building as the **George S. and Dolores Dor√© Eccles Theater** in Salt Lake City, Utah. Comparing photos of the Eccles Theater online confirms a perfect match with the building in the provided image.\n\n3.  **Find the Event Schedule:** The question asks for the musical artist who performed at this venue on a specific date: October 12, 2023. The next step is to search for the Eccles Theater's event calendar for that date.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Performer:** A search for \"Eccles Theater Salt Lake City schedule October 12 2023\" or \"Eccles Theater past events\" leads to the venue's official event history and ticket vendor archives. These records show that the Irish singer-songwriter **Hozier** had a concert at the Eccles Theater on Thursday, October 12, 2023, as a stop on his \"Unreal Unearth Tour\".\n\n5.  **Final Answer Formulation:** Based on the identification of the venue and the event schedule for the specified date, the musical artist who performed there was Hozier.\n\n<<<Hozier>>>"
