    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm:**\n    Let's analyze the provided pseudocode for the function `sort(a, n)`.\n    ```python\n    def sort(a, n):\n      if n > 1:\n        # 1. Recursively sort the first n-1 elements\n        sort(a, n - 1)\n        \n        # 2. Compare the last element with the second-to-last\n        if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n          # 3. If they are out of order, swap them\n          swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])\n          # 4. Recursively sort the first n-1 elements AGAIN\n          sort(a, n - 1)\n    ```\n    - The function is recursive. The base case is when `n <= 1`, where the function does nothing and returns.\n    - For `n > 1`, it first calls `sort(a, n-1)`. Let's assume this call correctly sorts the subarray `a[0...n-2]`. After this call, `a[n-2]` is the largest element in that subarray.\n    - Then, it compares the last unsorted element, `a[n-1]`, with the largest element of the sorted part, `a[n-2]`.\n    - If `a[n-1]` is smaller, it means the new element needs to be placed within the sorted part. The algorithm swaps `a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]`.\n    - After the swap, the previous `a[n-1]` is now at position `n-2`, but the subarray `a[0...n-2]` might no longer be sorted. Therefore, the algorithm makes a *second* recursive call to `sort(a, n-1)` to re-sort the entire prefix. This re-sorting step is what makes the algorithm highly inefficient.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation:**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time complexity of the function `sort(a, n)`. We are interested in the worst-case scenario.\n    - The `if n > 1:` check takes constant time.\n    - The first recursive call is `sort(a, n - 1)`, which takes `T(n-1)` time.\n    - The comparison `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` and the `swap` operation take constant time, let's denote it as `c`.\n    - The second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` also takes `T(n-1)` time.\n\n    The worst case occurs when the `if` condition `a[n-1] < a[n-2]` is always true, because this triggers the second, expensive recursive call. An example of a worst-case input is a reverse-sorted array (e.g., `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`). In this case, at each step of the recursion, the element being considered will be smaller than the largest element of the already-sorted prefix, triggering the swap and the second recursive call.\n\n    So, the worst-case recurrence relation is:\n    `T(n) = T(n-1) + c + T(n-1)`\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n\n    The base case is `T(1) = d`, where `d` is some constant, because when `n=1`, the function returns immediately.\n\n3.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:**\n    We need to solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`. We can do this by expansion (also known as the iteration or substitution method).\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n    `     = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 2^2 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n    `     = 2^2 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 2c + c = 2^3 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    `     = 2^3 * T(n-3) + c * (2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n\n    We can see a pattern emerging. After `k` expansions:\n    `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) + ... + 2^0)`\n\n    We continue expanding until we reach the base case `T(1)`. This happens when `n-k = 1`, which means `k = n-1`.\n    Substituting `k = n-1` into the equation:\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-2) + 2^(n-3) + ... + 2^0)`\n\n    The sum is a geometric series `sum_{i=0}^{n-2} 2^i = (2^(n-1) - 1) / (2-1) = 2^(n-1) - 1`.\n    Substituting the base case `T(1) = d` and the sum of the series:\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * d + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n    `T(n) = d*2^(n-1) + c*2^(n-1) - c`\n    `T(n) = (d+c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\n4.  **Determine the Big-O Complexity:**\n    The dominant term in the expression for `T(n)` is `(d+c) * 2^(n-1)`. As `n` grows large, this term grows exponentially.\n    Therefore, the time complexity is `O(2^(n-1))`, which is equivalent to `O(2^n)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n- **Base Case:** The recursion correctly terminates because the problem size `n` decreases by 1 in each recursive call, eventually reaching the base case `n <= 1`. The algorithm does not run forever.\n- **Worst Case:** It's crucial to analyze the worst-case performance. The worst case happens when the second recursive call is always made. This occurs when the array is sorted in reverse order, as the condition `a[n-1] < a[n-2]` will consistently be true after the first `sort(a, n-1)` call returns.\n- **Algorithm Family:** This algorithm is an example of an extremely inefficient sorting algorithm, sometimes called \"Stupid Sort\". It correctly sorts the array, but its performance is very poor due to the redundant re-sorting of the prefix. It is much worse than `O(n^2)` algorithms like Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort.\n- **Recurrence Solving:** The recurrence `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c` is a classic example that leads to an exponential solution. Confusing this with recurrences like `T(n) = T(n-1) + O(n)` (which leads to `O(n^2)`) or `T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)` (which leads to `O(n log n)`) is a common mistake.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe recurrence relation for the worst-case time complexity is `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + O(1)`, which solves to `O(2^n)`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
