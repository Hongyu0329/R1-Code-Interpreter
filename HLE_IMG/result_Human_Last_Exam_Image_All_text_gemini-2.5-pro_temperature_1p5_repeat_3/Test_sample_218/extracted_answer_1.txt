The final product, compound A, is the hydrocarbon formed by replacing the hydroxyl group (-OH) of geraniol with a hydrogen atom (-H), without any rearrangement of the carbon skeleton or the double bonds. This corresponds to a deoxygenation reaction.

The structure of geraniol is:
(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH₂-C(CH₃)=CH-CH₂OH

Replacing the -CH₂OH group with a -CH₃ group gives the structure of compound A:
(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH₂-C(CH₃)=CH-CH₃

This compound is named (2E)-3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

The chemical structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH2-C=CH-CH3
                 (E-geometry)
```
This molecule has two trisubstituted double bonds. One between carbons 2 and 3 (with E configuration, inherited from geraniol) and another between carbons 6 and 7. There are methyl groups at positions 3 and 7.
Final structure representation:
```
          CH3

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH2-C=CH-CH3
                 //
                H
```
Which is the (E)-isomer.
The structure can be drawn as:
(CH3)2C=CHCH2CH2C(CH3)=CHCH3
It is an acyclic C10H18 hydrocarbon.
