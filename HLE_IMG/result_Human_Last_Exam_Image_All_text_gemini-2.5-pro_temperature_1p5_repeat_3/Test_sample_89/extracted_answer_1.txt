**Product A:**
A pyrrolidine ring is attached at its nitrogen atom to the C2 carbon of a 1-pyrroline ring (a five-membered ring with a C=N double bond). At the C2 position of the pyrrolidine ring, there is an acetamido group (-NHCOCH₃). The IUPAC name is N-(1-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidin-2-yl)acetamide.

**Product B:**
A bicyclic compound consisting of two five-membered rings fused along a C-N bond (a pyrrolizidine skeleton). One of the rings is a lactam, with a carbonyl group at the C3 position. The IUPAC name is hexahydropyrrolizin-3-one.

**Product C:**
A five-membered ring containing two carbonyl groups adjacent to a nitrogen atom (a succinimide ring). The nitrogen atom is substituted with an acetyl group (-COCH₃). The IUPAC name is N-acetyl-2,5-pyrrolidinedione or N-acetylsuccinimide.
