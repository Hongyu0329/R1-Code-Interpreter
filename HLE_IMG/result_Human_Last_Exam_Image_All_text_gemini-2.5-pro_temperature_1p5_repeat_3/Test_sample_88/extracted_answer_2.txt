  "Product A": {
    "molecular_formula": "C14H20N2O3",
    "description": "Product A is the result of a side reaction. The starting material first undergoes thermal decarboxylation to form an amine, which tautomerizes to an azomethine ylide. This ylide then participates in a [3+2] cycloaddition with methyl propiolate. The resulting cycloadduct is then N-acetylated by the acetic anhydride solvent to yield Product A.",
    "structure": "A complex polycyclic molecule featuring a pyrrolizidine core fused with the original 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrole ring. A methyl ester group is present on the newly formed ring, and an acetyl group is attached to one of the nitrogen atoms."
  },
  "Product B": {
    "molecular_formula": "C12H14N2O3",
    "description": "Product B is the major product from the primary reaction pathway. First, a mesoionic azomethine ylide is generated from the starting material via cyclodehydration mediated by acetic anhydride. This dipole undergoes a [3+2] cycloaddition with methyl propiolate to form a primary tricyclic adduct containing a methyl ester. This adduct is then hydrolyzed by water (generated in situ during dipole formation) to the corresponding carboxylic acid (Product B), eliminating methanol.",
    "structure": "A tricyclic fused ring system formed from the cycloaddition. It contains the original fused ring system of the starting material's ylide precursor now fused to a new five-membered ring derived from methyl propiolate. This product features a carboxylic acid group instead of a methyl ester."
  },
  "Product C": {
    "molecular_formula": "C11H16N2O3",
    "description": "Product C is a reaction intermediate that is stable enough to be isolated. It is the mixed anhydride formed when the carboxylic acid group of the starting material, (3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)proline, reacts with the solvent, acetic anhydride.",
    "structure": "The structure is that of the starting material where the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid has been replaced by an acetoxy group (-O-CO-CH3), forming a mixed anhydride linkage."
