    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key Signature**\nThe first movement of the \"Pathétique\" sonata is in the key of C minor. The key signature at the beginning of the movement (and visible in the provided score) has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭), which corresponds to either C minor or its relative major, E♭ major. The overall tonality of this section confirms we are analyzing from the perspective of the home key, C minor.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Measure and its Notes**\nThe question asks for the analysis of measure 30. Looking at the score, measure 30 is the third measure on the second system.\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays octaves on the note G (G2 and G3). This establishes G as the bass note for the entire measure.\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The right hand plays a repeating 16th-note pattern. The notes are D, F♯, A, and C.\n\n**Step 3: Combine and Analyze the Pitches**\nThe complete set of notes present in measure 30 is G, D, F♯, A, and C.\n*   First, let's analyze the chord played by the right hand alone: D-F♯-A-C. When stacked in thirds starting from D, these notes form a D dominant seventh chord (D7).\n*   Now, let's consider the bass note, G. The right hand plays a D7 chord while the left hand plays a G octave. This means we have a D7 chord sounding over a G pedal point.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Harmonic Function**\nTo assign a Roman numeral, we need to understand the chord's function within the key of C minor.\n*   The tonic chord (i) is C minor.\n*   The dominant chord (V) is G major. The dominant is the fifth scale degree of the key.\n*   The chord in measure 30 is a D7 chord. A D7 chord is the dominant seventh chord of G (D is the fifth of G).\n*   Since the D7 chord is the dominant of the dominant (V of V), it is a **secondary dominant**. Its function is to temporarily tonicize the G major chord, making its arrival in the next measure (measure 31 contains a clear G7 chord, the V7 of C minor) sound more emphatic.\n*   The G in the bass is a pedal tone, which anticipates the arrival of the G chord (the V chord). The functional harmony, however, is determined by the D7 chord in the upper voices.\n\n**Step 5: Write the Roman Numeral**\n*   The Roman numeral for a secondary dominant is written as \"V of\" the chord it is dominating.\n*   The chord is a dominant seventh. This is indicated by adding a \"7\" to the Roman numeral.\n*   The chord being dominated is the dominant (V) of C minor.\n*   Therefore, the correct Roman numeral is **V⁷/V** (pronounced \"five-seven of five\").\n\n<<<V⁷/V>>>"
