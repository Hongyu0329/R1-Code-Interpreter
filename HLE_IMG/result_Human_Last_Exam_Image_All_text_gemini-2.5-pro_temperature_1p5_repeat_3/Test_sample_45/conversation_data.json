    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the rotational symmetry of the tiling in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Rotational Symmetry**\nRotational symmetry describes how many times a pattern looks identical during a full 360-degree rotation around a central point. If a pattern looks the same after being rotated by an angle of 360/n degrees, it is said to have n-fold rotational symmetry. The question asks for the highest order of rotational symmetry present in the tiling. For periodic tilings (wallpaper patterns), the crystallographic restriction theorem limits the possible rotational symmetries to 1-fold, 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold.\n\n**Step 2: Visually Analyze the Tiling's Structure**\nThe tiling is a repeating pattern composed of tiles of different shapes and colors: dark blue, light yellow, and orange. The overall structure is dominated by prominent star-like or pinwheel-like motifs, which we can call \"rosettes\". These rosettes are arranged in a regular, repeating grid.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Potential Centers of Rotation**\nWe need to find points in the tiling around which a rotation will leave the entire pattern unchanged. Let's examine the most likely candidates for symmetry centers.\n\n*   **Candidate A: The Center of a Rosette**\n    *   Each rosette is formed around a central, light-yellow square. This square is surrounded by a ring of other tiles (which appear to be pentagons of two different colors, orange and yellow).\n    *   Let's pick the center of one of these central squares as our rotation point.\n    *   If we rotate the pattern by 90 degrees (which is 360/4), the central square rotates onto itself.\n    *   The surrounding tiles in the rosette also map onto identical tiles. For instance, the orange pentagon at the top of the rosette moves to the position of the orange pentagon on the right.\n    *   Furthermore, the entire grid of rosettes maps onto itself. The rosette to the right of our center point moves to the position of the rosette that was below it, and so on.\n    *   Since a 90-degree rotation leaves the entire pattern unchanged, the center of each rosette is a point of **4-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n*   **Candidate B: The Center of a Dark Blue Tile**\n    *   The dark blue tiles are hexagons (they have six sides). They are located in the spaces between the rosettes.\n    *   Each blue hexagon is surrounded by six pentagons, alternating between yellow and orange. At first glance, this might suggest 3-fold or 6-fold symmetry.\n    *   However, a periodic tiling cannot have both 4-fold and 3-fold (or 6-fold) centers of rotation. Since we have definitively identified 4-fold centers, the blue hexagons cannot be centers of 3-fold or 6-fold symmetry. This apparent local symmetry is an illusion; the shapes or their arrangement must be slightly irregular to conform to the overall 4-fold symmetric structure. Checking for 2-fold (180-degree) rotation reveals it would require swapping yellow and orange tiles, which breaks the symmetry. Thus, these points only have 1-fold symmetry.\n\n*   **Candidate C: Vertices where Multiple Tiles Meet**\n    *   Let's examine the points where the corners of the rosettes meet. At these points, four pentagonal tiles meet (two yellow and two orange).\n    *   If we rotate the pattern by 180 degrees (360/2) around this vertex, the yellow pentagon from the top-left maps onto the yellow pentagon at the bottom-right. The orange pentagon from the top-right maps onto the orange pentagon at the bottom-left.\n    *   This rotation leaves the pattern unchanged, so these vertices are points of **2-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Highest Order of Symmetry**\nWe have found points of 1-fold, 2-fold, and 4-fold rotational symmetry within the tiling. The question asks for \"the rotational symmetry\" of the tiling, which by convention refers to the highest order of symmetry present.\n\nThe highest order we have found is 4.\n\n**Final Answer:** The tiling has 4-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n<<<4>>>"
