**Product A:**
A complex structure arising from Michael addition and subsequent cyclization and acetylation. A likely structure based on literature precedents (with formula C14H16N2O3, suggesting a typo in the problem's H count) is a tetracyclic system: (2S,3aS,8aS)-2-acetyl-3a-(methoxycarbonyl)-2,3,3a,8a-tetrahydro-1H-pyrrolo[1',2':1,5]pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine.
Given the ambiguity, a simplified representation would show an adduct of the starting material, methyl propiolate, and an acetyl group.

[Structure A is a complex polycyclic adduct, whose specific structure is difficult to determine unambiguously from the provided information but results from a Michael addition pathway.]
```
For example, one possible structure for A (C14H20N2O3) could be the Michael adduct of SM and methyl propiolate, which is then acetylated and reduced. This is highly speculative. The most definite structures are for B and C.

**Product B:**
The structure is a fused pyrrolizine. To match the formula C12H14N2O3, it is proposed as an N-oxide derivative of the primary cycloaddition product.
The core structure is methyl (S)-5-(4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolizine-1-carboxylate. The image below shows this structure with an added N-oxide on the pyrroline ring nitrogen to satisfy the molecular formula.

**Product C:**
This is the mixed anhydride intermediate.
The structure is (S)-1-(4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acetic anhydride.
