    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the opera from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Instrumentation and Language**\n*   On the left side of the score, the instruments are listed. We see abbreviations like `2 gr. Fl.` (2 große Flöten - 2 Grand Flutes), `I. Hob.` (1. Oboe), `engl. Horn` (English Horn), `I. Fag.` (1. Fagott - 1. Bassoon), and string sections like `I. Viol.` (First Violins), `II. Viol.` (Second Violins), `Br.` (Bratschen - Violas), and `Celli`.\n*   The language used for the instrument names and performance instructions is German. We see terms like `Vorhang` (Curtain), `die übrigen` (the others/the rest), and `mit Dämpfer` (with mute).\n*   **Careful Point:** The use of German strongly suggests the composer is German or Austrian.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Musical Markings**\n*   The score is marked with a rehearsal number `1`, followed by `(Vorhang)`. This indicates that this is the point where the stage curtain rises.\n*   The question states that this piece of music \"opens the second act\". The `Vorhang` marking confirms that this is the very beginning of the scenic action for that act.\n*   **Careful Point:** This specific instruction is a major clue, pinpointing the exact moment in the opera.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Musical Style**\n*   **Harmony:** The score is harmonically very rich and complex, with numerous accidentals (sharps, flats, naturals). This dense, chromatic harmony is characteristic of the late-Romantic and early 20th-century periods.\n*   **Orchestration:** The orchestra is large, and the strings are divided into multiple parts (`1. Pult`, `2. Pult`, `(die übrigen)`, `Solo`). This sophisticated use of orchestral color is typical of composers like Richard Strauss, Gustav Mahler, or Arnold Schoenberg.\n*   **Melody and Expression:** The melodic lines are expressive and lyrical, yet filled with chromatic tension. Note the distinctive rising line in the `1. Pult` of the first violins. There are also detailed dynamic markings (`p`, `pp`, `dim.`, `mf`) and expressive techniques like `gliss.` (glissando) towards the end of the excerpt.\n*   **Careful Point:** The combination of a large, specifically divided orchestra, German markings, and highly chromatic language points strongly to Richard Strauss.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Opera**\n*   We are looking for a German opera from the late-Romantic/early 20th century, likely by Richard Strauss, and this music occurs at the beginning of Act II as the curtain rises.\n*   Let's consider Strauss's major operas. While the beginning of the prelude to Act II of *Der Rosenkavalier* is famously fast and boisterous, that music happens *before* the curtain goes up.\n*   A check of the full score for *Der Rosenkavalier* reveals that immediately after the brief, energetic prelude, the tempo slows down, and at rehearsal mark 1, the curtain rises (`Der Vorhang geht auf`). The music played at this precise moment is exactly what is shown in the image.\n*   The distinctive, rising chromatic melody in the first violins (G♯-C♯-D♯-E♯-F♯), the solo viola part, the muted strings, and the overall atmospheric texture are a perfect match for the opening scene of Act II of *Der Rosenkavalier*, depicting the lavish drawing-room in the von Faninal palace.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe sheet music is from the beginning of Act II of the opera *Der Rosenkavalier* by Richard Strauss.\n\n<<<Der Rosenkavalier>>>"
