    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements in the image.**\nThe image presents two graphs, both seemingly plotted against time on the horizontal axis.\n*   **Top graph (Spectrogram):** This graph represents the frequency content of a sound over time. We see a strong, narrow horizontal band, which signifies a pure tone of a constant frequency. In the middle of the graph, this band is interrupted and replaced by a vertical smear, which represents a burst of sound containing a wide range of frequencies (i.e., noise). Physically, the tone stops, is replaced by noise, and then the tone (or something similar) resumes.\n*   **Bottom graph (Waveform):** This shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time. It starts as a clean, regular sine wave, corresponding to the pure tone. In the middle, the waveform becomes irregular and complex, corresponding to the noise burst. After the burst, the waveform continues, though it appears somewhat more complex than the initial pure sine wave.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the question's clues.**\nThe question asks for the name of an illusion and provides several key clues:\n*   **\"...an illusion...\"**: This tells us that what is perceived is different from the physical reality depicted in the graphs. The graphs show the tone is physically absent during the noise burst. The illusion is that a listener perceives the tone as continuing *through* the noise.\n*   **\"...similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity...\"**: The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where the brain actively interprets a 2D drawing to construct a 3D perception. It's \"bistable\" because there are two equally likely interpretations. The similarity here is not in the bistability, but in the brain's active role in constructing a perception that goes beyond the raw sensory dataâ€”it \"fills in\" missing information to create a coherent whole.\n*   **\"...reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability.\"**: This points to a cognitive process that happens automatically in everyday life. A key example is our ability to understand speech in a noisy environment, where parts of words might be completely obscured by background sounds. Our brain seamlessly \"restores\" the missing sounds, so we don't even notice they were gone.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the analysis to identify the phenomenon.**\nThe image shows the setup for a classic auditory illusion where a sound (like a tone or a speech sound) is deleted and replaced by a loud noise. Listeners typically do not perceive the gap; instead, they experience \"auditory continuity,\" hearing the original sound as if it continued uninterrupted \"behind\" the noise.\n\nThis perceptual \"filling-in\" of missing auditory information is a well-documented phenomenon. While the broader term is the \"auditory continuity illusion,\" the most famous and widely-studied example, particularly concerning speech, is known as the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**. It was named by psychologist Richard Warren, who discovered that when a phoneme (a basic sound unit of speech) in a sentence was replaced by a cough or a buzz, listeners perceived the sentence as intact and often couldn't even identify which phoneme was missing.\n\nGiven the reference to a \"common, unconscious perceptual ability,\" which strongly relates to understanding speech in noise, the Phonemic Restoration Effect is the specific name for this powerful illusion.\n\n<<<Phonemic restoration effect>>>"
