    "This is a step-by-step analysis to identify the title and composer of the jazz standard from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observations:**\n    *   **Key Signature:** There are four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭) in the key signature.\n    *   **First Chord:** The first chord is labeled \"F-\", which stands for F minor. The combination of the key signature and the starting chord strongly indicates the key is F minor.\n    *   **Time Signature:** It is 4/4, also known as common time, which is standard for many jazz tunes.\n\n2.  **Harmonic Analysis (Chord Progression):** The chord progression is one of the most distinctive features for identifying a jazz standard.\n    *   **Bars 1-4:** The progression is `| F- | Eø7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7 |`. This descending chromatic bass line (F -> E -> Eb -> Db) with these specific chord qualities is very characteristic.\n        *   `F-` (F minor) is the tonic (i).\n        *   `Eø7b5` (E half-diminished 7 flat 5) creates a smooth voice-leading descent from F.\n        *   `Eb-6` (Eb minor 6) continues the descent.\n        *   `Dbmaj7` completes the chromatic line down to Db. The `G7` acts as a secondary dominant, leading to the `C7` in the next measure.\n\n3.  **Melodic Analysis:**\n    *   **Bar 1:** The melody is C - F - G - A♭. These are the 5th, root, 2nd, and minor 3rd of the F minor chord.\n    *   **Bar 2:** The melody is C - E♭ - F - G.\n    *   **Bar 3:** The melody is C - D♭ - B♮ - C.\n    *   This melodic contour, combined with the underlying chords, creates a very specific and recognizable musical phrase.\n\n4.  **Comparison with Known Jazz Standards:**\n    *   The combination of the melody and the unique descending chord progression in the first four bars is the primary fingerprint of the tune.\n    *   This specific harmonic and melodic opening is the signature A section of the jazz standard **\"On a Misty Night\"**.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Composer:**\n    *   \"On a Misty Night\" was composed by **Tadd Dameron**, an influential American jazz composer, arranger, and pianist of the bebop era.\n\n6.  **Careful Points and Verifying the Entire Piece:**\n    *   **Chord Notation:** The notation is typical of handwritten \"lead sheets\". \"F-\" means F minor, \"Eø7b5\" is E half-diminished (a common notation is Em7b5), and \"Eb-6\" is Eb minor 6.\n    *   **Structure:** While the first section (the \"A\" section) is unmistakably \"On a Misty Night\", the music from bar 9 onwards deviates from the standard \"B\" section (bridge) of the tune. Standard lead sheets for \"On a Misty Night\" have a different bridge. This sheet may be a simplified version, a specific arrangement, or a practice etude that uses the famous opening and then moves to other exercises or harmonic patterns.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Despite the non-standard latter half, the opening \"head\" or theme is the definitive part of a jazz standard used for its identification. The evidence in the first section is conclusive.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\nThe analysis of the key, melody, and especially the characteristic descending chord progression in the initial bars solidly identifies the piece. The title is \"On a Misty Night\" and its composer is Tadd Dameron.\n\n<<<Title: On a Misty Night, Composer: Tadd Dameron>>>"
