    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the image**\nThe image provided is a bright-line emission spectrum. This type of spectrum is created when the electrons of an atom in an excited state fall back to lower energy levels, emitting photons of specific energies (and thus specific wavelengths or colors). The resulting pattern of colored lines is unique to each element, acting as a \"fingerprint.\" The spectrum in the image shows distinct lines across the visible range, from violet/blue on the left to red on the right.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the key spectral lines**\nWe need to carefully observe the prominent lines and their approximate colors:\n*   **Violet/Blue Region:** There are several lines in this area. A strong, distinct blue line is clearly visible.\n*   **Green Region:** There is a very bright and prominent green line. This is a major feature of the spectrum.\n*   **Yellow-Orange Region:** There is another bright feature in the yellow part of the spectrum. In many high-resolution spectra of this element, this line is actually a doublet (two lines very close together).\n*   **Red Region:** There are several lines in the red part of the spectrum, though they appear less intense than the green and yellow lines.\n\n**Step 3: Compare with known spectra of common elements**\nLet's compare this observed pattern with the characteristic spectra of some common elements.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** The visible spectrum of hydrogen (the Balmer series) consists of four main lines: one red, one blue-green, one blue-violet, and one violet. The spectrum in the image is much more complex than this.\n*   **Helium (He):** Helium has a bright yellow line, but the overall pattern of its other lines (in the red, green, and blue) does not match the image.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** Neon is famous for its bright red-orange glow. Its spectrum is dominated by numerous lines in the red and orange parts, which is different from the image where green and blue lines are also very prominent.\n*   **Sodium (Na):** Sodium is characterized by a very intense yellow-orange doublet. While the image has a yellow line, it also has very strong lines in the green and blue, which are not characteristic of sodium's visible spectrum.\n*   **Mercury (Hg):** The emission spectrum of mercury vapor is well-known and widely used in fluorescent lighting. Its most prominent visible lines are:\n    *   A blue line at ~436 nm.\n    *   A very strong green line at ~546 nm.\n    *   A bright yellow doublet at ~577 nm and ~579 nm.\n    *   Several weaker lines in the violet and red regions.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nThe pattern observed in the image—specifically the combination of a strong blue line, a very strong green line, and a strong yellow line/doublet—is a classic signature of the element **Mercury (Hg)**. The visual representation perfectly matches the known emission spectrum for mercury.\n\n<<<Mercury>>>"
