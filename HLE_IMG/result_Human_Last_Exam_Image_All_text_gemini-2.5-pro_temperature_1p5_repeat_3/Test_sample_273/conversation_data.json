    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral centers.**\nA chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. By inspecting the molecule, we can identify three such centers. Let's label them from left to right as C_L (left, with the hydroxyl group), C_M (middle, with the ethyl group), and C_R (right, with the aminomethyl group).\n\n*   **C_L**: This carbon is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), a hydrogen atom (implied), and the rest of the molecule (specifically, C_M). These four groups are different, so it is a chiral center.\n*   **C_M**: This carbon is bonded to an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), a hydrogen atom (implied), and two different carbon groups (C_L and C_R). These four groups are different, making it a chiral center.\n*   **C_R**: This carbon is bonded to a methyl group (-CH3), an aminomethyl group (-CH2NH2), a hydrogen atom (implied), and the rest of the molecule (C_M). These four groups are different, so it is a chiral center.\n\n**Step 2: Assign priorities to the groups attached to each chiral center using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.**\n\n**For C_L (the leftmost center):**\n1.  **-OH**: Priority 1 (Oxygen, atomic number 8).\n2.  **-C_M**: This is a carbon atom attached to two other carbons (from C_L and C_R) and a hydrogen. Priority 2.\n3.  **-CH3**: A carbon atom attached to three hydrogens. Priority 3.\n4.  **-H**: Priority 4 (implied).\n\n**For C_M (the middle center):**\n1.  **-C_L**: This group is -CH(OH)CH3. The carbon is bonded to (O, C, H). Priority 1.\n2.  **-C_R**: This group is -CH(CH3)(CH2NH2). The carbon is bonded to (C, C, H). Priority 2.\n3.  **-CH2CH3** (Ethyl): The carbon is bonded to (C, H, H). Priority 3.\n4.  **-H**: Priority 4 (implied).\n\n**For C_R (the rightmost center):**\n1.  **-CH2NH2**: The carbon is bonded to a Nitrogen atom (N, H, H). Priority 1 (N has a higher atomic number than C).\n2.  **-C_M**: The carbon is bonded to (C, C, H). Priority 2.\n3.  **-CH3**: The carbon is bonded to (H, H, H). Priority 3.\n4.  **-H**: Priority 4 (implied).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the configuration (R or S) for each chiral center.**\n\n**Configuration of C_M:**\n*   The ethyl group (priority 3) is on a wedge (pointing forward).\n*   The implied hydrogen (priority 4) must therefore be on a dash (pointing away).\n*   With the lowest priority group (P4) pointing away, we trace the path from P1 -> P2 -> P3.\n*   The path from C_L (P1) to C_R (P2) to the ethyl group (P3) is counter-clockwise.\n*   Therefore, the configuration of **C_M is S**.\n\n**Configuration of C_R:**\n*   The -CH2NH2 group (P1) is on a wedge (forward).\n*   The -CH3 group (P3) is on a dash (away).\n*   The C_M group (P2) and the H (P4) are in the plane.\n*   Since the lowest priority group (P4) is in the plane, we can mentally rotate the molecule or use the swap rule. Let's use the swap rule: swap the positions of H (P4) and the dashed CH3 (P3).\n*   In the new (swapped) arrangement, H is now dashed (away). We trace the path P1 -> P2 -> P3. The group now in the P3 position is H, but we trace the path of the original priorities. P1(CH2NH2, wedge) -> P2(C_M, plane) -> P3(H, which is now in the plane).\n*   The path from P1 (forward) to P2 (in plane, to the left) to P3 (originally CH3, now H in the plane) is counter-clockwise.\n*   This means the swapped configuration is S. Since we performed one swap, the original configuration is the opposite.\n*   Therefore, the configuration of **C_R is R**.\n\n**Configuration of C_L:**\n*   The drawing for this center is unusual, with two dashed bonds (-OH and -CH3). In a standard tetrahedral representation, this implies the implied hydrogen (P4) must be on a wedge (pointing forward).\n*   P1 (-OH) is dashed. P3 (-CH3) is dashed. P2 (-C_M) is in the plane. P4 (-H) is wedged.\n*   With the lowest priority group (P4) pointing forward, we trace the path P1 -> P2 -> P3 and then reverse the result.\n*   The path from P1 (-OH, back) -> P2 (-C_M, plane) -> P3 (-CH3, back) is a clockwise turn.\n*   Since the path is clockwise and P4 is pointing forward, the configuration is S.\n*   Therefore, the configuration of **C_L is S**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the configurations and provide the final answer.**\nTo provide a systematic name, we must number the atoms according to IUPAC rules. The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (-OH) is a pentane chain (Et-C_M-C_L-Me). Numbering from the end closest to the -OH group gives:\nCH3(1)-C_L(2)-C_M(3)-CH2(from Et)(4)-CH3(from Et)(5).\nThis is a pentan-2-ol derivative. The chiral centers are at C2, C3, and on the substituent at C3.\n*   The center at C2 is C_L, which we determined to be **S**. So, **2S**.\n*   The center at C3 is C_M, which we determined to be **S**. So, **3S**.\n*   The chiral center in the substituent (-CH(CH3)(CH2NH2)) is C_R. We determined it to be **R**. Numbering the substituent itself, this center is at position 1'. So, **1'R**.\n\nThe complete absolute configuration is (2S, 3S, 1'R).\n\nThe configurations of the three chiral centers from left to right in the drawing are S, S, and R.\n\n<<< (2S, 3S, 1'R) >>>"
