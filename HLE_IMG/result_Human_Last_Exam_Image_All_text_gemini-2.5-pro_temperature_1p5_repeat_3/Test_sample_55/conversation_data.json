    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the accurate Roman numeral for the circled notes in measure 8.\n\n1.  **Identify the Musical Context:**\n    *   **Piece:** Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397.\n    *   **Key:** The home key is D minor. The key signature is one flat (B♭). The D minor scale uses C# as its leading tone (in the harmonic and melodic minor forms).\n    *   **Measure:** The analysis is for measure 8.\n\n2.  **Identify the Circled Chord's Notes:**\n    *   The circled chord occurs on the second beat of measure 8.\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The notes are C# and E.\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The notes are F# and A.\n    *   **Combined Notes:** The full sonority consists of the notes F#, A, C#, and E.\n\n3.  **Identify the Following Chord (The Chord of Resolution):**\n    *   The chord on the third beat of measure 8 contains the notes G, B♭, D, and F.\n    *   This is a G minor seventh chord (Gm7).\n    *   In the key of D minor, the G minor chord is the subdominant, or **iv**. So, this is a **iv7** chord.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Function of the Circled Chord:**\n    *   Musical harmony is often about where a chord is going. The circled chord resolves directly to the iv7 (Gm7) chord.\n    *   The bass note of the circled chord is **F#**. The root of the following chord is **G**. F# is the leading tone to G.\n    *   When a chord's main function is to lead to another chord, and its bass note is the leading tone of the target chord, it is called a **secondary leading-tone chord** (or an applied leading-tone chord).\n    *   Therefore, the function of this chord is \"leading-tone of the subdominant\".\n\n5.  **Construct the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   A chord built on the leading tone is designated by the Roman numeral **vii**.\n    *   Because it is a secondary (or applied) chord, we use a slash (\"/\") followed by the Roman numeral of the chord it resolves to. In this case, it resolves to **iv**.\n    *   So, the basic Roman numeral is **vii/iv**.\n\n6.  **Determine the Chord Quality and Inversion:**\n    *   The notes are F#, A, C#, E. Let's determine the chord's structure. If we take F# as the root, the intervals are:\n        *   F# to A: a minor third\n        *   F# to C#: a perfect fifth\n        *   F# to E: a minor seventh\n    *   A chord with a root, minor third, perfect fifth, and minor seventh is a **minor seventh chord**. So, the chord is F#m7.\n    *   The bass note is F#, which is the root of the chord. Therefore, the chord is in **root position**.\n    *   A root-position seventh chord is indicated by a superscript '7'.\n\n7.  **Final Roman Numeral:**\n    *   Combining these elements gives us **vii7/iv**.\n    *   While a leading-tone chord is typically diminished or half-diminished, Mozart used a minor seventh quality here to create exceptionally smooth voice-leading, where every note of the F#m7 chord moves up by a semitone to the notes of the Gm7 chord (F#→G, A→B♭, C#→D, E→F). The Roman numeral vii7/iv accurately captures the chord's function as a secondary leading-tone seventh chord resolving to the subdominant.\n\n<<<vii7/iv>>>"
