    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to determine the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Molecular Weight and Presence of Isotopes**\n1.  **Molecular Ion (M+):** The peak with the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) that is part of a plausible isotopic cluster is considered the molecular ion peak. Looking at the spectrum and the table, the highest significant cluster of peaks is at m/z 262, 264, and 266.\n    *   m/z 262: Intensity = 29.0%\n    *   m/z 264: Intensity = 12.9%\n    *   m/z 266: Intensity = 3.22%\n2.  **Isotope Pattern Analysis:** We analyze the ratio of these peaks to identify elements with characteristic isotopes, like chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br).\n    *   A single Cl atom gives an M+ and M+2 peak in a ~3:1 ratio.\n    *   Two Cl atoms give M+, M+2, and M+4 peaks in a ~9:6:1 ratio.\n    *   The observed intensity ratio for m/z 262:264:266 is 29.0 : 12.9 : 3.22. If we normalize this to the smallest peak (3.22), the ratio is approximately 9.0 : 4.0 : 1.0. This is an excellent match for a molecule containing **two chlorine atoms**.\n3.  **Molecular Formula Deduction:** The molecular ion peak (containing the most common isotopes, 35Cl) is at **m/z 262**.\n    *   The mass contribution from two 35Cl atoms is 2 * 35 = 70 amu.\n    *   The mass of the rest of the molecule (C_xH_yO_z...) is 262 - 70 = 192 amu.\n    *   Assuming the compound only contains C and H besides Cl (the absence of significant M-18, M-28, or M-31 peaks argues against O), we can determine a possible formula for the C_xH_y part. A plausible formula for a mass of 192 is **C15H12** (15 * 12 + 12 * 1 = 180 + 12 = 192).\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the unknown compound is likely **C15H12Cl2**.\n4.  **Nitrogen Rule and Degree of Unsaturation:**\n    *   The molecular weight (262) is even, which is consistent with the molecule having an even number of nitrogen atoms (including zero). Our proposed formula C15H12Cl2 has zero nitrogen atoms.\n    *   The degree of unsaturation for C15H12Cl2 is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 - X/2 = 15 + 1 - 12/2 - 2/2 = 16 - 6 - 1 = 9. This high value suggests the presence of multiple rings and/or double bonds, likely including aromatic rings.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Major Fragmentation Peaks**\n1.  **Base Peak (m/z 225):** The most intense peak is at m/z 225 (I=100%). This represents the most stable fragment ion.\n2.  **Peak Cluster around the Base Peak (m/z 225, 227, 229):** This region is key to understanding the fragmentation pathway.\n    *   m/z 225 (I=100%)\n    *   m/z 227 (I=66.7%)\n    *   m/z 229 (I=22.2%)\n    Let's analyze this cluster. It's likely a superposition of different fragments.\n3.  **Fragment [M-Cl]+ (m/z 227):** A common fragmentation for chlorinated compounds is the loss of a chlorine radical (Cl•, mass 35).\n    *   M+ - Cl• = 262 - 35 = 227. This corresponds to the peak at m/z 227.\n    *   The resulting ion, [C15H12Cl]+, contains one chlorine atom and should have an isotope peak at m/z 229 (M+2) with an intensity of about 1/3 of the m/z 227 peak.\n    *   Let's check the ratio: I(227) / I(229) = 66.7 / 22.2 ≈ 3.0. This is a perfect 3:1 ratio, confirming that the peak at m/z 227 is indeed the [M-Cl]+ fragment.\n4.  **Origin of the Base Peak (m/z 225):** Now we can deduce the identity of the base peak.\n    *   It is 2 amu less than the [M-Cl]+ peak at m/z 227. This indicates a loss of a hydrogen molecule (H2) from the [M-Cl]+ fragment.\n    *   The fragmentation pathway is: **M+ (262) → [M-Cl]+ (227) → [M-Cl-H2]+ (225)**.\n    *   The final ion, [C15H10Cl]+, is the most abundant because it is likely a highly stable, planar, fully aromatic cation formed after the rearrangement.\n\n**Step 3: Propose a Structure and Name**\nBased on the analysis, we need a structure for C15H12Cl2 that can undergo the identified fragmentation. A plausible candidate that fits the formula and whose fragmentation can lead to a highly stable cation is **1,1-dichloro-2,2-diphenylcyclopropane**.\n\n*   **Formula Check:** The structure consists of two phenyl groups (C6H5) attached to one carbon of a cyclopropane ring, and two chlorine atoms on an adjacent carbon.\n    *   Formula: (C6H5)2-C3H2Cl2. Carbon count: 2*6 + 3 = 15. Hydrogen count: 2*5 + 2 = 12. Chlorine count: 2. This matches **C15H12Cl2**.\n    *   Molecular Weight: 15*12 + 12*1 + 2*35 = 180 + 12 + 70 = 262. This matches the molecular ion peak.\n*   **Fragmentation Plausibility:** Upon ionization, the molecule can lose a chlorine atom to form a cation. This cation can then undergo rearrangement (ring-opening) and lose H2 to form a stable, conjugated aromatic system (e.g., a chlorophenylindenyl cation), which would explain the high intensity of the m/z 225 base peak.\n*   **IUPAC Name:** The systematic IUPAC name for this structure is **1,1-dichloro-2,2-diphenylcyclopropane**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe compound corresponding to the mass spectrum is **1,1-dichloro-2,2-diphenylcyclopropane**.\n\n<<<1,1-dichloro-2,2-diphenylcyclopropane>>>"
