    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens:\n\n**Analysis of Specimen H**\n\n1.  **Observation:** The specimen is reddish-brown and has a very porous, sponge-like appearance. The holes, known as vesicles, are prominent throughout the rock.\n2.  **Interpretation:** The vesicular texture indicates that this is an extrusive igneous rock, formed from lava that cooled rapidly at the Earth's surface, trapping gas bubbles. The reddish color is often due to the oxidation of iron within the magma.\n3.  **Identification:** A highly vesicular, typically reddish-brown or black extrusive igneous rock is known as **Scoria** or volcanic cinder. It is denser than pumice.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen I**\n\n1.  **Observation:** This specimen is composed of numerous smaller rock fragments (clasts) that are cemented together. The clasts are angular, not rounded, and vary in size and color (some are reddish, others are gray or white). The cementing material (matrix) appears light-colored and fine-grained.\n2.  **Interpretation:** A rock made of cemented fragments of other rocks is a clastic rock. The angularity of the clasts is a key identifying feature.\n3.  **Identification:** A clastic sedimentary or volcanic rock composed of large, angular fragments is called a **Breccia**. Given the context of other volcanic rocks, this might be a volcanic breccia, formed from an explosive eruption.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen J**\n\n1.  **Observation:** This rock is light-colored (off-white to light gray) and, like specimen H, is highly vesicular. The vesicles are very small and numerous, giving it a frothy texture. It appears to be low in density.\n2.  **Interpretation:** The light color suggests a felsic composition (rich in silica), and the highly vesicular texture points to a violent volcanic eruption with gas-rich magma. This combination results in a very lightweight rock.\n3.  **Identification:** A light-colored, extremely vesicular and low-density extrusive igneous rock is identified as **Pumice**. It is famous for being able to float on water.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen K**\n\n1.  **Observation:** This specimen is composed of large, interlocking mineral crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. The crystals are of different colors, including whitish-pink, clear gray, and some darker specks.\n2.  **Interpretation:** The presence of large, interlocking crystals (a phaneritic or coarse-grained texture) indicates that this is an intrusive igneous rock, which cooled slowly deep beneath the Earth's surface, allowing large crystals to grow. The light-colored minerals are likely quartz and feldspar.\n3.  **Identification:** An intrusive igneous rock with very large crystals is known as a **Pegmatite**. Pegmatites are often granitic in composition. While it shares a composition with granite, the exceptionally large crystal size is the defining characteristic of a pegmatite.\n\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Pegmatite\n\n<<<\nH: Scoria\nI: Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite\n>>>"
