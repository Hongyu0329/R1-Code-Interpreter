    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Observe the subject:** The image displays a clear, close-up view of an insect perched on a cluster of small yellow flowers.\n2.  **Identify key features of the insect:**\n    *   **Coloration:** The insect has a distinct black and reddish-orange color pattern.\n    *   **Body Shape:** It has an elongated, somewhat flattened oval body.\n    *   **Head:** The head is black with prominent reddish eyes.\n    *   **Thorax and Wings (Dorsal View):** The area behind the head (pronotum) is black with reddish-orange markings. The leathery part of the wings (hemelytra) are black with distinct reddish-orange borders. This pattern of lines is a crucial identification mark.\n    *   **Appendages:** It has long, black, segmented antennae and black legs.\n    *   **Order:** These features—particularly the sucking mouthparts (not clearly visible but inferred from the body type) and the partially hardened forewings (hemelytra)—are characteristic of the order Hemiptera, commonly known as \"true bugs.\"\n3.  **Narrow down the identification:** The specific coloration and markings are highly characteristic of the bug family Rhopalidae, known as scentless plant bugs. Within this family, the pattern strongly matches that of the boxelder bug.\n4.  **Confirm the species:** The most common boxelder bug with these markings in North America is the Eastern Boxelder Bug. Its scientific name is *Boisea trivittata*. The species name *trivittata* means \"three-striped,\" which refers to the three red lines typically found on the pronotum, a key identifying feature.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the visual evidence, the insect is an Eastern Boxelder Bug. The question asks for its scientific name.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **Distinguishing from similar insects:** It's important to differentiate it from other black and red/orange bugs, such as milkweed bugs (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*) or bordered plant bugs (*Largus* spp.). The specific linear pattern of the red/orange markings on the wings and thorax is unique to the boxelder bug. Milkweed bugs, for example, have a different pattern, often with a broad red/orange \"X\" or band across the back.\n*   **Scientific vs. Common Name:** The question specifically requests the \"scientific name,\" which is the formal binomial name (*Genus species*), not the common name (\"boxelder bug\").\n\nBy carefully analyzing the distinct visual characteristics of the insect, we can confidently identify it and provide its scientific name.\n\n<<<Boisea trivittata>>>"
