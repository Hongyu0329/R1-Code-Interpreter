Top Row, Center:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a traditional Chinese ink wash painting (*shuimohua*) of chrysanthemums next to a rock. The style uses bold, calligraphic brushstrokes for the leaves and finer lines for the flower petals. A red artist's seal is visible in the upper right corner, which reads \"白石\" (Báishí).\n*   **Artist:** \"Baishi\" is the art name of **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**, one of the most celebrated masters of modern Chinese painting.\n\n**3. Top Row, Right:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a highly realistic oil portrait of a woman from the Yi ethnic group. The work demonstrates masterful technique, capturing not just the physical likeness but also the sitter's dignity and character. This specific painting is a well-known masterpiece of Chinese contemporary art.\n*   **Artist:** The painting is titled \"Aji Mosha\" (or \"Yi Nationality Woman\") and was painted by **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**, a leading figure in Chinese Neoclassical Realism.\n\n**4. Middle Row, Left:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy written in an extremely fluid and dynamic \"wild cursive script\" (*kuangcao*). The characters are connected in a continuous, energetic flow. This is a detail from a famous and historically significant calligraphy scroll.\n*   **Artist:** This is a detail from the \"Autobiography\" scroll (自叙帖) by the Tang Dynasty monk **Huai Su (怀素)**, who is considered one of the greatest masters of cursive script.\n\n**5.

Middle Row, Right:**\n*   **Analysis:** This is a piece of calligraphy in an elegant and slender Regular Script (*kaishu*). The characters are precisely formed but have a graceful, delicate quality. This style is a hallmark of the early Tang Dynasty.\n*   **Artist:** This is the work of **Chu Suiliang (褚遂良)**, one of the Four Great Calligraphers of the Early Tang.
