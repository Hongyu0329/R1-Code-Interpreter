    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the total area of the shaded regions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the geometric setup and find the key parameters.**\n1.  The image shows a circular sector with its center at the bottom vertex (let's call it O).\n2.  The radius of the sector, `r`, is given by the length of the leftmost blue line, which is labeled as 34. So, `r = 34`.\n3.  The sector is divided into four smaller sectors by radial lines, each subtending an angle of `θ`. The total angle of the large sector is `4θ`.\n4.  There are right-angle symbols shown. Let's analyze the leftmost one. A line segment starts from the leftmost point on the arc (let's call it P₀), has a length of 17, and ends on the adjacent radius at a point (let's call it Q₁). This segment is perpendicular to the radius `OQ₁`.\n5.  This forms a right-angled triangle `OQ₁P₀`, with the right angle at `Q₁`. The hypotenuse is the radius `OP₀`, so `OP₀ = r = 34`. The side opposite to the angle `θ = ∠P₀OQ₁` is `P₀Q₁`, which has a length of 17.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the angle θ.**\n1.  In the right-angled triangle `OQ₁P₀`, we can use the definition of the sine function:\n    `sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse = P₀Q₁ / OP₀`\n2.  Substituting the known values:\n    `sin(θ) = 17 / 34 = 1/2`\n3.  The angle `θ` for which `sin(θ) = 1/2` is `30°` or `π/6` radians.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the method for calculating the total shaded area.**\nThe total shaded area can be found by calculating the area of the entire large sector and subtracting the areas of the unshaded (white) regions within it. This method is direct and avoids potential confusion from the overlapping regions mentioned in the note.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the area of the entire circular sector.**\n1.  The total angle of the sector is `4θ`. Since `θ = 30°`, the total angle is `4 * 30° = 120°`.\n2.  The radius is `r = 34`.\n3.  The area of a circular sector is given by the formula `Area = (angle/360°) * π * r²`.\n4.  `Area_sector = (120° / 360°) * π * (34)² = (1/3) * π * 1156 = 1156π / 3`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the area of the unshaded (white) regions.**\n1.  The unshaded regions are identified by the right-angle markings. There are four such markings, each defining a right-angled triangle.\n2.  Let's analyze one such triangle, `ΔOQ₁P₀`. The hypotenuse is `r = 34` and one angle is `θ = 30°`.\n3.  The legs of the triangle are:\n    - `P₀Q₁ = r * sin(θ) = 34 * sin(30°) = 34 * (1/2) = 17`.\n    - `OQ₁ = r * cos(θ) = 34 * cos(30°) = 34 * (√3 / 2) = 17√3`.\n4.  The area of this triangle is `(1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * OQ₁ * P₀Q₁ = (1/2) * (17√3) * 17 = 289√3 / 2`.\n5.  By symmetry, all four white triangles indicated by the right-angle symbols are congruent and have the same area. The four white triangles are:\n    - The triangle formed by the perpendicular from P₀ to the radius at angle `θ`.\n    - The triangle formed by the perpendicular from P₂ to the radius at angle `θ`.\n    - The triangle formed by the perpendicular from P₂ to the radius at angle `3θ`.\n    - The triangle formed by the perpendicular from P₄ to the radius at angle `3θ`.\n6.  The total area of the four white triangles is `4 * (289√3 / 2) = 2 * 289√3 = 578√3`.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the total area of the shaded regions.**\n1.  Total Shaded Area = Area of the entire sector - Total area of the white regions.\n2.  Total Shaded Area = `(1156π / 3) - 578√3`.\n\nThe note about the overlapping area is a feature of how the blue and red regions are defined individually, but when calculating the total area of all shaded regions (the union), the subtraction method is the most straightforward and bypasses the need to handle the overlap explicitly. The calculated result is the exact area.\n\nFinal expression for the total shaded area is `1156π/3 - 578√3`.\n\n<<<1156*pi/3 - 578*sqrt(3)>>>"
