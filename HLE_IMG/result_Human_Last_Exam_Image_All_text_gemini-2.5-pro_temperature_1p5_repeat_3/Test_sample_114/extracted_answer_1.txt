The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 arises because the starting material, N-acetyl-proline, forms a rigid, bicyclic münchnone intermediate. In this intermediate, the acetyl group and the atoms of the proline ring are locked in a fixed geometry and are chemically distinct. This structural rigidity prevents the intermediate from undergoing any rearrangement or scrambling processes. Consequently, the cycloaddition with methyl propiolate proceeds through a single, sterically and electronically favored pathway, yielding a single regioisomeric product (Product B).

The results from Reactions 1 and 2 are critical to this rationale because they demonstrate the behavior of a comparable but flexible system. The 13C labelling experiment in Reaction 2 shows that for the acyclic N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine, the münchnone intermediate undergoes a scrambling process that makes the acetyl-methyl and the alanine-α-methyl groups equivalent. This leads to a total loss of regioselectivity with respect to the origin of these two groups. This finding establishes that such scrambling is possible for flexible münchnones. The high selectivity seen in Reaction 3 can therefore be directly attributed to its rigid structure, which inhibits this scrambling pathway, thus preserving the regiochemical integrity of the intermediate and leading to a selective reaction.
