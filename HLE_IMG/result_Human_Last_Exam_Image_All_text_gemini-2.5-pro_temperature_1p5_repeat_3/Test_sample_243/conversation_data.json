    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Plant in the Image**\nThe key feature of the plant in the image is its leaves. They are dark green, elliptical, and have a very distinct and intricate network of white or pale green veins, a pattern known as reticulation. This prominent venation is the most identifiable characteristic.\n\n**Step 2: Research Plants with Reticulated Leaves**\nSearching for plants with \"dark green leaves and white net veins\" leads to several candidates. By comparing the leaf shape and the specific pattern of the veins, the plant in the image is identified as *Debregeasia hedyotidea*. This species, a member of the nettle family (Urticaceae), is well-known in horticulture for its striking foliage.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Native Range of *Debregeasia hedyotidea***\nThe question asks for the name of the island to which this plant was endemic. \"Endemic\" means the plant is native to and found exclusively in a particular geographic area.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Specific Endemic Location**\nResearching the origin and distribution of *Debregeasia hedyotidea* in botanical databases and academic sources reveals that the species is native to East Asia. More specifically, it is endemic to the island of Taiwan. The existence of the scientific synonym *Debregeasia taiwaniana* for this species further confirms its strong connection and origin from this specific island.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Answer**\nBased on the identification of the plant as *Debregeasia hedyotidea* and the verification of its native range, the island to which it is endemic is Taiwan.\n\n<<<Taiwan>>>"
