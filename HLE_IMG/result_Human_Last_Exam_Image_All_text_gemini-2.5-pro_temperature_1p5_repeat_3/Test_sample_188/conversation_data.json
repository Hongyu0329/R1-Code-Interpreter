    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph Structure**\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph, which we'll call G.\n*   **Vertices V(G):** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (5 vertices)\n*   **Edges E(G):** {(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)} (7 edges)\n\nThe graph has some notable substructures.\n*   The vertices {2, 3, 4} form a triangle (a 3-clique, K₃).\n*   The vertices {3, 4, 5} also form a triangle.\n*   The subgraph induced by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is a complete graph K₄ with one edge, (2, 5), removed. This is often denoted K₄-e.\n*   Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method for Computation**\nThe chromatic polynomial, P(G, k), counts the number of proper vertex colorings of a graph G using a set of k colors. A powerful method for computing this polynomial is the **Deletion-Contraction Principle**. This principle states that for any edge `e` in a graph G:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k)\nwhere:\n*   `G - e` is the graph G with the edge `e` deleted.\n*   `G / e` is the graph G with the edge `e` contracted (its two endpoints are merged into a single vertex).\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Deletion-Contraction Method**\nWe need to choose an edge `e` to delete and contract. A good choice is an edge that simplifies the graph's structure significantly. Let's choose the edge **e = (3, 4)** because it is part of two triangles.\n\n**Part A: Compute the chromatic polynomial of G' = G - (3, 4)**\nIn the graph G' = G - (3, 4), the edge between 3 and 4 is removed. A key observation is that vertices 3 and 4 now have the same neighborhood: {2, 5}. We can compute P(G', k) by coloring the vertices in a specific order: 2, 5, 1, 3, 4.\n\n1.  Color vertex 2: There are **k** choices.\n2.  Color vertex 5: Vertex 5 is not adjacent to vertex 2 in G'. We must consider two cases based on the color of vertex 5 relative to vertex 2.\n    *   **Case 1: C(5) = C(2)**.\n        *   There is only **1** choice for the color of 5.\n        *   Color vertex 1: It is adjacent to 2 and 5, which have the same color. So, there are **k-1** choices for 1.\n        *   Color vertex 3: It is adjacent to 2 and 5. There are **k-1** choices for 3.\n        *   Color vertex 4: It is adjacent to 2 and 5. There are **k-1** choices for 4.\n        *   Total colorings in this case: k * 1 * (k-1) * (k-1) * (k-1) = **k(k-1)³**.\n\n    *   **Case 2: C(5) ≠ C(2)**.\n        *   There are **k-1** choices for the color of 5.\n        *   Color vertex 1: It is adjacent to 2 and 5, which have different colors. There are **k-2** choices for 1.\n        *   Color vertex 3: It is adjacent to 2 and 5. There are **k-2** choices for 3.\n        *   Color vertex 4: It is adjacent to 2 and 5. There are **k-2** choices for 4.\n        *   Total colorings in this case: k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-2) * (k-2) = **k(k-1)(k-2)³**.\n\n3.  The total number of colorings for G' is the sum of the colorings from both cases:\n    P(G', k) = k(k-1)³ + k(k-1)(k-2)³\n    P(G', k) = k(k-1)[(k-1)² + (k-2)³]\n    P(G', k) = k(k-1)[(k² - 2k + 1) + (k³ - 6k² + 12k - 8)]\n    P(G', k) = k(k-1)[k³ - 5k² + 10k - 7]\n    P(G', k) = k(k⁴ - 5k³ + 10k² - 7k - k³ + 5k² - 10k + 7)\n    P(G', k) = **k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 15k³ - 17k² + 7k**\n\n**Part B: Compute the chromatic polynomial of G'' = G / (3, 4)**\nIn the graph G'' = G / (3, 4), the edge (3, 4) is contracted. This means vertices 3 and 4 are merged into a single new vertex, which we can call `v₃₄`.\n\n1.  The vertices of G'' are {1, 2, 5, `v₃₄`}.\n2.  The edges of G'' are the original edges, with any edge connected to 3 or 4 now connected to `v₃₄`.\n    *   Edges not involving 3 or 4: (1, 2), (1, 5).\n    *   Edges involving 3 or 4:\n        *   (2, 3) becomes (2, `v₃₄`).\n        *   (2, 4) also becomes (2, `v₃₄`). (This is a single edge in the simple graph).\n        *   (3, 5) becomes (`v₃₄`, 5).\n        *   (4, 5) also becomes (`v₃₄`, 5).\n3.  The resulting graph G'' has edges {(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, `v₃₄`), (`v₃₄`, 5)}. This forms a 4-cycle (a square): 1 — 2 — `v₃₄` — 5 — 1.\n4.  The chromatic polynomial of a cycle graph Cₙ is given by the formula P(Cₙ, k) = (k-1)ⁿ + (-1)ⁿ(k-1). For n=4:\n    P(G'', k) = P(C₄, k) = (k-1)⁴ + (-1)⁴(k-1)\n    P(G'', k) = (k-1)⁴ + (k-1)\n    P(G'', k) = (k⁴ - 4k³ + 6k² - 4k + 1) + (k-1)\n    P(G'', k) = **k⁴ - 4k³ + 6k² - 3k**\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Results**\nNow, we use the deletion-contraction formula: P(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G'', k).\n\nP(G, k) = (k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 15k³ - 17k² + 7k) - (k⁴ - 4k³ + 6k² - 3k)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ + (-6-1)k⁴ + (15 - (-4))k³ + (-17 - 6)k² + (7 - (-3))k\nP(G, k) = **k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k**\n\nThis polynomial can also be written in factored form: **k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)**.\n\nFinal check:\n*   P(G, 2) = 32 - 7(16) + 19(8) - 23(4) + 10(2) = 32 - 112 + 152 - 92 + 20 = 204 - 204 = 0. This is correct, as the graph contains triangles and is not 2-colorable.\n*   P(G, 3) = 243 - 7(81) + 19(27) - 23(9) + 10(3) = 243 - 567 + 513 - 207 + 30 = 786 - 774 = 12. This indicates there are 12 ways to 3-color the graph, and the chromatic number is 3.\n\nThe derived polynomial is correct.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
