    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval.\n\n**Step 1: Identify Synchronized Bursts and their Timestamps**\nFirst, we need to understand the provided graph. It is a raster plot where the y-axis represents the electrode number (from 0 to 128) and the x-axis represents time in seconds (from 0 to 50 s). Each black dot indicates a firing event (an action potential) from a specific electrode at a specific time.\n\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a period where a large number of neurons (electrodes) fire in a short time window. Visually, these appear as dense vertical bands in the plot. We will identify these bursts and estimate their starting time from the x-axis.\n\n*   **Burst 1:** The first distinct burst begins shortly after t=0. We can estimate its start time as **t₁ = 1 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The next burst is located between 10 s and 20 s. It appears to start at approximately **t₂ = 13 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** The third burst is located between 20 s and 30 s. It seems to begin at approximately **t₃ = 24 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** The fourth burst is clearly visible halfway between 30 s and 40 s. We can estimate its start time as **t₄ = 35 s**.\n*   **Burst 5:** The final major burst in the recording window occurs after 40 s, at approximately **t₅ = 47 s**.\n\nThe timestamps of the five identified bursts are approximately 1 s, 13 s, 24 s, 35 s, and 47 s.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between the start of one burst and the start of the next consecutive burst. With five bursts, we can calculate four such intervals.\n\n*   **IBI 1:** Time between Burst 2 and Burst 1 = t₂ - t₁ = 13 s - 1 s = **12 s**\n*   **IBI 2:** Time between Burst 3 and Burst 2 = t₃ - t₂ = 24 s - 13 s = **11 s**\n*   **IBI 3:** Time between Burst 4 and Burst 3 = t₄ - t₃ = 35 s - 24 s = **11 s**\n*   **IBI 4:** Time between Burst 5 and Burst 4 = t₅ - t₄ = 47 s - 35 s = **12 s**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual intervals and divide by the total number of intervals.\n\n*   Sum of IBIs = 12 s + 11 s + 11 s + 12 s = 46 s\n*   Number of intervals = 4\n*   Average IBI = (Sum of IBIs) / (Number of intervals) = 46 s / 4 = **11.5 s**\n\n**Step 4: Round the Answer to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question requires the final answer to be reported to two significant figures.\n\n*   The calculated average is 11.5 s.\n*   The first two significant figures are '1' and '1'.\n*   The digit following the second significant figure is '5'. According to standard rounding rules, when the digit to be dropped is 5 or greater, the preceding digit is rounded up.\n*   Therefore, we round 11 up to 12.\n\nThe average inter-burst interval, rounded to two significant figures, is 12 s.\n\n<<<12>>>"
