    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Object:** The image shows a large, round medallion with an attached suspension loop. It is made of metal, likely gold, and features two figures in relief facing each other. This specific artifact is known to archaeologists as the Pietroasele Medallion (or Pietroasa Medallion).\n\n2.  **Identify the Archaeological Context:** This medallion is the most prominent piece from the Pietroasele Treasure, a famous hoard of gold objects discovered in Pietroasele, Romania, in 1837. This treasure is strongly associated with the Goths, a Germanic people who inhabited the area north of the Danube in late antiquity.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Iconography and Style:** The central image on the medallion shows two confronting busts. The figure on the left is particularly notable for having ram's horns, an iconographic trait linked to the syncretic deity Jupiter-Ammon and famously adopted by Alexander the Great. The figure on the right is thought to be a consort or another important figure. The artistic style is not of the classical Roman imperial center but is characteristic of late Roman provincial or \"barbarian\" art, reflecting the tastes and craftsmanship of the Gothic elite who commissioned or used it.\n\n4.  **Determine the Date:** Archaeologists and historians date the objects in the Pietroasele Treasure based on stylistic analysis, comparison with other artifacts (like specific types of fibulae also found in the hoard), and the historical context. The treasure is generally believed to have been buried around 400 AD, possibly as a reaction to the invasions of the Huns. The manufacture of the items themselves, including this medallion, is consistently placed in the second half of the 4th century AD (i.e., between 350 and 400 AD).\n\n5.  **Conclude the Century:** Since the medallion was made during the latter half of the 300s AD, archaeologists ascribe it to the **4th century AD**.\n\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
