    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the ID of the runestone.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the runestone.**\nThe image shows a fragment of a runestone with runes carved in straight, horizontal bands, separated by ruled lines. This is a relatively uncommon style, as many Viking Age runestones feature inscriptions that follow the winding body of a serpent or dragon (the \"runestone style\"). The runes themselves appear to be from the Younger Futhark script, typical of the Viking Age. The `x`-like symbols are used as separators between words.\n\n**Step 2: Transliterate the visible runes.**\nTo identify the stone, we need to read the runes and convert them into Latin letters. Let's examine the three visible rows of text.\n\n*   **Top Row (from right to left, as that is clearer):**\n    *   The last visible rune is `ᚱ` (r, transliterated as 'r').\n    *   Before that is `ᚢ` (úrr, transliterated as 'u').\n    *   Then `ᚦ` (þurs, transliterated as 'þ' or 'th').\n    *   Then `ᛅ` (ár, transliterated as 'a').\n    *   Then `ᚠ` (fé, transliterated as 'f'). This spells `faþur` (father).\n    *   Before that is a separator (`:`).\n    *   Then `ᛚ` (lögr, transliterated as 'l').\n    *   Then `ᛁ` (íss, transliterated as 'i').\n    *   Then `ᚴ` (kaun, transliterated as 'k').\n    *   Then `ᚱ` (reið, transliterated as 'r').\n    *   Then `ᚢ` (úrr, transliterated as 'u').\n    *   Then `ᚦ` (þurs, transliterated as 'þ' or 'th').\n    *   So, the top row reads `...þurkil : faþur...`, which in Old Norse is `...Þorkel, faður...` (\"...Thorkil, father...\").\n\n*   **Middle Row (from left to right):**\n    *   Starts with `ᛋ` (sól, transliterated as 's').\n    *   Followed by `ᛁ` (íss, transliterated as 'i').\n    *   Then `ᚾ` (nauðr, transliterated as 'n'). This spells `sin` (\"his/her\").\n    *   Then a separator (`:`).\n    *   Then `ᛅ` (ár, transliterated as 'a').\n    *   Then `ᚢ` (úrr, transliterated as 'u').\n    *   Then `ᚴ` (kaun, transliterated as 'k'). This spells `auk` (\"and\").\n    *   Then a separator (`:`).\n    *   Then `ᛅ` (ár, transliterated as 'a').\n    *   Then `ᚠ` (fé, transliterated as 'f').\n    *   Then `ᛏ` (týr, transliterated as 't').\n    *   Then `ᛁ` (íss, transliterated as 'i').\n    *   Then `ᛦ` (ýr, transliterated as 'R' or 'ʀ'). This spells `aftiʀ` (\"in memory of\").\n    *   The full middle row reads `: sin : auk : aftiʀ`, which is `sinn, ok æftiR...` (\"his, and in memory of...\").\n\n*   **Bottom Row (from left to right, partially visible):**\n    *   Starts with a separator `x`.\n    *   Then `ᚾ` (nauðr, transliterated as 'n').\n    *   Then `ᚢ` (úrr, transliterated as 'u').\n    *   Then `ᛅ` (ár, transliterated as 'a').\n    *   Then `ᚱ` (reið, transliterated as 'r'). This spells `nuar`.\n    *   Then a separator `x`.\n    *   Then `ᛘ` (maðr, transliterated as 'm').\n    *   Then `ᚢ` (úrr, transliterated as 'u').\n    *   Then `ᚦ` (þurs, transliterated as 'þ').\n    *   The bottom row fragment reads `...nuar : muþ...`\n\n**Step 3: Combine the fragments and search for the runestone.**\nThe transcribed text fragment reads:\n`...Þorkel, faður sinn, ok æftiR ... [Gu]nnvar, moður...`\n(\"...Thorkil, his father, and in memory of... [Gu]nnvar, mother...\")\n\nThe question states this is an \"Ingvar runestone\". These are a specific group of stones related to Ingvar the Far-Travelled's expedition to the Caspian Sea (Serkland). Searching for an Ingvar runestone with the distinctive banded style and this particular text leads to a specific artifact.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific runestone.**\nThe text and style perfectly match the **Strängnäs Cathedral runestone**, which has the catalog ID **Sö 281**.\n\nThe full inscription on Sö 281 reads (in part):\n`... let ræisa stæin þennsa æftiR Þorkel, faður sinn, ok æftiR Gunnvar, moður sina ... foru austr með Ingvari i Særkland...`\n(\"...had this stone raised in memory of Thorkil, his father, and in memory of Gunnvar, his mother ... travelled east with Ingvar to Serkland...\")\n\nThe explicit mention of Ingvar confirms it as an Ingvar runestone, and the portion of the inscription matches the image fragment precisely.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the unique visual style (horizontal bands) and the successful transliteration of the runes, which matches a known inscription, the runestone depicted in the image is Sö 281.\n\n<<<Sö 281>>>"
