    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the substituents at the numbered positions.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Reaction**\nThe reaction shows a polycyclic alcohol (a triterpenoid) reacting with catalytic hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 110 Â°C. These are conditions for an acid-catalyzed dehydration and rearrangement. The process will involve the formation of a carbocation followed by a series of [1,2]-hydride and [1,2]-methyl shifts (a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement cascade, also known as a backbone rearrangement in terpenoids) to form a more stable carbocation, which then eliminates a proton to form a stable alkene.\n\n**Step 2: Propose the Initial Steps**\n1.  **Protonation:** The lone pair on the oxygen of the hydroxyl (-OH) group attacks a proton (H+) from HCl. This protonates the alcohol, forming an oxonium ion (-OH2+), which is a good leaving group.\n2.  **Carbocation Formation:** The water molecule (H2O) departs, leaving behind a secondary carbocation on the carbon where the alcohol was attached (let's call this C3, following standard terpenoid numbering).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Rearrangement Cascade**\nA cascade of [1,2] shifts occurs to move the positive charge through the molecular skeleton to a more stable position, typically driven by the formation of more substituted (tertiary) carbocations along the way and leading to a thermodynamically stable final alkene.\n\nThere are two main possibilities for the first rearrangement step starting from the C3 carbocation.\n*   **Path A (Standard Backbone Rearrangement):** A [1,2]-methyl shift from the adjacent quaternary carbon C4.\n*   **Path B (Alternative):** A shift from the other adjacent carbon, C2, or a more distant group.\n\nLet's analyze the product structure to determine the correct path.\nThe product at position 1, which corresponds to C4 of the reactant, clearly shows a gem-dimethyl group (two CH3 groups on the same carbon). The reactant also has a gem-dimethyl group at C4. This is a critical clue: the gem-dimethyl group at C4 remains intact. This means that a methyl group from C4 did *not* migrate to C3. Therefore, Path A did not happen.\n\nThe rearrangement must have been initiated in a way that bypasses C4. While a [1,3]-hydride shift (H from C5 moving to C3) is mechanistically less common, it would lead to a cation at C5 while preserving the C4 gem-dimethyl group. Given the product structure, we will assume this or an equivalent non-standard initiation occurs, leading to a cascade that starts from the C5 cation.\n\n**Step 4: Trace the Substituents through the Cascade**\nLet's assume the cascade begins with the formation of a carbocation at C5, and follow the subsequent shifts to determine the final identity of the substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. We will trace what substituent ends up at each numbered position in the product. The numbering corresponds to standard triterpenoid atom positions: 1=C4, 2=C10, 3=C5, 4=C8, 5=C9.\n\n*   **Position 1 (at C4):** As established, this position is not involved in the rearrangement. It starts with two methyl groups and ends with two methyl groups. Thus, the substituent labeled '1' is a **CH3**.\n*   **Position 3 (at C5):** The rearrangement cascade effectively starts here (C5+). To stabilize this charge, the methyl group from the adjacent C10 migrates to C5. Therefore, the original hydrogen at C5 has left (initiating the cascade), and a methyl group has arrived. The final substituent at position 3 is **CH3**.\n*   **Position 2 (at C10):** After its methyl group migrates to C5, C10 becomes a carbocation. To stabilize this, a hydride (H-) from the adjacent C9 migrates to C10. The final substituent at position 2 is **H**.\n*   **Position 5 (at C9):** After its hydrogen migrates to C10, C9 becomes a carbocation. To stabilize this, a hydride from the adjacent C8 migrates to C9. The final substituent at position 5 is **H**.\n*   **Position 4 (at C8):** After its hydrogen migrates to C9, C8 becomes a carbocation. To stabilize this, the methyl group from the adjacent C14 migrates to C8. The final substituent at position 4 is **CH3**.\n\n**Step 5: Consolidate the Results**\nBased on the step-by-step trace of the migrating groups, we can determine the final substituents:\n*   Position 1 = **CH3**\n*   Position 2 = **H**\n*   Position 3 = **CH3**\n*   Position 4 = **CH3**\n*   Position 5 = **H**\n\n(Note: The formation of the specific C=C double bond shown in the product from the final carbocation at C14 is mechanistically problematic with the available protons. However, the question asks for the identity of the substituents, which is consistently determined by the rearrangement cascade described above).\n\nFinal answer in the requested format:\n1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H.\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
