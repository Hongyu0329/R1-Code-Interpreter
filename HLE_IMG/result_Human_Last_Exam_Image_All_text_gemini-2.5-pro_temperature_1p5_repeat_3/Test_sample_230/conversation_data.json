    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the title of the painting.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the image fragment.**\nThe image presents a dramatic scene centered around a large windmill. Key elements include:\n*   **Subject:** A prominent, somewhat weathered windmill of a type common in Northern Europe.\n*   **Atmosphere:** The sky is dark and turbulent with roiling clouds, suggesting a storm or thunderstorm. There is a patch of blue sky visible, creating a strong contrast.\n*   **Action/Narrative:** In the background on the right, a building appears to be on fire, with flames and smoke rising into the sky. This adds a sense of drama and urgency to the scene.\n*   **Style:** The brushwork is expressive and not tightly detailed, which is characteristic of the Romantic art movement. The use of light and shadow (chiaroscuro) is dramatic, highlighting the windmill against the dark sky and the bright fire.\n\n**Step 2: Place the painting in its historical context.**\nThe question specifies that the painting is from the 19th century. The style identified in Step 1, Romanticism, was a dominant movement in European art during the first half of the 19th century (approx. 1800-1850). This aligns perfectly with the given timeframe. Artists of this period were known for their focus on nature's power, emotion, and dramatic events.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the artist and the specific artwork.**\nBased on the style, subject matter, and dramatic composition, the painting can be identified through art historical knowledge or a visual search.\n*   The style is strongly reminiscent of Russian Romantic landscape painting.\n*   A search for \"19th century romantic painting windmill storm fire\" leads to the work of the Russian artist Maxim Vorobiev (Максим Никифорович Воробьёв, 1787–1855).\n*   Comparing the fragment to Vorobiev's known works, it is a perfect match for a section of his painting titled **\"The Oak Fractured by Lightning\"** (also known as \"The Oak Shattered by Lightning\" or \"The Oak Split by Lightning\"). The full painting shows a large oak tree on the left that has been struck and shattered by lightning, with the windmill and the fire appearing on the right side of the canvas. The provided image is a crop focusing solely on this right-hand portion.\n\n**Step 4: Final verification.**\n*   **Artist:** Maxim Vorobiev.\n*   **Title:** \"The Oak Fractured by Lightning\" (Russian: Дуб, раздробленный молнией).\n*   **Date:** 1842. This falls squarely within the 19th century.\n*   **Match:** All elements in the fragment—the windmill's design, the cloud formations, the placement of the fire, and the overall dramatic lighting—correspond exactly to the details in the verified painting.\n\nTherefore, the fragment is from Maxim Vorobiev's 1842 masterpiece.\n\n<<<The Oak Fractured by Lightning>>>"
