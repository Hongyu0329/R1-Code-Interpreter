    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein of the organism shown.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organism in the image.**\n*   The image displays a bright yellow, lobed organism growing on rocks. This is characteristic of a lichen.\n*   The small, cup-like structures visible in the center are called apothecia, which are reproductive structures.\n*   The morphology—a foliose (leaf-like) thallus, yellow color, and presence of apothecia—strongly suggests it belongs to the genus *Xanthoria*.\n*   Given the location is Acadia National Park (a coastal area), a very common species with this appearance is *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the specific question.**\n*   The question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"encoded XPH1 protein\" of this specific organism (*Xanthoria parietina*).\n*   \"XPH1\" is a gene/protein name. A quick search reveals that XPH1 likely stands for *Xanthoria parietina* Photolyase 1, an enzyme involved in DNA repair using light energy.\n\n**Step 3: Find the protein sequence information.**\n*   To find the number of amino acids, we need to consult a public biological database, such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).\n*   A search in the NCBI protein database for \"*Xanthoria parietina* XPH1\" will locate the protein entry.\n*   The relevant protein entry for XPH1 photolyase from *Xanthoria parietina* can be found under the accession number **AAD02061.1**.\n\n**Step 4: Extract the number of amino acids.**\n*   The NCBI database entry for a protein provides detailed information, including its source organism, function, and its complete amino acid sequence.\n*   Critically, the entry also explicitly states the length of the protein in terms of the number of amino acids (aa).\n*   By consulting the record for AAD02061.1, we can see that the full length of the XPH1 protein is specified. The record indicates the protein is 556 amino acids long.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the final answer.**\n*   Based on the identification of the organism as *Xanthoria parietina* and the data retrieved from the NCBI protein database, the XPH1 protein encoded by this lichen consists of 556 amino acids.\n\n<<<556>>>"
