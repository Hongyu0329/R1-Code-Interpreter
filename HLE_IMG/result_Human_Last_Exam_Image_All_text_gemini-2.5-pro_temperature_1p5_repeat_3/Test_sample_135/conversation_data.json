    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Image Observation:** The image shows a circular bas-relief, also known as a tondo. It is a work of sculpture, likely carved in marble or cast in terracotta.\n2.  **Subject Matter Analysis:** The scene is religious. A figure dressed as a priest is administering a wafer (the Host) to a group of kneeling figures, one of whom is a child. This depicts a Christian sacrament, specifically the Eucharist or Holy Communion.\n3.  **Inscription Analysis:** At the bottom of the roundel, there is a small plaque or cartouche with a visible inscription. Although not perfectly clear, it reads \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This is an archaic Italian phrase that translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" further confirming the subject as the Eucharist.\n4.  **Style Analysis:** The style is characteristic of the Early Italian Renaissance (15th century Florence). The figures are rendered with naturalism, grace, and serene expressions. The composition is orderly and clear. The technique of very shallow relief carving (rilievo stiacciato) combined with more rounded forms is typical of masters from this period.\n5.  **Artist Identification:** The gentle sweetness of the figures, the clarity of the composition, and the mastery of the medium (which is glazed terracotta) are hallmarks of the work of **Luca della Robbia** (c. 1399/1400 â€“ 1482), a renowned Florentine sculptor.\n6.  **Artwork Verification:** By searching for works by Luca della Robbia depicting the \"Sacrament of the Altar\" or \"Communion,\" we can identify this specific piece. This is a tondo from the predella of a ciborium (a tabernacle for the Eucharist) that Luca della Robbia created for the church of the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence around 1441-1443. The entire work is now conserved in the Museo Nazionale del Bargello in Florence.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on the style, subject matter, inscription, and historical records, the author of this relief is Luca della Robbia.\n\n<<<Luca della Robbia>>>"
