The S100B protein binds to the V-domain of the RAGE receptor. It can be used as a prognostic marker because its levels correlate directly with the downstream pathological events like neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration, thus providing information about the likely progression and severity of the neurological disorder.
