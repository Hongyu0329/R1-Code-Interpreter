    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Understand the question:** We need to identify which of the four provided patterns (A, B, C, or D) represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure when viewed along the [110] direction. \"Viewed along\" means we are looking at a 2D projection of the 3D atomic arrangement onto a plane perpendicular to the [110] vector.\n\n2.  **Recall the FCC structure:** An FCC lattice has atoms at each of the 8 corners of a cube and at the center of each of the 6 faces. The basis of the FCC lattice can be described by atoms at positions (0,0,0), (a/2, a/2, 0), (a/2, 0, a/2), and (0, a/2, 1/2), where 'a' is the lattice constant. All other atoms are translations of these by integer multiples of the lattice vectors (a,0,0), (0,a,0), (0,0,a).\n\n3.  **Determine the theoretical projection pattern for FCC along [110]:**\n    *   The [110] direction is a face diagonal of the cubic unit cell.\n    *   When we project the atom positions onto a plane perpendicular to [110], the atoms form a specific 2D pattern.\n    *   Let's consider the atoms in the FCC lattice. They form layers perpendicular to the [110] direction. These layers are stacked in an A-B-A-B... sequence.\n    *   The atoms in an \"A\" layer project to form a rectangular grid. The dimensions of the primitive rectangle in this grid are `a` and `a√2`.\n    *   The atoms in a \"B\" layer also project to form an identical rectangular grid. However, this grid is shifted relative to the \"A\" layer's grid. The shift is such that each \"B\" atom projects onto the center of a rectangle formed by the \"A\" atoms.\n    *   Therefore, the overall projection is a **centered rectangular lattice**. The key features are:\n        a) The arrangement forms a repeating rectangular unit cell.\n        b) There are atoms at the corners of this rectangle and one atom at its geometric center.\n        c) The ratio of the sides of this rectangle is `a√2 / a = √2 ≈ 1.414`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the given images based on the theoretical pattern:**\n\n    *   **Image D:** The atoms are arranged in a pattern with clear six-fold local symmetry. You can identify hexagonal motifs. This pattern is characteristic of an FCC (or BCC) lattice viewed along the [111] direction (the cube's body diagonal). So, D is not the [110] view.\n\n    *   **Image B:** The atoms seem to form a square (or nearly square) unit cell, with atoms at the corners, the center, and the middle of the edges. A square has an aspect ratio of 1. The predicted pattern for [110] is a rectangle with an aspect ratio of √2. Also, the pattern in B is more complex than a simple centered rectangle. This pattern is characteristic of a projection along a different direction, but not [110]. For reference, the FCC projection along [100] is a simple square lattice, and for BCC along [100] is a centered square lattice. B does not match these either but is clearly not the [110] view.\n\n    *   **Image A:** The arrangement does not show a clear centered rectangular pattern. There are two columns of atoms, but there's no repeating unit cell with an atom at its center. This pattern does not match the expected FCC [110] projection.\n\n    *   **Image C:** This image shows atoms that can be organized into two sets of interpenetrating rectangular grids. For example, one rectangle can be seen with corners near (4, 18), (9, 18), (4, 12), and (9, 12). The center of this rectangle would be at (6.5, 15). We can see another atom from the second set at (6.5, 14), which is very close to this center point. This structure, despite some apparent graphical inaccuracies in the precise positions and aspect ratio (the drawn aspect ratio is about 6/5 = 1.2, which is reasonably close to √2≈1.414 compared to other options), is qualitatively a centered rectangular lattice. This matches the theoretical prediction for the FCC [110] view.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** By eliminating the other options and identifying the characteristic features, Image C is the one that represents the centered rectangular lattice pattern of an FCC structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<C>>>"
