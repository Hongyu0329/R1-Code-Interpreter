    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the organisms:** The photo displays a community of organisms on a wet rock, characteristic of a marine intertidal zone. We can clearly identify several types of animals:\n    *   **Barnacles:** Numerous acorn barnacles are attached to the rock surface. These are the cone-shaped shells with a diamond-shaped opening at the top.\n    *   **Snails:** There are at least three types of snails visible.\n        *   Two large gastropod shells, one with faint brown spiral bands (*Littorina littorea*).\n        *   Several smaller, darker, more globular snails with pronounced ridges (*Littorina saxatilis*).\n        *   Tiny, whitish-grey bead-like organisms, possibly snail spat or a very small snail species.\n\n2.  **Determine the indicator species:** The question asks for a species that *definitively* indicates the photo was taken on the Atlantic rather than the Pacific Coast. This requires us to examine the known geographical distribution of the identified species.\n\n    *   **Barnacles:** The barnacles are likely *Semibalanus balanoides*, the Northern Rock Barnacle. While this species is native to the North Atlantic, it has been introduced and established in some areas of the Pacific Coast. Therefore, its presence is not a *definitive* indicator.\n    *   **Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*):** The larger, striped snail is the Common Periwinkle. This species is native to the Northeast Atlantic (Europe) and Northwest Atlantic (North America). However, it was introduced to the Pacific Coast of North America in the late 19th or early 20th century and can be found in places like San Francisco Bay. Thus, its presence alone is not a *definitive* sign of the Atlantic coast.\n    *   **Rough Periwinkle (*Littorina saxatilis*):** The smaller, dark snails with prominent ridges are identifiable as the Rough Periwinkle. Let's examine its distribution. This species is native to the coasts of the North Atlantic Ocean, including Europe and North America. Crucially, it has **not** been successfully introduced to or established on the Pacific Coast of North America.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The presence of the Rough Periwinkle, *Littorina saxatilis*, is a definitive piece of evidence that this photo was taken on a coast of the North Atlantic Ocean. The co-occurrence of *Semibalanus balanoides* and *Littorina littorea* further supports this conclusion, as this assemblage is classic for North Atlantic rocky shores, but it is the exclusive Atlantic distribution of *Littorina saxatilis* that provides the definitive proof requested by the question.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   **Identification:** Accurate identification of the species is paramount. The distinct ridged shell of the smaller dark snails is a key feature for identifying *Littorina saxatilis*.\n*   **\"Definitively\":** This word in the prompt is critical. It means we must find a species whose natural range is exclusively Atlantic, excluding any species that might be found on the Pacific coast, even as an introduced species.\n*   **Distribution Knowledge:** Answering this question relies on biological knowledge about the geographic ranges of common intertidal species. *Littorina saxatilis* fits the criteria perfectly as it is common in the North Atlantic but absent from the Pacific.\n\n<<<Littorina saxatilis>>>"
