    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair. The primary features used for sexing in Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants) include antennae length and shape, coloration of the face (clypeus), the number of abdominal segments, and the shape of the abdomen's tip.\n\n**Analysis of Pair A**\n*   **Insect Identification:** These appear to be cuckoo bees of the genus *Coelioxys*. These are cleptoparasites, meaning they lay their eggs in the nests of other bees. As parasites, they do not collect pollen, and thus females lack scopae (pollen-collecting hairs), which aligns with the question's premise.\n*   **Left Insect (A):** This individual has relatively long antennae. The abdomen tapers, but the tip is characterized by several small spines (not easily visible in this image, but a known trait), which is typical for a male *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Right Insect (A):** This individual has a distinctively long, sharply pointed, conical abdomen. This is the ovipositor sheath, a characteristic feature of female *Coelioxys*, which they use to pierce the host's nest cell to lay an egg.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair B**\n*   **Insect Identification:** These are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. Wasps do not have scopae, and both sexes feed on nectar.\n*   **Left Insect (B):** This wasp has relatively short, straight antennae. The abdomen tapers to a point, which conceals a stinger, a feature exclusive to females.\n*   **Right Insect (B):** This wasp's antennae are noticeably curled at the tips. This is a classic and reliable characteristic of male paper wasps. Their abdomen is also typically blunter at the end as they lack a stinger.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Female, Right is Male. This corresponds to option **4 (F, M)**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair C**\n*   **Insect Identification:** These are long-horned bees (tribe Eucerini). The \"without scopae on their legs\" part of the prompt might be confusing, as females in this group do have leg scopae, but the sexual dimorphism in other features is so pronounced that we can reliably determine the sex without relying on scopae. The prompt may be guiding us to use these other features.\n*   **Left Insect (C):** This bee exhibits two key features of a male long-horned bee: extremely long antennae (giving the group its common name) and a bright yellow or pale clypeus (the \"face\" plate above the jaws).\n*   **Right Insect (C):** This bee, in contrast, has much shorter antennae. Its face is dark, lacking the prominent yellow clypeus of the male. These are definitive characteristics of a female in this group.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Final Compilation:**\n*   Pair A: Male, Female -> Index 3\n*   Pair B: Female, Male -> Index 4\n*   Pair C: Male, Female -> Index 3\n\nCombining the indices for A, B, and C gives the final answer.\n\n<<<3, 4, 3>>>"
