    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the cutoff frequency ($\\omega_c$ or $f_c$) of the circuit at node $a_0$. The circuit is configured as a low-pass filter, where the output is the voltage across the capacitor $C$.\n\n2.  **Cutoff Frequency Definition:** For a first-order low-pass filter, the angular cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$ is given by the formula:\n    $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\n    where $R_{th}$ is the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor $C$, and $C$ is the capacitance. The cutoff frequency in Hertz is $f_c = \\omega_c / (2\\pi)$. We will determine the angular frequency $\\omega_c$.\n\n3.  **Find the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$):**\n    To find $R_{th}$, we need to calculate the equivalent resistance of the network looking into the terminals where the capacitor is connected (node $a_0$ and ground), with all independent sources turned off.\n    *   The independent source is the input signal \"IN\" at node $c_0$. Turning it off means we ground node $c_0$.\n    *   The capacitor $C$ is disconnected, and we calculate the resistance between node $a_0$ and ground.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Resistor Network for $R_{th}$:**\n    Looking into the network from node $a_0$, we see a resistor $r$ connected in series with the rest of the network at node $d_1$. So, the Thevenin resistance is:\n    $R_{th} = r + R_{d1 \\to gnd}$\n    where $R_{d1 \\to gnd}$ is the equivalent resistance of the infinite ladder network as seen from node $d_1$ with respect to ground, given that $c_0$ is grounded.\n\n5.  **Calculate $R_{d1 \\to gnd}$ using Difference Equations:**\n    To find $R_{d1 \\to gnd}$, we can imagine injecting a test current $I_1$ into node $d_1$ and calculating the resulting voltage $V_{d1}$. The resistance will be $R_{d1 \\to gnd} = V_{d1} / I_1$.\n    Let $V_{cn}$ and $V_{dn}$ be the voltages at nodes $c_n$ and $d_n$ respectively. The network is an infinite ladder for $n \\ge 1$. For any node with index $n \\ge 2$, Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) gives a pair of coupled linear difference equations:\n    *   At node $c_n$: $(V_{c,n-1} - V_{cn})/r + (V_{d,n} - V_{cn})/r + (V_{c,n+1} - V_{cn})/r = 0 \\implies V_{c,n+1} - 3V_{cn} + V_{c,n-1} + V_{dn} = 0$\n    *   At node $d_n$: $(V_{d,n-1} - V_{dn})/r + (V_{c,n} - V_{dn})/r + (V_{d,n+1} - V_{dn})/r = 0 \\implies V_{d,n+1} - 3V_{dn} + V_{d,n-1} + V_{cn} = 0$\n\n6.  **Solve the Difference Equations:**\n    We solve these equations by decomposing the voltages into symmetric ($S_n = V_{cn} + V_{dn}$) and anti-symmetric ($D_n = V_{cn} - V_{dn}$) components.\n    *   Summing the two equations yields: $S_{n+1} - 2S_n + S_{n-1} = 0$.\n    *   Subtracting the second from the first yields: $D_{n+1} - 4D_n + D_{n-1} = 0$.\n    The solutions must decay as $n \\to \\infty$ (since current is injected locally).\n    *   The decaying solution for $S_n$ is a constant, $S_n = A$.\n    *   The characteristic equation for $D_n$ is $\\lambda^2 - 4\\lambda + 1 = 0$, with roots $\\lambda = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}$. The decaying solution corresponds to $\\lambda = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$. Let's denote $\\beta' = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$. So, $D_n = C(\\beta')^n$.\n    Combining these, we get the general form of the voltages for $n \\ge 1$:\n    $V_{cn} = (S_n + D_n)/2 = (A + C(\\beta')^n)/2$\n    $V_{dn} = (S_n - D_n)/2 = (A - C(\\beta')^n)/2$\n\n7.  **Apply Boundary Conditions:**\n    We use the conditions at the start of the ladder ($n=1$) and at the grounded node $c_0$ to find the constants $A$ and $C$.\n    *   **KCL at node $c_1$**: The node is connected to $c_0$, $d_1$, and $c_2$. The equation is $(V_{c0}-V_{c1})/r + (V_{d1}-V_{c1})/r + (V_{c2}-V_{c1})/r = 0$. With $V_{c0}=0$, this becomes $-3V_{c1} + V_{d1} + V_{c2} = 0$. Substituting the general solutions for $V_{c1}, V_{d1}, V_{c2}$ into this equation leads to the relation $A = -C$.\n    *   **KCL at node $d_1$**: This is where we inject the test current $I_1$. The current flows towards $c_1$ and $d_2$.\n        $I_1 = (V_{d1} - V_{c1})/r + (V_{d1} - V_{d2})/r$.\n        We substitute the expressions for the voltages, using $A = -C$:\n        $V_{d1} - V_{c1} = D_1 = C\\beta'$. No, $V_{d1}-V_{c1} = -D_1 = -C\\beta'$.\n        $V_{d1} - V_{d2} = (A-C\\beta')/2 - (A-C(\\beta')^2)/2 = C/2((\\beta')^2 - \\beta')$.\n        $I_1 r = -C\\beta' + C/2((\\beta')^2 - \\beta')$. Using $(\\beta')^2 = 4\\beta'-1$, we simplify this to $I_1 = \\frac{C}{2r}(\\beta' - 1)$.\n    *   **Calculate $V_{d1}$**: $V_{d1} = (A-C\\beta')/2 = (-C-C\\beta')/2 = -C(1+\\beta')/2$.\n\n8.  **Determine Resistances and Final Answer:**\n    Now we can calculate $R_{d1 \\to gnd}$:\n    $R_{d1 \\to gnd} = \\frac{V_{d1}}{I_1} = \\frac{-C(1+\\beta')/2}{C(\\beta' - 1)/(2r)} = -r \\frac{1+\\beta'}{\\beta'-1} = r \\frac{1+2-\\sqrt{3}}{1-(2-\\sqrt{3})} = r \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}-1} = r \\frac{\\sqrt{3}(\\sqrt{3}-1)}{\\sqrt{3}-1} = r\\sqrt{3}$.\n    So, $R_{d1 \\to gnd} = r\\sqrt{3}$.\n\n    Next, we find the total Thevenin resistance at node $a_0$:\n    $R_{th} = r + R_{d1 \\to gnd} = r + r\\sqrt{3} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$.\n\n    Finally, we find the cutoff frequency:\n    $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$."
