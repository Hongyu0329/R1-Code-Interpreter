The image displays a microorganism with two distinct morphologies: round-to-oval budding yeast cells and elongated filaments known as pseudohyphae (characterized by constrictions at the cellular junctions). This dimorphic presentation is characteristic of a fungus, specifically of the genus *Candida*, such as *Candida albicans*.
