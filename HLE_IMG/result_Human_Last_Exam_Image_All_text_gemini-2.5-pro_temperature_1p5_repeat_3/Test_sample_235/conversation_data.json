    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the erasure poem's metric pattern.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the textual elements of the poem.**\nThe artwork is a collage or erasure poem, where words are selected and arranged on a background. To analyze its meter, we must first identify all the words that constitute the poem.\nThe most prominent words are the ones physically cut out and pasted onto the image:\n*   \"rules\"\n*   \"and\"\n*   \"lines,\"\n*   \"an intricate spider's web\"\n*   \"work\"\n\nHowever, the background itself is a page from a book, and the artist has chosen to leave certain parts of it visible. These are also part of the composition and should be considered part of the poem. These elements are:\n*   \"THE FIRST STEP\" (the title at the top of the page)\n*   \"35\" (the page number)\n\n**Step 2: Assemble the poem and count the syllables.**\nTo check for a metric pattern, we should read the words in a logical order, typically top-to-bottom, and form a single line or sentence. When doing so, the number \"35\" would be read aloud as \"thirty-five\".\n\nLet's assemble the line:\n\"The first step thirty-five rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work.\"\n\nNow, let's count the syllables in this complete line:\n*   \"The first step\" = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 syllables\n*   \"thirty-five\" = thir-ty-five = 2 + 1 = 3 syllables\n*   \"rules\" = 1 syllable\n*   \"and\" = 1 syllable\n*   \"lines,\" = 1 syllable\n*   \"an intricate spider's web\" = an (1) + in-tri-cate (3) + spi-der's (2) + web (1) = 7 syllables\n*   \"work\" = 1 syllable\n\nTotal syllable count = 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 + 1 = **17 syllables**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the answer choices based on the syllable count.**\nNow we evaluate the given metric patterns:\n*   **A. free verse:** Poetry without a regular meter or fixed form. Since we've found a very specific structure (a 17-syllable line), this is unlikely to be the best answer.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter:** A line of 10 syllables with a specific rhythm (five iambs). This poem has 17 syllables. Incorrect.\n*   **C. alexandrine:** A line of 12 syllables. This poem has 17 syllables. Incorrect.\n*   **D. sapphic:** A specific stanza form involving multiple lines of 11 and 5 syllables. This is a single line, not a stanza. Incorrect.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** A line of roughly 6 syllables (three iambs). This poem has 17 syllables. Incorrect.\n*   **F. american sentence:** A form invented by poet Allen Ginsberg, defined as a single sentence comprising exactly **17 syllables**.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the analysis.**\nThe poem, when all its textual elements are included, forms a single line of exactly 17 syllables. This perfectly matches the definition of an American Sentence. The slightly unconventional grammar is common in this type of experimental poetry, where the primary constraint is the syllable count.\n\nTherefore, the metric pattern the words follow is the American Sentence.\n\n<<<F>>>"
