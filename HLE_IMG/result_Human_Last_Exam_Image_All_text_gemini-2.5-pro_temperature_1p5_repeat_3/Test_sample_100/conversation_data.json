    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and its molecular formula.**\n*   The starting material is a bicyclic compound containing a lactam (a cyclic amide).\n*   Let's identify the different parts of the molecule and count the atoms.\n    *   **The bicyclic core:** It's a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one skeleton. This core structure consists of 6 carbons, 5 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, and 1 oxygen. Let's verify this count: C1(CH), N2(N), C3(C=O), C4(CH), C5(CH)=C6(C), C7(CH2). Total: 6 C, 1+1+1+2=5 H, 1 N, 1 O. This skeleton has the formula C₆H₅NO.\n    *   **Substituents:**\n        *   A trifluoromethyl group (-CF₃) is attached to C6. It adds 1 Carbon and 3 Fluorine atoms (CF₃).\n        *   A para-methoxybenzyl group (PMB) is attached to the nitrogen (N2). The PMB group is -CH₂-C₆H₄-OCH₃. It consists of a methylene bridge (-CH₂-), a benzene ring (-C₆H₄-), and a methoxy group (-OCH₃). Let's count atoms in the PMB group:\n            *   Carbons: 1 (in CH₂) + 6 (in C₆H₄) + 1 (in CH₃) = 8 C\n            *   Hydrogens: 2 (in CH₂) + 4 (in C₆H₄) + 3 (in CH₃) = 9 H\n            *   Oxygens: 1 (in OCH₃) = 1 O\n    *   **Total molecular formula of the starting material:**\n        *   C = 6 (core) + 1 (from CF₃) + 8 (from PMB) = 15 C\n        *   H = 5 (core) + 9 (from PMB) = 14 H\n        *   F = 3 (from CF₃) = 3 F\n        *   N = 1 (core) = 1 N\n        *   O = 1 (core) + 1 (from PMB) = 2 O\n    *   So, the molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction to determine the structure and formula of Intermediate 1.**\n*   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H₂O.\n*   **Reaction Type:** CAN is a strong oxidizing agent commonly used for the oxidative deprotection of para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) groups from alcohols and amines. The PMB group is removed from the nitrogen atom.\n*   **Transformation:** The N-PMB bond is cleaved, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen, forming an N-H bond. The PMB group is converted to p-anisaldehyde.\n*   **Change in Formula:**\n    *   We remove the PMB group (-C₈H₉O).\n    *   We add one hydrogen atom (+H).\n    *   Net change: -C₈H₈O.\n*   **Molecular formula of Intermediate 1:**\n    *   C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂ - C₈H₈O = **C₇H₆F₃NO**.\n    *   Intermediate 1 is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction to determine the structure and formula of Intermediate 2.**\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H₂ in MeOH.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction reduces carbon-carbon double bonds.\n*   **Transformation:** The C=C double bond in the bicyclic ring (between C5 and C6) is reduced to a C-C single bond by the addition of two hydrogen atoms (H₂). The lactam and CF₃ groups are unaffected under these conditions.\n*   **Change in Formula:** We add one molecule of hydrogen (H₂).\n*   **Molecular formula of Intermediate 2:**\n    *   C₇H₆F₃NO + H₂ = **C₇H₈F₃NO**.\n    *   Intermediate 2 is the saturated lactam, 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third reaction to determine the structure and formula of the final Product.**\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 °C.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. These are harsh conditions (strong acid and heat) that cause the hydrolysis of the amide bond in the lactam.\n*   **Transformation:** The lactam ring is opened by the addition of a water molecule (H₂O) across the amide (N-C=O) bond. The C-N bond cleaves. The carbonyl carbon (C3) becomes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The nitrogen atom (N2) becomes an amino group (-NH₂), which will be protonated to -NH₃⁺ under the acidic conditions. For determining the molecular formula of the neutral molecule, we consider the addition of H₂O.\n*   **Change in Formula:** We add one molecule of water (H₂O).\n*   **Molecular formula of the final Product:**\n    *   C₇H₈F₃NO + H₂O = **C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂**.\n    *   The product is an amino acid with a cyclopentane core structure, specifically 4-amino-2-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid. Let's quickly verify the atom count in this structure: 1 C (COOH) + 5 C (ring) + 1 C (CF₃) = 7 C. 2 O (COOH). 3 F (CF₃). 1 N (NH₂). 1 H (COOH) + 2 H (NH₂) + 1H(C-COOH) + 1H(C-NH₂) + 2H(CH₂) + 2H(CH₂) + 1H(CH-CF₃) = 10 H. The formula is correct.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation Summary:**\n*   Starting Material: C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂\n*   After Step 1 (-C₈H₈O): C₇H₆F₃NO (Intermediate 1)\n*   After Step 2 (+H₂): C₇H₈F₃NO (Intermediate 2)\n*   After Step 3 (+H₂O): C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂ (Final Product)\n\nThe molecular formula of the product is C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
