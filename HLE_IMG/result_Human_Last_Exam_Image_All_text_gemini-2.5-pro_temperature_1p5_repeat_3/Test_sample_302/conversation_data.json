    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the characters on the seal:\n\n**Analysis of the Request:**\nThe user wants to know the content of the characters on the seal, written in simplified Chinese. To do this, I need to identify the characters in their original script, understand their reading order, and then convert them to modern simplified Chinese.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Script and Reading Direction:** The characters are carved in an ancient Chinese script known as seal script (篆书, zhuànshū). The image shows the physical seal, not a stamped impression. This means the characters are reversed, like in a mirror. The standard reading order for a four-character Chinese seal is from top to bottom, and from right to left. So we will read the characters in this sequence: 1. top right, 2. bottom right, 3. top left, 4. bottom left.\n\n2.  **Identify the Character at Top Right:** This character is the mirrored form of **長** (cháng). Its simplified form is **长**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Character at Bottom Right:** This character is the mirrored form of **樂** (lè), which means \"joy\" or \"happiness\". Its simplified form is **乐**. The structure, though highly stylized, is recognizable as this character in seal script.\n\n4.  **Identify the Character at Top Left:** This character is the mirrored form of **未** (wèi), which can mean \"not yet\" or \"in the future\". The character is the same in both traditional and simplified Chinese.\n\n5.  **Identify the Character at Bottom Left:** This character is the mirrored form of **央** (yāng), which means \"center\" or \"end\". In this context, it means \"end\". The character is the same in both traditional and simplified Chinese.\n\n6.  **Combine and Interpret the Characters:** Putting the characters together in the correct reading order (長, 樂, 未, 央), we get the well-known ancient phrase **長樂未央** (cháng lè wèi yāng).\n\n7.  **Final Conversion to Simplified Chinese:**\n    *   長 -> **长**\n    *   樂 -> **乐**\n    *   未 -> **未**\n    *   央 -> **央**\n    The full phrase in simplified Chinese is **长乐未央**. This is a classical idiom meaning \"eternal joy without end\".\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Mirror Image:** It is crucial to remember that the image is of the seal itself, so the characters are reversed.\n*   **Seal Script:** The characters are highly stylized, so identification requires familiarity with seal script or comparison with references.\n*   **Reading Order:** The traditional right-to-left, top-to-bottom reading order must be applied to make sense of the phrase.\n*   **Context:** Recognizing that \"长乐未央\" is a very common and auspicious phrase helps confirm the identification of individual characters.\n\n<<<长乐未央>>>"
