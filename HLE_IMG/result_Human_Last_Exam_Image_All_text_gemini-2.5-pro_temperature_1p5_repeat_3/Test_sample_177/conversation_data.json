    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Objective:**\nCalculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) when changing from the Baseline scenario (Table 1) to the Proposed scenario (Table 2).\n\n**Key Formula:**\nPercentage Reduction = [ (Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT ] * 100\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **VMT vs. PMT:** The question asks for Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), not Person Miles Traveled (PMT). This means we are concerned with the miles the vehicle travels, regardless of the number of occupants. Therefore, the \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" data is not needed for this calculation.\n2.  **Car Modes:** To find the total car VMT, we must sum the contributions from both car modes: \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n3.  **Weighted Calculation:** The total VMT is a weighted sum. We cannot simply average the percentages. We must calculate the VMT for each trip distance category and then sum them up. The VMT for each category is determined by the share of total trips in that category, the mode share for cars within that category, and the average distance for that category.\n4.  **VMT Index:** Since the absolute number of trips is not given, we will calculate a VMT Index which is directly proportional to the actual VMT. This is done by using the percentages provided in the tables. The formula for the VMT Index contribution from each distance category is:\n    `(Share of Total Trips) × (Total Car Mode Share for that category) × (Average Trip Distance)`\n\n---\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Baseline Car VMT Index (from Table 1)**\n\nFirst, we calculate the total car mode share for each distance category in the Baseline scenario.\n*   **0-3 miles:** 25% + 28% = 53%\n*   **3-5 miles:** 38% + 43% = 81%\n*   **5-10 miles:** 40% + 45% = 85%\n*   **10+ miles:** 42% + 47% = 89%\n\nNext, we calculate the VMT Index for each category and sum them.\n*   **0-3 miles VMT:** 0.48 (share of trips) × 0.53 (car share) × 1 (avg distance) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles VMT:** 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles VMT:** 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles VMT:** 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = 2.8480\n\n**Total Baseline VMT Index** = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Proposed Car VMT Index (from Table 2)**\n\nSimilarly, we calculate the total car mode share for each distance category in the Proposed scenario.\n*   **0-3 miles:** 1% + 2% = 3%\n*   **3-5 miles:** 8% + 19% = 27%\n*   **5-10 miles:** 14% + 27% = 41%\n*   **10+ miles:** 16% + 33% = 49%\n\nNext, we calculate the VMT Index for each category and sum them.\n*   **0-3 miles VMT:** 0.48 (share of trips) × 0.03 (car share) × 1 (avg distance) = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles VMT:** 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles VMT:** 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles VMT:** 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = 1.5680\n\n**Total Proposed VMT Index** = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction in Car VMT**\n\nNow, we use the results from Step 1 and Step 2 to find the percentage reduction.\n*   **VMT Reduction** = Baseline VMT Index - Proposed VMT Index\n    *   = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT Index) × 100\n    *   = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100\n    *   = 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
