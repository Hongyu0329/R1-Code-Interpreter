    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find all the splice species from the provided RT-PCR results.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe goal is to identify the total number of unique mRNA splice variants (species) detected by the various RT-PCR experiments shown in the image. A splice species is a unique mRNA molecule formed by a specific pattern of splicing. We can identify these by looking for unique bands in the gel electrophoresis results, making sure not to double-count the same species when it's detected by different primer pairs.\n\n**2. Analyze each RT-PCR panel:**\n\n*   **Panel B (Primer pair: E1F1/E4R):**\n    *   This experiment shows two distinct bands: band 1 (190 bp) and band 2 (159 bp).\n    *   This indicates the existence of at least **two** different splice species in this region. We'll call them Species 1 and Species 2.\n\n*   **Panel C (Primer pair: E1F1/E5R):**\n    *   This experiment also shows two bands: band 1 (584 bp) and band 2 (553 bp).\n    *   The reverse primer E5R is downstream of E4R. The size difference between the bands in this panel is 584 - 553 = 31 bp. The size difference in panel B is 190 - 159 = 31 bp.\n    *   This consistency indicates that panel C is detecting the same two species (Species 1 and 2) as panel B, just with a different reverse primer resulting in longer products. This confirms the existence of Species 1 and 2 but does not add new ones.\n\n*   **Panel D (Primer pair: E1F2/E5R):**\n    *   This experiment shows one major band of 551 bp.\n    *   The primer E1F2 is a special \"splice-junction\" primer that only amplifies transcripts with a specific splice from nucleotide 929 to 3465.\n    *   Since this PCR selects for a specific splice event not guaranteed in Species 1 or 2, this 551 bp product represents a **third** distinct species (Species 3).\n\n*   **Panel E (Primer pair: E1F1/L2R):**\n    *   This experiment shows one band of 1,005 bp.\n    *   We can check if this band corresponds to an already identified species. Let's compare Species 1 (detected with E1F1) and Species 3 (detected with E1F2). For the region amplified by E5R, the E1F1-product (584 bp, from C1) is 33 bp longer than the E1F2-product (551 bp, from D). This 33 bp likely represents the part of the E1 exon that is spliced out in Species 3.\n    *   Now, let's apply this logic to the L2R primer. The E1F2/L2R product (from panel F, see below) is 972 bp. If the band in panel E corresponds to the E1F1 amplification of the same transcript, its size should be 972 bp + 33 bp = 1005 bp.\n    *   This matches the band size in panel E exactly. Therefore, this band represents Species 1 amplified with a different primer pair. It does not represent a new species.\n\n*   **Panel F (Primer pair: E1F2/L2R):**\n    *   This experiment shows one band of 972 bp.\n    *   This is the same splice-junction primer (E1F2) as in panel D, but with a different reverse primer (L2R). This band confirms the existence of Species 3 but is not a new species.\n\n*   **Panel G (Primer pair: E1F3/L2R):**\n    *   This experiment shows two bands: band 1 (1,003 bp) and band 2 (931 bp).\n    *   The primer E1F3 is specific for a different splice junction (929^3506) than E1F2. Therefore, any products from this reaction represent new species.\n    *   The two distinct bands indicate that after the initial 929^3506 splice, there is further alternative splicing downstream.\n    *   This adds **two new species**: Species 4 (giving the 1,003 bp product) and Species 5 (giving the 931 bp product).\n    *   Total so far: 3 + 2 = 5 species.\n\n*   **Panels H and I (Primer pair: E1F1/L1R):**\n    *   These primers span a large portion of the genome map (from E1 to L1). The resulting products are very small, which indicates that large intervening regions (like E2, E4, E5, L2) have been spliced out. This represents a fundamentally different class of transcripts (likely \"late\" transcripts).\n    *   Panel I, with more PCR cycles, provides the clearer picture, showing four distinct bands.\n    *   The sizes are: band 1 (450 bp), band 2 (419 bp), band 3 (378 bp), and band 4 (187 bp).\n    *   These four distinct products must originate from four different splicing patterns. These are all different from the species identified in panels B-G.\n    *   This adds **four new species**: Species 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n    *   Total so far: 5 + 4 = 9 species.\n\n**3. Final Tally of Unique Splice Species:**\n\n1.  **Species 1:** Detected in B (190 bp), C (584 bp), and E (1,005 bp). Unspliced at the 929 donor site.\n2.  **Species 2:** Detected in B (159 bp) and C (553 bp). Also unspliced at the 929 donor site but has a different downstream splice pattern from Species 1.\n3.  **Species 3:** Detected in D (551 bp) and F (972 bp). Defined by the 929^3465 splice.\n4.  **Species 4:** Detected in G (1,003 bp). Defined by the 929^3506 splice.\n5.  **Species 5:** Detected in G (931 bp). Also has the 929^3506 splice but with a different downstream splice pattern from Species 4.\n6.  **Species 6:** Detected in I (450 bp). Represents a major splice from E1 to L1.\n7.  **Species 7:** Detected in I (419 bp). A different E1-to-L1 splice variant.\n8.  **Species 8:** Detected in I (378 bp). A third E1-to-L1 splice variant.\n9.  **Species 9:** Detected in I (187 bp). A fourth E1-to-L1 splice variant.\n\nTotal Number of Splice Species = 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
