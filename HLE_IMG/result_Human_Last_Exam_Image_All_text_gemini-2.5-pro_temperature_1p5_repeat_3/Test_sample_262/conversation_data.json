    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks to identify which of the four Iridium(III) complexes, when used as emitters in Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs), are expected to have shorter operational lifetimes. The lifetime of an LEC is primarily limited by the chemical and electrochemical stability of the emitter complex.\n\n2.  **Analyze the General Structure of the Complexes:**\n    *   All four complexes are cationic Iridium(III) complexes with the general formula `[Ir(C^N)₂(N^N)]⁺PF₆⁻`.\n    *   The central metal is Iridium(III).\n    *   There are three bidentate ligands. Two are cyclometalating ligands (`C^N`), and one is a diimine ligand (`N^N`).\n    *   The `N^N` ligand is the same in all four complexes: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. This ligand is generally stable.\n    *   The difference between the four complexes lies in the substitution pattern on the phenyl ring of the two `C^N` ligands, which are derivatives of 2-phenylpyridine (ppy).\n\n3.  **Identify the Specific `C^N` Ligands:**\n    *   **Complex 1:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has two fluorine atoms per ligand.\n    *   **Complex 2:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has one fluorine atom at the para-position of the phenyl ring.\n    *   **Complex 3:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has one fluorine atom at the ortho-position of the phenyl ring.\n    *   **Complex 4:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-phenylpyridine (ppy). It has no substituents on the phenyl ring.\n\n4.  **Relate Ligand Structure to Complex Stability and Lifetime:**\n    *   The stability of these types of Ir(III) complexes is a major factor determining their lifetime in a device. A primary degradation pathway is the cleavage of the Ir-C bond, which is generally the weakest bond in the coordination sphere.\n    *   Another critical factor is the presence of reactive sites on the ligands, such as C-H bonds, particularly those close to the metal center.\n    *   Fluorination of the phenyl ring of the ppy ligand is a well-established strategy to enhance the stability of the complex.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Effect of Fluorine Substitution:**\n    *   **Electronic Effect:** Fluorine is a strongly electron-withdrawing atom. Its presence on the phenyl ring pulls electron density away from the ring and the carbon atom bonded to the iridium. This strengthens the Ir-C bond, making the complex more resistant to degradation and thus increasing its lifetime.\n    *   **Steric/Blocking Effect:** Placing a substituent at a position ortho to the Ir-C bond (the 2'-position of the phenyl ring) can protect a kinetically labile site. A C-H bond at this position can be a point of attack for degradation reactions. Replacing it with a very strong and inert C-F bond blocks this degradation pathway.\n\n6.  **Apply these Principles to the Four Complexes:**\n    *   **Complex 4 (Unsubstituted):** This complex has no fluorine atoms. The Ir-C bond is not electronically strengthened, and the ortho-position has a relatively reactive C-H bond. Therefore, Complex 4 is expected to be the least stable and have the shortest lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 2 (para-Fluoro):** This complex has a fluorine atom at the para-position. This strengthens the Ir-C bond through an inductive effect, making it more stable than Complex 4. However, it still possesses a C-H bond at the vulnerable ortho-position.\n    *   **Complex 3 (ortho-Fluoro):** This complex has a fluorine atom at the ortho-position. This provides two benefits: a strong inductive effect to strengthen the Ir-C bond and the replacement of the vulnerable ortho-C-H bond with a robust C-F bond. This is expected to make Complex 3 significantly more stable than Complexes 2 and 4.\n    *   **Complex 1 (ortho,para-di-Fluoro):** This complex has fluorines at both ortho and para positions. It benefits from both the strong inductive strengthening from two fluorines and the protection of the ortho-site. This complex is expected to be the most stable of the four and have the longest lifetime.\n\n7.  **Synthesize the Conclusion:**\n    *   The stability (and thus lifetime) of the complexes is significantly enhanced by the presence of a fluorine atom at the ortho-position of the phenylpyridine ligand.\n    *   Complexes 1 and 3 both contain this stabilizing ortho-fluorine. They are expected to have longer lifetimes.\n    *   Complexes 2 and 4 lack this ortho-fluorine protection. They are therefore more susceptible to degradation.\n    *   Consequently, Complexes 2 and 4 are expected to show shorter lifetimes compared to Complexes 1 and 3.\n\n8.  **Match with Answer Choices:**\n    *   The analysis indicates that complexes [2] and [4] are the ones with shorter lifetimes.\n    *   This corresponds to answer choice I.\n\n<<<I>>>"
