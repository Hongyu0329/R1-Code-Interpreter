    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the musical piece:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the General Characteristics of the Sheet Music**\n*   **Instrumentation:** The music is written for piano, indicated by the grand staff (treble and bass clefs joined by a brace).\n*   **Tempo:** The tempo marking is a quarter note = 80 (♩ = 80). This is a moderate tempo, often described as *Andante* or *Adagio*.\n*   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4 (common time), meaning four quarter-note beats per measure.\n*   **Key Signature:** The key signature shows no sharps or flats, which would typically indicate C major or A minor. However, the piece is filled with accidentals (sharps, flats, and naturals).\n*   **Dynamics:** There are significant and abrupt changes in dynamics. The piece begins *p* (piano, soft), then suddenly jumps to *f* (forte, loud) in measure 3. Later, there are markings for *mp* (mezzo-piano, moderately soft) and *mf* (mezzo-forte, moderately loud). This wide dynamic range is characteristic of Romantic music.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Musical Style and Content**\n*   **Measure 1-2:** The piece opens with a quiet, lyrical melody in the right hand (G-Eb-F-G-Ab-G-F-Eb) over a C minor chord in the left hand. This establishes a somber, melancholic mood in the key of C minor.\n*   **Measure 3:** There is a sudden, dramatic shift. The dynamic becomes forte, and the texture changes completely. The right hand plays rapid, ascending sixteenth-note arpeggios (G-Ab-B-C, D-Eb-F#-G), while the left hand plays powerful, driving broken octaves. This creates a feeling of great agitation and turmoil.\n*   **Measures 4-6:** The highly virtuosic writing continues. The right hand plays complex, fast-moving arpeggios, while the left hand plays solid, block chords that shift harmonically. The level of technical difficulty is extremely high, requiring great speed, power, and dexterity.\n*   **Measures 8-10:** This section features thick, powerful chords in both hands, played *mf*, creating a massive, relentless sound. This passage requires significant hand strength and stretching ability.\n*   **Measure 11:** A very fast, upward-sweeping arpeggio or scale run (indicated by the small notes and \"gliss.\" notation) leads into another powerful chordal section.\n\n**Step 3: Form a Hypothesis and Identify the Piece**\n*   **Composer Style:** The combination of a lyrical theme, sudden dramatic outbursts, extreme technical demands (virtuosity), and rich, chromatic harmony are all hallmarks of the composer Franz Liszt (1811-1886). The writing is bombastic, passionate, and designed to showcase the full capabilities of the piano and the performer.\n*   **Piece Identification:** The specific musical figures, especially the relentless driving rhythm and the 'galloping' feel of the fast sections, are strongly associated with one of Liszt's most famous and difficult works: the **Transcendental Étude No. 4 in D minor, \"Mazeppa\"**.\n*   **Verification:** While the piece as a whole is in D minor, it modulates through many different keys. The excerpt provided is not from the very beginning of the piece but from a later development section.\n    *   The quiet opening of the excerpt (measures 1-2) corresponds to a thematic variation that appears at measure 95 of the original score, which is indeed in C minor.\n    *   The explosive forte section starting at measure 3 of the excerpt matches perfectly with the technically demanding variation that begins at measure 103 of the Liszt score. The complex arpeggios and chord progressions are identical.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe piece is a well-known, highly virtuosic work from the Romantic era. Based on the stylistic elements and direct comparison of the notes, the music is from Franz Liszt's Transcendental Étude No. 4, \"Mazeppa\".\n\n<<<Franz Liszt - Transcendental Étude No. 4 \"Mazeppa\">>>"
