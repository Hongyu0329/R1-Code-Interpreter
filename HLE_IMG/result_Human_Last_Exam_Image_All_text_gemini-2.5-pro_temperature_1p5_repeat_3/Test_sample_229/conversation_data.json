    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Examine the Music Notation:** The provided image is a lead sheet, which contains the melody line on a treble clef staff along with chord symbols written above it. This format is common in jazz, pop, and Latin music.\n2.  **Analyze the Key and Time Signature:**\n    *   The key signature has no sharps or flats, indicating the key of C major or its relative minor, A minor. The piece frequently uses the C major chord as a point of resolution and ends on a C major chord in the Coda, which strongly suggests the key is **C major**.\n    *   The time signature is 4/4, also known as common time.\n3.  **Analyze the Melody and Rhythm:**\n    *   The melody is highly syncopated, featuring many eighth notes, sixteenth notes, and rests on the downbeats. This creates a driving, lively rhythmic feel.\n    *   The first few notes of the melody (after the two-eighth-note pickup G-G) are C, E, G, followed by a passage over the E7 chord (A, G#, A, F#) and the F chord (G, B, D). This melodic line is very distinctive.\n4.  **Analyze the Harmony (Chord Progression):**\n    *   The chord progression starts with `C | E7 | F | G7 |`. This progression is characteristic of many popular songs. The `E7` chord is a secondary dominant, which typically resolves to A minor. Here, it is used to create tension before moving to the F chord, a common device in Latin American music. The `F#dim7` chord appearing in some bars acts as a leading-tone chord to G7, further adding to the harmonic interest. The progression has a clear \"Latin\" or \"Tango\" feel.\n5.  **Identify the Song:**\n    *   The combination of the iconic syncopated melody and the underlying chord progression allows for identification. This melody is instantly recognizable as the main theme from **\"Tico-Tico no Fub치\"**.\n6.  **Determine the Musical Style and Origin:**\n    *   **Musical Style:** \"Tico-Tico no Fub치\" is one of the most famous examples of **Choro**, a Brazilian popular music genre known for its fast tempo, virtuosity, and syncopated rhythms. It's an instrumental piece that predates Samba and Bossa Nova but shares rhythmic roots with them. It can also be broadly classified as Brazilian music or Latin music.\n    *   **Country of Origin:** The composer, Zequinha de Abreu, was Brazilian, and the song was composed in Brazil in 1917. Therefore, the country of origin is **Brazil**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The score is handwritten, which can sometimes make notes and symbols difficult to read, but the core musical information is clear.\n*   The title of the song is not written on the sheet music, so identification relies solely on analyzing the musical content (melody, harmony, rhythm).\n*   The tempo marking \"q=128\" indicates a moderately fast tempo (128 beats per minute), which is appropriate for a Choro piece.\n*   The structure includes repeat signs, a D.S. al Coda instruction (\"TO GO OUT - TAKE D.S. TO CODA\"), confirming it's a piece with a standard song form intended for performance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the melody, rhythm, and harmony presented in the lead sheet, the song is identified as \"Tico-Tico no Fub치,\" a famous Choro piece from Brazil.\n\n<<<Title: Tico-Tico no Fub치\nMusical Style: Choro (Brazilian music)\nCountry of Origin: Brazil>>>"
