    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the country based on the Google Trends graph.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Overall Graph Structure:**\n    *   The chart displays the relative search interest for three different topics (represented by the red, yellow, and blue lines) over a period from late 2019 to mid-2023.\n    *   The most significant feature is the presence of sharp, recurring peaks for all three lines. This cyclical pattern strongly suggests that the search terms are related to annual events, such as holidays, festivals, or anniversaries of historical events.\n    *   The prompt states these are three historic events from a single country, so our task is to identify a country whose national commemorations match these annual search patterns.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Yellow Line:**\n    *   **Observation:** The yellow line shows a very sharp and high peak every year around the end of May or the very beginning of June. In 2023, this peak is the highest point on the entire chart (reaching 100) and occurs just before the date marker \"May 28, 2023\".\n    *   **Hypothesis:** This timing corresponds perfectly with **Memorial Day** in the United States, which falls on the last Monday of May. This is a major federal holiday commemorating military personnel who died in service. For example, in 2023, Memorial Day was on May 29th. This is a very strong piece of evidence pointing to the USA.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Red Line:**\n    *   **Observation:** The red line has its most prominent peak early in the year, specifically in late January. This is a consistent, large spike across every year shown on the graph (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023).\n    *   **Hypothesis:** This timing aligns with **Martin Luther King Jr. Day**, a US federal holiday observed on the third Monday of January. It honors the life and legacy of the civil rights leader. The proximity to the start of Black History Month (February) in the US could also contribute to the sustained interest seen in the red line during this period.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Blue Line:**\n    *   **Observation:** The blue line shows smaller, but regular, peaks. The most telling feature is a change in its pattern. There is a small peak in mid-June each year, but this peak becomes significantly more pronounced from the year 2021 onwards.\n    *   **Hypothesis:** This pattern matches the search interest for **Juneteenth**. Juneteenth, which commemorates the end of slavery in the United States on June 19th, was officially declared a federal holiday on June 17, 2021. It is logical that public search interest would spike upon its federal recognition in 2021 and remain higher in subsequent years as a new national holiday, which is exactly what the blue line shows.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Consistency:** The yearly timing of the peaks for MLK Day (red line) and Memorial Day (yellow line) are consistent with the US calendar.\n*   **Unique Pattern Change:** The change in the blue line's peak height in 2021 is a critical clue. It points directly to an event that gained national prominence in that specific year, which fits the story of Juneteenth becoming a federal holiday.\n*   **Synthesis:** All three events—Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Memorial Day, and Juneteenth—are significant historical commemorations unique to the **United States**. The evidence from all three trend lines converges on this single country. A historian would readily recognize the timing of these major American holidays and the recent establishment of Juneteenth.\n\nTherefore, the country in question is the United States.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
