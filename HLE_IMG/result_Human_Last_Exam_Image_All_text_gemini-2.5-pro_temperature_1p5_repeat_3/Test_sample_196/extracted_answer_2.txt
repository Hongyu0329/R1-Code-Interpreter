1. **[6π+4π]**: One molecule acts as a 6π component (using the C2 to C6 π system), and the other as a 4π component (using the C2 to C5 diene system).
2. **[4π+6π]**: The reverse of the first description, as the reaction is a dimerization of identical molecules.
3. **[8π+2π]**: An alternative description where one molecule utilizes its entire 8π conjugated system, reacting with a 2π component of the second molecule.
4. **[2π+8π]**: The reverse of the third description.
