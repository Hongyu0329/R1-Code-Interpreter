    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens.\n\n**Careful Points for Rock Identification:**\n\n1.  **Texture:** Observe the size, shape, and arrangement of the grains or crystals.\n    *   **Grain Size:** Are the grains too small to see (fine-grained/aphanitic), or are they visible (coarse-grained/phaneritic)?\n    *   **Vesicles:** Are there holes or pores? This indicates gas was trapped during formation, typical of volcanic rocks.\n    *   **Clastic vs. Crystalline:** Is the rock made of fragments (clasts) of other rocks cemented together, or is it made of interlocking crystals?\n    *   **Clast Shape:** If clastic, are the fragments rounded (like in conglomerate) or angular (like in breccia)?\n\n2.  **Color/Composition:** Observe the overall color of the rock and the colors of individual minerals.\n    *   **Light-colored (Felsic):** Often rich in silica, quartz, and feldspar (e.g., granite, rhyolite, pumice).\n    *   **Dark-colored (Mafic):** Often rich in magnesium and iron (e.g., gabbro, basalt, scoria).\n\n3.  **Rock Type:** Based on texture and composition, determine if the rock is igneous (from cooled magma/lava), sedimentary (from cemented sediments), or metamorphic (changed by heat/pressure).\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Specimen:**\n\n**Specimen H:**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a very porous, bubbly appearance. The holes (vesicles) are quite large and numerous. The overall texture is rough and cindery.\n*   **Analysis:** The high degree of vesicularity is a clear sign of an extrusive igneous (volcanic) rock, formed when gas-rich lava cooled quickly. The reddish color is often due to the oxidation of iron. This combination of features—a cindery appearance, high vesicularity, and typically mafic to intermediate composition (indicated by the darker, reddish color)—is characteristic of **scoria**.\n\n**Specimen I:**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is composed of visible fragments of different sizes and colors (gray, white, reddish) embedded in a fine-grained, light-gray matrix. The fragments appear angular.\n*   **Analysis:** The rock is clearly clastic (made of fragments). The fragments are of volcanic origin, and the matrix is composed of consolidated volcanic ash. A rock formed from volcanic ash and larger fragments (lapilli) is known as a **tuff** (or volcanic tuff).\n\n**Specimen J:**\n*   **Observation:** This is a very light-colored (white to light gray) rock. Like specimen H, it is extremely porous and full of small vesicles, giving it a frothy or spongy texture. It appears to be very lightweight.\n*   **Analysis:** The extreme vesicularity and light color are the defining characteristics of **pumice**. Pumice is an extrusive igneous (volcanic) rock formed from gas-rich, felsic (silica-rich) lava that cooled so rapidly the gas bubbles were trapped. It is so low in density that it can often float on water.\n\n**Specimen K:**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is composed of large, easily visible fragments that are cemented together. The key feature is that these fragments are sharp and angular, not rounded.\n*   **Analysis:** A clastic rock made of large, gravel-sized fragments is either a conglomerate or a breccia. The distinction lies in the shape of the clasts. Since the clasts in specimen K are angular, the rock is a **breccia**. The angularity indicates that the fragments were not transported far from their source before being cemented together.\n\n---\n**Final Identifications:**\n\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Tuff\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Breccia\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Tuff, J: Pumice, K: Breccia>>>"
