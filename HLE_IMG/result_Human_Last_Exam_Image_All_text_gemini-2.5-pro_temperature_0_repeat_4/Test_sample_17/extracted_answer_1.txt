Theoretically, the stress at the tip of a perfectly sharp corner (a re-entrant corner with zero radius of curvature) in a loaded elastic body is infinite. This is known as a stress singularity. In reality, plastic deformation would occur, limiting the stress to the material's yield strength, but the theoretical value is infinite.
