    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Algorithm's Logic\n\nThe provided pseudocode defines a recursive function `sort(a, n)` that aims to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`.\n\nLet's break down the function `sort(a, n)`:\n1.  **Base Case:** The recursion stops when `n <= 1`. An array of size 1 or 0 is considered sorted.\n2.  **Recursive Step (if n > 1):**\n    a. `sort(a, n - 1)`: The function first calls itself to sort the subarray consisting of the first `n-1` elements (`a[0]` to `a[n-2]`).\n    b. `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: After the first `n-1` elements are sorted, it compares the last element of the current subarray (`a[n-1]`) with the second to last element (`a[n-2]`).\n    c. `swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`: If the last element is smaller than the one before it, they are swapped. This places the smaller element at index `n-2`.\n    d. `sort(a, n - 1)`: **Crucially**, if a swap occurred, the order of the first `n-1` elements might be disturbed again. For example, the newly placed element at `a[n-2]` might be smaller than `a[n-3]`. The algorithm addresses this by calling `sort(a, n - 1)` again to re-sort the entire prefix of `n-1` elements.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Recurrence Relation\n\nTo find the time complexity, we can define a recurrence relation `T(n)` that represents the number of operations for an input of size `n`.\n\n*   The work done inside the function `sort(a, n)`, excluding the recursive calls, consists of a comparison and a potential swap. This takes constant time, which we can denote as `O(1)` or `c`.\n*   There is one unconditional recursive call: `sort(a, n - 1)`. This contributes `T(n-1)` to the complexity.\n*   There is a second, conditional recursive call: `sort(a, n - 1)`. This also contributes `T(n-1)` to the complexity, but only in the case where the `if` condition is met.\n\nWe are interested in the **worst-case** time complexity. The worst case will occur when the `if` condition is true, triggering the second recursive call as often as possible.\n\nSo, the worst-case recurrence relation is:\n`T(n) = T(n-1)` (first call) `+ O(1)` (comparison/swap) `+ T(n-1)` (second call)\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n\nThe base case is `T(1) = O(1)` (or some constant `c'`), as the function does nothing when `n <= 1`.\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Recurrence Relation\n\nLet's solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c` by expansion (also known as unrolling or repeated substitution).\n\n*   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n*   Substitute `T(n-1) = 2 * T(n-2) + c`:\n    `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c = 2^2 * T(n-2) + 3c`\n*   Substitute `T(n-2) = 2 * T(n-3) + c`:\n    `T(n) = 2^2 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 3c = 2^3 * T(n-3) + 7c`\n\nWe can see a pattern emerging:\n`T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + (2^k - 1) * c`\n\nTo reach the base case `T(1)`, we set `n-k = 1`, which means `k = n-1`.\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-1) - 1) * c`\n\nSince `T(1)` is a constant, let's call it `c'`.\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c' + (2^(n-1) - 1) * c`\n\nAs `n` grows large, the dominant term is `2^(n-1)`. In Big O notation, constant factors and lower-order terms are ignored.\n`T(n) = O(2^(n-1)) = O(2^n)`\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe recurrence `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c` assumes the `if` condition is always met. Does an input exist for this?\nConsider a reverse-sorted array, for example, `a = [4, 3, 2, 1]`.\n*   `sort(a, 4)`:\n    1.  Calls `sort(a, 3)` on `[4, 3, 2]`. Let's assume this call correctly sorts the prefix, making the array `[2, 3, 4, 1]`.\n    2.  Compares `a[3]` and `a[2]`: `if 1 < 4`. This is true.\n    3.  Swaps them: `a` becomes `[2, 3, 1, 4]`.\n    4.  Calls `sort(a, 3)` again on the now unsorted prefix `[2, 3, 1]`.\nThis confirms that for a reverse-sorted input, the `if` condition will be met at each level of recursion, leading to the worst-case behavior.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe recurrence relation for the worst-case performance of this algorithm is `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + O(1)`, which solves to `O(2^n)`. This is an exponential time complexity, making the algorithm highly inefficient for anything but very small inputs.\n\nComparing this result with the given answer choices:\nA. O(n)\nB. O(n log n)\nC. O(n^2)\nD. O(n^3)\nE. O(2^n)\nF. does not terminate\n\nThe correct choice is E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
