    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the altarpiece detail.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Artwork's Visual Characteristics**\n*   **Medium and Technique:** The image shows a relief sculpture. The smooth, slightly glossy surface is characteristic of glazed terracotta, a medium famously used by a specific group of Renaissance artists.\n*   **Style:** The style is clearly that of the Italian Renaissance (Quattrocento, 15th century). The figures are rendered with naturalism, grace, and a sense of calm piety. The composition is balanced and harmonious within the circular frame (a tondo or roundel).\n*   **Subject Matter:** The scene depicts a religious sacrament. A priest is administering the Eucharist (Holy Communion) to a group of kneeling figures, including a child in the foreground. This is a common theme in Christian art.\n*   **Framing and Inscription:** The roundel is enclosed in an ornate, decorative border. At the bottom, a cartouche (a decorative scroll-like label) contains the inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This appears to be a vernacular phrase, likely Old Italian or influenced by French, meaning \"Sacraments of the Altar\".\n\n**Step 2: Connect the Characteristics to a Specific Artist or Workshop**\n*   The combination of glazed terracotta relief sculpture and the specific Florentine Renaissance style strongly points to the workshop of the Della Robbia family.\n*   Luca della Robbia (c. 1400â€“1482) was the founder of this workshop and the inventor of the technique. His work is known for its serene beauty, classical balance, and use of white and blue glazes. His nephew, Andrea della Robbia, and Andrea's sons continued the workshop, but Luca's early work has a distinct classical purity that matches the style seen here.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Specific Altarpiece**\n*   Searching for a glazed terracotta altarpiece depicting the \"Sacrament of the Eucharist\" by a Della Robbia artist leads to a specific, well-known work.\n*   This roundel is a detail from the **Tabernacle of the Eucharist** (in Italian: *Tabernacolo del Sacramento* or *Tabernacolo dell'Eucaristia*).\n*   This masterpiece was originally created for the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence and is now housed in the church of Santa Maria in Peretola, a suburb of Florence.\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the Author**\n*   Art historical records and scholarly consensus firmly attribute the Tabernacle of the Eucharist to **Luca della Robbia**. He created it between 1441 and 1443. It is considered one of his most important early works and a prime example of his innovative technique.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis of the style, medium, subject matter, and identification of the specific artwork as the Tabernacle of the Eucharist, the author is Luca della Robbia.\n\n<<<Luca della Robbia>>>"
