    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Knot**\n\n1.  **Count the crossings:** First, we examine the provided knot diagram and count the number of crossings. By careful inspection, we can identify 8 distinct crossings.\n2.  **Check for alternating property:** We trace the path of the knot. Starting from any point and following the strand, we observe that the crossings alternate between \"over\" and \"under\". For example, if we start on the outermost loop on the left and move clockwise, we pass under, then over, then under, then over, and so on, for all 8 crossings. This means the diagram is an **alternating knot diagram**.\n3.  **Identify the specific knot:** An alternating knot with 8 crossings must be one of the knots from 8₁ to 8₂₁. By comparing the given diagram with standard knot tables, such as those found in Rolfsen's \"Knots and Links\" or online resources like the Knot Atlas, we can positively identify this specific diagram as the knot **8₁₈**. This diagram is a common representation for 8₁₈. It is also known to be equivalent to the pretzel knot P(-2, 3, 3).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Rasmussen Invariant for Alternating Knots**\n\n1.  **Definition:** The Rasmussen invariant, denoted as s(K), is a powerful integer-valued invariant of a knot K that arises from a structure in knot theory called Khovanov homology.\n2.  **Key Theorem:** A crucial theorem proven by Jacob Rasmussen provides a simple way to calculate the s-invariant for alternating knots. The theorem states that for any alternating knot K, its Rasmussen invariant is equal to its classical knot signature, σ(K).\n    *   **s(K) = σ(K) for alternating knots.**\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Signature of the Knot 8₁₈**\n\n1.  **Knot Signature:** The signature, σ(K), is a classical knot invariant that can be calculated from a Seifert surface or a Goeritz matrix of the knot. The calculation can be complex and sensitive to orientation and conventions.\n2.  **Look up the known value:** Since 8₁₈ is a well-studied knot, its invariants are cataloged in standard knot theory databases. Consulting reliable sources like the KnotInfo database (maintained by J.C. Cha and C. Livingston) or the Knot Atlas, we find that the signature of the knot 8₁₈ is a known value.\n    *   **σ(8₁₈) = -2**\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Rasmussen Invariant**\n\nCombining the results from the previous steps:\n*   The knot is 8₁₈, which is an alternating knot.\n*   For alternating knots, the Rasmussen invariant equals the signature: s(8₁₈) = σ(8₁₈).\n*   The signature of 8₁₈ is -2.\n\nTherefore, the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture is -2.\n\n<<< -2 >>>"
