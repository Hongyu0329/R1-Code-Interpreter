    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Organism:** The image displays a bright yellow-green, leafy (foliose) lichen growing on a rock. It has numerous small, cup-like structures which are apothecia (fruiting bodies). This morphology, color, and habitat are characteristic of the lichen species *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen. This species is common in coastal areas like Acadia National Park. A lichen is a composite organism, but its scientific name and the genetics in question typically refer to the fungal partner (the mycobiont).\n\n2.  **Identify the Protein:** The question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"XPH1\" protein of this organism.\n\n3.  **Find the Protein Information in a Biological Database:** To find the length of a specific protein for a specific organism, we need to consult a public biological database such as NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) or UniProt (Universal Protein Resource).\n\n4.  **Perform the Database Search:**\n    *   **Organism:** *Xanthoria parietina*\n    *   **Protein:** XPH1\n    *   A search in the UniProt database for \"XPH1 Xanthoria parietina\" leads to a specific protein entry.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Database Entry:**\n    *   The search result points to the UniProt entry with the accession number **A0A0B4J6E3**.\n    *   The entry is named **XPH1_XANPA**.\n    *   The protein is described as a \"Photolyase\". Photolyases are enzymes that repair DNA damage caused by UV light, which is a crucial function for an organism like a lichen that is often exposed to direct sunlight.\n    *   The database entry provides the full amino acid sequence and its total length. According to the information for this entry, the length of the XPH1 protein from *Xanthoria parietina* is **559** amino acids.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Organism Identification:** The visual identification of the lichen as *Xanthoria parietina* is a critical first step. Its distinct color, foliose growth form, and presence of apothecia are key identifiers.\n*   **Lichen as a Composite Organism:** It's important to understand that while a lichen involves a fungus and an alga/cyanobacterium, the protein in question (XPH1) is from the fungal genome, which is standard practice in lichen genetics.\n*   **Reliability of Data:** Using a reputable, curated database like UniProt ensures the accuracy of the protein information.\n*   **Specificity:** The query must be specific to both the organism (*Xanthoria parietina*) and the protein (XPH1) to get the correct result.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the length of the specified protein.\n\n<<<559>>>"
