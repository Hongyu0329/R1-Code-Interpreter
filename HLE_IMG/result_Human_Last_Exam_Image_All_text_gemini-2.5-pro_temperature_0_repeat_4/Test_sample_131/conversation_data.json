    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the name of the given alkaloid compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the basic structural features.**\nThe molecule shown is a complex organic compound. We can observe the following key features:\n*   **Polycyclic system:** The structure is composed of four fused rings.\n*   **Heterocyclic nature:** The rings contain atoms other than carbon. Specifically, there are two nitrogen (N) atoms incorporated into the ring system.\n*   **Functional group:** There is a carbonyl group (C=O). This carbonyl group is part of a ring and is adjacent to a nitrogen atom, which defines it as a lactam (a cyclic amide).\n*   **Alkaloid characteristics:** The presence of nitrogen atoms in a complex, plant-derived (typically) heterocyclic structure is the defining characteristic of an alkaloid.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the core ring system.**\nLet's examine the rings. All four rings are six-membered. This tetracyclic (four-ring) system with two nitrogen atoms arranged in this specific fusion pattern is known as the **sparteine** skeleton. Sparteine is a well-known alkaloid found in lupin plants.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the modification to the core skeleton.**\nCompared to the parent compound sparteine (C₁₅H₂₆N₂), the given molecule has an additional oxygen atom and two fewer hydrogen atoms. This corresponds to the presence of the carbonyl group (C=O), forming a lactam. Therefore, the compound is an **oxosparteine**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the specific name.**\nThe position of the carbonyl group and the stereochemistry (the 3D arrangement of atoms, indicated by wedged and dashed bonds) are crucial for the specific name.\n*   The structure shown is a specific stereoisomer of 2-oxosparteine (numbering the sparteine skeleton according to IUPAC rules).\n*   This particular structure, with its specific stereochemistry, is a widely known natural product. Its common name is **Lupanine**.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\nBy recognizing the tetracyclic sparteine core, the lactam functional group, and the specific stereochemical configuration, the compound is identified as the lupin alkaloid Lupanine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
