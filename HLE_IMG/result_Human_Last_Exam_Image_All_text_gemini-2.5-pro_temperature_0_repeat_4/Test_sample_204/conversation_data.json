    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the order of the specimens based on increasing silicate structure complexity.\n\n**Step 1: Identify each mineral specimen.**\n\n*   **Specimen C:** This mineral displays a granular texture and a distinct olive-green color. These are characteristic features of **Olivine**.\n*   **Specimen A:** This is a dark, stout, prismatic crystal. This crystal habit is typical for minerals in the **Pyroxene** group, such as augite.\n*   **Specimen B:** This specimen is thin, flaky, and separates into sheets. This perfect basal cleavage and micaceous habit are hallmarks of the **Mica** group (or similar sheet silicates like chlorite).\n*   **Specimen D:** This mineral is translucent, has a glassy (vitreous) luster, and shows conchoidal fracture (curved, shell-like breaks) with no visible cleavage planes. These properties are definitive for **Quartz**.\n\n**Step 2: Classify each mineral by its silicate structure.**\n\nThe complexity of a silicate mineral's structure is determined by how the silica tetrahedra (the basic SiOâ‚„ building block) are linked together. This is called polymerization.\n\n*   **C (Olivine):** Olivine is a **nesosilicate**. Its structure consists of isolated (independent) silica tetrahedra that are not linked to each other directly but are bonded by other metal ions. This is the simplest silicate structure.\n*   **A (Pyroxene):** Pyroxenes are **inosilicates** (single-chain). In this structure, silica tetrahedra link together to form long, single chains by sharing two oxygen atoms per tetrahedron. This is more complex than isolated tetrahedra.\n*   **B (Mica):** Micas are **phyllosilicates** (sheet silicates). The tetrahedra link to form extensive two-dimensional sheets by sharing three of their four oxygen atoms. This is more complex than single chains.\n*   **D (Quartz):** Quartz is a **tectosilicate** (framework silicate). In this structure, every tetrahedron shares all four of its oxygen atoms with neighboring tetrahedra, creating a strong, three-dimensional framework. This is the most complex and most polymerized silicate structure.\n\n**Step 3: Order the specimens by increasing structural complexity.**\n\nBased on the degree of polymerization of the silica tetrahedra, the order from simplest to most complex is:\n\n1.  **Nesosilicate** (isolated tetrahedra)\n2.  **Inosilicate** (single chains)\n3.  **Phyllosilicate** (sheets)\n4.  **Tectosilicate** (framework)\n\nMatching the specimens to this order:\n\n1.  **C** (Olivine - Nesosilicate)\n2.  **A** (Pyroxene - Inosilicate)\n3.  **B** (Mica - Phyllosilicate)\n4.  **D** (Quartz - Tectosilicate)\n\nTherefore, the final order of the specimens from least to most complex silicate structure is C, A, B, D.\n\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
