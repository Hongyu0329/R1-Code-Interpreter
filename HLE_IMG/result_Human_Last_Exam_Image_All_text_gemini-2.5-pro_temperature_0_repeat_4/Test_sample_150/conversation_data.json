    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Benzene + Propanoyl chloride + AlCl₃ → Intermediate-1**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction.\n*   **Mechanism:** The Lewis acid, AlCl₃, activates the propanoyl chloride by forming a complex, which generates a highly electrophilic acylium ion (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O). The nucleophilic benzene ring then attacks this electrophile. Subsequent deprotonation restores the aromaticity of the ring.\n*   **Careful Point:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is added to the benzene ring.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is 1-phenylpropan-1-one, also known as propiophenone.\n    *   Structure: A phenyl group attached to a carbonyl group, which is attached to an ethyl group (Ph-CO-CH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 + Br₂/FeBr₃ → Intermediate-2**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination).\n*   **Mechanism:** The FeBr₃ catalyst polarizes the Br₂ molecule, generating the electrophile \"Br⁺\". The substituent on the ring is the propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃).\n*   **Careful Point:** The acyl group is an electron-withdrawing group and is therefore a **meta-director**. It deactivates the ring towards electrophilic attack but directs the incoming electrophile to the meta position.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** A bromine atom is added to the meta position relative to the propanoyl group. The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring substituted with a propanoyl group at position 1 and a bromine atom at position 3.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 + H₂/Pd → Intermediate-3**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation (reduction).\n*   **Mechanism:** The H₂/Pd reagent is used to reduce various functional groups. In this case, it acts on the ketone group of Intermediate-2.\n*   **Careful Point:** For benzylic ketones (where the carbonyl group is adjacent to a benzene ring), catalytic hydrogenation can reduce the ketone completely to an alkane (a CH₂ group). This is a form of hydrogenolysis. This is a more likely pathway than simple reduction to an alcohol, especially in the context of a multi-step synthesis problem leading to a subsequent radical reaction. The aryl-halide bond (C-Br) is generally stable under these conditions.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The ketone group is reduced to a methylene group. The product is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring substituted with a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) at position 1 and a bromine atom at position 3.\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 + NBS/(PhCO₂)₂, CCl₄ → Product**\n\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a free-radical bromination.\n*   **Mechanism:** N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of a radical initiator like benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂) is a specific reagent for brominating at the allylic or benzylic position.\n*   **Careful Point:** The benzylic position is the carbon atom of an alkyl group that is directly attached to the benzene ring. This position is highly reactive towards radical substitution because the resulting benzylic radical is stabilized by resonance with the aromatic ring. In 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene, the benzylic position is the first CH₂ group of the propyl chain.\n*   **Product:** A hydrogen atom at the benzylic position is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   Structure: The final product has a propane chain. On the first carbon (C1) of the chain, there is a bromine atom and a (3-bromophenyl) group.\n*   **Name of the Final Product:** The parent alkane is propane. The substituents on C1 are a bromine atom and a (3-bromophenyl) group. Following IUPAC nomenclature rules (alphabetical order for substituents), the name is **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
