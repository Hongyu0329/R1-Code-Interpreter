    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual clue and the first part of the text.**\nThe text states that \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\" The image shows a man with a beard (on the right) receiving a trophy from an older, white-haired man (on the left) at what appears to be an awards ceremony.\nA search for major awards ceremonies on or around that date reveals the 2019 NHL Awards were held on June 19, 2019.\nBy comparing images from that event, the man on the right is identified as Nikita Kucherov, a professional ice hockey player for the Tampa Bay Lightning. He won several major awards that night, including the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP). The man presenting the award is NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman.\nSo, the image features a famous hockey player. A key tradition in hockey is the \"hat trick,\" where a player scores three goals in a single game. When this occurs, fans celebrate by throwing their hats onto the ice. The term \"hat trick\" is said to have originated in the 19th century, where a player accomplishing a special feat was rewarded with a new hat.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\nThe text states, \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This points to a historical process or object that is now obsolete because it involved toxic mercury compounds.\nA well-known historical example is the manufacturing of felt hats. The process, called \"carroting,\" used mercury(II) nitrate to treat animal fur to make it into felt. This process was highly toxic to the workers, known as \"hatters,\" causing mercury poisoning which led to neurological damage. This is the origin of the phrase \"mad as a hatter.\" Due to its toxicity, the use of mercury in hat-making has been banned and has ceased.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the two clues to identify \"X Y\".**\nWe need to find a two-word term (\"X Y\") that connects the hockey player in the image with the obsolete, mercury-related process.\n*   The first clue points to a hockey player, who is associated with the \"hat trick\" tradition. The original reward for a hat trick was a new hat. In the era the term originated, this would have been a **felt hat**.\n*   The second clue directly describes the historical manufacturing process of the **felt hat**, which used toxic mercury salts and has now ceased.\n\nBoth clues converge on the term \"Felt Hat\". The first clue alludes to it through the hockey tradition, and the second clue describes its obsolete manufacturing process.\n\nTherefore, X Y is \"Felt Hat\".\n\n<<<Felt Hat>>>"
