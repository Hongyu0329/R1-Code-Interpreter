    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Basic Musical Elements**\n*   **Instrumentation:** The music is written on a grand staff (a treble clef staff and a bass clef staff joined by a brace), which is standard for piano music.\n*   **Key Signature:** There are two sharps (F# and C#) in the key signature. This indicates the key is either D major or its relative minor, B minor. The first chord played in the left hand is a D major chord (D-F#-A), and the overall tonality of the opening measures is clearly D major.\n*   **Time Signature:** Although not explicitly written as a fraction, the grouping of notes within each measure (e.g., four quarter notes' worth of value) indicates a 4/4 time signature, also known as common time.\n*   **Tempo:** The tempo marking is a quarter note = 80, which is a moderate tempo, often described as Andante or Moderato.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Musical Content and Style**\n*   **Melody and Harmony:** The piece begins with a simple, lyrical, and memorable melody in the right hand (A-G-F#-E-D) over a sustained D major chord. This creates a calm and cantabile (song-like) opening. The harmony is lush and characteristic of the Romantic period.\n*   **Dynamics:** There are extreme and sudden shifts in dynamics. The piece starts softly (*p* - piano), then abruptly erupts into a loud (*f* - forte) section in measure 3. This is followed by further dynamic nuances like *mp* (mezzo-piano) and *mf* (mezzo-forte). Such dramatic contrast is a hallmark of Romantic-era music.\n*   **Texture and Technique:** The texture changes dramatically. It begins with a simple melody-and-accompaniment texture. In measure 3, it transforms into a thick, complex texture with rapid sixteenth-note arpeggios and broken chords in both hands. This requires significant technical skill (virtuosity) from the pianist, involving wide leaps, fast passages, and dense chords. The writing is idiomatic for the piano, utilizing its full range and dynamic capabilities.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Piece**\n*   The combination of a beautiful, lyrical theme in D major, followed by a sudden, passionate, and virtuosic outburst, is highly characteristic of the Russian composer **Sergei Rachmaninoff**.\n*   His set of preludes, particularly Op. 23 and Op. 32, are famous for this kind of writing.\n*   Comparing the opening melody and the subsequent virtuosic passage to his works, this piece is unmistakably the **Prelude in D major, Op. 23, No. 4**. The gentle, bell-like opening and the surging, passionate middle section are the defining features of this specific prelude.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe sheet music is from Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in D major, Op. 23, No. 4.\n\n<<<Sergei Rachmaninoff - Prelude in D major, Op. 23, No. 4>>>"
