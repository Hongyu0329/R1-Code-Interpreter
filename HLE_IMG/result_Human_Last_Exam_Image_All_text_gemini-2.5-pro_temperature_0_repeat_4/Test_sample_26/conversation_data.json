    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step 1: Locate the Measure and Identify the Key Signature**\n*   The question asks for the analysis of measure 30. Looking at the provided sheet music, we can find the measure numbers. The second system on the page begins with measure 28. Measure 30 is the third measure in that system, which is circled in the provided image.\n*   The key signature, shown at the beginning of the staff, has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). This indicates the key of C minor or its relative major, E♭ major. The first movement of the \"Pathetique\" sonata is famously in C minor.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Notes in Measure 30**\n*   We need to identify all the notes being played in this measure across both the treble and bass clefs.\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays an octave on the downbeat: a G2 and a G3.\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The right hand plays a series of four identical groups of 32nd notes. The notes in each group are G4, B♮4, D5, and F♯5. The natural sign (♮) on the B cancels the B♭ from the key signature, and the sharp sign (♯) raises the F.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the Notes to Identify the Chord**\n*   Combining the notes from both hands, the complete set of pitches present in measure 30 is G, B♮, D, and F♯.\n*   These notes form a G major seventh chord (Gmaj7).\n    *   Root: G\n    *   Major Third: B♮\n    *   Perfect Fifth: D\n    *   Major Seventh: F♯\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Chord's Function and Roman Numeral**\n*   The key is C minor. The Roman numeral is determined by the scale degree of the chord's root and its quality.\n*   The root of the chord is G, which is the fifth scale degree of C minor. The fifth degree is called the dominant. Therefore, the Roman numeral will be based on **V**.\n*   In a minor key, it is standard practice to raise the seventh scale degree to create a leading tone that resolves more strongly to the tonic. In C minor, the diatonic seventh is B♭, but it is commonly raised to B♮. This raised leading tone turns the diatonic minor dominant chord (G-B♭-D) into a major dominant chord (G-B♮-D). The G-B♮-D triad is present in our chord. This confirms the chord's function as a major dominant, represented by a capital Roman numeral **V**.\n*   The unusual note is the F♯. A standard dominant seventh chord (V7) in C minor would be G-B♮-D-F♮. Beethoven, however, writes an F♯, creating a Gmaj7 chord.\n*   In harmonic analysis, there are two main ways to interpret this F♯:\n    1.  **As a chord tone:** The chord is literally a Vmaj7. While technically correct, this is a very rare chord to function as a dominant, and the notation \"Vmaj7\" is not standard in all analytical traditions.\n    2.  **As a non-chord tone:** A more common analytical approach is to view highly chromatic notes as embellishments of a more fundamental harmony. Here, the F♯ can be interpreted as a chromatic appoggiatura to the G. In the arpeggiated figure, the F# is the highest, most tense note, and it resolves to the G at the beginning of the next 32nd-note group. From this perspective, the essential harmony of the measure is the G major triad (G-B♮-D).\n*   Given that Roman numeral analysis primarily describes harmonic function, the most appropriate and standard analysis is to identify the core function. The chord is functioning as the dominant, preparing the return to the C minor tonic chord in measure 31. The fundamental harmony carrying this function is the G major triad.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe chord in measure 30 is built on G, the dominant of C minor. The core harmony is a G major triad (V). The F♯ is a chromatic embellishment (an appoggiatura) that adds tension but does not change the chord's fundamental dominant function. Therefore, the correct Roman numeral is V.\n\n<<<V>>>"
