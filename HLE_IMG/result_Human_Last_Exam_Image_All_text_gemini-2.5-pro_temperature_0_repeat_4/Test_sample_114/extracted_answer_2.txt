The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 arises because the two termini of its bicyclic münchnone intermediate (a methyl-substituted C2 and a CH₂ group at C7 which is part of the fused ring) are sterically and electronically very different. This large difference enforces a strong kinetic preference for one orientation in the [3+2] cycloaddition step. In contrast, the results from Reactions 1 and 2 show that when the münchnone termini are very similar (both are methyl-substituted carbons), the cycloaddition step itself is not regioselective, as stated in the problem. The formation of a single product in Reaction 1 is due to a subsequent kinetic funneling effect where one of the two initial adducts proceeds irreversibly to the product while the other can revert to the starting materials. Therefore, Reactions 1 and 2 provide a contrasting example that highlights how the dissimilarity of the dipole termini in Reaction 3 is the key factor for its high regioselectivity.
