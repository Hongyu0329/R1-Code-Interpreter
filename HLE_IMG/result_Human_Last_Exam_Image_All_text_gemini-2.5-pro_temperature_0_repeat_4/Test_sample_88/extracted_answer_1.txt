The three products A, B, and C have the following structures:

**Product A (C14H20N2O3):** The [2+2] cycloaddition product of the initial [3+2] cycloadduct (P1) and ketene.

*A visual representation of Product A would show a dihydropyrrolizine core substituted at the nitrogen. The substituent is a bicyclo[4.2.0]octane system containing a nitrogen atom and a ketone, formed from the reaction of the pyrroline ring with ketene.*

**Product B (C12H14N2O3):** The fully dehydrogenated and N-oxidized product of the initial [3+2] cycloadduct (P1).

*A visual representation of Product B would show a planar, aromatic pyrrolizine ring system fused with a pyrrole ring via the nitrogen atom. The pyrrolizine nitrogen is oxidized to an N-oxide, and a methyl ester group is attached to the pyrrolizine ring.*

**Product C (C11H16N2O3):** The [2+2] cycloaddition product of the starting material (SM) and ketene.
