    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Goal**\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency of the circuit at node $a_0$. The circuit acts as a low-pass filter, where the output is taken across the capacitor $C$. The cutoff frequency is determined by the capacitor $C$ and the Thevenin equivalent resistance ($R_{th}$) of the rest of the circuit as seen from the terminals of the capacitor (node $a_0$ and ground).\n\nThe cutoff angular frequency, $\\omega_c$, for a first-order RC low-pass filter is given by the formula:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\n\nThe cutoff frequency in Hertz, $f_c$, is:\n$f_c = \\frac{\\omega_c}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi R_{th}C}$\n\nOur main task is to calculate the Thevenin resistance $R_{th}$.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Circuit to Find R_th**\nTo find $R_{th}$ at node $a_0$, we need to find the equivalent resistance looking into node $a_0$ with all independent sources turned off. The input is at node $c_0$. Turning off the input voltage source means grounding node $c_0$. Node $b_0$ is already connected to ground.\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the ladder network based on the provided diagram:\n*   The network consists of two vertical rails of resistors, the 'c' rail and the 'd' rail.\n*   Node $a_0$ is the bottom-most node on the 'd' rail. Let's label it $d_0$ for consistency. So, $a_0 \\equiv d_0$.\n*   The input node is $c_0$. For calculating $R_{th}$, $c_0$ is grounded.\n*   The ladder has vertical resistors connecting $c_n$ to $c_{n+1}$ and $d_n$ to $d_{n+1}$ for $n \\ge 0$.\n*   The ladder has horizontal \"rung\" resistors connecting $c_{n+1}$ to $d_{n+1}$ for $n \\ge 0$.\n*   A careful observation of the diagram shows that the first rung resistor connects nodes $c_1$ and $d_1$. There is no resistor connecting $c_0$ and $d_0$.\n\n**3. Calculating R_th using Nodal Analysis**\nWe will use nodal analysis on the infinite ladder to find $R_{th}$. We apply a test voltage $V_t$ at node $d_0$ (i.e., $u_0 = V_t$) and calculate the current $I_t$ flowing into the node. We have $c_0$ grounded, so its voltage is $v_0 = 0$.\n\nLet $u_n$ be the voltage at node $d_n$ and $v_n$ be the voltage at node $c_n$.\n\nFor any node $n \\ge 1$, we can write the Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) equations:\n*   At node $d_n$: $\\frac{u_n - u_{n-1}}{r} + \\frac{u_n - u_{n+1}}{r} + \\frac{u_n - v_n}{r} = 0 \\implies 3u_n - u_{n-1} - u_{n+1} - v_n = 0$\n*   At node $c_n$: $\\frac{v_n - v_{n-1}}{r} + \\frac{v_n - v_{n+1}}{r} + \\frac{v_n - u_n}{r} = 0 \\implies 3v_n - v_{n-1} - v_{n+1} - u_n = 0$\n\nThese are a pair of coupled linear difference equations. We look for solutions of the form $u_n = A\\lambda^n$ and $v_n = B\\lambda^n$. This leads to two sets of solutions:\n1.  $u_n = v_n$, with characteristic roots $\\lambda=1$ (repeated).\n2.  $u_n = -v_n$, with characteristic roots $\\lambda = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nFor the voltages to remain finite as $n \\to \\infty$, we must discard the solutions that grow with $n$. This leaves us with solutions of the form:\n$u_n = A_1 + A_3(2-\\sqrt{3})^n$\n$v_n = A_1 - A_3(2-\\sqrt{3})^n$\n\nLet $\\lambda_s = 2-\\sqrt{3}$. The solution form for $n \\ge 1$ is:\n$u_n = A_1 + A_3\\lambda_s^n$\n$v_n = A_1 - A_3\\lambda_s^n$\n\nNow we apply the boundary conditions at the start of the ladder ($n=0, 1$) using the KCL equations at $n=1$:\n*   KCL at $c_1$: $3v_1 - v_0 - v_2 - u_1 = 0$. With $v_0=0$, this is $3v_1 - v_2 - u_1 = 0$.\n*   KCL at $d_1$: $3u_1 - u_0 - u_2 - v_1 = 0$. With $u_0=V_t$, this is $3u_1 - u_2 - v_1 = V_t$.\n\nSubstituting the general solutions for $u_1, v_1, u_2, v_2$ into the first equation gives $A_1 = A_3$.\nSubstituting into the second equation gives $2A_1 = V_t$, so $A_1 = A_3 = V_t/2$.\n\nThe voltages for $n \\ge 1$ are:\n$u_n = \\frac{V_t}{2}(1 + \\lambda_s^n)$\n$v_n = \\frac{V_t}{2}(1 - \\lambda_s^n)$\n\nThe current $I_t$ supplied by the test source at $d_0$ flows through the resistor connecting $d_0$ and $d_1$.\n$I_t = \\frac{u_0 - u_1}{r} = \\frac{V_t - u_1}{r}$\n\nWe find $u_1$:\n$u_1 = \\frac{V_t}{2}(1 + \\lambda_s) = \\frac{V_t}{2}(1 + 2 - \\sqrt{3}) = \\frac{V_t}{2}(3 - \\sqrt{3})$\n\nNow, we calculate $I_t$:\n$I_t = \\frac{1}{r} \\left( V_t - \\frac{V_t}{2}(3 - \\sqrt{3}) \\right) = \\frac{V_t}{r} \\left( 1 - \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{V_t}{r} \\left( \\frac{2 - 3 + \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{V_t}{r} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{2} \\right)$\n\nThe Thevenin resistance is $R_{th} = \\frac{V_t}{I_t}$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{r}{(\\sqrt{3} - 1)/2} = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}$\n\nTo simplify, we rationalize the denominator:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\\sqrt{3} - 1)(\\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\n**4. Determining the Cutoff Frequency**\nNow that we have the Thevenin resistance, we can find the cutoff frequency. We will provide the angular frequency $\\omega_c$.\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThe expression for the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$ is $\\frac{1}{rC(1 + \\sqrt{3})}$.\n\n<<<1/(r*C*(1+sqrt(3)))>>>"
