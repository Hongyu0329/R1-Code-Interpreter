    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval from the provided graph.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph**\nThe graph is a raster plot showing neuronal firing activity over time.\n*   The **x-axis** represents Time in seconds (s), from 0 to 50.\n*   The **y-axis** represents the Electrode Number, from 0 to 128. Each row corresponds to a different recording site (and likely a different neuron or group of neurons).\n*   Each **black dot** represents a single action potential (a \"spike\" or \"firing\") recorded by an electrode at a specific time.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts**\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a period where a large number of neurons fire in a coordinated and rapid fashion. In the raster plot, these events appear as dense vertical bands of dots, indicating that many electrodes detected spikes at approximately the same time.\n\nBy visually inspecting the graph, we can identify four major synchronized bursts:\n1.  **Burst 1:** A very clear and dense burst occurs early in the recording. Its center appears to be at approximately **t = 2 s**.\n2.  **Burst 2:** The next major burst is located between 10 s and 20 s. Its center is at approximately **t = 15 s**.\n3.  **Burst 3:** Another strong burst is visible between 30 s and 40 s. Its center is at approximately **t = 36 s**.\n4.  **Burst 4:** The final prominent burst occurs near the end of the recording. Its center is at approximately **t = 48 s**.\n\nSo, the timestamps of the synchronized bursts are approximately: 2 s, 15 s, 36 s, and 48 s.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between the midpoints of two consecutive bursts. With four bursts, we can calculate three IBIs.\n\n*   **IBI 1:** The interval between Burst 1 and Burst 2.\n    *   IBI₁ = Time(Burst 2) - Time(Burst 1) = 15 s - 2 s = **13 s**\n*   **IBI 2:** The interval between Burst 2 and Burst 3.\n    *   IBI₂ = Time(Burst 3) - Time(Burst 2) = 36 s - 15 s = **21 s**\n*   **IBI 3:** The interval between Burst 3 and Burst 4.\n    *   IBI₃ = Time(Burst 4) - Time(Burst 3) = 48 s - 36 s = **12 s**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nThe average IBI is the sum of the individual IBIs divided by the number of intervals.\n\n*   Average IBI = (IBI₁ + IBI₂ + IBI₃) / 3\n*   Average IBI = (13 s + 21 s + 12 s) / 3\n*   Average IBI = 46 s / 3\n*   Average IBI ≈ 15.333... s\n\n**Step 5: Round to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question asks for the final answer to be given to two significant figures.\n\n*   The calculated value is 15.333... s.\n*   The first two significant figures are 1 and 5.\n*   The next digit is 3, which is less than 5, so we round down.\n*   The average inter-burst interval, rounded to two significant figures, is **15 s**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   **Timestamps of synchronized bursts:** Approximately 2 s, 15 s, 36 s, and 48 s.\n*   **Inter-burst intervals:** 13 s, 21 s, and 12 s.\n*   **Average inter-burst interval:** (13 + 21 + 12) / 3 ≈ 15.33 s.\n*   **Average inter-burst interval to two significant figures:** 15 s.\n\n<<<15>>>"
