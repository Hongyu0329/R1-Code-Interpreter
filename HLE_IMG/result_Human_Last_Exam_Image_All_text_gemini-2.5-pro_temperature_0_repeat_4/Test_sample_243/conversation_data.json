    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to answer the question.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the plant.**\nThe image displays a plant with very distinctive leaves. The key features are:\n*   **Leaf Color and Pattern:** The leaves are a deep, glossy green. The most prominent feature is the intricate network of pale, creamy-white veins that stand out against the dark green background. This pattern is known as reticulated venation.\n*   **Leaf Shape and Arrangement:** The leaves are simple, elliptical to ovate in shape, with smooth edges. They appear to be arranged in opposite pairs, which cluster towards the ends of the stems, forming a whorl-like appearance.\n*   **Overall Habit:** The plant appears to be a woody shrub. In the background, small, dark, round structures can be seen, which are likely flower buds or developing fruits.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the plant species.**\nBased on the unique combination of features, especially the reticulated venation and leaf arrangement, the plant can be identified.\n*   The growth habit and leaf structure are characteristic of the genus *Hebe* (now often included in *Veronica*).\n*   Searching for *Hebe* or *Veronica* species with prominent reticulated veins leads to a specific species: *Veronica chathamica*, formerly known as *Hebe chathamica*.\n*   Comparing images of *Veronica chathamica* with the plant in the photo confirms the identification. The leaf shape, color, and especially the unique \"cracked china\" or netted vein pattern are a perfect match.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the endemic location of the identified plant.**\nThe question asks for the name of the island to which this plant is endemic.\n*   The specific epithet in the scientific name, *chathamica*, provides a strong clue. In botanical nomenclature, such names often refer to the place of origin.\n*   Research confirms that *Veronica chathamica* is endemic to the Chatham Islands. This archipelago is located in the Pacific Ocean, east of New Zealand's South Island.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the answer.**\nThe plant is *Veronica chathamica*, and its name indicates its origin. It is endemic to the Chatham Islands. The main island of this archipelago is named Chatham Island.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Distinguishing from other plants:** It's important not to confuse this plant with other variegated shrubs. The pattern is not marginal or splotchy variegation but a fine, net-like pattern across the entire leaf surface, which is a key identifier.\n*   **Endemic vs. Cultivated:** While this plant might be cultivated in gardens worldwide, the question specifically asks about its endemic originâ€”the place where it naturally occurs and is native to.\n*   **Scientific Name:** The scientific name is a crucial piece of evidence. The suffix \"-ica\" or \"-ensis\" attached to a place name is a common way to form specific epithets indicating origin.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the island where the plant is endemic.\n\n<<<Chatham Islands>>>"
