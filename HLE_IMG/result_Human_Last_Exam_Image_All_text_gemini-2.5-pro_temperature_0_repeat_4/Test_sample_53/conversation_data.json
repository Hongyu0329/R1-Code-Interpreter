    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the image.**\n    The image is a photograph of a scene painted on an ancient Greek vase, specifically in the red-figure style where figures are reserved in the red clay color against a black background. The scene is dynamic and depicts a chariot in motion. We can identify several figures:\n    1.  A figure driving the chariot, wearing a distinctive patterned sleeve and a Phrygian cap (a soft, conical cap with the top pulled forward). This attire in Greek art often signifies a person from the East (Anatolia/Phrygia).\n    2.  A female figure sitting next to the driver, draped in cloth.\n    3.  A nude male figure depicted in the act of falling or having fallen from a chariot. He is positioned below and in front of the visible chariot, with his body contorted and his head near the ground.\n    4.  A winged figure hovering above the chariot.\n    5.  A white horse pulling the chariot.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the mythological context.**\n    The combination of these elements points to a specific Greek myth: the chariot race between Pelops and King Oenomaus.\n    *   **The Myth:** King Oenomaus of Pisa would challenge suitors for his daughter Hippodamia's hand to a chariot race. The king had divine horses and had killed many suitors. Pelops, a prince from Lydia (a region in Anatolia, hence the Phrygian cap), challenged him. Pelops won the race, either through the help of the god Poseidon or by bribing Oenomaus's charioteer, Myrtilus, to sabotage the king's chariot. During the race, the king's chariot crashed, and Oenomaus was killed. Pelops then married Hippodamia.\n\n*   **Step 3: Match the figures in the image to the characters in the myth.**\n    *   The driver in the Phrygian cap is **Pelops**, the hero from Lydia.\n    *   The female passenger is **Hippodamia**, the daughter of Oenomaus and the prize of the race.\n    *   The winged figure is likely **Nike**, the goddess of Victory, signifying Pelops's triumph, or possibly Eros, representing the romantic motivation for the race.\n    *   The nude male figure falling dramatically is **King Oenomaus**, who has been thrown from his own crashing chariot (which is not fully depicted) and is about to be trampled or is shown at the moment of his defeat and death.\n\n*   **Step 4: Answer the specific question.**\n    The question asks, \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\". Based on the analysis, the figure depicted falling is King Oenomaus. He is \"leaving\" his chariot involuntarily as it crashes, leading to his death.\n\n<<<Oenomaus>>>"
