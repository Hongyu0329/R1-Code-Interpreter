    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each of the nine works.\n\n**Analysis of Each Artwork:**\n\n1.  **Top-left:** This is a Chinese ink and color painting of ethnic minority women. The style is realistic and detailed. In the upper right corner, a signature \"邦义\" (Bāngyì) is visible. This is the name of the contemporary Chinese artist **Chen Bangyi (陈邦义)**, who is well-known for his figure paintings of Tibetan people and other ethnic minorities, matching the style and subject of the work.\n\n2.  **Top-middle:** This is an expressive ink wash painting of a landscape with houses. The style, characterized by dark, blocky, and simplified forms, is a signature of **Lin Fengmian (林风眠)**. He was a pioneer of modern Chinese painting who blended Chinese and Western techniques, and his landscapes often feature this distinct, powerful composition.\n\n3.  **Top-right:** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in a very dynamic and recognizable cursive script. The text is from a famous poem by Mao Zedong, beginning with \"江山如此多娇\" (The land is so rich in beauty). The handwriting style is unmistakably that of **Mao Zedong (毛泽东)**.\n\n4.  **Middle-left:** This is another work of Chinese calligraphy in cursive script. The signature at the end of the text can be identified as \"于右任\" (Yú Yòurèn). **Yu Youren** was a prominent 20th-century politician and a master calligrapher, celebrated for his standardized cursive script, which is exemplified in this piece.\n\n5.  **Middle-center:** This is a highly realistic oil painting of a young woman in a white shirt, standing before a traditional Chinese mural. This work is a classic example of Chinese Neoclassicism. It is a famous painting titled \"Young Female Singer\" (青年女歌手) by **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**, a master of this style.\n\n6.  **Middle-right:** This is an ink and color painting of a woman with an elaborate headdress. The distinctive style, featuring an elongated face, slender neck, melancholic expression, and a fusion of fine lines with bold color washes, is the iconic style of **Lin Fengmian (林风眠)**, particularly famous for his paintings of ladies.\n\n7.  **Bottom-left:** This is a colorful painting depicting a rural scene with gourds on a trellis and laundry on a line. On the wall to the right, the signature \"吴冠中\" (Wú Guànzhōng) is clearly visible. The style, which synthesizes the elegance of Chinese ink lines with the vibrant color palette of Western modernism, is the unique and celebrated style of **Wu Guanzhong**.\n\n8.  **Bottom-middle:** This is a majestic landscape painting of a river gorge. The powerful, textured brushwork (known as \"Baoshi cun\"), the creation of a misty atmosphere, and the grand composition are all hallmarks of the 20th-century master **Fu Baoshi (傅抱石)**, renowned for his revolutionary landscapes.\n\n9.  **Bottom-right:** This is an ink painting of a lobster. The artist most famous for painting aquatic creatures like shrimp, crabs, and lobsters with exceptional vitality and masterful brushwork is **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**. The skill shown in capturing the creature's form and texture is characteristic of his work.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis of style, subject matter, and visible signatures, the authors of the nine works from left to right, top to bottom are:\n\n1.  Chen Bangyi\n2.  Lin Fengmian\n3.  Mao Zedong\n4.  Yu Youren\n5.  Jin Shangyi\n6.  Lin Fengmian\n7.  Wu Guanzhong\n8.  Fu Baoshi\n9.  Qi Baishi\n\n<<<Chen Bangyi, Lin Fengmian, Mao Zedong, Yu Youren, Jin Shangyi, Lin Fengmian, Wu Guanzhong, Fu Baoshi, Qi Baishi>>>"
