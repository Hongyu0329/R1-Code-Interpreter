    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the opera.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Textual Clues on the Score**\n*   **Instrumentation:** The instrument names are in German:\n    *   `2 gr. Fl.` stands for *2 große Flöten* (2 Flutes).\n    *   `I. Hob.` stands for *I. Oboe* (1st Oboe).\n    *   `engl. Horn` stands for *Englischhorn* (English Horn).\n    *   `I. Fag.` stands for *I. Fagott* (1st Bassoon).\n    *   `I. Viol.`, `II. Viol.`, `Br.`, `Celli` stand for the string sections: 1st Violins, 2nd Violins, Violas, and Cellos.\n    This indicates the opera is likely by a German-speaking composer.\n*   **Performance Directions:** The directions are also in German:\n    *   `(Vorhang)` means \"(Curtain)\". This is a stage direction indicating the curtain rises at this point.\n    *   `mit Dämpfer` means \"with mute\".\n    *   `(die übrigen)` means \"(the others)\" or \"(the rest)\", referring to the remaining players in a string section.\n    *   `1. Pult` refers to the first desk or stand of a string section.\n*   **Context:** The combination of `1` (rehearsal mark 1) and `(Vorhang)` confirms this is the very beginning of a scene, right as the curtain opens. The question specifies this is the opening of the second act.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Musical Characteristics**\n*   **Orchestration:** The score calls for a large orchestra, typical of the late-Romantic and early 20th-century periods. The detailed division of the string section (`1. Pult`, `2. Pult`, `Solo Br.`) is also characteristic of this era.\n*   **Harmony and Tonality:** The key signature has four sharps (F#, C#, G#, D#). The opening chords in the strings (E-G#-B) establish the key as a bright and shimmering E major. The harmony is rich and complex, a hallmark of composers like Richard Strauss or Gustav Mahler.\n*   **Melody and Texture:** The music begins softly (`p`, `pp`) with a shimmering texture in the strings. There is a sense of anticipation and excitement that builds rapidly, moving from `p` to `mf` and culminating in a `gliss.` (glissando) effect. This energetic and brilliant opening is very distinctive.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Opera**\n*   The combination of a large orchestra, lush late-Romantic harmony, German text, and the specific musical content points strongly towards the work of Richard Strauss.\n*   The specific musical passage—a brilliant, bustling, and shimmering orchestral prelude in E major that opens an act as the curtain rises—is the famous introduction to Act II of the opera *Der Rosenkavalier*.\n*   This introduction musically depicts the frantic and excited preparations in the house of Herr von Faninal for the arrival of the \"Rose-bearer\" (the Rosenkavalier), Octavian. The music perfectly captures the sense of occasion and high-society commotion.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the German instrumentation and directions, the late-Romantic musical style, and the specific, recognizable musical theme that opens Act II as the curtain rises, the piece of music is from Richard Strauss's opera *Der Rosenkavalier*.\n\n<<<Der Rosenkavalier>>>"
