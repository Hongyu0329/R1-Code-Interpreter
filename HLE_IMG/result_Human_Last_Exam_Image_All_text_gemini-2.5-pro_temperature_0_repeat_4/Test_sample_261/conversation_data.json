    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the book title from the cover fragment.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements in the image fragment.**\n*   **Main Subject:** The central figure is a white or silvery, ethereal-looking creature with a single horn on its forehead. This is clearly a unicorn. It appears to be in motion, galloping or running.\n*   **Art Style:** The illustration is painterly and has a distinct fantasy feel. The unicorn has a glowing, almost translucent quality.\n*   **Background:** The background is dark and indistinct, suggesting a forest at night or a dark cave.\n*   **Composition:** The unicorn is partially hidden behind a large, column-like object on the right side of the image. This object has a warm, yellowish-brown, stone-like texture.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate hypotheses based on the visual clues.**\n*   The presence of a unicorn strongly suggests a fantasy novel.\n*   The specific ethereal, silvery appearance of the unicorn is a significant clue. It's not just a white horse with a horn; it looks magical and spirit-like. This is reminiscent of the unicorns described in the Harry Potter series, or the Patronus charm which often takes the form of a silvery animal.\n*   The art style is very recognizable as that of Mary GrandPr√©, the illustrator for the original American editions of the Harry Potter series.\n\n**Step 3: Test the hypothesis against the Harry Potter series.**\n*   The most prominent unicorn scene in the series occurs in the first book, *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* (or *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* in the UK), when Harry encounters one in the Forbidden Forest.\n*   Let's examine the cover art for *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* (US edition). The front cover famously shows Harry on his broomstick during a Quidditch match. This does not match the fragment.\n*   However, the original hardcover editions featured wrap-around dust jacket art. We need to look at the full, unfolded cover illustration.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the fragment against the full cover art.**\n*   Upon viewing the full wrap-around cover art for the US edition of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*, we can see the complete scene.\n*   The front cover shows Harry on his broom.\n*   The back cover depicts the Forbidden Forest. On the left side of the back cover, there is the exact silvery unicorn from the fragment, running through the dark trees.\n*   The \"pillar\" on the right of the fragment is actually the edge of the stone archway that frames the Quidditch scene on the front cover. The full artwork seamlessly connects the front and back cover scenes.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the identification.**\n*   The image fragment is a direct crop from the back cover portion of the wrap-around dust jacket illustration for the original US edition of the book. Therefore, the title of the book is *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
