    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the century of the medallion.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observation of the Image:** The image shows a circular medallion with a tab at the top, suggesting it was part of a larger object or a pendant. The central motif is a relief carving of two figures in profile facing each other. The image is in black and white, which can sometimes indicate an older photograph of an artifact.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Iconography and Style:**\n    *   **Figures:** The two figures are depicted in a confrontational pose. The figure on the left is particularly striking due to a headdress or hairstyle featuring prominent, curled horns, similar to those of a ram. The hair of both figures is rendered in a highly stylized, patterned manner.\n    *   **Artistic Style:** The style is not naturalistic in the tradition of classical Greece or Rome. Instead, it is schematic and decorative. The faces are somewhat abstract, and the emphasis is on pattern and bold shapes. This artistic approach is a hallmark of the art produced during the Migration Period (roughly 4th to 8th centuries AD) by various Germanic peoples, who blended Late Roman influences with their own distinct aesthetic traditions.\n\n3.  **Identification of the Artifact:** The unique style and iconography, especially the horned figure, allow for the identification of this object as a famous archaeological find. This is a depiction of the central plate from one of the large gold fibulae (brooches) found as part of the **Pietroasele Treasure** (also known as the Petrossa Treasure). This hoard was discovered in Romania and is one of the most significant collections of Gothic art from the Migration Period. The image provided is likely a plaster cast or impression of the original, which was damaged.\n\n4.  **Archaeological Dating:** The Pietroasele Treasure has been extensively studied by archaeologists and historians. The consensus dating for the hoard, based on the style of the objects, associated artifacts, and historical context, places its creation and burial in the **late 4th century AD**. The treasure is believed to have belonged to a powerful Gothic chieftain, possibly the Tervingian king Athanaric.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since the medallion is a component of the Pietroasele Treasure, it shares the same date. Therefore, archaeologists ascribe this object to the 4th century AD.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Object's Function:** It is important to recognize that this is not a simple medallion but the decorative center of a large, elaborate fibula (a type of pin or brooch).\n*   **Cultural Context:** The artifact is a product of Gothic culture during the Migration Period, a time of significant cultural exchange and conflict with the Roman Empire. The style reflects this syncretism.\n*   **Dating Confidence:** The dating of the Pietroasele Treasure to the late 4th century AD is widely accepted in the academic community, making it a reliable chronological marker.\n*   **Interpretation:** While the exact meaning of the figures is debated (they may represent Germanic gods, legendary ancestors, or a ruling couple), this does not change the archaeological dating of the piece itself.\n\nBased on this analysis, the century ascribed to the medallion is the 4th century AD.\n\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
