    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The question asks for the primary, visually obvious difference in the sporophyte (the spore-producing structure) that distinguishes the moss species *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta*. The phrase \"at a glance\" implies a macroscopic feature, not one requiring microscopic examination.\n\n2.  **Identify the Parts of a Moss Sporophyte:** A typical moss sporophyte consists of three main parts:\n    *   **Foot:** Anchors the sporophyte to the gametophyte (the leafy green part).\n    *   **Seta:** The stalk that elevates the capsule.\n    *   **Capsule (sporangium):** The structure at the top of the seta that produces and releases spores.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Species Name *Grimmia curviseta*:** The specific epithet *curviseta* provides a significant clue. It is derived from Latin:\n    *   *curvus* meaning \"curved\"\n    *   *seta* meaning \"bristle\" or, in botanical terms, the stalk of the sporophyte.\n    This name strongly suggests that a curved seta is a key feature of this species.\n\n4.  **Describe the Sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta*:** Botanical sources confirm that *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by a long and distinctly **curved or cygneous (swan-necked) seta**. This curvature causes the capsule to be exserted (pushed out beyond the surrounding leaves) and often to hang or nod to one side.\n\n5.  **Describe the Sporophyte of *Grimmia montana*:** In contrast, *Grimmia montana* has a very short and **straight seta**. Because the seta is so short, the capsule is not elevated above the plant. Instead, it remains **immersed** or sessile, nestled down among the perichaetial leaves (the specialized leaves at the top of the stem). The image provided, showing capsules sitting low within the leafy tufts, is characteristic of a species like *Grimmia montana*.\n\n6.  **Compare and Identify the Main Difference:**\n    *   ***Grimmia montana***: Has a **straight, short seta**, resulting in an **immersed capsule**.\n    *   ***Grimmia curviseta***: Has a **curved, long seta**, resulting in an **exserted and nodding capsule**.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   The most reliable distinguishing feature between these two species when sporophytes are present is the seta.\n*   The position of the capsule (immersed vs. exserted) is a direct result of the length and curvature of the seta.\n*   While there are also differences in the gametophyte (the leafy part), they are often more subtle and may require a microscope. The sporophyte difference is much more dramatic and easy to see with the naked eye or a hand lens.\n*   The name *curviseta* itself is the biggest hint to its key characteristic.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that allows for identification at a glance is the **curvature and length of the seta**.\n\n<<<The main difference is the seta (the stalk of the sporophyte). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is very short and straight, causing the capsule to be immersed among the leaves. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is longer and strongly curved (cygneous or swan-necked), causing the capsule to be exserted and to hang to the side.>>>"
