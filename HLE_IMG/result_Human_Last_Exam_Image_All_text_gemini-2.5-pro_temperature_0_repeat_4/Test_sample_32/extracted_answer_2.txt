The main difference is the seta (the stalk of the sporophyte). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is very short and straight, causing the capsule to be immersed among the leaves. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is longer and strongly curved (cygneous or swan-necked), causing the capsule to be exserted and to hang to the side.
