    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Crystal Structure:** The problem asks about a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice. In an FCC unit cell, atoms are located at the eight corners and at the center of each of the six faces.\n\n2.  **Understand the Viewing Direction:** We are viewing the lattice along the [110] direction. This means we are looking down a line that passes through the origin (0,0,0) and the point (1,1,0) in the crystal's coordinate system. The image we see is the projection of all the atoms onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to this viewing direction.\n\n3.  **Determine the Projected Pattern:** When the 3D positions of atoms in an FCC lattice are projected along the [110] direction, they form a specific 2D pattern. This pattern is known to be a **centered rectangle**. This means that atoms appear at the four corners of a rectangle, with another atom located precisely in the center of that rectangle. This centered rectangular unit repeats to form the overall pattern.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Options:**\n    *   **Image A:** Shows atoms arranged in a simple rectangular grid. There are no atoms in the centers of the rectangles. This is incorrect.\n    *   **Image B:** Clearly shows a centered rectangular pattern. We can see repeating units formed by four corner atoms and one central atom. This matches our expected pattern.\n    *   **Image C:** Displays a pattern with hexagonal characteristics. This is typical of an FCC lattice viewed along the [111] direction, not [110]. This is incorrect.\n    *   **Image D:** Shows another simple rectangular grid, similar to A but denser. It lacks the central atom and is incorrect.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the geometric analysis, Image B is the only one that shows the correct centered rectangular pattern for an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that calculates the projected coordinates of the atoms to computationally verify this conclusion. The script will generate the coordinates for two distinct layers of atoms which, when superimposed, create the centered rectangular pattern seen in image B.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_crystal_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the projected pattern of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # In an FCC lattice, we can define a unit cell with a side length 'a'.\n    # For simplicity, let's assume a = 1.\n    # The basis atoms for FCC are at (0,0,0), (0.5,0.5,0), (0.5,0,0.5), (0,0.5,0.5).\n    # All other atoms are translations of these by integer vectors.\n\n    # When viewed along [110], the atoms project onto a 2D plane.\n    # The atoms form two distinct layers (A and B) that are interleaved.\n    # Let's define the coordinates for a basic repeating unit of each layer.\n\n    # Layer A forms a rectangular pattern.
