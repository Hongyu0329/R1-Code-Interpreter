# Plan: Calculate the minimum number of steps for the synthesis.
# The synthesis is divided into two main parts:
# 1. Preparation of the naphthalene core from 2-acetylnaphthalene.
# 2. The final one-pot cascade reaction to form the target molecule.

# Part 1: Steps to prepare naphthalene from 2-acetylnaphthalene
# Step 1: Baeyer-Villiger oxidation of 2-acetylnaphthalene to 2-naphthyl acetate.
# Step 2: Hydrolysis of 2-naphthyl acetate to 2-naphthol.
# Step 3: Reduction of 2-naphthol to naphthalene.
steps_reagent_prep = 3

# Part 2: Final cascade reaction step
# Step 4: One-pot acid-catalyzed annulative pi-extension of 4 molecules of
# 1,4-difluoro-2-methylbenzene with 1 molecule of naphthalene.
steps_main_reaction = 1

# Calculate the total minimum number of steps
total_steps = steps_reagent_prep + steps_main_reaction

# Print the final equation showing each number
