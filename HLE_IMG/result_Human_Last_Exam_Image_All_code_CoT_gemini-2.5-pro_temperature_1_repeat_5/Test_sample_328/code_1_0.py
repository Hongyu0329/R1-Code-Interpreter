    This function determines the 16-character string representing the solution
    to the nonlinear wave equation identification problem.

    The logic for each character is as follows:
    1: C (b=0, c=1, d=0) - Chaotic, symmetric.
    2: B (b=1, c=-1, d=-1) - Red-asymmetric, regularized, blue-shifted.
    3: B (b=1, c=0, d=0) - Red-asymmetric, breather shape.
    4: c (b=0, c=-1, d=0) - Regular, symmetric.
    5: d (b=0, c=0, d=-1) - V-shape, blue background.
    6: c (b=1, c=-1, d=1) - Regular, red-asymmetric.
    7: z (b=0, c=1, d=1) - Chaotic, red-shifted.
    8: c (b=1, c=-1, d=1) - Same as 6.
    9: c (b=0, c=-1, d=0) - Same as 4.
    10: 0 (b=-1, c=-1, d=0) - Stable pass-through, neutral background.
    11: C (b=-1, c=1, d=-1) - Chaotic, blue-shifted/asymmetric.
    12: d (b=0, c=0, d=-1) - Same as 5.
    13: d (b=0, c=0, d=-1) - Same as 5.
    14: b (b=-1, c=0, d=0) - Blue-asymmetric, breather shape.
    15: D (b=1, c=0, d=1) - Mistake in my comments above, this should be (0,0,1). V-shape, yellow background.
    16: c (b=0, c=-1, d=0) - Same as 4.

    Correcting comment for #15:
    15: D (b=0, c=0, d=1) - V-shape, light background.
