# The problem involves the addition of two complex numbers representing contour integrals.
# According to the principle of deformation of contours in complex analysis,
# the integral over the contour γ is the sum of the integrals over the contours γ₁ and γ₂,
# because γ encloses both singularities in the same manner as γ₁ and γ₂ combined.

# Define the given integral values as complex numbers.
# Python uses 'j' for the imaginary unit.
integral_gamma1 = 3 + 4j
integral_gamma2 = 5 + 6j

# Calculate the integral over γ by summing the other two integrals.
integral_gamma = integral_gamma1 + integral_gamma2

# Extract the real and imaginary parts for clear printing.

r2 = int(integral_gamma2.real)
i2 = int(integral_gamma2.imag)
r_final = int(integral_gamma.real)
i_final = int(integral_gamma.imag)
