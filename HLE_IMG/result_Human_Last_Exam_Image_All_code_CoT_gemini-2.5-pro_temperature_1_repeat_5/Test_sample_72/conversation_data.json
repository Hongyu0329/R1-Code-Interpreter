    "Here are the thinking steps to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Product:** The reaction starts with hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene and, under photochemical conditions (indicated by `hv`), forms a complex tricyclic product. A direct, single-step reaction to form this product is highly unlikely.\n2.  **Propose a Stepwise Mechanism:** A more plausible pathway involves an initial photochemical transformation of one of the reactants. Aromatic compounds like hexafluorobenzene are known to undergo photochemical valence isomerization. A common photoisomer of benzene is Dewar benzene (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This suggests the first step is the conversion of hexafluorobenzene to hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene.\n3.  **Identify the First Pericyclic Reaction:** The formation of Dewar benzene from a benzene ring is an intramolecular reaction. It can be viewed as the two pi bonds at the 1,2- and 4,5-positions reacting with each other. This involves a total of 4 pi electrons (2π + 2π). A reaction that combines two pi systems to form a ring with two new sigma bonds is called a cycloaddition. Specifically, this is a [2+2] cycloaddition. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, [2+2] cycloadditions are allowed under photochemical conditions.\n4.  **Identify the Second Pericyclic Reaction:** The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, now possesses reactive double bonds and reacts with the second starting material, cyclobutene. The product structure shows that a new four-membered ring has been formed between the two molecules. This is the result of a reaction between a double bond from the Dewar benzene (2π electrons) and the double bond from cyclobutene (2π electrons). This is another [2+2] cycloaddition, but this time it is an intermolecular reaction (between two different molecules). This reaction is also photochemically allowed.\n5.  **Formulate the Final Answer:** The overall transformation is a sequence of two distinct pericyclic reactions. Both are of the same fundamental type, [2+2] cycloadditions, but one is intramolecular and the other is intermolecular. The Python code below will print this detailed explanation.\n\n```python\ndef identify_pericyclic_reactions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the two pericyclic reactions involved in the transformation.\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = \"\"\"The overall transformation occurs in two distinct photochemically allowed pericyclic steps:\n\n1.  **Intramolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition:** The first step is the photochemical valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene into its isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This reaction is an intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition, where two pi bonds within the same molecule react to form a four-membered ring.\n\n2.  **Intermolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition:** The second step involves the hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene intermediate reacting with cyclobutene. This is an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition between a double bond of the Dewar benzene and the double bond of cyclobutene, forming another four-membered ring and linking the two molecules to yield the final product.\n\nBoth reactions are classic examples of photochemically allowed [2+2] cycloadditions.\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\nidentify_pericyclic_reactions()\n```\n<<<An intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition and an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition.>>>"
