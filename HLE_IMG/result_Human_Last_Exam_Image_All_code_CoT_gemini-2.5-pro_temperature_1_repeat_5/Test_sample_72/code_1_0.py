    explanation = """The overall transformation occurs in two distinct photochemically allowed pericyclic steps:

1.  **Intramolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition:** The first step is the photochemical valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene into its isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This reaction is an intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition, where two pi bonds within the same molecule react to form a four-membered ring.

2.  **Intermolecular [2+2] Cycloaddition:** The second step involves the hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene intermediate reacting with cyclobutene. This is an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition between a double bond of the Dewar benzene and the double bond of cyclobutene, forming another four-membered ring and linking the two molecules to yield the final product.

Both reactions are classic examples of photochemically allowed [2+2] cycloadditions.
