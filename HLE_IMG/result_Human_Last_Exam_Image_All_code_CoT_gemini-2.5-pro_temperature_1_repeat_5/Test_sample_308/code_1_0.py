def solve_roller_puzzle():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the roller drive puzzle.
    The logic for the matching is as follows:
    1.  The number of oscillations ("wiggles") in a displacement plot corresponds to the number of lobes on the driving (green) roller.
    2.  The amplitude of the wiggles corresponds to the magnitude of variation in the gear ratio (r_drive / r_driven). Pointy and jagged shapes cause high variation, while smooth and round shapes cause low variation.

    - Plot A (2 wiggles) matches Driver 3 (2 lobes).
    - Plot D (3 wiggles) matches Driver 8 (3 lobes).
    - Plots E and F (4 wiggles) match Drivers 4 and 6 (4 lobes).
      - Pair 4 (high variation) matches Plot E (high amplitude).
      - Pair 6 (low variation) matches Plot F (low amplitude).
    - Plots B, C, G, H (6 wiggles) must be matched with Drivers 1, 2, 5 (6 lobes).
      - Pair 1 (very high variation) matches Plot G (very high amplitude).
      - Pair 2 (high variation, triangle shape) matches Plot C (sharp-featured wiggles).
      - Pair 5 (moderate variation) matches Plot B (moderate amplitude).
    - This leaves Plot H and Driver 7. Although Driver 7 has 5 lobes and Plot H has 6 wiggles (a puzzle inconsistency), they are the last remaining pair and are matched by elimination.

    The final sequence for plots A-H is constructed from these pairings.
