    "Yes, there is an animal in this image. It is an insect, specifically a longhorn beetle. Based on its coloration, including the black body, long antennae, and the distinct red-orange band at the base of its wing covers (elytra), it is identified as the Variable Longhorn Beetle.\n\nHere is the Python code that prints the scientific name of the animal.\n\n```python\ndef identify_animal():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the animal in the image and prints its scientific name.\n  \"\"\"\n  is_animal_present = True\n  animal_type = \"Longhorn Beetle (Insect)\"\n  scientific_name = \"Stenocorus meridianus\"\n\n  if is_animal_present:\n    print(\"Yes, there is an animal in the image.\")\n    print(f\"The animal is a: {animal_type}\")\n    print(f\"Its scientific name is: {scientific_name}\")\n  else:\n    print(\"No animal was identified in the image.\")\n\nidentify_animal()\n```\n<<<Stenocorus meridianus>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Is there an animal in this image?
