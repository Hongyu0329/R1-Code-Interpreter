    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to identify the characters on the seal:\n\n1.  **Determine the Reading Order:** Chinese seals are traditionally read from top to bottom, and from right to left.\n2.  **Identify Each Character:** I will identify the four characters in seal script (篆书, zhuànshū) one by one according to the reading order.\n3.  **Combine and Interpret:** The four characters form a well-known classical Chinese idiom.\n4.  **Convert to Simplified Chinese:** I will convert the traditional characters into their simplified Chinese equivalents.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will provide a Python script to print the result in simplified Chinese.\n\nFollowing these steps, the characters are identified as:\n*   **Top Right:** 長 (cháng) - meaning long or eternal.\n*   **Bottom Right:** 樂 (lè) - meaning joy or happiness.\n*   **Top Left:** 未 (wèi) - meaning not yet or never.\n*   **Bottom Left:** 央 (yāng) - meaning end or cease.\n\nTogether, they form the idiom **長樂未央 (Cháng Lè Wèi Yāng)**, which translates to \"Eternal happiness without end\". This was a very popular phrase during the Han Dynasty.\n\nIn simplified Chinese, the characters are **长乐未央**.\n\nHere is the Python code to display the result.\n\n```python\ndef get_seal_characters():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the characters on the seal in simplified Chinese.\n  The characters are read from top-to-bottom, right-to-left.\n  - Top Right: 長 (cháng) -> 长\n  - Bottom Right: 樂 (lè) -> 乐\n  - Top Left: 未 (wèi) -> 未\n  - Bottom Left: 央 (yāng) -> 央\n  The phrase is \"长乐未央\", meaning \"Eternal happiness without end\".\n  \"\"\"\n  simplified_chinese_characters = \"长乐未央\"\n  print(f\"The characters on the seal in simplified Chinese are: {simplified_chinese_characters}\")\n\nget_seal_characters()\n```\n<<<长乐未央>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What's the character content on the seal in simplified Chinese?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
