The text explains that a new flagellum grows next to the old one and that the arrangement is 'chiral', meaning it has a consistent handedness. By observing Image 1, we can see that the new flagellum emerges and runs alongside the old one. If we were to view the cell from its posterior (tail end), the new flagellum is positioned to the left of the old flagellum.")
