    "This task requires a multi-step music theory analysis. Here is the plan:\n1.  **Establish the Key Context:** The piece is in C minor, but this section (the second theme group) modulates to the relative major, which is E-flat Major. We will analyze the harmony within the key of E-flat Major.\n2.  **Identify the Chord in Measure 30:** We will identify all the notes played in measure 30 to determine the chord's root, quality, and inversion. The notes are G, B-natural, and D-natural in the right hand, with a G in the left hand. The F in the right hand is the seventh of the chord. This forms a G dominant 7th chord (G7).\n3.  **Identify the Chord of Resolution:** We will look at the following measure (m. 31) to see where the G7 chord resolves. It resolves to a C minor chord.\n4.  **Determine the Function:** In the key of E-flat Major, the C minor chord is the submediant, or the `vi` chord. The G7 chord is the dominant (V) of C minor. Therefore, the G7 chord is functioning as a secondary dominant, specifically the \"V of vi\".\n5.  **Construct the Roman Numeral:** The Roman numeral for a dominant seventh chord is V⁷. Since it is the dominant of the `vi` chord, the full notation is V⁷/vi.\n6.  **Generate Code:** A Python script will be created to walk through these steps and print the final, correctly formatted Roman numeral.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_beethoven_measure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, Mvt. 1,\n    to determine its Roman numeral.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the musical context.\n    local_key = \"E-flat Major\"\n    target_chord_in_key = \"C minor\"\n    target_chord_roman_numeral = \"vi\"\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the chord in measure 30.\n    chord_m30_notes = \"G, B-natural, D, F\"\n    chord_m30_name = \"G dominant 7th\"\n    chord_m30_root = \"G\"\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the function.\n    # The G7 chord is the dominant of the C minor chord.\n    # Since C minor is the 'vi' in E-flat Major, G7 is the 'V of vi'.\n    function_description = f\"V of {target_chord_roman_numeral}\"\n    \n    # Step 4: Assemble the final Roman numeral components.\n    dominant_symbol = \"V\"\n    seventh_symbol = \"⁷\"\n    separator_symbol = \"/\"\n    target_symbol = \"vi\"\n    \n    final_numeral = f\"{dominant_symbol}{seventh_symbol}{separator_symbol}{target_symbol}\"\n\n    print(\"Analysis Steps:\")\n    print(f\"1. The local key is {local_key}.\")\n    print(f\"2. The chord in measure 30 is a {chord_m30_name} ({chord_m30_notes}).\")\n    print(f\"3. This chord resolves to {target_chord_in_key}, which is the '{target_chord_roman_numeral}' chord in {local_key}.\")\n    print(f\"4. Thus, the chord functions as a secondary dominant: the {function_description}.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Roman Numeral Construction:\")\n    print(f\"Dominant function: {dominant_symbol}\")\n    print(f\"Seventh quality: {seventh_symbol}\")\n    print(f\"Secondary function ('of'): {separator_symbol}\")\n    print(f\"Target chord: {target_symbol}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe complete Roman numeral is: {final_numeral}\")\n\n\nanalyze_beethoven_measure()\n<<<V⁷/vi>>>\n```"
