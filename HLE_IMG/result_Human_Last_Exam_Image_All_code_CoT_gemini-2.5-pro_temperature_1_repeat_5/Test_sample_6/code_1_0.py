    # Analysis of each statement
    # Statement 1: False. Image D clearly shows Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions (nodular glomerulosclerosis), not their absence.
    # Statement 2: False. Image C does not show classic nodular glomerulosclerosis; this description is more fitting for Image D.
    # Statement 3: False. "Effacement" is primarily an electron microscopy term for podocytes, and no such change to Bowman's capsule is evident on light microscopy.
    # Statement 4: True. The arrows in Image D point to Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules, which are deposits of extracellular matrix characteristic of nodular glomerulosclerosis.
