# This script is designed to provide the answer for the nyala re-identification task.
# The identification is based on a visual comparison of unique features.

# Step 1: Analyze the key features of the target nyala.
# - Horn shape: Note the specific curvature and the outward twist of the left horn.
# - Stripe pattern: Observe the number and spacing of the vertical stripes.
# - Spot pattern: Identify the unique cluster of white spots on the lower flank.

# Step 2: Compare these features with each of the options (A, B, C, D, E, F).
# - Image D shows a nyala whose features are a perfect match to the target.
#   - The horn shape is identical.
#   - The stripe pattern aligns perfectly.
#   - The unique spot pattern on the flank is the same.

# Step 3: Conclude the identification.
# Based on the compelling evidence from the feature comparison, the correct image is D.

correct_image = 'D'

# Print the final answer.
print(f"The image showing the same nyala as the target is: {correct_image}")
