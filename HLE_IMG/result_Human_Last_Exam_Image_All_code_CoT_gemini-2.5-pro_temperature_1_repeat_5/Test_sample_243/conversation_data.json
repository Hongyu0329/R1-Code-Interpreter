    "My analysis identifies the plant in the image as likely being *Helwingia taiwaniana*. This identification is based on the distinctive reticulated leaf venation, a characteristic feature of this species. The question asks for the island to which this plant is endemic. As its name suggests, *Helwingia taiwaniana* is endemic to the island of Taiwan.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of this island.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the island where the plant in the image is endemic.\n    1. The plant is identified as a species of Helwingia due to its characteristic reticulated leaf venation.\n    2.
