    # The problem asks to match four simulations (1-4) with four conditions:
    # 1. minimum hopping parameter (t)
    # 2. minimum overlap magnitude (|s|)
    # 3. unique overlap sign (sign(s))
    # 4. maximum overlap (s)

    # Step 1: Analyze the effect of the parameters t and s.
    # - t (hopping parameter) controls the overall bandwidth. Larger t = wider bands.
    # - s (overlap integral) controls the asymmetry between conduction and valence bands.
    #   - sign(s): s>0 makes the valence band wider. s<0 makes the conduction band wider.
    #   - |s|: larger |s| means greater asymmetry.

    # Step 2: Analyze each plot based on these principles.

        'plot4': "Is the only plot where the conduction band is much wider than the valence band. This indicates a unique negative sign for 's'."
