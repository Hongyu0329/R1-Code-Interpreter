    "Based on the visual analysis of the provided raster plot, the synchronized bursts of neuronal activity are identified. These bursts are visible as dense vertical bands where many electrodes fire simultaneously. The following steps outline the process to calculate the average inter-burst interval:\n\n1.  **Identify Burst Timestamps:** The center of each major synchronized burst is estimated from the time axis (x-axis).\n    *   Burst 1: ~3 s\n    *   Burst 2: ~16 s\n    *   Burst 3: ~26 s\n    *   Burst 4: ~36 s\n    *   Burst 5: ~49 s\n\n2.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** The time difference between consecutive bursts is calculated.\n    *   IBI 1 = 16 s - 3 s = 13 s\n    *   IBI 2 = 26 s - 16 s = 10 s\n    *   IBI 3 = 36 s - 26 s = 10 s\n    *   IBI 4 = 49 s - 36 s = 13 s\n\n3.  **Calculate Average IBI:** The average of these intervals is computed.\n    *   Average IBI = (13 + 10 + 10 + 13) / 4 = 46 / 4 = 11.5 s\n\n4.  **Round to Significant Figures:** The result is rounded to two significant figures, which gives 12 s.\n\nThe following Python code performs these calculations and prints the result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Identify the timestamps of the synchronized bursts from the graph.\n# These are the approximate time points (in seconds) at the center of each burst.\nburst_timestamps = [3, 16, 26, 36, 49]\nprint(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the intervals between consecutive bursts.\ninter_burst_intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\nprint(f\"Calculated inter-burst intervals (s): {list(inter_burst_intervals)}\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the average of these intervals.\naverage_ibi = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\n\n# Step 4: Display the full calculation.\nsum_string = \" + \".join(map(str, inter_burst_intervals))\nprint(f\"\\nCalculating the average inter-burst interval:\")\nprint(f\"Average = ({sum_string}) / {len(inter_burst_intervals)}\")\nprint(f\"Average = {np.sum(inter_burst_intervals)} / {len(inter_burst_intervals)}\")\nprint(f\"Average = {average_ibi:.1f} s\")\n\n# Step 5: Round the result to two significant figures.\n# 11.5 rounded to two significant figures is 12.\nfinal_answer = 12\nprint(f\"\\nRounding to two significant figures, the average inter-burst interval is {final_answer} s.\")\n```\n<<<12>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts in this graph of firing activity of a neuronal culture and calculate the average inter-burst interval to two significant figures.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
