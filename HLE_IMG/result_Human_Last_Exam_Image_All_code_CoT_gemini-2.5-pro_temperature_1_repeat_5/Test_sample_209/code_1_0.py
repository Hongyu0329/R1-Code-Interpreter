    This function analyzes the giraffe images to find the match.
    The analysis is based on comparing the unique spot patterns of the giraffes.

    1.  The target giraffe has a very specific pattern of spots on its shoulder.
    2.  There is a prominent spot that looks like a bone or a sideways 'H'.
    3.  There is also a triangular cluster of spots just above the shoulder joint.
    4.  Comparing this unique pattern to the options:
        - A, C, D, E, and F have distinctly different spot patterns, shapes, and/or coloration.
        - B shows the exact same unique markers: the bone/'H'-shaped spot and the triangular cluster above the shoulder are clearly visible and in the correct relative positions.

    Therefore, B is the correct match.

# The final answer is B, based on the direct comparison of the unique and unchanging coat patterns.
# The key identifying features are the bone-shaped spot and the triangular cluster on the shoulder,
# which are present in both the Target image and image B.
