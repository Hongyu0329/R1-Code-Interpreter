    "My plan is to determine the identity of the substituents at the numbered positions by carefully examining the provided chemical structure of the reaction product. While the reaction mechanism involves a complex series of rearrangements, the final answer can be found by directly inspecting the product molecule as drawn.\n\n1.  **Analyze Position 1:** The label \"1\" points to a substituent on the A/B ring system. This is one of two groups on the same carbon, a gem-dimethyl group. The substituent is a methyl group (CH3).\n2.  **Analyze Position 2:** The label \"2\" points to a substituent at the B/C ring junction. The drawing clearly depicts this as a methyl group (CH3).\n3.  **Analyze Position 3:** The label \"3\" points to a substituent at the B/C ring junction. The carbon at this position is bonded to three other carbon atoms within the ring system. To satisfy carbon's valency of four, the fourth substituent, indicated by the dashed bond, must be a hydrogen atom (H).\n4.  **Analyze Position 4:** The label \"4\" points to a substituent at the C/D ring junction. The drawing clearly shows this is a methyl group (CH3).\n5.  **Analyze Position 5:** The label \"5\" points to a substituent at the C/D ring junction. The drawing clearly shows this is a methyl group (CH3).\n\nI will now generate Python code to print the final answer in the required format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_substituents():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the substituents at the numbered positions\n    in the product molecule based on visual analysis of the provided image.\n    \"\"\"\n    substituents = {\n        1: \"CH3\",\n        2: \"CH3\",\n        3: \"H\",\n        4: \"CH3\",\n        5: \"CH3\"\n    }\n\n    # Format the output string as requested: \"1 = V, 2 = W, 3 = X, 4 = Y, 5 = Z\"\n    output_parts = []\n    for position in sorted(substituents.keys()):\n        substituent = substituents[position]\n        output_parts.append(f\"{position} = {substituent}\")\n    \n    final_answer_string = \", \".join(output_parts)\n    print(final_answer_string)\n\nsolve_substituents()\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = CH3>>>"
