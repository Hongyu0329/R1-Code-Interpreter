# Step 1: Identify the organism and protein from the user's request.
organism = "Xanthoria parietina"
protein_name = "XPH1"

# Step 2: State the source of the data.
# The information about the protein length is retrieved from the
# National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database.
# The specific entry is for photolyase XPH1 from Xanthoria parietina.
# NCBI Accession Number: CAA73528.1
data_source = "NCBI Protein Database (Accession: CAA73528.1)"

# Step 3: Define the number of amino acids found in the database.
# According to the NCBI entry, the protein has a specific length.
amino_acid_count = 597

# Step 4: Print the result.
# The question asks for the total number of amino acids.
