    This function identifies the figure ascending into the chariot on the Greek vase.
    The scene depicted is the apotheosis of a hero, identifiable by these key elements:
    1.  A chariot, used for divine transport.
    2.  The presence of Nike (Victory), indicated by the large wing.
    3.  The hero's ascent from the mortal realm (represented by the fallen figure below).
    This iconography is characteristic of the deification of Herakles.
