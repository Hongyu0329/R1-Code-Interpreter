    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find a point in the pattern around which we can rotate it, and the pattern appears unchanged. The \"order\" of the rotational symmetry is the number of times the pattern looks the same during a full 360-degree rotation.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will visually inspect the provided image to find a center of rotation.\n2.  I will focus on a prominent feature, like the star-like shapes, and count how many identical elements are arranged around its center.\n3.  The number of identical elements arranged around the center will give us the order of the rotational symmetry. For an order 'n', the pattern remains unchanged after a rotation of 360/n degrees.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that explains this process and prints the calculated order of symmetry.\n\n```python\ndef find_rotational_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the rotational symmetry of the provided tiling image.\n\n    By inspecting the tiling, we can identify points of rotational symmetry.\n    Let's focus on the center of one of the prominent star-like motifs.\n\n    1. At the very center of a star, we can see a single point where several\n       orange rhombus shapes meet.\n    2. If we count these rhombi, we find there are exactly 7 of them.\n    3. These 7 rhombi are arranged symmetrically around the central point.\n    4. This means that if we rotate the entire tiling by 360 / 7 degrees\n       around this point, the pattern will look identical.\n    5. The number of times the pattern matches itself in a full 360-degree\n       rotation is 7.\n\n    Therefore, the tiling possesses 7-fold rotational symmetry.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The order of rotational symmetry is the number of times the pattern\n    # repeats in a 360-degree rotation.\n    order_of_symmetry = 7\n    \n    # The angle for each rotation is 360 degrees divided by the order.\n    total_degrees = 360\n    \n    print(\"Analyzing the rotational symmetry of the tiling:\")\n    print(f\"The pattern has a central point around which it repeats.\")\n    print(f\"The number of repeating units around this point is {order_of_symmetry}.\")\n    print(f\"This means the symmetry is {order_of_symmetry}-fold.\")\n    print(f\"The smallest angle of rotation that preserves the pattern is calculated by the equation:\")\n    print(f\"{total_degrees} degrees / {order_of_symmetry} = {total_degrees / order_of_symmetry:.2f} degrees\")\n    print(\"\\nThe rotational symmetry order is:\")\n    print(order_of_symmetry)\n\nfind_rotational_symmetry()\n```\n<<<7>>>"
