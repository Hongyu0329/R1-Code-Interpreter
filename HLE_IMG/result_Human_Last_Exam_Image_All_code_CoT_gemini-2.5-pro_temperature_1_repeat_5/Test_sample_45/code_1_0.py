def find_rotational_symmetry():
    """
    This function analyzes the rotational symmetry of the provided tiling image.

    By inspecting the tiling, we can identify points of rotational symmetry.
    Let's focus on the center of one of the prominent star-like motifs.

    1. At the very center of a star, we can see a single point where several
       orange rhombus shapes meet.
    2. If we count these rhombi, we find there are exactly 7 of them.
    3. These 7 rhombi are arranged symmetrically around the central point.
    4. This means that if we rotate the entire tiling by 360 / 7 degrees
       around this point, the pattern will look identical.
    5. The number of times the pattern matches itself in a full 360-degree
       rotation is 7.

    Therefore, the tiling possesses 7-fold rotational symmetry.
