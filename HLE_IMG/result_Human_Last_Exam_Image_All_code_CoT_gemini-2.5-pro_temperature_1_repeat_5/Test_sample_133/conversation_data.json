    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to identify the unknown compound.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** Locate the cluster of peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) to determine the molecular weight of the compound. Analyze the isotopic pattern of this cluster.\n2.  **Apply the Nitrogen Rule:** Based on the nominal molecular weight (even or odd), determine if the molecule contains an even or odd number of nitrogen atoms.\n3.  **Analyze Isotope Patterns:** Examine the relative intensities of the molecular ion cluster and major fragment clusters to identify the presence and number of specific isotopes, such as chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br).\n4.  **Identify the Base Peak:** Find the most intense peak in the spectrum (relative intensity = 100%). This corresponds to the most stable fragment ion.\n5.  **Analyze Major Fragmentation Pathways:**\n    *   Determine the mass difference between the molecular ion and the base peak.\n    *   Identify other significant fragments and the neutral losses that form them.\n    *   Look for characteristic fragmentation patterns, such as the sequential loss of radicals.\n6.  **Deduce the Molecular Formula:** Combine the information from the molecular weight, nitrogen rule, and isotope analysis to determine a plausible molecular formula (CxHyNz...).\n7.  **Propose a Structure and IUPAC Name:** Based on the molecular formula and the observed fragmentation patterns, propose a chemical structure for the compound and provide its systematic IUPAC name.\n\n### Execution:\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_mass_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided mass spectrum data to identify the unknown compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Mass spectrum data from the table (key fragments)\n    spectrum = {\n        266: 3.22, 264: 12.9, 262: 29.0, 260: 34.8,\n        227: 66.7, 225: 100.0,\n        192: 24.5, 190: 48.4,\n        155: 16.1,\n        143: 27.8\n    }\n    \n    # Atomic masses (integer mass for nominal calculation)\n    atomic_mass = {'H': 1, 'C': 12, 'N': 14, 'O': 16, 'Cl': 35, '37Cl': 37}\n\n    print(\"Step 1 & 2: Analyze Molecular Ion and Nitrogen Rule\")\n    # The highest m/z cluster is at 260, 262, 264, 266.\n    # The peak for the molecule with the lightest isotopes (M) is at m/z 260.\n    M_peak_mz = 260\n    print(f\"The molecular ion peak (M+) with the lightest isotopes appears to be at m/z = {M_peak_mz}.\")\n    # Nitrogen Rule: An even molecular weight implies an even number of nitrogen atoms (usually 0 or 2).\n    print(f\"The nominal mass ({M_peak_mz}) is even, which suggests the compound has 0 or an even number of nitrogen atoms.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyze Isotope Patterns\")\n    # The M+ cluster has peaks at M, M+2, M+4, M+6.
