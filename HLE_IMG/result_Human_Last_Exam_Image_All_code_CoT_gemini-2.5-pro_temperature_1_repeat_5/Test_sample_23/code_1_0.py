# Plan:
# 1. Define all given variables from the problem statement and the table.
# 2. State the main assumption for solving the problem: applying Bernoulli's equation
#    between the tank surface and the manometer.
# 3. Calculate intermediate values like pipe diameter, area, and fluid velocity.
# 4. Calculate all components of the Bernoulli equation: pressure head, kinetic head,
#    elevation head, and head loss (friction + entrance).
# 5. Sum these components to find the total pump head (h_pump).
# 6. Calculate the work of the pump (power in Watts) using the pump head.
# 7. Print each step of the calculation, showing the formulas and the numbers used.

# Step 1: Define variables from the problem
rho = 997  # density of water in kg/m^3
P1 = 1.05e5  # ambient pressure (at tank surface) in N/m^2
P_p = 1.33e5  # manometer absolute pressure in N/m^2
Q = 2.86e-3  # volume flow rate in m^3/s
r = 15.5 / 1000  # pipe radius in meters
L = 14.9  # pipe length in meters
f = 0.004  # Darcy friction factor
K_c = 0.4  # entrance loss coefficient (shrinkage)
g = 9.81  # acceleration due to gravity in m/s^2

# Step 2: State assumptions based on problem interpretation
# Assumption: The elevation difference between the water surface in the tank (z1)
# and the pump/manometer (zp) is 2 m, based on "The amount of water in the tank is 2 meters".
z1_minus_zp = 2.0  # m

# Step 3: Calculate pipe geometric properties and fluid velocity
D = 2 * r  # pipe diameter in m
A = math.pi * r**2  # pipe cross-sectional area in m^2
v = Q / A  # velocity in m/s

# Step 4: Calculate the terms for the extended Bernoulli equation
# Equation: h_pump = (P_p - P1)/(œÅg) + v^2/(2g) + (z_p - z1) + h_loss
pressure_head = (P_p - P1) / (rho * g)
kinetic_head = v**2 / (2 * g)
elevation_head_diff = -z1_minus_zp
friction_loss = f * (L / D) * kinetic_head
entrance_loss = K_c * kinetic_head
total_head_loss = friction_loss + entrance_loss

# Step 5: Calculate the pump head (h_pump)
h_pump = pressure_head + kinetic_head + elevation_head_diff + total_head_loss

# Step 6: Calculate the work of the pump (Power in Watts)
work_pump = h_pump * rho * g * Q

# Step 7: Print the results step-by-step
