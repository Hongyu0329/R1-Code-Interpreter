  Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.

  explanation = """The main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta, which helps distinguish them at a glance, is the nature of the seta (the stalk supporting the spore capsule):

1.  **Grimmia montana**: Possesses a very short and straight seta. This results in the capsule being 'immersed' or 'emergent,' meaning it sits nestled down within the perichaetial leaves (the specialized leaves at the tip of the stem) and does not project outwards.

2.  **Grimmia curviseta**: True to its name, which means 'curved seta,' this species has a prominent seta that is distinctly curved, arcuate, or S-shaped (cygneous). This curved stalk holds the capsule out and often to one side, away from the leaves.

Therefore, the most straightforward way to tell them apart when sporophytes are present is to look for a curved seta (*G. curviseta*) versus an immersed capsule with no visible, curved seta (*G. montana*)."""
