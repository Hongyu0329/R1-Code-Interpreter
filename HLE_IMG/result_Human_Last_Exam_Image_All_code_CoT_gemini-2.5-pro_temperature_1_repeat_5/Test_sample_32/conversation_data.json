    "My plan is to first identify the key botanical characteristics of the sporophytes for both *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* based on established bryological knowledge. The specific epithets (the second part of the scientific name) often provide strong clues. \"Montana\" refers to mountains, while \"curviseta\" literally means \"curved seta.\" I will focus on the seta (the stalk supporting the spore capsule) as the likely point of difference. I will then formulate this explanation into a clear statement. To meet the output requirements, I will embed this explanatory text within a Python script that uses a `print` function.\n\n```python\ndef find_difference():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function explains the key distinguishing feature between the sporophytes of\n  Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n  \"\"\"\n  explanation = \"\"\"The main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta, which helps distinguish them at a glance, is the nature of the seta (the stalk supporting the spore capsule):\n\n1.  **Grimmia montana**: Possesses a very short and straight seta. This results in the capsule being 'immersed' or 'emergent,' meaning it sits nestled down within the perichaetial leaves (the specialized leaves at the tip of the stem) and does not project outwards.\n\n2.  **Grimmia curviseta**: True to its name, which means 'curved seta,' this species has a prominent seta that is distinctly curved, arcuate, or S-shaped (cygneous). This curved stalk holds the capsule out and often to one side, away from the leaves.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward way to tell them apart when sporophytes are present is to look for a curved seta (*G. curviseta*) versus an immersed capsule with no visible, curved seta (*G. montana*).\"\"\"\n  print(explanation)\n\nfind_difference()\n```\n<<<The main difference in the sporophyte that helps distinguish *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is very short and straight, making the capsule appear immersed among the leaves.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
