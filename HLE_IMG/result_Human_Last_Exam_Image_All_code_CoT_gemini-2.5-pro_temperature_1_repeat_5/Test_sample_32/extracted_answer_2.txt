The main difference in the sporophyte that helps distinguish *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is very short and straight, making the capsule appear immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a distinct, curved or S-shaped seta that holds the capsule to the side.
