**Structure of Product A (C14H20N2O3):** A is the product of a three-step sequence: 1) The starting material undergoes decarboxylation to form an azomethine ylide. 2) This ylide undergoes a [3+2] cycloaddition with methyl propiolate to form a primary adduct. 3) This adduct is N-acetylated by acetic anhydride.

**Structure of Product B (C12H14N2O3):** B is formed from the same primary adduct as A. However, instead of being acetylated, the adduct undergoes oxidation (loss of 4 hydrogens and gain of 1 oxygen), likely leading to an aromatized lactam structure.

**Structure of Product C (C11H16N2O3):** C is a side product formed directly from the starting material and acetic anhydride, without involving methyl propiolate. It is a stable mesoionic 1,3-dipole, resulting from an intramolecular condensation reaction where a molecule of acetic acid is eliminated.
