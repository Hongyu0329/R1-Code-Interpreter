    The reaction sequence is:
    1.  Tryptophan is protected with a Cbz group.
    2.  The resulting N-Cbz-Tryptophan is coupled with O-benzylhydroxylamine.
    3.  Both benzyl-type protecting groups (Cbz and O-benzyl) are removed by catalytic hydrogenation.
    
    The final product is Tryptophan where the carboxylic acid has been converted to a hydroxamic acid.
