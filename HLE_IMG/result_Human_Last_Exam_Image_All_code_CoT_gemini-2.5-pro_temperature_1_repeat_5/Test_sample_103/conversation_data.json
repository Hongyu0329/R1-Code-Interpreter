    "This is a complex tactical position. Let's break it down to find the best move for White.\n\n**My thinking process:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial position:** White has a knight on f7 creating major problems for the black king. However, Black has a queen on h4 and a bishop on e4 that create a deadly checkmate threat on g2 (`Qxg2#`). White's move must address this threat while pressing the advantage.\n2.  **Evaluate critical candidate moves:**\n    *   **Moves that lose immediately:** Several moves like `Qxe4` or `Qxd8` ignore the checkmate threat. After either of these moves, Black simply plays `...Qxg2#`, and White loses. These are blunders.\n    *   **A plausible but risky move (`h3`):** The move `h3` attacks the black queen and deals with the immediate `...Qxg2#` threat. This seems logical. However, Black can respond with a bishop sacrifice `...Bf3!`. After `gxf3 Qxh3`, Black has a ferocious attack on the exposed white king. This line is very complicated and dangerous for White.\n    *   **The best move (`Nxd8+`):** This move is the most forceful and effective.\n        *   `1. Nxd8+`: White's knight captures the black rook on d8, delivering a check.\n        *   `1... Kh8`: This is Black's only legal move.\n        *   `2. Qd2!`: This is the crucial follow-up. White's queen moves to defend the g2 square, completely neutralizing Black's checkmate threat.\n        *   `2... Rxd8`: Black is forced to recapture the knight.\n3.  **Conclusion:** After this sequence, the dust settles. White has successfully traded a knight for a rook (this is called \"winning the exchange\"). The immediate threats are gone, and White has a clear material and positional advantage, which should be enough to win the game. While `h3` is a considerable option, `Nxd8+` is better because it forces the sequence and leads to a safer, more decisive advantage without allowing the risky counterplay that `h3` permits.\n\n```python\ndef find_best_chess_move():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the given chess position and explains why Nxd8+ is the best move.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the best move for White in the given position.\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The position is a sharp, tactical battle.
