The structures of the three products are:

*   **Product C:** 1-acetyl-2-(4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid. This is the initial N-acetylation product of the starting material.

*   **Product A:** A dihydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole formed from a [3+2] dipolar cycloaddition. Product C undergoes thermal decarboxylation to form an azomethine ylide, which then reacts with methyl propiolate.

*   **Product B:** A complex tricyclic product resulting from the Michael addition of the starting material to methyl propiolate, followed by an intramolecular cyclization and condensation, eliminating methanol.
