    "Based on the microscopic image provided, here is the classification of the observed microorganism.\n\nThe image shows fungal elements within a tissue sample. My analysis identifies the specific morphological features and the likely type of microorganism. The Python code below will print out a detailed breakdown of this classification.\n\n```python\ndef classify_microorganism_from_image():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the classification of the microorganism based on the provided image.\n    The image shows a stained tissue sample viewed under a light microscope.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"--- Microorganism Classification ---\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n[1. Stain Observation]\")\n    print(\"The sample appears to be stained with Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS).\")\n    print(\" - Fungal elements are stained a bright magenta/purple.\")\n    print(\" - Background host tissue is stained blue/turquoise.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n[2.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Based on the image of a stain viewed under a light microscope, classify what is observed in terms of morphology and type of microorganism\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
