    print("Step 1: Examine the structure of each complex.")
    print("Complex 1: This is a standard heteroleptic Iridium complex, [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+, with two cyclometalating 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligands and one 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy) ligand. It serves as a good benchmark.")
    print("Complex 2: This complex also has two ppy ligands but replaces the simple bpy ligand with a much larger, extended phenanthroline-based ligand.")
    print("Complex 3: This complex modifies both types of ligands compared to Complex 1. It uses 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (dfppy) as the cyclometalating ligand and 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dtbbpy) as the second ligand.\n")

    print("Step 2: Relate structural modifications to stability.")
    print("Two key strategies are commonly used to enhance the stability of such emitters:")
    print("  a) Fluorination: Adding fluorine atoms to the ppy ligand (as in Complex 3's dfppy) strengthens the Iridium-Carbon bond. This makes the complex more resistant to degradation under electrical stress (i.e., it increases its electrochemical stability).")
    print("  b) Steric Hindrance: Adding bulky groups, like the tert-butyl groups on Complex 3's dtbbpy ligand, provides a 'steric shield' around the central Iridium atom. This shield protects the metal center from attack by quenching species (like water) and prevents the complexes from getting too close and causing self-quenching, both of which improve device lifetime.\n")

    print("Step 3: Compare the complexes and conclude.")
    print("Comparing Complex 1, 2, and 3:")
    print("- Complex 1 is the baseline with no special stability-enhancing features.")
    print("- Complex 2 uses a large ligand, but it does not incorporate the specific, proven strategies of fluorination or targeted steric bulk for protection.")
    print("- Complex 3 incorporates BOTH fluorination (on the ppy-type ligand) and steric hindrance (on the bpy-type ligand). This dual-pronged approach is a classic and highly effective method for designing robust and stable emitters.\n")
    
    print("Therefore, Complex 3 is explicitly designed for superior stability compared to the other two complexes.\n")

    # Final Answer
    print("Final Conclusion: LECs based on complex 3 are expected to be more stable due to the combined stabilizing effects of fluorination and bulky steric groups.")
