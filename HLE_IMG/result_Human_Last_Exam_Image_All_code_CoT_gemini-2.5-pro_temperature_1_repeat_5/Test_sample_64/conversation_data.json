    "The image displays a time-lapse sequence (L, M, N) showing the process of **cell lysis** or **bursting** in a filamentous organism, likely a fungus or an oomycete.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of what is happening:\n1.  **Panel L:** Shows a healthy, turgid hyphal cell. The arrowhead points to a septum (the cross-wall between cells).\n2.  **Panel M:** At a later time, a bulge begins to form at the septum indicated by the arrowhead. This suggests that the cell wall at this location is weak and is starting to yield to the internal turgor pressure of the cell.\n3.  **Panel N:** The bulge has expanded significantly, and the cell has ruptured or burst at this weak point. The filament is now bent, and the integrity of the cell is compromised.\n\nThis process occurs when the internal pressure (turgor pressure) of the cell exceeds the strength of its cell wall, leading to a rupture. This can be caused by a weakened cell wall (due to genetic mutations or chemical agents) or excessive water uptake (osmotic stress).\n\n<<<Cell lysis (bursting) at a septum.>>>"
