    print("- Solid lines (left y-axis, OA-OW RDF) show the distribution of water oxygen atoms around the alcohol's oxygen.")
    print("- Dashed lines (right y-axis, OA-HW RDF) show the distribution of water hydrogen atoms around the alcohol's oxygen.")

    print("RDF peaks indicate regions of high probability, signifying structure. Higher peaks mean more structure.")

    print("\n2. Evaluating the Statements:")

    # Statement 1
    print("\nStatement 1: 'Both methanol and ethanol have approximately the same structuring effect...'")
    print("Analysis: The solid purple line (methanol) has a first peak at ~1.9, while the solid green line (ethanol) has a peak at ~1.6. This is a significant difference (~20%). The second peak for methanol is also higher. Therefore, they do not have the same structuring effect.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement 1 is FALSE.")

    # Statement 2
    print("\nStatement 2: 'Ethanol creates a more structured local aqueous environment than methanol...'")
    print("Analysis: As established for statement 1, the RDF peaks for methanol (purple) are consistently higher than for ethanol (green). Higher peaks signify more structure. Thus, methanol creates a more structured environment, not ethanol.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement 2 is FALSE.")

    # Statement 3
    print("\nStatement 3: 'Methanol creates a more structured local aqueous environment than ethanol, seen by the fact that the peaks in the methanol RDFs have a higher magnitude.'")
    print("Analysis: This is a correct observation. The peaks for methanol (purple lines) are visibly higher than for ethanol (green lines) in both the OA-OW (solid) and OA-HW (dashed) RDFs.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement 3 is TRUE.")

    # Statement 4
    print("\nStatement 4: 'Both alcohols induce a similar orientation of water within the first solvation shell.'")
    print("Analysis: Orientation can be inferred from the relative positions of the water oxygen (OW) and hydrogen (HW) peaks. For both methanol and ethanol, the first HW peak (dashed lines, ~1.8 Å) occurs at a shorter distance than the first OW peak (solid lines, ~2.7 Å). This indicates that the alcohol's oxygen is acting as a hydrogen bond acceptor from water in both cases. Since this geometric arrangement is the same, the orientation is similar.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement 4 is TRUE.")

    # Statement 5
    print("\nStatement 5: 'Ethanol creates 3 obvious hydration shells...'")
    print("Analysis: Looking at the solid green line (ethanol OA-OW), there is a sharp first peak (~2.7 Å) and a broad second peak (~4.7 Å). There is no obvious third peak; the function flattens out around the bulk value of 1.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement 5 is FALSE.")

    # Statement 6
    print("\nStatement 6: 'Methanol creates 3 obvious hydration shells...'")
    print("Analysis: The solid purple line (methanol OA-OW) shows two clear peaks. A third peak is not 'obvious'; there is only a very minor ripple after the second peak.")
    print("Conclusion: Statement 6 is FALSE.")

    print("\n3. Final Conclusion:")
    print("The correct statements derived from the plot are 3 and 4.")
    print("Let's review the answer choices:")
    print("A. 2 (False)")

    print("D. 1, 4 (False, True)")
    print("E. 4, 6 (True, False)")
    print("F. 2, 5 (False, False)")
    print("G. 4 (True)")
    print("\nBoth B and G contain individually true statements. However, a comparative plot like this primarily aims to highlight differences. Statement 3, which describes the key difference in structuring between methanol and ethanol, is the most significant conclusion. Statement 4 describes a similarity that is expected for molecules with the same functional group. Therefore, B is the best answer.")
