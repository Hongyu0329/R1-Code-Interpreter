# Plan:
# 1. Identify the base parameter set (n0, delta0, Omega0, kR0) and the missing parameter set by analyzing the plots.
#    - Based on the analysis, the plots {5, 2, 4} form a kR-variation family (kR/2, kR, 2kR) due to their identical energy splitting at k=0 and ordered features (e.g., v(0) slope). This establishes the base plot n0=2.
#    - The remaining plots {1, 3, 6} are variations of delta or Omega.
#    - To explain why plot 6 has an energy splitting at k=0 that appears identical to the base plot, we must choose delta0 and Omega0 such that one of the variations produces a splitting very close to the base.
#    - A good candidate for the base parameters is (delta0, Omega0, kR0) = (4, 1, 5). All are single-digit positive integers.
#    - With this, the base splitting is proportional to sqrt(4^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(17) ~= 4.12.
#    - Plot 3 (high E(0)) corresponds to varying 2*delta0 -> (8, 1, 5), splitting ~ sqrt(8^2+1^2) = sqrt(65) ~= 8.06.
#    - Plot 1 (low E(0)) corresponds to varying delta0/2 -> (2, 1, 5), splitting ~ sqrt(2^2+1^2) = sqrt(5) ~= 2.24.
#    - Plot 6 (medium E(0), looks like base) corresponds to varying Omega0/2 -> (4, 0.5, 5), splitting ~ sqrt(4^2+0.5^2) = sqrt(16.25) ~= 4.03. This is very close to the base splitting of sqrt(17).
#    - This accounts for all 6 plots. The one remaining variation, which is the missing parameter set, is the one for 2*Omega0.
# 2. Determine the parameters of the missing plot.
#    - The missing set is (delta, Omega, kR) = (delta0, 2*Omega0, kR0) = (4, 2, 5).
#    - So, delta* = 4, Omega* = 2, kR* = 5.
# 3. Define the equation for the arithmetic mean of the effective masses.
#    - The condition (m1 + m2)/2 = 0 simplifies to d/dk(k*v(k)) = 0, where v(k) is the group velocity.
# 4. Solve for the smallest positive k, k0*, that satisfies the equation for the missing parameter set.
#    - We will define the function f'(k) = d/dk(k*v(k)) = v(k) + k*v'(k) and find its root numerically.
# 5. Calculate the final result n0 * kR* / k0*.
