    # The image shows a woman holding a large, overflowing arrangement of flowers and fruit.
    # Let's analyze the options:
    # A. red roses - Incomplete. She holds more than just roses.
    # B. fruit and flowers - Correct, but less descriptive.
    # C. a cornucopia of fruit and flowers - This best describes the overflowing abundance.
    #    A cornucopia represents an abundant supply, which matches the visual.
    # D. a teardrop - This is only a small detail of the whole arrangement.
    # E. a moth under glass - Incorrect. Moths are present, but not held under glass.

    # Option C is the most fitting description.
