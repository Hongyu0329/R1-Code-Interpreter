    "The user wants me to analyze a pathology image and provide a diagnosis.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clinical Information:**\n    *   **Patient:** 28-year-old female.\n    *   **Location:** Mass in the sella turcica. The sella turcica is the bony structure at the base of the brain that houses the pituitary gland. A mass in this location is most commonly of pituitary origin.\n    *   **Sample:** Intraoperative crush smear. This is a common technique for rapid intraoperative diagnosis of central nervous system and endocrine tumors.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Pathological Image (Cytology):**\n    *   **Stain:** The image shows cells stained with pink cytoplasm and purple nuclei, which is characteristic of a Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stain.\n    *   **Cell Arrangement:** The cells are arranged in loose, cohesive clusters (syncytia) and as single, stripped nuclei in the background.\n    *   **Cellular Morphology:**\n        *   **Nuclei:** The nuclei are relatively uniform (monotonous), round to oval in shape. The chromatin pattern is finely granular or stippled, often described as a \"salt-and-pepper\" pattern. Nucleoli are not prominent.\n        *   **Cytoplasm:** The cells have a moderate amount of eosinophilic (pink), granular cytoplasm with indistinct cell borders.\n    *   **Background:** The background is granular and somewhat \"dirty\" or proteinaceous.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Formulate a Differential Diagnosis:**\n    *   **Pituitary Adenoma:** The combination of a sellar mass with cytological features of monotonous cells, round/oval nuclei, \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin, and syncytial arrangements is classic for a pituitary adenoma. The presence of many stripped nuclei is also a very common finding in crush preparations of pituitary adenomas due to the fragility of their cytoplasm.\n    *   **Meningioma:** While meningiomas can occur in the sellar region, they typically show whorls, syncytial clusters of cells with more oval, vesicular nuclei and sometimes intranuclear pseudoinclusions. The classic \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin is not a feature of meningioma.\n    *   **Craniopharyngioma:** This tumor would typically show squamous cells, often with calcification and a background of \"wet keratin\" (for the adamantinomatous type) or papillary structures (for the papillary type). These features are absent.\n    *   **Other Neuroendocrine Tumors (e.g., Paraganglioma):** These can look very similar cytologically but are much rarer in this specific location. The clinical context strongly points towards a pituitary origin.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The clinical presentation of a sellar mass in a young adult, combined with the characteristic cytomorphological features of a monotonous population of endocrine cells with \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin, is diagnostic of a pituitary adenoma.\n\nI will now generate the final response. Since the task is a medical diagnosis and not a coding problem, I will provide the diagnosis directly in the required format, skipping the irrelevant code block.\n\n<<<Pituitary adenoma>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
