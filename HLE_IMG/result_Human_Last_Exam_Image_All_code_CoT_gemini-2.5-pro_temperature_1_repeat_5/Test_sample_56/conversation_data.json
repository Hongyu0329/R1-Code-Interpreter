    "This is a surrealist painting that combines indoor and outdoor scenes in a dreamlike way. I will perform a search based on the distinct elements like the sea flowing into a room, books burning in a fireplace, and a hot air balloon outside a window next to a glacier. This will help identify the artwork and its creator. After identifying the artist, I will provide a Python script to print the name.\n\n```python\ndef get_artist_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns the name of the artist who painted the provided image.\n    The painting is \"Exploration of the Sources of the Orinoco River\" (1959).\n    \"\"\"\n    artist = \"Remedios Varo\"\n    return artist\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    artist_name = get_artist_name()\n    print(f\"The artist of the painting is: {artist_name}\")\n```\n<<<Remedios Varo>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Please name the artist of the following painting:\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
