    # Step 1: Analyze the input provided by the user.
    # The input consists of a question about isomers and an image.
    print("Step 1: The provided image is black, and no molecules are shown or described.")
    
    # Step 2: Define the requirements for classifying isomers.
    # To determine if molecules are conformers, constitutional isomers, stereoisomers, or identical,
    # their atomic connectivity and spatial arrangement must be known.
    print("Step 2: To classify the relationship between molecules, their structures are required.")
    
    # Step 3: Evaluate the situation.
    # Since no molecular structures are given, a comparison is impossible.
    print("Step 3: As no molecules are provided, their isomeric relationship cannot be determined.")
    
    # Step 4: Conclude based on the available options.
    # Options (a), (b), (c), and (d) all represent specific relationships that cannot be verified.
    # Option (e) "None of these" is the most suitable answer because the premise of the question (that there are molecules to compare) is not met.
    print("Step 4: Consequently, none of the classifications from (a) to (d) can be selected. The correct option is (e).")
