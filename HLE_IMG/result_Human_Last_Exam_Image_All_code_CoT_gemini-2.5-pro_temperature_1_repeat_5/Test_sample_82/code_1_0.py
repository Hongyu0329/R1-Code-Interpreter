  # The intramolecular Heck reaction proceeds via oxidative addition, migratory insertion,
  # and beta-hydride elimination.
  # 1. Oxidative addition of Pd(0) into the C9-Br bond.
  # 2. Migratory insertion forms the new C5-C9 bond and places the Pd on C4.
  # 3. Beta-hydride elimination removes Pd from C4 and a hydrogen from an adjacent carbon.
  # The adjacent carbons are C3 and C5. Elimination occurs from C3.
  # Therefore, the new double bond is formed between C3 and C4.
