    "This problem requires assigning the stereochemical configuration, (R) or (S), to four specific stereocenters in a reaction scheme. The reaction is an esterification, where an acyl chloride reacts with an alcohol. The configuration of a stereocenter is determined using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to determine the configuration for each center:\n1.  **Identify the Stereocenter**: Locate the carbon atom with four different substituents.\n2.  **Assign Priorities**: Assign priorities (1-4, with 1 being the highest) to the four substituents based on the CIP rules. The primary rule is to rank them by the atomic number of the atom directly bonded to the stereocenter.\n3.  **Determine Configuration**: Orient the molecule so that the lowest priority group (4) points away from the viewer. Then, trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3. If the path is clockwise, the configuration is (R). If it is counter-clockwise, the configuration is (S).\n4.  **Analyze the Reaction's Effect**: The given reaction is an esterification, which occurs at the carbonyl carbon and the alcohol's oxygen. The stereocenters themselves are not directly involved in bond breaking or formation, so their spatial arrangement of substituents is retained. However, a change in a substituent (e.g., -COCl to -COOR') can alter the CIP priority order, which may lead to a change in the R/S designation even though the 3D structure is preserved.\n\nThe following Python script systematically applies this plan to each of the four stereocenters.\n\n```python\ndef solve_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and explains the stereochemical assignment for the four\n    stereocenters in the provided esterification reaction scheme.\n    The four centers are analyzed in order of their appearance from left to right\n    in the reaction image.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the stereochemical assignment for each of the four stereocenters:\")\n    print(\"=\"*70)\n\n    # --- 1.
