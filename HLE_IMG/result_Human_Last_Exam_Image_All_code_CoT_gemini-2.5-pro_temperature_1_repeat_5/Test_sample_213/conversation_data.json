    "This is a classic piece of operatic literature. I can identify it by analyzing the clues in the score.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Language:** The instrument names (`gr. Fl.` for Grosse Flöten, `Hob.` for Hoboe, `Br.` for Bratschen) and musical directions (`Vorhang` for curtain, `mit Dämpfer` for with mute, `die übrigen` for the rest) are in German. This points to an opera written in German.\n2.  **Analyze the Musical Context:** The direction `1 (Vorhang)` indicates that this is the very beginning of a scene where the curtain rises. The prompt states it's the opening of the second act.\n3.  **Analyze the Musical Style:** The orchestration is lush and complex, with shimmering effects in the high woodwinds and strings (indicated by the rapid notes and dynamics like `pp`). The use of `gliss.` (glissando) in the strings is also a notable feature. This style is characteristic of the late Romantic and early 20th-century German repertoire, particularly the works of Richard Strauss.\n4.  **Identify the Specific Piece:** This specific ethereal and magical music is world-famous. It is the introduction to Act II of Richard Strauss's opera *Der Rosenkavalier*. It musically depicts the moment Octavian presents the silver rose to Sophie.\n\nBased on these points, I will write a simple script to output the name of the opera.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the opera based on the provided sheet music.\n    \n    Analysis:\n    1. Language: The markings (\"Vorhang\", \"mit Dämpfer\") and instrument names are German.\n    2. Context: The music is the opening of Act II, as indicated by \"(Vorhang)\" (Curtain).\n    3. Style: The lush, shimmering orchestration is characteristic of Richard Strauss.\n    4. Identification: This specific music is the famous \"Presentation of the Rose\" scene.\n    \"\"\"\n    opera_name = \"Der Rosenkavalier\"\n    print(f\"The sheet music is from the opera: {opera_name}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Der Rosenkavalier>>>"
