    This function identifies the name of the missing reactant in the provided chemical synthesis.

    The synthesis involves two steps:
    1. Friedel-Crafts acylation to form an alpha-bromo ketone.
    2. Cyclocondensation of the alpha-bromo ketone with an unknown reactant to form a substituted imidazole.

    By analyzing the structure of the final product and the intermediate ketone, we can deduce
    the structure and name of the unknown reactant. The reaction requires a guanidine derivative
    that is protected with a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group to yield the specific product shown.
