    "Based on my analysis of the painting's style, subject matter, and the specified time period, I have identified the artwork. The dramatic scene, featuring a windmill against a stormy sky with a fire in the background, is characteristic of a specific 19th-century Romantic painting. I will now provide a Python script to output its title.\n\n```python\ndef get_painting_title():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function stores and prints the title of the identified painting.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The painting is identified as \"The Burning of the Mill\" by the Russian artist Pyotr Petrovich Vereshchagin (1836â€“1886).\n  title = \"The Burning of the Mill\"\n  print(f\"The title of the 19th-century painting is: {title}\")\n\nget_painting_title()\n```\n<<<The Burning of the Mill>>>"
