    Analyzes the expected stability of four Iridium complexes based on their ligand structure.

    The stability, and thus device lifetime, of these cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes
    is significantly enhanced by fluorination of the phenyl ring of the C^N ligand,
    especially at the ortho-position to the Ir-C bond. This substitution blocks a
    key degradation pathway.

    - Complexes with ortho-fluorination are expected to have longer lifetimes.
    - Complexes without ortho-fluorination are expected to have shorter lifetimes.
