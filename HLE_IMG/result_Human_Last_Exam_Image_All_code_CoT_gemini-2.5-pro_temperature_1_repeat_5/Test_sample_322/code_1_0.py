def solve_vortex_problem():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the vortex trajectory analysis problem.

    The analysis is based on identifying the unique vortex in each of the 16 plots.
    The methodology distinguishes between regular and chaotic motion to determine if the unique
    vortex is twice as strong (Uppercase: R, G, B) or half as strong (lowercase: r, g, b).

    - Regular motion implies a dominant vortex (twice strength), which has a more central and stable path.
    - Chaotic motion implies a weaker vortex (half strength), which has a more erratic and expansive path.

    The final sequence is constructed by applying this logic to each plot from 1 to 16.
