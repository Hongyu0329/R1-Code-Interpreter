    "This image displays the emission spectrum of an element. Each colored line represents a specific wavelength of light emitted by the element when it is excited. By comparing this unique pattern of lines to the known spectra of different elements, we can identify it.\n\nI will write a Python script to perform this identification. My plan is as follows:\n1.  Create a small database of prominent spectral lines (in nanometers) for a few common elements like Hydrogen, Helium, and Mercury.\n2.  Visually estimate the wavelengths of the most prominent lines from the provided spectrum image. The spectrum ranges from blue/violet (shorter wavelengths, ~400 nm) on the left to red (longer wavelengths, ~700 nm) on the right.\n3.  Write a function to compare the observed lines with the database and find the best match. The element with the most matching lines will be our answer.\n4.  Print the process and the final identified element.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef identify_element():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies an element by comparing its observed spectral lines\n    to a database of known spectra.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Database of known prominent spectral lines (wavelengths in nm, approximate)\n    spectral_database = {\n        \"Hydrogen\": [410, 434, 486, 656],\n        \"Helium\":   [447, 471, 492, 502, 588, 668],\n        \"Mercury\":  [405, 436, 546, 577, 579],\n        \"Sodium\":   [589, 590]\n    }\n    \n    print(\"--- Known Spectral Lines Database (in nm) ---\")\n    for element, lines in spectral_database.items():\n        print(f\"{element}: {', '.join(map(str, lines))}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 45)\n\n    # Step 2: Visually estimate prominent lines from the image (in nm)\n    # The image shows strong lines in the blue, cyan, green, yellow, and red regions.\n    observed_lines = [447, 492, 502, 588, 668]\n    print(f\"\\nObserved prominent lines from the image (in nm):\")\n    print(f\"Equation: We are looking for the element whose lines match the set {{{', '.join(map(str, observed_lines))}}}\")\n\n\n    # Step 3: Find the best match\n    best_match_element = None\n    highest_score = -1\n    tolerance = 5  # Allow a +/- 5 nm tolerance for matching\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Matching Process ---\")\n    for element, known_lines in spectral_database.items():\n        match_count = 0\n        matched_lines = []\n        for obs_line in observed_lines:\n            for known_line in known_lines:\n                if abs(obs_line - known_line) <= tolerance:\n                    match_count += 1\n                    matched_lines.append(known_line)\n                    break # Count each observed line only once\n        \n        print(f\"Comparing with {element}: Found {match_count}/{len(observed_lines)} matches.\")\n        \n        if match_count > highest_score:\n            highest_score = match_count\n            best_match_element = element\n    \n    # Step 4: Print the result\n    print(\"-\" * 45)\n    if best_match_element:\n        print(f\"\\nConclusion: The pattern of spectral lines most closely matches that of {best_match_element}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nConclusion: Could not identify the element from the database.\")\n\nidentify_element()\n```\n<<<Helium>>>"
