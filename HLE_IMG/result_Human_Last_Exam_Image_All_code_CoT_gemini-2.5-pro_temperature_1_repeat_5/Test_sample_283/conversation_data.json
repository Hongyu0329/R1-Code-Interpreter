    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my analysis and the corresponding Python code to present the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Graph:** I will examine the provided Google Trends graph, focusing on the timing of the recurring peaks for each of the three colored lines (red, yellow, blue).\n2.  **Identify the Events:** The annual nature of the peaks suggests they correspond to holidays or recurring events. I will match the timing of these peaks to well-known historical commemorations.\n    *   **Red Line:** Shows peaks every year in late January. This timing is consistent with **Martin Luther King Jr. Day** in the United States.\n    *   **Yellow Line:** Shows sharp peaks in mid-June, with growing intensity over the years. This strongly correlates with **Juneteenth** (June 19th), which was declared a U.S. federal holiday in 2021, explaining its rising search interest.\n    *   **Blue Line:** Shows distinct peaks every year at the end of May. This matches **Memorial Day** in the United States.\n3.  **Determine the Country:** Since all three holidays—Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Juneteenth, and Memorial Day—are significant federal holidays commemorating key aspects of American history, the country in question is the United States.\n4.  **Generate Code:** I will write a Python script to print this conclusion clearly.\n\n```python\ndef solve_historical_trends():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided Google Trends data to identify the country\n    where three specific historical events are commemorated.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Analysis based on the timing of recurring peaks in the graph\n    event_red_line = \"Martin Luther King Jr. Day (celebrated in late January)\"\n    event_yellow_line = \"Juneteenth (celebrated on June 19th)\"\n    event_blue_line = \"Memorial Day (celebrated on the last Monday of May)\"\n    \n    country = \"United States\"\n    \n    print(\"Analysis of the Google Trends Graph:\")\n    print(f\"1. The red line shows annual peaks in late January, which corresponds to '{event_red_line}'.\")\n    print(f\"2. The yellow line shows sharp annual peaks in mid-June, corresponding to '{event_yellow_line}'.\")\n    print(f\"3. The blue line shows annual peaks at the end of May, corresponding to '{event_blue_line}'.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(f\"These three major historical commemorations are all federal holidays in the {country}.\")\n\nsolve_historical_trends()\n\n```\n<<<United States>>>"
