    "Based on the melody and chord progression, I can identify the jazz standard for you.\n\nThe piece is in the key of F minor. The first few notes of the melody are C, F, G, Ab, C, Eb. The chord progression starts with F-, E-7b5, Eb-6, Dbmaj7. This combination of melodic and harmonic elements is characteristic of a specific well-known jazz composition.\n\nI will provide a Python script to print the title and composer of this tune.\n\n```python\ndef solve_music_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the jazz standard based on its musical characteristics\n    and prints the title and composer.\n\n    The sheet music shows a piece in F minor.\n    - The initial melody is: C, F, G, Ab\n    - The initial chord progression is: F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7\n    These are the defining features of the jazz standard \"Stablemates\".\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Stablemates\"\n    composer = \"Benny Golson\"\n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nsolve_music_puzzle()\n```\n<<<Title: Stablemates, Composer: Benny Golson>>>"
