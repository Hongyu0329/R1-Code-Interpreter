    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the ECG strip, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the ECG Parameters**: The ECG is recorded at a standard speed of 25 mm/sec. The grid on the ECG paper consists of small squares, each 1 mm in width.\n2.  **Calculate Time per Square**: We can calculate the time duration represented by one small square.\n    *   Time per small square = 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n3.  **Identify the Longest R-R Interval**: By visually inspecting the rhythm strip, we look for the greatest distance between two consecutive R-waves (the highest peaks). A significant pause is visible in the fourth strip, starting after the third QRS complex.\n4.  **Measure the Interval**: We measure the distance of this long pause by counting the number of small squares between the peaks of the two R-waves that bound it. Counting carefully, we find the interval spans approximately 42 small squares.\n5.  **Calculate the Interval Duration**: We multiply the number of small squares by the time per square to find the duration of the interval in seconds.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the given parameters from the ECG strip.\npaper_speed_mm_per_sec = 25\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the time represented by one small square (1 mm).\ntime_per_small_square_sec = 1 / paper_speed_mm_per_sec\n\n# Step 3: Measure the longest R-R interval found on the strip in terms of small squares.\n# By visual inspection of the pause in the fourth strip, the distance is measured.\nlongest_interval_in_small_squares = 42\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the longest R-R interval in seconds.\nlongest_rr_interval_sec = longest_interval_in_small_squares * time_per_small_square_sec\n\n# Step 5: Print the result and the calculation.\nprint(\"ECG Analysis for Longest R-R Interval\")\nprint(f\"Paper Speed: {paper_speed_mm_per_sec} mm/sec\")\nprint(f\"Time per small square (1mm): 1 mm / {paper_speed_mm_per_sec} mm/sec = {time_per_small_square_sec} seconds\")\nprint(f\"Longest interval measurement: {longest_interval_in_small_squares} small squares\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the longest R-R interval in seconds:\")\nprint(f\"{longest_interval_in_small_squares} squares * {time_per_small_square_sec} sec/square = {longest_rr_interval_sec:.2f} seconds\")\n```\n<<<1.68>>>"
