    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to determine the sexes of the insects:\n\n1.  **Analyze Image Pair A (*Coelioxys* bees):**\n    *   The insect on the left has a distinctly tapered and pointed abdomen. This is a key feature of female *Coelioxys* bees (cuckoo bees), as they use this specialized ovipositor to pierce the nest cells of their hosts to lay eggs.\n    *   The insect on the right has a more truncated abdomen with visible spines at the tip. This abdominal structure is characteristic of male *Coelioxys*.\n    *   Therefore, the pair is Female, Male (F, M). This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Image Pair B (*Polistes* wasps):**\n    *   A common way to distinguish sexes in many wasps is by their antennae.\n    *   The wasp on the right has long antennae that are noticeably curled at the tips. This is a definitive characteristic of a male.\n    *   The wasp on the left has shorter, straighter antennae, which is typical for a female.\n    *   Therefore, the pair is Female, Male (F, M). This also corresponds to option **4**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Image Pair C (Long-horned bees, likely *Melissodes*):**\n    *   The common name of this group, \"long-horned bees,\" provides a major clue.\n    *   The bee on the left has exceptionally long antennae that extend far back over its body. This is the defining feature of a male in this genus.\n    *   The bee on the right has much shorter antennae, which is characteristic of a female.\n    *   Therefore, the pair is Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   Pair A is option **4**.\n    *   Pair B is option **4**.\n    *   Pair C is option **3**.\n    *   The final answer, formatted as requested, is \"4,4,3\".\n\nI will now generate the Python code to print this result.\n\n```python\n# Based on the analysis of insect sexual dimorphism:\n# Pair A (Coelioxys): The left insect is female (pointed abdomen) and the right is male (spiny abdomen tip). This is F, M, which is option 4.\n# Pair B (Polistes): The left insect is female (shorter antennae) and the right is male (long, curled antennae). This is F, M, which is option 4.\n# Pair C (Melissodes): The left insect is male (very long antennae) and the right is female (shorter antennae). This is M, F, which is option 3.\n\n# Assign the corresponding index to each pair\nindex_A = 4\nindex_B = 4\nindex_C = 3\n\n# Print the indices for A, B, and C, separated by commas\nprint(f\"{index_A},{index_B},{index_C}\")\n```\n<<<4,4,3>>>"
