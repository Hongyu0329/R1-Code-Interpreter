# Based on the analysis of insect sexual dimorphism:
# Pair A (Coelioxys): The left insect is female (pointed abdomen) and the right is male (spiny abdomen tip). This is F, M, which is option 4.
# Pair B (Polistes): The left insect is female (shorter antennae) and the right is male (long, curled antennae). This is F, M, which is option 4.
# Pair C (Melissodes): The left insect is male (very long antennae) and the right is female (shorter antennae). This is M, F, which is option 3.

# Assign the corresponding index to each pair
index_A = 4
index_B = 4
index_C = 3

# Print the indices for A, B, and C, separated by commas
print(f"{index_A},{index_B},{index_C}")
