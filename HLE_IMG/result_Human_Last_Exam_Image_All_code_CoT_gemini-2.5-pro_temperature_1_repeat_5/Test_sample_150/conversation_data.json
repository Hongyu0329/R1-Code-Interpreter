    "Here is my plan to solve the problem step-by-step:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** The first reaction is between benzene and propanoyl chloride in the presence of AlCl₃. This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation, which attaches the propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) to the benzene ring. The product, Intermediate-1, is propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination.** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone) is treated with Br₂ and FeBr₃. The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the benzene ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position. Therefore, a bromine atom is added to the meta position of the phenyl ring. The product, Intermediate-2, is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation.** Intermediate-2 is reacted with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This is a strong reduction condition. It will perform two transformations:\n    *   The ketone group (C=O) is reduced to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is a common reduction for benzylic ketones.\n    *   The aryl-bromide bond (C-Br) is cleaved and replaced with a C-H bond (hydrogenolysis).\n    *   The result is the complete reduction of both functional groups, yielding propylbenzene as Intermediate-3.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Benzylic Bromination.** Intermediate-3 (propylbenzene) is treated with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) and a radical initiator ((PhCO₂)₂). NBS is a specific reagent used for the bromination of the position adjacent to a double bond or an aromatic ring (the allylic or benzylic position). In propylbenzene (C₆H₅-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃), the benzylic position is the -CH₂- group attached directly to the phenyl ring. One of the benzylic hydrogens is replaced by a bromine atom.\n\n5.  **Final Product Identification.** The final product is (1-bromopropyl)benzene. I will write a Python script to print out the name of the final product and the intermediates, tracing the transformation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef track_reaction_and_identify_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function tracks the chemical transformations through the multi-step synthesis\n    to identify the name of each intermediate and the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation\n    intermediate_1 = \"Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one)\"\n    print(f\"Step 1 produces Intermediate-1: {intermediate_1}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination\n    intermediate_2 = \"1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\"\n    print(f\"Step 2 produces Intermediate-2: {intermediate_2}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation (Reduction)\n    intermediate_3 = \"Propylbenzene\"\n    print(f\"Step 3 produces Intermediate-3: {intermediate_3}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Benzylic Bromination\n    final_product = \"(1-Bromopropyl)benzene\"\n    print(f\"Step 4 produces the Final Product: {final_product}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Identification ---\")\n    print(f\"The name of the final product is {final_product}.\")\n    print(\"The number '1' in the name indicates that the bromine atom is on the first carbon of the propyl chain, which is the carbon attached to the benzene ring.\")\n\ntrack_reaction_and_identify_product()\n```\n<<<(1-Bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
