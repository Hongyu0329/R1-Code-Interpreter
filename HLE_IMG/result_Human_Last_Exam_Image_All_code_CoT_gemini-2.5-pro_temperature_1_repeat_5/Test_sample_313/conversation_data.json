    "Here is my thinking process to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Riddle:** The second clue states, \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This is a classic piece of trivia. The process of making felt for hats, known as \"carroting,\" historically used mercuric nitrate. This exposure led to mercury poisoning among hat makers, causing neurological damage and giving rise to the expression \"mad as a hatter.\" Therefore, the object referred to by the riddle is a **Felt Hat**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Image and First Clue:** The first clue states, \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n    *   The image shows an awards ceremony. A reverse image search or recognizing the individuals reveals the event is the 2019 NHL Awards. The man on the right receiving the award is hockey player Nikita Kucherov, and the man presenting is NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman.\n    *   The date of the ceremony was actually June 19, 2019, but the one-day difference is likely a minor inaccuracy in the prompt.\n    *   The key is to connect the NHL (National Hockey League) to a \"Felt Hat.\"\n\n3.  **Connect the Clues:** In hockey, when a player scores three goals in a single game, it's called a \"hat trick.\" It is a long-standing tradition for fans to celebrate this achievement by throwing their hats onto the ice.\n    *   Therefore, the NHL Awards ceremony (the event pictured) is intrinsically linked to the concept of \"hats\" through the \"hat trick\" tradition.\n    *   The clue \"Felt Hat is pictured...\" is used in a figurative sense. The event *represents* a sport where hats (and by extension, felt hats) play a symbolic role.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** \"X Y\" refers to \"Felt Hat\".\n    *   Clue 1 is satisfied: The concept of a \"hat\" is represented at the pictured hockey awards ceremony.\n    *   Clue 2 is satisfied: The physical \"felt hat\" is no longer made using mercury salts due to their toxicity.\n\nBased on this reasoning, I will provide a Python script to output the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves the riddle by identifying the two-word phrase 'X Y'.\n    \n    Clue 1: 'X Y' is pictured (represented) at the 2019 NHL Awards. In hockey, a 'hat trick'\n              is a major achievement celebrated by fans throwing hats onto the ice.\n    \n    Clue 2: 'Another X Y' refers to the physical object, the 'Felt Hat', which was historically\n              made using toxic mercury salts, a practice now ceased.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The two words of the answer\n    word_x = \"Felt\"\n    word_y = \"Hat\"\n    \n    # Combine the words to form the final answer\n    answer = f\"{word_x} {word_y}\"\n    \n    print(f\"The answer to the riddle 'X Y' is: {answer}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Felt Hat>>>"
