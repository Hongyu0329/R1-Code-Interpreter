    "My plan is to first identify the chemical structure provided in the image. I will analyze its key features, such as the ring system, functional groups, and stereochemistry. Based on this analysis, I will determine the common name of this alkaloid compound. Finally, I will write a simple Python script to print out the name, as per the instructions.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to identify the alkaloid compound from the image.\n# 1. Analyze the structure: The image shows a polycyclic compound with four rings (tetracyclic).\n# 2. Identify functional groups: It contains two nitrogen atoms and a carbonyl group (C=O) within a ring, which makes it a lactam (a cyclic amide).\n# 3. Identify the compound: This specific structure is a well-known quinolizidine alkaloid.\n# 4. Determine the name: The common name for this compound is Matrine.\n# 5. This script will print the identified name.\n\ncompound_name = \"Matrine\"\nprint(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n```\n<<<Matrine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
