    "This image shows the knot known as $9_{42}$ in the Rolfsen/Alexander-Briggs notation. To find its Jones polynomial, we can consult a knot theory database or use specialized software. The Jones polynomial is a knot invariant, meaning it's the same for all diagrams of the same knot. For the $9_{42}$ knot, the Jones polynomial $V(t)$ is well-known.\n\nThe plan is to:\n1.  Identify the knot in the image as the $9_{42}$ knot.\n2.  Retrieve the standard Jones polynomial for this knot.\n3.  Write a Python script to format and print the polynomial in decreasing order of degree, as requested.\n\nThe Jones polynomial for the $9_{42}$ knot is:\n$V(t) = t^4 - t^3 + t^2 - t + 1 - t^{-1} + t^{-2} - t^{-3} + t^{-4}$\n\nThe following Python code will print this polynomial term by term to construct the final expression.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef format_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function generates and prints the Jones polynomial for the 9_42 knot.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The Jones polynomial for knot 9_42 is represented by a list of (coefficient, power) tuples.\n    # V(t) = t^4 - t^3 + t^2 - t + 1 - t^-1 + t^-2 - t^-3 + t^-4\n    terms = [\n        (1, 4),\n        (-1, 3),\n        (1, 2),\n        (-1, 1),\n        (1, 0),\n        (-1, -1),\n        (1, -2),\n        (-1, -3),\n        (1, -4)\n    ]\n\n    poly_str = \"\"\n\n    for i, (coeff, power) in enumerate(terms):\n        # Determine the sign prefix for the term\n        sign = \"\"\n        if i > 0:\n            if coeff > 0:\n                sign = \" + \"\n            else:\n                sign = \" - \"\n        elif coeff < 0:\n            sign = \"-\"\n\n        # Get the absolute value of the coefficient\n        abs_coeff = abs(coeff)\n\n        # Format the coefficient part of the term\n        coeff_str = \"\"\n        if abs_coeff != 1 or power == 0:\n            coeff_str = str(abs_coeff)\n\n        # Format the variable part of the term\n        var_str = \"\"\n        if power != 0:\n            if power == 1:\n                var_str = \"t\"\n            else:\n                var_str = f\"t^{{{power}}}\" # Using curly braces for clarity\n\n        # Combine the parts of the term\n        if power == 0:\n            term_str = coeff_str\n        elif coeff_str and var_str:\n            term_str = f\"{coeff_str}{var_str}\"\n        else:\n            term_str = var_str\n            \n        poly_str += sign + term_str\n\n    # Print the final formatted polynomial string\n    # Replace curly braces with standard characters for the final output\n    print(poly_str.replace(\"{\", \"\").replace(\"}\", \"\"))\n\nformat_polynomial()\n```\n<<<$t^4 - t^3 + t^2 - t + 1 - t^{-1} + t^{-2} - t^{-3} + t^{-4}$>>>"
