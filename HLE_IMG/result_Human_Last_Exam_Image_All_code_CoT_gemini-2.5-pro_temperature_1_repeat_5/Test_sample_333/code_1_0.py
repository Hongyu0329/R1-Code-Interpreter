def solve_airfoil_matching():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the airfoil matching problem based on aerodynamic principles.

    The matching is determined as follows:
    - Airfoils are grouped into symmetrical (A, B, C, D) and cambered (E, F, G, H).
    - Pressure plots are grouped by lift (area): high lift (1, 3, 4, 5) and low lift (2, 6, 7, 8).
    - Cambered airfoils are matched to high-lift plots based on camber amount (more camber = more lift).
      - E (most camber) -> 5 (most lift)
      - F -> 1
      - G -> 3
      - H (least camber) -> 4 (least lift)
    - Symmetrical airfoils are matched to low-lift plots based on thickness (thinner = sharper leading edge = higher suction peak).
      - A (thickest) -> 8 (lowest peak)
      - B -> 2
      - C -> 7
      - D (thinnest) -> 6 (highest peak)

    The final sequence corresponds to airfoils A through H.
