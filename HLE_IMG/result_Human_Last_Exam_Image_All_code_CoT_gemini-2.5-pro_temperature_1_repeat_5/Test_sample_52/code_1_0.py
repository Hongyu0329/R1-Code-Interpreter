def solve_tiling_periods():

    This function provides the periods of the tilings for the four shapes described.
    The reasoning is based on geometric analysis and area calculations on an idealized hexagonal grid.
    - Period 1: The triangle of centers forms a parallelogram tile with an area of 1 hexagon (6 units).
    - Period 2: The quadrilateral forms a rectangular tile with an area of 1 hexagon (6 units).
    - Period 3: The irregular polygon forms a symmetric super-tile with an area of 1 hexagon (6 units).
    - Period 4: The large, complex polygon is hypothesized to have a tiling period equal to the area of 2 hexagons (12 units).
