    "Based on the melody and chord progression shown in the sheet music, the song can be identified. The opening melodic phrase and the C -> E7 -> F chord sequence are characteristic of a famous Latin American piece.\n\nHere is my analysis:\n1.  **Song Identification:** The first few bars of the melody are E-G-A-G | E-G-A-G over a C major chord, followed by G#-B-C-B | G#-B-C-B over an E7 chord. This is the unmistakable opening of the song \"Moliendo Café\" (meaning \"Grinding Coffee\").\n2.  **Musical Style:** The song was originally composed as a *joropo*, a musical style and dance from Venezuela. However, it has become a massive international hit and is frequently performed in various other Latin styles, such as *cumbia* and *salsa*. \"Latin\" is a good general classification, with *joropo* being the specific original style.\n3.  **Country of Origin:** The song was written in 1958 by Venezuelan composer Hugo Blanco. Therefore, its country of origin is Venezuela.\n\nThis Python script will print the identified information for you.\n\n```python\ndef print_song_details():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function prints the title, musical style, and country of origin\n  of the song identified from the sheet music.\n  \"\"\"\n  title = \"Moliendo Café\"\n  style = \"Latin (Joropo)\"\n  origin = \"Venezuela\"\n\n  print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n  print(f\"Musical Style: {style}\")\n  print(f\"Country of Origin: {origin}\")\n\nprint_song_details()\n```\n<<<Title: Moliendo Café, Musical Style: Latin (Joropo), Country of Origin: Venezuela>>>"
