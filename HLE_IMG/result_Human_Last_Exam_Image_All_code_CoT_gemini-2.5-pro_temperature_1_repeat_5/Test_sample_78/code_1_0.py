    # Mutant allele: Cut by the enzyme into two smaller fragments.
    
    # NOTE: A search for the SfaNI site 'GCATC' (or its reverse complement 'GATGC') in the
    # provided WT sequence with the C->A mutation at position 164 does not reveal a site.
    # This suggests a possible typo in the provided ORF sequence.
