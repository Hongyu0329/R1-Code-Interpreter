    Analyzes the provided image to determine the strongest connections for area PGp.

    # Step 1: Identify the correct plot in the image.
    # The question is about the connectivity of area PGp. We focus on the bottom-right polar plot labeled "PGp".

    # Step 2: Interpret the plot to find the strongest connections.
    # Connectivity strength is represented by how far a colored spike extends from the center.
    # We look for the longest spikes in the PGp plot.

    # Step 3: Identify the labels corresponding to the longest spikes.
    # The plot shows three exceptionally long spikes, all located in the "Insula" section.
    # Tracing these spikes to their labels on the axis, we identify them as:
    # 1. Id1 (Insular area Id1)
    # 2. Ig2 (Insular area Ig2)
    # 3. Ig1 (Insular area Ig1)
    # These three areas show significantly higher connectivity strengths compared to all other areas listed.

    # Step 4: Compare this finding with the given answer choices.
    # Choice A: Incorrect. Connections are in the Insula, not temporal/orbitofrontal/occipital.
    # Choice B: Incorrect. Ig1/Ig2 are stronger than the other listed areas.
    # Choice C: Incorrect. Ig1/Ig2 are stronger than temporal poles/BA45.
    # Choice D: Incorrect. Ig1 is a much stronger connection than BA45.
    # Choice E: Incorrect. These are all relatively weak connections.
    # Choice F: Incorrect. Orbitofrontal connection is weak.
    # Choice G: Correct. This choice lists the three most strongly connected areas: Id1, Ig2, and Ig1.

    conclusion = "Based on the visual analysis of the PGp polar plot, the three areas with the highest connectivity strength are Id1, Ig2, and Ig1, all located in the insular cortex. This corresponds to option G."
    
    print(conclusion)
    
    # The final answer is G
    final_answer = "G"
    
    # The following line is for the final output as requested by the user prompt format.
