    Analyzes the provided image of six knots and identifies which are isotopic to the unknot.

    The analysis of each knot is as follows:
    - K_1: This is the Stevedore knot (6_1), which is not an unknot.
    - K_2: This is a complicated diagram of the unknot. It can be simplified to a crossing-less loop through a series of Reidemeister moves.
    - K_3: This is a simple twisted loop that can be undone with a single Reidemeister I move. It is an unknot.
    - K_4: This is the figure-eight knot (4_1), a non-trivial knot.
    - K_5: This knot is isotopic to the figure-eight knot (K_4) and is therefore not an unknot.
    - K_6: This is the cinquefoil knot (5_1), which is not an unknot.

    Therefore, the knots isotopic to the unknot are K_2 and K_3.
