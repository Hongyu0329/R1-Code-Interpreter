    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Instrumentation and Language:** The instrument names are abbreviated in German: \"gr. Fl.\" for *große Flöten* (flutes), \"Hob.\" for *Oboe*, \"engl. Horn\" for English horn, \"Fag.\" for *Fagott* (bassoon), \"Br.\" for *Bratsche* (viola), and \"Celli\" for cellos. Other markings are also in German, such as \"(die übrigen)\" meaning \"the rest\", \"(mit Dämpfer)\" meaning \"with mute\", and \"(Vorhang)\" meaning \"curtain\". This strongly indicates the opera is by a German or Austrian composer.\n\n2.  **Musical Style:** The music is highly chromatic and lacks a traditional key signature, which is characteristic of atonal or dodecaphonic (twelve-tone) music from the early 20th century. The harmonies are dense and dissonant. This style is closely associated with the composers of the Second Viennese School, particularly Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg, and Anton Webern. The lush, detailed orchestration and dramatic expression also align with this period.\n\n3.  **Structural Clues:** The score is marked with a large number \"1\" followed by \"(Vorhang)\". This indicates rehearsal mark number 1, at which point the curtain rises. The question states this is the opening of the second act. The music before rehearsal mark 1 serves as the prelude to this act.\n\n4.  **Identification:** Based on the combination of German text, atonal/expressionistic musical style, large orchestration, and its specific position as the opening to the second act, we can identify the work. This particular musical passage, with its shimmering, high string chords and the sinuous solo viola line, is famously the opening of Act II of Alban Berg's opera *Wozzeck*. The scene depicts Marie in her room, admiring a pair of earrings given to her by the Drum-Major, setting the stage for the tragedy that unfolds.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** By combining the evidence from the language, musical style, and structural context, the opera is definitively identified as *Wozzeck* by Alban Berg.\n\n<<<Wozzeck>>>"
