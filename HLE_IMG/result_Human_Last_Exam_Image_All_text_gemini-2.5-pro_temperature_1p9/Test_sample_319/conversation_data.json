    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual information in the image.**\nThe image displays two plots representing an auditory signal.\n*   The top plot is a spectrogram, which shows the intensity of different frequencies over time. We can see a single, stable frequency (a thin horizontal line), representing a pure tone. This tone is interrupted in the middle by a brief, broad-spectrum sound (a vertical band), which could be a burst of noise or a cough. During this interruption, the line representing the pure tone is physically absent.\n*   The bottom plot is the corresponding waveform. On the left, it shows a smooth, regular oscillation (a sine wave), characteristic of a pure tone. In the middle, the waveform becomes complex and irregular, corresponding to the noise burst. On the right, the smooth sine wave resumes.\nCrucially, both plots show that the pure tone *stops*, is replaced by noise, and then *starts again*. There is a physical discontinuity in the tone.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the textual description of the phenomenon.**\nThe text provides several key clues:\n*   It's an **illusion**. This means what is perceived is different from the physical reality presented.\n*   It's compared to the **Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity**. The Necker Cube is a 2D drawing that our brain interprets as a 3D cube, but it can be perceived in two different, equally valid orientations. Our perception flips between these states. This comparison suggests the illusion involves the brain making an interpretation or \"filling in\" ambiguous or missing sensory information to create a coherent whole.\n*   It reveals a **\"surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability.\"** This indicates it's a fundamental brain process that happens automatically in everyday life, likely to help us navigate our environment.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the visual and textual information.**\nCombining the clues, we can deduce the nature of the illusion. The physical stimulus is \"tone-noise-tone\". The illusion is that a listener does not perceive the tone as stopping. Instead, the brain \"fills in\" the gap, and the listener perceives the tone as continuing uninterrupted *behind* the burst of noise. This perceptual \"filling-in\" or \"completion\" is the unconscious ability mentioned, which is vital, for example, in understanding a conversation in a noisy room where parts of words might be masked by other sounds.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the scientific name for this phenomenon.**\nThis specific auditory illusion is a well-documented psychoacoustic phenomenon.\n*   The effect was famously studied and named by Richard M. Warren in 1970.\n*   In his key experiments, he took a recorded sentence and replaced one of the phonemes (a basic sound unit of speech) with a non-speech sound like a cough or a burst of static.\n*   He found that listeners not only perceived the sentence as intact but were often unable to even identify which specific sound had been replaced. Their brains \"restored\" the missing phoneme.\n*   This phenomenon was named the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**.\n*   The principle applies more broadly to non-speech sounds as well (like the tone in the image), where it is sometimes called the \"auditory continuity illusion\" or \"temporal induction.\" However, the Phonemic Restoration Effect is the most famous and widely cited name for this type of perceptual completion, highlighting its crucial role in speech perception.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe image provides a schematic illustration of the physical stimulus for an auditory illusion. The textual description points to a perceptual completion effect that is common and unconscious. This perfectly matches the description of the Phonemic Restoration Effect.\n\n<<<Phonemic Restoration Effect>>>"
