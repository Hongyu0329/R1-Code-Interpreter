    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key**\nThe key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). This indicates either E♭ major or C minor. The \"Pathetique\" Sonata is famously in C minor. This is confirmed by the harmonic language of the piece. Therefore, our analysis will be in the key of C minor.\n\n**Step 2: Locate and Identify the Notes in Measure 30**\n*   **Location:** Measure 30 is the third measure in the second system of the provided sheet music. It is circled in the main image. The measure starts after the bar line following measure 29.\n*   **Time Signature:** The piece is in Alla Breve (2/2 time), meaning there are two half-note beats per measure.\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays broken octaves on the note G (G2 and G3) for the entire measure. This firmly establishes G as the bass note and the likely root of the chord.\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The right hand plays a rapid passage of sixteenth notes. The notes are:\n    *   Beat 1: G4, B-natural4, C-sharp5, E-natural5.\n    *   Beat 2: D5, F-sharp5, G5, B-natural5.\n    *   Note the accidentals: the natural signs on B and E cancel the key signature's B♭ and E♭. The sharps on C and F are also explicit accidentals.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Harmony**\n1.  **Identify the Chord Root:** With G sustained in the bass for the whole measure, the chord is built on G. In the key of C minor, G is the fifth scale degree (the dominant).\n2.  **Identify the Chord Quality:** We need to find the third and fifth of the chord from the notes present.\n    *   The right hand plays B-natural multiple times. The interval from the root G to B-natural is a major third. This is expected for a dominant chord in a minor key, as it uses the leading tone (the raised 7th degree of the harmonic minor scale).\n    *   The note D appears on the first sixteenth note of beat 2. The interval from G to D is a perfect fifth.\n    *   Together, the notes G (bass), B-natural, and D spell out a **G major triad**.\n3.  **Consider the Other Notes:** The notes C♯, E♮, and F♯ do not belong to a standard G major or G dominant 7th chord. In such a fast, virtuosic passage, these are best understood as non-chord tones:\n    *   The F♯ acts as a chromatic lower neighbor to the G.\n    *   The C♯ and E♮ are chromatic passing tones that create tension and embellish the underlying harmony.\n    *   The core, structural harmony of the measure is a G major triad.\n4.  **Contextual Analysis:**\n    *   The preceding measure (m. 29) contains a D dominant 7th chord (D-F♯-A-C). This chord is the V7 of G, often written as V7/V in the key of C minor. It strongly prepares a resolution to a G chord.\n    *   The following measure (m. 31) begins with a C minor chord in first inversion (notes E♭, G, C). This is the tonic chord (i⁶).\n    *   The progression V7/V (m. 29) → V (m. 30) → i⁶ (m. 31) is a very strong and logical harmonic progression.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Roman Numeral**\n*   **Root:** The chord root is G, the 5th degree of C minor.\n*   **Quality:** The chord is a major triad (G-B♮-D).\n*   **Roman Numeral:** A major triad built on the fifth degree of the scale is the **dominant chord**, represented by a capital Roman numeral V.\n\nTherefore, the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 is V.\n\n<<<V>>>"
