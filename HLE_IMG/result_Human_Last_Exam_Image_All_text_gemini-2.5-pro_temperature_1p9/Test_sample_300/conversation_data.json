    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each of the 9 artworks.\n\n**Analysis of each artwork:**\n\n*   **Artwork 1 (Top-left):**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is a Chinese ink and color painting on paper depicting three women in elaborate ethnic minority costumes. The style blends meticulous detail in the faces (\"Gongbi\" technique) with expressive, fluid brushwork for the clothing.\n    *   **Signature/Seal:** A signature and red seal are present in the top right corner.\n    *   **Identification:** This style, particularly the subject matter of ethnic minorities from remote regions rendered with a blend of academic realism and traditional ink techniques, is characteristic of **Tang Yongli (唐勇力)**. This specific painting is one of his famous works, often titled \"Song of the Highland\" (高原之歌).\n\n*   **Artwork 2 (Top-center):**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is a black ink painting on paper, showing an abstract landscape. The artist uses energetic, calligraphic lines to form highly simplified and abstracted structures, likely buildings, nestled within a mountain landscape.\n    *   **Signature/Seal:** No visible signature or seal.\n    *   **Identification:** This style of abstracting real-world landscapes into a rhythmic composition of points, lines, and planes is a hallmark of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**. He was a master at fusing Western modernism with traditional Chinese ink painting.\n\n*   **Artwork 3 (Top-right):**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is a work of Chinese calligraphy in a highly dynamic and individualistic cursive script (草书). The characters are powerful and unrestrained.\n    *   **Signature/Seal:** There is a red seal in the middle-right which, along with the distinctive style, identifies the author.\n    *   **Identification:** The unique and powerful cursive script is instantly recognizable as that of **Mao Zedong (毛泽东)**, whose calligraphy is widely known and studied.\n\n*   **Artwork 4 (Middle-left):**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is another piece of Chinese calligraphy, in a flowing semi-cursive script. The brushwork is confident and robust.\n    *   **Signature/Seal:** There are red seals at the beginning and end. The signature at the end clearly contains the characters \"悲鸿\" (Bēihóng).\n    *   **Identification:** \"Beihong\" is the name of the renowned artist **Xu Beihong (徐悲鸿)**. While famous for his ink paintings of horses, he was also a masterful calligrapher, and this work is consistent with his known calligraphic style.\n\n*   **Artwork 5 (Middle-center):**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is a highly realistic oil painting. It portrays a young woman with short hair in a white t-shirt, holding a sketchbook and pen, standing before what appears to be a large, stylized painting. The style is a form of romantic realism.\n    *   **Signature/Seal:** No signature is visible in this crop.\n    *   **Identification:** This is one of the most famous and iconic works of modern Chinese art. It is titled \"Youth\" (青春) and was painted by **Chen Yifei (陈逸飞)**, a leading figure in Chinese realist painting.\n\n*   **Artwork 6 (Middle-right):**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is a color ink painting depicting a woman, likely an opera singer or ethnic minority figure, with a large, stylized headdress. The composition is nearly square, and the style combines a delicately rendered face with expressive, semi-abstract forms in the background and clothing.\n    *   **Signature/Seal:** No signature is visible.\n    *   **Identification:** The fusion of Chinese and Western art techniques, the distinctive square composition, and the melancholic, elegant female figures are the signature traits of **Lin Fengmian (林风眠)**, a pioneer of modern Chinese painting.\n\n*   **Artwork 7 (Bottom-left):**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is a vibrant color painting of a rural courtyard scene. It features hanging laundry, a flowering loofah gourd vine, and a basket of chicks. The style uses bright colors and transforms the scene into a decorative pattern of lines and color blocks.\n    *   **Signature/Seal:** A signature and seal are visible on the right side. The signature reads \"吴冠中\" (Wu Guanzhong). A date, \"一九七九\" (1979), is written on the left.\n    *   **Identification:** The subject matter (Chinese rural life), the distinctive stylistic abstraction, and the clear signature all confirm this work is by **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**.\n\n*   **Artwork 8 (Bottom-center):**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is a Chinese landscape (Shanshui) painting in ink and color. It depicts a majestic river gorge with sheer cliffs and a fleet of boats with red sails. The artist uses heavy, layered ink to create a sense of weight, texture, and dramatic atmosphere.\n    *   **Signature/Seal:** No signature is visible.\n    *   **Identification:** The powerful composition, the technique of building up landscapes with layers of dark ink (known as \"积墨\"), and the focus on monumental, epic landscapes are the unmistakable trademarks of **Li Keran (李可染)**, one of the most important landscape painters of the 20th century.\n\n*   **Artwork 9 (Bottom-right):**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is an ink and light wash painting of a single lobster. The brushwork is minimal yet masterfully captures the essence and translucent quality of the creature's shell.\n    *   **Signature/Seal:** A red seal is visible in the upper right corner, reading \"白石\" (Báishí).\n    *   **Identification:** **Qi Baishi (齐白石)** is celebrated for his charming and vivid paintings of humble subjects, especially shrimp, crabs, and insects. This painting of a lobster, combined with the \"Baishi\" seal, confidently identifies the artist as Qi Baishi.\n\nBased on this analysis, the authors are:\n\n1.  **Top Row (left to right):** Tang Yongli, Wu Guanzhong, Mao Zedong\n2.  **Middle Row (left to right):** Xu Beihong, Chen Yifei, Lin Fengmian\n3.  **Bottom Row (left to right):** Wu Guanzhong, Li Keran, Qi Baishi\n\n<<<Tang Yongli, Wu Guanzhong, Mao Zedong, Xu Beihong, Chen Yifei, Lin Fengmian, Wu Guanzhong, Li Keran, Qi Baishi>>>"
