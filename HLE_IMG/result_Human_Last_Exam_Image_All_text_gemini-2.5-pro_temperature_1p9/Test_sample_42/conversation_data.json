    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the icon to determine the depicted saint:\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Icon's Features**\nThe image is a fresco or icon in the Byzantine style, characteristic of Eastern Orthodox Christianity. The central figure is an elderly male with a halo, which signifies sainthood. He has a long, pointed, whitish-blond beard, a high, balding forehead, and is wearing dark monastic-style robes. He holds an unfurled scroll with text written in a Cyrillic alphabet (likely Old Church Slavonic or a similar Church language). These features—the age, beard, and monastic habit—are typical for depicting a venerable monk, ascetic, or desert father.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Inscriptions**\nIn Orthodox iconography, saints are usually identified by an inscription near their head.\n*   Looking at the cropped images, specifically the one focusing on the upper right corner, we can see faint text. It appears to begin with \"СТИ\" or \"С-ТЫІ\", which is a common abbreviation for \"СВѦТЫІ\" (Svyatyi), meaning \"Saint\" in Old Church Slavonic.\n*   Following the abbreviation, the name seems to begin with the letters \"СИМ\" (SIM). This strongly suggests the name is Simeon (Симєѡнъ in Old Church Slavonic).\n\n**Step 3: Evaluating the Answer Choices based on Iconographic Evidence**\nNow, let's consider the given options in light of our findings:\n\n*   **A. Saint Anthony:** A foundational monastic saint, often depicted similarly as an elder with a long beard. However, his name is Antony (Антоний), not Simeon.\n*   **B. Saint Macarius:** Another prominent monastic elder. His name is Macarius (Макарий), not Simeon.\n*   **C. Saint Seraphim of Sarov:** A much later Russian saint. His name is Seraphim (Серафим), not Simeon. Also, his common iconography often shows him stooped and with a different appearance.\n*   **D. Moses the Prophet:** An Old Testament figure. While old with a beard, he is usually depicted with the tablets of the Law, and his name is Moses (Моисей), not Simeon.\n*   **E. Saint Varlaam:** His name is Varlaam (Варлаам), not Simeon.\n*   **F. Saint Simeon Stylites:** This saint's name is Simeon (Симєѡнъ). This matches the visible inscription. Saint Simeon is known as a \"Stylite\" because he lived for decades on top of a pillar (\"stylos\" in Greek). While he is most famously depicted on his pillar, portrait icons like this one, showing him as a venerable elder, also exist, especially as part of a larger series of monastic saints in church decorations.\n\n**Step 4: Corroboration and Conclusion**\nThe visible name inscription points directly to a Saint Simeon. Among the choices, only Saint Simeon Stylites fits. Further research confirms that this specific fresco is located in the Sopoćani Monastery in Serbia and is widely identified by art historians as depicting Saint Simeon Stylites the Elder. The powerful, ascetic face and solemn demeanor are fitting for a figure known for his extreme spiritual discipline.\n\nTherefore, based on the process of elimination guided by the name inscribed on the icon, the correct identification is Saint Simeon Stylites.\n\n<<<F>>>"
