*   **Product A:** A is methyl 2-(acetyl(2-(4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidin-1-yl)amino)-3-(1-acetyl-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)propanoate. This structure is very complex, reflecting the multistep reaction. A more direct interpretation that fits the main spectroscopic features is the following structure: A methyl acrylate derivative where the nitrogen of the starting material's pyrrolidine ring, after decarboxylation, has added to methyl propiolate. The amidine linkage is hydrolyzed to an amide, and the nitrogen is acetylated. 
    The structure of A is: `Methyl 3-(acetyl(1-(4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidin-2-yl)amino)acrylate`. The formation involves the Michael addition of the N from the pyrrolidine onto the methyl propiolate followed by N-acetylation and other rearrangements. A structure that fully matches the spectroscopic data would be a dihydropyridine derivative obtained from the Huisgen cycloaddition pathway followed by hydrolysis of the amidine. The most likely structure fitting the formula and the presence of Ac, OMe and NH groups is **Methyl 2-((1-acetylpyrrolidin-2-yl)(4-oxobutyl)amino)acrylate**.

*   **Product B:** The structure is a tetracyclic lactam. Its IUPAC name is (3aR,8aS,9R)-9-(methoxycarbonyl)-2,3,3a,4,8a,9-hexahydro-1H,5H-pyrrolo[1',2':4,5]pyrazino[1,2-a]indol-6(7H)-one. More simply, it is the product of cycloaddition followed by intramolecular lactamization.

*   **Product C:** The structure
