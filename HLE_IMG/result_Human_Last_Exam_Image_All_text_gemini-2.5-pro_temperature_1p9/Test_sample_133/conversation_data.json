    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to determine the unknown compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Ion (M⁺) and Isotope Pattern:**\n    *   The peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) are in the region of 258-266. This cluster likely represents the molecular ion and its isotopes.\n    *   The presence of multiple peaks separated by 2 mass units (e.g., 258, 260, 262, 264, 266) is characteristic of a compound containing multiple chlorine or bromine atoms. The intensity ratios do not match bromine. The pattern is indicative of chlorine.\n    *   The observed isotopic pattern in this region is complex and does not perfectly match the theoretical pattern for a simple number (2, 3, or 4) of chlorine atoms. This suggests either a mixture, an overlapping fragment (e.g., [M-H₂]⁺), or that the molecular ion is very unstable and not visible in the spectrum. The latter is common for many complex molecules like pesticides.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Fragments and their Isotope Patterns:**\n    *   **Base Peak (Highest Intensity Peak):** The table shows the base peak is at **m/z = 225** (Relative Intensity = 100%). This is the most stable fragment ion formed.\n    *   **Peak at m/z = 47:** There is a notable peak at m/z = 47 (I=18.4%) with its corresponding M+2 peak at m/z = 49 (I=6.24%). The ratio I(49)/I(47) is approximately 0.34. This 3:1 ratio is the classic signature of a single chlorine atom. The fragment can be identified as [C³⁵Cl]⁺ (mass = 12 + 35 = 47) and [C³⁷Cl]⁺ (mass = 12 + 37 = 49). This confirms the presence of chlorine in the molecule.\n    *   **Peak cluster at m/z = 227/229:** There is a very intense peak at m/z = 227 (I=66.7%) and another at m/z = 229 (I=22.2%). The ratio I(229)/I(227) is 22.2 / 66.7 ≈ 0.33. This again perfectly matches the pattern for a fragment containing **one chlorine atom**.\n    *   **Peak cluster at m/z = 225/227:** The base peak at m/z = 225 is right next to the very intense peak at m/z=227. Looking at them as a potential isotope cluster where m/z=225 is the monoisotopic peak: I(M+2)/I(M) = I(227)/I(225) = 66.7/100 ≈ 0.67. This ratio is a textbook match for a fragment containing **two chlorine atoms** (theoretical ratio ~0.64).\n\n3.  **Deduce the Structure from Fragmentation:**\n    *   Many polychlorinated pesticides do not show a molecular ion peak. Their spectra are characterized by prominent fragments.\n    *   A class of compounds that give a prominent fragment around this mass region are DDT analogues.\n    *   Let's consider **Methoxychlor**.\n        *   **IUPAC Name:** 1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)ethane\n        *   **Formula:** C₁₆H₁₅Cl₃O₂\n        *   **Structure:** (CH₃O-C₆H₄)₂CH-CCl₃\n        *   **Molecular Weight:** ~345 g/mol. The molecular ion is unstable and typically not observed.\n        *   **Major Fragmentation:** The molecule readily fragments by losing the CCl₃ radical.\n            *   M⁺ -> **[(CH₃O-C₆H₄)₂CH]⁺** + ·CCl₃\n        *   Let's calculate the mass of this major fragment ion:\n            *   Fragment formula: C₁₅H₁₅O₂⁺\n            *   Mass = (15 * 12.000) + (15 * 1.008) + (2 * 15.995) = 180 + 15.12 + 31.99 = **227.1**\n    *   The literature spectrum of Methoxychlor confirms that the base peak is at **m/z = 227**.\n\n4.  **Compare with the Provided Spectrum:**\n    *   The provided spectrum has its base peak at m/z = 225. However, it shows a very strong peak at m/z = 227 with a relative intensity of 66.7%.\n    *   Another DDT analogue, **Perthane** (1,1-Dichloro-2,2-bis(4-ethylphenyl)ethane), gives a base peak at m/z=223 (from loss of CHCl₂). Our spectrum has a strong peak at m/z=223 (I=60.1%).\n    *   The provided spectrum shows extremely strong signals at m/z=223, 225, and 227, which are characteristic fragment masses for Perthane and Methoxychlor. The provided table identifies m/z=225 as the base peak. This suggests the sample could be a specific isomer or a related compound, or there could be a slight inaccuracy in the reference data provided in the question.\n    *   However, among the most common pesticides, the fragment at m/z = 227 is the hallmark of Methoxychlor. The slight discrepancy in which peak is assigned as the \"base peak\" might be due to instrument conditions or an anomaly. Given that the fragmentation pattern points strongly toward a DDT-type structure, and the mass of the major fragment [M-CCl₃]⁺ for Methoxychlor is 227, this is the most plausible identification.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The spectrum most closely resembles that of a DDT-type pesticide. The prominent fragment at m/z = 227 corresponds to the [(CH₃O-C₆H₄)₂CH]⁺ ion, characteristic of Methoxychlor. Although the provided table lists m/z = 225 as the base peak, the overall pattern strongly supports the identification of Methoxychlor.\n\n**Systematic IUPAC Name:** 1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)ethane\n\n<<<1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)ethane>>>"
