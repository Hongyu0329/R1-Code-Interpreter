    "An analysis of the problem to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe main objective is to determine the cutoff frequency of the filter formed by the capacitor `C` at node `a_0$. A cutoff frequency (usually denoted `f_c` or `ω_c`) is a characteristic of a filter, typically where the signal power is reduced by half (-3 dB point). For a simple first-order RC low-pass filter, the angular cutoff frequency is given by `ω_c = 1 / (R_th * C)`, where `R_th` is the Thévenin equivalent resistance \"seen\" by the capacitor.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Circuit Topology**\nThe circuit is an infinite ladder network composed of identical resistors `r`. The capacitor `C` is connected from node `a_0` to ground. The input signal is applied at node `c_0`. This configuration acts as a low-pass filter for the voltage at node `a_0`.\n\n**Step 3: Strategy to find the Cutoff Frequency**\nTo find `ω_c`, we must first calculate the Thévenin equivalent resistance `R_th` at the terminals of the capacitor `C` (i.e., between node `a_0` and ground `b_0`).\nAccording to Thévenin's theorem, we need to:\n1.  Remove the capacitor `C`.\n2.  Deactivate all independent sources. The input \"IN\" at node `c_0` is treated as a voltage source, so we deactivate it by shorting it to ground. This means node `c_0` is at ground potential.\n3.  Calculate the equivalent resistance looking into the network from node `a_0` with respect to ground.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Thévenin Resistance (R_th)**\nWe will use nodal analysis to find `R_th`. We apply a test voltage `V_test` at node `a_0` and calculate the current `I_test` drawn from the source. Then `R_th = V_test / I_test`. For consistency, let's rename node `a_0` as `d_0`.\nOur boundary conditions are `V_{d0} = V_test` and `V_{c0} = 0`. We need to find the voltage distribution along the ladder to calculate `I_test`.\n\nLet `V_{cn}` and `V_{dn}` be the voltages at nodes `c_n` and `d_n` respectively.\nApplying Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at nodes `c_n` and `d_n` for `n ≥ 1` gives a system of coupled linear difference equations:\nKCL at `c_n`: `(V_{cn} - V_{cn-1})/r + (V_{cn} - V_{dn})/r + (V_{cn} - V_{cn+1})/r = 0`\n   ⇒ `V_{cn-1} + V_{dn} + V_{cn+1} - 3V_{cn} = 0`  (Eq. 1)\nKCL at `d_n`: `(V_{dn} - V_{dn-1})/r + (V_{dn} - V_{cn})/r + (V_{dn} - V_{dn+1})/r = 0`\n   ⇒ `V_{dn-1} + V_{cn} + V_{dn+1} - 3V_{dn} = 0`  (Eq. 2)\n\nWe look for solutions that decay as `n → ∞`. By separating the problem into symmetric (`V_{cn} = V_{dn}`) and anti-symmetric (`V_{cn} = -V_{dn}`) modes, we find the characteristic values for the spatial decay. The physical solution that decays to zero at infinity must be a superposition of these modes. The general form of the solution for `n ≥ 1` is:\n`V_{cn}(n) = A + B * λ^n`\n`V_{dn}(n) = A - B * λ^n`\nwhere `λ = 2 - sqrt(3)` is the decaying factor, and `A`, `B` are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions. The terms associated with non-decaying modes have been set to zero.\n\nNow, we use the KCL equations at `n=1` with our boundary conditions (`V_{c0}=0`, `V_{d0}=V_test`) to find `A` and `B`:\nFrom Eq. 1 at `n=1`: `V_{c0} - 3V_{c1} + V_{d1} + V_{c2} = 0`\nSubstituting the general solution form and `V_{c0}=0`:\n`0 - 3(A + Bλ) + (A - Bλ) + (A + Bλ^2) = 0`\n`A(-3+1+1) + B(-3λ - λ + λ^2) = 0`\n`-A + B(λ^2 - 4λ) = 0`. Since `λ=2-sqrt(3)` is a root of `x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0`, we have `λ^2 - 4λ = -1`.\nSo, `-A - B = 0` ⇒ `A = -B`.\n\nFrom Eq. 2 at `n=1`: `V_{d0} - 3V_{d1} + V_{c1} + V_{d2} = 0`\nSubstituting the general solution form and `V_{d0}=V_test`:\n`V_test - 3(A - Bλ) + (A + Bλ) + (A - Bλ^2) = 0`\n`V_test + A(-3+1+1) + B(3λ + λ - λ^2) = 0`\n`V_test - A + B(4λ - λ^2) = 0`. Since `4λ - λ^2 = 1`.\n`V_test - A + B = 0` ⇒ `V_test = A - B`.\n\nWe solve the system `A = -B` and `V_test = A - B`.\n`V_test = (-B) - B = -2B` ⇒ `B = -V_test / 2`.\n`A = -B = V_test / 2`.\n\nNow we have the full voltage solution. To find `R_th`, we calculate `I_test`. The current `I_test` is the current flowing from the test source at `a_0` (`d_0`) into the ladder, which is the current through the first resistor connecting `a_0` to `d_1`.\n`I_test = (V_{d0} - V_{d1}) / r = (V_test - V_{d1}) / r`.\n\nLet's find `V_{d1}`:\n`V_{d1} = A - Bλ = (V_test / 2) - (-V_test / 2)λ = (V_test / 2)(1 + λ)`.\n`V_{d1} = (V_test / 2)(1 + 2 - sqrt(3)) = (V_test / 2)(3 - sqrt(3))`.\n\nNow, substitute this into the expression for `I_test`:\n`I_test = (V_test - (V_test / 2)(3 - sqrt(3))) / r = (V_test / r) * [1 - (3 - sqrt(3))/2]`\n`I_test = (V_test / r) * [(2 - 3 + sqrt(3))/2] = (V_test / r) * (sqrt(3) - 1)/2`.\n\nFinally, we calculate `R_th`:\n`R_{th} = V_{test} / I_{test} = V_{test} / [(V_{test} / r) * (sqrt(3) - 1)/2] = r / [(sqrt(3) - 1)/2]`\n`R_{th} = 2r / (sqrt(3) - 1)`.\nTo simplify, we rationalize the denominator:\n`R_{th} = (2r * (sqrt(3) + 1)) / ((sqrt(3) - 1)(sqrt(3) + 1)) = (2r * (sqrt(3) + 1)) / (3 - 1) = r(1 + sqrt(3))`.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Cutoff Frequency**\nNow that we have the Thévenin resistance, we can find the angular cutoff frequency `ω_c`.\n`ω_c = 1 / (R_{th} * C) = 1 / (r(1 + sqrt(3)) * C)`.\n\n**2. List of careful points:**\n\n*   **Identify the right model:** The problem boils down to finding the Thévenin resistance `R_th` seen by the capacitor `C`.\n*   **Correctly deactivate sources:** The input source must be grounded to calculate `R_th`.\n*   **Recognize the infinite ladder:** The structure continues to infinity, which requires solving a system of difference equations or using a self-similarity argument.\n*   **Nodal analysis for coupled ladders:** For this bridged ladder structure, we must consider the voltages on both rails (`c_n` and `d_n`) simultaneously. A simple one-dimensional ladder formula is not applicable.\n*   **Handle boundary conditions properly:** The equations for the first rung of the ladder (`n=1`) are different from the general equations for `n ≥ 2` because they involve the known boundary voltages `V_{c0}` and `V_{d0}`.\n*   **Choose the physically correct solution:** The voltage must decay to zero as `n` approaches infinity, which restricts the possible solutions to the difference equations.\n*   **Calculation of R_th:** `R_th` is `V_test` divided by the total current `I_test` drawn from the test source. In this case, `I_test` is just the current flowing into node `d_1`.\n*   **Final Formula:** The cutoff frequency `ω_c` is `1/(R_{th}C)`. Don't forget any term in the final expression. The final answer should be in terms of `r` and `C`.\n\nFollowing these steps leads to the final expression for the cutoff frequency.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe angular cutoff frequency at node `a_0` is `ω_c`.\n`R_{th} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})`\n`ω_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}`\n\n<<<ω_c = 1 / (r * C * (1 + sqrt(3)))>>>"
