    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺)**: The mass spectrum shows the molecular ion peak at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight (MW) of the compound is 135.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule**: An odd molecular weight (135) suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule. The simplest case is one nitrogen atom.\n*   **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**: Assuming one nitrogen atom (mass 14), the rest of the molecule (CₓHᵧ) has a mass of 135 - 14 = 121. A common structure containing a benzene ring (C₆H₅, mass 77) would leave a fragment with mass 121 - 77 = 44. This fragment could be C₃H₈ (mass 44). This leads to a plausible molecular formula of C₉H₁₃N (9*12 + 13*1 + 1*14 = 108 + 13 + 14 = 135).\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation for C₉H₁₃N is calculated as: DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1 = 9 - 13/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 9 - 6.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 4. A DoU of 4 strongly suggests the presence of a benzene ring.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **~3400-3300 cm⁻¹**: There are two distinct peaks in this region. This is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **~3100-3000 cm⁻¹**: Peaks just above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate sp² C-H stretching, typical of aromatic rings.\n*   **~3000-2850 cm⁻¹**: Peaks just below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate sp³ C-H stretching, confirming the presence of an aliphatic (alkyl) portion.\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹ & ~1450-1500 cm⁻¹**: These absorptions are due to C=C stretching within the aromatic ring.\n*   **~750 cm⁻¹ and ~700 cm⁻¹**: Strong bands in this region (out-of-plane C-H bending) often indicate a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**3. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **δ 7.1-7.4 ppm (multiplet, 5.00H)**: This signal integrates to 5 protons in the aromatic region, confirming a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   **Aliphatic Region**:\n    *   **δ ~2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1.96H ≈ 2H)**: A signal corresponding to 2 protons.\n    *   **δ ~2.8 ppm (multiplet, 0.97H ≈ 1H)**: A signal corresponding to 1 proton.\n    *   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3.24H ≈ 3H)**: A signal for 3 protons, split into a doublet. This indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) adjacent to a methine group (-CH).\n*   **-NH₂ Protons**: The two protons from the primary amine are not explicitly labeled but are accounted for in the molecular formula (5H + 2H + 1H + 3H = 11H accounted for in NMR signals; 13H in total formula C₉H₁₃N. The 2 NH₂ protons are often broad and may be exchanged or hidden).\n\n**4. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis**\n*   **¹³C Chemical Shifts**: δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. There are 7 distinct carbon signals.\n*   **Aromatic Carbons (100-150 ppm)**: Four signals are in this region. 145.1 ppm is a quaternary carbon (ipso-C, attached to the side chain), as it does not bear any protons and is deshielded. The other three signals (128.5, 127.3, 126.3) correspond to the 5 CH carbons of the monosubstituted ring (some are chemically equivalent).\n*   **Aliphatic Carbons (< 100 ppm)**: Three signals at 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm.\n*   **DEPT-135 Information**: The spectrum has \"one negative and five positive signals\".\n    *   Negative signals in DEPT-135 correspond to CH₂ groups.\n    *   Positive signals correspond to CH and CH₃ groups.\n    *   Quaternary carbons are absent.\n*   This means our compound contains:\n    *   One -CH₂- group.\n    *   Five CH or CH₃ groups in total. This includes the aliphatic CH/CH₃ groups and the aromatic CH groups. We have 3 aliphatic carbons and 3 aromatic CH types (representing 5 CHs). The signal at 19.2 ppm is typical for a CH₃ group. Therefore, we have one CH₂, one aliphatic CH, one CH₃, and three types of aromatic CH groups, summing up to 1 negative signal and 1+1+3=5 positive signals. This matches the DEPT data.\n\n**5. HSQC Analysis (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence)**\nThe HSQC spectrum correlates ¹H signals with the ¹³C signals of the carbons they are directly bonded to.\n*   **Peak 1**: The proton signal at **δ 1.2 ppm** (the 3H doublet) correlates with the carbon signal at **δ 19.2 ppm**. This confirms that the signal at 19.2 ppm belongs to a -CH₃ group.\n*   **Peak 2**: The proton signal at **δ ~2.9 ppm** (the 2H multiplet) correlates with the carbon signal at **δ 43.5 ppm**. This identifies the carbon at 43.5 ppm as a -CH₂- group.\n*   **Peak 3**: The proton signal at **δ ~2.8 ppm** (the 1H multiplet) correlates with the carbon signal at **δ 49.6 ppm**. This identifies the carbon at 49.6 ppm as a -CH- group.\n\n**6. Structure Determination**\nLet's assemble the fragments (C₆H₅-, -CH₂-, -CH-, -CH₃, -NH₂) into a single structure that is consistent with all the data. We have two main possibilities for the C₃H₇N side chain:\n\n*   **Isomer A (1-phenylpropan-2-amine)**: C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃\n    *   Benzylic carbon is a CH₂ (predicted δ ~40-45 ppm). Our data shows the CH₂ group is at **43.5 ppm**. This is an excellent match.\n    *   The carbon bearing the -NH₂ group is a CH (predicted δ ~50-55 ppm). Our data shows the CH group is at **49.6 ppm**. This is also an excellent match.\n    *   The -CH₃ is attached to the CH. The ¹H NMR shows a 3H doublet. This matches.\n\n*   **Isomer B (2-phenylpropan-1-amine)**: C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂\n    *   Benzylic carbon is a CH (predicted δ ~35-45 ppm).\n    *   The carbon bearing the -NH₂ group is a CH₂ (predicted δ ~45-50 ppm).\n    *   Our data shows the CH is at 49.6 ppm and the CH₂ is at 43.5 ppm. The CH carbon is more deshielded (further downfield) than the CH₂ carbon. In Isomer B, the CH₂-NH₂ carbon would likely be more deshielded than the benzylic CH, which contradicts the observed data.\n\nTherefore, the correct structure is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n**7. IUPAC Name**\nThe parent alkane is propane. The principal functional group, the amine, is at position 2. A phenyl substituent is at position 1.\nThe IUPAC name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
