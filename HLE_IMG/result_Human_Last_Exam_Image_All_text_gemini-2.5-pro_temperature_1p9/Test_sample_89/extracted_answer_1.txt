The structures for the three products A, B, and C are as follows:

*   **Product A**: Methyl 2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolizine-6-carboxylate. This molecule consists of a pyrrolidine ring fused with a pyrrole ring, with a methyl carboxylate group attached to the pyrrole ring.
    
*   **Product B**: Tetrahydro-3H-pyrrolizin-3-one. This is a bicyclic lactam, composed of two fused five-membered rings sharing a nitrogen atom, with one ring containing a ketone (C=O) group.
    
*   **Product C**: N-acetylpyrrolidine. This is a five-membered saturated pyrrolidine ring where the nitrogen atom is bonded to an acetyl group (-COCH3).

Here are the graphical representations of the structures:
**A**:
```
      COOCH3
       |
    //  \\
  -C-----C-
 //      \\
N-------CH
| \     / |
CH2-CH2--CH2
```
(A more accurate representation is a pyrrole ring fused to a pyrrolidine ring at the N-C bond, with a COOCH3 group on the pyrrole ring).
A schematic drawing is a 5-membered ring with one N fused to another 5-membered ring (which is a pyrrole). There is a COOCH3 group on the pyrrole part.

**B**:

(A fused 5-5 ring system with a bridgehead nitrogen and a carbonyl group on one of the rings). A schematic is a 5-membered ring with one N fused to another 5-membered ring, where one ring is a lactam.

**C**:
