    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Formation of Intermediate-1:**\n    *   **Reaction:** Benzene reacts with propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, AlCl₃.\n    *   **Type:** This is a classic Friedel-Crafts Acylation reaction. The electrophile is the propanoyl cation (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O), which is generated by the reaction of propanoyl chloride with AlCl₃.\n    *   **Product:** The benzene ring attacks the electrophile, substituting a hydrogen atom with the propanoyl group. The resulting product, Intermediate-1, is **1-phenylpropan-1-one** (commonly known as propiophenone). Its structure is a phenyl group attached to a carbonyl carbon, which is in turn attached to an ethyl group (C₆H₅COCH₂CH₃).\n\n2.  **Formation of Intermediate-2:**\n    *   **Reaction:** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone) is treated with Br₂ and FeBr₃.\n    *   **Type:** This is an Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (bromination) of the benzene ring.\n    *   **Directing Effect:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the *meta* position.\n    *   **Product:** A bromine atom is added to the position *meta* to the propanoyl group. Intermediate-2 is **1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one**.\n\n3.  **Formation of Intermediate-3:**\n    *   **Reaction:** Intermediate-2 is treated with H₂ gas over a Palladium (Pd) catalyst.\n    *   **Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation/reduction reaction. These conditions are capable of multiple transformations. In the context of synthesizing alkylbenzenes and simplifying the structure for the next step, this step likely accomplishes two reductions:\n        *   Reduction of the ketone (C=O) to a methylene group (-CH₂-). While specific named reactions like Clemmensen or Wolff-Kishner are standard for this, catalytic hydrogenation can also achieve it, and it's a common simplification in synthesis problems.\n        *   Hydrogenolysis of the aryl-bromide bond (C-Br) to a C-H bond. Palladium catalysts are very effective for this transformation.\n    *   **Product:** Both the bromo substituent and the carbonyl group are reduced, converting 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one into **propylbenzene** (C₆H₅CH₂CH₂CH₃). This is the most logical intermediate, as alternative reduction products would lead to problematic or less-specific final steps.\n\n4.  **Formation of the Final Product:**\n    *   **Reaction:** Intermediate-3 (propylbenzene) is treated with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂), and CCl₄.\n    *   **Type:** This is a free radical bromination reaction. NBS is a reagent that provides a low, constant concentration of Br₂, favoring radical substitution over electrophilic addition. Benzoyl peroxide acts as a radical initiator.\n    *   **Selectivity:** Radical halogenation is highly selective for the most stable radical intermediate. In propylbenzene, abstracting a hydrogen atom from the carbon attached to the benzene ring (the benzylic position) creates a benzylic radical. This radical is significantly stabilized by resonance with the aromatic ring, making it much more stable than radicals formed at other positions on the propyl chain.\n    *   **Product:** Bromination occurs selectively at the benzylic carbon. One hydrogen on the -CH₂- group attached to the ring is replaced by a bromine atom. The final product is **1-bromo-1-phenylpropane**.\n\n**Summary of Transformations:**\nBenzene → Propiophenone → 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one → Propylbenzene → 1-bromo-1-phenylpropane\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-phenylpropane>>>"
