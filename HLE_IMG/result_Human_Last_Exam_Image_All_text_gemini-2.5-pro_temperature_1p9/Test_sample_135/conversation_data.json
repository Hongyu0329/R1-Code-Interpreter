    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the altarpiece detail:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the content and style of the artwork.**\nThe image displays a circular bas-relief, also known as a tondo. The scene is religious, depicting a priest administering the sacrament of the Eucharist (Communion) to a group of kneeling worshippers, including a child, a monk, and two women. The figures are rendered with a sense of classical grace, calmness, and piety. This style is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance, particularly the Florentine school of the 15th century.\n\n**Step 2: Examine the inscription.**\nAt the bottom of the roundel, there is a scroll or cartouche with an inscription. Although partially obscured, it can be read as \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This is an older form of Italian for \"Sacramenti dell'Altare,\" which translates to \"Sacraments of the Altar,\" confirming the subject as the Eucharist.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the medium and associated artists.**\nThe high-relief sculpture, with its smooth, idealized figures, strongly suggests the work of the Della Robbia workshop. This family of artists, founded by Luca della Robbia and continued by his nephew Andrea and Andrea's sons, was famous for its glazed terracotta (terracotta invetriata) sculptures, which often featured white figures set against a blue background. The appearance of the relief is consistent with this medium, even in a black-and-white photograph.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the artwork to a specific location and artist.**\nBy searching for an \"Altarpiece of the Sacraments\" in the Della Robbia style, we can identify this specific work. The relief is a detail from the predella (the base platform) of the \"Altarpiece of the Sacraments\" located in the Cathedral of Fiesole (Cattedrale di San Romolo), a town just outside Florence. Historical and art historical sources definitively attribute this altarpiece to Andrea della Robbia, created circa 1493. The tondo depicting the Eucharist is one of the central scenes on the predella of this larger work.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the identification.**\nBased on the distinct style, subject matter, inscription, and comparison with known works, the author of this relief is identified as Andrea della Robbia.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
