    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval from the provided raster plot.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the graph and identify the phenomenon of interest.**\nThe graph is a raster plot showing the firing times of neurons recorded by 128 different electrodes over a period of 50 seconds.\n- The y-axis represents the electrode number (from 0 to 128).\n- The x-axis represents time in seconds (from 0 to 50 s).\n- Each black dot represents a single neuronal firing event (a \"spike\").\nThe question asks to identify \"synchronized bursts\". Visually, these are the prominent vertical bands where many electrodes show dense firing activity at approximately the same time. These bursts stand out from the sparser background firing.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the timestamps of each synchronized burst.**\nWe will scan the x-axis from left to right and estimate the starting time of each major synchronized burst. The x-axis has major ticks every 10 seconds.\n1.  **Burst 1:** The first dense vertical band starts shortly after t=0 s. It appears to begin at approximately **t₁ = 2 s**.\n2.  **Burst 2:** The next major burst occurs between 10 s and 20 s. It seems to start around **t₂ = 14 s**.\n3.  **Burst 3:** The third burst starts exactly halfway between the 20 s and 30 s marks. Its starting time is estimated as **t₃ = 25 s**.\n4.  **Burst 4:** The fourth burst is located after the midpoint between 30 s and 40 s. It appears to start at **t₄ = 36 s**.\n5.  **Burst 5:** The final major burst is near the end of the recording, starting a bit before the 50 s mark. Its starting time is estimated as **t₅ = 48 s**.\n\nSo, the timestamps for the starts of the five major synchronized bursts are approximately 2 s, 14 s, 25 s, 36 s, and 48 s.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs).**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between the start of one burst and the start of the next consecutive burst. We have 5 bursts, which gives us 4 inter-burst intervals.\n-   **IBI₁** (between burst 2 and burst 1): t₂ - t₁ = 14 s - 2 s = **12 s**\n-   **IBI₂** (between burst 3 and burst 2): t₃ - t₂ = 25 s - 14 s = **11 s**\n-   **IBI₃** (between burst 4 and burst 3): t₄ - t₃ = 36 s - 25 s = **11 s**\n-   **IBI₄** (between burst 5 and burst 4): t₅ - t₄ = 48 s - 36 s = **12 s**\n\nThe calculated inter-burst intervals are 12 s, 11 s, 11 s, and 12 s.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the average inter-burst interval.**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual intervals and divide by the number of intervals (which is 4).\n-   Sum of IBIs = 12 s + 11 s + 11 s + 12 s = 46 s\n-   Average IBI = Sum of IBIs / Number of intervals = 46 s / 4 = **11.5 s**\n\n**Step 5: Round the final answer to two significant figures.**\nThe question requires the answer to be given to two significant figures. The calculated average is 11.5 s.\n- The first two digits are 1 and 1.\n- The third digit is 5. According to standard rounding rules, if the digit to be dropped is 5 or greater, the preceding digit is rounded up.\n- Therefore, 11.5 rounded to two significant figures is **12**.\n\nThe final answer is 12 s.\n\n<<<12>>>"
