    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n1.  **Initial Analysis of Musical Elements:**\n    *   **Instrumentation:** The music is written on a grand staff (treble and bass clefs), which is standard for piano music.\n    *   **Key Signature:** The key signature has two sharps (F# and C#). This indicates either D major or its relative minor, B minor. The piece starts with a D major chord in the left hand (D-F#-A) and the melody centers around notes of the D major scale, confirming the key is D major.\n    *   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4, also known as common time.\n    *   **Tempo:** The tempo marking is a quarter note equals 80 beats per minute (♩=80), which is a moderately slow tempo (Andante).\n\n2.  **Melodic and Rhythmic Features:**\n    *   **Measure 1-2 (The Opening):** The piece begins with a very distinct and memorable melody in the right hand: A-G-F#-E-D-C#-B-A. This simple, descending melodic line is played softly (`p` - piano). The left hand plays sustained chords. This soft, lyrical opening is a key identifier.\n    *   **Measure 3 (Sudden Shift):** There is an abrupt and dramatic change in character at the end of measure 2. The dynamic changes to `f` (forte - loud), and the texture becomes dense and energetic. Both hands play fast, broken chords and arpeggios, creating a feeling of intensity and turmoil. This stark contrast between a quiet, melancholic opening and a sudden powerful outburst is a hallmark of this piece.\n    *   **Measure 4-7:** The intensity lessens slightly to `mp` (mezzo-piano). The right hand plays chords while the left hand plays an accompaniment pattern of broken octaves and chords. This section features significant chromaticism (notes outside the key signature, like G#), adding to the piece's emotional complexity.\n    *   **Measure 8 onwards:** The dynamic increases again to `mf` (mezzo-forte), and the texture becomes filled with powerful block chords in both hands, driving the piece forward with immense energy.\n    *   **Measure 11:** A virtuosic, rapid arpeggiated figure (indicated by the grace notes) leads into a very dense and rhythmically complex section, which is typical of the climax in many advanced piano arrangements.\n\n3.  **Connecting the Features to a Specific Piece:**\n    *   The opening melody (A-G-F#-E...) is extremely recognizable to fans of anime music.\n    *   The dramatic structure—starting calmly and beautifully before exploding into a passionate, technically demanding section—is characteristic of this particular song.\n    *   Combining these elements—the specific melody, the key of D major, and the intense emotional arc—points directly to the opening theme song of the anime series *Tokyo Ghoul*.\n\n4.  **Final Identification:**\n    *   The song is titled \"Unravel\".\n    *   It was originally performed by the band Ling tosite sigure, with vocals and composition by TK (Toru Kitajima).\n    *   The sheet music provided is a piano arrangement of this song. Many such arrangements exist, often by pianists like Animenz or Theishter, who are famous for their complex and virtuosic anime covers. This arrangement captures the full dynamic and emotional range of the original song.\n\n<<<Unravel (from Tokyo Ghoul)>>>"
