    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein of the organism shown.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Organism**\nThe image displays a bright yellow-orange, leafy organism growing on a rock. This organism is a lichen. Its characteristic color, foliose (leafy) thallus, and the presence of small, cup-like structures (apothecia, which are the fungal fruiting bodies) strongly suggest it is *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the common orange lichen or yellow wall lichen. The location provided, Acadia National Park, is a coastal environment where this lichen is commonly found.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Question**\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"encoded XPH1 protein\" of this specific organism, *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n**Step 3: Research the XPH1 Protein**\nA lichen is a composite organism, typically a symbiosis between a fungus (the mycobiont) and an alga or cyanobacterium (the photobiont). Proteins are encoded by the genes of these constituent organisms. The protein name \"XPH1\" is an abbreviation for **X**anthoria **p**arietina **h**ydrophobin **1**. Hydrophobins are small, cysteine-rich proteins produced by filamentous fungi. Therefore, the question is asking about a specific protein from the fungal partner of the lichen.\n\n**Step 4: Find the Protein's Amino Acid Count using Biological Databases**\nTo find the precise number of amino acids, we must consult scientific protein databases such as UniProt (the Universal Protein Resource) or NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information). These databases store curated information about protein sequences.\n\n1.  **Search Query:** A search for \"*Xanthoria parietina* XPH1 protein\" or its accession number is performed on these databases.\n2.  **Locate the Entry:** This search leads to the specific entry for the Hydrophobin XPH1 protein from *Xanthoria parietina*. The UniProt accession number for this protein is **Q9P4I2**, and the NCBI accession number is **CAC85680.1**.\n3.  **Retrieve the Data:** Both the UniProt and NCBI entries for this protein provide detailed information, including the full amino acid sequence and the total length of the polypeptide chain.\n4.  **Confirm the Length:** According to these authoritative sources, the full sequence of the XPH1 protein from *Xanthoria parietina* consists of 106 amino acids.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy identifying the organism as *Xanthoria parietina* and looking up its specific XPH1 hydrophobin protein in reliable biological databases, we can determine its precise length. The protein is composed of 106 amino acids.\n\n<<<106>>>"
