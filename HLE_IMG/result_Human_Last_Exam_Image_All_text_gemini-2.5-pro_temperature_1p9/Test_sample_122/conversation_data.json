    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the amine group**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is L-tryptophan. This is an amino acid with three main functional groups: a primary amine (-NH₂), a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and an indole side chain.\n*   **Reagents:** Benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction used for protecting the amino group. The NaOH acts as a base to deprotonate the carboxylic acid and to neutralize the HCl formed during the reaction, which keeps the amine in its nucleophilic free-base form. The nitrogen atom of the amine group acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan. The amino group is now protected by a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group, while the carboxylic acid and indole ring remain unchanged. The structure of Intermediate 1 is (S)-2-((benzyloxy)carbonylamino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Amide coupling to form a hydroxamate ester**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan) and O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H₂NO-Bn).\n*   **Reagents:** EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide), HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole), and Et₃N (Triethylamine).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard peptide-like coupling reaction.\n    1.  The carboxylic acid group of Intermediate 1 is activated by EDC to form a reactive O-acylisourea intermediate.\n    2.  HOBt reacts with this intermediate to form a more stable HOBt-ester, which helps to prevent side reactions and racemization.\n    3.  Triethylamine (Et₃N) is a base that neutralizes the hydrochloride salt of O-benzylhydroxylamine, releasing the free nucleophile H₂NO-Bn.\n    4.  The nucleophilic nitrogen of O-benzylhydroxylamine attacks the activated carbonyl group, forming a new bond. This results in the formation of an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is benzyl ((S)-1-((benzyloxy)amino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate. In simpler terms, the carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan has been converted into an O-benzyl hydroxamate derivative. Both the original amine group (as Cbz) and the newly formed hydroxamic acid (as O-benzyl ether) are protected.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection and Reduction**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate 2.\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂).\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction condition is known as catalytic hydrogenolysis, a common method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups.\n    1.  **Cbz group removal:** The Cbz group on the α-amino group is cleaved by hydrogenolysis, yielding the free primary amine (-NH₂), along with toluene and carbon dioxide as byproducts.\n        (R-NH-Cbz  →  R-NH₂)\n    2.  **O-benzyl group removal:** The O-benzyl group (Bn) on the hydroxamate is also cleaved by hydrogenolysis, which would initially form a hydroxamic acid (-CONHOH).\n        (R-CO-NHO-Bn  →  R-CO-NHOH)\n    3.  **Hydroxamic acid reduction:** The resulting hydroxamic acid intermediate is also reduced under these conditions. The N-O bond is cleaved by hydrogenolysis to give a primary amide (-CONH₂).\n        (R-CO-NHOH  →  R-CO-NH₂)\n*   **Final Product:** Both deprotection reactions and the final reduction occur in this single step. The final product has a free α-amino group and a primary amide group in place of the original carboxylic acid. The stereochemistry at the α-carbon is retained. The structure is (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide. This molecule is the amide of L-tryptophan.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe name of the final product is the primary amide derivative of L-tryptophan.\n\n<<<L-Tryptophanamide>>>"
