    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the basic structural features.**\n    The provided chemical structure is a complex polycyclic molecule. It contains two nitrogen atoms incorporated into the ring system, which is a hallmark of an alkaloid. The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) is also a key feature.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the core skeleton.**\n    The molecule consists of four fused six-membered rings. This specific tetracyclic framework with two nitrogen atoms is characteristic of a class of quinolizidine alkaloids known as lupin alkaloids. The parent structure of this family is called sparteine. The molecule in the question is an oxygenated derivative of sparteine.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the functional group and its position.**\n    The structure has a carbonyl group (C=O) which is part of a six-membered ring containing a nitrogen atom. This functional group is a lactam (a cyclic amide). By comparing the structure to the parent sparteine skeleton and its standard numbering system, the carbonyl group is located at the C-2 position. Therefore, a systematic name for this compound is 2-oxosparteine.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the common name.**\n    Like many natural products, this compound is more widely known by its common name rather than its systematic name. This specific alkaloid, 2-oxosparteine, is commonly known as **Lupanine**. It is one of the major alkaloids found in the seeds of lupin plants.\n\n*   **Step 5: Consider the stereochemistry.**\n    The wedges and dashes in the drawing indicate a specific stereoisomer. The depicted stereochemistry corresponds to the naturally occurring (+)-lupanine, which is the most common form of the compound. The name \"Lupanine\" generally refers to this specific stereoisomer.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis of its tetracyclic lactam structure, which is a derivative of sparteine, the compound is identified as the well-known lupin alkaloid, Lupanine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
