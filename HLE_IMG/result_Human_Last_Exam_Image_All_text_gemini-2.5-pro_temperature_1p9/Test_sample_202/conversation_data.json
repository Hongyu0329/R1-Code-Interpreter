    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens:\n\n**Analysis of Specimen H**\n\n*   **Step 1: Observe Texture and Color.** Specimen H is a reddish-brown rock with a very porous and rough surface. It is covered in numerous small holes or cavities.\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the Texture.** The holes are called vesicles, which are formed by gas bubbles escaping from molten rock (lava) as it cooled and solidified. This vesicular texture is characteristic of extrusive (volcanic) igneous rocks.\n*   **Step 3: Identify the Rock.** An extrusive igneous rock that is highly vesicular and typically reddish-brown or black is called **scoria**. It is sometimes referred to as lava rock.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen I**\n\n*   **Step 1: Observe Texture and Composition.** This specimen is composed of various angular and sub-angular rock fragments (clasts) of different colors and sizes. These fragments are cemented together in a fine-grained, lighter-colored matrix.\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the Texture.** This is a clastic texture, indicating the rock is made from consolidated fragments. Given the context of other potential volcanic rocks in the set, this is likely a pyroclastic rock, formed from material ejected during a volcanic eruption.\n*   **Step 3: Identify the Rock.** A rock formed from consolidated volcanic ash is called **tuff**. When it contains larger fragments (lapilli) mixed with ash, as seen here, it can be called a lapilli tuff or a tuff breccia. The general term for this rock type is **tuff**.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen J**\n\n*   **Step 1: Observe Texture and Color.** Specimen J is a light-colored (white to light grey) rock. Like specimen H, it is extremely vesicular, giving it a frothy and porous appearance. It looks very lightweight.\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the Texture.** The highly vesicular texture indicates it is an extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock that formed from a gas-rich lava that cooled rapidly.\n*   **Step 3: Identify the Rock.** A light-colored, low-density, highly vesicular volcanic rock is known as **pumice**. It is often so light that it can float on water.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen K**\n\n*   **Step 1: Observe Texture and Composition.** This specimen is composed of large, interlocking mineral crystals that are easily visible. This is known as a coarse-grained or phaneritic texture. The crystals are of different colors: light-colored ones (white, grey, or pinkish - likely quartz and feldspar) and dark-colored ones (black or dark green - likely biotite or hornblende).\n*   **Step 2: Interpret the Texture.** The coarse-grained texture indicates the rock cooled slowly, deep beneath the Earth's surface. This is characteristic of an intrusive igneous rock.\n*   **Step 3: Identify the Rock.** An intrusive igneous rock that is coarse-grained and composed primarily of light-colored minerals like quartz and feldspar is identified as **granite**.\n\n**Final Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Tuff\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Granite\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Tuff, J: Pumice, K: Granite>>>"
