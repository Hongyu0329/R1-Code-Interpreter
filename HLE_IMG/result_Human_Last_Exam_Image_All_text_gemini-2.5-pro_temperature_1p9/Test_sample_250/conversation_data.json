    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the title and composer of the jazz standard from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Key and Overall Form:**\n    *   **Key Signature:** The key signature has four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭).\n    *   **Tonic Chord:** The piece starts with an F minor chord (F-) and ends on an F chord. This strongly suggests the overall key is F minor.\n    *   **Form:** The structure appears to be a standard jazz form. We see an 8-bar section with a repeat sign, followed by what looks like an 8-bar bridge (the \"B\" section), and then a return to the initial section (the final \"A\" section). This suggests a 32-bar AABA form, which is very common in jazz.\n\n2.  **Analyze the \"A\" Section (First 8 bars):**\n    *   **Chord Progression:** The progression in the first four bars is `F- | E-7♭5 | E♭-6 | D♭maj7`. This is a highly distinctive progression, featuring a chromatic descent in the chord roots (F, E, E♭, D♭). This \"line cliché\" is a major identifying feature.\n    *   **Melody:** The melody starts with the notes C, F, G, A♭ over the F minor chord. This melodic phrase, rising from the 5th to the minor 3rd of the chord, is very characteristic.\n\n3.  **Analyze the \"B\" Section (Bridge):**\n    *   **Chord Progression:** The bridge begins at the measure marked D-7♭5. The progression is `D-7♭5 | G7 | C7 | F7 | B♭-7 | E♭7 | A♭ | G C7`. This sequence involves several \"ii-V\" progressions (like B♭-7 to E♭7, which leads to A♭) and dominant chords moving in fourths (C7 to F7), a pattern typical of jazz standard bridges designed to provide contrast to the A section before leading back to it.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Information and Identify the Tune:**\n    *   The combination of the F minor key, the AABA form, and especially the unique descending chromatic chord progression in the A section (`F-` -> `E-7♭5` -> `E♭-6` -> `D♭maj7`) are the defining characteristics of a well-known jazz standard.\n    *   This specific harmonic and melodic signature belongs to the song **\"Nica's Dream\"**.\n\n5.  **Identify the Composer:**\n    *   \"Nica's Dream\" was composed by the celebrated jazz pianist and bandleader **Horace Silver**. It first appeared on the 1956 album *Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers*.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Chord Symbol Variations:** Jazz lead sheets, especially handwritten ones like this, often have slight variations. For instance, the original might specify `E♭-7` while this chart shows `E♭-6`. These are very similar harmonically and are common substitutions.\n*   **Shorthand:** The `D♭` chord in the final A section is likely shorthand for `D♭maj7`, and `A♭` in the bridge is shorthand for `A♭maj7`.\n*   **Iconic Features:** The most important takeaway is to recognize the iconic opening. The chromatic descent in the chords of the A section is the most powerful clue for identifying \"Nica's Dream\".\n\n<<<Title: Nica's Dream, Composer: Horace Silver>>>"
