    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to identify the figure leaving the chariot.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the overall scene:** The image is from an ancient Greek red-figure vase. It depicts a dramatic mythological event involving a chariot. We see a chariot drawn by a horse, two figures within the chariot, one figure falling from it, and a winged figure flying above.\n2.  **Examine the figures in detail:**\n    *   **The Charioteer:** The figure driving the chariot is wearing elaborate clothing, including a dotted sleeve and a Phrygian cap (a soft, conical cap). In Greek art, this type of dress was often used to signify a \"barbarian\" or someone from the East (e.g., from Persia, Scythia, or Asia Minor).\n    *   **The Passenger:** Behind the charioteer is a second figure, likely a woman, draped in robes.\n    *   **The Winged Figure:** Flying above the chariot is a winged female figure. This is identifiable as Nike, the Greek goddess of Victory. Her presence signifies that a contest or battle has just been won.\n    *   **The Falling Figure:** This is the key figure for the question. A muscular, nude male is shown falling headfirst from the chariot, with his body twisted as if in a violent crash. He is being thrown to the ground in front of the chariot wheel. This figure is clearly being defeated or killed.\n3.  **Identify the myth:** The combination of these specific elements points to a well-known Greek myth: the fatal chariot race between Pelops and King Oenomaus.\n    *   **The Myth:** King Oenomaus of Pisa would challenge suitors for his daughter Hippodamia's hand to a chariot race. Oenomaus had divine horses from his father, Ares, and always won, killing the defeated suitors. Pelops, a hero from Lydia in Asia Minor (which explains the \"Eastern\" dress), took up the challenge. According to most versions of the myth, Pelops sabotaged Oenomaus's chariot (or bribed his charioteer, Myrtilus, to do so). During the race, the wheels of Oenomaus's chariot broke, causing him to crash violently and die.\n4.  **Connect the figures to the myth:**\n    *   The victorious charioteer in \"foreign\" attire is **Pelops**.\n    *   The woman in the chariot with him is **Hippodamia**, his prize.\n    *   The winged **Nike** is flying overhead to crown Pelops as the victor.\n    *   Therefore, the man falling violently from the crashing chariot is the defeated king, **Oenomaus**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe figure leaving the chariot is the defeated King Oenomaus, shown at the moment of his death during his mythical chariot race against Pelops.\n\n<<<Oenomaus>>>"
