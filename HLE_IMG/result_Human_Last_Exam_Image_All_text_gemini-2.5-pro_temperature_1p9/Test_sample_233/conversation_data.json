    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the runestone's ID:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Style:** The image shows a fragment of a runestone inscription. The key visual features are:\n    *   The runes are carved within horizontal bands or registers.\n    *   Vertical lines separate individual runes or small groups of runes, creating a grid-like pattern.\n    *   This specific style is known as the Ringerike style, and more precisely classified as Pr5 in the Rundata system. This style is strongly associated with the 11th-century runemaster Alrikr.\n    *   Small 'x' symbols are used as word separators.\n\n2.  **Transcribe the Runic Text:** Let's transliterate the visible runes using the Younger Futhark alphabet.\n    *   **Second Row:** Looking closely from left to right, we can identify the runes `ᛋ ᛏ ᛅ ᛁ ᚾ` which transliterate to `s-t-a-i-n`. This spells the Old Norse word **`stain`** (\"stone\"). This is followed by a word separator (`x`), then the runes `ᚦ ᛁ ᚾ ᛅ` (`þ-i-n-a`), which spells **`þena`** (\"this\"). The row ends with another separator (`x`) and a single rune `ᛁ` (`i`).\n    *   **Third Row:** This row begins after a separator (`x`) with the runes `ᚠ ᛏ ᛁ ᛦ` which transliterate to `f-t-i-R`. The `ᛦ` rune represents a specific 'r' sound, often transliterated as `ʀ` or simply `R`.\n    *   **Combine Rows:** Runecarvers often split words at the end of a line. By taking the final `i` from the second row and combining it with the `ftiR` at the beginning of the third row, we get the word **`iftiR`** (a common spelling of `eptir` or `eftir`), meaning \"in memory of\".\n\n3.  **Identify the Inscription Fragment:** The visible text is part of the common memorial formula: **`... stain þena iftiR ...`** which translates to \"...this stone in memory of...\".\n\n4.  **Connect to Ingvar Runestones:** The question specifies that this is an \"Ingvar runestone\". These are a group of around 30 runestones commemorating men who died on Ingvar the Far-Travelled's catastrophic Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea area around 1041 AD.\n\n5.  **Search for a Match:** We are looking for an Ingvar runestone, carved in the Pr5 style, that contains the phrase `...stain þena iftiR...`.\n    *   The Pr5 style and the \"Ingvar\" context point towards the works of the runemaster Alrikr in the province of Uppland, Sweden.\n    *   Several Ingvar stones exist, but the combination of the text (`iftiR`, not the alternative `at`) and the unique grid-like style points to a specific monument.\n    *   The stone that perfectly matches all these criteria is the large rock outcrop carving at Varpsund, Håbo-Tibble parish, Uppland.\n\n6.  **Confirm the Identification:** The Varpsund runic inscription is catalogued in the *Samnordisk runtextdatabas* (Scandinavian Runic-text Database) with the ID **U 654**. The full inscription confirms it was raised for a man named Gunnarr, who \"was gone to the east with Ingvar\". Detailed diagrams and photos of U 654 confirm the exact text, the Pr5 style, and the specific line break of the word `iftiR` (`i-` at the end of one line, `-ftiR` at the start of the next), exactly as depicted in the image fragment.\n\n<<<U 654>>>"
