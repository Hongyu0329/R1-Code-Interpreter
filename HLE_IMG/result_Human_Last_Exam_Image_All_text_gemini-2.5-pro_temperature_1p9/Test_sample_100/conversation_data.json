    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material and the First Reaction**\n\n1.  **Starting Material Structure:** The starting material is a bicyclic lactam. Let's determine its molecular formula by counting the atoms.\n    *   The core bicyclic structure contains a lactam (amide in a ring), a carbon-carbon double bond, and several CH, CH2 groups. Based on common synthetic routes and structural representations, this is a derivative of a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one, also known as a Vince lactam.\n    *   Let's count the atoms:\n        *   The bicyclic lactam core with a CF3 group has 7 carbons (6 in the rings, 1 in the CF3 group), 5 hydrogens on the carbon skeleton, 1 nitrogen, and 1 oxygen.\n        *   The substituents are:\n            *   **PMB (para-methoxybenzyl) group** on the nitrogen atom: -CH2-C6H4-OCH3. This group has 8 carbons (1 from CH2, 6 from the benzene ring, 1 from OCH3), 9 hydrogens (2 from CH2, 4 from the ring, 3 from OCH3), and 1 oxygen. Formula: C8H9O.\n            *   **CF3 (trifluoromethyl) group** on the double bond. Formula: CF3.\n    *   Total molecular formula of the starting material:\n        *   **C**: 6 (core) + 1 (from CF3) + 8 (from PMB) = 15\n        *   **H**: 5 (core hydrogens) + 9 (from PMB) = 14\n        *   **F**: 3\n        *   **N**: 1\n        *   **O**: 1 (from lactam carbonyl) + 1 (from PMB ether) = 2\n    *   Thus, the molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n2.  **First Reaction: Deprotection with CAN**\n    *   Reagents: CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O (acetonitrile/water).\n    *   Transformation: CAN is a standard reagent for the oxidative cleavage of para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting groups from nitrogen or oxygen atoms. The N-PMB bond is cleaved, and a hydrogen atom (from the solvent H2O) is added to the nitrogen.\n    *   Change in atoms: The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed, and a single hydrogen atom (H) is added. The net change is the loss of a C8H8O fragment.\n    *   **Intermediate 1 Molecular Formula**:\n        *   Start: C15H14F3NO2\n        *   Change: - C8H8O\n        *   End: C(15-8) H(14-8) F3 N1 O(2-1) = **C7H6F3NO**\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Second Reaction**\n\n1.  **Reaction: Catalytic Hydrogenation**\n    *   Reagents: Pd/C (Palladium on carbon) and H2 (hydrogen gas) in MeOH (methanol).\n    *   Transformation: This is a classic catalytic hydrogenation reaction. It selectively reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) to a carbon-carbon single bond (C-C) without affecting the lactam carbonyl group (C=O) or the CF3 group under these mild conditions.\n    *   Change in atoms: The reduction of a double bond involves the addition of two hydrogen atoms (one molecule of H2).\n    *   **Intermediate 2 Molecular Formula**:\n        *   Start: C7H6F3NO (Intermediate 1)\n        *   Change: + H2\n        *   End: C7 H(6+2) F3 N1 O1 = **C7H8F3NO**\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the Third Reaction and Final Product**\n\n1.  **Reaction: Acid Hydrolysis**\n    *   Reagents: 4 N HCl (hydrochloric acid) at 70 Â°C.\n    *   Transformation: These are harsh acidic conditions with heat, which cause the hydrolysis of the amide bond within the lactam ring. The cyclic amide is opened to form a linear amino acid.\n    *   Change in atoms: Hydrolysis of an amide bond involves the addition of one molecule of water (H2O) across the C-N bond. The carbonyl group becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the nitrogen atom becomes an amino group (-NH2). In the acidic conditions, the amino group will be protonated to an ammonium ion (-NH3+), but the molecular formula is conventionally written for the neutral species.\n    *   **Final Product Molecular Formula**:\n        *   Start: C7H8F3NO (Intermediate 2)\n        *   Change: + H2O\n        *   End: C7 H(8+2) F3 N1 O(1+1) = **C7H10F3NO2**\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBy tracking the changes in atoms through each step of the reaction sequence, the molecular formula of the final product is determined to be C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
