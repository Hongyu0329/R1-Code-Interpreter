The high regioselectivity observed in Reaction 3 is due to the conformationally locked, bicyclic nature of the Münchnone intermediate formed from N-acetyl-proline. This rigid structure prevents the C2 (methyl) and C4 (fused ring) substituents from equilibrating, a process which occurs in the acyclic system of Reactions 1 and 2 as shown by the isotopic labeling experiment. The fixed and significant steric/electronic differences between the methyl group at C2 and the bulky fused ring at C4 in the proline-derived Münchnone strongly direct the orientation of the incoming methyl propiolate, leading to the formation of a single regioisomeric product (Product B). Reactions 1 and 2 demonstrate that without this conformational lock, substituent scrambling can occur, making the lack of scrambling in Reaction 3 the key factor for its regioselectivity.
