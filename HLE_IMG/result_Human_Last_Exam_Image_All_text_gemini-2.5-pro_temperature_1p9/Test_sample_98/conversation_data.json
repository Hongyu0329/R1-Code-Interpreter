    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the century of the medallion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the object's features**: The object is a round medallion with a tab at the top, likely for attachment. The design is in relief, featuring two human busts facing each other. This is known as a \"confronted busts\" motif. The artistic style is characteristic of the Hellenistic period, which followed the conquests of Alexander the Great.\n\n2.  **Identify the iconography**:\n    *   The figure on the left is a male ruler. He is identified by two key features: the diadem (a ribbon-like headband), which was a symbol of Hellenistic kingship, and a prominent ram's horn curling around his ear.\n    *   The ram's horn is the most crucial clue. It symbolizes the god Zeus-Ammon (a fusion of the Greek god Zeus and the Egyptian god Amun). Alexander the Great claimed to be the son of Zeus-Ammon, and later rulers of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt adopted this iconography to legitimize their rule and claim divinity. The ruler depicted is widely identified as Ptolemy II Philadelphos.\n    *   The figure on the right is a female, depicted with a similar regal bearing. Given her pairing with Ptolemy II, she is identified as his sister and wife, Arsinoe II.\n\n3.  **Establish the historical context and date**:\n    *   Ptolemy II Philadelphos ruled Egypt from 283 to 246 B.C.\n    *   He married his full sister, Arsinoe II, around 275 B.C. This sibling marriage was scandalous in the Greek world but was in line with ancient Egyptian pharaonic tradition.\n    *   After the marriage, they established a joint ruler cult as the *Theoi Adelphoi* (\"Brother-Sister Gods\"). Artworks like this medallion were created to promote this cult and celebrate their divine union.\n    *   Therefore, the medallion must have been created during the reign of Ptolemy II, specifically after his marriage to Arsinoe II. This places its creation date between c. 275 B.C. and 246 B.C.\n\n4.  **Determine the century**: The period from 275 B.C. to 246 B.C. falls entirely within the 3rd century B.C. (which covers the years from 300 B.C. to 201 B.C.). Archaeologists and historians unanimously ascribe this type of Ptolemaic object to this century.\n\n<<<3rd century B.C.>>>"
