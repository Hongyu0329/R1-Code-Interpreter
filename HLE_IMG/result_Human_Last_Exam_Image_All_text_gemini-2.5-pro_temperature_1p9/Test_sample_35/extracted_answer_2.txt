The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **V domain** of the **RAGE receptor**.

This protein could be used as a **prognostic marker**. The provided information indicates that S100B is "over-expressed" in pathological states and its binding to the RAGE receptor directly activates downstream pathways (such as NFκβ) that lead to neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. As the level of S100B directly correlates with the severity of these pathological outcomes, measuring its concentration can help predict the likely course and severity of the neurological disorder, which is the function of a prognostic marker.
