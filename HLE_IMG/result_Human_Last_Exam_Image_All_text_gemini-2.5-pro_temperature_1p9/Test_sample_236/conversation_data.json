    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the scientific name of the animal.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Image**\nThe image displays an insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the central focus. The background is a soft green and yellow blur, suggesting more of the same type of plant. The insect has a distinct and vibrant color pattern.\n\n**Step 2: Detailed Analysis of the Insect's Morphology**\n*   **Overall Shape:** The insect has the characteristic body plan of a \"true bug\" from the order Hemiptera. This is indicated by its shield-like shape, the visible triangular section behind the thorax (the scutellum), and the way its wings are folded flat over its abdomen.\n*   **Coloration:** The insect is primarily black with bright reddish-orange markings. A prominent reddish-orange band runs along the outer edge of its upper body, bordering the pronotum (the part of the thorax just behind the head) and the hemelytra (the leathery forewings).\n*   **Head:** The head is mostly black, but the large compound eyes are reddish-orange, matching the body markings.\n*   **Antennae and Legs:** It possesses long, black, segmented antennae and black legs.\n*   **Host Plant:** The flowers it is on appear to be a species of Goldenrod (*Solidago*), a common plant in North America. This can be a clue to the insect's identity, as many insects are associated with specific host plants.\n\n**Step 3: Identification Process and Elimination of Look-alikes**\nBased on the prominent red/orange and black pattern and its presence on a flowering plant, several common insects might come to mind. We need to compare them carefully.\n*   **Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*):** While also black and red, the Boxelder Bug has thin red lines on its thorax and wings, not the broad border seen on the insect in the image.\n*   **Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*):** This bug has a different pattern, typically featuring a black band across its orange back, forming an \"X\" shape when the wings are closed.\n*   **Goldenrod Soldier Beetle (*Chauliognathus pensylvanicus*):** This is a beetle (Order Coleoptera), not a true bug. Beetles have hardened wing covers (elytra) that meet in a straight line down the back and lack the visible triangular scutellum of a true bug. The coloration pattern is also different.\n*   **Bordered Plant Bug (Genus *Largus*):** The visual characteristics of the insect in the photograph—a black body with a continuous, distinct red or orange border around the pronotum and wings—are the defining features of the Bordered Plant Bugs from the family Largidae.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpointing the Species**\nWithin the genus *Largus*, the species *Largus succinctus* is a perfect match for the insect depicted. It is commonly known as the Red-bordered Plant Bug or Bordered Plant Bug. Its coloration and markings, including the reddish eyes and the specific pattern of the border, align exactly with the specimen in the photograph. This species is widespread and frequently found on various plants, including those in the Aster family like goldenrod.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe insect is a true bug (Hemiptera) from the family Largidae. Its distinctive coloration, a black body with a striking reddish-orange border, identifies it as a Bordered Plant Bug. The most fitting scientific name for the species with this specific appearance is *Largus succinctus*.\n\n<<<Largus succinctus>>>"
