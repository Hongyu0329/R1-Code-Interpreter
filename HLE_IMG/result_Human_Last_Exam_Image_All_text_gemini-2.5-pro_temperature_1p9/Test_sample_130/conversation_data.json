    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Image:** The image provided is an **emission spectrum**. This type of spectrum is created when an element is energized (for example, by heating it or passing an electric current through it), causing it to emit light. The light does not form a continuous rainbow but rather a series of discrete, bright colored lines at specific wavelengths. Each element has a unique emission spectrum, which acts like a \"fingerprint\" for that element.\n\n2.  **Observe the Pattern of Spectral Lines:** We need to carefully examine the pattern of the lines in the given spectrum across the visible range (from violet/blue on the left to red on the right).\n    *   **Red Region:** There is a very prominent, bright red line. There are also a few other, fainter red lines.\n    *   **Yellow-Orange Region:** There is a distinct and very bright yellow line.\n    *   **Green-Cyan Region:** There are several lines in this area. We can see a bright green line and a bright cyan (blue-green) line, along with some other less intense lines.\n    *   **Blue-Violet Region:** There are multiple lines in the blue and violet part of the spectrum.\n\n3.  **Compare with Known Elemental Spectra:** Now, we compare this observed pattern with the known emission spectra of some common elements.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** Hydrogen has a very simple spectrum in the visible range (the Balmer series) with one prominent red line (H-alpha), one cyan line (H-beta), and a couple of violet lines. The spectrum in the image is much more complex, with many more lines, especially the prominent yellow line, so it is not Hydrogen.\n    *   **Sodium (Na):** Sodium is famous for its very strong pair of yellow lines (a \"doublet\") that are very close together. While the image shows a yellow line, the overall spectrum with its many strong lines in the red, green, and blue regions does not match a pure sodium spectrum.\n    *   **Mercury (Hg):** Mercury has a characteristic spectrum with a strong, isolated green line, a blue-violet line, and a yellow doublet. The spectrum in the image has a group of green/cyan lines rather than one dominant, isolated green line. The overall pattern is different.\n    *   **Helium (He):** Helium has a well-known spectrum with several prominent lines spread across the visible range. Its most notable lines are: a strong red line (~668 nm), a very strong yellow line (~587 nm), a green line (~502 nm), a blue-green line (~492 nm), and a blue-violet line (~447 nm).\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The pattern in the image matches the known emission spectrum of Helium exceptionally well. The presence of strong, distinct lines in the red, yellow, green/cyan, and blue regions is the unique fingerprint of Helium. The image is a standard representation of the emission spectrum for the element Helium.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   Distinguish between emission spectra (bright lines on a dark background) and absorption spectra (dark lines on a continuous rainbow). This is clearly an emission spectrum.\n*   Note the relative brightness and spacing of the lines. It's not just about the colors present, but the specific pattern.\n*   Rely on well-known, characteristic lines of elements for identification. The strong yellow line combined with the strong red and multiple blue/green lines is highly characteristic of Helium.\n\nBy matching the observed spectral lines with known elemental spectra, we can confidently identify the element.\n\n<<<Helium>>>"
