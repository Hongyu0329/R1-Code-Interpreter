    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the title, musical style, and country of origin of the song from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Musicological Analysis:**\n    *   **Time Signature:** The piece is in 4/4 time.\n    *   **Key Signature:** The key signature is C major (no sharps or flats). The harmony confirms this, starting and frequently returning to a C major chord.\n    *   **Tempo and Style:** The top-left corner indicates a \"Medium\" tempo. The handwritten notation with chord symbols (C, E7, F, G7, etc.) above the staff is a \"lead sheet,\" common in jazz, pop, and various folk music traditions for improvisation and performance. The syncopated rhythm is a dominant feature.\n    *   **Form:** The instructions \"To Go Out - Take D.S. to Coda\" (Dal Segno al Coda) and the presence of a Coda section indicate a standard popular song structure with repeated sections and a special ending.\n\n2.  **Melodic Identification:**\n    *   The most crucial element for identification is the melody itself. Let's transcribe the first few measures of the main theme:\n    *   The song begins with a pickup note (an eighth note C).\n    *   The first full measure contains the notes: C (quarter), G (eighth), G (quarter), C (eighth). The rhythmic pattern is a bouncy \"long-short short-long\".\n    *   The second full measure continues this pattern with different notes: G (quarter), E (eighth), E (quarter), G (eighth).\n    *   This opening melodic figure—a descending fifth followed by a repeated note, then an answer with a descending third followed by a repeated note (in this key: C down to G, then G down to E)—is highly distinctive.\n    *   This melody is the primary theme of the famous Brazilian song **\"Tico-Tico no Fubá\"**.\n\n3.  **Determining the Title, Style, and Origin:**\n    *   **Title:** Based on the melodic identification, the song's title is \"Tico-Tico no Fubá.\" The title translates from Portuguese to \"Sparrow in the Cornmeal.\" It is often shortened to simply \"Tico-Tico.\"\n    *   **Musical Style:** The song was composed by Zequinha de Abreu in 1917. Its original musical style is **Choro**, a lively, fast, and highly syncopated instrumental genre from Brazil that predates Samba and is often considered a form of \"Brazilian ragtime.\" Because of its worldwide popularity, it is also frequently performed as a **Samba** or in a Latin-Jazz style. Choro is the most precise answer for its native style.\n    *   **Country of Origin:** The composer, Zequinha de Abreu, was Brazilian, and the musical style, Choro, originated in Brazil. Therefore, the country of origin for the song is **Brazil**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Arrangement vs. Original Style:** The lead sheet shows markings and chord choices (like the common use of a V7/vi, E7, in a C major context) that are typical of a jazz arrangement. However, the question asks about the song itself, not this specific arrangement. Therefore, the original style (Choro) is the most accurate answer.\n*   **Melody is Key:** In the absence of lyrics or a printed title, recognizing the melody is the definitive method of identification for such a well-known tune.\n*   **Handwritten Score:** The score being handwritten can lead to ambiguity, but the main notes, rhythms, and chord symbols are clear enough to identify the piece confidently. The core melodic contour is unmistakable.\n\n<<<Title: Tico-Tico no Fubá\nMusical Style: Choro / Samba\nCountry of Origin: Brazil>>>"
