    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Structure and Ligands:**\n    *   All four complexes are cationic iridium(III) coordination compounds with a pseudo-octahedral geometry.\n    *   The general formula is `[Ir(C^N)₂(N^N)]PF₆`.\n    *   The `N^N` ligand is the same in all four complexes: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dtbbpy). The bulky tert-butyl groups are primarily for solubility and preventing quenching, and since this ligand is constant, it's not the source of the difference in stability.\n    *   The `C^N` ligands are cyclometalating phenylpyridine-type ligands. These are the ligands that vary across the four complexes.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Variation in the Cyclometalating (C^N) Ligands:**\n    *   **Complex 1:** Uses 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (`dfppy`). It has two fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring.\n    *   **Complex 2:** Uses 2-phenylpyridine (`ppy`). It has no substituents on the phenyl ring.\n    *   **Complex 3:** Uses 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine (`Fppy`). It has one fluorine atom on the phenyl ring.\n    *   **Complex 4:** Uses 2-(2,3,4-trifluorophenyl)pyridine (`tfppy`). It has three fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring.\n\n3.  **Relate Ligand Structure to Complex Lifetime:**\n    *   The question asks about \"shorter lifetimes\". In the context of active emitters for devices like LECs (Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells) or OLEDs (Organic Light-Emitting Diodes), \"lifetime\" most commonly refers to the **operational lifetime** of the device, which is directly related to the **chemical stability** of the emitter molecule under operating conditions (electrical stress, heat, etc.).\n    *   A primary factor determining the stability of these iridium complexes is the strength of the bonds, particularly the Ir-C bond of the cyclometalating ligand. This bond is often a weak point and a site for degradation.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Effect of Fluorination on Stability:**\n    *   Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom. When it is used as a substituent on the phenyl ring of the `C^N` ligand, it has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect.\n    *   This electron-withdrawing effect lowers the energy of the orbitals on the phenyl ring, including the sigma orbital involved in the Ir-C bond. This stabilization leads to a **stronger Ir-C bond**.\n    *   A stronger Ir-C bond makes the complex more resistant to bond cleavage, which is a major degradation pathway.\n    *   Furthermore, replacing C-H bonds with much stronger C-F bonds also enhances the overall inertness of the ligand to chemical attack.\n    *   Therefore, fluorination of the cyclometalating ligand is a well-established strategy to increase the chemical stability and thus the operational lifetime of Ir(III) emitters.\n\n5.  **Rank the Complexes by Expected Stability/Lifetime:**\n    *   The stability of the complexes is expected to correlate with the degree of fluorination on the `C^N` ligand. More fluorine atoms generally lead to higher stability.\n    *   **Complex 2 (no F):** Lacks any fluorination. The Ir-C bond is the weakest among the four. It is expected to be the least stable and have the shortest lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 3 (one F):** Has one fluorine atom. This provides some stabilization compared to Complex 2, so its lifetime should be longer than that of Complex 2.\n    *   **Complex 1 (two F's):** The 2,4-difluoro substitution pattern is known to provide significant stability. It is expected to have a long lifetime, longer than both Complex 2 and Complex 3.\n    *   **Complex 4 (three F's):** With three fluorine atoms, this complex is heavily fluorinated and expected to be very stable, likely having the longest lifetime of the group.\n    *   Therefore, the predicted order of increasing lifetime is: **Complex 2 < Complex 3 < Complex 1 ≈ Complex 4**.\n\n6.  **Answer the Question:**\n    *   The question asks which complexes are expected to show **shorter** lifetimes.\n    *   Based on our stability ranking, Complexes 2 and 3 are the least stable members of the set. They have no fluorination or only light fluorination, respectively, compared to the heavily fluorinated and highly stable Complexes 1 and 4.\n    *   Thus, Complexes 2 and 3 are the ones expected to exhibit shorter operational lifetimes.\n\nFinal Conclusion: Complexes [2] and [3] are the ones with shorter lifetimes. This corresponds to option H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
