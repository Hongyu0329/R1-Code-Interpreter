    "*   **Step 1: Understand the question.**\n    The question asks to identify the pattern corresponding to a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure when viewed from the [110] direction. This involves understanding the atomic positions in an FCC lattice and how they project onto a plane perpendicular to the [110] vector.\n\n*   **Step 2: Characterize the FCC lattice.**\n    A face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice has atoms at the eight corners of a cube and at the center of each of its six faces. If we consider a conventional unit cell with side length 'a', the corner atoms are at positions like (0,0,0), (a,0,0), (0,a,0), etc., and the face-centered atoms are at positions like (a/2, a/2, 0), (a/2, 0, a/2), etc.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the projection along the [110] direction.**\n    When we view a crystal lattice along a specific crystallographic direction [hkl], we are projecting the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to this direction. We need to determine the resulting 2D pattern.\n    For an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction, the projection of the atomic positions forms a repeating pattern. The unit cell of this projected pattern is a **centered rectangle**.\n    This means the pattern consists of rectangles of atoms with an additional atom located in the center of each rectangle. The sides of this conceptual rectangle in the projection are related to the lattice constant 'a'; they have lengths 'a' and 'aâˆš2'.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the given image patterns.**\n    We will now examine each of the four patterns (A, B, C, D) to see which one matches the \"centered rectangle\" characteristic. The images show a 3D slice of the lattice, but we are interested in the 2D pattern formed by the atoms projected onto the viewing plane (the plane of the image).\n\n    *   **Pattern A:** The atoms are arranged in a clear rectangular grid. We can identify many rectangles formed by four atoms at their corners (e.g., the four atoms in the bottom left). However, there are no atoms in the centers of these rectangles. This represents a simple rectangular pattern, not a centered one.\n\n    *   **Pattern C:** The atoms are arranged in rows, where each row is horizontally shifted (offset) relative to the one above or below it. This staggered arrangement is characteristic of a hexagonal pattern. This pattern corresponds to the projection of an FCC lattice along the [111] direction, not [110].\n\n    *   **Pattern B:** This pattern is similar to C but sparser. It also shows offset rows, which is characteristic of a hexagonal-type projection. It is not a centered rectangle.\n\n    *   **Pattern D:** In this pattern, we can identify a clear centered rectangular unit. For example, consider the atoms at the approximate coordinates (0.5, 6), (3.5, 6), (0.5, 12), and (3.5, 12). These four atoms form the corners of a rectangle. There is another atom located at approximately (2, 9), which is at the center of this rectangle. This centered rectangular arrangement is repeated throughout the pattern shown in the image.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the analysis.**\n    Based on the step-by-step analysis, the projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction creates a centered rectangular pattern. Among the given options, only pattern D exhibits this characteristic atomic arrangement.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$."
