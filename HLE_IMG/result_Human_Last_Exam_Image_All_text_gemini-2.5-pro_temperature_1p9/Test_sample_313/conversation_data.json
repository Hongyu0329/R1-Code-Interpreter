    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\n*   The clue states: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows a man with a beard receiving a trophy from an older, white-haired man at what appears to be a formal awards ceremony.\n*   A search for major awards ceremonies on or around June 20, 2019, points to the NHL Awards, which were held on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas.\n*   The man receiving the award strongly resembles Russian hockey star Nikita Kucherov. In 2019, Kucherov was the biggest winner at the NHL Awards, taking home the Hart Memorial Trophy (league MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player voted by peers), and the Art Ross Trophy (top scorer).\n*   The image confirms the identification of Nikita Kucherov at the 2019 NHL Awards. This provides the first piece of context: the subject is related to ice hockey.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   The clue states: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This points to a historical industrial process. The most famous example of an industry that stopped using mercury salts due to toxicity is the hat-making industry.\n*   Specifically, mercuric nitrate was used in a process called \"carroting\" to treat animal fur to make high-quality felt for hats.\n*   Exposure to mercury vapor caused neurological damage in the workers, known as erethism or \"mad hatter disease.\" This is the origin of the \"Mad Hatter\" character.\n*   Therefore, the second clue is strongly related to hats, specifically felt hats, and the people who made them (hatters).\n\n**Step 3: Connect the two clues to find \"X Y\".**\n*   We need to find a two-word phrase, \"X Y,\" that links the subject of the picture (hockey player Nikita Kucherov) with the concept of mercury poisoning in the hat industry.\n*   The key connection between hockey and hats is the \"hat trick.\" In hockey, when a player scores three goals in a single game, it is called a hat trick, and fans traditionally celebrate by throwing their hats onto the ice.\n*   Nikita Kucherov is an elite goal-scorer who has recorded numerous hat tricks in his career. His presence in the picture, therefore, evokes the concept of a hat trick and, by extension, hats themselves.\n*   The object at the center of the mercury clue is the hat. Many hats, especially those from the era when mercury was used, were **felt hats**.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the final answer.**\n*   The two-word phrase that bridges both clues is \"Felt hat\".\n*   **Connection to Clue 1 (Image):** The image of the elite hockey player, Nikita Kucherov, indirectly represents a \"felt hat\" through the tradition of the hat trick.\n*   **Connection to Clue 2 (Mercury):** The manufacturing process for the \"felt hat\" is the one that has \"almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n\nTherefore, X Y is \"Felt hat\".\n\n<<<Felt hat>>>"
