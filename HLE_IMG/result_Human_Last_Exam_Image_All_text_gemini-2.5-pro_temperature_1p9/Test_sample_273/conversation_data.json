    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral centers and the carbon backbone.**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the connectivity of the atoms to identify the chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n\n1.  Let's trace the carbon chain. The drawing shows a central carbon skeleton with several substituents. By examining the connections, we can identify the longest carbon chain and the positions of functional groups.\n2.  Let's start from the right side. We have an aminomethyl group (`-CH2NH2`). Let the carbon of the `-CH2-` be **C1**.\n3.  C1 is attached to a carbon, let's call it **C2**, which has a methyl group (`-CH3`) attached. Since C2 is also attached to C1, C3 (to its left), and an implied hydrogen, it is bonded to four different groups and is a chiral center.\n4.  C2 is attached to **C3**, which has an ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`) attached. C3 is also bonded to C2, C4, and an implied hydrogen, making it a second chiral center.\n5.  C3 is attached to **C4**, which has a hydroxyl group (`-OH`) and a methyl group (`-CH3`). Since C4 is bonded to C3, OH, a methyl group, and an implied hydrogen, this is a third chiral center. The methyl group can be labeled as **C5**.\n6.  This connectivity matches the IUPAC name **4-hydroxy-3-ethyl-2-methylpentan-1-amine**. We will use this numbering (C1 to C5) to determine the configuration of the chiral centers at C2, C3, and C4.\n\n**Step 2: Assign priorities to the substituents on each chiral center using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.**\n\n*   **Priorities at C2:**\n    *   The groups attached to C2 are: `-H`, `-CH3` (from substituent), `-CH2NH2` (part of C1), and `-C3(H)(Et)C4...`.\n    *   To assign priority, we look at the atomic number of the atoms directly bonded to C2. All three non-hydrogen groups are carbons. We must look at the next atoms along each chain.\n        1.  `-C3...`: The C3 atom is attached to C4, a C from the ethyl group, and an H. The C4 is attached to an Oxygen. Path: C→C→O.\n        2.  `-C1H2NH2`: The C1 atom is attached to a Nitrogen, H, and H. Path: C→N.\n        3.  `-CH3`: The methyl carbon is attached to H, H, H. Path: C→H.\n    *   Comparing the paths at the first point of difference: C→N (atomic number 7) has priority over C→C→O (atomic number 6 for C), which has priority over C→H (atomic number 1).\n    *   The priority order for groups at C2 is:\n        1.  `-CH2NH2`\n        2.  `-C3H(Et)...`\n        3.  `-CH3`\n        4.  `-H`\n\n*   **Priorities at C3:**\n    *   The groups attached to C3 are: `-H`, `-CH2CH3` (Ethyl), `-C2...`, and `-C4...`.\n    *   We compare the groups attached to C3:\n        1.  `-C4...`: C4 is attached to O, C, H. High priority due to the oxygen.\n        2.  `-C2...`: C2 is attached to C, C, N (considering the atoms bonded to C2's neighbors).\n        3.  `-CH2CH3`: The ethyl's first carbon is attached to C, H, H.\n    *   Comparing the groups: `-C4...` (with O) > `-C2...` (C, C, N path) > `-CH2CH3` (C, H, H path).\n    *   The priority order for groups at C3 is:\n        1.  `-C4H(OH)CH3`\n        2.  `-C2H(CH3)CH2NH2`\n        3.  `-CH2CH3` (Ethyl)\n        4.  `-H`\n\n*   **Priorities at C4:**\n    *   The groups attached to C4 are: `-H`, `-OH`, `-CH3` (C5), and `-C3...`.\n    *   The priority order is based on the atomic number of the directly attached atom:\n        1.  `-OH` (Oxygen, Z=8)\n        2.  `-C3H(Et)...` (Carbon, Z=6)\n        3.  `-CH3` (Carbon, Z=6) -> Tie with C3 group is broken by what's attached to them. C3 is attached to other carbons, C5 methyl is attached only to hydrogens. So C3 > C5.\n        4.  `-H` (Hydrogen, Z=1)\n    * The priority order for groups at C4 is:\n        1.  `-OH`\n        2.  `-C3H(Et)C2...`\n        3.  `-CH3`\n        4.  `-H`\n\n**Step 3: Determine the configuration (R or S) for each chiral center.**\n\n*   **Configuration at C2:**\n    *   **Geometry:** The drawing shows the C2-C3 bond as a plain line. The `-CH2NH2` group (Priority 1) is on a wedge (front). The `-CH3` group (Priority 3) is on a dash (back). In this representation, the implied `-H` (Priority 4) and the C2-C3 bond lie in the plane of the drawing.\n    *   **Method:** With the lowest priority group (`-H`) in the plane, we can use the swap rule. We mentally swap `-H` with the group pointing back, which is `-CH3`.\n    *   Now `-H` is in the back. The order of the other groups is 1 (`-CH2NH2`, front) → 2 (`-C3`, plane) → 3 (`-CH3`, now in the plane).\n    *   This path from front (1) to plane (2) to plane (3) is **clockwise**.\n    *   Since we performed one swap, the assigned configuration is the true configuration. So, **C2 is R**.\n\n*   **Configuration at C3:**\n    *   **Geometry:** The C2-C3 and C3-C4 bonds are in the plane. The ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`, Priority 3) is on a wedge (front). This implies the `-H` (Priority 4) is on a dash (back).\n    *   **Method:** The lowest priority group (`-H`) is pointing away from us. We determine the direction of the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3.\n    *   The path is `-C4` (1) → `-C2` (2) → `-Ethyl` (3). This goes from left (plane) → right (plane) → front (wedge).\n    *   This describes a **counter-clockwise** turn.\n    *   So, **C3 is S**.\n\n*   **Configuration at C4:**\n    *   **Geometry:** The C3-C4 bond is in the plane. The drawing shows both the `-OH` group (Priority 1) and the `-CH3` group (Priority 3) on dashed bonds (back). This is geometrically impossible for a standard tetrahedral carbon. It represents a drawing error.\n    *   **Resolving Ambiguity:** We can infer the intended stereochemistry by observing the relative positions of the hydrogens on the backbone. H at C3 is back (dashed). For C4, with two groups dashed, the implied H must be forward (wedged). The relationship between H-C3 (back) and H-C4 (front) is `anti`. Such `anti` relationships often arise from stereocontrolled reactions and result in alternating (R,S,R...) configurations.\n    *   Given that we determined C3 to be S, an `anti` relationship to C4 would imply C4 is R.\n    *   **Method (assuming C4 is R):** Let's verify. If C4 is R, with H (Priority 4) in the front, the path 1 → 2 → 3 must appear counter-clockwise (S), which is then reversed to R. The path is `-OH` (1) → `-C3` (2) → `-CH3` (3). If the drawing were corrected to show, for example, `-OH` (wedge) and `-CH3` (dash), this would yield an R configuration. We will proceed assuming the relative stereochemistry implies **C4 is R**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results.**\n\nThe absolute configurations of the chiral centers are:\n*   C2: R\n*   C3: S\n*   C4: R\n\nThe full designation for this stereoisomer is **(2R, 3S, 4R)**.\n\n<<<2R, 3S, 4R>>>"
