    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm:**\n    Let's analyze the function `sort(a, n)` step by step.\n    *   The function is recursive. The base case is when `n <= 1`. In this case, the `if n > 1:` condition is false, and the function does nothing, which is correct as an array with 0 or 1 element is already sorted.\n    *   `if n > 1:`:\n        1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: This is a recursive call. The intention is to sort the first `n-1` elements of the array `a`, which are `a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-2]`.\n        2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:`: After the first `n-1` elements are supposedly sorted, this line compares the `n`-th element (`a[n-1]`) with the `(n-1)`-th element (`a[n-2]`). If the first `n-1` elements are sorted, `a[n-2]` would be the largest among them.\n        3.  `swap(a[n-1], a[n-2])`: If the `n`-th element is smaller than the `(n-1)`-th element, they are swapped. This is similar to a step in Bubble Sort, where an element is \"bubbled\" towards its correct position.\n        4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: This is the crucial part. If a swap occurred, the new element at `a[n-2]` might not be in the correct position relative to the rest of the `a[0...n-2]` subarray. For example, the smallest element of the entire array might have just been moved to `a[n-2]`. Therefore, the algorithm makes another recursive call to re-sort the first `n-1` elements.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation:**\n    Let `T(n)` represent the time taken by the algorithm for an input of size `n`.\n    *   The `swap` and the `if` comparison take constant time, let's denote this by `O(1)` or `c`.\n    *   The first recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` takes `T(n - 1)`.\n    *   The second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` is conditional. It is executed only if `a[n-1] < a[n-2]`.\n\n    Therefore, the recurrence relation can be written as:\n    *   **Best Case:** If the array is already sorted, the condition `a[n-1] < a[n-2]` will always be false. The second recursive call is never made. The recurrence is `T(n) = T(n-1) + c`, which solves to `O(n)`.\n    *   **Worst Case:** The worst case occurs when the condition `a[n-1] < a[n-2]` is true for every step `n, n-1, ..., 2`. This forces the second recursive call to be executed every time. In this scenario, the recurrence relation is:\n        `T(n) = T(n - 1) + c + T(n - 1)`\n        `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n\n3.  **Solve the Worst-Case Recurrence Relation:**\n    We need to solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`, with the base case `T(1) = c'`.\n\n    Let's expand the relation:\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n    *   `= 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n    *   `= 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    *   `= 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) + ... + 2^0)`\n\n    We continue this expansion until we reach the base case, `T(1)`. This happens when `n-k = 1`, or `k = n-1`.\n    *   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-2) + ... + 1)`\n\n    The sum `(1 + 2 + ... + 2^(n-2))` is a geometric series with sum `(2^(n-1) - 1) / (2-1) = 2^(n-1) - 1`.\n    *   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c' + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n    *   `T(n) = c' * 2^(n-1) + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n    *   `T(n) = (c' + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\n    Asymptotically, the dominant term is `2^(n-1)`, so the time complexity is `O(2^(n-1))`, which is equivalent to `O(2^n)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Recursive Structure:** It is crucial to correctly identify the number of recursive calls in the worst-case scenario. The presence of two recursive calls `sort(a, n-1)` inside the function body points towards an exponential complexity if both are executed frequently.\n*   **Conditional Call:** The second recursive call is conditional. The analysis must consider the worst-case scenario where this condition is always met, leading to the `T(n) = 2*T(n-1) + c` relation. An example of a worst-case input is a reverse-sorted array.\n*   **Distinguishing from other algorithms:** Although it has a `swap` operation like Bubble Sort, the recursive structure is very different and much less efficient. It is not `O(n^2)`. It is also not like Merge Sort, where the problem is divided into two *halves* (`T(n/2)`), but rather into two full `n-1` subproblems, leading to exponential work.\n*   **Solving the Recurrence:** The correct expansion of the recurrence relation confirms the exponential growth. `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1)` is the classic recurrence for a complexity of `O(2^n)`.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe analysis leads to the worst-case recurrence relation `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`. Solving this recurrence gives a time complexity of `O(2^n)`.\n\nFinal check of the options:\nA. O(n) - This is the best-case complexity.\nB. O(n log n) - Typical for efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort.\nC. O(n^2) - Typical for simple sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort.\nD. O(n^3)\nE. O(2^n) - Matches our analysis for the worst-case.\nF. does not terminate - The algorithm does terminate because the size of the problem `n` decreases with each recursive call.\n\nThe worst-case time complexity is `O(2^n)`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
