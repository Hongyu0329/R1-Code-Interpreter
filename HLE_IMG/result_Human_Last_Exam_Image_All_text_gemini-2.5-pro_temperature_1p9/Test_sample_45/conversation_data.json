    "*   **Step 1: Understand Rotational Symmetry**\n    Rotational symmetry describes how many times an object or pattern looks identical when rotated by less than a full 360 degrees around a central point. The \"order\" of rotational symmetry is the number of these identical positions in a single 360-degree turn. For example, a square has 4-fold rotational symmetry because it looks the same after rotations of 90°, 180°, and 270°.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Tiling's Components**\n    The tiling is a repeating pattern made up of several distinct geometric shapes (tiles):\n    *   Dark blue regular hexagons.\n    *   Light yellow regular squares.\n    *   Orange rhombi (diamond shapes).\n    *   Light yellow irregular pentagons.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify Potential Centers of Rotation**\n    To find the rotational symmetry of the entire pattern, we need to find a point in the tiling and see how many times the pattern looks the same when we rotate it around that point. The best places to look are the centers of the most symmetrical shapes or the points where multiple shapes meet.\n\n*   **Step 4: Test a Potential Center of Rotation**\n    Let's choose the center of one of the dark blue hexagons as our potential center of rotation.\n    1.  The hexagon itself is a regular hexagon, which has 6-fold rotational symmetry. This means if we rotate just the hexagon by 60° (which is 360°/6), it looks the same.\n    2.  Now, let's examine the shapes surrounding this central hexagon. Attached to each of the six sides of the hexagon is an identical light-yellow pentagon. This ring of six pentagons is arranged symmetrically around the hexagon.\n    3.  Beyond the pentagons, there is another ring of shapes: six light-yellow squares and six orange rhombi, arranged in an alternating pattern. This entire cluster of shapes is also arranged symmetrically around the central hexagon.\n    4.  If we rotate the entire tiling by 60° around the center of this hexagon, the central hexagon maps onto itself. Each surrounding pentagon moves to the position previously occupied by its neighbor. Each square in the next ring moves to the position of another square, and each rhombus moves to the position of another rhombus. The entire pattern appears unchanged.\n    5.  Since the pattern looks identical after a 60° rotation, and this can be done 6 times to make a full 360° circle (60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300°, 360°), this point is a center of 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n*   **Step 5: Determine the Overall Rotational Symmetry**\n    A tiling can have multiple centers of rotation with different orders. For example, the center of a square in this pattern is a center of 4-fold rotation. However, the rotational symmetry of the *tiling as a whole* is defined by the highest order of rotational symmetry found at any point. Since we have found a point with 6-fold rotational symmetry, and for periodic tilings in a plane, 6 is the highest possible order (according to the Crystallographic Restriction Theorem), the rotational symmetry of this tiling is 6-fold.\n\n<<<6>>>"
