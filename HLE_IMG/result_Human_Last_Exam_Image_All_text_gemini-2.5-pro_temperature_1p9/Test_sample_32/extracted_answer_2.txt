The main distinguishing feature of the sporophyte is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, causing the capsule to be held erect and immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a strongly curved (arcuate) seta, which causes the capsule to be bent over to the side.
