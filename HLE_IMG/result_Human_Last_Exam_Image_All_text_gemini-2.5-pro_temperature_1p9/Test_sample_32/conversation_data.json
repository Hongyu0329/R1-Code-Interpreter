    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to distinguish the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question and the key botanical terms.**\nThe question asks for the main difference in the **sporophyte** that allows for a quick visual distinction between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. The sporophyte in mosses is the spore-producing generation, which typically consists of three parts:\n*   **Foot:** Anchors the sporophyte to the green, leafy gametophyte.\n*   **Seta:** The stalk that elevates the capsule.\n*   **Capsule:** The structure at the top of the seta that produces and releases spores.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the species name *Grimmia curviseta*.**\nThe specific epithet, *curviseta*, provides a major clue. In Latin:\n*   *curvus* means \"curved\".\n*   *seta* refers to the stalk of the sporophyte.\nTherefore, the name *Grimmia curviseta* itself means \"Grimmia with a curved stalk\".\n\n**Step 3: Examine the characteristics of the *Grimmia montana* sporophyte.**\n*   *Grimmia montana* has a very short and **straight** seta.\n*   Because the seta is short and straight, the capsule is held upright and is described as \"immersed\" or \"emergent,\" meaning it is nestled among the upper leaves of the moss plant and does not extend far above them.\n*   The image provided, which shows *Grimmia montana*, illustrates this feature perfectly. The capsules are erect, and the short, straight stalks are barely visible.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the characteristics of the *Grimmia curviseta* sporophyte.**\n*   As its name implies, the defining characteristic of the *Grimmia curviseta* sporophyte is its seta.\n*   The seta is distinctly **curved** or **arcuate**, sometimes described as \"cygneous\" (like a swan's neck).\n*   This strong curvature causes the capsule to be bent over, often pointing sideways or even downwards, rather than being held erect.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the main difference.**\nBased on the analysis, the most significant and easily observable difference between the sporophytes of the two species is the **shape and orientation of the seta**.\n*   In **Grimmia montana**, the seta is short and straight, resulting in an erect, immersed capsule.\n*   In **Grimmia curviseta**, the seta is strongly curved, causing the capsule to be bent over.\n\nThis difference in the seta's curvature is a reliable feature to distinguish the two species \"at a glance\" when they are fertile (i.e., when sporophytes are present).\n\n<<<The main distinguishing feature of the sporophyte is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, causing the capsule to be held erect and immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a strongly curved (arcuate) seta, which causes the capsule to be bent over to the side."
