    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage reduction in total Car VMT by comparing the \"Proposed\" scenario (Table 2) to the \"Baseline\" scenario (Table 1). The formula for percentage reduction is:\n`Percentage Reduction = (VMT_Baseline - VMT_Proposed) / VMT_Baseline * 100%`\n\n**2. Interpret the Data Tables**\n*   The tables show mode shares for different trip distance categories.\n*   The modes include \"walk,\" \"bike,\" and \"transit,\" which are person-centric. This indicates that the \"share of total trips\" and the mode shares within the table refer to **person-trips**, not vehicle-trips.\n*   **VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled)** is calculated based on the number of *vehicle* trips, not person-trips. Therefore, we must convert the person-trips made by car into vehicle-trips.\n\n**3. Define the Conversion from Person-Trips to Vehicle-Trips**\n*   **Car, 1 occupant (SOV):** Each person-trip corresponds to one vehicle-trip. The occupancy is 1.\n*   **Car, with more than 2 occupants (Carpool):** The number of vehicle-trips is the number of person-trips divided by the average carpool occupancy.\n    *   Baseline Average Carpool Occupancy = 2.8\n    *   Proposed Average Carpool Occupancy = 3.0\n\n**4. Formulate the VMT Calculation**\nTo find the total VMT for each scenario, we will calculate a weighted sum of VMT across the four distance categories. We can calculate a proportional VMT value by assuming a total number of person-trips (e.g., 100) or by calculating the average VMT per person-trip. The latter is done with the following formula for each distance category `i`:\n\n`VMT_contribution_i = (Share of Total Trips_i) * [ (Share of SOV Trips_i / 1) + (Share of Carpool Trips_i / Avg Carpool Occupancy) ] * (Average Trip Distance_i)`\n\nThe total VMT is the sum of these contributions from all four categories.\n\n### Calculation for Baseline VMT\n\n**Data:**\n*   Average Carpool Occupancy = 2.8\n\n**Calculations by Distance Category:**\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    `VMT = 0.48 * (0.25 / 1 + 0.28 / 2.8) * 1`\n    `VMT = 0.48 * (0.25 + 0.1) * 1 = 0.48 * 0.35 = 0.168`\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    `VMT = 0.22 * (0.38 / 1 + 0.43 / 2.8) * 4`\n    `VMT = 0.22 * (0.38 + 0.1536) * 4 = 0.22 * 0.5336 * 4 = 0.4695`\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    `VMT = 0.14 * (0.40 / 1 + 0.45 / 2.8) * 7.5`\n    `VMT = 0.14 * (0.40 + 0.1607) * 7.5 = 0.14 * 0.5607 * 7.5 = 0.5888`\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    `VMT = 0.16 * (0.42 / 1 + 0.47 / 2.8) * 20`\n    `VMT = 0.16 * (0.42 + 0.1679) * 20 = 0.16 * 0.5879 * 20 = 1.8811`\n\n**Total Baseline VMT (proportional):**\n`VMT_Baseline = 0.168 + 0.4695 + 0.5888 + 1.8811 = 3.1074`\n\n### Calculation for Proposed VMT\n\n**Data:**\n*   Average Carpool Occupancy = 3.0\n\n**Calculations by Distance Category:**\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    `VMT = 0.48 * (0.01 / 1 + 0.02 / 3.0) * 1`\n    `VMT = 0.48 * (0.01 + 0.0067) * 1 = 0.48 * 0.0167 = 0.0080`\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    `VMT = 0.22 * (0.08 / 1 + 0.19 / 3.0) * 4`\n    `VMT = 0.22 * (0.08 + 0.0633) * 4 = 0.22 * 0.1433 * 4 = 0.1261`\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    `VMT = 0.14 * (0.14 / 1 + 0.27 / 3.0) * 7.5`\n    `VMT = 0.14 * (0.14 + 0.09) * 7.5 = 0.14 * 0.23 * 7.5 = 0.2415`\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    `VMT = 0.16 * (0.16 / 1 + 0.33 / 3.0) * 20`\n    `VMT = 0.16 * (0.16 + 0.11) * 20 = 0.16 * 0.27 * 20 = 0.8640`\n\n**Total Proposed VMT (proportional):**\n`VMT_Proposed = 0.0080 + 0.1261 + 0.2415 + 0.8640 = 1.2396`\n\n### Calculate Percentage Reduction\n\n1.  **Calculate the VMT reduction:**\n    `Reduction = VMT_Baseline - VMT_Proposed = 3.1074 - 1.2396 = 1.8678`\n\n2.  **Calculate the percentage reduction:**\n    `Percentage Reduction = (Reduction / VMT_Baseline) * 100%`\n    `Percentage Reduction = (1.8678 / 3.1074) * 100% = 60.11%`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 60.1%.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{60.1}$."
