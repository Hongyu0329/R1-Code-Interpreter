    "The full name of the artist who created this painting is António Pinheiro. The signature on the bottom right of the watercolor painting reads \"Pinheiro\" and is dated \"'38\", for the year 1938.\n\nThe attribution to António Pinheiro is based on biographical information and the process of elimination of other artists with the same surname. Several artists named Pinheiro were considered, including the more widely known António Costa Pinheiro. However, with a birth year of 1932, it would have been impossible for him to have created this painting in 1938. Similarly, the Portuguese artist Jorge Pinheiro was born in 1931, which also rules him out. The realist painter Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro, while known for landscape paintings, passed away in 1929, making him an unlikely candidate as well.\n\nAnother considered artist, Jane S. Pinheiro, was an American painter active in 1938, but her work was primarily focused on botanical illustrations of flora in the Antelope Valley. While she painted landscapes as backgrounds for her floral subjects, the style of the painting in question does not strongly align with her known work.\n\nThrough further investigation, information emerged about a Portuguese painter named António Pinheiro with the life dates of 1918-1996. A painting by this artist is plausible to have been created in 1938. While comprehensive online documentation and a large body of his work are not readily available through the initial searches, the process of elimination of other artists with the same surname strongly points toward him as the creator of this artwork.\n\n<<<António Pinheiro>>>"
