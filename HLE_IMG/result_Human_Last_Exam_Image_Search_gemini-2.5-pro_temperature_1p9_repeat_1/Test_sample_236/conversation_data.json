    "The animal depicted in the center of the image is the Small Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name is *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\nThis insect is identifiable by its distinct orange and black markings, which include a reddish-orange 'X' on its back and a band of the same color across its pronotum (the plate-like structure behind the head). It has a black head, often with a red spot on top.\n\nAlthough its common name refers to milkweed, the Small Milkweed Bug is known to be an opportunistic feeder. While its life cycle is often associated with milkweed plants, on which it lays eggs, it also feeds on the nectar and seeds of various other plants, including goldenrod (*Solidago*), as seen in the photograph. The bugs are also known to scavenge on dead insects and prey on other small arthropods.\n\nThe bright coloration of the Small Milkweed Bug serves as a warning to potential predators, indicating that it is toxic or distasteful, a defense mechanism derived from the toxic compounds it sequesters from feeding on milkweed.\n\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"
