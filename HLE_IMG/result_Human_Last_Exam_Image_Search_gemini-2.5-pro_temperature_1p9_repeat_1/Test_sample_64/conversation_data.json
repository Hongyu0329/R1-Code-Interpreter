    "The image provided illustrates the biological process of **clamp connection formation** in a filamentous fungus. This process is a distinctive feature of many fungi belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota.\n\nThe sequence of images, labeled L, M, and N, shows the key stages of this process as observed under a microscope:\n*   In panel **L**, a segment of a fungal hypha (a filamentous cellular structure) is shown. The arrowhead points to a septum, which is a cross-wall that divides the hypha into separate cells.\n*   In panel **M**, a small, hook-like bulge begins to form near the septum. This is the initial stage of the clamp connection.\n*   In panel **N**, this hook has elongated and is growing backward, creating a bridge that will eventually fuse with the sub-apical (the cell just behind the tip) cell.\n\nThe primary function of clamp connection formation is to ensure that when a dikaryotic cell (a cell containing two distinct nuclei) divides, each new daughter cell also receives one of each type of nucleus. This maintains genetic variation throughout the growing fungal mycelium. Studies on fungi like *Schizophyllum commune* and *Pleurotus ostreatus* have detailed how this process is coordinated with the synchronous division of the two nuclei within the cell. The presence or absence of clamp connections is an important characteristic used by mycologists in the classification of fungal species.\n\n<<<clamp connection formation>>>"
