    "The figure leaving the chariot is the goddess **Aphrodite**.\n\nThis scene is depicted on an Attic red-figure pelike dating from approximately 450–440 B.C. The vase is attributed to the circle of the ancient Greek vase-painter Polygnotos and is housed in the Musée d'art et d'histoire in Geneva.\n\nThe image portrays a scene from the Gigantomachy, the mythological battle between the Olympian gods and the Giants. In this specific interpretation of the event:\n*   The figure driving the chariot, distinguished by patterned sleeves and a cap, is **Artemis**.\n*   The winged figure flying overhead is **Nike**, the goddess of victory.\n*   The nude man lying on the ground is a defeated **Giant**.\n*   The figure stepping out of the chariot is **Aphrodite**.\n\nWhile Aphrodite's role in the Gigantomachy was not as prominent as that of other gods like Athena or Ares, she was a participant in the victorious battle. Her departure from the chariot, assisted by the victorious Artemis and Nike, signifies the conclusion of the conflict.\n\n<<<Aphrodite>>>"
