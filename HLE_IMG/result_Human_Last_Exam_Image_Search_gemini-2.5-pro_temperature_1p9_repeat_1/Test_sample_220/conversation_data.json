    "To determine which pattern represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the direction, we need to analyze the expected arrangement of atoms in this specific projection.\n\n### Analysis of the FCC Projection:\n\n1.  **FCC Structure:** In a face-centered cubic lattice, atoms are located at each corner of the cube and in the center of each of the six faces.\n\n2.  **The (110) Plane:** When viewing a crystal along the direction, we are looking directly at the (110) crystallographic planes. In an FCC unit cell, the (110) plane slices diagonally through the cell, intersecting four corner atoms and two face-centered atoms. This arrangement forms a rectangle with atoms at the four corners and one atom in the very center of the rectangle.\n\n3.  **Projected Pattern:** When viewing the structure along the direction, atoms from successive layers are projected onto a single 2D plane. The projection of an FCC lattice along the axis results in a repeating pattern of these centered rectangles. The atoms in the layer immediately behind the first will be projected into the spaces of the first layer, creating a distinct, repeating pattern.\n\n### Evaluation of the Options:\n\n*   **Image A:** This image displays a simple rectangular lattice. The atoms are only at the corners of the repeating rectangular unit. This does not match the centered-rectangle characteristic of the FCC view.\n*   **Image B:** This image shows a pattern where the fundamental repeating unit (outlined by the dashed lines) is a rectangle with atoms at its corners and an atom in the center. This arrangement precisely matches the known projection of an FCC lattice along the direction.\n*   **Image C:** The atomic arrangement here has a hexagonal appearance. This is characteristic of an FCC lattice viewed along the direction, which is the close-packed direction.\n*   **Image D:** This pattern consists of two overlapping simple rectangular grids. While it's a cubic projection, it does not fit the specific arrangement for an FCC view.\n\nBased on this analysis, the pattern in Image B correctly represents a face-centered cubic structure as viewed along the direction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
