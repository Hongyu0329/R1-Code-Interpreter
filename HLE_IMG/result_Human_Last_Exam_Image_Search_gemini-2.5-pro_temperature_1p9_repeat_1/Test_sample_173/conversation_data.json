    "To determine the time signature of the provided musical measure, one must count the total duration of the notes within the bar for each staff.\n\nThe image provided is a measure from Frédéric Chopin's Étude Op. 10, No. 4 in C-sharp minor. This piece is known for its continuous sixteenth notes.\n\nAn analysis of the notes in the measure reveals the following:\n*   **Top staff (treble clef):** The notes are grouped in a way that clearly shows four distinct beats. Each beat is equivalent to a quarter note, as they are composed of four sixteenth notes or a sixteenth rest and three sixteenth notes. In total, the four groups add up to four quarter notes.\n*   **Bottom staff (treble clef):** This staff contains a half note followed by two quarter notes. The total duration is also four quarter notes.\n\nSince both staves contain a total of four quarter notes per measure, the time signature is 4/4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
