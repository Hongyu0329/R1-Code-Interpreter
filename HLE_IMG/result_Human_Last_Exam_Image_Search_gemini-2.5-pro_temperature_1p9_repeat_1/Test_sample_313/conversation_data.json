    "The two-word term \"X Y\" is **Dental Amalgam**.\n\nHere is how the clues connect to the answer:\n\n*   **The visual clue:** The image from June 20, 2019, shows Spanish comedian Andreu Buenafuente receiving an award from politician Miguel √Ångel Revilla. A key feature of the image is Buenafuente's wide smile, clearly showing his teeth. The scene, which brings together two well-known personalities, can be described as a \"mixture\" or \"blend\" of figures. This forms a visual pun for \"Dental Amalgam,\" with \"dental\" referring to the teeth and \"amalgam\" to the mixture.\n\n*   **The chemical clue:** Dental amalgam is a tooth-filling material that is approximately 50% mercury mixed with other metals. For over 150 years, it was a staple of dentistry, but its use has significantly declined and is being phased out globally due to health and environmental concerns over mercury's toxicity. The European Parliament, for instance, has banned the use of dental amalgam starting from January 1, 2025. This matches the description that \"another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts\".\n\n<<<Dental Amalgam>>>"
