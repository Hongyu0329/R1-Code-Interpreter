    "The protein shown in the image is named **Cerulean**.\n\nThis protein is a cyan fluorescent protein, which is a variant of the well-known Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) originally isolated from the jellyfish *Aequorea victoria*. The specific structure depicted is the blue-light irradiated form of Cerulean, and its three-dimensional coordinates are available in the Protein Data Bank under the accession code 5OXB.\n\nCerulean and other fluorescent proteins are widely used in biomedical research as markers to visualize proteins and processes within living cells. They are engineered through mutations to exhibit different colors and improved properties.\n\n<<<Cerulean>>>"
