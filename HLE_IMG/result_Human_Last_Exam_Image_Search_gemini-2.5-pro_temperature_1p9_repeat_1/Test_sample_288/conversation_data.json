    "The building in the image is the Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox in Spokane, Washington. It is an Art Deco movie theater built in 1931 that now serves as a performing arts venue and is home to the Spokane Symphony.\n\nOn October 12, 2023, the musical artist Metric performed at The Roxy in Los Angeles, so it was not them. However, on the same day, Morrissey played at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta, GA. Further searching shows that comedian Nick Swardson performed at the Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox on October 12, 2024, not 2023.\n\nBased on available information, there is no record of a musical artist playing at the Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox on October 12, 2023.\n\n<<<No musical artist is listed as playing at the Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox on October 12, 2023.>>>"
