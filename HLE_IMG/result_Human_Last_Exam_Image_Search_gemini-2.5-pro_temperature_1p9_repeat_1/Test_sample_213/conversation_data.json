    "The provided sheet music is the opening of the second act of the opera \"Elektra\" by Richard Strauss.\n\nA detailed analysis of the score reveals several key indicators pointing to this opera. The instrumentation, which includes a large orchestra with prominent parts for the English horn, multiple violin sections (some with mutes, or \"mit Dämpfer\"), a solo viola (\"Solo Br.\"), and cellos, is characteristic of Richard Strauss's orchestrally rich compositions. The German instructions on the score, such as \"(Vorhang)\" for \"curtain,\" \"(die übrigen)\" for \"the others,\" and \"mit Dämpfer\" for \"with mute,\" clearly indicate a German opera.\n\nThe musical style itself—highly expressive, with dense textures, chromatic harmonies, and dramatic dynamic shifts from *pianissimo* (pp) to *mezzo-forte* (mf)—is a hallmark of Strauss's post-romantic, expressionist period, particularly in *Elektra*. This opera, a one-act tragedy based on the ancient Greek play by Sophocles, is known for its modernist leanings and intense musical language. The opera premiered in Dresden in 1909, with a libretto by Hugo von Hofmannsthal. The specific musical passage in the image perfectly matches the beginning of the second scene (often considered the start of the second part in performance) of *Elektra*, which follows the initial confrontation of the maids.\n\n<<<Elektra by Richard Strauss>>>"
