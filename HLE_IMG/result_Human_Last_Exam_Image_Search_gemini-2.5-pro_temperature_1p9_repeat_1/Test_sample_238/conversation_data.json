    "The small, black, pin-like organisms growing on the surface of the shelf fungus in the photo are the fruiting bodies (sporangia) of a slime mold.\n\nSlime molds are unique organisms that are not fungi, plants, or animals, but belong to a group called Protista. They spend part of their lives as single-celled organisms and can aggregate to form multicellular structures to reproduce. These organisms feed on bacteria, spores, and decaying organic matter.\n\nThe structures seen in the image are sporangia, which are stalked capsules that produce and release spores. This reproductive stage often occurs when the slime mold is exposed to light. There are many different species of slime mold that produce these pin-like sporangia, with a common example found on decaying wood and fungi being from the genus *Hemitrichia* or *Trichia*. The larger shelf-like fungus, likely a species of *Trametes*, provides a moist, nutrient-rich surface for the slime mold to grow on.\n\nWhile some molds that grow on fungi can be \"pin molds\" like *Rhizopus* or *Mucor*, the distinct, clearly separated stalk and head on a hard bracket fungus is more characteristic of a slime mold's reproductive stage.<<<Slime mold (Myxomycetes)>>>"
