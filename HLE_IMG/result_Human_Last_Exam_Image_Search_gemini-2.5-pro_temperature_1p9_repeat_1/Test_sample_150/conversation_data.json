    "The provided reaction sequence outlines a multi-step organic synthesis. Let's analyze each transformation to identify the final product.\n\n*   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n    The first reaction involves benzene and propanoyl chloride with aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) as a catalyst. This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation. An acyl group is attached to the benzene ring, resulting in the formation of a ketone. In this specific case, the reaction yields **propiophenone** (also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n    \n    **Intermediate-1: Propiophenone**\n\n*   **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination**\n    Intermediate-1 (propiophenone) is then treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The propanoyl group is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the benzene ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position. Therefore, a bromine atom is substituted onto the benzene ring at the position meta to the carbonyl group. This results in the formation of **1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one**.\n    \n    **Intermediate-2: 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one**\n\n*   **Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation/Reduction**\n    Intermediate-2 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction condition is capable of two key reductions. First, it reduces the ketone group to a methylene group (-CH₂-). Second, it can cause the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of the carbon-bromine bond on the aromatic ring. It is therefore highly probable that both the ketone and the bromo group are reduced, converting the entire 3-bromo-propanoyl substituent into a simple propyl group.\n    \n    **Intermediate-3: Propylbenzene**\n\n*   **Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n    The final step involves treating Intermediate-3 (propylbenzene) with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, ((PhCO₂)₂), as a radical initiator. This set of reagents is specific for free-radical bromination at the benzylic position—the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. For propylbenzene, this reaction selectively substitutes a hydrogen atom on the first carbon of the propyl chain with a bromine atom, leading to the final product.\n\n**Product: (1-bromopropyl)benzene**\n\nBased on the systematic analysis of each reaction step, the final product is **(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\n<<< (1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
