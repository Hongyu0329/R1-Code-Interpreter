    "The final product's molecular formula is determined by analyzing the sequence of chemical reactions shown in the image.\n\n**Reaction Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Deprotection**\n    The starting material is 2-(4-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. Its molecular formula is calculated to be C₁₄H₁₄F₃NO₂. The first reaction uses ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) in an acetonitrile/water mixture. CAN is a common reagent used to remove the *p*-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group from a nitrogen atom. This oxidative cleavage results in the formation of Intermediate 1, which is the starting molecule without the PMB group and with a hydrogen atom on the nitrogen. Intermediate 1 is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one, and its molecular formula is C₆H₆F₃NO. The removed portion corresponds to p-anisaldehyde (C₈H₈O₂), a typical byproduct of this reaction.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Hydrogenation**\n    Intermediate 1 is then treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium on carbon catalyst (Pd/C) in methanol (MeOH). This is a standard catalytic hydrogenation reaction that reduces the carbon-carbon double bond. The double bond in the bicyclic ring of Intermediate 1 is saturated by adding two hydrogen atoms. This leads to the formation of Intermediate 2, 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one. The molecular formula of Intermediate 2 is therefore C₆H₈F₃NO.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Hydrolysis**\n    In the final step, Intermediate 2 is heated with 4 N hydrochloric acid (HCl). These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a lactam (a cyclic amide). The hydrolysis reaction cleaves the amide bond within the bicyclic structure by adding one molecule of water (H₂O). This opens the ring to form a product that is an amino acid. The reaction adds one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms to the molecule.\n\n**Molecular Formula Determination:**\n\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 2:** C₆H₈F₃NO\n*   **Addition from hydrolysis:** + H₂O\n*   **Formula of Final Product:** C₆H(₈+₂)F₃NO(₁₊₁) = C₆H₁₀F₃NO₂\n\nThe final product is a substituted aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid with the molecular formula C₆H₁₀F₃NO₂.\n\n<<<C6H10F3NO2>>>"
