The structure of product C is the mixed anhydride formed by the reaction of the carboxylic acid group of (3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)proline with acetic anhydride. Product A is proposed to be the acetylated cycloadduct formed after initial decarboxylation of the starting material and subsequent [3+2] cycloaddition with methyl propiolate. Product B is suggested to be the result of a Michael addition followed by a cyclization-elimination cascade, losing a molecule of methanol.
