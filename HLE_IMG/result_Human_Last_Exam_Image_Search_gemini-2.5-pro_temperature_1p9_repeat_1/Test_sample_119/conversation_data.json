    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)\n*   The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M⁺) at **m/z = 135**.\n*   According to the nitrogen rule, a molecule with an odd molecular weight typically contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms. This suggests the presence of at least one nitrogen atom.\n*   Assuming the compound contains C, H, and one N, a plausible molecular formula is **C₉H₁₃N** (9 × 12.01 + 13 × 1.01 + 1 × 14.01 ≈ 135.21 g/mol).\n*   The degree of unsaturation for C₉H₁₃N is calculated as: DoU = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 4. This value is characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectrum\n*   **~3300 cm⁻¹ (broad):** Indicates an N-H stretch. The shape could be consistent with a primary amine (-NH₂), which typically shows two peaks that can sometimes merge into a broad signal.\n*   **~3050 cm⁻¹:** Aromatic C-H stretching.\n*   **~2950 cm⁻¹:** Aliphatic C-H stretching.\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹ and ~1490 cm⁻¹:** C=C stretching, characteristic of an aromatic ring.\nThese features suggest the compound is a primary aromatic amine with an alkyl side chain.\n\n### 3. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectroscopy\n*   **¹³C NMR signals:** There are 7 distinct carbon signals at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm.\n    *   The four signals in the range of 126-146 ppm are indicative of an aromatic ring. The presence of 7 signals for a 9-carbon molecule (C₉H₁₃N) implies some symmetry, such as equivalent ortho and meta carbons in a monosubstituted phenyl group.\n*   **DEPT-135 Data:** One negative signal (CH₂) and five positive signals (CH and CH₃).\n    *   Since the ¹³C spectrum has 7 signals and the DEPT-135 has 6 (5 positive + 1 negative), there must be one quaternary carbon (which is invisible in DEPT spectra). The signal at **145.1 ppm** is the likely quaternary carbon, deshielded due to its attachment to the aromatic ring and likely the nitrogen.\n    *   Of the remaining 6 carbons, three are aromatic CH groups (δ 128.5, 127.3, 126.3), which appear as positive signals in the DEPT-135 spectrum.\n    *   This leaves three aliphatic carbons (δ 49.6, 43.5, 19.2), which must account for the remaining two positive signals and one negative signal.\n    *   A negative signal corresponds to a **CH₂** group (likely δ 43.5 ppm).\n    *   The two positive signals must come from a **CH** group and a **CH₃** group. δ 19.2 ppm is a typical shift for a CH₃ group, and δ 49.6 ppm is consistent with a CH group attached to a nitrogen atom.\n\n**Summary of Carbon Fragments:**\n*   1 Quaternary Aromatic Carbon (C)\n*   3 Aromatic methine groups (CH)\n*   1 Aliphatic methine group (CH)\n*   1 Aliphatic methylene group (CH₂)\n*   1 Aliphatic methyl group (CH₃)\n\n### 4. ¹H NMR and HSQC Spectroscopy\n*   **δ ~7.2 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** Corresponds to the five protons of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-). The HSQC spectrum shows these protons correlate to the aromatic carbons.\n*   **δ ~1.2 ppm (triplet, 3H):** This signal integrates to 3 protons and its triplet splitting pattern (n+1=3, so n=2) indicates it is a methyl (-CH₃) group adjacent to a methylene (-CH₂) group. This strongly suggests the presence of an **ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)**.\n*   **δ ~2.8 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** This signal integrates to 2 protons and is consistent with the methylene (-CH₂) portion of the ethyl group.\n*   **δ ~2.7 ppm (broad singlet, ~1H):** This is characteristic of an amine (N-H) proton. Assuming the compound is a primary amine (NH₂), this signal would represent 2 protons. The integration might be inaccurate due to exchange phenomena.\n*   The **HSQC** data confirms the connectivity:\n    *   The protons at ~1.2 ppm correlate to the carbon at ~19.2 ppm (-CH₃).\n    *   The protons at ~2.8 ppm correlate to the carbon at ~43.5 ppm (-CH₂).\n    *   A third aliphatic signal is visible for the CH group.\n\n### 5. Structure Elucidation\nThe combined data points to a C₉H₁₃N molecule containing:\n1.  A phenyl group (C₆H₅-)\n2.  A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n3.  An ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃)\n4.  A methine group (-CH-)\n\nThe only way to assemble these fragments to satisfy the molecular formula and the spectroscopic data is the structure of **1-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n*   The phenyl group and the amino group are attached to the same carbon (C1), which is the methine (CH) group.\n*   The ethyl group is attached to C1.\n*   This structure's fragments (CH, CH₂, CH₃) are consistent with the DEPT analysis. The triplet for the CH₃ group is also explained.\n\nThe final proposed structure is:\n```\n      NH₂\n      |\nPh - CH - CH₂ - CH₃\n```\n\nThe IUPAC name for this compound is **1-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
