    "The runestone depicted in the image, characterized by its unique grid-like arrangement of runes, is identified as **Sö 287**.\n\nThis stone is one of the approximately 26 Ingvar runestones, which commemorate those who died during a Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled. A list of certain Ingvar runestones includes Sö 287, which was located at Hunhammar but has since disappeared. The inscription on this stone was recorded before it was lost.\n\nThe distinct style of carving the runes within horizontal bands makes it visually identifiable among the various Ingvar runestones.\n\n<<<Sö 287>>>"
