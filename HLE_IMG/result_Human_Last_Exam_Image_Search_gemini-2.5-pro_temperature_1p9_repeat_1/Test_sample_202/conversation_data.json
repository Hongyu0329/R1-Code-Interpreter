    "H. Scoria\nI. Volcanic Breccia\nJ. Pumice\nK. Pegmatite\n\n**Analysis of the Specimens**\n\n*   **Specimen H** is a reddish-brown volcanic rock with many visible, bubble-like cavities known as vesicles. This vesicular texture and dark reddish color are characteristic of scoria. Scoria, also known as cinder, forms when gas-rich lava erupts and cools quickly. It is typically dark in color (brown, black, or reddish-purple) and can be basaltic or andesitic in composition.\n\n*   **Specimen I** is composed of angular fragments of various rocks cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This composition and texture are indicative of a volcanic breccia. Breccias are rocks made of large, angular broken pieces of minerals or rocks held together by a cementing agent. Volcanic breccias, specifically, are formed from explosive volcanic eruptions that fragment and mix different types of volcanic rocks.\n\n*   **Specimen J** is a light-colored, vesicular volcanic rock. Its appearance, characterized by numerous small vesicles, suggests it is pumice. Pumice is a volcanic rock that consists of highly vesicular, rough-textured volcanic glass, which may or may not contain crystals. It is typically light-colored. The key difference between pumice and scoria is that pumice is lighter in color and has a higher concentration of smaller, thinner-walled vesicles, often allowing it to float on water, whereas scoria is denser, with larger vesicles and thicker walls, causing it to sink.\n\n*   **Specimen K** is an igneous rock with very large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible. This coarse-grained texture is the defining characteristic of a pegmatite. Pegmatites are known for having exceptionally large crystals, typically larger than one centimeter in diameter. They most commonly have a composition similar to granite, consisting mainly of quartz, feldspar, and mica.<<<H. Scoria\nI. Volcanic Breccia\nJ. Pumice\nK. Pegmatite>>>"
