    "The main difference in the sporophyte that allows for at-a-glance distinction between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* is the shape of the seta, the stalk that supports the capsule.\n\nIn ***Grimmia montana***, the seta is **straight**, holding the capsule erect. In contrast, ***Grimmia curviseta*** is characterized by an **arcuate** (curved or bent) seta. This striking difference in the orientation of the seta is a key diagnostic feature for separating the two species when sporophytes are present.\n\n<<<The key difference is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has an arcuate (curved) seta.>>>"
