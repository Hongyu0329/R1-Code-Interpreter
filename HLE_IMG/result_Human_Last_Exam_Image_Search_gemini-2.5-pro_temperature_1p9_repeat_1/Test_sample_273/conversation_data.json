    "The absolute configuration of the molecule in the picture has been determined for each of the three chiral centers, reading from left to right. The assignment of R (Rectus) or S (Sinister) to each stereocenter is based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\nThe configuration of the stereocenters is as follows:\n*   **The leftmost chiral center** (a tertiary alcohol group): Based on the prioritization of its substituents (hydroxyl, the rest of the carbon chain, methyl, and an implicit hydrogen), this center has an **S** configuration.\n*   **The middle chiral center** (bearing an ethyl group): The substituents are prioritized as the left part of the molecule, the right part of the molecule, the ethyl group, and an implicit hydrogen. This center has an **R** configuration.\n*   **The rightmost chiral center** (with a methyl and an aminomethyl group): Following the CIP rules, the priority of the substituents is the rest of the carbon chain, the aminomethyl group, the methyl group, and an implicit hydrogen. This center is determined to have an **S** configuration.\n\nTherefore, the absolute configuration of the molecule, from left to right, is (S, R, S). If following IUPAC naming conventions, this corresponds to **(2S, 3R, 4S)** for the molecule named 5-amino-3-ethyl-2,4-dimethylpentan-2-ol.\n\n<<<(2S, 3R, 4S)>>>"
