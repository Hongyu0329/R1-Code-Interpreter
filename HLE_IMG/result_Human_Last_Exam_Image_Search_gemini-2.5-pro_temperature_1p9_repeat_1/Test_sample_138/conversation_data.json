    "Here are the biological sexes of the individuals in each pair:\n\n*   **Pair A: M, F**\n    The insects in pair A are cuckoo bees of the genus *Coelioxys*. The individual on the left is a male, identified by the pronged or multi-spined tip of its abdomen. The individual on the right is a female, distinguished by her sharply pointed, tapering abdomen, which she uses to lay eggs in the nests of her host bees.\n\n*   **Pair B: F, M**\n    The insects in pair B are paper wasps of the genus *Polistes*. The individual on the right is a male, which can be identified by his antennae that are distinctly curled or hooked at the tips. The female, on the left, has shorter, less curved antennae.\n\n*   **Pair C: M, F**\n    The insects in pair C are long-horned bees, likely from the genus *Melissodes*. The individual on the left is a male, characterized by his very long antennae. He also displays a pale yellow or white facial plate (clypeus), another common trait for males in this genus. The female, on the right, has much shorter antennae.\n\n3, 4, 3\n<<<3, 4, 3>>>"
