    "Based on the transformations shown in the reaction scheme and supporting chemical literature, the reagents A and B can be identified as follows:\n\n**Reagent A: Hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂)**\nThe conversion of compound **1** to compound **2** involves the replacement of an oxygen-containing heterocyclic ring system with a nitrogen-containing one that features an N-amino group (-NH₂). The most direct and common chemical reagent to introduce an N-NH₂ group in this manner is hydrazine. This reaction type is known for various heterocyclic systems.\n\n**Reagent B: Propionaldehyde (Propanal, CH₃CH₂CHO)**\nThe reaction from compound **2** to **3** is a complex cyclization and annulation reaction that transforms the tetracyclic N-amino compound **2** into the pentacyclic N-propyl quinacridinium salt **3**. This type of transformation, creating N-alkylated quinacridiniums from N-amino precursors, is achieved by reacting the N-amino compound with an aldehyde. The aldehyde's alkyl group determines the alkyl substituent on the final quinacridinium nitrogen. To obtain the N-propyl (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) substituent present in compound **3**, the required aldehyde is propionaldehyde. The reaction proceeds through a hydrazone intermediate, followed by intramolecular cyclization and rearrangement.\n\n<<<A is Hydrazine and B is Propionaldehyde>>>"
