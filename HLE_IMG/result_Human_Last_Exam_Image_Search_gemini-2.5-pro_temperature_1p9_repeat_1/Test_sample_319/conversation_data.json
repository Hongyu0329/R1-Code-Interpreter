    "The phenomenon illustrated in the image is known as the **auditory continuity illusion** or **perceptual restoration of sound**.\n\nThis auditory illusion occurs when a sound, such as the continuous tone shown in the image's spectrogram, is interrupted by a short burst of a different sound, like loud noise. Although the original tone is physically absent during the interruption, the brain's perceptual system often \"fills in\" the gap, leading to the experience of a continuous, uninterrupted tone. The spectrogram in the image clearly depicts this scenario: a constant horizontal tone is broken by a vertical band of noise.\n\nFor the illusion to be effective, the interrupting noise must be loud enough to convincingly mask the missing segment of the tone. If the tone were simply replaced by silence, the listener would correctly perceive a gap. This \"filling-in\" is an unconscious perceptual ability that helps humans maintain a coherent understanding of sounds in noisy environments.\n\nA well-known example of this phenomenon involving speech is called the **phonemic restoration effect**. Discovered by Richard M. Warren, this effect shows that if a phoneme (a basic unit of speech) within a sentence is replaced by a sound like a cough or a burst of static, listeners often perceive the sentence as complete and intact. They may not even notice that a sound was missing and will have difficulty locating where the cough occurred.\n\nThe comparison to the Necker Cube is apt because both are examples of how the brain resolves ambiguity. The Necker Cube presents an ambiguous 2D visual stimulus that the brain interprets in one of two possible 3D configurations. Similarly, in the auditory continuity illusion, the brain is presented with an ambiguous acoustic signal and defaults to the most plausible interpretation: that a continuous sound was temporarily masked by noise, rather than a sound stopping and then starting again. This process highlights the constructive nature of perception, where the brain actively builds our experience of the world based on sensory input and context.\n\n<<<auditory continuity illusion"
