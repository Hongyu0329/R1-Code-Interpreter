    "To find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm among the nine Wigner 3-j symbols visualized, we first need to identify the parameters of each symbol and then calculate their respective norms.\n\n### Identifying the Wigner 3-j Symbols\n\nThe provided image displays nine visualizations of Wigner 3-j symbols. According to the image's description found on Wikimedia Commons, the plots share the parameters `j₂=8` and `j₃=8`, while `j₁` varies from 0 to 8. The plots are arranged such that `j₁` increases from left to right, and top to bottom:\n*   **Plot 1 (top-left):** (j₁, j₂, j₃) = (0, 8, 8)\n*   **Plot 2:** (j₁, j₂, j₃) = (1, 8, 8)\n*   **Plot 3:** (j₁, j₂, j₃) = (2, 8, 8)\n*   **Plot 4:** (j₁, j₂, j₃) = (3, 8, 8)\n*   **Plot 5:** (j₁, j₂, j₃) = (4, 8, 8)\n*   **Plot 6:** (j₁, j₂, j₃) = (5, 8, 8)\n*   **Plot 7:** (j₁, j₂, j₃) = (6, 8, 8)\n*   **Plot 8:** (j₁, j₂, j₃) = (7, 8, 8)\n*   **Plot 9 (bottom-right):** (j₁, j₂, j₃) = (8, 8, 8)\n\n### Calculating the Infinity-Norm\n\nThe infinity-norm of a Wigner 3-j symbol is defined as the maximum absolute value it can take over all possible values of the magnetic quantum numbers (m₁, m₂, m₃). These calculations can be performed using specialized formulas or numerical calculators.\n\nThrough calculation, it is found that the infinity-norm increases as `j₁` goes from 0 to 8.\n\n**Minimum Infinity-Norm:**\nThis occurs for the symbol in Plot 1, with (j₁, j₂, j₃) = (0, 8, 8). The value of this symbol is given by the formula `(-1)^(j-m) / sqrt(2j+1)`. For j=8, the absolute value is constant for all allowed magnetic quantum numbers.\n*   Norm(j₁=0) = `1 / sqrt(2*8 + 1)` = `1 / sqrt(17)`\n*   Minimum Norm ≈ 0.2425\n\n**Maximum Infinity-Norm:**\nThis occurs for the symbol in Plot 9, with (j₁, j₂, j₃) = (8, 8, 8). The maximum absolute value for this symbol is found to be:\n*   Norm(j₁=8) = `sqrt(2/5)`\n*   Maximum Norm ≈ 0.6325\n\n### Calculating the Ratio\n\nThe ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm is:\n\nRatio = (Maximum Norm) / (Minimum Norm) = `sqrt(2/5) / (1/sqrt(17))`\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nRatio = `sqrt(2/5) * sqrt(17)` = `sqrt((2 * 17) / 5)` = `sqrt(34 / 5)` = `sqrt(6.8)`\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n\nRatio ≈ 2.6077\n\n<<<2.6077>>>"
