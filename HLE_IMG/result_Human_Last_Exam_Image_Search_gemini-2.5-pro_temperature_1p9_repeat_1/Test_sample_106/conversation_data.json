    "The reaction shown is an acid-catalyzed dehydration of a triterpenoid alcohol, which triggers a complex series of shifts known as a backbone rearrangement. This type of rearrangement is common in terpene chemistry and leads to a thermodynamically more stable product.\n\nTo determine the substituents at positions 1 through 5 in the product, we must trace the step-by-step mechanism of the rearrangement. The starting material is friedelan-3β-ol.\n\n1.  **Protonation and Dehydration:** The hydroxyl (-OH) group at position C-3 is protonated by the acid catalyst (HCl). A water molecule then leaves, forming a secondary carbocation at C-3.\n\n2.  **First shift (Methyl):** A methyl group (CH3) from the adjacent C-4 migrates to C-3. This is a-methide shift, which transforms the secondary carbocation into a more stable tertiary carbocation at C-4.\n\n3.  **Second shift (Hydride):** A hydride ion (H⁻) from C-5 migrates to the positively charged C-4. This shift moves the carbocation to C-5.\n\n4.  **Third shift (Methyl):** A methyl group from C-10 shifts to C-5, relocating the positive charge to C-10. This is another-methide shift.\n\n5.  **Subsequent Shifts:** This cascade of shifts continues along the molecular backbone:\n    *   A hydride from C-9 shifts to C-10 (cation moves to C-9).\n    *   A methyl group from C-8 shifts to C-9 (cation moves to C-8).\n    *   A hydride from C-14 shifts to C-8 (cation moves to C-14).\n    *   A methyl group from C-13 shifts to C-14 (cation moves to C-13).\n\n6.  **Deprotonation and Alkene Formation:** The reaction terminates when a proton is eliminated, forming a stable tetrasubstituted double bond. In the final product, this double bond is typically formed between C-13 and C-18. The hydrogen on C-18 is removed.\n\nBy carefully tracking the original positions of the hydrogen atoms and methyl groups through this sequence of shifts, we can identify what occupies each numbered position in the final rearranged product.\n\n*   **Position 1:** This carbon was originally C-4. One of its methyl groups migrated away in step 2. The other remains. Therefore, position 1 is a **CH3**.\n*   **Position 2:** This was originally the methyl group at C-10. It migrated to C-5 in step 4. Thus, position 2 is a **CH3**.\n*   **Position 3:** This carbon was originally C-9. Its hydrogen atom migrated to C-10. It now bears the methyl group that was originally at C-8. So, position 3 is a **CH3**.\n*   **Position 4:** This carbon was originally C-14. Its hydrogen migrated to C-8. It now has the methyl group that was at C-13. So, position 4 is a **CH3**.\n*   **Position 5:** This carbon was originally C-18. It retains its original hydrogen atom, which is ultimately eliminated as H+ to form the double bond with C-13. Therefore, before the final elimination step (which is what the grey circle indicates), position 5 is occupied by a hydrogen atom (**H**).\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
