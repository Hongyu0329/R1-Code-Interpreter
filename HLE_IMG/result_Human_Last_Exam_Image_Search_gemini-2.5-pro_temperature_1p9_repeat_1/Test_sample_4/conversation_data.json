    "The knot depicted in the image is known in knot theory as the **9_42 knot**, following the Alexander-Briggs notation. This is a non-alternating knot with 9 crossings.\n\nThe Jones polynomial, denoted as V(t), for the 9_42 knot is:\n\n$t^8 - t^7 + t^6 - t^5 + t^4 - t^3 + t^2$\n\nThis polynomial is a knot invariant, meaning it is the same for all geometric representations of the 9_42 knot. Interestingly, the 9_42 knot and its mirror image have the same Jones polynomial, as well as the same Kauffman and HOMFLY polynomials, which are more general knot polynomials. While these common polynomials do not distinguish between the 9_42 knot and its reflection, other more advanced invariants from Chern-Simons theory are able to detect its chirality.\n\n<<<t^8 - t^7 + t^6 - t^5 + t^4 - t^3 + t^2>>>"
