    "The bryophyte in the image belongs to the genus ***Ptilidium***.\n\nThis identification is based on the plant's highly characteristic appearance. The shoots have a \"feathery\" or \"hirsute\" look, which is a key feature of this genus. This appearance is created by leaves that are deeply divided and have edges fringed with numerous fine, hair-like projections called cilia. The name *Ptilidium* itself comes from the Greek word for \"small feather,\" referencing this distinct morphology.\n\nThe plants grow in dense, overlapping tufts or mats, which can be yellowish-green to reddish-brown. This matches the coloration seen in the photograph, with bright green new growth and browner, older sections. *Ptilidium* is a genus of leafy liverworts in the family Ptilidiaceae.\n\nThere are three species in this genus: *Ptilidium ciliare* (Ciliated Fringewort), *Ptilidium pulcherrimum* (Tree Fringewort), and the North Pacific native *Ptilidium californicum*. While distinguishing between the species requires examining details like the density of the cilia and the habitat, the genus is easily recognizable by its unique \"frizzy\" or \"braided\" appearance.\n\n<<<Ptilidium>>>"
