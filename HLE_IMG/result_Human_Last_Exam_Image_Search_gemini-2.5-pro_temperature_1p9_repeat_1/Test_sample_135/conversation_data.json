    "Based on my research, this detail of an altarpiece depicting the \"Sacrament of the Altar\" (\"SACRAMENT DE L'AVTEL\") is attributed to the Florentine painter and sculptor **Giuseppe Cassioli**.\n\nThis relief was part of a large marble high altar created by Cassioli and installed in 1916 at the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament in Christchurch, New Zealand. While Cassioli had a significant reputation at the time, his work in New Zealand is now relatively unknown. The altar was later replaced in 1974.\n\n<<<Giuseppe Cassioli>>>"
