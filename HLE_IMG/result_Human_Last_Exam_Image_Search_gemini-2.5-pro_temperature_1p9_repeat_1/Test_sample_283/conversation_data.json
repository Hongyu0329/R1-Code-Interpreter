    "The Google Trends graph displays search interest peaks corresponding to three major historical events in one country. An analysis of the timing of these annual peaks points directly to Turkey.\n\nThe recurring patterns in the graph align with key Turkish national holidays:\n*   **The red line's** annual peaks in late April correspond to **National Sovereignty and Children's Day** on April 23rd. This holiday commemorates the foundation of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey in 1920.\n*   **The blue line's** yearly spikes at the end of August match **Victory Day** on August 30th. This day celebrates the decisive victory in the Battle of DumlupÄ±nar, the final battle of the Turkish War of Independence in 1922.\n*   **The yellow line's** recurring peaks in late October align with **Republic Day** on October 29th. This is the anniversary of the proclamation of the Turkish Republic in 1923.\n\nA particularly telling detail is the massive spike in the yellow trend line in late 2022. This represents heightened interest leading up to the 100th anniversary of the Republic of Turkey, which was celebrated on October 29, 2023. The anticipation and preparation for this centennial milestone would logically cause a significant surge in searches, as reflected in the graph.\n\n<<<Turkey>>>"
