    "The transformation shown involves two distinct photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occurring in sequence. A detailed analysis of the reactants, conditions, and product structure, supported by chemical literature, reveals the specific nature of these steps.\n\nThe two pericyclic reactions are:\n\n1.  **A [2+2] Photocycloaddition:** The first step is an intermolecular reaction between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene. Under photochemical conditions (indicated by *hv*), a cycloaddition between a π-system of hexafluorobenzene and the π-bond of cyclobutene occurs. While benzene derivatives can undergo several types of cycloadditions, the reaction with simple alkenes under these conditions is typically a [2+2] cycloaddition. This reaction forms a new four-membered ring, joining the two reactant molecules into a single, strained polycyclic intermediate.\n\n2.  **An Electrocyclic Ring-Closing:** The initial adduct formed is highly strained and can undergo further rearrangement. The second photochemically allowed pericyclic reaction is an intramolecular 4π-electron electrocyclic ring-closing. An electrocyclic reaction is a concerted process that involves the cyclization of a conjugated π-electron system. In this case, a conjugated diene moiety within the intermediate rearranges its π-electrons to form a σ-bond, creating an additional ring and leading to the final, more stable tetracyclic product shown.\n\nThis sequence, a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition followed by a 4π-electrocyclic ring closure, is a known pathway for the reaction of hexafluorobenzene with certain alkenes.\n\n<<<A [2+2] cycloaddition and an electrocyclic reaction.>>>"
