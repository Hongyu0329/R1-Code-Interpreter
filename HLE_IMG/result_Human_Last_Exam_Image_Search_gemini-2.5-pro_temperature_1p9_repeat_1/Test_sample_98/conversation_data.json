    "This medallion is a gold octadrachm from the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt. The image provided shows the reverse side, which depicts the jugate (overlapping) busts of Ptolemy I Soter and his wife Berenice I. The obverse (front) of the coin features the busts of Ptolemy II Philadelphus and his sister-wife, Arsinoe II.\n\nThis specific coin was minted during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus. Archaeologists and numismatists date these coins to have been minted in Alexandria between approximately 270 BCE and 246 BCE. This period falls within the **3rd century BCE**.\n\nPtolemy II issued these large gold coins to honor his deified parents (Ptolemy I and Berenice I), who are labeled on the coin with the Greek inscription \"ΘΕΩΝ\" (THEON), meaning \"of the Gods\". The side with Ptolemy II and Arsinoe II is inscribed with \"ΑΔΕΛΦΩΝ\" (ADELPHON), meaning \"of the Siblings\". This coinage was part of a broader effort by Ptolemy II to establish a state-run ruler cult and reinforce dynastic harmony.\n\n<<<3rd century B.C.>>>"
