    "This coin is a 9 Deniers piece, minted for circulation in the French colonies during the reign of King Louis XV. An edict in June 1721 authorized the production of these copper coins to provide small change throughout France's expansive territories in the New World, which included areas from present-day Canada down to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe coins were struck in 1721 and 1722 at the mints in Rouen (mintmark \"B\") and La Rochelle (mintmark \"H\"). While intended for broad use in \"our Colonies in America and other places of our dominion outside of Europe,\" they faced a mixed reception.\n\nIn 1722, the French East India Company sent a large shipment of 534,000 of these coins to Canada. However, the colonists there were reluctant to use them, preferring silver, and most were returned to France in 1726. Subsequently, these returned coins were sent to Louisiana. A number of these pieces also made their way to Île Bourbon (modern-day Réunion) in the Indian Ocean, where they were well-received. Therefore, this coin was intended for and circulated in multiple French colonies, primarily in North America (New France, including Canada and Louisiana) and the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe obverse of the coin, though not clear in the image, typically features the crowned, interlaced \"L\"s of the king with the Latin legend \"SIT NOMEN DOMINI BENEDICTUM\" (Blessed be the name of the Lord). The reverse clearly shows \"COLONIES FRANÇOISES\" and the date, as seen in the image provided.\n\n<<<French Colonies in America (New France, including Canada and Louisiana) and Île Bourbon>>>"
