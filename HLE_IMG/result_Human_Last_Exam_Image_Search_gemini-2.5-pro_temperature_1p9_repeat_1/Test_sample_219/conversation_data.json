    "The timestamps of the synchronized bursts are identified by looking for vertical columns of dense firing activity across numerous electrodes. These occur at approximately:\n*   Burst 1: 2 s\n*   Burst 2: 15 s\n*   Burst 3: 25 s\n*   Burst 4: 36 s\n*   Burst 5: 48 s\n\nTo calculate the average inter-burst interval, we first find the duration of each interval between consecutive bursts:\n*   Interval 1: 15 s - 2 s = 13 s\n*   Interval 2: 25 s - 15 s = 10 s\n*   Interval 3: 36 s - 25 s = 11 s\n*   Interval 4: 48 s - 36 s = 12 s\n\nNext, we calculate the average of these intervals:\nAverage = (13 s + 10 s + 11 s + 12 s) / 4 = 46 s / 4 = 11.5 s\n\nFinally, we round the result to two significant figures. 11.5 s is rounded to 12 s.\n\n<<<12 s>>>"
