    "The histopathological diagnosis for the provided image is **Crescentic Glomerulonephritis**.\n\nThis diagnosis is based on the following key features visible in the image:\n\n*   **Glomerular Crescent Formation:** The most prominent finding is the presence of a large, crescent-shaped mass of cells filling Bowman's space, which is the area surrounding the central glomerular tuft. This \"crescent\" is the hallmark of this condition and is formed by the proliferation of parietal epithelial cells and the infiltration of inflammatory cells, such as macrophages. The crescent compresses the glomerular capillary tuft.\n\n*   **Glomerular Hypercellularity:** The glomerular tuft itself shows an increased number of cells, a condition known as hypercellularity.\n\nClinically, crescentic glomerulonephritis is associated with **Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN)**, a syndrome characterized by a rapid and severe decline in kidney function over a short period of days to weeks. The presence of extensive crescent formation is a marker of severe glomerular injury. This condition is a medical emergency, as without treatment, it often leads to end-stage renal disease.\n\nCrescentic glomerulonephritis is not a single disease but rather a histological pattern of severe injury. It can be classified into three main types based on immunofluorescence findings: anti-GBM antibody disease, immune complex-mediated disease, and pauci-immune glomerulonephritis (often associated with ANCA vasculitis). The H&E stain alone, as shown in the image, does not allow for differentiation between these subtypes.\n\n<<<Crescentic Glomerulonephritis>>>"
