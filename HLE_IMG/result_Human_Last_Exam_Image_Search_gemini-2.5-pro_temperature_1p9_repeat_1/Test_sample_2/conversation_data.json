    "The provided sorting algorithm is a recursive function. To determine its time complexity, we can formulate a recurrence relation that describes its behavior.\n\nLet T(n) be the time complexity for sorting an array of size `n`.\n\n1.  **Base Case**: If `n <= 1`, the function does nothing and returns. This takes constant time, T(1) = O(1).\n2.  **Recursive Step**: If `n > 1`, the function performs the following steps:\n    *   `sort(a, n - 1)`: It makes a recursive call on a subarray of size `n-1`. This takes T(n-1) time.\n    *   `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]: swap(...)`: This comparison and potential swap take a constant amount of time, O(1).\n    *   `sort(a, n - 1)`: It makes a second recursive call on a subarray of size `n-1`. This also takes T(n-1) time.\n\nCombining these steps, the recurrence relation for the worst case is:\nT(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + O(1)\nT(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c (where c is a constant)\n\nWe can solve this recurrence relation by expansion:\n*   T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c\n*   T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c\n*   T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c\n*   ...\n*   After k steps: T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^0)\n\nTo reach the base case T(1), we set `k = n-1`:\n*   T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-2) + ... + 1)\nThe sum `1 + 2 + ... + 2^(n-2)` is a geometric series that equals `2^(n-1) - 1`.\n*   T(n) = 2^(n-1) * O(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)\n*   T(n) = O(2^(n-1)) + O(c * 2^(n-1))\n*   T(n) = O(2^n)\n\nThis shows that the time complexity grows exponentially with the input size `n`. Such a recurrence relation, where a problem of size `n` generates two subproblems of size `n-1`, is characteristic of exponential time complexity.\n\nTherefore, the time complexity in the worst case is O(2^n).\n\n<<<E>>>"
