    "The knot in the image is the 8₁₉ knot. The Rasmussen s-invariant for this knot is -6.\n\nThe Rasmussen s-invariant is a tool in knot theory, which is the mathematical study of knots. It assigns an integer value to each knot, helping mathematicians to distinguish them from one another. This particular invariant is useful because it provides information about how a knot can be \"unknotted\" and its relationship to surfaces in four dimensions. For alternating knots, the Rasmussen s-invariant is equal to the knot's signature.\n\nThe 8₁₉ knot is also known as the T(4,3) torus knot and the pretzel knot P(3,3,-2). It holds the distinction of being the first non-homologically thin knot in the standard knot table, meaning its Khovanov homology, a more complex knot invariant, has elements in positions that are \"off-diagonal\".\n\n<<< -6 >>>"
