    "The tiling pattern shown in the image exhibits **7-fold rotational symmetry**. This is a type of non-crystallographic symmetry, meaning it cannot form a repeating periodic pattern in the plane. Instead, the pattern is an example of a quasicrystalline or aperiodic tiling.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the visual elements that indicate this symmetry:\n\n*   **Central Heptagonal Motifs:** The tiling is constructed around central dark blue heptagons (seven-sided polygons). The arrangement of tiles surrounding these heptagons maintains a 7-fold rotational symmetry. If you were to rotate the image by 360/7 degrees around the center of any of these heptagons, the pattern would appear unchanged.\n*   **Seven-Pointed Stars:** The arrangement of the lighter orange and yellow rhombic and square tiles around the central heptagons forms distinct seven-pointed star patterns.\n*   **Aperiodic Nature:** The presence of 7-fold symmetry is a hallmark of quasicrystals. According to the crystallographic restriction theorem, periodic crystals can only possess 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, or 6-fold rotational symmetries. The 7-fold symmetry observed here means the tiling lacks the translational symmetry of a regular, repeating pattern.\n*   **Composition:** These types of tilings are often created using a specific set of prototiles, in this case, shapes like heptagons, squares, and rhombi. Research into these \"heptagonal tilings\" shows they are constructed to maintain long-range order without being periodic.\n\nThis particular type of tiling is sometimes referred to as \"Madison's 7-fold\" or is generally classified as a rhombic quasiperiodic tiling with seven-fold symmetry.\n\n<<<7-fold>>>"
