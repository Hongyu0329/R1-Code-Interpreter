    "The characters on the seal, read from top to bottom and right to left, are 長樂未央 (cháng lè wèi yāng). In simplified Chinese, this is written as 长乐未央.\n\nThis is a traditional auspicious phrase that means \"everlasting joy without end\". It originated from a瓦当 (wǎdāng - an eave-tile end) from the Chang'le Palace of the Han Dynasty. This phrase is a common motif in Chinese art and can be found on various objects, including seals and inscriptions, expressing a wish for enduring happiness and prosperity.\n\n<<<长乐未央>>>"
