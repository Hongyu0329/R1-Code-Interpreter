  print("The image displays a time-lapse sequence (panels L, M, and N) showing the branching of a fungal hypha.")
  print("\nStep-by-step analysis:")
  print("1. Panel L: A straight fungal filament (hypha), composed of several cells separated by cross-walls (septa), is shown. The arrowhead points to a septum in a subapical (not at the tip) cell.")
  print("2. Panel M: A small, localized swelling or bulge emerges from the side wall of the cell that was indicated in the previous panel. The arrowhead now points to this incipient branch.")
  print("3. Panel N: The bulge has grown and elongated, forming a new side branch. The main hypha appears to have bent at this junction.")
  print("\nConclusion:")
  print("The overall process being depicted is known as hyphal branching. This is a fundamental way that fungi grow and spread, forming an interconnected network called a mycelium.")
