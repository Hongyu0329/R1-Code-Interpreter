    "The image provided shows a time-lapse sequence, labeled L, M, and N, capturing a biological process at the cellular level. I will first describe what is happening in each frame and then identify the overall process. Finally, I will provide a Python script that prints this explanation.\n\n**My Plan:**\n1.  Analyze the three panels (L, M, N) to understand the temporal changes in the filamentous structure.\n2.  Identify the key events: the initial state, the formation of a new structure, and the growth of that structure.\n3.  Conclude the name of the biological process based on these observations. This structure is a hypha, a filament of a fungus.\n4.  Create a Python script to print out the detailed explanation of the process.\n5.  Provide the final concise answer in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef explain_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  Explains the biological process shown in the provided image sequence.\n  \"\"\"\n  print(\"The image displays a time-lapse sequence (panels L, M, and N) showing the branching of a fungal hypha.\")\n  print(\"\\nStep-by-step analysis:\")\n  print(\"1. Panel L: A straight fungal filament (hypha), composed of several cells separated by cross-walls (septa), is shown. The arrowhead points to a septum in a subapical (not at the tip) cell.\")\n  print(\"2. Panel M: A small, localized swelling or bulge emerges from the side wall of the cell that was indicated in the previous panel. The arrowhead now points to this incipient branch.\")\n  print(\"3. Panel N: The bulge has grown and elongated, forming a new side branch. The main hypha appears to have bent at this junction.\")\n  print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n  print(\"The overall process being depicted is known as hyphal branching. This is a fundamental way that fungi grow and spread, forming an interconnected network called a mycelium.\")\n\nexplain_process()\n```\n<<<Hyphal branching>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
