    "This sheet music is from Richard Wagner's opera, *Tristan und Isolde*.\n\nThe provided score is the introduction to the second act. The direction \"(Vorhang),\" which means \"Curtain\" in German, indicates the curtain rises at this point in the music. The lush, chromatic, and complex score is characteristic of Wagner's late Romantic style. The opera, first performed in 1865, is a landmark work known for its advanced use of harmony and its profound influence on the course of classical music. The second act, in particular, contains an extended love duet between the title characters.\n\n<<<Tristan und Isolde>>>"
