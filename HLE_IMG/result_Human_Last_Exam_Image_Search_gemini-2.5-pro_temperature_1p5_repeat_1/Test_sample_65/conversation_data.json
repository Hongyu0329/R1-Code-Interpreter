    "The bryophyte in the image displays leaves that are distinctly twisted and coiled around the stem, giving it a screw-like appearance. This is a characteristic feature of a group of mosses commonly known as \"screw mosses\".\n\nBased on scientific classification, this appearance is strongly associated with the family Pottiaceae. Within this family, the genus *Tortula* is widely referred to as screw moss. Several species within this genus, such as *Tortula muralis* (wall screw-moss), exhibit leaves that twist and curl when dry. Another closely related genus is *Syntrichia*, which also contains species referred to as screw mosses, like *Syntrichia ruralis* (twisted moss) and *Syntrichia caninervis* (steppe screw moss). Taxonomically, many species that were once classified under *Tortula* have been moved to the genus *Syntrichia*.\n\nThe plant's leaves are arranged in a spiral, a common trait in mosses. The defining feature remains the pronounced twisting of the leaves around the stem, a hygroscopic movement that is especially noticeable when the moss is dry.\n\nGiven the distinct screw-like coiling of the leaves, the plant belongs to the genus *Tortula*, or the closely related genus *Syntrichia*, both commonly known as screw mosses. However, *Tortula* is the classic and most frequently cited genus for this characteristic.\n\n<<<Tortula>>>"
