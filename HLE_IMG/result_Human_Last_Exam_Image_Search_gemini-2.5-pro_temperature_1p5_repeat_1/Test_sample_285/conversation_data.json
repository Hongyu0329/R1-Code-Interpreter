    "B,C,D.\n\nA Delaunay triangulation is a specific way of dividing a set of points into triangles with a special property called the \"empty circle property\". This property states that for any triangle in the triangulation, the unique circle that passes through its three vertices (its circumcircle) must not contain any other points from the set in its interior. If even one triangle's circumcircle contains another point, the entire triangulation violates the property and is not a Delaunay triangulation.\n\nHere is an analysis of each image:\n*   **A:** This triangulation appears to be a valid Delaunay triangulation. The triangles are relatively uniform in shape, and it is not visually obvious that any circumcircle would contain another point from the set.\n*   **B:** This triangulation violates the empty circle property. Consider the quadrilateral formed by the top vertex and the three inner vertices. This shape is triangulated by an edge connecting the top vertex to the bottom inner vertex. This is an \"illegal edge\" because the sum of the opposite angles of the quadrilateral at the left and right inner vertices is greater than 180 degrees, which implies that the circumcircle of each triangle contains the opposite vertex.\n*   **C:** Similar to triangulation B, this image also contains an illegal edge. The quadrilateral formed by the top vertex and the three inner vertices is divided by an edge from the top vertex to the bottom inner vertex. The angles at the other two inner vertices are both obtuse (greater than 90 degrees), meaning their sum is greater than 180 degrees. This violates the Delaunay condition.\n*   **D:** This triangulation has a very clear violation. If you consider the large triangle formed by the topmost vertex and the two bottom corner vertices, its circumcircle would encompass all of the inner points. Since these inner points are contained within the circumcircle, this triangulation is not a Delaunay triangulation.\n\nTherefore, triangulations B, C, and D all violate the empty circle property.\n\n<<<B,C,D>>>"
