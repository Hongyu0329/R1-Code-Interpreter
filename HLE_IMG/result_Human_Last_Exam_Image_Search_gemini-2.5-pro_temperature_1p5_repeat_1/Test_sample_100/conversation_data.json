    "To determine the molecular formula of the product, we must analyze the reaction sequence step by step, calculating the change in molecular formula at each stage.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and Reaction 1**\n\nThe starting material is a bicyclic lactam, a derivative of 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one (commonly known as Vince lactam), with a *p*-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group on the nitrogen and a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group on the double bond. Let's calculate its molecular formula:\n*   The core structure, 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one, has the formula C7H6F3NO.\n*   The PMB group (-CH2C6H4OCH3) has the formula C8H9O.\n*   Combining these gives the starting material's formula: **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\nThe first reaction uses Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in aqueous acetonitrile (ACN/H2O). CAN is a standard reagent used for the oxidative removal of the PMB protecting group from a nitrogen atom. This reaction cleaves the PMB group and replaces it with a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Change in formula:** - C8H9O + H = -C8H8O\n*   **Intermediate 1 Formula:** C15-8H14-8F3NO2-1 = **C7H6F3NO**\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Reaction 2**\n\nThe second step involves hydrogenation with palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2). This is a standard catalytic hydrogenation that reduces the carbon-carbon double bond to a single bond.\n*   **Change in formula:** + H2\n*   **Intermediate 2 Formula:** C7H6+2F3NO = **C7H8F3NO**\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Reaction 3**\n\nThe final step is the treatment of Intermediate 2 with 4 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 70 Â°C. Intermediate 2 is a saturated bicyclic lactam (a cyclic amide). These conditions lead to the hydrolysis of the lactam ring. The amide bond is cleaved by the addition of one molecule of water, forming a carboxylic acid and an amine.\n*   **Change in formula:** + H2O\n*   **Product Formula:** C7H8+2F3NO1+1 = **C7H10F3NO2**\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the final product is determined by tracking the changes through the three reaction steps.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
