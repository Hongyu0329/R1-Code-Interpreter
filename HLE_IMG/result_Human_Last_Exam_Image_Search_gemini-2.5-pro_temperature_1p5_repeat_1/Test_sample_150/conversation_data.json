    "This multi-step synthesis can be broken down into four key transformations to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe first reaction involves benzene and propanoyl chloride with an aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) catalyst. This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation, where the propanoyl group is added to the benzene ring. The product of this step, Intermediate-1, is propiophenone (also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n\nIntermediate-1 (propiophenone) is then treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group on the propiophenone is a deactivating group and directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position on the benzene ring. Therefore, a bromine atom is added to the meta-position, yielding Intermediate-2, which is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n\nIntermediate-2 undergoes reduction with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction, often referred to as catalytic hydrogenation, reduces the ketone functional group (C=O) completely to a methylene group (CH₂). This specific reduction of an aryl ketone is a useful synthetic method. The product, Intermediate-3, is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n\n**Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n\nIn the final step, Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene) is treated with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of a radical initiator, benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂), and a solvent, carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). This set of reagents is specific for free-radical bromination at the benzylic position—the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. A hydrogen atom on this carbon is replaced by a bromine atom. This occurs because the benzylic radical intermediate is stabilized by the adjacent aromatic ring. The reaction selectively forms a single constitutional isomer.\n\nTherefore, starting from 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene, the bromination occurs on the first carbon of the propyl group, leading to the final product.\n\nThe final product is named **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
