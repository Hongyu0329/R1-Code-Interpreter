    "The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that allows for distinction at a glance lies in the **seta**, the stalk that supports the capsule.\n\nIn ***Grimmia montana***, the seta is **straight and short**. The capsule is held erect on this straight stalk.\n\nIn contrast, ***Grimmia curviseta*** is characterized by a **curved or arcuate seta**. This curvature is a key diagnostic feature for the species, as even its name *curviseta* suggests.\n\nTherefore, by observing whether the capsule is held on a straight or a curved stalk, one can readily distinguish between the sporophytes of these two species.\n\n<<<The most prominent difference in the sporophyte used to distinguish *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the shape of the seta: *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a curved seta.>>>"
