    "The Ancient Greek word in the manuscript reads **μθᾶλων**. \n\nThis word is most likely a scribal variation of the common Doric Greek word **μᾶλων** (mâlōn), which is the genitive plural of μᾶλον (mâlon). The word has two primary meanings: \"of apples\" (or other tree fruits) or \"of sheep\".\n\nThe form in the manuscript is unusual for a few reasons:\n\n*   **The letter Theta (θ):** The most peculiar feature is the second letter, theta (θ). The word μᾶλον and its forms begin with mu-alpha. The presence of a theta is best explained as a scribal error, a relatively common occurrence in manually copied manuscripts.\n*   **The vowel Alpha (α):** The use of a long alpha (ᾱ), indicated by the circumflex accent, instead of an eta (η) which is found in Attic Greek (μήλων), is a hallmark of the Doric dialect of Ancient Greek.\n*   **The Accent:** The circumflex accent (˜) on the first syllable is correct for the Doric genitive plural form μᾶλων.\n*   **The Ending:** The final letters are a common Byzantine ligature for -ων (-ōn), which is the standard ending for the genitive plural in this declension.\n\nTherefore, despite the unusual \"θ,\" the word is an identifiable form of a common Greek word, with its dialectal features and ending correctly rendered according to Byzantine scribal practices. The context in which the word was found could further clarify whether it refers to apples or sheep.\n\n<<<μθᾶλων>>>"
