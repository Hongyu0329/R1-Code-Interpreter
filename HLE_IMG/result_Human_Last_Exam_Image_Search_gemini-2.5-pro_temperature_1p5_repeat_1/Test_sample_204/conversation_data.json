    "Based on the visual evidence and mineralogical information, the specimens are identified and ordered as follows, from the least to the most complex silicate structure:\n\n*   **Specimen C: Olivine**\n    *   **Identification**: The granular aggregate of olive-green crystals is characteristic of olivine.\n    *   **Silicate Structure**: Olivine is a *nesosilicate*, which has the simplest structure consisting of isolated silica tetrahedra linked by cations.\n\n*   **Specimen A: Pyroxene (likely Augite)**\n    *   **Identification**: This specimen is a dark, stubby prismatic crystal with nearly square cross-sections, which is a common habit for pyroxenes like augite.\n    *   **Silicate Structure**: Pyroxenes are *inosilicates* with a single-chain structure, where tetrahedra link to form a single, continuous chain. This structure is more complex than the isolated tetrahedra of olivine.\n\n*   **Specimen B: Mica**\n    *   **Identification**: The flaky, layered appearance and perfect basal cleavage, allowing it to be split into thin, flexible sheets, are definitive characteristics of the mica group.\n    *   **Silicate Structure**: Micas are *phyllosilicates* (sheet silicates), where tetrahedra are linked in two-dimensional sheets. Each tetrahedron shares three of its oxygen atoms with adjacent tetrahedra. This sheet structure is more polymerized and complex than single-chain silicates.\n\n*   **Specimen D: Quartz**\n    *   **Identification**: The specimen is a translucent, six-sided prismatic crystal, a classic form for quartz.\n    *   **Silicate Structure**: Quartz is a *tectosilicate* (framework silicate), representing the most complex silicate structure. In this structure, every silica tetrahedron shares all four of its oxygen atoms with neighboring tetrahedra, creating a strong three-dimensional framework.\n\nThe correct order of increasing silicate structure complexity is C, A, B, D.\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
