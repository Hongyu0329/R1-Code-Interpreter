    "This piece of music is \"La Campanella,\" the third of Franz Liszt's six Grandes Études de Paganini, S. 141. Composed in 1851, it is a revision of an earlier version from 1838.\n\n\"La Campanella,\" which means \"The Little Bell\" in Italian, gets its melody from the final movement of Niccolò Paganini's Violin Concerto No. 2 in B minor. It is renowned for being one of the most difficult pieces in the piano repertoire, characterized by its dazzling technique and high speed, requiring the pianist to execute large leaps between hands.\n\nThe version that is popularly performed today is the 1851 revision, which is in the key of G-sharp minor. Liszt was a great admirer of Paganini and, after hearing him perform, was inspired to become the piano equivalent of the violin virtuoso. He transcribed six of Paganini's compositions into virtuosic piano études, with \"La Campanella\" being the third in the set.\n\n<<<La Campanella by Franz Liszt>>>"
