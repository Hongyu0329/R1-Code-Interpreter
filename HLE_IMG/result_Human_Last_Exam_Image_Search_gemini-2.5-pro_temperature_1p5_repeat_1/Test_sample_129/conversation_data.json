    "This image displays the **SUMO E1 activating enzyme complex**.\n\nSpecifically, it is the crystal structure of the human SUMO-activating enzyme E1, which is a heterodimer composed of two subunits, **SAE1 and SAE2** (shown in dark blue). It is in complex with **SUMO-1** (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier 1), the smaller protein shown in light blue. This entire structure is cataloged in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the identifier **1Y8R**.\n\nThe SUMO activating enzyme (E1) is the first and crucial enzyme in the sumoylation pathway. This pathway is a post-translational modification process that attaches SUMO proteins to other proteins in a cell, which is essential for regulating various cellular functions like gene expression and protein stability. The E1 enzyme activates the SUMO protein, allowing it to be transferred to a conjugating enzyme (E2) and ultimately to a target protein.<<<SUMO E1 activating enzyme complex (SAE1/SAE2) with SUMO-1>>>"
