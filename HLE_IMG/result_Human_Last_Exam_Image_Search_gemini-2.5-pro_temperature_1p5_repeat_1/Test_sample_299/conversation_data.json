    "The two-move checkmate is achieved with the following sequence:\n\n**1. Nc5**\n\nThe first move is for the white knight to move from b7 to c5. This quiet move is critical as it sets up an unstoppable mating net. It protects the key d3 square and prepares a devastating follow-up, regardless of Black's response.\n\n**2. Qb3#**\n\nIf Black makes any move other than moving the king or blocking with their queen, White delivers checkmate by moving the queen to b3. The black king on e4 is trapped:\n*   **d3** is covered by the knight on c5.\n*   **d4** is covered by the queen on a4.\n*   **f3** is covered by the rook on f3.\n*   **f5** is covered by the rook on h5 and the knight on e7.\n*   **d5** is covered by the knight on e7.\n\nHere are the checkmates for Black's other possible moves:\n*   If Black plays **1... Kxf3**, White checkmates with **2. Ng6#**.\n*   If Black plays **1... Ke3**, White checkmates with **2. Qe8#**.\n*   If Black attempts to block the threat with **1... Qc4**, White delivers mate with **2. Qxc4#**.\n\n<<<1. Nc5, 2. Qb3#>>>"
