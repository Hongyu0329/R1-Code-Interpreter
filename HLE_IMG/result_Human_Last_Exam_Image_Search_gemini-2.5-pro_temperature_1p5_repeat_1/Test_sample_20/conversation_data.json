    "This image was taken in the Netherlands.\n\nThe photograph features the historic city hall (*Stadhuis*) of Schoonhoven, a city located in the province of South Holland. The distinctive building with its Gothic architecture and stepped gables dates originally from 1452.\n\nSchoonhoven is situated on the Lek River and is renowned for its history of silver craftsmanship, earning it the nickname \"Zilverstad\" (Silver City). The city's charming and well-preserved historic center, with its canals, historic buildings, and the old city hall, makes it a picturesque location.\n\nThe view in the picture is from across a canal, a common feature in the historic fortified town. The white structure visible on the right is a bridge over the canal. Bicycles, a quintessential part of Dutch life, can be seen parked nearby.\n\n<<<Netherlands>>>"
