    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two products of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: 4π Electrocyclic Ring Opening**\n\n1.  **Reactant Analysis:** The starting material is a substituted cyclobutene. Based on the provided image, the structure is 3-methoxy-4-methyl-4-methoxycyclobutene. It has a chiral center at C4, with the methyl (Me) group oriented up (wedge) and the methoxy (OMe) group oriented down (dash). The methoxy group at C3 is shown pointing up, making it *cis* to the methyl group at C4.\n2.  **Reaction Type:** The reaction is conducted under thermal conditions (indicated by Δ), which means the 4π electrocyclic ring opening will proceed in a **conrotatory** fashion according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n3.  **Diene Formation:** During the conrotatory opening of the C3-C4 bond, two diastereomeric dienes can be formed due to two possible modes of rotation (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise). These two rotations applied to the chiral starting material lead to two different diastereomeric diene intermediates. The stereochemistry at C4 is complex to trace through the opening without more information, but we can assume two diastereomeric dienes are formed. However, a key insight is that the stereocenter at C4 `(C(Me,OMe))` does not have its bonds broken during the reaction, so its absolute configuration is expected to be retained in the diene intermediates.\n\n**Step 2: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n\n1.  **Reaction Partners:** The diene(s) formed in the first step react with ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH−CO₂Et), which serves as the dienophile.\n2.  **Stereoselectivity (Endo Rule):** The problem specifies that the Diels-Alder reaction occurs in an *endo* fashion. The \"endo rule\" predicts that the electron-withdrawing substituent of the dienophile (the `-CO₂Et` group) will be oriented *cis* to the newly forming bridge derived from the diene's C2-C3 bond. In the final cyclohexene product, this means the `-CO₂Et` group and the substituent on the adjacent bridgehead carbon (C5 in our analysis) will be on the same side of the ring (i.e., *cis*).\n3.  **Product Analysis:** Let's analyze the stereochemistry of the potential products (A-H). We number the cyclohexene ring starting from the quaternary carbon C1 `(C(Me,OMe))`.\n    *   **Stereocenter C1:** The starting material has the Me group pointing up and the OMe group pointing down. Assuming this stereocenter's configuration is retained, we can narrow down the possible products to A, C, E, and G. Products B, D, F, and H have the opposite configuration at C1.\n    *   **Endo-Selectivity:** We check which of the remaining products (A, C, E, G) satisfy the *endo* rule, which requires the substituent at C2 (`-CO₂Et`) and the hydrogen at C5 to be *cis*.\n        *   **Product A:** The `-CO₂Et` group is down (dash) and the H at C5 is down (dash). They are *cis*. This is a possible endo product.\n        *   **Product C:** The `-CO₂Et` group is down (dash) and the H at C5 is up (wedge). They are *trans*. This would be an exo product.\n        *   **Product E:** The `-CO₂Et` group is up (wedge) and the H at C5 is down (dash). They are *trans*. This would be an exo product.\n        *   **Product G:** The `-CO₂Et` group is up (wedge) and the H at C5 is up (wedge). They are *cis*. This is a possible endo product.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Two Products:** Based on our analysis, only products A and G fit the criteria: they both retain the stereochemistry of the C1 center from the starting material, and they are both formed via an *endo* cycloaddition. The formation of two distinct products, A and G, can be explained by the formation of a single chiral diene intermediate which then undergoes attack by the ethyl acrylate from its two different faces (diastereotopic faces), with both pathways proceeding with *endo* selectivity. This leads to the diastereomeric products A and G.\n\nTherefore, the two products are A and G.\n\n<<<A, G>>>"
