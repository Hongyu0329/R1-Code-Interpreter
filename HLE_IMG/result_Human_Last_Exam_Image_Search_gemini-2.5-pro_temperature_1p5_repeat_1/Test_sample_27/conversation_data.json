    "The full name of the artist who created this painting is **Jane Seymour Pinheiro**.\n\nBased on the signature \"Pinheiro 78\" visible in the bottom right corner of the watercolor, the artist can be identified as Jane Seymour Pinheiro (1907-1978). The year on the painting corresponds with the year of her death.\n\nJane Seymour Pinheiro was an American artist particularly known for her watercolor paintings of botanical subjects, especially the flora of the Antelope Valley in California, which earned her the nickname \"The Poppy Lady\". In addition to her detailed botanical illustrations, she also created larger works that depicted species within their natural landscape settings. The style of the submitted watercolor, a landscape featuring hills, water, and sparse vegetation, is consistent with this aspect of her work.\n\nHer husband was a native of the Azores, a Portuguese archipelago, which may have influenced her choice of landscape subjects.\n\nOther artists with the surname Pinheiro were considered, such as the Portuguese artists Pinheiro de Santamaria and António Costa Pinheiro. However, their artistic styles—oil paintings for the former and neofigurative or abstract work for the latter—do not align with the watercolor in the image.\n\n<<<Jane Seymour Pinheiro>>>"
