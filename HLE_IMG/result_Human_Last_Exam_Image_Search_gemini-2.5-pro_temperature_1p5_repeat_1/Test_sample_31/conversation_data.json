    "The knot in the picture is the 8₁₉ knot, which is also known as the true lover's knot. The Rasmussen s-invariant for this knot is -6.\n\nThe knot 8₁₉ is the nineteenth knot with a crossing number of eight in the Rolfsen table. It is a notable knot in mathematics and has even been synthesized as a molecular knot. The Rasmussen s-invariant is a modern knot invariant derived from Khovanov homology, providing information about the topology of the knot.\n\nThe 8₁₉ knot is also equivalent to the torus knot T(4,3) and the pretzel knot P(3,3,-2). For alternating knots, the Rasmussen s-invariant is equal to the signature of the knot. The signature of the 8₁₉ knot is indeed -6.\n\n<<<The Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the attached picture is -6.>>>"
