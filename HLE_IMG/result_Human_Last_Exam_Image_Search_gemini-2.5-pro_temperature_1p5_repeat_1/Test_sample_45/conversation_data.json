    "The tiling pattern shown in the image is a well-known example of a non-periodic tiling that exhibits eightfold rotational symmetry. This type of pattern is often found in Islamic art and is known as the Ammann-Beenker tiling. It is constructed from squares and rhombuses arranged in a way that creates the appearance of overlapping octagons.\n\nBy examining the image, several centers of rotational symmetry can be identified:\n\n*   **8-fold rotational symmetry:** The most prominent feature is the eight-pointed star motif formed by the meeting of eight rhombuses. The center of each of these stars is a point of 8-fold rotational symmetry. If you rotate the entire tiling by 45 degrees (360/8) around one of these central points, it will look identical to the original. This is a defining characteristic of this specific quasicrystalline structure.\n\n*   **4-fold rotational symmetry:** The tiling also contains squares. The center of each square is a point of 4-fold rotational symmetry. A rotation of 90 degrees (360/4) around the center of any square will leave the tiling unchanged.\n\n*   **2-fold rotational symmetry:** There are also points of 2-fold rotational symmetry, for instance, at the midpoints of the sides of the octagonal figures where two rhombi and two squares converge. A 180-degree rotation around these points will also map the tiling onto itself.\n\nTherefore, the tiling possesses multiple rotational symmetries, with the highest order being eightfold.\n\n<<<8-fold>>>"
