    "The circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, form a G-sharp diminished seventh chord.\n\nTo determine the correct Roman numeral, we must analyze the chord in the context of the piece's key, which is D minor.\n\n*   **Notes:** The notes in the chord are G-sharp, B, D, and F.\n*   **Chord Quality:** These notes stack in minor thirds, forming a G-sharp diminished seventh chord (G♯°7).\n*   **Harmonic Function:** This chord appears between a G minor chord (the subdominant, or iv, of D minor) in measure 8 and an A major chord (the dominant, or V, of D minor) in measure 9.\n*   **Analysis:** The G♯°7 functions as a secondary leading-tone chord. Its root, G-sharp, is the leading tone to A. Therefore, the chord resolves to the dominant (V) chord of the home key.\n\nThe correct Roman numeral for a leading-tone seventh chord of the dominant is **vii°⁷/V**.\n\n<<<vii°⁷/V>>>"
