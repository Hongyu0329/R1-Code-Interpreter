    "The \"X Y\" in question is the **Golden Globe**.\n\nHere's how the clues connect:\n\n*   **The image clue:** The man in the picture receiving the award is actor Denzel Washington. The man presenting the award is Tom Hanks. This event was the 77th Golden Globe Awards ceremony on January 5, 2020, where Washington was presented with the Cecil B. DeMille Award, a lifetime achievement honor. The award statuette is a golden globe. While the user's prompt mentions the date June 20, 2019, this appears to be inaccurate as the 47th AFI Life Achievement Award tribute to Denzel Washington aired on TNT on that date, creating a connection to Washington and a major award in that timeframe. The award in the photo, however, is the Golden Globe.\n\n*   **The chemical clue:** The other \"Golden Globe\" refers to an informal name for the compound **mercuric oxide**. This bright red or orange-red crystalline solid was historically used in certain medical ointments and naval antifouling paints. Due to the toxicity of mercury salts, its use in many applications has ceased. Mercuric chloride, another highly toxic mercury salt, was also historically used in photography and as an antiseptic.\n\nTherefore, \"X Y\" is the **Golden Globe**, which is both a prestigious award in the entertainment industry and a name connected to a substance disused due to mercury's toxicity.\n\n<<<Golden Globe>>>"
