    "To determine the metric pattern of the erasure poem, let's first analyze the words presented: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\".\n\nNow, let's examine the definitions of the provided choices:\n*   **A. Free verse:** This is a form of poetry that does not follow a prescribed or regular meter, or a rhyme scheme, and often mimics the rhythms of natural speech. The lines can be of any length.\n*   **B. Iambic pentameter:** This metric line consists of ten syllables arranged in five pairs of unstressed followed by stressed syllables (da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM).\n*   **C. Alexandrine:** This is a line of verse with 12 syllables. In English, it is also known as iambic hexameter (a line with six iambic feet).\n*   **D. Sapphic:** This is a stanza form named after the poet Sappho, consisting of four lines. The first three lines have eleven syllables, and the fourth has five.\n*   **E. Loose iambic trimeter:** A line of poetry with three iambic feet, resulting in about six syllables.\n*   **F. American sentence:** A form created by poet Allen Ginsberg which consists of a single sentence with exactly 17 syllables.\n\nThe collected words in the erasure poem are \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\". Let's count the syllables in this phrase:\n*   rules (1) + and (1) + lines (1) + an (1) + in-tri-cate (3) + spi-der's (2) + web (1) + work (1) = 11 syllables.\n\nBased on the syllable count and the definitions:\n*   It cannot be iambic pentameter (10 syllables), an alexandrine (12 syllables), iambic trimeter (6 syllables), or an American sentence (17 syllables).\n*   It is not a four-line Sapphic stanza.\n*   The poem lacks a consistent rhythm or rhyme scheme, which aligns with the definition of free verse. The words are taken from another source and rearranged without adhering to a strict metrical pattern.\n\nTherefore, the poem follows the metric pattern of free verse.\n\n<<<A>>>"
