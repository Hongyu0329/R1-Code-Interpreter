    "Here is the analysis of the biological sexes for each pair of insects:\n\n**Pair A: Female, Female (2, F, F)**\nThe insects in this pair are cuckoo bees, likely from the genus *Coelioxys*. A key characteristic for identifying the sex of these bees is the shape of the abdomen. Females possess a long, sharply pointed, cone-like abdomen which they use to pierce the nests of their host bees to lay eggs. Males, in contrast, have abdomens that are less pointed and are often armed with several spines or teeth at the tip. Both insects in image A display the distinctly long and tapered abdomen characteristic of females.\n\n**Pair B: Female, Male (4, F, M)**\nThese insects are paper wasps from the genus *Polistes*. A reliable way to distinguish males from females is by examining their antennae. The wasp on the right exhibits antennae with distinctly curled tips, which is a definitive trait of male paper wasps. The wasp on the left has straighter antennae, a feature of females. Additionally, the facial markings on the left wasp are more consistent with those of a female, while the wasp on the right has the typically paler face of a male.\n\n**Pair C: Male, Male (1, M, M)**\nThe bee on the left is a long-horned bee, likely from the genus *Melissodes*. The most prominent feature indicating its sex is its exceptionally long antennae, a hallmark of the males of this genus from which they get their common name. Females have much shorter antennae. The bee on the right is a wool carder bee (*Anthidium*). Its yellow abdominal markings and the overall robust build are characteristic of a male of this species. In an unusual reversal of typical bee dimorphism, male wool carder bees are often larger and more aggressive than females, as they territorially guard patches of flowers. Both bees, being males, do not collect pollen and therefore lack the specialized pollen-collecting hairs (scopae) that females of non-parasitic species would have.\n\n2, 4, 1\n<<<2, 4, 1>>>"
