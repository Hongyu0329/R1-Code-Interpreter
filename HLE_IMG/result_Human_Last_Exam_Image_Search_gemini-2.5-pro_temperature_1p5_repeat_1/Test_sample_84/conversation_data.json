    "The coat of arms in the image bears a strong resemblance to the historical coat of arms of the city of **Baku**, the capital of Azerbaijan.\n\nThe key features that match are the shield divided horizontally (\"per fess\"), with a blue upper half and a gold or yellow lower half. The lower section features a black or dark-colored crab. While the image shows a crescent moon in the blue section, some historical depictions and descriptions of Baku's coat of arms vary, sometimes including other symbols or flames. The combination of the horizontally divided blue and gold shield with a crab in the lower part is a distinctive feature associated with Baku's heraldry.\n\nThe elements surrounding the shield in the provided image, such as the specific crown and the olive and oak branches, are common heraldic embellishments and may not be part of the official, historical blazon but are stylistically similar to those used in civic coats of arms. The crab is a symbol of strength and holds significance in the region.\n\n<<<Baku>>>"
