    "Based on visual identification, the image provided was taken in Dulzura, an unincorporated community in San Diego County, California.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Geological Survey's Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), there are two listed elevations for Dulzura. One entry indicates an elevation of 318 meters (1043 feet). Another feature detail page lists the elevation as 425 meters (1394 feet). Given that the elevation can vary within a geographic area, a specific point of reference within Dulzura would be needed for a more precise figure. The GNIS compiles data from various topographic maps and sources, which can lead to different listed elevations for the same community.\n\n<<<318>>>"
