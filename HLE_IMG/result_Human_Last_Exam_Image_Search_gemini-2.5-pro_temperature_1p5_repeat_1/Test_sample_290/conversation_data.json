    "Based on the visual evidence in the image, the location is Richmond Beach Saltwater Park in Shoreline, Washington.\n\nThe key features that identify this location are:\n*   **The Chain-Link Fence and Railroad Tracks:** A prominent black chain-link fence runs along the edge of the beach. This fence separates the beach from the BNSF railroad tracks that run parallel to the shore, a well-documented feature of Richmond Beach Saltwater Park.\n*   **Puget Sound Shoreline:** The image shows a sunset over a large body of calm water with a forested landmass in the distance, which is characteristic of the views of Puget Sound from this park.\n*   **Beach Bonfire:** The image captures a small bonfire on the beach. While beach fires at Richmond Beach Saltwater Park are subject to restrictions and occasional bans, the park does have a designated fire ring, and fires have been a part of the park's history.\n*   **Elevated Viewpoint:** The photograph appears to have been taken from a slightly elevated position, looking down the coastline. This perspective is consistent with the views from the pedestrian bridge that crosses over the railroad tracks to provide beach access.\n\nThese details, particularly the distinctive combination of the beach, the adjacent railroad tracks, and the separating fence, make Richmond Beach Saltwater Park the definitive location.\n\n<<<Shoreline, Washington>>>"
