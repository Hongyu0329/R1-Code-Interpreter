    "The histopathological diagnosis for the provided image is **Crescentic Glomerulonephritis**, a pattern of severe glomerular injury.\n\n### Key Histopathological Features:\n\n*   **Glomerular Crescent Formation:** The most prominent feature is the presence of a large, cellular, crescent-shaped mass filling the Bowman's space and compressing the glomerular tuft. A crescent is defined as a proliferation of cells, at least two layers thick, that occupies a portion of the Bowman's space.\n*   **Cellular Composition:** These crescents are composed of proliferating parietal epithelial cells from the Bowman's capsule, along with an infiltration of inflammatory cells like macrophages and neutrophils. Fibrin is also a key component, especially in early, active lesions.\n*   **Glomerular Tuft Changes:** The glomerular capillary tuft itself is compressed and appears hypercellular. In many cases of crescentic glomerulonephritis, there are also areas of necrosis (cell death) within the tuft and ruptures of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM).\n\n### Clinical Significance:\n\nThis histological finding is characteristic of **Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN)**, a clinical syndrome defined by a rapid and severe loss of kidney function over a short period (days to weeks). The terms Crescentic Glomerulonephritis (a pathological description) and RPGN (a clinical syndrome) are often used interchangeably. The formation of crescents is a response to severe glomerular injury and, if left untreated, can lead to irreversible kidney failure.\n\n### Classification:\n\nWhile the H&E stained image clearly shows crescent formation, it does not by itself reveal the underlying cause. Crescentic glomerulonephritis is broadly classified into three types based on immunofluorescence findings:\n\n1.  **Type I (Anti-GBM Disease):** Caused by antibodies against the glomerular basement membrane.\n2.  **Type II (Immune Complex-Mediated):** Associated with diseases like lupus nephritis, IgA nephropathy, or post-infectious glomerulonephritis, where immune complexes deposit in the glomeruli.\n3.  **Type III (Pauci-Immune):** Associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and systemic vasculitides. This is the most common type.\n\nA definitive diagnosis requires correlation with clinical findings, serological tests, and specialized stains, including immunofluorescence.\n\n<<<Crescentic Glomerulonephritis>>>"
