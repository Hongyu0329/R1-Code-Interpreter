    "Based on the provided image, the lesion corresponds to a **Class I** caries classification according to the G.V. Black classification system.\n\nThis classification is used for caries affecting the pits and fissures on the occlusal (chewing) surfaces of posterior teeth (molars and premolars). The image shows decay on the occlusal surface of a molar, which falls into the Class I category. This classification is determined by the location of the decay on the tooth. Even though there appears to be a filling present, any new or recurrent decay is still classified based on its anatomical location.\n\n<<<Class I>>>"
