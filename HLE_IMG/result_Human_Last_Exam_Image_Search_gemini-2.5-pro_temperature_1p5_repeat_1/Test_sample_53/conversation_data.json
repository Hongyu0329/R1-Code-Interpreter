    "The figure leaving the chariot is the goddess Nike.\n\nThis vessel is an Apulian red-figure pelike, dated to about 370-360 B.C. and attributed to the Meleager Painter. It is currently housed in the British Museum under the reference number F331.\n\nThe scene depicted is the apotheosis, or deification, of Herakles. In it, Herakles is seen as the charioteer. The figure ascending from the chariot, identifiable by her large wings, is Nike, the goddess of victory. She is shown rising up, symbolizing Herakles' triumph and ascent to Mount Olympus to join the gods. The naked figure lying on the ground is Oinomaos, who was defeated in a chariot race.\n\nThis theme of Herakles' apotheosis, often featuring him in a chariot accompanied by a deity like Athena or Nike, was a subject in Greek vase painting. This particular vase illustrates a dramatic moment of transition and victory.<<<Nike>>>"
