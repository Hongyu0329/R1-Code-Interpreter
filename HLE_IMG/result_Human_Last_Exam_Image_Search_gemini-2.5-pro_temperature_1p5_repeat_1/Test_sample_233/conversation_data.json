    "The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image fragment is identified as **Sö 281**. This identification is based on a visual comparison of the runes, the style of the carving, and the layout of the inscription with known images of this specific runestone.\n\nThe runestone Sö 281 is one of the approximately 26 Ingvar runestones, which were raised to commemorate those who died in a Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled. This expedition took place between 1036 and 1041.\n\nThis particular stone is located in the wall of Strängnäs Cathedral in Södermanland, Sweden. The inscription on the stone commemorates a man who was the brother of Ulf and who travelled east with Ingvar, dying in Serkland (the land of the Saracens). The specific fragment in the image corresponds to the upper-left section of the complete runestone.\n\nThe runes on Sö 281 are carved in the Pr2 style. The inscription is notable for its mention of Ingvar and his journey to the east. The name \"Ingvar\" (ᛁᚴᚢᛅᚱᛁ) appears on a different part of the stone than what is shown in the main image fragment provided. The use of 'x' as a word separator is also a characteristic feature visible in the image.\n\n<<<Sö 281>>>"
