    "The small black organisms visible on the surface of the shelf fungus in the photograph are a type of **slime mold**.\n\nThe larger fungus they are growing on is a polypore, likely *Trametes versicolor*, commonly known as the Turkey Tail mushroom. The small, black, bristle-like structures are the fruiting bodies (sporangia) of a slime mold.\n\nSlime molds are eukaryotic organisms that can exist as single cells but aggregate to form multicellular reproductive structures. These structures, which can look like tiny stalks, goblets, or plumes, eventually release spores. In the image, the black stalks are the mature, spore-bearing stage of the slime mold's life cycle. While they are growing on the fungus, they are not typically parasitic; instead, they use the fungus as a surface to gain height for better spore dispersal.<<<Slime mold>>>"
