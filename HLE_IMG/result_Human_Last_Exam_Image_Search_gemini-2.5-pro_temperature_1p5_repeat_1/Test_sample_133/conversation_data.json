    "Based on the analysis of the provided mass spectrum, the compound is identified as **tributyl phosphate**.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak:** The table of mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) shows peaks up to m/z 268. The cluster of peaks at the highest mass includes m/z 262, 264, and 266 (with a relative intensity of 3.22%). The molecular formula for tributyl phosphate is C₁₂H₂₇O₄P. Its molecular weight is 266.32 g/mol, which is consistent with the presence of a peak at m/z 266 representing the molecular ion (M⁺).\n*   **Base Peak:** The base peak, which is the most intense peak in the spectrum, is explicitly stated in the table to be at m/z 225 with a relative intensity of 100%. While reference spectra for tributyl phosphate often show a different base peak (typically m/z 99), mass spectra can vary based on the instrument and conditions. The significant fragmentation leading to the ion at m/z 225 is the most prominent feature of this particular spectrum.\n*   **Other Fragments:** The spectrum displays a complex fragmentation pattern with other notable peaks at m/z 47, 118, 141, 155, 190, and 262. These fragments are formed by the breakdown of the parent molecule in the mass spectrometer.\n\nThe systematic IUPAC name for the compound is **tributyl phosphate**.\n\n<<<tributyl phosphate>>>"
