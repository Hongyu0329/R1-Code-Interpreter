    "Based on the analysis of the provided graph showing the firing activity of a neuronal culture, the synchronized bursts occur at the following approximate timestamps: 3 s, 8 s, 17 s, 27 s, and 37 s.\n\nTo calculate the average inter-burst interval (IBI), we first determine the duration of each interval between consecutive bursts:\n*   **IBI 1:** 8 s - 3 s = 5 s\n*   **IBI 2:** 17 s - 8 s = 9 s\n*   **IBI 3:** 27 s - 17 s = 10 s\n*   **IBI 4:** 37 s - 27 s = 10 s\n\nNext, we calculate the average of these intervals:\nAverage IBI = (5 s + 9 s + 10 s + 10 s) / 4 = 34 s / 4 = 8.5 s\n\nThe average inter-burst interval, to two significant figures, is 8.5 s.\n<<<8.5>>>"
