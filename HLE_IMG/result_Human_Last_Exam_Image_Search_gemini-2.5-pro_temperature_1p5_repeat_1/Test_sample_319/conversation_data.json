    "The image and the description point to a well-known auditory illusion. The top panel, a spectrogram, shows a continuous tone interrupted by a short burst of broadband noise. The bottom panel shows the corresponding waveform.\n\nThis phenomenon is known by a few names, most commonly the **auditory continuity illusion** or **temporal induction**. When a sound is interrupted for a brief period, and that gap is filled with another sound (like noise) that is loud enough to mask the gap, the human brain perceives the original sound as continuing uninterrupted through the noise. The illusion is a powerful demonstration of how the brain uses context and expectations to create a seamless perceptual experience, essentially \"filling in\" the missing information.\n\nThis illusion is not limited to simple tones; it also occurs with more complex sounds like frequency glides and even speech. When it occurs with speech, where a missing speech sound (a phoneme) is replaced by a sound like a cough or static, it is specifically called the **phonemic restoration effect**. Listeners often do not notice that a sound was missing and instead perceive the word as intact. This reveals a fundamental aspect of perception: the brain actively constructs our reality rather than passively receiving sensory input.\n\nFor the illusion to work effectively, the interrupting noise must be sufficiently loud to plausibly mask the original sound, and the gap cannot be too long. Brain regions such as the auditory cortex are involved in \"repairing\" the lost sound using past experiences and context, often unconsciously.\n\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion>>>"
