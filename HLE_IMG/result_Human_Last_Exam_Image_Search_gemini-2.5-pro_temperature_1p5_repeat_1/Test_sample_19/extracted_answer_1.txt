1. The music modulates to C major. In measure 11, the harmony is the dominant seventh (V7) of C major, and the first beat of measure 12 resolves to a C major chord.
2. The modulation is justified by a series of steps. The piece first moves from C-sharp minor to its relative major, E major. Then, using mode mixture, it shifts to E minor. The subsequent modulation to C major is a move to the relative major of E minor. This creates harmonic variety and embodies the "fantasia" style of the movement.
3. The complete and accurate Roman numeral for the first beat of measure 11 is V‚Å∑/VI (in the key of E minor).
