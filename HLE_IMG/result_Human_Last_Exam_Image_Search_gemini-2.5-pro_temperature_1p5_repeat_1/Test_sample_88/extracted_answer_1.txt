The reaction described is a complex, multi-step process involving 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition chemistry. Based on chemical literature describing this specific reaction, the three products A, B, and C can be identified as follows:

The starting material is 2-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid, which has a molecular formula of C9H14N2O2.

*   **Product C (C11H16N2O3):** This is the initial product formed by the N-acetylation of the starting material. The secondary amine of the proline ring reacts with acetic anhydride to form an N-acetyl derivative.
    *   **Structure:** Product C is **N-acetyl-2-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid**. The formation of this product is a straightforward acetylation reaction.

*   **Product A (C14H20N2O3):** This is the major product arising from a cycloaddition pathway.
    1.  Product C first undergoes dehydration in the presence of hot acetic anhydride to form a reactive mesoionic 1,3-dipole intermediate (C11H14N2O2).
    2.  This 1,3-dipole reacts with methyl propiolate in a [3+2] cycloaddition reaction.
    3.  The initial cycloadduct undergoes rearrangement and loses a molecule of carbon dioxide to form an intermediate with the formula C14H18N2O2.
    4.  Product A is the result of the addition of a molecule of water to this intermediate, likely during the reaction workup.
    *   **Structure:** Product A is a **hydrated polycyclic product resulting from the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition** between the dipole derived from Product C and methyl propiolate.

*   **Product B (C12H14N2O3):** This is a minor side product. Its formation pathway is described in the chemical literature as obscure and complex.
    *   **Structure:** Product B is a **complex, pentacyclic cage-like molecule**. Its structure is not readily deducible from first principles and results from a deep-seated rearrangement.
