    "I have analyzed the visual characteristics of each rock specimen and performed targeted searches to confirm my initial identifications.\n\nFor specimen H, its reddish color and vesicular texture pointed towards scoria or pumice. The search results confirmed that scoria is typically dark-colored (reddish-brown, black) and denser than pumice, while pumice is usually light-colored. The reddish hue and substantial vesicle walls of specimen H are more consistent with scoria.\n\nFor specimen I, its composition of angular fragments cemented together suggested it was a type of breccia. Search results differentiate breccia from conglomerate by the angularity of the clasts; breccia has angular fragments while conglomerate has rounded ones. The fragments in specimen I are clearly angular. Given the likely volcanic context of the other specimens, it is identifiable as a volcanic breccia, which consists of angular volcanic rock fragments.\n\nFor specimen J, the very light color and highly porous, frothy appearance were strong indicators of pumice. The search results confirmed that pumice is a light-colored, extremely vesicular volcanic rock, so light that it can often float on water. These characteristics perfectly match specimen J.\n\nFor specimen K, the presence of large crystals embedded in a fine-grained matrix is a classic porphyritic texture. This texture indicates a two-stage cooling history for the magma. The rock can be described as a porphyry or as having a porphyritic texture. The name can be refined by identifying the groundmass or phenocrysts (e.g., porphyritic andesite, granite porphyry), but based on the visual evidence, identifying it as having a porphyritic texture is accurate.\n\nI have sufficient information to confidently identify all four specimens.\n**H:** Scoria\n**I:** Volcanic Breccia\n**J:** Pumice\n**K:** Porphyry\n\nBased on a visual analysis and supporting information, the rock specimens are identified as follows:\n\n*   **Specimen H is Scoria.** This rock displays a reddish-brown color and is highly vesicular, meaning it is full of gas bubbles. Its darker color and thicker vesicle walls differentiate it from pumice. Scoria is formed from gas-rich lava that cools rapidly. The red color is often due to the oxidation of iron during the eruption.\n\n*   **Specimen I is Volcanic Breccia.** This rock is composed of angular fragments of other rocks cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. The term \"breccia\" is used when the fragments are angular, as opposed to \"conglomerate\" which has rounded fragments. Since the fragments appear to be of volcanic origin, it is classified as a volcanic breccia.\n\n*   **Specimen J is Pumice.** This specimen is light-colored and extremely porous, giving it a frothy, glass-like appearance. Pumice is formed from gas-rich, frothy magma that has cooled quickly. Its high porosity and low density are characteristic, often making it light enough to float on water.\n\n*   **Specimen K is a Porphyry.** This rock exhibits a porphyritic texture, characterized by large, well-formed crystals (phenocrysts) embedded in a fine-grained groundmass. This texture indicates a two-stage cooling process: an initial slow cooling period deep within the Earth's crust that allowed the large crystals to grow, followed by a more rapid cooling after the magma erupted to the surface.\n\n<<<\n*   **H: Scoria**\n*   **I: Volcanic Breccia**\n*   **J: Pumice**\n*   **K: Porphyry**\n>>>"
