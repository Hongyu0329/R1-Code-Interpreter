    "The poetic form used in the sequence of erasure poems, including \"The Other Clouds,\" is the Tanka.\n\nA Tanka is a Japanese form of poetry that consists of five lines with a specific syllable structure:\n\n*   **Line 1:** 5 syllables\n*   **Line 2:** 7 syllables\n*   **Line 3:** 5 syllables\n*   **Line 4:** 7 syllables\n*   **Line 5:** 7 syllables\n\nThis form builds upon the Haiku (5-7-5) by adding two additional seven-syllable lines, which allows for a more developed expression of a theme or narrative. The first part of the poem often sets a scene, while the subsequent lines can offer a reflection or emotional response to that scene.\n\nThe poem from the work by artist Mary Jo Bang, which includes the line represented in the image (\"ghostly velum forms like a dance, a vortex\") and concludes with \"nacreous wavers,\" adheres to this 5-7-5-7-7 syllabic pattern.\n\n<<<Tanka>>>"
