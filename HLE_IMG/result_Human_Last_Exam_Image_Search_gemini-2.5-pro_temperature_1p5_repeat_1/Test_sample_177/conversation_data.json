    "To determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we first need to calculate the total Car VMT for both the Baseline (Table 1) and Proposed (Table 2) scenarios. We can do this by calculating a weighted average VMT for each scenario.\n\nThe calculation for VMT in each distance segment is as follows:\n*VMT Segment = (Share of Total Trips) x (Total Car Mode Share for the Segment) x (Average Trip Distance)*\n\nWe will then sum the VMT from all four distance segments to get the total VMT for each scenario.\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate Total Car VMT for the Baseline Scenario**\n\nFirst, we determine the total car mode share for each distance segment by adding the share of \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 25% + 28% = 53%\n    *   VMT = 0.48 (share of trips) × 0.53 (car share) × 1 (avg distance) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   VMT = 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   VMT = 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   VMT = 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = 2.8480\n\n**Total Baseline VMT** = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077** (This represents the average miles per trip across all modes).\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate Total Car VMT for the Proposed Scenario**\n\nWe repeat the same calculation using the data from Table 2.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   VMT = 0.48 × 0.03 × 1 = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   VMT = 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   VMT = 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   VMT = 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = 1.5680\n\n**Total Proposed VMT** = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction in Car VMT**\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage reduction using the VMT totals from the Baseline and Proposed scenarios.\n\n*   **VMT Reduction** = Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT) × 100\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100 ≈ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the percentage reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
