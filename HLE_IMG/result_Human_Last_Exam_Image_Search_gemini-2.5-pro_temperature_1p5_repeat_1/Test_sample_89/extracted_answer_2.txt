Here are the drawn structures for products A, B, and C based on the detailed reaction mechanisms provided.

**Product A:**
Following the Huisgen cycloaddition and subsequent cycloreversion, the main heterocyclic product formed is a complex pyrrole derivative.


**Product B:**
This product is formed from the Michael addition pathway, which, after fragmentation, yields a stable bicyclic lactam.


**Product C:**
Arising from the Dakin-West pathway, this product is the acetylated proline-derived portion of the starting molecule after fragmentation.
