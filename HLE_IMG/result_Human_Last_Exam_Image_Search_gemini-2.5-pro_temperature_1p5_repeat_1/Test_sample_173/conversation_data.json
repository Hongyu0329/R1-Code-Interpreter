    "To determine the time signature of the musical measure, we need to count the total number of beats in the measure for both the right and left hand parts. A time signature indicates the number of beats per measure and which note value gets one beat.\n\n**Analysis of the Right Hand (Treble Clef):**\n*   The first beat consists of an eighth-note chord (C# and E) played simultaneously with a sixteenth rest followed by a sixteenth note (G#). Together, these have a duration equivalent to one quarter note.\n*   The second beat is a group of four sixteenth notes (A#, G#, F#, E#), which equals one quarter note.\n*   The third beat is another group of four sixteenth notes (F#, G#, A#, B), also equaling one quarter note.\n*   The fourth beat is a final group of four sixteenth notes (C#, B, A#, G#), which also equals one quarter note.\n*   Adding these up (1 + 1 + 1 + 1), we get a total of four quarter notes in the right hand.\n\n**Analysis of the Left Hand (Bass Clef):**\n*   The left hand begins with an octave (C#) held as a dotted half note. A dotted half note has a duration of three quarter notes.\n*   Following the dotted half note is a quarter note octave (C#), which has a duration of one quarter note.\n*   The total duration in the left hand is three quarter notes plus one quarter note, which equals four quarter notes.\n\nSince both the right and left hand parts add up to four quarter notes, the time signature for this measure is 4/4.\n\nThe piece is identifiable as Frédéric Chopin's Étude Op. 10, No. 4 in C-sharp minor, also known as the \"Torrent\" etude. This piece is written in 4/4 time (often indicated by \"C\" for common time).\n\n<<<C>>>"
