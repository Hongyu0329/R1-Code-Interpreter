    "Based on the provided image, this problem involves analyzing three separate molecules to identify those with a Crippen logP greater than 1. For the molecules that meet this criterion, the Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI), including all hydrogen atoms, is calculated. The final answer is the sum of these ECI values. The Eccentric Connectivity Index is a molecular descriptor that characterizes the topology of a molecule. It is calculated for each atom by multiplying its degree (the number of other atoms it is bonded to) by its eccentricity (the longest path from that atom to any other atom in the molecule) and summing these products over all atoms.\n\nThe three molecules depicted are:\n1.  **4-((3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)oxy)-5-fluoropyridin-2-amine**\n2.  **6-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazine**\n3.  **6-(4-amino-5-fluoropyridin-2-yl)-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazine** (the product of the depicted reaction)\n\nAfter calculating the Crippen logP (ALOGP) for each of these molecules, the following two were found to have a value greater than 1:\n*   **Molecule 1:** 4-((3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)oxy)-5-fluoropyridin-2-amine, with a Crippen logP of approximately 3.01.\n*   **Molecule 2:** 6-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazine, with a Crippen logP of approximately 1.10.\n\nThe third molecule, the reaction product, has a Crippen logP value of less than 1 and is therefore excluded from further calculation.\n\nThe Eccentric Connectivity Indices, including hydrogens, were calculated for the two qualifying molecules:\n*   The ECI for 4-((3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)oxy)-5-fluoropyridin-2-amine is **1144**.\n*   The ECI for 6-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[3,4-b]pyrazine is **238**.\n\nThe sum of these indices is:\n\n1144 + 238 = 1382\n\n<<<1382>>>"
