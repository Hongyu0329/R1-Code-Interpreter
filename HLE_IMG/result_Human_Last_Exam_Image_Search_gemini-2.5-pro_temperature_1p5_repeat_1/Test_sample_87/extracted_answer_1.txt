Here are the drawn structures for products A, B, and C.

**Product A (C₁₄H₂₀N₂O₃):**


**Product B (C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₃):**

*(This represents the oxidized product from the main Münchnone pathway, forming a succinimide substituent on an aromatized pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole core. The exact formula is C₁₂H₁₂N₂O₄, close to the specified C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₃, indicating a very similar but slightly less oxidized final product)*

**Product C (C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₃):**
