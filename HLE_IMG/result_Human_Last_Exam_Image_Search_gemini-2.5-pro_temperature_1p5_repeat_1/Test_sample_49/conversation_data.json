    "To determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$, we first need to find the Thevenin equivalent resistance ($R_{th}$) seen from the terminals of the capacitor C. The cutoff frequency is given by the formula $\\omega_c = 1 / (R_{th}C)$ (for angular frequency) or $f_c = 1 / (2\\pi R_{th}C)$.\n\n### Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$) Calculation\n\n1.  **Modify the circuit for Thevenin analysis:**\n    *   The capacitor C is removed from node $a_0$.\n    *   The input voltage source at \"IN\" (node $c_0$) is deactivated, which means node $c_0$ is connected to ground.\n    *   The Thevenin resistance, $R_{th}$, is the equivalent resistance looking into node $a_0$ with respect to ground.\n\n2.  **Analyze the infinite ladder network:**\n    The circuit is an infinite ladder of resistors, all having the same resistance value 'r'. We need to find the resistance from node $a_0$ to ground, with node $c_0$ also being grounded. We will use nodal analysis on the infinite ladder.\n\n    Let $u_n$ be the voltage at node $c_n$ on the upper rail and $v_n$ be the voltage at the corresponding node on the lower rail ($a_0$ is $v_0$, $d_1$ is $v_1$, and so on).\n\n    For the Thevenin calculation, we apply a test current $I_0$ at node $a_0$ ($v_0$) and calculate the resulting voltage $v_0$. Then $R_{th} = v_0 / I_0$.\n\n3.  **Set up the network equations:**\n    The boundary condition is that the input node is grounded: $u_0 = 0$.\n    For any node $c_n$ where $n \\geq 1$, the Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) is:\n    $\\frac{u_n - u_{n-1}}{r} + \\frac{u_n - u_{n+1}}{r} + \\frac{u_n - v_n}{r} = 0 \\implies 3u_n - u_{n-1} - u_{n+1} - v_n = 0$\n\n    For any node $v_n$ where $n \\geq 1$, the KCL is:\n    $\\frac{v_n - v_{n-1}}{r} + \\frac{v_n - v_{n+1}}{r} + \\frac{v_n - u_n}{r} = 0 \\implies 3v_n - v_{n-1} - v_{n+1} - u_n = 0$\n\n    At node $v_0$ (which is $a_0$), the injected current $I_0$ flows to node $v_1$ (which is $d_1$) as per the diagram:\n    $I_0 = \\frac{v_0 - v_1}{r}$\n\n4.  **Solve the recurrence relations:**\n    We look for solutions of the form $u_n = A\\lambda^n$ and $v_n = B\\lambda^n$. Substituting these into the general KCL equations yields a characteristic equation for $\\lambda$: $\\lambda^2 - 4\\lambda + 1 = 0$.\n    For the voltages to remain bounded as $n \\to \\infty$, we must choose the solution with magnitude less than 1, which is $\\lambda = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$. For this value of $\\lambda$, it can be shown that the solutions have the form $u_n = -v_n$.\n\n    The general bounded solution can be expressed as:\n    $u_n = K_1 + K_2 \\lambda^n$\n    $v_n = K_1 - K_2 \\lambda^n$\n\n5.  **Apply boundary conditions:**\n    *   $u_0 = 0 \\implies K_1 + K_2 = 0 \\implies K_1 = -K_2$.\n    *   This simplifies the solutions to:\n        $u_n = K_2(\\lambda^n - 1)$\n        $v_n = -K_2(\\lambda^n + 1)$\n\n6.  **Calculate $R_{th}$:**\n    From the simplified solution, the voltage at node $v_0$ is $v_0 = -K_2(\\lambda^0 + 1) = -2K_2$.\n    The voltage at node $v_1$ is $v_1 = -K_2(\\lambda^1 + 1) = -K_2(\\lambda + 1)$.\n    The injected current is $I_0 = \\frac{v_0 - v_1}{r} = \\frac{-2K_2 - (-K_2(\\lambda+1))}{r} = \\frac{K_2(-2+\\lambda+1)}{r} = \\frac{K_2(\\lambda-1)}{r}$.\n    The Thevenin resistance is the ratio of the voltage $v_0$ to the current $I_0$:\n    $R_{th} = \\frac{v_0}{I_0} = \\frac{-2K_2}{K_2(\\lambda-1)/r} = \\frac{-2r}{\\lambda-1}$.\n    Substituting $\\lambda = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$:\n    $R_{th} = \\frac{-2r}{(2-\\sqrt{3})-1} = \\frac{-2r}{1-\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3}-1}$.\n    Rationalizing the denominator gives:\n    $R_{th} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{(\\sqrt{3}-1)(\\sqrt{3}+1)} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{3-1} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$.\n\n### Cutoff Frequency Calculation\n\nThe circuit at node $a_0$ is a simple RC low-pass filter with the equivalent resistance $R_{th}$ and the given capacitance $C$.\nThe transfer function is $H(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{1 + j\\omega R_{th}C}$.\nThe cutoff angular frequency, $\\omega_c$, is the frequency at which the magnitude of the gain drops to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its DC value. This occurs when the real and imaginary parts of the denominator are equal:\n$1 = \\omega_c R_{th} C$.\nTherefore, the cutoff frequency is:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$.\nSubstituting the expression for $R_{th}$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{rC(1+\\sqrt{3})}$.\n\nThis expression can also be written with a rationalized numerator:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{rC(1+\\sqrt{3})} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{3}-1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{rC(3-1)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{2rC}$.\n\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency expressed in terms of *r* and *C*. Both expressions are equivalent. We will provide the first form.\n\n<<<The cutoff frequency at node $a_0$ is $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{rC(1+\\sqrt{3})}$.>>>"
