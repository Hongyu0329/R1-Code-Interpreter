    "The product advertised with the slogan \"Women are winning the War - of Freedom\" was a line of cosmetics by the French-derived brand name Bourjois.\n\nThe full advertisement, often for \"Evening in Paris\" (Soir de Paris) perfume and makeup, acknowledged the vital role of women in the war effort. It then alluded to menstruation as a \"handicap of inherent monthly disability\" or a \"recurring handicap,\" suggesting that using Bourjois cosmetics could help women feel their best and overcome this challenge, thereby maintaining their contribution to war production without interruption.\n\n<<<Bourjois>>>"
