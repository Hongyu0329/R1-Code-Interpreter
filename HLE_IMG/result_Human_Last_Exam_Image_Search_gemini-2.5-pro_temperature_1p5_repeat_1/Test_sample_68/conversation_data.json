    "This coin is a 9 Deniers piece issued under King Louis XV for the French colonies. Based on the inscription \"COLONIES FRANÇOISES,\" it was intended for general circulation in various French colonial territories rather than a single specific colony.\n\nThese particular copper coins were minted in 1721 and 1722. According to historical records, a large quantity was initially sent to Canada in 1722. However, the colonists there were reluctant to use them, leading to the return of most of the shipment to France in 1726. Subsequently, these coins were sent to other French territories, including Louisiana. A number of these coins also reached Île Bourbon (modern-day Réunion) in 1723, where they were well-received.\n\nTherefore, this coin was circulated in multiple French colonies, primarily in the Americas (New France, including Canada and Louisiana) and the Indian Ocean.\n\n<<<This coin was minted for general circulation in the French colonies, including New France (Canada, Louisiana) and Île Bourbon (Réunion), and does not originate from a single specific colony.>>>"
