    "The knot in the image is the 10_124 knot in the Alexander-Briggs notation. It is also known as the (5,3)-torus knot.\n\nThe Jones polynomial, V(t), for this knot is:\n\nt^12 - t^11 + t^9 - t^8 + t^7 - t^6 + t^5 - t^3 + t^2 - t + 1\n\nThis can be found in various knot theory resources. For instance, the Knot Atlas provides information about the polynomial invariants of the 10_124 knot, also denoted as T(5,3). While some sources might present the polynomial with a different variable or in a different form (e.g., using q instead of t, or in ascending order), the coefficients and powers remain the same. It's worth noting that the Jones polynomial for the 10_124 knot has gaps, meaning some powers of 't' are missing.\n\nInterestingly, the cinquefoil knot, also known as the (5,2)-torus knot or 5_1 knot, has a different Jones polynomial. Also, some knots, like the 10_132 knot, can have the same Jones polynomial as other knots.\n\n<<<t^12 - t^11 + t^9 - t^8 + t^7 - t^6 + t^5 - t^3 + t^2 - t + 1>>>"
