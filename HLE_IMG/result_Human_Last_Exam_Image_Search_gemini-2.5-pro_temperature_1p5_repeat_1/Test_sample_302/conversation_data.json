    "The four characters on the seal, written in an ancient script known as seal script (篆书, zhuànshū), are to be read from top to bottom, and from the right column to the left column.\n\nThe characters are:\n*   **Top Right:** 靜 (jìng)\n*   **Bottom Right:** 慮 (lǜ)\n*   **Top Left:** 讀 (dú)\n*   **Bottom Left:** 書 (shū)\n\nIn simplified Chinese, these characters are written as:\n*   静 (jìng)\n*   虑 (lǜ)\n*   读 (dú)\n*   书 (shū)\n\nTogether, they form the four-character idiom **静虑读书** (jìnglǜ dúshū).\n\nThis phrase can be translated as \"to contemplate quietly and to read books\" or \"to study with a calm and focused mind.\" It expresses a scholarly ideal of quiet reflection and diligent learning. Chinese seals are often engraved with such auspicious or philosophical phrases, in addition to names.\n\nThe reading order for four-character seals is typically vertical, starting with the rightmost column.\n\n<<<静虑读书>>>"
