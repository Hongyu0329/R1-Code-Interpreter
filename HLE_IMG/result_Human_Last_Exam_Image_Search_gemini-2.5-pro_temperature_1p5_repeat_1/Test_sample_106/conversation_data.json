    "The transformation shown is a classic acid-catalyzed backbone rearrangement of a triterpenoid alcohol. This multi-step process involves a series of concerted-hydride and-methyl shifts, also known as Wagner-Meerwein rearrangements. The driving force for this cascade is the formation of progressively more stable carbocation intermediates, culminating in the formation of a thermodynamically stable, highly substituted alkene.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis of the substituent migrations to determine the final structure:\n\n1.  **Carbocation Formation:** The reaction begins with the protonation of the hydroxyl group (-OH) by the acid catalyst (HCl), followed by the loss of a water molecule. This generates an initial secondary carbocation at the C3 position.\n2.  **First-Shift (Methyl):** To form a more stable tertiary carbocation, a methyl group (CH3) from the adjacent C4 migrates to C3. The positive charge is now at C4. The other methyl group at C4 remains in its original position, which corresponds to **position 1** in the product. Thus, **1 = CH3**.\n3.  **Second-Shift (Hydride):** A hydrogen atom (H) from C5 shifts to the positively charged C4. This moves the carbocation to C5.\n4.  **Third-Shift (Methyl):** A methyl group from C10 shifts to C5, relocating the carbocation to the C10 position. This migrated methyl group now occupies **position 2**. Therefore, **2 = CH3**.\n5.  **Fourth-Shift (Hydride):** A hydrogen atom from C9 shifts to C10, moving the carbocation to C9. The original hydrogen from C9 now occupies **position 3**. Consequently, **3 = H**.\n6.  **Fifth-Shift (Methyl):** The methyl group at C8 migrates to C9. This places the positive charge at C8 and moves this methyl group to what is labeled as **position 4**. Hence, **4 = CH3**.\n7.  **Sixth-Shift (Methyl):** A methyl group from C14 moves to C8, shifting the carbocation to C14.\n8.  **Seventh-Shift (Hydride):** A hydrogen atom from C13 migrates to C14, moving the cation to C13. This hydrogen now occupies **position 5**. Thus, **5 = H**.\n9.  **Elimination:** Finally, a proton is removed from C12 to neutralize the carbocation at C13, forming the stable tetrasubstituted double bond observed in the final product.\n\nBased on this well-established rearrangement cascade, the substituents at the indicated positions are as follows:\n\n1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H.\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
