    "The title of the painting is **\"The Windmill Fire\"**. It was painted by the Dutch artist **Adriaen Lievensz. van der Poel**.\n\nWhile you mentioned the painting is from the 19th century, it was actually created in the 17th century, as the artist lived from 1628 to 1671. The artwork depicts a dramatic scene of a windmill engulfed in flames against a dark, cloudy sky. Another title for this work is \"The Burning Windmill, 1662\".\n\nThe painting is housed in the National Museum in Warsaw.\n\n<<<The Windmill Fire>>>"
