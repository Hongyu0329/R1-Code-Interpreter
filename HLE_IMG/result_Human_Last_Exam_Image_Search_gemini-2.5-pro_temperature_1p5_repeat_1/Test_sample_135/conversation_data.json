    "This detail of the altarpiece is from the \"Altar of the Sacrament\" and its author is Andrea della Robbia, a prominent Florentine sculptor of the High Renaissance. The altarpiece, created in 1512, is a glazed terracotta work located in the Church of Santi Apostoli in Florence. It is believed that Andrea della Robbia collaborated with his son, Giovanni, on this piece.\n\nAndrea della Robbia (1435â€“1525) was the nephew and successor of Luca della Robbia and was renowned for his skill in creating colorful and durable glazed terracotta sculptures. His workshop produced numerous altarpieces and other decorative works for churches and patrons throughout Tuscany, including the prominent Albizzi family of Florence. The technique involved applying tin glazes, similar to those used by potters, to fired clay, resulting in a vibrant and lustrous finish that would have beautifully reflected the candlelight within a chapel.\n\nThe inscription \"SACRAMENT DE L'AUTEL\" visible at the bottom of the relief directly translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" confirming the subject matter of the artwork which depicts a communion scene. This theme was a common subject in religious art of the period, as seen in other works like the \"Altarpiece of the Holy Sacrament\" by Dieric Bouts and \"The Seven Sacraments Altarpiece\" by Rogier van der Weyden. However, the distinct style of the relief, characterized by its serene figures and decorative floral border, is a hallmark of the Della Robbia family workshop.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
