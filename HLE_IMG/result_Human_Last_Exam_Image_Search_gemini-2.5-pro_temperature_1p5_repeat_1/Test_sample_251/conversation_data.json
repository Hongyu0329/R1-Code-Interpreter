    "To determine the longest R-R interval on the provided rhythm strip, one must first understand the relationship between the distance on the ECG paper and time. The paper speed is noted as 25 mm/sec. This standard speed means that each small 1 mm square on the grid represents 0.04 seconds, and each large 5 mm square represents 0.20 seconds.\n\nThe R-R interval is the time elapsed between two consecutive R-waves, which are typically the tallest peaks in the QRS complex. To find the longest interval, the entire ECG strip must be visually inspected for the greatest distance between any two sequential R-waves.\n\nUpon examining the provided rhythm strip, a notable pause occurs in the fourth row, which begins near the timestamp `0:06:08`. The longest R-R interval is observed here, between the third and fourth QRS complexes on this line.\n\nTo calculate the duration of this interval:\n*   **Measurement:** The distance between the peaks of these two R-waves is measured by counting the grid squares. The interval spans approximately 21 small squares (or 4 large squares and 1 small square).\n*   **Calculation:** The number of small squares is then multiplied by the time duration of each square.\n\nCalculation: 21 small squares Ã— 0.04 seconds/small square = 0.84 seconds.\n\n<<<0.84>>>"
