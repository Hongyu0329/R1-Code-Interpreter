    "My plan is to analyze the harmony in measure 30 of the provided score to determine its Roman numeral representation.\n\n1.  **Identify the Key:** The piece is in C minor, which has a key signature of three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭).\n2.  **Identify the Notes:** In measure 30, the left hand plays an octave G♯. The right hand plays a chord consisting of G♯, B♮, D, and F.\n3.  **Identify the Chord:** The collected notes are G♯, B♮, D, and F. This spells a G♯ fully diminished seventh chord (G♯°7).\n4.  **Determine the Chord's Function:** A diminished seventh chord most often functions as a leading-tone chord. The root of this chord, G♯, is the leading tone to the note A. Therefore, the G♯°7 chord is functioning as the leading-tone chord of A minor or A major.\n5.  **Apply Roman Numeral Analysis:** In the key of C minor, the sixth scale degree (the submediant) is A♭. The chord built on it is an A♭ major chord, represented by the Roman numeral VI. However, composers frequently borrow the minor submediant (A minor, represented by vi) from the parallel major key (C major). The G♯°7 chord is preparing or \"tonicizing\" this borrowed A minor chord.\n6.  **Construct the Final Numeral:** This type of chord is called a secondary leading-tone chord. The Roman numeral is constructed as follows:\n    *   `vii°7`: Represents the leading-tone fully diminished seventh chord.\n    *   `/vi`: Indicates that it is the leading-tone chord \"of the minor submediant\".\n    *   The complete Roman numeral is **vii°7/vi**.\n\nI will now write a Python script to print this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_measure_30():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the harmony of measure 30 from Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata, 1st movement,\n    and provides the correct Roman numeral.\n    \"\"\"\n    key = \"C minor\"\n    measure = 30\n    notes_in_chord = [\"G-sharp\", \"B-natural\", \"D\", \"F\"]\n    chord_name = \"G-sharp fully diminished seventh (G#°7)\"\n\n    print(f\"Analysis of Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata, 1st Movement, Measure {measure}:\")\n    print(f\"1.
