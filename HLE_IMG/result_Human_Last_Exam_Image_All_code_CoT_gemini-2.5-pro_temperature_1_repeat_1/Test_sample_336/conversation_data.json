    "To solve this problem, I will first identify all the unique molecules depicted in the reaction scheme. Then, for each molecule, I will calculate its Crippen logP to determine which ones meet the criterion of being greater than 1. For the molecule(s) that satisfy this condition, I will calculate their Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI), ensuring to include hydrogen atoms in the molecular graph as specified. The ECI of a molecule is the sum of products of the vertex degree and eccentricity for each atom. If more than one molecule has a logP > 1, I will sum their individual ECI values to get the final answer.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify Molecules**: Parse the image to get the chemical structures. There are three distinct molecules: the reactant on the far left, the reactant in the middle, and the product on the right.\n2.  **Calculate Crippen logP**: Use the RDKit library to calculate the logP for each molecule.\n3.  **Filter Molecules**: Select only the molecules with a logP value greater than 1.\n4.  **Calculate Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI)**: For each selected molecule:\n    a. Add explicit hydrogen atoms.\n    b. For each atom in the molecule (including hydrogens), determine its degree (number of connections) and its eccentricity (the longest shortest-path distance to any other atom).\n    c. Calculate the product of the degree and eccentricity for each atom.\n    d. Sum these products to get the ECI for the molecule. The full equation with all its terms will be printed as requested.\n5.  **Sum the Results**: If multiple molecules meet the logP criterion, sum their ECI values to obtain the final result.\n\nI will now provide the Python code to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Ensure required libraries are available.\ntry:\n    from rdkit import Chem\n    from rdkit.Chem import Crippen\n    import numpy as np\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Error: Required Python libraries (rdkit, numpy) are not installed.\")\n    print(\"Please install them using the command: pip install rdkit-pypi numpy\")\n    sys.exit(1)\n\ndef calculate_eci(mol_h):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI) for a molecule with explicit hydrogens.\n    The function also prints the full calculation details as requested.\n    ECI = sum(degree(i) * eccentricity(i))\n    \"\"\"\n    num_atoms = mol_h.GetNumAtoms()\n    if num_atoms == 0:\n        return 0\n\n    # Get the graph distance matrix (shortest path between all pairs of atoms)\n    dist_matrix = Chem.GetDistanceMatrix(mol_h)\n    \n    eci = 0\n    \n    print(\"\\nCalculating Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI):\")\n    print(\"Formula: ECI = sum over all atoms i [degree(i) * eccentricity(i)]\")\n    print(\"where eccentricity(i) is the longest shortest-path from atom i to any other atom.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    equation_terms = []\n    for i in range(num_atoms):\n        atom = mol_h.GetAtomWithIdx(i)\n        degree = atom.GetDegree()\n        \n        # Eccentricity is the maximum value in the i-th row of the distance matrix\n        eccentricity = int(np.max(dist_matrix[i]))\n        \n        term = degree * eccentricity\n        eci += term\n        \n        # Store the term as a string for the final equation printout\n        equation_terms.append(f\"({degree} * {eccentricity})\")\n\n    # Print the full equation as requested\n    print(\"ECI = \" + \" + \".join(equation_terms))\n    print(f\"\\nValue of ECI for this molecule: {eci}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    return eci\n\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to solve the user's task.\n    1.
