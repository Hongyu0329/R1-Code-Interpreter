    "My plan to identify the music from the provided sheet music is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze Musical Elements:** I will examine the key signature (A minor/C major, but heavily chromatic), time signature (4/4), tempo (Andante, quarter note = 80), and dynamics (ranging from piano to forte).\n2.  **Identify Structural Patterns:** I'll observe the structure of the piece, noting the quiet, melodic two-bar introduction which then erupts into a highly virtuosic and dramatic section. This main section is characterized by rapid, sixteenth-note broken chord arpeggios in the right hand (outlining a clear i-iv-V progression in A minor: Am -> Dm -> E) against powerful chords and octaves in the left hand.\n3.  **Recognize the Style:** The virtuosic style, combining lyrical melodies with explosive, technical passages, is very characteristic of modern piano arrangements of popular music, particularly from anime.\n4.  **Identify the Piece:** Based on these distinct features—the specific melodic fragments, the A minor tonality, and the iconic fast arpeggio patterns—I will identify the piece. This pattern is famously from the piano arrangement of \"Unravel,\" the opening theme from the anime *Tokyo Ghoul*, arranged by Animenz.\n5.  **Generate Code:** I will write a simple Python script to print the identified name of the music.\n\n```python\ndef guess_music():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the music based on analysis of the sheet music.\n    The sheet music is for a piano arrangement of a famous anime theme.\n\n    Key Features Identified:\n    - Key: A minor\n    - Tempo: Starts Andante (♩=80), then becomes very fast and agitated.\n    - Signature Pattern: A quiet 2-bar intro followed by an explosion of fast,\n      16th-note broken-chord arpeggios in the right hand over a i-iv-V progression.\n\n    This unique and highly recognizable combination of elements points to a specific piece.\n    \"\"\"\n    music_title = \"Unravel\"\n    original_artist = \"Ling Tosite Sigure\"\n    anime_source = \"Tokyo Ghoul\"\n    arranger = \"Animenz (This specific version)\"\n\n    print(f\"The music is 'Unravel', the opening theme from the anime 'Tokyo Ghoul'.\")\n    print(f\"This specific virtuosic piano arrangement is by Animenz.\")\n\nguess_music()\n```\n<<<Unravel>>>"
