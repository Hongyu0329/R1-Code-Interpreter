    This function identifies the music based on analysis of the sheet music.
    The sheet music is for a piano arrangement of a famous anime theme.

    Key Features Identified:
    - Key: A minor
    - Tempo: Starts Andante (â™©=80), then becomes very fast and agitated.
    - Signature Pattern: A quiet 2-bar intro followed by an explosion of fast,
      16th-note broken-chord arpeggios in the right hand over a i-iv-V progression.

    This unique and highly recognizable combination of elements points to a specific piece.
