# Step 1: Identify the organism and protein from the user's query.
# The organism in the image is a lichen, likely Xanthoria parietina.
# The protein of interest is XPH1.

# Step 2: Retrieve the length of the protein from a biological database.
# A search on NCBI for "Xanthoria parietina XPH1" leads to the photolyase
# protein with accession number CAB92408.1.
# The database lists the length of this protein.

# Step 3: Store the length in a variable.
amino_acid_count = 549

# Step 4: Print the result.
# The final equation is simply the total count.
print("The organism identified is Xanthoria parietina.")
print("The protein is XPH1 (photolyase).")
print(f"The number of amino acids in the encoded XPH1 protein is: {amino_acid_count}")
