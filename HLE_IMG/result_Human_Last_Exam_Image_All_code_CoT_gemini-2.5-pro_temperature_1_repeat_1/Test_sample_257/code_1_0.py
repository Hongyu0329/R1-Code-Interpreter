# 1. Analysis of the reaction
# The reaction of the di-propyl diazaoxatriangulenium (Pr-DAOTA) cation with concentrated sulfuric acid
# is an electrophilic aromatic substitution, specifically sulfonation. This adds sulfonic acid (-SO3H)
# groups to the aromatic rings, which makes the resulting product (Compound 1) water-soluble.

# 2. Identification of the most deshielded proton
# The Â¹H NMR spectrum of polycyclic aromatic cations like this one features highly deshielded protons.
# The most deshielded proton is the one in the most electron-deficient environment. In the DAOTA
# structure, this is the single proton on the central pyridine-like ring. It is part of the positively
# charged core and is located on a very electron-poor ring system.

# 3. Determination of the splitting pattern and integration
# - Splitting Pattern: This proton is on a carbon that has no protons on its adjacent carbons.
#   Since there are no vicinal protons (n=0) to couple with, its signal appears as a singlet (n+1 = 1).
# - Integration: There is only one such proton in the entire molecule. Therefore, the area under this
#   peak in the NMR spectrum corresponds to one proton (1H).

# Define the properties of the peak
splitting_pattern = "singlet"
integration = 1

# Print the final answer
print(f"The splitting pattern of the highest deshielded proton is a {splitting_pattern}.")
print(f"The integration of this peak corresponds to {integration} proton (1H).")
