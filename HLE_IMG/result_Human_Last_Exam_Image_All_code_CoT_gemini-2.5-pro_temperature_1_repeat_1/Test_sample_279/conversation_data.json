    "Based on the location of the lesion in the image, I will determine its classification according to the widely used G.V. Black's classification system for dental caries.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Analyze the provided image to identify the location of the dental lesion. The lesion (recurrent decay) is seen on the occlusal (chewing) surface of a posterior tooth, within the pits and fissures surrounding an existing restoration.\n2.  Recall G.V. Black's classification system, which categorizes carious lesions based on their anatomical location.\n3.  Write a Python script that defines G.V. Black's classes and then identifies and prints the classification corresponding to a lesion found in the \"pits and fissures on an occlusal surface.\"\n\n```python\ndef get_caries_classification(location_description):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the G.V.
