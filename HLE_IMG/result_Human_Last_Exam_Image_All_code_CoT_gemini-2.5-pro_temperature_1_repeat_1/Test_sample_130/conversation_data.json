    "The image provided shows the emission spectrum of an element. Each bright line corresponds to a specific wavelength of light emitted by the element when it is excited. By comparing this pattern of lines to the known spectra of different elements, we can identify it.\n\nThe spectrum in the image is characterized by:\n1.  Multiple lines in the blue and violet region.\n2.  A distinct line in the cyan (blue-green) region.\n3.  A very bright line in the green region.\n4.  A prominent yellow-orange line.\n5.  Several lines in the red region.\n\nThis specific pattern is the well-known signature of the element Helium. I will write a Python script to demonstrate this identification process by comparing a set of observed lines (approximated from the image) against a small database of known elemental spectra. The script will find the element with the most matching spectral lines.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef identify_element():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies an element by comparing its observed spectral lines\n    to a database of known spectra.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A database of prominent spectral lines for some elements (wavelengths in nm).\n    element_spectra = {\n        'Hydrogen': [410.2, 434.0, 486.1, 656.3],\n        'Helium': [447.1, 471.3, 492.2, 501.6, 587.6, 667.8, 706.5],\n        'Sodium': [589.0, 589.6],\n        'Mercury': [404.7, 435.8, 546.1, 577.0, 579.1]\n    }\n\n    # Prominent spectral lines observed in the image (approximated wavelengths in nm).\n    # These correspond to the characteristic lines of Helium.\n    observed_lines = [447.1, 492.2, 501.6, 587.6, 667.8]\n    \n    print(\"Observed prominent spectral lines (in nanometers):\")\n    for line in observed_lines:\n        print(line)\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    match_scores = collections.defaultdict(int)\n    tolerance = 5.0  # Allow a small tolerance for matching lines (in nm)\n\n    # Compare observed lines to the database\n    for element, known_lines in element_spectra.items():\n        score = 0\n        for obs_line in observed_lines:\n            for known_line in known_lines:\n                if abs(obs_line - known_line) <= tolerance:\n                    score += 1\n                    break  # Move to the next observed line once a match is found\n        match_scores[element] = score\n\n    # Find the element with the highest score\n    if not match_scores:\n        best_match = \"Unknown\"\n    else:\n        best_match = max(match_scores, key=match_scores.get)\n\n    print(f\"Comparing against known elements...\")\n    for element, score in match_scores.items():\n        print(f\"Match score for {element}: {score}\")\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"The element with the best match is: {best_match}\")\n\nidentify_element()\n```\n<<<Helium>>>"
