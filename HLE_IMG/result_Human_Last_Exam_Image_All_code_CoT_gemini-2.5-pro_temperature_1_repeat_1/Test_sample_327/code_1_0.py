# 1. Analysis of Graphene Nanoribbon Band Structures based on the provided plots.

# Plot 1: Characterized by a band gap at k=0, typical for a semiconducting Armchair (A) nanoribbon.
# By counting the conduction bands (E > 0), we find the width N=8.
# Since it has a gap, the band type is semiconducting (1).
p1_edge = 'A'
p1_width = 8
p1_band = 1

# Plot 2: Exhibits band crossings at the Fermi level (E=0) away from k=0 and flat edge states.
# This is the signature of a metallic Zigzag (Z) nanoribbon.
# The number of conduction bands is N=7. The band type is metallic (0).
p2_edge = 'Z'
p2_width = 7
p2_band = 0

# Plot 3: Shows bands touching at E=0 and k=0.
# This corresponds to a metallic Armchair (A) nanoribbon.
# The number of conduction bands is N=5. The band type is metallic (0).
p3_edge = 'A'
p3_width = 5
p3_band = 0

# 2. Concatenation of Classifications
# The final string is formed by concatenating the Edge, Width, and Band for each plot.
# To satisfy the prompt to "output each number in the final equation", we first display the numbers.

print(f"The numbers derived from the plots for the final classification are:")
print(f"Plot 1: Width={p1_width}, Band={p1_band}")
print(f"Plot 2: Width={p2_width}, Band={p2_band}")
print(f"Plot 3: Width={p3_width}, Band={p3_band}")

# The final "equation" is the concatenation of these properties.
final_string = f"{p1_edge}{p1_width}{p1_band}{p2_edge}{p2_width}{p2_band}{p3_edge}{p3_width}{p3_band}"
