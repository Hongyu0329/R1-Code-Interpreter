    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the expected two-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal lattice when viewed along the [110] crystallographic direction, and then match this theoretical pattern to one of the given images (A, B, C, or D).\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the FCC Structure and [110] Direction:**\n    *   An FCC unit cell has atoms at the 8 corners and on the 6 face centers.\n    *   The [110] direction points from the origin (0,0,0) along a diagonal on one of the cube's faces (e.g., the xy-face diagonal).\n\n2.  **Determine the Projected Pattern:**\n    *   When we project the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane perpendicular to the [110] viewing direction, a specific pattern emerges.\n    *   For an FCC lattice viewed along [110], the resulting pattern is a **centered rectangular lattice**.\n    *   This pattern can be visualized as atoms forming a rectangle with an additional atom in the center. Another way to think about it is like a \"running bond\" brick pattern, where atoms in each row are offset horizontally from the atoms in the rows directly above and below.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Images:**\n    *   **Image A** shows a simple rectangular grid. Atoms are aligned in both rows and columns. This is not a centered rectangular pattern.\n    *   **Image B** shows a centered square pattern. This is characteristic of a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice viewed along its [100] direction, not an FCC lattice.\n    *   **Image C** displays a pattern where rows of atoms are offset. For instance, a row with atoms at x-positions ~1 and ~9 is followed by a row with an atom at x-position ~5 (midway between 1 and 9). This arrangement perfectly matches the description of a centered rectangular lattice (\"running bond\" pattern).\n    *   **Image D** shows a dense, nearly hexagonal pattern. This pattern is characteristic of an FCC lattice viewed along the [111] direction (the close-packed direction).\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   By comparing the theoretical pattern for an FCC [110] projection with the patterns in the images, we can conclude that Image C is the correct representation.\n\nThe following Python code will print this step-by-step reasoning to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crystallography_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided images and determines which one represents\n    an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction by explaining the expected\n    projection pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"The task is to identify which pattern represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Step 1: Determine the Theoretical Projection Pattern ---\")\n    print(\"When a 3D FCC crystal lattice is projected onto a 2D plane as viewed from the [110] direction, the resulting pattern is a 'centered rectangular lattice'.\")\n    print(\"This pattern consists of repeating rectangular units of atoms, with an additional atom at the center of each rectangle.\")\n    print(\"Visually, this looks like a 'running bond' pattern, where each row of atoms is offset from the rows above and below it.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 2: Analyze the Given Images ---\")\n    print(\"A: This image shows a simple rectangular grid. It is not a centered pattern. Incorrect.\")\n    print(\"B: This image shows a centered square pattern, which is characteristic of a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) [100] view. Incorrect.\")\n    print(\"C: This image shows rows of atoms that are offset from each other, forming a clear centered rectangular pattern. This matches the theoretical FCC [110] projection. Correct.\")\n    print(\"D: This image shows a dense, hexagonal-like pattern, which is characteristic of an FCC [111] view. Incorrect.\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Step 3: Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"Based on the analysis, Image C is the only one that displays the characteristic centered rectangular pattern of an FCC structure viewed along the [110] direction.\")\n    print(\"\\nAnswer: C.\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the solution\nsolve_crystallography_problem()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
