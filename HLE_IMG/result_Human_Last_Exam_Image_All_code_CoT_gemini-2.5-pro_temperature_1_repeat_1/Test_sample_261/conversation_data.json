    "This image fragment is from the cover art of a very famous book. My plan is to identify the specific artwork and then provide the title of the book.\n\n1.  **Analyze the image:** The image shows a ghostly, white unicorn with a golden horn, running in a dark, forest-like setting. To the right is a golden, ornate frame or pillar.\n2.  **Identify the source:** This specific art style and scene are iconic. The unicorn is a key element in the plot of the first Harry Potter book. This artwork, by Mary GrandPr√©, is from the original United States cover of \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\". The unicorn is depicted to the left of the Mirror of Erised on the cover.\n3.  **Formulate the response:** I will provide a Python script that prints the name of the book as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_book_title():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the book title based on the provided cover fragment.\n    The image shows a unicorn from the cover art of the original US edition\n    of the first Harry Potter book.\n    \"\"\"\n    book_title = \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\"\n    print(f\"The title of the book is: {book_title}\")\n\nfind_book_title()\n```\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
