    "I will identify the city by analyzing the key elements of the coat of arms in the image and searching for a real-world counterpart.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** I will break down the provided image into its core heraldic components: the shield's design (colors and symbols), the crest (the crown), and the supporters (the branches).\n2.  **Identify Key Symbols:** The most distinctive features are the shield's division (blue top, gold bottom), the crescent moon on the blue field, and the black crab on the gold field.\n3.  **Formulate a Search:** I will use these key symbols to search for a matching or very similar city coat of arms. The combination of \"crab\" and \"crescent moon\" is quite unique.\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:** I will compare the search results with the image. Even if there are minor artistic differences (like the style of the crown or the specific branches), a match in the main shield design will determine the answer.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** The Python script will programmatically represent this logic by storing the features of the image and the identified city's coat of arms, printing the comparison, and stating the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coat_of_arms_mystery():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies a city with a coat of arms similar to the one provided\n    by analyzing its key heraldic elements.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze the key features from the provided image's coat of arms.\n    image_features = {\n        \"shield_top_field\": \"Blue (Azure)\",\n        \"shield_top_charge\": \"Golden Crescent Moon (Or)\",\n        \"shield_bottom_field\": \"Gold (Or)\",\n        \"shield_bottom_charge\": \"Black Crab (Sable)\",\n        \"crest\": \"Ornate Crown\",\n        \"supporters\": \"Olive branch and Oak branch\"\n    }\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Research revealed a strong match.
