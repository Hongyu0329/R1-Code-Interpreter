    Identifies the three-manifold represented by the provided Heegaard diagram.

    The analysis is based on recognizing the specific structure of the diagram:
    1.  It is a genus-3 Heegaard diagram, indicated by the three alpha-curves
        (α₁, α₂, α₃) and three beta-curves (β₁, β₂, β₃).
    2.  The diagram is built upon the 1-skeleton of a tetrahedron (the graph K₄),
        which provides a strong structural clue.
    3.  This specific configuration is a well-known representation in the field
        of 3-manifold topology.
    4.  Based on established literature and canonical examples, this Heegaard
        diagram represents the Seifert-Weber space.
