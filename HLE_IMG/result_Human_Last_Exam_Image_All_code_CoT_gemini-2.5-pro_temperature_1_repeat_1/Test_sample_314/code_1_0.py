    Solves the graphene band structure puzzle based on visual analysis.
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. Minimum t: Corresponds to the narrowest bandwidth. Plot 2 has a bandwidth of ~13 eV, while others are ~19 eV. So, min t is simulation 2.
    2. Minimum |s|: This is assigned by elimination. After assigning the other three conditions, this is left for simulation 3.
    3. Unique sign(s): Corresponds to a different type of asymmetry. Plots 1, 2, and 3 have the valence band more spread out (s > 0). Plot 4 has the conduction band more spread out (s < 0). So, unique sign(s) is simulation 4.
    4. Maximum s: Corresponds to the most extreme asymmetry. Plot 1 shows the largest asymmetry ratio at the M-point and has very steep bands, suggesting a large s value near a critical point. So, max s is simulation 1.

    The final order is the simulation index for each condition from 1 to 4.
