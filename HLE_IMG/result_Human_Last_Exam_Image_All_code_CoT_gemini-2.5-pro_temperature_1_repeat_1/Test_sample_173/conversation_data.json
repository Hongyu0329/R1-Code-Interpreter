    "To determine the time signature of the musical measure, we need to sum the durations of the notes within it. A time signature tells us two things: the top number indicates how many beats are in a measure, and the bottom number indicates what kind of note gets one beat (e.g., 4 for a quarter note, 8 for an eighth note).\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  **Analyze the notes in the top staff (treble clef):** This staff contains the most rhythmic activity, making it ideal for counting.\n2.  **Identify the note values:** The notes are predominantly sixteenth notes (indicated by two flags or beams). There is also one sixteenth rest.\n3.  **Count the total duration:** I will count the total number of sixteenth notes (or their equivalent duration) in the measure.\n4.  **Convert to a standard beat:** The notes are clearly grouped into four sets, suggesting four main beats. I will calculate how many quarter notes the total duration is equivalent to, as the quarter note is the most common beat unit.\n5.  **Determine the time signature:** The result of the calculation will give the top number (number of beats) and the bottom number (the beat unit) of the time signature. The code will perform and display this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_time_signature():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the time signature by analyzing the note durations in the provided musical measure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Note durations are counted in terms of sixteenth notes, as they are the smallest unit present.\n    \n    # The top staff is divided into four main beats.
