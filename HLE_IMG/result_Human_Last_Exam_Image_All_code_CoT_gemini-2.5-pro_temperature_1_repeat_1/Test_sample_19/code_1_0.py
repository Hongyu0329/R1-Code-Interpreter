    # Part 1: Identify the key of modulation.

    # Part 2: Explain the connection and justification.
    part2_answer = ("2. The original key of the piece is C# minor (established by the 4-sharp key signature and opening measures). "
                    "The new key, B minor, is built on the subtonic (the note a whole step below the tonic). "
                    "This is a distant key relationship used for its powerful dramatic and coloristic effect. "
                    "Beethoven justifies this distant modulation through a sophisticated harmonic progression that makes it feel logical and intentional.")

    # Part 3: Provide the Roman numeral marking.
    part3_answer = ("3. The chord on the first beat of measure 11 is a G dominant 7th (G7). "
                    "This chord functions as a secondary dominant to the Neapolitan chord of the new key (B minor). "
                    "The Neapolitan in B minor is C major. The G7 is the V7 of C. "
                    "Therefore, the complete and accurate Roman numeral marking is V7/N (five-seven of Neapolitan).")

                    "2. The new key, B minor, is the subtonic of the original key, C# minor. This distant modulation is used for dramatic effect and is justified by the sophisticated harmonic preparation. "
