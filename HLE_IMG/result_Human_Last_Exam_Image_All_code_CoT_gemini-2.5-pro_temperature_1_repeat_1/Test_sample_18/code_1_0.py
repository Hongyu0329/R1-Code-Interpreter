    This function prints the solution to the chess puzzle.
    
    The analysis reveals that the hidden White King could be on several squares.
    However, for the king positions d4 or g5, the move 1... Nf3+ is checkmate.
    
    - If WK is on d4, 1...Nf3# is mate.
    - If WK is on g5, 1...Nf3# is mate.
    
    Retrograde analysis points to a complex sequence of moves involving an en passant capture,
    which strongly suggests the central action is key. The move Nf3 is a central strike.
    
    The problem asks for the mate in the fewest moves, which is a mate in 1.
    The move is Knight to f3.
