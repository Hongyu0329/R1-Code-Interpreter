# Step 1: Define the radius of the yellow circle (ry)
# Based on the prompt, a yellow circle has its center at y=0.5 and touches the bottom edge (y=0).
ry = 0.5
print(f"The radius of a yellow circle (ry) is given as {ry} cm.")

# Step 2: Calculate the radius of the white circle (Rw)
# The geometric relationship between a small circle (ry) nestled between two large circles (Rw)
# gives the equation: (Rw + ry)^2 = Rw^2 + (Rw - ry)^2
# Expanding this: Rw^2 + 2*Rw*ry + ry^2 = Rw^2 + Rw^2 - 2*Rw*ry + ry^2
# Simplifying: 4*Rw*ry = Rw^2
# Since Rw is not zero, we can divide by Rw: Rw = 4*ry
Rw = 4 * ry
print("The radius of a white circle (Rw) is derived from the formula: Rw = 4 * ry")
print(f"Rw = 4 * {ry} = {Rw} cm.")

# Two circles are tangent (no gap) if the distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii.
sum_of_radii_yw = Rw + ry
print(f"The sum of the radii of a yellow and a white circle is: {Rw} + {ry} = {sum_of_radii_yw} cm.")
# The calculation in Step 2 is based on the fact that these circles are tangent.
# This means the distance between their centers must be equal to the sum of their radii.
# We can verify this.
# distance^2 = Rw^2 + (Rw - ry)^2
distance_sq_yw = Rw**2 + (Rw - ry)**2
distance_yw = math.sqrt(distance_sq_yw)
print(f"The distance between their centers is calculated by sqrt(Rw^2 + (Rw - ry)^2).")
print(f"Distance = sqrt({Rw}^2 + ({Rw} - {ry})^2) = sqrt({Rw**2} + {(Rw-ry)**2}) = {distance_yw} cm.")
print(f"Since the distance ({distance_yw:.1f} cm) is equal to the sum of radii ({sum_of_radii_yw} cm), there is no gap.")

# --- Question 2: Is there any gap between white circles in the first row and second row? ---
print("\n--- Answering Question 2 ---")
# The sum of the radii for two white circles is Rw + Rw.
sum_of_radii_ww = Rw + Rw
print(f"The sum of the radii of two white circles is: {Rw} + {Rw} = {sum_of_radii_ww} cm.")
# For adjacent rows, the horizontal distance between centers is Rw.
# The vertical distance is derived from the tangency condition: (2*Rw)^2 = Rw^2 + (vertical_dist)^2
# vertical_dist = sqrt(3 * Rw^2) = Rw * sqrt(3)
# The distance between centers is thus sqrt(Rw^2 + (Rw*sqrt(3))^2)
distance_ww = math.sqrt(Rw**2 + (Rw * math.sqrt(3))**2)
print("The distance between the centers of two tangent white circles in adjacent rows is calculated.")
print(f"Distance = sqrt(Rw^2 + (Rw * sqrt(3))^2) = sqrt({Rw**2} + {3*Rw**2}) = sqrt({4*Rw**2}) = {distance_ww} cm.")
