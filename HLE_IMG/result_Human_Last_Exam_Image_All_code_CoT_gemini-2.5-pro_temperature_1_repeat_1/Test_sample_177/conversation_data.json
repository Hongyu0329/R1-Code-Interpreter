    "To calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the total Car VMT for the Baseline scenario.** For each distance category, we'll calculate a weighted VMT. The formula is:\n    `VMT_category = (Share of Total Trips) * (Total Car Mode Share) * (Average Trip Distance)`\n    The total Car Mode Share is the sum of the shares for \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\". We will sum the VMT for all distance categories to get the total Baseline VMT.\n\n2.  **Calculate the total Car VMT for the Proposed scenario.** We will use the same formula as in step 1, but with the mode share data from the \"Proposed\" table.\n\n3.  **Calculate the percentage reduction.** The formula is:\n    `Percentage Reduction = ((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100`\n\nThe number of occupants in the car does not affect the Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), so we will not use the \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" data.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_vmt_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage reduction in Car VMT based on the provided tables.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data from the tables\n    # Common data for both scenarios\n    share_of_total_trips = [0.48, 0.22, 0.14, 0.16]\n    avg_trip_distance = [1, 4, 7.5, 20]\n    distance_bins = [\"0-3 miles\", \"3-5 miles\", \"5-10 miles\", \"10+ miles\"]\n\n    # Baseline Scenario Data (Table 1)\n    car_1_occupant_base = [0.25, 0.38, 0.40, 0.42]\n    car_multi_occupant_base = [0.28, 0.43, 0.45, 0.47]\n\n    # Proposed Scenario Data (Table 2)\n    car_1_occupant_prop = [0.01, 0.08, 0.14, 0.16]\n    car_multi_occupant_prop = [0.02, 0.19, 0.27, 0.33]\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate Baseline Car VMT ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate Baseline Car VMT\")\n    print(\"VMT is calculated for each distance category using the formula:\")\n    print(\"VMT_category = (Share of Trips) * (Car, 1 occ Share + Car, >2 occ Share) * (Avg Distance)\")\n    \n    baseline_vmt_components = []\n    total_baseline_vmt = 0\n    \n    print(\"\\nBaseline VMT Calculation:\")\n    calculation_str_base = \"Baseline VMT = \"\n    \n    for i in range(len(distance_bins)):\n        total_car_share = car_1_occupant_base[i] + car_multi_occupant_base[i]\n        vmt_component = share_of_total_trips[i] * total_car_share * avg_trip_distance[i]\n        baseline_vmt_components.append(vmt_component)\n        total_baseline_vmt += vmt_component\n        \n        calculation_str_base += f\"({share_of_total_trips[i]} * ({car_1_occupant_base[i]} + {car_multi_occupant_base[i]}) * {avg_trip_distance[i]})\"\n        if i < len(distance_bins) - 1:\n            calculation_str_base += \" + \"\n            \n    print(calculation_str_base)\n    \n    component_str_base = \"Baseline VMT = \" + \" + \".join([f\"{comp:.4f}\" for comp in baseline_vmt_components])\n    print(component_str_base)\n    \n    print(f\"Total Baseline VMT = {total_baseline_vmt:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate Proposed Car VMT ---\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate Proposed Car VMT\")\n    proposed_vmt_components = []\n    total_proposed_vmt = 0\n    \n    print(\"\\nProposed VMT Calculation:\")\n    calculation_str_prop = \"Proposed VMT = \"\n    \n    for i in range(len(distance_bins)):\n        total_car_share = car_1_occupant_prop[i] + car_multi_occupant_prop[i]\n        vmt_component = share_of_total_trips[i] * total_car_share * avg_trip_distance[i]\n        proposed_vmt_components.append(vmt_component)\n        total_proposed_vmt += vmt_component\n        \n        calculation_str_prop += f\"({share_of_total_trips[i]} * ({car_1_occupant_prop[i]} + {car_multi_occupant_prop[i]}) * {avg_trip_distance[i]})\"\n        if i < len(distance_bins) - 1:\n            calculation_str_prop += \" + \"\n            \n    print(calculation_str_prop)\n    \n    component_str_prop = \"Proposed VMT = \" + \" + \".join([f\"{comp:.4f}\" for comp in proposed_vmt_components])\n    print(component_str_prop)\n    \n    print(f\"Total Proposed VMT = {total_proposed_vmt:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate Percentage Reduction ---\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction\")\n    print(\"Reduction % = ((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100\")\n    \n    vmt_reduction = total_baseline_vmt - total_proposed_vmt\n    percentage_reduction = (vmt_reduction / total_baseline_vmt) * 100\n    \n    print(f\"Reduction % = (({total_baseline_vmt:.4f} - {total_proposed_vmt:.4f}) / {total_baseline_vmt:.4f}) * 100\")\n    print(f\"Reduction % = ({vmt_reduction:.4f} / {total_baseline_vmt:.4f}) * 100\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Percentage Reduction in Car VMT: {percentage_reduction:.1f}%\")\n    \n    return percentage_reduction\n\n# Run the calculation\nfinal_answer = calculate_vmt_reduction()\n# The final answer is wrapped for the system to extract.\n# print(f\"\\n<<<>>>\\n{final_answer:.1f}\\n<<<>>>\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    pass\n\n```\n<<<52.2>>>"
