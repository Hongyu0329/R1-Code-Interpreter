    "Based on the distinctive architecture of the buildings visible in the image, particularly the wavy facade of the GT Tower East on the right, the city can be identified. This and the other surrounding buildings are located in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to output this answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_city_identification():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the city from the provided image.\n  \n  Analysis of the image:\n  1. The image displays a modern city skyline with several distinctive skyscrapers.\n  2. The building on the right with the undulating glass facade is identifiable as the GT Tower East.\n  3.
