1.  **Mountain Formation:** The tallest and most extensive mountain ranges on Earth (like the Himalayas) are formed at convergent boundaries where two continental plates collide. This process creates immense compressional forces, leading to the folding and uplifting of the crust over a vast area.

2.  **Map Analysis:** The map uses specific symbols:
    *   Red lines with arrows pointing inward indicate a **convergent boundary**, the site of mountain building.
    *   The light-brown landmasses represent **continental plates**.

3.  **Evaluating the Options:** We need to find the longest red line that separates two continental plates.
    *   The boundary between the **Artemian Plate** and the **Eurybian Plate** is a long, continuous convergent boundary (red line).
    *   Both the Artemian Plate and the Eurybian Plate are large continental landmasses.
    *   This continent-continent collision is the ideal scenario for producing the longest range of the tallest mountains. Other options either involve oceanic plates, are divergent/transform boundaries, or represent shorter collision zones.

4.  **Conclusion:** The plate boundary between the Artemian Plate and the Eurybian Plate is the most likely location for the planet's most significant mountain range.
