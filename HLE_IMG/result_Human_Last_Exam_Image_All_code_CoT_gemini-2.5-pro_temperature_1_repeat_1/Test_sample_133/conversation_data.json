    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided electron ionization mass spectrum.\n\n**1. Identify the Molecular Ion (M+) and Elemental Composition:**\n*   The group of peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) appears to be the molecular ion cluster. We see significant peaks at m/z 260, 262, 264, and 266.\n*   The pattern of these peaks suggests the presence of chlorine atoms due to their natural isotopes (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl in a ~3:1 ratio).\n*   Let's test the hypothesis that the compound contains two chlorine atoms (Cl₂). The expected isotopic pattern for a species with two chlorines is M:(M+2):(M+4) in an intensity ratio of approximately 9:6:1.\n*   Looking at the peaks at **m/z 262, 264, and 266**, their intensities are 29.0, 12.9, and 3.22, respectively. The ratio is `29.0 : 12.9 : 3.22`. Normalizing to the smallest peak gives `(29.0/3.22) : (12.9/3.22) : 1`, which is approximately **9.0 : 4.0 : 1**. This is a reasonable match for a compound containing two chlorine atoms, with m/z 262 being the M+ peak (containing two ³⁵Cl atoms).\n\n**2. Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n*   The mass of the M+ ion is 262 u.\n*   The mass of two ³⁵Cl atoms is 2 * 35 = 70 u.\n*   The mass of the rest of the molecule (the CₓHᵧ part) is 262 - 70 = 192 u.\n*   Using the \"Rule of 13\" or by looking for plausible aromatic structures, a hydrocarbon fragment with a mass of 192 is likely **C₁₅H₁₂** (15 * 12 + 12 * 1 = 192).\n*   Therefore, the most probable molecular formula is **C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Fragmentation Pattern:**\n*   **Base Peak (100% intensity):** m/z 225.\n*   **[M-Cl]⁺ Fragment:** A peak at m/z 227 is observed. The mass difference from the molecular ion is 262 - 227 = 35 u, which corresponds to the loss of a ³⁵Cl radical. This fragment, `[C₁₅H₁₂Cl]⁺`, shows the expected isotope peak at m/z 229 (for ³⁷Cl) with an intensity ratio of 66.7:22.2, which is almost exactly 3:1. This confirms the presence of one chlorine atom in this fragment.\n*   **Formation of the Base Peak:** The base peak at m/z 225 is 2 u less than the [M-Cl]⁺ fragment at m/z 227. This indicates a loss of a hydrogen molecule (H₂), a common fragmentation pathway that leads to a more stable, conjugated, or aromatic ion. So, the base peak is `[M-Cl-H₂]⁺`.\n*   **Other Fragments:** The significant peak at m/z 190 can be explained by the loss of the second chlorine atom from the base peak: 225 - 35 = 190. This corresponds to the `[C₁₅H₁₀]⁺` ion.\n\n**4. Propose the Structure and IUPAC Name:**\nThe molecular formula is C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂. The fragmentation is consistent with a structure that can readily lose a chlorine atom, followed by H₂, to form a stable cation. While several isomers are possible, a plausible structure that fits the formula and is related to known cyclic compounds is a dichlorinated diphenylcyclopropane.\n\n*   **Structure:** 1,1-dichloro-2,3-diphenylcyclopropane\n*   **Formula:** C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂ (Matches our deduction)\n*   **IUPAC Name:** 1,1-dichloro-2,3-diphenylcyclopropane\n\n```python\ndef solve_mass_spectrometry_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script formalizes the step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to deduce the compound's identity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
