    "Of course, I can help with this organic chemistry problem.\n\n### **Analysis of the Reaction**\n\nThis reaction is a well-known multi-component reaction called the **Joullié-Ugi three-component reaction**. It involves the condensation of an aldehyde (or in this case, a dialdehyde), a primary amine, and a cyanide source to form a complex heterocyclic product.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the plausible reaction mechanism:\n\n1.  **Imine Formation:** The primary amine, 2-aminopyridine, reacts with one of the aldehyde groups of o-phthalaldehyde to form a Schiff base (an imine). This step releases one molecule of water.\n    `2-aminopyridine + o-phthalaldehyde → intermediate imine-aldehyde + H₂O`\n\n2.  **Cyanide Addition (Strecker Reaction step):** The trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN), activated by potassium fluoride (KF), acts as a source for the cyanide ion (CN⁻). The cyanide ion is a potent nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of the imine bond. This forms an α-aminonitrile intermediate.\n    `intermediate imine-aldehyde + HCN → intermediate α-aminonitrile-aldehyde`\n    *(Note: For atom-balancing, we consider the net addition of HCN from TMSCN/H₂O)*\n\n3.  **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The nitrogen atom of the newly formed secondary amine group in the intermediate attacks the remaining aldehyde group on the benzene ring. This forms a five-membered ring, resulting in a hydroxylated isoindoline derivative (a carbinolamine).\n\n4.  **Dehydration:** The carbinolamine intermediate is unstable and readily undergoes dehydration (loses a second molecule of water) to form a stable, conjugated final product.\n\n### **Identifying Compound A**\n\nFollowing this mechanism, the final product, **Compound A**, is **2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-isoindole-3-carbonitrile**.\n\nThe net chemical equation for the formation of product A is:\n`C₅H₆N₂` (2-aminopyridine) + `C₈H₆O₂` (o-phthalaldehyde) + `HCN` (from TMSCN) → `C₁₄H₉N₃` (Compound A) + `2 H₂O`\n\nI will now provide a Python script that uses the RDKit library to verify the molecular formula and calculate the molecular weight of Compound A.\n\n```python\n# First, ensure you have RDKit installed:\n# pip install rdkit\n\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem import Descriptors, Draw\n\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies Compound A from the described reaction,\n    calculates its properties, and prints the information.\n    \"\"\"\n    # SMILES string for the final product, Compound A: 2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-isoindole-3-carbonitrile\n    # This structure is derived from the Joullié-Ugi three-component reaction mechanism.\n    product_smiles = \"n1ccccc1N1C=C(C#N)c2c1cccc2\"\n    \n    # Create a molecule object from the SMILES string\n    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(product_smiles)\n\n    if mol:\n        # Calculate molecular formula and molecular weight\n        mol_formula = Descriptors.rdMolDescriptors.CalcMolFormula(mol)\n        mol_weight = Descriptors.MolWt(mol)\n\n        print(\"--- Analysis of Compound A ---\")\n        print(f\"Product Name: 2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-isoindole-3-carbonitrile\")\n        print(f\"Molecular Formula: {mol_formula}\")\n        print(f\"Molecular Weight: {mol_weight:.4f} g/mol\")\n        print(\"\\n--- Net Reaction Equation ---\")\n        \n        # The equation shows the main organic components and stoichiometry\n        # Reactants: 1 (2-aminopyridine) + 1 (o-phthalaldehyde) + 1 (HCN source)\n        # Products: 1 (Compound A) + 2 (Water)\n        equation = \"1 C5H6N2 + 1 C8H6O2 + 1 HCN -> 1 C14H9N3 + 2 H2O\"\n        print(equation)\n        print(\"\\nNote: The equation is balanced for atoms contributing to the final structure, with HCN representing the cyanide source and water as the byproduct.\")\n\n    else:\n        print(\"Error: Could not generate molecule from SMILES string.\")\n\n# Execute the function\nsolve_reaction()\n\n```\n<<<2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-isoindole-3-carbonitrile>>>"
