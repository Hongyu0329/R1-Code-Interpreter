    This function solves the puzzle by identifying the crater, its namesake,

    # Step 1 & 2: Identify the crater and its namesake.
    # The image shows a portion of the Goclenius crater on the Moon.
    # This crater is named after Rudolph Goclenius the Elder.
    crater_name = "Goclenius"
    namesake = "Rudolph Goclenius the Elder"

    # Step 3: Determine the etymological origin of a key term associated with the namesake.
    # Rudolph Goclenius is credited with coining the term "psychology" in 1590.
    # The word "psychology" is derived from two Greek words:
    # - "psyche" (ψυχή), which means "mind" or "soul".
    # - "-logia" (-λογία), which means "study of".
    # This gives us the phrase "Study of Mind", which fits the "X of Y" format.
    coined_term = "psychology"
    x_of_y_phrase = "Study of Mind"
    X = "Study"
    Y = "Mind"

    # Step 4: Connect the "X of Y" phrase to Carl Sagan's statement.
    # Carl Sagan famously reflected on the "Pale Blue Dot" image of Earth. He argued that
    # this perspective was the most important lesson for humanity. It forces us to reconsider
    # our place in the cosmos, fostering a sense of unity and responsibility.
    # This profound shift in consciousness is, effectively, a "Study of Mind" on a planetary scale.
    # Sagan believed this new perspective, this particular "Study of Mind," was essential for our survival.
