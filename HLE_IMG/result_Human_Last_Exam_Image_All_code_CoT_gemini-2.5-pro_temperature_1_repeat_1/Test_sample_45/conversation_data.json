    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define Rotational Symmetry:** First, I'll clarify what rotational symmetry means. A pattern has n-fold rotational symmetry if it looks identical after being rotated by an angle of 360/n degrees. The goal is to find the highest value of 'n' for which this is true.\n2.  **Identify a Center of Rotation:** I will examine the tiling to find a point around which the entire pattern can be rotated. A good candidate is the center of one of the prominent shapes, like the dark blue hexagons.\n3.  **Determine the Order of Symmetry:** By observing the arrangement of tiles around this central point, I can count how many times the pattern repeats in a full 360-degree rotation. This count will be the order of symmetry, 'n'.\n4.  **Create a Python Script:** I will write a Python script that explains this logic step-by-step, performs the relevant calculation, and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_rotational_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the logic for finding the rotational symmetry of the tiling\n    and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding Rotational Symmetry\")\n    print(\"A tiling has n-fold rotational symmetry if it remains unchanged after a rotation of 360/n degrees around a central point.\")\n    print(\"We need to find the highest possible integer 'n' > 1 for the given pattern.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the Tiling Pattern\")\n    print(\"Let's choose the center of one of the dark blue hexagons as our point of rotation.\")\n    print(\"By observing the pattern, we can see that each blue hexagon is surrounded by a ring of 6 yellow pentagons.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Determining the Order of Symmetry\")\n    print(\"This structure of 6 identical shapes arranged symmetrically around a central point indicates that the pattern will look the same after being rotated 6 times within a full 360-degree turn.\")\n    order_n = 6\n    print(f\"The number of repeating units around the center is {order_n}. Therefore, the order of rotational symmetry is {order_n}.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Calculating the Angle of Rotation\")\n    total_degrees = 360\n    angle = total_degrees / order_n\n    print(f\"The smallest angle of rotation that leaves the pattern unchanged can be calculated.\")\n    print(f\"The equation is: {total_degrees} / {order_n} = {int(angle)}\")\n    print(f\"This confirms a {order_n}-fold rotational symmetry.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Final Answer:\")\n    print(\"The rotational symmetry of the tiling is:\")\n    print(order_n)\n\nfind_rotational_symmetry()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
