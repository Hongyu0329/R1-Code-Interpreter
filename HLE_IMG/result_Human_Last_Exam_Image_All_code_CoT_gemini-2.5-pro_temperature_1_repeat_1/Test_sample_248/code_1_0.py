    This function identifies the species that indicates the photo was taken on the Atlantic coast.
    The image contains several marine invertebrates, including barnacles and snails.
    One of the most identifiable snails is the Common Periwinkle, which has a distinct striped shell.
    The scientific name for the Common Periwinkle is Littorina littorea.
    This species is native to the northeastern Atlantic and is very common along the Atlantic coast of North America.
    Crucially, it is not found on the Pacific coast of North America.
    Therefore, its presence definitively places the location on an Atlantic shoreline.
