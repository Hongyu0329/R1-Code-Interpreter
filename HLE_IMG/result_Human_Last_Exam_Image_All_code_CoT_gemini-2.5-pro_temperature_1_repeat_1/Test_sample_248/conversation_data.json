    "My plan is to identify the different species of marine invertebrates visible in the image. Then, I will research the geographic distribution of these species to determine which one is found exclusively on the Atlantic coast and not the Pacific coast. The most prominent and identifiable organisms are barnacles and several species of sea snails (periwinkles/whelks). By comparing their known habitats, I can pinpoint the species that serves as a geographic indicator. The snail with the brown stripes is a Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*. This species is abundant on the Atlantic coasts of North America and Europe but is not established on the Pacific coast of North America. Its presence is therefore a definitive clue.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the species that indicates the photo was taken on the Atlantic coast.\n    The image contains several marine invertebrates, including barnacles and snails.\n    One of the most identifiable snails is the Common Periwinkle, which has a distinct striped shell.\n    The scientific name for the Common Periwinkle is Littorina littorea.\n    This species is native to the northeastern Atlantic and is very common along the Atlantic coast of North America.\n    Crucially, it is not found on the Pacific coast of North America.\n    Therefore, its presence definitively places the location on an Atlantic shoreline.\n    \"\"\"\n    scientific_name = \"Littorina littorea\"\n    print(f\"The scientific name of the species that definitively indicates this photo was taken on the Atlantic coast is: {scientific_name}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
