    "This is a fascinating historical puzzle based on search trends. To solve this, I will analyze the timing of the annual peaks for each of the three lines in the Google Trends graph and correlate them with major national holidays or historical commemorations of a single country.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Peaks:** I will examine the graph to determine the approximate month each of the three colored lines (red, yellow, blue) peaks each year.\n2.  **Formulate Hypothesis:** Based on the timing of these peaks, I'll hypothesize which historical events they represent.\n3.  **Identify Country:** I will find the country for which all three hypothesized events are significant national commemorations.\n4.  **Code the Solution:** I will write a Python script that outlines this reasoning and prints the conclusion, including the key dates (the numbers) as requested.\n\nThe annual peaks appear to correspond to:\n*   **Blue Line:** Early May\n*   **Yellow Line:** Mid-July\n*   **Red Line:** Mid-November\n\nThese dates strongly suggest the following French historical events:\n*   **Blue (May 8):** Victory in Europe Day (V-E Day)\n*   **Yellow (July 14):** Bastille Day, the national day of France.\n*   **Red (November 11):** Armistice Day of 1918.\n\nAll three are major public holidays in France. The Python code below will formalize this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_historical_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the recurring peaks in the provided Google Trends graph to identify\n    three major historical events and the country they belong to.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: The recurring annual peaks in the graph correspond to specific dates.\n    # The blue line peaks in early May, the yellow line in mid-July, and the red line in mid-November.\n\n    # Step 2: These dates are matched to significant historical events of a single country.\n    event_blue = \"Victory in Europe Day\"\n    day_blue = 8\n    month_blue = \"May\"\n    \n    event_yellow = \"Bastille Day\"\n    day_yellow = 14\n    month_yellow = \"July\"\n    \n    event_red = \"Armistice Day of 1918\"\n    day_red = 11\n    month_red = \"November\"\n    \n    # Step 3: All three events are major national holidays in France.\n    country = \"France\"\n    \n    print(\"The analysis reveals the search trends for three major historical events:\")\n    print(f\"1.
