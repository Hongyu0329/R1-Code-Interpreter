    "To find the total current flowing from the voltage source, we first need to calculate the total equivalent resistance of the circuit.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Circuit Structure:**\n    The circuit can be simplified by identifying components that are in series and parallel.\n    *   Resistors `R1`, `R2`, and `R8` are in parallel with each other. A wire connects the top of all three resistors to the positive terminal of the source (let's call this Node A). The bottom of `R1` and `R2` connect to a common node (Node B), and the bottom of `R8` connects to another node (Node D). A wire connects Node B and Node D, making them a single node. Therefore, `R1`, `R2`, and `R8` are all connected between Node A and Node B/D, which means they are in parallel.\n    *   This parallel combination (`R1 || R2 || R8`) is in series with `R7`. This forms one major branch of the circuit (`Branch 1`).\n    *   Resistor `R3` is connected directly across the voltage source, as one end is connected to the positive terminal and the other to the negative terminal (ground). This forms a second major branch (`Branch 2`).\n    *   The two major branches (`Branch 1` and `Branch 2`) are in parallel with each other across the voltage source `V2`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Equivalent Resistances:**\n    *   Calculate the equivalent resistance of the parallel combination of `R1`, `R2`, and `R8`. Let's call it `R_p128`.\n        `R_p128 = 1 / (1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R8)`\n    *   Calculate the total resistance of `Branch 1` by adding `R7` to `R_p128`.\n        `R_branch1 = R_p128 + R7`\n    *   The resistance of `Branch 2` is simply `R3`.\n        `R_branch2 = R3`\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Current:**\n    *   The total current `I_total` is the sum of the currents flowing through the two parallel branches.\n    *   Current in `Branch 1`: `I_1 = V2 / R_branch1`\n    *   Current in `Branch 2`: `I_2 = V2 / R_branch2`\n    *   Total Current: `I_total = I_1 + I_2`\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values from the circuit diagram\nV2 = 1.0  # Voltage in Volts\nR1 = 3.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR2 = 7.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR3 = 9.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR7 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms\nR8 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the equivalent resistance of the parallel R1, R2, R8 combination\n# R_p128 = 1 / (1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R8)\nR_p128 = 1 / (1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R8)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total resistance of the first major branch\n# This branch has the R_p128 combination in series with R7\nR_branch1 = R_p128 + R7\n\n# The second major branch is just R3\nR_branch2 = R3\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the current in each branch\nI_1 = V2 / R_branch1\nI_2 = V2 / R_branch2\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the total current by summing the currents from the parallel branches\nI_total = I_1 + I_2\n\n# Print the final equation with all the numbers\nprint(\"The total current is the sum of currents in the two main parallel branches:\")\nprint(f\"I_total = I_branch1 + I_branch2\")\nprint(f\"I_total = (V2 / R_branch1) + (V2 / R_branch2)\")\nprint(f\"R_branch1 = (1 / (1/{R1} + 1/{R2} + 1/{R8})) + {R7} = {R_branch1:.4f} Ohms\")\nprint(f\"R_branch2 = {R3} Ohms\")\nprint(f\"I_total = ({V2} V / {R_branch1:.4f} Ohm) + ({V2} V / {R_branch2:.4f} Ohm)\")\nprint(f\"I_total = {I_1:.4f} A + {I_2:.4f} A\")\nprint(f\"I_total = {I_total:.4f} A\")\n\n# <<<0.1209>>>\n```"
