    This function explains and calculates the number of non-isomorphic cycle
    double covers of the Petersen graph based on known mathematical results.

    A cycle double cover of a graph is a collection of cycles where each edge
    of the graph is included in exactly two cycles. The Petersen graph has 15 edges,
    so the sum of the lengths of all cycles in a cover must be 2 * 15 = 30.

    The non-isomorphic cycle double covers of the Petersen graph are known to
    fall into two distinct categories.
