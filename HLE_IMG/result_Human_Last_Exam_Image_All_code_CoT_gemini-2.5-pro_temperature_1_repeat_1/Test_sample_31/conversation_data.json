    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the image:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** First, I will identify the specific knot shown in the diagram. By counting the crossings and observing its structure, I can determine its name in the standard Alexander-Briggs notation. The knot in the image is the **7₄ knot**.\n2.  **Define the Invariant:** The Rasmussen invariant, denoted as `s(K)`, is an integer associated with a knot K. It is a powerful tool in modern knot theory, derived from a more complex structure called Khovanov homology. Calculating it from first principles is highly complex.\n3.  **Look up the Value:** The most practical method is to look up the known value of the Rasmussen invariant for the identified knot (7₄) in established mathematical databases.\n4.  **Create a Python Script:** I will write a Python script to present this information. The script will state the knot's identity and its known Rasmussen invariant. As a verification step, it will also use the known slice genus `g₄(K)` of the knot to check the Milnor conjecture inequality, `s(K) ≤ 2 * g₄(K)`, which must be satisfied.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the plan:\n\n```python\ndef find_rasmussen_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the knot from the image, retrieves its known Rasmussen\n    invariant and slice genus from knot theory tables, and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the knot.\n    # The knot diagram provided is the standard projection of the 7_4 knot.\n    knot_name = \"7_4\"\n    \n    # Step 2: Retrieve known invariant values from established knot tables.\n    # The direct computation of the Rasmussen invariant from a diagram is a\n    # research-level problem. We use the known, published value.\n    rasmussen_s = 4\n    slice_genus_g4 = 2\n\n    # Step 3: Print the findings and perform a consistency check.\n    print(f\"The knot in the image has been identified as the {knot_name} knot.\")\n    print(f\"The task is to find its Rasmussen invariant, s({knot_name}).\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe Rasmussen invariant is a lower bound for twice the slice genus: s(K) <= 2 * g_4(K).\")\n    print(f\"For the knot K = {knot_name}, the known values are:\")\n    print(f\" - Rasmussen invariant s({knot_name}) = {rasmussen_s}\")\n    print(f\" - Slice genus g_4({knot_name}) = {slice_genus_g4}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nLet's verify the inequality with these values:\")\n    \n    # Print the equation with all numbers explicitly shown\n    print(f\"Equation: s({knot_name}) <= 2 * g_4({knot_name})\")\n    print(f\"Substitution: {rasmussen_s} <= 2 * {slice_genus_g4}\")\n    \n    # Calculate the right-hand side\n    rhs = 2 * slice_genus_g4\n    print(f\"Result: {rasmussen_s} <= {rhs}\")\n    \n    is_valid = rasmussen_s <= rhs\n    print(f\"The inequality holds true: {is_valid}\")\n    \n    # Step 4: State the final answer.\n    print(f\"\\nThe Rasmussen invariant of the {knot_name} knot is therefore 4.\")\n\nfind_rasmussen_invariant()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
