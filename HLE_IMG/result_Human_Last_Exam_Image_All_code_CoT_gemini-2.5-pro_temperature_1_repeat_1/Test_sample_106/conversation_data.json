    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this organic chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The provided reaction is the acid-catalyzed dehydration of a polycyclic alcohol, specifically a triterpenoid known as friedelan-3-ol. The acidic conditions (cat. HCl) and heat promote the loss of a water molecule and subsequent rearrangement of the carbon skeleton.\n2.  **Identify the Mechanism:** This type of transformation in triterpenoids is a classic example of a \"backbone rearrangement,\" which involves a cascade of [1,2]-hydride (H⁻) and [1,2]-methyl (CH₃⁻) shifts, also known as a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement. The driving force is the formation of a more thermodynamically stable product.\n3.  **Trace the Rearrangement:** I will trace the step-by-step migration of hydrogen atoms and methyl groups starting from the initial carbocation formed at carbon 3 (after the -OH group leaves as water). The well-established sequence for the Friedelane -> Oleanane rearrangement is:\n    *   A methyl group shifts from C4 to C3.\n    *   A hydride shifts from C5 to C4.\n    *   A methyl group shifts from C10 to C5.\n    *   A hydride shifts from C9 to C10.\n    *   A methyl group shifts from C8 to C9.\n    *   A methyl group shifts from C14 to C8.\n    *   A hydride shifts from C13 to C14.\n    *   Finally, a proton is eliminated to form the double bond.\n4.  **Determine Final Substituents:** By tracking what group moves out of and what group moves into each relevant carbon atom (positions 1-5 in the product), I will determine the final substituent (H or CH3) at each position.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script to store these findings and print the final answer in the requested format: `1 = V, 2 = W, 3 = X, 4 = Y, 5 = Z`.\n\nHere is the Python code to display the solution:\n```python\ndef solve_rearrangement():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the substituents at positions 1-5 in the product\n    of the Friedelane-Oleanane rearrangement.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Based on tracing the [1,2] shifts in the backbone rearrangement:\n    # Position 1 (at C4): Started with two CH3 groups. One migrated. One remains.\n    # Position 2 (at C10): Started with one CH3. It migrated away. An H migrated in.\n    # Position 3 (at C9): Started with one H. It migrated away. A CH3 migrated in.\n    # Position 4 (at C8): Started with one CH3. It migrated away. Another CH3 migrated in.\n    # Position 5 (at C14): Started with one CH3. It migrated away. An H migrated in.\n    \n    substituents = {\n        1: \"CH3\",\n        2: \"H\",\n        3: \"CH3\",\n        4: \"CH3\",\n        5: \"H\"\n    }\n\n    # Format the output string as requested\n    output_parts = []\n    for position in sorted(substituents.keys()):\n        substituent = substituents[position]\n        output_parts.append(f\"{position} = {substituent}\")\n\n    final_answer = \", \".join(output_parts)\n    print(final_answer)\n\nsolve_rearrangement()\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
