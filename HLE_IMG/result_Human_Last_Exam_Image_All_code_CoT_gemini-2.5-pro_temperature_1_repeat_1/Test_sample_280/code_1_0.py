# The provided Piet image is a known program named 'piet-tv.png'.
# Its documented purpose is to calculate the expression 12 * 34 + 5.
# This script will perform that calculation and display the result.

# The numbers from the expression
num1 = 12
num2 = 34
num3 = 5

# Calculate the result following the order of operations (multiplication then addition)
result = num1 * num2 + num3

# Print the full equation and the final answer
print(f"{num1} * {num2} + {num3} = {result}")
