    "This is a mate-in-2 chess puzzle. My goal is to find the sequence of two moves for Black that results in a checkmate, regardless of White's response, with the constraint that Black's queens cannot be moved.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the initial position**: The White King is on g1. Its movement is severely restricted by Black's pieces. The key squares around the king (f2, g2) are controlled by Black's queens and pawns.\n2.  **Identify candidate moves**: Since we are looking for a forced mate, I will start by examining checking moves by Black's pieces (excluding the queens). The most promising pieces to move are the knight on d1 and the bishop on h3.\n3.  **Evaluate `1... Ne3+`**:\n    *   The knight moves from d1 to e3, putting the White King in check.\n    *   Let's analyze White's possible responses. The king cannot capture the knight or move to any adjacent squares (g2, f2, h2 are all controlled or blocked). White's only legal move is to move the king to h1 (`2. Kh1`). This is a forced move.\n4.  **Find the second move**:\n    *   After `1... Ne3+ 2. Kh1`, the White King is on h1. Black must now deliver the final checkmate.\n    *   Black can play `2... Bxf1#`. The bishop on h3 captures the white bishop on f1.\n    *   This is checkmate. The king on h1 is checked by the bishop on f1 and has no legal moves: g1 is attacked by the bishop, g2 is attacked by the queen on a2, and h2 is blocked by its own pawn.\n5.  **Confirm the solution**: The sequence `Ne3+` followed by `Bxf1#` is a forced mate in two moves. I will write a Python script to print this sequence. The numbers in the final sequence are `3` (from `e3`) and `1` (from `f1`), which I will also output as requested.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies and prints the solution to the chess puzzle.\n\n# The puzzle requires finding a mate-in-2 for Black, without moving the queens.\n# The analysis shows a single forced sequence.\n\n# Black's first move: Knight to e3, check.\n# This forces the White King to move from g1 to h1.\nmove_1 = \"Ne3+\"\n\n# Black's second move: Bishop captures on f1, checkmate.\n# This checkmates the White King on h1.\nmove_2 = \"Bxf1#\"\n\n# The problem asks for the sequence of black moves and to output the numbers in the \"final equation\".\n# The final sequence is the \"equation\", and the numbers are part of the standard chess notation.\nprint(\"The required sequence for Black to mate in 2 is:\")\nprint(f\"1... {move_1}\")\nprint(f\"2... {move_2}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThe numbers contained in the move notation are 3 and 1.\")\n```\n<<<Ne3+, Bxf1#>>>"
