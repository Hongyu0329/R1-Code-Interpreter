# This script identifies and prints the solution to the chess puzzle.

# The puzzle requires finding a mate-in-2 for Black, without moving the queens.
# The analysis shows a single forced sequence.

# Black's first move: Knight to e3, check.
# This forces the White King to move from g1 to h1.
move_1 = "Ne3+"

# Black's second move: Bishop captures on f1, checkmate.
# This checkmates the White King on h1.
move_2 = "Bxf1#"

# The problem asks for the sequence of black moves and to output the numbers in the "final equation".
# The final sequence is the "equation", and the numbers are part of the standard chess notation.
print("The required sequence for Black to mate in 2 is:")
print(f"1... {move_1}")
print(f"2... {move_2}")

print("\nThe numbers contained in the move notation are 3 and 1.")
