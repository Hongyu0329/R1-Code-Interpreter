# Based on the step-by-step analysis, the correct statements are 4, 5, 6, and 12.
# Statement 4: Plots 2 and 4 correspond to system (A).
# Statement 6: Plots 1 and 6 correspond to system (C).
# Since there are 3 systems and 6 plots (2 per system), if A=(2,4) and C=(1,6),
# then system B must correspond to the remaining plots, B=(3,5).
# Therefore, statement 5 is also correct.
# Statement 5: Plots 3 and 5 correspond to system (B).
#
# The Lewis number analysis concluded that the more stable plot in each pair has the higher Lewis number.
# Pair (2,4): Plot 2 is more stable.
# Pair (3,5): Plot 3 is more stable.
# Pair (1,6): Plot 1 is more stable.
# The set of plots with the higher Lewis number is {1, 2, 3}.
# This corresponds to statement 12.
#
# So the full set of correct statements is {4, 5, 6, 12}.
#
# Let's review the answer choices.
# A. 1,2,7
# B. 1,3,8
# C. 2,3,9
# D. 1,2,3,10
# E. 4,5,11
# F. 4,6,12
# G. 5,6,7
# H. 1,6,8
# I. 2,4,9
# J. 3,5,10
# K. 4,5,6,11
# L. 1,12
# M. 2,7
# N. 3,8
# O. 4,9
# P. 5,10
#
# The set {4, 5, 6, 12} is not an option.
# However, option F is {4, 6, 12}. This option affirms the most critical parts of our analysis:
# the pairings for the complex systems and the role of the Lewis number.
# It omits statement 5, which is a logical consequence of statements 4 and 6.
# This suggests a possible flaw in the question's options, but F is the "best fit" or "least wrong" answer.
