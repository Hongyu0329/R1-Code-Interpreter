    "This is a multi-step chemical reaction involving pericyclic processes. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Analyze the reactants and reaction type:** The first reactant is a mesoionic compound known as a Münchnone, which acts as a 1,3-dipole. The second reactant is dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD), an electron-deficient alkyne that serves as a dipolarophile. The reaction of a 1,3-dipole with a dipolarophile is a classic [3+2] cycloaddition, which is the first pericyclic reaction.\n2.  **Determine the byproduct:** I will perform an atom-balance calculation by determining the molecular formula of the reactants and the final product. The difference in atoms will reveal the formula of the byproduct molecule that is eliminated during the reaction.\n3.  **Identify the second pericyclic reaction:** The initial [3+2] cycloaddition forms a bicyclic adduct. This intermediate is typically unstable and eliminates the byproduct to form the stable, aromatic pyrrole ring. I will identify the type of pericyclic reaction that corresponds to this elimination step. The elimination of a small stable molecule like CO2 from a ring is known as a cheletropic elimination.\n4.  **Construct the final answer:** I will state the two identified pericyclic reactions and the chemical formula of the byproduct. I will use a Python script to print this information as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction_mechanism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided chemical reaction to identify the pericyclic reactions\n    and the stoichiometric byproduct.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Identify the first pericyclic reaction.\n    # The reaction between a Münchnone (a 1,3-dipole) and DMAD (a dipolarophile)\n    # is a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition, also known as a [3+2] cycloaddition.\n    # This is the first pericyclic reaction.\n    reaction_1 = \"[3+2] Cycloaddition\"\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the stoichiometric byproduct by atom counting.\n    # Reactant 1 (Münchnone, C10H9NO2) + Reactant 2 (DMAD, C6H6O4)\n    # gives Total Reactants = C16H15NO6.\n    # The final product is a substituted pyrrole with the formula C15H15NO4.\n    # The difference between reactants and product is (C16-15 H15-15 N1-1 O6-4), which is C1O2.\n    byproduct = \"CO2 (carbon dioxide)\"\n\n    # Step 3: Identify the second pericyclic reaction.\n    # The bicyclic adduct formed in the first step eliminates a molecule of CO2.\n    # This process, where a small molecule is extruded from a ring in a concerted\n    # fashion, is a type of cycloreversion called a cheletropic elimination.\n    # This is the second pericyclic reaction.\n    reaction_2 = \"Cheletropic elimination\"\n\n    # Step 4: Print the final answer.\n    print(\"The two types of pericyclic reactions involved are:\")\n    print(f\"1. {reaction_1}\")\n    print(f\"2. {reaction_2}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe stoichiometric byproduct is:\")\n    print(byproduct)\n\nsolve_reaction_mechanism()\n```\n<<<The two types of pericyclic reactions are [3+2] cycloaddition and cheletropic elimination.
