    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we need to identify each stereocenter and assign its configuration (R or S) using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Stereocenters**: Locate all carbon atoms with four different substituents.\n2.  **Address Drawing Ambiguity**: The stereocenter on the left (C2) is drawn with two dashed bonds, which is geometrically impossible. I will proceed by making the most common and logical interpretation: the main carbon backbone is drawn in the plane of the page, and the leftmost methyl group is part of this backbone.\n3.  **Assign Priorities**: For each stereocenter, rank the four attached groups based on atomic number according to CIP rules.\n4.  **Determine Configuration**:\n    *   Orient the molecule so the lowest-priority group (4) points away from the viewer.\n    *   Trace the path from the highest-priority group (1) to the second (2) to the third (3).\n    *   If the path is clockwise, the configuration is R. If counter-clockwise, it is S.\n    *   A shortcut: If the lowest-priority group (4) points towards the viewer, determine the direction and reverse the result (R becomes S, S becomes R).\n5.  **Report the Final Configuration**: Combine the individual assignments for all stereocenters.\n\nBased on this plan, the following Python script will print out the step-by-step reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the absolute configuration of the molecule in the image by\n    printing the step-by-step reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step determination of the absolute configuration:\")\n    print(\"\\nThe molecule has three stereocenters (chiral centers).
