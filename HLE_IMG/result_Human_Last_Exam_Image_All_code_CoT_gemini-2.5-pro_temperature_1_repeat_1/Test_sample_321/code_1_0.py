# This problem requires careful logical deduction rather than a direct simulation to find the answer.
# The thought process above outlines the steps of identifying plot features, forming hypotheses,
# and resolving contradictions to arrive at a unique solution.
# The final answer is a sequence of parameter IDs.

# Parameter-identifier mapping:
# μ: 1, μs: 2, μn: 3, ai: 5, fs: 6, cl: 7, μh: 8,
# βh: 9, rb: 11, ch: 12, qs: 13, ql: 14, qf: 15

# Final assignment of parameters to plots
# This represents the solution to the puzzle.
p1 = 8   # Varied parameter in Plot 1 is μh
p2 = 5   # Varied parameter in Plot 2 is ai
p3 = 9   # Varied parameter in Plot 3 is βh
p4 = 14  # Varied parameter in Plot 4 is ql
p5 = 7   # Varied parameter in Plot 5 is cl
p6 = 15  # Varied parameter in Plot 6 is qf
p7 = 2   # Varied parameter in Plot 7 is μs
p8 = 13  # Varied parameter in Plot 8 is qs
p9 = 6   # Varied parameter in Plot 9 is fs

solution = [p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7, p8, p9]

# We print the final result as requested.
# The final equation is the sequence of identifiers.
