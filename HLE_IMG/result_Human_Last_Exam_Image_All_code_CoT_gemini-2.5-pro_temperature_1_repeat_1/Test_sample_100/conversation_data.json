    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the molecular formula of the product:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:** I will first determine the molecular formula of the starting compound by counting the atoms of each element (Carbon, Hydrogen, Fluorine, Nitrogen, Oxygen) in its structure. The starting material is a bicyclic lactam with a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group and a p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group.\n2.  **Analyze Reaction Step 1:** The first step involves reacting the starting material with Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN). This reagent is known for oxidatively cleaving the PMB group from a nitrogen atom. I will calculate the change in the number of atoms. A PMB group (C8H9O) is replaced by a single hydrogen atom, resulting in a net change of -C8H8O. This gives the formula for Intermediate 1.\n3.  **Analyze Reaction Step 2:** The second step is a catalytic hydrogenation using Palladium on Carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2). This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond in the molecule. I will calculate the change in atoms, which is the addition of two hydrogen atoms (+H2), to find the formula for Intermediate 2.\n4.  **Analyze Reaction Step 3:** The third step is the hydrolysis of the lactam (a cyclic amide) using strong acid (HCl) and heat. This reaction breaks the amide bond by adding one molecule of water (H2O). I will add H2 and O to the formula of Intermediate 2 to find the molecular formula of the final product.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that programmatically performs these calculations and prints the final molecular formula in the standard format.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the calculation:\n```python\ndef calculate_product_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the final product through a three-step reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the molecular formula of the starting material.\n    # The starting material is 2-(4-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    # Core (C6H5NO) + PMB group (C8H9O) + CF3 group (CF3)\n    # C: 6 + 8 + 1 = 15\n    # H: 5 + 9 = 14\n    # F: 3\n    # N: 1\n    # O: 1 + 1 = 2\n    # Formula: C15H14F3NO2\n    atoms = {\n        'C': 15,\n        'H': 14,\n        'F': 3,\n        'N': 1,\n        'O': 2\n    }\n    print(f\"Starting material formula: C{atoms['C']}H{atoms['H']}F{atoms['F']}NO{atoms['O']}\")\n\n    # Step 2: PMB group deprotection with CAN.\n    # The PMB group (C8H9O) is replaced by a hydrogen (H) atom.\n    # The net change is the removal of a C8H8O fragment.\n    atoms['C'] -= 8\n    atoms['H'] -= 8\n    atoms['O'] -= 1\n    print(f\"Intermediate 1 formula (after PMB deprotection): C{atoms['C']}H{atoms['H']}F{atoms['F']}NO{atoms['O']}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Hydrogenation of the C=C double bond with Pd/C and H2.\n    # This adds two hydrogen atoms.\n    atoms['H'] += 2\n    print(f\"Intermediate 2 formula (after hydrogenation): C{atoms['C']}H{atoms['H']}F{atoms['F']}NO{atoms['O']}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Hydrolysis of the lactam with acid.\n    # This reaction adds one molecule of water (H2O).\n    atoms['H'] += 2\n    atoms['O'] += 1\n    print(f\"Final product formula (after hydrolysis): C{atoms['C']}H{atoms['H']}F{atoms['F']}NO{atoms['O']}\")\n\n    # Format the final result into a standard molecular formula string.\n    # The convention is to omit the number '1'.\n    final_formula = \"\"\n    # Standard order of elements: C, H, then alphabetical.\n    elements_in_order = ['C', 'H', 'F', 'N', 'O']\n    for element in elements_in_order:\n        count = atoms.get(element, 0)\n        if count > 0:\n            final_formula += element\n            if count > 1:\n                final_formula += str(count)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe molecular formula of the final product is:\")\n    # The requested output format is the full equation with each number.\n    print(f\"C{atoms['C']}H{atoms['H']}F{atoms['F']}N{atoms['N']}O{atoms['O']}\")\n\n\ncalculate_product_formula()\n```\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
