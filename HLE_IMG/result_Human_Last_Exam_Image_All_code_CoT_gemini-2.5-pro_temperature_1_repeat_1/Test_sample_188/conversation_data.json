    "To compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph, we can use the **Deletion-Contraction Principle**. This principle states that for any graph G and any edge e in G, the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) satisfies the recurrence relation:\n\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G.e, k)\n\nwhere:\n*   `G - e` is the graph obtained by deleting the edge `e`.\n*   `G.e` is the graph obtained by contracting the edge `e` (merging its two endpoints into a single vertex).\n\n**Step-by-step Calculation:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Graph (G):**\n    *   Vertices V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n    *   Edges E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. This graph has 5 vertices and 7 edges.\n\n2.  **Choose an Edge (e):**\n    Let's choose the edge `e = (4, 5)`. This edge is part of the triangle {3, 4, 5}, and its removal or contraction will simplify the graph.\n\n3.  **Compute P(G - e, k):**\n    *   `G - e` is the graph G with the edge (4, 5) removed.\n    *   This graph can be analyzed using direct counting with casework or by applying the deletion-contraction principle again.\n    *   A detailed calculation shows that the chromatic polynomial of `G - e` is `P(G-e, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 3k + 3)`.\n\n4.  **Compute P(G.e, k):**\n    *   `G.e` is the graph G with the edge (4, 5) contracted. We merge vertices 4 and 5 into a new vertex, let's call it `v45`.\n    *   The new vertex `v45` is connected to all neighbors of the original vertices 4 and 5 (i.e., vertices 1, 2, and 3).\n    *   The resulting graph has 4 vertices: {1, 2, 3, `v45`} and is a complete graph K4 missing one edge, (1,3).\n    *   The chromatic polynomial of K4-e is `P(G.e, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)^2`.\n\n5.  **Combine the Results:**\n    *   P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G.e, k)\n    *   P(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 3k + 3) - k(k-1)(k-2)^2`\n    *   Factor out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\n        P(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k^2 - 3k + 3) - (k-2)]`\n    *   Simplify the expression in the brackets:\n        P(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n\n6.  **Expand to Standard Form:**\n    Expanding the factored polynomial gives the final expression:\n    P(G, k) = `(k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n    P(G, k) = `k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`\n\nThe following Python code will print this final polynomial expression.\n\n```python\ndef print_chromatic_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the computed chromatic polynomial for the given graph.\n    The polynomial is P(k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Coefficients for the powers k^5, k^4, k^3, k^2, k^1\n    coeffs = {\n        5: 1,\n        4: -7,\n        3: 19,\n        2: -23,\n        1: 10\n    }\n    \n    # Start building the output string\n    poly_string = \"P(k) = \"\n    \n    is_first_term = True\n    for power in sorted(coeffs.keys(), reverse=True):\n        coeff = coeffs[power]\n        \n        # Determine the sign to print\n        sign = \"\"\n        if not is_first_term:\n            sign = \" + \" if coeff > 0 else \" - \"\n        elif coeff < 0:\n            sign = \"-\"\n\n        abs_coeff = abs(coeff)\n        \n        # Format the term\n        term = \"\"\n        # Coefficient part\n        if abs_coeff != 1 or power == 0:\n            term += str(abs_coeff)\n        \n        # Variable part\n        if power > 0:\n            term += \"k\"\n            if power > 1:\n                term += f\"^{power}\"\n        \n        poly_string += sign + term\n        is_first_term = False\n        \n    print(\"The computed chromatic polynomial is:\")\n    print(poly_string)\n\nprint_chromatic_polynomial()\n```\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
