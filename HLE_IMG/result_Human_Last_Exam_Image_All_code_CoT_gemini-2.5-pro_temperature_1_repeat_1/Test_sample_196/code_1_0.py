    # Possibility 1: [6π + 4π] cycloaddition

    # This is often cited as the pathway to the thermodynamic product.

    # Possibility 2: [4π + 2π] cycloaddition

    # This is a common reaction mode for 1,3-dipoles.

    # Possibility 3: [8π + 2π] cycloaddition
    # This is a higher-order cycloaddition where one molecule provides an 8π system.

    # Possibility 4: [4π + 4π] cycloaddition
