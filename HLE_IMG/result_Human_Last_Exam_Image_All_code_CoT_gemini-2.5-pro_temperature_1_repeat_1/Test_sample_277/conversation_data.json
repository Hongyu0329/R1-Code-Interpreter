    "To determine the type of isomers, we need to compare the molecular structures. However, the image provided is completely black, and no molecules are shown. Therefore, I cannot visually inspect the molecules to determine their relationship.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with the logical steps to solve this type of problem if the molecules were visible. I will outline this logic in a Python script.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Acknowledge the Missing Information:** State that the molecules are not visible in the image.\n2.  **Outline the Analysis Steps:**\n    *   **Step 1: Compare Molecular Formulas.** If they are different, the molecules are not isomers.\n    *   **Step 2: Compare Connectivity.** If the formulas are the same but the atom-to-atom connections are different, they are **constitutional isomers**.\n    *   **Step 3: Compare Spatial Arrangement.** If both formula and connectivity are the same, analyze the 3D structure.\n        *   If they are interconvertible by single bond rotation, they are **conformers**.\n        *   If they are superimposable, they are **identical**.\n        *   If they are non-superimposable, they are **stereoisomers**.\n3.  **Code Implementation:** Write a Python script that prints this analysis plan clearly.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since the analysis cannot be performed, a definitive answer cannot be selected from the given options. The question is unanswerable as presented.\n\n```python\ndef explain_isomer_identification():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step process for determining the\n    relationship between two chemical structures.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The image provided is black, so no molecules are visible.\")\n    print(\"To solve this problem, you would need to perform the following analysis:\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Isomer Identification Steps ---\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Compare Molecular Formulas\")\n    print(\"   - First, count the number of atoms of each element (e.g., C, H, O) in both molecules.\")\n    print(\"   - If the formulas are different, they are not isomers.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Compare Connectivity\")\n    print(\"   - If the molecular formulas are the same, check the bonding sequence.\")\n    print(\"   - If the atoms are connected in a different order, the molecules are (b) constitutional isomers.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Compare 3D Spatial Arrangement\")\n    print(\"   - If the formula and connectivity are the same, analyze their 3D shapes.\")\n    print(\"   - (a) Conformers: Are they interconvertible just by rotating single bonds?\")\n    print(\"   - (c) Identical: Are they the same molecule, just viewed from a different angle (i.e., superimposable)?\")\n    print(\"   - (d) Stereoisomers: Are they non-superimposable isomers with the same connectivity?\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"Since the molecules are not shown, this analysis cannot be completed.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, it is impossible to choose between options (a), (b), (c), or (d).\")\n\nexplain_isomer_identification()\n```\n<<<e>>>"
