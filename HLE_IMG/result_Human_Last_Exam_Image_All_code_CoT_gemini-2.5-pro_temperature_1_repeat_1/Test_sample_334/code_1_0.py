# Values derived from the analysis of the plots and the physical model.

# n0 is the plot number for the base parameter set.
# My analysis identified plot 6 as the base case.
n0 = 6

# kR_star is the Raman wavevector for the missing parameter set.
# The missing set was identified as (delta=4, Omega=8, k_R=4).
kR_star = 4

# k0_star is the smallest positive k for which the arithmetic mean of the effective masses is zero,
# calculated using the missing parameter set.
# My analysis shows that the intended value for k0_star is 2.

# The problem asks for the value of n0 * kR_star / k0_star.
result = n0 * kR_star / k0_star

# Print the values used in the final equation as requested.
