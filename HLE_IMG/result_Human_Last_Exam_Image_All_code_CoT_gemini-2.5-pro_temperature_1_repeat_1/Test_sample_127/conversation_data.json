    "My plan to solve this problem is to analyze the molecular structure provided and determine which of the labeled phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L) can rotate freely around their connecting single bond. Free rotation is primarily governed by steric hindrance from nearby atoms or groups.\n\n1.  **Analyze Ring H and Ring J:** These rings are attached to positions 4 of rings A and C, respectively. These positions are 'para' to the site of cyclometalation (the C-Ir bond). This means they are located far from the bulky Iridium center and its other ligands, pointing away from the core of the complex. Therefore, they should experience minimal steric hindrance and can rotate freely.\n\n2.  **Analyze Ring G:** This ring is attached to position 6 of the pyridine ring D. While it is ortho to the coordinating nitrogen atom, it is still on the periphery of the complex. Compared to other rings, its rotation is not severely restricted by direct interaction with the metal center or other parts of the same ligand. It can rotate freely.\n\n3.  **Analyze Ring K and Ring L:** These rings are attached to positions 6 of the phenyl rings A and C, respectively. This position is 'ortho' to the C-Ir bond. This proximity places rings K and L extremely close to the Iridium atom and the other ligands. The diagram for ring K even includes a dotted line to the Iridium center, suggesting a strong interaction or steric clash that would lock the ring in place. Therefore, the rotation of rings K and L is severely hindered.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, rings G, H, and J can rotate freely, while rings K and L cannot.\n\nI will now write a Python script to print this reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_rotation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the rotation of phenyl rings in the given iridium complex.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the free rotation of phenyl rings G, H, J, K, and L.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Dictionary to store the analysis for each ring\n    analysis = {\n        'H': \"Attached at position 4 of ring A (para to the Ir-C bond).

Similar to ring H, it is far from the metal center and can rotate freely.\",\n        'G': \"Attached at position 6 of pyridine ring D. It is on the periphery of the complex and is not sterically locked by the metal center. It can rotate freely.\",\n        'K': \"Attached at position 6 of ring A (ortho to the Ir-C bond). It is very close to the Iridium center, causing severe steric hindrance that prevents free rotation.\",\n        'L': \"Attached at position 6 of ring C (ortho to the Ir-C bond). Similar to ring K, its proximity to the Iridium center prevents free rotation.\"\n    }\n\n    freely_rotating_rings = []\n    restricted_rings = []\n\n    for ring, reason in analysis.items():\n        print(f\"Ring {ring}: {reason}\")\n        if \"can rotate freely\" in reason:\n            freely_rotating_rings.append(ring)\n        else:\n            restricted_rings.append(ring)\n    \n    freely_rotating_rings.sort()\n\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(f\"The rings that can rotate freely are: {', '.join(freely_rotating_rings)}\")\n    print(f\"The rings with restricted rotation are: {', '.join(sorted(restricted_rings))}\")\n    print(\"\\nMatching this with the answer choices, the correct option includes G, J, and H.\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_rotation()\n<<<E>>>\n```"
