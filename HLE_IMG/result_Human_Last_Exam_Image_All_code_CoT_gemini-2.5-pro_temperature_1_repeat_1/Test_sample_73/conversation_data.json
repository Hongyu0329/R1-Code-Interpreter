    "To determine the stereochemical assignments, we will analyze each stereocenter one by one using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. The esterification reaction shown does not affect the configuration of the existing stereocenters, as the bonds being formed and broken are not at the chiral centers themselves.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis which will be performed by the python script:\n\n1.  **Analyze Stereocenter 1 (Acyl Chloride):**\n    *   Identify the four groups attached to the chiral carbon.\n    *   Assign priorities based on atomic number (Z).\n    *   Determine the (R) or (S) configuration based on the 3D arrangement.\n\n2.  **Analyze Stereocenter 2 (Alcohol):**\n    *   Identify the four groups attached to the chiral carbon.\n    *   Assign priorities.\n    *   Determine the (R) or (S) configuration.\n\n3.  **Analyze Stereocenter 3 (Ester Product - Alcohol Part):**\n    *   Recognize that the configuration is retained from the alcohol reactant.\n    *   Confirm the assignment by re-evaluating the priorities in the product.\n\n4.  **Analyze Stereocenter 4 (Ester Product - Acyl Part):**\n    *   Recognize that the configuration is retained from the acyl chloride reactant.\n    *   Confirm the assignment by re-evaluating the priorities in the product.\n\n5.  **Final Output:**\n    *   Combine the four assignments in the order they appear from left to right in the reaction scheme.\n\n```python\ndef solve_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the stereochemical assignment (R/S) for the four stereocenters\n    in the provided reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    assignments = []\n\n    # --- Stereocenter 1: Acyl Chloride ---\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Stereocenter 1 (Acyl Chloride) ---\")\n    print(\"The stereocenter is the carbon atom bonded to -COCl, -Ph, -CF3, and -OMe.\")\n    print(\"Assigning priorities based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules (highest atomic number first):\")\n    print(\"1. -OMe (Oxygen, Z=8)\")\n    print(\"2. -COCl (Carbon bonded to Cl (Z=17))\")\n    print(\"3. -CF3 (Carbon bonded to F (Z=9))\")\n    print(\"4. -Ph (Carbon bonded to C (Z=6))\")\n    print(\"\\nDetermining configuration:\")\n    print(\"The group with the highest priority, -OMe (1), is pointing away from the viewer (dashed wedge).\")\n    print(\"The sequence from priority 2 to 3 to 4 is -COCl -> -CF3 -> -Ph.\")\n    print(\"In the given 2D representation, this sequence traces a clockwise direction.\")\n    print(\"A special rule states that if the highest priority group is in the back, a clockwise sequence of 2->3->4 corresponds to an (R) configuration.\")\n    print(\"Alternatively, using the single-swap rule: we swap the lowest priority group, -Ph (4), with the group in the back, -OMe (1).\")\n    print(\"In the resulting fictitious molecule, -Ph (4) is in the back.
