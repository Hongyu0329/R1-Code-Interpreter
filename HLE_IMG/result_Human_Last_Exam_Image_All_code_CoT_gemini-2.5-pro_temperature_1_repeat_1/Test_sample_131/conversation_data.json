    "My plan is to first identify the chemical structure provided in the image. This requires recognizing the specific arrangement of atoms and bonds, which corresponds to a known natural product. After identifying the compound, I will create a simple Python script that stores the name of this compound in a variable and then prints the name to the console, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef identify_alkaloid():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the alkaloid compound from the provided image.\n    The structure is a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid, a type of lupin alkaloid.\n    It has the chemical formula C15H24N2O.\n    Based on the specific stereochemistry and the position of the carbonyl group,\n    the compound is identified as Lupanine.\n    \"\"\"\n    compound_name = \"Lupanine\"\n    print(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n\nidentify_alkaloid()\n```\n<<<Lupanine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
