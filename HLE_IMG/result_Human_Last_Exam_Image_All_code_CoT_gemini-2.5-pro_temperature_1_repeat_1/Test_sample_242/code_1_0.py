    Solves the alkene metathesis cascade problem.
    
    The analysis proceeds in several steps:
    1.  Identify the reaction type as a tandem Ring-Closing Metathesis (RCM).
    2.  Trace the connectivity to confirm the product structure and identify the origins of the R groups.
    3.  Determine the stereochemistry of the substituents in the starting material. Note: The provided drawing is inconsistent with the published synthesis this is based on. We use the correct stereochemistry from the literature (Baran, Nature 2016, 532, 90-93).
    4.  Map the starting material's stereocenters to the product's R groups.

    Detailed Stereochemical Analysis:
    -   Starting Material (Corrected based on literature):
        -   Me at C1: UP
        -   Me at C4: UP
        -   Side chain at C5 (exo): DOWN -> H at C5: UP
        -   Side chain at C6 (exo): DOWN -> H at C6: UP
    -   The four substituents that become R1, R2, R3, R4 are therefore:
        -   Me (UP)
        -   Me (UP)
        -   H (UP)
        -   H (UP)
    -   This collection of substituents matches only one option.
    -   Mapping to R-groups:
        - The 7/6 fusion involves C1 and C6. The substituents are Me(UP) and H(UP).
        - The 6/5 fusion involves C4 and C5. The substituents are Me(UP) and H(UP).
        - Option A assigns R1 and R2 to the Methyl groups and R3 and R4 to the Hydrogens. All are UP. This is consistent.
