    This function determines the parameter changes for each of the six plots
    based on the analysis of the reaction-diffusion process.

    The logic is as follows:
    - Plot 2 is identified as the baseline ('0').
    - Plot 1 shows a slower reaction (higher cA, lower cB) -> Halved rate constant ('k').
    - Plot 3 shows a faster reaction (lower cA, higher cB) -> Doubled rate constant ('K').
    - Plot 4 shows a U-shaped cA profile, indicating the reaction is slower at low concentrations -> Doubled reaction order ('N').
    - Plot 5 shows a deep V-shaped cA profile, indicating the reaction is faster at low concentrations -> Halved reaction order ('n').
    - Plot 6 shows flatter cA (higher) and cB (lower) profiles -> Doubled diffusion coefficient ('D').
