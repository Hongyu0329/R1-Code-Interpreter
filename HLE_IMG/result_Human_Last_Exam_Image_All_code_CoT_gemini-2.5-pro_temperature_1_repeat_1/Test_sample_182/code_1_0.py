# The user wants me to identify the type of pericyclic reaction.
# Based on the analysis, the reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition, which is known as a Diels-Alder reaction.
# The reactants are an alkene (which acts as the 4-pi component precursor under Lewis acid catalysis) and a dienophile (maleic anhydride).
# The product is a six-membered ring fused to the anhydride, which is the characteristic adduct of a Diels-Alder reaction.
# Therefore, the correct answer choice is F.

# Let's create a simple python script to state the answer.
