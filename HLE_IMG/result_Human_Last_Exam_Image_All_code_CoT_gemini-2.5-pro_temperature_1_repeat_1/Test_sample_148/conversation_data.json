    "Here is my thinking process for arriving at the diagnosis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clinical Information:**\n    *   **Patient:** 28-year-old female.\n    *   **Location:** Mass in the sella turcica. The sella turcica is the bony structure that houses the pituitary gland. Therefore, the primary suspicion for a mass in this location is a pituitary tumor.\n    *   **Procedure:** Intraoperative crush smear. This is a cytological preparation used for rapid diagnosis during surgery to guide the surgeon.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Pathological Image (Cytology):**\n    *   **Cellularity and Arrangement:** The smear shows cohesive groups and sheets of cells, as well as some dissociated single cells. This indicates an epithelial or neuroendocrine neoplasm.\n    *   **Cellular Morphology (The \"What do the cells look like?\" question):**\n        *   The cells are relatively uniform in size and shape (monomorphic).\n        *   The nuclei are round to oval.\n        *   The chromatin pattern is finely granular and stippled, often described as \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin. This is a classic feature of neuroendocrine cells.\n        *   Nucleoli are inconspicuous or absent.\n        *   The cytoplasm is moderately abundant, eosinophilic (pink), and has a granular quality.\n        *   Cell borders are indistinct, leading to a syncytial appearance (cells merging together).\n    *   **Background:** The background is granular and somewhat \"messy,\" which is typical for a crush preparation of a soft, cellular tumor like a pituitary adenoma. There is no evidence of \"wet keratin,\" extensive inflammation, or prominent necrosis.\n\n3.  **Formulate a Differential Diagnosis (What could it be?):**\n    *   **Pituitary Adenoma:** This is the most common tumor of the sella turcica. The cytological features observed—monomorphic cells, \"salt-and-pepper\" neuroendocrine chromatin, granular cytoplasm, and cohesive sheets—are all classic for a pituitary adenoma. This is the top differential.\n    *   **Craniopharyngioma:** This tumor also occurs in this region. However, its classic appearance involves either papillary structures or adamantinomatous features like peripheral palisading, \"wet keratin,\" and calcifications, none of which are seen here.\n    *   **Meningioma:** Can occur near the sella. They typically show cells arranged in whorls or syncytia, but the nuclei are usually more oval with fine, smooth chromatin and may have intranuclear pseudoinclusions. The \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin is not a feature of meningioma.\n    *   **Metastasis:** A possibility, but metastases usually show more nuclear pleomorphism (variation in size and shape) and atypia than the uniform population seen here.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The combination of the clinical presentation (young adult with a sellar mass) and the pathognomonic cytological features (monomorphic neuroendocrine cells) is overwhelmingly consistent with a diagnosis of Pituitary Adenoma.\n\nI will now create a Python script to print this diagnostic summary.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_sellar_mass():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the diagnostic reasoning for the provided clinical case and image.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Clinical Data\n    patient_age = 28\n    patient_sex = \"female\"\n    location = \"sella turcica\"\n    sample_type = \"intraoperative crush smear\"\n\n    # Cytological Findings\n    cellular_arrangement = \"cohesive sheets and clusters of monomorphic cells\"\n    nuclear_features = \"round to oval nuclei with classic 'salt-and-pepper' stippled chromatin\"\n    cytoplasmic_features = \"moderate amount of granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm\"\n    background = \"granular, typical for a crush preparation\"\n\n    # Differential Diagnosis and Conclusion\n    primary_diagnosis = \"Pituitary adenoma\"\n    reasoning = (\n        f\"The most common tumor in the {location} is a pituitary adenoma. \"\n        f\"The cytological features, particularly the uniform cells with '{nuclear_features.split(' with ')[1]}', \"\n        f\"are pathognomonic for a neuroendocrine neoplasm.
