    "Based on an analysis of the artwork's style, subject, and inscription, I have identified the author.\n\nThe relief is a prime example of the French Renaissance style, characteristic of the School of Fontainebleau. The inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AUTEL\" (Sacrament of the Altar) clearly identifies the scene as the Eucharist. This specific work is a well-documented relief from the base of the \"Altarpiece of the Sacrament,\" created around 1544 for the chapel of the Château d'Écouen. The artist is the celebrated French Renaissance sculptor Jean Goujon.\n\nHere is a Python script to state the author's name.\n\n```python\ndef find_author():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the author of the artwork shown.\n    The artwork is a relief detail from the Altarpiece of the Sacrament.\n    \"\"\"\n    author = \"Jean Goujon\"\n    print(f\"The author of this detail of the Altarpiece is: {author}\")\n\nfind_author()\n```\n<<<Jean Goujon>>>"
