    "This sheet music is a transcription of a famous jazz solo. I can identify the piece by analyzing the melody and the chord changes.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the Melody and Chords:** The music is in the key of C. The first few measures of the melody are `C D (pickup) | E G A G | E G A G | G# B C B | ...`. The underlying chords are `C | C | E7 | ...`.\n2.  **Identify the Song:** This specific melodic phrase played over these chord changes is the unmistakable beginning of the Belgian-French Romani guitarist Django Reinhardt's famous 1935 improvised solo on the song \"Avalon\".\n3.  **Determine Title, Style, and Origin:**\n    *   **Title:** The underlying song is \"Avalon\", an American popular song from 1920.\n    *   **Musical Style:** The solo is a quintessential example of \"Gypsy Jazz\" (also known as \"Jazz Manouche\" or \"Hot Club Jazz\"), a style pioneered by Django Reinhardt in Paris.\n    *   **Country of Origin:** While the original song \"Avalon\" is American, this iconic performance and the Gypsy Jazz style originated in France.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will generate a Python script to print the findings.\n\n```python\ndef solve_music_query():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides information about the song presented in the sheet music.\n  The sheet music is a transcription of Django Reinhardt's solo on \"Avalon\".\n  \"\"\"\n  title = \"Avalon\"\n  musical_style = \"Gypsy Jazz (also known as Jazz Manouche)\"\n  country_of_origin = \"France (for this specific performance and style)\"\n\n  print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n  print(f\"Musical Style: {musical_style}\")\n  print(f\"Country of Origin: {country_of_origin}\")\n\nsolve_music_query()\n```\n<<<Title: Avalon, Musical Style: Gypsy Jazz (Jazz Manouche), Country of Origin: France>>>"
