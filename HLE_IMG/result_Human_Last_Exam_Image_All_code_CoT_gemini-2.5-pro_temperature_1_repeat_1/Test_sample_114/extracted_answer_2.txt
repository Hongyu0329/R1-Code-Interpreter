The regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is caused by the steric hindrance of the fused pyrrolidine ring in the asymmetric münchnone intermediate, which directs the bulky ester group of the alkyne to the less hindered C4 position. Reactions 1 and 2 serve as a control, showing that a symmetric münchnone intermediate with similar substituents at C2 and C4 results in a non-selective reaction (1:1 product ratio).
