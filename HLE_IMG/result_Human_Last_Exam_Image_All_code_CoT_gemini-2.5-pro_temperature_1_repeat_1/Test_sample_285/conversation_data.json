    "To determine which triangulation violates the empty circle property of Delaunay triangulations, we need to find a case where a vertex of the triangulation lies inside the circumcircle of one of its triangles.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the graphs visually:** We will inspect each of the four graphs (A, B, C, D) to find a potential violation. A common feature of non-Delaunay triangulations is the presence of \"skinny\" triangles that result from choosing the shorter diagonal in a convex quadrilateral.\n2.  **Identify a candidate:** Graph B contains a convex quadrilateral formed by the top vertex (P_T), the two inner side vertices (I_L, I_R), and the bottom inner vertex (I_B). This quadrilateral is divided by the diagonal connecting I_L and I_R. This diagonal appears to be the shorter one, creating a very \"skinny\" triangle (P_T, I_L, I_R). This is a classic indicator of a non-Delaunay edge. The empty circle property implies that for the edge I_L-I_R to be Delaunay, the sum of the opposite angles, ∠I_L(P_T)I_R + ∠I_L(I_B)I_R, must be less than or equal to 180°. Equivalently, vertex I_B must not lie inside the circumcircle of triangle (P_T, I_L, I_R).\n3.  **Verify with code:** We will assign coordinates to the relevant points in graph B that are consistent with the visual representation. Then, we will write a Python script to:\n    a. Define the vertices of the triangle in question: T = (P_T, I_L, I_R).\n    b. Define the vertex to be checked: I_B.\n    c. Calculate the center and radius of the circumcircle of triangle T.\n    d. Check if the distance from the circumcenter to point I_B is less than the circumradius.\n    e. If it is, the property is violated.\n\n### Execution\n\nLet's set up coordinates for the key points in Figure B that reflect the visual arrangement where the violation is suspected.\n\n*   Top vertex: `P_T = (0, 12)`\n*   Inner left vertex: `I_L = (-4, 10)`\n*   Inner right vertex: `I_R = (4, 10)`\n*   Inner bottom vertex: `I_B = (0, 9)`\n\nWe will check if point `I_B` lies inside the circumcircle of the triangle formed by `P_T`, `I_L`, and `I_R`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the points from graph B\np_t = np.array([0, 12])\ni_l = np.array([-4, 10])\ni_r = np.array([4, 10])\ni_b = np.array([0, 9])\n\n# The triangle in question is (p_t, i_l, i_r)\n# The point to check is i_b\n\n# Function to find the circumcenter of a triangle\ndef find_circumcenter(p1, p2, p3):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the circumcenter of a triangle defined by three points.\"\"\"\n    D = 2 * (p1[0] * (p2[1] - p3[1]) + p2[0] * (p3[1] - p1[1]) + p3[0] * (p1[1] - p2[1]))\n    \n    # Check for colinearity\n    if D == 0:\n        return None, float('inf')\n\n    p1_sq = p1[0]**2 + p1[1]**2\n    p2_sq = p2[0]**2 + p2[1]**2\n    p3_sq = p3[0]**2 + p3[1]**2\n    \n    ux = (p1_sq * (p2[1] - p3[1]) + p2_sq * (p3[1] - p1[1]) + p3_sq * (p1[1] - p2[1])) / D\n    uy = (p1_sq * (p3[0] - p2[0]) + p2_sq * (p1[0] - p3[0]) + p3_sq * (p2[0] - p1[0])) / D\n    \n    center = np.array([ux, uy])\n    radius_sq = (p1[0] - ux)**2 + (p1[1] - uy)**2\n    \n    return center, radius_sq\n\n# Calculate circumcircle for triangle (p_t, i_l, i_r)\ntriangle_vertices = [p_t, i_l, i_r]\ncenter, radius_sq = find_circumcenter(*triangle_vertices)\n\n# Check if point i_b is inside the circumcircle\n# A point is inside if its squared distance to the center is less than the squared radius\ndist_sq_to_center = (i_b[0] - center[0])**2 + (i_b[1] - center[1])**2\n\nprint(f\"Triangle vertices: P_T={tuple(p_t)}, I_L={tuple(i_l)}, I_R={tuple(i_r)}\")\nprint(f\"Point to check: I_B={tuple(i_b)}\")\nprint(f\"Circumcenter of the triangle: ({center[0]:.2f}, {center[1]:.2f})\")\nprint(f\"Squared radius of the circumcircle: {radius_sq:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"Squared distance of I_B from the center: {dist_sq_to_center:.2f}\")\n\nif dist_sq_to_center < radius_sq:\n    print(\"\\nResult: Point I_B is INSIDE the circumcircle of triangle (P_T, I_L, I_R).\")\n    print(\"Therefore, triangulation B violates the empty circle property.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"\\nResult: Point I_B is OUTSIDE the circumcircle.\")\n    print(\"This specific test does not show a violation for triangulation B.\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
