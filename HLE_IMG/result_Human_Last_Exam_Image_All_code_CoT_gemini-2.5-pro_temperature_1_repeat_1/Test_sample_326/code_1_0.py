def solve_soliton_problem():
    """
    This function calculates the value of (1 - max|Î¦|) for the given problem.
    The steps are derived from the analysis of the NLSE and its flat-top soliton solution.
    
    1. The problem leads to an algebraic equation for the soliton amplitude:
       beta = R * X + (1 - R^2) * X^2
       where X = A_max^8, beta = 17/324, and R = (v2/v1)^2.

    2. This is one equation with two unknowns (X and R). A mathematical constraint is
       derived by assuming a rational solution, which leads to a Diophantine-like
       equation for X.

    3. Solving this equation with the (5, 12, 13) Pythagorean triple yields a unique
       valid solution: X = 5/27 and R = 1/10.

    4. The maximum amplitude is A_max = X^(1/8).

    5. The final quantity to calculate is 1 - A_max.

    X_denominator = 27
