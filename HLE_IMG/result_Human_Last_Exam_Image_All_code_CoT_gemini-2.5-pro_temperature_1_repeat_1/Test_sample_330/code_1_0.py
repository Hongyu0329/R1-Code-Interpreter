    # Step 1: Identify the reference ('0') and initial condition ('Z') plots.
    # Plots 1 and 3 show statistically identical attractors, differing only in the specific trajectory.

    # We designate Plot 1 as the reference case.
    plot1_code = '0'
    plot3_code = 'Z'

    # Step 2: Analyze the remaining plots based on parameter effects.

    # Plot 2 shows a larger, denser, and more chaotic attractor compared to the reference.
    # The time series shows higher amplitudes. This is characteristic of increased forcing,
    # which is controlled by the Rayleigh number (R). Thus, Plot 2 corresponds to a doubled R.
    plot2_code = 'R'

    # Plot 4 exhibits strong synchronization between the blue and orange systems, as seen in the
    # tightly correlated time series. This indicates strong coupling, which is governed by the
    # Biot number (B). Thus, Plot 4 corresponds to a doubled B.
    plot4_code = 'B'

    # Plot 5 shows the dynamics decaying to a stable fixed point, a significant stabilization.
    # The Prandtl number (P) affects the system's stability. A low P can suppress chaos.
    # Thus, Plot 5 corresponds to a halved P.

    # Plot 6 shows a simplification to a limit cycle and a distinct asymmetry (orange attractor
    # is smaller than blue). The parameter µ is the only one that creates this inherent
    # asymmetry. Halving µ would cause this and can also change the dynamics qualitatively.
