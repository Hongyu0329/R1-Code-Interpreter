    "To determine the total number of splice species, we need to count every unique PCR product band identified across all the experiments (panels B-I). Each unique band represents a distinct splice variant.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Go through each panel (B through I) which represents an RT-PCR experiment with a specific pair of primers.\n2.  Count the number of distinct bands reported for each panel.\n3.  Pay special attention to panels H and I, which use the same primer pair (E1F1/L1R). Panel I, having more PCR cycles, reveals additional, less abundant splice species. We will combine the results from these two panels to get the total count for that specific primer pair, avoiding double-counting.\n4.  Sum the counts from all unique experiments to find the total number of splice species.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_splice_species():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the total number of splice species based on the provided RT-PCR data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Dictionary to store the number of bands (splice species) per panel.\n    # The key is the panel letter and the value is the number of bands.\n    species_counts = {\n        \"Panel B (E1F1/E4R)\": 2,  # bands at 190 bp and 159 bp\n        \"Panel C (E1F1/E5R)\": 2,  # bands at 584 bp and 553 bp\n        \"Panel D (E1F2/E5R)\": 1,  # band at 551 bp\n        \"Panel E (E1F1/L2R)\": 1,  # band at 1,005 bp\n        \"Panel F (E1F2/L2R)\": 1,  # band at 972 bp\n        \"Panel G (E1F3/L2R)\": 2,  # bands at 1,003 bp and 931 bp\n        # Panels H and I use the same primers (E1F1/L1R).\n        # Panel H shows 2 bands (450, 419 bp).\n        # Panel I, with more cycles, shows 4 bands in total (450, 419, 378, 187 bp),\n        # revealing 2 new species.
