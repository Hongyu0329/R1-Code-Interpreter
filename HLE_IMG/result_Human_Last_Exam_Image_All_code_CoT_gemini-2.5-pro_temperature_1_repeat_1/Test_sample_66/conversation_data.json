    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Geometry:** I'll analyze the geometric shapes involved. The figure contains a circular sector and two shaded regions which are formed by the difference between polygons and parts of the sector.\n2.  **Symmetry:** The red and blue shaded regions are symmetrical. Therefore, I can calculate the area of one region (e.g., the blue one) and multiply it by two to get the total shaded area.\n3.  **Calculate the Area of the Blue Region:**\n    *   I'll define the vertices of the blue region based on the diagram: the top-left vertex `B`, and two points on the circular arc, `P0` (leftmost) and `P2`.\n    *   The area of this region (bounded by segments `BP0`, `BP2`, and arc `P0P2`) can be found by calculating the area of the polygon `O-P0-B-P2` and subtracting the area of the circular sector `O-P0-P2`.\n    *   The area of the polygon `O-P0-B-P2` can be conveniently calculated as the sum of the areas of triangle `O-P0-B` and triangle `O-B-P2`.\n4.  **Calculate Component Areas:**\n    *   **Triangle `O-P0-B`**: This is a right-angled triangle with legs given as the radius `R = 34` and a length `L = 17`. Its area is `(1/2) * R * L`.\n    *   **Angle `θ`**: This same triangle defines the angle `θ`, where `tan(θ) = L / R = 17 / 34 = 0.5`.\n    *   **Triangle `O-B-P2`**: I will show that this triangle has an area that is also coincidentally equal to `(1/2) * R * L`.\n    *   **Sector `O-P0-P2`**: This sector has a central angle of `2θ`. Its area is `(1/2) * R^2 * (2θ) = R^2 * θ`.\n5.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Area of blue region = `(Area(ΔO-P0-B) + Area(ΔO-B-P2)) - Area(Sector O-P0-P2)`.\n    *   Total Shaded Area = `2 * Area of blue region`.\n    *   I will then write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values from the diagram.\nR = 34  # Radius of the circular sector\nL = 17  # Length of the leg of the right-angled triangle\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the angle theta in radians.\n# From the right-angled triangle, tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent = L/R.\ntheta = math.atan(L / R)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the area of the constituent shapes for one shaded region (e.g., the blue one).\n# The area of the blue shaded region is Area(Polygon O-P0-B-P2) - Area(Sector O-P0-P2).\n\n# Area of Polygon O-P0-B-P2 = Area(Triangle O-P0-B) + Area(Triangle O-B-P2).\n# Area of the first triangle (right-angled)\narea_triangle1 = 0.5 * R * L\n# As shown in the thinking process, the area of the second triangle (O-B-P2) is also (0.5 * R * L).\narea_triangle2 = 0.5 * R * L\n# Area of the polygon is the sum of the two triangles.\narea_polygon = area_triangle1 + area_triangle2\n\n# The area of the sector O-P0-P2 has a central angle of 2*theta.\n# Area = (1/2) * R^2 * (2 * theta) = R^2 * theta.\narea_sector = R**2 * theta\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the area of one shaded region.\narea_one_region = area_polygon - area_sector\n\n# Step 5: The total shaded area is twice the area of one region due to symmetry.\ntotal_area = 2 * area_one_region\n\n# Step 6: Print the final calculation step-by-step with numbers.\n# Total Area = 2 * (Area_Polygon - Area_Sector)\n# Total Area = 2 * ( (Area_Triangle1 + Area_Triangle2) - Area_Sector)\n# Total Area = 2 * ( (289 + 289) - 1156 * arctan(0.5) )\n# Total Area = 2 * ( 578 - 1156 * arctan(0.5) )\n# Total Area = 1156 - 2312 * arctan(0.5)\n\nval1 = 2 * area_polygon\nval2 = 2 * area_sector / theta # This is the coefficient of theta\n\nprint(f\"The total area is calculated by the formula: 2 * (Area_Polygon - Area_Sector)\")\nprint(f\"Area_Polygon for one side = Area_Triangle_1 + Area_Triangle_2 = {area_triangle1} + {area_triangle2} = {area_polygon}\")\nprint(f\"Area_Sector for one side = R^2 * theta = {R**2} * arctan({L}/{R})\")\nprint(f\"Total Area = 2 * ({area_polygon} - {R**2} * arctan({L/R}))\")\nprint(f\"Total Area = {val1} - {val2} * arctan({L/R})\")\nprint(f\"{int(val1)} - {int(val2)} * arctan({L/R}) = {total_area}\")\n\n<<<84.04803113936496>>>"
