    "This is a chemistry problem that can be solved by reasoning about the stability of the molecules. The lifetime of these iridium complexes in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) is directly related to their chemical stability. A more stable complex will resist degradation and thus have a longer lifetime.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structures:** All four complexes are cationic Iridium(III) complexes. They share a common structure: an Iridium center bonded to two identical cyclometalating phenylpyridine (C^N) ligands and one 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (N^N) ligand. The only difference between the four complexes is the substitution on the phenyl rings of the C^N ligands.\n    *   **Complex 1:** Two fluorine atoms at the 2' and 4' positions of each phenyl ring.\n    *   **Complex 2:** One fluorine atom at the 4' position.\n    *   **Complex 3:** One fluorine atom at the 2' position.\n    *   **Complex 4:** No fluorine atoms.\n\n2.  **Relate Structure to Stability:** In organometallic chemistry, the stability of such complexes is heavily influenced by the strength of the metal-ligand bonds, particularly the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond.\n    *   Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom. When attached to the phenyl ring, it acts as a strong electron-withdrawing group.\n    *   This electron-withdrawing effect strengthens the Ir-C bond, making the complex more resistant to electrochemical degradation (e.g., reductive elimination or ligand dissociation). A stronger bond leads to a more stable complex and a longer device lifetime.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Effect of Fluorine Position:**\n    *   The stabilizing effect depends on the number and position of the fluorine atoms.\n    *   **Ortho-position (2'):** Fluorine at the 2'-position (as in Complexes 1 and 3) has a particularly strong stabilizing effect. This is due to a powerful inductive electron-withdrawing effect (being close to the Ir-C bond) and also steric effects that can shield the bond and enforce a rigid, stable geometry.\n    *   **Para-position (4'):** Fluorine at the 4'-position (as in Complexes 1 and 2) also provides stabilization through both inductive and resonance effects, but the effect is generally considered less pronounced than that of an ortho-fluorine.\n    *   **No Fluorine:** Complex 4, with no fluorine atoms, lacks this electronic stabilization and is therefore expected to have the weakest Ir-C bond.\n\n4.  **Rank the Complexes by Stability:** Based on the principles above, we can rank the complexes from most stable to least stable:\n    *   **Most Stable:** Complex 1 (two fluorine atoms, including one at the critical ortho-position).\n    *   **Next Stable:** Complex 3 (one fluorine atom at the ortho-position).\n    *   **Less Stable:** Complex 2 (one fluorine atom at the para-position, no ortho-fluorine).\n    *   **Least Stable:** Complex 4 (no fluorine atoms).\n    *   Stability Ranking: Complex 1 > Complex 3 > Complex 2 > Complex 4.\n\n5.  **Determine Which Have Shorter Lifetimes:** The question asks for the complexes with \"shorter lifetimes\". Since lifetime is proportional to stability, we are looking for the least stable complexes.\n    *   Following our ranking, Complexes 2 and 4 are the least stable. The absence of the highly stabilizing ortho-fluorine atom sets them apart from Complexes 1 and 3. Therefore, Complexes 2 and 4 are expected to have significantly shorter lifetimes.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this reasoning to arrive at the answer.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_complex_stability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the stability of four Iridium complexes based on their fluorination patterns\n    to predict which will have shorter lifetimes in LECs.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the properties of each complex based on the image\n    # We assign a stability score based on fluorination.\n    # Base assumption: Fluorination increases stability.\n    # Refined assumption: Ortho-fluorination (at 2' position) is particularly stabilizing.\n    # Scoring: +2 for ortho-F, +1 for para-F.\n    complexes = {\n        1: {'name': 'Complex 1', 'fluorination': \"2',4'-difluoro\", 'has_ortho_F': True, 'num_F': 2, 'score': 2 + 1},\n        2: {'name': 'Complex 2', 'fluorination': \"4'-fluoro\", 'has_ortho_F': False, 'num_F': 1, 'score': 1},\n        3: {'name': 'Complex 3', 'fluorination': \"2'-fluoro\", 'has_ortho_F': True, 'num_F': 1, 'score': 2},\n        4: {'name': 'Complex 4', 'fluorination': \"none\", 'has_ortho_F': False, 'num_F': 0, 'score': 0},\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Assign stability scores based on fluorination.\")\n    print(\"Scoring rule: +2 for ortho-F, +1 for other F atoms.\")\n    for i in sorted(complexes.keys()):\n        print(f\"  - {complexes[i]['name']} (Fluorination: {complexes[i]['fluorination']}): Score = {complexes[i]['score']}\")\n\n    # Stability is proportional to the score.
