    "My plan is to solve this problem by first deducing the parameters of the Wigner 3-j symbols from the visual information and then using a Python script to perform the calculations.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the matrices:** The problem states these are nine visualizations of Wigner 3-j symbols. A 3-j symbol itself is a scalar value determined by six parameters `(j1, j2, j3, m1, m2, m3)`. A 2D plot implies that two of these parameters are being varied to form a matrix. The standard convention is to fix `j1, j2, j3` and create a matrix by varying `m1` and `m2` over their allowed ranges (`-j <= m <= j`). The value of `m3` is then determined by the constraint `m1 + m2 + m3 = 0`.\n\n2.  **Determine the parameters (j1, j2, j3):**\n    *   By examining the plots (e.g., plot #3 or #9), we can count the number of pixels along the central horizontal or vertical axis. It's approximately 11 pixels.\n    *   The size of the matrix in one dimension (e.g., corresponding to `m1`) is `2*j1 + 1`.\n    *   Setting `2*j1 + 1 = 11`, we find `j1 = 5`. Assuming the plots are for symmetric cases, we'll take `j2 = 5` as well.\n    *   The nine distinct plots most likely correspond to varying the third angular momentum quantum number, `j3`. The simplest sequence is `j3 = 1, 2, ..., 9`. This is a valid range, as `j3` must satisfy the triangle inequality `|j1 - j2| <= j3 <= j1 + j2`, which for our parameters is `0 <= j3 <= 10`.\n\n3.  **Define the Infinity-Norm:** The infinity-norm of a matrix is its maximum absolute row sum. For a matrix `A`, this is calculated as `||A||_inf = max_i Î£_j |A_ij|`.\n\n4.  **Write the Python Script:**\n    *   The script will require the `sympy` library to calculate the Wigner 3-j symbols and `numpy` for efficient matrix operations.\n    *   It will loop through `j3` from 1 to 9.\n    *   Inside the loop, for each `j3`, it will construct an 11x11 matrix by calculating the `wigner_3j(5, 5, j3, m1, m2, -m1-m2)` for all `m1` and `m2` from -5 to 5.\n    *   It will then calculate the infinity-norm for each of the nine matrices.\n    *   Finally, it will find the maximum and minimum values among these nine norms and compute their ratio.\n\n5.  **Output the result:** The script will print the values of the maximum norm, the minimum norm, and the final ratio in an equation format as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sympy.physics.wigner import wigner_3j\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_3j_matrix(j1, j2, j3):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the matrix of Wigner 3-j symbols for given j1, j2, j3,\n    where the matrix is indexed by m1 and m2.\n    \n    The script requires the 'sympy' and 'numpy' libraries.\n    You can install them using: pip install sympy numpy\n    \"\"\"\n    # The range of m quantum numbers for a given j is from -j to +j.\n    m1_vals = np.arange(-j1, j1 + 1)\n    m2_vals = np.arange(-j2, j2 + 1)\n    \n    # Initialize the matrix to store the 3-j symbol values.\n    # The size is (2*j1 + 1) x (2*j2 + 1).\n    matrix = np.zeros((len(m1_vals), len(m2_vals)))\n    \n    # Iterate over all possible m1 and m2 values.\n    for i, m1 in enumerate(m1_vals):\n        for j, m2 in enumerate(m2_vals):\n            # The m3 quantum number is constrained by m1 + m2 + m3 = 0.\n            m3 = -m1 - m2\n            \n            # The sympy function calculates the precise value of the symbol.\n            # It correctly returns 0 if the parameters are invalid.\n            val = wigner_3j(j1, j2, j3, m1, m2, m3)\n            \n            # sympy's wigner_3j can return a symbolic expression.\n            # We evaluate it to a floating-point number.\n            if isinstance(val, sympy.Expr):\n                matrix[i, j] = float(val.evalf())\n            else:\n                matrix[i, j] = float(val)\n                \n    return matrix\n\ndef calculate_infinity_norm(matrix):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the infinity-norm of a matrix, which is the maximum\n    absolute row sum.
