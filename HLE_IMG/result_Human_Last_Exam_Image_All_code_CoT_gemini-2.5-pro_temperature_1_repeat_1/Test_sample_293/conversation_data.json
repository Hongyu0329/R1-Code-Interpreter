    "Based on the histopathological features presented in the image, my plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Image Analysis:** The image displays a renal glomerulus stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E).\n2.  **Identify Key Features:** The most striking abnormality is the presence of a large, crescent-shaped structure filling Bowman's space, which is the space between the glomerular tuft and Bowman's capsule. This \"crescent\" is composed of a proliferation of cells (parietal epithelial cells and infiltrating inflammatory cells like macrophages) and eosinophilic material, likely fibrin. The underlying glomerular tuft is compressed and appears hypercellular.\n3.  **Determine the Diagnosis:** The presence of extensive cellular crescents is the defining characteristic of **Crescentic Glomerulonephritis**. This is a severe form of glomerulonephritis that clinically manifests as Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN), leading to a rapid loss of kidney function.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to state this diagnosis.\n\n```python\ndef get_diagnosis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the histopathological features and returns the diagnosis.\n    \n    The image shows a kidney glomerulus with the following key features:\n    1. A large, cellular, crescent-shaped proliferation of cells within Bowman's space.\n    2. Compression and hypercellularity of the glomerular tuft.\n    3. Presence of eosinophilic fibrin within the crescent.\n    \n    These findings are characteristic of a specific pattern of severe glomerular injury.\n    \"\"\"\n    diagnosis = \"Crescentic Glomerulonephritis\"\n    print(f\"The histopathological diagnosis based on the provided image is: {diagnosis}\")\n\nget_diagnosis()\n```\n<<<Crescentic Glomerulonephritis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the histopathological diagnosis of this image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
