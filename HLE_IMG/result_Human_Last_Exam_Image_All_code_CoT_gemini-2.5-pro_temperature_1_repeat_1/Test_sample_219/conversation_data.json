    "Here is a plan to solve the task:\n1.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts**: Visually inspect the provided raster plot to locate the synchronized bursts. These are the dense, vertical columns where many electrodes fire simultaneously. Estimate the center timestamp for each of these bursts.\n2.  **List Timestamps**: Create a list of the identified timestamps in seconds.\n3.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**: Compute the time difference between each consecutive pair of burst timestamps.\n4.  **Calculate Average IBI**: Sum the calculated intervals and divide by the total number of intervals to find the average.\n5.  **Format Output**: Present the final average rounded to two significant figures, ensuring all the numbers used in the calculation are printed as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef round_to_sf(num, sf):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rounds a number to a specified number of significant figures.\n    \"\"\"\n    if num == 0:\n        return 0\n    # Use 'g' format specifier for significant figures\n    return float(f\"{num:.{sf}g}\")\n\n# 1.
