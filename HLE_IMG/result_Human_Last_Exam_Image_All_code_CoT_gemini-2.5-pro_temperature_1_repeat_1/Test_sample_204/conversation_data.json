    "My plan is to solve this problem in three steps:\n1.  **Identify the mineral** for each specimen (A, B, C, D) based on its visual characteristics like color, crystal habit, and cleavage.\n2.  **Determine the silicate structural class** for each identified mineral. Silicate minerals are classified based on the arrangement of silica tetrahedra (SiO4), which determines their complexity. The main classes, in order of increasing complexity (polymerization), are: Nesosilicates (isolated tetrahedra), Sorosilicates (double tetrahedra), Cyclosilicates (rings), Inosilicates (chains), Phyllosilicates (sheets), and Tectosilicates (frameworks).\n3.  **Order the specimens** from the least complex silicate structure to the most complex.\n\n**Step-by-step mineral identification and classification:**\n\n*   **Specimen C:** This is a mass of small, olive-green, granular crystals. This is the characteristic appearance of **Olivine**. Olivine is a **Nesosilicate**, representing the simplest silicate structure with isolated [SiO4] tetrahedra.\n*   **Specimen A:** This is a dark, stubby, prismatic crystal. This crystal habit is typical of the **Pyroxene** group (e.g., Augite). Pyroxenes are **Inosilicates** (single chain), which are more complex than Nesosilicates.\n*   **Specimen B:** This specimen is thin, flaky, and has a layered appearance, indicating perfect basal cleavage. This is characteristic of mica group minerals like muscovite or biotite, or other sheet silicates like chlorite. These are all **Phyllosilicates** (sheet silicates), which are more complex than chain silicates.\n*   **Specimen D:** This is a well-formed, translucent, six-sided (hexagonal) crystal. This is a classic example of **Quartz**. Quartz is a **Tectosilicate** (framework silicate), where all oxygen atoms in the tetrahedra are shared, forming the most complex and strongly bonded silicate structure.\n\n**Ordering by Complexity:**\n\n1.  **C (Olivine):** Nesosilicate (least complex)\n2.  **A (Pyroxene):** Inosilicate\n3.  **B (Mica):** Phyllosilicate\n4.  **D (Quartz):** Tectosilicate (most complex)\n\nThe final order of increasing silicate structure complexity is C, A, B, D.\n\nI will now generate Python code to display this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mineral_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies mineral specimens, classifies their silicate structure,\n    and orders them by increasing structural complexity.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data for each specimen based on visual identification and geological knowledge.\n    # Complexity is ranked from 1 (least complex) to 4 (most complex).\n    specimens = [\n        {'label': 'A', 'mineral': 'Pyroxene', 'structure': 'Inosilicate (Single Chain)', 'complexity_rank': 2},\n        {'label': 'B', 'mineral': 'Mica', 'structure': 'Phyllosilicate (Sheet)', 'complexity_rank': 3},\n        {'label': 'C', 'mineral': 'Olivine', 'structure': 'Nesosilicate (Isolated Tetrahedra)', 'complexity_rank': 1},\n        {'label': 'D', 'mineral': 'Quartz', 'structure': 'Tectosilicate (Framework)', 'complexity_rank': 4}\n    ]\n\n    # Sort the specimens based on their complexity rank\n    sorted_specimens = sorted(specimens, key=lambda x: x['complexity_rank'])\n\n    print(\"Identification of Specimens and their Silicate Structures:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    for specimen in specimens:\n        print(f\"Specimen {specimen['label']}: Identified as {specimen['mineral']}, a {specimen['structure']}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Get the final ordered list of labels\n    ordered_labels = [s['label'] for s in sorted_specimens]\n\n    print(\"\\nSpecimens ordered by increasing silicate structure complexity:\")\n    # The prompt asks to \"output each number in the final equation\", which is interpreted here\n    # as printing the final sequence clearly.\n    final_order_string = \", \".join(ordered_labels)\n    print(final_order_string)\n\nsolve_mineral_complexity()\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>\n```"
