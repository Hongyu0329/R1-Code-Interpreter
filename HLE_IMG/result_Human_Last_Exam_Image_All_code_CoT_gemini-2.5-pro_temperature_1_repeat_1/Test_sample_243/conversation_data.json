    "My analysis of the image suggests that the plant is *Helwingia formosana*, also known as the Net-veined Helwingia. The specific epithet \"formosana\" refers to Formosa, which is the historical name for the island of Taiwan. Therefore, this plant is endemic to Taiwan.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to output the name of the island.\n\n```python\n# The plant identified in the image is Helwingia formosana.\n# The epithet 'formosana' indicates its origin.\n# Formosa is the historical name for a specific island.\n\ndef find_endemic_island():\n  \"\"\"\n  Prints the name of the island where Helwingia formosana is endemic.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The name of the island is derived from the plant's scientific name.\n  island_name = \"Taiwan\"\n  print(f\"The plant is endemic to the island of: {island_name}\")\n\nfind_endemic_island()\n```\n<<<Taiwan>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
