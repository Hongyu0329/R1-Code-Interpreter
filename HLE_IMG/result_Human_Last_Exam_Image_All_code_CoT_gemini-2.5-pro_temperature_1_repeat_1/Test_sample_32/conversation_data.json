    "The user wants to know the primary visual difference between the sporophytes of two moss species: *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Identify the key parts of a moss sporophyte: the capsule (which holds the spores) and the seta (the stalk that holds the capsule).\n2.  Research the typical sporophyte morphology for *Grimmia montana*.\n3.  Research the typical sporophyte morphology for *Grimmia curviseta*, paying attention to its species name, which often provides a clue (*curvi* = curved, *seta* = stalk).\n4.  Compare the two descriptions to find the most striking and easily observable difference.\n5.  Create a Python script that prints this explanation, as requested by the user's instructions.\n\n**Execution:**\n*   *Grimmia montana* is characterized by having a very short, straight seta. This causes the capsule to be \"immersed\" or \"emergent,\" meaning it sits nestled upright among the leaves, as seen in the provided image.\n*   *Grimmia curviseta*, as its name implies, has a distinctly curved or S-shaped seta. This causes its capsule to be \"cernuous\" (nodding) or \"pendulous\" (hanging down), rather than erect.\n\nThis difference in the seta's curvature and the resulting orientation of the capsule is the main feature used to distinguish the two species at a glance when they are producing sporophytes.\n\n```python\ndef explain_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the key difference in the sporophyte\n    between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n    \"\"\"\n    difference_explanation = (\n        \"The main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta, \"\n        \"which helps distinguish them at a glance, is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule).\\n\\n\"\n        \"1. Grimmia montana: Has a very short and straight seta. This results in a capsule that is \"\n        \"erect and immersed or emergent among the leaves.\\n\\n\"\n        \"2. Grimmia curviseta: The species name 'curviseta' means 'curved seta'. It has a \"\n        \"distinctly long and curved or S-shaped seta, which causes the capsule to be nodding or pendulous (hanging down).\"\n    )\n    print(difference_explanation)\n\nexplain_difference()\n```\n<<<The main difference is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, resulting in an erect and immersed capsule. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is distinctly curved or S-shaped, causing the capsule to be nodding or pendulous.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
