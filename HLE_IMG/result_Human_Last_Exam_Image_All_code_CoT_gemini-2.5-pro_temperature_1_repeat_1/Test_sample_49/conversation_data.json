    "To determine the cutoff frequency at node `a_0`, we first need to find the Thevenin equivalent resistance, `R_th`, seen by the capacitor `C`. The cutoff frequency, `\\omega_c`, for this RC circuit is then given by the formula `\\omega_c = 1 / (R_th * C)`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to find `R_th`:\n1.  **Deactivate Sources:** To find the Thevenin resistance, we deactivate all independent sources. The input `IN` at node `c_0` is a voltage source, so we replace it with a short circuit to ground. This means the potential at `c_0` is 0.\n2.  **Apply Test Voltage:** We apply a test voltage `V` at node `a_0` and calculate the current `I` that flows from this source into the node. The Thevenin resistance will be `R_th = V / I`.\n3.  **Nodal Analysis:** The circuit is an infinite ladder of resistors. We can write down the Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) equations for the potentials at each node. Let `u_n` be the potential at node `c_n` and `v_n` be the potential at node `d_n`.\n4.  **Solve Recurrence Relations:** The KCL equations form a system of linear difference equations (or recurrence relations). We solve this system for the potentials `u_n` and `v_n`.\n    *   The general solution is a superposition of characteristic modes.\n    *   We apply the boundary condition that potentials must remain finite as `n` approaches infinity, which means we only consider decaying modes.\n    *   We use the specific KCL equations at nodes `c_1` and `d_1` (which are connected to the grounded `c_0` and the test source at `a_0`) to solve for the unknown coefficients in our general solution.\n5.  **Calculate R_th:** Once we find the potential `v_1` at node `d_1`, we can calculate the current `I = (V - v_1) / r`. From this, we find `R_th`.\n6.  **Calculate Cutoff Frequency:** With `R_th`, we find `\\omega_c = 1 / (R_th * C)`.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform these symbolic calculations and derive the final expression for the cutoff frequency.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_cutoff_frequency():\n    \"\"\"\n    Symbolically calculates the cutoff frequency of the given infinite ladder network.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define all symbolic variables\n    # r and C are the resistance and capacitance.
