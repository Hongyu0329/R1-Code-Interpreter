# The task is to identify the giraffe from the options (A, B, C, D, E, F)
# that matches the target giraffe.
# By carefully comparing the unique spot patterns on the torso and neck of the giraffes,
# we can find the correct match.

# Step 1: Analyze the spot pattern of the Target giraffe.
# Notice the specific arrangement of spots on the shoulder, the mid-body, and along the spine.

# Step 2: Compare the target's pattern with each option.
# - Option A has a much lighter, yellowish coat and different spot shapes.
# - Option C has a similar light coat and the pattern doesn't align.
# - Option D has significantly darker and larger spots.
# - Option E's pattern along the back consists of smaller, more numerous spots.
# - Option F has more faded and less angular spots.
# - Option B's spot pattern is a clear match. The key clusters of spots on the shoulder,
#   mid-torso, and along the back are identical in shape and relative position to the target giraffe.

# Step 3: Conclude the correct option.
correct_option = 'B'

# Step 4: Print the final answer.
print(f"The image that shows the same giraffe as the target is: {correct_option}")
