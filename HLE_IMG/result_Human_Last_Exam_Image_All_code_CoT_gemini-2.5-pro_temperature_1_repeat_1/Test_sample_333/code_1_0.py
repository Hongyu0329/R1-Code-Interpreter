# This script provides the solution by codifying the reasoning explained above.

# The matching is based on analyzing airfoil geometry and its effect on the pressure distribution.
# 1. Lift (represented by the area in the Cp plot) increases with airfoil camber.
# 2. The suction peak (the maximum negative Cp value) is strongly influenced by airfoil thickness and leading-edge radius.

# We determined the pairings for each airfoil from A to H.
# The following variables store the plot number for each corresponding airfoil.

# Thin Airfoil Group (A, B, C, D) matched with Low Lift Plots (1, 2, 4, 8)
match_A = 1
match_B = 8
match_C = 4
match_D = 2

# Thick Airfoil Group (E, F, G, H) matched with High Lift Plots (3, 5, 6, 7)
match_E = 7
match_F = 6
match_G = 5
match_H = 3

# The problem asks for the sequence of plot numbers corresponding to the airfoils in alphabetical order (A-H).
# The following code prints each individual pairing and then assembles the final sequence.

print("The determined pairing for each airfoil is:")
print(f"Airfoil A corresponds to Plot {match_A}")
print(f"Airfoil B corresponds to Plot {match_B}")
print(f"Airfoil C corresponds to Plot {match_C}")
print(f"Airfoil D corresponds to Plot {match_D}")
print(f"Airfoil E corresponds to Plot {match_E}")
print(f"Airfoil F corresponds to Plot {match_F}")
print(f"Airfoil G corresponds to Plot {match_G}")
print(f"Airfoil H corresponds to Plot {match_H}")

# Assemble the final sequence string as requested in the answer format.
final_sequence = f"{match_A}{match_B}{match_C}{match_D}{match_E}{match_F}{match_G}{match_H}"

print("\nThe final sequence is:")
print(final_sequence)
