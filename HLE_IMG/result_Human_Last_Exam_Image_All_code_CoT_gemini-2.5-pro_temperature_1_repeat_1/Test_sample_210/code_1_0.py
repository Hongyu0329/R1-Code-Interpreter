    This function analyzes the features of the target nyala and compares them to the options to find a match.

    Method:
    1.  Identify unique features of the Target animal. Key features are horn shape and the pattern of white spots on the rear flank. The target has a distinct crescent-shaped cluster of spots.
    2.  Compare these features against each option (A, B, C, D, E, F).
    3.  Image D displays a nyala with an identical horn shape and, crucially, a spot pattern on the flank that perfectly matches the target's crescent-shaped cluster.
    4.  Other images are ruled out due to differences in age (A), markings (E), or poor visibility (C, F).
