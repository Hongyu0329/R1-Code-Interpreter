    This function identifies the matching bird image.
    
    1. The target bird has a fine, dense scalloped pattern on its back.
    2. The posture shows the bird's back with its head turned slightly to its right.
    3. Image G has a nearly identical feather pattern.
    4. Crucially, the posture, including the curve of the back and the turn of the head in image G, is a perfect match for the target image.
    5. Other images differ in pattern density, coloration, or posture.
    
    Therefore, G is the correct answer.
