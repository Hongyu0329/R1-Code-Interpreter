    "Here is my plan to determine the IUPAC name of the compound:\n1.  **Molecular Formula Determination:** I will use the molecular ion peak (M+) from the Mass Spectrum to determine the molecular weight. I will apply the nitrogen rule (an odd molecular weight suggests an odd number of nitrogen atoms) to propose a molecular formula. I will then calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) to infer the presence of rings or double/triple bonds.\n2.  **Functional Group Analysis (IR):** I will examine the IR spectrum to identify characteristic absorption bands for functional groups, such as N-H (amines), aromatic C-H, aliphatic C-H, and C=C bonds in a benzene ring. I'll also look for the substitution pattern on the benzene ring from the out-of-plane bending region.\n3.  **Carbon Skeleton Analysis (¹³C NMR & DEPT-135):** I will analyze the ¹³C NMR spectrum to count the number of unique carbon environments. By combining this with the DEPT-135 data, I will determine the exact number of quaternary (C), methine (CH), methylene (CH₂), and methyl (CH₃) carbons in the molecule.\n4.  **Proton Environment and Connectivity Analysis (¹H NMR & HSQC):** I will interpret the ¹H NMR spectrum, paying close attention to chemical shifts, integration values (number of protons), and splitting patterns (coupling) to deduce the structure of different fragments. The HSQC spectrum will be crucial to directly link protons to the carbons they are attached to, confirming fragment structures like -CH₃, -CH₂, and -CH.\n5.  **Structure Assembly and Verification:** I will piece together the fragments identified from the various spectra (e.g., a monosubstituted phenyl group, an amine group, and an aliphatic chain) to build a complete molecular structure. I will verify that this proposed structure is fully consistent with all the provided data (¹H, ¹³C, DEPT, HSQC, IR, and MS). I will also address any apparent contradictions, such as the mass spectrum's base peak, by weighing the evidence from all techniques.\n6.  **IUPAC Nomenclature:** Once the correct structure is determined, I will apply the IUPAC rules to assign the systematic name to the compound.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef analyze_compound_spectra():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Store data in a structured way\n    data = {\n        \"MS\": {\"M+\": 135, \"base_peak\": 30},\n        \"IR_bands\": [\"~3300-3400 (N-H?)\", \">3000 (Aromatic C-H)\", \"<3000 (Aliphatic C-H)\", \"~1600, 1450-1500 (Aromatic C=C)\", \"~700, 740 (Monosubstituted Benzene)\"],\n        \"13C_NMR\": [145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2],\n        \"DEPT-135\": {\"negative\": 1, \"positive\": 5},\n        \"1H_NMR\": {\n            \"~7.2 ppm\": {\"integration\": 5, \"multiplicity\": \"multiplet\", \"protons\": \"C6H5-\"},\n            \"~2.8 ppm\": {\"integration\": 2, \"multiplicity\": \"multiplet\", \"protons\": \"-CH2-\"},\n            \"~2.7 ppm\": {\"integration\": 1, \"multiplicity\": \"multiplet\", \"protons\": \"-CH-\"},\n            \"~1.2 ppm\": {\"integration\": 3, \"multiplicity\": \"doublet\", \"protons\": \"-CH3\"}\n        },\n        \"HSQC_correlations\": {\n            \"H(~1.2)\": \"C(~19)\",\n            \"H(~2.7)\": \"C(~50)\",\n            \"H(~2.8)\": \"C(~43)\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Molecular Formula Determination\")\n    mw = data[\"MS\"][\"M+\"]\n    print(f\"The Mass Spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = {mw}.\")\n    print(\"According to the nitrogen rule, an odd molecular weight suggests an odd number of nitrogen atoms.
