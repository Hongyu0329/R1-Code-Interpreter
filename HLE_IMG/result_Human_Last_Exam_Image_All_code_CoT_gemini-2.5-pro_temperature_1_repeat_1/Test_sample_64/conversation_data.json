    "The image displays a series of micrographs (L, M, N) showing a filament of cells, likely from a fungus or alga, over time.\n\n*   In panel **L**, the filament is straight and the cells appear turgid (filled with water, creating internal pressure against the cell wall). The arrowhead points to a septum, the cross-wall between two adjacent cells.\n*   In panel **M**, the filament begins to bend. The arrowhead points to the same septum, where a noticeable bulge is forming. This indicates a loss of structural integrity at this point.\n*   In panel **N**, the bending is more severe, and the bulge at the septum is more pronounced.\n\nThis sequence illustrates the process of **plasmolysis**. Plasmolysis is the process where the cell's protoplast (the cell membrane and its contents) shrinks and pulls away from the cell wall due to the loss of water. In a filamentous structure like this, the loss of turgor pressure in the cells causes the filament to lose its rigidity and buckle, particularly at weaker points like the septa between cells. The bulging seen is a characteristic result of the mechanical stress on the cell wall as turgor is lost.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to know the process depicted in the image.\n# The image shows a sequence (L -> M -> N) of a cell filament bending and deforming.\n# This is a characteristic result of water loss from the cells, leading to a decrease in turgor pressure.\n# This biological process is known as plasmolysis.\n\nprocess_name = \"Plasmolysis\"\nexplanation = \"The image shows a filament of cells losing turgor pressure, causing the protoplast to shrink and the filament to buckle. This process is known as plasmolysis.\"\n\nprint(f\"The process being depicted in the image is: {process_name}\")\n```\n<<<Plasmolysis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
