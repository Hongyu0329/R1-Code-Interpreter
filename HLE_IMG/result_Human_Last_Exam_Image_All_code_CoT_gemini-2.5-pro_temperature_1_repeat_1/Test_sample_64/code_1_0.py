# The user wants to know the process depicted in the image.
# The image shows a sequence (L -> M -> N) of a cell filament bending and deforming.
# This is a characteristic result of water loss from the cells, leading to a decrease in turgor pressure.
# This biological process is known as plasmolysis.
