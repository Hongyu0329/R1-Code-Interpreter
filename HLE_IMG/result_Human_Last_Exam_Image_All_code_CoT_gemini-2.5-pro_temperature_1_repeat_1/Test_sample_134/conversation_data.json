    "Based on my analysis of the molecular structure provided in the image, the molecule is a large, cyclic hydrocarbon, a type of carbon nanohoop. I have determined its composition and repeating units to identify it.\n\nThe structure consists of six `para-phenylene` rings (`-C6H4-`) that are connected by six identical linker units. Each linker is a `hexa-3-en-1,5-diynylene` group (`-C≡C-CH=CH-C≡C-`).\n\nTherefore, the molecule is a macrocycle formed by six repeating `C12H6` units, leading to a total molecular formula of `C72H36`.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name and molecular formula of the molecule.\n\n```python\ndef identify_molecule():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the molecule from the image and prints its name and formula.\n    The molecule is a cyclic hexamer of para-phenylene and hexa-3-en-1,5-diynylene units.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the components of the name\n    cycle_size = 6\n    phenylene_unit = \"para-phenylene\"\n    linker_unit = \"hexa-3-en-1,5-diynylene\"\n    \n    # Construct the descriptive name\n    molecule_name = f\"Cyclo[{cycle_size}]{phenylene_unit}({linker_unit})\"\n    \n    # Define the atom counts for the formula\n    carbon_atoms = 72\n    hydrogen_atoms = 36\n    \n    # Construct the molecular formula string\n    molecular_formula = f\"C{carbon_atoms}H{hydrogen_atoms}\"\n\n    print(f\"Molecule Name: {molecule_name}\")\n    print(f\"Molecular Formula: {molecular_formula}\")\n\nidentify_molecule()\n```\n<<<Cyclo[6]para-phenylene(hexa-3-en-1,5-diynylene)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name the molecule.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
