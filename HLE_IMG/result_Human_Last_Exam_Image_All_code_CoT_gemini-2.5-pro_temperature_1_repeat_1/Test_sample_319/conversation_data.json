    "The image you've provided illustrates a well-known auditory illusion. The top part is a spectrogram showing sound frequency over time, and the bottom part is the corresponding waveform. Initially, we see a pure tone (a single frequency). This tone is then interrupted by a short burst of noise (the vertical smear). Despite the tone being physically absent during the noise, a listener typically perceives the tone as continuing uninterrupted *through* the noise. The brain \"fills in\" the missing auditory information.\n\nI will provide the name of this phenomenon using a simple Python script as requested.\n\n```python\ndef get_phenomenon_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function returns the name of the auditory illusion depicted in the image.\n  The illusion is the perceptual \"filling-in\" of a sound that has been\n  interrupted by another sound, such as a burst of noise.\n  \"\"\"\n  # This effect is known as the phonemic restoration effect when dealing with speech,\n  # but the more general term for any sound is the Auditory Continuity Illusion.\n  phenomenon_name = \"Auditory continuity illusion\"\n  return phenomenon_name\n\n# Print the name of the phenomenon\nname = get_phenomenon_name()\nprint(f\"The name of the phenomenon shown in the image is: {name}\")\n\n```\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion>>>"
