    "This is a multi-step puzzle that connects sports, history, and chemistry.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Image and the First Clue**\n*   The image shows two men at an awards ceremony. The man on the right is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov, a professional ice hockey player.\n*   The date mentioned, June 20, 2019, corresponds to the 2019 NHL Awards ceremony where Kucherov was a major winner.\n*   That season, Kucherov won three major individual awards: the Art Ross Trophy (top scorer), the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), and the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player voted by peers). Winning three major accolades like this is often referred to as a \"hat trick\" of awards.\n*   Therefore, \"X Y\" being pictured at this event refers to the concept of a **Hat Trick**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Second Clue**\n*   The second clue states, \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This points to the historical process of felt hat manufacturing. Mercury(II) nitrate, a mercury salt, was used in a process called \"carroting\" to treat animal fur for making felt.\n*   This process was highly toxic, leading to mercury poisoning among hat makers, which gave rise to the expression \"mad as a hatter\". Due to its toxicity, this method is no longer used.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the Clues**\n*   The term \"hat trick\" originated in the sport of cricket, where a player who achieved a notable feat (like taking three wickets with three consecutive balls) was rewarded with a new hat.\n*   The puzzle creates a clever link between the modern, metaphorical \"hat trick\" of awards won by Nikita Kucherov and the historical \"trick\" (or method) of making the physical hats that gave the term its name. The old hat-making \"trick\" involving mercury has ceased, fitting the second clue perfectly.\n*   Therefore, X Y is **Hat Trick**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves the riddle by identifying the two meanings of \"Hat Trick\".\n    1. The metaphorical \"hat trick\" of awards won by Nikita Kucherov at the 2019 NHL Awards.\n    2. The historical origin of the term, linked to hats made with a now-obsolete toxic mercury process.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    x = \"Hat\"\n    y = \"Trick\"\n    \n    print(f\"The answer is {x} {y}.\")\n\nsolve_puzzle()\n```\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
