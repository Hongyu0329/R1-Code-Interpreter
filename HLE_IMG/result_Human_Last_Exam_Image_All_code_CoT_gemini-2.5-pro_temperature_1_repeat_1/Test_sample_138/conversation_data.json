    "This is a task of identifying the biological sexes of insects based on visual cues. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze Pair A:** The insects in pair A are cuckoo bees, likely of the genus *Coelioxys*. In this genus, females have a sharply pointed, conical abdomen which they use to lay eggs in the nests of other bees. Males have a less pointed abdomen that ends in multiple small spines or prongs.\n    *   The insect on the left has a very sharp, pointed abdomen, characteristic of a **female**.\n    *   The insect on the right has an abdomen tip that appears to have multiple prongs (though it's slightly obscured), which is characteristic of a **male**.\n    *   Therefore, pair A is Female, Male (F, M), which corresponds to option **4**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Pair B:** The insects in pair B are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. A common way to differentiate sexes in these wasps is by their antennae.\n    *   The wasp on the left has antennae with distinctly curled or hooked tips. This is a classic trait of **male** paper wasps.\n    *   The wasp on the right has straight antennae without curled tips, which is characteristic of a **female**.\n    *   Therefore, pair B is Male, Female (M, F), which corresponds to option **3**.\n\n3.  **Analyze Pair C:** The insects in pair C are long-horned bees (tribe Eucerini). The name itself is a clue.\n    *   The bee on the left has extremely long antennae, a defining characteristic of **males** in this group. It also has a yellow patch on its face (the clypeus), which is another common male trait in many bee species.\n    *   The bee on the right has much shorter antennae, which is typical for a **female**. Its face is dark, lacking the yellow clypeus.\n    *   Therefore, pair C is Male, Female (M, F), which corresponds to option **3**.\n\n4.  **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    *   A: F, M -> 4\n    *   B: M, F -> 3\n    *   C: M, F -> 3\n    The final sequence of indices is 4, 3, 3. I will now generate a Python script to print this result.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify the biological sexes of three pairs of insects (A, B, C)\n# and provide the corresponding index from the given list of options.\n#\n# Options:\n# 1) M, M\n# 2) F, F\n# 3) M, F\n# 4) F, M\n#\n# Analysis:\n# - Pair A (Cuckoo Bees): The left insect has a pointed abdomen (female ovipositor). The right insect has a pronged abdomen tip (male). So, A is F, M. This is option 4.\n# - Pair B (Paper Wasps): The left insect has curled antennae (male). The right insect has straight antennae (female). So, B is M, F. This is option 3.\n# - Pair C (Long-horned Bees): The left insect has very long antennae and a yellow face (male). The right insect has short antennae and a dark face (female). So, C is M, F. This is option 3.\n\n# Assign the identified indices to variables.\nindex_A = 4\nindex_B = 3\nindex_C = 3\n\n# Print the final result in the format \"A, B, C\".\nprint(f\"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}\")\n```\n<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
