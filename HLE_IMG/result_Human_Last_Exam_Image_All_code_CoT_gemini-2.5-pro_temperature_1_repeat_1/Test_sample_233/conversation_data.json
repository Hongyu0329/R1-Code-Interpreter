    "Based on my analysis of the image, I can identify the specific runestone.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this:\n1.  The query identifies the stone as an \"Ingvar runestone,\" a known category of Viking Age artifacts commemorating Ingvar the Far-Travelled's expedition.\n2.  I will analyze the unique visual characteristics of the runic inscription in the provided image. The most notable feature is that the runes are carved within a strict grid of horizontal and vertical lines, which is a relatively uncommon style.\n3.  By comparing this distinctive style with documented Ingvar runestones, I can pinpoint a specific match.\n4.  The fragment shown in the image corresponds to the runestone cataloged as **Sö 137**, located at Ludgo Church in Södermanland, Sweden.\n5.  I will write a Python script to declare the province code and the number of the runestone and then print the full ID.\n\n```python\ndef get_runestone_id():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the ID of the Ingvar runestone.\n    The identification is based on the unique grid-like inscription pattern,\n    which matches the known fragment Sö 137.\n    \"\"\"\n    province_code = \"Sö\"\n    stone_number = 137\n    \n    # The full ID combines the province code and the number.\n    runestone_id = f\"{province_code} {stone_number}\"\n    \n    print(f\"The ID of the Ingvar runestone is: {runestone_id}\")\n    print(f\"The number in the ID is: {stone_number}\")\n\nget_runestone_id()\n```\n<<<Sö 137>>>"
