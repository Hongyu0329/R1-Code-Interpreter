def solve_vortex_puzzle():
    """
    This function prints the solution to the vortex trajectory puzzle.
    The solution is a 16-character string derived from analyzing each plot.
    
    B/b: Blue vortex is twice/half strength
    G/g: Green vortex is twice/half strength
    R/r: Red vortex is twice/half strength
    
    The logic for each plot is as follows:
    1: G (Green is central, stronger)
    2: B (Blue is central, stronger)
    3: G (Green is more confined in chaos, stronger)
    4: r (Red is flung out, weaker)
    5: B (Blue is central, stronger)
    6: G (Green is central, stronger)
    7: B (Blue is more confined in chaos, stronger)
    8: r (Red is flung out, weaker)
    9: g (Green is advected by R-B pair, weaker)
    10: R (Red is central, stronger)
    11: G (Green is more confined in chaos, stronger)
    12: B (Blue is central, stronger)
    13: b (Blue is advected by R-G pair, weaker)
    14: b (Blue is advected by R-G pair, weaker)
    15: R (Red is more confined in chaos, stronger)
    16: G (Green is central, stronger)
