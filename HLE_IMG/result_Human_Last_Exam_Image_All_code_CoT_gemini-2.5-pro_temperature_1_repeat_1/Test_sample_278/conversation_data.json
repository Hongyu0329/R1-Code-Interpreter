    "The image shows a micrograph of a tissue sample, likely stained with Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), which stains fungi magenta/pink and the background tissue blue/green.\n\nBased on the visual evidence:\n\n*   **Type of Microorganism:** The organisms observed are fungi. Specifically, they are a type of yeast.\n*   **Morphology:** The fungus is exhibiting dimorphism, meaning it is present in two forms simultaneously:\n    1.  **Yeast cells:** These are the small, oval, dark pink/purple structures. Many of these cells show evidence of budding, which is a form of asexual reproduction where a daughter cell grows out from the parent cell.\n    2.  **Pseudohyphae:** These are the elongated, filament-like structures. They are formed when budding yeast cells elongate but fail to detach, forming a chain. They can be distinguished from true hyphae by the characteristic constrictions at the septations (points where the cells join), giving them a \"sausage-link\" appearance.\n\nThis combination of budding yeast cells and pseudohyphae is a classic presentation of *Candida* species, particularly *Candida albicans*, in an invasive infection.\n\n<<<The image shows a dimorphic fungus, likely a *Candida* species. The morphology observed consists of both round-to-oval budding yeast cells and elongated filamentous structures known as pseudohyphae.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Based on the image of a stain viewed under a light microscope, classify what is observed in terms of morphology and type of microorganism\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
