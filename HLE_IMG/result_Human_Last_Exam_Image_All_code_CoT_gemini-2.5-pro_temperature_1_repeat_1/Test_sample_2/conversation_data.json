    "To determine the time complexity of the given sorting algorithm, we need to analyze its structure and how the number of operations grows with the input size `n`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Case:** The recursion stops when `n <= 1`. The work done in this case is constant, `O(1)`, as it only involves checking the condition `n > 1`. So, `T(1) = O(1)`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Recursive Step:** For `n > 1`, the function `sort(a, n)` performs the following operations:\n    *   It makes one recursive call: `sort(a, n - 1)`.\n    *   It performs a comparison and a potential swap, which takes constant time, `O(1)`.\n    *   It makes a second recursive call: `sort(a, n - 1)`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation:** Let `T(n)` be the time taken by the algorithm for an input of size `n`. Based on the steps above, we can write the recurrence relation:\n    `T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1) + T(n - 1)`\n    Simplifying this gives:\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant representing the `O(1)` work).\n\n4.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:** We can solve this by expansion (also known as the substitution method).\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    *   Substitute `T(n - 1) = 2 * T(n - 2) + c`:\n        `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n    *   Substitute `T(n - 2) = 2 * T(n - 3) + c`:\n        `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 3c`\n\n    We can see a pattern emerging. After `k` steps of expansion:\n    `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n\n    The recursion stops when `n - k = 1`, which means `k = n - 1`. Substituting this back into the equation:\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-2) + ... + 2^0)`\n\n    The second term is a geometric series sum: `Î£(from i=0 to n-2) 2^i = (2^(n-1) - 1) / (2 - 1) = 2^(n-1) - 1`.\n\n    So, the equation becomes:\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n\n5.  **Determine the Big-O Complexity:** Since `T(1)` is a constant, the expression simplifies to:\n    `T(n) = const * 2^(n-1) + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n    `T(n) = (const + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\n    As `n` becomes large, the dominant term is `2^(n-1)`, which is of the order `O(2^n)`.\n\nThis structure is famously associated with the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, which also has a time complexity of `O(2^n)`. Therefore, the worst-case time complexity of this sorting algorithm is exponential.\n\nThe following Python code will print this step-by-step derivation.\n\n```python\ndef explain_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the step-by-step derivation of the time complexity for the given algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the time complexity of the provided sorting algorithm.\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Define the recurrence relation based on the algorithm's structure.\")\n    print(\"The function sort(a, n) makes two recursive calls to sort(a, n - 1) and performs a constant amount of work (a comparison and a potential swap) in between.\")\n    print(\"Let T(n) be the time complexity for an input of size n.\")\n    print(\"The recurrence relation is: T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1) + T(n - 1)\")\n    print(\"Which simplifies to: T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c (where c is a constant)\")\n    print(\"The base case is T(1) = O(1), which we can also denote by a constant, d.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Solve the recurrence relation by expansion.\")\n    print(\"T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c\")\n    print(\"     = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c\")\n    print(\"     = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2*c + c\")\n    print(\"     = 2^2 * T(n - 2) + (2^1 + 2^0)*c\")\n    print(\"     = 2^2 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + (2^1 + 2^0)*c\")\n    print(\"     = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4*c + 2*c + c\")\n    print(\"     = 2^3 * T(n - 3) + (2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0)*c\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Generalize the pattern.\")\n    print(\"After k steps of expansion, we get:\")\n    print(\"T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^0)\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Solve for the base case.\")\n    print(\"The recursion stops when n - k = 1, so k = n - 1.\")\n    print(\"Substitute k = n - 1 into the generalized equation:\")\n    print(\"T(n) = 2^(n - 1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n - 2) + ... + 2^0)\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe sum is a geometric series: (2^(n-1) - 1) / (2 - 1) = 2^(n-1) - 1.\")\n    print(\"Substituting this back, and using T(1) = d:\")\n    print(\"T(n) = 2^(n - 1) * d + c * (2^(n - 1) - 1)\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 5: Determine the Big-O notation.\")\n    print(\"T(n) = d * 2^(n - 1) + c * 2^(n - 1) - c\")\n    print(\"T(n) = (d + c) * 2^(n-1) - c\")\n    print(\"As n grows, the dominant term is 2^(n-1).\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the time complexity is O(2^n).\")\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    explain_complexity()\n    print(\"\\n<<<E>>>\")\n\n```\n<<<E>>>"
