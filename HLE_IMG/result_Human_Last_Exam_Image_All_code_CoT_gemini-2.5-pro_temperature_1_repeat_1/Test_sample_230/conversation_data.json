    "Based on a visual analysis and reverse image search, the painting is identified as a work by the Polish artist January Suchodolski from the 19th century. The painting depicts a historical event, the Battle of Fuengirola, which took place in 1810. The artwork itself was created around 1839. The most common title for this piece is \"The Battle of Fuengirola\".\n\nI will now provide a Python script to output this title.\n\n```python\ndef get_painting_title():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function returns the title of the identified painting.\n  \"\"\"\n  title = \"The Battle of Fuengirola\"\n  artist = \"January Suchodolski\"\n  year = \"c. 1839\"\n  \n  print(f\"The title of the painting is: {title}\")\n\nget_painting_title()\n```\n<<<The Battle of Fuengirola>>>"
