    "I will analyze the provided ECG to determine the correct diagnosis.\n\n**ECG Analysis Plan:**\n1.  **Rhythm Analysis:** I will examine the R-R intervals to determine if the rhythm is regular or irregular.\n2.  **Heart Rate Calculation:** I will estimate the ventricular rate.\n3.  **QRS Complex Evaluation:** I will assess the duration (width) and morphology (shape) of the QRS complexes.\n4.  **Atrial Activity Assessment:** I will look for P waves to determine the atrial origin of the rhythm.\n5.  **Synthesis and Differential Diagnosis:** I will combine these findings to arrive at the most likely diagnosis, considering and ruling out the other options provided.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the ECG characteristics to arrive at a diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"ECG Analysis Steps:\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Rhythm Analysis\")\n    print(\"The R-R intervals (the distance between consecutive QRS complexes) are clearly variable and have no repeating pattern.\")\n    print(\"This indicates an 'irregularly irregular' rhythm, which is the hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation (AFib).\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Heart Rate Analysis\")\n    print(\"The rhythm is very fast (tachycardic), with an average rate well over 150 beats per minute.\")\n    print(\"Some beats occur at rates exceeding 200-250 bpm (e.g., where R-R interval is just over one large box).\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: QRS Complex Analysis\")\n    print(\"The QRS complexes are wide (duration > 0.12 seconds or 3 small squares).\")\n    print(\"Crucially, the morphology (shape) of the QRS complexes is not uniform; it changes from beat to beat.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the diagnosis according to this ECG image?\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA.
