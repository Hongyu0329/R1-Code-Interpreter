    "This is a view of a property located at 435 South Stone Jug Road. I will use this address to find the corresponding town and then verify its population.\n\n1.  **Geolocate the address**: The address \"435 South Stone Jug Road\" is located in Rochelle, Illinois.\n2.  **Find the population**: I will search for the population of Rochelle, Illinois.
