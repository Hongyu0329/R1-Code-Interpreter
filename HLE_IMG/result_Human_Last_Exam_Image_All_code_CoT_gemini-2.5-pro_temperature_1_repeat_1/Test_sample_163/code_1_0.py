# The problem asks to identify the two major products, A and B, of the given reaction.
# As explained in the reasoning, the reaction is a radical 1,2-difunctionalization of styrene.
# The two products are regioisomers. We will define them using their chemical names and SMILES strings.

# Product A is formed when the tert-butoxy radical adds first, followed by trapping with the benzoyloxy radical.
product_A_name = "1-benzoyloxy-2-tert-butoxy-1-phenylethane"
product_A_smiles = "c1ccccc1C(OC(=O)c2ccccc2)COC(C)(C)C"

# Product B is formed when the benzoyloxy radical adds first, followed by trapping with the tert-butoxy radical.
product_B_name = "2-benzoyloxy-1-tert-butoxy-1-phenylethane"
product_B_smiles = "c1ccccc1C(OC(C)(C)C)COC(=O)c2ccccc2"

# Print the results
print("The two major products, A and B, are constitutional isomers formed by the 1,2-addition of the tert-butoxy and benzoyloxy groups across the styrene double bond.")
