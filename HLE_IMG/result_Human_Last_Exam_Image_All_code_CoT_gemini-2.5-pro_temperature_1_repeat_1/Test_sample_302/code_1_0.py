# The seal contains four characters in ancient Chinese Seal Script.
# The traditional reading order for a four-character seal is top-to-bottom, right-to-left.
# 1. Top-right character: 長 (cháng)
# 2. Bottom-right character: 樂 (lè)
# 3. Top-left character: 未 (wèi)
# 4. Bottom-left character: 央 (yāng)

# The phrase is 長樂未央 (Cháng Lè Wèi Yāng), which means "Eternal joy without end."
# Now, we convert these traditional characters to simplified Chinese.

char1_simplified = "长"
char2_simplified = "乐"
char3_simplified = "未"
char4_simplified = "央"
