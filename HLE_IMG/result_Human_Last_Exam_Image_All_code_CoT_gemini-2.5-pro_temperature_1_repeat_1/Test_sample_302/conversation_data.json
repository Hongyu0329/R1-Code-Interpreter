    "My plan is to identify the ancient Chinese characters on the seal, determine the reading order, and then provide the corresponding simplified Chinese characters.\n\n1.  **Seal Script Identification**: The characters are in an ancient style known as Seal Script (篆書, zhuànshū).\n2.  **Reading Order**: Chinese seals are traditionally read from top to bottom, and from right to left.\n3.  **Character Analysis**:\n    *   **Top-Right Character**: This is the seal script for **長** (cháng), meaning \"long\" or \"eternal\".\n    *   **Bottom-Right Character**: This is the seal script for **樂** (lè), meaning \"joy\" or \"happiness\".\n    *   **Top-Left Character**: This is the seal script for **未** (wèi), meaning \"not yet\" or \"never\".\n    *   **Bottom-Left Character**: This is the seal script for **央** (yāng), meaning \"end\" or \"center\".\n4.  **Putting it Together**: The phrase reads **長樂未央** (Cháng Lè Wèi Yāng). This is a famous classical Chinese expression meaning \"eternal joy without end\".\n5.  **Conversion to Simplified Chinese**:\n    *   長 becomes **长**\n    *   樂 becomes **乐**\n    *   未 remains **未**\n    *   央 remains **央**\n6.  **Final Result**: The simplified Chinese characters are **长乐未央**. I will now generate a Python script to print this result.\n\n```python\n# The seal contains four characters in ancient Chinese Seal Script.\n# The traditional reading order for a four-character seal is top-to-bottom, right-to-left.\n# 1. Top-right character: 長 (cháng)\n# 2. Bottom-right character: 樂 (lè)\n# 3. Top-left character: 未 (wèi)\n# 4. Bottom-left character: 央 (yāng)\n\n# The phrase is 長樂未央 (Cháng Lè Wèi Yāng), which means \"Eternal joy without end.\"\n# Now, we convert these traditional characters to simplified Chinese.\n\nchar1_simplified = \"长\"\nchar2_simplified = \"乐\"\nchar3_simplified = \"未\"\nchar4_simplified = \"央\"\n\nprint(f\"The characters on the seal in simplified Chinese are: {char1_simplified}{char2_simplified}{char3_simplified}{char4_simplified}\")\n```\n<<<长乐未央>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What's the character content on the seal in simplified Chinese?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
