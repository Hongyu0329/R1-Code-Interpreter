    "To determine the Roman numeral for the circled notes, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Key:** The piece is Mozart's Fantasy in D minor. The key signature has one flat (B♭), which corresponds to either F major or D minor. Given the title, the key is D minor.\n2.  **Identify the Notes:** Let's examine the notes within the circle in measure 8.\n    *   The notes are in the bass clef, played by the left hand.\n    *   The lowest note is on the first space, which is A.\n    *   The middle note is in the second space, which is C. There is a sharp sign (♯) next to it, making it C♯.\n    *   The highest note is in the third space, which is E.\n3.  **Form the Chord:** The notes played together are A, C♯, and E. These notes form an A major triad.\n4.  **Determine the Roman Numeral:** In the key of D minor, the tonic is D. The fifth scale degree (the dominant) is A. The triad built on the dominant is typically major (using the leading tone, C♯, from the harmonic or ascending melodic minor scale) to create a strong pull back to the tonic. The chord A-C#-E is the major dominant chord.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The chord is an A major triad, which is the dominant (V) chord in the key of D minor. Since it's a major chord, we use an uppercase Roman numeral.\n\n```python\ndef solve_music_theory():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the steps to identify the Roman numeral for the given chord.\n    \"\"\"\n    key = \"D minor\"\n    notes_in_chord = [\"A\", \"C#\", \"E\"]\n    chord_name = \"A major\"\n    scale_degree = 5\n    roman_numeral = \"V\"\n\n    print(f\"1.
