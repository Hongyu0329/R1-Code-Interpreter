def solve_cellular_automaton():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the cellular automaton puzzle.
    The solution was determined by the following steps:
    1. Analyzing the size of each pattern to establish a rough chronological order.
    2. Identifying four distinct 4-step evolutionary sequences based on visual similarity and logical progression (e.g., growth, pattern transformation).
       - Sequence 1: G -> L -> A -> N
       - Sequence 2: H -> O -> M -> P
       - Sequence 3: C -> F -> E -> B
       - Sequence 4: K -> J -> D -> I
    3. Assigning each sequence to a rule (Rule 1 to Rule 4) based on their starting times and patterns.
       - Rule 1 (starts t=2) must correspond to the sequence starting with the smallest pattern (G), so R1 = GLAN.
       - The remaining sequences (starting with H, C, K) were assigned to Rules 2, 3, and 4 based on a plausible order of increasing complexity of their initial patterns (H < C < K).
       - This led to the assignment: R2=HOMP, R3=CFEB, R4=KJDI.
    4. Formatting the final answer as a single string.
