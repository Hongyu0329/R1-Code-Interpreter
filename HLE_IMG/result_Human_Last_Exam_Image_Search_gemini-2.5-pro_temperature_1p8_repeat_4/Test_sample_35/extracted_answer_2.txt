Based on the provided information, the protein S100B demonstrates a strong affinity for the V-domain of the RAGE receptor. Given that its levels correlate with the severity and progression across multiple neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and multiple sclerosis, it could be used as a prognostic marker. However, due to its presence in various conditions and non-brain sources, it is more accurately used as an adjunct marker in conjunction with other clinical tests rather than solely for diagnosis. Therefore, it functions as both but is particularly valuable for its prognostic capabilities.
