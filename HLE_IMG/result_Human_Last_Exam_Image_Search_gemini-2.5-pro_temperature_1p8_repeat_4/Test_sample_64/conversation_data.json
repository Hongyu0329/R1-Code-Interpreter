    "The image depicts a process known as **hyphal fusion** or **anastomosis** in a filamentous fungus.\n\nThe three panels, labeled L, M, and N, show a time-lapse sequence of this biological event under a microscope. In filamentous fungi, the colony is a network of filament-shaped cells called hyphae, which are often divided by cross-walls called septa. These septa typically have pores that allow cytoplasm and organelles to move between adjacent compartments.\n\nThe process shown in the image can be broken down as follows:\n*   **Panel L:** This panel shows two adjacent hyphal compartments separated by an intact septum, which is indicated by the arrowhead.\n*   **Panel M:** The process of fusion begins. The cell walls at the septum start to break down. The arrowhead points to the dissolving septum where a pore is beginning to form.\n*   **Panel N:** The fusion is complete. A clear pore has formed in the septum, creating a continuous channel between the two cells. This allows for the flow of cytoplasm, nutrients, and even nuclei between the compartments, transforming the separate filaments into an interconnected network.\n\nThis process of anastomosis is crucial for filamentous fungi. It facilitates communication and the transport of resources throughout the mycelium (the entire fungal network), which is essential for growth, development, and adaptation to the environment. Fungi can form specialized branches called fusion hyphae that grow towards each other and fuse. The entire process involves several stages, including attraction, contact, and finally, fusion.\n\nIn some cases, specialized organelles called Woronin bodies are present near the septal pores in ascomycete fungi. These bodies can rapidly plug the pores in response to cellular injury, preventing the loss of cytoplasm from the damaged hypha.\n\n<<<hyphal fusion (anastomosis)>>>"
