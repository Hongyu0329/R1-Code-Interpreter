The XRD pattern of pure and vanadium-doped CuO nanoparticles was analyzed to index the most prominent peaks. Based on reference data for monoclinic CuO, the peaks at approximately 32.5°, 35.6°, 38.7°, 48.7°, 53.5°, and 58.3° correspond to the (110), (002)/(-111), (111)/(200), (-202), (020), and (202) crystallographic planes, respectively.

| Approximate 2θ (degree) | (h k l) Index |
| :--- | :--- |
| ~32.5° | (110) |
| ~35.6° | (002) / (-111) |
| ~38.7° | (111) / (200) |
| ~48.7° | (-202) |
| ~53.5° | (020) |
| ~58.3° | (202) |
