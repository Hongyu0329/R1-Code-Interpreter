    "The circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasia in D minor, K. 397 form a V7 chord.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the harmonic analysis:\n*   **Key Signature:** The piece is in D minor.\n*   **Notes:** The notes played in measure 8 across both hands are A, C-sharp, E, and G.\n*   **Chord Identification:** These notes spell out an A dominant seventh chord (A7). The bass clef plays a low A, establishing it as the root of the chord.\n*   **Function in D minor:** The fifth scale degree, or dominant, of D minor is A. Therefore, an A7 chord functions as the dominant seventh chord in this key. The C-sharp is the raised leading tone, which creates a strong pull toward the tonic, D.\n\nThis V7 chord resolves to the tonic chord (D minor) in the following passage, which is a standard harmonic progression. Music analysts confirm that the harmony in this section works its way to the dominant, which is then followed by the Adagio section starting back in the home key of D minor.\n\n<<<V7>>>"
