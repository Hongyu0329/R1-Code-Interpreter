    "The scientific name of the animal depicted in the center of the image is *Lygaeus kalmii*. This insect is commonly known as the small milkweed bug.\n\nThe small milkweed bug is characterized by its distinct orange and black markings. The pattern includes a reddish-orange \"X\" on its back and a band of the same color across the section between its head and wings. Its head is black with a red spot.\n\nWhile it is named for the milkweed plant, the small milkweed bug also feeds on a variety of other plants, including goldenrod, which appears to be the plant in the photograph. This species is found throughout North America.\n\nThere are two recognized subspecies: *Lygaeus kalmii angustomarginatus* (the eastern small milkweed bug) and *Lygaeus kalmii kalmii* (the western small milkweed bug).\n\n<<<*Lygaeus kalmii*>>>"
