    "Based on the visual evidence of a mountainous, arid landscape, the unincorporated community in the image is identified as Jacumba Hot Springs in San Diego County, California.\n\nAccording to the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), as referenced by multiple sources, the elevation of Jacumba Hot Springs is 2,829 feet. This figure is also mentioned in a kids' educational article. Other sources provide slightly varied elevations, with one stating it is \"almost 2,800 feet\" and another mentioning 2,800 feet. A lifestyle magazine article gives a slightly higher estimate of 3,000 feet. The most precise and frequently cited figure, however, is 2,829 feet, which converts to approximately 862 meters.\n\nThe name of the community was officially changed from Jacumba to Jacumba Hot Springs in 2013. It is known for its natural mineral hot springs, which have been a draw for visitors for over a century. The town is located near the US-Mexico border and is situated in the Jacumba Mountains.\n\n<<<862>>>"
