    "This rearrangement reaction is a classic example of an acid-catalyzed Wagner-Meerwein backbone rearrangement commonly observed in pentacyclic triterpenoids. The reaction starts with the protonation of the hydroxyl group on the starting material, followed by the loss of water to form a carbocation. This initiates a cascade of shifts of hydrogen atoms and methyl groups along the molecular backbone, ultimately leading to the formation of a stable alkene product after the elimination of a proton.\n\nBy carefully observing the provided structure of the final product, the substituents at the numbered positions can be directly determined. The numbers in grey circles point to specific carbon atoms on the steroid backbone, and the question asks to identify the substituent (either a methyl group, CH3, or a hydrogen atom, H) at each of these positions.\n\nHere is the determination for each position:\n\n*   **Position 1:** The circle highlights a bridgehead carbon at the junction of two rings. This carbon atom has an axial methyl group (CH3) attached to it.\n*   **Position 2:** The circle points to another bridgehead carbon, which bears a methyl group (CH3).\n*   **Position 3:** This circle is centered on a different bridgehead carbon atom, which is bonded to a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **Position 4:** This numbered position indicates a bridgehead carbon that has a methyl group (CH3) as its substituent.\n*   **Position 5:** This circle highlights a bridgehead carbon atom bonded to a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nTherefore, based on a direct analysis of the final product's chemical structure as depicted in the image:\n\n1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
