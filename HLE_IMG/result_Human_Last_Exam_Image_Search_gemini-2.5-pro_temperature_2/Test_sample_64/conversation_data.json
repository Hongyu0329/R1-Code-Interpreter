    "The images depict the process of lateral branching in a filamentous fungus.\n\nHere is a step-by-step description of what is happening in the images:\n\n*   **Image L:** This panel shows a mature hypha, which is a long, branching, filamentous structure that is the main mode of growth for most fungi. The arrowhead points to a septum, which is an internal cross-wall that divides the hypha into individual cells.\n*   **Image M:** At the site of the septum pointed out in image L, a new outgrowth, or branch, has begun to form. The arrowhead indicates this initial bulge, which is the start of a new lateral branch.\n*   **Image N:** The newly formed branch, indicated by the arrowhead, has elongated. This illustrates how fungi expand their network, known as a mycelium, to explore and absorb nutrients from their environment.\n\nThis process of forming new branches from the side of existing hyphae is known as lateral branching and is a fundamental aspect of fungal growth and colony development. In contrast to apical branching, where the tip of a hypha splits, lateral branching allows for the expansion and increased surface area of the mycelial network from sub-apical cells.<<<The process depicted is hyphal branching, a form of vegetative growth in fungi.>>>"
