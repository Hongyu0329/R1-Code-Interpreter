    "The epiphytic species in the image belongs to the genus ***Frullania***.\n\nThis is a type of leafy liverwort. The organism's appearance, characterized by its dark, almost black coloration when dry and its intricate, branching, mat-like growth on the tree bark, is highly characteristic of this genus. *Frullania* species are common epiphytes found on tree bark in humid environments. Though they can be green, they often turn a dark reddish-brown, purplish, or nearly black color, especially in drier conditions or in the cold, making them more noticeable. The delicate, branching pattern seen in the photo is typical for many species within this large genus.\n\n<<<Frullania>>>"
