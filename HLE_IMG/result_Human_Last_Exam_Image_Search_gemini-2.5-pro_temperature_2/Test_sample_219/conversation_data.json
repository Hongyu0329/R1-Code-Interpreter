    "The synchronized bursts, which appear as vertical bands of high firing activity across many electrodes, are located at approximately the following timestamps:\n*   Burst 1: ~3 s\n*   Burst 2: ~16 s\n*   Burst 3: ~26 s\n*   Burst 4: ~36 s\n*   Burst 5: ~49 s\n\nThe inter-burst intervals (the time between the start of consecutive bursts) are calculated as follows:\n*   Interval 1: 16 s - 3 s = 13 s\n*   Interval 2: 26 s - 16 s = 10 s\n*   Interval 3: 36 s - 26 s = 10 s\n*   Interval 4: 49 s - 36 s = 13 s\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is the mean of these intervals:\nAverage = (13 + 10 + 10 + 13) / 4 = 46 / 4 = 11.5 s\n\nRounding to two significant figures, the average inter-burst interval is 12 s.\n\n<<<12>>>"
