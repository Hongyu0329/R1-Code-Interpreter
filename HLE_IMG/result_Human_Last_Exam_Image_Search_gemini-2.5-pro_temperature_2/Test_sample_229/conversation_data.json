    "The sheet music provided is for the song **\"Belleville\"**.\n\n### **Title, Musical Style, and Origin**\n\n*   **Title:** Belleville\n*   **Musical Style:** Gypsy Jazz (also known as Jazz Manouche or Hot Club Jazz)\n*   **Country of Origin:** The song was composed by Django Reinhardt, a Belgian-born Romani-French jazz guitarist. It is strongly associated with the jazz scene in Paris, France, particularly the Belleville neighborhood which inspired the composition.\n\n### **About the Song and Composer**\n\n\"Belleville\" is one of Django Reinhardt's popular compositions and has become a standard in the gypsy jazz repertoire. Reinhardt, along with violinist St√©phane Grappelli, formed the Paris-based Quintette du Hot Club de France in 1934, which was among the first jazz groups to feature the guitar as a lead instrument. Gypsy jazz is characterized by its string-based instrumentation, often including lead and rhythm guitars, violin, and bass.\n\nThe neighborhood of Belleville in Paris, known for its vibrant and diverse culture, was the inspiration for this upbeat song.\n\n<<<**Title:** Belleville\n**Musical Style:** Gypsy Jazz\n**Country of Origin:** France/Belgium>>>"
