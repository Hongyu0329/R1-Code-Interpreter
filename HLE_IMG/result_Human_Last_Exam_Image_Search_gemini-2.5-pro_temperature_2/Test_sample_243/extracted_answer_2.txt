Based on the provided image and search results, the plant is likely *Psychotria nuda*, which is primarily found in Brazil and not endemic to a specific island. An alternative identification, *Helwingia japonica*, has a subspecies endemic to the Ryukyu Archipelago of Japan, but it's uncertain if that is the exact plant pictured.
