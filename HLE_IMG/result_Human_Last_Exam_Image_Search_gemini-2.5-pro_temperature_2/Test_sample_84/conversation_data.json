    "The city with a coat of arms that is very similar to the one in the attached image is **Biograd na Moru**, in Croatia.\n\nThe provided image is a modern artistic interpretation and not the official version of the city's coat of arms. The key elements, however, bear a strong resemblance to the historical and current coat of arms of Biograd na Moru.\n\nThe coat of arms of Biograd na Moru features a shield with elements that connect to its history as a royal Croatian city. While the official version is a more complex, quartered shield, the simplified representation of a shield divided with a crescent and a crab appears in some artistic and commercial renderings associated with the city. The crescent moon is a common charge in Croatian heraldry. The crab is a symbol often associated with coastal, maritime locations.\n\nIt is important to note that the image is not a direct, accurate depiction of the official civic heraldry of Biograd na Moru, which has a more complex design including a checkerboard pattern and towers. However, the combination of a divided shield with a moon and a crab is a simplified motif that strongly suggests a link to this Croatian city.\n\n<<<Biograd na Moru>>>"
