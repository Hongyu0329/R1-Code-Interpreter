    "The figure leaving the chariot is Hippodamia, the daughter of King Oenomaus of Pisa.\n\nThis Apulian red-figure pelike depicts a scene from the Greek myth of Pelops and Hippodamia. The driver of the chariot, identifiable by his Phrygian cap and elaborate costume, is Pelops. The man lying defeated on the ground is Hippodamia's father, King Oenomaus.\n\nThe myth recounts that King Oenomaus, fearing a prophecy that he would be killed by his son-in-law, challenged all of his daughter's suitors to a deadly chariot race. Pelops, determined to marry the beautiful Hippodamia, accepted the challenge. In most versions of the tale, Pelops wins not only through skill but by bribing Oenomaus's charioteer, Myrtilus, to sabotage the king's chariot by replacing the bronze linchpins with ones made of wax. During the race, the wax melted, Oenomaus's chariot fell apart, and he was dragged to his death by his horses.\n\nThe vase captures the moment of victory for Pelops and Hippodamia. Pelops is shown in the chariot he used to win the race, sometimes depicted as a gift from Poseidon, while his vanquished and deceased father-in-law lies on the ground. Hippodamia is seen beside Pelops, departing with her new husband. This particular story, illustrating the triumph of Pelops and his union with Hippodamia, was a known theme in 4th-century BCE vase painting. Another Apulian vase, for example, shows Pelops and Hippodamia in a chariot arriving to comfort the mourning Niobe, who was Pelops' sister.\n\n<<<Hippodamia>>>"
