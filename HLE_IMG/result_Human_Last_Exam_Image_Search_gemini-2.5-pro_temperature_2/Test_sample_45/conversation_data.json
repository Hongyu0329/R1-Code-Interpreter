    "The tiling shown in the image has **7-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\nThis can be determined by observing the repeating motifs within the pattern. At the center of the main image, and at various other points, there are distinct rosettes where the pattern radiates outwards. If you pick the center of one of these rosettes, you can rotate the entire pattern by an angle of 360/7 degrees (approximately 51.4 degrees), and it will look identical to its original state. This is because each tile in the pattern will map onto an identical tile after the rotation. For instance, each of the seven dark blue heptagons surrounding a central point will move to the position of its neighbor.\n\nThis type of symmetry is a hallmark of aperiodic tilings, also known as quasicrystals. Unlike standard periodic tilings (like a simple checkerboard or hexagonal honeycomb), which can only have 2, 3, 4, or 6-fold rotational symmetry according to the crystallographic restriction theorem, aperiodic tilings can exhibit symmetries that are forbidden in periodic crystals, such as the 7-fold symmetry seen here. These patterns are ordered and can fill a plane without gaps, but they lack translational symmetry, meaning they do not repeat in a simple, periodic way. The construction of tilings with 7-fold symmetry has been a subject of mathematical research, often involving specific sets of tiles like rhombi that can be assembled according to particular rules.\n\n<<<7-fold>>>"
