    "Based on a comprehensive analysis of the provided Mass Spectrum, IR, ¹³C NMR, DEPT-135, ¹H NMR, and HSQC data, the compound is identified as 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n\n### **Analysis Summary**\n\n*   **Molecular Formula and Weight:** The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M+) at an m/z of 135. The odd molecular weight is indicative of a compound containing an odd number of nitrogen atoms, most likely one. A chemical formula of C₉H₁₃N corresponds to a molecular weight of 135.21 g/mol and has four degrees of unsaturation, consistent with the presence of a benzene ring.\n*   **Functional Groups (IR Spectrum):** The IR spectrum displays key absorptions that suggest the presence of:\n    *   An N-H bond from a primary or secondary amine (broad peak ~3300-3400 cm⁻¹).\n    *   Aromatic C-H bonds (peaks > 3000 cm⁻¹).\n    *   Aliphatic C-H bonds (peaks < 3000 cm⁻¹).\n    *   Aromatic C=C double bonds (~1600 cm⁻¹ and 1450-1500 cm⁻¹).\n    The absence of a strong peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ rules out the presence of a carbonyl group.\n*   **Carbon Skeleton (¹³C NMR and DEPT-135):**\n    *   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows seven distinct carbon environments. Four of these are in the aromatic region (126.3 to 145.1 ppm) and three are in the aliphatic region (19.2, 43.5, and 49.6 ppm).\n    *   The DEPT-135 data confirms the presence of one methylene (CH₂) group (one negative signal), and a total of five methyl (CH₃) and methine (CH) groups (five positive signals).\n    *   This combination perfectly accounts for all the observed signals: three aromatic CH groups, one aliphatic CH, one aliphatic CH₃, one aliphatic CH₂, and one quaternary aromatic carbon (which is invisible in DEPT).\n*   **Proton Environment and Connectivity (¹H NMR and HSQC):**\n    *   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows a multiplet for five protons in the aromatic region (C₆H₅–).\n    *   In the aliphatic region, a three-proton doublet (~1.2 ppm) indicates a methyl group adjacent to a single proton (-CH-CH₃).\n    *   A two-proton multiplet (~2.5 ppm) and a one-proton multiplet (~2.8 ppm) correspond to the -CH₂- and -CH- groups, respectively.\n    *   The HSQC spectrum definitively connects the proton signals to their respective carbon signals, establishing the structure as `Ph-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃`. Specifically, it shows the 1H multiplet is attached to the carbon at 49.6 ppm (C-N) and the 2H multiplet is attached to the carbon at 43.5 ppm (Ph-C).\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll spectroscopic evidence converges to a single structure. The parent chain is propane, with an amine group on the second carbon and a phenyl group on the first carbon. A search of existing spectral data for 1-phenylpropan-2-amine confirms that the provided spectra match the expected values for this compound.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
