    "The characters on the seal are a four-character Chinese idiom. Read in the traditional order, from top to bottom and right to left, the characters are 寧靜致遠.\n\nIn simplified Chinese, this is written as 宁静致远.\n\nThe phrase \"宁静致远\" (níng jìng zhì yuǎn) translates to \"tranquility yields transcendence\" or \"a quiet life of profound study\". It originates from the \"Admonition to My Son\" (誡子書) by the famous strategist Zhuge Liang of the Three Kingdoms period. The full context is \"non-indifference cannot clarify ambition, and non-tranquility cannot achieve far-reaching goals\" (非澹泊無以明志，非寧靜無以致遠). It signifies that only through inner peace and a simple, tranquil life can one achieve clarity of purpose and accomplish long-term goals.\n\n<<<宁静致远>>>"
