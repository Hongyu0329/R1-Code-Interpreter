    "Based on numismatic evidence, archaeologists attribute this medallion to the 6th century A.D.\n\nThe artifact is a coin, specifically a pentanummium or a similar denomination, from the Byzantine Empire. It depicts Emperor Justin I and his nephew and co-ruler, Justinian I. Their joint reign, during which such coins showing two facing rulers were issued, occurred for a brief period in the year 527 A.D. Justin I reigned from 518 to 527 A.D., and upon his death, Justinian I became the sole emperor, ruling until 565 A.D. Coins and medallions from this era are well-documented, often featuring Latin inscriptions and symbols of Christian authority, like the cross.\n\n<<<6th century A.D.>>>"
