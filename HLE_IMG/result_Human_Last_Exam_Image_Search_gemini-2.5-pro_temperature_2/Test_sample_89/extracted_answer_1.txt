Here are the structures of the three products, A, B, and C:

**Product A** is formed via a Huisgen cycloaddition followed by fragmentation and subsequent reaction of the liberated dihydropyrrole fragment. The resulting structure is **N-(4-oxobutyl)acetamide**.

    end
    style id1 fill:#fff,stroke:#fff
```

**Product B** results from a Michael addition of the intermediate to methyl propiolate, followed by an intramolecular cyclization and fragmentation. The structure is a bicyclic pyrrolizinone derivative, **methyl 2-(3-oxo-hexahydro-1H-pyrrolizin-2-yl)acrylate**.

**Product C** is formed through a Dakin-West type reaction pathway involving acylation by acetic anhydride and subsequent fragmentation. This pathway results in the formation of **N-acetylpyrrolidine**.
