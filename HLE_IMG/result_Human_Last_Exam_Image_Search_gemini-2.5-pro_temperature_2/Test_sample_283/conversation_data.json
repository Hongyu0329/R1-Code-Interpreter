    "Based on the annually recurring peaks in the Google Trends data, the country in question is **Italy**. The three trend lines correspond to the anniversaries of significant 20th-century Italian historical events.\n\nHere is a detailed analysis of the events represented by each colored line on the graph:\n\n*   **Yellow Line (Festa della Repubblica / Republic Day):** The sharpest and highest peaks on the graph consistently occur in early June. This timing aligns with Italy's National Day, the Festa della Repubblica, which is celebrated on June 2nd. This holiday commemorates the 1946 institutional referendum when the Italian populace voted to abolish the monarchy and establish a republic. The main celebrations, including a large military parade, take place in Rome.\n\n*   **Blue Line (Festa della Liberazione / Liberation Day):** The blue line shows consistent peaks every year around late April. This corresponds to Italy's Liberation Day on April 25th. This national holiday marks the end of the Nazi occupation and the fall of the fascist regime in 1945, celebrating the victory of the Italian Resistance movement.\n\n*   **Red Line (Giorno del Ricordo / National Memorial Day of the Exiles and Foibe):** The red line displays prominent spikes in February of each year. This timing matches the \"Giorno del Ricordo,\" a national memorial day observed on February 10th. It commemorates the victims of the \"Foibe\" massacres and the exodus of Italians from Istria, Fiume, and Dalmatia during and after World War II.\n\nThe distinct and regular timing of these three search trends, all pointing to major historical commemorations in Italy, makes it evident to a historian that the country is Italy.\n\n<<<Italy>>>"
