    "**Diagnosis: Aspergillosis of the sella turcica**\n\nThe histopathological image provided, in the clinical context of a 28-year-old female with a mass in the sella turcica, is diagnostic of aspergillosis.\n\n### Microscopic Findings\nThe key feature in the provided image is the presence of fungal organisms. These organisms are seen as septate hyphae, meaning they have cross-walls dividing the fungal filaments into distinct cells. Furthermore, the hyphae exhibit acute-angle (approximately 45-degree) dichotomous branching. This specific morphology is a classic and identifiable feature of *Aspergillus* species. The fungal elements are surrounded by a dense infiltrate of inflammatory cells, indicating an active infection and host response. The presence of necrotic debris is also noted in some areas.\n\n### Clinical Correlation\nFungal infections involving the pituitary gland are rare but are an important consideration in the differential diagnosis of a sellar mass. These infections often arise from the extension of fungal sinusitis, particularly from the adjacent sphenoid sinus. *Aspergillus* is the most commonly identified fungus in such cases.\n\nPatients can present with symptoms that mimic a pituitary tumor, such as headaches, visual disturbances, and hormonal abnormalities. For this reason, the definitive diagnosis often relies on histopathological examination of the excised tissue, as clinical and radiological findings can be non-specific.\n\nWhile invasive fungal infections are more common in immunocompromised individuals, pituitary aspergillosis has been reported in immunocompetent patients as well. Surgical removal of the infected tissue followed by intensive antifungal therapy is the standard treatment.\n\nIn summary, the histopathological evidence of septate, acute-angle branching hyphae, combined with the clinical presentation of a sellar mass, confirms a diagnosis of pituitary aspergillosis.\n\n<<<Aspergillosis"
