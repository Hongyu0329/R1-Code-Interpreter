    "This is the sheet music for \"To Zanarkand,\" the opening theme from the video game *Final Fantasy X*. The piece was originally composed by Nobuo Uematsu and arranged for piano by Masashi Hamauzu for the *Final Fantasy X Piano Collections* album.\n\nThe sheet music shown is a faithful transcription of this piano arrangement, known for its beautiful and melancholic melody which gives way to dramatic, powerful arpeggiated sections, reflecting the game's emotional tone. Several versions and arrangements of the sheet music are available online for piano and other instruments.\n\n<<<To Zanarkand from Final Fantasy X>>>"
