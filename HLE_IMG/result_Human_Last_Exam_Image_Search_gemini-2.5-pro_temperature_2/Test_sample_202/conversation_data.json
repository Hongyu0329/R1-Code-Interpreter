    "Based on the visual characteristics of the rock specimens, the following identifications can be made:\n\n*   **Specimen H is Scoria.** This rock is reddish-brown and highly vesicular, meaning it is full of gas bubbles which are now holes in the rock. Its color is likely due to the oxidation of iron. Scoria is an extrusive igneous rock, formed from frothy lava that has cooled.\n\n*   **Specimen I is Breccia.** This rock is composed of large, angular fragments of other rocks that have been cemented together. This particular type could be a volcanic breccia, which is formed from the compaction of lava chunks and ash from a volcanic eruption.\n\n*   **Specimen J is Pumice.** This is a light-colored, lightweight volcanic rock. Its porous and frothy appearance is due to a large number of gas bubbles that were trapped as the lava cooled very quickly. Pumice is so full of these vesicles that it can often float on water.\n\n*   **Specimen K is Pegmatite.** This is an intrusive igneous rock characterized by its very large, interlocking crystals. This coarse-grained texture indicates that the magma cooled very slowly deep beneath the Earth's surface, which allowed large crystals of minerals like feldspar and quartz to form.\n\n<<<\nH: Scoria\nI: Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite\n>>>"
