    "### Analysis of the Sorting Algorithm\n\nThe provided pseudocode for the `sort(a, n)` function is a recursive algorithm. To determine its time complexity, we can analyze its structure and formulate a recurrence relation.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n```python\ndef sort(a, n):\n  if n > 1:\n    # 1. First recursive call\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n\n    # 2. Comparison and potential swap\n    if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n      swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])\n\n    # 3. Second recursive call\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n```\n\nLet `T(n)` represent the time taken by the algorithm for an input of size `n`.\n\n1.  **Base Case:** When `n <= 1`, the `if` condition is false, and the function does nothing, which takes constant time, `O(1)`.\n2.  **Recursive Step:** For `n > 1`, the function performs three main operations:\n    *   It calls itself with the size `n - 1`: `sort(a, n - 1)`. This takes `T(n - 1)` time.\n    *   It performs a comparison and an optional swap. These are constant time operations, `O(1)`.\n    *   It calls itself again with the size `n - 1`: `sort(a, n - 1)`. This also takes `T(n - 1)` time.\n\nThe total time `T(n)` can be expressed by the following recurrence relation:\n`T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + O(1)`\nThis simplifies to:\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant)\n\nThis recurrence relation is characteristic of algorithms that, for a problem of size `n`, solve two subproblems of size `n-1`. This pattern is famously seen in the Tower of Hanoi problem.\n\nLet's solve the recurrence by expansion:\n*   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n*   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 3c`\n*   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 7c`\n*   ...\n*   After `k` steps: `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + (2^k - 1) * c`\n\nIf we continue until the base case `T(1)`, we set `k = n - 1`:\n*   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-1) - 1) * c`\nSince `T(1)` is a constant, let's call it `c'`:\n*   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c' + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n*   `T(n) = (c' + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\nThe dominant term in this expression is `(c' + c) * 2^(n-1)`, which shows that the function `T(n)` grows exponentially with `n`. Therefore, the time complexity of the algorithm is `O(2^n)`.\n\nThe provided options are:\nA. O(n)\nB. O(n log n)\nC. O(n^2)\nD. O(n^3)\nE. O(2^n)\nF. does not terminate\n\nBased on the analysis of the recurrence relation, the worst-case time complexity is exponential. The recursion has a clear base case (`n <= 1`), so the algorithm will always terminate.\n\n<<<E>>>"
