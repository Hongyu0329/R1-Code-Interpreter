    "The primary difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that allows for their distinction at a glance is the shape of the seta, the stalk that supports the capsule.\n\nIn *Grimmia montana*, the sporophyte features a short, straight, and erect seta. This gives the capsule an upright orientation relative to the moss cushion.\n\nConversely, *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by a curved or bent seta, a feature suggested by its specific epithet \"*curviseta*\". This curvature results in the capsule being buried within the cushion or positioned at an angle, rather than being held straight up. The orientation of the seta, being either straight (erect) or curved (arcuate), is a significant diagnostic characteristic used in keys for identifying different species within the genus *Grimmia*.\n\n<<<The main distinguishing feature of the sporophyte is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a curved seta.>>>"
