    "**The ancient square structure shown in the image is the archaeological site of Loma Seca (Chihuahua E7-5), a significant historical landmark located in the municipality of Ojinaga, in the Mexican state of Chihuahua.**\n\nThis site is the remains of a prehistoric village, and the visible square feature is the remnant of a nearly square, burned pithouse. The structure was excavated in 1949 by the archaeologist J. Charles Kelley. Based on the archaeological findings, the site is dated to the La Junta phase of the Bravo Valley aspect, with an estimated occupation period between A.D. 1200 and 1400.\n\nLoma Seca is situated approximately one kilometer south of the Rio Conchos. The discovery of this site was significant as it provided crucial evidence of agricultural village life on the Mexican side of the La Junta de los Rios region. The excavated house, referred to as \"House 1,\" revealed postholes and remnants of jacal (wattle and daub) construction, indicating how these ancient dwellings were built.\n\nThe La Junta de los Rios area, where the Rio Conchos and Rio Grande meet, was a major cultural crossroads for various indigenous groups for centuries. The region has a rich history of settled life, agriculture, and trade that predates European contact. Loma Seca is a key site for understanding the prehistory of this important region and is the only La Junta phase site in Mexico that has been formally excavated. Ongoing archaeological research in the broader La Junta district continues to uncover more about the lives of the people who inhabited this area.\n\n<<<The square ancient structure in the image is the Loma Seca archaeological site (Chihuahua E7-5), and it is a historic landmark.>>>"
