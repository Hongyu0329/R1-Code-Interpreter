    "To determine the metric pattern of the poem, we must first transcribe its words and then analyze their syllables and stress patterns against the definitions of the given options.\n\nThe words in the erasure poem are: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work.\"\n\nNext, let's analyze this phrase against each possible metric pattern:\n\n*   **Syllable Count**: A key step in identifying meter is counting the syllables.\n    *   rules (1) + and (1) + lines (1) + an (1) + in-tri-cate (3) + spi-der's (2) + web (1) + work (1) = 11 total syllables.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the choices:\n*   **A. free verse**: This is a form of poetry that does not follow a consistent meter, rhyme scheme, or other formal pattern. It often follows the cadence of natural speech. Since erasure poetry is created by selecting words from a source text, it doesn't inherently follow a set meter unless the poet specifically chooses words to fit one.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter**: This meter consists of a line with five iambic feet, which means it has 10 syllables in an alternating unstressed-stressed pattern (da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM). The poem's 11 syllables do not fit this pattern.\n*   **C. alexandrine**: This is a line of verse with 12 syllables, typically iambic hexameter (six iambic feet). The poem does not have 12 syllables.\n*   **D. sapphic**: This is a specific stanzaic form, typically consisting of three 11-syllable lines followed by a 5-syllable line. While the total syllable count is 11, the poem is a single phrase, not a Sapphic stanza, nor does it follow the complex trochaic and dactylic rhythm of a single Sapphic line.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter**: This form has three iambic feet, resulting in about six syllables per line (da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM). Even if we break the poem into smaller lines based on the visual layout, no part of it conforms to iambic trimeter.\n*   **F. american sentence**: This form, created by Allen Ginsberg, requires a single sentence to be exactly 17 syllables long. The poem has 11 syllables, not 17.\n\nBased on the analysis, none of the specific, formal metric patterns (B, C, D, E, F) fit the poem's syllable count or structure. The poem's form is derived from the visual and linguistic choices made during the erasure process, not from adhering to a traditional meter. Therefore, it is best described as free verse.\n\n<<<A>>>"
