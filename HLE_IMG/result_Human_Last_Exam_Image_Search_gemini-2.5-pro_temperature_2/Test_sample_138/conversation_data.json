    "Here is the determination of the biological sexes for each pair of insects:\n\n**Pair A:** The insect on the left (A-left) is a cuckoo bee from the genus *Coelioxys*. The strongly pointed, cone-shaped abdomen is characteristic of females, which use this feature to lay eggs in the nests of other bees. The males of this genus have abdomens armed with multiple spines or teeth. The insect on the right (A-right) is another type of cuckoo bee, likely from the genus *Triepeolus*. In many bee species, males have longer antennae relative to females and an additional abdominal segment. Based on the general appearance and comparatively long antennae, it is likely a male. Thus, the pair is female and male.\n\n**Pair B:** These are paper wasps of the genus *Polistes*. A key feature for identifying sexes in many *Polistes* species is the antennae. The wasp on the left (B-left) has distinctly curled antenna tips, which is a recognizable characteristic of males. The wasp on the right (B-right) has straight antennae, which is typical for females. Therefore, the pair is male and female.\n\n**Pair C:** These are wool carder bees, likely from the genus *Anthidium*. The prompt mentions that the collected pollinators are from taxa without scopae (pollen-collecting hairs) on their legs, which is true for the family Megachilidae, as females carry pollen on the underside of their abdomen. The bee on the left (C-left) displays highly modified front legs that are hairy and enlarged. This is a classic sexual characteristic of males in certain *Anthidium* species, used for grasping the female during mating. The bee on the right (C-right) lacks these modified forelegs and has the typical appearance of a female of the species. Consequently, the pair is male and female.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct indices are:\n*   A: Female, Male (4)\n*   B: Male, Female (3)\n*   C: Male, Female (3)\n\n4, 3, 3<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
