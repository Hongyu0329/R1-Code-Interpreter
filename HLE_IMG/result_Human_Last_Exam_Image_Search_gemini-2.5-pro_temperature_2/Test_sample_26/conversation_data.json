    "The correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata is V6/5 / iv.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the harmonic analysis:\n*   **Key Signature:** The sonata is in C minor.\n*   **Chord in Measure 30:** The notes in this measure are F# (in the right hand) and Ab, C, and Eb (in the left hand), which form an F# diminished seventh chord (F#-A-C-Eb). In a different inversion, some analyses show an A♭ major chord.\n*   **Chord Function:** This chord functions as a secondary dominant. A secondary dominant is a dominant chord that resolves to a chord other than the tonic. In this instance, the F# diminished seventh chord (which functions as a dominant of G) does not resolve as would be anticipated. The entire phrase in this section modulates through different keys.\n*   **Context in the piece:** An analysis shows that the section from measures 28-31 is in the key of A-flat major. Some music theorists point out that in measure 30, Beethoven is utilizing augmented 6th chords.\n\n<<<V6/5 / iv>>>"
