    "The X Y is a **Felt Hat**.\n\nThis answer connects the two clues provided:\n\n*   **\"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"** The image shows hockey player Nikita Kucherov at the NHL Awards on June 19, 2019. In hockey, scoring three goals in a game is called a \"hat trick.\" This achievement metaphorically links the event in the picture to a hat. Nikita Kucherov had an exceptional season, winning the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), Ted Lindsay Award, and Art Ross Trophy.\n\n*   **\"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"** Historically, mercury nitrate was used in a process called \"carroting\" to produce felt for hats. This process was extremely toxic to hat-makers, leading to mercury poisoning, a condition sometimes known as \"Mad Hatter's disease\" or \"hatter's shakes\". The use of mercury in the felt industry was eventually banned in the 1940s due to these health hazards.\n\n<<<Felt Hat>>>"
