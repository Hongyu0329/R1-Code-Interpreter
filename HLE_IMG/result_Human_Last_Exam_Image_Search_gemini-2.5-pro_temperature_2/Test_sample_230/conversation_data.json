    "Based on visual analysis and search results, the painting fragment is from **\"Die brennende Mühle\" (The Burning Mill)** by the 19th-century German artist **Karl Heilmayer** (1829-1908).\n\nSeveral auction sites and art databases show this specific painting, or very similar versions, attributed to Heilmayer. The scene's dramatic elements, including the windmill silhouetted against a dark, stormy sky with a fire glowing in the background, are characteristic of his work, which often featured romantic and atmospheric landscapes, many with dramatic light effects like moonlight or fire.\n\nWhile some initial searches might suggest other artists who painted similar subjects, such as Jules-Jacques Veyrassat or even draw comparisons to Rembrandt's \"The Mill,\" the specific details and style in the provided fragment are most consistently identified with Karl Heilmayer's \"Die brennende Mühle.\"\n\n<<<Die brennende Mühle by Karl Heilmayer>>>"
