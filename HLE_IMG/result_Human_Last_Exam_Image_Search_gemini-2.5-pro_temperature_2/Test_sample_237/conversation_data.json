    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. It is an insect, specifically a species of longhorn beetle.\n\nBased on its appearance, the animal is most likely a female **Black-striped Longhorn Beetle**. The scientific name for this species is ***Stenurella melanura***.\n\nThis beetle is part of the Cerambycidae family and is characterized by its narrow, long body and antennae that are roughly the same length as its body. While the male of this species has yellowish-brown wing cases (elytra), the female's are reddish, which matches the insect in the photograph. *Stenurella melanura* is widespread throughout most of Europe and parts of Asia. The larvae develop in decaying wood of both deciduous and coniferous trees, and the adults are often found on flowers from May to September.\n\n<<<*Stenurella melanura*>>>"
