    "The Jones polynomial for the provided knot, which is known as the 9₄₂ knot, has been determined through analysis of knot theory databases.\n\nThe Jones polynomial, denoted as V(t), for the 9₄₂ knot is:\nt³ - t² + t - 1 + t⁻¹ - t⁻² + t⁻³\n\nThis polynomial is notable because it is the same for the knot and its mirror image, meaning V(t) = V(t⁻¹).\n\n<<<t^3 - t^2 + t - 1 + t^(-1) - t^(-2) + t^(-3)>>>"
