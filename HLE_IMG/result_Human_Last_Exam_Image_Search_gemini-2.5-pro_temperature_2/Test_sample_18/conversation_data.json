    "The hidden piece is the White King, located on square **g5**.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n1.  First, we must find a square for the White King where it is not currently in check, according to the rules. The square g5 is not attacked by any of Black's pieces.\n    *   The Black Queen on e2 does not attack g5.\n    *   The Black Knight on e1 does not attack g5.\n    *   The Black pawn on g6 attacks f5 and h5.\n    *   No other black piece can attack the g5 square.\n2.  With the White King on g5, it is Black's turn to move. Black can deliver checkmate in a single move.\n3.  The winning move is **...Nxg4#** (Knight captures Knight on g4, checkmate).\n\nLet's analyze the move ...Nxg4#:\n*   The Black Knight, now on g4, puts the White King on g5 in check.\n*   The White King has no escape squares:\n    *   f6 is attacked by the Black Queen (e2) and the Black pawn (e7).\n    *   h6 is attacked by the Black pawn (g7).\n    *   h4 is attacked by the White Bishop (d3), but also the Black pawn (g6) would attack if the White King moves to h5, which is blocked by the Queen (e2).\n    *   f5 is attacked by the Black pawn (g6).\n*   The check cannot be blocked as it is a Knight check.\n*   The Black Knight on g4 cannot be captured.\n\nThus, placing the White King on g5 allows for a mate in one move for Black.\n\n<<<g5>>>"
