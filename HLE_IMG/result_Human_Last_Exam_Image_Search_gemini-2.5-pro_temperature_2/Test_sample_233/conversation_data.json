    "The ID of the runestone depicted in the image fragment is **Ög 136**.\n\nThe image shows a section of the famous Rök runestone (Swedish: *Rökstenen*), located in Östergötland, Sweden. While you referred to it as an Ingvar runestone, the Rök runestone is distinct from that group. The Ingvar runestones, of which there are about 26, were raised to commemorate those who died in a Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled. In contrast, the Rök stone was raised by a man named Varinn in memory of his deceased son, Vámóðr.\n\nThe fragment in your image is identifiable by its unique grid-like pattern which contains cipher runes, also known as cryptic runes. The Rök runestone is renowned for having the longest known runic inscription, with around 760 characters, and it employs several complex encryption methods. This specific section is one of the ways the carver encoded parts of the lengthy text.\n\nThe Rök stone is considered the first piece of written Swedish literature and dates to the early 9th century AD.\n\n<<<Ög 136>>>"
