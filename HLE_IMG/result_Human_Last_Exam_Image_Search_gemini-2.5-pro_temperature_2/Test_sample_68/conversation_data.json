    "Based on the inscription \"COLONIES FRANÇOISES,\" this coin was not minted for a single specific colony but for general circulation throughout the French colonies.\n\nThe coin pictured is a 9 Deniers piece from the reign of King Louis XV. These particular coins were struck in 1721 and 1722. While intended for all French colonies, their primary area of circulation was New France, which included territories such as Quebec (Canada), Acadia, and Louisiana. For this reason, these coins are often referred to as \"Louisiana Coppers\" or are associated with the French colonies in the Americas.\n\nThe an edict in June 1721 by King Louis XV authorized the production of these 9 Deniers copper coins. They were minted in Rouen (mint mark \"B\") and La Rochelle (mint mark \"H\"). However, the colonists preferred coins containing precious metals like silver and widely rejected the copper pieces. As a result, a large number of them were returned to France in 1726 to be melted down, with only a small quantity remaining in circulation.\n\nAnother coin, a sou (12 deniers) with the same \"COLONIES FRANÇOISES\" inscription, was minted in 1767 for use in the French colonies in Canada, Louisiana, and the French West Indies.\n\n<<<New France>>>"
