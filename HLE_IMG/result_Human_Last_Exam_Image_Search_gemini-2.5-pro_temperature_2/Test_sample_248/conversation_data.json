    "The species that definitively indicates this photo of free-living organisms was taken on the Atlantic rather than Pacific Coast is the common periwinkle. Several common periwinkles are visible in the photograph. This species is abundant along the rocky shores of the North Atlantic.\n\nKey identifying features of this species present in the photograph include its conical shell with a pointed apex. The color is typically black or dark grey-brown, often with darker spiral lines, and a white central axis (columella).\n\nThe common periwinkle is native to the northeastern coasts of the Atlantic Ocean, including northern Spain, Great Britain, Scandinavia, and Russia. It was introduced to the Atlantic coast of North America in the mid-19th century and is now the most common marine snail along the North Atlantic coast, with a range from Labrador, Canada, down to New Jersey and in some cases as far south as Delaware in the United States. While it has been found on the West Coast of the U.S., it is not widespread and is considered a characteristic and dominant species of the Atlantic.\n\nOther organisms in the photo, such as the acorn barnacles and dog whelks (*Nucella lapillus*), are also found on both sides of the North Atlantic and are characteristic of this type of rocky shore community.\n\n<<<*Littorina littorea*>>>"
