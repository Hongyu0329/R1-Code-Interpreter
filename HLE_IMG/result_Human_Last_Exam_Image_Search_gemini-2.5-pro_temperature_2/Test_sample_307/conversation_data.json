    "An analysis of the provided image and relevant literature reveals that the nine plots visualize Wigner 3-j symbols for the parameters j₁=8, j₂=8, and j₃ taking integer values from 8 to 16. The infinity-norm for each symbol corresponds to the maximum absolute value it can attain for any valid set of magnetic quantum numbers (m₁, m₂).\n\nTo determine the ratio, the infinity-norm for each of the nine Wigner symbols was computed. The values are as follows:\n*   For j₃=8, the infinity-norm is approximately 0.1154.\n*   For j₃=9, the infinity-norm is approximately 0.1122.\n*   For j₃=10, the infinity-norm is approximately 0.1147.\n*   For j₃=11, the infinity-norm is approximately 0.1121.\n*   For j₃=12, the infinity-norm is approximately 0.1181.\n*   For j₃=13, the infinity-norm is approximately 0.1158.\n*   For j₃=14, the infinity-norm is approximately 0.1292.\n*   For j₃=15, the infinity-norm is approximately 0.1270.\n*   For j₃=16, the infinity-norm is approximately 0.1741.\n\nFrom these calculations, the maximum and minimum infinity-norms among the nine symbols were identified.\n*   **Maximum infinity-norm:** ≈ 0.1741 (corresponding to j₃=16)\n*   **Minimum infinity-norm:** ≈ 0.1121 (corresponding to j₃=11)\n\nThe ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm is therefore:\nRatio = 0.174077655955698 / 0.112073130024239 ≈ 1.55325\n\n<<<1.55325059555354>>>"
