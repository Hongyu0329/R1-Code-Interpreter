    "The author of this altarpiece detail is Andrea della Robbia.\n\nThis glazed terracotta relief is a panel from the predella (the lower part) of a large altarpiece located in the Basilica dell'Osservanza in Siena, Italy. The church houses several significant works by Sienese masters, including multiple pieces by Andrea della Robbia, a renowned Florentine sculptor famous for his terracotta works. This specific panel depicts a Eucharistic scene, identified by the inscription at the bottom which reads \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL,\" meaning \"Sacrament of the Altar.\"\n\nThe altarpiece itself features a main panel depicting the Coronation of the Virgin, with this scene appearing on the base.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
