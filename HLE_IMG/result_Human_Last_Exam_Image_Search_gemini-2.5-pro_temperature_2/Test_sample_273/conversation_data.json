    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules for each of the three chiral centers. The molecule is 5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol. The carbon chain is numbered starting from the end closest to the principal functional group, the hydroxyl (-OH) group, making it a pentan-2-ol.\n\n*   **C1**: -CH3\n*   **C2**: -CH(OH)- (Chiral Center)\n*   **C3**: -CH(CH2CH3)- (Chiral Center)\n*   **C4**: -CH(CH3)- (Chiral Center)\n*   **C5**: -CH2NH2\n\n### Analysis of Chiral Center C2\n\n1.  **Assign Priorities:**\n    *   The atoms attached to C2 are O, C3, C1, and H.\n    *   Based on atomic number: -OH is priority **1**.\n    *   C3 is attached to two other carbons, while C1 is a terminal methyl group. Thus, -C3 is priority **2**.\n    *   -CH3 (C1) is priority **3**.\n    *   -H is priority **4**.\n\n2.  **Determine Configuration:**\n    *   In the provided drawing, the -OH group (priority 1) is shown with a dashed bond, meaning it points into the page.\n    *   The implied -H atom (priority 4) is on a wedged bond, pointing out of the page.\n    *   The path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (-OH → -C3 → -CH3) is counter-clockwise.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (-H) is pointing towards the viewer, we must reverse the configuration. Counter-clockwise normally indicates S, so reversing it gives **R**.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C2 is **R**.\n\n### Analysis of Chiral Center C3\n\n1.  **Assign Priorities:**\n    *   The groups attached to C3 are -C2, -C4, an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), and -H.\n    *   -C2 is bonded to an oxygen atom, giving it the highest priority among the carbon-containing groups. Priority **1**.\n    *   Comparing -C4 (-CH(CH3)(CH2NH2)) and the ethyl group (-CH2CH3), C4 is bonded to two carbons while the ethyl's CH2 is bonded to one. Thus, -C4 is priority **2**.\n    *   The ethyl group is priority **3**.\n    *   -H is priority **4**.\n\n2.  **Determine Configuration:**\n    *   The ethyl group (priority 3) is on a wedged bond (out of the page).\n    *   The implied -H atom (priority 4) is on a dashed bond (into the page).\n    *   With the lowest priority group (-H) pointing away, we can directly determine the configuration.\n    *   The path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (-C2 → -C4 → -ethyl) is clockwise.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C3 is **R**.\n\n### Analysis of Chiral Center C4\n\n1.  **Assign Priorities:**\n    *   The groups attached to C4 are -C5, -C3, a methyl group (-CH3), and -H.\n    *   The -C5 group (-CH2NH2) is attached to a nitrogen atom. Comparing N (atomic number 7) with the carbons attached to C3 gives -C5 the highest priority. Priority **1**.\n    *   -C3 is attached to other carbons, giving it priority over the methyl group. Priority **2**.\n    *   The methyl group is priority **3**.\n    *   -H is priority **4**.\n\n2.  **Determine Configuration:**\n    *   The methyl group (priority 3) is on a dashed bond (into the page).\n    *   The implied -H atom (priority 4) is on a wedged bond (out of the page).\n    *   With the lowest priority group (-H) pointing towards the viewer, we must reverse the result.\n    *   The path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (-C5 → -C3 → -CH3) is counter-clockwise.\n    *   Counter-clockwise (S) is reversed to **R**.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C4 is **R**.\n\nThe absolute configuration for the molecule is (2R, 3R, 4R).\n\n<<<(2R, 3R, 4R)>>>"
