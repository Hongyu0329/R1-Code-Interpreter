    "To determine the time signature of the provided musical measure, we must count the total number of beats in the measure for both the treble and bass clefs. A time signature tells us how many beats are in each measure and what kind of note gets one beat.\n\n**Analysis of the Measure:**\n\n*   **Treble Clef (Top Staff):** The right hand plays a continuous pattern of sixteenth notes. Sixteenth notes can be identified by their solid note heads, stems, and double beams connecting them. The notes are grouped into four sets of four sixteenth notes.\n    *   Four sixteenth notes equal one quarter note in duration.\n    *   Since there are four of these groups, the total duration in the treble clef is four quarter notes (4 x 4 sixteenth notes = 16 sixteenth notes = 4 quarter notes).\n\n*   **Bass Clef (Bottom Staff):** The left hand plays two half notes. A half note has a hollow note head and a stem.\n    *   In common time signatures like 4/4, a half note is equal to two quarter notes.\n    *   The measure contains two half notes, so the total duration is four quarter notes (2 beats + 2 beats = 4 beats).\n\nBoth the treble and bass clefs contain notes that add up to a total of four quarter notes. Therefore, the time signature is 4/4. 4/4 time is often called \"common time\" because of how frequently it is used.\n\n<<<C>>>"
