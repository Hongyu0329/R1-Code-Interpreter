    "This picture was taken in Boston.\n\nThe image displays the iconic interior of the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center (BCEC). The most recognizable feature is the building's unique ceiling, characterized by a white geometric grid and glass panels with a distinctive circular pattern that creates a memorable play of light and shadow.\n\nThe BCEC, designed by architect Rafael Vi√±oly in a joint venture with HNTB Architecture, is one of the largest exhibition centers in the Northeastern United States. Its vast, 516,000-square-foot exhibition hall is covered by a spectacular curving roof that stands 100 feet high at its apex. This design, which includes a nearly column-free space and clerestory windows, allows for an abundance of natural light to fill the hall.<<<Boston>>>"
