    "The transformation shown involves two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occurring in sequence. The two reactions are an **electrocyclic reaction** followed by a **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the reaction mechanism:\n\n1.  **Photoisomerization of Hexafluorobenzene**: The first step is the photochemical isomerization of hexafluorobenzene into its valence isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (or hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This transformation is a type of pericyclic reaction known as an **electrocyclic reaction**. Specifically, it is a photochemically induced 4π-electron electrocyclic ring-closing reaction. Under the influence of ultraviolet light (hv), four of the π-electrons of the benzene ring reorganize to form a new sigma bond, creating the strained bicyclic Dewar-benzene structure. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 4π-electron electrocyclic reaction is allowed to proceed in a disrotatory fashion under photochemical conditions.\n\n2.  **Photochemical Cycloaddition**: The second step is a reaction between the intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, and cyclobutene. This is a **[2+2] cycloaddition**, another type of pericyclic reaction. In this step, one of the double bonds of hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene reacts with the double bond of cyclobutene. This photochemical reaction involves the 2 π-electrons from each of the two double bonds to form two new sigma bonds, resulting in a new four-membered ring that fuses the two reactant molecules. Photochemical [2+2] cycloadditions between two alkenes are symmetry-allowed. This cycloaddition creates the final tricyclic product shown in the reaction. The use of Dewar benzene intermediates in subsequent cycloadditions is a known strategy in forming complex polycyclic systems.\n\nTherefore, the two pericyclic reactions involved are an electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\n<<<[Electrocyclic reaction, [2+2] cycloaddition]>>>"
