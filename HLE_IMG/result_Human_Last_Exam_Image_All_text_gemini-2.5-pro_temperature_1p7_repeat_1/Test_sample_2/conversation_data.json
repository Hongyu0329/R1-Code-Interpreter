    "An elegant explanation of the method, followed by a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Algorithm Understanding**\n\nThe provided Python-like pseudocode defines a recursive sorting function `sort(a, n)` that aims to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`.\n\nLet's break down its operation for a given `n > 1`:\n1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: It first recursively calls itself to sort the subarray `a[0...n-2]`.\n2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: After the first `n-1` elements are sorted, it compares the last element of this sorted subarray (`a[n-2]`) with the next element in the main array (`a[n-1]`).\n3.  `swap(...)`: If the element at `a[n-1]` is smaller, it's swapped with `a[n-2]`. This single swap partially places the element `a[n-1]` but might disrupt the sorted order of the `a[0...n-2]` subarray (because the new `a[n-2]` might be smaller than other elements in that subarray).\n4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: To correct any potential disorder created by the swap, it makes a second recursive call to re-sort the entire `a[0...n-2]` subarray.\n\n**2. Time Complexity Analysis**\n\nWe need to find the worst-case time complexity. Let's represent the time taken by the function for an input of size `n` as `T(n)`.\n\n*   **Base Case:** When `n <= 1`, the `if n > 1` condition is false, and the function does nothing. This takes constant time. So, `T(1) = c₁` (a constant).\n\n*   **Recursive Step:** For `n > 1`, the time taken depends on whether the `if` condition is true.\n    *   The first recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` always happens. This takes `T(n-1)` time.\n    *   The comparison and potential swap take constant time, `c₂`.\n    *   The second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` only happens if the `if` condition is true.\n\n*   **Worst-Case Scenario:** The worst case occurs when the `if` condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true for every recursive step, forcing the second call to `sort(a, n-1)`. This happens, for example, with a reverse-sorted array. In this scenario, the recurrence relation for the time complexity is:\n    `T(n) = T(n-1) + c₂ + T(n-1)`\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c₂`\n\n**3. Solving the Recurrence Relation**\n\nWe need to solve the recurrence `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c` with the base case `T(1) = c₁`. We can do this by expansion:\n*   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n*   `T(n) = 2 * [2 * T(n-2) + c] + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n*   `T(n) = 4 * [2 * T(n-3) + c] + 2c + c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n*   ...after `k` expansions...\n*   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) + ... + 1)`\n\nThe sum in the parenthesis is a geometric series which equals `2^k - 1`. So:\n*   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^k - 1)`\n\nWe expand until we reach the base case `T(1)`. This happens when `n - k = 1`, or `k = n - 1`.\n*   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n*   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c₁ + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n*   `T(n) = (c₁ + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\nThe dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`. In Big-O notation, constant factors are ignored, and `O(2^(n-1))` is the same as `O(2^n)`.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe structure of the recurrence relation `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c` is similar to that of the Towers of Hanoi puzzle, which is famously known to have an exponential time complexity. The algorithm is correct but extremely inefficient. The worst-case time complexity is exponential.\n\nLooking at the answer choices:\nA. O(n) - This is the best-case complexity (for an already sorted array).\nB. O(n log n) - Standard for efficient sorting algorithms.\nC. O(n^2) - Standard for simple sorting algorithms.\nD. O(n^3) - Not fitting the recurrence.\nE. O(2^n) - Matches our analysis for the worst case.\nF. does not terminate - The algorithm does terminate as the problem size `n` decreases by 1 in each recursive call, eventually reaching the base case `n <= 1`.\n\nThe correct answer is O(2^n).\n\n<<<E>>>"
