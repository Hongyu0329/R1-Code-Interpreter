*Simplified representation due to complexity.* A more accurate drawing is: A pyrrolizidine ring fused with the new dihydropyrrole ring. The pyrrolizidine nitrogen atom is bonded to an acetyl group and the (4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl) group. The methyl carboxylate group is attached to the double bond of the newly formed ring.
