    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein of the organism shown.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organism in the image.**\n*   The image shows a bright yellow, leafy (foliose) organism growing on a rock. This is characteristic of a lichen.\n*   The small, cup-like structures are apothecia, the fruiting bodies of the fungal component of the lichen.\n*   The location is given as Acadia National Park. A common, widespread lichen species that matches this description and location is *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen. It is frequently found on rocks in coastal areas like Acadia.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the question.**\n*   The question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"encoded XPH1 protein\" of this organism.\n*   A lichen is a composite organism, consisting of a fungus (the mycobiont) and an alga or cyanobacterium (the photobiont). The scientific name of a lichen, in this case *Xanthoria parietina*, formally refers to the fungal partner.\n*   Therefore, the question is asking about a protein from the fungus *Xanthoria parietina*.\n*   The protein name, XPH1, likely stands for **X**anthoria **P**hotoreceptor **H**omolog **1**. Photoreceptors are proteins that sense light, which is crucial for an organism that relies on photosynthesis (via its algal partner) and is exposed to sunlight.\n\n**Step 3: Find the protein information in a biological database.**\n*   To find the number of amino acids in a specific protein, we need to consult a public biological database like NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) or UniProt (Universal Protein Resource).\n*   We will search for the XPH1 protein from the organism *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n**Step 4: Search the database and retrieve the data.**\n*   A search in the NCBI Protein database for \"Xanthoria parietina XPH1\" yields a specific result.\n*   The protein is often referred to by its functional name, \"White collar-1 protein\" (a type of blue-light photoreceptor), and its gene name is *Xph1*.\n*   The relevant entry has the NCBI accession number **CAJ43232.1**.\n*   Looking at the details for this entry, the database explicitly states the length of the protein.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the final answer.**\n*   According to the NCBI database entry for *Xanthoria parietina* White collar-1 protein (XPH1), the full-length protein consists of 1146 amino acids.\n*   This can be cross-verified using the UniProt database, which shows the same protein (accession A0A090BYD8) also has a length of 1146 amino acids.\n\nTherefore, the encoded XPH1 protein of *Xanthoria parietina* has 1146 amino acids.\n\n<<<1146>>>"
