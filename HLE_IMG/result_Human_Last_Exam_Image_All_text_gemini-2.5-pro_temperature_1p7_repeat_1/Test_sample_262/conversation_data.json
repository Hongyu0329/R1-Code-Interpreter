    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks to identify which of the four iridium(III) complexes will have shorter operational lifetimes when used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). Operational lifetime is primarily determined by the chemical and photochemical stability of the emitter complex.\n\n2.  **Analyze the General Structure of the Complexes:**\n    *   All four compounds are cationic, heteroleptic iridium(III) complexes with the general formula `[Ir(C^N)₂(N^N)]⁺PF₆⁻`.\n    *   The central metal is Iridium(III) in an octahedral coordination environment.\n    *   The `PF₆⁻` is a non-coordinating counter-anion and is identical in all four complexes, so it won't be a distinguishing factor.\n    *   The `N^N` ligand is the same in all four complexes: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. Since this ligand is constant, it's the differences in the other ligands that will determine the relative lifetimes.\n    *   The `C^N` ligands are cyclometalating ligands, where a phenyl ring is bound to the iridium via a C-Ir bond, and a pyridine ring is bound via a N-Ir bond. The key difference between the four complexes lies in the substitution pattern on the phenyl ring of these `C^N` ligands.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Specific C^N Ligands in Each Complex:**\n    *   **Complex 1:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-phenylpyridine (ppy). The phenyl ring is unsubstituted. This complex serves as a common benchmark for iridium emitters.\n    *   **Complex 2:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. The phenyl ring has two fluorine substituents, one at the 2-position (ortho to the Ir-C bond) and one at the 4-position (para to the Ir-C bond).\n    *   **Complex 3:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. The phenyl ring has one fluorine substituent at the 2-position (ortho to the Ir-C bond).\n    *   **Complex 4:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-(3,5-difluorophenyl)pyridine. The phenyl ring has two fluorine substituents, both at meta-positions (3 and 5) relative to the Ir-C bond.\n\n4.  **Relate Ligand Structure to Complex Stability and Lifetime:**\n    *   The stability of these complexes, particularly in their light-emitting excited state, is crucial for a long device lifetime. A major factor influencing stability is the strength of the bonds within the complex, especially the Ir-C bond.\n    *   **Fluorination Effect:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom. When attached to the phenyl ring, it has a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect.\n        *   **Stabilizing Effect:** This electron-withdrawing effect generally pulls electron density away from the metalated carbon, strengthening the Ir-C bond. This enhanced bond strength makes the complex more robust and resistant to degradation, leading to a *longer* lifetime. This is particularly true for fluorine atoms at the *meta* and *para* positions.\n        *   **Destabilizing Effect:** A significant exception to this rule exists for fluorine atoms placed at the *ortho* position (C2 position of the phenyl ring) relative to the Ir-C bond. The C-F bond in this ortho position is known to be a \"weak link.\" In the excited state, the complex can undergo degradation pathways involving the cleavage of this specific C-F bond. This leads to rapid and irreversible degradation of the emitter molecule, resulting in a significantly *shorter* operational lifetime for the device.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Each Complex Based on this Principle:**\n    *   **Complex 1 (ppy):** Has no fluorine substituents. It is generally stable but lacks the bond-strengthening effect of meta/para-fluorination. It also lacks the specific ortho-fluorine degradation pathway. Its lifetime will be our reference point.\n    *   **Complex 2 (2,4-difluoro):** Has a fluorine atom at the ortho position. This introduces the known degradation pathway. Therefore, Complex 2 is expected to have a *short* lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 3 (2-fluoro):** Also has a fluorine atom at the ortho position. Like Complex 2, it is susceptible to the ortho-C-F bond cleavage degradation pathway and is expected to have a *short* lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 4 (3,5-difluoro):** Has fluorine atoms only at the meta positions. This avoids the unstable ortho-position. The strong electron-withdrawing effects of two meta-fluorines will significantly strengthen the Ir-C bond, leading to a highly stable complex. Complex 4 is expected to have a *long* lifetime, likely the longest of the four.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Complexes 2 and 3 both contain the ortho-fluorine structural motif that is known to cause poor operational stability.\n    *   Complex 1 is a stable baseline, and Complex 4 is expected to be even more stable.\n    *   Therefore, the complexes expected to show shorter lifetimes are **Complex 2** and **Complex 3**.\n\n7.  **Match with Answer Choices:** The combination of Complex 2 and Complex 3 corresponds to option H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
