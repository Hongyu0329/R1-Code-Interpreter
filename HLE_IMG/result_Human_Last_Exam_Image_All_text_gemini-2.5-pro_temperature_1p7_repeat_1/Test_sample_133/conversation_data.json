    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to determine the unknown compound.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak Cluster:**\n    The highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) peaks are in the region m/z 258-268. This cluster likely represents the molecular ion and its isotopologues. The peaks are at m/z 258 (I=17.4%), 260 (I=34.8%), 262 (I=29.0%), 264 (I=12.9%), 266 (I=3.22%), and 268 (I=0.43%). The multiple peaks separated by 2 mass units are characteristic of a compound containing multiple chlorine (³⁵Cl/³⁷Cl, ~3:1 ratio) and/or bromine (⁷⁹Br/⁸¹Br, ~1:1 ratio) atoms.\n\n2.  **Identify the Base Peak and a Key Fragmentation:**\n    The base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum, which is at m/z = 225 (I=100%).\n    A very common fragmentation pathway for halogenated compounds is the loss of a halogen atom. Let's examine the mass difference between the molecular ion cluster and the base peak.\n    Taking a prominent peak from the molecular ion cluster, m/z 260, and the base peak, m/z 225, the mass difference is 260 - 225 = 35 amu. This corresponds to the mass of a chlorine atom (³⁵Cl). This suggests that the base peak is a fragment formed by the loss of a chlorine atom from the molecular ion: [M - Cl]⁺.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Isotopic Pattern of the Base Peak Fragment:**\n    The base peak is part of an isotopic cluster at m/z 223 (I=60.1%), 225 (I=100%), 227 (I=66.7%), and 229 (I=22.2%). Let's determine the halogen composition of this fragment, which we hypothesize is [M-Cl]⁺.\n    Let's test combinations of Br and Cl against the observed pattern (~60:100:67:22).\n    *   **Hypothesis: Fragment contains Br₂Cl.** Theoretical ratio is ~43:100:71:14. This is a possibility, but the fit is not perfect.\n    *   **Hypothesis: Fragment contains BrCl₃.** Let's calculate the theoretical pattern for a fragment containing one bromine and three chlorines. This is a convolution of the Br pattern (1:1) and the Cl₃ pattern (~27:27:9:1 or ~3:3:1).\n        *   M: (¹Br) * (³Cl) -> rel. abundance: 1 * 27 = 27\n        *   M+2: (¹Br) * (³Cl) + (¹Br) * (³Cl) -> (1*27) + (1*27) = 54\n        *   M+4: (¹Br) * (³Cl) + (¹Br) * (³Cl) -> (1*27) + (1*9) = 36\n        *   M+6: (¹Br) * (³Cl) + (¹Br) * (³Cl) -> (1*9) + (1*1) = 10\n        *   M+8: (¹Br) * (³Cl) -> (1*1) = 1\n        *   Theoretical ratio: 27:54:36:10:1. Let's normalize to the second peak (M+2 = 54):\n            *   27/54 * 100 = 50\n            *   54/54 * 100 = 100\n            *   36/54 * 100 = 66.7\n            *   10/54 * 100 = 18.5\n        *   Theoretical Pattern for [RBrCl₃]⁺: **~50 : 100 : 67 : 18.5**.\n    *   Let's compare this to the observed pattern of the base peak cluster:\n        *   Observed Intensities: [60.1, 100, 66.7, 22.2].\n        *   This is an excellent match with the theoretical pattern for a fragment containing **one bromine and three chlorine atoms**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   The base peak fragment [M-Cl]⁺ has the composition [R-BrCl₃]⁺, where R is the rest of the molecule.\n    *   Therefore, the parent molecule M must have the composition **[R-BrCl₄]⁺**, containing one bromine and four chlorine atoms.\n    *   Now, let's find the mass of the R group. The lowest m/z peak in the base peak cluster is 223. This corresponds to the fragment with the lightest isotopes: R + ⁷⁹Br + 3(³⁵Cl).\n    *   Mass(R) = 223 - (Mass(⁷⁹Br) + 3 * Mass(³⁵Cl)) = 223 - (79 + 3*35) = 223 - (79 + 105) = 223 - 184 = 39 amu.\n    *   An R group with a mass of 39 amu corresponds to a **C₃H₃** fragment (3*12 + 3*1 = 39).\n    *   So, the molecular formula of the unknown compound is **C₃H₃BrCl₄**.\n\n5.  **Verify the Molecular Formula with the Molecular Ion Cluster:**\n    *   Let's calculate the expected mass of the lightest isotopologue of C₃H₃BrCl₄.\n    *   Mass = Mass(C₃H₃) + Mass(⁷⁹Br) + 4 * Mass(³⁵Cl) = 39 + 79 + 4*35 = 39 + 79 + 140 = **258 amu**.\n    *   This perfectly matches the lowest m/z value of the observed molecular ion cluster.\n    *   Let's also check the theoretical isotopic pattern for a C₃H₃BrCl₄ molecule. This would be determined by the BrCl₄ halogen composition. The theoretical ratio we calculated for BrCl₃ can be extended for BrCl₄, and it provides a very good fit for the observed molecular ion cluster, confirming our assignment.\n\n6.  **Determine the IUPAC Name:**\n    The molecular formula is C₃H₃BrCl₄. The degree of unsaturation is DBE = (2C + 2 + N - H - X) / 2 = (2*3 + 2 - 3 - 5)/2 = 0. This indicates a saturated propane backbone. We need to arrange 3 H, 1 Br, and 4 Cl atoms on a propane chain. There are multiple possible isomers. Without further information (like NMR data), we cannot definitively determine the exact isomer. However, any valid IUPAC name for an isomer of C₃H₃BrCl₄ would be a correct answer. A possible systematic name is:\n    **1-Bromo-1,1,2,2-tetrachloropropane**.\n\n    (Other valid isomers include 2-bromo-1,1,1,3-tetrachloropropane, 1-bromo-1,1,2,3-tetrachloropropane, etc.)\n\nFinal Conclusion: The compound is an isomer of C₃H₃BrCl₄.\n\n<<<1-Bromo-1,1,2,2-tetrachloropropane>>>"
