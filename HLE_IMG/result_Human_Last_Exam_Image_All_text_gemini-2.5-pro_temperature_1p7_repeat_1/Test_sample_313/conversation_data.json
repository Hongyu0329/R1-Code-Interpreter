    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Analyze the first clue:** \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n    *   The image shows a man with a beard receiving an award from an older man. Both are in formal attire. The setting appears to be an awards ceremony.\n    *   Using image recognition and the date, we can identify the people and the event. The man receiving the award is Nikita Kucherov, a professional ice hockey player. The man presenting the award is Gary Bettman, the commissioner of the National Hockey League (NHL).\n    *   The event is the 2019 NHL Awards ceremony, which took place on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas (the date in the prompt is off by one day, which is a common occurrence).\n    *   At this specific event, Nikita Kucherov won three major individual awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player), and the Art Ross Trophy (top point scorer).\n    *   Winning three significant achievements in a sport or event is commonly referred to as a \"hat trick\". Media outlets at the time described Kucherov's accomplishment as an \"awards hat trick\" or a \"trophy hat trick\". Therefore, the \"X Y\" in the first clue refers to a \"Hat Trick\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the second clue:** \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n    *   This clue provides a homonym or a wordplay puzzle based on the answer from the first clue. We need to find another meaning of \"X Y\" that relates to mercury salts.\n    *   If \"X Y\" is \"Hat Trick\", the key word is \"Hat\".\n    *   Historically, the process of making felt for hats (particularly beaver hats) involved a technique called \"carroting\". This process used a solution of mercury nitrate, a toxic mercury salt, to treat the fur.\n    *   Workers in the hatting industry were frequently exposed to mercury vapor, leading to mercury poisoning. The neurological symptoms of this poisoning, such as tremors, irritability, and dementia, gave rise to the expression \"mad as a hatter\".\n    *   Due to the high toxicity of mercury and its compounds, this process for making hats has been discontinued and replaced with safer methods.\n    *   Therefore, the making of a \"hat\" is the \"another X Y\" that has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the findings:**\n    *   Clue 1 points to Nikita Kucherov's \"awards hat trick\" at the 2019 NHL awards.\n    *   Clue 2 points to the obsolete and toxic process of \"hat\" making that used mercury salts.\n    *   Both clues logically and cleverly point to the same two-word phrase.\n\n4.  **Final Answer:** The X Y is \"Hat Trick\".\n\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
