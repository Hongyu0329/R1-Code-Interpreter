The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to the fixed, conformationally locked structure of the bicyclic Münchnone intermediate formed from proline. Unlike the Münchnone in Reactions 1 and 2, this intermediate cannot undergo equilibration of its substituents between the C2 and C4 positions. This results in a dipole with a permanent and significant steric and electronic asymmetry between its two reactive ends (C2-methyl vs. C4-fused ring). This large, fixed asymmetry enforces a strong preference for a single cycloaddition transition state that minimizes steric repulsion between the bulkiest parts of the reacting molecules, leading to one major product.

Reactions 1 and 2 provide the essential context for this conclusion. They show that when the substituents are similar and attached to a flexible backbone (two methyl groups), a rapid equilibrium between the C2 and C4 positions occurs, effectively symmetrizing the dipole. The contrast between the equilibrating system in Reactions 1/2 and the locked, rigid system in Reaction 3 demonstrates that the prevention of this equilibration due to the proline ring structure is the direct cause of the enhanced and predictable regioselectivity in Reaction 3.
