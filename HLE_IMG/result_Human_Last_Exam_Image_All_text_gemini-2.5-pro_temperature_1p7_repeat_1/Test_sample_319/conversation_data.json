    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question's Clues:**\n    *   The phenomenon is an \"illusion.\"\n    *   It is compared to the \"Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity.\" This tells us that the phenomenon involves a sensory input that can be interpreted by the brain in more than one way, and the brain chooses a specific interpretation that may not match the physical reality.\n    *   It reveals a \"common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability.\" This means it's a process our brains do automatically without our conscious effort.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Image Content:**\n    *   The image displays two representations of a sound over time.\n    *   **Top plot (Spectrogram):** This shows the frequency content of the sound over time. There is a single, constant horizontal line, representing a pure tone. In the middle, this line is interrupted and replaced by a wide vertical band. This vertical band represents a sound with a broad range of frequencies, such as a burst of static or noise. After the noise burst, the pure tone resumes.\n    *   **Bottom plot (Waveform):** This shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time. It starts as a clean, regular sine wave (the pure tone), then transitions to a chaotic, random-looking pattern (the noise), and finally returns to the clean sine wave.\n    *   **Conclusion from the image:** The physical stimulus is a pure tone that stops, is replaced by a burst of noise, and then starts again. There is a literal gap in the tone.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Clues and Image Analysis:**\n    *   The illusion must be auditory, as the image represents a sound.\n    *   The illusion occurs when a listener hears this specific sound sequence.\n    *   Despite the physical gap in the tone, the common perceptual experience is hearing the tone *continue uninterrupted* behind the noise. The brain \"fills in\" the missing part of the tone.\n    *   This \"filling in\" is the unconscious perceptual ability. The brain makes the logical inference that the tone likely continued but was masked by the louder noise, rather than assuming the tone coincidentally stopped just as the noise began and started again just as the noise ended.\n    *   This connects to the Necker Cube analogy: the physical sound is ambiguous (did the tone stop or was it masked?), and the brain resolves this ambiguity by creating a perception of continuity.\n\n4.  **Identify the Phenomenon's Name:**\n    *   This specific auditory illusion, where a sound is perceived as continuous through an interruption by another sound, is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**.\n    *   It is a classic example of a broader principle called perceptual restoration. When applied to speech sounds (e.g., hearing a phoneme that's been replaced by a cough), it's called the phonemic restoration effect. For a simple tone like this, \"Auditory Continuity Illusion\" is the most accurate and common name.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between the physical reality presented in the graphs (the tone is absent) and the subjective perceptual experience of the listener (the tone is heard as continuous).\n*   The comparison to the Necker Cube is a key hint pointing towards perceptual ambiguity and interpretation by the brain, rather than a simple sensory deficit.\n*   The spectrogram and waveform are two ways of visualizing the same event. Both clearly show the tone being replaced by the noise, not simply mixed with it.\n\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion"
