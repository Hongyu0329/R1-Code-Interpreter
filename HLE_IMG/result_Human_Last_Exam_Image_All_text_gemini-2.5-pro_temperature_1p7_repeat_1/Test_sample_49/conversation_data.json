    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks for the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$. A cutoff frequency is characteristic of a filter circuit. The given circuit is an RC filter, with the output voltage being the voltage across the capacitor $C$, which is the voltage at node $a_0$, let's call it $V_{a0}$.\n\n2.  **Circuit Model:** The circuit is a first-order RC filter. The resistor network and the input voltage source `IN` can be replaced by their Thevenin equivalent circuit as seen from the terminals of the capacitor ($a_0$ and ground). The Thevenin equivalent consists of a Thevenin voltage source $V_{th}$ in series with a Thevenin resistance $R_{th}$.\n\n3.  **Cutoff Frequency Formula:** For a first-order RC low-pass filter, the transfer function is of the form $H(s) = \\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = \\frac{1}{1+sR_{th}C}$. The cutoff angular frequency $\\omega_c$ is the frequency at which the magnitude of the transfer function drops to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its DC value. This occurs when the real and imaginary parts of the denominator are equal, i.e., $1 = \\omega_c R_{th}C$. Therefore, the cutoff angular frequency is given by:\n    $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$.\n    The problem reduces to finding the Thevenin resistance $R_{th}$.\n\n4.  **Finding Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$):**\n    *   To find $R_{th}$, we need to find the equivalent resistance seen from terminals $a_0$ and ground ($b_0$).\n    *   According to Thevenin's theorem, we must deactivate all independent sources. The input voltage source `IN` at node $c_0$ is an independent voltage source. Deactivating a voltage source means replacing it with a short circuit. Therefore, we ground node $c_0$.\n    *   So, $R_{th}$ is the equivalent resistance of the infinite resistive ladder between node $a_0$ and ground, with node $c_0$ also connected to ground.\n\n5.  **Solving for $R_{th}$ using Recurrence Relations:**\n    *   We will solve this by applying a test voltage $V_t$ at node $a_0$ and finding the resulting current $I_t$ flowing into the node. Then $R_{th} = V_t / I_t$. In this setup, we have $V_{a0} = V_t$ and $V_{c0} = 0$.\n    *   Let $V_{cn}$ and $V_{dn}$ be the voltages at nodes $c_n$ and $d_n$ respectively. We can write the Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) equations for each node. For any node $(c_n, d_n)$ with $n \\ge 1$:\n        KCL at $c_n$: $\\frac{V_{cn}-V_{c(n-1)}}{r} + \\frac{V_{cn}-V_{c(n+1)}}{r} + \\frac{V_{cn}-V_{dn}}{r} = 0 \\implies 3V_{cn}-V_{c(n-1)}-V_{c(n+1)}-V_{dn}=0$.\n        KCL at $d_n$: $\\frac{V_{dn}-V_{d(n-1)}}{r} + \\frac{V_{dn}-V_{d(n+1)}}{r} + \\frac{V_{dn}-V_{cn}}{r} = 0 \\implies 3V_{dn}-V_{d(n-1)}-V_{d(n+1)}-V_{cn}=0$. (Here $d_0$ refers to node $a_0$).\n\n    *   This system of coupled difference equations can be simplified by defining symmetric ($S_n=V_{cn}+V_{dn}$) and anti-symmetric ($D_n=V_{cn}-V_{dn}$) combinations.\n        Adding the two KCL equations gives a recurrence for $S_n$: $S_{n+1} - 2S_n + S_{n-1} = 0$.\n        Subtracting the two KCL equations gives a recurrence for $D_n$: $D_{n+1} - 4D_n + D_{n-1} = 0$.\n        These recurrence relations are valid for $n \\ge 2$.\n\n    *   **Boundary Conditions:**\n        1.  At infinity ($n \\to \\infty$): The circuit is passive, so voltages must decay to zero. $V_{cn} \\to 0$ and $V_{dn} \\to 0$. This implies $S_n \\to 0$ and $D_n \\to 0$.\n        2.  The solution to $S_{n+1} - 2S_n + S_{n-1} = 0$ is $S_n = A + Bn$. For $S_n \\to 0$, we must have $A=0, B=0$. Thus, $S_n=0$ for all $n \\geq 2$.\n        3.  The solution to $D_{n+1} - 4D_n + D_{n-1} = 0$ has a characteristic equation $\\lambda^2 - 4\\lambda + 1 = 0$, with roots $\\lambda = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}$. For a decaying solution, we must choose the root $|\\lambda| < 1$, which is $\\lambda = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$. So, $D_n = K \\cdot (2-\\sqrt{3})^n$ for large $n$. We assume this form holds for $n \\ge 1$, so $D_n = D_1 \\lambda^{n-1}$.\n\n    *   **Solving at the boundary $n=1$**: We write KCL equations for $c_1$ and $d_1$ and express them in terms of $S_1, D_1, S_2, D_2$ and the sources $V_{c0}$ and $V_{a0}$.\n        Summing KCL at $c_1,d_1$: $2S_1 - S_2 = V_{c0} + V_{a0}$.\n        Differencing KCL at $c_1,d_1$: $4D_1 - D_2 = V_{c0} - V_{a0}$.\n        Substituting the boundary conditions ($V_{c0}=0, V_{a0}=V_t$) and the consequences from the behavior at infinity ($S_2=0$ and $D_2=\\lambda D_1$):\n        $2S_1 - 0 = 0 + V_t \\implies S_1 = V_t/2$.\n        $4D_1 - \\lambda D_1 = 0 - V_t \\implies D_1(4-\\lambda) = -V_t \\implies D_1 = \\frac{-V_t}{4-(2-\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{-V_t}{2+\\sqrt{3}} = -V_t(2-\\sqrt{3})$.\n\n    *   **Finding $V_{d1}$**: We have a system of two equations for $V_{c1}$ and $V_{d1}$:\n        $S_1 = V_{c1} + V_{d1} = V_t/2$\n        $D_1 = V_{c1} - V_{d1} = -V_t(2-\\sqrt{3})$\n        To find $V_{d1}$, subtract the second equation from the first:\n        $2V_{d1} = S_1 - D_1 = V_t/2 - (-V_t(2-\\sqrt{3})) = V_t(\\frac{1}{2} + 2 - \\sqrt{3}) = V_t(\\frac{5}{2} - \\sqrt{3})$.\n        $V_{d1} = V_t(\\frac{5}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})$.\n\n    *   **Calculate $R_{th}$**: The current $I_t$ flowing into node $a_0$ is given by KCL at $a_0$: $I_t = \\frac{V_{a0}-V_{d1}}{r} = \\frac{V_t-V_{d1}}{r}$.\n        $R_{th} = \\frac{V_t}{I_t} = \\frac{V_t}{(V_t-V_{d1})/r} = \\frac{r}{1 - V_{d1}/V_t}$.\n        Substituting the expression for $V_{d1}/V_t$:\n        $R_{th} = \\frac{r}{1 - (\\frac{5}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})} = \\frac{r}{1 - \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{r}{-\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{r}{\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}-1}{4}}$.\n        $R_{th} = \\frac{4r}{2\\sqrt{3}-1}$.\n\n6.  **Final Answer:** Substitute $R_{th}$ back into the formula for the cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$.\n    $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{4r}{2\\sqrt{3}-1}\\right)C} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}-1}{4rC}$.\n\nThe cutoff frequency at node $a_0$ is $\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}-1}{4rC}$. Note that this is the angular frequency $\\omega_c$. The cyclic frequency $f_c$ would be $\\frac{\\omega_c}{2\\pi}$. As is common in engineering formulas, \"frequency\" often implies angular frequency when not specified.\n\nFinal expression: $\\omega_c = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}-1}{4rC}$.\n\n<<<f_c = (2*sqrt(3)-1)/(4*r*C)>>>"
