    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to identify the figure leaving the chariot.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Scene**\nThe image is from an ancient Greek red-figure vase. It depicts a dramatic scene involving a chariot. We can see:\n*   A two-wheeled chariot moving from right to left.\n*   Two figures inside the chariot: a driver and a passenger.\n*   The hindquarters of a white horse pulling the chariot.\n*   A large white wing hovering above the scene, possibly attached to the horse or symbolizing divine intervention/victory.\n*   A male figure on the ground, positioned in front of the chariot wheel, seemingly having fallen or been thrown. He is depicted in a state of collapse or death.\n*   Decorative patterns typical of Greek vase painting, such as the wave pattern (running dog) at the bottom and palmettes on the side.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the Figures in Detail**\n*   **The Driver:** This figure wears an ornate, spotted sleeve and a distinctive headdress, which appears to be a Phrygian cap. In Greek art, this cap was used to denote people from the East, particularly Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) or Troy. The driver is actively controlling the chariot.\n*   **The Passenger:** A figure, likely female, sits beside the driver, wrapped in drapery. She looks back towards the right.\n*   **The Fallen Figure:** This is a mature, muscular, nude male figure lying on his back. His body is contorted, with his arms thrown out to the sides, indicating a violent fall or death. He is positioned directly in the path of the chariot. This is the figure \"leaving the chariot,\" though involuntarily.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the Mythological Context**\nThe combination of a chariot race, a male-female pair in the victorious chariot, and a defeated figure falling from his own chariot strongly suggests a specific Greek myth: the story of Pelops and Oinomaos.\n\n*   **The Myth:** King Oinomaos of Pisa challenged any suitor for his daughter Hippodamia's hand to a chariot race. Oinomaos had divine horses from his father, Ares, and always won, killing the defeated suitors. Pelops, a prince from Lydia (in Anatolia), challenged him.\n*   **The Victory:** According to the most famous version of the myth, Pelops won by sabotaging Oinomaos's chariot. He bribed Oinomaos's charioteer, Myrtilus, to replace the chariot's bronze linchpins with wax ones. During the race, the wax melted, the wheels fell off, and Oinomaos was entangled in the reins and dragged to his death. Pelops then took Hippodamia as his bride.\n*   **Matching the Myth to the Image:**\n    *   The driver in the Phrygian cap is **Pelops**. His cap signifies his Lydian/Anatolian origin.\n    *   The female passenger is **Hippodamia**, the prize of the race.\n    *   The fallen figure is **King Oinomaos**, who has just crashed and is dying. His position on the ground after being thrown from his chariot perfectly matches the myth.\n    *   The wing can symbolize the winged horses given to Pelops by the god Poseidon in another version of the myth, or it could belong to a figure of Nike (Victory) or Eros, celebrating Pelops's triumph.\n\n**Step 4: Concluding the Identity of the Fallen Figure**\nBased on the iconographic evidence and the narrative of the myth of Pelops, the figure depicted falling or having fallen from the chariot is King Oinomaos. The question \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\" refers to this defeated king at the moment of his demise.\n\n<<<Oinomaos>>>"
