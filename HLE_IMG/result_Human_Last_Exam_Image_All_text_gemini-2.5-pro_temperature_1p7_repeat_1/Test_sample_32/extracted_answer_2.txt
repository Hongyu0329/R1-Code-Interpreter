The main difference is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is very short and straight, causing the capsule to be erect and appear immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctive longer, curved (cygneous) seta, which causes the capsule to nod or hang down.
