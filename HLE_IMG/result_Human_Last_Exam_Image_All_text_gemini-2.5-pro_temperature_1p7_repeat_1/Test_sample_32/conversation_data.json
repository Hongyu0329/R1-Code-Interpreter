    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core components of a moss sporophyte.**\nA moss sporophyte is the spore-producing generation and typically consists of three main parts:\n*   **Foot:** The basal part that anchors the sporophyte to the gametophyte (the leafy green plant) and absorbs nutrients.\n*   **Seta:** A stalk that elevates the capsule. The length, color, and curvature of the seta are important identification features.\n*   **Capsule:** The sporangium at the top of the seta that contains the spores. Its shape, orientation, and features like the peristome (teeth around the mouth) are also key characters.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the specific epithet (species name) for clues.**\nThe names of species often describe a key characteristic.\n*   *Grimmia montana*: The name *montana* refers to its typical habitat (mountains) and doesn't give a direct clue about the sporophyte structure.\n*   *Grimmia curviseta*: This name is highly descriptive. \"Curvi-\" is Latin for curved, and \"seta\" refers to the stalk of the sporophyte. Therefore, the name itself tells us this species has a **curved seta**.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the sporophyte of *Grimmia montana*.**\n*   The image provided shows numerous brown, urn-shaped capsules nestled among the grey-green leafy shoots.\n*   **Careful Point:** Observe the connection between the capsule and the leafy plant. There is no visible, elongated stalk. The capsules appear sessile (stalkless) or immersed directly among the leaves.\n*   Botanical descriptions confirm that *Grimmia montana* has a very **short and straight seta**. This causes the capsule to be erect and emergent to immersed among the perichaetial leaves (the specialized leaves at the tip of the stem where the sporophyte grows).\n\n**Step 4: Characterize the sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta*.**\n*   As its name implies, *Grimmia curviseta* is defined by its seta.\n*   **Careful Point:** Unlike *G. montana*, the seta of *G. curviseta* is well-developed, exserted (extends beyond the leaves), and distinctly **curved**, often in a swan-neck shape (cygneous).\n*   This curvature causes the capsule to be nodding (cernuous) or even hanging, rather than erect.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the comparison to find the main distinguishing feature.**\n*   The primary and most easily observed difference between the sporophytes of the two species is the **seta**.\n*   **Grimmia montana:** Short, straight seta, resulting in an erect, immersed capsule.\n*   **Grimmia curviseta:** Longer, curved (cygneous) seta, resulting in a nodding or hanging capsule.\n*   This difference in the seta's length and curvature leads to a dramatic difference in the overall presentation and orientation of the capsule, making it a reliable feature for distinguishing the two species \"at a glance\" when they are fertile.\n\n<<<The main difference is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is very short and straight, causing the capsule to be erect and appear immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctive longer, curved (cygneous) seta, which causes the capsule to nod or hang down.>>>"
