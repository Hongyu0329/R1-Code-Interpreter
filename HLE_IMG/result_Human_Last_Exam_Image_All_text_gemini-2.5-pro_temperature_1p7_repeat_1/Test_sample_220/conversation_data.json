    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks to identify the crystal lattice pattern that corresponds to a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure when viewed along the [110] direction. This means we need to know what the 2D projection of an FCC lattice looks like from this specific viewpoint.\n\n2.  **Theoretical Pattern of FCC [110] Projection:**\n    *   **Crystal Structure:** A face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice has atoms at the 8 corners of a cube and at the center of each of the 6 faces. Let the lattice constant (the side length of the cube) be 'a'.\n    *   **Viewing Direction:** The [110] direction is a vector along the face diagonal of the cube. We are looking \"down\" this diagonal.\n    *   **Projection Plane:** The atoms are projected onto a 2D plane perpendicular to the [110] direction. The axes of this plane can be chosen along the [001] direction (the vertical edge of the cube) and the [1-10] direction (the other face diagonal perpendicular to the viewing direction).\n    *   **Resulting Pattern:** When the 3D atomic positions of an FCC lattice are projected onto this plane, they form a **centered rectangular pattern**.\n    *   **Aspect Ratio:** The unit cell of this projected pattern is a rectangle. The side lengths of this rectangle correspond to the atomic periodicities along the two perpendicular directions in the plane: `a` (along the [001] direction) and `a√2` (along the [1-10] direction). Therefore, the aspect ratio of the sides of the rectangle is `(a√2) / a = √2 ≈ 1.414`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Given Options:** Now we need to examine each image (A, B, C, D) to see which one matches this theoretical description: a centered rectangular pattern with an aspect ratio of approximately `√2`.\n\n    *   **Image A:** This pattern shows atoms arranged in a simple rectangular grid. There are no atoms in the centers of the rectangles. This pattern is not centered. Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Image B:** The arrangement of atoms in this image does not appear to form a regular, repeating lattice. It lacks the clear periodicity of a crystal projection. It is not a centered rectangular pattern. Therefore, B is incorrect.\n\n    *   **Image C:** This pattern shows atoms that can be interpreted as forming a centered rectangular lattice. We can identify atoms at the corners of a rectangle and an atom in the middle. Let's estimate the aspect ratio from the coordinates.\n        *   We can define a rectangular cell with corners at approximately `(1, 7.5)`, `(9, 7.5)`, `(1, 14)`, and `(9, 14)` (assuming the pattern is periodic, even if one corner atom is not shown). A centering atom is visible near `(5, 12)`.\n        *   The side lengths of this rectangle are `width = 9 - 1 = 8` units and `height = 14 - 7.5 = 6.5` units.\n        *   The aspect ratio is `width / height = 8 / 6.5 ≈ 1.23`. This value is significantly different from `√2 ≈ 1.414`.\n\n    *   **Image D:** This pattern also clearly shows a centered rectangular lattice. The pattern is very regular and fills the provided box. Let's identify a unit cell and its aspect ratio.\n        *   We can identify a unit cell with corners at `(1, 6)`, `(5, 6)`, `(1, 12)`, and `(5, 12)`.\n        *   The centering atoms for this grid are at `y ≈ 8.5-9`. For the chosen cell, the center is at `(3, 8.5)`. This fits the centered rectangular description perfectly.\n        *   The side lengths of this rectangle are `width = 5 - 1 = 4` units and `height = 12 - 6 = 6` units.\n        *   The aspect ratio can be `height / width = 6 / 4 = 1.5` or `width / height = 4 / 6 ≈ 0.67`. The value 1.5 is very close to the theoretical value of `√2 ≈ 1.414`. The difference is only about 6%.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Both C and D exhibit the correct centered rectangular topology.\n    *   However, when comparing their aspect ratios to the theoretical value of `√2`, pattern D (`ratio ≈ 1.5`) is a much better geometric match than pattern C (`ratio ≈ 1.23`).\n    *   The slight discrepancy in D's ratio from the exact value of `√2` is expected in a schematic drawing. C's discrepancy is much larger.\n    *   Therefore, D is the best representation of an FCC structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
