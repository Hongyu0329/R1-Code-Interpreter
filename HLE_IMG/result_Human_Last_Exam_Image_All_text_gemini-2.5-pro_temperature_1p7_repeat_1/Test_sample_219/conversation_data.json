    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph**\nThe provided image is a raster plot.\n*   The **x-axis** represents Time, measured in seconds (s), from 0 to over 50.\n*   The **y-axis** represents the Electrode Number, from 0 to 128, indicating different recording sites in a neuronal culture.\n*   Each **black dot** represents a neuronal firing event (a \"spike\") detected by a specific electrode at a specific time.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts**\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a period where a large number of neurons fire in a coordinated manner within a short time window. On the raster plot, these bursts appear as dense vertical bands of dots, indicating high firing activity across many electrodes simultaneously.\n\nBy visually inspecting the graph, we can identify four major synchronized bursts. We need to estimate the timestamp corresponding to the center of each of these bursts.\n\n*   **Burst 1:** A clear burst is visible near the beginning of the recording. It appears to be centered at approximately **4 seconds**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The next major network burst is located between 10 s and 20 s. It is centered at approximately **17 seconds**.\n*   **Burst 3:** A very strong and dense burst occurs between 30 s and 40 s. Its center can be estimated at **36 seconds**.\n*   **Burst 4:** Another clear burst is seen near the end of the recording window. It is centered at approximately **49 seconds**.\n\nSo, the timestamps of the synchronized bursts are approximately 4 s, 17 s, 36 s, and 49 s.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time duration between the centers of consecutive synchronized bursts. With four bursts identified, we have three intervals to calculate.\n\n*   **Interval 1 (between Burst 1 and Burst 2):**\n    IBI₁ = 17 s - 4 s = 13 s\n\n*   **Interval 2 (between Burst 2 and Burst 3):**\n    IBI₂ = 36 s - 17 s = 19 s\n\n*   **Interval 3 (between Burst 3 and Burst 4):**\n    IBI₃ = 49 s - 36 s = 13 s\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual intervals and divide by the number of intervals.\n\n*   Sum of IBIs = 13 s + 19 s + 13 s = 45 s\n*   Number of intervals = 3\n*   Average IBI = 45 s / 3 = 15 s\n\n**Step 5: Round to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question requires the final answer to be given to two significant figures. The calculated average is 15 s. The number \"15\" consists of two digits, both of which are significant. Therefore, the value is already in the correct format.\n\n<<<15>>>"
