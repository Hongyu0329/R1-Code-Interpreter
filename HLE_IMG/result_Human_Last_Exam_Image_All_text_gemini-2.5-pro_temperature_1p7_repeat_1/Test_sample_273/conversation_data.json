    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Chiral Centers and Connectivity:**\n    First, we need to understand the molecule's structure and identify all chiral centers (carbon atoms bonded to four different groups). The provided image is a line-angle formula with stereochemical indicators (wedges and dashes).\n\n    *   The molecule has a carbon backbone. Let's analyze the connectivity from the drawing. There are three carbon atoms that are potential stereocenters along the main chain depicted.\n    *   **Leftmost Chiral Center (let's call it C_a):** This carbon is bonded to a hydroxyl (-OH) group, a methyl (-CH3) group, the rest of the carbon chain (to its right), and an implied hydrogen atom. The drawing shows the bonds to -OH and -CH3 as dashed lines (going into the page), and the bond to the rest of the chain as a solid line (in the plane of the page). For a tetrahedral carbon, this implies the fourth bond, to the hydrogen atom, must be a wedged bond (coming out of the page). Since it's bonded to four different groups (-OH, -CH3, -H, and the rest of the molecule), it is a chiral center.\n    *   **Middle Chiral Center (let's call it C_b):** This carbon is bonded to the left part of the chain (C_a), the right part of the chain (C_c), an ethyl (-CH2CH3) group, and an implied hydrogen atom. The bonds to the chain (left and right) are in the plane. The bond to the ethyl group is wedged (coming out). This implies the bond to the hydrogen is dashed (going in). It is bonded to four different groups, so it is a chiral center.\n    *   **Rightmost Chiral Center (let's call it C_c):** This carbon is bonded to the middle part of the chain (C_b), a methyl (-CH3) group, an aminomethyl (-CH2NH2) group, and an implied hydrogen atom. The bond to the chain (C_b) is in the plane. The bond to the methyl group is dashed (going in), and the bond to the aminomethyl group is wedged (coming out). For a tetrahedral carbon, this implies the bond to the hydrogen atom is in the plane of the page. It is bonded to four different groups, so it is a chiral center.\n\n2.  **Determine the IUPAC Name and Numbering:**\n    To state the absolute configuration, we need to number the chiral centers according to IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n    *   **Principal Functional Group:** We have two functional groups: alcohol (-OH) and amine (-NH2). According to IUPAC priority rules, alcohols have higher priority than amines. Therefore, the molecule is named as an alcohol (ending in -ol).\n    *   **Parent Chain:** The parent chain is the longest continuous carbon chain that contains the carbon atom bonded to the -OH group (the carbinol carbon, C_a).\n    *   Tracing the chains through C_a, we find the longest chain has 5 carbons (e.g., from the methyl on C_a, through C_a, C_b, C_c, to the methyl on C_c). All other chains containing C_a are also 5 carbons long. If we pick a 6-carbon chain (e.g., from the ethyl group's methyl, through C_b, C_c, and to the methyl on C_c), it would not contain C_a, so it cannot be the parent chain.\n    *   When there's a tie in length for the parent chain, we choose the one with the most substituents. Let's check our choices. Let's analyze the connectivity as 3-ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-methylpentan-1-amine if we named it as an amine. Let's check if naming it as an alcohol is consistent. Naming it as a pentanol will lead to a very complex substituent name. A common practice for polyfunctional molecules is to choose the principal functional group and name the parent chain that gives it the lowest number, and it contains it. Naming as an amine is clearer. The longest chain containing the carbon attached to the amine is a 5-carbon chain.\n    *   Let's name it as an amine for clarity, as it avoids complex substituent names: The C in -CH2NH2 is C1. The chain is C1-C(c)-C(b)-C(a)-C(a's Me). This is a pentane chain.\n        *   C1 is the carbon of the -CH2NH2 group.\n        *   C2 is our C_c, which has a methyl group.\n        *   C3 is our C_b, which has an ethyl group.\n        *   C4 is our C_a, which has a hydroxyl group.\n        *   C5 is the terminal methyl group attached to C_a.\n    *   The IUPAC name is **3-Ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-methylpentan-1-amine**.\n    *   The chiral centers are C2, C3, and C4.\n\n3.  **Assign Priorities and Determine Configuration for Each Center:**\n\n    *   **Configuration at C4 (C_a):**\n        *   **Groups:** -OH, -CH(C2H5)CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (the C3-group), -CH3, -H.\n        *   **Priorities (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog):**\n            1.  -OH (highest atomic number O=8)\n            2.  -C3-group (C bonded to two other C's)\n            3.  -CH3 (C bonded to three H's)\n            4.  -H (lowest atomic number)\n        *   **Orientation:** H (4) is wedged (front). OH (1) is dashed (back). C3-group (2) is in-plane. CH3 (3) is dashed (back).\n        *   **Determination:** With the lowest priority group (4) pointing towards the viewer, we trace the path 1 -> 2 -> 3. This path is counter-clockwise (S). Because the lowest priority group is in the front, we must reverse the assignment. So, S becomes R.\n        *   **Configuration at C4 is R.**\n\n    *   **Configuration at C3 (C_b):**\n        *   **Groups:** -C4-group (-CH(OH)CH3), -C2-group (-CH(CH3)CH2NH2), -C2H5 (ethyl), -H.\n        *   **Priorities:**\n            1.  -C4-group (C is bonded to O, C, H)\n            2.  -C2-group (C is bonded to C, C, H)\n            3.  -Ethyl group (C is bonded to C, H, H)\n            4.  -H\n        *   **Orientation:** H (4) is dashed (back). C4-group (1) is in-plane. C2-group (2) is in-plane. Ethyl group (3) is wedged (front).\n        *   **Determination:** With the lowest priority group (4) in the back, we trace the path 1 -> 2 -> 3. The path goes from the C4-group (left) to the C2-group (right) to the Ethyl group (up/front). This is a clockwise direction.\n        *   **Configuration at C3 is R.**\n\n    *   **Configuration at C2 (C_c):**\n        *   **Groups:** -C3-group, -CH2NH2, -CH3, -H.\n        *   **Priorities:**\n            1.  -CH2NH2 (the C is bonded to N, H, H; N has a higher atomic number than C).\n            2.  -C3-group (the C is bonded to C, C, H).\n            3.  -CH3 (the C is bonded to H, H, H).\n            4.  -H\n        *   **Orientation:** H (4) is in-plane. -CH2NH2 (1) is wedged (front). -C3-group (2) is in-plane. -CH3 (3) is dashed (back).\n        *   **Determination:** The lowest priority group (4) is in the plane. We can use the swap method. Swap the position of H (4) and the dashed -CH3 (3). Now H is in the back. The new arrangement of the other groups is: -CH2NH2 (1, wedged), -C3-group (2, in-plane), and -CH3 (3, in-plane). Tracing the path 1 -> 2 -> 3 is clockwise (R). Since we performed one swap, the original configuration is the opposite. So, R becomes S.\n        *   **Configuration at C2 is S.**\n\n4.  **Final Answer:**\n    Combining the configurations with their IUPAC numbering:\n    *   C2 is S\n    *   C3 is R\n    *   C4 is R\n\n    The absolute configuration of the molecule is (2S, 3R, 4R).\n\n<<< (2S, 3R, 4R) >>>"
