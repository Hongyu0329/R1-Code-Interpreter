    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe goal is to calculate the percentage reduction of Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) when moving from the \"Baseline\" (Table 1) scenario to the \"Proposed\" (Table 2) scenario.\n\n**Key Concept:**\nVehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) is a measure of the total distance traveled by vehicles. To find the total VMT, we need to consider the number of trips, the mode of transport, and the distance of those trips. The calculation can be performed for a representative sample of total trips, as the final result is a percentage, making the absolute number of total trips irrelevant.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the weighted VMT for the Baseline scenario.**\nWe will calculate a VMT index for each distance bracket and then sum them. The formula for each bracket is:\n`VMT Index = (Share of Total Trips) × (Total Car Mode Share) × (Average Trip Distance)`\n\n*   **Total Car Mode Share** is the sum of the shares for \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n*   The data on \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" is not required for calculating VMT, as VMT measures vehicle travel, not person travel.\n\n**Baseline VMT Calculation (Table 1):**\n*   **0-3 miles bracket:**\n    *   Car Share = 25% + 28% = 53%\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.48 (share of trips) × 0.53 (car share) × 1 (miles) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles bracket:**\n    *   Car Share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles bracket:**\n    *   Car Share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles bracket:**\n    *   Car Share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = 2.8480\n\n**Total Baseline VMT Index:**\nVMT_Baseline = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the weighted VMT for the Proposed scenario.**\nUsing the same formula with data from Table 2.\n\n**Proposed VMT Calculation (Table 2):**\n*   **0-3 miles bracket:**\n    *   Car Share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.48 × 0.03 × 1 = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles bracket:**\n    *   Car Share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles bracket:**\n    *   Car Share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles bracket:**\n    *   Car Share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = 1.5680\n\n**Total Proposed VMT Index:**\nVMT_Proposed = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT.**\nThe formula for percentage reduction is:\n`Percentage Reduction = ((VMT_Baseline - VMT_Proposed) / VMT_Baseline) × 100`\n\n*   Reduction in VMT = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   Percentage Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100 ≈ 52.195%\n\n**Final Answer:**\nRounding the result to one decimal place gives 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
