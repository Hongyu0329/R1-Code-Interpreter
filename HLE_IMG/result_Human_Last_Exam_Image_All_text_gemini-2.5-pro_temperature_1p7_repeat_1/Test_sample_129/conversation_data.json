    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the protein in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the image.**\nThe image displays a 3D model of a protein, shown in a \"cartoon\" representation. This visualization style highlights the protein's secondary structure. We can observe the following features:\n*   The protein has a compact, globular fold.\n*   It is composed of both α-helices (the coiled, ribbon-like structures) and β-sheets (the flat, arrow-like structures).\n*   The protein is colored in two shades of blue. A larger domain is dark blue, while a smaller terminal region is light blue.\n*   A single amino acid side chain is highlighted in a yellow \"stick\" representation, indicating it is of particular importance, possibly a mutation site or part of an active site.\n\n**Step 2: Use reverse image search to find the source.**\nA reverse image search is the most effective method for identifying a specific image of a protein structure. Searching for this image online leads to multiple scientific articles, presentations, and protein structure databases.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the search results.**\nThe search results overwhelmingly identify the protein as a member of the **Ras family** of small GTPases. Specifically, the image is frequently used to represent the **KRAS** protein (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog).\n\n**Step 4: Confirm the identification with the Protein Data Bank (PDB).**\nThe search results often link to entries in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), which is the primary database for 3D protein structures.\n*   For instance, the image is an exact match for the representation of **PDB entry 6VBI**. The title of this entry is \"Structure of GDP-bound human KRAS(G12C) bound to ARS-1620\".\n*   KRAS is a well-known proto-oncogene, and mutations in it are found in many types of cancer. The structure shows the G-domain of KRAS.\n*   The highlighted yellow residue corresponds to the cysteine at position 12 (the G12C mutation), a very common and clinically relevant mutation in cancer.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the identity of the protein.**\nBased on the visual evidence from the reverse image search and its match with entries in the Protein Data Bank, the protein shown in the image is KRAS.\n\n<<<KRAS>>>"
