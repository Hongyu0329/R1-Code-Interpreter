    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants, Product, and Reaction Conditions.**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆). This is a substituted aromatic compound with a 6π electron system.\n    *   **Reactant 2:** This is a four-membered ring with a double bond. Let's analyze its molecular formula. The drawing shows two hydrogen atoms on the saturated carbons. Assuming the carbons of the double bond are also bonded to one hydrogen each to satisfy valency, the formula would be C₄H₄. This is cyclobutadiene, an antiaromatic 4π electron system. If we assume it is cyclobutene (C₄H₆), then the overall reaction would involve the loss of two hydrogen atoms (C₆F₆ + C₄H₆ → C₁₀F₆H₄ + H₂), which is not a pericyclic reaction. Therefore, the second reactant is most likely cyclobutadiene (C₄H₄), even though the drawing shows only one double bond instead of two. This is a common simplification or error in chemical drawings.\n    *   **Product:** A tricyclic molecule with the formula C₁₀F₆H₄, which is the sum of the atoms in the reactants (C₆F₆ + C₄H₄). The product is an adduct of the two starting materials.\n    *   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hv` (light energy).\n    *   **Key Information:** The problem explicitly states that \"Two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur\".\n\n2.  **Propose a Reaction Sequence.**\n    The overall transformation is an addition of cyclobutadiene to hexafluorobenzene, followed by an intramolecular rearrangement. We need to find two sequential pericyclic reactions that are both allowed under photochemical conditions.\n\n3.  **Identify the First Pericyclic Reaction.**\n    *   The first step is likely an intermolecular reaction between the two reactants. A common pericyclic reaction between a diene (cyclobutadiene, a 4π system) and a dienophile (one double bond of hexafluorobenzene, a 2π system) is a cycloaddition reaction.\n    *   This is a [4π + 2π] cycloaddition (a Diels-Alder type reaction).\n    *   According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a thermal [4s + 2s] (s = suprafacial) cycloaddition is allowed. A photochemical [4s + 2s] cycloaddition is forbidden. However, a photochemical cycloaddition is allowed if one of the components reacts in an antarafacial (a) manner, e.g., [4s + 2a] or [4a + 2s]. Given that the problem states it's a photochemically allowed pericyclic reaction, we conclude that the first step is a photochemical **[4π + 2π] cycloaddition**.\n    *   This reaction forms an intermediate, which is a hexafluoro-bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene. This molecule consists of a six-membered ring fused to a four-membered ring.\n\n4.  **Identify the Second Pericyclic Reaction.**\n    *   Let's analyze the structure of the intermediate formed in step 3. The hexafluoro-bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene contains a conjugated diene system within its six-membered ring.\n    *   This conjugated diene is a 4π electron system.\n    *   Conjugated polyenes can undergo electrocyclic reactions. For a 4π system, the Woodward-Hoffmann rules predict that the electrocyclic ring closure is allowed under photochemical conditions (and proceeds in a conrotatory manner).\n    *   This intramolecular ring closure transforms the diene part of the six-membered ring into a new four-membered ring, resulting in a tricyclic system.\n    *   Therefore, the second step is a photochemical **[4π] electrocyclic reaction**.\n\n5.  **Verify the Final Product Structure.**\n    *   The two-step sequence—a photochemical [4π + 2π] cycloaddition followed by a photochemical [4π] electrocyclic reaction—produces a derivative of tricyclo[4.2.0.0²,⁵]octadiene.\n    *   This skeleton is composed of a central six-membered ring fused to two four-membered rings. While the 2D drawing provided in the problem is a simplified representation, its topology is consistent with the product of this well-established reaction sequence.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe transformation involves two sequential photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions:\n1.  A **[4π + 2π] cycloaddition** between cyclobutadiene and hexafluorobenzene.\n2.  A **[4π] electrocyclic reaction** of the resulting adduct.\n\n<<<[4π + 2π] cycloaddition and [4π] electrocyclic reaction>>>"
