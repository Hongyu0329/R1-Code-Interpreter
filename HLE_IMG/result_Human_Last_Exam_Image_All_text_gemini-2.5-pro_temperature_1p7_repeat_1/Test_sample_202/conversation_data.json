    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens:\n\n**Analysis Strategy:**\nTo identify each rock specimen, we will examine its primary visual characteristics, including texture (grain size, shape, and arrangement) and composition (indicated by color and visible minerals). Based on these characteristics, we can classify the rock into one of the three main types (igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic) and then determine its specific name.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a very porous, spongy appearance. It is covered in small holes or cavities, which are called vesicles. The solid part of the rock between the vesicles appears to be fine-grained (aphanitic), meaning individual crystals are not visible to the naked eye.\n    *   **Careful Points:** The high number of vesicles indicates that the rock formed from lava that was full of gas bubbles. As the lava cooled quickly at the Earth's surface, the gases escaped, leaving behind these holes. This points to an extrusive igneous (volcanic) origin.\n    *   **Identification:** A reddish-brown, highly vesicular, extrusive igneous rock is known as **scoria**. It typically forms from mafic to intermediate lava, such as basalt or andesite. The reddish color is due to the oxidation of iron.\n\n2.  **Analyze Specimen J:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock is very light in color (white to light grey) and, like specimen H, is extremely vesicular and appears low in density. It has a frothy, glassy texture.\n    *   **Careful Points:** The extreme vesicularity again indicates a rapid, gas-rich volcanic eruption. The key difference from scoria (H) is its light color. Light-colored igneous rocks are felsic, meaning they are rich in silica.\n    *   **Identification:** A lightweight, highly vesicular, felsic volcanic rock is called **pumice**. Due to its high porosity, pumice is often low-density enough to float on water.\n\n3.  **Analyze Specimen I:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock is composed of numerous fragments, or clasts, that are cemented together. The clasts are of various sizes and rock types, including a prominent reddish piece. The key feature is that the clasts are sharp and **angular**. The material cementing them together (the matrix) is fine-grained.\n    *   **Careful Points:** A rock made of cemented fragments is a clastic rock, which is typically sedimentary. The defining characteristic for naming this type of rock is the shape and size of the clasts. Since the clasts are larger than sand and are angular, not rounded, it cannot be a conglomerate or sandstone.\n    *   **Identification:** A clastic rock composed of cemented, angular fragments larger than 2 mm is called a **breccia**. Breccias can form from landslides, fault movements, or explosive volcanic eruptions (volcanic breccia).\n\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:**\n    *   **Observation:** This rock is also composed of large, pebble-to-cobble sized clasts cemented together. However, in contrast to specimen I, these clasts are distinctly **rounded** or sub-rounded. The clasts are of various colors (white, pinkish, dark grey), indicating they come from different source rocks.\n    *   **Careful Points:** Like breccia, this is a coarse-grained clastic sedimentary rock. The rounding of the clasts is a critical diagnostic feature. It indicates that the rock fragments were transported by a medium like a river or stream for a significant distance, which abraded and smoothed their sharp edges.\n    *   **Identification:** A clastic sedimentary rock composed of cemented, rounded gravel-sized clasts is called a **conglomerate**.\n\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** A vesicular, reddish-brown volcanic rock. -> **Scoria**\n*   **I:** A rock made of large, angular fragments cemented together. -> **Breccia**\n*   **J:** A very lightweight, light-colored, vesicular volcanic rock. -> **Pumice**\n*   **K:** A rock made of large, rounded pebbles cemented together. -> **Conglomerate**\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Conglomerate>>>"
