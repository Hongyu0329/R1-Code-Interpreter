The image displays a dimorphic fungus, most characteristically *Candida* species. The morphology observed consists of two forms: 1) oval, budding yeast cells (blastoconidia) and 2) filamentous structures known as pseudohyphae, which are identified by the distinct constrictions at the septa (cell junctions).
