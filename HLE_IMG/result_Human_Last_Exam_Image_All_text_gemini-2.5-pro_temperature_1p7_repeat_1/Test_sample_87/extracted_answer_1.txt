**Product A:**
The structure of A is a tricyclic compound with the molecular formula C14H20N2O3. It is a derivative of a 3a,8-dihydro-3H-pyrrolo[2,1-b]quinazoline. The structure features a pyrrolidine ring fused to a dihydropyrimidine ring, which is in turn fused to another six-membered ring containing a methoxycarbonyl group.
(A chemical drawing of 11-methoxycarbonyl-10-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)-2,3,5,6,10,10a-hexahydro-1H-pyrrolo[2',1':2,3]imidazo[4,5-c]pyridine, or a similar complex structure resulting from the ylide/2-alkyne cascade is appropriate).
A plausible, simplified representation is a dihydropyridine ring formed from the cascade, fused with the proline ring and retaining the N-substituent and two ester groups, with subsequent hydrolysis and decarboxylation giving the C14 skeleton.
A specific drawing of A: A 5,6-fused bicyclic core (pyrrolizidine). At the bridgehead N, the pyrrolinyl substituent is attached. On the 5-membered ring formed by cycloaddition, there is a `CH-COOCH3` group and another chain `-CH2-CH(COOCH3)-CH2-` that has cyclized back onto the C2 of the proline ring, forming a third 6-membered ring.

**Product B:**
The structure of B is a 4-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)-2-(methoxycarbonyl)-2,3,5,6-tetrahydro-1H-pyrrolizin-7-one. It has a pyrrolizidine core (two fused five-membered rings with a shared nitrogen). The bridgehead nitrogen is substituted with the 2-pyrrolinyl group. One of the rings of the core (derived from proline) contains a ketone (`C=O`) at the C-7 position (the original C4 of proline). The other five-membered ring (from the cycloaddition) contains a double bond and a methoxycarbonyl group (`-COOCH3`).

**Product C:**
The structure of C is acetic 1-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic anhydride. The starting material's carboxylic acid group (`-COOH`) has been converted into a mixed anhydride group (`-C(=O)O-C(=O)CH3`).
