    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the given knot.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Knot**\n\n1.  **Count the crossings:** First, we examine the knot diagram to determine the number of crossings. By tracing the knot, we can count six distinct crossings. Let's label them for clarity:\n    *   Three crossings are aligned vertically in the center.\n    *   One crossing is at the bottom right.\n    *   Two more crossings are on the right side, connecting the central structure to outer loops.\n    Total crossings = 6.\n\n2.  **Determine if the knot is alternating:** An alternating knot has a diagram where the crossings alternate between 'over' and 'under' as you travel along the string. Let's trace a path along the knot to check this property.\n    *   Start on the outermost strand at the top right, moving clockwise.\n    *   At the first crossing encountered (top right), the strand goes **UNDER**.\n    *   Continuing along the outer edge to the next crossing (middle right), the strand again goes **UNDER**.\n    *   Since we have two consecutive 'under' crossings, this specific diagram is **not alternating**.\n\n3.  **Identify the knot from tables:** The knot has 6 crossings and is non-alternating. In the standard Alexander-Briggs notation, there are only two non-alternating knots with 6 crossings: the 6_1 knot and the 6_3 knot.\n    *   The **6_1 knot** is also known as the **Stevedore knot**.\n    *   The **6_3 knot** is another non-alternating knot.\n\n    By comparing the provided image to standard diagrams of knots, we can identify it. The given diagram is a well-known representation of the **6_1 knot (Stevedore knot)**. This diagram appears in many knot theory textbooks (e.g., \"The Knot Book\" by Colin Adams).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Rasmussen Invariant and its Properties**\n\n1.  **Definition:** The Rasmussen invariant, denoted `s(K)` for a knot `K`, is an integer-valued invariant derived from Khovanov homology. It provides powerful information about the topology of the knot, particularly its behavior in 4 dimensions.\n\n2.  **Key Property - The Slice-Bennequin Inequality:** A fundamental property of the Rasmussen invariant is its relationship to the **slice genus** (or **4-ball genus**), `g_4(K)`, of the knot. The slice genus is the minimum genus of a smooth surface in the 4-dimensional ball that has the knot as its boundary. The inequality, proven by Jacob Rasmussen, is:\n    `|s(K)| ≤ 2g_4(K)`\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Properties to the Identified Knot**\n\n1.  **Slice Property of the 6_1 Knot:** The Stevedore knot (6_1) is a well-known example of a **slice knot**. A knot is called slice if it bounds a smooth disk in the 4-ball. By definition, this means its slice genus is zero.\n    *   `g_4(6_1) = 0`\n\n2.  **Calculate the Rasmussen Invariant:** Now we can use the slice-Bennequin inequality with the slice genus of the 6_1 knot.\n    *   `|s(6_1)| ≤ 2 * g_4(6_1)`\n    *   `|s(6_1)| ≤ 2 * 0`\n    *   `|s(6_1)| ≤ 0`\n\n    The only integer whose absolute value is less than or equal to 0 is 0 itself. Therefore, the Rasmussen invariant of the 6_1 knot must be 0.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe knot in the picture is the 6_1 knot (Stevedore knot). This knot is slice, meaning its slice genus is 0. According to the slice-Bennequin inequality, `|s(6_1)| ≤ 0`, which implies that the Rasmussen invariant `s(6_1)` must be 0."
