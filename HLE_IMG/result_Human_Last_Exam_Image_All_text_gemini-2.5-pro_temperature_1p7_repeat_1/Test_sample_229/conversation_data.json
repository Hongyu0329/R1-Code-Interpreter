    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the song from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Musical Elements:**\n    *   **Time Signature and Tempo:** The time signature is 4/4. A tempo marking is visible at the top, \"M.M. J=126\", indicating a moderately fast tempo (126 beats per minute).\n    *   **Key and Melody:** The key signature has no sharps or flats, suggesting C major or A minor. The melody is highly syncopated, with many sixteenth notes and tied notes, creating a rhythmically active and vibrant feel. The first distinct melodic phrase is G-A-G-E, followed by C-D-E-C, and then B-C-B-G# over an E7 chord. This melodic contour is very recognizable.\n    *   **Harmony (Chords):** The chord symbols above the staff (e.g., C, E7, F, G7) outline the harmony. The progression from C to E7 (a secondary dominant) to F is characteristic of certain styles, including jazz and Latin American music.\n    *   **Instrumentation and Form:** This is a lead sheet, providing the melody and chord changes, typical for a melody instrument (like flute, violin, or accordion) with a rhythm section. It includes standard musical navigation marks like D.S. (Dal Segno, indicated by the § symbol) and a Coda.\n\n2.  **Identify the Song Title:**\n    *   The melodic line, particularly the opening phrase (G-A-G-E, etc.), is the signature theme of the song **\"Tico-Tico no Fubá\"**. The title translates from Portuguese to \"Sparrow in the Cornmeal\".\n\n3.  **Identify the Musical Style:**\n    *   \"Tico-Tico no Fubá\" is one of the most famous examples of the **Choro** genre. Choro is an instrumental Brazilian music style known for its fast tempo, syncopated rhythms, and virtuosic melodic lines. Its character is typically lively and energetic, which matches the tempo and rhythmic feel of the sheet music.\n\n4.  **Identify the Country of Origin:**\n    *   The song was composed by Zequinha de Abreu in 1917. Both the composer and the Choro style originate from **Brazil**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Distinguishing from other Latin styles:** While it has rhythmic complexity similar to Samba or Bossa Nova, the specific rhythmic patterns, faster tempo, and often instrumental focus are hallmarks of Choro. Bossa Nova is generally slower and more relaxed.\n*   **Handwritten Notation:** The sheet music is handwritten, which can make some symbols slightly ambiguous. For instance, what looks like F with a circle followed by a G7 chord is likely a representation of a passing diminished chord (F#dim7) commonly used in arrangements of this piece to lead to the G7.\n*   **Melody as the key:** The primary key to identification is the melody itself. It's one of the most well-known melodies in the Brazilian repertoire and has been featured internationally in many films and performances.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the distinct melody, rhythmic character, and chord progression, the sheet music is for the song \"Tico-Tico no Fubá,\" a Brazilian Choro.\n\n<<<**Title:** Tico-Tico no Fubá\n**Musical Style:** Choro\n**Country of Origin:** Brazil>>>"
