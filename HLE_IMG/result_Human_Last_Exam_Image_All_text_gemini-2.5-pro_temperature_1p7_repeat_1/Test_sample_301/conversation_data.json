    "Step-by-step analysis of each artwork to determine the author:\n\n1.  **Work 1 (Top-left):** This painting depicts four stylized goldfish with human-like faces and a fish hook. The style is characterized by simple, child-like brushstrokes and a sense of whimsy and humor, blending traditional Chinese ink wash with modern Expressionist elements. This unique style is the hallmark of **Ding Yanyong** (丁衍庸), a prominent artist known for his Fauvist-inspired ink paintings.\n\n2.  **Work 2 (Top-center):** This is a traditional Chinese ink wash painting of chrysanthemums beside a rock. The brushwork is powerful and angular, especially in the depiction of the leaves and the rock. The composition is bold and creates a sense of strength. This distinctive style, particularly the forceful brushwork and monumental compositions of natural subjects, is characteristic of **Pan Tianshou** (潘天壽), a master of modern Chinese painting.\n\n3.  **Work 3 (Top-right):** This is a realistic oil portrait of a woman from the Yi ethnic group. The painting demonstrates a mastery of classical realism, with meticulous attention to form, texture, and light, capturing the subject's dignity and inner life. This is one of the most famous works by **Jin Shangyi** (靳尚谊), a leading figure in Chinese Neoclassicism, and the painting is titled \"Yi Woman\" or \"A Yi Nationality Girl\".\n\n4.  **Work 4 (Middle-left):** This is a large-character cursive script calligraphy. The style is energetic, powerful, and dramatic, with significant variations in brush pressure and ink saturation. This dynamic and unrestrained style is the signature of the late-Ming dynasty calligrapher **Wang Duo** (王鐸).\n\n5.  **Work 5 (Center):** This work combines modern abstract elements with traditional Chinese landscape painting. It features two large circles, suggesting a sun and moon, hovering over a landscape rendered in expressive ink wash. This synthesis of Western abstraction and Eastern tradition is the defining characteristic of **Liu Kuo-sung** (刘国松, also spelled Liu Guosong), a key pioneer of the modern Chinese ink painting movement.\n\n6.  **Work 6 (Middle-right):** This is a piece of calligraphy written in a precise and elegant regular script (Kaishu). The characters are well-structured, slender, and scholarly, showing a unique personal style developed from studying traditional masters. This is the unmistakable \"Qi Style\" of **Qi Gong** (启功), one of the most celebrated Chinese calligraphers of the 20th century.\n\n7.  **Work 7 (Bottom-left):** This is another example of highly expressive cursive script calligraphy. The fluid, connected strokes and the bold, rhythmic flow are consistent with the work shown in the middle-left position. This is also a work by the late-Ming master **Wang Duo** (王鐸), renowned for his mastery of this dynamic script.\n\n8.  **Work 8 (Bottom-center):** This is a hyper-realistic oil portrait of a young woman with dark hair, surrounded by green leaves. The painting is known for its exquisite detail, serene atmosphere, and classical beauty. This is the famous painting \"Youth\" (\"青春\") by **Yang Feiyun** (杨飞云), a prominent artist of the Chinese Realist movement.\n\n9.  **Work 9 (Bottom-right):** This painting depicts a beautiful woman in an ornate, decorative costume. The style is characterized by strong, clear outlines filled with flat, vibrant areas of color, creating a highly decorative and modern effect while drawing on traditional themes. This style is representative of the \"Yunnan School,\" founded by **Ding Shaoguang** (丁绍光), whose work is known for celebrating the beauty of ethnic minorities in Southwest China.\n\nFinal Answer Ordering:\n*   Row 1: Ding Yanyong, Pan Tianshou, Jin Shangyi\n*   Row 2: Wang Duo, Liu Kuo-sung, Qi Gong\n*   Row 3: Wang Duo, Yang Feiyun, Ding Shaoguang\n\n<<<Ding Yanyong, Pan Tianshou, Jin Shangyi, Wang Duo, Liu Kuo-sung, Qi Gong, Wang Duo, Yang Feiyun, Ding Shaoguang>>>"
