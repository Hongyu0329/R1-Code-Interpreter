    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and the First Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is a bicyclic lactam. Let's determine its molecular formula.\n    *   The core structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one system. Let's count the atoms of the bicyclic core with its substituents:\n        *   Bicyclic skeleton: C1(CH), N2, C3(C=O), C4(CH), C5(C-CF3), C6(CH), C7(CH2).\n        *   Carbons in the core framework: 6 (C1, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7).\n        *   Hydrogens in the core framework: 1 (at C1) + 1 (at C4) + 1 (at C6) + 2 (at C7) = 5 H.\n        *   Trifluoromethyl group (-CF3): 1 C, 3 F.\n        *   para-Methoxybenzyl (PMB) group on the nitrogen: -CH2-C6H4-OCH3. This group contains C(1+6+1)H(2+4+3)O(1) = C8H9O.\n        *   Lactam group: 1 C=O, 1 N.\n    *   **Total Molecular Formula of Starting Material:**\n        *   Carbons (C): 6 (core) + 1 (from CF3) + 8 (from PMB) = 15 C.\n        *   Hydrogens (H): 5 (core) + 9 (from PMB) = 14 H.\n        *   Fluorines (F): 3 F.\n        *   Nitrogens (N): 1 N.\n        *   Oxygens (O): 1 (from C=O) + 1 (from PMB) = 2 O.\n        *   Formula: **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n*   **First Reaction:**\n    *   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n    *   **Transformation:** CAN is a strong oxidizing agent commonly used for the deprotection of PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) groups from amines and alcohols. The PMB group is oxidatively cleaved, and the nitrogen atom is protonated, resulting in an N-H group.\n    *   **Formation of Intermediate 1:** The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen.\n    *   **Change in molecular formula:** -(C8H9O) + H = -C8, -H8, -O.\n    *   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 1:** C(15-8)H(14-8)F3N(1)O(2-1) = **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Second Reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (C7H6F3NO), which is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 in MeOH.\n*   **Transformation:** These are standard conditions for catalytic hydrogenation. The carbon-carbon double bond (C5=C6) in the bicyclic ring will be reduced to a single bond by the addition of two hydrogen atoms. The lactam carbonyl and the trifluoromethyl group are stable under these conditions.\n*   **Formation of Intermediate 2:** H2 is added across the double bond.\n*   **Change in molecular formula:** +H2.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 2:** C7H(6+2)F3NO = **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Third Reaction and Final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (C7H8F3NO), which is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n*   **Transformation:** These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide (or in this case, a lactam). The amide bond (N2-C3) is cleaved. This reaction consumes one molecule of water (H2O). The ring opens to form an amino acid. The carbonyl carbon (C3) becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the nitrogen atom (N2) becomes an amino group (-NH2), which will be protonated to an ammonium group (-NH3+) in the acidic conditions.\n*   **Formation of the Product:** The bicyclic lactam ring opens. The product is a substituted cyclopentane containing a carboxylic acid and an amino group.\n*   **Change in molecular formula:** The hydrolysis reaction consumes one molecule of water. Net change is +H2O.\n*   **Molecular Formula of the Final Product:** C7H8F3NO + H2O = C7H(8+2)F3N(1)O(1+1) = **C7H10F3NO2**. The molecular formula is typically written for the neutral species, not the ion present in the acidic solution.\n\n**Summary of atom changes:**\n*   Starting Material: C15H14F3NO2\n*   Step 1 (CAN): - C8H8O --> C7H6F3NO\n*   Step 2 (Pd/C, H2): + H2 --> C7H8F3NO\n*   Step 3 (HCl, H2O, heat): + H2O --> C7H10F3NO2\n\nThe molecular formula of the final product is C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
