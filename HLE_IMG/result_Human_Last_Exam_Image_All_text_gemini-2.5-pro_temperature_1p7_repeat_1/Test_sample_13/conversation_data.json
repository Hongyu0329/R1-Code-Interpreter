    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Kakuro puzzle to find the numbers in the two top white squares.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the two numbers that will be in the two white squares located at the very top of the puzzle grid.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Clues for the Top Squares**\nThe puzzle uses a common style where numbers on the periphery have lines pointing to the \"run\" (a sequence of one or more white squares) they apply to.\n- We locate the two top white squares.\n- We find the clue that applies to them. There is a line extending from the number `17` that points directly and unambiguously to this pair of squares.\n- This means the sum of the numbers in these two squares must be 17.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Kakuro Rules to the Clue**\nKakuro puzzles have two fundamental rules for filling the white squares:\n1.  Use only the digits 1 through 9.\n2.  Digits within a single run (either horizontal or vertical) must be unique.\n\nWe need to find two different digits (from 1 to 9) that add up to 17.\n- Let's list the pairs:\n    - If we start with the largest possible digit, 9, the other number must be `17 - 9 = 8`. The pair is (9, 8). Both are valid digits, and they are unique.\n    - If we try the next largest digit, 8, the other number must be `17 - 8 = 9`. This gives the same pair.\n    - If we try 7, the other number would be `17 - 7 = 10`, which is not a single digit and thus not allowed.\n- Therefore, the only possible combination of two unique digits that sum to 17 is 8 and 9.\n\n**Step 4: Consider the Rest of the Puzzle (Careful Point)**\nTo be completely sure, one might try to solve the rest of the puzzle. However, upon inspecting other clues, we find inconsistencies and impossible sums. For example:\n- There is a clue `29` that points to a vertical run of three squares. The maximum possible sum for three unique digits from 1-9 is `9 + 8 + 7 = 24`. A sum of 29 is impossible.\n- There is another clue `28` pointing to a horizontal run of three squares. This is also impossible, as the maximum sum is 24.\n\nThese contradictions suggest that the puzzle itself may be flawed. However, the clue for the top two squares (`17`) is clear, arithmetically possible, and leads to a unique solution for those specific squares. The question only asks about these two squares.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nBased on the clear and solvable clue directly related to the question, we can confidently determine the numbers in the top two squares, even if the rest of the puzzle is flawed. The two numbers must be 8 and 9. The question asks for the two numbers, not their specific order.\n\nThe two numbers present in the two top white squares are 8 and 9.\n\n<<<8,9>>>"
