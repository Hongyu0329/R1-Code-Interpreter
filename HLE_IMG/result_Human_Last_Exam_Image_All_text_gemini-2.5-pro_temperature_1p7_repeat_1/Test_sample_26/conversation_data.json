    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Location and Key**\n*   **Locate Measure 30:** We first need to find measure 30 in the provided sheet music. The measures are numbered at the beginning of each system. The system containing the circled passage starts with measure 28. Therefore, measure 30 is the third measure in that line.\n*   **Determine the Key Signature:** The key signature shown at the beginning of the staves has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). This indicates the key of C minor or its relative major, E♭ major. Given the sonata's title and overall character, the home key of this movement is C minor.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Notes in Measure 30**\n*   **Bass Clef (Left Hand):** The left hand plays a sixteenth-note tremolo on a G octave (G2 and G3) throughout the entire measure. This sustained G in the bass is a clear indicator of a pedal point. Since G is the fifth scale degree of C minor, this is a **dominant pedal**.\n*   **Treble Clef (Right Hand):** The right hand plays rapid, ornamental 32nd-note figures. The notes played are: G, F♯, A, E, and D♯.\n    *   The F♯ acts as a chromatic lower neighbor to G.\n    *   The D♯ acts as a chromatic lower neighbor to E.\n    *   The main melodic notes are G, A, and E, which create melodic interest and tension over the static bass.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Harmonic Function**\n*   **Dominant Pedal:** The most crucial element for the harmonic analysis of this measure is the sustained G in the bass. A pedal point on the dominant note (the 5th degree of the scale) establishes the harmony of the entire measure as **dominant**.\n*   **Context:** In the measures leading up to measure 30 (specifically mm. 28-29), Beethoven builds tension over the same G dominant pedal. Measure 31 resolves this tension by moving to a clear C minor chord (the tonic, or **i**).\n*   **Function over Figuration:** Although the specific notes in the right hand (G, A, F♯, E, D♯) do not spell a simple G major or G dominant 7th chord, the function of the entire measure is determined by the bass. The right hand provides complex melodic figuration over a clear dominant foundation. In harmonic analysis, the underlying function is what is most important.\n\n**Step 4: Select the Correct Roman Numeral**\n*   **The Dominant Chord:** The Roman numeral for the chord built on the dominant (5th) scale degree is **V**.\n*   **Quality in a Minor Key:** In a minor key, the leading tone (the 7th scale degree) is almost always raised to create a stronger pull to the tonic. In C minor, the natural 7th is B♭, but the raised leading tone is B♮. This changes the quality of the dominant triad from minor (G-B♭-D) to major (G-B♮-D).\n*   **Notation:** A major chord is represented by an uppercase Roman numeral. Therefore, the dominant chord in C minor is written as **V**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nMeasure 30 functions as a prolongation of the dominant harmony, built on a G pedal point. It resolves to the tonic (i) in the following measure. Therefore, the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 is V.\n\n<<<V>>>"
