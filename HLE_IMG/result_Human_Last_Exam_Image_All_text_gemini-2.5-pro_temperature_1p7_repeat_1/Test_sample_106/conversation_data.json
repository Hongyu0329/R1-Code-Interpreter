    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** The reaction shows an alcohol treated with a strong acid catalyst (HCl) and heat (110 °C). This results in the loss of a water molecule and the formation of an alkene. This is a dehydration reaction, which under these conditions, often involves carbocation intermediates and subsequent rearrangements. The starting material is a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol, and the product is a rearranged isomeric alkene. This specific transformation is a classic example of a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, specifically the friedelane-oleanane backbone rearrangement.\n\n2.  **Propose a Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   **Step 1: Formation of Carbocation:** The hydroxyl (-OH) group on the starting material (at position C3) is protonated by the acid catalyst to form a good leaving group (-OH₂⁺). This group departs, leaving a secondary carbocation at C3.\n    *   **Step 2: Carbocation Rearrangement Cascade:** The initial secondary carbocation is unstable and undergoes a series of [1,2]-shifts (migrations of an adjacent group, either hydride (H⁻) or methyl (CH₃⁻)) to form progressively more stable carbocations. The final alkene formed, olean-12-ene, is thermodynamically very stable, which is the driving force for the entire cascade.\n\n3.  **Trace the Shifting Groups:** To determine the substituents at the indicated positions, we must carefully track each mobile group (H or CH₃) during the rearrangement. We will use standard triterpenoid numbering for clarity.\n\n    *   **Start:** We identify the key substituents on the backbone of the starting material (a friedelane derivative):\n        *   C3: -OH and H\n        *   C4: two -CH₃ groups\n        *   C5: one -H\n        *   C8: one -CH₃\n        *   C9: one -H\n        *   C10: one -CH₃\n        *   C13: one -H\n        *   C14: one -CH₃\n\n    *   **The Cascade of [1,2]-Shifts:**\n        1.  The C3 carbocation forms.\n        2.  A methyl group migrates from C4 to C3. The positive charge is now at C4 (a more stable tertiary carbocation).\n        3.  A hydride (H) migrates from C5 to C4. The positive charge moves to C5.\n        4.  A methyl group migrates from C10 to C5. The positive charge moves to C10.\n        5.  A hydride (H) migrates from C9 to C10. The positive charge moves to C9.\n        6.  A methyl group migrates from C8 to C9. The positive charge moves to C8.\n        7.  A methyl group migrates from C14 to C8. The positive charge moves to C14.\n        8.  A hydride (H) migrates from C13 to C14. The positive charge moves to C13.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Elimination:** The final carbocation is at C13. A base (like H₂O) removes a proton from the adjacent C12. This forms the stable tetrasubstituted double bond between C12 and C13, yielding the olean-12-ene skeleton shown in the product.\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Substituents at Positions 1-5:** Now we determine what substituent is at each numbered carbon in the final product.\n\n    *   **Position 1 (on C4):** C4 started with two methyl groups. One migrated to C3. A hydrogen migrated in from C5. Therefore, the final substituents on C4 are one methyl group and one hydrogen. The product drawing shows an explicit methyl group and the label '1'. So, **1 = H**.\n    *   **Position 2 (on C10):** C10 started with a methyl group. This methyl migrated to C5. A hydrogen migrated in from C9. Therefore, the final substituent on C10 is a hydrogen. So, **2 = H**.\n    *   **Position 3 (on C8):** C8 started with a methyl group. This methyl migrated to C9. A new methyl group migrated in from C14. Therefore, the final substituent on C8 is a methyl group. So, **3 = CH3**.\n    *   **Position 4 (on C14):** C14 started with a methyl group. This methyl migrated to C8. A hydrogen migrated in from C13. Therefore, the final substituent on C14 is a hydrogen. So, **4 = H**.\n    *   **Position 5 (on C9):** C9 started with a hydrogen. This hydrogen migrated to C10. A methyl group migrated in from C8. Therefore, the final substituent on C9 is a methyl group. So, **5 = CH3**.\n\n**Careful Point:** The drawing of the product appears to show a gem-dimethyl group at the position labeled '1' (C4), which would imply that 1 = CH₃. This contradicts the established mechanism for the Friedelane-Oleanane rearrangement, which requires a methyl shift from C4. In such cases of conflict, the well-established chemical mechanism is more reliable than a potentially simplified or inaccurate drawing. The analysis is therefore based on the chemical mechanism.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   Position 1 is a Hydrogen (H).\n*   Position 2 is a Hydrogen (H).\n*   Position 3 is a Methyl group (CH₃).\n*   Position 4 is a Hydrogen (H).\n*   Position 5 is a Methyl group (CH₃).\n\n<<<1 = H, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = H, 5 = CH3>>>"
