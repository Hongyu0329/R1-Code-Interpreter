    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   The mass spectrum shows the molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 135.\n*   According to the Nitrogen Rule, an odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We will assume one nitrogen atom (N).\n*   Let's determine a possible molecular formula.\n    *   Mass of N = 14 u.\n    *   Remaining mass = 135 - 14 = 121 u.\n    *   Assuming the rest is C and H, we can divide by the mass of carbon (12 u): 121 / 12 ≈ 10. Let's try C = 9.\n    *   Mass of 9 carbons = 9 × 12 = 108 u.\n    *   Remaining mass for H = 121 - 108 = 13 u.\n    *   This gives a plausible molecular formula of **C₉H₁₃N**.\n    *   The molecular weight for C₉H₁₃N is (9 × 12.01) + (13 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) = 108.09 + 13.13 + 14.01 = 135.23 u, which matches the M⁺ peak.\n*   Another key peak is visible at m/z = 91. This is a very common fragment corresponding to the tropylium ion [C₇H₇]⁺, which strongly suggests the presence of a benzyl group (C₆H₅-CH₂-).\n\n**2. Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) Calculation:**\n*   Using the formula DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 for C₉H₁₃N:\n*   DBE = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4.\n*   A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring (3 double bonds + 1 ring).\n\n**3. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   Peaks slightly above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate sp² C-H stretching (aromatic).\n*   Peaks below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate sp³ C-H stretching (aliphatic).\n*   Strong peaks in the 1450-1600 cm⁻¹ range indicate C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   There are some broad, weak signals in the 3300-3500 cm⁻¹ region, which could suggest an N-H bond, possibly from a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   These observations support the presence of a substituted benzene ring with an aliphatic side chain containing a nitrogen atom.\n\n**4. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis:**\n*   **¹³C NMR signals:** δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. (7 signals total). Since the formula has 9 carbons, there must be symmetry causing some carbons to be equivalent.\n*   **Aromatic region (δ > 100 ppm):**\n    *   δ 145.1: Quaternary carbon (Cq), likely the ipso-carbon of the benzene ring (the carbon attached to the substituent).\n    *   δ 128.5, 127.3, 126.3: Aromatic CH carbons. The presence of 3 signals for the 5 CH carbons of a monosubstituted ring is common due to accidental equivalence.\n*   **Aliphatic region (δ < 100 ppm):**\n    *   δ 49.6, 43.5, 19.2: These three signals correspond to the three carbons of the side chain.\n*   **DEPT-135 Analysis:** \"one negative and five positive signals\".\n    *   A negative signal indicates a CH₂ (methylene) group.\n    *   Positive signals indicate CH (methine) or CH₃ (methyl) groups.\n    *   We have 1 CH₂ group and 5 CH/CH₃ groups.\n    *   The 5 positive signals must come from the 3 aromatic CH carbons and the 2 remaining aliphatic carbons.\n    *   Therefore, the side chain consists of: **one CH₂, one CH, and one CH₃**.\n\n**5. ¹H NMR Analysis:**\n*   **δ ~7.2-7.4 ppm (multiplet, integration ≈ 5H):** This is a classic pattern for a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-). This accounts for 6 carbons and 5 hydrogens.\n*   The remaining part of the molecule is C₉H₁₃N - C₆H₅ = **C₃H₈N**. The side chain must contain 3 carbons and 8 hydrogens (including those on N).\n*   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, integration ≈ 3H):** This signal corresponds to a CH₃ group that is coupled to a single adjacent proton (a CH group). This indicates a **-CH-CH₃** fragment.\n*   **δ ~2.7-3.0 ppm (complex multiplet region, total integration ≈ 3H):** This region contains the signals for the remaining protons of the side chain. The provided integrations (1.96 ≈ 2H and 0.97 ≈ 1H) suggest the presence of a **CH₂ group (2H)** and a **CH group (1H)**.\n*   **Proton count so far:** 5H (aromatic) + 3H (CH₃) + 2H (CH₂) + 1H (CH) = 11H.\n*   The formula requires 13 hydrogens. The remaining 2 hydrogens belong to the nitrogen atom, indicating a primary amine group (**-NH₂**). This is consistent with the IR data.\n\n**6. HSQC Analysis:**\n*   This 2D spectrum correlates protons with the carbons they are directly attached to.\n*   **H(1.2 ppm) ↔ C(19.2 ppm):** The 3H doublet proton signal connects to the carbon at 19.2 ppm. This confirms this is a **CH₃** group.\n*   **H(~2.8 ppm) ↔ C(43.5 ppm):** The 2H multiplet protons connect to the carbon at 43.5 ppm. This must be the **CH₂** group.\n*   **H(~2.9-3.0 ppm) ↔ C(49.6 ppm):** The 1H multiplet proton connects to the carbon at 49.6 ppm. This must be the **CH** group.\n\n**7. Structure Assembly:**\n*   We have the following fragments: a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), a primary amine group (-NH₂), and a C₃H₆ side chain consisting of -CH₂, -CH-, and -CH₃.\n*   The ¹H NMR showed a -CH-CH₃ fragment from the 3H doublet.\n*   The only way to assemble the side chain is: -CH₂-CH-CH₃.\n*   Now we must attach the phenyl group and the amine group to this propyl backbone.\n*   **Structure Possibility 1: 1-phenylpropan-2-amine**\n    *   Structure: C₆H₅-CH₂(1)-CH(2)(NH₂)-CH₃(3)\n    *   This structure has a C₆H₅-CH₂- group, consistent with the m/z=91 fragment in the MS.\n    *   The -CH₃ group is attached to a -CH group, which would result in a 3H doublet in the ¹H NMR. This matches our spectrum.\n    *   The chemical shifts also fit: The CH₂ group (benzylic) is at δ 43.5. The CH group (attached to N) is at δ 49.6. The CH₃ group is at δ 19.2. This is a very good match with expected values.\n*   **Structure Possibility 2: 1-phenylpropan-1-amine**\n    *   Structure: C₆H₅-CH(1)(NH₂)-CH₂(2)-CH₃(3)\n    *   In this structure, the -CH₃ group is adjacent to a -CH₂ group. It would appear as a triplet in the ¹H NMR, not a doublet. This contradicts the data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll spectral data consistently point to the structure of 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n\n**8. IUPAC Naming:**\n*   The parent chain containing the principal functional group (amine) is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n*   The amine group (-NH₂) is located at position 2. This gives **propan-2-amine**.\n*   There is a phenyl substituent (C₆H₅-) at position 1. This gives **1-phenyl**.\n*   Combining these parts, the full IUPAC name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
