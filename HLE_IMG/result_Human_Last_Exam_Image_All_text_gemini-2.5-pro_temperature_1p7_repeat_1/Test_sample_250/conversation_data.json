    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the title and composer of the provided jazz standard.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Musical Analysis**\n*   **Key Signature:** The key signature has four flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db). This points to the key of Ab Major or its relative minor, F Minor.\n*   **Time Signature:** The piece is in cut time (2/2), as indicated by the 'C' with a vertical line through it. This is a common time signature for up-tempo jazz.\n*   **Instrumentation:** The music is written on a treble clef, representing the lead sheet melody and chord changes, typical for a \"fake book\" or a chart for a jazz combo.\n\n**Step 2: Melodic Analysis**\n*   The melody begins on the note C, which is the 5th degree of the F minor scale.\n*   The first measure contains a half note C.\n*   The second measure has the notes B natural and A.\n*   The third measure has the notes G and F.\n*   The fourth measure has Eb and B natural.\n*   The melodic contour, especially in the first few bars, follows a descending pattern (C... B, A, G, F, Eb...). This distinctive melodic shape is a major clue.\n\n**Step 3: Harmonic (Chord) Analysis**\n*   **\"A\" Section:** The chord progression in the first section is highly characteristic and is the primary identifier for this song.\n    *   Measure 1: `F-` (F minor, the i chord in F minor).\n    *   Measure 2: `E-7b5` (E half-diminished).\n    *   Measure 3: `Eb-6` (E-flat minor sixth). This chord is particularly unusual and distinctive.\n    *   Measure 4: `Dbmaj7` followed by `G7`.\n    *   Measure 5: `C7` (The V chord in F minor).\n*   **\"B\" Section (Bridge):** The bridge begins at measure 9.\n    *   Measure 9-10: `D-7b5` to `G7`. This is a ii-V progression leading to C.\n    *   Measure 11-12: `C7` to `F7`. A chain of dominant chords.\n    *   Measure 13-14: `Bb-7` to `Eb7`. This is a ii-V progression leading to Ab.\n    *   Measure 15-16: `Ab` followed by a `G C7` turnaround.\n    *   This bridge, with its chain of ii-V's and dominant chords moving through different key centers, is a classic jazz structure.\n\n**Step 4: Identification**\n*   By combining the analysis of the unique melody and the highly specific chord progression of both the \"A\" section and the bridge, we can identify the tune.\n*   The opening progression `F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7...` is the unmistakable signature of the jazz standard \"Stablemates\".\n*   The composer of \"Stablemates\" is the celebrated jazz tenor saxophonist and composer Benny Golson. The piece was first recorded on Miles Davis's 1955 album *Miles: The New Miles Davis Quintet*.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Handwritten charts often have slight variations from published versions. For example, the bridge of \"Stablemates\" is sometimes written with a `C-7` chord in measure 11, but the `C7` shown here is a common and logical reharmonization that turns it into the dominant of `F7`.\n*   Recognizing a jazz standard often relies more heavily on the chord progression than the exact melody, as players frequently embellish or alter the written melody. In this case, both the melody and chords are strong identifiers.\n\n<<<Title: Stablemates, Composer: Benny Golson>>>"
