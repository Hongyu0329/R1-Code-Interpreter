    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the sex of each insect.\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Bees and Wasps (Hymenoptera):**\n\n*   **Antennae:** Males typically have longer antennae with more segments (13 segments) compared to females (12 segments). In some species, like the paper wasps in pair B, male antennae are curled at the tip.\n*   **Abdomen:** The female abdomen ends in a stinger (a modified ovipositor), which is used for defense or laying eggs. This often makes the abdomen appear more pointed. Males lack a stinger, and their abdomen may appear blunter or have different terminal structures. Females typically have 6 visible abdominal segments, while males have 7.\n*   **Pollen-Collecting Structures (Scopae):** The prompt states these insects lack scopae *on their legs*. This is a critical clue. In bees that collect pollen, scopae are exclusively found on females. While many bees carry pollen on their legs (e.g., honeybees, bumblebees), some families, like Megachilidae, carry pollen in a scopa on the underside (ventral side) of their abdomen. Wasps and cuckoo bees do not collect pollen for their young and lack scopae altogether.\n*   **Facial Markings:** In many bee and wasp species, males have more extensive yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus) than females.\n\n**Analysis of Each Pair:**\n\n**Pair A: Cuckoo Bees (likely genus *Coelioxys*)**\nThese are kleptoparasitic bees, meaning the females lay their eggs in the nests of other bees. They do not collect pollen and thus lack scopae.\n*   **Individual A (Left):** This bee has a very long, tapering, and sharply pointed abdomen. This is the characteristic modified ovipositor of a female *Coelioxys*, which she uses to pierce the cell wall of her host's nest. This is a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Individual A (Right):** This bee's abdomen is shorter and blunter at the tip. Male *Coelioxys* have multiple small spines or prongs at the tip of their abdomen, which contrasts with the single sharp point of the female. This is a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The pair is Female, Male (F, M). This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n**Pair B: Paper Wasps (likely genus *Polistes*)**\nWasps are pollinators that feed on nectar, and they do not have scopae.\n*   **Individual B (Left):** The most noticeable feature is the antennae, which are distinctly curled at the tips. This is a reliable characteristic of male paper wasps. This is a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Individual B (Right):** The antennae are straight, not curled. The abdomen tip is pointed, consistent with a female's stinger. This is a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The pair is Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Pair C: Leafcutter/Mason Bees (Family Megachilidae)**\nThis family fits the description of \"without scopae on their legs\" because females carry pollen on the underside of their abdomen in a \"ventral scopa\".\n*   **Individual C (Left):** This bee has a relatively hairy face with light coloration. Critically, looking at the underside of its abdomen, there is no dense brush of pollen-collecting hairs (ventral scopa). The absence of a scopa indicates this is a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Individual C (Right):** This bee has a very prominent, bright yellow brush of hairs on the underside of its abdomen, which is laden with pollen. This structure is the ventral scopa, and its presence is a definitive trait of a female in this family. This is a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** The pair is Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Final Answer Compilation:**\n*   Pair A: F, M -> Index **4**\n*   Pair B: M, F -> Index **3**\n*   Pair C: M, F -> Index **3**\n\nCombining these indices gives the final answer.\n\n<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
