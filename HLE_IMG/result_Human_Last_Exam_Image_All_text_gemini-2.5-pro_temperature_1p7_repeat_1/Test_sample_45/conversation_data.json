    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand Rotational Symmetry:** Rotational symmetry is a property a shape or pattern has when it looks the same after being rotated by some angle less than 360 degrees. The order of rotational symmetry is the number of times the pattern matches its original orientation in a full 360-degree turn. This is calculated as 360 divided by the smallest angle of rotation that leaves the pattern unchanged.\n\n2.  **Identify the Components of the Tiling:** The pattern is a tiling composed of three distinct shapes:\n    *   Dark blue regular heptagons (7-sided polygons).\n    *   Light yellow squares (4-sided polygons).\n    *   Orange rhombuses (a type of 4-sided polygon).\n\n3.  **Search for a Center of Rotation:** To find the rotational symmetry, we need to find a point in the pattern around which we can rotate it and have it appear unchanged. Good candidates for centers of rotation are typically the centers of the geometric tiles or the vertices where multiple tiles meet.\n\n4.  **Analyze a Central Motif:** Let's focus on one of the prominent star-like patterns, or \"rosettes,\" which appear throughout the tiling.\n    *   At the heart of each rosette is a dark blue heptagon.\n    *   This heptagon is surrounded by 7 light yellow squares, with one square attached to each of its 7 sides.\n    *   In the gaps between these yellow squares, there are 7 orange rhombuses, each pointing its sharp corner towards the central heptagon.\n    *   This entire rosette structure is made of 7 identical \"arms\" (each composed of a square and a rhombus).\n\n5.  **Determine the Symmetry of the Rosette:** Because the rosette has 7 identical, symmetrically arranged arms, rotating it around its center by an angle of 360° / 7 will result in the rosette looking exactly the same. Each arm will move to the position previously occupied by the next arm.\n\n6.  **Extend the Symmetry to the Entire Tiling:** Now, we need to see if this 7-fold symmetry applies to the entire tiling, not just one rosette.\n    *   Observe that the entire plane is filled by these rosettes packed together.\n    *   If we pick the center of any blue heptagon as our center of rotation and rotate the entire image by 360° / 7, we can see that not only does the central rosette map onto itself, but every surrounding rosette also moves to the position of an identical rosette.\n    *   The overall pattern remains unchanged.\n\n7.  **Consider Other Possible Symmetries:**\n    *   **4-fold symmetry:** Let's consider the center of a yellow square. A square tile has 4-fold rotational symmetry by itself. However, in the tiling, a square is bordered by one heptagon and three other shapes (rhombuses). If you rotate by 90 degrees (360/4), the side with the heptagon would move to a position that was previously adjacent to a rhombus. Since a heptagon is not a rhombus, the pattern does not match. Therefore, the tiling does not have 4-fold rotational symmetry around the center of the squares.\n    *   **2-fold symmetry:** The center of an orange rhombus is a point of 2-fold symmetry. A 180-degree rotation maps the rhombus to itself, and its neighboring tiles (two heptagons and two squares) are swapped with their identical counterparts on the opposite side. So, the tiling does possess 2-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n8.  **Conclusion:** The tiling has points of 2-fold rotational symmetry and points of 7-fold rotational symmetry. When asked for \"the\" rotational symmetry of a pattern, we typically refer to the highest order of symmetry present. In this case, the highest order is 7.\n\n**Final Answer:** The tiling exhibits 7-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n<<<7-fold>>>"
