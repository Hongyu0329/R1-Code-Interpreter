    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the circuit to determine the total current flowing from the source.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the total current flowing out of the voltage source V2. To find this, we need to calculate the total equivalent resistance (Req) of the circuit as seen by the voltage source. Then, we can use Ohm's Law (I = V / R) to find the total current (I_total).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Circuit Topology**\nThe circuit consists of a voltage source V2 = 1 V and two main branches of resistors connected in parallel across the source. The top wire is connected to the positive terminal of V2 (1V), and the bottom wire is connected to the negative terminal and ground (0V).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Left Branch**\n*   This branch consists of resistors R1 (3 Ω), R2 (7 Ω), and R3 (9 Ω). They appear to be in series.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** Notice the additional wires. There is a wire that connects the top rail (the positive terminal of the source) to the node between R1 and R2. A wire is assumed to have zero resistance. When a resistor is placed in parallel with a short circuit (a zero-resistance wire), all current bypasses the resistor. Therefore, this wire short-circuits R1.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** There is another wire connecting the top rail to the node between R2 and R3. This wire is in parallel with the series combination of R1 and R2. Since this wire also represents a short circuit, it effectively bypasses both R1 and R2.\n*   **Conclusion for the Left Branch:** Because R1 and R2 are short-circuited, the only effective resistor in this branch is R3. The current from the source can flow through the bypass wire directly to the top of R3, then through R3 (9 Ω) to ground. So, the equivalent resistance of this entire branch is simply R3 = 9 Ω.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Right Branch**\n*   This branch consists of resistors R8 (100 Ω) and R7 (100 Ω) in series.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** Similar to the left branch, there is a wire connecting the top rail to the node between R8 and R7. This wire is in parallel with resistor R8.\n*   **Conclusion for the Right Branch:** This wire short-circuits R8. The current flows from the top rail, through the wire, bypassing R8, then flows through R7 (100 Ω) to ground. The equivalent resistance of this branch is therefore just R7 = 100 Ω.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Equivalent Resistance (Req)**\nThe circuit has been simplified to two resistors in parallel: R3 (9 Ω) and R7 (100 Ω).\nThe formula for two parallel resistors is:\nReq = (R3 * R7) / (R3 + R7)\nReq = (9 * 100) / (9 + 100)\nReq = 900 / 109 Ω\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Total Current (I_total)**\nUsing Ohm's Law, I = V / R:\nI_total = V2 / Req\nI_total = 1 V / (900 / 109 Ω)\nI_total = 109 / 900 A\n\n**Step 7: Final Calculation**\nI_total = 109 / 900 A ≈ 0.12111... A.\nRounding to three significant figures, the total current is 0.121 A.\n\nLet's provide the exact fractional answer converted to a decimal.\n109 ÷ 900 = 0.12111...\n\nLet's express the answer in Amperes.\n\n<<<0.121>>>"
