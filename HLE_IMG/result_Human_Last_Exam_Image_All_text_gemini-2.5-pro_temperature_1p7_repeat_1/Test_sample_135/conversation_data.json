    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the author of the altarpiece detail.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the artwork.**\n*   **Format and Medium:** The image shows a bas-relief (low-relief sculpture) set within a tondo (a circular frame). The surface appears smooth and slightly glossy, characteristic of glazed terracotta, a medium popularized during the Italian Renaissance. The tondo itself is set within a larger, rectangular, decorative frame with floral and foliate motifs.\n*   **Subject Matter:** The central scene depicts a religious sacrament. A priest, standing at an altar on the left, is administering Holy Communion (the Eucharist) to a group of five kneeling figures, which includes men, women, and a child. The scene is one of pious devotion.\n*   **Style:** The figures are rendered with naturalism, grace, and idealized beauty, which are hallmarks of the Florentine Renaissance style of the 15th century. The composition is balanced and harmonious.\n*   **Inscription:** At the bottom of the tondo, there is a cartouche (a decorative scroll) with the inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This is a mix of Latin and Old French/Italian, meaning \"Sacrament of the Altar\", which explicitly identifies the scene as the Eucharist.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the visual elements to a specific artist or school.**\n*   The combination of glazed terracotta, the tondo format, religious subject matter, and the specific High Renaissance style is strongly associated with the Della Robbia family workshop in Florence. This workshop was founded by Luca della Robbia and continued by his nephew, Andrea della Robbia, and Andrea's sons.\n*   The particular grace, sweetness, and slightly more complex compositions are especially characteristic of Andrea della Robbia (1435â€“1525), who inherited the workshop from his uncle Luca.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific artwork and confirm the author.**\n*   A search for \"Della Robbia tondo Sacrament of the Altar\" or similar terms leads to a specific, well-known artwork.\n*   This tondo is the central panel of the *Altarpiece of the Sacrament* (or Tabernacle of the Eucharist).\n*   This altarpiece is located in the Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta and San Genesio in San Miniato, a town in Tuscany, Italy.\n*   Art historical sources consistently attribute this work to Andrea della Robbia and his workshop. It is generally dated to around 1480.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the style, medium (glazed terracotta), subject matter (Sacrament of the Altar, confirmed by the inscription), and comparing it to known works from the Italian Renaissance, the artwork can be confidently identified as the *Altarpiece of the Sacrament* from the Cathedral of San Miniato. The author of this work is the renowned Florentine sculptor Andrea della Robbia.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
