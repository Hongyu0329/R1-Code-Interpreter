    "*   **Step 1: Initial Observation.** The image shows an insect perched on a yellow flower head. The question requires identifying the scientific name of this insect.\n\n*   **Step 2: Detailed Insect Analysis.**\n    *   **Order:** The insect has the characteristic appearance of a \"true bug\" from the order Hemiptera. This is suggested by its body shape, the way its wings appear to fold, its long antennae, and its prominent eyes. True bugs possess piercing-sucking mouthparts, though they are not visible in this image.\n    *   **Coloration and Markings:** The insect has a very distinct color pattern. It is primarily black or dark greyish-brown. There are bright reddish-orange markings. The most notable markings are a distinct red-orange line running down the midline of its black head and a red-orange border along the posterior edge of its pronotum (the area just behind the head, often called the \"shoulders\").\n    *   **Size and Shape:** It has a relatively stout, oval-shaped body.\n\n*   **Step 3: Plant Identification.** The insect is on a dense cluster of small, bright yellow flowers. This floral structure is characteristic of Goldenrod (*Solidago* species), a common wildflower in North America that blooms in late summer and fall and attracts a wide variety of insects.\n\n*   **Step 4: Species Identification.** Based on the combination of features—the specific red-orange markings on the head and \"shoulders,\" the true bug body plan, and its presence on a plant consistent with goldenrod—the insect can be identified. This pattern is characteristic of the Red-shouldered Bug. Searching for the scientific name for this common name leads to the species *Jadera haematoloma*. This species is part of the Rhopalidae family, known as scentless plant bugs.\n\n*   **Step 5: Confirmation.** Comparing the insect in the photo to verified images of *Jadera haematoloma* confirms the identification. The key features, especially the red line on the head and the red-edged pronotum, are a perfect match. Although sometimes called the Goldenrain Tree Bug, it is known to feed on seeds from various plants, including those found in the composite family like goldenrod.\n\n*   **Step 6: Final Answer Formulation.** The step-by-step analysis confidently identifies the insect as the Red-shouldered Bug, whose scientific name is *Jadera haematoloma*.\n\n<<<Jadera haematoloma>>>"
