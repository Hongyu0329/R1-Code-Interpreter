    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the substituents at the indicated positions.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction**\n\nThe reaction is the acid-catalyzed dehydration of a pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol. The conditions (catalytic HCl, 110 °C) are harsh and promote not only the elimination of water but also extensive carbocation rearrangements. The question explicitly mentions that the process involves a series of [1,2] shifts. This type of rearrangement cascade in triterpenoids is known as a \"backbone rearrangement\".\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Initial Carbocation**\nThe reaction begins with the protonation of the hydroxyl (-OH) group on C3 by the acid catalyst (HCl). This forms a good leaving group, water (-OH2+). The departure of the water molecule generates a secondary carbocation at the C3 position.\n\n**Step 2: The Cascade of [1,2] Shifts (Wagner-Meerwein Rearrangement)**\nThe initial secondary carbocation is relatively unstable and will rearrange through a series of hydride ([1,2]-H) and methyl ([1,2]-CH3) shifts to form more stable tertiary carbocations. The goal is to move the positive charge across the molecular backbone to a position from which a stable alkene can be formed.\n\nLet's trace the movement of the positive charge and the migrating groups. We'll refer to the carbon numbering of the standard triterpenoid skeleton for clarity.\n\n1.  **C3(+) → C4(+)**: The secondary carbocation at C3 is adjacent to the quaternary C4, which bears two methyl groups. A [1,2]-methyl shift from C4 to C3 occurs. This moves one of C4's methyl groups to C3 and forms a more stable tertiary carbocation at C4.\n2.  **C4(+) → C5(+)**: The tertiary carbocation at C4 is adjacent to C5, which bears a hydrogen atom. A [1,2]-hydride shift from C5 to C4 occurs. This moves the hydrogen from C5 to C4, and the positive charge shifts to C5.\n3.  **C5(+) → C10(+)**: The carbocation at C5 is adjacent to the quaternary C10, which bears a methyl group. A [1,2]-methyl shift from C10 to C5 moves the C10-methyl group to C5 and the positive charge to C10.\n4.  **C10(+) → C9(+)**: The carbocation at C10 is adjacent to C9, which bears a hydrogen atom. A [1,2]-hydride shift from C9 to C10 moves the hydrogen to C10 and the positive charge to C9.\n5.  **C9(+) → C8(+)**: The carbocation at C9 is adjacent to the quaternary C8, which bears a methyl group. A [1,2]-methyl shift from C8 to C9 moves the C8-methyl group to C9 and the positive charge to C8.\n6.  **C8(+) → C14(+)**: The carbocation at C8 is adjacent to C14, which bears a hydrogen atom. A [1,2]-hydride shift from C14 to C8 moves the hydrogen to C14 and the positive charge to C14.\n7.  **C14(+) → C13(+)**: The carbocation at C14 is adjacent to C13, which bears a methyl group. A [1,2]-methyl shift from C13 to C14 moves the C13-methyl group to C14 and the positive charge to C13.\n\n**Step 3: Elimination**\nThe rearrangement cascade terminates with the formation of a tertiary carbocation at C13. This cation is now perfectly positioned for elimination. A proton is removed from the adjacent C18, leading to the formation of a thermodynamically stable tetrasubstituted double bond between C13 and C18. This gives the final product shown.\n\n**Determining the Substituents at Positions 1-5**\n\nNow we can determine the identity of the substituent (H or CH3) at each numbered position in the final product by tracking the consequences of the rearrangement cascade.\n\n*   **Position 1 (at C4):** C4 started with two methyl groups. One migrated to C3. A hydrogen migrated in from C5. Thus, C4 is left with one methyl group and one hydrogen. The label \"1\" points to the remaining methyl group.\n    *   **1 = CH3**\n*   **Position 2 (at C10):** C10 started with a methyl group, which migrated to C5. A hydrogen migrated in from C9. Thus, the substituent at C10 is now a hydrogen.\n    *   **2 = H**\n*   **Position 3 (at C5):** C5 started with a hydrogen, which migrated to C4. A methyl group migrated in from C10. Thus, the substituent at C5 is now a methyl group.\n    *   **3 = CH3**\n*   **Position 4 (at C9):** C9 started with a hydrogen, which migrated to C10. A methyl group migrated in from C8. Thus, the substituent at C9 is now a methyl group.\n    *   **4 = CH3**\n*   **Position 5 (at C8):** C8 started with a methyl group, which migrated to C9. A hydrogen migrated in from C14. Thus, the substituent at C8 is now a hydrogen.\n    *   **5 = H**\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the backbone rearrangement mechanism, the substituents are:\n\n1 = CH3\n2 = H\n3 = CH3\n4 = CH3\n5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
