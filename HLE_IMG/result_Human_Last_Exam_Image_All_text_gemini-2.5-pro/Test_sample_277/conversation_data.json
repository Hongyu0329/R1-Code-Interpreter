    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the provided image.**\n    The image provided in the prompt is completely black. There are no chemical structures, diagrams, or any molecules depicted in the image.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the question.**\n    The question asks, \"Which type of isomers are the molecules mentioned above?\". The phrase \"molecules mentioned above\" refers to the content of the image.\n\n*   **Step 3: Connect the question to the image content.**\n    Since the image is blank, there are no \"molecules mentioned above\" to analyze or compare. The question is unanswerable because the necessary information (the structures of the molecules) is missing.\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the given options.**\n    *   **(a) conformers isomers:** To determine if molecules are conformers, we need to see their structures and ascertain if they can be interconverted by rotation around single bonds. This is not possible without seeing the molecules.\n    *   **(b) constitutional isomers:** To determine if molecules are constitutional isomers, we need to compare their molecular formulas and connectivity. This is not possible without seeing the molecules.\n    *   **(c) Identical:** To determine if molecules are identical, we need to see their structures to compare them. This is not possible.\n    *   **(d) stereoisomers:** To determine if molecules are stereoisomers, we need to compare their connectivity and spatial arrangement of atoms. This is not possible without seeing the molecules.\n    *   **(e) None of these:** Since none of the classifications (a, b, c, d) can be applied due to the lack of information, this is the only logical conclusion. The question cannot be answered with the given data.\n\n*   **Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\n    Because the image does not show any molecules, it is impossible to establish any relationship between them. Therefore, none of the specific categories of isomerism or identity can be assigned. The correct choice is (e).\n\n<<<E>>>"
