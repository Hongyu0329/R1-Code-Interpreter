    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the song's title, musical style, and country of origin from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Musical Notation:**\n    *   **Format:** The sheet music is a \"lead sheet,\" which provides the melody on a single staff with chord symbols written above. This format is common in jazz, pop, and folk music for improvisation and accompaniment.\n    *   **Key and Time Signature:** The key signature has no sharps or flats, indicating C major or A minor. The chord progression starts and frequently resolves to a C major chord, confirming the key is C major. The time signature is 4/4.\n    *   **Chord Progression:** The chords used (C, E7, F, F#dim, G7, C-, D-, A-, G+7) are typical of early 20th-century jazz and popular music. The progression in the first four bars (C | E7 | F | F#dim G7) is particularly characteristic. The E7 acts as a secondary dominant (V7 of A minor), and the F#dim G7 is a common turnaround leading back to the tonic, C.\n    *   **Melody and Rhythm:** The melody is highly syncopated, featuring many eighth notes, sixteenth notes, and triplets. It includes fast-moving arpeggios, chromatic passing tones, and specific articulations like staccatos and slurs. This melodic and rhythmic complexity is a strong indicator of a jazz style.\n    *   **Structural Markings:** The sheet includes standard musical road map instructions like D.S. al Coda (\"Dal Segno al Coda,\" meaning \"from the sign to the Coda\"), which are common in arranged popular songs and jazz standards.\n\n2.  **Identify the Musical Style:**\n    *   The combination of the syncopated, virtuosic melody filled with arpeggios and chromaticism, along with the swinging rhythm implied by the notation, is the defining sound of **Gypsy Jazz** (also known as Jazz Manouche or Gypsy Swing). This style was pioneered by the guitarist Django Reinhardt in the 1930s. The arrangement is clearly intended to be played in this style. The original genre of the song is a foxtrot/early jazz standard, but the performance style notated here is unequivocally Gypsy Jazz.\n\n3.  **Identify the Song Title:**\n    *   The opening melodic phrase is very distinctive. In the first bar, over a C major chord, the melody is G–A–G–F#–G. In the second bar, over an E7 chord, it's G#–A–B–C–B–A–G#.\n    *   This opening melody and the subsequent chord progression (C - E7 - F - G7) are the unmistakable beginning of the jazz standard **\"Limehouse Blues\"**.\n\n4.  **Determine the Country of Origin:**\n    *   \"Limehouse Blues\" was composed in 1922. The music was written by Philip Braham and the lyrics by Douglas Furber.\n    *   Both Braham and Furber were British artists. The song was written for and premiered in a London revue titled *A to Z*. The song's theme is based on London's Limehouse district, which was the city's original Chinatown.\n    *   Therefore, the song's country of origin is the **United Kingdom**. It is important to distinguish the origin of the song itself from the origin of the specific musical style of this arrangement (Gypsy Jazz, which originated in France).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the melody, harmony, rhythm, and historical context, the sheet music is a Gypsy Jazz arrangement of the song \"Limehouse Blues,\" which originated in the United Kingdom.\n\n<<<Title: \"Limehouse Blues\"\nMusical Style: Gypsy Jazz (or Jazz Manouche)\nCountry of Origin: United Kingdom>>>"
