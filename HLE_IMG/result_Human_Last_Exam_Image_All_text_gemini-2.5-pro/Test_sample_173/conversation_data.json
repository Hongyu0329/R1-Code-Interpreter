    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Staves and Clefs:** The musical excerpt consists of two staves joined by a brace, which is standard for piano music. The top staff is in the treble clef (G-clef), and the bottom staff is also in the treble clef. This indicates both hands are playing in a relatively high register.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Rhythm in the Top Staff (Right Hand):**\n    *   The music in the top staff is composed primarily of sixteenth notes (notes with two beams).\n    *   The notes are grouped by beams. Let's look at the groupings:\n        *   **Group 1:** Four sixteenth notes. The total duration of four sixteenth notes is equivalent to one quarter note (4 x 1/16 = 4/16 = 1/4).\n        *   **Group 2:** A sixteenth rest followed by three sixteenth notes. The total duration is again equivalent to four sixteenth notes, which equals one quarter note.\n        *   **Group 3:** Four sixteenth notes. This group also equals one quarter note in duration.\n        *   **Group 4:** Four sixteenth notes. This group equals one quarter note in duration.\n    *   **Total Duration in Top Staff:** Summing the durations of these four groups, we have: 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note = 4 quarter notes.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Rhythm in the Bottom Staff (Left Hand):**\n    *   The music in the bottom staff consists of four distinct notes/chords.\n    *   **Note 1:** A chord that is a quarter note (filled-in notehead with a stem and no flags/beams).\n    *   **Note 2:** A single quarter note.\n    *   **Note 3:** A single quarter note.\n    *   **Note 4:** A single quarter note.\n    *   **Total Duration in Bottom Staff:** Summing the durations, we have: 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note = 4 quarter notes.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings and Determine the Time Signature:**\n    *   Both the top and bottom staves contain a total rhythmic value equivalent to four quarter notes.\n    *   A time signature indicates the number of beats per measure and the note value that receives one beat.\n    *   In this case, the measure contains four beats, and the quarter note gets the beat.\n    *   This is represented by the time signature **4/4**. The top '4' means four beats per measure, and the bottom '4' means a quarter note gets one beat.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   A. 2/4: Two quarter notes per measure. Incorrect.\n    *   B. 3/4: Three quarter notes per measure. Incorrect.\n    *   C. 4/4: Four quarter notes per measure. **Correct.**\n    *   D. 3/8: Three eighth notes per measure. Incorrect.\n    *   E. 9/8: Nine eighth notes per measure. Incorrect.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Beaming:** The way the sixteenth notes in the right hand are beamed into four distinct groups is a strong visual clue. Each group represents one beat, and since each group is worth a quarter note, it points towards a time signature with a quarter note beat (like 2/4, 3/4, or 4/4).\n*   **Consistency between Staves:** In standard notation, all staves in a system (like the two staves for piano) must have the same total duration within a measure. Verifying that both staves add up to four quarter notes confirms the analysis.\n*   **Note and Rest Values:** It's crucial to correctly identify the duration of each note and rest. A sixteenth note has two beams/flags, while a quarter note has none. A sixteenth rest has two hooks.\n*   **Simple vs. Compound Time:** The grouping of notes helps distinguish between simple time (beats divide into two) and compound time (beats divide into three). The grouping here clearly indicates a simple meter with four beats.\n\n<<<C>>>"
