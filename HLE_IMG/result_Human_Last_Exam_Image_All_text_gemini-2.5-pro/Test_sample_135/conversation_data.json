    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork:\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Artwork's Medium and Style:** The image displays a relief sculpture set within a decorative circular frame (a tondo). The material appears to be glazed terracotta, a technique famously pioneered and perfected by a specific family of artists in Renaissance Florence. The style of the figures—with their calm expressions, flowing drapery, and pious attitudes—is characteristic of the High Renaissance in Italy, around the late 15th or early 16th century.\n\n2.  **Identify the Subject Matter and Inscription:** The scene depicts a priest administering the Eucharist (Holy Communion) to a group of kneeling figures, including a child. At the bottom of the tondo, a small plaque (cartouche) bears the inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This is a mix of Latin and Old French/Italian, which translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" explicitly identifying the scene as the Eucharist.\n\n3.  **Connect Style and Medium to a Specific Workshop:** The use of glazed terracotta relief is the signature technique of the della Robbia family workshop in Florence. Luca della Robbia (c. 1399/1400–1482) invented the technique, and his nephew, Andrea della Robbia (1435–1525), inherited the workshop and continued the tradition with great success, often creating large, complex altarpieces.\n\n4.  **Attribute to a Specific Artist:** The refined style, the composition, and the scale of the work are highly characteristic of Andrea della Robbia. While other family members also worked in this medium, this particular quality and composition are most closely associated with him.\n\n5.  **Locate the Specific Artwork:** This tondo is a known detail from a larger work. It is one of the predella panels of the *Altarpiece of the Coronation of the Virgin*, which was created by Andrea della Robbia and his workshop around 1501-1502 for the church of San Girolamo in Fiesole, near Florence. The predella (the base of the altarpiece) features several such tondos depicting the Seven Sacraments and scenes from the life of St. Jerome.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Distinguishing the della Robbias:** It is important to differentiate between Luca, Andrea, and Giovanni della Robbia. This work's style aligns perfectly with documented works by Andrea.\n*   **The Inscription:** The inscription is a key clue, confirming the subject matter which helps in searching for the specific altarpiece.\n*   **Context of the Detail:** Recognizing this is a small part (a predella panel) of a much larger altarpiece is crucial for accurate identification.\n*   **Workshop Practice:** While Andrea della Robbia is the credited author, large commissions like this were often produced with the help of assistants in his workshop, under his direct supervision and design.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the distinctive glazed terracotta technique, the artistic style, the inscription, and its identification as a detail from the predella of the San Girolamo altarpiece, the author is definitively identified.\n\n<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
