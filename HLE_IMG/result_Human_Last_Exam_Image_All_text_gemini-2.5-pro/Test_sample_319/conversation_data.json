    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual information.**\nThe image displays two related graphs.\n*   **Top Graph (Spectrogram):** This graph shows frequency over time. There is a strong, narrow horizontal band, representing a pure tone of a constant frequency. In the middle of the graph, this band is interrupted by a vertical, wider band. This vertical band represents a sound with a broad range of frequencies, characteristic of noise. Critically, the horizontal line representing the tone is *absent* during the noise burst. This means, physically, the tone stops, is replaced by noise, and then resumes.\n*   **Bottom Graph (Waveform):** This graph shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time. It starts as a regular, smooth sine wave (representing the pure tone). Then, it abruptly changes to a complex, irregular, high-amplitude pattern (representing the noise). Finally, it returns to being a regular sine wave. This confirms the information from the spectrogram: the tone is physically replaced by noise for a short period.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the textual description.**\nThe text provides several key clues:\n*   It is an **illusion**. This means what is perceived is different from the physical reality shown in the graphs.\n*   It is similar to the **Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity**. The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where a 2D drawing of a cube can be perceived in one of two 3D orientations, and our perception can flip between them. This comparison suggests the phenomenon in question involves the brain \"filling in\" information or choosing a more plausible interpretation over the literal sensory input.\n*   It reveals a **common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability**. This implies it's a fundamental part of our sensory processing that helps us make sense of the world, for instance, by maintaining a stable perception despite incomplete or noisy data.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the visual and textual information.**\nThe image shows a tone that is physically interrupted by noise. The description points to an illusion where the brain creates a continuous perception from a discontinuous signal. When people listen to this sound stimulus, they typically do not perceive a tone, then a noise, then a tone. Instead, they report hearing the tone continue uninterrupted *behind* the burst of noise.\n\nThe brain assumes it's more likely that a continuous tone was temporarily masked by noise than that the tone conveniently stopped right when the noise started and started again right when it ended. Therefore, it \"restores\" the missing part of the tone, creating a perception of continuity. This \"filling-in\" is an unconscious process that helps us understand speech and music in noisy environments.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the name of the phenomenon.**\nThis specific perceptual phenomenon, where a sound that is interrupted by another sound is perceived as continuous, is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**. It is a prime example of perceptual completion in the auditory domain.\n\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion>>>"
