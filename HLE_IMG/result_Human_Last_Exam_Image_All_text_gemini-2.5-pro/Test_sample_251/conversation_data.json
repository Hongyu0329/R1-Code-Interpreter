    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the longest R-R interval from the ECG rhythm strip.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the ECG Parameters**\n*   The ECG strip has standard parameters printed at the top left: **25 mm/sec**. This is the paper speed.\n*   This speed means that every 25 millimeters on the horizontal axis represents 1 second of time.\n*   The ECG grid is composed of small squares and large squares.\n    *   Each **small square** is 1 mm wide. Therefore, the time duration of one small square is 1 mm / (25 mm/sec) = **0.04 seconds**.\n    *   Each **large square** is 5 mm wide (composed of 5 small squares). Therefore, the time duration of one large square is 5 mm / (25 mm/sec) = **0.20 seconds**.\n\n**Step 2: Visually Identify the Longest R-R Interval**\n*   An R-R interval is the time between the peaks of two consecutive QRS complexes (the R waves).\n*   Scan the entire rhythm strip visually. Most of the R-R intervals appear regular and consistent.\n*   However, on the fourth line of the tracing (which starts near the timestamp `0:06:08`), there is a distinct and significantly longer pause between the third and fourth QRS complexes. This is visibly the longest R-R interval on the entire strip.\n\n**Step 3: Measure the Longest R-R Interval**\n*   We need to accurately measure the distance between the peak of the third R-wave and the peak of the fourth R-wave on that fourth line.\n*   The peak of the third R-wave conveniently falls almost exactly on a thick vertical grid line. We can use this as our starting point (0 mm).\n*   Now, we count the number of squares from this starting point to the peak of the next R-wave.\n    *   Let's count the large squares first: there are 7 complete large squares between the two peaks. This accounts for 7 * 5 = 35 small squares.\n    *   After the 7th large square, we count the remaining small squares until we reach the peak of the next R-wave. There are 4 additional small squares.\n    *   The total distance is 35 + 4 = **39 small squares**.\n\n**Step 4: Convert the Measurement to Seconds**\n*   Now, we convert the measured distance in small squares into time in seconds using the value we calculated in Step 1.\n*   Time = (Number of small squares) × (Time per small square)\n*   Time = 39 small squares × 0.04 seconds/small square\n*   Time = **1.56 seconds**\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe longest R-R interval is found on the fourth line of the ECG, measures 39 small squares, which corresponds to a duration of 1.56 seconds.\n\n<<<1.56>>>"
