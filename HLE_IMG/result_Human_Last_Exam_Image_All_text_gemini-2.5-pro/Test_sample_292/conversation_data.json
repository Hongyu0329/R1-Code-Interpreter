    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Analyze the main visual features of the image.** The image displays the interior ceiling and support structure of a very large, modern building. The most prominent features are:\n    *   **The Roof Structure:** It consists of a white or light-colored steel diagrid (a framework of diagonally intersecting beams). This creates a pattern of triangles and rhombuses.\n    *   **The Glass Panels:** The ceiling is made of glass panels. These panels are not plain; they have a distinct pattern of printed blueish or grey circles of various sizes. This is a type of fritted glass, often used to control light and heat, and sometimes to prevent bird collisions.\n    *   **The Light and Shadows:** Sunlight passing through the patterned glass creates unique, dappled shadows that mimic the circular patterns onto the white beams below. This is a very characteristic visual effect.\n    *   **Surrounding Architecture:** We can see large, cylindrical support columns and other structural elements, all in a matching modern, industrial style. Through the glass, in one of the cropped images, a portion of another building is visible. This external building has a grid-like or geometric facade.\n\n2.  **Formulate a hypothesis based on the features.** The scale and style of the architecture strongly suggest a major public venue like an airport, a train station, or a convention center. The unique combination of the diagrid roof and the circle-patterned fritted glass is a highly specific design choice that can be used for identification.\n\n3.  **Search for locations with similar architectural features.** A search for \"building with diagrid roof and glass with circle patterns\" or \"convention center with patterned glass roof\" leads to images of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City.\n\n4.  **Confirm the identification.** Comparing the image in the question with photos of the Javits Center's new expansion (completed in 2021) confirms the match.\n    *   The diagrid steel structure is identical.\n    *   The fritted glass with the pattern of circles is a signature feature of the Javits Center's new roof. It was designed by the architectural firm FXCollaborative.\n    *   The resulting dappled light patterns are frequently photographed and are a well-known aspect of the new space.\n    *   The glimpse of the building outside is consistent with the view of the Hudson Yards development (specifically buildings like 55 Hudson Yards) from the Javits Center.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion.** The building in the picture is unequivocally the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. This convention center is located in Manhattan. Therefore, the city where the picture was taken is New York City. The information that the picture was taken in 2024 is consistent, as this part of the center is relatively new.\n\n<<<New York City>>>"
