The structures of the three products A, B, and C are as follows:

**Product A (C14H20N2O3):**
This product is formed from a [3+2] cycloaddition reaction. The C-acetylated intermediate (Product C) forms an azomethine ylide which reacts with methyl propiolate, followed by a decarboxylation step.

**Product B (C12H14N2O3):**
This product is the result of a Michael addition of the proline nitrogen to methyl propiolate, followed by an intramolecular cyclization (amidation) that forms a lactam and eliminates methanol.
