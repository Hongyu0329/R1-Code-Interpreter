The image displays a dimorphic fungus, characterized by the presence of both budding yeast cells (round to oval shapes) and pseudohyphae (chains of elongated cells with constrictions at the septa). This specific morphology is highly characteristic of an invasive infection by a species of *Candida*, such as *Candida albicans*.
