    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual evidence.**\n    The image shows a metal medallion, likely made of silver, featuring two busts in profile facing each other. The object has a round main body with a flat tab extending from the top, possibly for suspension. The technique appears to be repouss√©, where the design is hammered from the reverse side. The figure on the left is a male with stylized, curly hair and a prominent ram's horn curving around his ear. The figure on the right is female, also with stylized hair. The overall artistic style is not classical; the figures have large, staring eyes, and the rendering is somewhat flattened and abstract, which are characteristics of later Roman art.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the iconography.**\n    The male figure with a ram's horn is a well-known iconographic type representing Alexander the Great. After his visit to the Siwa Oasis oracle, he was declared the son of the Egyptian god Amun (identified with the Greek Zeus), who was often depicted with ram's horns. Consequently, Alexander was frequently portrayed with the \"horns of Ammon\" to signify his divine parentage. The female figure is generally identified as his mother, Olympias.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the archaeological context.**\n    This specific medallion is a famous artifact known as the \"Medallion with Alexander the Great and Olympias\". It is part of a larger discovery called the \"Treasure of Tarentum\" (or Taranto Treasure), a hoard of late Roman silver objects unearthed in Taranto, Italy.\n\n*   **Step 4: Establish the date.**\n    The style of the medallion, along with the other objects in the Tarentum hoard, is characteristic of the Late Antique period. Art historians and archaeologists date the treasure, including this medallion, based on stylistic analysis and comparison with other dated artifacts from the era, such as coins. The consensus places the creation of these objects in the late 4th century A.D.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the century.**\n    Based on the archaeological and art historical evidence, the medallion is ascribed to the late 4th century A.D.\n\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
