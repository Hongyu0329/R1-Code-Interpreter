    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Concept of Rotational Symmetry**\nRotational symmetry describes how many times an object looks identical when rotated 360 degrees around a central point. An object has n-fold rotational symmetry if it looks the same after being rotated by an angle of 360/n degrees. For a periodic tiling of a plane, the possible rotational symmetries are limited by the Crystallographic Restriction Theorem to 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold (in addition to the trivial 1-fold).\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Centers of Rotation in the Tiling**\nTo find the symmetry, we need to locate points in the pattern around which rotation leaves the entire tiling unchanged. By observing the image, we can identify several distinct and repeating features that are good candidates for centers of rotation:\n1.  The center of the dark blue hexagons.\n2.  The center of the light yellow squares.\n3.  The point where the tips of six orange rhombuses meet, forming the center of a star-like motif.\n4.  Vertices where different tiles meet.\n\n**Step 3: Test the Identified Centers for Rotational Symmetry**\nLet's test the potential centers for the highest possible order of rotation.\n\n*   **Testing the center of a dark blue hexagon:**\n    *   Select a dark blue hexagon and imagine placing a pin at its exact center.\n    *   The hexagon itself is a regular hexagon, which has 6-fold symmetry.\n    *   Observe the shapes immediately surrounding it: there are 6 light yellow squares, one attached to each side of the hexagon.\n    *   If we rotate the pattern by 360/6 = 60 degrees, the central hexagon maps onto itself. Each of the 6 surrounding squares moves perfectly into the position of its neighboring square.\n    *   Looking at the entire pattern, this 60-degree rotation shifts every element of the tiling to an identical element's position. The whole pattern appears unchanged.\n    *   This confirms that the center of each blue hexagon is a point of **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n*   **Testing the center of the star-like motif:**\n    *   Locate the point where six orange rhombuses meet at their sharpest corners. This point forms the center of a 12-pointed star (made of 6 rhombuses and 6 squares).\n    *   If we rotate the pattern by 360/6 = 60 degrees around this point, each of the six rhombuses moves into the position of the next rhombus.\n    *   Simultaneously, each of the six surrounding light yellow squares also moves into the position of its neighbor. The six surrounding blue hexagons also rotate into place.\n    *   Again, the entire tiling maps onto itself. This confirms that this point is also a center of **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n*   **Testing other points (for completeness):**\n    *   **Center of a square:** A yellow square is bordered by two blue hexagons on opposite sides and two orange rhombuses on the other opposite sides. A 90-degree (4-fold) rotation would not work, as it would map a hexagon onto a rhombus. However, a 180-degree (2-fold) rotation does work, as it swaps the hexagons and swaps the rhombuses. So, the centers of the squares are points of 2-fold symmetry.\n    *   **Midpoint of an edge between two hexagons:** This point is also a vertex for two orange rhombuses. Rotating by 180 degrees (2-fold symmetry) around this point swaps the two hexagons and the two rhombuses. This is another center of 2-fold symmetry.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Overall Rotational Symmetry**\nThe tiling possesses centers of 2-fold, 3-fold (a 6-fold center is also a 3-fold center), and 6-fold rotation. When asked for \"the\" rotational symmetry of a pattern, the convention is to state the highest order of symmetry present. In this case, the highest order is 6.\n\nTherefore, the rotational symmetry of the tiling is 6-fold.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
