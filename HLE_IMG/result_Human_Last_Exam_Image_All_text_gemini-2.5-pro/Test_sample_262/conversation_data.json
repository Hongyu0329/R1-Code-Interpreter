    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The question asks to identify which of the four depicted Iridium(III) complexes, used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), would have shorter lifetimes. In the context of device performance, \"lifetime\" typically refers to the operational lifetime, which is determined by the chemical stability of the emitter molecule under electrical stress.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Molecular Structures:** All four molecules are cationic Iridium(III) complexes. They share a common core structure: an Iridium center coordinated to two cyclometalating ligands (C^N) and one diimine ligand (N^N), with a PF6- counterion.\n    *   The diimine ligand (N^N) is the same in all four complexes: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine.\n    *   The cyclometalating ligands (C^N) are the key difference. They are all based on 2-phenylpyridine, but with different fluorine substitution patterns on the phenyl ring.\n\n3.  **Identify the Specific Ligands:**\n    *   **Complex 1:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has fluorine atoms at the 2- (ortho) and 4- (para) positions relative to the bond to the pyridine ring. The important point is the ortho-fluorine, which is adjacent to the carbon atom that forms a bond with the Iridium center.\n    *   **Complex 2:** The C^N ligand is 2-phenylpyridine. There are no fluorine substituents.\n    *   **Complex 3:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has a fluorine atom at the 2- (ortho) position.\n    *   **Complex 4:** The C^N ligand is 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has a fluorine atom at the 4- (para) position.\n\n4.  **Relate Molecular Structure to Stability and Lifetime:** The operational stability of these Ir(III) complexes is strongly influenced by the substituents on the cyclometalating ligands. A major degradation pathway for fluorinated complexes involves the cleavage of the C-F bond.\n    *   **The ortho-effect:** It is well-established in the field of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and LECs that a fluorine atom placed at the *ortho*-position (the C2 position of the phenyl ring) significantly reduces the operational stability of the complex. This is because the C-F bond in this position is weakened and more susceptible to cleavage under operating conditions (e.g., via reductive elimination involving the metal center).\n    *   **Para/Meta-substitution:** Fluorine atoms at the *para*- or *meta*-positions are much more electronically and sterically remote from the metal center. These C-F bonds are significantly more stable, and such substitutions often enhance photophysical properties (like causing a blue-shift in emission) without compromising, or even while improving, the device lifetime.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Each Complex:**\n    *   **Complex 1:** Has an *ortho*-fluorine. This is a known structural motif for instability. Therefore, it is expected to have a shorter lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 2:** Has no fluorine atoms. It lacks the C-F bond instability pathway and is generally considered a benchmark for a stable green-emitting complex. It is expected to have a longer lifetime compared to the ortho-fluorinated analogues.\n    *   **Complex 3:** Has an *ortho*-fluorine. Like Complex 1, it is expected to be unstable and have a shorter lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 4:** Has only a *para*-fluorine. This C-F bond is stable. The complex is expected to be stable and have a longer lifetime.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the presence of the destabilizing *ortho*-fluorine substituent, Complexes 1 and 3 are expected to show shorter operational lifetimes compared to Complexes 2 and 4.\n\n7.  **Final Answer Selection:** The analysis identifies Complexes [1] and [3] as having shorter lifetimes. This corresponds to answer choice F.\n\n<<<F>>>"
