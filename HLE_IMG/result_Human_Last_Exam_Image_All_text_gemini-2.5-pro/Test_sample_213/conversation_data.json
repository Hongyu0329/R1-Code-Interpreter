    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to identify the opera.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the General Characteristics of the Score**\n\n*   **Instrumentation:** The score is for a large orchestra. The visible instruments are `2 gr. Fl.` (2 große Flöten / 2 grand flutes), `I. Hob.` (1. Oboe), `engl. Horn` (English Horn), `I. Fag.` (1. Fagott / 1st Bassoon), and a large string section including `I. Viol.` (1st Violins), `II. Viol.` (2nd Violins), `Br.` (Bratschen / Violas), and `Celli` (Cellos). The strings are divided into multiple parts (`1. Pult`, `2. Pult`, `(die übrigen)` meaning \"the rest\") and include a `Solo` viola part.\n*   **Language:** The instrument names and performance directions are in German (e.g., `gr. Fl.`, `Hob.`, `Br.`, `mit Dämpfer` for \"with mute\", `(Vorhang)` for \"Curtain\"). This strongly suggests the composer is German or Austrian.\n*   **Musical Style:** The harmony is highly chromatic, lush, and complex. The writing for the strings, with its detailed divisions, shimmering textures (indicated by `dim.`, `pp`, and mutes), and soaring melodic lines, is characteristic of the late-Romantic period.\n*   **Structural Clues:** The score is marked with a rehearsal number `1` followed by the word `(Vorhang)`, which means \"Curtain\". The question states this music opens the second act. This indicates that this is the music played as the curtain rises for Act II.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Specific Musical Content**\n\nThe most identifiable feature of a musical piece is its melody. Let's examine the primary melodic line, which is in the `1. Pult` of the first violins.\n\n*   **First Violin Melody (`1. Pult`):** The melody begins on a high A, descends chromatically, and then rises again. The notes are approximately: A, G#, F#, E#, F#, G#, A, B.\n*   **Solo Viola Melody:** There is a prominent counter-melody in the `Solo Br.` (solo viola). It also features distinctive chromatic movement: C#, B#, A#, G-double-sharp, A#.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Opera**\n\n*   The combination of a late-Romantic German opera, the specific instruction for the curtain to rise at the beginning of Act II, and the highly recognizable, yearning chromatic melodies points strongly to one specific work.\n*   The music is the beginning of the garden scene from **Act II of Richard Wagner's opera *Tristan und Isolde***.\n*   The agitated orchestral prelude to Act II depicts Isolde's impatient anticipation. Following this prelude, the tempo slows down, the mood changes completely, and the curtain rises (`Vorhang`) on a summer night in the castle garden.\n*   The very music played at this moment is what is shown in the score. The first violin and solo viola parts are exact matches for the opening of this scene, which is often referred to as the \"Liebesnacht\" (Love Night) music. The shimmering, quiet, and passionate character of the music perfectly sets the scene for the lovers' reunion.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the German markings, the late-Romantic orchestral style, the instruction `(Vorhang)` for the opening of Act II, and the specific, identifiable chromatic melodies in the violin and viola, the piece of sheet music is from Richard Wagner's opera *Tristan und Isolde*.\n\n<<<Tristan und Isolde>>>"
