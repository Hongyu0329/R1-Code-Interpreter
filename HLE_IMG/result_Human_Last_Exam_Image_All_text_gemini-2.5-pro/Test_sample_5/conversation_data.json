    "*   **Step 1: Initial Musical Analysis**\n    *   **Instrumentation:** The piece is for solo piano, as indicated by the grand staff (treble and bass clefs joined together).\n    *   **Key Signature & Time Signature:** The key signature has one sharp (F#), which suggests the key of G major or E minor. The time signature is 4/4 (common time).\n    *   **Tempo:** The tempo is marked as quarter note = 80, which is a moderate tempo (Andante).\n    *   **Dynamics:** There are significant and sudden changes in dynamics. The piece starts quietly (`p` - piano), then immediately jumps to loud (`f` - forte) in measure 3, then to `mp` (mezzo-piano), and `mf` (mezzo-forte). This wide dynamic range suggests a piece with high emotional contrast and drama.\n\n*   **Step 2: Melodic and Harmonic Analysis**\n    *   **Measures 1-2:** The piece begins with a very simple and recognizable melodic line in the right hand: G-A-B-C-D-E-F#-G. This is a complete G major scale, played ascending over two measures. The left hand plays a simple G major chord. This opening is gentle and almost nostalgic.\n    *   **Measures 3 onwards:** The character of the music changes abruptly. Both hands begin playing rapid, continuous sixteenth-note patterns. The right hand plays broken chords and arpeggios in a high register, while the left hand provides a powerful bass with octaves and chords.\n    *   **Harmony:** The harmonic progression starting in measure 3 is strong and driving. It begins on G major (tonic), moves to C major (subdominant) in measure 4, and then introduces chromaticism (C# and G#) in measure 5, moving to A major. This powerful chord progression and the constant rhythmic motion are characteristic of an epic or heroic theme.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identification based on Characteristics**\n    *   The combination of a simple, memorable, almost music-box-like melody that suddenly erupts into a fast, loud, and heroic theme is a very distinctive feature.\n    *   This structure is extremely common in video game music, especially for boss battles or climactic moments where a character's theme is transformed.\n    *   The specific opening melody (the G major scale) is the main motif of the track \"Memory\" and \"His Theme\" from the video game *Undertale*, composed by Toby Fox.\n    *   The subsequent fast, heroic section with its driving sixteenth notes and I-IV harmonic movement is the main theme of \"Hopes and Dreams,\" which serves as the first phase of the final boss music in the game's True Pacifist Route.\n    *   In the game, \"His Theme\" transitions directly into \"Hopes and Dreams,\" mirroring the structure seen in this sheet music. This is not just a single piece, but an arrangement that follows the progression of the in-game music.\n\n*   **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n    *   The sheet music is an arrangement of music from the *Undertale* soundtrack. It begins with the melody of \"Memory\" / \"His Theme\" and then transitions into the main body of \"Hopes and Dreams.\" The most common title for this combined musical sequence is \"Hopes and Dreams.\"\n\n<<<Hopes and Dreams from Undertale>>>"
