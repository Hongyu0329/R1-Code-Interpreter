    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Graph:** The image provided is a raster plot.\n    *   The **x-axis** represents Time in seconds (s), from 0 to 50.\n    *   The **y-axis** represents the Electrode Number, from 0 to 128, indicating different recording sites in a neuronal culture.\n    *   Each **black dot** represents a single action potential (a \"spike\" or firing event) recorded at a specific electrode at a specific time.\n\n2.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** A \"synchronized burst\" is a period where many neurons fire rapidly and simultaneously. In the raster plot, these appear as dense, vertical bands of black dots, clearly distinct from the sparse background firing.\n\n3.  **Estimate Timestamps of Bursts:** We need to locate the center of each of these vertical bands on the time axis.\n    *   **Burst 1:** There is a clear, dense vertical band of activity centered at approximately **t = 3 s**.\n    *   **Burst 2:** The next major synchronized event is centered at approximately **t = 15 s**.\n    *   **Burst 3:** The third burst is centered at approximately **t = 25 s**.\n    *   **Burst 4:** The fourth burst is centered at approximately **t = 36 s**.\n    *   **Burst 5:** The final visible burst is centered at approximately **t = 47 s**.\n    *   Therefore, the identified timestamps for the five synchronized bursts are approximately 3 s, 15 s, 25 s, 36 s, and 47 s.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** The inter-burst interval is the time duration between the centers of two consecutive bursts. We have 5 bursts, which means there are 4 intervals to calculate.\n    *   **IBI 1:** Time between Burst 2 and Burst 1 = 15 s - 3 s = **12 s**.\n    *   **IBI 2:** Time between Burst 3 and Burst 2 = 25 s - 15 s = **10 s**.\n    *   **IBI 3:** Time between Burst 4 and Burst 3 = 36 s - 25 s = **11 s**.\n    *   **IBI 4:** Time between Burst 5 and Burst 4 = 47 s - 36 s = **11 s**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval:** To find the average, we sum the individual IBIs and divide by the number of intervals.\n    *   Sum of IBIs = 12 s + 10 s + 11 s + 11 s = 44 s.\n    *   Number of intervals = 4.\n    *   Average IBI = Sum of IBIs / Number of intervals = 44 s / 4 = **11 s**.\n\n6.  **Apply Significant Figures:** The question asks for the answer to two significant figures. Our calculated average is 11 s, which already has two significant figures (the digits '1' and '1').\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Definition of a Burst:** It is important to correctly identify the events that qualify as \"synchronized bursts.\" In this graph, they are visually unambiguous due to their high density and synchronization across many electrodes compared to the background activity.\n*   **Timestamp Estimation:** The exact center of a burst is an estimation. However, by consistently choosing the midpoint of the densest part of the activity, the potential for error is minimized. Small variations in reading these timestamps (e.g., estimating 3.5s instead of 3s) should not significantly alter the final average when rounded.\n*   **Counting Intervals:** For N bursts, there are always N-1 inter-burst intervals. It's a common mistake to divide by the number of bursts instead of the number of intervals.\n*   **Final Rounding:** The final step is to ensure the answer is presented with the correct number of significant figures as requested by the question.\n\nFinal calculation: (12 + 10 + 11 + 11) / 4 = 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
