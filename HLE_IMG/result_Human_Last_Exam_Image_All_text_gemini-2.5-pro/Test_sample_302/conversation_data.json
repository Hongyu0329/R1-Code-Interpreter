    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the characters on the seal:\n\n1.  **Identify the script and reading order:** The characters are carved in an ancient Chinese script known as Seal Script (篆書, zhuànshū). For a four-character square seal like this one, the traditional reading order is from top to bottom, and from right to left. So, we will read the right column first (top character, then bottom character), followed by the left column (top character, then bottom character).\n\n2.  **Analyze the character in the top right:** This character is a stylized form of **壽 (shòu)**. It is a very common character on seals and in calligraphy, meaning \"longevity\" or \"long life\".\n\n3.  **Analyze the character in the bottom right:** This character is **康 (kāng)**, meaning \"health\" or \"well-being\". The form is consistent with its seal script representation.\n\n4.  **Analyze the character in the top left:** This character is **年 (nián)**, which means \"year\" or \"age\". The depiction is a classic seal script form for this character.\n\n5.  **Analyze the character in the bottom left:** This character is **豐 (fēng)**. It means \"abundant,\" \"plentiful,\" or \"bountiful harvest.\" The seal script form often depicts a vessel full of goods.\n\n6.  **Combine and interpret the phrase:** Reading the characters in the correct order (壽, 康, 年, 豐), we get the phrase **壽康年豐 (shòu kāng nián fēng)**. This is a common and auspicious four-character idiom used to wish someone a long, healthy life and years of abundance and prosperity.\n\n7.  **Convert to Simplified Chinese:**\n    *   壽 becomes **寿**.\n    *   康 remains **康**.\n    *   年 remains **年**.\n    *   豐 becomes **丰**.\n\nTherefore, the character content on the seal in simplified Chinese is **寿康年丰**.\n\n<<<寿康年丰>>>"
