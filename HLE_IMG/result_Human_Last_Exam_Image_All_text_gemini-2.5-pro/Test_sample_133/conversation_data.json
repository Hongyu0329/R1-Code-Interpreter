    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to determine the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Ion (M+) Peak and Isotope Pattern**\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecular Ion Cluster:** The cluster of peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) likely represents the molecular ion and its isotopic variants. In this spectrum, this cluster is observed from m/z 258 to m/z 266.\n    *   m/z 258 (I = 17.4%)\n    *   m/z 260 (I = 34.8%)\n    *   m/z 262 (I = 29.0%)\n    *   m/z 264 (I = 12.9%)\n    *   m/z 266 (I = 3.22%)\n\n2.  **Determine Elemental Composition from Isotope Ratios:** The complex pattern with peaks separated by 2 amu suggests the presence of halogens like Chlorine (Cl, isotopes 35Cl ≈ 75.8%, 37Cl ≈ 24.2%, ratio ≈ 3:1) and/or Bromine (Br, isotopes 79Br ≈ 50.7%, 81Br ≈ 49.3%, ratio ≈ 1:1).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Fragmentation Pattern**\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Peak:** The base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum, assigned a relative intensity of 100%. Here, the base peak is at **m/z 225** (I = 100%).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Primary Fragmentation:** A common initial fragmentation is the loss of a radical from the molecular ion. Let's calculate the mass difference between the molecular ion candidate and the base peak.\n    *   Let's assume the monoisotopic molecular ion (containing only the most abundant isotopes, e.g., 12C, 1H, 35Cl, 79Br) is at m/z 258.\n    *   Mass loss = 258 - 225 = 33. This does not correspond to a common neutral loss.\n    *   Let's assume the molecular ion loses a chlorine atom. Loss of 35Cl from a molecular ion at m/z 258 would result in a fragment at m/z 223. There is a very intense peak at **m/z 223** (I = 60.1%).\n    *   This suggests a fragmentation pathway: [M]+• → [M-Cl]+ + Cl•.\n\n**Step 3: Combine Evidence and Propose a Formula**\n\n1.  **Hypothesis:** The compound contains both Chlorine and Bromine. Let's test the formula **C6H2BrCl3**.\n    *   Monoisotopic Molecular Weight (using 79Br and 35Cl): (6 * 12) + (2 * 1) + (1 * 79) + (3 * 35) = 72 + 2 + 79 + 105 = **258 u**. This matches the start of our molecular ion cluster.\n\n2.  **Check Molecular Ion Isotope Pattern:** Let's calculate the theoretical isotope pattern for C6H2BrCl3 and compare it with the observed data (normalized to the m/z 260 peak).\n    *   **Theoretical Ratio (M:M+2:M+4:M+6):** ~52 : 100 : 64 : 17\n    *   **Observed Ratio (258:260:262:264):** 17.4:34.8:29.0:12.9 which normalizes to **50 : 100 : 83 : 37**.\n    *   The match for the first two peaks (M and M+2) is very good. The higher mass peaks show some deviation, which is common.\n\n3.  **Check the Fragment Ion Isotope Pattern ([M-Cl]+):**\n    *   If the parent molecule is C6H2BrCl3, the [M-Cl]+ fragment is **[C6H2BrCl2]+**.\n    *   The monoisotopic mass of this fragment is 258 - 35 = 223 u.\n    *   This fragment contains one Bromine and two Chlorine atoms. Let's calculate its expected isotope pattern and compare it with the observed cluster around the base peak.\n    *   The fragment cluster consists of peaks at m/z 223, 225, 227, 229.\n    *   **Theoretical Ratio (m/z 223:225:227:229):** The most intense peak is predicted to be at m/z 225. Normalizing to it, the ratio is ~62 : 100 : 45 : 6.\n    *   **Observed Ratio (m/z 223:225:227:229):** The intensities are 60.1, 100, 66.7, 22.2. The ratio is **60 : 100 : 67 : 22**.\n    *   The agreement between the theoretical and observed patterns for this fragment cluster is excellent, especially for the most intense peaks (223 and 225). This strongly supports the proposed formula.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the IUPAC Name**\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Structure:** The formula C6H2BrCl3 corresponds to a benzene ring substituted with one bromine atom, three chlorine atoms, and two hydrogen atoms. The parent name is benzene.\n\n2.  **Name the Substituents:** The substituents are \"bromo\" and \"trichloro\".\n\n3.  **Number the Ring:** According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the substituents are listed alphabetically (bromo then chloro). The numbering should be chosen to give the lowest possible set of locants (numbers).\n    *   The possible substitution patterns for four substituents are 1,2,3,4; 1,2,3,5; and 1,2,4,5. The set {1,2,3,4} is the lowest.\n    *   When there is a choice, the substituent cited first alphabetically (bromo) is given the lowest possible number from the locant set.\n    *   Therefore, a valid systematic name is **1-Bromo-2,3,4-trichlorobenzene**. (Other isomers like 4-Bromo-1,2,3-trichlorobenzene are also possible, but the mass spectrum cannot distinguish them. Any valid IUPAC name for an isomer of C6H2BrCl3 is correct).\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis of the molecular ion cluster, the primary fragmentation (loss of Cl), and the isotopic pattern of the resulting fragment strongly supports the molecular formula C6H2BrCl3. The IUPAC systematic name for a compound with this formula is an isomer of bromotrichlorobenzene.\n\n<<<1-Bromo-2,3,4-trichlorobenzene>>>"
