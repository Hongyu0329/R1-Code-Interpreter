    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the jazz standard.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Basic Musical Elements**\n*   **Key Signature and Tonality:** The key signature shows one flat (Bb), which typically indicates F Major or D minor. However, the piece starts and ends on an F minor chord (F-), and the chord progression (e.g., C7 to F-) strongly suggests the piece is in the key of **F minor**. It is common in jazz lead sheets to use a \"concert key\" signature (or none at all) and write in accidentals as needed.\n*   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4, also known as common time, which is typical for many jazz tunes.\n*   **Form:** The piece appears to have a repeating structure with first and second endings (indicated by \"1.\" and \"2.\"), suggesting a standard song form like AABA or ABAC. The total length looks like a 32-bar form, but the repeats make it longer. The section from measure 9 to 16 seems to be a bridge or B-section.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Melody**\n*   The most identifiable part of a tune is often its melody. Let's examine the first few measures.\n*   **Measure 1:** Over an F minor chord, the melody plays the notes C, F, G, Ab. The rhythm is a quarter note, another quarter note, and two eighth notes. This is a very distinctive and memorable opening phrase. In the context of F minor, these notes are the 5th, root, 2nd, and minor 3rd of the scale.\n*   **Measure 2:** A half note on Bb.\n*   **Measure 3:** A half note on C.\n*   This specific melodic sequence (C F G Ab | Bb | C) is extremely well-known in the jazz repertoire.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Chord Progression**\n*   The chord progression provides further clues.\n*   **A-Section (Measures 1-8):** | F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7 | C7 | F- | ... This progression, particularly the descending bass line from F to E to Eb, is characteristic of a specific style.\n*   **B-Section / Bridge (Measures 9-16):** | D-7b5 | G7 | C7 | F7 | Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab | G C7 |. This is a series of ii-V progressions and dominant chords moving through a cycle, a common feature in jazz bridges.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Identify the Tune**\n*   The melodic phrase in the first measure is the unmistakable opening theme of the jazz standard **\"Nica's Dream\"**.\n*   The composer of \"Nica's Dream\" is the renowned hard-bop pianist and composer **Horace Silver**. He wrote the piece in honor of his friend and patron, Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter, whose nickname was \"Nica\".\n*   While the chord progression in this specific lead sheet might have some variations compared to other published versions (which is common with jazz standards), the melody is the definitive identifier. The \"Latin\" feel of the A-section followed by a swinging B-section is also a hallmark of this composition.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the iconic opening melody, the tune is \"Nica's Dream,\" composed by Horace Silver.\n\n<<<Title: Nica's Dream, Composer: Horace Silver>>>"
