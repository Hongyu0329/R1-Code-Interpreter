    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the given knot.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the properties of the knot from its diagram.**\n\n1.  **Crossing Number:** First, we count the number of crossings in the diagram. By careful inspection, we can identify 6 distinct crossings. The knot is therefore a 6-crossing knot.\n2.  **Alternating Property:** An alternating knot diagram is one where the crossings alternate between over and under as one travels along the knot. Let's trace the path of the knot in the given diagram. If we start on the outermost loop on the left and travel clockwise, the strand passes *over* the crossing on the left side, and then continues to pass *over* the crossing on the right side. Since there are two consecutive \"over\" crossings, the diagram is **non-alternating**.\n3.  **Knot Type Identification:** In the standard knot table (the Rolfsen table), there are three prime knots with 6 crossings: 6₁, 6₂, and 6₃.\n    *   The **6₁ knot** (also known as the Stevedore knot) is an **alternating** knot.\n    *   The **6₂ knot** is a **non-alternating** knot.\n    *   The **6₃ knot** is also a **non-alternating** knot.\n    Since the provided diagram is non-alternating, the knot it represents must be a non-alternating knot. Therefore, the knot shown in the picture must be either the 6₂ knot or the 6₃ knot.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Rasmussen invariant.**\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant, denoted as `s(K)`, is an integer-valued invariant of a knot `K`. It is derived from a filtered version of Khovanov homology. This invariant is a concordance invariant and provides a lower bound for the slice genus `g₄(K)` via the inequality `|s(K)| ≤ 2g₄(K)`.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Rasmussen invariant for the candidate knots.**\n\nTo find the Rasmussen invariant of the given knot, we need to find the values of `s` for our candidate knots, 6₂ and 6₃. These values are well-established and can be found in knot theory databases and literature.\n\n*   For the knot **6₂**, the Rasmussen invariant is `s(6₂) = -2`.\n*   For the knot **6₃**, the Rasmussen invariant is `s(6₃) = -2`.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the final answer.**\n\nOur analysis in Step 1 showed that the knot in the picture must be either 6₂ or 6₃. As we've seen in Step 3, both of these knots have the same Rasmussen invariant. Therefore, regardless of whether the diagram represents the 6₂ or the 6₃ knot, the answer is the same.\n\n**Conclusion:** The Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the attached picture is -2.\n\n***\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Accurate Knot Identification:** The most crucial step is to correctly classify the knot type. Miscounting the crossings or misjudging the alternating property would lead to the wrong set of candidate knots.\n*   **Alternating vs. Non-alternating Diagrams:** A non-alternating knot is one that has *no* alternating diagrams. A single non-alternating diagram, like the one shown, is sufficient to prove the knot is not 6₁, which is defined as an alternating knot.\n*   **Reliable Data Source:** The values of knot invariants like the Rasmussen `s`-invariant or the signature `σ` should be taken from reliable sources like the Knot Atlas, KnotInfo, or peer-reviewed mathematical publications.\n*   **Distinguishing 6₂ and 6₃:** For this particular question, it is not necessary to distinguish between 6₂ and 6₃, as they share the same Rasmussen invariant. If the question had asked for an invariant that differs between them (like the Alexander polynomial or the determinant), a more detailed analysis of the diagram would be required.\n\nBy following these steps and careful considerations, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<-2>>>"
