    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each rock specimen to determine its identity.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Specimen H**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is reddish-brown and highly porous, with many visible holes or cavities (vesicles). The overall texture is fine-grained (aphanitic), meaning individual crystals are not visible to the naked eye.\n*   **Interpretation:** The vesicular texture indicates that the rock formed from lava that cooled rapidly, trapping gas bubbles. This is characteristic of an extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock. The reddish color is often due to the oxidation of iron. This type of rock is known as scoria or volcanic cinder.\n*   **Identification:** **H is Scoria.**\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Specimen I**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is composed of various angular rock fragments (clasts) cemented together in a finer-grained matrix. The clasts vary in size and color, including reddish, gray, and white pieces.\n*   **Interpretation:** This texture, known as a clastic texture, is formed from the accumulation of broken pieces of rock. When these fragments are volcanic in origin (ash, lapilli, bombs) and are consolidated into a solid rock, it is called a pyroclastic rock. Given the angular nature and mix of volcanic-looking fragments, this specimen is a volcanic breccia or a tuff.\n*   **Identification:** **I is Volcanic Breccia or Tuff.**\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Specimen J**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is light-colored (off-white or light gray) and, like specimen H, is highly vesicular and appears very lightweight and porous. The texture is fine-grained (aphanitic).\n*   **Interpretation:** This is another extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock that cooled quickly. Its light color indicates a felsic (silica-rich) composition. A highly vesicular, low-density, light-colored volcanic rock is known as pumice. Pumice is so porous that it can often float on water.\n*   **Identification:** **J is Pumice.**\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Specimen K**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. This is a coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture. The crystals are of different colors, including light-colored minerals (likely quartz and feldspar) and some darker minerals (like biotite or hornblende).\n*   **Interpretation:** The coarse-grained, crystalline texture indicates that the rock cooled slowly deep beneath the Earth's surface, allowing large crystals to grow. This is characteristic of an intrusive (plutonic) igneous rock. The mineral composition (light-colored quartz and feldspar with some dark mafic minerals) is the classic makeup of granite.\n*   **Identification:** **K is Granite.**\n\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria (extrusive igneous)\n*   **I:** Volcanic Breccia/Tuff (pyroclastic igneous)\n*   **J:** Pumice (extrusive igneous)\n*   **K:** Granite (intrusive igneous)\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Volcanic Breccia (or Tuff)\nJ: Pumice\nK: Granite>>>"
