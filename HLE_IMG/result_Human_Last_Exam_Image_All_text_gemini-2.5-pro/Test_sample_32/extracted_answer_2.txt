The main difference is the curvature of the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight, holding the capsule erect. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is strongly curved or arched (arcuate), causing the capsule to be immersed and often nodding or oriented downwards.
