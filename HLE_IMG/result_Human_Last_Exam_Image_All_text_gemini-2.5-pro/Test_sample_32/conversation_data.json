    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question and the botanical terms.**\nThe question asks for the main difference in the *sporophyte* between two moss species, *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*, that allows for identification \"at a glance\".\n*   **Sporophyte:** In mosses, this is the diploid, spore-producing generation that grows out of the leafy gametophyte. It typically consists of a foot, a stalk called a **seta**, and a spore-containing capsule.\n*   **\"At a glance\":** This implies a large, easily observable, macroscopic feature, not one that requires a microscope.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the scientific names for clues.**\nThe names of species often describe a key feature.\n*   ***Grimmia montana***: \"Montana\" means \"of the mountains,\" referring to its typical habitat. This name doesn't give a clue about its physical structure.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta***: This name is highly informative. In Latin, \"curvi-\" means curved, and \"**seta**\" is the stalk of the sporophyte. Therefore, the name itself suggests that this species has a **curved seta**.\n\n**Step 3: Research the sporophyte characteristics of *Grimmia montana*.**\n*   *Grimmia montana* has sporophytes that are common.\n*   The **seta** is short and **straight**.\n*   Because the seta is straight, the capsule is held erect (upright) and is typically emergent (partially exposed) to shortly exserted (fully exposed just above the leaves). The capsules in the provided image, being erect on very short, straight setae, are consistent with this description.\n\n**Step 4: Research the sporophyte characteristics of *Grimmia curviseta*.**\n*   As its name implies, the most distinctive feature of *Grimmia curviseta* is its sporophyte.\n*   The **seta** is strongly **curved**, often in an S-shape or arch (this is described as arcuate or cygneous).\n*   This pronounced curve causes the capsule to be tucked back among the leaves, often oriented sideways or facing downwards (cernuous or nodding). The capsule is immersed within the perichaetial leaves (the specialized leaves at the base of the seta).\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize and identify the main difference.**\nBy comparing the two species, the most obvious and defining difference in the sporophyte is the shape and orientation of the seta.\n*   ***Grimmia montana***: **Straight seta**, resulting in an erect capsule.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta***: **Strongly curved seta**, resulting in an immersed, often nodding or downward-pointing capsule.\n\nThis difference in the curvature of the seta is a reliable field character that can be seen with the naked eye or a hand lens, perfectly fitting the \"distinguish at a glance\" criterion.\n\n<<<The main difference is the curvature of the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight, holding the capsule erect. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is strongly curved or arched (arcuate), causing the capsule to be immersed and often nodding or oriented downwards.>>>"
