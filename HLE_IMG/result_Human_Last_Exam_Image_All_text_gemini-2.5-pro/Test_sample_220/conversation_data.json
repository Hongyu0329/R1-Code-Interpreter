    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which image represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the atomic pattern of an FCC crystal viewed along the [110] direction.**\n\n*   A face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal has atoms at the corners of the unit cell and in the center of each face.\n*   When you view this structure along the [110] direction (which is a face diagonal), the atoms project onto a 2D plane perpendicular to this direction.\n*   The resulting 2D pattern is known as a **centered rectangular lattice**.\n*   This pattern consists of a rectangular grid of atoms, with an additional atom located in the center of each rectangle.\n*   The unit cell of this 2D projection is a rectangle with side lengths in the ratio of `sqrt(2) : 1`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the pattern in each of the given images.**\n\nWe will now examine the projected patterns in each of the four options to see which one matches the \"centered rectangle\" description.\n\n*   **Image A:** The atoms are arranged in a simple rectangular grid. You can see vertical columns of atoms at x-coordinates of approximately 2 and 4.5, and horizontal rows. There are no atoms in the centers of the rectangles formed by these grid points. This pattern is characteristic of a simple cubic lattice viewed along the [110] direction, not an FCC lattice. Therefore, A is incorrect.\n\n*   **Image C:** The atoms are arranged in a pattern with clear six-fold rotational symmetry, forming hexagons. This hexagonal pattern is characteristic of an FCC structure viewed along the [111] direction (a body diagonal) or an HCP structure viewed along the [0001] direction. Since the question asks for the [110] direction, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Image D:** This image shows two distinct, interpenetrating rectangular grids of atoms. One grid is offset from the other. This is different from the centered rectangular pattern, which has a single atom in the center of a rectangle, not a whole second grid. This pattern is more akin to a [100] view of a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice. Therefore, D is incorrect.\n\n*   **Image B:** Let's analyze this pattern for the centered rectangular feature. Although the points are not perfectly aligned, we can identify the characteristic pattern.\n    1.  Identify a potential rectangle formed by four corner atoms. Let's consider the atoms at approximately (1,6) and (8,4) as two opposite corners of a parallelogram. The other two corners would be (1,4) and (8,6) if it were an axis-aligned rectangle. We see atoms close to these positions: (1,3) is close to (1,4) and (8,7) is close to (8,6).\n    2.  Now, find the center of this potential rectangle. The center of a rectangle with corners at (1,4) and (8,6) would be at x = (1+8)/2 = 4.5 and y = (4+6)/2 = 5.\n    3.  Looking at the image, there is an atom precisely at (4.5, 5).\n    4.  This configuration—four atoms forming a rectangle with a fifth atom at its center—is the defining feature of a centered rectangular lattice. The other atoms in the image, such as (1,9) and (4.5,8), belong to adjacent, repeating unit cells.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion.**\n\nBased on the analysis, Image A shows a simple rectangle, Image C shows a hexagonal pattern, and Image D shows two interpenetrating grids. Only Image B displays the characteristic **centered rectangular** pattern that results from viewing an FCC crystal along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
