    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and determine its molecular formula.**\n\nThe starting material is a complex bicyclic molecule. Let's break it down into its components to determine its molecular formula.\n*   **Bicyclic Core:** The core structure is a 7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-one. This is a bicyclic system containing a nitrogen atom and a carbonyl group within its rings.\n*   **Substituents:**\n    *   A trifluoromethyl group (–CF3) is attached to the double bond.\n    *   A p-methoxybenzyl group (–PMB) is attached to the nitrogen atom. The PMB group has the structure -CH2-C6H4-OCH3.\n\nLet's count the atoms for the entire molecule:\n*   **Carbon (C):**\n    *   Bicyclic skeleton (excluding substituents but including the carbonyl carbon): 6 C\n    *   Trifluoromethyl group (–CF3): 1 C\n    *   PMB group (–CH2-C6H4-OCH3): 1 (for CH2) + 6 (for the benzene ring) + 1 (for OCH3) = 8 C\n    *   Total Carbon = 6 + 1 + 8 = 15 C\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   Bicyclic skeleton: There are two bridgehead C-H protons, one C-H proton on the double bond, and a -CH2- bridge, for a total of 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5 H.\n    *   PMB group: 2 (from CH2) + 4 (from the benzene ring) + 3 (from OCH3) = 9 H.\n    *   Total Hydrogen = 5 + 9 = 14 H.\n*   **Fluorine (F):** The –CF3 group has 3 F atoms.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** There is one N atom in the bicyclic ring.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** There is one O in the carbonyl group (C=O) and one O in the methoxy group (–OCH3) of the PMB substituent. Total = 2 O.\n\nThus, the molecular formula of the **Starting Material** is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction (formation of Intermediate 1).**\n\n*   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Transformation:** CAN is a strong oxidizing agent commonly used for the oxidative cleavage of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting groups from alcohols and amines. In this case, it will remove the PMB group from the nitrogen atom.\n*   **Change in Formula:** The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed from the nitrogen, and a hydrogen atom (H) is added in its place (forming an N-H bond).\n    *   Atoms removed: C8, H9, O1.\n    *   Atoms added: H1.\n    *   Net change: -C8, -H8, -O1.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 1:**\n    *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   H: 14 - 8 = 6\n    *   F: 3 (unchanged)\n    *   N: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   The molecular formula of **Intermediate 1** is **C7H6F3NO**. This is a bicyclic lactam with a C=C double bond and a CF3 group.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction (formation of Intermediate 2).**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 in MeOH (Palladium on carbon with hydrogen gas in methanol).\n*   **Transformation:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The palladium catalyst facilitates the addition of hydrogen (H2) across the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), reducing it to a carbon-carbon single bond (C-C). Other functional groups like the lactam (amide) and the trifluoromethyl group are stable under these conditions.\n*   **Change in Formula:** One molecule of H2 is added to the structure.\n    *   Net change: +H2.\n*   **Formula of Intermediate 2:**\n    *   C: 7 (unchanged)\n    *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n    *   F: 3 (unchanged)\n    *   N: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   O: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   The molecular formula of **Intermediate 2** is **C7H8F3NO**. This is a saturated bicyclic lactam.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third reaction (formation of the final Product).**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 °C (concentrated aqueous acid with heating).\n*   **Transformation:** These conditions promote the hydrolysis of the lactam (a cyclic amide). The amide bond is cleaved by the addition of one molecule of water (H2O). This opens the bicyclic ring to form an amino acid. The nitrogen atom becomes an amino group (–NH2), and the carbonyl carbon becomes a carboxylic acid group (–COOH).\n*   **Change in Formula:** One molecule of H2O is added to the structure of Intermediate 2.\n    *   Net change: +H2, +O1.\n*   **Formula of the final Product:**\n    *   C: 7 (unchanged)\n    *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   F: 3 (unchanged)\n    *   N: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   The molecular formula of the **Product** is **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\n**Summary of Formula Changes:**\n*   **Starting Material:** C15H14F3NO2\n*   **Intermediate 1:** C7H6F3NO (-C8H8O)\n*   **Intermediate 2:** C7H8F3NO (+H2)\n*   **Product:** C7H10F3NO2 (+H2O)\n\nThe final product is an amino acid with the molecular formula C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
