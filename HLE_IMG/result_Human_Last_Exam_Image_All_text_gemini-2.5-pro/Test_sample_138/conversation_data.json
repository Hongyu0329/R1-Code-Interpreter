    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the insects in each pair to determine their biological sex.\n\n**Careful Points and General Principles for Sexing Hymenoptera (Bees and Wasps):**\n\n1.  **Antennae:** This is often the most reliable feature. Males typically have longer antennae with one more segment than females (13 vs. 12). In some groups, like the paper wasps in pair B, the tips of the male antennae are distinctly curled or hooked.\n2.  **Abdomen (Gaster):** The shape of the abdomen's tip is a key indicator. Females have an ovipositor (egg-laying organ), which is modified into a stinger in most bees and wasps, giving the abdomen a more pointed appearance. Males lack a stinger and often have a blunter or more complex abdominal tip, sometimes with claspers for mating. The number of visible dorsal segments can also differ (usually 6 in females, 7 in males).\n3.  **Facial Markings:** In many bee and wasp species, males have more extensive yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus) than females.\n4.  **Pollen-Collecting Hairs (Scopae):** The question states the insects are from taxa without scopae on their legs. This is true for all wasps, for cuckoo bees (which are parasites), and for all male bees. Female bees of most species *do* have scopae, so their absence on a bee is a strong indicator that it is either male or belongs to a specialized group like cuckoo bees.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Pair A: Cuckoo Bees (*Coelioxys*)**\n*   **Left Insect:** This individual has a long, sharply pointed, conical abdomen. This is the highly specialized ovipositor of a female *Coelioxys* bee, which she uses to pierce the nest walls of her host to lay an egg. This is a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Right Insect:** This individual's abdomen is not pointed. Instead, it ends in several distinct spines or prongs. This multi-pronged structure is characteristic of a male *Coelioxys*. This is a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The pair is Female, Male (F, M), which corresponds to option **4**.\n\n**Pair B: Paper Wasps (*Polistes*)**\n*   **Left Insect:** This is a paper wasp. Its antennae appear relatively straight and unspecialized. The abdomen tapers to a point, typical for a female equipped with a stinger. This is a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Right Insect:** This is also a paper wasp. The most telling feature is its antennae, which are clearly hooked or curled at the tips. This is a definitive characteristic of a male paper wasp. This is a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The pair is Female, Male (F, M), which corresponds to option **4**.\n\n**Pair C: Long-horned Bees (Tribe Eucerini)**\n*   **Left Insect:** This bee has exceptionally long antennae that curve back well past its head, the defining feature of male \"long-horned bees\". It also has a pale yellow clypeus (face). These are classic features of a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Right Insect:** This bee is from the same group. Although seen from above, its antennae are also visibly long. Furthermore, its hind legs are visible and lack the large, dense pollen brushes (scopae) that a female of this group would possess. This is also a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** The pair is Male, Male (M, M), which corresponds to option **1**.\n\n**Final Answer Construction:**\n*   Index for A: 4 (F, M)\n*   Index for B: 4 (F, M)\n*   Index for C: 1 (M, M)\n\nCombining these gives the final answer string.\n\n<<<4, 4, 1>>>"
