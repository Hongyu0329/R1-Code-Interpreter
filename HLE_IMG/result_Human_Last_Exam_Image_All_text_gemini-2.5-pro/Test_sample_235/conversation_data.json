    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the metric pattern of the words in the erasure poem:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the text of the poem.**\nThe poem is created using the technique of erasure/collage. The most prominent words are those cut out and pasted onto the image. Reading them in a logical top-to-bottom, left-to-right sequence, we get the phrase: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\".\n\n**Step 2: Count the syllables of the primary text.**\nLet's count the syllables for each word in the collaged phrase:\n*   \"rules\": 1 syllable\n*   \"and\": 1 syllable\n*   \"lines\": 1 syllable\n*   \"an\": 1 syllable\n*   \"in-tri-cate\": 3 syllables\n*   \"spi-der's\": 2 syllables\n*   \"web\": 1 syllable\n*   \"work\": 1 syllable\n\nTotal syllable count for the collaged words = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11 syllables.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the answer choices based on the initial count.**\nAn 11-syllable line is called a hendecasyllabic line. Let's review the options:\n*   A. **free verse:** Poetry without a regular meter. This is possible, as the 11-syllable line does not have a clear, repeating stress pattern.\n*   B. **iambic pentameter:** Requires 10 syllables per line in an iambic (unstressed-stressed) pattern. This does not fit.\n*   C. **alexandrine:** Requires 12 syllables per line. This does not fit.\n*   D. **sapphic:** A specific stanza form using three 11-syllable (hendecasyllabic) lines followed by a 5-syllable line. While our poem has 11 syllables, it is only a single line and does not follow the full Sapphic stanza structure or its specific meter.\n*   E. **loose iambic trimeter:** Requires about 6 syllables per line in a roughly iambic pattern. This does not fit.\n*   F. **american sentence:** A specific form invented by Allen Ginsberg, consisting of a single sentence that is exactly 17 syllables long. Our count of 11 syllables does not fit this definition.\n\n**Step 4: Re-examine the image for additional text.**\nThe initial analysis doesn't lead to a perfect match with most specific forms. However, the specificity of the \"American sentence\" option, combined with the fact that this form is popular in contemporary and collage poetry, suggests we might be missing something. Let's look for more text.\n*   The page title (\"THE FIRST STEP\"), page number (\"35\"), and plate number (\"Pl. 4\") are visible. Including them leads to totals of 14, 13, 16, or 18 syllables, none of which is 17.\n*   There is a faint line of text at the bottom of the image, part of the original book page. The visible words are \"Coloured with mother of...\". This is a common feature in erasure poetry, where the \"ghost\" text of the original source is part of the new work.\n\n**Step 5: Count the syllables of the additional text.**\nLet's count the syllables in the faint line:\n*   \"Co-loured\": 2 syllables\n*   \"with\": 1 syllable\n*   \"mo-ther\": 2 syllables\n*   \"of\": 1 syllable\n\nTotal syllable count for the faint text = 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 6 syllables.\n\n**Step 6: Combine all parts of the poem and recount.**\nIf we combine the collaged text with the faint text, we form a longer sentence:\n\"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work, coloured with mother of...\"\nThe total syllable count is:\n11 (from the collage) + 6 (from the faint text) = 17 syllables.\n\n**Step 7: Final Conclusion.**\nThe complete poetic text, combining the highlighted and faint words, forms a single sentence of 17 syllables. This precisely matches the definition of an \"American sentence\". Therefore, the words in the erasure poem follow this metric pattern.\n\n<<<F>>>"
