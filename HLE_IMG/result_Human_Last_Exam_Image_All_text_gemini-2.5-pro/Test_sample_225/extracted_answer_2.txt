The final product is a neutral molecule formed via demethylation of all six methoxy groups followed by an intramolecular cyclization. In this cyclization, the oxygen atom of one of the ortho-hydroxyl groups attacks the central carbocation, forming a five-membered ring. The resulting structure contains a central sp3-hybridized carbon atom bonded to two 2,3-dihydroxyphenyl groups, and is also part of a 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran ring system which has a hydroxyl group at position 3 of its benzene moiety.
The structure is shown below:
