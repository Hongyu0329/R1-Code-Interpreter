    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to find the percentage reduction in **Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled)**, not total trips or Person Miles Traveled (PMT).\n2.  **Relevant Data:** We must use the data for the two car modes: \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n3.  **VMT vs. PMT:** VMT is calculated per vehicle. The \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" data (2.8 and 3) is used for calculating PMT, not VMT, and is therefore not needed for this problem.\n4.  **Relative Calculation:** The total number of trips in the region is not provided. We can perform a relative calculation by assuming a total number of trips (e.g., 100) or by calculating a \"VMT Index\" which is proportional to the actual VMT. The unknown total number of trips will cancel out in the percentage reduction calculation.\n5.  **Weighted Calculation:** The total Car VMT is a weighted sum. For each distance category, we need to multiply the `share of total trips` by the `total car mode share` for that distance and by the `average trip distance`. These results are then summed up.\n6.  **Formula:** The percentage reduction is calculated as `((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100%`.\n\n---\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Baseline Car VMT Index**\n\nWe calculate a VMT index for each distance category and sum them. The formula for each segment is:\n`VMT Index = (Share of Total Trips) × (Total Car Share) × (Average Trip Distance)`\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 25% (1 occupant) + 28% (>2 occupants) = 53%\n    *   VMT Index = 0.48 × 0.53 × 1 = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   VMT Index = 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   VMT Index = 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   VMT Index = 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = 2.8480\n\n*   **Total Baseline Car VMT Index** = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Proposed Car VMT Index**\n\nWe repeat the same calculation using the data from Table 2.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   VMT Index = 0.48 × 0.03 × 1 = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   VMT Index = 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   VMT Index = 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   VMT Index = 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = 1.5680\n\n*   **Total Proposed Car VMT Index** = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\n*   **Reduction in VMT Index** = Baseline VMT Index - Proposed VMT Index\n    = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (Reduction in VMT Index / Baseline VMT Index) × 100%\n    = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100%\n    = 0.52195... × 100% ≈ 52.2%\n\nThe percentage of Car VMT that can be reduced is approximately 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
