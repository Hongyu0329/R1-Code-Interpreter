    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each artwork.\n\n**Analysis of each artwork:**\n\n1.  **Top-left:** This is a modern cartoon-style ink painting depicting four whimsical fish, one with a human face, reacting to a fishhook. This distinct satirical and humorous style is the signature of **Liao Bingxiong (廖冰兄)**, a renowned Chinese cartoonist. This particular work is one of his famous \"Self-Reflection\" (自嘲) series.\n\n2.  **Top-center:** This is a classic Chinese ink wash painting (水墨画) of chrysanthemums. The style, with its bold yet refined brushwork for the leaves and delicate rendering of the flowers, along with the red seal in the upper left, is characteristic of the master painter **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**, who was famous for his depictions of flowers, plants, and small animals.\n\n3.  **Top-right:** This is a powerful and realistic portrait of an elderly woman, rendered in ink and color on paper. This technique of using traditional Chinese painting tools to achieve a high degree of modern realism, especially in portraiture of common people, is the hallmark of **Jiang Zhaohe (蒋兆和)**. This is a representative work of his.\n\n4.  **Middle-left:** This image shows a fragment of Chinese calligraphy in a highly fluid and energetic cursive script (草书). This style, known as \"wild cursive\" (狂草), is famously associated with the Tang Dynasty monk and calligrapher **Huaisu (怀素)**. The piece is a detail from his masterpiece, the \"Autobiography Scroll\" (《自叙帖》).\n\n5.  **Middle-center:** This is a modern painting that blends traditional landscape elements with abstract forms. The use of bold geometric shapes (the red and orange circles representing suns) over a stylized ink wash landscape is a signature style of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**, a pivotal figure in modern Chinese art who integrated Western abstraction with Chinese artistic traditions. The work is titled \"New Sun\" (《新日》).\n\n6.  **Middle-right:** This is a piece of calligraphy in an elegant and well-structured regular script (楷书). The style is famously that of **Zhao Mengfu (赵孟頫)**, a master calligrapher and painter of the Yuan Dynasty. The text is from his well-known work \"Record of the Reconstruction of the Xuanmiao Temple\" (《玄妙观重修三门记》). His style became a model for generations of calligraphers.\n\n7.  **Bottom-left:** This is a piece of calligraphy in semi-cursive script (行书). The text itself refers to \"Jiang Kui's Sequel to the Treatise on Calligraphy\" (姜夔续书谱). This work is indeed the famous treatise on calligraphy by the Southern Song dynasty poet, musician, and calligrapher **Jiang Kui (姜夔)**.\n\n8.  **Bottom-center:** This is a highly realistic oil portrait of a young woman against a background of leaves. This work is one of the most iconic examples of the \"New Classical\" style in Chinese oil painting. It is \"Youth\" (《青年女歌手》), a masterpiece painted in 1984 by **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**.\n\n9.  **Bottom-right:** This is an ink and color painting of a woman in the ethnic attire of one of China's western minority groups. The lively and expressive brushwork, combined with the subject matter, is characteristic of **Huang Zhou (黄胄)**. His signature, \"黄胄,\" is also visible on the left side of the painting. He was celebrated for his dynamic depictions of life in Xinjiang.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nListing the authors from left to right, top to bottom:\n\n1.  Liao Bingxiong\n2.  Qi Baishi\n3.  Jiang Zhaohe\n4.  Huaisu\n5.  Wu Guanzhong\n6.  Zhao Mengfu\n7.  Jiang Kui\n8.  Jin Shangyi\n9.  Huang Zhou\n\n<<<Liao Bingxiong, Qi Baishi, Jiang Zhaohe, Huaisu, Wu Guanzhong, Zhao Mengfu, Jiang Kui, Jin Shangyi, Huang Zhou>>>"
