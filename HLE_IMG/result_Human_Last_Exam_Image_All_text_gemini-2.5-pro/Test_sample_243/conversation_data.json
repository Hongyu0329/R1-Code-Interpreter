    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to answer the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the plant in the image.**\nThe most striking feature of the plant in the image is its leaves. They are dark green, ovate to lanceolate in shape, and possess a highly detailed, intricate network of pale white or light green veins. This pattern is often described as reticulated or netted. This unique venation is a strong clue for identification.\n\n**Step 2: Research plants with similar leaf characteristics.**\nA search for plants with \"netted white veins on green leaves\" or \"reticulated leaf venation\" leads to a few possibilities. However, the specific pattern, leaf shape, and shrub-like appearance strongly point to the species *Debregeasia hedyosma*. This plant is sometimes known by common names like Netted-Leaf False Nettle. A comparison with verified images of *Debregeasia hedyosma* confirms the identification.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the native range of the identified plant.**\nNow that the plant has been identified as *Debregeasia hedyosma*, the next step is to find out its geographical origin. The question specifically asks for the island to which it is endemic. The term \"endemic\" means that the plant is native exclusively to that specific place and is not found naturally anywhere else in the world.\n\n**Step 4: Find the endemic location.**\nConsulting reliable botanical resources such as Plants of the World Online (managed by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew), academic botanical databases, and encyclopedias reveals the native distribution of *Debregeasia hedyosma*. These sources consistently state that *Debregeasia hedyosma* is a species endemic to Taiwan.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the answer.**\nBased on the identification of the plant as *Debregeasia hedyosma* and the confirmed information about its native habitat, the island to which this plant is endemic is Taiwan.\n\n<<<Taiwan>>>"
