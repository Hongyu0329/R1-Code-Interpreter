    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure**\n    The graph displays Google Trends data for three different search terms (represented by red, blue, and yellow lines) over a period from December 2019 to late 2023. The y-axis represents relative search interest, and the x-axis represents time. The most crucial observation is that all three lines exhibit sharp, regularly spaced peaks. This pattern strongly suggests that the search terms are related to annual events, such as holidays or anniversaries, which see a surge in public interest at the same time each year.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the Timing of the Annual Peaks**\n    By examining the x-axis, we can determine when these annual peaks occur for each color.\n    *   **Red Line:** The red line consistently peaks every year in late January. We can see prominent spikes around late January 2020, late January 2021, late January 2022, and late January 2023.\n    *   **Blue Line:** The blue line shows smaller but consistent peaks every year around late May or very early June. This pattern is visible in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.\n    *   **Yellow Line:** The yellow line has strong peaks that occur every year in mid-October. We can see this pattern in October 2020, October 2021, October 2022, and a peak reaching the maximum value of 100 after May 2023, which would correspond to October 2023.\n\n*   **Step 3: Correlate Peak Timings with National Historic Events/Holidays**\n    The task is to find a single country that has significant historic events or national commemorations matching this annual schedule: late January, late May/early June, and mid-October.\n    Let's consider major countries and their national holidays:\n    *   **United Kingdom:** Has a bank holiday in late May, but lacks major national holidays in late January or mid-October.\n    *   **Canada:** Has Victoria Day in late May and Thanksgiving in October, but no major national holiday in late January.\n    *   **Australia:** Has Australia Day on January 26th, which is a perfect match for the red line. It has Reconciliation Week in late May/early June, which could match the blue line. However, it lacks a major, single national historic event or holiday in mid-October.\n    *   **United States:** Let's check the US federal holidays.\n        *   **Late January (Red Line):** Martin Luther King Jr. Day is celebrated on the third Monday of January. This fits the timing of the red peaks perfectly.\n        *   **Late May (Blue Line):** Memorial Day is observed on the last Monday of May. This aligns perfectly with the timing of the blue peaks.\n        *   **Mid-October (Yellow Line):** Columbus Day is a federal holiday on the second Monday of October. This date is also increasingly recognized as Indigenous Peoples' Day, generating significant discussion and search interest. This fits the timing of the yellow peaks perfectly.\n\n*   **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n    The United States is the only country that has three major, nationally recognized historic commemorations that fall exactly in late January, late May, and mid-October. A historian would recognize this pattern as corresponding to Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Memorial Day, and Columbus Day/Indigenous Peoples' Day. Therefore, the country in question is the United States.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
