**Product A:**
The structure is 1-(1-(pent-3-enoyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid.
A pyrrolidine ring has a carboxylic acid group at the 2-position. The nitrogen of this pyrrolidine ring (N-1) is bonded to the C-2' carbon of a 4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrole ring. This C-2' carbon is double bonded to the N-1' nitrogen of the second ring. The N-1' nitrogen is acylated with a pent-3-enoyl group (-CO-CH2-CH=CH-CH3).
 

**Product B:**
The structure is 1-(1-propioloyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid.
Similar to product A, but the acyl group on the N-1' nitrogen is a propioloyl group (-CO-Câ‰¡CH).
 

**Product C:**
The structure is 1-(1-acetyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid.
Similar to product A, but the acyl group on the N-1' nitrogen is an acetyl group (-CO-CH3).
