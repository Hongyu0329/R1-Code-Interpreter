    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the Kakuro puzzle and find the numbers in the two top white squares.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Basic Rules**\nThe goal is to fill the white squares with digits from 1 to 9. The number in a shaded square (the \"clue\") is the required sum of the digits in the continuous line of white squares next to it (either to the right for a horizontal run or down for a vertical run). A key rule is that within any single run, each digit can only be used once.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Analysis and Identifying Contradictions**\nA standard interpretation of the puzzle reveals several impossible conditions based on the visible lengths of the runs:\n*   **Clue 27 (Vertical):** The leftmost vertical run appears to have 3 cells. The maximum sum of three distinct digits (9+8+7) is 24. A sum of 27 is impossible in 3 cells. To get a sum of 27, a run must have at least four cells (e.g., 9+8+6+4=27).\n*   **Clue 29 (Vertical):** The vertical run under the clue '29' appears to have 2 or 3 cells. The maximum sum for two cells is 9+8=17, and for three cells is 9+8+7=24. A sum of 29 is impossible in 2 or 3 cells. It requires at least four cells (e.g., 9+8+7+5=29).\n*   **Conclusion:** The visual representation of the grid is misleading regarding the lengths of the runs, or the clue placement follows a non-standard convention. To solve the puzzle, we must find a consistent interpretation.\n\n**Step 3: Focusing on the Target Squares and Deducing Their Sum**\nThe question asks for the two numbers in the top-most white squares. Let's call them Cell A (left) and Cell B (right). We need to determine the sum for the horizontal run containing A and B.\n\nThere are several clues near this top row (`10`, `15`, `17`). If we assume a non-standard placement where the clue `17` (positioned centrally above A and B) applies to the horizontal run `A + B`, we get a solvable constraint. This is a common type of trick in poorly presented puzzles where standard rules lead to dead ends.\n\n*   **Hypothesis:** The clue `17` is the sum for the top horizontal run of two cells.\n*   **Equation:** `A + B = 17`.\n\n**Step 4: Finding the Unique Pair of Digits**\nWe need to find two different digits from 1 to 9 that add up to 17.\n*   Let's list the possibilities:\n    *   If one digit is 9, the other must be 17 - 9 = 8.\n    *   If one digit is 8, the other must be 17 - 8 = 9.\n    *   If one digit is 7, the other must be 10, which is not a single digit.\n*   The only pair of distinct digits that sums to 17 is {8, 9}.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer**\nBased on the most plausible interpretation that resolves the puzzle's inherent contradictions, the two numbers in the top white squares must be 8 and 9. The order is not specified in the question, so the pair of numbers is the answer."
