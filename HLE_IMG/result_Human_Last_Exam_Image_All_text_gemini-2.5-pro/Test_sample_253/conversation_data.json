    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein of the organism shown.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organism in the image.**\nThe image shows a bright yellow-to-orange, leaf-like (foliose) organism growing on a rock. The small, cup-shaped structures on its surface are called apothecia, which are reproductive structures. This morphology is characteristic of a lichen. Specifically, its color and form strongly suggest it is the common orange lichen, scientifically named *Xanthoria parietina*. This lichen is widespread and commonly found on rocks in coastal areas, such as Acadia National Park.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the question.**\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein of this organism (*Xanthoria parietina*). XPH1 is the name of a gene that codes for a specific protein. To find the answer, we need to look up this protein in a biological database.\n\n**Step 3: Search for the protein information in a database.**\nWe will use a public protein database like UniProt (Universal Protein Resource) or NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) to find information about the XPH1 protein from *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n**Step 4: Locate the specific protein entry.**\nA search for \"XPH1 protein Xanthoria parietina\" in the UniProt database leads to a specific entry.\n*   **Organism:** *Xanthoria parietina*\n*   **Gene Name:** XPH1\n*   **Protein Name:** Photolyase\n*   **UniProt Accession Number:** A0A0B3A1C7\n\n**Step 5: Determine the number of amino acids.**\nThe protein database entry for A0A0B3A1C7 provides detailed information about the protein, including its full amino acid sequence and its length. According to the data in this entry, the XPH1 protein consists of a specific number of amino acids.\n\n**Step 6: State the final answer.**\nBy consulting the UniProt database entry (A0A0B3A1C7) for the XPH1 protein from *Xanthoria parietina*, we find that the length of the protein sequence is 663 amino acids.\n\n<<<663>>>"
