    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral centers and determine the IUPAC name.**\nFirst, we need to identify all stereocenters, which are carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. In this molecule, there are three such centers. To refer to them unambiguously, we will determine the IUPAC name of the molecule.\n\n1.  **Principal Functional Group**: The molecule contains an alcohol (-OH) group and an amine (-NH2) group. According to IUPAC rules, the alcohol has higher priority.\n2.  **Parent Chain**: We must find the longest carbon chain that includes the carbon atom bearing the -OH group. The longest such chain has 5 carbon atoms. Therefore, the parent name is based on pentanol.\n3.  **Numbering the Chain**: We number the chain from the end that gives the carbon with the -OH group the lowest possible number.\n    *   Numbering from the left methyl group gives the -OH group position 2.\n    *   Numbering from the aminomethyl group end would place the -OH at position 4.\n    *   Therefore, we number from left to right as depicted in the annotated structure below.\n\n    *   The IUPAC name is **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**.\n4.  **Locating Chiral Centers**: The chiral centers are at positions C2, C3, and C4.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the absolute configuration (R/S) for each chiral center.**\n\n**Configuration at C2:**\n1.  **Assign Priorities**: The groups attached to C2 are -OH, -CH3, -H, and the C3-containing group. Using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules:\n    *   Priority 1: -OH (oxygen has the highest atomic number)\n    *   Priority 2: -C3H(Et)C4H(Me)CH2NH2 (the carbon at C3 is bonded to two other carbons)\n    *   Priority 3: -CH3 (the carbon is bonded only to hydrogens)\n    *   Priority 4: -H (hydrogen has the lowest atomic number)\n2.  **Determine Spatial Arrangement**: The drawing shows the C2-C3 bond as a solid line (in the plane). The -OH and -CH3 groups are both shown with dashed bonds (going away from the viewer). For a tetrahedral carbon, this means the fourth substituent, the implicit -H, must be on a wedged bond (coming towards the viewer).\n3.  **Assign R/S**: The lowest priority group (-H) is pointing towards the viewer. We determine the direction of the sequence from priority 1 to 2 to 3.\n    *   1 (-OH, back) → 2 (-C3, plane) → 3 (-CH3, back).\n    *   Visualizing this from the front (where the H atom is), the sequence traces a clockwise (R) path.\n    *   Because the lowest priority group is in the front, we must reverse the designation.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at **C2 is S**.\n\n**Configuration at C3:**\n1.  **Assign Priorities**: The groups attached to C3 are -H, -CH2CH3 (ethyl), the C2-containing group, and the C4-containing group.\n    *   Priority 1: -C2H(OH)CH3 (the carbon at C2 is bonded to an oxygen)\n    *   Priority 2: -C4H(CH3)CH2NH2 (the carbon at C4 is bonded to two carbons)\n    *   Priority 3: -CH2CH3 (the ethyl carbon is bonded to one carbon)\n    *   Priority 4: -H\n2.  **Determine Spatial Arrangement**: The C2-C3 and C3-C4 bonds are in the plane. The ethyl group is wedged (front). This means the implicit -H atom is dashed (back).\n3.  **Assign R/S**: The lowest priority group (-H) is in the back. We can directly read the configuration from the sequence 1 → 2 → 3.\n    *   1 (left) → 2 (right) → 3 (front).\n    *   This traces a clockwise path.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at **C3 is R**.\n\n**Configuration at C4:**\n1.  **Assign Priorities**: The groups attached to C4 are -H, -CH3, -CH2NH2, and the C3-containing group.\n    *   Priority 1: -CH2NH2 (the carbon is bonded to nitrogen, which has a higher atomic number than carbon)\n    *   Priority 2: -C3H(Et)... (the carbon at C3 is bonded to two other carbons)\n    *   Priority 3: -CH3 (the carbon is bonded only to hydrogens)\n    *   Priority 4: -H\n2.  **Determine Spatial Arrangement**: The C4-C3 bond is in the plane. The -CH2NH2 group is wedged (front), and the -CH3 group is dashed (back). This implies the implicit -H atom is in the plane.\n3.  **Assign R/S**: The lowest priority group (-H) is in the plane. We can use the \"swap\" method. Let's swap the position of the -H group (priority 4) with the group in the back, which is -CH3 (priority 3).\n    *   After the swap, -H is in the back. The sequence of the remaining groups is 1 (-CH2NH2, front) → 2 (-C3, plane) → 3 (-CH3, now in the plane).\n    *   This path traces a counter-clockwise (S) direction.\n    *   Since we performed one swap, the true configuration is the opposite.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at **C4 is R**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy combining the configurations of all chiral centers, the absolute configuration of the molecule is (2S, 3R, 4R).\n\n<<(2S, 3R, 4R)>>"
