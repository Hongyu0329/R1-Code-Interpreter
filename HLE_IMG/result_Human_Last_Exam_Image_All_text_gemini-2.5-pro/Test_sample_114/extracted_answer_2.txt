The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 arises because the reaction proceeds via an asymmetric azomethine ylide intermediate. The results from Reactions 1 and 2 are crucial for establishing this mechanistic pathway. The isotopic labeling study in Reaction 2 demonstrates that for the acyclic substrate, a symmetric azomethine ylide is formed (via decarboxylation of a MÃ¼nchnone), which explains the lack of regioselectivity with respect to the positions of the two methyl groups. Applying this mechanism to Reaction 3, the cyclic nature of the N-acetyl-proline starting material leads to the formation of an inherently asymmetric cyclic azomethine ylide. The subsequent [3+2] cycloaddition of this asymmetric dipole with the asymmetric alkyne (methyl propiolate) is highly regioselective due to favorable electronic and steric interactions in the transition state, resulting in the formation of a single product, Product B.
