    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Key Signature**\nThe first step is to establish the key of the piece. The key signature shows three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). This corresponds to the key of E♭ major or its relative minor, C minor. The \"Pathetique\" Sonata is famously in C minor. This is the tonic key for our analysis.\n\n**Step 2: Locate Measure 30**\nThe provided sheet music has measure numbers indicated. We can see measure 28 marked at the beginning of the second system. Counting forward, measure 30 is the third measure on that line, which is the measure circled in the image.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Notes in Measure 30**\nNext, we identify all the notes that sound together in measure 30 to determine the chord.\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays a single note on the first beat: G3.\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The right hand plays a pattern. On the first beat, it plays G5 and B♮4. On the second beat, it plays D5 and F♯4.\n\nCombining all the notes present in the measure, we have the pitch collection: **G, B♮, D, F♯**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Chord and its Function**\nNow we analyze this collection of notes to determine the chord's root, quality, and function within the key of C minor.\n\n*   **Root:** The bass note is G, which is the fifth scale degree (the dominant) of C minor. The notes G, B♮, and D form a G major triad. In harmonic analysis, the chord is most often identified by its bass note, especially when it is a primary scale degree like the dominant. Therefore, the root of the chord is G.\n*   **Function:** In the key of C minor, a chord built on G functions as the dominant. The dominant chord's primary role is to create tension that resolves to the tonic (C minor). Looking at the music, measure 30 is preceded by a C minor chord (i in first inversion) in measure 29 and is followed by a C minor chord (i in root position) in measure 31. This confirms the chord in measure 30 has a dominant function, leading back to the tonic.\n*   **Quality:** The core of the chord is G-B♮-D, which is a G major triad. In a minor key, it is standard practice to raise the seventh scale degree (B♭ to B♮ in C minor) to create a leading tone that pulls strongly to the tonic. This makes the dominant chord major. So, we have a major dominant triad, represented by a capital Roman numeral: **V**.\n*   **The Chromatic Note (F♯):** The F♯ is a chromatic alteration. It is the raised fourth scale degree of C minor (♯^4). In this context, F♯ functions as a leading tone *to the dominant itself* (F♯ resolves to G). This is a common chromaticism used to intensify the dominant chord before it resolves. While this note adds color and tension, it does not change the chord's fundamental function as the dominant (V). In standard Roman numeral analysis, such chromatic alterations are often treated as non-chord tones, and the primary function of the chord is what is labeled.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Roman Numeral**\nBased on the analysis:\n*   The chord is built on G, the fifth degree of C minor.\n*   It has a dominant function, resolving to the tonic.\n*   It is a major triad (G-B♮-D).\n*   It is in root position (G is in the bass).\n\nTherefore, the correct Roman numeral for the harmony in measure 30 is **V**.\n\n<<<V>>>"
