    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency of the circuit at node $a_0$. The circuit consists of an infinite resistive ladder network connected to a capacitor $C$. The node $a_0$ is the point where the capacitor is connected to the ladder. This configuration acts as a low-pass filter.\n\n**2. Identify the Circuit Model for Cutoff Frequency**\nThe cutoff frequency of an RC filter is determined by the resistance and capacitance. For a complex network connected to a capacitor, we need to find the Thévenin equivalent circuit as seen by the capacitor. The Thévenin circuit consists of a Thévenin voltage source $V_{th}$ and a Thévenin resistance $R_{th}$.\nThe circuit at node $a_0$ is equivalent to this Thévenin circuit connected to the capacitor $C$. The transfer function of this simple RC low-pass filter has a pole that determines the cutoff frequency. The angular cutoff frequency, $\\omega_c$, is given by:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C}$\n\nThe main task is to calculate the Thévenin resistance, $R_{th}$, seen from the terminals of the capacitor (i.e., between node $a_0$ and ground).\n\n**3. Calculate the Thévenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we must turn off all independent sources in the network. The input `IN` is at node $c_0$. Assuming it is a voltage source, we turn it off by connecting node $c_0$ to ground. The other terminal of the capacitor, $b_0$, is already connected to ground.\nSo, $R_{th}$ is the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground, with node $c_0$ also held at ground potential.\n\n**4. Analyze the Infinite Ladder Network**\nThe circuit is an infinite ladder. Let's denote the nodes on the top rail as $c_0, c_1, c_2, \\dots$ and the nodes on the bottom rail as $d_0, d_1, d_2, \\dots$. From the diagram, node $a_0$ is the same as node $d_0$.\nThe resistors are connected as follows:\n*   Vertical rail resistors: between $c_n$ and $c_{n+1}$ for $n \\ge 0$.\n*   Vertical rail resistors: between $d_n$ and $d_{n+1}$ for $n \\ge 0$.\n*   Horizontal rung resistors: between $c_n$ and $d_n$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nWe can solve for the resistance by analyzing the voltages at the nodes. Let's apply a test voltage $V_{d0}$ at node $d_0$ and calculate the current $I_{d0}$ flowing into it. Then $R_{th} = V_{d0} / I_{d0}$.\nThe boundary conditions are: $V_{d0}$ is the test voltage, and $V_{c0} = 0$ (grounded).\n\n**5. Set up and Solve the Recurrence Relations**\nUsing Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at nodes $c_n$ and $d_n$ for $n \\ge 1$:\nKCL at $c_n$: $\\frac{V_{cn} - V_{c,n-1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{cn} - V_{c,n+1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{cn} - V_{dn}}{r} = 0 \\implies V_{c,n+1} + V_{c,n-1} - 3V_{cn} + V_{dn} = 0$\nKCL at $d_n$: $\\frac{V_{dn} - V_{d,n-1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{dn} - V_{d,n+1}}{r} + \\frac{V_{dn} - V_{cn}}{r} = 0 \\implies V_{d,n+1} + V_{d,n-1} - 3V_{dn} + V_{cn} = 0$\n\nTo solve this system, we define symmetric and anti-symmetric components:\n$S_n = V_{cn} + V_{dn}$\n$D_n = V_{cn} - V_{dn}$\n\nAdding the two KCL equations gives a recurrence for $S_n$:\n$S_{n+1} + S_{n-1} - 2S_n = 0$\nThe solution is an arithmetic progression: $S_n = A + Bn$.\n\nSubtracting the second KCL equation from the first gives a recurrence for $D_n$:\n$D_{n+1} + D_{n-1} - 4D_n = 0$\nThe characteristic equation is $x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0$, with roots $x = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}$. The general solution is $D_n = C(2-\\sqrt{3})^n + E(2+\\sqrt{3})^n$.\n\n**6. Apply Boundary Conditions**\nFor the ladder extending to infinity, the voltages must remain bounded. This requires $B=0$ and $E=0$. Let $k = 2-\\sqrt{3}$.\nSo, $S_n = A$ and $D_n = Ck^n$.\n\nNow, we apply the conditions at $n=0$:\n*   $V_{c0} = 0$\n*   $V_{d0}$ is the test voltage.\n\n$S_0 = V_{c0} + V_{d0} = 0 + V_{d0} = V_{d0}$. Since $S_n = A$ for all $n$, we have $A=V_{d0}$.\n$D_0 = V_{c0} - V_{d0} = 0 - V_{d0} = -V_{d0}$. Since $D_n = Ck^n$, for $n=0$, $D_0 = Ck^0 = C$. So, $C = -V_{d0}$.\n\nThe solutions for the voltages are:\n$V_{cn} = \\frac{S_n + D_n}{2} = \\frac{V_{d0} - V_{d0}k^n}{2} = \\frac{V_{d0}}{2}(1-k^n)$\n$V_{dn} = \\frac{S_n - D_n}{2} = \\frac{V_{d0} + V_{d0}k^n}{2} = \\frac{V_{d0}}{2}(1+k^n)$\n\n**7. Calculate the Input Current and Resistance**\nThe current $I_{d0}$ flowing from the test source into node $d_0$ is determined by the potential difference across the resistor between $d_0$ and $d_1$:\n$I_{d0} = \\frac{V_{d0} - V_{d1}}{r}$\nWe find $V_{d1}$ using our solution for $V_{dn}$ with $n=1$:\n$V_{d1} = \\frac{V_{d0}}{2}(1+k^1) = \\frac{V_{d0}}{2}(1+k)$\nSubstitute this into the expression for $I_{d0}$:\n$I_{d0} = \\frac{1}{r} \\left( V_{d0} - \\frac{V_{d0}}{2}(1+k) \\right) = \\frac{V_{d0}}{r} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1+k}{2} \\right) = \\frac{V_{d0}}{r} \\left( \\frac{2-1-k}{2} \\right) = \\frac{V_{d0}}{2r}(1-k)$\n\nNow, we can find $R_{th}$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{V_{d0}}{I_{d0}} = \\frac{V_{d0}}{\\frac{V_{d0}}{2r}(1-k)} = \\frac{2r}{1-k}$\nSubstitute $k = 2-\\sqrt{3}$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r}{1 - (2-\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3}-1}$\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and denominator by $(\\sqrt{3}+1)$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{(\\sqrt{3}-1)(\\sqrt{3}+1)} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{3-1} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{2} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$\n\n**8. Determine the Cutoff Frequency**\nNow that we have the Thévenin resistance, we can find the angular cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(1+\\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThis is the final expression for the cutoff frequency. It can also be written with a rationalized numerator:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{r(1+\\sqrt{3})C} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{3}-1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{rC(3-1)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{2rC}$\nBoth forms are equivalent. We will provide the first form as it directly shows the dependence on $R_{th}$.\n\n<<<1/(rC(1+sqrt(3)))>>>"
