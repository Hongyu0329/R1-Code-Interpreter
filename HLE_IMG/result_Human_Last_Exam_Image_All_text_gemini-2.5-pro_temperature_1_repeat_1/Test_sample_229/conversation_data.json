    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Sheet Music:** The provided image is a piece of handwritten sheet music, specifically a lead sheet. It contains the melody line on a single staff and chord symbols written above it.\n2.  **Identify Musical Elements:**\n    *   **Time Signature:** The piece is in 4/4 time, as indicated by the 'C' symbol (common time) after the treble clef.\n    *   **Key Signature:** There are no sharps or flats in the key signature, which, combined with the prominent C major chords throughout the piece, indicates the key is C major.\n    *   **Tempo:** At the very top, though partially cut off, a tempo marking is visible. It appears to say \"Mod. Swing,\" indicating a moderate swing tempo for this particular arrangement.\n    *   **Chords:** The chord progression includes C, E7, F, G7, C-, D-, and A-. The use of a secondary dominant (E7, the V7 of A minor) and the syncopated, chromatic melody are hallmarks of jazz and related styles.\n    *   **Melody:** The melody is highly syncopated and features a distinctive, recognizable pattern. The first full measure of the main theme starts with the notes C-C-E-G | A-A-G.\n    *   **Structure:** The music uses standard notation for form, including repeat signs, a segno sign (the S-like symbol), and instructions \"To Go Out - Take D.S. to Coda,\" which directs the performer to go back to the segno sign and then jump to the Coda section to end the piece.\n3.  **Identify the Song:**\n    *   The combination of the distinctive opening melody (C-C-E-G | A-A-G) and the chord progression (starting with C | E7 | F...) strongly points to a specific, well-known song.\n    *   A search for this melody and chord progression identifies the song as **\"Tico-Tico no Fub치\"**. The title translates from Portuguese to \"Sparrow in the Cornmeal.\" It is often known in English simply as \"Tico-Tico.\"\n4.  **Determine the Musical Style:**\n    *   \"Tico-Tico no Fub치\" was composed by Zequinha de Abreu in 1917.\n    *   The original and primary musical style of the piece is **Choro**. Choro is a lively, rhythmic, and virtuosic instrumental music genre from Brazil, often considered a precursor to Samba and Bossa Nova. While it's frequently performed in Latin jazz, samba, and swing styles (as the tempo marking suggests for this arrangement), its foundational genre is Choro.\n5.  **Determine the Country of Origin:**\n    *   The composer, Zequinha de Abreu, was Brazilian. The song is one of the most famous examples of the Choro genre.\n    *   Therefore, the country of origin is **Brazil**.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   The sheet music is a handwritten arrangement, not the original published score. The tempo marking \"Mod. Swing\" applies to this specific jazz-influenced arrangement, not necessarily the original Choro composition, which is typically played at a very fast tempo (Chorinho).\n    *   It's important to distinguish between the song's original style and the style of a particular performance or arrangement. The question asks for the song's musical style, so its native genre (Choro) is the most accurate answer.\n    *   The chords and melody are the most reliable identifiers, as they remain consistent across different arrangements.\n\n*   **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    *   **Title:** Tico-Tico no Fub치\n    *   **Musical Style:** Choro (a Brazilian instrumental genre)\n    *   **Country of Origin:** Brazil\n\n<<<Title: Tico-Tico no Fub치; Musical Style: Choro; Country of Origin: Brazil>>>"
