The products A, B, and C are formed through three competing reaction pathways:
*   **Product A (C14H20N2O3):** Results from a sequence of decarboxylation of the starting material, N-acetylation of the proline nitrogen, and subsequent Michael addition of the enamine tautomer of the remaining pyrroline ring to methyl propiolate.
*   **Product B (C12H14N2O3):** Arises from the Michael addition of the enamine nitrogen of the starting material to methyl propiolate, followed by an intramolecular cyclization where the proline's secondary amine attacks the newly formed ester, creating a tricyclic lactam with the elimination of methanol.
*   **Product C (C11H16N2O3):** Is the simple N-acetylation product of the starting material, where the secondary amine of the proline ring reacts with acetic anhydride.
