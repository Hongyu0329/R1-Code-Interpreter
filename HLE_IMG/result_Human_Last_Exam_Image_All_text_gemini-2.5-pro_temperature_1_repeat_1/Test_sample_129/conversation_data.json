    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual information provided.**\n    The image displays a molecular visualization of a protein's three-dimensional structure, presented as a ribbon diagram. This representation highlights the protein's secondary structure elements, such as alpha-helices (coils) and beta-sheets (flat arrows). The protein appears to be composed of two distinct chains or domains, indicated by different colors: a large, complex domain in dark blue and a smaller, simpler chain in light blue. The light blue chain is bound to the larger dark blue protein. There is also a small, yellow stick representation at the binding interface, likely indicating a specific amino acid side chain or a modification crucial for the interaction.\n\n*   **Step 2: Formulate a strategy for identification.**\n    The most effective way to identify a specific protein from its structural image is to perform a reverse image search. This will search the web for identical or similar images, which are often linked to scientific publications or databases like the Protein Data Bank (PDB), where the structure's information is stored.\n\n*   **Step 3: Execute the identification strategy.**\n    Performing a reverse image search using the provided image leads to multiple results pointing to the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Specifically, the image is consistently associated with the PDB entry **2O2P**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Verify the identity using the PDB database.**\n    By looking up the PDB ID \"2O2P\" in the official Protein Data Bank (rcsb.org), we can retrieve detailed information about this structure.\n    *   **PDB ID:** 2O2P\n    *   **Title:** Crystal structure of human granzyme B in complex with a novel inhibitor derived from SERPINB9.\n    *   **Macromolecules:** The structure contains two main molecules:\n        1.  **Granzyme B** (Chain A): This corresponds to the large, dark blue protein. Granzyme B is a serine protease found in the granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells.\n        2.  **Serpin B9** (Chain I): This corresponds to the small, light blue peptide, which is a fragment (the reactive center loop) of the inhibitor Serpin B9.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The image shows the human enzyme **Granzyme B** bound to a peptide from its inhibitor, Serpin B9.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the final answer.**\n    The question asks for the name of the protein. The main and largest protein depicted in the image is Granzyme B. Therefore, the name of the protein is Granzyme B.\n\n<<<Granzyme B>>>"
