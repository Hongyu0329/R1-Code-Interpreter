    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Structure:** The image displays a cationic Iridium(III) complex. The central Iridium ion (Ir³⁺) is octahedrally coordinated by three bidentate ligands. The overall charge is +1.\n\n2.  **Identify the Ligands and their Coordination:**\n    *   **Ligand 1 (A-B):** This is a cyclometalated ligand. The pyridine ring (B) coordinates to Ir through its nitrogen atom (N). The phenyl ring (A) is bonded to Ir through a carbon atom (C1, not explicitly numbered but is the carbon of ring A bonded to C2 of ring B), forming a C-Ir bond. This is a common type of ligand called a phenylpyridine (ppy).\n    *   **Ligand 2 (C-D):** This is another cyclometalated phenylpyridine ligand, identical in its coordination mode to ligand A-B. Pyridine ring D coordinates via nitrogen, and phenyl ring C coordinates via carbon.\n    *   **Ligand 3 (E-F):** This is a 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy) ligand. Both pyridine rings (E and F) coordinate to the Ir center through their nitrogen atoms.\n\n3.  **Define \"Free Rotation\":** Free rotation refers to the ability of a group (here, a phenyl ring) to rotate around the single C-C bond that connects it to the main molecular scaffold. This rotation is considered \"free\" if the energy barrier is low. The main factor that can prevent free rotation is steric hindrance, where the rotating group would physically clash with other parts of the molecule.\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Phenyl Ring in Question (G, J, L, K, H):**\n\n    *   **Rings H and J:**\n        *   Ring H is attached to C4 of phenyl ring A.\n        *   Ring J is attached to C4 of phenyl ring C.\n        *   The C4 position on these phenyl rings (A and C) is analogous to a *para* position. It points directly away from the central, crowded Iridium coordination sphere. There are no bulky groups nearby to impede rotation around the C-C single bond.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Rings **H** and **J** can rotate freely.\n\n    *   **Rings K and L:**\n        *   Ring K is attached to C6 of phenyl ring A.\n        *   Ring L is attached to C6 of phenyl ring C.\n        *   The C6 position on the cyclometalated phenyl ring is *ortho* to the carbon atom (C1) that is directly bonded to the Iridium center. This places the substituent (rings K and L) extremely close to the other ligands surrounding the Ir atom.\n        *   As ring K attempts to rotate, it would sweep through the space occupied by the bipyridine ligand, specifically clashing with ring E.\n        *   Similarly, rotation of ring L would cause a severe steric clash with ring F of the bipyridine ligand.\n        *   The dotted lines shown in the diagram from C6 of rings A and C towards the Ir center are often used to indicate this severe steric crowding and the resulting restriction of motion (and possibly a weak C-H···Ir interaction, known as an agostic interaction, which would further lock the ring in place).\n        *   **Conclusion:** Rings **K** and **L** cannot rotate freely due to severe steric hindrance.\n\n    *   **Ring G:**\n        *   Ring G is attached to C6 of the pyridine ring F, which is part of the bipyridine ligand.\n        *   This C6 position is *ortho* to the coordinating nitrogen atom. While ortho substituents can experience some steric hindrance from the adjacent C-H group on the ring (at C5), this is typically not enough to completely prevent rotation.\n        *   Crucially, this position is on the \"outer edge\" of the bipyridine ligand, pointing away from the most congested part of the complex where the three ligands meet. Compared to the environment of rings K and L, ring G is in a much less crowded space.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Ring **G** can rotate freely.\n\n5.  **Final Summary:**\n    *   Rings that can rotate freely: **G, J, H**\n    *   Rings with restricted rotation: **K, L**\n\n6.  **Match with Answer Choices:** The set of rings that can rotate freely is {G, J, H}. This corresponds to answer choice E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
