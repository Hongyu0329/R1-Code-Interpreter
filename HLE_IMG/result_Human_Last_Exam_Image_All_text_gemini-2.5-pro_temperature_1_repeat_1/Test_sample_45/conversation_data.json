    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the rotational symmetry of the provided tiling:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling pattern shown in the image. Rotational symmetry refers to the property of a shape or pattern looking the same after being rotated by a certain angle less than 360 degrees. The \"order\" of rotational symmetry is the number of times the pattern matches its original orientation in a full 360-degree rotation.\n\n2.  **Examine the Tiling's Structure:** The tiling is a periodic pattern made up of repeating geometric shapes. We can identify three distinct shapes:\n    *   **Dark Blue Hexagons:** These appear to be regular hexagons.\n    *   **Sandy Yellow Squares:** These appear to be regular squares.\n    *   **Reddish-Orange Rhombi:** These are four-sided figures with equal side lengths but are not squares.\n\n3.  **Identify Potential Centers of Rotation:** To find the rotational symmetry, we must look for points in the pattern around which a rotation will leave the entire pattern unchanged. The most likely candidates for these centers are the geometric centers of the constituent polygons.\n\n4.  **Test the Center of a Blue Hexagon:**\n    *   Let's select the center of one of the dark blue hexagons as a potential rotation point.\n    *   A regular hexagon has 6-fold symmetry by itself. If we rotate the entire tiling by 360° / 6 = 60° around the center of a hexagon, we need to see if the whole pattern aligns.\n    *   Upon a 60° rotation, the central hexagon maps onto itself.\n    *   Each of the six surrounding motifs (composed of squares and rhombi) is rotated into the position of its neighbor. Since all these surrounding motifs are identical, the entire pattern looks exactly the same.\n    *   Therefore, the center of each blue hexagon is a point of **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n5.  **Test the Center of a Yellow Square (for completeness):**\n    *   Let's select the center of one of the sandy yellow squares.\n    *   A square has 4-fold symmetry. If we rotate the tiling by 360° / 4 = 90° around this point, the central square maps onto itself.\n    *   The surrounding shapes (four rhombi and the corners of four hexagons) also map onto identical neighboring positions.\n    *   Therefore, the center of each yellow square is a point of **4-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n6.  **Determine the Overall Rotational Symmetry of the Tiling:** When a tiling has multiple types of rotation centers, its overall rotational symmetry is defined by the **highest order of rotation** present.\n    *   We have found centers of 6-fold rotation.\n    *   We have found centers of 4-fold rotation.\n    *   (There are also centers of 2-fold and 3-fold rotation at other locations, but these are of a lower order).\n    *   The highest order of rotation we have identified is 6.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** The tiling exhibits 6-fold rotational symmetry. This means the entire pattern can be rotated by 60 degrees about the centers of the blue hexagons, and it will appear identical to its original state.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
