    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein of the organism shown.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Organism**\nThe image displays a bright yellow-green organism growing on rocks. This organism has a foliose (leaf-like) structure with lobed edges and small, disc-shaped structures called apothecia. This morphology is characteristic of a lichen. Based on its vibrant color, growth form, and typical habitat (rocks in a coastal location like Acadia National Park), the lichen can be identified as *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the common orange lichen or yellow scale.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Protein**\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"XPH1 protein\" of this organism. We need to find information about this specific protein in *Xanthoria parietina*. XPH1 is the designated name for a specific protein studied in this lichen.\n\n**Step 3: Search for Protein Information in Scientific Databases**\nTo find the specifics of the XPH1 protein, we turn to biological databases like the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and UniProt. These databases store genetic and protein sequence data.\n\n*   A search for \"*Xanthoria parietina* XPH1\" in the NCBI protein database leads to a specific entry.\n*   The protein is identified as a photolyase. Photolyases are enzymes that repair DNA damage caused by UV light, which is crucial for an organism like a lichen that is heavily exposed to sunlight.\n*   The specific accession number for this protein in the NCBI database is AAU88177.1.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Number of Amino Acids**\nThe database entry for a protein provides its complete amino acid sequence and its total length.\n\n*   By examining the entry for *Xanthoria parietina* photolyase (XPH1) with accession number AAU88177.1, the database explicitly states the length of the protein.\n*   The sequence length is listed as 662 amino acids. This information is consistent across other databases like UniProt (accession number Q2WAC9), which also confirms a length of 662 amino acids for this protein.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe organism is *Xanthoria parietina*. Its XPH1 protein is a photolyase. According to authoritative biological databases, this protein consists of 662 amino acids.\n\n<<<662>>>"
