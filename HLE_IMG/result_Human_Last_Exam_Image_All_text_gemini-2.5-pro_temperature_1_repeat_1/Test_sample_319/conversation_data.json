    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided image to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Image**\nThe image consists of two parts, both representing a sound over time.\n*   **Top Graph (Spectrogram):** This graph shows the frequency content of a sound over time (time is on the horizontal axis, frequency on the vertical axis). We can see a thin, continuous horizontal line, indicating a pure tone of a constant frequency. In the middle, this line is interrupted by a thick, vertical smudge that covers a wide range of frequencies. This represents a short burst of broadband noise. After the noise, the original pure tone resumes. Physically, the sound consists of a tone, then noise, then the tone again.\n*   **Bottom Graph (Waveform):** This graph shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time. It starts as a regular, periodic sine wave, which corresponds to the pure tone. In the middle, the waveform becomes irregular and complex, corresponding to the noise. Afterwards, it returns to being a regular sine wave.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Question Text**\nThe text provides several crucial clues about the phenomenon:\n*   It is an **\"illusion.\"** This means that what is perceived is different from the physical reality of the stimulus.\n*   It is compared to the **\"Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity.\"** The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where a 2D drawing of a cube can be perceived in two different 3D orientations. The brain resolves the ambiguity by picking one stable perception at a time. This suggests the auditory phenomenon in question also involves the brain interpreting an ambiguous stimulus and settling on a coherent perception.\n*   It reveals a **\"surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability.\"** This indicates it's a fundamental process of our perceptual system that operates automatically to help us make sense of the world.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Clues**\nWhen a listener hears the sound depicted in the image (a tone interrupted by a burst of noise), the common perceptual experience is not of a tone that stops and then restarts. Instead, the listener perceives the tone as being continuous, as if it were playing uninterrupted *behind* the noise.\n\n*   **The Illusion:** The perception of continuity is the illusion because the tone is physically absent during the noise burst.\n*   **Resolving Ambiguity:** The brain is presented with an ambiguous situation. Did the tone stop exactly when the noise started and restart exactly when it ended (a less likely real-world event)? Or is a continuous tone being temporarily masked by a louder sound (a more common real-world event, like a car horn continuing as another car drives past)? The brain resolves this ambiguity by choosing the more plausible interpretation: continuity. This is analogous to the Necker Cube, where the brain chooses a plausible 3D structure.\n*   **Unconscious Ability:** This process of \"filling in\" the missing sound is not a conscious choice. The auditory system does it automatically, demonstrating a robust, built-in mechanism for maintaining perceptual continuity in a noisy world.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Name of the Phenomenon**\nThis perceptual \"filling-in\" of missing auditory information is a well-documented phenomenon in psychology and psychoacoustics.\n*   The general term for this is the **Auditory Continuity Illusion** or **Temporal Induction**.\n*   A very famous and specific example of this, discovered by researcher Richard Warren, involves replacing a phoneme (a basic sound unit of speech) in a sentence with a noise like a cough. Listeners not only perceive the sentence as uninterrupted but are often unable to even identify where the cough occurred. This specific version is called the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**.\n\nGiven that the Phonemic Restoration Effect is the most famous named example of this principle and is frequently used in textbooks to illustrate this exact concept (often using the simplified pure-tone example as shown in the image), it is the most likely answer. It perfectly captures the idea of \"restoring\" a missing perceptual element.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe image and description point to the perceptual phenomenon where the brain restores missing auditory information that has been replaced by noise, creating an illusion of continuity. The most famous name for this is the Phonemic Restoration Effect.\n\n<<<Phonemic restoration effect>>>"
