    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the image**\nThe image provided is an **emission spectrum**. This type of spectrum is produced when the atoms of an element are energized (for example, by heating them in a flame or passing an electric current through a gas). The energized electrons jump to higher energy levels and then fall back, emitting light at very specific wavelengths (colors). These specific wavelengths appear as bright colored lines against a dark background.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the key features of the spectrum**\nEach element has a unique pattern of spectral lines, which acts like a fingerprint. To identify the element, we need to look for characteristic patterns in the given spectrum.\n*   The spectrum covers the entire visible range of light, from violet/blue on the left to red on the right.\n*   There are many lines present, indicating a relatively complex spectrum.\n*   Let's examine the different color regions:\n    *   **Blue/Violet Region:** There are several distinct lines.\n    *   **Green/Cyan Region:** There are multiple lines, including some prominent ones in the green and blue-green (cyan) areas.\n    *   **Yellow/Orange Region:** There is a very distinct and extremely bright pair of lines that are very close together. This feature is known as a **doublet**. This is the most prominent feature of the entire spectrum.\n    *   **Red Region:** There are a few, less intense lines in the red part of the spectrum.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the observed features with known elemental spectra**\nThe most telling clue is the prominent yellow doublet. We can use this feature to narrow down the possibilities.\n\n*   **Hydrogen:** The visible spectrum of hydrogen (Balmer series) consists of four main lines: one red, one blue-green, and two violet lines. This does not match the complex pattern and the strong yellow doublet in the image.\n*   **Helium:** Helium has a bright yellow line, but it is a single line (~587.6 nm), not a strong, close doublet like the one seen in the image.\n*   **Neon:** Neon is famous for its bright red-orange glow and has a spectrum dominated by many lines in that region. The provided spectrum has strong lines across many colors, not just red-orange.\n*   **Sodium (Na):** Sodium is famous for producing an intense yellow-orange light. Its spectrum is characterized by a very strong, closely spaced doublet in the yellow part of the spectrum, known as the **Sodium D-lines** (at approximately 589.0 nm and 589.6 nm). This perfectly matches the most prominent feature in the image. While sodium has other, weaker lines in the green, blue, and red, the D-lines are its unmistakable signature.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the identification**\nThe presence of the intense, closely spaced yellow doublet is the definitive fingerprint of the element sodium. The other lines visible in the spectrum are also consistent with the known emission spectrum of sodium.\n\n<<<Sodium>>>"
