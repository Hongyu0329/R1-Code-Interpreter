    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the title and composer of the provided jazz standard:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Key and Time Signature**\n*   The key signature has four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭), which indicates the key of A♭ major or its relative minor, F minor.\n*   The first and last chord of the piece is F minor (indicated as F-), which strongly suggests the key is F minor.\n*   The time signature is 4/4, also known as common time.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Melody**\n*   The first few notes of the melody are a very distinct phrase. Starting with two eighth-note pickups, the melody is: C - C - A♭ - G - F - E♭ - D♭ - B♮ - C.\n*   This opening melodic line is highly recognizable.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Chord Progression**\n*   The chord progression is also very characteristic. Let's break it down by section (the form appears to be AABA).\n*   **A Section (First 8 bars):**\n    *   `F- | E-7♭5 | E♭-6 | D♭maj7 G7 |`\n    *   `C7 | F- | 1. C7 :|| 2. C7 | F- |`\n    *   This progression features a \"line cliché\" where a note descends chromatically within the chord changes (F -> E -> E♭ -> D♭). This is a hallmark of certain jazz tunes.\n*   **B Section (Bridge, bars 9-16):**\n    *   `D-7♭5 | G7 | C7 | F7 |`\n    *   `B♭-7 | E♭7 | A♭ | G C7 |`\n    *   This section consists of a series of ii-V-I related movements, modulating through different key centers before returning to F minor. For instance, `B♭-7` to `E♭7` to `A♭` is a classic ii-V-I in the key of A♭ major.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Clues and Identify the Song**\n*   The combination of the specific melodic phrase (C-C-A♭-G...) and the unique chord progression, especially the descending line cliché in the A section and the series of dominant chords in the bridge, points to a specific composition.\n*   These features are the defining characteristics of the jazz standard **\"Nica's Dream\"**.\n*   The composer of \"Nica's Dream\" is the renowned jazz pianist and composer **Horace Silver**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the melodic content, the distinctive chord progression, and the overall form, the piece of music is \"Nica's Dream\" composed by Horace Silver.\n\n<<<Title: Nica's Dream, Composer: Horace Silver>>>"
