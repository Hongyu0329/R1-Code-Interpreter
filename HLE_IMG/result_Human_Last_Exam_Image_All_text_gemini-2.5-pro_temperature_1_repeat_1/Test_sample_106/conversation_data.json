    "This problem describes the acid-catalyzed rearrangement of a triterpenoid, specifically friedelan-3β-ol, to germanicene (olean-13(18)-ene). This reaction is a classic example of a backbone rearrangement, involving a cascade of [1,2]-hydride and [1,2]-methyl shifts. We need to determine the identity (H or CH3) of the substituents at the labeled positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of the reaction mechanism:**\n\n1.  **Protonation and Dehydration:** The reaction is initiated by the protonation of the hydroxyl group (-OH) on C3 by the catalytic acid (HCl). This forms a good leaving group, water (H₂O). Loss of the water molecule generates a secondary carbocation at C3.\n\n2.  **Carbocation Rearrangement Cascade:** The secondary carbocation at C3 is unstable and initiates a series of [1,2]-shifts to form more stable tertiary carbocations, moving the positive charge across the carbon skeleton. This cascade is known as the Friedelin-Germanicene rearrangement. Let's trace the shifts and the movement of the methyl (Me) and hydrogen (H) groups. We will use the standard numbering for the friedelane skeleton to track the atoms.\n\n    *   **Initial Carbocation:** A positive charge is located at C3.\n\n    *   **Shift 1: [1,2]-Methyl Shift:** A methyl group from the adjacent C4 migrates to C3. This creates a new, more stable tertiary carbocation at C4.\n        *   *Result:* C3 now has a new methyl group. C4, which started with two methyl groups, now has one methyl group and a positive charge.\n\n    *   **Shift 2: [1,2]-Hydride Shift:** The hydrogen atom from C5 migrates to the carbocation at C4. This moves the positive charge to C5, forming another tertiary carbocation.\n        *   *Result:* C4 now has a hydrogen atom (from C5) and one methyl group. C5, which started with a hydrogen, now has a positive charge.\n\n    *   **Shift 3: [1,2]-Methyl Shift:** The methyl group from C10 migrates to the carbocation at C5. The positive charge moves to C10.\n        *   *Result:* C5 now has a methyl group (from C10). C10, which started with a methyl group, now has a positive charge.\n\n    *   **Shift 4: [1,2]-Hydride Shift:** The hydrogen atom from C9 migrates to the carbocation at C10. The positive charge moves to C9.\n        *   *Result:* C10 now has a hydrogen atom (from C9). C9, which started with a hydrogen, now has a positive charge.\n\n    *   **Shift 5: [1,2]-Methyl Shift:** The methyl group from C8 migrates to the carbocation at C9. The positive charge moves to C8.\n        *   *Result:* C9 now has a methyl group (from C8). C8, which started with a methyl group, now has a positive charge.\n\n    *   **Shift 6: [1,2]-Methyl Shift:** The methyl group from C14 migrates to the carbocation at C8. The positive charge moves to C14.\n        *   *Result:* C8 now has a methyl group (from C14). C14, which started with a methyl group, now has a positive charge.\n\n    *   **Shift 7: [1,2]-Methyl Shift:** The methyl group from C13 migrates to the carbocation at C14. The positive charge moves to C13.\n        *   *Result:* C14 now has a methyl group (from C13). C13, which started with a methyl group, now has a positive charge.\n\n3.  **Elimination:** The final carbocation at C13 is stabilized by elimination of a proton from an adjacent carbon. Loss of a proton from C18 forms the highly substituted and thermodynamically stable tetrasubstituted double bond between C13 and C18, yielding the final product, germanicene.\n\n**Determining the Substituents at Positions 1-5:**\n\nNow we map the results of the rearrangement to the labeled positions in the product. The numbers in the diagram point to the substituent groups themselves.\n\n*   **Position 1:** This substituent is on the carbon that was originally C4.\n    *   C4 started with two methyl groups.\n    *   It lost one methyl group (to C3) and gained one hydrogen (from C5).\n    *   Therefore, the final substituents on C4 are one methyl group and one hydrogen. The label \"1\" points to the methyl group.\n    *   **1 = CH3**\n\n*   **Position 2:** This substituent is on the carbon that was originally C10.\n    *   C10 started with one methyl group.\n    *   It lost its methyl group (to C5) and gained one hydrogen (from C9).\n    *   Therefore, the final substituent at this position is a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **2 = H**\n\n*   **Position 3:** This substituent is on the carbon that was originally C5.\n    *   C5 started with one hydrogen atom.\n    *   It lost its hydrogen (to C4) and gained one methyl group (from C10).\n    *   Therefore, the final substituent at this position is a methyl group.\n    *   **3 = CH3**\n\n*   **Position 4:** This substituent is on the carbon that was originally C8.\n    *   C8 started with one methyl group.\n    *   It lost its methyl group (to C9) and gained one methyl group (from C14).\n    *   Therefore, the final substituent at this position is a methyl group.\n    *   **4 = CH3**\n\n*   **Position 5:** This substituent is on the carbon that was originally C14.\n    *   C14 started with one methyl group.\n    *   It lost its methyl group (to C8) and gained one methyl group (from C13).\n    *   Therefore, the final substituent at this position is a methyl group.\n    *   **5 = CH3**\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the Friedelin-Germanicene rearrangement:\n*   Substituent 1 is CH3.\n*   Substituent 2 is H.\n*   Substituent 3 is CH3.\n*   Substituent 4 is CH3.\n*   Substituent 5 is CH3.\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = CH3>>>"
