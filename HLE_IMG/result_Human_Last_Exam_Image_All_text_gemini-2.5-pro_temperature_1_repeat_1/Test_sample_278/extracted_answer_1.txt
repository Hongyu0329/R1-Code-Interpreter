The image displays a dimorphic fungus, characterized by the presence of both oval, budding yeast cells and elongated filamentous structures known as pseudohyphae (distinguished by constrictions at the septa). This specific morphology, highlighted by a stain like PAS, is classic for an infection by a fungus of the genus *Candida*.
