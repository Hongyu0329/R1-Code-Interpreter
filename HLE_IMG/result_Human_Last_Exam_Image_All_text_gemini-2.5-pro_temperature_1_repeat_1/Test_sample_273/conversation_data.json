    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**1. Identify the Chiral Centers**\n\nA chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's number the carbons of the main backbone as drawn from left to right for easier reference.\n*   **C2:** The carbon atom bonded to the -OH group. It is attached to four different groups: -OH, -H (implied), -CH3, and the rest of the molecule (-C3...). Thus, C2 is a chiral center.\n*   **C3:** The carbon atom bonded to the ethyl group. It is attached to four different groups: -CH2CH3, -H (implied), the group on the left (-C2...), and the group on the right (-C4...). Thus, C3 is a chiral center.\n*   **C4:** The carbon atom bonded to the -CH3 and -CH2NH2 groups. It is attached to four different groups: -CH2NH2, -CH3, -H (implied), and the rest of the molecule (-C3...). Thus, C4 is a chiral center.\n\nThere are three chiral centers: C2, C3, and C4. We will determine the absolute configuration (R or S) for each using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n**2. Determine the Configuration of C3**\n\n*   **Assign priorities to groups attached to C3:**\n    1.  **-CH(OH)CH3 (group at C2):** The carbon is bonded to (O, C, H). Highest atomic number is O(8).\n    2.  **-CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (group at C4):** The carbon is bonded to (C, C, H).\n    3.  **-CH2CH3 (ethyl group):** The carbon is bonded to (C, H, H).\n    4.  **-H (hydrogen):** (Implied).\n    The priority order is: -C2 group (1) > -C4 group (2) > Ethyl group (3) > -H (4).\n*   **Determine R/S configuration:**\n    *   In the drawing, the C2-C3 and C3-C4 bonds are in the plane of the paper.\n    *   The ethyl group (priority 3) is on a solid wedge, meaning it points towards the viewer.\n    *   This implies the hydrogen atom (priority 4, the lowest priority group) is on a dashed wedge, pointing away from the viewer.\n    *   With the lowest priority group pointing away, we can trace the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3.\n    *   The path goes from the C2 group (up-left) → C4 group (down-right) → Ethyl group (up-right/front).\n    *   This is a **clockwise** rotation.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at **C3 is R**.\n\n**3. Determine the Configuration of C4**\n\n*   **Assign priorities to groups attached to C4:**\n    1.  **-CH2NH2 (aminoethyl group):** The carbon is bonded to (N, H, H). Highest atomic number is N(7).\n    2.  **-CH(Et)CH(OH)CH3 (group at C3):** The carbon is bonded to (C, C, H).\n    3.  **-CH3 (methyl group):** The carbon is bonded to (H, H, H).\n    4.  **-H (hydrogen):** (Implied).\n    The priority order is: -CH2NH2 (1) > -C3 group (2) > -CH3 (3) > -H (4).\n*   **Determine R/S configuration:**\n    *   In the drawing, the C3-C4 and the implied C4-H bonds are in the plane.\n    *   The -CH2NH2 group (priority 1) is on a solid wedge (towards the viewer).\n    *   The -CH3 group (priority 3) is on a dashed wedge (away from the viewer).\n    *   The lowest priority group, -H (priority 4), is in the plane. To determine the configuration, we can use the swap method. Let's swap the lowest priority group (H, priority 4) with the group pointing away (CH3, priority 3).\n    *   In the new, hypothetical molecule, H is now on a dashed wedge (away), and CH3 is in the plane.\n    *   Now, we trace the path 1 → 2 → 3. Group 1 (-CH2NH2) is on a wedge (towards). Group 2 (-C3 group) is in the plane. Group 3 (-CH3) is now in the plane where H was.\n    *   The path from 1 (front) → 2 (plane-left) → 3 (plane-right) is **clockwise**.\n    *   So, the configuration of the hypothetical molecule is R.\n    *   Since we performed one swap, the configuration of the original molecule is the opposite.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at **C4 is S**.\n\n**4. Determine the Configuration of C2**\n\n*   **Identify the issue:** The drawing shows both the -OH group and the -CH3 group attached to C2 with dashed wedges. This is geometrically impossible for a tetrahedral carbon, as two groups cannot occupy the same \"away\" space. This is a drawing error.\n*   **Make a reasonable assumption:** A common convention in drawing zig-zag carbon chains is to have substituents alternate between wedges and dashes. At C3, the ethyl group is a wedge. A plausible correction for the error at C2 is that one group is a dash and the other is a wedge. Let's assume the -OH is on a dash (as drawn) and the -CH3 group was intended to be on a wedge.\n*   **Assign priorities to groups attached to C2 (with assumed correction):**\n    1.  **-OH (hydroxyl group):** Priority 1 (Oxygen, Z=8).\n    2.  **-C3 group:** Priority 2 (Carbon bonded to other carbons).\n    3.  **-CH3 (methyl group):** Priority 3 (Carbon bonded only to hydrogens).\n    4.  **-H (hydrogen):** Priority 4 (Implied).\n*   **Determine R/S configuration (with assumed correction):**\n    *   Assumed geometry: -OH (1) is dash (away), -CH3 (3) is wedge (towards), -C3 group (2) and -H (4) are in the plane.\n    *   The lowest priority group, -H (4), is in the plane. Let's swap it with the group pointing away, which is -OH (1).\n    *   In the new molecule, H is on a dash (away) and -OH is in the plane.\n    *   Now, trace the path 1 → 2 → 3. Group 1 (-OH) is in the plane. Group 2 (-C3 group) is in the plane. Group 3 (-CH3) is on a wedge (towards).\n    *   The path from 1 (plane-right) → 2 (plane-left) → 3 (wedge-up) is **counter-clockwise**.\n    *   So, the configuration of the hypothetical molecule is S.\n    *   Since we performed one swap, the configuration of the original molecule (with our assumed correction) is the opposite.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at **C2 is R**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of the unambiguously drawn centers and a reasonable correction of the error at C2, the absolute configurations are:\n*   C2: R\n*   C3: R\n*   C4: S\n\nThe full stereochemical descriptor for the molecule is (2R, 3R, 4S).\n\n<<<2R, 3R, 4S>>>"
