    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Algorithm's Logic**\n    The algorithm is a recursive function `sort(a, n)` that aims to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`. Let's break down its actions for `n > 1`:\n    *   `sort(a, n - 1)`: This is a recursive call to sort the subarray consisting of the first `n-1` elements, i.e., `a[0...n-2]`.\n    *   `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: After the first `n-1` elements are sorted, `a[n-2]` is the largest among them. This line checks if the `n`-th element (`a[n-1]`) is smaller than the largest element of the sorted prefix.\n    *   `swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`: If the condition is true, it swaps the `n`-th element with the element at position `n-2`. This places the smaller element one step closer to its correct sorted position.\n    *   `sort(a, n - 1)`: This is the crucial step. If a swap occurred, the new element at `a[n-2]` (which was the original `a[n-1]`) might be smaller than other elements in the prefix `a[0...n-3]`. To fix this, the algorithm re-sorts the entire prefix `a[0...n-2]` by making another recursive call.\n\n2.  **Formulating the Recurrence Relation**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time complexity of the `sort(a, n)` function.\n    *   The base case for the recursion is when `n <= 1`. In this case, the function does nothing and returns. The time taken is constant: `T(1) = O(1)`.\n    *   For `n > 1`, the function performs:\n        1.  One recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)`, which takes `T(n - 1)`.\n        2.  One comparison and possibly one swap, which takes constant time, `O(1)`.\n        3.  A conditional second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)`, which also takes `T(n - 1)`.\n\n    To find the worst-case time complexity, we must assume the scenario that leads to the maximum amount of work. The work is maximized when the `if` condition is true, triggering the second recursive call.\n    Therefore, the worst-case recurrence relation is:\n    `T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1) + T(n - 1)`\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant representing the `O(1)` work)\n\n3.  **Identifying the Worst-Case Input**\n    The worst-case scenario happens when the condition `a[n-1] < a[n-2]` is true as often as possible. Consider an array sorted in reverse order, for example, `[n, n-1, ..., 2, 1]`.\n    *   Let's analyze `sort(a, n)` with a reverse-sorted array.\n    *   The first call `sort(a, n - 1)` will sort the prefix `a[0...n-2]`. So `[n, n-1, ..., 2]` becomes `[2, 3, ..., n]`. The array `a` becomes `[2, 3, ..., n, 1]`.\n    *   The condition `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` becomes `if 1 < n`, which is true for `n > 1`.\n    *   A swap occurs, and the second `sort(a, n - 1)` is called. This pattern repeats for each level of recursion, ensuring the second recursive call is always made.\n\n4.  **Solving the Recurrence Relation**\n    We need to solve the recurrence `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` with the base case `T(1) = c1`.\n    Let's expand the relation:\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 2^2 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 2^2 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 2c + c = 2^3 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    *   Continuing this expansion `k-1` times, we get:\n        `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n    *   The sum is a geometric series `(2^k - 1) / (2 - 1) = 2^k - 1`.\n        `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^k - 1)`\n    *   To reach the base case `T(1)`, we set `k = n - 1`.\n        `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n    *   Since `T(1)` (which is `c1`) and `c` are constants, `T(n)` can be written as:\n        `T(n) = c1 * 2^(n-1) + c * 2^(n-1) - c = (c1 + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n    *   The dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**\n    The time complexity is determined by the dominant term, which is exponential.\n    `T(n) = O(2^(n-1)) = O(2^n)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Algorithm Correctness and Termination:** The algorithm does correctly sort the array and it always terminates. The recursive calls are made on a smaller problem size (`n-1`), ensuring that the base case (`n <= 1`) is eventually reached.\n*   **Best Case vs. Worst Case:** The best-case scenario occurs when the input array is already sorted. In this case, the `if` condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is always false. The recurrence becomes `T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1)`, which solves to `O(n)`.\n*   **Inefficiency:** The algorithm is extremely inefficient. A proper recursive implementation of insertion sort would have a recurrence `T(n) = T(n-1) + O(n)`, leading to `O(n^2)` complexity. This algorithm's structure, with two full recursive calls on `n-1`, leads to exponential complexity.\n*   **Recurrence Type:** Recognizing the recurrence `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c` is key. This is a classic recurrence whose solution is exponential, unlike recurrences for divide-and-conquer algorithms like Merge Sort (`T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)`) which yields `O(n log n)`.\n\nBased on the analysis, the worst-case time complexity is `O(2^n)`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
