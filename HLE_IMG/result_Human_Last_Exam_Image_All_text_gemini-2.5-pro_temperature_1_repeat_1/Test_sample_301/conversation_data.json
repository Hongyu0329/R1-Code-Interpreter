    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each of the nine works.\n\n**Analysis of each artwork:**\n\n**1. Top-left:**\n*   **Style:** This painting depicts four stylized fish with human-like expressions looking at a hook. The style is modern, playful, and uses simple, bold lines with colorful washes. This whimsical and graphic approach to depicting animals is a signature of the artist.\n*   **Author:** This is the characteristic style of **Han Meilin (韩美林)**, a contemporary artist renowned for his modern interpretations of traditional Chinese themes, especially animals.\n\n**2. Top-center:**\n*   **Style:** This is a classic Chinese ink wash painting (水墨画) of chrysanthemums. The brushwork is confident and experienced. In the upper right corner, there is a red seal.\n*   **Author:** Upon close inspection, the seal reads \"白石\" (Báishí). This, combined with the masterful depiction of a common subject in his repertoire, identifies the artist as **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**, one of the most celebrated modern Chinese painters.\n\n**3. Top-right:**\n*   **Style:** This is a hyper-realistic oil portrait of an elderly woman from an ethnic minority group. The painting focuses intensely on the textures of her skin and clothing, conveying a sense of hardship and resilience. This style is a hallmark of the \"Scar Art\" and \"Native Soil Realism\" movements in China.\n*   **Author:** This work is a portrait of a Yi nationality woman by **Luo Zhongli (罗中立)**. He is famous for his highly realistic and empathetic portrayals of rural and ethnic minority people, with his most famous work being \"Father.\"\n\n**4. Middle-left:**\n*   **Style:** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in a very dynamic and powerful cursive script (草书). The characters are fluid and connected with great energy.\n*   **Author:** This is the distinctive and famous calligraphic style of **Mao Zedong (毛泽东)**. The piece shown is a part of his calligraphy of the poem \"Ode to the Plum Blossom\" (卜算子·咏梅).\n\n**5. Middle-center:**\n*   **Style:** This is a semi-abstract painting that combines geometric forms with traditional landscape elements. A large red circle (sun/moon) and an orange one are set against a minimalist ink wash landscape at the bottom. This fusion of Western abstract concepts and Chinese ink painting techniques is the artist's signature.\n*   **Author:** This iconic style belongs to **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**, a pivotal figure in modernizing Chinese art.\n\n**6. Middle-right:**\n*   **Style:** This is an elegant piece of Chinese calligraphy in semi-cursive script (行书). The text is a colophon or commentary on earlier calligraphic works, mentioning famous Tang dynasty calligraphers. The script is graceful, scholarly, and well-structured.\n*   **Author:** This is a colophon written by **Zhao Mengfu (赵孟頫)**, a master calligrapher and painter of the Yuan dynasty. He was renowned for his elegant script that revived classical traditions. This specific work is his famous colophon on Chu Suiliang's \"Ni Kuan Zan.\"\n\n**7. Bottom-left:**\n*   **Style:** This is a sample from one of the most famous works in the history of Chinese calligraphy, executed in cursive script. The characters \"快雪时晴\" (kuài xuě shí qíng) are visible.\n*   **Author:** This is from the \"Timely Clearing After Snowfall\" letter (《快雪时晴帖》), a masterpiece attributed to the \"Sage of Calligraphy,\" **Wang Xizhi (王羲之)** of the Eastern Jin Dynasty.\n\n**8. Bottom-center:**\n*   **Style:** This is a highly realistic oil portrait of a young woman with a pensive expression. The work demonstrates masterful use of light and shadow, characteristic of European classical portraiture, but imbued with a distinctly Chinese quietude and mood. This is a key example of China's New Classical Realism.\n*   **Author:** This is the famous painting \"The Young Singer\" (《青年女歌手》) by **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**, a leading figure in modern Chinese realist painting.\n\n**9. Bottom-right:**\n*   **Style:** This is a painting of a woman in an exotic costume, possibly from an opera or representing a minority group. The work uses strong ink outlines filled with rich, flat planes of color. The figure is stylized with an elongated face and graceful posture. This method of blending Chinese ink lines with Western color composition is unique to the artist.\n*   **Author:** This is a classic example of the work of **Lin Fengmian (林风眠)**, a pioneer of modern Chinese painting who sought to synthesize Chinese and Western artistic traditions.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the authors of the nine works from left to right, top to bottom are:\n\n1.
