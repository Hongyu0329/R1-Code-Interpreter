    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Friedel-Crafts Acylation.\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene (C₆H₆) and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl).\n*   **Catalyst:** Aluminum chloride (AlCl₃), a Lewis acid.\n*   **Mechanism:** The AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride to form a propanoyl acylium ion ([CH₃CH₂C=O]⁺). The benzene ring, acting as a nucleophile, attacks this electrophile. A subsequent loss of a proton restores aromaticity.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is propiophenone, also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-1:** C₆H₅-CO-CH₂CH₃\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (Propiophenone).\n*   **Reagents:** Bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). FeBr₃ is a Lewis acid that polarizes the Br₂ molecule, making it a stronger electrophile.\n*   **Directing Effect:** The acyl group (-CO-R) attached to the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Such groups are deactivating and are *meta*-directors. Therefore, the incoming bromine atom will add to the position *meta* to the propanoyl group.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The product is 3-bromopropiophenone, or 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-2:** A benzene ring substituted with a propanoyl group at position 1 and a bromine atom at position 3.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Catalytic Hydrogenation.\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** Hydrogen gas (H₂) over a Palladium (Pd) catalyst.\n*   **Transformations:** This is a powerful reduction method that can reduce multiple functional groups.\n    1.  **Ketone Reduction:** The ketone group (C=O) is reduced to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-).\n    2.  **Aryl Halide Hydrogenolysis:** The carbon-bromine bond on the aromatic ring is cleaved and replaced by a carbon-hydrogen bond. This reaction, known as hydrogenolysis, is common for aryl halides with H₂/Pd.\n*   **Careful Point:** If a milder reducing agent like NaBH₄ were used, only the ketone would be reduced, leaving the aryl bromide intact. The choice of H₂/Pd implies that both possible reductions are intended to occur.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** Both the ketone and the aryl bromide are reduced. The product is 1-phenylpropan-1-ol.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate-3:** C₆H₅-CH(OH)-CH₂CH₃\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 to Final Product**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Free-Radical Bromination.\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (1-phenylpropan-1-ol).\n*   **Reagents:** N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS), benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂), and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) as the solvent.\n*   **Mechanism:** This set of reagents is specific for free-radical bromination at an allylic or benzylic position. Benzoyl peroxide acts as a radical initiator. NBS provides a low, steady concentration of bromine radicals.\n*   **Reactive Site:** The most stable radical that can be formed from the reactant is the benzylic radical, where the unpaired electron is on the carbon atom attached to the phenyl ring. This radical is stabilized by resonance. The hydrogen atom at this benzylic position (the one on the carbon also bearing the -OH group) is the one that will be abstracted and replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Final Product:** The hydrogen on the carbon atom at position 1 is replaced by a bromine atom. The resulting molecule is 1-bromo-1-phenylpropan-1-ol.\n*   **Structure of Final Product:** C₆H₅-C(Br)(OH)-CH₂CH₃\n\n**Summary of the Structures:**\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 3-Bromopropiophenone\n*   **Intermediate-3:** 1-Phenylpropan-1-ol\n*   **Final Product:** 1-Bromo-1-phenylpropan-1-ol\n\nThe name of the final product is 1-bromo-1-phenylpropan-1-ol.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-phenylpropan-1-ol>>>"
