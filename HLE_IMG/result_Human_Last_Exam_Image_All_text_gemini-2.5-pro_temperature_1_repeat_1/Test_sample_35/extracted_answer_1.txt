The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **V and C1 domains** of the **RAGE** (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products) receptor.

S100B could be used as a **prognostic marker** in the pathology of neurological disorders. This is because the diagram shows that the binding of S100B to its receptor directly initiates signaling pathways (JNK/JUN and NFκβ) that lead to key pathological events such as apoptosis, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Therefore, the level of S100B expression would likely correlate with the severity and rate of disease progression, allowing clinicians to predict the future outcome for a patient. While its lack of specificity (being involved in other diseases like cardiovascular disease) means it would also serve as an adjunct marker for diagnosis, its direct role in driving the disease process makes it a powerful prognostic tool.
