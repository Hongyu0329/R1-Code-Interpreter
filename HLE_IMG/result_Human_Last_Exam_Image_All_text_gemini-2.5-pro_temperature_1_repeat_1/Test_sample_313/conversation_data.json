    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\n    *   The image shows two men in suits at an awards ceremony. One man is presenting a trophy to another.\n    *   The text states the event took place on June 20, 2019.\n    *   A search for major awards ceremonies on this date reveals the 2019 NHL Awards.\n    *   The man receiving the award is identifiable as Russian ice hockey player Nikita Kucherov of the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n    *   On that night, Kucherov had a remarkable achievement: he won three major individual awardsâ€”the Art Ross Trophy (for leading the league in points), the Ted Lindsay Award (for most outstanding player as voted by fellow players), and the Hart Memorial Trophy (for most valuable player as voted by the media).\n    *   This accomplishment of winning three major awards at once is commonly referred to in sports journalism as a \"hat trick\". For example, headlines from that day read \"Lightning's Nikita Kucherov completes awards hat trick\".\n    *   Therefore, the concept of a \"Hat Trick\" is what is being pictured, metaphorically, through the image of Nikita Kucherov at this specific event. \"X Y\" is likely \"Hat Trick\".\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n    *   The second clue states: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n    *   This clue requires us to find a second meaning for the term \"X Y\" that relates to mercury salts.\n    *   The use of mercury salts, specifically mercuric nitrate, is famously associated with the historical process of making felt for hats. This process, called \"carroting,\" involved treating animal fur with a mercury solution.\n    *   The process was extremely toxic, and the mercury fumes caused severe neurological damage to the hat-makers, known as \"erethism\" or \"Mad Hatter's disease.\" This is the origin of the phrase \"mad as a hatter.\"\n    *   Due to its toxicity, the use of mercury in the hat-making industry was phased out and eventually banned in most parts of the world. The process has \"almost ceased to be used\".\n\n*   **Step 3: Connect the two clues.**\n    *   The term that connects both clues is \"Hat Trick\".\n    *   The first clue refers to the modern, metaphorical \"hat trick\" of winning three awards.\n    *   The second clue refers to the origin of the term. The term \"hat trick\" is believed to have originated in cricket in 1858, where a player who took three wickets in three consecutive balls was rewarded with a new hat.\n    *   The hat given would often have been a felt hat. The manufacturing process for this type of hat involved the use of toxic mercury salts.\n    *   Therefore, the \"Another Hat Trick\" refers to the literal hat from the original \"hat trick,\" a product made using a method that has ceased due to the toxicity of mercury salts. The \"trick\" could also be a pun on the \"trick of the trade\" of hat-making with mercury.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The term \"X Y\" that satisfies both conditions is \"Hat Trick\".\n\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
