The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to the conformational rigidity of the N-acetyl-proline starting material. The nitrogen and α-carbon are part of a rigid five-membered ring, which prevents the molecule from adopting the specific folded conformation required for an alternative cyclization pathway. Reactions 1 and 2 establish that for a conformationally flexible, acyclic starting material (N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine), two competing cyclization pathways are possible and occur at equal rates. The standard pathway involves deprotonation of the amino acid α-carbon and cyclization onto the N-acyl carbonyl. The alternative pathway involves the N-acyl carbonyl oxygen attacking the activated carboxyl group. The lack of regioselectivity in Reaction 2 proves this second pathway is operative in the flexible system. In Reaction 3, this second pathway is blocked by the rigid proline ring, so only the standard pathway occurs, leading to a single münchnone intermediate and a single, highly regioselective product (Product B).
