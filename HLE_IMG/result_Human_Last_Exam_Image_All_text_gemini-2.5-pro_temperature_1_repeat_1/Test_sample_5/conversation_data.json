    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Basic Musical Elements**\n*   **Instrumentation:** The music is written on a grand staff (treble and bass clefs joined together), which is standard for piano music.\n*   **Key Signature:** There are four sharps (F#, C#, G#, D#) in the key signature. This indicates the key is either E major or its relative minor, C# minor. The first chord played in the left hand is an E major chord (E-G#-B), which strongly suggests the piece is in **E major**.\n*   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 'C', which stands for common time, or 4/4. This means there are four quarter-note beats per measure.\n*   **Tempo:** The tempo marking is a quarter note equals 80 (â™© = 80), which is a moderately slow and expressive tempo (Andante).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Melody and Harmony**\n*   **Measures 1-2 (Opening Theme):** The piece begins with a simple, memorable melody in the right hand: G# - A - B - C# - B - A - G#. This lyrical and slightly melancholic theme is very recognizable. The left hand plays simple chords, establishing the E major harmony.\n*   **Dynamics:** The opening is marked *p* (piano), meaning it should be played softly.\n*   **Measures 3-4 (Transition and Development):** There is a sudden and dramatic shift. The dynamic changes to *f* (forte), meaning loud. The texture also changes completely. The right hand begins playing fast, flowing sixteenth-note arpeggios, while the left hand plays powerful, low-register chords. This contrast between the gentle opening and the powerful, sweeping middle section is a key characteristic.\n*   **Harmonic Progression:** The harmony in the loud section moves through a clear progression, primarily using chords within the key of E major, such as A major (the IV chord in m. 3) and returning to E major (the I chord in m. 4).\n\n**Step 3: Identify a Distinctive Feature**\nThe most distinctive feature of this excerpt is the combination of the very specific, gentle opening melody followed immediately by the loud, virtuosic, and sweeping arpeggios. This structure and melodic content are iconic.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Information and Identify the Piece**\nThe combination of the key (E major), the memorable opening melody, and the subsequent dramatic shift to powerful arpeggios points directly to a famous piece from a video game soundtrack. This is the main theme from the opening of the game *Final Fantasy X*.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe piece is \"To Zanarkand\" composed by Nobuo Uematsu for the video game *Final Fantasy X*.\n\n<<<To Zanarkand>>>"
