    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks to identify which of the four depicted iridium complexes, used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), are expected to have shorter lifetimes. In the context of LECs or OLEDs, a \"shorter lifetime\" refers to faster degradation of the emitter molecule, leading to a decrease in device performance over time. This is primarily a question of chemical and photochemical stability of the complex under operating conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Molecular Structures**\nAll four structures are cationic Iridium(III) complexes with an octahedral geometry. They share a common architecture: [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+ PF6-.\n*   **Metal Center:** Iridium(III) is the central metal ion in all four complexes.\n*   **Ancillary Ligand (N^N):** All four complexes use the same bidentate diimine ligand: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dtbbpy). The bulky tert-butyl groups are sterically demanding and primarily influence solubility and intermolecular interactions, but are constant across the series.\n*   **Cyclometalating Ligands (C^N):** The key difference between the four complexes lies in the two identical cyclometalating ligands, which are derivatives of 2-phenylpyridine (ppy). The variation is the pattern of fluorine substitution on the phenyl ring. The Ir atom is bonded to the nitrogen of the pyridine ring and to a carbon atom of the phenyl ring (Ir-C bond).\n\nLet's examine the substitution on the phenyl ring relative to the Ir-C bond for each complex:\n*   **Complex 1:** The phenyl ring has two fluorine atoms. One is *ortho* to the Ir-C bond, and the other is *para* to the Ir-C bond.\n*   **Complex 2:** The phenyl ring has no fluorine substituents. This is the parent complex with the 2-phenylpyridinate ligand.\n*   **Complex 3:** The phenyl ring has one fluorine atom, which is *ortho* to the Ir-C bond.\n*   **Complex 4:** The phenyl ring has two fluorine atoms, both of which are *meta* to the Ir-C bond.\n\n**Step 3: Relate Structural Differences to Stability and Lifetime**\nThe stability of these Ir(III) complexes, and thus the device lifetime, is strongly influenced by the strength of the coordinate bonds, particularly the Ir-C bond, which is often the most labile.\n\n*   **General Effect of Fluorination:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom and exerts a strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect. This effect makes the cyclometalated carbon atom more electropositive, leading to a stronger, more covalent Ir-C bond. A stronger Ir-C bond generally increases the complex's resistance to thermal and photochemical degradation, thus leading to a longer lifetime. Based on this general principle, the non-fluorinated **Complex 2** would be expected to have the weakest Ir-C bond and therefore be the least stable.\n\n*   **Positional Effects of Fluorination:** The position of the fluorine atom(s) is crucial and can have effects beyond simple bond strengthening.\n    *   **Meta-fluorination (Complex 4):** Placing fluorine atoms at the meta position is a well-established strategy to enhance stability. The strong inductive effect strengthens the Ir-C bond effectively without introducing significant steric hindrance or adverse electronic interactions with the metal center. Complex 4 is expected to be the most stable and have the longest lifetime.\n    *   **Ortho-fluorination (Complexes 1 and 3):** Placing a fluorine atom at the ortho position (adjacent to the Ir-C bond) is more complicated. While the inductive effect is still present, the close proximity of the fluorine atom to the iridium metal center can be detrimental. This \"ortho effect\" can introduce new degradation pathways. Potential issues include:\n        1.  **Steric Strain:** Increased strain in the five-membered chelate ring.\n        2.  **Electronic Repulsion:** Repulsive interactions between the lone pairs of the fluorine atom and the filled d-orbitals of the Ir(III) center.\n        3.  **New Reaction Pathways:** The ortho-fluorine can participate in specific degradation reactions, such as photo-induced C-F bond cleavage or intramolecular elimination.\n    *   **Literature Precedent:** Experimental studies have shown that while para- and meta-fluorination generally improve device lifetime, ortho-fluorination can be detrimental. In some cases, ortho-fluorinated complexes have shown even shorter lifetimes than their non-fluorinated counterparts. The stability order is often found to be: meta-F > para-F > no-F > ortho-F.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Analysis and Determine the Answer**\nBased on the analysis above:\n*   **Complex 4** (meta-F) is expected to be the most stable and have the longest lifetime.\n*   **Complex 2** (no-F) is expected to have a relatively short lifetime due to the weaker, un-stabilized Ir-C bond.\n*   **Complexes 1 and 3** both contain an ortho-fluorine substituent. This specific structural feature is known to introduce unique and efficient degradation pathways, making these complexes particularly susceptible to degradation. The literature suggests this effect can be more severe than simply lacking fluorination.\n\nThe question asks for the complexes (plural) with *shorter* lifetimes. The common structural feature strongly correlated with instability is the ortho-fluorine atom. Both Complex 1 and Complex 3 possess this feature. Therefore, they are the most likely candidates to exhibit shorter lifetimes.\n\nFinal Conclusion: Complexes 1 and 3 are expected to show shorter lifetimes due to the presence of an ortho-fluorine atom on the cyclometalating ligand, which introduces specific and efficient degradation pathways.\n\nThis corresponds to the option that includes both [1] and [3].\n\n<<<F>>>"
