The structure of Compound A is tris(2-methoxyphenyl)methanol.
It has a central carbon atom bonded to one hydroxyl group (-OH) and three 2-methoxyphenyl groups. A 2-methoxyphenyl group consists of a benzene ring attached to the central carbon at position 1, with a methoxy group (-OCH₃) at position 2.

Here is a 2D representation of the structure:
```
      OCH₃
     /
---C₆H₄--\
        |
        C(OH) -- C₆H₄-OCH₃
        |
---C₆H₄--/
     \
      OCH₃
```
Where the C₆H₄ groups are attached to the central carbon ortho to the methoxy groups. A more explicit drawing would be:
[A central carbon atom is bonded to a hydroxyl group and three phenyl rings. Each phenyl ring is bonded to the central carbon at position 1, and has a methoxy group (-OCH3) at position 2.]
