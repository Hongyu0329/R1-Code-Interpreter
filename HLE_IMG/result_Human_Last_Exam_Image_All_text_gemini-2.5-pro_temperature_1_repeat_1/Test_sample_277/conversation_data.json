    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The request asks for a step-by-step analysis of a question about isomers and to determine the correct answer from the given options. The question refers to \"the molecules mentioned above\".\n\n2.  **Examine the Provided Information:** The information \"above\" the question is an image. Upon inspection, the image is completely black. It does not contain any drawings of molecules, chemical formulas, or names.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Premise of the Question:** The question, \"Which type of isomers are the molecules mentioned above?\", is predicated on the existence of molecules being presented for comparison. Since the image is blank, there are no molecules \"mentioned above\".\n\n4.  **Define the Options:**\n    *   **(a) conformers isomers (conformational isomers):** These are different spatial arrangements of the *same molecule* that can be interconverted by rotation around single bonds. To identify them, we would need to see at least one molecule's structure, typically represented in different orientations (e.g., Newman projections or chair flips).\n    *   **(b) constitutional isomers:** These are molecules that have the *same molecular formula* but a *different connectivity* (i.e., atoms are bonded together in a different order). We would need to see at least two different molecular structures to compare their formulas and connectivity.\n    *   **(c) Identical:** This means the structures shown represent the *exact same molecule*, perhaps just rotated or drawn from a different angle. We would need at least two structures to compare.\n    *   **(d) stereoisomers:** These are molecules with the *same molecular formula and connectivity* but a *different three-dimensional arrangement* of atoms in space. This category includes enantiomers and diastereomers. Again, we would need to see at least two structures to compare.\n    *   **(e) None of these:** This option is correct if the relationship between the items does not fit any of the categories (a) through (d).\n\n5.  **Conclusion based on Analysis:** Since there are no molecules presented in the image, it is impossible to perform any comparison. We cannot check for molecular formulas, connectivity, or spatial arrangements. Therefore, we cannot classify any non-existent molecules as conformers, constitutional isomers, identical, or stereoisomers. The premise required to choose any of the options (a) through (d) is not met. Consequently, the only logical conclusion is that none of these classifications apply.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:** The question asks for the relationship between molecules that are not provided. Without the molecules, no relationship can be established. Therefore, none of the specific isomeric relationships listed in options (a), (b), (c), or (d) can be correct. The correct choice must be (e).\n\n<<<E>>>"
