    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the cutoff frequency of the circuit at node $a_0$. This node is connected to a capacitor $C$ to ground, forming a low-pass filter. The cutoff frequency, $\\omega_c$ (in radians per second), of an RC low-pass filter is given by the formula:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C}$\nwhere $R_{th}$ is the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor looking back into the network from terminals $a_0$ and $b_0$ (ground).\n\n**2. Determine the Thevenin Equivalent Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\nTo find $R_{th}$, we must deactivate all independent sources in the circuit. The input source \"IN\" at node $c_0$ is deactivated by connecting it to ground. Thus, node $c_0$ is grounded. Our goal is to find the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground.\n\n**3. Analyze the Structure for $R_{th}$**\nThe resistance $R_{th}$ is the resistance seen looking into node $a_0$. From the diagram, there is a resistor $r$ connecting node $a_0$ to node $d_1$. Therefore, the total Thevenin resistance is:\n$R_{th} = r + R_{d1-gnd}$\nwhere $R_{d1-gnd}$ is the equivalent resistance of the rest of the ladder network as seen from node $d_1$, with $c_0$ serving as the ground reference.\n\n**4. Solving for $R_{d1-gnd}$ using Difference Equations**\nThe ladder is an infinite, repetitive structure. This suggests using difference equations to find the node voltages, from which we can deduce the resistance. Let's find the resistance from any node to ground by injecting a current and finding the resulting voltage.\n\nLet's find $R_{th}$ directly by injecting a test current $I_0$ into node $a_0$ (let's call it $d_0$ for consistent indexing) and finding the voltage $V_0$ at that node. Then $R_{th} = V_0 / I_0$. The node $c_0$ is grounded, so $V_{c0} = 0$.\n\nThe Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) equations at the nodes are (using conductance $g=1/r$):\nFor any node $c_n$ with $n \\ge 1$: $(V_{cn}-V_{c,n-1})g + (V_{cn}-V_{dn})g + (V_{cn}-V_{c,n+1})g = 0$\nFor any node $d_n$ with $n \\ge 1$: $(V_{dn}-V_{d,n-1})g + (V_{dn}-V_{cn})g + (V_{dn}-V_{d,n+1})g = 0$\n\nThese are homogeneous linear difference equations. We look for solutions of the form $V_n = A k^n$. For the system to have non-trivial solutions, the characteristic equation must be satisfied, which yields roots for $k$. For this specific ladder topology, the physically meaningful root (for which voltage decays down the ladder, i.e., $|k|<1$) is $k = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe general solution for the voltages along the ladder for $n \\ge 1$, far from the specific boundary conditions at $n=0$, can be written as a superposition of a common-mode voltage and a differential-mode voltage:\n$V_{cn} = U + W k^{n-1}$\n$V_{dn} = U - W k^{n-1}$\nThis form describes the voltages for $n \\ge 1$ in terms of two constants, $U$ and $W$.\n\nNow, we use the KCL equations at the boundary nodes ($c_1$ and $d_1$) to relate these constants to the voltage at the input, $V_0 = V_{d0}$.\nThe KCL equation at node $c_1$ is:\n$(V_{c1}-V_{c0}) + (V_{c1}-V_{d1}) + (V_{c1}-V_{c2}) = 0$.\nSince $V_{c0}=0$, and substituting the general solutions for $n=1,2$:\n$V_{c1} + (V_{c1}-V_{d1}) + (V_{c1}-V_{c2}) = 0$\n$(U+W) + ((U+W)-(U-W)) + ((U+W)-(U+Wk)) = 0$\n$U+W + 2W + W - Wk = 0 \\implies U + W(4-k) = 0$ (Eq. 1)\n\nThe KCL equation at node $d_1$ is:\n$(V_{d1}-V_{d0}) + (V_{d1}-V_{c1}) + (V_{d1}-V_{d2}) = 0$.\nSubstituting the general solutions and $V_0$ for $V_{d0}$:\n$(U-W-V_0) + ((U-W)-(U+W)) + ((U-W)-(U-Wk)) = 0$\n$U-W-V_0 - 2W - W+Wk = 0 \\implies V_0 = U - 4W + Wk = U + W(k-4)$ (Eq. 2)\n\nFrom Eq. 1, we have $U = -W(4-k)$. Substituting this into Eq. 2:\n$V_0 = -W(4-k) + W(k-4) = -2W(4-k)$.\n\nFinally, we use the relationship at node $a_0=d_0$, where the current $I_0$ is injected:\n$I_0 = \\frac{V_0 - V_{d1}}{r}$.\n$V_{d1} = U-W = -W(4-k) - W = W(-4+k-1) = W(k-5)$.\n$I_0 r = V_0 - V_{d1} = -2W(4-k) - W(k-5) = W(-8+2k-k+5) = W(k-3)$.\nSo, $W = \\frac{I_0 r}{k-3}$.\n\nNow we can find $R_{th} = V_0 / I_0$:\n$V_0 = -2W(4-k) = -2 \\left(\\frac{I_0 r}{k-3}\\right)(4-k)$.\n$R_{th} = \\frac{V_0}{I_0} = -2r \\frac{4-k}{k-3} = 2r \\frac{4-k}{3-k}$.\n\nSubstitute $k=2-\\sqrt{3}$:\n$4-k = 4 - (2-\\sqrt{3}) = 2+\\sqrt{3}$\n$3-k = 3 - (2-\\sqrt{3}) = 1+\\sqrt{3}$\n$R_{th} = 2r \\frac{2+\\sqrt{3}}{1+\\sqrt{3}} = 2r \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{3})(1-\\sqrt{3})}{(1+\\sqrt{3})(1-\\sqrt{3})} = 2r \\frac{2-2\\sqrt{3}+\\sqrt{3}-3}{1-3} = 2r \\frac{-1-\\sqrt{3}}{-2} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Cutoff Frequency**\nNow that we have the Thevenin resistance, we can find the cutoff frequency $\\omega_c$.\n$R_{th} = r(1+\\sqrt{3})$\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{rC(1+\\sqrt{3})}$\n\nThe cutoff frequency at node $a_0$ is therefore $1/(rC(1+\\sqrt{3}))$.\n\n<<<1/(r*C*(1+sqrt(3)))>>>"
