    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key anatomical part in question:** The question specifically asks about the **sporophyte**, which is the spore-producing generation in mosses. The main parts of a moss sporophyte are the foot (embedded in the gametophyte), the **seta** (the stalk), and the **capsule** (which contains the spores). The difference we are looking for should be an easily visible feature of these parts.\n\n2.  **Examine the name *Grimmia curviseta*:** The specific epithet often provides a clue to a key characteristic of a species. In this case, \"*curviseta*\" is a combination of the Latin words \"*curvus*\" (meaning curved) and \"*seta*\" (meaning bristle or, in botany, the stalk of the sporophyte). This strongly suggests that a key feature of this species is a curved seta.\n\n3.  **Research the sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta*:** Botanical descriptions confirm that *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by its short but distinctly **curved or arcuate seta**. This curvature causes the capsule to be exserted from the surrounding leaves but then bend downwards, making the capsule cernuous (nodding) or pendent (hanging).\n\n4.  **Research the sporophyte of *Grimmia montana*:** In contrast, botanical descriptions of *Grimmia montana* state that its sporophyte has a very short and **straight seta**. Because the seta is straight and short, the capsule is typically held erect and is either immersed within the perichaetial leaves (the specialized leaves at the base of the sporophyte) or only slightly emergent above them. The capsules in the provided image, being upright and nestled among the leaves, are consistent with the appearance of a species with a straight, short seta like *G. montana*.\n\n5.  **Compare the two species:**\n    *   ***Grimmia montana***: Seta is **straight** and short. The capsule is erect and immersed or barely emergent.\n    *   ***Grimmia curviseta***: Seta is **curved** (arcuate) and short. The capsule is nodding or hanging.\n\n6.  **Conclusion on the main distinguishing feature:** The most significant and easily observable difference (\"at a glance\") between the sporophytes of these two species is the **curvature of the seta**. A straight seta results in an erect capsule (*G. montana*), while a curved seta results in a nodding or hanging capsule (*G. curviseta*).\n\n<<<The main difference that distinguishes the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the shape of the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule in an erect position. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a short but distinctly curved (arcuate) seta, which causes the capsule to be nodding or hanging."
