The main difference that distinguishes the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the shape of the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule in an erect position. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a short but distinctly curved (arcuate) seta, which causes the capsule to be nodding or hanging.
