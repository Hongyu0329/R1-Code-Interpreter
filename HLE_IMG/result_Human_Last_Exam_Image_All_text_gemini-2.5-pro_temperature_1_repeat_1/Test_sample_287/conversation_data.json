    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the city where the image was taken.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the main visual features of the image.**\nThe image displays a dense cluster of modern skyscrapers against a sunset sky. The architectural styles are varied.\n- On the far left, there is a building with a light-colored, panelled facade and horizontal bands of windows. There is also a plume of steam or smoke rising in front of it.\n- Next to it is a tall, dark building with a glass curtain wall and a slightly curved facade.\n- In the middle and to the right, there is another large, blocky skyscraper with a grid-like pattern of windows.\n- On the far right, a distinctive building with a golden or bronze hue is visible, reflecting the sunset. Its facade appears to have diagonal or angled elements.\n\n**Step 2: Use the cropped images for detailed examination.**\n- **Crops 1 & 2:** These focus on the leftmost building and the rising steam. The building has a modern, somewhat brutalist feel with its precast panels. The steam suggests a district heating plant or a large building's exhaust system, a feature present in many cold-climate cities.\n- **Crops 3, 5, & 7:** These highlight the curved, dark glass building. This unique shape is a significant clue.\n- **Crops 4, 8, & 9:** These show the large, grid-like office tower. It's a classic international style skyscraper.\n- **Crop 10:** This gives a better view of the building on the far right. The golden color and the angled structure are very prominent. This is the most unique and identifiable building in the frame.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the key landmark building.**\nThe most distinctive building is the one on the far right with the gold-colored, reflective glass and jagged, angled profile. This is the unmistakable **Royal Bank Plaza** in Toronto, Canada. The unique color comes from glass coated with a small amount of real gold to reduce heating and cooling costs.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the surrounding buildings to confirm the location.**\nKnowing one landmark allows us to identify the others based on their relative positions. The view in the photo is looking southeast across Toronto's Financial District.\n- The large, dark, grid-like building to the left of the Royal Bank Plaza is one of the towers of the **TD Centre**, specifically the TD Canada Trust Tower.\n- The curved glass building further left is the **Bay Wellington Tower**, which is part of the **Brookfield Place** complex.\n- The lighter-colored building on the far left is the other tower of Brookfield Place, located at 181 Bay Street.\n- The steam plume on the left is very likely from the **Enwave Pearl Street Energy Centre**, a district heating plant that provides steam to many buildings in downtown Toronto.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the location.**\nThe presence and specific arrangement of these iconic buildings—Royal Bank Plaza, the TD Centre, and Brookfield Place—along with the steam from the nearby energy plant, definitively place the photograph in **Toronto, Canada**. The photo was likely taken from a position west or northwest of the Financial District.\n\n<<<Toronto>>>"
