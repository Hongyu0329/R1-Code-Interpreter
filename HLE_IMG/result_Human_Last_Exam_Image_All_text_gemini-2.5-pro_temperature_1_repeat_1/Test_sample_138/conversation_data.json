    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the insects in each pair to determine their biological sexes.\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Bees and Wasps:**\n\n*   **Antennae:** Males generally have longer antennae with more segments (13 in most male bees/wasps vs. 12 in females). In many wasps, the tips of the male antennae are distinctly curled.\n*   **Abdomen:** Females have 6 visible abdominal segments and a stinger (modified ovipositor) at the tip, which often makes the abdomen appear more pointed. Males have 7 visible abdominal segments, no stinger, and the tip of the abdomen is often blunter or may have species-specific claspers or spines.\n*   **Facial Markings:** In many bee and wasp species, males have more extensive yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus) than females.\n*   **Pollen Collection:** Only females collect pollen to provision nests for their offspring. The prompt specifies these taxa lack scopae (pollen-carrying hairs) on their legs. This points to groups like wasps, cuckoo bees (which don't collect pollen), or bees that carry pollen on their abdomen (Megachilidae).\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Pair A:**\n\n*   **Identification:** These are cuckoo bees, likely of the genus *Coelioxys*. These bees are cleptoparasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other bees, and thus females do not collect pollen and lack scopae.\n*   **Insect A (Left):** The abdomen is highly tapered to a sharp, conical point. This is the characteristic shape of a female *Coelioxys*, whose modified ovipositor is used to pierce the host's nest cell.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** The abdomen does not end in a single sharp point but rather in a set of distinct prongs or spines. This is characteristic of a male *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Female, Right is Male. This corresponds to option **4 (F, M)**.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Pair B:**\n\n*   **Identification:** These appear to be paper wasps of the genus *Polistes*. Wasps are pollinators and do not have scopae for pollen collection.\n*   **Insect B (Left):** The most telling feature is the antennae. The tips are distinctly curled or hooked. This is a reliable characteristic of male wasps in many families, including Vespidae.\n*   **Insect B (Right):** The antennae are straight, lacking the curl at the tip. The abdomen ends in a gentle point, consistent with a female's hidden stinger.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Pair C:**\n\n*   **Identification:** These are two different types of bees that fit the \"no leg scopae\" description.\n*   **Insect C (Left):** This bee has very long antennae that curve back over its body. It also has a prominent pale yellow patch on its clypeus (the lower part of its face). Both long antennae and yellow facial markings are classic traits of male bees in many groups (e.g., long-horned bees).\n*   **Insect C (Right):** This bee has a large amount of bright yellow pollen packed onto the underside of its abdomen. This is an abdominal scopa, characteristic of female bees in the family Megachilidae (leaf-cutter and mason bees). These bees lack scopae on their legs, fitting the question's criteria. Since only females collect pollen, this individual is a female.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Summary:**\n\n*   Pair A: Female, Male (F, M) -> Index **4**\n*   Pair B: Male, Female (M, F) -> Index **3**\n*   Pair C: Male, Female (M, F) -> Index **3**\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of these indices.\n\n<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
