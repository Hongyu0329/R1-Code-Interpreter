    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and determine its molecular formula.**\n\n*   The starting material is a bicyclic lactam. The core structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one system.\n*   Let's count the atoms in the core structure with its substituents:\n    *   **Bicyclic core skeleton**: This is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptene system. Let's count the carbons and hydrogens on the framework:\n        *   C1 (bridgehead): 1 C, 1 H\n        *   N2 (nitrogen atom): 1 N\n        *   C3 (carbonyl carbon): 1 C\n        *   C4 (bridgehead): 1 C, 1 H\n        *   C5 (alkene carbon): 1 C, 1 H\n        *   C6 (alkene carbon): 1 C\n        *   C7 (bridge carbon): 1 C, 2 H\n        *   Total for the bare skeleton: C6H5N.\n    *   **Substituents**:\n        *   **Carbonyl oxygen**: At C3, there is a C=O group. This adds 1 O.\n        *   **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: Attached to C6. This adds 1 C and 3 F.\n        *   **p-Methoxybenzyl group (PMB)**: Attached to the nitrogen (N2). The structure is -CH2-C6H4-OCH3. The formula of this group is C8H9O (C: 1 from CH2 + 6 from benzene ring + 1 from OCH3 = 8; H: 2 from CH2 + 4 from ring + 3 from OCH3 = 9; O: 1 from OCH3).\n*   **Total Molecular Formula of Starting Material**:\n    *   Carbons (C): 6 (core) + 1 (from CF3) + 8 (from PMB) = 15\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 5 (core) + 9 (from PMB) = 14\n    *   Fluorines (F): 3 (from CF3) = 3\n    *   Nitrogens (N): 1 (from core) = 1\n    *   Oxygens (O): 1 (from carbonyl) + 1 (from PMB) = 2\n    *   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction to find the structure and formula of Intermediate 1.**\n\n*   **Reaction**: The starting material reacts with Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in acetonitrile/water (ACN/H2O).\n*   **Transformation**: CAN is a standard reagent for the oxidative deprotection of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) groups from amines and alcohols. The PMB group on the nitrogen atom is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Change in Formula**: We remove the PMB group (-C8H9O) and add a hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Net change: -C8, -H9, -O, +H = -C8, -H8, -O.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 1**:\n    *   Start with C15H14F3NO2.\n    *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   H: 14 - 8 = 6\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   The molecular formula of Intermediate 1 is **C7H6F3NO**.\n    *   Intermediate 1 is 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction to find the structure and formula of Intermediate 2.**\n\n*   **Reaction**: Intermediate 1 is treated with hydrogen gas (H2) and a palladium on carbon catalyst (Pd/C) in methanol (MeOH).\n*   **Transformation**: This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Under these conditions, the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the bicyclic ring will be reduced to a single bond. The amide (lactam) carbonyl group and the C-F bonds are stable under these mild conditions.\n*   **Change in Formula**: The reduction of one C=C bond adds one molecule of H2 (two hydrogen atoms).\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 2**:\n    *   Start with C7H6F3NO.\n    *   C: 7\n    *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 1\n    *   The molecular formula of Intermediate 2 is **C7H8F3NO**.\n    *   Intermediate 2 is the saturated analog, 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third reaction to find the structure and formula of the final Product.**\n\n*   **Reaction**: Intermediate 2 is heated with 4 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 70 Â°C.\n*   **Transformation**: These are conditions for the hydrolysis of an amide. The cyclic amide (lactam) will be hydrolyzed, cleaving the amide C-N bond. This reaction consumes one molecule of water (H2O). The ring opens to form an amino acid. The carbonyl group (C=O) becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the nitrogen atom becomes an amino group (-NH2).\n*   **Change in Formula**: The hydrolysis adds one molecule of H2O.\n*   **Molecular Formula of the Final Product**:\n    *   Start with C7H8F3NO.\n    *   C: 7\n    *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   F: 3\n    *   N: 1\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   The molecular formula of the final product is **C7H10F3NO2**.\n    *   The product is a trifluoromethyl-substituted aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\nSummary of the formulas:\n*   Starting Material: C15H14F3NO2\n*   Intermediate 1: C7H6F3NO\n*   Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO\n*   Final Product: C7H10F3NO2\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
