    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" sonata, first movement.\n\n**1. Identify the Location and Musical Context:**\n*   **Piece:** Ludwig van Beethoven, Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor, Op. 13 (\"Pathetique\"), 1st Movement (Allegro di molto e con brio).\n*   **Measure:** The question specifically asks for the analysis of measure 30. Looking at the provided score, measure 28 is marked. Measure 29 is the next full measure, and measure 30 is the one following it, which is circled in the image.\n*   **Key Signature:** The key signature is three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭), which indicates the key of C minor or its relative major, E♭ major. The home key of the movement is C minor. This passage is part of the transition section, which typically modulates from the home key to the key of the second theme.\n\n**2. Identify the Notes in Measure 30:**\n*   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The notes are played as a broken chord. They are G4, B♮4, D5, and F♯5.\n*   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays D3 and D2 as an octave.\n*   **Combined Notes:** The complete set of pitches sounding in measure 30 is D, F♯, G, and B♮.\n\n**3. Analyze the Harmony and Function:**\n*   **Determine the Chord's Root and Quality:** The notes are D, F♯, G, B♮. This combination does not form a simple, standard triad or seventh chord. To understand its function, we must look at the chords surrounding it.\n    *   **Measure 29:** The chord is a B♭ dominant 7th (B♭-D-F-A♭) over an F in the bass (V4/2 of E♭ major). This signals a move towards E♭ major.\n    *   **Measure 31:** The chord is a C minor triad (C-E♭-G). In the home key of C minor, this is the tonic chord (i). In the likely goal key of the transition (E♭ major), this is the submediant chord (vi).\n*   **Analyze the function of the chord in m. 30:** The chord in measure 30 resolves to the C minor chord in measure 31. Let's analyze the chord in measure 30 in the context of the home key, C minor.\n    *   The dominant chord in C minor is G major (G-B♮-D), which is Roman numeral **V**.\n    *   The dominant of the dominant (V/V) would be the dominant of G major, which is a D major chord (D-F♯-A). This is built on the supertonic (scale degree II) of C minor.\n*   **Comparing our chord to the possibilities:**\n    1.  **Is it a V chord?** The V chord of C minor is G-B♮-D. Our chord in m. 30 contains all three of these notes. However, it also contains a very prominent F♯, and the bass note is D, not G. If it were a V chord, it would be in second inversion (V6/4). The F♯ would have to be explained as a non-chord tone (like a chromatic passing tone from the F in m. 29 to the G in m. 30), but its rhythmic emphasis makes this interpretation less likely.\n    2.  **Is it a V/V chord?** The V/V chord is D major (D-F♯-A). Our chord contains the root (D) and the crucial third (F♯), which acts as the leading tone to G (the root of V). The D is in the bass, so the chord is in root position from a D-major perspective. The notes G and B♮ do not belong to a standard D major chord, but they are the root and third of the upcoming dominant (V). Beethoven has merged the V/V chord with elements of the V chord it is preparing.\n\n**4. Conclusion on Roman Numeral:**\n*   The most accurate functional analysis recognizes that the chord's primary role is to prepare the dominant (V). It does this by using the harmony of the dominant's dominant (V/V). The chord is built on scale degree II (D) and is chromatically altered (F becomes F♯) to function as a dominant.\n*   Therefore, the chord is a secondary dominant. Specifically, it is the dominant of the dominant.\n*   The Roman numeral for the dominant of the dominant is **V/V**.\n\n<<<V/V>>>"
