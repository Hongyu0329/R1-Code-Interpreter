    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the time signature of the musical measure.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the time signature of the provided measure. A time signature (e.g., 4/4, 3/4) tells us two things:\n1.  The top number indicates how many beats are in a measure.\n2.  The bottom number indicates what kind of note gets one beat (e.g., 4 means a quarter note, 8 means an eighth note).\nTo find the time signature, we need to count the total duration of the notes and rests within the measure.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Rhythm of the Bottom Stave (Left Hand)**\nThis is often the simpler part to analyze first.\n*   The first note is a chord played as a quarter note (a filled-in notehead with a stem). Its duration is one quarter note.\n*   The second note is a single note played as a quarter note. Its duration is one quarter note.\n*   The third note is a single note played as a quarter note. Its duration is one quarter note.\n*   The fourth note is a single note played as a quarter note. Its duration is one quarter note.\n*   Summing the durations: 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note = 4 quarter notes.\n*   This strongly suggests a time signature with a total value of four quarter notes, such as 4/4.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Rhythm of the Top Stave (Right Hand)**\nWe should verify that the top stave has the same total duration. This part is rhythmically more complex.\n*   Notes with two beams (or two flags) are sixteenth notes. It takes four sixteenth notes to equal one quarter note.\n*   Let's count the total number of sixteenth-note-equivalents in the measure.\n    *   **Beat 1:** A sixteenth-note chord, followed by a sixteenth rest, followed by two sixteenth notes. Total: 1+1+1+1 = 4 sixteenth notes. This equals one quarter note.\n    *   **Beat 2:** A group of four sixteenth notes beamed together. Total: 4 sixteenth notes. This equals one quarter note.\n    *   **Beat 3:** Another group of four sixteenth notes beamed together. Total: 4 sixteenth notes. This equals one quarter note.\n    *   **Beat 4:** A final group of four sixteenth notes beamed together. Total: 4 sixteenth notes. This equals one quarter note.\n*   Summing the durations: 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note = 4 quarter notes.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Results and Choose the Correct Answer**\n*   Both the top and bottom staves contain a total rhythmic value equivalent to four quarter notes.\n*   A measure containing four quarter notes has a time signature of 4/4.\n*   Let's check this against the answer choices:\n    *   A. 2/4: Two quarter notes per measure. Incorrect.\n    *   B. 3/4: Three quarter notes per measure. Incorrect.\n    *   C. 4/4: Four quarter notes per measure. **Correct.**\n    *   D. 3/8: Three eighth notes per measure. Incorrect.\n    *   E. 9/8: Nine eighth notes per measure. Incorrect.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Identify Note Values:** Be sure to correctly identify quarter notes (one stem), eighth notes (one beam/flag), and sixteenth notes (two beams/flags).\n*   **Identify Rests:** The symbol for a sixteenth rest is present in the first beat of the right hand.\n*   **Use Beaming as a Guide:** Beams are often used to group notes into beats. In the right hand, the notes are clearly grouped into four sets, each lasting one quarter note, which visually reinforces the 4/4 meter.\n*   **Analyze Both Staves:** For piano music, both staves must have the same total duration per measure. Analyzing both provides a way to cross-check your counting.\n\nThe analysis of both staves consistently shows a total duration of four quarter notes per measure.\n\n<<<C>>>"
