1. **[4π + 2π] Cycloaddition**: One molecule acts as a 4π diene and the other as a 2π dienophile.
2. **[6π + 4π] Cycloaddition**: One molecule acts as a 6π triene system and the other as a 4π diene system.
3. **[4π + 4π] Cycloaddition**: Both molecules react as 4π components, for example, as carbonyl ylide 1,3-dipoles.
4. **[8π + 6π] Cycloaddition**: One molecule uses its entire 8π system while the other acts as a 6π component.
