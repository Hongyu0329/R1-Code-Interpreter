    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Specimen H**\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   **Color:** The rock is reddish-brown. This color is often due to the oxidation of iron-rich minerals.\n    *   **Texture:** The rock is highly porous with many visible holes (vesicles). This is known as a vesicular texture. The underlying rock matrix appears fine-grained (aphanitic), with no visible crystals.\n    *   **Formation:** Vesicular texture indicates that gas was trapped in molten rock (lava) as it cooled rapidly at or near the Earth's surface. This points to an extrusive igneous rock.\n*   **Conclusion:** A reddish, vesicular, fine-grained extrusive igneous rock is identified as **Scoria**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Specimen I**\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   **Composition:** The rock is composed of various smaller fragments (clasts) that have been cemented together. This is a clastic texture.\n    *   **Clast Shape:** The fragments are distinctly angular, not rounded.\n    *   **Formation:** Clastic rocks form from the accumulation and lithification (compaction and cementation) of pieces of pre-existing rock. The angularity of the clasts indicates they have undergone very little transport from their source, as transport tends to round the edges.\n*   **Conclusion:** A clastic rock composed of angular fragments is identified as **Breccia**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Specimen J**\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   **Color:** The rock is very light-colored, appearing white or light gray. This suggests a felsic (silica-rich) composition.\n    *   **Texture:** Like specimen H, this rock is highly vesicular and appears very porous and lightweight. The texture is fine-grained or glassy.\n    *   **Formation:** This is also an extrusive igneous rock formed from gas-rich lava that cooled quickly. Its light color distinguishes it from the more mafic (iron- and magnesium-rich) scoria.\n*   **Conclusion:** A light-colored, highly vesicular, low-density extrusive igneous rock is identified as **Pumice**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Specimen K**\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   **Texture:** The rock is composed of large, interlocked mineral crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. This is a coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture. The crystals are exceptionally large.\n    *   **Composition:** The specimen shows a mix of light-colored (likely feldspar) and some dark-colored minerals.\n    *   **Formation:** A phaneritic texture indicates that the magma cooled slowly deep within the Earth's crust, which allowed large crystals to grow. This is an intrusive igneous rock. The very large crystal size is the most distinguishing feature.\n*   **Conclusion:** An intrusive igneous rock characterized by its very large crystals is identified as a **Pegmatite**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBased on the analysis of their distinct characteristics:\n\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Pegmatite\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
