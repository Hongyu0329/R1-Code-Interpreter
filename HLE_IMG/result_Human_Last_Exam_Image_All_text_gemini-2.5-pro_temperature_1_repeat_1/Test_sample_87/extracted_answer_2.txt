CH2-CH2
```
In this simplified representation:
*   The main bicyclic structure is the dihydropyrrolizine core formed from the cycloaddition.
*   C5, C6, C7, C8 and N form one 5-membered ring with a C6=C7 double bond. C1, C2, C3, C8 and N form the other 5-membered ring.
*   The Nitrogen (N) is attached to the 1-pyrrolin-2-yl substituent group.
*   The -COOCH3 group is at C6.
*   The -CH(OH)CH3 group is at C5.

**Product B (C12H14N2O3):**

```
In this simplified representation:
*   The core is a pyrrolizin-3-one.
*   The Nitrogen (N) is attached to the 1-pyrrolin-2-yl substituent group.
*   The -COOCH3 group is at C6, on a C6=C7 double bond.
*   There is a C=O group at position C3.
