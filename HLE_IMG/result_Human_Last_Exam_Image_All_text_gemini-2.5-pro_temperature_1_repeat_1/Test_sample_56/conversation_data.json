    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observation of the Painting's Style:** The painting displays a highly detailed and realistic technique applied to an illogical, dreamlike scene. This combination is a hallmark of the Surrealist art movement. The scene is an interior room that paradoxically opens up to multiple, conflicting exterior environments.\n\n2.  **Deconstruction of Key Elements:**\n    *   **The Room:** A seemingly normal room with wooden floors, a fireplace, bookshelves, and doorways.\n    *   **The Left \"Window\"/Opening:** This is not a window but a complete removal of the wall, revealing a barren landscape with a large, leafless tree, a rocky shore, and a massive wall of ice or a glacier in the distance. A hot air balloon with a basket of plants floats in the sky.\n    *   **The Right Doorway:** This doorway opens directly onto a rough sea, with the water flowing into the room and forming a small beach on the wooden floor. A large steamship is visible in the distance.\n    *   **The Central Doorway:** This doorway shows a different scene, a cityscape at twilight with a crescent moon. A large, classical-style bust with leaves for hair peeks into the room.\n    *   **The Fireplace:** Instead of wood, books are burning in the fireplace. More books are scattered on the floor, some open, being read by a figure.\n    *   **The Figures:** Two slender, almost mannequin-like figures are present. One is standing, holding a book, and looking out at the icy landscape. The other is sitting on the floor, engrossed in reading the books.\n    *   **Other Details:** A picture of the Leaning Tower of Pisa hangs crookedly on the wall. A mirror above the fireplace reflects a simple blue sky, which doesn't match any of the visible exterior scenes.\n\n3.  **Connecting the Style and Elements to an Artist:** The specific style—characterized by its clean lines, architectural precision, and the inclusion of impossible perspectives and visual paradoxes—is distinctive. It's reminiscent of artists like M.C. Escher and René Magritte but has its own unique vocabulary. The artist is known for creating these \"impossible worlds\" within Flemish-style interiors.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Artwork and Artist:** A search based on the visual elements (e.g., \"surrealist painting with ocean flowing into room,\" \"painting of burning books in fireplace surrealism\") or a reverse image search leads to the specific artwork. The painting is titled \"La Quema de los Libros\" (The Burning of the Books). The artist is the Belgian (Flemish) painter **Jos De Mey** (1928-2007). He was well-known for his works that blended realism with architectural impossibilities, often paying homage to or referencing other artists like Escher, Magritte, and Bruegel.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   Distinguish the style from other surrealists. It's not the melting, organic style of Dalí or the automatic drawing of Masson. It is a very deliberate, illusionistic, and architecturally-focused form of Surrealism.\n*   Note the title, \"The Burning of the Books,\" which adds a layer of meaning to the scene, possibly alluding to censorship, the destruction of knowledge, or a paradoxical relationship with literature (figures are reading while books burn).\n*   The multiple crops provided help to focus on specific details, confirming the complexity and richness of the composition, from the texture of the tree bark to the reflection in the mirror and the waves on the floor.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on the distinct style, the specific combination of surreal elements, and cross-referencing with art databases, the artist is identified as Jos De Mey.\n\n<<<Jos De Mey>>>"
