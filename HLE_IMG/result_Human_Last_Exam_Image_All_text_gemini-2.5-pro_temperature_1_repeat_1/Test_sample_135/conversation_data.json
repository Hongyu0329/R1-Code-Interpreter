    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the altarpiece detail.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the artwork.**\n*   **Medium and Form:** The image shows a sculpture in relief, specifically a tondo (a circular artwork). It appears to be carved from marble or possibly made of glazed terracotta, a medium popular in the Italian Renaissance. The relief is set within an ornate, decorative frame.\n*   **Subject Matter:** The scene is clearly religious. A priest is administering the Eucharist (Holy Communion) to a group of kneeling figures, including a child. This is a depiction of one of the Seven Sacraments.\n*   **Inscription:** At the bottom of the roundel, there is a cartouche with an inscription. The visible text reads \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This is a combination of Latin and old Italian/French, which translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" confirming the subject is the Eucharist.\n*   **Style:** The style is characteristic of the Early Italian Renaissance, specifically the Florentine school of the 15th century. The figures are rendered with classicism, grace, and naturalism. The composition is balanced and serene. The decorative frame with the egg-and-dart motif inside the circle and the surrounding floral or fruit garlands are also typical of this period.\n\n**Step 2: Synthesize the clues to identify potential artists.**\n*   The combination of a tondo relief, the subject of the Sacraments, the Florentine Renaissance style, and the potential medium of marble or glazed terracotta strongly points towards a few key artists of that era.\n*   Donatello is a major figure, but his style is often more dramatic and expressive.\n*   The Della Robbia family workshop, particularly its founder **Luca della Robbia**, is famous for creating serene, classical reliefs in glazed terracotta and marble. The style seen in the image, with its clarity, gentle piety, and elegant composition, is a hallmark of Luca della Robbia's work.\n\n**Step 3: Corroborate the identification with a specific artwork.**\n*   A search for \"Luca della Robbia Sacrament of the Altar tondo\" or similar terms leads to a specific, well-known work: the **Tabernacle of the Sacrament** (in Italian, *Tabernacolo del Sacramento* or *Ciborio di Santa Maria Nuova*).\n*   This marble tabernacle was created by Luca della Robbia between 1441 and 1443 for the chapel of the Hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence. It is now located in the church of Santa Maria in Peretola, Florence.\n*   The predella (the base of the altarpiece) of this tabernacle features several scenes, including relief roundels. The image provided is a detail of the right-hand roundel on this predella, which depicts the *Sacrament of the Altar (The Eucharist)*.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the author's identity.**\nBased on the stylistic analysis and the direct match with a known masterpiece, the author of this relief sculpture is unequivocally identified.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe author of this detail of the Altarpiece is Luca della Robbia.\n\n<<<Luca della Robbia>>>"
