    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph**\nThe image provided is a raster plot, a common visualization for neuronal activity.\n*   The **x-axis** represents Time, measured in seconds (s), from 0 to 50.\n*   The **y-axis** represents the Electrode Number, from 0 to 128. Each row corresponds to a specific electrode recording from the neuronal culture.\n*   Each **black dot** represents a single neuronal firing event (a \"spike\") at a specific time and from a specific electrode.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts**\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a period where many neurons (and thus many electrodes) fire in a highly correlated and rapid manner. In the raster plot, these events appear as dense vertical bands of dots, indicating that a large fraction of the recorded electrodes are active at approximately the same time. We need to identify the timestamps for these events. By visually inspecting the graph, we can locate the center of each major synchronized burst.\n\n*   **Burst 1:** The first clear, network-wide burst is centered at approximately **t₁ = 2 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The second major burst is centered at approximately **t₂ = 12 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** The third major burst is centered at approximately **t₃ = 24 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** The fourth major burst is centered at approximately **t₄ = 36 s**.\n*   **Burst 5:** The fifth and final major burst within the time frame is centered at approximately **t₅ = 49 s**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time difference between consecutive synchronized bursts. We have identified 5 bursts, so we can calculate 4 inter-burst intervals.\n\n*   **IBI₁** (between Burst 1 and 2): t₂ - t₁ = 12 s - 2 s = **10 s**\n*   **IBI₂** (between Burst 2 and 3): t₃ - t₂ = 24 s - 12 s = **12 s**\n*   **IBI₃** (between Burst 3 and 4): t₄ - t₃ = 36 s - 24 s = **12 s**\n*   **IBI₄** (between Burst 4 and 5): t₅ - t₄ = 49 s - 36 s = **13 s**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual IBIs and divide by the number of intervals.\n\n*   Sum of IBIs = 10 s + 12 s + 12 s + 13 s = 47 s\n*   Number of intervals = 4\n*   Average IBI = 47 s / 4 = **11.75 s**\n\n**Step 5: Round to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures.\n\n*   The calculated average is 11.75 s.\n*   The first two significant digits are '1' and '1'.\n*   The third digit is '7', which is 5 or greater, so we round up the second significant digit.\n*   Rounding 11.75 to two significant figures gives **12**.\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is 12 s.\n\n<<<12>>>"
