    "*   **Step-by-step analysis of the image and question:**\n    1.  **Analyze the object:** The image displays a circular metal object, a medallion or a military decoration (phalera), with a rectangular tab at the top for attachment. It features two figures in relief, shown as busts facing each other. The image is a black and white photograph, suggesting it's an archaeological artifact.\n    2.  **Identify key stylistic features:**\n        *   The figure on the left is more prominent. He has large, stylized, staring eyes. His hair is arranged in a decorative, patterned manner. Most notably, he wears what appears to be a helmet or has horns, specifically large, curved ram's horns, around his ears. This iconography is associated with deities like Jupiter-Ammon and was sometimes adopted by Roman emperors, notably Alexander the Great and later Roman rulers, to signify divine power.\n        *   The figures are depicted in a non-naturalistic, formal, and hierarchical style. This departure from classical realism, with an emphasis on symbolism and power, is characteristic of Late Roman art.\n        *   Both figures appear to be wearing military attire, including a cuirass (breastplate).\n    3.  **Identify the specific artifact:** By searching for medallions or phalerae with two busts and ram's horns, the object can be identified as one of the famous \"Kerch phalerae.\" These artifacts were discovered in a 4th-century tomb near Kerch in Crimea. They are considered masterpieces of Late Roman metalwork.\n    4.  **Determine the archaeological dating:** The Kerch hoard, including this specific phalera, is consistently dated by archaeologists and art historians to the middle of the 4th century A.D. The figures are often identified as Emperor Constantius II (reigned 337â€“361 A.D.) and his co-emperor or a family member. The style is typical of the art produced during the Constantinian dynasty.\n    5.  **Answer the question:** The question asks for the century to which the medallion is ascribed. Based on the identification and archaeological consensus, the object dates to the 4th century A.D.\n\n*   **Careful points to consider:**\n    1.  **Iconography:** The ram's horns are a crucial clue, pointing towards imperial representation in the Late Roman period.\n    2.  **Artistic Style:** The stiff poses, large eyes, and stylized features are hallmarks of the shift in artistic conventions during the 3rd and 4th centuries A.D., moving away from classical naturalism.\n    3.  **Object Type:** Recognizing it as a phalera (a military decoration worn on the cuirass) helps place it in a Roman imperial context.\n    4.  **Archaeological Context:** The object is not an isolated find but part of a well-known hoard (the Kerch hoard), which provides a strong basis for its dating.\n\n*   **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    The analysis points conclusively to the 4th century A.D. The answer should be stated in the requested format.\n\n<<<4th century A.D.>>>"
