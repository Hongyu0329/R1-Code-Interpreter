    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the musical artist.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Venue**\nThe first step is to identify the building in the image. The architecture is quite distinctive, featuring red brickwork with a herringbone pattern, a large curved roofline on the left, a decorative quatrefoil emblem on a tan section of the wall, and an open second-story area with a white diamond-patterned lattice railing. A large semi-truck, typical for touring productions, is parked in front, suggesting it's a performance venue. A reverse image search using these architectural details identifies the building as the **Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox** in Spokane, Washington.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the Venue**\nTo be certain, we can compare the image with other photos of the Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox found online. A quick search confirms that all the unique architectural elements seen in the provided image match known photographs of this theater.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Event Schedule for the Specific Date**\nThe question asks for the musical artist who played at this venue on **October 12, 2023**. The next step is to search for the historical event calendar for the Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox. This can be done by checking the theater's official website, ticketing sites, or concert archive websites.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Performer**\nSearching for \"Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox events October 12, 2023\" leads to event listings for that date. The records show that the artist performing on that specific night was the **Goo Goo Dolls** on their \"The Big Night Out Tour\".\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Venue Identification:** Accurately identifying the venue is the most critical step. Misidentifying the building would make it impossible to answer correctly.\n*   **Date Specificity:** The answer must correspond to the exact date given in the question (Oct 12, 2023), not any other date.\n*   **Extraneous Information:** The fact that the photo was taken in 2024 is irrelevant to finding the performer from 2023; it's background context that should not distract from the core task.\n*   **Verification:** Relying on multiple sources to confirm the event and date is a good practice to ensure accuracy.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the musical artist.\n\n<<<Goo Goo Dolls>>>"
