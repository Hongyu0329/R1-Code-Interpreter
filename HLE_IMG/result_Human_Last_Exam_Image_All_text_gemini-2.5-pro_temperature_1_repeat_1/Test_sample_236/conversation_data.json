    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Observe the main subject:** The central focus of the image is an insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers.\n2.  **Identify the insect's characteristics:**\n    *   **Order:** The insect has a body shape, antennae, and wing structure characteristic of a \"true bug\" in the order Hemiptera. Specifically, you can see the triangular scutellum and the way the wings (hemelytra) cross over each other at the tips.\n    *   **Coloration:** The insect exhibits a striking black and orange/red pattern. The head is black. The pronotum (the section behind the head) is orange with a distinct black line running down the center. The wings are mostly black with orange borders along the outer edges.\n    *   **Appendages:** The legs and antennae are long, slender, and black.\n3.  **Identify the plant:** The insect is on a vibrant yellow flower head, which appears to be a species of Goldenrod (*Solidago*). This plant is a common food source and habitat for many insects in late summer and autumn.\n4.  **Synthesize information for identification:** We are looking for a true bug (Hemiptera) with a specific black and orange pattern (orange pronotum with a central black stripe, orange wing margins) that is commonly found on goldenrod.\n5.  **Compare with known species:**\n    *   This pattern does not match common look-alikes such as the Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*, which has a broad black band across its wings) or the Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus kalmii*, which has a red \"X\" on its back).\n    *   It also differs from the Goldenrod Soldier Beetle (*Chauliognathus pensylvanicus*), which is a beetle (Coleoptera) and has a different body structure and marking pattern.\n    *   The features strongly match the description of the Ragweed Plant Bug or Goldenrod Plant Bug. This insect is a member of the plant bug family Miridae.\n6.  **Confirm the scientific name:** The scientific name for the Ragweed Plant Bug/Goldenrod Plant Bug is *Lopidea media*. This species is known for its distinctive coloration and its frequent presence on goldenrod and ragweed.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   Pay close attention to the specific pattern of the coloration, as many insects share a black and orange/red warning coloration. The central black line on the orange pronotum and the orange wing margins are key diagnostic features.\n*   Distinguish the insect's order (Hemiptera - true bug) from other similar-colored insects like beetles (Coleoptera). The wing structure is the primary differentiator.\n*   The host plant (Goldenrod) provides a strong ecological clue that supports the identification.\n*   The question specifically asks for the scientific name, which consists of the genus and species.\n\n**Final Answer:** Based on the detailed visual analysis, the insect depicted is the Ragweed Plant Bug, and its scientific name is *Lopidea media*.\n\n<<<Lopidea media>>>"
