    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Objective:**\nTo calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) when shifting from the Baseline (Table 1) mode share to the Proposed (Table 2) mode share.\n\n**Methodology:**\n1.  Calculate a VMT Index for the Baseline scenario. The VMT Index is a proportional representation of the total VMT. It is calculated by summing the VMT contributions from each trip distance category.\n2.  Calculate a VMT Index for the Proposed scenario using the same method.\n3.  Calculate the percentage reduction using the formula: `((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100%`.\n\n**Formula for VMT Index Contribution per Distance Category:**\n`VMT Index Contribution = (Share of Total Trips) × (Total Car Mode Share) × (Average Trip Distance)`\n*   `Total Car Mode Share` is the sum of the mode shares for \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n\n---\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Calculate the Baseline Car VMT Index (Table 1)**\n\n*   **0-3 miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 48% (0.48)\n    *   Total car mode share: 25% + 28% = 53% (0.53)\n    *   Average trip distance: 1 mile\n    *   VMT Index contribution: `0.48 * 0.53 * 1 = 0.2544`\n\n*   **3-5 miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 22% (0.22)\n    *   Total car mode share: 38% + 43% = 81% (0.81)\n    *   Average trip distance: 4 miles\n    *   VMT Index contribution: `0.22 * 0.81 * 4 = 0.7128`\n\n*   **5-10 miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 14% (0.14)\n    *   Total car mode share: 40% + 45% = 85% (0.85)\n    *   Average trip distance: 7.5 miles\n    *   VMT Index contribution: `0.14 * 0.85 * 7.5 = 0.8925`\n\n*   **10+ miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 16% (0.16)\n    *   Total car mode share: 42% + 47% = 89% (0.89)\n    *   Average trip distance: 20 miles\n    *   VMT Index contribution: `0.16 * 0.89 * 20 = 2.8480`\n\n*   **Total Baseline Car VMT Index:**\n    *   `0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = 4.7077`\n\n---\n**2. Calculate the Proposed Car VMT Index (Table 2)**\n\n*   **0-3 miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 48% (0.48)\n    *   Total car mode share: 1% + 2% = 3% (0.03)\n    *   Average trip distance: 1 mile\n    *   VMT Index contribution: `0.48 * 0.03 * 1 = 0.0144`\n\n*   **3-5 miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 22% (0.22)\n    *   Total car mode share: 8% + 19% = 27% (0.27)\n    *   Average trip distance: 4 miles\n    *   VMT Index contribution: `0.22 * 0.27 * 4 = 0.2376`\n\n*   **5-10 miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 14% (0.14)\n    *   Total car mode share: 14% + 27% = 41% (0.41)\n    *   Average trip distance: 7.5 miles\n    *   VMT Index contribution: `0.14 * 0.41 * 7.5 = 0.4305`\n\n*   **10+ miles category:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 16% (0.16)\n    *   Total car mode share: 16% + 33% = 49% (0.49)\n    *   Average trip distance: 20 miles\n    *   VMT Index contribution: `0.16 * 0.49 * 20 = 1.5680`\n\n*   **Total Proposed Car VMT Index:**\n    *   `0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = 2.2505`\n\n---\n**3. Calculate the Percentage Reduction in Car VMT**\n\n*   **VMT Reduction:** `Baseline VMT Index - Proposed VMT Index`\n    *   `4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572`\n\n*   **Percentage Reduction:** `(VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT Index) * 100%`\n    *   `(2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100% ≈ 52.195%`\n\n*   **Rounding** to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The question is about **Car VMT**, so only the two rows for \"car\" modes are relevant. Other modes (transit, walk, etc.) are distractors for this specific calculation.\n*   The `Average Carpool Occupancy` data is not needed for calculating VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), as VMT is concerned with the vehicle's mileage, not the number of people in it. This data would be necessary for calculating Person Miles Traveled (PMT).\n*   The `Share of total trips` for each distance category must be used as a weighting factor.\n*   The `Total` columns in the tables are weighted summaries and should not be used in the step-by-step calculation, which is more precise when built from the disaggregated data.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
