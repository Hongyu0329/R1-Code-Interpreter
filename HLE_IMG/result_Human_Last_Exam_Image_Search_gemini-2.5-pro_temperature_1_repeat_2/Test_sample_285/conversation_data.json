    "A,C,D.\nA Delaunay triangulation is defined by the \"empty circle\" property: for every triangle in the triangulation, the unique circle passing through its three vertices (the circumcircle) must not contain any other points of the set in its interior. We can visually inspect each triangulation to see if any triangle violates this rule.\n\n*   **Triangulation A:** This triangulation contains several long, \"skinny\" triangles. Consider the two inner points and the top-left outer point. The triangle formed by these three points is obtuse. Its circumcircle would be large and would likely contain other vertices. A more formal way to see the violation is to look at the edge connecting the top-most vertex and the lower-inner vertex. This edge is part of a convex quadrilateral. The sum of the angles at the other two vertices of this quadrilateral (the top-left outer point and the upper-inner point) is greater than 180Â°, which means the configuration is not locally Delaunay.\n*   **Triangulation B:** This triangulation is composed of triangles that are more equiangular or \"fat\" compared to the others. Visually, for any given triangle, it appears that no other point from the set lies inside its circumcircle. This triangulation appears to satisfy the empty circle property and is likely the correct Delaunay triangulation.\n*   **Triangulation C:** This triangulation also contains \"skinny\" triangles. For example, consider the edge connecting the two inner points. This edge forms a convex quadrilateral with the two bottom-most outer vertices. The circumcircle of the triangle formed by the two inner points and the bottom-right vertex clearly contains the bottom-left vertex. Thus, it violates the empty circle property.\n*   **Triangulation D:** This triangulation has a very obvious violation. The large triangle connecting the top vertex with the two bottom corner vertices encloses all the other points of the set. Consequently, its circumcircle will also contain all those interior points, which is a clear violation of the empty circle property.\n\nTherefore, triangulations A, C, and D all violate the empty circle property.\n\n<<<A,C,D>>>"
