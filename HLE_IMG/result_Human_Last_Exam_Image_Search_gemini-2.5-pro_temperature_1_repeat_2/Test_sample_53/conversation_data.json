    "Based on the mythological scene depicted, the figure leaving the chariot is **Memnon**, the king of Aethiopia, being carried by his mother, Eos.\n\nThis ancient Greek vase is an Apulian red-figure pelike (a type of jar) attributed to the Policoro Painter, dating to approximately 400 B.C. The scene illustrates a poignant moment from the Trojan War.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the figures and the story:\n*   **The figure being carried from the chariot** is the body of Memnon. He was a great warrior who fought on the side of the Trojans and was killed in battle by the Greek hero Achilles. In the image, he is shown as a lifeless figure, wrapped in cloth.\n*   **The winged figure** driving the chariot and carrying Memnon is his mother, Eos, the goddess of the dawn. Greek art frequently depicts Eos retrieving her son's body from the battlefield of Troy to give him a proper burial. After his death, Eos’s tears were said to form the morning dew.\n*   **The figure on the ground** is a nameless fallen warrior, emphasizing the setting of a battlefield.\n\nThis specific theme, known as the \"Memnon Pietà,\" was a common subject in ancient Greek art, showcasing maternal grief and the tragedy of war."
