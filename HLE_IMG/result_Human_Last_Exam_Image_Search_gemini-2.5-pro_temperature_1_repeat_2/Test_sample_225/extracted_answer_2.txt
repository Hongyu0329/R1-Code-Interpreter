The product A is tris(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)methylium ion. The reaction with 0.1 M HCl under reflux for 12 hours causes the hydrolysis of the three methylene acetal bridges of the starting material. Each `-O-CHâ‚‚-O-` bridge is cleaved to form two hydroxyl (`-OH`) groups. This results in the formation of a trityl cation substituted with three 2,3-dihydroxyphenyl groups.
