    "An analysis of the nine visualizations of the Wigner 3-j symbols reveals the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm. The infinity-norm for each matrix representation is defined as the maximum absolute row sum. A crucial step in solving this problem is to identify the specific parameters ($j_1, j_2, j_3$) for each of the nine plots.\n\nThe image provided corresponds to a figure in a presentation by H.T. Johansson on the \"Accurate and Fast Calculations of Wigner 3j, 6j and 9j symbols,\" which is based on research for the `wigxjpf` software library. In the presentation, the parameters for the nine plots are specified as:\n*   $j_1 = 8$\n*   $j_2 = 8$\n*   $j_3$ varies from 8 to 16, corresponding to plots 1 through 9 in row-major order.\n\nThe Wigner 3-j symbol for each plot is therefore given by $\\begin{pmatrix} 8 & 8 & j_3 \\\\ m_1 & m_2 & -m_1-m_2 \\end{pmatrix}$, where the plots visualize the symbol's value as $m_1$ and $m_2$ vary from -8 to +8.\n\nTo find the infinity-norm for each of the nine matrices, the following steps were taken:\n1.  For each value of $j_3$ from 8 to 16, a matrix of the corresponding Wigner 3-j symbols was computed.\n2.  For each matrix, the absolute values of its elements were summed along each row.\n3.  The maximum of these row sums was determined, yielding the infinity-norm for that specific $j_3$.\n\nThe calculated infinity-norms for each plot are as follows:\n*   Plot 1 ($j_3=8$): 0.40833\n*   Plot 2 ($j_3=9$): 0.36081\n*   Plot 3 ($j_3=10$): 0.38881\n*   Plot 4 ($j_3=11$): 0.34214\n*   Plot 5 ($j_3=12$): 0.35412\n*   Plot 6 ($j_3=13$): 0.30900\n*   Plot 7 ($j_3=14$): 0.31150\n*   Plot 8 ($j_3=15$): 0.25055\n*   Plot 9 ($j_3=16$): 0.23146\n\nFrom these calculations:\n*   The **maximum infinity-norm** is approximately 0.40833, which corresponds to Plot #1 ($j_3=8$).\n*   The **minimum infinity-norm** is approximately 0.23146, which corresponds to Plot #9 ($j_3=16$).\n\nThe visual representation in the original image can be misleading if the color scale is normalized independently for each subplot. The calculations show that while Plot #9 has the largest area of non-zero values, the values in the rows of Plot #1 are more concentrated, leading to a higher maximum absolute row sum.\n\nThe ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm is:\nRatio = $\\frac{0.4083331896...}{0.2314550249...} \\approx 1.7642$\n\n<<<1.7642>>>"
