    "The user has provided an image of a chemical reaction and stated that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur. I need to identify what those two reactions are.\n\n**Reactants:**\n1.  Hexafluorobenzene (C6F6)\n2.  Cyclobutene (C4H4)\n\n**Product:**\nThe product is a bicyclic compound with a more complex fused-ring structure.\n\n**Analysis of the transformation:**\n\n1.  **First Reaction:** The reaction is initiated by light (hv), which suggests a photochemical reaction. Hexafluorobenzene is an aromatic compound. Under photochemical conditions, benzene and its derivatives can undergo isomerization. One such isomerization is the formation of Dewar benzene (a bicyclic isomer). In this case, hexafluorobenzene likely isomerizes to hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene. This is an **electrocyclic reaction**, specifically a [2+2] intramolecular cycloaddition which is photochemically allowed. Let's re-examine this. Aromatic rings can undergo valence isomerization. The conversion of benzene to Dewar benzene is a photochemically allowed [2+2] cycloaddition of two double bonds within the benzene ring. More accurately, this is a photochemically allowed 4π electron electrocyclic reaction, where two of the π-bonds of the benzene ring react to form a bicyclobutane-like structure. Let's verify this. A search for \"photochemical isomerization of benzene\" or \"benzene to dewar benzene mechanism\" would be helpful.\n\n2.  **Second Reaction:** The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, then reacts with cyclobutene. Let's analyze the structure of hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene. It is a bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene. This diene can then react with cyclobutene, which acts as a dienophile, in a cycloaddition reaction. The product shown is the result of a [2+2] cycloaddition between one of the double bonds of hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene and the double bond of cyclobutene. Photochemical [2+2] cycloadditions between two alkene systems are allowed pericyclic reactions.\n\nSo the two proposed steps are:\n1.  **Photochemical electrocyclic reaction:** Hexafluorobenzene undergoes a 4π electrocyclization to form hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene. This is a photochemically allowed process.\n2.  **Photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition:** The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, reacts with cyclobutene in a [2+2] cycloaddition to form the final product. This is also a photochemically allowed process.\n\nLet's refine the first step. The conversion of a 1,3,5-hexatriene system to a cyclohexadiene is a 6π electrocyclization. However, the conversion of benzene to Dewar benzene involves the formation of two new sigma bonds and the conversion of three π-bonds to two π-bonds and two σ-bonds. This is more complex. A simpler view is that two of the π-bonds of benzene react in a [2+2] fashion. However, a more accurate description of the valence isomerization of benzene to Dewar benzene under photochemical conditions is often described as a photochemically allowed electrocyclic reaction, but it is not a straightforward 4n or 4n+2 rule following reaction in the same way as open-chain polyenes. Let's call it a valence isomerization for now.\n\nLet's re-examine the first step based on the search results. The search results discuss photochemical electrocyclic reactions and cycloadditions. Result explicitly mentions the synthesis of Dewar Benzene via a photochemical 4-electron electrocyclic ring closure. This confirms the first step is likely a photochemical electrocyclic reaction.\n\nNow for the second step. The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (a bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene), reacts with cyclobutene. The product shows a new four-membered ring formed between one of the double bonds of the Dewar benzene derivative and the double bond of cyclobutene. This is a [2+2] cycloaddition. Photochemical [2+2] cycloadditions are well-known and allowed pericyclic reactions.\n\nTherefore, the two pericyclic reactions are:\n1.  A photochemical **electrocyclic reaction** (or valence isomerization) of hexafluorobenzene to form hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene.\n2.  A photochemical **[2+2] cycloaddition** between hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene and cyclobutene.\n\nLet's check if there's an alternative. Could it be a [4+2] cycloaddition? If hexafluorobenzene acted as a 4π component and cyclobutene as a 2π component, the product would be different. If Dewar benzene acted as a diene (4π component) and cyclobutene as a dienophile (2π component), this would be a Diels-Alder reaction. A Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition and is typically thermally allowed, not photochemically allowed. The product formed does not correspond to a [4+2] adduct.\n\nThe final product has a tricyclic core. Let's trace the atoms.\n- The hexafluorobenzene provides the bicyclo[2.2.0]hexane core.\n- The cyclobutene adds across one of the double bonds to form another four-membered ring.\nThis is consistent with a [2+2] cycloaddition onto an isomer of hexafluorobenzene.\n\nSo the sequence is:\n1.  Hexafluorobenzene -> Hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (photochemical electrocyclic reaction)\n2.  Hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene + Cyclobutene -> Final Product (photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition)\n\nThe question asks for the \"kind\" of pericyclic reactions. The two kinds are electrocyclic reaction and cycloaddition. Specifically, a [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\nThe transformation involves two distinct photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions.\nThe first is an **electrocyclic reaction** where hexafluorobenzene undergoes a valence isomerization to form hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene. This is a photochemically allowed 4π-electron process.\nThe second reaction is a **[2+2] cycloaddition**. The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, then reacts with cyclobutene through a photochemically allowed [2+2] cycloaddition to yield the final product.\n\nBoth reactions fall under the general category of pericyclic reactions that are allowed under photochemical conditions according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.The transformation shown involves two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions.\n\nThe first reaction is a **photochemical electrocyclic reaction**. Under the influence of light (hv), hexafluorobenzene undergoes a valence isomerization to form hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene. This type of 4π electron ring closure is a photochemically allowed process.\n\nThe second reaction is a **photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition**. The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, which is a diene, then reacts with cyclobutene. This reaction is a cycloaddition where a π-bond from the Dewar benzene and the π-bond from cyclobutene react to form a new four-membered ring, resulting in the final product. This [2+2] cycloaddition is also a photochemically allowed pericyclic reaction.\n\nBoth of these reactions are governed by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for pericyclic reactions under photochemical conditions.\n\n<<<The two pericyclic reactions involved are a photochemical electrocyclic reaction and a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition.>>>"
