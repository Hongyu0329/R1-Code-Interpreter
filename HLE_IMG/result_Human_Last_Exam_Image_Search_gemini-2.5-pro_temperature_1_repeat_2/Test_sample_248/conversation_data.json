    "The assemblage of organisms in the photo, particularly the barnacles and periwinkle snails, is characteristic of a North Atlantic rocky intertidal zone. Several species visible are strong indicators of an Atlantic coast location.\n\nThe species that most definitively indicates the photo was taken on the Atlantic rather than the Pacific Coast is the Northern Rock Barnacle, *Semibalanus balanoides*.\n\n*   ***Semibalanus balanoides*** **(Northern Rock Barnacle):** The numerous barnacles covering the rock are consistent in appearance with this species. *S. balanoides* is a dominant barnacle in the intertidal zones of the North Atlantic, found on both its European and North American shores. Its range on the North American Atlantic coast extends as far south as Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Crucially, while it is found on the Pacific coast, its range there only extends as far south as British Columbia, making its presence alongside the other species pictured a clear indicator of an Atlantic location, likely from New England northward.\n\nOther species in the photograph support this conclusion:\n\n*   ***Littorina littorea*** **(Common Periwinkle):** The small, dark snails are readily identifiable as the common periwinkle. This species is native to Europe and was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast around 1840. It is now a very common, and often dominant, grazer on rocky shores from Labrador, Canada, down to states like New Jersey and Delaware. While there have been isolated reports of *L. littorea* on the Pacific coast, it has not established sustained populations there. Therefore, its high abundance in the photo strongly suggests an Atlantic location.\n\n*   ***Nucella lapillus*** **(Atlantic Dogwinkle):** The larger, light-colored snail could be a dogwinkle. *Nucella lapillus* is a carnivorous snail native to the rocky shores of the North Atlantic and is not found on the Pacific coast. It is a known predator of barnacles and mussels, fitting perfectly into the ecological scene shown.\n\nThe combination of these species—a classic community of *Semibalanus*, *Littorina*, and likely *Nucella*—is a hallmark of the North Atlantic rocky intertidal ecosystem. However, *Semibalanus balanoides* provides the most definitive single-species evidence due to its well-established, non-overlapping southern distribution limit on the Atlantic coast compared to the Pacific.\n\n<<<Semibalanus balanoides>>>"
