    "The chemical transformation shown in the image involves two main steps. The first is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, and the second is the formation of a substituted imidazole ring.\n\nThe first reaction shows n-butylbenzene reacting with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) to produce 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This product is an α-haloketone.\n\nThe second reaction takes this α-haloketone and reacts it with an unknown reactant in dimethylformamide (DMF) at room temperature to yield a complex product, which is a 2-aminoimidazole derivative. Specifically, the product is *tert*-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1*H*-imidazole-1-carboxylate.\n\nTo form this product, the α-haloketone must react with a molecule that provides the N1-C2(NH₂)-N3 portion of the imidazole ring. This molecular fragment is characteristic of guanidine (H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂).\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the final product:\n*   The 4-butylphenyl group at position C4 and the hydrogen at C5 come from the α-haloketone.\n*   The 2-amino group (-NH₂) at C2 and the ring nitrogens (N1 and N3) come from a guanidine derivative.\n*   The *tert*-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group is attached to the N1 position of the imidazole ring.\n\nThe formation of 2-aminoimidazoles from the condensation of α-haloketones with guanidine is a well-established reaction. However, the product in the image has a Boc protecting group on the N1 nitrogen and a free amino group at the C2 position. This specific substitution pattern suggests that a protected guanidine derivative is used as the reactant.\n\nThe most likely reactant is **N,N'-Bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**, which is also known as N,N'-di-Boc-guanidine. The structure of this molecule is HN=C(NHCO₂C(CH₃)₃)₂.\n\nThe proposed reaction mechanism is as follows:\n1.  One of the N-Boc groups of N,N'-di-Boc-guanidine attacks the carbon bearing the bromine atom in the α-haloketone. This nitrogen becomes N1 of the imidazole ring.\n2.  The central imine (=NH) nitrogen then attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. This nitrogen becomes N3.\n3.  A cyclization and dehydration sequence follows to form the imidazole ring.\n4.  The second N-Boc group, now attached to the C2 position, is selectively cleaved under the reaction conditions or during workup, leaving the free 2-amino group. The Boc group on the N1 position, which is part of a more stable carbamate, remains intact.\n\nTherefore, the reactant needed for this transformation is N,N'-Bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\n<<<N,N'-Bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
