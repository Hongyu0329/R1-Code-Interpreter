    "The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image fragment is identified as Sö 179, also known as the Gripsholm Runestone.\n\nThe inscription on the stone contains the sequence of runes \"...lit : raisa : stain...\" which is visible in the provided image. A full transliteration of the visible and surrounding text is: \"× tula : lit : raisa : stain : þinsa| |at : sun : sin : haralt : bruþur : inkuars\".\n\nThis translates to: \"Tóla had this stone raised in memory of her son Haraldr, Ingvarr's brother\". The inscription goes on to say that they were part of Ingvar the Far-Travelled's expedition, traveled far for gold, and ultimately died in the south in Serkland (likely the land of the Saracens).\n\nThe Gripsholm Runestone is one of about 26 Ingvar Runestones, which were raised to commemorate those who died during a Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled around 1036-1041. This particular stone was discovered in the early 1820s built into the foundation of Gripsholm Castle. It is now located near the castle in Mariefred, Södermanland, Sweden.\n\n<<<Sö 179>>>"
