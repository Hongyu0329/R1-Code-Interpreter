    "The timestamps of the synchronized bursts are identified by the dense vertical bands of firing activity across many electrodes. Based on the graph, these bursts are centered at approximately:\n*   Burst 1: 3 s\n*   Burst 2: 15 s\n*   Burst 3: 26 s\n*   Burst 4: 37 s\n*   Burst 5: 49 s\n\nThe inter-burst intervals (the time between the centers of consecutive bursts) are:\n*   Interval 1: 15 s - 3 s = 12 s\n*   Interval 2: 26 s - 15 s = 11 s\n*   Interval 3: 37 s - 26 s = 11 s\n*   Interval 4: 49 s - 37 s = 12 s\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is calculated as follows:\nAverage interval = (12 s + 11 s + 11 s + 12 s) / 4 = 46 s / 4 = 11.5 s\n\nRounding to two significant figures, the average inter-burst interval is 12 s.\n\n<<<12>>>"
