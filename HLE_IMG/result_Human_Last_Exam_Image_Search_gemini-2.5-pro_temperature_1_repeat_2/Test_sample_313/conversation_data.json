    "The individual \"X Y\" in the photograph is a metaphorical **Mad Hatter**. This connects to the two clues provided.\n\n**The Pictured \"Mad Hatter\"**\nThe man pictured receiving an award is professional hockey goaltender Robin Lehner. The photo was taken at the 2019 NHL Awards on June 19, 2019, where he won the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy. Lehner has been a vocal advocate for mental health awareness, openly discussing his own struggles with bipolar disorder, addiction, and PTSD. In his acceptance speech, he famously stated, \"I'm not ashamed to say I'm mentally ill, but that doesn't mean I'm mentally weak,\" making him a powerful, modern, and metaphorical \"Mad Hatter\" who has channelled his personal battles into a positive message.\n\n**The Historical \"Mad Hatter\"**\nThe second clue refers to the origin of the phrase \"mad as a hatter\". This expression arose from the hat-making industry of the 18th and 19th centuries, where mercury salts, specifically mercuric nitrate, were used in a process called \"carroting\" to produce felt from animal fur. Hat makers, or \"hatters,\" suffered from chronic mercury poisoning due to prolonged exposure to mercury vapors. This led to a neurological disorder called erethism, with symptoms including tremors (known as \"hatter's shakes\" or \"Danbury shakes\"), personality changes, and delirium, causing them to appear \"mad\". The use of mercury in felt production has long been discontinued due to its toxicity.\n\nThus, Robin Lehner represents a contemporary, figurative \"Mad Hatter,\" celebrated for his perseverance through mental illness, while the clue about mercury toxicity points to the historical, literal \"Mad Hatter,\" a profession rendered obsolete by its hazardous nature.\n\n<<<Mad Hatter>>>"
