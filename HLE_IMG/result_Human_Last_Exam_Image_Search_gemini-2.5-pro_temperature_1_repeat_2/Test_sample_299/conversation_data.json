    "The two-move checkmate for White is as follows:\n\n**1. Rxe5+**\n\nThis move puts the black king in check. The rook is protected by the white queen on a4, so the king cannot capture it. Black's only legal move is to move the king. The squares d4 and f5 are controlled by the white queen and knight respectively. Therefore, Black is forced to play:\n\n**1... Kd3**\n\nNow, White delivers the final blow:\n\n**2. Qd1#**\n\nThis is checkmate. The black king on d3 is attacked by the queen on d1 and has no escape squares. All potential squares it could move to are controlled by White's pieces:\n*   **c2:** Covered by the knight on b7.\n*   **c3 and c4:** Covered by the pawn on b4.\n*   **d2 and e3:** Covered by the bishop on g1.\n*   **e2 and e3:** Covered by the knight on e7.\n*   **e4:** Covered by the rook on e5.\n*   **d4:** Covered by the queen on a4.\n\n<<<1. Rxe5+ Kd3 2. Qd1#>>>"
