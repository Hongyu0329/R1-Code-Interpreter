    "The epiphytic species in the image appears to be a type of liverwort. Based on its dark, net-like growth pattern on the tree bark, it is likely a member of the genus *Radula*. Specifically, it resembles *Radula holtii*, commonly known as Holt's Scalewort.\n\nThis organism is a leafy liverwort, a type of bryophyte, and is not a fungus, lichen, or sooty mold. While sooty mold can also appear as a blackish layer on tree bark, it is a type of fungus that grows on the sugary excretions of insects or sap and typically has a more powdery or crusty appearance. The organism in the photo displays a more structured, branching, and flattened form characteristic of a leafy liverwort.\n\nLichens, which are a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and an alga, can also be epiphytic and come in various forms, including crust-like (crustose), leafy (foliose), or hair-like (fruticose). However, the intricate, net-like pattern seen in the image is distinct from the typical appearance of most common epiphytic lichens.\n\nThe genus *Radula* encompasses numerous species of liverworts found worldwide. These plants are epiphytes, meaning they grow on other plants for physical support without being parasitic. They absorb moisture and nutrients from the atmosphere and their immediate surroundings on the bark.\n\n<<<Radula>>>"
