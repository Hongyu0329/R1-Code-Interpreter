    "While some advertisements used the slogan \"Women are winning the War of Freedom\" for products like Tampax, the product that fits the description of having a French-derived name and claiming to help workers overcome \"inherent limitations\" is the cosmetics brand **Bourjois**.\n\nDuring World War II, the French cosmetics company Bourjois ran a campaign in Britain that featured women working in munitions factories. The advertisements acknowledged the vital role women played in the war effort but also suggested that using their beauty products, such as \"Evening in Paris\" face powder, could help them overcome the unfeminine nature of their work and maintain their morale. This messaging played into the broader wartime narrative that maintaining personal appearance and femininity was a patriotic duty.\n\n<<<Bourjois>>>"
