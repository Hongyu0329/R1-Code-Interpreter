    "To identify the correct crystal lattice pattern, we need to understand the atomic arrangement of a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure when viewed from different crystallographic directions.\n\n*   **FCC Structure:** In an FCC unit cell, atoms are located at each of the eight corners and in the center of all six faces.\n*   ** Direction:** Viewing along the direction (down one of the axes) reveals a square pattern with an atom in the center. This corresponds to the arrangement seen in image **D**.\n*   ** Direction:** Viewing along the direction (a body diagonal) shows a hexagonal pattern. This corresponds to the arrangement seen in image **C**.\n*   ** Direction:** Viewing along the direction (a face diagonal) results in a rectangular pattern with an atom in the center of the rectangle. This centered rectangular arrangement is characteristic of the FCC (110) surface. Looking at the provided options, image **B** displays this specific centered rectangular pattern of atoms.\n\nImage A shows a simple rectangular pattern without a centering atom, which is not characteristic of an FCC view.\n\nTherefore, image B correctly represents a face-centered cubic structure viewed along the direction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
