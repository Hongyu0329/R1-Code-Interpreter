    "The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that helps distinguish both species at a glance is the shape of the seta.\n\nIn *Grimmia montana*, the seta, the stalk that supports the capsule, is typically short and straight or erect.\n\nIn contrast, the seta of *Grimmia curviseta* is often curved or arcuate. While it can sometimes be straight, the presence of a curved seta is a distinguishing characteristic for this species and its close relatives. A key to European *Grimmia* species notes that the seta can be erect, curved, or S-shaped in species with capsules just slightly longer than the seta.\n\nTherefore, upon observation of the sporophyte, a straight, erect seta would suggest *Grimmia montana*, while a curved or S-shaped seta would strongly indicate *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n<<<The shape of the seta: straight and erect in *Grimmia montana* versus often curved or arcuate in *Grimmia curviseta*.>>>"
