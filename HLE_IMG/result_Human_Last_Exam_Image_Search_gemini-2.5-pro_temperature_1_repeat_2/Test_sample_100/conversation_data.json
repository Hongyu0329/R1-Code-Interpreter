    "The reaction scheme involves three sequential steps to transform the starting material into the final product. To determine the molecular formula of the product, we can track the changes in atomic composition at each stage.\n\n**Step 1: Deprotection with CAN**\n\nThe initial reaction uses Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in a mixture of acetonitrile (ACN) and water. CAN is a well-known oxidizing agent frequently used to remove the *p*-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group from nitrogen atoms. This step cleaves the bond between the nitrogen and the PMB group (-CH₂-C₆H₄-OCH₃).\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting compound is 2-(p-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. Its molecular formula is C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂.\n*   **Change:** The PMB group (C₈H₉O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen. This results in a net loss of C₈H₈O.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The molecular formula becomes C₇H₆F₃NO. The structure is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n\n**Step 2: Catalytic Hydrogenation**\n\nIntermediate 1 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium on carbon catalyst (Pd/C) in methanol (MeOH). This is a standard catalytic hydrogenation reaction that reduces the carbon-carbon double bond.\n\n*   **Intermediate 1:** C₇H₆F₃NO\n*   **Change:** Two hydrogen atoms are added across the C=C double bond.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The molecular formula becomes C₇H₈F₃NO. The structure is the saturated lactam, 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n\n**Step 3: Acid Hydrolysis**\n\nFinally, Intermediate 2 is heated with 4 N hydrochloric acid (HCl). These conditions cause the hydrolysis of the lactam (a cyclic amide). A molecule of water is added across the amide bond, breaking the ring.\n\n*   **Intermediate 2:** C₇H₈F₃NO\n*   **Change:** One molecule of water (H₂O) is added to the structure. This opens the lactam ring to form an amino acid, which contains both a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and an amino group (-NH₂).\n*   **Final Product:** The molecular formula becomes C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂.\n\nThe final product is an amino acid with a substituted cyclopentane skeleton. The molecular formula is derived by systematically accounting for the atoms lost and gained in each reaction step.\n\n<<<C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂>>>"
