    "To determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Path√©tique\" Sonata, a harmonic analysis is required.\n\nThe key signature for this movement is C minor. Measure 30 contains the notes G, B-natural, D, and F-sharp. These notes form a G major 7th chord (Gmaj7). The G serves as the dominant scale degree in the key of C minor. The B-natural is the raised leading tone, which is common for a dominant function chord in a minor key. The F-sharp, however, is a chromatic alteration. The diatonic seventh of the dominant chord would be F-natural, creating a G dominant 7th chord (V7) that resolves to the tonic, C minor.\n\nInstead, Beethoven uses an F-sharp. This creates a G major 7th chord, which still functions as the dominant. In Roman numeral analysis, this chord is represented as **V M7** or **Vmaj7**. The \"V\" indicates it is built on the fifth degree of the scale, and \"M7\" (or \"maj7\") specifies that the seventh of the chord is a major seventh above the root.\n\nAdditionally, some analyses point to the use of an augmented 6th chord in this passage, specifically in measure 30. An augmented 6th chord is a chromatic chord that contains the interval of an augmented sixth and typically resolves to the dominant. The notes in measure 30 (G-B-D-F#) can be enharmonically reinterpreted to form an augmented 6th chord, though its primary analysis remains a dominant chord with a chromatic alteration. The overall passage is part of a transition that firmly establishes the key of C minor through the use of dominant (V) chords.\n\n<<<V M7>>>"
