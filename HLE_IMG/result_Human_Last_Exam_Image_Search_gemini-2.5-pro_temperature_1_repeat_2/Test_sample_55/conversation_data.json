The G-sharp in the circled chord is the leading tone to A. Therefore, the G#°7 chord functions as the leading-tone seventh chord of the dominant chord. This is known as a secondary or applied dominant.\n*   **Roman Numeral:** The Roman numeral for a leading-tone diminished seventh chord of the dominant is written as vii°7/V. It creates a strong pull towards the dominant chord, which appears in the following measure.\n\n<<<vii°7/V>>>"
