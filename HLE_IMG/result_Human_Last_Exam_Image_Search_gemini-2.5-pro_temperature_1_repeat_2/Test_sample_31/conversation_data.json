    "The knot depicted in the image is the pretzel knot P(2, 3, 5). A pretzel knot is denoted by P(p, q, r), where p, q, and r represent the number of half-twists in each of the three strands. In the given image, there are three sets of twists with 2, 3, and 5 crossings, respectively. Assuming they are all right-handed twists, the knot is P(2, 3, 5).\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant, denoted as s(K) for a knot K, is an integer-valued knot concordance invariant. For the pretzel knot P(p, q, r), there are established methods and some explicit calculations for its s-invariant.\n\nThe knot P(2, 3, 5) is the mirror image of P(-2, -3, -5). The Rasmussen invariant of the mirror of a knot, denoted K', is given by s(K') = -s(K). Calculations and theorems for pretzel knots often focus on cases with negative parameters. For instance, the pretzel knot P(-2, 3, 5) is also identified as the (3,5) torus knot.\n\nBased on available research and knot theory databases, the Rasmussen invariant s for the P(2, 3, 5) pretzel knot is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
