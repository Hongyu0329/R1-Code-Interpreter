    "The image displays the crystal structure of the **complex between human SENP1 (Sentrin-specific protease 1) and SUMO-1 (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier 1)**.\n\nSpecifically, this is the structure of a mutant form of SENP1 (C603S) in complex with SUMO-1, which has been determined by X-ray diffraction. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) identifier for this particular structure is 2G4D.\n\nIn this structural representation:\n*   The larger, dark blue portion represents the catalytic domain of SENP1. SENP1 is a cysteine protease responsible for processing SUMO precursors and removing SUMO from target proteins, a process called deSUMOylation. The catalytic triad of SENP1 consists of the amino acids Cys603, His533, and Asp550.\n*   The smaller, light blue portion is the SUMO-1 protein. SUMO-1 is a small protein that can be attached to other cellular proteins to modify their function.\n*   The interaction between SENP1 and SUMO-1 is crucial for regulating various cellular processes, including nuclear metabolism and cell cycle progression. Structural studies of this complex help in understanding the mechanism of SUMO processing and deconjugation.\n\n<<<Complex between human SENP1 and SUMO-1>>>"
