    "The characters on the seal are written in a traditional, stylized script known as seal script (篆书, zhuànshū). Reading from top to bottom and right to left, the characters are 嘉慶御覽.\n\nIn simplified Chinese, the characters are:\n*   **嘉 (jiā):** Meaning \"fine,\" \"good,\" or \"praiseworthy.\"\n*   **庆 (qìng):** The simplified form of 慶, meaning \"to celebrate\" or \"blessing.\"\n*   **御 (yù):** Meaning \"imperial\" or \"for the emperor's use.\"\n*   **览 (lǎn):** The simplified form of 覽, meaning \"to look at\" or \"to view.\"\n\nTogether, **嘉庆御览 (Jiāqìng Yùlǎn)** translates to \"Viewed by the Jiaqing Emperor.\" The Jiaqing Emperor was the seventh emperor of the Qing dynasty, reigning from 1796 to 1820. Seals with this inscription, such as the \"嘉庆御览之宝\" (Treasure for the Jiaqing Emperor's Inspection), were often used on pieces of art and calligraphy that the emperor had personally appreciated.\n\n<<<嘉庆御览>>>"
