    "The phenomenon illustrated by the spectrogram and waveform is known as the **auditory continuity illusion**. A more general term for this effect is **perceptual restoration**.\n\nThis auditory illusion occurs when a sound, such as a pure tone, is interrupted by a short burst of a different sound, typically noise. If the interrupting noise is sufficiently loud, the brain perceptually \"fills in\" the missing portion of the original sound. The listener, therefore, perceives the tone as being continuous and uninterrupted, as if it were continuing behind the noise.\n\nThe comparison to the Necker Cube is apt because both create a perceptual ambiguity where the observer's perception can alternate between two possible interpretations. In the case of the Necker Cube, the brain switches between two different 3D orientations. In the auditory continuity illusion, the brain resolves the ambiguity of an interrupted tone by favoring the interpretation of a continuous sound being momentarily masked by another, rather than the physically correct interpretation of one sound stopping and another starting. This perceptual \"repair\" is an unconscious process that demonstrates the brain's tendency to maintain the continuity of sounds, a vital skill for understanding speech and music in noisy environments.\n\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion>>>"
