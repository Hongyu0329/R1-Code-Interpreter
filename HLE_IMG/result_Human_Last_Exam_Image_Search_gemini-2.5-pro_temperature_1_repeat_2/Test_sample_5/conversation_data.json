    "This is a piano arrangement of \"U.N. Owen Was Her?\", which is the theme song for the character Flandre Scarlet from the video game *Touhou Project 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil*.\n\nThe distinctive opening melody, which is a rising G major scale (G-A-B-C-D-E-F#), is a well-known characteristic of the piece.
