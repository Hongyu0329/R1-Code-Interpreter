    "The knot in the image is known as the 9_42 knot. Its Jones polynomial, denoted as p(t), is:\n\nt^10 - t^9 + 2t^8 - 2t^7 + 2t^6 - 3t^5 + 3t^4 - 2t^3 + t^2 - t + 1\n\nIt is interesting to note that the 9_42 knot is a chiral knot, however, its chirality is not detected by many common knot polynomials, including the Jones polynomial. This means the Jones polynomial for the knot and its mirror image are the same.\n\n<<<$t^{10} - t^9 + 2t^8 - 2t^7 + 2t^6 - 3t^5 + 3t^4 - 2t^3 + t^2 - t + 1$>>>"
