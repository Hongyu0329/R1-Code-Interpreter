    "**The square ancient structure is the ruins of the Davis-Herrera homestead, a significant historical site in Presidio County, Texas.**\n\nLocated at the coordinates 29° 06' 18.75''N and 103° 47' 50.28''W, the structure is situated in the former settlement of Alamito, which was later known as Plata. This area, along Alamito Creek, has been a historically significant passageway since prehistoric times and was a stop on the Chihuahua Trail.\n\nThe homestead was established in 1870 by John Davis, a pioneer from North Carolina, and his wife Francisca Herrera, the daughter of one of the first Spanish settlers in the area. They built a large adobe house, a chapel, and a one-room school, creating a small community. The settlement was a well-known stopping place for travelers on the Chihuahua Trail, offering food, water, and even peach brandy made by Davis.\n\nToday, the most prominent remaining feature of the settlement is the ruins of the Davis-Herrera home. The adobe walls of the house are still relatively intact, and a protective metal canopy has been erected over them to prevent further erosion. This matches the appearance of the structure in the provided satellite image.\n\n**Yes, it is a historic landmark.**\n\nThe site of Alamito, including the ruins of the Davis-Herrera homestead, is recognized as a significant historical location. A Texas Historical Commission marker was dedicated on May 13, 2000, near the homesite on Farm-to-Market Road 169. The marker details the history of the community, the Chihuahua Trail, and the Davis-Herrera family. The Center for Big Bend Studies has also been involved in the study and preservation of the site. The area around Alamito, including the ghost towns of Plata and Casa Piedra, is a point of interest for those exploring the history of the Old West in Texas.\n\n<<<The square ancient structure shown in the image is the ruins of the Davis-Herrera homestead, located in the historic settlement of Alamito (later Plata) in Presidio County, Texas. It is a recognized historic landmark.>>>"
