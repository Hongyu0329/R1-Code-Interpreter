    "The tiling shown in the image has multiple rotational symmetries, with the highest order being 8-fold. This is evident from the presence of large, regular octagons in a dark blue color.\n\nBy examining the image, one can identify several points around which the pattern can be rotated while maintaining its appearance:\n*   **8-fold symmetry:** The center of each large, dark blue octagon acts as a point of 8-fold rotational symmetry. Rotating the tiling by 45 degrees (360/8) around this point leaves the pattern unchanged. Tilings with this property are often referred to as having eight-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   **4-fold symmetry:** The center of each light brown square is a point of 4-fold rotational symmetry. The pattern remains the same after a 90-degree (360/4) rotation around this point.\n*   **2-fold symmetry:** At the vertices where two blue octagons and a light brown square meet, there is a 2-fold rotational symmetry. A 180-degree (360/2) rotation around this point results in the same pattern.\n\nThe pattern is a type of octagonal tiling, composed of regular octagons, squares, and rhombi that fill the spaces between them. While it has centers of 2-fold, 4-fold, and 8-fold rotation, the overall rotational symmetry of a tiling is typically defined by the highest order of symmetry present.\n\n<<<8-fold>>>"
