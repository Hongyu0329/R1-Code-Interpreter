    "Based on the visual characteristics and information about silicate minerals, the specimens are identified and ordered by increasing silicate structure complexity as follows:\n\n*   **Specimen C: Olivine**\n    The granular aggregate of olive-green crystals is characteristic of olivine. Olivine is a **nesosilicate** (also called orthosilicate), which consists of isolated silica tetrahedra (SiO₄). This represents the simplest silicate structure.\n\n*   **Specimen A: Augite (a Pyroxene)**\n    This dark, stout, prismatic crystal is identified as augite, a common member of the pyroxene group. Pyroxenes are **inosilicates** (single-chain silicates), where silica tetrahedra link together to form long single chains. This structure is more complex than the isolated tetrahedra of nesosilicates.\n\n*   **Specimen B: Mica (or Chlorite)**\n    The flaky, layered appearance of this green mineral is distinctive of sheet silicates like mica or chlorite. These are **phyllosilicates**, in which the silica tetrahedra share three oxygen atoms to form continuous two-dimensional sheets. This sheet structure is more polymerized and complex than the single chains of inosilicates.\n\n*   **Specimen D: Quartz**\n    The translucent, hexagonal crystal form is a hallmark of quartz. Quartz is a **tectosilicate**, or framework silicate. In this structure, every oxygen atom of a silica tetrahedron is shared with a neighboring tetrahedron, creating a complete three-dimensional framework. This represents the most complex silicate structure.\n\nThe order of increasing silicate structure complexity is determined by the degree of polymerization of the silica tetrahedra: isolated tetrahedra -> single chains -> sheets -> framework.\n\nTherefore, the correct order is:\n**C (Olivine) → A (Augite) → B (Mica) → D (Quartz)**\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
