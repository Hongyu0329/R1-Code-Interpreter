    "A city with a coat of arms that is very similar to the one in the attached image is likely located in the historical region of Kashubia in Pomerania, with strong ties to the city of **Bytów, Poland**.\n\nThe coat of arms in the image, featuring a shield divided horizontally with a crescent moon on a blue field and a crab on a gold field, bears a striking resemblance to the heraldic symbols of the noble Kashubian family of **Rekowski**. This family has historical roots in the area around Bytów.\n\nWhile the official coat of arms of the city of Bytów itself is different, displaying a white, two-towered castle, the elements in the provided image are prominent in the various branches of the Rekowski family crests. Several documented versions of the Rekowski coat of arms include a crab, often red, and a crescent moon with stars on fields of varying colors, including blue and silver or gold.\n\nFor instance, one variant of the Rekowski family crest, known as \"Rekowski VI,\" features a shield divided into three horizontal stripes. The middle blue stripe contains a red crab, and the bottom silver stripe displays a golden crescent moon with stars. The name \"Rekowski\" itself is believed to be derived from the village of Rekowo, and the Polish word \"rak\" means crab, suggesting a canting arms element.\n\nGiven the strong association of the crab and crescent moon symbols with the Rekowski family, who were significant landowners in the Bytów region (formerly Bütow in German), it is highly probable that the coat of arms in the image is a modern interpretation or a specific version belonging to a branch of this family, rather than the official emblem of the city of Bytów itself. Nevertheless, the historical and heraldic connection points directly to the Bytów area in Kashubia.\n\n<<<Bytów, Poland>>>"
