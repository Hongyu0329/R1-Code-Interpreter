    "The plant in the image is most likely ***Daphniphyllum macropodum***, a shrub or small tree notable for its large, glossy leaves with prominent veins and purplish-red stalks.\n\nThis species is not endemic to a single island. Its native range includes China, Korea, and several islands of Japan (Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and the Ryukyu Islands), as well as small populations in the southern Kuril Islands.\n\nHowever, the question specifies a single island. While the plant is not strictly endemic to one island, it is a significant component of the flora of **Yakushima Island**, Japan. Yakushima is a Natural World Heritage site recognized for its unique ecosystem and high biodiversity, which includes ancient cedar trees and many endemic plant species. *Daphniphyllum macropodum* is a common tree in the forests of Yakushima.\n\nAnother closely related species, *Daphniphyllum teijsmannii*, is found on Tokunoshima Island, another of Japan's World Natural Heritage sites, where it is a characteristic tall tree in the island's forests. Like *D. macropodum*, its range extends beyond this single island, including mainland Japan, the Ryukyu Islands, and Taiwan.\n\nGiven that *Daphniphyllum macropodum* is a strong visual match and is prominently found on the famous island of Yakushima, this is the most likely intended answer, despite the precise biological definition of \"endemic\" not being met.\n\n<<<Yakushima Island>>>"
