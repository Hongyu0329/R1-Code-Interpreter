    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip, one must analyze the distances between consecutive R-waves, which represent the time between ventricular contractions.\n\n### Analysis of the ECG Strip:\n\n1.  **ECG Paper Speed**: The strip indicates a paper speed of 25 mm/sec. This is a standard speed where each small 1 mm square on the horizontal axis represents 0.04 seconds, and each large 5 mm square represents 0.2 seconds.\n\n2.  **Identifying the R-R Interval**: The R-R interval is the time elapsed between two successive R-waves (the highest peaks of the QRS complex).\n\n3.  **Locating the Longest Interval**: By visually scanning the entire rhythm strip, a noticeably long pause is present in the fourth row, starting after the timestamp `0:06:08`. This pause occurs between the second and third QRS complexes in that particular line.\n\n4.  **Measuring and Calculating the Interval**:\n    *   By counting the large squares between the peaks of the two R-waves surrounding the pause, we can measure the interval.\n    *   The distance is approximately 8 large squares.\n    *   To calculate the time in seconds, we multiply the number of large squares by the time per large square: 8 large squares Ã— 0.2 seconds/large square = 1.6 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the longest R-R interval on this rhythm strip is 1.6 seconds.\n\n<<<1.6>>>"
