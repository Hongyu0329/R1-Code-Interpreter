His style was known for being wild and expressive, often depicting the landscapes of Shaanxi Province.\n3.  **Mao Zedong (毛泽东):** The top-right calligraphy, featuring bold, cursive script of a classical poem, is in the style of Mao Zedong, who was a noted calligrapher. The text is likely from a classical poem, a common subject for his calligraphic works.\n\n**Middle Row (Left to Right):**\n\n4.  **Qi Gong (启功):** The calligraphy in the middle-left, with its fluid and elegant running script, is attributed to Qi Gong, one of the most celebrated calligraphers of the 20th century. The inscription \"丁酉夏日\" (Summer of Dingyou Year) dates the work, likely to 1957.\n5.  **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊):** The central piece is the renowned oil painting \"**Young Singer**\" (青年歌手) or \"**Youth**\" (1984) by Jin Shangyi. A masterwork of Neoclassical Realism in China, it famously depicts Peng Liyuan, who would later become the First Lady of China, against the backdrop of a traditional landscape painting.\n6.  **Lin Fengmian (林风眠):** The painting of a woman in profile with a distinctive headdress and sparrows in the background is a signature work of Lin Fengmian. He was a pioneer of modern Chinese art who masterfully fused Western and Eastern styles, with elegant women being one of his recurring themes.\n\n**Bottom Row (Left to Right):**\n\n7.  **Han Meilin (韩美林):** The colorful and lively scene of gourds and laundry is in the distinct style of Han Meilin, an artist celebrated for his vibrant works depicting animals and rural life. The painting is dated 1999.\n8.  **Li Keran (李可染):** The bottom-middle landscape showing boats with red sails navigating through dramatic mountains is a classic example of Li Keran's work. He is acclaimed for his revolutionary landscapes, particularly his atmospheric depictions of the Li River, which often feature this powerful composition and use of ink.\n9.  **Lou Shibai (娄师白):** The painting of a lobster is by Lou Shibai, a prominent student of the master Qi Baishi.
