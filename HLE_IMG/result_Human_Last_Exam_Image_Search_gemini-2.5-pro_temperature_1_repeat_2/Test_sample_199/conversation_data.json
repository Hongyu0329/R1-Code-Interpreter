    "This image shows a large, ornate device standing on a wooden cabinet. Based on its features, it is an electrostatic generator.\n\nThis specific instrument is the famous large electrostatic generator designed by Martinus van Marum and built by John Cuthbertson in 1784. It is a centerpiece in the instrument room of the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, Netherlands. The machine was used for experiments in the new science of electricity and was capable of generating a potential of 330,000 volts. Two large glass disks, 1.65 meters in diameter, would be rotated by the crank, generating a static charge through friction. This charge was then stored in a large battery of Leyden jars for use in experiments.\n\nOf the choices provided:\n*   **A. Steam engine:** Incorrect. The device is manually operated by a crank and lacks the typical components of a steam engine like a boiler or piston for motive power.\n*   **B. Electrostatic Generator:** Correct. The crank for manual rotation, the large housing for the generating friction discs, and the conductors for collecting the charge are all characteristic features of 18th-century electrostatic generators.\n*   **C. Brass telescope:** Incorrect. It lacks optical elements like lenses or an eyepiece.\n*   **D. Vacuum pump:** Incorrect. While early vacuum pumps were also scientific instruments of the era, they typically featured large glass bell jars, which are not present here.\n*   **E. Orrery:** Incorrect. An orrery is a mechanical model of the solar system and looks very different, with multiple spheres representing celestial bodies.\n\n<<<B>>>"
