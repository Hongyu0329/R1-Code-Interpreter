    "Based on the visual evidence and known biological characteristics of these insects, the sexes of the individuals in each pair are as follows:\n\n*   **Pair A:** The insect on the right is a female cuckoo bee (*Coelioxys*), identifiable by her long, sharply pointed abdomen which is used as an ovipositor to lay eggs in other bees' nests. The insect on the left is a male, which has a blunter abdomen that ends in several prongs or teeth. Therefore, this pair is Male, Female.\n\n*   **Pair B:** These are paper wasps (*Polistes*). The individual on the right is a male, which is distinguished by his long, curled antennae. The wasp on the left has shorter, straighter antennae, characteristic of a female. Only female wasps possess a stinger, which is a modified egg-laying organ (ovipositor). Thus, this pair is Female, Male.\n\n*   **Pair C:** The bee on the left is a male long-horned bee (*Melissodes* or a related genus), identified by his exceptionally long antennae and pale-colored face (clypeus), which are classic traits of males in this group. The bee on the right is a male wool carder bee (*Anthidium*), recognizable by the distinct yellow spots on its abdomen. Male wool carder bees are also known to be larger and more brightly colored than females. Therefore, this pair is Male, Male.\n\nCombining these findings:\n*   A: Male, Female (3)\n*   B: Female, Male (4)\n*   C: Male, Male (1)\n\n3, 4, 1<<<3, 4, 1>>>"
