    "The molecule depicted is **Cyclocarbon**.\n\nCyclocarbon is an allotrope of carbon with the molecular formula C₁₈. It consists of a ring of eighteen carbon atoms connected by alternating single and triple bonds, making it a cyclocarbon and a polyyne. This specific arrangement of bonds was confirmed by researchers at IBM and the University of Oxford in 2019 through high-resolution atomic force microscopy. They synthesized the molecule by eliminating carbon monoxide from a larger cyclocarbon oxide molecule (C₂₄O₆).\n\nCyclocarbon is the smallest cyclo[n]carbon that is predicted to be relatively stable. Its discovery and synthesis are significant as they open up possibilities for creating other carbon-rich materials and carbon allotropes. The molecule is highly reactive, and its electronic structure, with alternating triple and single bonds, suggests it behaves as a semiconductor.\n\nPrior to its successful synthesis and imaging, the precise structure of cyclocarbon was a topic of debate, with theories suggesting either alternating single and triple bonds or a cumulene-type structure with consecutive double bonds. The experimental evidence has since confirmed the polyynic structure of alternating single and triple bonds.\n\n<<<Cyclocarbon>>>"
