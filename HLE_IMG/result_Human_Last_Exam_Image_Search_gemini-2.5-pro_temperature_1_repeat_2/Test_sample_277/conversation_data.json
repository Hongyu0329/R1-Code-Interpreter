    "I am sorry, but the image you provided is black, so I cannot see the molecules you are asking about. To determine the type of isomers, I need to see the chemical structures.\n\nPlease provide the image of the molecules, and I will be happy to help you answer the question.\n\nTo give you some context, here is a brief explanation of the options:\n\n*   **(a) Conformational isomers (conformers):** These are different spatial arrangements of the same molecule that can be converted into one another by rotation around single bonds.\n*   **(b) Constitutional isomers:** These molecules have the same molecular formula but a different arrangement (connectivity) of atoms.\n*   **(c) Identical:** The molecules are superimposable and represent the same compound.\n*   **(d) Stereoisomers:** These molecules have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the three-dimensional arrangement of their atoms in space. This category includes enantiomers and diastereomers."
