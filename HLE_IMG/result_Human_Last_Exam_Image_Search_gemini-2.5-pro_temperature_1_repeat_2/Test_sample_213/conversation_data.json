    "The piece of sheet music is from the opening of Richard Strauss's opera *Salome*.\n\nSeveral key features in the score point to this identification:\n*   **Instrumentation**: The score calls for a large orchestra, including English horn, which is characteristic of Strauss's operatic works.\n*   **Musical Language**: The prominent rising melodic figure in the first violins is a whole-tone scale, a hallmark of musical modernism that Strauss employed. This specific unsettling and dramatic use of the scale is a well-known feature of *Salome*.\n*   **German Markings**: The instructions in the score, such as \"(Vorhang)\" for \"Curtain\" and \"(mit DÃ¤mpfer)\" for \"with mute,\" indicate a German-language opera.\n*   **Context**: The marking \"1 (Vorhang)\" signifies the very beginning of a scene, immediately as the curtain rises. While the user prompt mentions the second act, *Salome* is a one-act opera. This music appears after the orchestral introduction, accompanying the first scene.\n\nRichard Strauss composed *Salome*, a one-act music drama, between 1903 and 1905. The libretto is based on Hedwig Lachmann's German translation of Oscar Wilde's 1891 play. The opera is renowned for its rich, complex score and its infamous \"Dance of the Seven Veils\".\n\n<<<Salome>>>"
