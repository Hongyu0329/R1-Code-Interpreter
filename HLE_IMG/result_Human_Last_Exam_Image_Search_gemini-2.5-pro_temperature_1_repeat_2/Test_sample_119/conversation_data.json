    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the structure and IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\n*   The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion (M⁺) peak at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 135 g/mol.\n*   According to the nitrogen rule, a compound with an odd molecular weight typically contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**\n*   **~3050 cm⁻¹:** Peaks indicative of aromatic C-H stretching.\n*   **~2850-2950 cm⁻¹:** Peaks corresponding to aliphatic C-H stretching.\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹ and ~1495 cm⁻¹:** Absorptions characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   The absence of a strong, broad peak around 3300-3500 cm⁻¹ (O-H) or a strong, sharp peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ (C=O) suggests the absence of alcohol and carbonyl functional groups. There are some weak-to-medium peaks above 3300 cm⁻¹, which could suggest an N-H bond.\n\n**3. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectroscopy**\n*   The ¹³C NMR spectrum displays seven distinct carbon signals at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2.\n*   The signals between δ 126 and 146 are in the aromatic region.\n*   The DEPT-135 spectrum shows one negative signal (indicating a CH₂ group) and five positive signals (indicating CH and/or CH₃ groups).\n*   Combining this information:\n    *   **δ 145.1:** This signal does not appear in the DEPT-135 spectrum, identifying it as a quaternary carbon, likely an ipso-carbon of a substituted benzene ring.\n    *   **δ 128.5, 127.3, 126.3:** These three signals are positive in DEPT-135, confirming they are aromatic CH carbons.\n    *   **δ 49.6, 43.5, 19.2:** These are aliphatic carbons. One is a CH₂ (negative signal), and the other two are CH or CH₃ (positive signals).\n\n**4. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy**\n*   **~δ 7.2-7.3 (multiplet, 5H):** The integration and chemical shift strongly suggest a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   **~δ 2.9 (multiplet, 1H):** A single proton in the aliphatic region.\n*   **~δ 2.7 (multiplet, 2H):** Two protons in the aliphatic region.\n*   **~δ 1.2 (doublet, 3H):** A methyl group (CH₃) coupled to a single proton.\n\n**5. HSQC Spectroscopy**\nThis 2D spectrum correlates the ¹H and ¹³C signals:\n*   The 5H multiplet at ~δ 7.2 correlates with the ¹³C signals at δ 126.3, 127.3, and 128.5, confirming these are the aromatic CH groups.\n*   The 1H multiplet at ~δ 2.9 correlates with the ¹³C signal at **δ 49.6**. This carbon is therefore a **CH** group.\n*   The 2H multiplet at ~δ 2.7 correlates with the ¹³C signal at **δ 43.5**. This carbon must be the **CH₂** group.\n*   The 3H doublet at ~δ 1.2 correlates with the ¹³C signal at **δ 19.2**. This carbon is therefore a **CH₃** group.\n\n**6. Structure Determination**\n*   **Molecular Formula:** From the NMR and MS data, we have the following fragments: C₆H₅ (phenyl), CH, CH₂, and CH₃. This gives a partial formula of C₉H₁₁. The mass of this fragment is approximately 119 g/mol. The difference between the molecular weight (135) and this fragment mass is 16. The nitrogen rule and this mass difference strongly suggest the presence of an amine group (-NH₂), which has a mass of 16 g/mol and contains one nitrogen atom. The full molecular formula is therefore **C₉H₁₃N**. The two hydrogens of the amine group are often not seen clearly or appear as a broad, low-intensity signal in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n*   **Assembling the fragments:** We have a phenyl group and a C₃H₇ side chain with an amino group. The structure is an isomer of phenylpropylamine.\n    *   The ¹H NMR shows a 3H doublet, which means the CH₃ group is next to a CH group.\n    *   The ¹H NMR shows a 2H signal for the CH₂ group.\n    *   This evidence points to the structure being `C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃`.\n*   **Confirmation:**\n    *   In this structure, the benzylic protons (`C₆H₅-CH₂-`) are adjacent to the chiral center (`-CH(NH₂)-`), making them diastereotopic. This explains why they appear as a complex multiplet around δ 2.7 instead of a simple doublet.\n    *   The proton on the chiral carbon (`-CH(NH₂)-`) is coupled to both the adjacent CH₂ and CH₃ groups, resulting in a complex multiplet at ~δ 2.9.\n    *   The methyl group (`-CH₃`) is coupled only to the adjacent CH, correctly appearing as a doublet at ~δ 1.2.\n    *   The predicted ¹³C shifts for this structure align with the experimental data: benzylic CH₂ (~43 ppm), CH(NH₂) (~50 ppm), and CH₃ (~19 ppm).\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe compound is identified as 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
