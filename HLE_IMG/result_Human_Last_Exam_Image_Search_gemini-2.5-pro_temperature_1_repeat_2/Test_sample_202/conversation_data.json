    "Based on the visual characteristics of the rock specimens, here is their identification:\n\n*   **H: Scoria** This specimen is a reddish-brown, highly vesicular (porous) rock. These features are characteristic of scoria, a type of volcanic rock that forms when gas-rich lava cools. Its darker color and thicker vesicle walls distinguish it from pumice.\n*   **I: Breccia** This rock is composed of angular fragments of other rocks cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This composition and texture are definitive of breccia, a sedimentary rock formed from the accumulation and cementation of rock fragments.\n*   **J: Pumice** This specimen is light-colored and extremely porous, with a frothy appearance. These are the defining characteristics of pumice, a volcanic rock that forms from the rapid cooling of gas-rich, frothy lava. Its low density often allows it to float on water.\n*   **K: Pegmatite** This rock displays very large, interlocking crystals. This coarse-grained texture indicates that it cooled very slowly from magma deep within the Earth. Rocks with exceptionally large crystals are known as pegmatites.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
