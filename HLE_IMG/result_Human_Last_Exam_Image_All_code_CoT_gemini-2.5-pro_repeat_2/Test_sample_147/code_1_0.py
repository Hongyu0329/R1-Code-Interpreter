# This python code is a conceptual model of the shader's logic
# to demonstrate the final conclusion.

import math

# The key insight is how the final color is calculated.
# Let's represent the Worley function calls as variables.
r = "Worley(UV, points)"
g = "Worley(UV + offset, points)"
b = "Worley(UV - offset, points)"

# The shader code for the color is:
# COLOR.rgb = vec3(vec3(r, g, b).x);

# Let's trace the evaluation in Python-like pseudocode:
temp_vector = f"vec3({r}, {g}, {b})"
print(f"1. A temporary vector is created: {temp_vector}")

selected_component = f"({temp_vector}).x"
print(f"2. The .x component of this vector is selected. This is equal to the first component, r: {r}")

final_vector_value = r
final_vector = f"vec3({final_vector_value})"
print(f"3. A new vector is created from this single float value. This results in vec3(r, r, r): {final_vector}")

print("\nFinal Result:")
print("The calculations for green and blue channels are discarded.")
print("The final color is vec3(r, r, r), which is a grayscale value based on the Worley distance.")
print("This produces a grayscale Worley noise pattern with sharp ridges, which is Image C.")
