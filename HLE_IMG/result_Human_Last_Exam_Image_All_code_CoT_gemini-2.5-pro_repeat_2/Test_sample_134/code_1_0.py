    This function identifies and prints the name of the molecule.
    The molecule is a cycloparaphenylene, a type of carbon nanoring.
    - It is cyclic.
    - It is composed of phenylene (C6H4) units.
    - The phenylene units are connected at para positions (1,4).
    - Counting the units in the ring gives a total of 10.
    Therefore, the molecule is named [10]cycloparaphenylene.
