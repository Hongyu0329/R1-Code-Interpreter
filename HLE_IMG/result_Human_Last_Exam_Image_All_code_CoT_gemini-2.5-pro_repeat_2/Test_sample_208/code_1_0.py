    # 1. Define the clock's rules based on the riddle.
    # A clock face has 12 positions. We'll use 1-12.
    # Initial state: At noon, both hands are at 12.
    initial_position = 12
    start_hour = 12

    # The hour hand moves in "steps of three".
    hour_hand_step = 3

    # The minute hand moves a "quarter turn", which is also 3 positions on a 12-hour clock.

    # 2. Assume one "tick" or cycle of movement corresponds to one hour of real time.
    # We want to find the first meeting time *after* noon.

    # 3. Calculate the new positions after the first hour has passed.
    # We use modulo 12 arithmetic for a circular clock face.
    # A common way to handle this is to map 1-12 to 0-11, calculate, then map back.
    # (position - 1) gets to 0-11 range.
    # % 12 keeps it in the 0-11 range.
    # + 1 gets it back to 1-12 range.
    
    # Calculate the hour hand's new position
    hour_hand_new_pos = ((initial_position - 1) + hour_hand_step) % 12 + 1
    
    # Calculate the minute hand's new position
    minute_hand_new_pos = ((initial_position - 1) + minute_hand_step) % 12 + 1

    # The meeting time is the start time plus the elapsed time.
    meeting_hour = start_hour + time_elapsed_hours

    # 4. Print the explanation and the "equation" as requested.

    print("Since they start together and move by the same amount, we can find when they first meet again by checking their positions after the first hour.\n")
    
    print("The equation for the final positions after 1 hour:")
