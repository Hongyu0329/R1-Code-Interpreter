    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Analyze Clue 1 & Image:** The first clue states, \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\" I will identify the person and the event in the image. The image shows a man receiving an award. Based on the date and the appearance of the individuals, this is likely the 2019 NHL Awards, where player Nikita Kucherov received the Hart Memorial Trophy.\n2.  **Analyze Clue 2:** The second clue says, \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This points to a historical object or process involving mercury. The most famous example is the use of mercury nitrate in the production of felt for hats, which led to mercury poisoning among hatters (the origin of the \"mad hatter\" trope). This strongly suggests the object is a **Felt Hat**.\n3.  **Connect the Clues:** The solution connects these two parts through a clever pun. The name of the trophy, the **Hart** Trophy, is a pun for **Hat**. The emotion the winner **felt** upon receiving the award is a pun for **Felt**.\n4.  **Synthesize the Answer:** Combining the two parts of the pun gives us the answer for X Y.\n5.  **Generate Code:** I will write a Python script that explains this logic step-by-step and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step solution to the riddle.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the riddle to identify 'X Y'...\\n\")\n\n    # Part 1: The clue about mercury toxicity\n    print(\"--- Clue 1: The Toxic Object ---\")\n    print(\"The clue 'Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts' points to a FELT HAT.\")\n    print(\"The process of making felt for hats historically involved using mercury nitrate, a toxic salt that caused neurological damage in hat makers.\\n\")\n\n    # Part 2: The clue about the picture\n    print(\"--- Clue 2: The Pictured Event ---\")\n    print(\"The clue 'X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019' and the image point to the 2019 NHL Awards.\")\n    print(\"The person receiving the award is Nikita Kucherov, and the award is the HART Memorial Trophy.\\n\")\n\n    # Part 3: Connecting the clues with a pun\n    print(\"--- Connecting the Clues ---\")\n    print(\"The answer connects the two clues through a two-part pun:\")\n    # The pun for 'Felt'\n    word_x = \"Felt\"\n    explanation_x = \"The word 'Felt' is a pun on the emotion the winner 'felt' upon receiving the prestigious award.\"\n    # The pun for 'Hat'\n    word_y = \"Hat\"\n    explanation_y = \"The word 'Hat' is a pun on the 'Hart' Memorial Trophy being presented in the picture.\"\n    \n    print(f\"1. X = '{word_x}': {explanation_x}\")\n    print(f\"2.
