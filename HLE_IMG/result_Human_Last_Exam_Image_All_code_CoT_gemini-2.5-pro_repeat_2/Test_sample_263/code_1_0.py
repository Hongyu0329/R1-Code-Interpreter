    # Analysis of Complex 1
    print("Complex 1: [Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+")
    print("This is a standard, benchmark emitter.")
    print("It lacks specific modifications for enhanced stability.\n")

    # Analysis of Complex 2
    print("Complex 2: [Ir(ppy)2(bulky N^N ligand)]+")
    print("This complex features a large, sterically bulky ancillary ligand.")
    print("Reasoning: Steric bulk helps protect the Iridium center and reduces intermolecular interactions (aggregation), which is a known stability enhancement strategy.")
    print("Expected Stability: Higher than Complex 1.\n")

    # Analysis of Complex 3
    print("Complex 3: [Ir(dfppy)2(dtbbpy)]+")
    print("This complex incorporates two key design strategies for high stability:")
    print("1. Electronic Stabilization: The cyclometalating ligands are fluorinated (dfppy). Fluorine atoms lower the HOMO energy level, making the complex more resistant to oxidative degradation.")
    print("2. Steric Hindrance: The ancillary ligand has bulky tert-butyl groups (dtbbpy), which provide steric shielding.")
    print("Expected Stability: Higher than both Complex 1 and Complex 2.\n")

    # Final Conclusion
    print("------------------------------------")
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("Complex 3 combines both electronic stabilization and steric hindrance, making it the most robust design.")
    print("Therefore, LECs based on Complex 3 are expected to be the most stable.")
