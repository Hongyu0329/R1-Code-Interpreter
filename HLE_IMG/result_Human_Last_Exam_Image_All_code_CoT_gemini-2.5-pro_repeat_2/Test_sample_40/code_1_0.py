# Define the given parameters and base values
V_initial_pu = 0.85      # Initial voltage at Bus B in per unit
V_final_pu = 1.0         # Final (target) voltage at Bus B in per unit
R_F_pu = 0.15            # Fault resistance in per unit
S_base_MVA = 100         # Base power in MVA
harmonic_loss_increase = 0.04 # 4% increase in system losses

# State the key assumption for solvability.
# The provided impedance data (Zs, Zf) is inconsistent for standard models.
# We assume an effective Th√©venin reactance of the faulted system as seen from Bus B.
# A value of X_th = 0.6 p.u. is assumed as it yields a physically reasonable solution.
X_th_pu = 0.6

# --- Step 1: Calculate the Optimal Reactive Power Injection (Q_opt) ---
# We use a simplified formula relating voltage change to reactive power compensation.
# Q_opt = (V_final^2 - V_initial^2) / X_th

delta_V_squared = V_final_pu**2 - V_initial_pu**2
Q_opt_pu = delta_V_squared / X_th_pu

# Convert the reactive power from per unit to MVAR
Q_opt_MVAR = Q_opt_pu * S_base_MVA

# --- Step 2: Calculate the System's Total Real Power Losses ---
# Assume the dominant loss is the power dissipated in the fault resistance R_F.
# The voltage at the fault is assumed to be restored to 1.0 p.u. after compensation.
V_fault_pu = 1.0

# Calculate the fundamental power loss in the fault impedance
P_loss_fundamental_pu = V_fault_pu**2 / R_F_pu

# Add the 4% harmonic loss component
P_loss_total_pu = P_loss_fundamental_pu * (1 + harmonic_loss_increase)

# Convert the total power loss from per unit to MW
P_loss_total_MW = P_loss_total_pu * S_base_MVA

# --- Step 3: Print the results with detailed equations ---
