    This script solves the riddle based on etymological and contextual clues.
    1. The crater is named Sagan.
    2. The etymology of the name Sagan can be traced back to the Polish word 'Å¼agiew', meaning "torch". So, X = "Torch".
    3. The phrase "X of Y" must fit Carl Sagan's description of images of Earth providing enlightenment. "Torch of Light" is a fitting metaphor.
    4. Therefore, Y = "Light".
    """
    x = "Torch"
    y = "Light"
    
    print(f"The phrase 'X of Y' is inferred to be '{x} of {y}'.")
    print(f"The question asks for Y.")
    print(f"Y = {y}")
