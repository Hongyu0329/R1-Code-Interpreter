    "To find the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** First, I'll identify the specific knot shown in the diagram. By counting the crossings and observing their arrangement, I can determine its classification in knot theory tables (the Alexander-Briggs notation). The diagram shows a knot with 6 crossings that are arranged in an alternating pattern (over-under-over-under...). This specific configuration is known as the **6₂ knot**.\n\n2.  **Use Properties of Alternating Knots:** The 6₂ knot is an alternating knot. For alternating knots, there is a direct and simple relationship between the Rasmussen invariant (s-invariant) and another important knot invariant, the knot signature (σ).\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula:** The formula established by Jacob Rasmussen for an alternating knot K is:\n    `s(K) = -σ(K)`\n    This means the Rasmussen invariant is simply the negative of the knot's signature.\n\n4.  **Find the Knot Signature:** The signature for the 6₂ knot is a well-known value in knot theory. By consulting a knot table or a reliable source, we find that the signature of the 6₂ knot is `σ(6₂) = -4`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Rasmussen Invariant:** With the signature known, I will use the formula to calculate the Rasmussen invariant.\n\nThe following Python code will perform the final calculation based on these established facts.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rasmussen_invariant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Rasmussen invariant for the knot 6_2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the knot. The knot in the image is the 6_2 knot.\n    knot_name = \"6_2\"\n\n    # Step 2: State the relevant property and formula.\n    # The 6_2 knot is an alternating knot. For any alternating knot K,\n    # its Rasmussen invariant s(K) is the negative of its signature σ(K).\n    # Formula: s(K) = -σ(K)\n    print(f\"The knot in the image is the {knot_name} knot, which is an alternating knot.\")\n    print(\"For an alternating knot, the Rasmussen invariant (s) is the negative of the knot signature (σ).\")\n    print(\"The formula is: s = -σ\")\n\n    # Step 3: Use the known signature for the 6_2 knot.\n    knot_signature = -4\n    print(f\"The signature for the {knot_name} knot is a known value: σ = {knot_signature}.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the Rasmussen invariant.\n    rasmussen_invariant = -knot_signature\n\n    # Step 5: Print the final calculation and result.\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the Rasmussen invariant using the formula:\")\n    print(f\"s = -({knot_signature}) = {rasmussen_invariant}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_rasmussen_invariant()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
