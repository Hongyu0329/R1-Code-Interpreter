    "Based on the analysis of the night sky image, I will determine the viewpoint's country.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Image Data:** I will extract key information from the image: the date and time (2024-10-22, 20:07:37 CEST), and the positions of visible celestial objects (Jupiter, Saturn, Vega, Capella) and the Milky Way.\n2.  **Establish Constraints:**\n    *   The timezone **CEST (Central European Summer Time, UTC+2)** constrains the location to a set of European countries.\n    *   The high apparent altitude of **Jupiter** suggests a location in the southern part of this region, as Jupiter's declination is about +19.5°, and its altitude is highest when viewed from lower latitudes.\n    *   The positions of all objects relative to each other and the horizon provide directional clues. The image appears to be a zenith-centered, fisheye view.\n3.  **Hypothesize and Verify:**\n    *   I'll hypothesize a location that fits these constraints, such as Southern Spain. Spain uses CEST and is one of the southernmost countries in that timezone.\n    *   I will use Python with the `astropy` library to calculate the precise altitude and azimuth of the key celestial bodies for the given time and hypothesized location.\n    *   I will then compare these calculated coordinates with their positions in the image to verify the hypothesis. For a zenith-centered view with south at the bottom, the sky quadrants are:\n        *   Upper-left: Southeast (SE)\n        *   Upper-right: Southwest (SW)\n        *   Lower-left: Northeast (NE)\n        *   Lower-right: Northwest (NW)\n    *   The azimuth values from the calculation will confirm if the objects appear in the correct quadrant of the sky. For instance, an object in the SE should have an azimuth between 90° and 180°.\n4.  **Conclude:** Based on the verification, I will conclude the country where the viewpoint is located.\n\n```python\nimport astropy.units as u\nfrom astropy.time import Time\nfrom astropy.coordinates import EarthLocation, SkyCoord, AltAz, get_sun, get_moon, get_body\n\ndef solve_sky_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes celestial positions to determine the observer's location.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the observation time from the image.\n    # Time is 20:07:37 CEST on 2024-10-22.
