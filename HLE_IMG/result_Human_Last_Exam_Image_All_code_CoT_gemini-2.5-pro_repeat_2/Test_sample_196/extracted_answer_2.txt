Four possibilities for describing the dimerization of 3-oxidopyrylium are:
1. [4π + 2π], where one molecule contributes 4π electrons and the other contributes 2π electrons.
2. [6π + 4π], where one molecule contributes 6π electrons and the other contributes 4π electrons.
3. [4π + 4π], where one molecule contributes 4π electrons and the other contributes 4π electrons.
4. [2π + 2π], where one molecule contributes 2π electrons and the other contributes 2π electrons.
