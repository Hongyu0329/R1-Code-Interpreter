# The problem is solved by treating it as a number puzzle based on the chemical names.
# Starting numbers (from 1,4-difluoro-2-methylbenzene): {1, 4, 2}

# We need to generate the numbers in the target set that are not in the starting set: {3, 6, 7, 8}.
# Each equation to generate a new number is considered one step.
