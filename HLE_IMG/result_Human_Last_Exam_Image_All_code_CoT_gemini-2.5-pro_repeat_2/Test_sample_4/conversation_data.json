    "This image shows the knot known in knot theory as the **9_42 knot**. It is an alternating knot with 9 crossings. The Jones polynomial, denoted as $V(t)$, is a knot invariant that can be calculated for any knot. For the 9_42 knot, the Jones polynomial is $V(t) = t^{-4} - t^{-3} + t^{-2} - t^{-1} + 1 - t + t^2$.\n\nTo fulfill the request, I will provide a Python script that constructs and prints this polynomial in the specified format, with terms in decreasing degree order.\n\n```python\ndef format_jones_polynomial():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function formats and prints the Jones polynomial for the 9_42 knot.\n    The terms are represented as a list of (coefficient, power) tuples,\n    ordered by decreasing power of t.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Jones polynomial for the 9_42 knot:\n    # t^2 - t + 1 - t^-1 + t^-2 - t^-3 + t^-4\n    terms = [\n        (1, 2),\n        (-1, 1),\n        (1, 0),\n        (-1, -1),\n        (1, -2),\n        (-1, -3),\n        (1, -4)\n    ]\n\n    poly_parts = []\n    is_first_term = True\n\n    for coeff, power in terms:\n        # Build the string for the current term\n        part = \"\"\n\n        # Determine the sign and absolute coefficient\n        sign = \" + \" if coeff > 0 else \" - \"\n        abs_coeff = abs(coeff)\n\n        # For the very first term, handle the sign separately\n        if is_first_term:\n            if sign == \" - \":\n                part += \"-\"\n            is_first_term = False\n        else:\n            part += sign\n\n        # Format the term based on coefficient and power\n        if power == 0:\n            part += str(abs_coeff)\n        else:\n            if abs_coeff != 1:\n                part += str(abs_coeff)\n\n            part += \"t\"\n\n            if power != 1:\n                part += f\"^{power}\"\n    \n        poly_parts.append(part)\n\n    # Join all the parts into the final polynomial string\n    # The first part is added directly, subsequent parts are appended.\n    # We need to clean up spaces for the first term.\n    final_string = \"\".join(poly_parts).lstrip(\" + \")\n    \n    print(final_string)\n\nformat_jones_polynomial()\n```\n<<<t^2 - t + 1 - t^-1 + t^-2 - t^-3 + t^-4>>>"
