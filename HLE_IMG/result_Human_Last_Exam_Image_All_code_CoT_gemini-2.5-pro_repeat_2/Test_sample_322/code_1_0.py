def solve_vortex_puzzle():
    """
    Analyzes the 16 vortex trajectory plots and determines the unique vortex in each.

    The analysis is based on the visual characteristics of the trajectories, which correlate
    with the relative strength of the vortices.

    - Uppercase (R, G, B): The unique vortex is twice as strong. Its trajectory is
      typically large, simple, and central, with the other two orbiting it.
    - Lowercase (r, g, b): The unique vortex is half as strong. Its trajectory is
      typically small and tight (in regular cases) or orbits the chaotic pair
      of stronger vortices (in chaotic cases).
