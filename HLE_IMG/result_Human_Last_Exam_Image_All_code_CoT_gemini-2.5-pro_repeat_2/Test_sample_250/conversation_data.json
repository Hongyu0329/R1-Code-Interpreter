    "I have identified the jazz standard by analyzing its melody and chord progression.\n\n1.  **Melody Analysis**: The piece is in the key of F minor (indicated by the four-flat key signature and the F minor starting chord). The opening melodic phrase is C-F-Ab-C, followed by Bb-Ab-G-F#. I transposed the melody of the well-known jazz standard \"Softly, as in a Morning Sunrise\" to F minor. The original is in C minor, and its opening phrase is G-C-Eb-G, followed by F-Eb-D-C#. Transposing this up by a perfect fourth to F minor yields C-F-Ab-C and Bb-Ab-G-F#, which is an exact match for the melody in the provided sheet music.\n\n2.  **Chord Progression Analysis**: While the chords written on this lead sheet (e.g., F-, E-7b5, Eb-6) are a reharmonization and differ from the original changes of the song, they are harmonically consistent with the melody provided. Reharmonization is a very common practice in jazz.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: Based on the definitive match of the melody, the song is \"Softly, as in a Morning Sunrise\". This piece was composed by Sigmund Romberg for the 1928 operetta *The New Moon*.\n\n```python\ndef solve_music_riddle():\n  \"\"\"\n  Identifies the title and composer of the provided jazz standard sheet music.\n  \"\"\"\n  title = \"Softly, as in a Morning Sunrise\"\n  composer = \"Sigmund Romberg\"\n  \n  print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n  print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nsolve_music_riddle()\n```\n<<<Title: Softly, as in a Morning Sunrise, Composer: Sigmund Romberg>>>"
