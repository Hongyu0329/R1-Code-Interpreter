# The path identified from the conversation is START -> Appreciation -> Solution -> END.

# Probability of the transition from START to Appreciation
p_start_to_appreciation = 0.32

# The sum of probabilities of outgoing transitions from a state must be 100%.
# The Appreciation state has one shown transition to END with 83% probability.
# Therefore, the missing transition to the Solution state must be 100% - 83% = 17%.

# The problem states that the Solution state has only one outgoing transition to END.
# Therefore, its probability must be 100%.
p_solution_to_end = 1.0

# The total probability of the path is the product of the individual transition probabilities.
