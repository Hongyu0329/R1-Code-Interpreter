    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find a point around which the pattern can be rotated by a certain angle (less than 360 degrees) and still look identical to the original.\n\n**My Plan:**\n1.  I will examine the provided image of the tiling to identify points of symmetry.\n2.  I will look for a repeating motif arranged around a central point.\n3.  A prominent feature in the tiling is the dark blue, seven-sided polygon (a heptagon) surrounded by other shapes. I will choose the center of one of these heptagons as a potential center of rotation.\n4.  I will count how many times the surrounding pattern repeats as we go around this central point. This number, 'n', will give us the n-fold rotational symmetry.\n5.  The angle of rotation for an n-fold symmetry is calculated as 360 / n degrees.\n6.  I will write a Python script to print out this step-by-step reasoning and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef find_rotational_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the process of finding the rotational symmetry\n    of the provided tiling through observation.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify a center of rotation.\n    # We choose the center of one of the prominent dark blue polygons.\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify a potential center of rotation in the tiling.\")\n    print(\"A good candidate is the center of a dark blue, seven-sided polygon (heptagon).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Observe the arrangement of shapes around this center.\n    # The central blue heptagon is surrounded by 7 yellow pentagons.\n    print(\"Step 2: Observe the shapes arranged around this central point.\")\n    print(\"The central heptagon is surrounded by a ring of 7 identical yellow pentagons.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Count the number of repeating units to determine the order of symmetry.\n    # The number of identical, symmetrically placed units around the center gives us 'n'.\n    n = 7\n    print(f\"Step 3: Count the number of repeating units in this ring.\")\n    print(f\"There are {n} such units.
