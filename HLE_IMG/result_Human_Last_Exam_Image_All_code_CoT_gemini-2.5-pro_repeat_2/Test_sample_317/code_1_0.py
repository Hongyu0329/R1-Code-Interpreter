    # --- Step 1: Determine k for Re = 50*k ---
    # The equation for x_3 is x_3' = -5*x_3 - c*x_1*x_2 + Re.
    # A simple fixed point of the system is at (0, 0, Re/5, 0, 0).
    # While the system oscillates around this point, its value gives a good estimate
    # for the center of the x_3 oscillations.
    # From the plots (e.g., Sim 1, plot h), x_3 oscillates in the range [15, 18].
    # In Sim 2, it's [8, 20]. A central value is roughly 15-20.
    # If x_3_center ≈ Re/5, then Re ≈ 5 * x_3_center.
    # Let's test integer values of k:
    # k=1 -> Re=50 -> x_3_center=10. Plausible but a bit low.
    # k=2 -> Re=100 -> x_3_center=20. This aligns well with the upper range of x_3 across the plots.
    # k=3 -> Re=150 -> x_3_center=30. Too high.
    # Thus, k=2 is the most likely value.
    k = 2
    Re = 50 * k

    # --- Step 2: Identify Horizontal Axes ---
    # The four plot labels (f, g, h, i) have horizontal axes corresponding to x1, x2, x3, x4.
    # Plot f (Sim 1) has a horizontal axis range of [15, 18].
    # Plot h (Sim 1) has a vertical axis labeled x_3 with the same range [15, 18].
    # This strongly suggests the horizontal axis of plot f is x_3.
    #
    # Now to assign x1, x2, x4 to plots g, h, i. Let's analyze the ranges in Sim 2 where they differ most.
    # H-range(g) ≈ [-6, 6] (width 12). H-range(h) ≈ [-15, 15] (width 30). H-range(i) ≈ [-4, 4] (width 8).
    # From the ODE x_2' = -9*x_2 + b*x_1*x_3, we can approximate x_2 ≈ (b/9)*x_1*x_3.
    # Since x_3 > 0, the ratio of amplitudes is |x2|/|x1| ≈ |b|/9 * x3.
    # x3 is ~16 in Sim 1. So |x2|/|x1| ≈ |b| * 1.8.
    # The parameters are -1 or 10. If b=10, ratio is ~18 (not seen). If b=-1, ratio is ~1.8.
    # The ratio of H-ranges for g and i in Sim 2 is 12/8 = 1.5. This is the closest to 1.8.
    # This implies {H-axis(g), H-axis(i)} are {x1, x2} and the baseline b=-1.
    # The variable with the larger range (g, width 12) must be x2. The smaller (i, width 8) is x1.
    # The remaining variable, x4, must correspond to the largest range plot, h (width 30).
    #
    # Assignment:
    # x1 horizontal axis is in plot -> i
    # x2 horizontal axis is in plot -> g
    # x3 horizontal axis is in plot -> f
    # x4 horizontal axis is in plot -> h
    axis_map = {'x1': 'i', 'x2': 'g', 'x3': 'f', 'x4': 'h'}
    axis_string = "".join([axis_map[f'x{i}'] for i in range(1, 5)])

    # --- Step 3: Determine Parameter Changes ---
    # Sim 1 is the baseline with no changes. Code: 0.
    sim1_change = '0'

    # Sim 2: The most dramatic change is the explosion of the range of x4 (H-axis of h)
    # from ~3 units in Sim 1 to 30 units in Sim 2.
    # The equation for x4 is x_4' = -5*x_4 - d*x_1*x_5.
    # Increasing the magnitude of the forcing term by increasing parameter 'd' would lead to larger amplitudes.
    # So, the change is 'd' increased tenfold. Code: D.
    sim2_change = 'D'

    # Sim 3: The key change is that x5 flips from being negative (Sim 1) to positive (Sim 3).
    # Also, the ranges of x1, x2, x4 grow significantly, suggesting the system is more unstable.
    # The stability is strongly influenced by the term `-c*x_1*x_2` in the x3 equation.
    # With b=-1, the effective damping on x3 is `-(bc/9)x_1^2*x_3` which is destabilizing (anti-damping).
    # Increasing 'c' tenfold makes this anti-damping much stronger, leading to larger oscillations.
    # This matches the observed behavior in Sim 3. Code: C.
    sim3_change = 'C'

    # Sim 4: The attractor becomes very regular, almost a limit cycle, and the range of x3
    # becomes very narrow. This indicates the system has become more stable.
    # The anti-damping term `-(bc/9)x_1^2` can be weakened by reducing the magnitude of 'b'.
    # Decreasing 'b' (from -1 to -0.1) makes the condition for instability (`x_1^2 > -45/b`) much harder
    # to meet, thus stabilizing the system. This matches the plot. Code: b.
    sim4_change = 'b'
