    "This image displays the crystal structure of the human deubiquitinase OTUB1 in a covalent complex with a ubiquitin variant. The larger protein, colored dark blue, is **OTUB1** (OTU deubiquitinase 1). The smaller protein, colored light blue, is ubiquitin. I will provide a python script to output the name of the main protein.\n\n```python\ndef get_protein_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and returns the name of the protein shown in the image.\n  The image shows the structure of OTUB1 in complex with ubiquitin (PDB ID: 2ZFY).\n  The main, larger protein is OTUB1.\n  \"\"\"\n  protein_name = \"OTUB1 (Ovarian tumor domain-containing ubiquitin aldehyde-binding protein 1)\"\n  print(f\"The name of the main protein shown in the image is: {protein_name}\")\n\nget_protein_name()\n```\n<<<OTUB1>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the name of this protein?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
