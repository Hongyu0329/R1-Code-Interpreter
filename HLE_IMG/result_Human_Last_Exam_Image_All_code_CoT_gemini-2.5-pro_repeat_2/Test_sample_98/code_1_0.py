    This function determines the century of the medallion based on its style and historical context.
    The medallion features Jupiter-Ammon and Isis, a style characteristic of the Late Roman Empire.
    It is dated by numismatists and historians to circa 300 A.D., during the period of the Tetrarchy.
    This period (293-313 A.D.) spans the end of the 3rd and the beginning of the 4th century.
    Art historians typically consider the distinct, abstract style of the Tetrarchy as the beginning
    of Late Antique art, associating it with the 4th century.
