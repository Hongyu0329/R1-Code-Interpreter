    "An analysis of the board reveals a forced checkmate in two moves for White.\n\nThe key is to give a check with the White Queen that severely restricts the Black King and forces a response that allows for a follow-up mate. All of Black's possible replies lead to an inevitable checkmate on White's second move.\n\nHere is the Python code that outlines the solution:\n```python\ndef solve_chess_mate_in_two():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the solution to the chess mate-in-two puzzle.\n    The position is:\n    White: Kh4, Qa4, Rh5, Rf3, b4, Nb7, Ne7, Bg2\n    Black: Ke4, Qd5, Rc6, e5, f4\n    White to move.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    first_move = \"1.
