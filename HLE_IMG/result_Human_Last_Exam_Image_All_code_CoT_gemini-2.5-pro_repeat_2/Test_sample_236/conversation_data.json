    "Based on the visual characteristics of the insect, including its red and black coloration, its presence on a goldenrod flower, and its body shape characteristic of a true bug, the animal is identified as a species of plant bug. Specifically, it appears to be *Lopidea media*, commonly known as the goldenrod scarlet plant bug.\n\nThe following Python code will print this scientific name.\n\n```python\ndef get_scientific_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns the scientific name of the insect in the image.\n    The insect is identified as Lopidea media, the goldenrod scarlet plant bug,\n    based on its appearance and its association with the goldenrod plant.\n    \"\"\"\n    scientific_name = \"Lopidea media\"\n    print(f\"The scientific name of the animal depicted in the center of the image is: {scientific_name}\")\n\nget_scientific_name()\n```\n<<<Lopidea media>>>"
