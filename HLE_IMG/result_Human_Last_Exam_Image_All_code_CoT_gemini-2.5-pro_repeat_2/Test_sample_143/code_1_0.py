    """
    This script provides the solution to the plant invasion identification puzzle.
    
    Analysis:
    - Pair A: The plant on the right (Garlic Mustard) forms a dense monoculture carpet on the forest floor, which is a classic sign of an invasion. The left image shows it as part of a more diverse plant community, typical of its native range. This corresponds to option 3.
    - Pair B: The plant on the left (Lupine) has formed a massive, dense stand, completely dominating the roadside. This aggressive growth is characteristic of an invasion. The plant on the right is sparse and scattered. This corresponds to option 4.
    - Pair C: The plant (Papaya) is shown as an individual tree in both images. It is not forming a dense or dominant stand in either picture. This lack of invasive behavior suggests it's in its native habitat or at least not acting as an aggressive invader in these locations. This corresponds to option 1.
