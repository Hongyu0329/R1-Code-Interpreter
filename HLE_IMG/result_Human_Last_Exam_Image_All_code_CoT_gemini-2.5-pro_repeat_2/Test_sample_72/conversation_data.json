    "This is a multi-step photochemical reaction. To identify the pericyclic reactions involved, we need to deduce the reaction mechanism step-by-step.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Conditions:** The reactants are hexafluorobenzene (a 6π-electron aromatic system) and cyclobutene (a 2π-electron alkene). The reaction is driven by light (hv), indicating that the pericyclic reactions must be photochemically allowed according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. The problem statement explicitly says two such reactions occur.\n\n2.  **Propose the First Step:** A direct cycloaddition between the two reactants is possible, but the formation of the complex tricyclic product suggests an initial transformation of one of the reactants. A well-known photochemical reaction of benzene and its derivatives is the valence isomerization to Dewar benzene. In this case, hexafluorobenzene isomerizes to hexafluoro-Dewar benzene. This reaction can be classified as an **intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition**, where two non-adjacent double bonds of the benzene ring react with each other. A [2+2] cycloaddition is a photochemically allowed process.\n\n3.  **Propose the Second Step:** The intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene (which is bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene), now reacts with cyclobutene. The Dewar benzene has two isolated double bonds, and cyclobutene has one. A reaction between one of the double bonds of hexafluoro-Dewar benzene and the double bond of cyclobutene occurs. This is an **intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition**. This reaction creates a new four-membered ring, fusing the two molecules and forming the final product. This second [2+2] cycloaddition is also a photochemically allowed process.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The overall transformation is achieved through two sequential [2+2] cycloaddition reactions, both of which are photochemically allowed. The first is intramolecular, and the second is intermolecular.\n\nThe following Python code will print out the types of the two reactions.\n\n```python\ndef identify_pericyclic_reactions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions\n    involved in the transformation of hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene.\n    \"\"\"\n    reaction1_type = \"Intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition\"\n    reaction2_type = \"Intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition\"\n\n    print(\"The two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are:\")\n    print(f\"1. An {reaction1_type} (Hexafluorobenzene -> Hexafluoro-Dewar benzene)\")\n    print(f\"2. An {reaction2_type} (Hexafluoro-Dewar benzene + Cyclobutene -> Final Product)\")\n\nidentify_pericyclic_reactions()\n```\n<<<An intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition and an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition.>>>"
