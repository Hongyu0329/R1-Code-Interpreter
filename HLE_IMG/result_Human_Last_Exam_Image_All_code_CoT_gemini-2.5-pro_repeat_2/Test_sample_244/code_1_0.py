# Step 1: Analyze the image. The image shows a dark, dichotomously branching, thalloid organism growing on tree bark.
# Step 2: Identify the organism. This morphology is characteristic of a thalloid liverwort, specifically from the genus Metzgeria.
# Step 3: Write a Python script to print this identification.
