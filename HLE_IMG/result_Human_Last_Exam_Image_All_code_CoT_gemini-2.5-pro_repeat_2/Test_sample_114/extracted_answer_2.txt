The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to the rigid, bicyclic structure of the münchnone intermediate derived from N-acetyl-proline. In this intermediate, the two reactive carbons of the 1,3-dipole (C2 and C4) are sterically and electronically distinct. Specifically, the C4 carbon is a highly hindered bridgehead position. The cycloaddition is therefore governed by sterics, with the bulky ester group of methyl propiolate attacking the less-hindered C2 position, leading to a single product. The results from Reactions 1 and 2 are crucial because they establish that in a comparable acyclic system (from N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine), the münchnone intermediate behaves symmetrically. This leads to a non-regioselective reaction (a 1:1 mixture of products) because the two ends of the dipole are effectively equivalent. Therefore, the contrast between the non-selective acyclic case and the highly selective cyclic case demonstrates that the geometric constraint imposed by the proline ring is the direct cause of the observed regioselectivity in Reaction 3.
