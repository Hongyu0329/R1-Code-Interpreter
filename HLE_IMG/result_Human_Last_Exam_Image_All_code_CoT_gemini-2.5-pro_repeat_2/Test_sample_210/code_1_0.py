    This function identifies the correct image by comparing key features.
    
    1.  **Target Analysis:** The target nyala has a specific horn shape, a grizzled dorsal mane, and a unique cluster of white spots on its lower flank.
    2.  **Comparison:**
        *   A: Horns smaller, mane less grizzled.
        *   B: Horns, grizzled mane, and the cluster of white spots are a perfect match to the target.
        *   C: Poor image quality.
        *   D: Horns have a different curvature.
        *   E: Horns and spot pattern are different.
        *   F: Partially obscured, key features don't match perfectly.
    3.  **Conclusion:** Image B is the correct answer.
