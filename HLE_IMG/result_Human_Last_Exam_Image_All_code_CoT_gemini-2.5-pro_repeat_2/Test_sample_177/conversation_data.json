    "To determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we need to calculate a representative VMT index for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios and then find the percentage difference. The VMT index is calculated by summing the VMT for each trip distance category.\n\nThe VMT for each category is calculated as:\n`VMT = (Share of Total Trips) * (Total Car Mode Share) * (Average Trip Distance)`\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Extract Data**: Gather the necessary percentages and distances from Table 1 (Baseline) and Table 2 (Proposed).\n2.  **Calculate Baseline VMT**:\n    *   For each distance category (0-3, 3-5, 5-10, 10+ miles), calculate the total car mode share by adding the shares of \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n    *   Multiply this total car share by the share of total trips and the average trip distance for that category.\n    *   Sum the results from all categories to get the total Baseline VMT index.\n3.  **Calculate Proposed VMT**: Repeat the process in step 2 using the data from Table 2.\n4.  **Calculate Percentage Reduction**: Use the formula:\n    `Percentage Reduction = ((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100`\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_vmt_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage reduction in Car VMT based on the provided tables.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define data from the tables\n    distance_categories = ['0-3 miles', '3-5 miles', '5-10 miles', '10+ miles']\n    share_of_total_trips = [0.48, 0.22, 0.14, 0.16]\n    avg_trip_distance = [1, 4, 7.5, 20]\n\n    # Baseline scenario data (Table 1)\n    baseline_car_1_occupant = [0.25, 0.38, 0.40, 0.42]\n    baseline_car_multi_occupant = [0.28, 0.43, 0.45, 0.47]\n\n    # Proposed scenario data (Table 2)\n    proposed_car_1_occupant = [0.01, 0.08, 0.14, 0.16]\n    proposed_car_multi_occupant = [0.02, 0.19, 0.27, 0.33]\n\n    # Calculate total car mode shares for each scenario\n    baseline_total_car_share = [s1 + s2 for s1, s2 in zip(baseline_car_1_occupant, baseline_car_multi_occupant)]\n    proposed_total_car_share = [s1 + s2 for s1, s2 in zip(proposed_car_1_occupant, proposed_car_multi_occupant)]\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate Baseline VMT Index ---\n    baseline_vmt_components = []\n    print(\"--- Calculating Baseline VMT Index ---\")\n    print(\"VMT Index = Sum of [ (Trip Share) * (Total Car Share) * (Avg Distance) ] for each category.\\n\")\n    for i in range(len(distance_categories)):\n        component = share_of_total_trips[i] * baseline_total_car_share[i] * avg_trip_distance[i]\n        baseline_vmt_components.append(component)\n        print(f\"Category '{distance_categories[i]}':\")\n        print(f\"  Car Share = {baseline_car_1_occupant[i]} + {baseline_car_multi_occupant[i]} = {baseline_total_car_share[i]:.2f}\")\n        print(f\"  VMT Component = {share_of_total_trips[i]} * {baseline_total_car_share[i]:.2f} * {avg_trip_distance[i]} = {component:.4f}\\n\")\n    \n    baseline_vmt_index = sum(baseline_vmt_components)\n    print(f\"Total Baseline VMT Index = {' + '.join([f'{c:.4f}' for c in baseline_vmt_components])} = {baseline_vmt_index:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate Proposed VMT Index ---\n    proposed_vmt_components = []\n    print(\"--- Calculating Proposed VMT Index ---\")\n    for i in range(len(distance_categories)):\n        component = share_of_total_trips[i] * proposed_total_car_share[i] * avg_trip_distance[i]\n        proposed_vmt_components.append(component)\n        print(f\"Category '{distance_categories[i]}':\")\n        print(f\"  Car Share = {proposed_car_1_occupant[i]} + {proposed_car_multi_occupant[i]} = {proposed_total_car_share[i]:.2f}\")\n        print(f\"  VMT Component = {share_of_total_trips[i]} * {proposed_total_car_share[i]:.2f} * {avg_trip_distance[i]} = {component:.4f}\\n\")\n        \n    proposed_vmt_index = sum(proposed_vmt_components)\n    print(f\"Total Proposed VMT Index = {' + '.join([f'{c:.4f}' for c in proposed_vmt_components])} = {proposed_vmt_index:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 4: Calculate Percentage Reduction ---\n    print(\"--- Calculating Percentage Reduction in VMT ---\")\n    vmt_reduction = baseline_vmt_index - proposed_vmt_index\n    percentage_reduction = (vmt_reduction / baseline_vmt_index) * 100\n    \n    print(\"Final Equation: ((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100\")\n    print(f\"Percentage Reduction = (({baseline_vmt_index:.4f} - {proposed_vmt_index:.4f}) / {baseline_vmt_index:.4f}) * 100\")\n    print(f\"Percentage Reduction = ({vmt_reduction:.4f} / {baseline_vmt_index:.4f}) * 100 = {percentage_reduction:.1f}%\")\n    \n    # Final answer format\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"\\n<<<{percentage_reduction:.1f}>>>\")\n\nsolve_vmt_reduction()\n```"
