    "My plan is to identify the author for each of the nine artworks displayed in the image grid. I will analyze them one by one, from left to right and top to bottom, by examining their artistic style, subject matter, and any visible signatures or seals.\n\n1.  **Top-left:** This is a playful ink wash painting of fish with human faces. This whimsical and fluid style is characteristic of the contemporary Chinese artist **Zhu Xuanxian**.\n2.  **Top-middle:** A traditional Chinese ink wash painting of chrysanthemums. The strong brushwork for the leaves and rocks contrasted with the delicate rendering of the flowers is a hallmark of the master **Qi Baishi**.\n3.  **Top-right:** This is a highly realistic oil painting portrait of an elderly woman from the Yi ethnic group. This style, known for its powerful and empathetic depiction of rural people, is the signature of **Luo Zhongli**.\n4.  **Middle-left:** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in a dynamic and flowing cursive script. The style is that of the Song Dynasty master **Mi Fu**, known for his energetic and individualistic brushwork.\n5.  **Middle-center:** A modern painting blending abstract circles (representing celestial bodies) with a landscape rendered in traditional brushstrokes. This fusion of Western modernism and Chinese artistic tradition is the iconic style of **Wu Guanzhong**.\n6.  **Middle-right:** This is an example of elegant and well-structured regular script calligraphy. This style, known for its grace and slender strength, belongs to the early Tang Dynasty master **Chu Suiliang**.\n7.  **Bottom-left:** This is a piece of \"wild cursive\" script, characterized by its highly expressive and untamed energy. This is a famous style perfected by the Tang Dynasty calligrapher **Huaisu**.\n8.  **Bottom-middle:** A realistic oil portrait of a young woman against a background of leaves. This refined and classicizing realism is the celebrated style of **Jin Shangyi**.\n9.  **Bottom-right:** A stylized painting of a woman in decorative attire. The distinctive elongated figure, use of elegant lines, and fusion of Chinese and Western techniques are characteristic of the modern master **Lin Fengmian**.\n\nNow, I will generate the Python code to list these authors in the correct order.\n\n```python\ndef find_authors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the authors of the 9 artworks.\n    \"\"\"\n    authors = [\n        \"Zhu Xuanxian\",\n        \"Qi Baishi\",\n        \"Luo Zhongli\",\n        \"Mi Fu\",\n        \"Wu Guanzhong\",\n        \"Chu Suiliang\",\n        \"Huaisu\",\n        \"Jin Shangyi\",\n        \"Lin Fengmian\"\n    ]\n    \n    print(\"The authors of the 9 works, from left to right and top to bottom, are:\")\n    for i, author in enumerate(authors, 1):\n        print(f\"{i}. {author}\")\n\nfind_authors()\n```\n<<<Zhu Xuanxian, Qi Baishi, Luo Zhongli, Mi Fu, Wu Guanzhong, Chu Suiliang, Huaisu, Jin Shangyi, Lin Fengmian>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Based on the information (e.g., style), please tell me, from left to right, from top to bottom, who is the author of each of the 9 works?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
