    "Based on the visual evidence provided in the histopathology slides, I will identify the key pathological features to arrive at a diagnosis. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Image Analysis**: I will examine the main image and the cropped sections to identify the primary tissue type and any abnormalities present. The image clearly shows a kidney glomerulus.\n2.  **Feature Identification**: I will look for specific pathological changes within the glomerulus. The most striking feature is a large, cellular, crescent-shaped formation within Bowman's space, which is compressing the glomerular tuft.\n3.  **Diagnosis Formulation**: The presence of this \"cellular crescent\" is the defining characteristic of a specific type of glomerular disease.\n4.  **Code Generation**: I will create a Python script that prints out the final diagnosis and a brief explanation of the key features that lead to this conclusion, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_histopathology():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a histopathological diagnosis based on the visual\n    evidence of a cellular crescent in the provided image of a glomerulus.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The diagnosis is based on the key feature observed in the image.\n    key_feature = \"a large, hypercellular, crescent-shaped structure filling Bowman's space and compressing the glomerular tuft\"\n    diagnosis = \"Crescentic glomerulonephritis\"\n\n    # Print the final diagnosis and the reasoning.\n    print(f\"Histopathological Diagnosis: {diagnosis}\")\n    print(\"\\nReasoning:\")\n    print(f\"The image displays the hallmark feature of this condition: {key_feature}.\")\n    print(\"This 'cellular crescent' is formed by the proliferation of parietal epithelial cells and infiltrating inflammatory cells, which is the defining characteristic of Crescentic Glomerulonephritis.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    diagnose_histopathology()\n```\n<<<Crescentic glomerulonephritis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the histopathological diagnosis of this image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
