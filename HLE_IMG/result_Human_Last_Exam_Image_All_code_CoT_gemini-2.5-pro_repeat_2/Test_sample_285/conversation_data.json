    "To determine which triangulation violates the empty circle property of Delaunay triangulations, we need to find a triangle in one of the figures whose circumcircle (the circle passing through its three vertices) contains another point from the set.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Estimate Coordinates**: I will assign approximate coordinates to the 7 points shown in the diagrams. The exact values are not critical, as long as their relative positions are accurate.\n2.  **Identify a Suspect Triangle**: Visually, long, thin \"sliver\" triangles are often non-Delaunay because their circumcircles tend to be very large. Triangulation C contains several such triangles. I will focus on the triangle formed by vertices `P1` (top-right), `C1` (inner-right), and `C2` (inner-bottom).\n3.  **Identify a Test Point**: For the chosen triangle `(P1, C1, C2)`, the nearby point `P2` (bottom-right) is a likely candidate to be inside its circumcircle.\n4.  **Perform the In-Circle Test**: I will use a standard computational geometry test, the \"in-circle test\", to mathematically verify if `P2` lies inside the circumcircle of `(P1, C1, C2)`. This test calculates a determinant based on the coordinates of the four points. A positive result indicates that the point is inside the circle.\n5.  **Conclusion**: If the test is positive, it confirms that triangulation C violates the empty circle property.\n\n### Execution:\n\nThe python code below defines the coordinates and performs the in-circle test for the identified case in triangulation C.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef check_violation_in_C():\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if triangulation C violates the Delaunay empty circle property\n    by testing if point P2 is inside the circumcircle of triangle (P1, C1, C2).\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
