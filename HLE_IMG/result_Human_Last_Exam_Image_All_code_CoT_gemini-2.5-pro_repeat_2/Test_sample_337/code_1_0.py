    print("  - This means for all three systems, increasing the Lewis number causes a transition from a stable state to an oscillatory/chaotic one.")
    print("  - Conclusion: This option presents a consistent physical rule (higher Le is destabilizing) across all systems. Although the system mapping is unusual, this is the only internally consistent option among the choices.")
