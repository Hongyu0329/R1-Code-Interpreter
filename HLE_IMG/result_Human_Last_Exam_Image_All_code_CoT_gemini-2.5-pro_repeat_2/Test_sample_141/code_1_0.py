    # Step 1: Analyze pair B (C3 and C5)
    print("\n1. Analysis of Protons C3 and C5 (Ring C):")
    print("   - Protons C3 and C5 are meta-protons on the terminal phenyl ring C.")
    print("   - Rotation around the single bond connecting ring C to the imine carbon is fast on the NMR timescale.")
    print("   - This rapid rotation makes the two meta positions (3 and 5) chemically equivalent.")
    print("   - Conclusion: The pair C3 and C5 is EQUIVALENT.")

    # Step 2: Analyze the molecule's overall symmetry and dynamic behavior
    print("\n2. Analysis of Overall Molecular Symmetry (affecting rings A, B, and D):")
    print("   - The central pyridinium ring B is symmetrically substituted at positions 2 and 6 with identical pyridyl rings (A and D).")
    print("   - However, the substituent at position 4, the hydrazone group (-NH-N=CH-Ph), is not symmetric.")
    print("   - Equivalence of the left and right sides of the molecule depends on the rotation around the C4-N bond.")
    print("   - Assuming this rotation is fast on the NMR timescale at 220 K, the environments of the left and right sides are averaged, creating an effective plane of symmetry.")

    # Step 3: Analyze pair A (B3a and B3b)
    print("\n3. Analysis of Protons B3a and B3b (Ring B):")
    print("   - These protons are on the central ring B.")
    print("   - The effective plane of symmetry caused by fast rotation makes B3a and B3b mirror images and thus chemically equivalent.")
    print("   - Conclusion: The pair B3a and B3b is EQUIVALENT.")

    # Step 4: Analyze pair D (D3 and A3)
    print("\n4. Analysis of Protons D3 and A3 (Rings D and A):")
    print("   - The effective plane of symmetry also makes the entire pyridyl ring A equivalent to ring D.")
    print("   - As a result, corresponding protons on these two rings, such as A3 and D3, are chemically equivalent.")
    print("   - Conclusion: The pair D3 and A3 is EQUIVALENT.")

    # Step 5: Analyze pair C (C2 and C4)
    print("\n5. Analysis of Protons C2 and C4 (Ring C):")
    print("   - These protons are on the same phenyl ring C.")
    print("   - C2 is an ortho-proton and C4 is a para-proton.")
    print("   - These positions are constitutionally distinct and are never equivalent.")
    print("   - Conclusion: The pair C2 and C4 is NOT EQUIVALENT.")
