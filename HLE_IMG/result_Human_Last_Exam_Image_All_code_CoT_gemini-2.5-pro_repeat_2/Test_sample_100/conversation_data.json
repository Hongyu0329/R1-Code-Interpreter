    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the molecular formula of the product.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:** I will first identify the structure of the starting material. Based on the arrangement of atoms, it appears to be a `2-(p-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one`, which is a derivative of the well-known Vince lactam. This is a bicyclic lactam (a cyclic amide).\n2.  **Analyze Reaction 1 (CAN, ACN/H2O):** Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) is a standard reagent used to remove the *p*-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group from a nitrogen atom. This reaction cleaves the N-PMB bond and replaces it with an N-H bond, forming `Intermediate 1`. I will calculate the change in the molecular formula.\n3.  **Analyze Reaction 2 (Pd/C, H2):** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas (H2) will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the ring to a single bond (C-C). This adds two hydrogen atoms to the molecule, forming `Intermediate 2`.\n4.  **Analyze Reaction 3 (4 N HCl, 70 Â°C):** These conditions (strong acid and heat) cause the hydrolysis of the lactam (cyclic amide) in `Intermediate 2`. This reaction breaks the amide bond by adding one molecule of water (H2O), opening the bicyclic ring system to form a substituted cyclopentane amino acid, which is the final `Product`.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Formula:** I will write a Python script that starts with the formula of `Intermediate 1` and applies the atomic changes from steps 2 and 3 to calculate the final molecular formula of the product.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and display the result.\n\n```python\ndef add_formulas(formula1, formula2):\n    \"\"\"Combines two molecular formulas represented as dictionaries.\"\"\"\n    result = formula1.copy()\n    for atom, count in formula2.items():\n        result[atom] = result.get(atom, 0) + count\n    return result\n\ndef format_formula(formula):\n    \"\"\"Formats a dictionary of atoms into a standard molecular formula string.\"\"\"\n    # Standard order: C, H, then alphabetical for the rest\n    order = ['C', 'H']\n    other_atoms = sorted([atom for atom in formula.keys() if atom not in order])\n    full_order = order + other_atoms\n    \n    formula_str = \"\"\n    for atom in full_order:\n        if atom in formula:\n            count = formula[atom]\n            formula_str += atom\n            if count > 1:\n                formula_str += str(count)\n    return formula_str\n\n# Based on the analysis, Intermediate 1 is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n# Its molecular formula is calculated as follows:\n# Core skeleton (C7), Hydrogens (H6), Fluorines (F3), Nitrogen (N1), Oxygen (O1).\nintermediate_1_formula = {'C': 7, 'H': 6, 'F': 3, 'N': 1, 'O': 1}\n\n# Step 2: Hydrogenation adds two hydrogen atoms (H2).\nhydrogen_molecule = {'H': 2}\nintermediate_2_formula = add_formulas(intermediate_1_formula, hydrogen_molecule)\n\n# Step 3: Hydrolysis adds one water molecule (H2O).\nwater_molecule = {'H': 2, 'O': 1}\nproduct_formula = add_formulas(intermediate_2_formula, water_molecule)\n\nprint(\"Step-by-step determination of the molecular formula:\")\nprint(f\"1. Formula after deprotection (Intermediate 1): {format_formula(intermediate_1_formula)}\")\nprint(f\"2. Formula after hydrogenation (Intermediate 2): {format_formula(intermediate_2_formula)}\")\nprint(f\"3.
