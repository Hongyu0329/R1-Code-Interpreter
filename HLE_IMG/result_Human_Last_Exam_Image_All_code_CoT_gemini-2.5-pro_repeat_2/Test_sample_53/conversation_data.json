    "This is a depiction of a famous myth from ancient Greece on an Apulian red-figure vase. The scene shows the conclusion of the chariot race between Pelops and King Oenomaus.\n\n1.  **The Driver:** The figure driving the chariot, wearing an ornate helmet and patterned sleeve, is Pelops.\n2.  **The Fallen Figure:** The man lying dead on the ground, over whom the chariot passes, is King Oenomaus. He stipulated that any suitor for his daughter's hand must beat him in a chariot race; if they lost, they would be killed.\n3.  **The Passenger:** The woman in the chariot with Pelops is the prize of the race, Oenomaus's daughter, Hippodamia. Pelops won the race (and her hand in marriage) by sabotaging Oenomaus's chariot. She is being carried away by the victor.\n4.  **The Winged Figure:** A winged figure, likely Eros (the god of love) or Nike (the goddess of victory), flies above, symbolizing Pelops's divinely-favored victory and the union with Hippodamia.\n\nThe question asks for the figure \"leaving the chariot.\" This refers to the passenger, who is being carried away from the scene of the race with the victorious driver. This figure is Hippodamia.\n\n```python\ndef identify_figure():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the figures in the mythological scene depicted on the Greek vase.\n    The scene is the end of the chariot race between Pelops and Oenomaus.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The figure driving the chariot is the hero Pelops.\n    driver = \"Pelops\"\n    \n    # The figure lying on the ground is King Oenomaus, who was killed in the race.\n    fallen_figure = \"Oenomaus\"\n    \n    # The figure leaving in the chariot with the driver is the king's daughter,\n    # whose hand in marriage was the prize for the race.\n    figure_leaving_in_chariot = \"Hippodamia\"\n    \n    print(\"The scene depicts the myth of Pelops and Hippodamia.\")\n    print(f\"The driver of the chariot is {driver}.\")\n    print(f\"The man on the ground is {fallen_figure}.\")\n    print(\"The figure leaving in the chariot with the driver is the princess he has just won.\")\n    print(\"\\nHer name is:\")\n    print(figure_leaving_in_chariot)\n\nidentify_figure()\n```\n<<<Hippodamia>>>"
