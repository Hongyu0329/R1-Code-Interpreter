    print("  - The starting material is a cyclobutene derivative, which contains a four-membered ring with one double bond.")
    print("  - The reaction is carried out under thermal conditions (indicated by Δ).")
    print("  - Thermally, cyclobutenes undergo electrocyclic ring-opening to form 1,3-butadienes.")
    print("  - This reaction involves 4π electrons (2 from the π bond and 2 from the breaking σ bond).")
    print("  - According to Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a thermal 4π electrocyclic reaction is conrotatory.")
    print("  - Therefore, the first step is a 4π conrotatory electrocyclic reaction.")

    # Step 2: Analyze the second reaction
    print("\n2. Analysis of the second reaction step:")
    print("  - The intermediate from the first step is a conjugated system that includes the aldehyde group.")
    print("  - This forms a 1-oxa-1,3,5-hexatriene system, which has 6π electrons.")
    print("  - This intermediate undergoes a thermal ring-closing reaction to form the final six-membered pyran ring.")
    print("  - This is best described as a 6π electrocyclization, which is disrotatory under thermal conditions.")
    
    # Step 3: Compare with the given options and conclude
    print("\n3. Conclusion:")
    print("  - The detailed mechanism is a 4π conrotatory electrocyclic opening followed by a 6π disrotatory electrocyclization.")
    print("  - This exact sequence is not available in the options.")
    print("  - However, we can eliminate options based on the first step. Only option B correctly identifies the first step as a '4π conrotatory electrocyclization'.")
    print("  - Options A, C, D, E, F, G, and H all describe the first step incorrectly.")
    print("  - Option B describes the second step as a '[4+2] cycloaddition'. While this is technically an inaccurate description for this specific mechanism, it is the only plausible choice given that the first step is correctly identified.")
