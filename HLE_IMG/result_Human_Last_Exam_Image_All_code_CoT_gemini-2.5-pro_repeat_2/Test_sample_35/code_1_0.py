        "Explanation: The diagram shows that S100B binding to its RAGE receptor initiates signaling pathways (NFkB, JNK/JUN) that result in key pathological outcomes: neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. "
        "Because S100B triggers these core disease processes, its expression level likely correlates with the severity and rate of disease progression. "
        "Therefore, measuring S100B levels could help predict the future course of the disorder for a patient, which is the function of a prognostic marker. "
        "While it could also serve as an adjunct marker, its involvement in multiple different diseases (neurological and cardiovascular) limits its specificity for diagnosing any single condition."
