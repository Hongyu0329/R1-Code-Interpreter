    "To determine the time complexity of the given sorting algorithm, we will analyze its recursive structure and formulate a recurrence relation for its running time in the worst-case scenario.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Algorithm:** We will examine the pseudocode to understand its behavior. The function `sort(a, n)` calls itself, so it's a recursive algorithm. The key is to see how many recursive calls are made in each step.\n2.  **Identify the Worst Case:** The number of recursive calls depends on the `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` condition. The worst case occurs when this condition is always true, as this triggers a second recursive call, maximizing the work done. A reverse-sorted array is a perfect example of a worst-case input.\n3.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation:** We will define `T(n)` as the time taken to sort an array of size `n` in the worst case. Based on the analysis, we'll write an equation for `T(n)` in terms of `T(n-1)`.\n4.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:** We will solve the recurrence relation to find a closed-form expression for `T(n)`, which will give us the time complexity in Big O notation.\n5.  **Verify with Code:** We will write a Python script that implements the algorithm and counts the number of recursive calls for worst-case inputs of increasing size `n`. This will empirically demonstrate the exponential growth predicted by the theoretical analysis.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\nThe algorithm is:\n`def sort(a, n):`\n`  if n > 1:`\n`    sort(a, n - 1)`\n`    if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:`\n`      swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`\n`      sort(a, n - 1)`\n\nLet `T(n)` be the worst-case time complexity.\n- The first recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` takes `T(n-1)` time.\n- The comparison `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` and the potential `swap` take constant time, `O(1)`.\n- In the worst case, the `if` condition is true, and the second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` is executed. This also takes `T(n-1)` time.\n\nThis gives us the recurrence relation:\n`T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-1) + O(1) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n\nThe base case is `T(1)`, which is constant time, `O(1)`.\n\nSolving the recurrence relation:\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n`T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n`T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 7c = 2^3 * T(n-3) + (2^3 - 1)c`\nGeneralizing this, we get: `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-1) - 1)c`\nThis shows that `T(n)` grows proportionally to `2^n`. Therefore, the time complexity is `O(2^n)`.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this analysis by implementing the algorithm, explaining the recurrence relation, and showing the number of function calls for a worst-case scenario.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# It's necessary to increase the recursion limit for this inefficient algorithm,\n# even for small n.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(3000)\n\n# Global counter for function calls to measure complexity\ncall_count = 0\n\ndef swap(arr, i, j):\n    \"\"\"Swaps two elements in a list.\"\"\"\n    arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n\ndef sort_instrumented(a, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    The sorting algorithm from the problem, instrumented with a counter\n    to track the number of recursive calls.\n    \"\"\"\n    global call_count\n    call_count += 1\n    \n    if n > 1:\n        sort_instrumented(a, n - 1)\n        # In Python, list indices are 0-based.\n        # The pseudocode's a[n-1] and a[n-2] correspond to the same indices.\n        if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n            swap(a, n - 1, n - 2)\n            sort_instrumented(a, n - 1)\n\ndef analyze_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the complexity by running the sort on worst-case inputs\n    and printing the number of recursive calls.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"### Empirical Verification ###\")\n    print(\"\\nRunning the algorithm on a worst-case input (a reverse-sorted array)\")\n    print(\"and counting the number of recursive calls.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"{'n':<5}{'Recursive Calls':<20}{'2^n - 1':<20}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    # We can't test large n due to exponential complexity and recursion depth\n    for n in range(1, 16):\n        global call_count\n        call_count = 0\n        \n        # Create a worst-case array (e.g., for n=5, arr = [4, 3, 2, 1, 0])\n        worst_case_array = list(range(n - 1, -1, -1))\n        \n        try:\n            # We pass the list and its length, as per the pseudocode\n            sort_instrumented(worst_case_array, n)\n            expected_calls = 2**n - 1\n            print(f\"{n:<5}{call_count:<20}{expected_calls:<20}\")\n            \n            # Sanity check to ensure the array is actually sorted\n            if worst_case_array != list(range(n)):\n                print(f\"Error: Array not sorted for n={n}\")\n\n        except RecursionError:\n            print(f\"{n:<5}{'Recursion limit reached':<20}\")\n            break\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function to explain the analysis and run the verification.\"\"\"\n    print(\"### Analysis of the Algorithm's Time Complexity ###\")\n    print(\"\\nTo find the time complexity, we derive and solve its recurrence relation.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Formulate the Recurrence Relation\")\n    print(\"Let T(n) be the number of operations for an input of size n in the worst case.\")\n    print(\"The worst case occurs when the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is always true,\")\n    print(\"triggering two recursive calls for a problem of size n-1.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe recurrence relation is: T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-1) + c\")\n    print(\"T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c  (where c is a constant for the compare/swap operations)\")\n    print(\"The base case is T(1) = c'.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Solve the Recurrence Relation\")\n    print(\"We can solve this by expansion, showing each number in the equation:\")\n    print(\"For T(1) = 1, c = 1 (counting calls):\")\n    print(\"T(1) = 1                  = 2^1 - 1\")\n    print(\"T(2) = 2 * T(1) + 1 = 2 * 1 + 1 = 3  = 2^2 - 1\")\n    print(\"T(3) = 2 * T(2) + 1 = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7  = 2^3 - 1\")\n    print(\"T(4) = 2 * T(3) + 1 = 2 * 7 + 1 = 15 = 2^4 - 1\")\n    print(\"\\nThis pattern shows that T(n) = 2^n - 1.\")\n    print(\"Since the number of operations is proportional to 2^n, the time complexity is O(2^n).\")\n    \n    # Run the code to provide empirical evidence\n    analyze_complexity()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
