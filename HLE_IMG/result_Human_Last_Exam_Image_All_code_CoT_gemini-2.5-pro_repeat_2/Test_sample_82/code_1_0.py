    This function determines the location of the new double bond in the product of the given intramolecular Heck reaction.

    The reaction proceeds via:
    1. Oxidative addition of Pd(0) into the C9-Br bond.
    2. Migratory insertion: The C9-Pd moiety adds across the C4=C5 double bond. The product shows a C5-C9 bond, so the Pd atom becomes attached to C4.
    3. Beta-hydride elimination: A hydrogen from a carbon adjacent to C4 is eliminated with the Pd. The adjacent carbon with an available hydrogen for productive elimination is C3.
    4. This elimination forms a new double bond between C3 and C4.
