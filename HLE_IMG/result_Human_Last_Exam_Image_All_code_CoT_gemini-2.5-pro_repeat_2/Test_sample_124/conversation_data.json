    "To find the total current flowing from the voltage source, we need to calculate the total equivalent resistance of the circuit and then apply Ohm's Law (I = V/R).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the circuit:** The circuit consists of a 1V voltage source connected to two parallel branches.\n2.  **Simplify the left branch:**\n    *   The resistors R1, R2, and R3 are arranged vertically.\n    *   There is a wire connecting the top of the circuit (positive terminal of V2) to the node between R1 and R2. This creates a parallel path with R1 where the wire has 0 resistance, effectively short-circuiting R1.\n    *   There is another wire connecting the top of the circuit to the node between R2 and R3. This wire is in parallel with the already-shorted R1 and R2 in series, but more simply, it's in parallel with R2 (since the top of R2 is now effectively connected to the top rail). This short-circuits R2.\n    *   Therefore, the current bypasses R1 and R2 through the wires and flows only through R3. The equivalent resistance of this entire left branch is just R3 (9 Ω).\n3.  **Simplify the right branch:**\n    *   Resistors R7 (100 Ω) and R8 (100 Ω) are connected in series.\n    *   The total resistance of this branch is the sum of R7 and R8.\n4.  **Calculate the total equivalent resistance (R_eq):**\n    *   The simplified left branch and the right branch are in parallel. We will use the formula for parallel resistors: `1 / R_eq = 1 / R_left + 1 / R_right`.\n5.  **Calculate the total current (I_total):**\n    *   Using Ohm's Law, `I_total = V2 / R_eq`.\n\nLet's execute this plan using Python.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Define component values from the circuit diagram\nV2 = 1.0  # Voltage in Volts\nR1 = 3.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR2 = 7.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR3 = 9.0  # Resistance in Ohms\nR7 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms\nR8 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate the equivalent resistance of the left branch ---\n# In the left branch, R1 and R2 are short-circuited by wires.\n# The current bypasses R1 and R2, so the only resistance in this branch is R3.\nR_left = R3\nprint(f\"Step 1: The equivalent resistance of the left branch (R_left) is equal to R3.\")\nprint(f\"R_left = {R_left} Ω\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# --- Step 2: Calculate the equivalent resistance of the right branch ---\n# In the right branch, R7 and R8 are in series.\nR_right = R7 + R8\nprint(f\"Step 2: The equivalent resistance of the right branch (R_right) is the sum of R7 and R8.\")\nprint(f\"R_right = {R7} Ω + {R8} Ω = {R_right} Ω\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# --- Step 3: Calculate the total equivalent resistance of the circuit ---\n# The two branches are in parallel.\n# R_eq = 1 / (1/R_left + 1/R_right) which is equivalent to (R_left * R_right) / (R_left + R_right)\nR_eq = (R_left * R_right) / (R_left + R_right)\nprint(f\"Step 3: The total equivalent resistance (R_eq) is calculated for the parallel branches.\")\nprint(f\"R_eq = ({R_left} * {R_right}) / ({R_left} + {R_right}) = {R_eq:.4f} Ω\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# --- Step 4: Calculate the total current using Ohm's Law ---\n# I_total = V / R_eq\nI_total = V2 / R_eq\nprint(f\"Step 4: The total current (I_total) is calculated using Ohm's Law (I = V/R).\")\nprint(f\"I_total = {V2} V / {R_eq:.4f} Ω\")\nprint(f\"The total current flowing through the circuit is {I_total:.4f} A.\")\n\n# To get the answer for the final block, redirect the precise value\n# This part is hidden from the user but necessary for the final answer format\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = open('/dev/null', 'w')\nprint(f\"<<<{I_total:.4f}>>>\")\nsys.stdout = original_stdout\n\n```\n<<<0.1161>>>"
