The primary vector for Lyme disease in North America is the deer tick (Ixodes scapularis), which looks different (females have a solid black scutum and a reddish body). While the American Dog Tick can carry other diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, it is not considered a competent vector for transmitting Lyme disease to humans."
