Yes, there is evidence of insect activity. The most noticeable evidence is the white, woolly gall on the twig of the oak tree. This gall is formed when an insect, most likely a cynipid wasp (gall wasp), lays its egg(s) inside the plant tissue. The plant reacts to the chemicals injected by the wasp, forming the gall structure around the developing larva. Therefore, the egg is laid inside the gall.
