    Analysis of the reaction:
    1. The starting material is 1-(cyclohex-2-en-1-yl)-2-methoxypent-3-en-1-ol.
    2. The reaction condition is heat.
    3. The stereochemistry shows that the hydrogen on carbon 1 and the methoxy group on carbon 2 are in an anti-periplanar conformation.
    4. This geometry is ideal for an E2 elimination reaction.
    5. The reaction is the thermal elimination of methanol (CH3OH) to form a new double bond.
    6. The resulting product is a conjugated diene: 1-(cyclohex-2-en-1-yl)penta-1,3-diene.
