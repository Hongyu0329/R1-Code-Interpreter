    "My plan to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the Stereocenters**: I will first identify all the chiral centers in the molecule.\n2.  **Determine IUPAC Numbering**: I will determine the longest carbon chain that includes the principal functional group (-OH) to assign the correct IUPAC numbering (C1, C2, C3, etc.) to the stereocenters.\n3.  **Assign Priorities (CIP Rules)**: For each stereocenter, I will assign priorities (1-4) to the four attached groups based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n4.  **Determine R/S Configuration**: For each stereocenter, I will orient the molecule so that the lowest priority group (4) is pointing away from the viewer. I will then trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3. A clockwise path indicates 'R' configuration, and a counter-clockwise path indicates 'S' configuration. If the lowest priority group is pointing towards the viewer, the result is reversed.\n5.  **Combine the Results**: I will combine the configurations for all stereocenters to give the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the absolute configuration (R/S) of the provided molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify Stereocenters and IUPAC Numbering\")\n    print(\"The molecule is a substituted pentane derivative.\")\n    print(\"The principal functional group is the hydroxyl (-OH) group, so it is an alcohol (pentan-2-ol).\")\n    print(\"Numbering the longest carbon chain (5 carbons) from left to right to give the -OH group the lowest number (position 2):\")\n    print(\"   CH3(1)-CH(OH)(2)-CH(Et)(3)-CH(NH2)(4)-CH3(5)\")\n    print(\"The IUPAC name is 4-amino-3-ethylpentan-2-ol.\")\n    print(\"There are three stereocenters at positions C2, C3, and C4.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Determine Configuration of C2\")\n    print(\"Groups attached to C2: -OH, -CH(Et)...

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
