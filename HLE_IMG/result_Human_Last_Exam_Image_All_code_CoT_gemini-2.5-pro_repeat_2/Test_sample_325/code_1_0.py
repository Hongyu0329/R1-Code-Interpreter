def solve_diffusion_reaction_plots():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the plot analysis task.
    
    The analysis is as follows:
    1. Plot 2 is the baseline ('0').
    2. Plot 4 shows a very flat concentration profile for reactant A, indicating rapid diffusion. This corresponds to doubling the diffusion coefficient ('D').
    3. Plot 1 shows a very steep concentration profile for A, indicating slow diffusion (diffusion limitation). This corresponds to halving the diffusion coefficient ('d').
    4. Plot 3 shows a much faster reaction than baseline (A is lower, B is higher). The profile shape is similar to the baseline, suggesting a uniform increase in reaction rate. This corresponds to doubling the rate constant ('K').
    5. Plots 5 and 6 show slower reactions. Plot 6 is visibly slower than Plot 5.
    6. Halving the rate constant ('k') slows the reaction. Doubling the reaction order ('N') also slows the reaction (since c_A < 1), and typically has a more pronounced effect, especially at low concentrations. The flat bottom of the concentration profile in Plot 6 is also characteristic of a high reaction order. Thus, Plot 6 corresponds to 'N', and Plot 5 corresponds to 'k'.
    
    The final sequence for plots 1-6 is d, 0, K, D, k, N.
