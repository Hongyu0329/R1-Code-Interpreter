    "My plan is to identify the artist's signature in the painting and then use that information to find the artist's full name.\n\n1.  **Examine the image for a signature:** I will look closely at the provided images, especially the corners, where artists typically sign their work.\n2.  **Locate and read the signature:** The last cropped image clearly shows a signature in the bottom right corner. It appears to read \"Augusto Pinillos 38\".\n3.  **Research the artist:** Based on the signature, I will search for an artist named \"Augusto Pinillos\".\n4.  **Determine the full name:** Research confirms the artist is Augusto Pinillos Pastor, a prominent Peruvian painter. The \"38\" likely refers to the year 1938.\n5.  **Generate the code:** I will write a Python script to print the full name of the artist.\n\n```python\n# The signature in the bottom right corner of the painting reads \"Augusto Pinillos 38\".\n# This corresponds to the Peruvian painter Augusto Pinillos Pastor.\nartist_full_name = \"Augusto Pinillos Pastor\"\nprint(artist_full_name)\n```\n<<<Augusto Pinillos Pastor>>>"
