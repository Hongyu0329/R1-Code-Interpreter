    "The task is to identify a country based on Google Trends data for three of its historical events.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Graph:** I will first examine the provided Google Trends graph to identify the timing of the recurring peaks for each of the three colored lines (red, blue, and yellow). The x-axis provides the timeline, which will help in pinpointing the approximate month of these annual events.\n2.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:** Based on the annual timing of the peaks, I will hypothesize which historical events or national holidays they might represent. The key is that all three events must be significant within a single country.\n    *   The **red line** shows a prominent peak every year in late January / early February.\n    *   The **blue line** shows a smaller peak every year around May.\n    *   The **yellow line** shows a very sharp peak every year in early October, including the graph's maximum peak.\n3.  **Identify the Country:** I will search for a country that has significant national commemorations matching this pattern. The combination of late January, May, and early October is distinctive. My preliminary analysis points towards Germany:\n    *   **Late January:** Holocaust Remembrance Day (January 27th).\n    *   **May:** Victory in Europe Day (May 8th).\n    *   **Early October:** German Unity Day (October 3rd), which is Germany's national day.\n4.  **Confirm with Code:** I will write a Python script to formalize this conclusion. The script will define the three events, their dates, and their corresponding colors on the graph, and then print a clear summary that explains the reasoning and states the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_country_from_trends():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the pattern of three historical events from a Google Trends graph\n    to identify the associated country.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Based on the graph, we identified three annually recurring peaks.\n    # We hypothesize these correspond to significant German memorial days.\n    \n    events = {\n        'Red Line': {\n            'Event': 'Holocaust Remembrance Day',\n            'Date': 'January 27th',\n            'Reasoning': 'Corresponds to the annual peaks in late January.'\n        },\n        'Blue Line': {\n            'Event': 'Victory in Europe Day (Tag der Befreiung)',\n            'Date': 'May 8th',\n            'Reasoning': 'Corresponds to the annual peaks in May, marking the end of WWII in Europe.'\n        },\n        'Yellow Line': {\n            'Event': 'German Unity Day (Tag der Deutschen Einheit)',\n            'Date': 'October 3rd',\n            'Reasoning': 'Corresponds to the sharp annual peaks in early October.
