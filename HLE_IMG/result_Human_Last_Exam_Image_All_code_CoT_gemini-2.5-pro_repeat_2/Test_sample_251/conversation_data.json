    "To determine the longest R-R interval, we first need to understand the calibration of the ECG strip.\n\n1.  **ECG Paper Speed**: The text at the top left says \"25 mm/sec\". This means that every 25 millimeters on the horizontal axis represents 1 second of time.\n2.  **Grid Dimensions**: Standard ECG paper has small squares of 1 mm and large squares of 5 mm.\n3.  **Time per Square**:\n    *   Time for one small square (1 mm) = 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n    *   Time for one large square (5 mm) = 5 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.2 seconds.\n4.  **Identify the Longest R-R Interval**: We need to find the largest gap between two consecutive R-waves (the tall peaks). Visually scanning the strip, we can see several long pauses. One of the clearest is on the second line of the tracing.\n5.  **Measure the Interval**: Let's measure the distance of this pause in terms of large squares. The R-wave before the pause and the R-wave after the pause are separated by approximately 8 large squares.\n6.  **Calculate the Time**: We can now calculate the duration of this interval in seconds.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Define the time represented by one large square on the ECG grid.\n#    - Paper speed = 25 mm/sec\n#    - Large square width = 5 mm\n#    - Time per large square = 5 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.2 seconds\n# 2. Visually determine the longest R-R interval in terms of large squares from the ECG image.\n#    - By inspection, the longest interval spans approximately 8 large squares.\n# 3. Calculate the total time in seconds for this interval.\n\n# Number of large squares for the longest R-R interval\nnum_large_squares = 8\n\n# Time in seconds for one large square\ntime_per_large_square = 0.2\n\n# Calculate the longest R-R interval in seconds\nlongest_rr_interval = num_large_squares * time_per_large_square\n\n# Print the calculation and the result\nprint(f\"The longest R-R interval is calculated by multiplying the number of large squares by the time per large square.\")\nprint(f\"Calculation: {num_large_squares} large squares * {time_per_large_square} seconds/large square = {longest_rr_interval:.1f} seconds\")\n```\n<<<1.6>>>"
