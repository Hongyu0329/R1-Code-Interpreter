    "I will identify the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n\n*   **Specimen H:** This is a reddish, porous rock. The holes, or vesicles, are formed by gas bubbles trapped in cooling lava. This type of rock is called **Scoria**. It is an extrusive igneous rock.\n*   **Specimen I:** This specimen is composed of various rock fragments (aggregate) held together by a fine-grained cement-like matrix. This is characteristic of a man-made material, specifically **Concrete**.\n*   **Specimen J:** This is a light-colored, highly vesicular, and low-density rock. Its appearance is classic for **Pumice**, an extrusive igneous rock formed from gas-rich, frothy lava.\n*   **Specimen K:** This rock has large, interlocking crystals that are clearly visible. This coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture indicates it cooled slowly deep underground, making it an intrusive igneous rock. It is composed of light-colored plagioclase feldspar and dark minerals like pyroxene. This composition is characteristic of **Gabbro**.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to list these identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Concrete',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Gabbro'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for letter, name in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {letter} is {name}.\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H is Scoria, I is Concrete, J is Pumice, K is Gabbro.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
