    "Answering this question requires deducing the structures of three chemical products (A, B, and C) from a complex reaction and their corresponding analytical data (Molecular Formula, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Reactants and Conditions**: The starting material is 2-(4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid. It reacts with excess methyl propiolate in the presence of acetic anhydride (Ac2O) and catalytic triethylamine (TEA) at 70Â°C. These conditions are characteristic of complex cycloaddition and rearrangement reactions.\n2.  **Analyze Product Data**: For each product (A, B, C), I will use the molecular formula to calculate the Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE), which indicates the total number of rings and pi bonds. I will then interpret the NMR data to identify key functional groups and structural fragments.\n3.  **Propose Structures**: Based on the analysis, I will propose a plausible chemical structure for each product. The reaction likely involves significant molecular rearrangement or fragmentation, as simple additions of the reagents to the starting material do not match the product formulas. The proposed structures will be the most logical fit for the provided data.\n4.  **Final Output**: The final structures will be provided in SMILES format within a Python script. The script will also verify the molecular formula and DBE of the proposed structures.\n\nThis is a highly challenging problem typically found in advanced organic chemistry or chemical olympiads. The proposed structures are based on a detailed analysis of the provided data.\n\n```python\n# The rdkit library is required for this script.\n# You can install it via pip: pip install rdkit-pypi\nimport rdkit\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem import Descriptors\n\ndef get_mol_info(smiles, name, target_formula):\n    \"\"\"Calculates and prints molecular formula and DBE for a SMILES string.\"\"\"\n    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)\n    if mol is None:\n        print(f\"Error: Could not parse the proposed SMILES for product {name}.\")\n        return\n        \n    formula = Descriptors.rdMolDescriptors.CalcMolFormula(mol)\n    dbe = Descriptors.calcNumDBE(mol)\n    \n    print(f\"Proposed Structure for Product {name}:\")\n    print(f\"  Target Formula: {target_formula}\")\n    print(f\"  Proposed SMILES: {smiles}\")\n    print(f\"  Calculated Formula from SMILES: {formula}\")\n    print(f\"  Calculated Degrees of Unsaturation (DBE): {dbe}\")\n    \n    if formula == target_formula:\n        print(\"  Status: Formula matches the provided data.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"  Status: Formula does not match the provided data.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\ndef solve_reaction_structures():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function proposes structures for products A, B, and C based on the reaction and\n    spectroscopic data provided.
