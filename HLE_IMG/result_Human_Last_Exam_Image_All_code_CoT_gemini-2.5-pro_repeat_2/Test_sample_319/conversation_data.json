    "My plan is to identify the phenomenon depicted in the image. The image shows a spectrogram and a waveform of a sound. By analyzing the visual representation of the sound, I can determine the specific auditory illusion being illustrated.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Spectrogram (top panel):** It begins with a single, stable horizontal line, which represents a pure tone of a constant frequency. This line is abruptly interrupted by a vertical bar, which signifies a sound containing a wide range of frequencies, such as a burst of white noise or a click. After the interruption, the tone appears to continue.\n2.  **Analyze the Waveform (bottom panel):** It starts as a clean, regular sine wave, which is the time-domain representation of a pure tone. This is followed by a sharp, complex transient corresponding to the noise burst. After this, the waveform continues, becoming more complex than the initial sine wave.\n3.  **Identify the Illusion:** This stimulus—a continuous sound (like a tone) that is physically interrupted and replaced by a short burst of a different sound (like noise)—is the classic setup for an auditory illusion. When presented to a listener, the brain often \"fills in\" the gap, leading to the perception that the original tone continued without interruption, with the noise simply layered on top of it.\n4.  **Name the Phenomenon:** This effect is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**. A famous, related example in the perception of speech is the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**. Given the stimulus is a simple tone, \"Auditory Continuity Illusion\" is the most accurate general term.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that states the name of this phenomenon.\n\n```python\ndef identify_phenomenon():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the perceptual phenomenon based on a visual representation of sound.\n\n    The image provided shows a spectrogram and a waveform for a classic auditory illusion.\n    - A continuous pure tone is played.\n    - It is interrupted by a short burst of noise.\n    - The tone then resumes.\n\n    Listeners typically perceive the tone as continuing through the noise, an illusion\n    that demonstrates the brain's ability to infer continuity in a noisy environment.\n    \"\"\"\n    phenomenon_name = \"Auditory continuity illusion\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"The phenomenon depicted is the Auditory Continuity Illusion. \"\n        \"In this auditory illusion, a sound is perceived as continuous even when \"\n        \"it is briefly interrupted by another sound. The brain essentially 'fills in' \"\n        \"the missing portion of the original sound.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(f\"Name of the phenomenon: {phenomenon_name}\")\n    print(f\"Explanation: {explanation}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    identify_phenomenon()\n```\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion>>>"
