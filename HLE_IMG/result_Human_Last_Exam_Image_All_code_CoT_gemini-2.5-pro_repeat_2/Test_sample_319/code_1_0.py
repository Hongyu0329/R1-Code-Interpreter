    Identifies the perceptual phenomenon based on a visual representation of sound.

    The image provided shows a spectrogram and a waveform for a classic auditory illusion.
    - A continuous pure tone is played.
    - It is interrupted by a short burst of noise.
    - The tone then resumes.

    Listeners typically perceive the tone as continuing through the noise, an illusion
    that demonstrates the brain's ability to infer continuity in a noisy environment.
