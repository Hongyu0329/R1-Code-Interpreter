    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to determine the Roman numeral for measure 30:\n\n1.  **Identify the Measure and Notes:** First, I will locate measure 30 in the provided sheet music. The measure is clearly marked by the circle. The notes in this measure are A, C-sharp, and E, played across both the right and left hands. These notes together form an A major chord.\n\n2.  **Determine the Overall Key:** The \"Pathetique\" Sonata's first movement is in the key of C minor. The key signature at the beginning of the piece is three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Harmonic Context:** A plain A major chord is not diatonic (native) to the key of C minor. The diatonic chord built on the sixth scale degree (A♭) would be A♭ major (A♭-C-E♭), which is the VI chord. Therefore, the A major chord must have a special function.\n\n4.  **Look at the Following Chord:** To understand the function of a non-diatonic chord, we must examine where it resolves. In the next measure (m. 31), the notes are D, F, and A, which form a D minor chord.\n\n5.  **Identify the Relationship:** The A major chord (m. 30) moves to the D minor chord (m. 31). An A major chord is the dominant (V) chord of D minor. This is a very common harmonic progression (V -> i).\n\n6.  **Apply Roman Numeral Theory:**\n    *   The D minor chord is the supertonic (the chord built on the second scale degree) in the key of C. In C minor, the diatonic supertonic is a D diminished chord (D-F-A♭), but it's extremely common to borrow the D minor chord from the parallel C major key. In Roman numerals, the supertonic is represented as 'ii'.\n    *   Since the A major chord is functioning as the dominant of the 'ii' chord (D minor), it is called a \"secondary dominant\".\n    *   The Roman numeral for a secondary dominant is written as \"V of ii\", or **V/ii**.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to print this analysis and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_harmony():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the harmony of measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, 1st movement.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify the notes in the measure\n    notes_in_measure_30 = [\"A\", \"C#\", \"E\"]\n    chord_in_measure_30 = \"A Major\"\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the chord in the following measure\n    notes_in_measure_31 = [\"D\", \"F\", \"A\"]\n    chord_in_measure_31 = \"D minor\"\n\n    # Step 3: Define the home key and the relationship between the chords\n    home_key = \"C minor\"\n    supertonic_chord = \"D minor (ii)\"\n    relationship = \"A Major is the dominant (V) of D minor.\"\n\n    # Step 4: Determine the Roman Numeral\n    roman_numeral = \"V/ii\"\n\n    # Print the analysis\n    print(\"Analysis of Beethoven 'Pathetique' Sonata, 1st mvt., measure 30:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"1.
