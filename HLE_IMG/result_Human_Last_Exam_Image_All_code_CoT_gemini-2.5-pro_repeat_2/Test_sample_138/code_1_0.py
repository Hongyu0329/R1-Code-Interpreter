# Step 1: Determine the sexes for Pair A.
# Based on the long antennae on both individuals, which is a male characteristic in many bee species, we identify them as Male, Male.
# This corresponds to option 1.
index_A = 1

# Step 2: Determine the sexes for Pair B.
# The wasp on the left has curled antennae, a definitive male trait in Polistes wasps.
# The wasp on the right has straight antennae, a female trait.
# This corresponds to option 3 (M, F).
index_B = 3

# Step 3: Determine the sexes for Pair C.
# The bee on the left has the characteristic very long antennae of a male long-horned bee.
# The bee on the right has much shorter antennae, indicating it is a female.
# This corresponds to option 3 (M, F).
index_C = 3

# Step 4: Print the final answer as a comma-separated string of indices.
print(f"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}")
