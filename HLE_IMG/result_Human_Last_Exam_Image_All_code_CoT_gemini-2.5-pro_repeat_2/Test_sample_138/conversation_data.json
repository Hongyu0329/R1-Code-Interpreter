    "To determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair, we will examine key morphological features known for sexual dimorphism in Hymenoptera (bees and wasps).\n\n**Analysis Plan:**\n\n1.  **Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):** I will compare the antennae length of the two individuals. In many bee species, males have longer antennae (13 segments) compared to females (12 segments).\n2.  **Pair B (Paper Wasps):** I will inspect the tips of the antennae. Male paper wasps (*Polistes*) have distinctly curled or hooked antennae tips, whereas females have straight antennae.\n3.  **Pair C (Long-horned Bees):** I will compare the antennae length. This group is named for the males' characteristically long antennae, which are significantly longer than the females' antennae.\n4.  **Synthesize Results:** Based on the visual evidence for each pair, I will select the corresponding index from the provided options and format the final answer as a comma-separated string.\n\n**Execution:**\n\n*   **Pair A:** Both individuals have relatively long antennae and a slender build, which are characteristic of male cuckoo bees. Thus, the pair is Male, Male (M, M). This is option **1**.\n*   **Pair B:** The wasp on the left has clearly curled antennae tips, identifying it as a male. The wasp on the right has straight antennae, identifying it as a female. Thus, the pair is Male, Female (M, F). This is option **3**.\n*   **Pair C:** The bee on the left exhibits the extremely long antennae characteristic of a male long-horned bee. The bee on the right has much shorter antennae, typical for a female of the species. Thus, the pair is Male, Female (M, F). This is option **3**.\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of indices: 1, 3, 3. I will now generate a Python script to print this result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Determine the sexes for Pair A.\n# Based on the long antennae on both individuals, which is a male characteristic in many bee species, we identify them as Male, Male.\n# This corresponds to option 1.\nindex_A = 1\n\n# Step 2: Determine the sexes for Pair B.\n# The wasp on the left has curled antennae, a definitive male trait in Polistes wasps.\n# The wasp on the right has straight antennae, a female trait.\n# This corresponds to option 3 (M, F).\nindex_B = 3\n\n# Step 3: Determine the sexes for Pair C.\n# The bee on the left has the characteristic very long antennae of a male long-horned bee.\n# The bee on the right has much shorter antennae, indicating it is a female.\n# This corresponds to option 3 (M, F).\nindex_C = 3\n\n# Step 4: Print the final answer as a comma-separated string of indices.\nprint(f\"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}\")\n```\n<<<1, 3, 3>>>"
