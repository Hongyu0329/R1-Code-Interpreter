    "My plan is to first identify the synchronized bursts in the provided graph. These bursts are visible as dense vertical columns of dots, indicating high neuronal activity across many electrodes at the same time. I will estimate the center timestamp for each of these bursts.\n\n1.  **Identify Burst Timestamps**: I will visually inspect the graph to find the time points corresponding to the center of each major burst of activity.\n    *   Burst 1: Centered at approximately 3.5 s.\n    *   Burst 2: Centered at approximately 16 s.\n    *   Burst 3: Centered at approximately 27 s.\n    *   Burst 4: Centered at approximately 37 s.\n    *   Burst 5: Centered at approximately 49 s.\n\n2.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**: I will calculate the time difference between each consecutive pair of burst timestamps.\n    *   IBI 1: 16 s - 3.5 s = 12.5 s\n    *   IBI 2: 27 s - 16 s = 11 s\n    *   IBI 3: 37 s - 27 s = 10 s\n    *   IBI 4: 49 s - 37 s = 12 s\n\n3.  **Calculate Average IBI**: I will compute the average of these calculated intervals.\n\n4.  **Round the Result**: The final average will be rounded to two significant figures as requested.\n\nI will now implement this plan in Python.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Identify the timestamps of the synchronized bursts from the graph.\n# These are estimated from the center of the dense vertical bands of activity.\nburst_timestamps = [3.5, 16, 27, 37, 49]\nprint(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs).\n# The IBI is the difference in time between consecutive bursts.\ninter_burst_intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\nprint(\"\\nCalculating inter-burst intervals:\")\nfor i in range(len(inter_burst_intervals)):\n    print(f\"Interval {i+1}: {burst_timestamps[i+1]} - {burst_timestamps[i]} = {inter_burst_intervals[i]} s\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the average inter-burst interval.\naverage_ibi = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\n\n# Build the equation string for the final output\nintervals_sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, inter_burst_intervals))\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the average inter-burst interval:\")\nprint(f\"Average = ({intervals_sum_str}) / {len(inter_burst_intervals)}\")\nprint(f\"Average = {sum(inter_burst_intervals)} / {len(inter_burst_intervals)} = {average_ibi:.4f} s\")\n\n# Step 4: Round the average to two significant figures.\n# We can use a format specifier for this.\nrounded_average_ibi = float(f\"{average_ibi:.2g}\")\nprint(f\"\\nRounding the average to two significant figures: {rounded_average_ibi} s\")\n\n# The final answer in the required format\n# <<<answer content>>>\n```\n<<<11>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts in this graph of firing activity of a neuronal culture and calculate the average inter-burst interval to two significant figures.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
