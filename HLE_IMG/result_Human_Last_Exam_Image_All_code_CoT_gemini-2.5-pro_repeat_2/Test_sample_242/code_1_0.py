    This function determines the substituents and stereochemistry for the given alkene metathesis cascade reaction.
    
    The reaction is a complex Ring-Opening Metathesis / Ring-Closing Metathesis (ROM/RCM) cascade.
    Based on analysis of the transformation and known outcomes for similar reactions, the correct assignment of the substituents is determined.

    The final product has the following substituents:
    R1: Hydrogen (H)
    R2: Hydrogen (H)
    R3: Methyl group (Me) with DOWN stereochemistry
    R4: Methyl group (Me) with DOWN stereochemistry

    This corresponds to answer choice C.
