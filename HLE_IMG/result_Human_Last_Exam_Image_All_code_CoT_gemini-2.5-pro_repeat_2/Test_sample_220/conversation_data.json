    "To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n1.  First, I'll determine the theoretical two-dimensional (2D) projection pattern of a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal lattice when it's viewed along the [110] crystallographic direction.\n2.  Next, I'll analyze each of the four images provided (A, B, C, and D) to identify the arrangement of atoms depicted in each one.\n3.  Finally, I will compare the patterns in the images with the known theoretical pattern for the FCC [110] view to find the correct match.\n\nThe Python code below will print out this step-by-step reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_crystallography_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided options to identify the FCC [110] projection.\n    It does so by explaining the theoretical pattern and comparing it to the visual evidence in each image.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Plan:\")\n    print(\"1.
