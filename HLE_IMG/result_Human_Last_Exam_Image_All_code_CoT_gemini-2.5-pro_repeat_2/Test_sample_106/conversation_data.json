    "This problem requires analyzing a complex organic reaction, specifically an acid-catalyzed backbone rearrangement of a triterpenoid. This type of reaction involves a series of coordinated [1,2] shifts of methyl groups (CH3) and hydride ions (H) to form a more stable final product.\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan to determine the final substituents:\n1.  **Identify the starting point:** The reaction begins with the protonation of the hydroxyl (-OH) group on the reactant by the acid catalyst (HCl). This forms a good leaving group (-OH2+).\n2.  **Initiate the rearrangement:** The leaving group departs, creating a carbocation (a positive charge on a carbon atom) at position C-3.\n3.  **Trace the carbocation migration:** This initial carbocation is unstable and will trigger a cascade of rearrangements (a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement). The positive charge will move across the carbon skeleton through a series of [1,2] shifts of adjacent methyl groups and hydrogen atoms. The driving force is to form a more stable carbocation at each step, typically moving towards more substituted carbons.\n4.  **Track the substituents:** I will follow the standard pathway for the friedelane-oleanane rearrangement to determine what group (H or CH3) ends up at each numbered position after the cascade is complete.\n    *   **Position 1 (C4):** Starts with two CH3 groups. One CH3 group shifts away. The other **CH3** group remains.\n    *   **Position 3 (C5):** Starts with an H atom, which shifts away. A CH3 group from C10 migrates to this position. The final substituent is **CH3**.\n    *   **Position 2 (C10):** Starts with a CH3 group, which shifts away. An H atom from C9 migrates to this position. The final substituent is **H**.\n    *   **Position 4 (C9):** Starts with an H atom, which shifts away. A CH3 group from C8 migrates to this position. The final substituent is **CH3**.\n    *   **Position 5 (C8):** Starts with a CH3 group, which shifts away. An H atom from C14 migrates to this position. The final substituent is **H**.\n5.  **Final Product Formation:** The rearrangement cascade stops when the positive charge reaches C-13. A proton is then eliminated from the adjacent C-12, forming the stable tetrasubstituted double bond seen in the final product.\n6.  **Code the result:** I will write a Python script to print the final answer in the specified format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rearrangement():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the substituents at the numbered positions\n    after the acid-catalyzed backbone rearrangement.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Based on the analysis of the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement mechanism:\n    substituents = {\n        1: \"CH3\", # At C4, one of the two methyls remains.\n        2: \"H\",     # At C10, the methyl group leaves and a hydrogen moves in.\n        3: \"CH3\", # At C5, the hydrogen leaves and a methyl group moves in.\n        4: \"CH3\", # At C9, the hydrogen leaves and a methyl group moves in.\n        5: \"H\"      # At C8, the methyl group leaves and a hydrogen moves in.\n    }\n\n    # Format the output as a single string: \"1 = V, 2 = W, 3 = X, 4 = Y, 5 = Z\"\n    result_parts = []\n    # Sort by key to ensure the order is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n    for position in sorted(substituents.keys()):\n        substituent = substituents[position]\n        result_parts.append(f\"{position} = {substituent}\")\n        \n    final_answer_string = \", \".join(result_parts)\n    print(final_answer_string)\n\nsolve_rearrangement()\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
