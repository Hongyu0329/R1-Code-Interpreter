    "My plan is to identify the four characters on the seal, which are in an ancient seal script style. I will proceed with the standard reading order for Chinese seals, which is from top to bottom, and from right to left.\n\n1.  **Top-Right Character**: This character is identified as `長` (cháng).\n2.  **Bottom-Right Character**: This character is `風` (fēng).\n3.  **Top-Left Character**: This character is `不` (bù).\n4.  **Bottom-Left Character**: This character is `驚` (jīng).\n\nPutting them together in the correct order, the phrase is `長風不驚`. I will now convert these traditional characters to their simplified Chinese equivalents and use a Python script to print the result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Set stdout to utf-8 to handle Chinese characters\nsys.stdout = io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stdout.buffer, encoding='utf-8')\n\ndef get_seal_characters():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and returns the characters on the seal.\n  The reading order is top-to-bottom, right-to-left.\n  \"\"\"\n  # Traditional characters identified from the seal\n  char1_trad = \"長\"\n  char2_trad = \"風\"\n  char3_trad = \"不\"\n  char4_trad = \"驚\"\n\n  # Simplified Chinese equivalents\n  char1_simp = \"长\"\n  char2_simp = \"风\"\n  char3_simp = \"不\"\n  char4_simp = \"惊\"\n\n  return [char1_simp, char2_simp, char3_simp, char4_simp]\n\ndef main():\n  \"\"\"\n  Main function to print the seal content.\n  \"\"\"\n  characters = get_seal_characters()\n  phrase = \"\".join(characters)\n  \n  print(\"The characters on the seal are read from top-to-bottom, right-to-left.\")\n  print(f\"The phrase in simplified Chinese is: {phrase}\")\n  print(\"The individual characters are:\")\n  print(f\"1. (Top-Right): {characters[0]}\")\n  print(f\"2. (Bottom-Right): {characters[1]}\")\n  print(f\"3. (Top-Left): {characters[2]}\")\n  print(f\"4. (Bottom-Left): {characters[3]}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n  main()\n```\n<<<长风不惊>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
