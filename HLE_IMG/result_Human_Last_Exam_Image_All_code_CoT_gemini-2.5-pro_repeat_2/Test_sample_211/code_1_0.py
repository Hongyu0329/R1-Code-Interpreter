  This function solves the visual identification puzzle.
  
  Analysis:
  1. The target image shows a Sociable Weaver with a distinctive scalloped feather pattern on its back.
  2. Comparing this pattern across all options, image B presents the most striking resemblance.
  3. A detailed look reveals that not only the feather pattern but also specific image artifacts (remnants from background removal) are identical between the Target image and image B.
  4. For example, a small, bright, irregular patch is visible on the bird's left wing (lower right of the image) in both the Target and image B.
  5. This confirms that image B is a crop from the same original photo as the Target image.
