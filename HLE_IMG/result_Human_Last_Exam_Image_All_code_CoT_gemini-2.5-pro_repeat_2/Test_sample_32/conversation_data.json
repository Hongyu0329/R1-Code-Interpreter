    "The user wants to know the main difference between the sporophytes of two moss species, *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*, which allows for easy visual identification.\n\n1.  **Analyze the names:** The specific epithet often gives a clue. *montana* means \"of the mountains\". *curviseta* means \"curved seta\". The seta is the stalk that holds the spore capsule. This strongly suggests the main difference lies in the curvature of this stalk.\n2.  **Consult botanical knowledge:** I will confirm this by cross-referencing botanical descriptions for these two species.\n    *   ***Grimmia montana*** is described as having a very short, straight seta, causing the capsule to be immersed or emergent (sitting within or just poking out of the leaves).\n    *   ***Grimmia curviseta*** is known for its distinctive long and strongly curved (arcuate) seta, which holds the capsule up and away from the main plant body.\n3.  **Synthesize the difference:** The most prominent and easily observable difference \"at a glance\" is the seta. One is short and straight, the other is long and curved. This directly affects the capsule's position.\n4.  **Create Python code:** I will write a simple Python script to print this explanation clearly.\n\n```python\ndef explain_grimmia_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n    \"\"\"\n    species1 = \"Grimmia montana\"\n    species2 = \"Grimmia curviseta\"\n    \n    # Sporophyte characteristics\n    seta_montana = \"very short and straight\"\n    capsule_position_montana = \"immersed or emergent (sitting within or just above the leaves)\"\n    \n    seta_curviseta = \"distinctly long and curved (arcuate)\"\n    capsule_position_curviseta = \"exserted (held up and away from the leaves)\"\n    \n    print(f\"The main difference between the sporophytes of {species1} and {species2} lies in the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    \n    print(f\"1. {species1}:\")\n    print(f\"   - Seta: The seta is {seta_montana}.\")\n    print(f\"   - Capsule Position: This results in the capsule being {capsule_position_montana}.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"2. {species2}:\")\n    print(f\"   - Seta: As its name 'curviseta' suggests, the seta is {seta_curviseta}.\")\n    print(f\"   - Capsule Position: This holds the capsule in a(n) {capsule_position_curviseta} position.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    print(\"\\nAt a glance, the most distinguishing feature is the seta: straight and short in G. montana versus long and curved in G. curviseta.\")\n\nexplain_grimmia_difference()\n\n# The final answer summarises the key point.\nfinal_answer = \"The main difference is the seta (stalk).
