def transcribe_greek_word():
  """
  This function provides the transcription of the Ancient Greek word from the image.
  The analysis of the Byzantine minuscule script reveals the following letters and diacritics:
  1. μ (mu)
  2. θ (theta)
  3. ἇ (alpha with a combined smooth breathing mark and circumflex accent)
  4. λ (lambda)
  5. ου (a ligature for the omicron-upsilon diphthong)
  6. ν (nu)
  Putting these together forms the transcribed word.

  letter2 = "θ"
  letter3 = "ἇ" # alpha with smooth breathing and circumflex
  letter4 = "λ"
  letter5 = "ου"

  # The complete word
  full_word = letter1 + letter2 + letter3 + letter4 + letter5 + letter6
  
  # The problem states "Make sure to include the accent in your transcription."
  # The accent (circumflex) and breathing mark are on the alpha.
