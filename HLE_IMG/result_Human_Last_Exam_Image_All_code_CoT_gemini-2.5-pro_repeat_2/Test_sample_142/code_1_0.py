    Based on this information, let's analyze the options:
    A. It is endemic to North America - This aligns with our findings.
    B. It is endemic to the tropics - Incorrect. Its range is primarily temperate.
    C. Its population size has been reduced... - This is not the primary reason for its absence in a different continent.
    D. It is not real - Incorrect. It is a real species.
    E. It is extinct - Incorrect. It is a common species in its native range.
    F. It is present in Germany... - Incorrect. It is not native to Germany.

    The most accurate reason for not observing this beetle in Germany is its geographical distribution.
