    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the stereochemical configuration, (R) or (S), for each of the four stereocenters shown in the reaction scheme, proceeding from left to right. We will use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze Stereocenter 1 (Acyl Chloride):** Identify the four groups attached to the chiral center and assign priorities based on atomic number. Then, determine the (R) or (S) configuration based on the 3D arrangement.\n2.  **Analyze Stereocenter 2 (Alcohol):** Repeat the process for the chiral center in the alcohol reactant.\n3.  **Analyze the Reaction:** The reaction is an esterification. This reaction type proceeds with retention of configuration at both stereocenters.\n4.  **Determine Product Stereocenters:** Based on the principle of retention, assign the configurations for the two stereocenters in the product. The left stereocenter in the product comes from the alcohol, and the right stereocenter comes from the acyl chloride.\n5.  **Compile the Final Sequence:** List the four configurations in order from left to right as they appear in the reaction scheme.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** Create a Python script that explains the steps and prints the final sequence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_stereochemistry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the stereochemical configuration (R or S) for the four\n    stereocenters in the provided reaction scheme, following the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n    The sequence is determined for the stereocenters from left to right in the scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step determination of stereocenters:\")\n\n    # --- Stereocenter 1: Acyl Chloride Reactant ---\n    print(\"\\n1.
