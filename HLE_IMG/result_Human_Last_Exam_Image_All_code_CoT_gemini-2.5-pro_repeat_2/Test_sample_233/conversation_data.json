    "My plan is to identify the specific Ingvar runestone from the provided image fragment.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** I will first carefully examine the runes and the overall style of the carving in the image. The inscription is arranged in horizontal bands separated by lines, which is a distinctive style.\n2.  **Transcribe the Runes:** I will transliterate the visible Younger Futhark runes into Latin letters to reconstruct parts of the text.\n    *   **Top Row:** The runes appear to read `...uk * þurkir * auk * er...` (`...ᚢᚴ * ᚦᚢᚱᚴᛁᚱ * ᛅᚢᚴ * ᛁᚱ...`). The `*` represents the 'x'-like word separator.\n    *   **Middle Row:** The runes read `...ina * iftiR *...` (`...ᛁᚾᛅ * ᛁᚠᛏᛁᚱ *...`). The sequence `iftiR` is a common form of `æftiR`, meaning \"in memory of\".\n    *   **Bottom Row:** The runes appear to be `...ustr * meþ * ik...` (`...ᚢᛋᛏᚱ * ᛘᛁᚦ * ᛁᚴ...`). `meþ` means \"with\".\n3.  **Search and Identify:** I will use the transcribed text fragments (\"þurkir\", \"iftiR\", \"meþ\") and the \"Ingvar runestone\" context to search through the catalog of known runestones. The combination of these specific text fragments and the unique grid-like style strongly points to one particular stone.\n4.  **Verification:** My research identifies the stone as **U 785**, also known as the Tillinge stone. The inscription on U 785 is:\n    *   `* urikr * auk * þurkir * auk * erinmuntṛ * litu * rita * stain * þina * iftiR * ulf * sun * sin * han * austr * meþ * ikuari * suti * kristr * hialbi * ot * þaira *`\n    *   The transcribed fragments from the image (`...uk * þurkir * auk * er...`, `...ina * iftiR *`, and `...ustr * meþ * ik...`) perfectly match sections of the U 785 inscription.\n5.  **Final Code:** I will write a Python script to present the identified ID, printing out its components as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_runestone_id():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the ID of the Ingvar runestone from the image.\n    The identification is based on transliterating the runes and matching them\n    with the known corpus of Ingvar runestones.\n\n    The visible text fragments correspond to the Tillinge Runestone,\n    which has the Rundata ID U 785.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The ID of the runestone consists of a letter and a number.\n    provincial_code = 'U'\n    stone_number = 785\n\n    print(\"The ID of the Ingvar runestone is composed of a provincial code and a number.\")\n    print(f\"Provincial Code: {provincial_code}\")\n    print(f\"Number: {stone_number // 100}{ (stone_number // 10) % 10}{stone_number % 10}\") # Prints each digit\n    print(f\"The full ID of the runestone is: {provincial_code} {stone_number}\")\n\nsolve_runestone_id()\n```\n<<<U 785>>>"
