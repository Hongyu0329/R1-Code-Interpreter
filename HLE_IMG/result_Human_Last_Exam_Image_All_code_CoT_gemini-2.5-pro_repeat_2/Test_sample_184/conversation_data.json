    "This is a two-step pericyclic reaction problem. Here is the step-by-step analysis to determine the final products.\n\n### Step 1: 4π Electrocyclic Ring Opening\n\nThe first reaction is a thermal electrocyclic ring opening of the substituted cyclobutene. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a thermal reaction involving 4π electrons proceeds via a **conrotatory** motion. This means the two termini of the breaking sigma bond rotate in the same direction (either both clockwise or both counter-clockwise).\n\nThe starting material is chiral, and the two possible conrotatory pathways are diastereotopic, leading to two different diastereomeric diene intermediates.\n\n1.  **Path A (e.g., clockwise rotation):** This path leads to the formation of the **(1E, 3Z)-diene**.\n    *   The methoxy group (MeO) on C1 rotates to an \"outward\" position, resulting in an *E* configuration for the C1=C2 double bond.\n    *   At C4, the methyl group (Me, wedge) rotates \"inward\", and the methoxy group (OMe, dash) rotates \"outward\". This results in a *Z* configuration with respect to the \"inward\" methyl group for the C3=C4 double bond.\n\n2.  **Path B (e.g., counter-clockwise rotation):** This path leads to the formation of the **(1Z, 3E)-diene**.\n    *   The methoxy group (MeO) on C1 rotates to an \"inward\" position, resulting in a *Z* configuration for the C1=C2 double bond.\n    *   At C4, the methyl group (Me, wedge) rotates \"outward\", and the methoxy group (OMe, dash) rotates \"inward\". This results in an *E* configuration with respect to the \"outward\" methyl group for the C3=C4 double bond.\n\n### Step 2: [4+2] Diels-Alder Cycloaddition\n\nBoth diene intermediates then undergo a Diels-Alder reaction with ethyl acrylate. The problem specifies that the reaction proceeds in an **endo** fashion. The endo rule states that the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (the -CO₂Et group) orients itself \"under\" the π-system of the diene in the transition state. This means the -CO₂Et group will be *cis* to the \"inward-pointing\" substituents of the diene in the final cyclohexene product.\n\n1.  **Reaction of (1E, 3Z)-diene (from Path A):**\n    *   \"Inward\" substituent: Me group at C4.\n    *   \"Outward\" substituents: MeO group at C1 and OMe group at C4.\n    *   **Endo addition:** The -CO₂Et group will be *cis* to the \"inward\" Me group.\n    *   **Resulting Stereochemistry:** Let's define \"up\" as wedge and \"down\" as dash. The \"inward\" face becomes \"up\".\n        *   Me at C4 is \"up\" (wedge).\n        *   -CO₂Et at C5 is \"up\" (wedge).\n        *   MeO at C1 is \"down\" (dash).\n        *   OMe at C4 is \"down\" (dash).\n    *   This stereochemical arrangement matches **Product E**.\n\n2.  **Reaction of (1Z, 3E)-diene (from Path B):**\n    *   \"Inward\" substituents: MeO group at C1 and OMe group at C4.\n    *   \"Outward\" substituent: Me group at C4.\n    *   **Endo addition:** The -CO₂Et group will be *cis* to the \"inward\" MeO and OMe groups.\n    *   **Resulting Stereochemistry:** Again, let's define the \"inward\" face as \"up\".\n        *   MeO at C1 is \"up\" (wedge).\n        *   OMe at C4 is \"up\" (wedge).\n        *   -CO₂Et at C5 is \"up\" (wedge).\n        *   Me at C4 is \"down\" (dash).\n    *   This stereochemical arrangement matches **Product H**.\n\nTherefore, the two products of the reaction are E and H.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the products of the sequential pericyclic reaction.\n    It follows the logic of stereochemical control in electrocyclic and cycloaddition reactions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: 4pi Electrocyclic Ring Opening ---\n    # According to Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a thermal 4-pi electron\n    # electrocyclic reaction proceeds via conrotatory ring opening.\n    # This leads to two possible diastereomeric dienes.\n\n    # Diene A results from one conrotatory mode.\n    # We define its stereochemistry by the position of its substituents.\n    # 'in' substituents point towards the center of the diene's C-shape.\n    # 'out' substituents point away.\n    diene_A = {\n        'C1_MeO': 'out',\n        'C4_Me': 'in',\n        'C4_OMe': 'out'\n    }\n\n    # Diene B results from the other conrotatory mode.\n    diene_B = {\n        'C1_MeO': 'in',\n        'C4_Me': 'out',\n        'C4_OMe': 'in'\n    }\n\n    # --- Step 2: [4+2] Diels-Alder Cycloaddition ---\n    # The problem states the cycloaddition is 'endo'.\n    # Endo rule: The dienophile's substituent (-CO2Et) aligns with the\n    # 'in' substituents of the diene.\n    # Let's define 'up' as wedge and 'down' as dash.
