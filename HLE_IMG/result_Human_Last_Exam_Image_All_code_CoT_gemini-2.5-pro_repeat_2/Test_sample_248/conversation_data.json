    "This image displays a typical North Atlantic rocky intertidal community. Several species are present, including barnacles and various snails. To determine that the photo was taken on the Atlantic rather than the Pacific coast of North America, we must identify a species exclusive to the Atlantic.\n\n1.  **Identify Visible Species**: The photo shows multiple species:\n    *   Numerous barnacles, likely *Semibalanus balanoides*.\n    *   Several small, dark snails, likely *Littorina saxatilis* (Rough Periwinkle).\n    *   Two larger snails. The upper one with the striped shell is a Common Periwinkle. The lower, lighter one is likely a Dog Whelk (*Nucella lapillus*).\n\n2.  **Analyze Geographic Distribution**:\n    *   *Semibalanus balanoides* (Northern Rock Barnacle) is primarily an Atlantic species, but telling it apart from Pacific species like *Balanus glandula* from a photo can be unreliable.\n    *   *Littorina saxatilis* (Rough Periwinkle) is found on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.\n    *   *Nucella lapillus* (Dog Whelk) is found on the North Atlantic coast but not the Pacific.\n    *   *Littorina littorea* (Common Periwinkle), the most easily identifiable snail in the image, is native to Europe and was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the 19th century. It has become very common there but is not found on the Pacific coast.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**: The presence of the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*, is a definitive indicator that this photograph was taken on a shore of the North Atlantic Ocean.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the scientific name of the species\n  that indicates the photo was taken on the Atlantic Coast.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The key indicator species is the Common Periwinkle.\n  # This species is abundant on the North Atlantic coasts of both Europe and North America\n  # but is not found on the Pacific Coast of North America.\n  scientific_name = \"Littorina littorea\"\n  print(scientific_name)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
