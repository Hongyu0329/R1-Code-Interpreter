  "question": "This image is the RT-PCR result of sample A-F. The genome of 7,857 bp was linearized in the URR. Triangles denote early (AE) and late (AL) polyadenylation sites. ORFs are represented by open boxes, with primers for RT-PCR indicated below. E1F2 and E1F3 primers spanned the splice junctions nucleotides 929^3465 and 929^3506, respectively. The primers are E1F1, E4R, E5R, L2R, L1R,E1F2, and E1F3. Primer pairs and PCR cycles are indicated above each panel.The lengths of the PCR products are (B) band 1, 190 bp; band 2, 159 bp; (C) band 1, 584 bp; band 2, 553 bp; (D) 551 bp; (E) 1,005 bp; (F) 972 bp; (G) band 1, 1,003 bp; band 2, 931 bp. The intensity of band 1 in (G) increased relative to band 2. (H) Band 1, 450 bp; band 2, 419 bp; (I) bands 1–4, 450, 419, 378, and 187 bp.\n\nBased on this information, find all splice species. How many splice species can you find in this image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "To find all the splice species shown in the image, we need to analyze the results from each RT-PCR experiment (panels B through I) and count the number of distinct products (bands) identified. Each unique band represents a detected splice species.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze each panel:** Examine the primer pair used and the number of bands described in the text for each panel (B-I).\n2.  **Count bands per panel:** For each experiment, count the number of distinct bands. Note that panels H and I use the same primers; panel I, with more amplification cycles, reveals more species, so we will use the count from panel I as the definitive number for this primer pair.\n3.  **Sum the counts:** Add the number of species found in each distinct experiment to get the total number of splice species identified.\n\nHere is the python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef count_splice_species():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the total number of splice species based on the provided\n    RT-PCR results.
