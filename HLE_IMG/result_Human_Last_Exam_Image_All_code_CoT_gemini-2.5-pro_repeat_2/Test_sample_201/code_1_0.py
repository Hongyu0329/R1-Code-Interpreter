    Analyzes the plate tectonic map to find the boundary most likely to form the longest range of the tallest mountains.

    Reasoning:
    1. Tallest mountain ranges are formed at convergent boundaries where two continental plates collide. These are indicated by red lines with arrows pointing towards each other, located between two landmasses (shaded areas).
    2. The "longest range" implies a long, continuous convergent boundary.
    3. We examine the options provided:
        - A. Kihei/South Avalonia: Convergent, but likely ocean-continent (forms coastal mountains, not the tallest type).
        - B, C, E: These plates do not share a direct boundary.
        - D. South Kesh/Eurybian: Convergent (continent-continent), but the boundary is relatively short.
        - F, G, H: These are not primarily convergent boundaries.
        - I. North Tethys/Brigantic: This is a long, continuous convergent boundary between two continental plates. This setting is analogous to the formation of the Himalayas on Earth.

    4. Conclusion: The boundary between the North Tethys Plate and the Brigantic Plate is the best candidate for the longest range of the tallest mountains.
