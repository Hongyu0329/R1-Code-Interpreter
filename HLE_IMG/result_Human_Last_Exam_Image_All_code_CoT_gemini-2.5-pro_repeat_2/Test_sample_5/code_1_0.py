# The user wants me to identify the piece of music from the sheet music provided.
#
# 1. Analysis of the Sheet Music:
#    - Key Signature: G minor (two flats).
#    - Time Signature: 4/4 (Common Time).
#    - Tempo: Quarter note = 80.
#    - Style: Highly virtuosic, large dynamic contrasts (p to f), rapid sixteenth-note passages, dense chords. This is characteristic of late Romantic piano music or modern music imitating that style.
#
# 2. Identification Process:
#    - The style is reminiscent of composers like Rachmaninoff or Liszt, but a direct search for their works in G minor with these specific themes does not yield a match.
#    - The melody and structure are very well-known within certain internet subcultures, particularly gaming and anime.
#    - The piece is instantly recognizable to those familiar with the Touhou Project game series.
#
# 3. Conclusion:
#    - The music is a piano arrangement of "U.N. Owen Was Her?".
#    - This is the theme for the character Flandre Scarlet.
#    - It is from the game "Touhou 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil".
#    - The original composer is ZUN.
#
# Since the request is to identify the music, I will print the name of the song and its origin.

music_title = "U.N. Owen Was Her?"
origin_game = "Touhou 6: Embodiment of Scarlet Devil"
original_composer = "ZUN (Jun'ya ÅŒta)"

print(f"The music is a piano arrangement of '{music_title}'.")
