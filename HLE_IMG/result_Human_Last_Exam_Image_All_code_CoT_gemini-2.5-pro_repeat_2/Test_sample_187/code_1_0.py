    # which acts as a dipolarophile. This is a [3+2] cycloaddition.

    # Step 2: The second reaction is the fragmentation of the unstable
    # bicyclic cycloadduct.
    # This intermediate eliminates a small molecule to form the stable,
    # aromatic pyrrole. This type of cycloreversion, which extrudes a
    # stable molecule like CO2, is classified as a retro-Diels-Alder reaction.

    # Step 3: Identify the byproduct.
    # By comparing the atoms of the reactants (Münchnone + DMAD) with the atoms
    # of the final pyrrole product, we can see that one carbon atom and two oxygen
    # atoms are lost. These are eliminated as a stable molecule.
