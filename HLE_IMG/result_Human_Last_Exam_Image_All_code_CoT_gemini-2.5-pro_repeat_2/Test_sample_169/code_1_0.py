# with voltage V_G = 1.0 p.u. The impedance from Bus-W to this source
# includes the line and the fault.

# The power flow equations relate the voltages and powers:
# V_G = V_W - I_W * Z_eq  (assuming current flows from W to G)
# This can be expanded into two real equations using V_W = V * e^(j*delta)
# To solve for Q_comp that achieves V = V_W_target, we eliminate delta
# using cos^2 + sin^2 = 1, leading to the equation below.
