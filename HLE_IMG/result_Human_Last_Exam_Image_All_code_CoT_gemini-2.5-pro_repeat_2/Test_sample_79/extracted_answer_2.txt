The structure shown in the image is the ruins of a building at a former railroad siding known as **Airing, Texas**. It was a stop for the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway (which later became part of the Southern Pacific). The square foundation likely belonged to a section house or a water tower base. While it is a historic site from the age of American railroad expansion, it is an unmarked ruin and not an officially designated historic landmark.
