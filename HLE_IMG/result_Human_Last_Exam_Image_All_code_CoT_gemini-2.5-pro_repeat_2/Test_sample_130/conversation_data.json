    "Based on the provided emission spectrum, the element can be identified by comparing the pattern of spectral lines to the known spectra of different elements.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  **Analyze the Spectrum:** I will examine the key features of the emission spectrum shown in the image. This includes noting the colors, positions, and intensity of the most prominent lines.\n    *   There are several lines in the blue and violet regions.\n    *   There is a very bright, distinct line in the green region.\n    *   There is a pair of bright lines very close together in the yellow-orange region.\n    *   There are several lines in the red region.\n2.  **Compare with Known Spectra:** I will compare these observed features to the characteristic emission spectra of common elements.\n    *   **Hydrogen** and **Helium** have much simpler spectra.\n    *   **Sodium** is famous for a strong yellow doublet, but it lacks the prominent green and blue lines seen here.\n    *   **Neon** is dominated by lines in the red part of the spectrum.\n    *   **Mercury (Hg)** has a spectrum that matches the image very well. It features a strong violet line (~404 nm), a strong blue line (~436 nm), a very prominent green line (~546 nm), and a bright yellow-orange doublet (~577/579 nm). This combination of features is a unique fingerprint for mercury.\n3.  **Provide a Python Script:** I will write a Python script that programmatically presents the evidence. The script will state that the element is Mercury and then print out the well-known wavelengths of its prominent spectral lines, confirming the match with the visual information in the image.\n\n```python\ndef identify_element_from_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the element by its characteristic spectral lines and prints the evidence.\n    The visual pattern in the image, especially the prominent green line and yellow doublet,\n    is a classic fingerprint of Mercury (Hg).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # A dictionary of prominent visible spectral lines for Mercury (Hg)\n    # Wavelengths are given in nanometers (nm).\n    mercury_spectral_lines = {\n        \"Violet\": 404.7,\n        \"Blue\": 435.8,\n        \"Green\": 546.1,\n        \"Yellow 1\": 577.0,\n        \"Yellow 2\": 579.1,\n        \"Red\": 690.7\n    }\n\n    print(\"The element with the given spectral lines is Mercury (Hg).\")\n    print(\"\\nThis identification is based on its unique and well-known emission spectrum.\")\n    print(\"Here are the wavelengths of its most prominent visible lines:\")\n\n    for line_name, wavelength in mercury_spectral_lines.items():\n        # The instruction was \"output each number in the final equation\".\n        # While there's no equation, we can format the output to highlight each number.\n        print(f\"-> Prominent {line_name} line: {wavelength} nm\")\n        \n    print(\"\\nThe bright green line at 546.1 nm and the yellow doublet at 577.0 nm and 579.1 nm are particularly strong identifiers.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    identify_element_from_spectrum()\n```\n<<<Mercury>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
