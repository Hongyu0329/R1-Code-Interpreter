    "To determine the time signature of a musical measure, we need to sum the durational values of all the notes and rests within that measure. The total duration tells us how many beats are in the measure (the top number of the time signature) and what kind of note gets one beat (the bottom number).\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan for our calculation:\n1.  **Analyze the notes and rests:** We will examine the notes in both the top (treble clef) and bottom (bass clef) staves.\n2.  **Count the beats in the treble clef:** The top staff consists of one sixteenth rest and fifteen sixteenth notes. In total, there are 16 sixteenth notes (or their equivalent duration). Since four sixteenth notes make up one quarter note, 16 sixteenth notes are equal to four quarter notes (16 / 4 = 4).\n3.  **Count the beats in the bass clef:** The bottom staff contains a single whole note. A whole note's duration is equivalent to four quarter notes.\n4.  **Conclude the time signature:** Both staves contain a total duration of four quarter notes. Therefore, the time signature is 4/4, which means there are four beats per measure, and the quarter note gets one beat.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation based on the top staff to demonstrate the process.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_time_signature():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the time signature of a musical measure by summing the duration of its notes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Let's define the duration of notes relative to a quarter note beat.\n    # A quarter note gets 1 beat.\n    sixteenth_note_duration = 0.25  # A sixteenth note is 1/4 of a quarter note.\n    sixteenth_rest_duration = 0.25\n\n    # Count the notes and rests in the top staff of the measure.\n    num_sixteenth_notes = 15\n    num_sixteenth_rests = 1\n\n    # Calculate the total duration in terms of quarter note beats.\n    total_beats_from_notes = num_sixteenth_notes * sixteenth_note_duration\n    total_beats_from_rests = num_sixteenth_rests * sixteenth_rest_duration\n    total_beats = total_beats_from_notes + total_beats_from_rests\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the top staff to determine the time signature.\")\n    print(f\"The measure contains {num_sixteenth_notes} sixteenth notes and {num_sixteenth_rests} sixteenth rest.\")\n    print(\"We will calculate the total number of quarter-note beats.\\n\")\n    print(\"Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Total Beats = (Number of sixteenth notes * Duration) + (Number of sixteenth rests * Duration)\")\n    print(f\"Total Beats = ({num_sixteenth_notes} * {sixteenth_note_duration}) + ({num_sixteenth_rests} * {sixteenth_rest_duration})\")\n    print(f\"Total Beats = {total_beats_from_notes} + {total_beats_from_rests}\")\n    print(f\"Total Beats = {total_beats}\\n\")\n    \n    # The top number of the time signature is the total number of beats.\n    # The bottom number represents the note value that gets one beat (4 for a quarter note).\n    top_number = int(total_beats)\n    bottom_number = 4\n\n    print(f\"The calculation shows there are {top_number} quarter-note beats per measure.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the time signature is {top_number}/{bottom_number}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis is confirmed by the single whole note in the bottom staff, which also equals 4 quarter notes.\")\n\ncalculate_time_signature()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
