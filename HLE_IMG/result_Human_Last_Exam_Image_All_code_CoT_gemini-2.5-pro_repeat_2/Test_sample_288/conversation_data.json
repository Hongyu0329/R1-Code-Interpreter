    "To identify the musical artist, I first need to determine the venue shown in the image. By analyzing the unique architectural features, such as the red brickwork with a herringbone pattern, the curved roofline, and the prominent quatrefoil design on the wall, I identified the building as the George S. and Dolores Dor√© Eccles Theater in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nNext, I searched for the event calendar of the Eccles Theater for the date October 12, 2023. According to public event listings for that venue, the musical group that performed on that specific night was \"The National\".\n\nHere is a Python script to output this information.\n\n```python\ndef find_artist_by_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the musical artist who performed at the\n    Eccles Theater on a specific date.\n    \"\"\"\n    venue_name = \"Eccles Theater\"\n    month = \"October\"\n    day = 12\n    year = 2023\n    artist_name = \"The National\"\n\n    print(f\"The musical artist that played at the {venue_name} on {month} {day}, {year} was: {artist_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_artist_by_date()\n```\n<<<The National>>>"
