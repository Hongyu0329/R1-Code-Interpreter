    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided case to arrive at the diagnosis.\n\n**1. Analysis of Clinical Information:**\n*   **Patient Profile:** 28-year-old female.\n*   **Tumor Location:** Mass in the sella turcica. This anatomical location is the site of the pituitary gland.\n*   **Significance:** Tumors in this location in a young adult are most commonly pituitary adenomas.\n\n**2. Analysis of Pathological Image (Crush Smear):**\n*   **Cellular Arrangement:** The image shows cohesive clusters of cells. The cells appear to blend together, creating a syncytial appearance (indistinct cell borders).\n*   **Nuclear Features:** The nuclei are relatively uniform in size and shape (monotonous), being round to oval. A key feature is the chromatin pattern, which is granular and stippled, often described as \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin. This is a classic feature of neuroendocrine tumors.\n*   **Cytoplasmic Features:** The cells have a moderate amount of eosinophilic (pink) cytoplasm.\n*   **Background:** The background is granular and somewhat \"messy,\" which is typical for a crush preparation of fragile neuroendocrine tissue like a pituitary adenoma.\n\n**3. Synthesis and Conclusion:**\nThe combination of a sellar mass in a young female with the cytological features of a monotonous population of cells exhibiting classic neuroendocrine nuclei (\"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin) is diagnostic of a pituitary adenoma. Other entities in the differential diagnosis (like craniopharyngioma or meningioma) would have distinctly different cytological features.\n\n```python\ndef provide_diagnosis():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the clinical and pathological findings to determine the diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Clinical Data\n    patient_age = 28\n    patient_gender = \"female\"\n    mass_location = \"sella turcica\"\n\n    # Pathological Findings from the crush smear\n    cellular_arrangement = \"Cohesive, syncytial clusters of monotonous cells\"\n    nuclear_features = \"Round to oval nuclei with stippled, 'salt-and-pepper' chromatin\"\n    cytoplasmic_features = \"Moderate amount of eosinophilic (pink) cytoplasm\"\n    \n    # Final Diagnosis based on synthesis of findings\n    diagnosis = \"Pituitary Adenoma\"\n\n    print(\"--- Case Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"Patient Information: A {patient_age}-year-old {patient_gender} presents with a mass in the {mass_location}.\")\n    print(\"\\nMicroscopic Findings:\")\n    print(f\"1.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    28 year female with mass in the sella turcica.
