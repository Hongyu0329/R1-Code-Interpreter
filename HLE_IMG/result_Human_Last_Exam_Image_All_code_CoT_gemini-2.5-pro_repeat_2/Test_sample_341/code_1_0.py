    # Step 1 & 2: Identify g(r), S(k) plots, and the unique system.
    # The analysis of plot shapes and S(0) values leads to the following identification.
    # The order for the lists is {SS, SR, R, HS, TW}.

    # g(r) indices:
    # SS (Plot 1): Repulsive shoulder creates a dip.
    # SR (Plot 3): Stickiness creates delta-function-like spikes.
    # R (Plot 5): Repulsive ramp creates an upward-sloping g(r).
    # HS (Plot 7): No features other than the contact peak and oscillations.
    # TW (Plot 9): Attractive well creates a downward-sloping enhanced g(r).
    g_r_indices = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

    # S(k) indices:
    # Based on S(0) ordering (SS < R < HS < TW < SR) and plot values.
    # S(0)_HS for 1D at eta=1/3 is (1-1/3)^2 ~ 0.444, which doesn't match any plot.
    # This identifies Hard Spheres (HS) as the unique system with no S(k) plot.
    # S(SS) -> Plot 2 (lowest S(0))
    # S(R) -> Plot 4 (low S(0))
    # S(TW) -> Plot 6 (high S(0))
    # S(SR) -> Plot 8 (highest S(0))
    s_k_indices = [2, 8, 4, 0, 6]

    # Step 3: Calculate R_max for the unique system (HS, Plot 7).
    # R_g(r) = g(r+1) / g(r) for r in {1/2, 3/2, 5/2, ...}.
    # The case r=1/2 gives division by zero and is ignored.
    # From analysis of Plot 7, the maximum of R_g(r) occurs at r=2.5.
    # R_max = g(3.5)/g(2.5). Reading from the plot gives a value of ~1.166...
    # This is consistent with the simple fraction 7/6.
