    "To solve this task, I will first identify each mineral specimen shown in the images (A, B, C, and D). Then, I will determine the class of silicate structure for each identified mineral. Silicate structures are classified based on how the silica tetrahedra (the fundamental SiOâ‚„ building block) are linked together. The complexity increases with the degree of polymerization or sharing of oxygen atoms between tetrahedra. The main classes, in order of increasing complexity, are:\n\n1.  **Nesosilicates (Isolated Tetrahedra):** No shared oxygen atoms.\n2.  **Sorosilicates (Double Tetrahedra):** One shared oxygen atom.\n3.  **Cyclosilicates (Rings):** Two shared oxygen atoms per tetrahedron.\n4.  **Inosilicates (Chains):**\n    *   **Single Chains:** Two shared oxygen atoms per tetrahedron.\n    *   **Double Chains:** Alternating two and three shared oxygen atoms.\n5.  **Phyllosilicates (Sheets):** Three shared oxygen atoms per tetrahedron.\n6.  **Tectosilicates (Frameworks):** All four oxygen atoms are shared.\n\nAfter identifying the mineral and its structure type for each specimen, I will order them from the least complex structure to the most complex structure.\n\n**Step-by-step Identification and Classification:**\n1.  **Specimen C:** This is a green, granular mineral aggregate. This appearance is characteristic of **Olivine**. Olivine is a **nesosilicate** (isolated tetrahedra), which is the simplest silicate structure.\n2.  **Specimen A:** This is a dark, blocky, prismatic crystal. This crystal habit is typical of **Pyroxene** (e.g., Augite). Pyroxenes are **inosilicates** with a single-chain structure. This is more complex than isolated tetrahedra.\n3.  **Specimen B:** This specimen is thin, flaky, and has a sheet-like appearance, which is due to perfect basal cleavage. This is characteristic of minerals in the Mica group, such as **Muscovite** or **Chlorite**. These are **phyllosilicates** (sheet silicates), which are more complex than single chains.\n4.  **Specimen D:** This is a translucent, glassy crystal showing conchoidal fracture. Its form is typical of **Quartz**. Quartz is a **tectosilicate** (framework silicate), where all oxygen atoms are shared, representing the most complex silicate structure.\n\n**Final Ordering (Increasing Complexity):**\n1.  **C (Olivine):** Nesosilicate (Isolated)\n2.  **A (Pyroxene):** Inosilicate (Single Chain)\n3.  **B (Mica):** Phyllosilicate (Sheet)\n4.  **D (Quartz):** Tectosilicate (Framework)\n\nThe final order is C, A, B, D. The following Python code will formalize this identification and present the final order.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mineral_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies mineral specimens and orders them by increasing silicate structure complexity.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = [\n        {'label': 'A', 'mineral': 'Pyroxene', 'structure': 'Inosilicate (Single Chain)', 'complexity': 2},\n        {'label': 'B', 'mineral': 'Mica', 'structure': 'Phyllosilicate (Sheet)', 'complexity': 3},\n        {'label': 'C', 'mineral': 'Olivine', 'structure': 'Nesosilicate (Isolated Tetrahedra)', 'complexity': 1},\n        {'label': 'D', 'mineral': 'Quartz', 'structure': 'Tectosilicate (Framework)', 'complexity': 4},\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Specimen Identification:\")\n    # Print identification for each specimen based on their labels A, B, C, D\n    for label_char in sorted([s['label'] for s in specimens]):\n        for specimen in specimens:\n            if specimen['label'] == label_char:\n                print(f\"- Specimen {specimen['label']}: {specimen['mineral']} ({specimen['structure']})\")\n                break\n    \n    # Sort specimens by complexity\n    sorted_specimens = sorted(specimens, key=lambda x: x['complexity'])\n    \n    # Get the ordered labels\n    ordered_labels = [s['label'] for s in sorted_specimens]\n    \n    print(\"\\nOrder of specimens by increasing silicate structure complexity:\")\n    # The final equation is the sequence of labels\n    final_equation = \" < \".join(ordered_labels)\n    print(final_equation)\n\nsolve_mineral_puzzle()\n\n```\n<<<C < A < B < D>>>"
