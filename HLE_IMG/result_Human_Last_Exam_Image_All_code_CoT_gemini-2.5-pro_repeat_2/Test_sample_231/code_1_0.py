    # --- Analysis of the Synthesis ---
    # Step 1: 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene reacts with PhLi and (EtO)2CO (3:1 ratio) to form
    #         the pyrylium salt A, 4-(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)-1,3,6,8-tetramethoxy-
    #         pyrano[3,2-b]xanthen-5-ylium.
    # Step 2: Pyrylium salt A reacts with diethylamine, undergoing ring-opening to form
    #         a blue-colored, conjugated enaminone B.
    # Step 3: Enaminone B is treated with LiI at high temperature. This causes two things:
    #         a) Demethylation of all seven -OCH3 groups to -OH groups.
    #         b) Elimination of volatile diethylamine and re-cyclization to the stable
    #            pyrylium salt core structure.

    # --- Conclusion for Compound C ---
    # Compound C has the same pyrylium salt core as A, but all methoxy groups
    # have been converted to hydroxyl groups.

    # The formula for the cation of A is [C26H27O9]+.
    # To get the formula for C, we replace 7 CH3 groups with 7 H atoms.
    # Carbons: 26 - 7 = 19
    # Hydrogens: 27 - (7 * 3) + 7 = 13
    # Oxygens: 9 (unchanged)
