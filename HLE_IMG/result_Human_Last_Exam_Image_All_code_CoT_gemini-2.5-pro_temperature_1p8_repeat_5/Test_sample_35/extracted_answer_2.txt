Based on the provided diagram and information, the S100B protein exhibits a strong affinity for the extracellular domains (V, C1, and C2) of the RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products). S100B can be used as a prognostic marker. This is because its concentration level is directly linked to the activation of downstream pathways (NFκβ, JNK/JUN) that cause the key pathological outcomes of neurological disorders—namely neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Therefore, higher levels of S100B would predict a more severe disease course and a poorer outcome for the patient.
