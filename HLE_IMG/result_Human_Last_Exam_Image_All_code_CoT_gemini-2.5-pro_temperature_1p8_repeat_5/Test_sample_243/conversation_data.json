    "Based on the unique reticulate (net-like) veining on the dark green leaves, and their whorled arrangement, the plant in the image is identified as *Normania triphylla*, sometimes known as the Saint Helena dogwood.\n\nThis plant is noted for being critically endangered and is believed to be extinct in the wild. I will find its native, endemic location. According to botanical resources, this plant was endemic to a specific island. My plan is to write a Python script that will store the name of this island in a variable and then print it.\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the island to which the plant Normania triphylla was endemic.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The plant Normania triphylla was endemic to the island of Saint Helena.\n    island_name = \"Saint Helena\"\n    \n    # Print the name of the island.\n    print(f\"The plant shown, Normania triphylla, was endemic to the island of: {island_name}\")\n\nsolve_task()\n```\n<<<Saint Helena>>>"
