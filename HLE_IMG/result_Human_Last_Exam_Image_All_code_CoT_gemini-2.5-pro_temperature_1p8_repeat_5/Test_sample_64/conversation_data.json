    "Based on the visual evidence in the series of images (L, M, N), the process being depicted is the formation of a new branch from a pre-existing filament. This is a common form of growth in organisms like fungi or algae.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the images:\n1.  **Image L:** This image shows a filament made of several cells. An arrowhead points to a septum (the cross-wall between two cells). The filament is relatively straight.\n2.  **Image M:** At a later time point, the cell wall just below the septum indicated in L has started to bulge outwards. The arrowhead in this image points to this initial swelling. This is the beginning of a new branch.\n3.  **Image N:** This image shows the bulge has grown significantly, forming a distinct side branch that is extending from the main filament. The filament also appears to be bending at the point of branching.\n\nThis sequence clearly illustrates the process of **lateral branching**.\n\n```python\ndef identify_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the biological process shown in the image sequence.\n  \"\"\"\n  process_name = \"The process depicted is lateral branching in a filamentous organism, likely a fungus or alga. The images show the sequential stages: (L) a cell in the filament, (M) the initiation of a branch as a bulge in the cell wall, and (N) the subsequent growth of the new branch.\"\n  print(process_name)\n\nidentify_process()\n```\n<<<The process being depicted is lateral branching.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
