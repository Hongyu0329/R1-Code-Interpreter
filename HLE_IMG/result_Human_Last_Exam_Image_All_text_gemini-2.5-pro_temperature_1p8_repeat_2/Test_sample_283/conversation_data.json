    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the request and the provided image.**\n    The user has provided a Google Trends graph showing the relative search interest for three terms (represented by red, blue, and yellow lines) over a period from December 2019 to late 2023. The key information is that these three terms represent \"historic events that all occurred in one country.\" The goal is to identify this country. The pattern of peaks on a trends graph for historical events strongly suggests these are annually commemorated events, like national holidays or days of remembrance.\n\n*   **Step 2: Examine the red line's trend.**\n    The red line exhibits a prominent, sharp peak every year.\n    *   The first peak is in late January 2020.\n    *   The second peak is in late January 2021.\n    *   The third peak is in late January 2022.\n    *   The fourth peak is in late January 2023.\n    This consistent annual peak in late January points towards a major national event held on that date. A very strong candidate is **Australia Day**, celebrated on January 26th. This is a significant and widely discussed public holiday in Australia.\n\n*   **Step 3: Examine the blue line's trend.**\n    The blue line shows smaller, but also very regular, annual peaks.\n    *   The peaks occur consistently every year around late April or early May.\n    *   Specifically, there are peaks around late April 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.\n    If the country is Australia, this timing perfectly matches **ANZAC Day**, a solemn day of national remembrance held on April 25th. This day commemorates all Australians and New Zealanders who have served and died in military operations.\n\n*   **Step 4: Examine the yellow line's trend.**\n    The yellow line also shows regular annual peaks, though one is an extreme outlier.\n    *   There are small, sharp peaks in early November of 2020, 2021, and what appears to be 2023 (at the far right of the chart). This timing aligns with **Remembrance Day** on November 11th, which is observed in Australia and other Commonwealth countries.\n    *   There is a massive, towering peak in September 2022. This spike is an anomaly in the yearly November pattern. We must find a reason for this. In September 2022, a major historical event occurred that deeply affected Commonwealth countries: the death of **Queen Elizabeth II** on September 8, 2022. As Australia is a constitutional monarchy with the British monarch as its head of state, her death was a paramount historical event, leading to a National Day of Mourning and an immense surge in related searches. This spike, while deviating from the Remembrance Day pattern, strongly reinforces the connection to a Commonwealth country, and specifically one that has Remembrance Day, ANZAC Day, and Australia Day as key national dates.\n\n*   **Step 5: Synthesize the findings and conclude.**\n    1.  **Red line:** Annual peaks in late January match Australia Day (Jan 26).\n    2.  **Blue line:** Annual peaks in late April match ANZAC Day (Apr 25).\n    3.  **Yellow line:** Annual peaks in early November match Remembrance Day (Nov 11), with the extraordinary spike in September 2022 being explained by the death of Queen Elizabeth II, Australia's Head of State at the time.\n\n    All three events are significant historical commemorations in Australia, and the Google Trends data aligns perfectly with their respective dates.\n\n<<<Australia>>>"
