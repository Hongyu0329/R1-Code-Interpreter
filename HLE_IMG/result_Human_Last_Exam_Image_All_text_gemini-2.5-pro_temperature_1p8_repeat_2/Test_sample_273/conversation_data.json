    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the chiral centers:**\n    First, we need to identify all the stereocenters (chiral carbons) in the molecule. A chiral carbon is an sp3 hybridized carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Let's number the main carbon chain according to IUPAC rules to refer to the centers unambiguously.\n    *   The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH), so the molecule is named as a derivative of an alcohol.\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the carbon with the -OH group needs to be found. The chain that goes through C(OH), C(Et), C(Me, CH2NH2) is 5 carbons long if we consider the methyl and aminoethyl groups' carbons, but the main continuous chain in the drawing is C(OH)-C(Et)-C(Me...). The longest chain is `CH3-CH2-(from ethyl)-CH-CH(OH)-CH3`, which is a 5-carbon chain... no, this is not correct. Let's identify the chain based on the drawing.\n    *   The connectivity is: A `CH(OH)(CH3)` group is connected to a `CH(CH2CH3)` group, which is connected to a `CH(CH3)(CH2NH2)` group.\n    *   Let's find the IUPAC name. The longest chain containing the principal group (-OH) is a pentan-2-ol chain. Numbering from left to right:\n        *   C1: The leftmost methyl group (not drawn). No, numbering gives OH the lowest number.\n        *   The chain is `CH3-C2(OH)-C3(CH2CH3)-C4(CH3)-C5H2NH2`.\n        *   Let's name this structure: **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**.\n    *   Now let's identify the chiral centers based on this name and numbering:\n        *   **C2**: Bonded to -OH, -CH3, -H, and the rest of the chain (-C3...). Four different groups. It is a chiral center.\n        *   **C3**: Bonded to -CH2CH3, -H, the left part of the chain (-C2...), and the right part of the chain (-C4...). Four different groups. It is a chiral center.\n        *   **C4**: Bonded to -CH3, -H, -CH2NH2, and the rest of the chain (-C3...). Four different groups. It is a chiral center.\n    *   There are three chiral centers in the molecule: C2, C3, and C4. We need to determine the absolute configuration (R or S) for each of them.\n\n2.  **Determine the configuration of C3:**\n    *   **Assign priorities (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules):** The groups attached to C3 are:\n        1.  `-CH(OH)CH3` (the C2 side). This carbon is attached to (O, C, H).\n        2.  `-CH(CH3)CH2NH2` (the C4 side). This carbon is attached to (C, C, H) where one C further connects to N.\n        3.  `-CH2CH3` (ethyl group). This carbon is attached to (C, H, H).\n        4.  `-H` (implied).\n        Comparing the first atoms attached, the C2 group's carbon is bonded to an Oxygen, which has a higher atomic number than Carbon. So, the C2 group has priority 1. Comparing the C4 group and the ethyl group, both are attached via Carbon. The C4 carbon is bonded to two other carbons, while the ethyl's CH2 is bonded to one other carbon. Thus, the C4 group has higher priority.\n        *   Priority 1: `-CH(OH)CH3`\n        *   Priority 2: `-CH(CH3)CH2NH2`\n        *   Priority 3: `-CH2CH3`\n        *   Priority 4: `-H`\n    *   **Determine R/S:** In the drawing, the ethyl group (Priority 3) is on a wedge (coming out of the page). The main chain bonds to C2 and C4 are in the plane. This means the implicit -H (Priority 4) must be on a dash (going into the page).\n    *   With the lowest priority group (4) pointing away, we trace the path from 1 -> 2 -> 3. The group of priority 1 is to the left, priority 2 is to the right, and priority 3 is pointing up and out. The path from left to right to up is **counter-clockwise**.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at **C3 is S**.\n\n3.  **Determine the configuration of C4:**\n    *   **Assign priorities:** The groups attached to C4 are:\n        1.  `-CH2NH2`. The carbon is attached to (N, H, H).\n        2.  The rest of the chain `-CH(CH2CH3)CH(OH)CH3`. The carbon (C3) is attached to (C, C, H).\n        3.  `-CH3`. The carbon is attached to (H, H, H).\n        4.  `-H` (implied).\n        Comparing the atoms attached to the carbons bonded to C4: Nitrogen (in group 1) has a higher atomic number than carbon (in group 2) and hydrogen (in group 3). So `-CH2NH2` is priority 1. The rest of the chain (group 2) outranks the methyl group (group 3).\n        *   Priority 1: `-CH2NH2`\n        *   Priority 2: `-CH(C3)-` (rest of the chain)\n        *   Priority 3: `-CH3`\n        *   Priority 4: `-H`\n    *   **Determine R/S:** The drawing shows `-CH2NH2` (Priority 1) on a wedge (out) and `-CH3` (Priority 3) on a dash (in). The implicit -H (Priority 4) is in the plane of the page.\n    *   When the lowest priority group is in the plane, we can use the \"swap\" method. Let's swap the position of -H (4) with the group on the dash, `-CH3` (3).\n    *   After the swap, H is on a dash (away). The sequence 1 -> 2 -> 3 is: `-CH2NH2` (wedge) -> chain (plane, left) -> `-CH3` (in the plane, where H was).\n    *   Viewing this new arrangement, the path from 1 (out) to 2 (left) to 3 (up) is **counter-clockwise**. So, the swapped configuration is S.\n    *   Since we performed one swap, the configuration of the original molecule is the opposite. So, it's **R**.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at **C4 is R**.\n\n4.  **Determine the configuration of C2:**\n    *   **Identify the problem:** The drawing at C2 is chemically incorrect according to standard wedge-and-dash notation. It shows both the `-OH` group and the `-CH3` group on dashed bonds, implying both are going into the page. A tetrahedral carbon cannot have this geometry.\n    *   **Formulate a hypothesis to correct the drawing:** This is likely a drawing error. A common pattern in such molecules is that the main substituents at each chiral center alternate their stereochemistry, or that the highest-priority substituent follows a consistent pattern. Let's examine the pattern at C3 and C4. At both centers, the highest-priority off-chain substituent (`-CH2CH3` at C3, `-CH2NH2` at C4) is shown on a wedge. Let's assume this pattern holds for C2 as well.\n    *   **Apply the hypothesis:** The substituents at C2 are `-OH` and `-CH3`. The priorities are:\n        *   Priority 1: `-OH`\n        *   Priority 2: `-C(3)-` (rest of the chain)\n        *   Priority 3: `-CH3`\n        *   Priority 4: `-H`\n        Following the pattern, the highest priority substituent, `-OH` (1), should be on a wedge, and consequently, the `-CH3` group (3) should be on a dash. The implicit `-H` (4) is in the plane.\n    *   **Determine R/S with the corrected structure:** We have `-OH` (1, wedge), chain (2, plane), `-CH3` (3, dash), and `-H` (4, plane).\n    *   Let's swap `-H` (4) with the group on the dash, `-CH3` (3).\n    *   After the swap, H is on a dash (away). The sequence 1 -> 2 -> 3 is: `-OH` (wedge) -> chain (plane, right) -> `-CH3` (in the plane, where H was).\n    *   Viewing this arrangement, the path from 1 (out) to 2 (right) to 3 (down) is **clockwise**. So, the swapped configuration is R.\n    *   Since we performed one swap, the original configuration is the opposite. So, it's **S**.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at **C2 is S**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCombining the results for all three chiral centers, the absolute configuration of the molecule is (2S, 3S, 4R).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(2S, 3S, 4R)}}$.\n<<<(2S, 3S, 4R)>>>"
