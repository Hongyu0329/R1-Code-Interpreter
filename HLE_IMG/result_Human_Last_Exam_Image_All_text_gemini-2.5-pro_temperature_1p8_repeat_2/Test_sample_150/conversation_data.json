    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **First Reaction: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Friedel-Crafts Acylation reaction. Benzene reacts with propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, AlCl₃.\n    *   **Mechanism:** The AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride to form a propanoyl cation (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O), which is a strong electrophile. The benzene ring acts as a nucleophile and attacks this electrophile.\n    *   **Intermediate-1:** The product is propiophenone (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one). The structure consists of a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group, which is in turn attached to an ethyl group.\n\n2.  **Second Reaction: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is an Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS), specifically bromination. Intermediate-1 (propiophenone) is treated with bromine (Br₂) and a Lewis acid catalyst (FeBr₃).\n    *   **Directing Effects:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Such groups are deactivating and meta-directing for subsequent electrophilic substitutions.\n    *   **Intermediate-2:** Therefore, the bromine atom will be substituted onto the benzene ring at the position meta to the acyl group. The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one (or m-bromopropiophenone).\n\n3.  **Third Reaction: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one) is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium catalyst (Pd).\n    *   **Transformation:** This reaction condition is capable of two key reductions:\n        *   **Reduction of the Ketone:** The benzylic ketone is completely reduced to a methylene group (-CH₂-). The C=O group becomes a CH₂ group.\n        *   **Hydrogenolysis of the Aryl Halide:** The carbon-bromine bond on the aromatic ring is cleaved and replaced by a carbon-hydrogen bond.\n    *   **Intermediate-3:** Applying both reductions to Intermediate-2 results in the formation of propylbenzene. The bromo group is removed, and the ketone is reduced to a CH₂ group. The overall structure is a benzene ring attached to a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃).\n\n4.  **Fourth Reaction: Intermediate-3 to the Final Product**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a free-radical bromination reaction. Intermediate-3 (propylbenzene) is treated with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of a radical initiator, benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂), in a non-polar solvent, CCl₄.\n    *   **Selectivity:** NBS is a specific reagent for brominating the benzylic position of an alkylbenzene. The benzylic position is the carbon atom directly attached to the aromatic ring. This is because the benzylic radical formed as an intermediate is highly stabilized by resonance with the benzene ring.\n    *   **Final Product:** In propylbenzene (Ph-CH₂CH₂CH₃), the benzylic carbon is the first CH₂ group. A hydrogen on this carbon is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Name of the Final Product:** The resulting molecule is (1-bromopropyl)benzene.\n\n**Summary of structures:**\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-Bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n*   **Intermediate-3:** Propylbenzene\n*   **Final Product:** (1-Bromopropyl)benzene\n\n<<< (1-Bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
