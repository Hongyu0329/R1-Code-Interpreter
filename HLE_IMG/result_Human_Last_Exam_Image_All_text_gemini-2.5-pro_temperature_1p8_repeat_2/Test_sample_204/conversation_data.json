    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the order of the specimens based on increasing silicate structure complexity.\n\n**Step 1: Identify each mineral specimen and its silicate class.**\n\n*   **Specimen C:** This mineral is olive-green and has a granular habit (an aggregate of small anhedral crystals). These are characteristic features of **Olivine**. Olivine is a **nesosilicate**, which consists of isolated silica tetrahedra linked by cations. This is the simplest silicate structure.\n*   **Specimen A:** This is a dark, black or dark green, prismatic (elongated) crystal. This habit is typical of inosilicates like pyroxenes and amphiboles. Given its elongated prismatic shape, it is likely an **amphibole** (e.g., hornblende). Amphiboles are **inosilicates** with a **double-chain** structure. Pyroxenes have single chains, while amphiboles have double chains, making amphiboles more structurally complex than pyroxenes. Inosilicates are more complex than nesosilicates.\n*   **Specimen B:** This specimen is very thin and breaks into flexible sheets (platy or lamellar habit). This perfect basal cleavage is the defining characteristic of minerals in the mica group, such as muscovite or biotite. Micas are **phyllosilicates** (or sheet silicates). In this structure, silica tetrahedra are linked to form two-dimensional sheets. This is a more complex polymerization than the one-dimensional chains of inosilicates.\n*   **Specimen D:** This is a translucent, glassy crystal with a generally hexagonal shape and conchoidal fracture (no obvious cleavage planes). This is characteristic of **Quartz**. Quartz is a **tectosilicate** (or framework silicate), where every oxygen atom in a silica tetrahedron is shared with another tetrahedron, forming a continuous three-dimensional framework. This represents the highest degree of polymerization and is the most complex silicate structure.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the hierarchy of silicate structure complexity.**\n\nThe complexity of silicate minerals is determined by the degree of polymerization of the silica tetrahedra (SiOâ‚„). The more oxygen atoms are shared between tetrahedra, the more complex the structure. The order from simplest to most complex is:\n\n1.  **Nesosilicates (Isolated tetrahedra):** 0 shared oxygens. Example: Olivine.\n2.  **Inosilicates (Chain silicates):**\n    *   Single chains: 2 shared oxygens per tetrahedron. Example: Pyroxenes.\n    *   Double chains: 2 or 3 shared oxygens per tetrahedron (average 2.5). Example: Amphiboles.\n3.  **Phyllosilicates (Sheet silicates):** 3 shared oxygens per tetrahedron. Example: Micas.\n4.  **Tectosilicates (Framework silicates):** 4 shared oxygens per tetrahedron. Example: Quartz.\n\n**Step 3: Order the identified specimens.**\n\nBased on the identifications and the complexity hierarchy:\n\n1.  **C (Olivine):** Nesosilicate - Least complex.\n2.  **A (Amphibole):** Inosilicate (double chain) - More complex than nesosilicates.\n3.  **B (Mica):** Phyllosilicate - More complex than inosilicates.\n4.  **D (Quartz):** Tectosilicate - Most complex.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of the specimens in increasing silicate structure complexity is C, A, B, D.\n\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
