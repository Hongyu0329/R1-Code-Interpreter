The compounds A and B are the two regioisomers formed from the addition of the tert-butoxy and benzoyloxy groups across the double bond of styrene. Their structures are:
**1-(benzoyloxy)-2-(tert-butoxy)-1-phenylethane** and **2-(benzoyloxy)-1-(tert-butoxy)-1-phenylethane**.

      O-tBu                 OOCPh
     /                     /
Ph--CH--CH2--OOCPh    and    Ph--CH--CH2--O-tBu

(Structure 1)              (Structure 2)
```
Where Ph is a phenyl group, OOCPh is a benzoyloxy group, and O-tBu is a tert-butoxy group. A and B correspond to these two structures.
