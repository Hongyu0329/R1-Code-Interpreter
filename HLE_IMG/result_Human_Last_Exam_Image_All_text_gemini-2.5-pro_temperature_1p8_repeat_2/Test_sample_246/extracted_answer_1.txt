Yes, there is strong evidence of insect activity. The prominent white, fuzzy sphere on the twig is a Wool Sower Gall, created by a gall wasp. This gall serves as a protective home for the wasp larvae developing inside. When these larvae mature into adult wasps and emerge from the gall, the female wasps will lay the next generation of eggs on the main veins of the oak tree's leaves.
