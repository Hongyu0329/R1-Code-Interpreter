    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the seal characters:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Nature of Chinese Seals**\n*   **Script:** The characters are carved in an ancient style known as Seal Script (篆書, zhuànshū).\n*   **Mirror Image:** Seals are carved in mirror image so that when they are stamped, the impression appears correctly. To read the seal, we must mentally flip the characters horizontally.\n*   **Reading Order:** The traditional reading order for multi-character Chinese seals is from right to left, and from top to bottom. For a four-character seal like this one, the order is:\n    1.  Top-right character\n    2.  Bottom-right character\n    3.  Top-left character\n    4.  Bottom-left character\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Character (reading the impression, not the seal itself)**\n\n*   **Character 1 (Top-Right):** This is the character `農` (nóng). In Seal Script, it depicts elements related to agriculture. It means \"farming\" or \"agriculture\".\n*   **Character 2 (Bottom-Right):** This is the traditional character `閒` (xián). It is a pictograph showing the `月` (moon) visible through a `門` (door), symbolizing leisure or free time.\n*   **Character 3 (Top-Left):** This is the character `不` (bù). The shape is a classic representation of this character in Seal Script. It means \"not\".\n*   **Character 4 (Bottom-Left):** This is the character `舍` (shè). In this context, as part of the phrase `不舍`, it means \"to stop\", \"to cease\", or \"to give up\".\n\n**Step 3: Combine and Interpret the Phrase**\nFollowing the correct reading order, the characters form the phrase `農閒不舍` (nóng xián bù shè).\n*   `農閒` (nóngxián) means the \"farming off-season\" or \"leisure time for a farmer\".\n*   `不舍` (bùshè) means \"to not stop\" or \"to persevere\". It is often used in idioms like `鍥而不舍` (qiè'érbùshě), meaning to persevere.\n*   **Overall Meaning:** The phrase \"農閒不舍\" expresses the sentiment of \"not stopping one's endeavors (such as studying, practicing art, or self-improvement) even during the idle times of the farming off-season\". It is a motto praising diligence and continuous effort.\n\n**Step 4: Convert to Simplified Chinese**\nThe question asks for the content in simplified Chinese characters.\n*   `農` simplifies to `农`.\n*   `閒` simplifies to `闲`.\n*   `不` remains `不`.\n*   `舍` remains `舍`.\n\nSo, the phrase in simplified Chinese is `农闲不舍`.\n\n<<<农闲不舍>>>"
