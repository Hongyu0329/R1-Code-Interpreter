    "*   **Step 1: Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Structure**\n    A Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal structure has atoms at each of the eight corners of a cube and at the center of each of the six faces. The basis atoms in a conventional unit cell can be described by fractional coordinates (0,0,0), (1/2, 1/2, 0), (1/2, 0, 1/2), and (0, 1/2, 1/2), with all other atoms in the lattice generated by integer translations from these basis points.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the Viewing Direction [110]**\n    The direction [110] represents a vector from the origin (0,0,0) to the point (1,1,0) in the cubic unit cell. This is a face diagonal on the base of the cube. Viewing the crystal \"along the [110] direction\" means we are looking at the projection of all the atoms onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to this [110] vector.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Expected Projection Pattern**\n    To find the pattern, we need to consider how the atoms are arranged in planes perpendicular to the [110] direction. These are the (110) planes.\n    1.  In an FCC lattice, the (110) planes are not all identical. They stack in a repeating two-layer sequence, often denoted as A-B-A-B...\n    2.  The atoms in an \"A\" plane, when projected, form a simple rectangular lattice.\n    3.  The atoms in a \"B\" plane also form a similar rectangular lattice. However, the B plane is shifted relative to the A plane.\n    4.  When we view the crystal along [110], we see both the A and B planes superimposed. The specific shift between the A and B planes causes the atoms from the B plane to appear exactly in the center of the rectangles formed by the atoms of the A plane.\n    5.  Therefore, the final projected pattern is a **centered rectangular lattice**. This pattern is characterized by a rectangle with atoms at its four corners and one single atom at its exact center.\n\n*   **Step 4: Analyze the Given Images**\n    Now, let's compare the theoretical pattern with the four options provided. We are looking for a pattern that shows a rectangle with atoms at the corners and one in the center.\n    *   **Image A:** Shows a rectangular arrangement with atoms at the four corners, but it has **two** atoms along the central vertical axis, not one at the center. This is incorrect.\n    *   **Image B:** Shows a rectangular arrangement with atoms at the four corners and **one** single atom precisely at the geometric center of the rectangle. This perfectly matches the expected pattern for an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n    *   **Image C:** Shows atoms at the corners, one at the center, but also **two extra** atoms on the horizontal centerline. This is incorrect.\n    *   **Image D:** Shows a much denser and more complex pattern which is not a simple centered rectangle. This is incorrect.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the Correct Answer**\n    Based on the analysis, Image B is the only option that correctly depicts the centered rectangular pattern that results from viewing an FCC crystal lattice along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
