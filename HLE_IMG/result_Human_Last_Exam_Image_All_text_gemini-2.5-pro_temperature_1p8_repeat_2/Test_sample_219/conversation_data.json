    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph**\nThe provided image is a raster plot.\n*   The **x-axis** represents Time, measured in seconds (s), from 0 to 50.\n*   The **y-axis** represents the Electrode Number, from 0 to 128. Each row corresponds to a different electrode recording from the neuronal culture.\n*   Each **black dot** represents a firing event (an action potential or \"spike\") from a neuron at a specific electrode at a specific time.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts**\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a period where a large number of electrodes show high firing activity at roughly the same time. Visually, these appear as dense vertical columns of black dots. We need to scan the graph from left to right to identify these events.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** The definition of a \"burst\" can be subjective. We should look for clear, distinct vertical bands of activity that stand out from the background firing rate.\n\nLet's identify the bursts by estimating the time at the center of each dense vertical column:\n1.  **Burst 1:** There is a very dense burst near the beginning of the recording. Its center is approximately at **t = 2.5 s**.\n2.  **Burst 2:** Another clear, dense burst occurs centered at approximately **t = 13 s**.\n3.  **Burst 3:** A less dense, but still distinct and synchronized burst, is visible centered at **t = 18 s**. It involves fewer neurons than the major bursts but is clearly a synchronized event.\n4.  **Burst 4:** A very dense and wide burst is centered around **t = 36 s**.\n5.  **Burst 5:** The final clear burst in the recording is centered near the end, at approximately **t = 48 s**.\n\nThere is some scattered activity around t=25s, but it is not as concentrated or vertically aligned as the other events, so it is not considered a distinct synchronized burst for this analysis.\n\nSo, the timestamps of the identified synchronized bursts are approximately: 2.5 s, 13 s, 18 s, 36 s, and 48 s.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between the centers of two consecutive bursts. With 5 bursts, we can calculate 4 intervals.\n\n*   **IBI 1:** Time between Burst 2 and Burst 1 = 13 s - 2.5 s = **10.5 s**\n*   **IBI 2:** Time between Burst 3 and Burst 2 = 18 s - 13 s = **5 s**\n*   **IBI 3:** Time between Burst 4 and Burst 3 = 36 s - 18 s = **18 s**\n*   **IBI 4:** Time between Burst 5 and Burst 4 = 48 s - 36 s = **12 s**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual IBIs and divide by the number of intervals.\n\n*   Sum of all IBIs = 10.5 s + 5 s + 18 s + 12 s = **45.5 s**\n*   Number of intervals = **4**\n*   Average IBI = 45.5 s / 4 = **11.375 s**\n\n**Step 5: Round to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question asks for the final answer to be given to two significant figures.\n\n*   The number is 11.375. The first two significant figures are 1 and 1. The next digit is 3, which is less than 5, so we round down (i.e., we don't change the last significant digit).\n*   Average IBI â‰ˆ **11 s**\n\n<<<11"
