    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the ECG Paper Calibration:** The information at the top left of the ECG strip, \"25 mm/sec; 1 cm/mV\", provides the standard calibration.\n    *   The paper speed is 25 mm/sec. This is crucial for calculating time intervals.\n    *   The amplitude calibration is 1 cm/mV (or 10 mm/mV), which is used for measuring voltage and is not needed for this question.\n\n2.  **Calculate Time per Grid Box:** The ECG paper is a grid of small and large squares.\n    *   The standard paper speed of 25 mm/sec means that 25 small (1 mm) squares pass the stylus every second.\n    *   Therefore, the duration of one small square is: 1 second / 25 mm = 0.04 seconds.\n    *   A large square consists of 5 small squares in width.\n    *   Therefore, the duration of one large square is: 5 mm * (1 second / 25 mm) = 0.2 seconds.\n\n3.  **Identify R-waves and R-R Intervals:** The R-wave is the prominent upward spike of the QRS complex, representing ventricular depolarization. The R-R interval is the time elapsed between two consecutive R-waves.\n\n4.  **Locate the Longest R-R Interval:** We need to visually scan the entire rhythm strip to find the widest gap between two consecutive R-waves.\n    *   The rhythm is mostly regular, but there is a distinct, prolonged pause visible on the fourth line of the ECG tracing (the line starting near the time stamp \"0:06:08\").\n    *   This pause occurs after the sixth QRS complex on that specific line.\n\n5.  **Measure the Longest Interval:** We will measure the distance between the peak of the R-wave just before the pause and the peak of the R-wave just after the pause using the grid lines.\n    *   Observing the pause on the fourth line, let's align the peak of the R-wave before the pause with a vertical grid line.\n    *   We then count the number of large squares to the peak of the next R-wave.\n    *   The interval spans exactly 7 large squares.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Duration in Seconds:** Now, we convert the measurement from large squares to seconds using the calculation from Step 2.\n    *   Number of large squares = 7\n    *   Duration per large square = 0.2 seconds\n    *   Longest R-R interval = 7 large squares * 0.2 seconds/large square = 1.4 seconds.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   Ensure you are using the correct paper speed (25 mm/sec).\n*   Correctly calculate the time equivalent of the grid squares (0.04s for a small square, 0.2s for a large square).\n*   Carefully scan the *entire* rhythm strip to be sure you have identified the longest interval, not just a locally long one.\n*   Measure from the same point on each R-wave (e.g., from peak to peak) for accuracy.\n*   Be precise when counting the grid squares.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\nThe longest R-R interval spans 7 large squares.\n7 large squares Ã— 0.2 seconds/large square = 1.4 seconds.\n\n<<<1.4>>>"
