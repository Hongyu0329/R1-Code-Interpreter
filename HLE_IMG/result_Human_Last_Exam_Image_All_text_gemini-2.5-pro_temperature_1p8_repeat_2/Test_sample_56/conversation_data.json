    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the artist of the painting.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual style and subject matter of the painting.**\nThe painting depicts a highly detailed and imaginative scene that blends a realistic interior with impossible, fantastical exterior worlds. This is a hallmark of Surrealism or Magical Realism. The technique is precise and smooth, creating a believable illusion of an unbelievable reality. Key elements include a room with a tree growing out of the floor, a fireplace burning books, a hallway flooded with the sea, and views into different landscapes (an icy expanse, a city at dusk, a daytime sea).\n\n**Step 2: Identify specific and unique elements for searching.**\nThe most striking and unusual elements that can be used to identify the work are:\n*   A room where the floor is being flooded by the sea coming from a hallway.\n*   A steamship visible in the sea-filled hallway.\n*   Books being used as fuel for a fire in a fireplace.\n*   A large, barren tree growing inside the room.\n*   A \"window\" or opening showing a massive wall of ice.\n*   A framed picture of the Leaning Tower of Pisa.\n*   A classical-style bust with leaves for hair.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate a search query and execute it.**\nUsing a descriptive search query like \"surrealist painting sea flooding into room\" or \"painting of a library with books on fire and water coming in\" is a good strategy. A reverse image search on the painting is also a very effective method.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the search results.**\nSearching for the visual elements described above consistently leads to the Polish artist **Jacek Yerka**. The painting is one of his most famous works, often titled \"Library\" (or sometimes \"Book of Fire\" or \"Room\").\n\n**Step 5: Corroborate the finding.**\nA further search for \"Jacek Yerka\" reveals an extensive portfolio of work with a highly consistent and recognizable style. He is known for creating fantasy worlds, often juxtaposing nature with architecture and everyday objects in meticulously detailed compositions, which perfectly matches the painting in question. His style, while surrealist, is distinct from artists like Salvador Dal√≠ or Remedios Varo, often focusing on these kinds of composite \"four-world\" scenes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the distinct surrealist style, the specific fantastical elements, and confirmation through image and keyword searches, the artist of the painting is Jacek Yerka.\n\n<<<Jacek Yerka>>>"
