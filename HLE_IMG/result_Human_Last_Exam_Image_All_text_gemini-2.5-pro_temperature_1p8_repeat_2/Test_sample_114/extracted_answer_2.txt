The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to the formation of a structurally rigid, bicyclic münchnone intermediate derived from N-acetylproline. The fused pyrrolidine ring locks the 1,3-dipole into a single conformation, preventing the interconversion of substituents at the C2 and C4 positions. This fixed, asymmetric dipole then undergoes a highly regioselective cycloaddition with methyl propiolate to give a single product.

The results from Reactions 1 and 2 establish a critical point of comparison. The ¹³C labeling study in Reaction 2 demonstrates that the analogous acyclic münchnone (from N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine) is not rigid; it undergoes a rapid equilibration process that scrambles the two methyl groups between the C2 and C4 positions. This scrambling shows that without the structural constraint of a fused ring, the positional identity of the dipole's termini is lost. Thus, the reason for the high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is the preclusion of this scrambling mechanism by the rigid, cyclic nature of its intermediate.
