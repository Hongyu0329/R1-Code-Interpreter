    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question.**\nThe question asks for the primary, visually obvious difference in the sporophyte generation between two specific moss species: *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. The key phrases are \"main difference,\" \"sporophyte,\" and \"at a glance,\" indicating we are looking for a significant and easily observable morphological feature.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the components of a moss sporophyte.**\nA typical moss sporophyte consists of three main parts:\n*   **Foot:** Embedded in the gametophyte tissue, absorbing nutrients. It's not usually visible externally.\n*   **Seta:** The stalk that elevates the capsule. Its length and shape can vary greatly between species.\n*   **Capsule (sporangium):** The structure at the top of the seta that contains the spores. Its shape, orientation, and features (like the peristome teeth) are important for identification.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the name *Grimmia curviseta*.**\nThe scientific name itself provides a major clue. \"Curviseta\" is derived from Latin:\n*   *curvus* meaning \"curved\" or \"bent.\"\n*   *seta* referring to the stalk of the sporophyte.\nThis name strongly suggests that a key characteristic of this species is having a curved seta.\n\n**Step 4: Research the specific characteristics of the sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta*.**\nBotanical descriptions confirm that *Grimmia curviseta* (sometimes placed in the genus *Codriophorus*) is characterized by a prominent, strongly curved, or swan-necked (cygneous) seta. This pronounced curve causes the capsule to hang down or nod, rather than standing upright.\n\n**Step 5: Research the specific characteristics of the sporophyte of *Grimmia montana*.**\nIn contrast, descriptions of *Grimmia montana* state that its sporophyte has a very short and **straight** seta. Because the seta is short and straight, the capsule is held erect and is often immersed or only slightly emergent from the surrounding perichaetial leaves.\n\n**Step 6: Synthesize the findings and determine the main difference.**\nBy comparing the two species, the most striking and easily distinguishable feature of the sporophyte is the seta:\n*   ***Grimmia montana*** has a short, **straight seta**, resulting in an erect capsule that is immersed or barely emergent from the leafy cushion.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta*** has a longer, strongly **curved seta**, resulting in a nodding or hanging capsule that is exserted from the leaves.\n\nThis difference in the curvature of the seta and the resulting orientation of the capsule is the primary characteristic used to tell these two species apart \"at a glance\" when they are fertile.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe main difference is the shape of the seta.\n\n<<<The main difference in the sporophyte that allows for distinguishing *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the shape of the seta (the stalk holding the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is very short and straight, holding the capsule erect and immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctive, strongly curved (cygneous or swan-necked) seta, which causes the capsule to be exserted and to nod or hang downwards."
