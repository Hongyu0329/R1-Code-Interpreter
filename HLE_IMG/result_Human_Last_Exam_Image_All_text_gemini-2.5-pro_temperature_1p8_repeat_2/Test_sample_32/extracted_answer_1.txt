The main difference in the sporophyte that allows for distinguishing *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the shape of the seta (the stalk holding the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is very short and straight, holding the capsule erect and immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctive, strongly curved (cygneous or swan-necked) seta, which causes the capsule to be exserted and to nod or hang downwards.
