    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material and its Molecular Formula**\n\nThe starting material is a bicyclic lactam with several substituents. Let's break down its structure to determine its molecular formula.\n*   The core structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one skeleton. This is a bridged bicyclic system containing a lactam (cyclic amide) and a carbon-carbon double bond.\n*   The nitrogen atom (N) is protected with a PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) group. The formula for a PMB group is C8H9O (-CH2-C6H4-OCH3).\n*   There is a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) attached to the double bond.\n*   Let's count the atoms:\n    *   **Carbons (C):** The bicyclic skeleton has 6 carbons (the 7th position, C2, is a nitrogen). There is 1 carbon in the CF3 group and 8 carbons in the PMB group. Total C = 6 + 1 + 8 = 15.\n    *   **Hydrogens (H):** The bicyclic core has 5 hydrogens (one each at C1, C4, C6, and two at the C7 bridge). The PMB group has 9 hydrogens. Total H = 5 + 9 = 14.\n    *   **Fluorines (F):** There are 3 fluorine atoms in the CF3 group.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** There is 1 nitrogen atom in the lactam ring.\n    *   **Oxygens (O):** There is 1 oxygen in the carbonyl group (C=O) of the lactam and 1 oxygen in the methoxy group of the PMB. Total O = 2.\n*   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Reaction to find Intermediate 1**\n\n*   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Reaction:** CAN is a strong oxidizing agent commonly used for the oxidative cleavage of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting groups from amines and alcohols. In this reaction, the PMB group is removed from the nitrogen atom and replaced by a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Change in Formula:**\n    *   Remove the PMB group: -C8H9O.\n    *   Add a hydrogen atom: +H.\n    *   Net change: -C8, -H8, -O.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 1:**\n    *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   H: 14 - 9 + 1 = 6\n    *   F: 3 (unchanged)\n    *   N: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n*   The molecular formula of Intermediate 1 is **C7H6F3NO**. This is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Reaction to find Intermediate 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 (Palladium on carbon with hydrogen gas) in MeOH.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. It selectively reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) to a carbon-carbon single bond (C-C). The lactam, C-F bonds, and other parts of the molecule are typically unaffected under these conditions.\n*   **Change in Formula:** The reduction of a double bond involves the addition of two hydrogen atoms (H2).\n    *   Net change: +H2.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 2:**\n    *   C: 7 (unchanged)\n    *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n    *   F: 3 (unchanged)\n    *   N: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   O: 1 (unchanged)\n*   The molecular formula of Intermediate 2 is **C7H8F3NO**. This is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Third Reaction to find the Final Product**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 °C.\n*   **Reaction:** These are conditions for the hydrolysis of an amide or, in this case, a lactam (cyclic amide). The amide bond (C(=O)-N) is cleaved by the addition of one molecule of water (H2O). This opens the bicyclic ring system to form an amino acid.\n*   **Change in Formula:** The hydrolysis reaction consumes one molecule of water.\n    *   Net change: +H2O (+2 H, +1 O).\n*   **Molecular Formula of the Final Product:**\n    *   C: 7 (unchanged)\n    *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   F: 3 (unchanged)\n    *   N: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n*   The molecular formula of the final product is **C7H10F3NO2**. The product is an aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid substituted with a trifluoromethyl group.\n\n**Summary of the Transformation:**\nStarting Material (C15H14F3NO2) → [remove C8H8O] → Intermediate 1 (C7H6F3NO) → [+ H2] → Intermediate 2 (C7H8F3NO) → [+ H2O] → Product (C7H10F3NO2).\n\nThe final molecular formula of the product is C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
