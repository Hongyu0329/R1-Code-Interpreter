    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Analyze Clue 1: The Image and Text.** The first part of the question states, \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n        *   The image shows two men in suits at an awards ceremony. The man on the right, with a beard, is receiving a trophy from the man on the left.\n        *   Based on his appearance and the date, the recipient can be identified as professional hockey player Nikita Kucherov.\n        *   The event is the 2019 NHL Awards, which took place on June 19, 2019 (a day off from the provided date, but clearly the correct event).\n        *   At this specific event, Nikita Kucherov won three of the most prestigious individual awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player), and the Art Ross Trophy (leading scorer).\n        *   Winning three major awards or achieving three significant accomplishments in an event is widely referred to as a \"hat trick\".\n        *   The term \"hat trick\" historically comes from the sport of cricket, where a bowler who took three consecutive wickets was presented with a new hat to commemorate the achievement. Therefore, the \"hat trick\" accomplished by Kucherov metaphorically represents a \"hat\".\n\n    2.  **Analyze Clue 2: The Mercury Connection.** The second part of the question states, \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n        *   This clue points to a historical use of mercury compounds that is now discontinued due to health concerns.\n        *   Mercury(II) nitrate was historically used in a process called \"carroting\" to treat animal fur for the production of high-quality felt. This felt was then used to make hats.\n        *   This process was notoriously dangerous, causing mercury poisoning among the workers, who were known as \"hatters.\" This poisoning led to neurological damage, giving rise to the idiom \"mad as a hatter.\"\n        *   Because of its toxicity, this use of mercury salts has long been abandoned. The \"X Y\" described here is a **Felt Hat**.\n\n    3.  **Synthesize the Clues.** We need to find the \"X Y\" that connects both clues.\n        *   Clue 1 points to a \"hat trick,\" which metaphorically represents a \"hat.\"\n        *   Clue 2 points directly to the manufacturing of a \"Felt Hat\" using mercury salts.\n        *   The common term that satisfies both conditions is \"Felt Hat\". The \"hat trick\" represents a metaphorical hat, and the historical object made with mercury salts was a physical felt hat.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   The identification relies on recognizing the person and the specific \"hat trick\" of awards he won at the event.\n    *   It requires knowing the origin of the term \"hat trick\" and its connection to an actual hat.\n    *   It requires historical knowledge about the hat-making industry and its use of mercury salts.\n    *   The word \"pictured\" in the first clue must be interpreted metaphorically, not literally, as there is no physical hat in the image.\n\nThe final answer is the two-word term that links these two separate concepts.\n\n<<<Felt Hat>>>"
