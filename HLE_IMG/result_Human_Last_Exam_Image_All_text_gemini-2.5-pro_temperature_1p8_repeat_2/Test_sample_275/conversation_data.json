    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of splice species from the provided RT-PCR results.\n\n**Overall Strategy**\nThe goal is to count the total number of unique mRNA splice species identified in the experiments. Each distinct band in an RT-PCR result represents a PCR product of a specific size. Different products imply different mRNA templates (i.e., different splice species), especially when considering the specific primers used. We will analyze the results panel by panel, grouping them by the type of transcripts they detect (early vs. late).\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Early Transcripts**\nEarly transcripts are those that use the early polyadenylation site (AE) and typically encode the early proteins (E-genes). These are probed by primers within the early region.\n\n*   **Panel B (E1F1/E4R):** This reaction uses a forward primer in the E1 region and a reverse primer in the E4 region. The gel shows **two distinct bands** (labeled 1 and 2), with sizes of 190 bp and 159 bp. The presence of two bands indicates that there are **two different splice species** in this region.\n*   **Panel C (E1F1/E5R):** This reaction uses the same forward primer (E1F1) but a reverse primer further downstream in the E5 region. It also shows **two bands** (584 bp and 553 bp). The size difference between these bands (31 bp) is the same as in panel B, confirming the existence of the same two alternative splice variants. This panel confirms the species found in B, but does not identify new ones.\n*   **Panel D (E1F2/E5R):** This reaction uses a special forward primer, E1F2, which is designed to span the specific splice junction 929^3465. It produces a **single band** (551 bp). This confirms that one of the two early species identified above is created by this specific splice. It does not add to the total count but helps characterize one of them.\n\n**Conclusion for Early Transcripts:** From these panels, we have identified **2** distinct early splice species.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Late Transcripts Containing the L2 ORF**\nLate transcripts are those that read through the early polyadenylation site (AE) and include the late ORFs (L2, L1). These are probed using reverse primers in the late region (L2R, L1R).\n\n*   **Panel F (E1F2/L2R):** This reaction uses the splice-specific primer E1F2 (for junction 929^3465) and a reverse primer in L2. It produces a **single band** of 972 bp. This identifies **one unique late splice species** that contains the 929^3465 splice junction and the L2 ORF.\n*   **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** This reaction uses a different splice-specific primer, E1F3 (for junction 929^3506), and the same L2 reverse primer. It shows **two distinct bands** (1,003 bp and 931 bp). This reveals **two additional unique late splice species**. Both share the initial 929^3506 splice but must differ in a subsequent splicing event upstream of the L2R primer.\n*   **Panel E (E1F1/L2R):** This reaction uses a general E1 forward primer. It shows a single band of 1,005 bp, which corresponds to the more abundant 1,003 bp species from Panel G. It does not reveal any new species not already identified in panels F and G.\n\n**Conclusion for L2-containing Late Transcripts:** Combining the results from panels F and G, we have identified 1 + 2 = **3** distinct late splice species that include the L2 ORF.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Late Transcripts Containing the L1 ORF**\nThese transcripts extend even further into the late region to include the L1 ORF.\n\n*   **Panel H (E1F1/L1R, 20 cycles):** This reaction uses a general E1 forward primer and a reverse primer in L1. It shows two prominent bands (450 bp and 419 bp), indicating at least two L1-containing species.\n*   **Panel I (E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles):** This is the same reaction as H but run for more cycles for higher sensitivity. This gel clearly shows **four distinct bands**: 450 bp, 419 bp, 378 bp, and 187 bp. Each band represents a unique PCR product and therefore a unique splice variant that joins the E1 region to the L1 region.\n\n**Conclusion for L1-containing Late Transcripts:** From Panel I, we have identified **4** distinct late splice species that include the L1 ORF.\n\n**Step 4: Final Tally**\nTo find the total number of splice species, we sum the unique species identified in each distinct class (Early, Late-L2, Late-L1). These classes are non-overlapping based on the PCR products.\n\n*   Early species: 2\n*   Late species containing L2: 3\n*   Late species containing L1: 4\n\nTotal number of splice species = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
