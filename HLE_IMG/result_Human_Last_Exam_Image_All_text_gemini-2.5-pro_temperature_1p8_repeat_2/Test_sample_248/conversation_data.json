    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core task is to identify a single free-living species in the photograph whose natural geographic range definitively places the location on the Atlantic Coast, as opposed to the Pacific Coast. The term \"definitively\" implies that the species should be exclusive to the Atlantic. The final answer must be the scientific name.\n\n2.  **Identify the Visible Organisms:** The photograph shows a typical rocky intertidal community. We can clearly identify several types of organisms:\n    *   **Barnacles:** The rock is heavily colonized by acorn barnacles. These are likely *Semibalanus balanoides*, the Northern Rock Barnacle, which is the dominant barnacle in the North Atlantic intertidal zone.\n    *   **Snails (Gastropods):** There are at least two, and possibly three, different species of snails.\n        *   **Striped Snail:** The most conspicuous snail, located slightly above the center, has a light tan or olive-colored shell with thin, brown, spiral stripes. This morphology is a classic and clear representation of the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*.\n        *   **White Snail:** Below the striped snail is a whitish, more conical snail. Its features are somewhat eroded, but its shape is consistent with the Atlantic Dog Whelk, *Nucella lapillus*.\n        *   **Small Dark Snails:** Several small, dark, ribbed snails are visible. These strongly resemble the Rough Periwinkle, *Littorina saxatilis*.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Species as a Geographic Indicator:**\n    *   ***Semibalanus balanoides* (Northern Rock Barnacle):** This species is native to and widespread in the North Atlantic. It is not found on the Pacific Coast of North America. Its presence would be a definitive indicator, but identifying barnacles to the species level from a photograph without very fine detail is difficult.\n    *   ***Nucella lapillus* (Atlantic Dog Whelk):** This predatory snail is exclusively found in the North Atlantic. It does not exist on the Pacific Coast. Therefore, its presence is a truly definitive indicator. The white snail in the photo is a plausible candidate, but its eroded state makes identification less than 100% certain.\n    *   ***Littorina saxatilis* (Rough Periwinkle):** This species is also exclusive to the North Atlantic. The small dark snails fit its description, but they could also potentially be juveniles of another species. Identification is plausible but not absolutely certain.\n    *   ***Littorina littorea* (Common Periwinkle):** This snail is native to Europe but was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the 19th century, where it is now exceptionally common and a key feature of the ecosystem. Critically, while it is overwhelmingly an Atlantic species, very small, isolated populations have been reported on the Pacific Coast (e.g., in San Francisco Bay). From a strictly biogeographical standpoint, this technically means it is not a *100% definitive* indicator, as there is a minute possibility of finding it on the Pacific coast.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Select the Best Answer:**\n    *   We have a trade-off. Species like *Nucella lapillus* and *Littorina saxatilis* have a \"perfect\" geographic range for this question (Atlantic only), but their identification in the photo is only plausible, not certain.\n    *   On the other hand, the striped snail is a textbook example of *Littorina littorea*, making its identification highly certain. Although it has a tiny foothold on the Pacific coast, its presence in a thriving, mixed-age community like this is, for all practical ecological purposes, a definitive sign of the North American Atlantic coast.\n    *   Given the clarity of the evidence, *Littorina littorea* is the most robust answer. It is the most unambiguously identifiable species in the photograph, and it is the signature snail of the modern North Atlantic intertidal zone. The question asks for *the* species, and this one provides the strongest visual evidence, despite the minor biogeographical technicality. The ecological context shown in the image makes a Pacific location extremely improbable.\n\nTherefore, the species that best fits the dual criteria of being identifiable in the photo and indicating an Atlantic location is the Common Periwinkle.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
