    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT).\n\n### **Goal:**\nTo calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT by comparing the \"Baseline\" scenario (Table 1) with the \"Proposed\" scenario (Table 2).\n\n### **Careful Points:**\n1.  **VMT vs. PMT:** The question asks for Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), not Person Miles Traveled (PMT). This means we must account for vehicle occupancy. The number of vehicle trips is the number of person trips divided by the average occupancy for that mode.\n2.  **Car Modes:** There are two car modes: \"car, 1 occupant\" (SOV - Single Occupancy Vehicle) and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\" (HOV - High Occupancy Vehicle/Carpool).\n3.  **Occupancy:**\n    *   For SOV (\"car, 1 occupant\"), the occupancy is always 1.\n    *   For HOV (\"car, with more than 2 occupants\"), the average occupancy is given separately for each table: 2.8 for Baseline and 3.0 for Proposed. This change must be factored in.\n4.  **Weighted Calculation:** We don't have the absolute total number of trips, so we must work with the provided shares. The total VMT will be a weighted sum across the four distance categories, with the weights being the \"share of total trips\" for each category.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nLet's calculate a representative total Car VMT for each scenario. We can define a \"Weighted VMT\" factor which is proportional to the actual total VMT.\n\n**Formula for Weighted VMT:**\n`Weighted VMT = Σ [ (Share of Total Trips)_i * (Avg Trip Distance)_i * ( (Share of SOV trips)_i / Occupancy_SOV + (Share of HOV trips)_i / Occupancy_HOV ) ]`\nwhere `i` corresponds to each of the four distance categories.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate Weighted Car VMT for the Baseline Scenario (Table 1)**\n\n*   **Average HOV (Carpool) Occupancy = 2.8**\n\n**1. Distance 0-3 miles:**\n*   Share of Total Trips = 48% (0.48)\n*   Average Trip Distance = 1 mile\n*   SOV Share = 25% (0.25), HOV Share = 28% (0.28)\n*   Contribution = `0.48 * 1 * (0.25/1 + 0.28/2.8) = 0.48 * (0.25 + 0.10) = 0.168`\n\n**2. Distance 3-5 miles:**\n*   Share of Total Trips = 22% (0.22)\n*   Average Trip Distance = 4 miles\n*   SOV Share = 38% (0.38), HOV Share = 43% (0.43)\n*   Contribution = `0.22 * 4 * (0.38/1 + 0.43/2.8) = 0.88 * (0.38 + 0.1536) = 0.4695`\n\n**3. Distance 5-10 miles:**\n*   Share of Total Trips = 14% (0.14)\n*   Average Trip Distance = 7.5 miles\n*   SOV Share = 40% (0.40), HOV Share = 45% (0.45)\n*   Contribution = `0.14 * 7.5 * (0.40/1 + 0.45/2.8) = 1.05 * (0.40 + 0.1607) = 0.5887`\n\n**4. Distance 10+ miles:**\n*   Share of Total Trips = 16% (0.16)\n*   Average Trip Distance = 20 miles\n*   SOV Share = 42% (0.42), HOV Share = 47% (0.47)\n*   Contribution = `0.16 * 20 * (0.42/1 + 0.47/2.8) = 3.2 * (0.42 + 0.1679) = 1.8813`\n\n**Total Baseline Weighted VMT:**\n`VMT_Baseline = 0.168 + 0.4695 + 0.5887 + 1.8813 = 3.1075`\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate Weighted Car VMT for the Proposed Scenario (Table 2)**\n\n*   **Average HOV (Carpool) Occupancy = 3.0**\n\n**1. Distance 0-3 miles:**\n*   Share of Total Trips = 48% (0.48), Average Trip Distance = 1 mile\n*   SOV Share = 1% (0.01), HOV Share = 2% (0.02)\n*   Contribution = `0.48 * 1 * (0.01/1 + 0.02/3) = 0.48 * (0.01 + 0.0067) = 0.0080`\n\n**2. Distance 3-5 miles:**\n*   Share of Total Trips = 22% (0.22), Average Trip Distance = 4 miles\n*   SOV Share = 8% (0.08), HOV Share = 19% (0.19)\n*   Contribution = `0.22 * 4 * (0.08/1 + 0.19/3) = 0.88 * (0.08 + 0.0633) = 0.1261`\n\n**3. Distance 5-10 miles:**\n*   Share of Total Trips = 14% (0.14), Average Trip Distance = 7.5 miles\n*   SOV Share = 14% (0.14), HOV Share = 27% (0.27)\n*   Contribution = `0.14 * 7.5 * (0.14/1 + 0.27/3) = 1.05 * (0.14 + 0.09) = 0.2415`\n\n**4. Distance 10+ miles:**\n*   Share of Total Trips = 16% (0.16), Average Trip Distance = 20 miles\n*   SOV Share = 16% (0.16), HOV Share = 33% (0.33)\n*   Contribution = `0.16 * 20 * (0.16/1 + 0.33/3) = 3.2 * (0.16 + 0.11) = 0.8640`\n\n**Total Proposed Weighted VMT:**\n`VMT_Proposed = 0.0080 + 0.1261 + 0.2415 + 0.8640 = 1.2396`\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\n**Formula for Percentage Reduction:**\n`% Reduction = ( (VMT_Baseline - VMT_Proposed) / VMT_Baseline ) * 100`\n\n*   `VMT Reduction = 3.1075 - 1.2396 = 1.8679`\n*   `% Reduction = (1.8679 / 3.1075) * 100`\n*   `% Reduction = 0.60109 * 100 ≈ 60.1%`\n\nThe total Car VMT can be reduced by approximately 60.1%.\n\n<<<60.1>>>"
