    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the title and composer of the jazz standard from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Key and Form:**\n    *   The key signature has one flat (Bb).\n    *   The first chord is an F minor chord (notated as F-). This establishes the home key of the piece as F minor.\n    *   The piece has repeat signs and first/second endings, suggesting a form like AABA, which is common for jazz standards. The section starting at the third staff appears to be the bridge ('B' section).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Harmony and Melody of the 'A' Section (First two staves):**\n    *   **Chords:** The first four bars present a very distinctive chord progression: `F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7`. The roots of these chords descend chromatically: F -> E -> Eb -> Db. This chromatic descent is a powerful identifier.\n    *   **Melody:** The melody in these bars emphasizes the root of each chord with long, sustained notes.\n        *   Over the `F-` chord, the main melodic note is F.\n        *   Over the `E-7b5` chord, the main melodic note is E.\n        *   Over the `Eb-6` chord, the main melodic note is Eb.\n        *   Over the `Dbmaj7` chord, the main melodic note is Db.\n    *   **Turnaround:** The A section ends with a `G7 | C7` progression, which functions as a V/V to V progression, strongly leading back to the tonic F minor.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Harmony of the 'B' Section (Bridge, third and fourth staves):**\n    *   The bridge starts with a `D-7b5 | G7 | C7` progression. This is a variation of a ii-V-I progression, temporarily tonicizing C.\n    *   It then moves through a series of dominant chords (`F7`) leading to another ii-V-I progression: `Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab`. This sequence resolves to Ab major.\n    *   The bridge concludes with a `G C7` turnaround to lead back to the final A section in F minor.\n\n4.  **Identification:**\n    *   The combination of the chromatically descending chord progression in the A section and the specific modulations in the bridge are the musical fingerprints of the jazz standard **\"Nica's Dream\"**.\n\n5.  **Composer Identification:**\n    *   \"Nica's Dream\" is one of the most famous compositions by the influential jazz pianist and composer **Horace Silver**. It was first recorded in 1956.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The notation `F-` means F minor. `E-7b5` is E half-diminished 7. `Dbmaj7` is Db major 7. These are standard jazz chord notations.\n*   The initial chromatic progression `F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7` is the single most recognizable feature of this piece and is often used as a reference for identifying it.\n*   The chord chart shown may have slight variations from other published versions (e.g., G7 instead of G-7b5 in the first turnaround, or C7 instead of Cmaj7 in the bridge), but these are common alterations in jazz performance and do not change the fundamental identity of the song.\n\n<<<Title: Nica's Dream, Composer: Horace Silver>>>"
