    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein of the organism shown.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the organism in the image.** The image displays a bright yellow, leafy organism growing on a rock. This organism is a type of lichen. Given its characteristic color, foliose (leaf-like) growth form, and the presence of small, cup-like reproductive structures (apothecia), it can be identified as *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the common orange lichen or maritime sunburst lichen. The location, Acadia National Park, is a coastal environment where this lichen is commonly found. A lichen is a composite organism, and the question refers to a protein from this organism, which typically implies the fungal partner (the mycobiont).\n\n2.  **Understand the question.** The question asks for a specific piece of biological data: the number of amino acids in the XPH1 protein from the organism *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n3.  **Formulate a search strategy.** To find this information, we need to consult a public biological database that stores protein sequence data. The most common and reliable source for this is the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) protein database.\n\n4.  **Execute the search.** We can search the NCBI database for \"XPH1 Xanthoria parietina\".\n\n5.  **Analyze the search results.** The search leads to a specific protein entry for XPH1 from *Xanthoria parietina*. The official accession number for this protein is AAB97635.1. An accession number is a unique identifier for a sequence record.\n\n6.  **Extract the required information.** The database entry for AAB97635.1 contains detailed information about the XPH1 protein. This includes its source organism, publications it's cited in, and its full amino acid sequence. Crucially for this question, the entry explicitly states the length of the protein. The entry for XPH1 [Xanthoria parietina] lists the length as 556 amino acids. The protein name, XPH1, suggests it is a type of photolyase, which is an enzyme that repairs DNA damage caused by UV light.\n\n**List of careful points:**\n\n*   **Organism Identification:** Correct identification is the crucial first step. The visual cues (color, form, structures) and the location provided are key to identifying the lichen as *Xanthoria parietina*.\n*   **Protein Specificity:** The question is about a specific protein, XPH1. It is important to search for this exact protein and not a different one from the same organism.\n*   **Data Source Reliability:** Using authoritative databases like NCBI or UniProt is essential for accuracy. General web search results may not be reliable for specific scientific data.\n*   **Precise Information:** The question asks for the number of amino acids (i.e., the length of the protein), not the molecular weight or the sequence itself. Careful reading of the database entry is needed to extract the correct value.\n*   **Composite Nature of Lichens:** While a lichen is a symbiosis, genetic information is typically attributed to one of the partners. In this case, the protein is from the fungal mycobiont of *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the length of the protein.\n\n<<<556>>>"
