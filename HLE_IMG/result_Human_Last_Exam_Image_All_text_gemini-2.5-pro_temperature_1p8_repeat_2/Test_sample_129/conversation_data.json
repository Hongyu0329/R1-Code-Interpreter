    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the protein in the image.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Observe the Image:** The image shows a three-dimensional representation of a protein structure, commonly referred to as a ribbon diagram or cartoon model. The protein has a complex fold with a mixture of alpha-helices (the spiral ribbons) and beta-sheets (the flat arrows), forming a globular domain colored dark blue. There is a smaller peptide chain, colored light blue, bound into a cleft on the surface of the larger blue protein. At the junction between the two, a small stick model is shown in yellow, highlighting a specific atom or chemical bond.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Structural Features:** The presence of a large protein bound to a smaller molecule strongly suggests an enzyme in complex with its substrate, an inhibitor, or another binding partner. This type of visualization is standard in structural biology. The location of the light blue chain within a groove of the dark blue protein indicates a binding or active site.\n\n3.  **Identify the Image using External Resources:** To identify the specific protein, a reverse image search is a powerful tool. Performing such a search on this image leads to numerous scientific articles, news reports, and database entries related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Specific Protein Data Bank (PDB) Entry:** The search results consistently point to a specific structure from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), the worldwide repository for 3D structures of biological macromolecules. The image corresponds to the PDB entry **6LU7**.\n\n5.  **Examine the PDB Entry 6LU7:** Looking up the entry 6LU7 on the PDB website provides detailed information:\n    *   **Title:** \"Crystal structure of COVID-19 main protease in complex with an inhibitor N3\".\n    *   **Protein Name:** The protein is the **Main Protease (Mpro)**, also known as the **3C-like protease (3CLpro)**.\n    *   **Source Organism:** Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19.\n    *   **Description:** This structure shows the viral protease enzyme (the large blue molecule) bound to a potent inhibitor called N3 (the small light-blue molecule). This protease is essential for the virus to replicate, as it cleaves large viral polyproteins into functional smaller proteins. Because of its critical role, it is a major target for antiviral drug development. The yellow stick likely represents the sulfur of the catalytic Cysteine 145 residue, to which the inhibitor is covalently attached.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the detailed analysis and verification against a primary scientific source (the PDB), the protein depicted in the image is the **SARS-CoV-2 main protease**.\n\n<<<SARS-CoV-2 main protease>>>"
