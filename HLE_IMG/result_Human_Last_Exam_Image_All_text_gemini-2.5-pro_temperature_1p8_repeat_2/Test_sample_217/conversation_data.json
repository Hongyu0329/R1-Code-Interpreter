    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the cuneiform sign.**\n    The image displays a cuneiform sign from an early period, as indicated by its pictographic nature. The sign is composed of several elements: a tall, rectangular base filled with nested lines, and a triangular, roof-like structure on top. There are small protrusions on the sides and at the peak of the roof. The overall form strongly resembles a building, such as a hut or a house with a roof.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the sign in the cuneiform script system.**\n    This specific sign is a well-known Sumerian logogram. It is the sign **E₂** (also transcribed as É). The pronunciation of the Sumerian word it represents is /e/.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the meaning of the sign E₂.**\n    The Sumerian word *é* means \"house\" or \"temple.\" As a pictograph, the sign visually represents a building, confirming its meaning. This sign was fundamental in Sumerian writing, appearing alone to mean \"house\" or \"temple,\" or as part of compound words for other types of buildings (e.g., É.GAL, \"great house,\" meaning \"palace\").\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the given answer choices based on the identified meaning.**\n    *   A. Tool: The sign does not depict a tool. Signs for tools, like the plow (APIN), are pictographs of the specific tool.\n    *   B. Guard: This is an abstract concept. While there are ways to write \"guard\" in cuneiform, it does not involve this pictograph.\n    *   C. Bread: The sign for bread (NINDA) is a pictograph of a bread loaf, which looks very different.\n    *   D. Home: This is an excellent match. \"Home\" is a synonym for \"house,\" which is the primary meaning of the sign E₂.\n    *   E. Deity: The sign for \"deity\" or \"god\" (DINGIR) is a star-like symbol, completely different from the one shown.\n    *   F. Beard: The sign does not resemble a beard. A sign for a part of the body would be part of a larger pictograph of a head or have a distinct shape representing the beard itself.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the analysis.**\n    The provided image shows the third-millennium BCE form of the Sumerian cuneiform sign E₂, which pictographically represents a building. Its meaning is \"house,\" \"temple,\" or \"home.\" Therefore, \"Home\" is the correct answer among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>"
