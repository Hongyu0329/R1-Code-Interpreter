**Product A:** Methyl (Z)-2-acetyl-3-((S)-1-(4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidin-2-yl)acrylate.
 

**Product B:** Methyl (5aS,10aR)-5-oxo-1,2,3,5,5a,6,7,8-octahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]diazepine-10a(10H)-carboxylate. (This is a tricyclic lactam structure whose formula matches B, C12H14N2O3, and fits the spectral data better than the N-oxide hypothesis, especially the 83.2 ppm signal which would be the C5a spiro-aminal carbon).
 

**Product C:** Acetic (S)-2,3,5,6,7,8-hexahydro-1H-pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrimidine-6-carboxylic anhydride.
