    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the artwork.**\nThe image shows a bas-relief sculpture set within a circular frame (a tondo). The subject matter is clearly religious. We see a priest, identifiable by his vestments, administering a host to a kneeling child, while other figures kneel in prayer. This scene depicts a Christian sacrament, specifically the Eucharist or First Communion. The overall composition is harmonious and the figures are rendered with a calm, classical grace.\n\n**Step 2: Examine the inscription.**\nAt the bottom of the circular scene, on a scroll-like cartouche, there is an inscription. Using the close-up images, the text can be clearly read as \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AUTEL\". This is in French and translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" confirming the subject is the Eucharist.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the artistic style and period.**\nThe style of the sculpture is characteristic of the Early Italian Renaissance (Quattrocento). The serene expressions, balanced composition, and classicizing treatment of drapery are hallmarks of Florentine sculpture from the mid-15th century. This style is most famously associated with the sculptor Luca della Robbia and his workshop.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the clues for a targeted search.**\nBy combining the key features—the subject (Sacrament of the Altar/Eucharist), the format (tondo relief), the unique French inscription (\"SACRAMENTI DE L'AUTEL\"), and the distinct artistic style (Luca della Robbia)—we can search for this specific artwork.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the artwork and its creator.**\nA search reveals that this tondo is a well-known marble relief titled *The Sacrament of the Eucharist* (*Le sacrement de l'Eucharistie*). It is currently housed in the Musée du Louvre in Paris. Art historians and the museum attribute this masterpiece to the Florentine sculptor **Luca della Robbia**, dating it to approximately 1445-1450. It is believed to be a surviving detail from a larger, now-dismantled tabernacle or altarpiece.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the distinctive style, the subject matter, and the specific inscription which helps locate the exact piece in the Louvre's collection, the author of this relief is unequivocally identified as the Italian Renaissance sculptor Luca della Robbia.\n\n<<<Luca della Robbia>>>"
