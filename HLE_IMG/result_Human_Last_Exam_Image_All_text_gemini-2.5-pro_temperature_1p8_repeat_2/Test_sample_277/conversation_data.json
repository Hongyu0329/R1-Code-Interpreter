    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The task is to identify the isomeric relationship between the molecules shown in the image and select the correct option from the given list.\n\n2.  **Examine the Provided Image:** The image provided is a completely black rectangle. There are no drawings, diagrams, or chemical structures of any molecules.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Question:** The question asks, \"Which type of isomers are the molecules mentioned above?\". The phrase \"molecules mentioned above\" directs us to the contents of the image.\n\n4.  **Identify the Core Problem:** Since the image is blank, there are no molecules presented for analysis. Without the molecular structures, it is impossible to perform any comparison.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options based on the available information:** To determine the relationship between molecules, we need to know their structures. Let's review the definitions of the options:\n    *   **(a) conformers isomers:** Molecules that can be interconverted by rotation around single bonds. We would need to see the structures (e.g., Newman projections) to determine this.\n    *   **(b) constitutional isomers:** Molecules with the same molecular formula but different atom connectivity. We would need to see the structures to determine their formulas and how the atoms are connected.\n    *   **(c) Identical:** The molecules are superimposable, meaning they are the same compound. We need to see the structures to compare them.\n    *   **(d) stereoisomers:** Molecules with the same formula and connectivity but different arrangements of atoms in space. We need to see the 3D structures to assess this.\n    *   **(e) None of these:** This option would be correct if the relationship is something other than (a), (b), (c), or (d), or if the question cannot be answered.\n\n6.  **Formulate a Conclusion:** Because there are no molecules shown, we cannot determine their molecular formulas, connectivity, or spatial arrangements. Consequently, it is impossible to classify their relationship as conformers, constitutional isomers, identical, or stereoisomers. The fundamental information required to answer the question is missing. Therefore, none of the specific relationships listed in options (a), (b), (c), or (d) can be confirmed. The most logical choice is (e), as the condition for applying any of the other labels (the presence of molecules to compare) is not met.\n\n<<<E>>>"
