    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question**\nThe question asks for the \"rotational symmetry\" of the tiling. This means we need to find the number of times the pattern appears identical during a full 360° rotation around a specific point. This number is called the \"order\" of rotational symmetry. An n-fold rotational symmetry means the pattern looks the same after a rotation of 360/n degrees.\n\n**Step 2: Visually inspect the tiling pattern**\nThe tiling is a complex geometric pattern made up of repeating shapes and colors. To find the rotational symmetry, we must identify a point in the pattern that can act as a center of rotation. We should look for prominent, repeating motifs.\n\n**Step 3: Identify potential centers of rotation and their symmetry**\nLet's examine the different shapes and how they are arranged to find potential centers.\n\n*   **Center of the large dark blue polygons:** Let's focus on one of the prominent dark blue shapes. Counting its sides reveals it is a heptagon (a 7-sided polygon). This heptagon is surrounded by seven identical light-tan, \"house-shaped\" pentagons. This entire arrangement suggests a possible center of rotation at the center of the blue heptagon. If we rotate the entire tiling around this point, we can see if the pattern maps onto itself.\n*   **Testing for 7-fold symmetry:** A 7-fold rotation corresponds to a rotation of 360°/7 ≈ 51.4°. If we rotate the image by this angle around the center of a blue heptagon, the heptagon itself would align with its original position (as would any regular heptagon). More importantly, the surrounding tiles also align perfectly. Each of the seven surrounding pentagons moves into the position of its neighbor. The pattern of squares and rhombi further out also falls into an identical position. This holds true for the entire pattern. Therefore, the center of each blue heptagon is a point of **7-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n*   **Center of the light tan squares:** Now, let's consider the center of one of the light tan squares. Each square is surrounded by four orange rhombi. This arrangement strongly suggests 4-fold symmetry.\n*   **Testing for 4-fold symmetry:** A 4-fold rotation corresponds to a rotation of 360°/4 = 90°. If we rotate the pattern by 90° around the center of a square, the square maps onto itself, and each of the four surrounding rhombi moves into the position of its neighbor. The rest of the pattern also aligns. Therefore, the center of each square is a point of **4-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n*   **Other centers of rotation:** There are also other centers of rotation. For example, at the points where the \"tips\" of three of the light tan pentagons meet, the pattern has **3-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the overall rotational symmetry of the tiling**\nThe tiling possesses multiple types of rotational symmetry at different locations (3-fold, 4-fold, and 7-fold). When asked to name \"the\" rotational symmetry of a pattern, the convention is to state the highest order of rotational symmetry present, as this is the most defining characteristic of its structure.\n\nIn this case, the highest order of rotation we have found is 7-fold. The presence of 7-fold symmetry (a non-crystallographic symmetry) indicates that this is an aperiodic tiling, also known as a quasicrystal pattern.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis, the tiling has centers of 3-fold, 4-fold, and 7-fold rotational symmetry. The highest order of rotational symmetry is 7-fold.\n\n<<<7-fold>>>"
