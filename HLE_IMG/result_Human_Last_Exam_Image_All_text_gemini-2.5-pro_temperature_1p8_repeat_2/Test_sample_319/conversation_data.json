    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image and the question to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image Content:** The image consists of two graphs.\n    *   **Top Graph (Spectrogram):** This graph shows frequency components of a sound over time. We can see a strong, continuous horizontal line representing a pure tone at a specific frequency. In the middle, this line is interrupted by a vertical blur that covers a wide range of frequencies. This vertical blur represents a burst of noise. The pure tone's line appears to be completely replaced by the noise for a short duration and then continues afterward.\n    *   **Bottom Graph (Waveform):** This graph shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time. It starts as a perfect, repeating sine wave, which corresponds to the pure tone. In the middle, the smooth sine wave is replaced by a jagged, chaotic-looking waveform, which corresponds to the burst of noise. After the noise, the pure sine wave resumes.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Question's Clues:**\n    *   **\"Illusion\":** The phenomenon is a perceptual illusion, meaning what we perceive differs from the physical reality of the stimulus.\n    *   **\"similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity\":** The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where the brain imposes a 3D structure on a 2D drawing, and can flip between two equally plausible interpretations. This comparison suggests the auditory phenomenon also involves the brain actively interpreting and \"constructing\" a perception rather than passively receiving sensory data.\n    *   **\"reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\":** This indicates that the phenomenon is not a rare trick but a fundamental process our brain uses constantly, likely to make sense of a complex world (like hearing a conversation in a noisy room).\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Clues and Image Analysis:**\n    *   The physical reality, as shown by the graphs, is a tone, followed by a noise, followed by the tone again. The tone is *not* present during the noise.\n    *   The illusion is that a listener will perceive the tone as *continuous*, sounding as if it persists *through* the noise burst. The brain \"fills in\" the missing part of the tone that was obscured by the noise.\n    *   This \"filling-in\" or \"restoration\" is a common, unconscious perceptual ability. Our brain assumes that it is more probable for a continuous sound to be momentarily masked by noise than for the sound to stop and then coincidentally restart just as the noise ends. It therefore constructs the most plausible perception: a continuous tone with noise laid over it.\n\n4.  **Identify the Phenomenon's Name:**\n    *   This auditory illusion was famously demonstrated by Richard M. Warren in 1970. He took a recorded sentence, removed one of the speech sounds (a phoneme), and replaced it with a non-speech sound like a cough or a tone.\n    *   Listeners reported that they heard the sentence as complete and intact, with the missing phoneme perceptually restored. They were often unable to even identify which sound had been replaced.\n    *   This phenomenon was named the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**.\n    *   While the original experiments used speech sounds (phonemes), the principle is general and applies to non-speech sounds like the pure tone shown in the image. In this context, it's also called the \"auditory continuity illusion,\" but \"Phonemic Restoration Effect\" is the most widely recognized and influential name for this type of perceptual completion.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Distinguish Perception from Physical Reality:** The core of the illusion is the difference between the physical sound waves (tone is absent) and the subjective experience (tone is heard continuously). The graphs show the physical reality.\n*   **The Role of Context:** The effect is powerful because the brain uses the context (the tone existing before and after the gap) to infer what happened during the gap.\n*   **Generality of the Effect:** Although the name specifies \"phonemic,\" the effect works with simpler sounds like tones and more complex sounds like music, demonstrating a general principle of auditory scene analysis.\n*   **Connection to \"Unconscious Ability\":** This effect is a key reason why we can understand speech in noisy environments. Our brain constantly \"restores\" parts of words that are obscured by background sounds, allowing us to perceive a coherent stream of speech.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the image and description perfectly match the classic auditory illusion where a missing sound is perceptually \"filled in\" when replaced by a noise. The most famous and established name for this is the Phonemic Restoration Effect.\n\n<<<Phonemic Restoration Effect>>>"
