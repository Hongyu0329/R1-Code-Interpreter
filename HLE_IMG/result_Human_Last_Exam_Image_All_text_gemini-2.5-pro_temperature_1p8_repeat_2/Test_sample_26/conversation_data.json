    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, first movement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Locate Measure 30:** The score has measure numbers printed. Measure 28 is the first measure of the second system on the page. Counting two measures to the right, we arrive at measure 30. The area is highlighted by a circle in the provided image.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Signature:** The key signature shown on the staff has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). This indicates the key of C minor (or its relative major, E♭ major). Given the strong tonic-dominant motion and the overall character, the piece is clearly in C minor.\n\n3.  **List the Notes in Measure 30:**\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The notes played are an arpeggiated chord consisting of C5, E♭5, G5, and B♭5.\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays a low C2 held as a half note and a C3 as a quarter note.\n    *   **Combined Notes:** Combining the notes from both hands, we have C, E♭, G, and B♭.\n\n4.  **Identify the Chord and its Quality:**\n    *   Stacking the notes in thirds from the bass note C, we get:\n        *   Root: C\n        *   Third: E♭ (a minor third above C)\n        *   Fifth: G (a perfect fifth above C)\n        *   Seventh: B♭ (a minor seventh above C)\n    *   A chord built with a root, minor third, perfect fifth, and minor seventh is a **minor seventh chord**. The chord is C minor seventh (Cm7).\n\n5.  **Determine the Chord's Function in the Key of C minor:**\n    *   The key is C minor.\n    *   The root of the chord is C, which is the first scale degree (the tonic) of C minor.\n    *   Therefore, this chord functions as the tonic chord.\n\n6.  **Construct the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   **Scale Degree:** Since the root is the tonic (the first degree of the scale), the Roman numeral will be based on 'I'.\n    *   **Quality:** In a minor key, the tonic triad is minor. A minor chord is represented by a lowercase Roman numeral. So, we use **'i'**.\n    *   **Seventh:** The chord is a seventh chord (it includes the note B♭, a seventh above the root C). This is indicated by adding a superscript '7'. So, we have **i⁷**.\n    *   **Inversion:** The lowest sounding note in the measure is C (in the bass clef). Since the root of the chord (C) is in the bass, the chord is in **root position**. Root position chords do not require any additional figured bass numbers.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Confirming the Key:** It's crucial to identify the correct key. The three-flat signature and the harmonic context (the preceding measure, m. 29, contains a clear G7 chord, which is the V7 of C minor) strongly confirm the key as C minor.\n*   **Identifying All Notes:** Ensure you account for all notes in both the right and left hands to build the complete harmony.\n*   **Chord Quality:** Differentiating between major (uppercase) and minor (lowercase) numerals is essential for accurate analysis. The E♭ makes the C chord minor.\n*   **Inversion:** Correctly identifying the bass note determines the chord's inversion. Here, the bass note is the root C, so it is in root position.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nThe chord in measure 30 is a C minor seventh chord in root position, which serves as the tonic seventh chord in the key of C minor. The correct Roman numeral representation for this is **i⁷**.\n\n<<<i⁷>>>"
