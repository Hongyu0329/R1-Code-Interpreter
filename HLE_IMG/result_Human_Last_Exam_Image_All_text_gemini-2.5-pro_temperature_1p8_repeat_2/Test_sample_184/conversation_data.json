    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the two final products.\n\n**Step 1: 4π Electrocyclic Ring Opening**\n\nThe first step is the thermal electrocyclic ring opening of the substituted cyclobutene. This is a 4π electron system (one π bond and one σ bond participating), and under thermal conditions (Δ), the reaction proceeds via a **conrotatory** motion according to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\n1.  **Reactant Stereochemistry:** The starting cyclobutene is `3-methoxy-4-methoxy-4-methylcyclobut-1-ene`. Based on the provided 3D representation:\n    *   At carbon C4, the methyl group (Me) is shown with a wedge (pointing up). The methoxy group (OMe) is shown with a dash (pointing down).\n    *   At carbon C3, the methoxy group (MeO) is drawn on a plain bond pointing down.\n    *   Comparing the substituents on C3 and C4, the Me group at C4 (up) and the MeO group at C3 (down) are `trans` to each other. The implicit hydrogen at C3 is up, making it `cis` to the Me group at C4.\n\n2.  **Conrotatory Motion:** In a conrotatory opening, the substituents at the breaking C3-C4 bond rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise). This leads to two possible diastereomeric dienes.\n    *   The diene skeleton formed is `(Me)(OMe)C=CH-CH=CH(OMe)`. We label the carbons of the diene system as C1' through C4': `(Me)(OMe)C(1')=CH(2')-CH(3')=CH(4')(OMe)`. The stereochemistry is determined at the C3'=C4' double bond.\n\n3.  **Formation of Two Diene Intermediates:**\n    *   **Rotation Mode 1 (e.g., CW/CW):** This mode leads to the formation of the **(Z)-diene** intermediate. Specifically, `(3'Z)-4-methoxy-1-methyl-1-methoxybuta-1,3-diene`. In the `s-cis` conformation required for the Diels-Alder reaction, the \"inward\" pointing groups (those that will be `cis` to the incoming dienophile in an endo transition state) are the `Me` group at C1' and the `MeO` group at C4'.\n    *   **Rotation Mode 2 (e.g., CCW/CCW):** This mode leads to the formation of the **(E)-diene** intermediate. Specifically, `(3'E)-4-methoxy-1-methyl-1-methoxybuta-1,3-diene`. In the `s-cis` conformation, the \"inward\" pointing groups are the `OMe` group at C1' and the `H` atom at C4'.\n\nSince both conrotatory modes are generally possible, the reaction proceeds through both the (E)-diene and (Z)-diene intermediates.\n\n**Step 2: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n\nThe second step is a [4+2] Diels-Alder reaction between the diene intermediates and ethyl acrylate (the dienophile). The problem specifies that the reaction occurs in an **endo** fashion.\n\n1.  **Endo Rule:** In an endo cycloaddition, the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (here, `-CO2Et`) is oriented `cis` to the \"inward\" pointing substituents of the diene in the transition state.\n\n2.  **Product from the (Z)-diene:**\n    *   The \"inward\" groups of the (Z)-diene are `Me` (at C1') and `MeO` (at C4').\n    *   Therefore, the endo product will have the `CO2Et` group `cis` to the `Me` group at the quaternary center and `cis` to the `MeO` group on the adjacent stereocenter.\n    *   Let's examine the options for this relative stereochemistry. In **Structure B**, the `CO2Et` group is dashed, the adjacent `MeO` group is dashed, and the `Me` group at the quaternary center is dashed. All three are `cis`. Structure B matches this outcome.\n\n3.  **Product from the (E)-diene:**\n    *   The \"inward\" groups of the (E)-diene are `OMe` (at C1') and `H` (at C4').\n    *   Therefore, the endo product will have the `CO2Et` group `cis` to the `OMe` group at the quaternary center and `cis` to the `H` atom at the adjacent stereocenter. A `cis` relationship to the `H` atom means a `trans` relationship to the `MeO` group at that center.\n    *   Let's examine the options for this relative stereochemistry. We need a product where `CO2Et` is `trans` to the adjacent `MeO` group, and `cis` to the `OMe` group at the quaternary center.\n    *   In **Structure D**, the `CO2Et` group is wedged, while the adjacent `MeO` group is dashed. They are `trans`. The `OMe` group at the quaternary center is also wedged, making it `cis` to the `CO2Et` group. Structure D matches this outcome.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reaction sequence produces a mixture of two diastereomeric products resulting from the endo addition to the two possible diene intermediates. These two products are **B** and **D**.\n\n<<<B and D>>>"
