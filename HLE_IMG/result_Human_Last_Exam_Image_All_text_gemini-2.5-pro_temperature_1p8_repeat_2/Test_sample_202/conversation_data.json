    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\nThe task is to identify the four rock specimens labeled H, I, J, and K. Rock identification is based on observing physical characteristics such as texture (crystal/grain size and arrangement), composition (indicated by color and mineral types), and overall structure.\n\n**1. Analysis of Specimen H:**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a very porous, sponge-like appearance. It is covered in small holes called vesicles. The underlying rock material appears to be fine-grained (aphanitic).\n*   **Careful Points:** The key features are the vesicular texture and the reddish/dark color. Vesicles form when gas bubbles are trapped in rapidly cooling lava. The color suggests a mafic or intermediate composition, rich in iron which oxidizes to give the red color.\n*   **Identification:** These characteristics are typical of **Scoria**. Scoria is a type of volcanic rock that is highly vesicular and denser than pumice. It's often a product of basaltic or andesitic lavas.\n\n**2. Analysis of Specimen I:**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is composed of numerous, angular rock fragments of various sizes and colors, which are cemented together in a lighter-colored, fine-grained matrix.\n*   **Careful Points:** The defining feature is its clastic texture, made of fragments (clasts) rather than interlocking crystals. The angularity of these fragments is crucial. Rocks made of angular fragments are called breccias. Since the fragments appear to be volcanic in origin (some are reddish, others gray), and the matrix could be volcanic ash, this is a type of pyroclastic rock.\n*   **Identification:** This specimen is a **Volcanic Breccia** (or Tuff Breccia). It forms from the accumulation and consolidation of angular volcanic debris, such as rock fragments and ash, from an explosive eruption.\n\n**3. Analysis of Specimen J:**\n*   **Observation:** This specimen is very light in color (white to light gray) and, like H, is extremely porous and full of vesicles. It appears to be very low in density.\n*   **Careful Points:** The combination of extremely high porosity (vesicular texture) and very light (felsic) color is characteristic. Felsic lavas are high in silica, making them very viscous, which traps gas bubbles effectively as the rock cools and solidifies very quickly.\n*   **Identification:** This rock is **Pumice**. Pumice is a volcanic glass so full of vesicles that it is very lightweight and can often float on water.\n\n**4. Analysis of Specimen K:**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. The crystal size is very coarse. There are light-colored crystals (white/pinkish, likely feldspar) and some darker minerals mixed in.\n*   **Careful Points:** The key texture is phaneritic (coarse-grained), indicating the rock cooled slowly deep underground (intrusive). The crystals are exceptionally large, which is a specific feature. The mix of light and dark minerals suggests a felsic to intermediate composition, similar to granite or diorite.\n*   **Identification:** The extremely coarse-grained nature points to it being a **Pegmatite**. Pegmatites are intrusive igneous rocks characterized by their very large crystals (typically over 1 cm in diameter). They are usually granitic in composition.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   **H:** Scoria (extrusive igneous, vesicular, mafic/intermediate)\n*   **I:** Volcanic Breccia (pyroclastic, clastic)\n*   **J:** Pumice (extrusive igneous, highly vesicular, felsic)\n*   **K:** Pegmatite (intrusive igneous, very coarse-grained/phaneritic)\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Volcanic Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite>>>"
