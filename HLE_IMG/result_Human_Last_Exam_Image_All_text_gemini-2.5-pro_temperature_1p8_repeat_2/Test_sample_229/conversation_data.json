    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to determine its title, musical style, and country of origin.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Musical Notation**\n*   **Time Signature:** The piece is in 4/4 time, as indicated by the 'C' symbol (common time) after the treble clef.\n*   **Key Signature:** There are no sharps or flats in the key signature, which typically indicates the key of C major or A minor.\n*   **Chords:** The chords provided above the staff (e.g., C, E7, F, G7, C-, D-) are typical of jazz harmony. The use of secondary dominants (like E7, which is the V chord of A minor) and chromatic alterations points towards a sophisticated jazz arrangement.\n*   **Melody and Rhythm:** The melody is highly syncopated, featuring many eighth and sixteenth notes, dotted rhythms, and rests on the beat. This creates a driving, \"swinging\" feel. The overall rhythmic character is energetic and upbeat.\n*   **Structure:** The instructions \"D.S. al Coda\" (indicated by the segno symbol ùÑã and the \"To Coda\" marking) along with repeat signs are standard structural elements in popular and jazz music, indicating a form where sections are repeated before jumping to a concluding section (Coda).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Musical Style**\n*   The combination of syncopation, a 4/4 swing feel, and the specific jazz-oriented chord progressions strongly indicates that the musical style is **Jazz**.\n*   The upbeat tempo (indicated by \"Mod.T J=120\" meaning a moderately fast tempo of 120 beats per minute) and the particular melodic phrasing are characteristic of **Early Jazz** styles like Dixieland and swing.\n*   This specific melody is a well-known staple in the **Gypsy Jazz** (or \"Jazz Manouche\") repertoire, popularized by guitarist Django Reinhardt. This style is known for its virtuosic, string-driven, and rhythmically intense interpretations of jazz standards.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Song Title**\n*   By transcribing or \"hearing\" the first few bars of the melody, we can identify the tune.\n    *   Pickup notes: G-G\n    *   First full measure: C-B-A-G\n*   This distinctive melodic opening is the main theme of the classic jazz standard **\"Limehouse Blues\"**. Although the chord progression in this specific chart might be a particular arrangement or reharmonization, the melody is unmistakably from that song.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Country of Origin**\n*   Researching the history of the song \"Limehouse Blues\" reveals its origin.\n*   The music was composed by **Philip Braham** with lyrics by **Douglas Furber**. Both were British composers.\n*   The song was written for the London revue *A to Z* in 1922. Limehouse is a district in London, which at the time was known as the city's Chinatown.\n*   Therefore, the song's country of origin is the **United Kingdom**.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis of the melody, harmony, rhythm, and historical context, the song can be confidently identified.\n\n*   **Title:** Limehouse Blues\n*   **Musical Style:** Jazz (specifically an early Jazz standard, and a staple of the Gypsy Jazz repertoire)\n*   **Country of Origin:** United Kingdom\n\n<<<**Title:** Limehouse Blues\n**Musical Style:** Jazz / Gypsy Jazz\n**Country of Origin:** United Kingdom>>>"
