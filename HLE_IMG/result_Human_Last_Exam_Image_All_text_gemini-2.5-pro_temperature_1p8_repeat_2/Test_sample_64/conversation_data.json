    "*   **Step-by-step Analysis:**\n    1.  **Observation of the initial image (Panel L):** The image shows a filamentous, tubular structure divided into segments by cross-walls called septa. This morphology is characteristic of a fungal hypha. The interior of the cells appears granular, representing the cytoplasm. An arrowhead points to one of the septa separating two adjacent cells.\n    2.  **Observation of the process in sequence (Panels M and N):** The panels L, M, and N appear to show a time sequence of an event.\n    3.  In **Panel M**, at the location indicated by the arrowhead, a bulge has started to form in the side wall of the hypha. The distinct line of the septum appears less defined, suggesting it is breaking down.\n    4.  In **Panel N**, the bulge is significantly larger, and the septum is no longer visible, indicating it has completely dissolved. The contents of the two adjacent cells now appear to be continuous, having merged into one larger compartment. The hypha is bent at this point, likely due to the structural weakness created by the partial dissolution of the cell wall.\n    5.  **Interpretation of the process:** The sequence shows the fusion of two adjacent cells within a single fungal hypha. This process involves the enzymatic degradation of the septum that separates the cells and a portion of the lateral cell wall. The internal turgor pressure of the cell then causes the weakened area to bulge outwards. The result is the merging of the protoplasts (the living contents of the cells).\n    6.  **Identification of the biological term:** This process of fusion between hyphal cells is known as **hyphal anastomosis** or **hyphal fusion**. In this specific case, it's the fusion of adjacent cells within the same hypha, which can serve various functions, such as bypassing damaged or dying cells and redistributing nutrients and organelles within the mycelial network.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   The subject is a multicellular filament with clear cross-walls (septa).\n    *   The panels are labeled L, M, and N, suggesting a temporal sequence.\n    *   The arrowheads consistently point to the same location, the junction between two specific cells, highlighting the area of activity.\n    *   The key events are the disappearance of a septum and the bulging of the cell wall, leading to the merging of cellular contents.\n    *   This is different from tip growth, which occurs at the apex of the hypha.\n    *   This is also different from branching, where a new hypha initiates and grows out from the side of an existing one.\n    *   This is a cell-to-cell fusion event.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the process depicted is the fusion of adjacent cells in a fungal hypha.\n\n<<<Hyphal fusion (anastomosis) between adjacent cells in a fungal hypha.>>>"
