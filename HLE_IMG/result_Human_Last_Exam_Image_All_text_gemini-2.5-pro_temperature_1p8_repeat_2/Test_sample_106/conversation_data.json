    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** The reaction shows a polycyclic alcohol reacting with a catalytic amount of strong acid (HCl) at high temperature (110 Â°C). The products are an alkene (with chemical formula C30H50) and water. This is a classic acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction, which likely proceeds via a carbocation intermediate and is prone to rearrangements.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Starting Material and Product:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** A pentacyclic triterpenoid alcohol. Although not named, its structure is characteristic of the friedelane skeleton. In these molecules, rearrangements are very common. Let's count the key substituents in the starting material that are likely to rearrange. We have angular methyl groups at C-4 (two of them), C-8, C-10, and C-14. There are also key hydrogens, particularly at C-5 and C-9. For the rearrangement to proceed to the expected product, we must also consider the substituent at C-13. In the friedelane skeleton, C-13 bears a methyl group.\n    *   **Product:** The product shown is also a pentacyclic triterpenoid skeleton but with a double bond. The molecular formula C30H50 confirms the loss of one molecule of water (C30H52O - H2O = C30H50) and the formation of one double bond. The specific locations of the substituents, labeled 1 through 5, have changed relative to the rest of the molecule, indicating a \"backbone rearrangement\" has occurred. The most thermodynamically stable product of this type of rearrangement is an olean-12-ene derivative, where the double bond is between C-12 and C-13. The drawing in the question is a schematic and potentially inaccurate representation of the final structure (e.g., the double bond appears to be drawn incorrectly, and position 5 is shown on an sp2 carbon), so we must rely on the known chemical transformation.\n\n3.  **Propose the Mechanism (Friedelane-Oleanene Rearrangement):** This is a well-known cascade of [1,2]-hydride and [1,2]-methyl shifts (Wagner-Meerwein shifts).\n    *   **Step 1:** The hydroxyl group at C-3 is protonated by HCl, forming a good leaving group (-OH2+).\n    *   **Step 2:** Water departs, leaving a secondary carbocation at C-3.\n    *   **Step 3:** A [1,2]-methyl shift occurs. A methyl group from the more substituted adjacent carbon, C-4, migrates to C-3. This moves the positive charge to C-4, forming a more stable tertiary carbocation. One methyl group remains at C-4. This corresponds to **position 1**. Therefore, **1 = CH3**.\n    *   **Step 4:** A [1,2]-hydride shift. The hydrogen atom at C-5 migrates to C-4. The positive charge moves to C-5 (tertiary carbocation).\n    *   **Step 5:** A [1,2]-methyl shift. The methyl group at C-10 (the location of **position 2**) migrates to C-5. The positive charge moves to C-10 (tertiary carbocation). The original methyl group at C-10 is now gone.\n    *   **Step 6:** A [1,2]-hydride shift. The hydrogen atom at C-9 migrates to C-10. This places a hydrogen atom at **position 2**. Therefore, **2 = H**. The positive charge moves to C-9 (tertiary carbocation).\n    *   **Step 7:** A [1,2]-methyl shift. The methyl group at C-8 (the location of **position 3**) migrates to C-9. The positive charge moves to C-8 (tertiary carbocation). The original methyl group at C-8 is now gone.\n    *   **Step 8:** A [1,2]-methyl shift. The methyl group at C-14 (the location of **position 4**) migrates to C-8. This places a methyl group at **position 3**. Therefore, **3 = CH3**. The positive charge moves to C-14 (tertiary carbocation). The original methyl group at C-14 is now gone.\n    *   **Step 9:** A [1,2]-methyl shift. In the friedelane skeleton, there is a methyl group at C-13 (the location of **position 5**). This methyl group migrates to C-14. This places a methyl group at **position 4**. Therefore, **4 = CH3**. The positive charge is now at C-13 (tertiary carbocation).\n    *   **Step 10:** An elimination reaction occurs to neutralize the carbocation. A proton is abstracted from the adjacent C-12, forming a stable tetrasubstituted double bond between C-12 and C-13. This yields the final olean-12-ene product.\n\n4.  **Determine the final substituent at Position 5:** After the rearrangement and elimination, position 5 (C-13) is an sp2-hybridized carbon atom participating in a double bond. It does not have a simple H or CH3 substituent attached in the conventional sense. The question, however, asks for a substituent (H or CH3). This suggests an ambiguity in the question's premise or diagram. Given that a methyl group started at this position and migrated away in the course of the reaction (Step 9), the most reasonable interpretation in the context of such problems is to identify the substituent that was originally at that position before it moved. That substituent was a methyl group. Therefore, we can assign **5 = CH3**.\n\n5.  **Final Tally:**\n    *   Position 1: A methyl group remains at C-4. **1 = CH3**\n    *   Position 2: The methyl group at C-10 leaves and a hydrogen atom takes its place. **2 = H**\n    *   Position 3: The methyl group at C-8 leaves and a methyl from C-14 takes its place. **3 = CH3**\n    *   Position 4: The methyl group at C-14 leaves and a methyl from C-13 takes its place. **4 = CH3**\n    *   Position 5: The methyl group at C-13 migrates away. Interpreting the question as asking for the original identity of this migrating group. **5 = CH3**\n\nPutting it all together in the required format.\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = CH3>>>"
