    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Algorithm:**\n    The provided pseudocode defines a recursive function `sort(a, n)` that intends to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`. Let's break down its logic.\n    *   **Base Case:** The recursion stops when `n` is less than or equal to 1, because the condition `if n > 1:` becomes false. An array of size 1 or 0 is already sorted.\n    *   **Recursive Step:** For `n > 1`, the function performs the following actions:\n        1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: It makes a recursive call to sort the subarray `a[0...n-2]`. After this call completes, we can assume that the first `n-1` elements are in non-decreasing order (`a[0] <= a[1] <= ... <= a[n-2]`).\n        2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: It compares the `n`-th element (`a[n-1]`) with the `(n-1)`-th element (`a[n-2]`). Since the prefix `a[0...n-2]` is now sorted, `a[n-2]` is the largest among them. This `if` statement checks if the `n`-th element is smaller than the largest element of the sorted prefix.\n        3.  `swap(a[n-1], a[n-2])`: If the condition is true, the two elements are swapped. This moves the smaller element (`a[n-1]`) one position to the left. However, this action may disrupt the sorted order of the prefix `a[0...n-2]`.\n        4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: To correct the possibly now-unsorted prefix, the algorithm makes a *second* recursive call to sort `a[0...n-2]` again.\n\n2.  **Identify the Worst-Case Scenario:**\n    To determine the worst-case time complexity, we need to find an input that forces the algorithm to do the maximum amount of work. The costliest part of the algorithm is the conditional block which contains a swap and a second recursive call. Therefore, the worst case occurs when the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true at every step of the recursion where it's possible.\n    Let's consider a reverse-sorted array, for instance `a = [n, n-1, ..., 2, 1]`.\n    *   At the top level, `sort(a, n)` is called.\n    *   The first call `sort(a, n - 1)` will sort the prefix `[n, n-1, ..., 2]`. After this call, the array `a` will be `[2, 3, ..., n, 1]`.\n    *   The `if` condition checks `a[n-1] < a[n-2]`, which corresponds to `1 < n`. This is true.\n    *   Therefore, the swap occurs, and crucially, the second `sort(a, n - 1)` call is made.\n    This demonstrates that a reverse-sorted array consistently triggers the `if` block, leading to the worst-case behavior.\n\n3.  **Formulate and Solve the Recurrence Relation:**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time complexity for a worst-case input of size `n`.\n    *   The first call `sort(a, n - 1)` takes `T(n - 1)` time.\n    *   The comparison `if a[n-1] < a[n-2]` and the `swap` operation take constant time, which we can denote as `O(1)` or `c`.\n    *   The second call `sort(a, n - 1)` is also made in the worst case, taking another `T(n - 1)` time.\n    Combining these, we get the recurrence relation for the worst case:\n    `T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + c`\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    The base case is `T(1) = d` (a constant).\n\n    Let's solve this recurrence by expansion:\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    *   `= 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 2^2 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n    *   `= 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 2^3 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c = 2^3 * T(n - 3) + c * (2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n    The general formula after `k` expansions is:\n    `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^k - 1)`\n    We expand until we hit the base case `T(1)`. This happens when `n - k = 1`, so `k = n - 1`. Substituting `k = n - 1`:\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * d + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n    `T(n) = (d + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    The dominant term in the expression for `T(n)` is `2^(n-1)`. In Big-O notation, constant factors and lower-order terms are ignored. Therefore, the time complexity is `O(2^(n-1))`, which simplifies to `O(2^n)`. The algorithm terminates because the recursion depth is finite (`n` decreases in each call).\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Two Recursive Calls:** The most important feature of this algorithm is the presence of two recursive calls to `sort(a, n - 1)` inside the `if n > 1` block. This structure is a strong hint towards an exponential complexity.\n*   **Conditional Second Call:** The second call is conditional. You must verify that there exists a class of inputs (the worst case) that consistently triggers this second call. Reverse-sorted arrays serve as this worst-case example.\n*   **Effect of Swap:** The swap operation invalidates the property that `a[0...n-2]` is sorted, which is why the second `sort(a, n - 1)` call is logically necessary for the algorithm to (slowly) produce a correct result.\n*   **Distinguishing from other sorts:** This algorithm is much less efficient than standard sorting algorithms like Merge Sort `(O(n log n))` or Bubble Sort `(O(n^2))`. The recurrence `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c` is characteristic of algorithms that explore a binary tree of possibilities of depth `n`, leading to `O(2^n)` complexity.\n\nFinal answer is `O(2^n)`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
