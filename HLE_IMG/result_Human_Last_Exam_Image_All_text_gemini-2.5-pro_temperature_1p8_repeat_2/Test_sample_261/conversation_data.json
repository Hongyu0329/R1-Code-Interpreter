    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to identify the book title:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements in the image fragment.**\nThe image displays a portion of an illustration. The main subject is a creature that is clearly a unicorn, identifiable by its horse-like body and the single, spiraled horn on its forehead.\n*   **Creature:** A unicorn, depicted in motion (galloping or running).\n*   **Color:** The unicorn is a ghostly white or very light blue. Its horn appears to be golden or yellowish.\n*   **Background:** The background behind the unicorn is dark, suggesting a night scene, a forest, or a cave.\n*   **Framing:** To the right of the unicorn, there is a portion of a stone pillar or an archway. It is painted in shades of yellow, beige, and brown, with some defined architectural lines.\n*   **Art Style:** The illustration is painterly and detailed, characteristic of fantasy book cover art.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate a hypothesis based on the elements.**\nThe combination of a unicorn, a dark setting (like a forbidden forest), and the distinct painterly art style is highly reminiscent of the Harry Potter series, specifically the cover art for the original US editions illustrated by Mary GrandPré. The unicorn is a significant creature in the first book.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the hypothesis by comparing the fragment to known book covers.**\nLet's examine the cover art for the first Harry Potter book, which has two common titles depending on the region.\n*   **US Title:** *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*\n*   **UK/Original Title:** *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone*\n\nThe cover art in question is the one created by Mary GrandPré for the US release. Let's look at the details of this specific cover:\n*   The main scene features Harry Potter on his broomstick.\n*   There are decorative arches and pillars framing the central image.\n*   On the bottom left of the cover, partially obscured by one of the arches, a white unicorn is shown galloping in a dark, wooded area.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the identification.**\nThe fragment provided is a direct crop of this specific detail from the cover of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* (US edition). The ghostly white unicorn, its golden horn, the dark background, and the edge of the beige-and-brown stone archway perfectly match the artwork on that cover.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
