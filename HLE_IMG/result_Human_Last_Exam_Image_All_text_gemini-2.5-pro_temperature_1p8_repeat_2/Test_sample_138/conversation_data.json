    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\nThe question asks to determine the biological sexes of three pairs of insects (A, B, and C). The key information provided is that these are pollinators from taxa without scopae on their legs, and both sexes feed on nectar. We need to use general morphological differences between male and female insects of the order Hymenoptera (bees and wasps) to make the determination.\n\n**General Rules for Sexing Bees and Wasps:**\n1.  **Antennae:** Males often have longer antennae with more segments (typically 13) than females (typically 12). In some species, male antennae are distinctively shaped (e.g., hooked at the tip).\n2.  **Abdomen (Gaster):** Females have a hidden stinger (a modified ovipositor). The shape of the terminal abdominal segment can be a key indicator. Females typically have 6 visible dorsal segments, while males have 7. Female abdomens may appear more pointed due to the stinger apparatus, while male abdomens can be more rounded or have specific terminal structures for mating.\n3.  **Facial Markings:** In many species, males have yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus), which are absent or reduced in females.\n4.  **Eyes:** Males sometimes have larger eyes than females.\n5.  **Pollen-carrying Structures (Scopae):** The question states these taxa *lack* scopae on their legs. This directs us to focus on other characteristics and may hint at the insects' lifestyle (e.g., they could be wasps, cuckoo bees, or bees that carry pollen internally).\n\n**Analysis of Pair A:**\n*   **Identification:** These appear to be cuckoo bees, likely of the genus *Coelioxys*. Cuckoo bees are cleptoparasites, meaning the females lay their eggs in the nests of other bees. Consequently, female cuckoo bees do not collect pollen and lack scopae, which fits the problem description.\n*   **Insect A (Left):** This individual has a sharply pointed, conical abdomen. This is a characteristic feature of female *Coelioxys* bees. The highly modified, pointed abdomen is used to pierce the cell wall of the host's nest to lay an egg. This is a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** This individual has a blunter abdomen that terminates in several spines or prongs. This multi-toothed abdominal tip is a defining characteristic of male *Coelioxys* bees. This is a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Female, Right is Male (F, M). This corresponds to **option 4**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair B:**\n*   **Identification:** These are wasps, most likely paper wasps of the genus *Polistes*. Wasps are pollinators that lack scopae. Both sexes feed on nectar.\n*   **Insect B (Left):** This wasp has relatively straight antennae. The abdomen tapers to a point, which is typical for a female containing a stinger. In *Polistes*, males have distinctively hooked antennae. The straight antennae here indicate this is a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Insect B (Right):** This wasp's antennae are clearly curled or hooked at the tips. This is a definitive characteristic of male *Polistes* wasps. This is a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Female, Right is Male (F, M). This corresponds to **option 4**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair C:**\n*   **Identification:** These appear to be long-horned bees (tribe Eucerini). The prompt's condition of \"no scopae on their legs\" is a bit tricky for this group as many females have prominent scopae, but we must focus on other definitive traits. The most obvious difference between the two is in their antennae.\n*   **Insect C (Left):** This bee has exceptionally long antennae, which is the defining characteristic of male long-horned bees (e.g., *Melissodes*, *Eucera*). Additionally, it has a prominent yellow patch on its clypeus (face), another common male trait in this group. This is a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Insect C (Right):** This bee has much shorter antennae, which is typical for a female of this group. Its face is dark, lacking the yellow markings of the male. The overall build is robust and hairy. These features (short antennae, dark face) are indicative of a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to **option 3**.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Pair A: F, M → Option 4\n*   Pair B: F, M → Option 4\n*   Pair C: M, F → Option 3\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of these option indices.\n\n<<<4, 4, 3>>>"
