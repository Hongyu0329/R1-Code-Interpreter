    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Concept of Cutoff Frequency**\n\nThe cutoff frequency ($f_c$ or angular frequency $\\omega_c = 2\\pi f_c$) of an RC filter is the frequency at which the output voltage magnitude drops to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its passband value. For a simple low-pass filter, this is determined by its time constant $\\tau = R_{th}C$, where $C$ is the capacitance and $R_{th}$ is the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor.\n\nThe angular cutoff frequency is given by:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\n\nIn this problem, the output is taken across the capacitor C, which is connected between node $a_0$ and ground ($b_0$). Therefore, we need to find the Thevenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, of the entire resistive network as seen from the terminals $a_0$ and ground.\n\n**2. Finding the Thevenin Equivalent Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\n\nTo find $R_{th}$, we must turn off all independent sources. The input source `IN` is connected at node $c_0$. Turning it off means connecting node $c_0$ to ground. The Thevenin resistance $R_{th}$ is then the resistance measured between node $a_0$ (which is the same as $d_0$) and ground.\n\nThe resistive network is an infinite ladder. This type of problem is well-suited for analysis using difference equations.\n\n**3. Setting up the Difference Equations**\n\nLet $v_c(k)$ and $v_d(k)$ be the voltages at nodes $c_k$ and $d_k$ respectively. We are looking for $R_{th}$ at node $d_0$, so we can imagine injecting a test current $I_0$ at $d_0$ and finding the resulting voltage $v_d(0)$. Then $R_{th} = v_d(0) / I_0$.\n\nThe boundary condition from grounding the input is $v_c(0) = 0$.\n\nFor any node $k \\ge 1$, we can write the Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) equations.\nAt node $c_k$:\n$\\frac{v_c(k) - v_c(k-1)}{r} + \\frac{v_c(k) - v_c(k+1)}{r} + \\frac{v_c(k) - v_d(k)}{r} = 0$\n$3v_c(k) - v_c(k-1) - v_c(k+1) - v_d(k) = 0$  (Eq. 1)\n\nAt node $d_k$:\n$\\frac{v_d(k) - v_d(k-1)}{r} + \\frac{v_d(k) - v_d(k+1)}{r} + \\frac{v_d(k) - v_c(k)}{r} = 0$\n$3v_d(k) - v_d(k-1) - v_d(k+1) - v_c(k) = 0$  (Eq. 2)\n\n**4. Solving the Difference Equations**\n\nWe look for solutions of the form $v_c(k) = A\\lambda^k$ and $v_d(k) = B\\lambda^k$. Substituting into the equations gives a linear system for A and B, which has non-trivial solutions if its determinant is zero. This leads to the characteristic equation for $\\lambda$:\n$(\\lambda - 4\\lambda + 1)(\\lambda^2 - 1) = 0$\nThe roots are $\\lambda = 1, 1, 2+\\sqrt{3}, 2-\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nFor the voltages to remain finite as $k \\to \\infty$, we must discard the root $\\lambda = 2+\\sqrt{3} > 1$. For the current to be zero at infinity, we discard the linear growth term $k \\cdot 1^k$.\nThe general solution for the voltage along the ladder for $k \\ge 0$ is a superposition of the remaining modes:\n$v_c(k) = C_s + C_a \\lambda_2^k$\n$v_d(k) = C_s - C_a \\lambda_2^k$\nwhere $\\lambda_2 = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$ is the decaying root, $C_s$ is the amplitude of the symmetric mode ($v_c=v_d$), and $C_a$ is the amplitude of the anti-symmetric mode ($v_c=-v_d$).\n\n**5. Applying Boundary Conditions**\n\n1.  At node $c_0$, the input is grounded: $v_c(0) = 0$.\n    $v_c(0) = C_s + C_a \\lambda_2^0 = C_s + C_a = 0 \\implies C_s = -C_a$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the general solutions:\n$v_c(k) = C_a(\\lambda_2^k - 1)$\n$v_d(k) = -C_a(1 + \\lambda_2^k)$\n\n2.  At node $d_0=a_0$, we inject a test current $I_0$. KCL at $d_0$ gives:\n    $I_0 = \\frac{v_d(0) - v_d(1)}{r}$\n    We have:\n    $v_d(0) = -C_a(1 + \\lambda_2^0) = -2C_a$\n    $v_d(1) = -C_a(1 + \\lambda_2^1) = -C_a(1 + \\lambda_2)$\n    \n    Substituting these into the KCL equation:\n    $I_0 = \\frac{-2C_a - [-C_a(1+\\lambda_2)]}{r} = \\frac{-2C_a + C_a + C_a\\lambda_2}{r} = \\frac{C_a(\\lambda_2 - 1)}{r}$\n    \n    We can express the coefficient $C_a$ in terms of the test current $I_0$:\n    $C_a = \\frac{r I_0}{\\lambda_2 - 1}$\n\n**6. Calculating the Final Resistance and Cutoff Frequency**\n\nNow we can find the Thevenin resistance $R_{th} = v_d(0) / I_0$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{-2C_a}{I_0} = \\frac{-2}{I_0} \\left( \\frac{r I_0}{\\lambda_2 - 1} \\right) = \\frac{-2r}{\\lambda_2 - 1} = \\frac{2r}{1 - \\lambda_2}$\n\nSubstitute the value of $\\lambda_2 = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r}{1 - (2 - \\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}$\n\nTo simplify, we rationalize the denominator:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\\sqrt{3} - 1)(\\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\nFinally, the cutoff angular frequency $\\omega_c$ is:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nThe cutoff frequency $f_c$ in Hertz would be:\n$f_c = \\frac{\\omega_c}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C}$\n\nSince the problem asks for \"the cutoff frequency\", and typically in such derivations the angular frequency expression is simpler and presented, we provide $\\omega_c$.\n\nFinal Answer: The cutoff frequency at node $a_0$ is $\\frac{1}{rC(1+\\sqrt{3})}$.\n\n<<<$1/(r*C*(1+sqrt(3)))>>>"
