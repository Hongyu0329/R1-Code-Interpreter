    "This is my step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each of the 9 works.\n\n1.  **Work 1 (Top-Left):** This painting depicts women from a Chinese ethnic minority in detailed traditional dress. The style is a realistic form of Chinese ink and color painting. In the top right corner, there is a signature that reads \"邦彦\" (Bāng Yàn) and a red seal. This is the artist **Chen Bangyan (陈邦彦)**, who is well-known for his figure paintings of ethnic minorities.\n\n2.  **Work 2 (Top-Middle):** This is an abstract landscape painting in black ink. The artist uses bold, minimalist lines to depict houses and trees. This highly distinctive style, blending Chinese ink tradition with Western modernism, is a hallmark of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**.\n\n3.  **Work 3 (Top-Right):** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in a very energetic and powerful cursive script (草书). The red seals are key identifiers. The top seal reads \"毛泽东\" (Mao Zedong), and the one below it reads \"润之\" (Runzhi), which was his courtesy name. The calligraphy style is also unmistakably that of **Mao Zedong (毛泽东)**.\n\n4.  **Work 4 (Middle-Left):** This is another piece of Chinese calligraphy, in a steady and graceful semi-cursive script (行书). On the far left, the signature \"于右任\" (**Yu Youren**) is clearly visible. Yu Youren was one of the most celebrated calligraphers of the 20th century, and this work is a prime example of his style.\n\n5.  **Work 5 (Middle-Center):** This is a realistic oil painting portraying a young woman holding a sketchbook and a pencil. The work is a masterpiece of Chinese Realism, renowned for its technical perfection and psychological depth. This is the famous painting \"The Young Painter\" (青年女画家) by **Jin Shangyi (靳尚誼)**.\n\n6.  **Work 6 (Middle-Right):** This work is a modern Chinese ink painting of a woman with an elaborate headdress, with sparrows in the background. The delicate, elegant style that combines meticulous traditional techniques with a contemporary feel is the signature of **He Jiaying (何家英)**, a famous contemporary figure painter.\n\n7.  **Work 7 (Bottom-Left):** This is a brightly colored painting of a rural scene with gourds on a trellis and laundry hanging to dry. The vibrant colors, simplified forms, and focus on the beauty of everyday life are characteristic of the later works of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**. His signature and the date 1996 are also visible.\n\n8.  **Work 8 (Bottom-Middle):** This is a landscape painting (山水画) of a misty river gorge with many boats. The use of heavy ink washes to build up the dark, monumental mountains and create an atmospheric effect is characteristic of the master **Li Keran (李可染)**, famous for his powerful landscape paintings.\n\n9.  **Work 9 (Bottom-Right):** This is an ink wash painting of a lobster. The simple, economical, yet lively and energetic brushwork used to capture the essence of animals, especially crustaceans like shrimp and lobsters, is the most iconic style of the great master **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the authors from left to right, top to bottom are:\n1. Chen Bangyan\n2. Wu Guanzhong\n3. Mao Zedong\n4. Yu Youren\n5. Jin Shangyi\n6. He Jiaying\n7. Wu Guanzhong\n8. Li Keran\n9. Qi Baishi\n\n<<<Chen Bangyan, Wu Guanzhong, Mao Zedong, Yu Youren, Jin Shangyi, He Jiaying, Wu Guanzhong, Li Keran, Qi Baishi>>>"
