    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the overall structure of the molecule.**\n    The image displays a ball-and-stick model of a large, ring-shaped organic molecule. The dark grey spheres represent carbon atoms, and the light grey/white spheres represent hydrogen atoms. The molecule is a macrocycle, meaning a cyclic molecule with a large number of atoms in the ring.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the constituent building blocks.**\n    By examining the structure more closely, we can see that the ring is composed of two types of alternating chemical units:\n    1.  **Aromatic Rings:** There are planar, six-membered carbon rings. Each of these rings has four hydrogen atoms attached to it and is connected to two other units. The arrangement of atoms and the implied bonding (aromatic system) identify these as phenylene groups. The connections to the rest of the molecule are at opposite ends of the ring (positions 1 and 4), which is known as *para*-substitution. Therefore, these units are *para*-phenylene groups (-C₆H₄-).\n    2.  **Linker Units:** Between each pair of phenylene groups, there is a linear two-carbon unit. The linear geometry of the four atoms involved (the two linker carbons and the two carbons from the adjacent phenylene rings) is characteristic of an sp-hybridized carbon-carbon triple bond. This linker is an ethynylene group (-C≡C-).\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the number of repeating units.**\n    The entire macrocycle is constructed by repeating the {*para*-phenylene-ethynylene} motif. To name the specific molecule, we need to count how many of these repeating units are present. By starting at any phenylene group and counting around the ring, we find there are 12 *para*-phenylene units and 12 ethynylene linkers. Thus, there are 12 repeating units in total.\n\n*   **Step 4: Assemble the systematic name.**\n    The systematic name for this class of molecules is derived by combining the names of the components and specifying their number and arrangement.\n    *   The prefix **cyclo-** indicates that it is a cyclic molecule.\n    *   The number of repeating {*para*-phenylene-ethynylene} units is given in brackets. In this case, it is **[12]**.\n    *   The name of the repeating unit is **para-phenyleneethynylene**.\n\n*   **Step 5: Final Name.**\n    Combining these parts gives the full name of the molecule. This family of molecules is known as cycloparaphenylene ethynylenes (CPEs) or \"nanohoops\".\n\nThe final name of the molecule is cyclo[12]para-phenyleneethynylene.\n\n<<<cyclo[12]para-phenyleneethynylene>>>"
