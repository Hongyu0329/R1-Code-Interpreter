    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip, one must first identify the greatest distance between two consecutive R-waves (the prominent peaks of the QRS complex) and then calculate the corresponding time based on the paper speed.\n\n**1. Reading the ECG Grid:**\nThe ECG paper speed is noted as 25 mm/sec. On a standard ECG grid at this speed, the time is measured as follows:\n*   Each small 1 mm square on the horizontal axis represents 0.04 seconds.\n*   Each large 5 mm square on the horizontal axis represents 0.20 seconds.\n\n**2. Locating the Longest R-R Interval:**\nBy visually inspecting the entire rhythm strip, a significant pause is evident in the fourth strip from the top, which is marked near the time `0:06:08`. This pause represents the longest interval between two consecutive heartbeats (R-R interval) on this ECG.\n\n**3. Measuring and Calculating the Interval:**\nTo calculate the duration of this interval, we count the number of squares between the peaks of the two R-waves surrounding the pause:\n*   The distance between these two R-waves covers approximately 8 large squares and 2 small squares.\n*   This can be calculated in two ways:\n    *   **Using large and small squares:** (8 large squares × 0.20 s/large square) + (2 small squares × 0.04 s/small square) = 1.60 s + 0.08 s = **1.68 s**.\n    *   **Using only small squares:** A total of 42 small squares (8 large squares × 5 small squares/large square + 2 small squares) are counted. 42 small squares × 0.04 s/small square = **1.68 s**.\n\nTherefore, the longest R-R interval on this rhythm strip is 1.68 seconds.\n\n<<<1.68>>>"
