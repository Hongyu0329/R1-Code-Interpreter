    "The process depicted in the image is the formation of a **clamp connection** in the hyphae of a basidiomycete fungus. The panels L, M, and N show the initial development of this specialized structure.\n\nA clamp connection is a hook-like structure that forms on a growing hyphal cell. Its primary function is to ensure that when a cell containing two distinct nuclei (a dikaryotic cell) divides, each of the new daughter cells also receives one of each type of nucleus. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining genetic variation within the fungus. The presence of clamp connections is a characteristic and identifying feature of many, though not all, fungi belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota, which includes mushrooms.\n\nThe process begins at the terminal segment of a hypha, which contains two different nuclei (n+n).\n\n*   A small pocket or bulge, which will become the clamp, forms on the cell wall and grows backward.\n*   Simultaneously, the two nuclei inside the cell divide through mitosis.\n*   One of the newly divided nuclei moves into the developing clamp structure, while the other three nuclei position themselves within the main filament.\n*   Finally, cell walls (septa) form, separating the clamp and the original cell, resulting in two new cells that each maintain the dikaryotic state. The clamp then fuses with the adjacent cell, transferring its nucleus and completing the process.\n\nThe images provided capture the early stage of this process, where the bulge, indicated by the arrowheads in panels M and N, has started to form from the side of the fungal filament.<<<clamp connection formation>>>"
