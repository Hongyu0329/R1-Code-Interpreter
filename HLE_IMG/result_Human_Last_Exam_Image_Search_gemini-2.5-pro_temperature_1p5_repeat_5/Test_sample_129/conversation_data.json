    "Based on a reverse image search and subsequent queries, the protein in the image is the **PTEN (Phosphatase and tensin homolog) tumor suppressor**.\n\nSpecifically, the image shows the crystal structure of the human PTEN tumor suppressor, which is cataloged in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the ID **1D5R**.\n\nHere are some key details about this protein:\n\n*   **Function:** PTEN is a dual-specificity phosphatase, meaning it can act on both protein and lipid substrates. Its role as a lipid phosphatase is crucial for its function as a tumor suppressor. It antagonizes the PI3K-AKT/PKB signaling pathway, which is involved in cell growth, proliferation, and survival.\n*   **Structure:** The structure of PTEN includes a phosphatase domain and a C2 domain. The phosphatase domain is similar to that of other protein phosphatases but has a larger active site, which is important for accommodating its phosphoinositide substrate. The C2 domain helps to position the catalytic domain on the cell membrane.\n*   **Clinical Significance:** Mutations in the PTEN gene are found in a wide variety of human cancers and are linked to several hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes. The loss of its function can lead to uncontrolled cell growth.\n\nThe image you provided shows a ribbon diagram of this protein, a common way to visualize the 3D structure and its secondary structural elements like alpha-helices and beta-sheets.\n\n<<<PTEN (Phosphatase and tensin homolog) tumor suppressor / PDB ID: 1D5R>>>"
