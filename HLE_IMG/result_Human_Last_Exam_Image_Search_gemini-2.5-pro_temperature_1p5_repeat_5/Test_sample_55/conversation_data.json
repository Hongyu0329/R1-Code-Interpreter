    "An accurate Roman numeral for the circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, is **V⁶⁄₅**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the analysis:\n*   **Key:** The piece is in D minor.\n*   **Notes:** The notes circled in measure 8 consist of A, C-sharp, E, and G, played between the right and left hands.\n*   **Chord Identification:** These notes form an A dominant seventh chord (A7).\n*   **Function in D minor:** In the key of D minor, the V (dominant) chord is A major. The addition of the minor seventh (G) makes it a dominant seventh chord (V7). This chord creates a strong pull towards the tonic, D minor, which follows in the next measure.\n*   **Inversion:** The lowest note sounding in the harmony is C-sharp, which is the third of the A7 chord. When the third of a seventh chord is in the bass, the chord is in its first inversion.\n*   **Figured Bass:** The figured bass symbol for a first-inversion seventh chord is ⁶⁄₅.\n\nTherefore, the complete and accurate Roman numeral for this chord is V⁶⁄₅.\n<<<V⁶⁄₅>>>"
