    "The knot in the picture is the 8₁₉ knot. The Rasmussen invariant, often denoted as *s*, for this knot is -6.\n\nThe Rasmussen s-invariant is a modern integer-valued invariant of a knot that provides a lower bound for the slice genus of the knot. For alternating knots, the Rasmussen invariant is equal to the knot's signature. However, the 8₁₉ knot is the first non-alternating knot in the standard knot table.\n\nThis knot is also known as the torus knot T(4,3) and the pretzel knot P(3,3,-2).\n\n<<<–6>>>"
