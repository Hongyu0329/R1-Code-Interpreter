    "The book that has the presented fragment on its cover is \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\". The image is a small section of the original United States edition's cover art, which was illustrated by Mary GrandPr√©.\n\nThe cover of \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" features several elements from the story. The fragment in question shows a unicorn with a golden horn, which is depicted running in the background on the left-hand side of the full cover. The sliver of the golden, ornate design visible on the right of the image is part of the decorative border that frames the central illustration. The complete cover artwork also includes Harry Potter on his broomstick, and Hogwarts Castle. This edition was first published by Scholastic in 1998.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
