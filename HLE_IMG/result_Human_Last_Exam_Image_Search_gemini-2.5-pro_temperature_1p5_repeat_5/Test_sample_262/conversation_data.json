    "To determine which of the depicted complexes are expected to show shorter lifetimes in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), we must analyze their chemical structures and identify features known to affect operational stability.\n\n### Analysis of the Molecular Structures\n\nAll four compounds are cationic iridium(III) complexes with the general formula `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]PF6`.\n*   The central metal is iridium (Ir).\n*   The `N^N` ligand in all four complexes is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. Since this ligand is identical for all complexes, it is not the differentiating factor for their lifetimes.\n*   The `C^N` ligands are fluorinated derivatives of 2-phenylpyridine (ppy). The key difference between the four complexes lies in the position of the fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring of these cyclometalating ligands.\n*   The stability of such iridium complexes, and consequently the lifetime of devices made from them, is critically dependent on the strength of the iridium-carbon (Ir-C) covalent bond. This bond is often the weakest point in the molecule and its cleavage is a primary degradation pathway.\n\n### The Role of Fluorine Substitution\n\nFluorination of the phenylpyridine ligand has a significant impact on the complex's properties:\n1.  **Electronic Effects:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom. Its electron-withdrawing nature strengthens the Ir-C bond through inductive effects when it is positioned *meta* or *para* to the bond. A stronger Ir-C bond enhances the stability of the complex, leading to longer device lifetimes.\n2.  **Steric Effects:** When a fluorine atom is placed in a position *ortho* to the Ir-C bond (i.e., on the carbon atom adjacent to the metalated carbon), it introduces significant steric hindrance. This steric clash between the fluorine atom and other parts of the complex can weaken the crucial Ir-C bond. A weakened Ir-C bond makes the complex more susceptible to degradation during device operation, resulting in a shorter lifetime.\n\n### Evaluating Each Complex\n\nLet's examine the position of the fluorine atoms relative to the Ir-C bond in each complex:\n\n*   **Complex 1:** The fluorine atoms are located on the phenyl ring at positions far from the Ir-C bond (positions 4' and 5' relative to the pyridine-phenyl bond, which are *meta* and *para* to the Ir-C bond). There are no fluorine atoms in the *ortho* positions. This configuration is expected to strengthen the Ir-C bond, leading to high stability and a **longer** lifetime.\n\n*   **Complex 2:** A fluorine atom is present at the 6' position of the phenyl ring. This position is *ortho* to the Ir-C bond (at the 2' position). This *ortho*-fluorine creates steric hindrance, which is expected to weaken the Ir-C bond and thus lead to a **shorter** lifetime.\n\n*   **Complex 3:** A fluorine atom is present at the 2' position of the phenyl ring (this would be written as 2-(2',X'-difluorophenyl)pyridine). This position is also *ortho* to the Ir-C bond (assuming cyclometalation at the 6' position to avoid C-F bond activation), or more generally, it is adjacent to the pyridine ring, causing significant steric strain. Literature confirms that complexes with F at the 2' position show poor stability. Regardless of the exact cyclometalation site, the proximity of the fluorine to the coordination sphere introduces instability. This leads to an expectation of a **shorter** lifetime.\n\n*   **Complex 4:** This complex has fluorine atoms at the 2' and 5' positions of the phenyl ring. The fluorine at the 2' position, like in Complex 3, is in an *ortho*-like position relative to the coordination core, inducing steric strain and leading to instability. Therefore, Complex 4 is also expected to have a **shorter** lifetime.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComplexes **2**, **3**, and **4** all feature fluorine atoms in positions *ortho* to the Ir-C bond or otherwise sterically encumbering the coordination core. This structural feature is known to decrease the stability of the complex and shorten the operational lifetime of LEC devices. Complex 1 lacks this feature and is therefore expected to be the most stable.\n\nThus, complexes,, and are expected to show shorter lifetimes.\n\n<<<N>>>"
