    "The timestamps of the synchronized bursts are approximately **3 s, 17 s, 36 s, and 49 s**.\n\nTo calculate the average inter-burst interval:\n1.  Calculate the time between each consecutive burst:\n    *   Interval 1 = 17 s - 3 s = 14 s\n    *   Interval 2 = 36 s - 17 s = 19 s\n    *   Interval 3 = 49 s - 36 s = 13 s\n2.  Calculate the average of these intervals:\n    *   Average = (14 + 19 + 13) / 3 = 46 / 3 â‰ˆ 15.33 s\n\nRounding to two significant figures, the average inter-burst interval is 15 s.\n<<<15 s>>>"
