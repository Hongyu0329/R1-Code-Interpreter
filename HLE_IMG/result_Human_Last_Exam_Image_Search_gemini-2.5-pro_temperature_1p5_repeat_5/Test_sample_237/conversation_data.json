    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. It is a longhorn beetle, and its scientific name is *Stictoleptura rubra*.\n\nThis beetle is commonly known as the red-brown longhorn beetle. It is part of the Cerambycidae family. An interesting characteristic of this species is its significant sexual dimorphism. Females have a reddish-brown or reddish-orange pronotum and elytra (wing cases). In contrast, males have a black head and pronotum with brown or pale ochre elytra. Based on the coloration in the photograph, the beetle is likely a female.\n\n*Stictoleptura rubra* can be found throughout Europe, Russia, and North Africa. The larvae develop in the dead wood of coniferous trees, and the adult beetles are often seen from May to September, feeding on the nectar and pollen of flowering plants.\n\n<<<Stictoleptura rubra>>>"
