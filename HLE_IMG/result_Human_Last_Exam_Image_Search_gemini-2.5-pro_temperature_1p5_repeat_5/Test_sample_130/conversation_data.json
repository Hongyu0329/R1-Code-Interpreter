    "Based on the provided image of spectral lines, the element is **Iron (Fe)**.\n\nEach element has a unique \"fingerprint\" of spectral lines which can be used to identify it. The image displays a complex series of lines across the visible spectrum, which is characteristic of iron's atomic emission spectrum. The large number of lines is due to the many possible electron transitions within the iron atom.\n\nIron is a significant element found in stars, and its spectral lines are prominent in the sun's spectrum. In fact, about 30% of the lines in the solar spectrum belong to iron. The study of such spectral lines, both emission and absorption, is a fundamental method used in astronomy to determine the chemical composition of celestial objects like stars and planets.\n\n<<<Iron>>>"
