    "This jazz standard is \"Nica's Dream,\" composed by Horace Silver.\n\nThe piece was first recorded in 1956 by The Jazz Messengers and is a tribute to the jazz patroness Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter. The lead sheet in the image shows the characteristic melody and the distinct chord progression in F minor, which are hallmarks of this composition. The A sections typically feature a Latin feel, while the bridge often shifts to a swing rhythm.\n\n<<<\"Nica's Dream\" by Horace Silver>>>"
