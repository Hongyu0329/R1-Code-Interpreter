    "The plant in the image is *Pittosporum cornifolium*, also known as tƒÅwhiri karo.\n\nThis plant is endemic to New Zealand. Specifically, it is native to the North Island and the Marlborough Sounds of the South Island. It is considered rare in the wild but is found more frequently on offshore islands in the northeast. There is also a distinct form found on the Poor Knights Islands, which some have proposed as a separate species, *Pittosporum roimata*.\n\n<<<North Island, New Zealand>>>"
