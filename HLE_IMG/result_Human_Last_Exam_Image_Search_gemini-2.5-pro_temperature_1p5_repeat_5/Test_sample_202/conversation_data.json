    "Based on a visual analysis of the specimens and supporting information from web searches, the rocks can be identified as follows:\n\n*   **Specimen H is Scoria.** This rock is characterized by its reddish-brown color and numerous visible, bubble-like cavities known as vesicles. Scoria is an extrusive igneous rock, typically dark in color (brown, black, or reddish) and can have a composition similar to basalt. Its vesicular texture is the result of gas bubbles being trapped as lava cooled and solidified.\n\n*   **Specimen I is Volcanic Breccia.** This rock is composed of angular fragments of other rocks cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. Volcanic breccias form from explosive volcanic eruptions that shatter rock fragments, which then get consolidated. The angular nature of the clasts indicates they were not transported far from their source.\n\n*   **Specimen J is Pumice.** This specimen is light-colored and, like scoria, is highly vesicular. Pumice is a type of volcanic glass that forms from gas-rich, viscous magma that cools rapidly. It is typically white, cream, or grey and has so many tiny vesicles that it is very lightweight and can often float on water, unlike scoria which is denser and sinks.\n\n*   **Specimen K is Pegmatite.** The defining characteristic of this rock is its very large, interlocking crystals, which are easily visible. Pegmatite is an intrusive igneous rock, meaning it cooled slowly deep beneath the Earth's surface, which allowed for the growth of these exceptionally large crystals. While most commonly having a composition similar to granite (quartz, feldspar, and mica), its primary classification is based on its coarse-grained texture.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Volcanic Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
