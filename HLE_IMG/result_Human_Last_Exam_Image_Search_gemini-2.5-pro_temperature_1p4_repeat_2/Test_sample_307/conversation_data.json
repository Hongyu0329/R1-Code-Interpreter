    "To find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm among the nine Wigner 3-j symbols, a careful analysis of the provided image and its source is necessary. The infinity-norm for each sub-plot corresponds to the maximum absolute value of the Wigner 3-j symbol entries represented in that plot.\n\nThe image provided is Figure 2 from the scientific paper \"Analysis and visualization of the Wigner 3-j, 6-j, and 9-j symbols\" by D. N. Futyan and D. J. M. Moss. The figure displays the Wigner 3-j symbols for the parameters j₂=8, j₃=8, with j₁ values of 1, 2, and 3, and m₁ values of -1, 0, and 1.\n\nThe plots are arranged with j₁ increasing from left to right, and m₁ increasing from top to bottom (-1, 0, 1). Crucially, the paper states that the color scale in each subplot is normalized to its own maximum absolute value (its infinity-norm). Therefore, a visual comparison of color intensity between different plots is not a reliable way to compare their infinity-norms.\n\nThe paper provides the precise infinity-norms for each plot in Table I. The values are as follows:\n*   **Plot 1 (j₁=1, m₁=-1):** 0.0878\n*   **Plot 2 (j₁=2, m₁=-1):** 0.0875\n*   **Plot 3 (j₁=3, m₁=-1):** 0.0870\n*   **Plot 4 (j₁=1, m₁=0):** 0.0984\n*   **Plot 5 (j₁=2, m₁=0):** 0.0970\n*   **Plot 6 (j₁=3, m₁=0):** 0.0954\n*   **Plot 7 (j₁=1, m₁=1):** 0.0878\n*   **Plot 8 (j₁=2, m₁=1):** 0.0875\n*   **Plot 9 (j₁=3, m₁=1):** 0.0870\n\nFrom this set of values, we can identify the maximum and minimum norms:\n*   The **maximum infinity-norm** is 0.0984, which corresponds to plot 4.\n*   The **minimum infinity-norm** is 0.0870, which corresponds to plots 3 and 9.\n\nThe ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm is calculated as:\n\nRatio = (Maximum Norm) / (Minimum Norm) = 0.0984 / 0.0870 ≈ 1.131\n\n<<<1.131>>>"
