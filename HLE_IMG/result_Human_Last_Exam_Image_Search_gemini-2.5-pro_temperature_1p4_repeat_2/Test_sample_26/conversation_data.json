    "To determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata, a harmonic analysis is necessary. The sonata is in the key of C minor.\n\n1.  **Identify the notes:** The measure in question, which is circled in the provided image, is measure 30. The notes played in this measure are G and B-natural in the right hand, followed by a broken chord consisting of D, F-sharp, B-natural, and G. The left hand plays a G octave. The complete collection of notes in this measure is G, B-natural, D, and F-sharp.\n\n2.  **Analyze the chord:** These notes (G-B♮-D-F♯) form a G major seventh chord.\n\n3.  **Determine the function in the key of C minor:** The home key is C minor. The dominant chord (the chord built on the fifth degree of the scale, which is G) is typically a G major triad (G-B♮-D) when used in a cadence. The B is raised to a B-natural (from the B-flat in the key signature) to create a leading tone that resolves strongly to the tonic, C. The chord in measure 30 is built on this dominant note G.\n\n4.  **Consider chromatic alterations:** The presence of an F-sharp is a chromatic alteration. The standard dominant seventh chord in C minor would be G-B♮-D-F♮. The F-sharp in measure 30 is part of an arpeggiated figure. Some analyses consider this F# a chromatic passing tone leading to the G on the next beat. Others interpret it as part of the harmony, creating a more complex chord. According to an analysis from Pearson Education, this measure contains an augmented 6th chord. Specifically, it functions as a German augmented sixth chord (Ger⁺⁶).\n\nA German augmented sixth chord in C minor is typically spelled A♭-C-E♭-F♯. However, when built on the dominant, as it resolves to the dominant, it takes a different form. In this context, the chord in measure 30 (G-B♮-D-F♯) is best understood as a doubly augmented fourth on the dominant, which strongly resolves to the tonic chord in the following measure. However, for the purpose of standard Roman numeral analysis, it is most commonly analyzed based on its root and quality relative to the key.\n\nGiven that the chord is built on the dominant (G) and functions as a dominant leading to the tonic (C minor in the next measure), the core of the harmony is V. The alterations (the F#) add significant color and tension but do not change its fundamental function as the dominant. Therefore, it is a V chord. Because it contains the major seventh (F#) instead of the minor seventh, it would be notated as V<sup>M7</sup> or Vmaj7. If one interprets the F# as a non-chord tone, the analysis simplifies to V. Given its clear dominant function leading to the tonic in measure 31, the most appropriate and common analysis is to label it based on its dominant root.\n\n<<<V<sup>M7</sup>>>>"
