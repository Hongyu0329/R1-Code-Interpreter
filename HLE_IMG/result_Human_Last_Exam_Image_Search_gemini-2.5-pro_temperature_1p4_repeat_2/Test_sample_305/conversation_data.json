    "The product advertised is from the French cosmetics company **Bourjois**.\n\nDuring World War II, the British advertising for Bourjois, particularly its \"Evening in Paris\" (Soir de Paris) line, targeted women who had been recruited into war work. The campaign suggested that while doing strenuous, traditionally masculine jobs, women faced the \"inherent limitation\" of losing their sense of femininity and morale. The advertisements positioned Bourjois cosmetics as the solution, allowing women to maintain their glamour and identity. The ad shown in the image, with the headline \"Women are winning the War - of Freedom,\" is a part of this campaign. It was sold in department stores and chemists like Boots and Marks & Spencer, as noted in the advertisement's footer.\n\n<<<Bourjois>>>"
