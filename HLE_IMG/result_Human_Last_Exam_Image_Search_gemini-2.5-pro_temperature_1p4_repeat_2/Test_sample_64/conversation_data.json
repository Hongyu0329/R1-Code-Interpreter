    "The images depict a cellular repair process in the filamentous red alga *Griffithsia pacifica*. Specifically, it shows the formation and interaction of specialized cells to replace a dead or damaged cell within the filament.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the process shown:\n*   When an intercalary (non-terminal) cell in a *Griffithsia* filament dies, the adjacent cells are triggered to initiate a repair sequence.\n*   The cell located above the dead one produces a \"repair rhizoid,\" which grows downwards.\n*   The cell below the dead one forms a \"repair shoot,\" which grows upwards. The images labeled L, M, and N likely show the bulging and growth of one of these repair cells. The arrowhead points to the site of new growth, which leads to the bending of the cell towards its fusion partner.\n*   These two specialized cells are attracted to each other, grow, and eventually fuse to create a new, single cell that bridges the gap, thus repairing the filament.\n\nThis remarkable repair mechanism is coordinated by a hormone called rhodomorphin, a glycoprotein that induces the formation of the repair cells and guides their growth towards each other. The entire process is a form of somatic cell fusion, a wound-healing response that ensures the integrity of the algal filament.\n\n<<<The process being depicted in the image is somatic cell fusion for filament repair in the red alga *Griffithsia*.>>>"
