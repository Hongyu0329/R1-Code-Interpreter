    "The chemical reaction shown is the acid-catalyzed dehydration and backbone rearrangement of friedelan-3-ol. This complex transformation is a classic example of a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, which involves a series of concerted 1,2-hydride and 1,2-methyl shifts. The starting friedelane skeleton rearranges to form a more stable oleanane-type skeleton.\n\nTo determine the identity of the substituents (either a hydrogen atom, H, or a methyl group, CH3) at the numbered positions in the product, one must trace the migration of these groups during the rearrangement cascade.\n\nHere is the step-by-step determination for each position:\n\n*   **1 = CH3**: This position is on a methyl group attached to the first ring (Ring A) of the molecule. This part of the skeleton is not involved in the core rearrangement, and the methyl group remains in its original position.\n*   **2 = H**: Position 2 is located at the junction of what becomes Rings B and C in the product. In the starting material, this carbon atom has a methyl group. During the rearrangement, a hydrogen atom from an adjacent carbon migrates to this position, displacing the original methyl group which moves to another location.\n*   **3 = CH3**: This position is at the junction of Rings C and D. It initially has a hydrogen atom. The rearrangement cascade causes a methyl group from the neighboring junction (Position 4's origin) to shift to this location.\n*   **4 = CH3**: Position 4 is at the central ring junction. It starts with a methyl group, which migrates to Position 3. Subsequently, another methyl group from the next ring junction (Position 5's origin) moves into this now-vacant spot.\n*   **5 = H**: This position is at the junction of Rings D and E. This carbon originally bears a methyl group that shifts away during the cascade (to Position 4). It is then replaced by a hydrogen atom migrating from an adjacent carbon to stabilize the forming carbocation before the final elimination step.\n\nTherefore, the substituents at the indicated positions are as follows:\n\n1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H.\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
