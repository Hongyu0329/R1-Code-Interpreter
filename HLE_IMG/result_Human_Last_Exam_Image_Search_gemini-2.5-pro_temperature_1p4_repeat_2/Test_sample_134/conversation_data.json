    "The molecule shown in the image is **cyclocarbon**.\n\nThis molecule is a recently synthesized allotrope of carbon with the chemical formula C₁₈. It consists of a ring of 18 carbon atoms. For a long time, there was a debate about its exact structure. However, in 2019, researchers from IBM and the University of Oxford successfully synthesized and imaged the molecule, resolving its structure.\n\nUsing high-resolution atomic force microscopy, they determined that cyclocarbon has a polyynic structure, which means it consists of alternating single and triple chemical bonds. The synthesis was a significant achievement as this form of carbon is highly reactive and could not be isolated and characterized before. The process involved generating the molecule on an inert sodium chloride surface at very low temperatures (5 Kelvin) by removing carbon monoxide groups from a precursor molecule (C₂₄O₆) using voltage pulses from the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope. Computational studies have confirmed that this polyynic structure is the most stable form.\n\n<<<cyclocarbon>>>"
