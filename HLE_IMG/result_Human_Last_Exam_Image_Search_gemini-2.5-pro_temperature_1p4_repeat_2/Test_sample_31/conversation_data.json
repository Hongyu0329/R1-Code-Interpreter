    "The knot in the picture is identified as the prime knot 9₄₂. The Rasmussen invariant, often denoted as s(K), is a modern integer invariant of a knot K.\n\nThe Rasmussen s-invariant for the knot 9₄₂ is 0.\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant is derived from the Khovanov homology of a knot and provides a lower bound for the slice genus. For alternating knots, the Rasmussen invariant is equal to the knot's signature. However, the 9₄₂ knot is non-alternating, and while its signature is 2, its Rasmussen invariant is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
