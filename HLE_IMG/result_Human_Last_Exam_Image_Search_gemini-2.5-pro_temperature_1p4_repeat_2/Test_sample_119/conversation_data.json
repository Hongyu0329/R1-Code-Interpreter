    "To determine the IUPAC name of the compound, we will analyze the provided spectroscopic data step-by-step.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)\nThe mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M⁺) at **m/z = 135**. The odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule (the Nitrogen Rule).\n\n### 2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy\nThe IR spectrum displays several key absorption bands:\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹**: Two peaks are visible, which is characteristic of the N-H stretching of a primary amine (-NH₂).\n*   **~3030 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C-H stretching.\n*   **~2850-2950 cm⁻¹**: Aliphatic C-H stretching.\n*   **~1600 and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C ring stretching.\n*   **~700 and 750 cm⁻¹**: Bending vibrations characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n\nThis suggests the compound is a primary amine containing a monosubstituted phenyl group and an aliphatic portion.\n\n### 3. ¹³C NMR Spectroscopy\nThe spectrum shows 7 distinct carbon signals:\n*   **Aromatic region**: Four signals at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm. This is consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring, which has four types of chemically equivalent carbons (1 ipso-, 2 ortho-, 2 meta-, 1 para-carbon).\n*   **Aliphatic region**: Three signals at δ 49.6, 43.5, and 19.2 ppm.\n\nThe **DEPT-135** data is crucial:\n*   **One negative signal**: Indicates one -CH₂- (methylene) group.\n*   **Five positive signals**: Indicate five -CH- (methine) or -CH₃ (methyl) groups. These correspond to the three aliphatic signals and two of the aromatic signals being CH or CH₃ (the aromatic CHs in this case), plus one aliphatic CH and one CH₃. The signal at δ 145.1 ppm does not appear in the DEPT-135 spectrum, confirming it is a quaternary carbon (the ipso-carbon of the benzene ring).\n\nCombining these, we have:\n*   **δ 43.5 ppm**: A CH₂ group.\n*   **δ 19.2 ppm**: A CH₃ group.\n*   **δ 49.6 ppm**: A CH group.\n\n### 4. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy\nThe proton NMR shows four main signal regions:\n*   **~7.2 ppm (multiplet, ~5H)**: Protons on a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n*   **~2.8 ppm (multiplet, ~2H)**: Aliphatic protons, consistent with a -CH₂- group.\n*   **~2.7 ppm (multiplet, ~1H)**: An aliphatic proton, consistent with a -CH- group.\n*   **~1.2 ppm (triplet, ~3H)**: Aliphatic protons, consistent with a -CH₃ group.\n\nThe splitting pattern provides the connectivity:\n*   The **triplet** at ~1.2 ppm (3H) indicates the -CH₃ group is adjacent to a -CH₂- group. This establishes an **ethyl fragment (-CH₂-CH₃)**.\n\n### 5. HSQC Spectroscopy\nThe Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) spectrum correlates protons with their directly attached carbons:\n*   The aromatic protons (~7.2 ppm) correlate with the aromatic carbons (~126-129 ppm).\n*   The proton signal at **~2.8 ppm (CH₂) correlates with the carbon at δ 43.5 ppm**.\n*   The proton signal at **~2.7 ppm (CH) correlates with the carbon at δ 49.6 ppm**.\n*   The proton signal at **~1.2 ppm (CH₃) correlates with the carbon at δ 19.2 ppm**.\n\n### 6. Structure Elucidation\n1.  From the MS and IR data, we deduce a molecular formula of **C₉H₁₃N** (calculated mass: 135.21 g/mol) containing a primary amine.\n2.  The degree of unsaturation for C₉H₁₃N is 4, which corresponds perfectly to a benzene ring.\n3.  The NMR data confirm a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-) and an aliphatic side chain with the formula C₃H₈N.\n4.  The side chain contains a -CH-, a -CH₂-, a -CH₃, and an -NH₂ group.\n5.  The ¹H NMR splitting pattern reveals an ethyl fragment (-CH₂CH₃).\n6.  The remaining fragments are the phenyl group (C₆H₅-), a methine group (-CH-), and the amine group (-NH₂).\n7.  The only possible way to assemble these fragments is to attach the phenyl group, the amine group, and the ethyl group to the methine carbon.\n\nThe resulting structure is: **C₆H₅-CH(NH₂)-CH₂-CH₃**\n\n### IUPAC Name\nThe structure is a propane chain with a phenyl group and an amino group both at position 1. Therefore, the IUPAC name is **1-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
