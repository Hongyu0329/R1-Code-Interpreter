    "This is the first movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 14, Op. 27, No. 2, famously known as the \"Moonlight Sonata.\"\n\nThe piece is one of the most recognizable in classical music, characterized by its somber and mysterious mood. Key features visible in the sheet music that identify it are:\n*   **Key Signature:** It is written in C-sharp minor.\n*   **Opening Figure:** The continuous triplet arpeggios in the right hand create a distinctive, rolling accompaniment.\n*   **Form:** This movement is in a truncated sonata form and is marked to be played *pianissimo* (very quietly).\n\nThe popular name \"Moonlight Sonata\" was given to the piece by the German music critic Ludwig Rellstab years after Beethoven's death. He remarked that the music reminded him of moonlight shining upon Lake Lucerne.\n\n<<<Beethoven - Moonlight Sonata (1st Movement)>>>"
