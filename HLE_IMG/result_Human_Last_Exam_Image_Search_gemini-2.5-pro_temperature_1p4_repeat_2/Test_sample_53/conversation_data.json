    "The figure leaving the chariot is the goddess Aphrodite.\n\nThis specific red-figured pelike, an ancient Greek jar, is attributed to the Meidias Painter and dates to around 410 B.C. The scene depicted shows the goddess of love, Aphrodite, departing. She is seated in a chariot being driven by a winged Eros (in some interpretations, the driver is the personification of desire, Himeros, while another winged Eros flies above).\n\nThe figure falling to the ground is not being pushed out, but rather represents a vanquished lover or a mythological episode where Aphrodite moves on from a romantic entanglement. While the exact identity of the fallen man is debated among scholars, the primary figure leaving the scene in the chariot is conclusively identified as Aphrodite.<<<The figure leaving the chariot is Aphrodite.>>>"
