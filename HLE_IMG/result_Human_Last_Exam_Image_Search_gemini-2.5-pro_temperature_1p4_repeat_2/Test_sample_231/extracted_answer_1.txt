This is a simplified representation. To be more precise, based on the structure of A:
Compound C is 1-(diethylamino)-3,6,8,10,12-pentahydroxydibenzo[c,h]xanthenylium (assuming substitution at position 1 and subsequent demethylation of all other methoxy groups).

Here is the chemical structure of compound C:
