    "The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image fragment is identified as **Sö 179**, also known as the Gripsholm Runestone.\n\nThis identification is based on the visible runic text and the style of the carving. The legible runes in the image fragment match a section of the inscription on Sö 179. The full inscription on the stone was raised by a woman named Tóla in memory of her son Harald, who was the brother of the famous Viking leader Ingvar the Far-Travelled.\n\nThe Gripsholm Runestone is one of about 26 \"Ingvar runestones\" erected to commemorate those who died during Ingvar's ill-fated expedition to Serkland (the Saracen lands) between 1036 and 1041. The text on this particular stone recounts that Harald and his companions \"travelled valiantly far for gold, and in the east gave (food) to the eagle,\" a poetic way of saying they killed their enemies in battle. It concludes by stating they \"died in the south in Serkland.\"\n\nDiscovered in the early 1820s being used as a threshold in Gripsholm Castle, the stone is now located beside the castle drive. The carving is considered to be in the Fp runestone style and is noted for being somewhat sloppily executed.\n\n<<<Sö 179>>>"
