    "The insect depicted in the center of the image is the Small Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name is *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\nThis species is characterized by its distinct orange or red and black markings, which include an \"X\" shape on its back. The head is typically black with a red spot in the center. Adults of this species are about 10 to 12 millimeters long.\n\nWhile its name suggests a diet limited to milkweed, the Small Milkweed Bug is known to feed on a variety of plants, including the seeds of composites like the goldenrod shown in the image. They are found across North America.\n\nAnother insect often found on goldenrod is the Goldenrod Soldier Beetle (*Chauliognathus pensylvanicus*), but it has a different body shape and markings, typically with black oval accents on orange forewings. The bug in the image is identifiable as the Small Milkweed Bug due to the specific red 'X' pattern and head marking.\n\n<<<*Lygaeus kalmii*>>>"
