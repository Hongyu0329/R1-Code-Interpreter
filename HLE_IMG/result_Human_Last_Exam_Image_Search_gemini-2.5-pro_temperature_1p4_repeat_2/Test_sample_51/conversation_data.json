    "The word in the manuscript is **μθᾶλλον**.\n\nThis appears to be a scribal error for the common Ancient Greek adverb **μᾶλλον** (mâllon).\n\n*   **Transcription:** The letters in the image are clearly identifiable as Mu (μ), Theta (θ), Alpha (α), Lambda (λ), Lambda (λ), Omicron (ο), and Nu (ν).\n*   **Accent:** The mark above the alpha is a circumflex (περισπωμένη), which is appropriate for the word *μᾶλλον*.\n*   **Meaning:** The intended word, *μᾶλλον*, is a comparative adverb meaning \"more\" or \"rather\". It is formed from the adverb μάλα (mála), meaning \"very\".\n*   **Scribal Error:** The presence of the theta (θ) instead of an alpha (α) is almost certainly a mistake by the person who copied the text. The word \"μθᾶλλον\" does not exist in Ancient Greek. Such errors are not uncommon in the transcription of manuscripts from the Byzantine period.\n\nTherefore, while the text literally says \"μθᾶλλον,\" it is a form of the common word \"μᾶλλον\" altered by a copying mistake.\n\n<<<μθᾶλλον>>>"
