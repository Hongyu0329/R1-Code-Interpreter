    "The main difference in the sporophyte that helps distinguish *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the seta. In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight, holding the capsule erect, while in *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is distinctly curved or arcuate.\n\nTo elaborate:\n\n*   ***Grimmia montana*** has capsules that are exserted (protruding beyond the leaves) on a **straight seta**. The capsules are typically ovoid and brown.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta*** is characterized by its capsule being borne on an **arcuate (curved) seta**, a feature reflected in its name \"*curviseta*\".\n\nThis difference in the straight versus curved nature of the seta provides a clear visual cue for distinguishing between the sporophytes of these two moss species.\n\n<<<The main distinguishing feature of the sporophyte is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a curved (arcuate) seta.>>>"
