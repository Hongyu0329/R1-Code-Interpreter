    "Here are the identities of the four specimens, ordered by increasing silicate structure complexity.\n\n*   **Specimen C: Olivine**\n    This specimen is a granular aggregate of olive-green crystals, which is characteristic of olivine. Olivine is a nesosilicate, meaning its structure consists of isolated silica tetrahedra (SiOâ‚„) bonded by ions like iron and magnesium. This represents the simplest silicate structure.\n\n*   **Specimen A: Pyroxene (likely Augite)**\n    This is a dark, stubby, prismatic crystal. This crystal habit is common for pyroxenes like augite. Pyroxenes are inosilicates with a single-chain structure, where silica tetrahedra link together by sharing two oxygen atoms to form long chains. This structure is more complex than the isolated tetrahedra of olivine.\n\n*   **Specimen B: Mica or Chlorite**\n    This mineral displays a flaky, sheet-like appearance, a key feature of phyllosilicates. The green color suggests it is likely a mica-group mineral like biotite or a related sheet silicate like chlorite. Phyllosilicates, or sheet silicates, have a structure where tetrahedra share three of their four oxygen atoms, forming extensive two-dimensional sheets. This sheet structure is more complex than the single chains of pyroxenes.\n\n*   **Specimen D: Quartz (Smoky variety)**\n    This translucent, brownish-gray crystal with a glassy luster is identifiable as smoky quartz. Quartz is a tectosilicate, or framework silicate. In this structure, every silica tetrahedron shares all four of its oxygen atoms with neighboring tetrahedra, creating a strong, three-dimensional framework. This is the most complex and polymerized type of silicate structure.\n\n### Order of Increasing Silicate Structure Complexity:\n\n1.  **C (Olivine):** Nesosilicate (Isolated tetrahedra)\n2.  **A (Pyroxene):** Inosilicate (Single chains)\n3.  **B (Mica/Chlorite):** Phyllosilicate (Sheets)\n4.  **D (Quartz):** Tectosilicate (Framework)\n\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
