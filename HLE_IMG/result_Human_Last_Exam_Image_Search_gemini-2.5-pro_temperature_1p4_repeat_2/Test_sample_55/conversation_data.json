    "An accurate Roman numeral for the circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor (K. 397) is **V4/3**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the analysis:\n*   **Key:** The piece is in D minor.\n*   **Notes:** The circled chord, on the second beat of measure 8, contains the notes E in the bass (left hand), and G, A, and C-sharp in the upper voices (left and right hands).\n*   **Chord Identification:** These notes—A, C-sharp, E, and G—form an A dominant seventh chord (A7). In the key of D minor, the A major chord is the dominant (V), making A7 the dominant seventh chord (V7).\n*   **Inversion:** Since the E (the fifth of the chord) is the lowest note, the chord is in its second inversion. The figured bass symbol for a second-inversion seventh chord is 4/3.\n*   **Function:** This V4/3 chord resolves to a i6 chord (D minor in first inversion) on the next beat, a common and smooth harmonic progression in classical music.\n\nTherefore, the complete and accurate Roman numeral for the specified chord is V4/3.\n<<<V4/3>>>"
