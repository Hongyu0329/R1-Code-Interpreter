    "Here is the breakdown of the biological sexes for each pair of insects:\n\n**A: Female, Male (4)**\nThe insects are *Coelioxys*, or cuckoo bees. The individual on the left has a sharply pointed, conical abdomen, which is characteristic of females and is used to pierce the nests of host bees to lay eggs. The individual on the right has an abdomen tipped with multiple spines or prongs, which is a feature of males.\n\n**B: Female, Male (4)**\nThese are *Polistes*, or paper wasps. A key feature for telling the sexes apart is the antennae. The individual on the right has antennae that are distinctly curled at the tips, a classic trait of male paper wasps. The individual on the left has straighter antennae, typical of a female. Additionally, the abdomen of the female on the left tapers to a point, while the male's abdomen has a blunter tip.\n\n**C: Male, Female (3)**\nThese are long-horned bees, likely from the genus *Melissodes*. The most telling feature is the length of the antennae. The bee on the left has extremely long antennae, a defining characteristic of males in this group, which gives them their common name. The bee on the right has much shorter antennae, typical of a female. While the male on the left has very hairy legs, males lack the dense pollen-collecting hairs (scopae) that females possess.\n\n4, 4, 3\n<<<4, 4, 3>>>"
