    "The artist of the painting is the Polish surrealist painter Jacek Yerka. The painting is often referred to as \"Second Day of Creation\" or is part of his \"Creation\" series.\n\nThe artwork is a prime example of Yerka's imaginative and surreal style, blending fantastical elements into a seemingly coherent yet impossible scene. The room depicts several impossible scenarios simultaneously: a glacial landscape outside one opening, the sea flowing in through a doorway, and books burning in a fireplace while a young woman calmly reads amongst them. These elements are characteristic of the artist's dreamlike and symbolic paintings.\n\n<<<Jacek Yerka>>>"
