    "Based on a thorough analysis of the provided images and supporting information from search results, the rock specimens can be identified as follows:\n\n**H: Scoria**\nThis specimen is a reddish-brown, highly vesicular (holey) rock. Its color indicates a composition that is likely basaltic or andesitic. Scoria is formed when gas-rich lava is ejected from a volcano and cools rapidly, trapping gas bubbles within the rock. The reddish color is often due to the oxidation of iron during the eruption. It is denser than pumice and has thicker walls between its vesicles.\n\n**I: Conglomerate**\nThis rock is composed of numerous rounded to sub-rounded pebbles and smaller fragments cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This texture is characteristic of a clastic sedimentary rock known as a conglomerate. The rounding of the clasts (fragments) suggests they were transported by water, such as in a river or on a beach, which smoothed their edges before they were cemented together.\n\n**J: Pumice**\nSpecimen J is a light-colored, fine-grained, and highly vesicular rock. This appearance is characteristic of pumice, a type of volcanic glass that forms from gas-rich, frothy lava that cools very quickly. Its light color, typically white to light-gray, suggests a felsic (rhyolitic) composition. Due to its high porosity from numerous trapped gas bubbles, pumice is very lightweight and can often float on water.\n\n**K: Pegmatite**\nThis specimen displays large, interlocking crystals of various minerals, indicating a coarse-grained texture. This texture is a hallmark of pegmatite, an intrusive igneous rock that forms from the slow crystallization of magma, often during the final stages. Pegmatites are known for their exceptionally large crystals, typically larger than 2.5 cm. While often granitic in composition (containing quartz, feldspar, and mica), the defining characteristic is the very coarse grain size.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Conglomerate, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
