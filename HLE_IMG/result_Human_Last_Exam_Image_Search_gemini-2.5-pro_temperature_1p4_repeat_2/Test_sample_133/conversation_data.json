    "Here is the step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to identify the unknown compound:\n\n1.  **Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak:** The group of peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) corresponds to the molecular ion. In the provided spectrum, this cluster is seen starting at m/z 258, with significant peaks at m/z 260 (relative intensity 34.8%), 262 (29.0%), and 264 (12.9%). This characteristic pattern, with multiple peaks separated by 2 Da, is indicative of a compound containing multiple chlorine or bromine atoms. The pattern with significant M+, M+2, and M+4 peaks strongly suggests the presence of three chlorine atoms (³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl isotopes). Assuming the peak at m/z 260 represents the molecule with the most common isotopes (¹²C, ¹H, ³⁵Cl), the molecular weight of the compound is 260 Da.\n\n2.  **Base Peak:** The base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum, which is assigned a relative intensity of 100%. According to the table, the base peak is at **m/z 225**.\n\n3.  **Fragmentation Analysis:**\n    *   The difference between the proposed molecular ion (m/z 260) and the base peak (m/z 225) is 35 Da (260 - 225 = 35). This mass corresponds to the loss of a chlorine radical (•Cl), a very common fragmentation pathway for chlorinated compounds.\n    *   The fragment at m/z 225 ([M-Cl]⁺) is the base peak, indicating it is a very stable cation. Its isotope pattern (m/z 225: 100%, m/z 227: 66.7%) shows a ratio of approximately 3:2, which is characteristic for a fragment containing two chlorine atoms.\n    *   Another significant peak is found at m/z 190. The mass difference between m/z 225 and m/z 190 is 35 Da (225 - 190 = 35), corresponding to the loss of a second chlorine atom. The isotope pattern at m/z 190 (48.4%) and m/z 192 (24.5%) has a ratio of approximately 2:1, which is close to the 3:1 ratio expected for a fragment with one chlorine atom.\n    *   A further peak at m/z 155 corresponds to the loss of the third chlorine atom from the m/z 190 fragment (190 - 35 = 155). This peak has no chlorine atoms.\n\n4.  **Determination of the Chemical Formula:**\n    The analysis reveals a clear sequential loss of three chlorine atoms.\n    *   M⁺: [CₓHᵧZₙCl₃]⁺• at m/z 260\n    *   Base Peak: [CₓHᵧZₙCl₂]⁺ at m/z 225\n    *   Fragment: [CₓHᵧZₙCl]⁺ at m/z 190\n    *   Fragment: [CₓHᵧZₙ]⁺ at m/z 155\n\n    The mass of the non-chlorine part of the molecule (CₓHᵧZₙ) is 155 Da. According to the nitrogen rule, a molecule with an even nominal molecular weight (260 Da) must contain an even number of nitrogen atoms (or zero). Let's determine the composition of the mass 155 fragment:\n    *   If it contained only carbon and hydrogen, a mass of 155 would correspond to C₁₂H₁₁, but this combination of an even number of carbons with an odd number of hydrogens violates the rules of valency for a stable neutral molecule containing only C, H, and halogens.\n    *   If we consider the presence of nitrogen, the formula **C₁₁H₉N** has a mass of (11 × 12) + (9 × 1) + 14 = 155 Da.\n\n    This leads to a molecular formula for the original compound of **C₁₁H₉Cl₃N**.\n\n5.  **Identification of the Compound and IUPAC Name:**\n    The molecular formula C₁₁H₉Cl₃N and the fragmentation pattern strongly suggest the compound is the pesticide **Fenuron-trichloroacetate** or a closely related isomer. However, based on common pesticides and industrial chemicals, a highly plausible structure is that of a trichlorinated N-phenylpyrrole. One such compound is **1-phenyl-2,3,4-trichloro-1H-pyrrole**.\n\nTherefore, based on the detailed analysis of the provided electron ionization mass spectrum, the compound is identified as having the formula C₁₁H₉Cl₃N. A plausible IUPAC name is:\n\n**1-phenyl-2,3,4-trichloro-1H-pyrrole**\n\n<<<1-phenyl-2,3,4-trichloro-1H-pyrrole>>>"
