    "Based on a detailed analysis of the provided molecular structures and a review of relevant scientific literature, the complexes with shorter operational lifetimes are those prone to faster degradation. The stability of these iridium complexes in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) is influenced by several factors, including whether the cyclometalating ligands are identical (homoleptic) or different (heteroleptic), and the presence of fluorine substituents.\n\n### Analysis of the Complexes\n\nFirst, let's identify the composition of each complex based on the images:\n*   **Complex 1:** This is a **homoleptic** complex with two identical cyclometalating ligands: 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (`dfppy`). Its formula is `[Ir(dfppy)₂(dtbbpy)]⁺`.\n*   **Complex 2:** This is a **heteroleptic** complex with two different cyclometalating ligands: one unsubstituted 2-phenylpyridine (`ppy`) and one 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (`dfppy`). Its formula is `[Ir(ppy)(dfppy)(dtbbpy)]⁺`.\n*   **Complex 3:** This is a **homoleptic** complex with two unsubstituted 2-phenylpyridine (`ppy`) ligands. Its formula is `[Ir(ppy)₂(dtbbpy)]⁺`.\n*   **Complex 4:** A close inspection reveals this is also a **homoleptic** complex, with both cyclometalating ligands being 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine (`2fppy`). Its formula is `[Ir(2fppy)₂(dtbbpy)]⁺`.\n\nThus, we have three homoleptic complexes (1, 3, and 4) and one heteroleptic complex (2).\n\n### Stability and Lifetime Considerations\n\nSeveral factors determine the operational lifetime of these emitters in LECs:\n\n1.  **Ligand Scrambling in Heteroleptic Complexes:** Heteroleptic complexes can be susceptible to ligand redistribution or \"scrambling\" during device operation. This process creates a mixture of the initial heteroleptic complex and its corresponding homoleptic parent complexes, leading to changes in emission color and a general decrease in device stability and lifetime. This suggests that heteroleptic complexes might be less stable.\n\n2.  **Bond Strength and Fluorination:** Fluorination of the phenylpyridine ligands generally increases the strength of the Iridium-Carbon bond. This is due to the electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine, which lowers the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) that has significant metal-ligand character. A stronger bond typically leads to greater molecular stability and resistance to degradation. However, some studies have noted that increasing the fluorine content can sometimes decrease the stability of green-emitting LECs, indicating the relationship is not always straightforward.\n\n3.  **Non-Radiative Decay Pathways:** Degradation is often linked to non-radiative decay from triplet metal-centered (³MC) excited states, which can be destructive to the ligand framework. Structural features that prevent the population of these states, or that make the molecule more rigid, can enhance stability. Some studies suggest that intramolecular π-stacking can reduce degradation, but overly distorted geometries can facilitate it.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nConsidering these points, we can predict the relative stabilities:\n\n*   **Heteroleptic vs. Homoleptic:** The heteroleptic nature of **Complex 2** makes it potentially vulnerable to ligand scrambling, which is a known degradation pathway that can shorten device lifetime. In contrast, the homoleptic complexes (1, 3, and 4) are inherently stable against this specific degradation mechanism. While some specific heteroleptic complexes can be engineered for high stability, the risk of ligand redistribution generally points towards a shorter lifetime for heteroleptic systems compared to their well-designed homoleptic counterparts.\n\n*   **Effect of Fluorination:** Comparing the homoleptic complexes, fluorination (as in Complex 1 and 4) generally enhances the Ir-C bond strength compared to the non-fluorinated Complex 3. This would suggest that Complex 3 might be less stable than Complex 1 and 4. However, some reports indicate that fluorination can also open up other degradation pathways.\n\nGiven the clear structural distinction between heteroleptic and homoleptic complexes and the well-established degradation pathway of ligand scrambling for the former, **Complex 2** stands out as the most likely to exhibit a shorter lifetime. Among the homoleptic complexes, a definitive ranking without specific experimental data for this exact set is difficult, but the potential for degradation via ligand scrambling in Complex 2 is a significant factor. However, it's important to note that specific ligand combinations can defy general trends; for instance, some research has shown particular heteroleptic complexes to be very stable. Without such specific evidence for Complex 2, relying on the general principle of instability from ligand scrambling is the most logical approach. The question asks which are *expected* to show shorter lifetimes, implying a reliance on general principles.\n\nBased on the principle that heteroleptic complexes are prone to degradation via ligand scrambling, Complex 2 is expected to have a shorter lifetime.\n\n<<<B>>>"
