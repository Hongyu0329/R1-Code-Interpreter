    "The species that definitively indicates this photo was taken on the Atlantic rather than the Pacific Coast is the Common Periwinkle, scientifically named *Littorina littorea*.\n\nThe image displays a typical North Atlantic rocky intertidal community. Several species visible are exclusive to the Atlantic Ocean in North America. The most identifiable of these is the Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*), visible as the larger snail with the faintly striped, brownish shell. This species is native to Europe and was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the mid-19th century. It is now widespread and abundant from Labrador, Canada, down to New Jersey or Delaware in the United States.\n\nCrucially, while there have been isolated reports of *Littorina littorea* on the Pacific Coast, it has failed to establish sustained populations there. Its established and abundant presence, as suggested by the photo, is a hallmark of the Atlantic coast.\n\nOther organisms in the photograph support this conclusion:\n*   **Barnacles**: These appear to be the Northern Rock Barnacle, *Semibalanus balanoides*. This is the most common intertidal barnacle on the north-east coast of North America and is not found on the Pacific coast.\n*   **Dog Whelks**: The other whitish snail could be an Atlantic Dog Whelk, *Nucella lapillus*. This carnivorous snail is found on the rocky shores of the North Atlantic and is not native to the Pacific.\n\nThe collective presence of these species, particularly the easily identified *Littorina littorea*, strongly confirms the photograph's origin as the Atlantic Coast.\n\n<<<*Littorina littorea*>>>"
