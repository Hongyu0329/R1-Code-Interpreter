    "Based on a visual analysis of the image and supporting search results, the protein depicted is a component of the **human TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)**.\n\nSpecifically, the image corresponds to the crystallographic structure of the **N-terminal disease-associated fragment of human TDP-43**. This particular structure is cataloged in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) under the accession code **6X2L**.\n\nTDP-43 is a protein that, in humans, is encoded by the *TARDBP* gene and is implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). The protein is composed of several domains, including an N-terminal domain and two RNA recognition motifs (RRM1 and RRM2). Under normal conditions, TDP-43 is found mostly in the nucleus and is involved in processes like gene expression and RNA metabolism.\n\nIn disease states, TDP-43 can be cleaved, and its fragments can form aggregates in the cytoplasm of neurons. The image shows the structure of one such fragment originating from the N-terminal part of the protein.\n\n<<<Human TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)>>>"
