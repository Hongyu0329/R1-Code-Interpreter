    "The spectral lines in the image belong to the element **Uranium (U)**.\n\nThe image displays a complex emission spectrum with a multitude of fine lines across the entire visible range, from blue to red. This high density of spectral lines is characteristic of heavy elements with complex electron shell structures.\n\nUpon comparing the provided spectrum with known emission spectra of various elements, a clear match is found with the emission spectrum of Uranium. Uranium's spectrum is known for its vast number of emission lines, which create a dense and detailed pattern like the one shown in the image. Key features visible in the image that align with Uranium's spectrum include the dense clusters of lines in the blue-green and yellow-orange regions, as well as the numerous fainter lines distributed throughout the spectrum.\n\n<<<Uranium>>>"
