    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip, we must first understand the recording parameters. The strip is recorded at a standard speed of 25 mm/sec. This means:\n*   Each small square (1 mm) on the horizontal axis represents 0.04 seconds.\n*   Each large square (5 mm) on the horizontal axis represents 0.2 seconds.\n\nUpon visual inspection of the entire rhythm strip, a significant pause is evident in the fourth row. To find the longest R-R interval, we measure the distance between the two consecutive R-wave peaks that define this pause.\n\nBy counting the grid squares between the peak of the R-wave preceding the pause and the peak of the R-wave ending the pause, we can see that they are separated by 8 large squares.\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n8 large squares Ã— 0.2 seconds/large square = 1.6 seconds.\n\nThe other R-R intervals on the strip are significantly shorter, making this the longest one.\n\n<<<1.6>>>"
