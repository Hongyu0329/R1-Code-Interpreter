    "The knot depicted in the image is identified as the 10_132 knot in the Alexander-Briggs notation.\n\nThe Jones polynomial for the 10_132 knot is given as q⁻² + q⁻⁴ - q⁻⁵ + q⁻⁶ - q⁻⁷. Interestingly, the 10_132 knot shares the same Jones polynomial with the 5_1 knot, which is the cinquefoil knot.\n\nTo express the polynomial with the variable *t* and in decreasing degree order, we replace *q* with *t*:\n\nt⁻² + t⁻⁴ - t⁻⁵ + t⁻⁶ - t⁻⁷\n\nArranging the terms in decreasing degree of the exponent gives:\n\nt⁻² + t⁻⁴ - t⁻⁵ + t⁻⁶ - t⁻⁷\n\n<<<t^-2 + t^-4 - t^-5 + t^-6 - t^-7>>>"
