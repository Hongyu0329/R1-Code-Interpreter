    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will follow these steps:\n1.  First, we need to identify the main carbon chain and number the carbons according to IUPAC nomenclature rules. The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH), which should be on the main chain and given the lowest possible number. The longest carbon chain containing the C-OH carbon is a pentane chain. By applying the rules for selecting the main chain (highest number of substituents, lowest locant numbers), the correct IUPAC name is **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**. This numbering identifies the three chiral centers at carbons C2, C3, and C4.\n2.  Next, for each chiral center, we will assign priorities to the four attached groups based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n3.  Then, we will analyze the 3D stereochemistry shown in the drawing (using wedges and dashes) to determine the spatial arrangement of these groups.\n4.  Finally, we will determine the R/S configuration for each chiral center and combine them to state the full absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\nThe following Python code outlines this process and prints the result.\n\n```python\ndef determine_absolute_configuration():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the absolute configuration (R/S) of the three chiral centers\n    in the provided molecule by following IUPAC and CIP rules.\n\n    The plan is as follows:\n    1.  Determine the IUPAC name of the molecule to correctly number the carbon chain and identify the chiral centers.\n    2.  For each chiral center (C2, C3, C4), assign priorities to the four attached groups based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n    3.  Analyze the 3D representation (wedges and dashes) for each chiral center to determine the spatial arrangement of the groups.\n    4.  Determine the R/S configuration for each center.\n    5.  Combine the results to give the full absolute configuration of the molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: IUPAC Naming and Identification of Chiral Centers\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The principal functional group is the alcohol (-OH).\")\n    print(\"The longest carbon chain containing the C-OH carbon is a 5-carbon chain (pentane).\")\n    print(\"Following IUPAC rules, the correct name is 5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol.\")\n    print(\"This numbering identifies the chiral centers at carbons C2, C3, and C4.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Configuration at Chiral Center C2\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Substituents at C2: -OH, -C3(chain), -CH3, -H\")\n    print(\"Priorities (CIP rules):\")\n    print(\"1: -OH\")\n    print(\"2: -C3(chain)\")\n    print(\"3: -CH3\")\n    print(\"4: -H\")\n    print(\"Analysis of drawing:\")\n    print(\"The drawing shows both -OH (priority 1) and -CH3 (priority 3) as dashed.
