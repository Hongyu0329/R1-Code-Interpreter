def determine_absolute_configuration():
    """
    This script determines the absolute configuration (R/S) of the three chiral centers
    in the provided molecule by following IUPAC and CIP rules.

    The plan is as follows:
    1.  Determine the IUPAC name of the molecule to correctly number the carbon chain and identify the chiral centers.
    2.  For each chiral center (C2, C3, C4), assign priorities to the four attached groups based on the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.
    3.  Analyze the 3D representation (wedges and dashes) for each chiral center to determine the spatial arrangement of the groups.
    4.  Determine the R/S configuration for each center.
    5.  Combine the results to give the full absolute configuration of the molecule.
