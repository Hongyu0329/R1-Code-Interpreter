    This function determines the plausible geological events for the transition from Rock A to Rock B.

    The transition from Rock A (deep-water shale) to Rock B (shallower-water sediment)
    represents a marine regression (sea-level fall). We evaluate the options:
    i. Onset of glaciation: Causes eustatic sea-level fall (regression). Plausible.
    ii. Coastal subsidence: Causes relative sea-level rise (transgression). Not plausible.
    iii. Global warming: Causes eustatic sea-level rise (transgression). Not plausible.
    iv. Decreased Mid-Ocean Ridge Activity: Causes eustatic sea-level fall (regression). Plausible.

    The correct options are i and iv.
