# The problem is solved by interpreting the geometric information to derive a formula for the height 'h'.
# The derivation involves unrolling the cylinder and using trigonometry.
# The final relationship found is h = r * (pi - 2*theta) * tan(theta), where theta is in radians.
# This script will print the final formula as a string.

# The formula contains the number 2.
# The variables are r and theta.
# The constant is pi.
# The function is tan.

final_equation = "h = r * (pi - 2 * theta) * tan(theta)"
