    """
    This script calculates the number-average degree of polymerization (Nn)
    for the missing simulation plot.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. There are 2 polymer types (linear, ladder) and 5 degradation levels (m=1 to 5),
       for a total of 10 possible plots. Since 9 are shown, one is missing.
    2. By analyzing the distribution shapes, we identify 4 plots for linear polymers
       and 5 for ladder polymers. The missing plot is for a linear polymer.
    3. The formula for Nn for linear polymers is Nn = N / (1 + (N-1)*a), where N is
       the initial chain length and 'a' is the degree of destruction.
    4. From the plots, N=20. The degradation is a = m/25.
    5. By calculating theoretical Nn for m=1,2,3,4,5 and comparing with the plots,
       we find that the plot for m=3 is the one that is missing.
    6. This script calculates Nn for N=20 and m=3.
