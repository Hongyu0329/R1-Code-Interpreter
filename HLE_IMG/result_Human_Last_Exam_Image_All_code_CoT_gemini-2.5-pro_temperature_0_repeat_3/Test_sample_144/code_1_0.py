def solve_mimicry_puzzle():
    """
    This function solves the insect mimicry puzzle.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Identify the three mimic insects and the three damage-causing insects.
       - Mimics: A (beetle mimicking a leaf mine), C (moth mimicking a skeletonized leaf), E (leaf insect mimicking a chewed leaf).
       - Damage-Causers: B (larva that creates leaf mines), D (beetle that skeletonizes leaves), F (grasshopper that chews leaves).

    2. Match each mimic to the insect whose damage it imitates.
       - The beetle in A mimics the linear damage caused by the larva in B. Match: A -> B.
       - The moth in C mimics the skeletonized damage caused by the beetle in D. Match: C -> D.
       - The leaf insect in E mimics the chewed-leaf damage caused by the grasshopper in F. Match: E -> F.
