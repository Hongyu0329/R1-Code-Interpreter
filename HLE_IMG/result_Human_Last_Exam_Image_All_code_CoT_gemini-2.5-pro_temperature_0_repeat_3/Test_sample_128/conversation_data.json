    "This is a multi-component reaction known as a Strecker-type reaction, followed by intramolecular cyclization and dehydration. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the structure of compound A.\n\n**1. Reactant Analysis:**\n*   **2-aminopyridine:** An aromatic amine. The exocyclic amino group (-NH2) is the primary nucleophile.\n*   **o-phthalaldehyde (OPA):** A dialdehyde, containing two reactive carbonyl groups positioned ortho to each other on a benzene ring.\n*   **TMSCN (Trimethylsilyl cyanide):** In the presence of a fluoride source (KF) and water, this serves as a source for the cyanide ion (CN-) or hydrocyanic acid (HCN).\n\n**2. Reaction Mechanism:**\n*   **Step 1: Imine Formation:** The nucleophilic amino group of 2-aminopyridine attacks one of the aldehyde groups of o-phthalaldehyde. After the loss of a water molecule, an imine intermediate is formed.\n*   **Step 2: Strecker Reaction (Cyanide Addition):** The cyanide ion (from TMSCN) attacks the electrophilic carbon of the imine. This forms an α-aminonitrile intermediate. The structure is `(o-formylphenyl)-CH(CN)-NH-(pyridin-2-yl)`.\n*   **Step 3: Intramolecular Cyclization:** The secondary amine nitrogen in the α-aminonitrile intermediate attacks the remaining aldehyde group. This intramolecular reaction forms a five-membered ring, resulting in a cyclic hemiaminal: `3-cyano-2-(pyridin-2-yl)isoindolin-1-ol`.\n*   **Step 4: Dehydration:** This hemiaminal intermediate is unstable and readily dehydrates (loses a molecule of water). The elimination of water is driven by the formation of a stable, aromatic isoindole ring system.\n\n**3. Final Product (Compound A):**\nThe final product, A, is **2-(pyridin-2-yl)-2H-isoindole-3-carbonitrile**. Its chemical formula is C14H9N3.\n\nThe overall balanced chemical equation is:\nC₅H₆N₂ (2-aminopyridine) + C₈H₆O₂ (o-phthalaldehyde) + HCN (from TMSCN) → C₁₄H₉N₃ (Compound A) + 2 H₂O\n\nThe following Python code verifies the atom balance for this reaction and prints the formula of the final product, A.\n\n```python\ndef get_atom_counts(formula):\n    \"\"\"Parses a chemical formula string into a dictionary of atom counts.\"\"\"\n    import re\n    # Regex to find elements and their optional counts\n    pattern = re.compile(r'([A-Z][a-z]*)(\\d*)')\n    atoms = {}\n    for element, count in pattern.findall(formula):\n        atoms[element] = atoms.get(element, 0) + int(count if count else 1)\n    return atoms\n\ndef print_balance_sheet(atoms, title):\n    \"\"\"Prints a formatted table of atom counts.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"--- {title} ---\")\n    for atom, count in sorted(atoms.items()):\n        print(f\"  {atom}: {count}\")\n    print(\"-\" * (len(title) + 8))\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the reaction and verifies the atom balance.\n    Reaction: 2-aminopyridine + o-phthalaldehyde + HCN -> Compound A + 2 H2O\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Define Molecules by their formulas ---\n    aminopyridine_formula = \"C5H6N2\"\n    opa_formula = \"C8H6O2\"\n    hcn_formula = \"C1H1N1\"\n    \n    product_A_formula = \"C14H9N3\"\n    water_formula = \"H2O\"\n\n    # --- Stoichiometry ---\n    reactants = {\n        aminopyridine_formula: 1,\n        opa_formula: 1,\n        hcn_formula: 1\n    }\n    products = {\n        product_A_formula: 1,\n        water_formula: 2\n    }\n\n    # --- Calculate total atoms on each side ---\n    reactant_atoms = {}\n    for formula, moles in reactants.items():\n        atoms = get_atom_counts(formula)\n        for atom, count in atoms.items():\n            reactant_atoms[atom] = reactant_atoms.get(atom, 0) + count * moles\n\n    product_atoms = {}\n    for formula, moles in products.items():\n        atoms = get_atom_counts(formula)\n        for atom, count in atoms.items():\n            product_atoms[atom] = product_atoms.get(atom, 0) + count * moles\n\n    # --- Print Results ---\n    print(\"Verifying the atom balance for the reaction...\")\n    print_balance_sheet(reactant_atoms, \"Reactant Atoms\")\n    print_balance_sheet(product_atoms, \"Product Atoms\")\n\n    if reactant_atoms == product_atoms:\n        print(\"\\nThe chemical equation is balanced.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nWarning: The chemical equation is NOT balanced.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe final product, Compound A, is 2-(pyridin-2-yl)-2H-isoindole-3-carbonitrile.\")\n    print(\"Its chemical formula is:\")\n    \n    # Print the final formula with each number individually as requested\n    final_formula_parsed = get_atom_counts(product_A_formula)\n    print(f\"C{final_formula_parsed['C']}H{final_formula_parsed['H']}N{final_formula_parsed['N']}\")\n\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n```\n<<<2-(pyridin-2-yl)-2H-isoindole-3-carbonitrile>>>"
