    "The task is to identify which of the four Iridium(III) complexes are expected to have shorter operational lifetimes when used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs).\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the molecular structures:** All four complexes share the same Iridium(III) metal center and the same bipyridine (`N^N`) ligand (4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine). The only difference between them is the substitution pattern on the cyclometalating phenylpyridine (`C^N`) ligands.\n2.  **Identify the key factor for stability:** The operational lifetime of such complexes is primarily determined by their chemical stability under electrical bias. A crucial factor for the stability of these cyclometalated iridium complexes is the nature and position of substituents on the phenyl ring of the `C^N` ligand.\n3.  **Apply chemical principles:** It is a well-established principle in the field of organic electronics that placing a fluorine atom at the 2'-position of the phenyl ring (i.e., ortho to the Ir-C bond) introduces a significant degradation pathway. This pathway, often involving reductive C-F bond cleavage, leads to the decomposition of the complex and thus a shorter device lifetime.\n4.  **Examine each complex:**\n    *   **Complex 1:** Has fluorine atoms at the 4' and 5' positions. It does **not** have a fluorine at the destabilizing 2' position. It is expected to be stable.\n    *   **Complex 2:** Has no fluorine substituents on the phenyl ring. It serves as a stable benchmark.\n    *   **Complex 3:** Has a fluorine atom at the 2' position. This structural feature is known to cause instability. This complex is expected to have a **shorter lifetime**.\n    *   **Complex 4:** Has two fluorine atoms, one of which is at the 2' position. The presence of this 2'-fluoro group makes it susceptible to the same degradation pathway. This complex is also expected to have a **shorter lifetime**.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the presence of the destabilizing 2'-fluoro substituent, complexes [3] and [4] are expected to exhibit shorter lifetimes.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will programmatically identify the complexes with this specific structural feature and print their numbers.\n\n```python\ndef find_unstable_complexes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies iridium complexes expected to have shorter lifetimes based on their structure.\n\n    The key factor for instability in these complexes is the presence of a fluorine atom\n    at the 2'-position of the phenylpyridine ligand (ortho to the Ir-C bond),\n    which introduces a known degradation pathway.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data representing the four complexes and whether they have the destabilizing 2'-fluoro group.\n    # True means the feature is present, leading to a shorter expected lifetime.\n    complex_data = {\n        1: {'has_destabilizing_feature': False, 'description': \"Fluorines at 4' and 5' positions\"},\n        2: {'has_destabilizing_feature': False, 'description': \"No fluorine substituents\"},\n        3: {'has_destabilizing_feature': True,  'description': \"Fluorine at 2' position\"},\n        4: {'has_destabilizing_feature': True,  'description': \"Fluorines at 2' and 4' positions\"}\n    }\n\n    unstable_complex_numbers = []\n    for complex_id, data in complex_data.items():\n        if data['has_destabilizing_feature']:\n            unstable_complex_numbers.append(complex_id)\n\n    print(\"Based on chemical principles, complexes with a fluorine atom at the 2'-position of the phenyl ring are prone to degradation and exhibit shorter lifetimes.\")\n    print(\"The complexes that possess this structural feature are:\")\n    \n    # Print each number as requested\n    output = \" and \".join([f\"Complex {num}\" for num in unstable_complex_numbers])\n    print(output)\n    \n    # To be explicit with the numbers for the final answer\n    print(\"\\nFinal identified numbers:\")\n    for num in unstable_complex_numbers:\n        print(num)\n\nfind_unstable_complexes()\n```\n<<<J>>>"
