    This function identifies the matching bird image.
    
    By analyzing the distinctive features of the target Sociable weaver, 
    such as the scalloped wing patterns and unique markings, we can find its match.

    1.  The pattern of the scalloped feathers on the back of the target bird is examined.
    2.  This pattern is compared against the patterns of the birds in images A through I.
    3.  Image E displays an identical feather pattern, including the specific alignment and subtle irregularities seen on the target bird's back and wings.
    
    Therefore, E is the correct match.
