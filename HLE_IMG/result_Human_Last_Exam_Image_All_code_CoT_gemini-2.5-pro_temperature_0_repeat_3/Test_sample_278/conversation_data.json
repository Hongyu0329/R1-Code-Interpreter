    "Based on the visual evidence in the image, I will provide a classification of the microorganism.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  **Analyze the image:** I will examine the key features of the microorganisms visible in the micrograph, including their shape, size, arrangement, and reproductive structures. I will also consider the staining characteristics.\n2.  **Identify the morphology:** Based on the visual analysis, I will describe the specific morphological forms present (e.g., yeast, hyphae, pseudohyphae).\n3.  **Classify the microorganism:** Using the morphological evidence, I will classify the microorganism into a major group (e.g., bacteria, fungus, protozoa) and suggest a likely genus.\n4.  **Generate Python code:** I will create a Python script that prints out this detailed analysis and classification as a text block.\n\n```python\ndef classify_microorganism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and classifies the microorganism from the provided microscopic image.\n    \"\"\"\n    analysis_and_classification = \"\"\"\nClassification of the Microorganism in the Image:\n\n1.  **Type of Microorganism:** Fungus.\n    The structures are eukaryotic cells, much larger than bacteria, and exhibit features characteristic of fungi.\n\n2.  **Morphology:** The image displays a dimorphic presentation, meaning the fungus is growing in two forms simultaneously:\n    *   **Budding Yeast Cells:** These are the round to oval-shaped, magenta-stained structures. Many are seen in the process of budding (asexual reproduction), where a smaller daughter cell grows off the parent cell.\n    *   **Pseudohyphae:** These are the elongated, filamentous chains of cells. They are formed when budding yeast cells elongate and remain attached. The distinct constrictions or \"pinching\" at the points where the cells connect are characteristic of pseudohyphae, distinguishing them from true hyphae.\n\n3.  **Interpretation and Likely Identification:**\n    The combination of budding yeast cells and pseudohyphae is a hallmark of the genus **Candida**, particularly the species *Candida albicans*. This morphology is typically seen in tissue infections (candidiasis). The stain appears to be a Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain, which stains the carbohydrate-rich fungal cell walls magenta, making them stand out against the blue-stained background tissue.\n\"\"\"\n    print(analysis_and_classification)\n\nclassify_microorganism()\n```\n<<<Fungus (yeast) exhibiting budding yeast cells and pseudohyphae, characteristic of *Candida*.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
