    "The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* lies in the **seta**, which is the stalk that supports the capsule.\n\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta*** is named for its most distinctive feature: a **curved seta**. This curvature causes the capsule to be emergent (projecting slightly beyond the leaves) and cernuous (nodding) or even pendulous (hanging down).\n*   ***Grimmia montana***, on the other hand, has a very short, **straight seta**. This results in a capsule that is immersed (hidden among the upper leaves) and erect.\n\nThis difference in the seta's shape and the resulting orientation of the capsule is the most reliable characteristic to distinguish the two species at a glance when they are fertile.\n\n<<<The primary distinguishing feature is the seta: it is short and straight in *Grimmia montana*, leading to an erect, immersed capsule, while it is distinctly curved in *Grimmia curviseta*, causing the capsule to be emergent and nodding.>>>"
