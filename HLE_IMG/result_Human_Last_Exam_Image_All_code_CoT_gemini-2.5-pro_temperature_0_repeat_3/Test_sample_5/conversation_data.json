    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the music:\n\n1.  **Analyze Musical Characteristics:** I will examine the key signature (two sharps: B minor or D major), time signature (4/4), tempo marking (♩=80), and dynamic markings (p, f, mp, mf).\n2.  **Identify Style and Era:** The piece features virtuosic passages with rapid sixteenth notes, dramatic dynamic shifts, and rich, chromatic harmonies. This is characteristic of the Romantic era of classical music.\n3.  **Recognize Melodies and Patterns:** I will look at the specific melodic contours and the accompanying figures. The left-hand pattern starting in measure 4 (arpeggiated chords in a root-fifth-octave-tenth pattern) and the soaring right-hand melody are very distinctive.\n4.  **Match to a Known Piece:** Based on the style and specific patterns, I will search for famous piano works from the Romantic period, particularly by composers known for such virtuosic writing, like Chopin or Liszt. The combination of B minor key and the specific themes strongly points to a well-known sonata.\n5.  **Generate Code:** I will write a Python script to print the name of the composer, the full title of the piece, and explicitly list the numbers from the title as requested.\n\n```python\ndef guess_the_music():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the piece of music from the provided sheet music\n    and prints the details.\n    \"\"\"\n    composer = \"Frédéric Chopin\"\n    piece_title = \"Piano Sonata No. 3 in B minor, Op. 58\"\n    movement = \"IV. Finale. Presto non tanto\"\n    \n    sonata_number = 3\n    opus_number = 58\n\n    print(f\"The sheet music is from a famous piece by {composer}.\")\n    print(f\"Title: {piece_title}\")\n    print(f\"Movement: {movement}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nAs requested, here are the numbers from the title:\")\n    print(f\"Sonata Number: {sonata_number}\")\n    print(f\"Opus Number: {opus_number}\")\n\nguess_the_music()\n```\n<<<Frédéric Chopin - Piano Sonata No. 3 in B minor, Op. 58, IV. Finale>>>"
