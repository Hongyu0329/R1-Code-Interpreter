    "Based on the visual evidence in the image sequence, I will deduce the biological process being shown.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the image panels:** The image displays three sequential panels labeled L, M, and N, showing a microscopic view of a filamentous structure, which appears to be a chain of cells. This is characteristic of organisms like fungi or filamentous algae.\n2.  **Observe the changes across panels:**\n    *   **Panel L:** Shows a relatively straight filament. An arrowhead points to a septum (the cross-wall between two cells). The cells are elongating in one primary direction (apical growth).\n    *   **Panel M:** The same filament is shown, but a change is occurring. A new bulge or outgrowth is forming on the side of one of the cells, just below the tip. The arrowhead points to this new bulge. This indicates the initiation of a new growth axis.\n    *   **Panel N:** The bulge seen in panel M has grown larger and has started to elongate, forming a new branch or causing the main filament to bend sharply. The original direction of growth has been altered. The arrowhead again highlights the point of this directional change.\n3.  **Synthesize the observations:** The sequence L -> M -> N clearly illustrates a process where a tip-growing organism changes its direction of growth. A new growth point is established on the lateral wall of a cell, leading to a reorientation of the entire filament. This process is fundamental for how these organisms navigate their environment, respond to stimuli (like light, nutrients, or obstacles), and form complex structures.\n\n**Conclusion:** The process depicted is the **reorientation of tip growth**.\n\n```python\ndef describe_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function describes the biological process shown in the provided image.\n  \"\"\"\n  process_name = \"Reorientation of tip growth\"\n  description = (\n      \"The image sequence (L, M, N) illustrates the process of reorientation of tip growth in a filamentous organism.\\n\"\n      \"1.

In panel N, this new point has developed, causing the filament to bend and change its overall direction of growth.\"\n  )\n  \n  print(f\"Process: {process_name}\\n\")\n  print(\"Description:\")\n  print(description)\n\ndescribe_process()\n```\n<<<The process being depicted is the reorientation of tip growth in a filamentous organism.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
