    print("2. The provided image is black and contains no molecular structures.")
    print("3. The question refers to 'the molecules mentioned above', but no molecules are shown.")

    print("Without the structures of the molecules, it is impossible to compare their connectivity or spatial arrangement.")
    print("Therefore, we cannot determine if they are conformers, constitutional isomers, identical, or stereoisomers.")
