    "To find the total number of splice species, we need to analyze the results from each RT-PCR panel and count the number of unique mRNA variants they reveal. We must be careful not to double-count species that are detected in multiple experiments.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze Panel B (E1F1/E4R):** This experiment uses a general forward primer in the E1 region and a reverse primer in the E4 region. It shows two bands (190 bp and 159 bp), which indicates two different splice variants in this region. This gives us our first **2** species.\n2.  **Analyze Panel C (E1F1/E5R):** This experiment confirms the findings from Panel B. The two bands (584 bp and 553 bp) show the same size difference (31 bp) as in Panel B, indicating they are the same two species, just amplified with a more distant reverse primer. No new species are identified.\n3.  **Analyze Panel D (E1F2/E5R):** This experiment uses a forward primer (E1F2) that specifically recognizes a splice junction (929^3465). The single band (551 bp) represents a new, distinct splice species. This adds **1** new species.\n4.  **Analyze Panel E (E1F1/L2R):** This experiment shows a single band (1005 bp). Since it's amplified with the general E1F1 primer but results in a single product (unlike the two in Panel B/C), it represents a distinct splicing pathway. This adds **1** new species.\n5.  **Analyze Panel F (E1F2/L2R):** This experiment confirms the species found in Panel D, just amplified with a different reverse primer. No new species are identified.\n6.  **Analyze Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** This experiment uses a forward primer (E1F3) for a different splice junction (929^3506). The two resulting bands (1003 bp and 931 bp) indicate that this initial splice can be combined with a second, downstream alternative splice. This reveals **2** new species.\n7.  **Analyze Panels H and I (E1F1/L1R):** These experiments detect \"late\" transcripts that use the late polyadenylation site (AL). Panel I is more sensitive and reveals a total of four distinct bands (450, 419, 378, and 187 bp). Since these are late transcripts, they are fundamentally different from the \"early\" transcripts seen in panels B-G. Therefore, these four bands represent **4** new species.\n\nBy summing the unique species identified from each key experiment, we can find the total number.\n\n```python\ndef count_splice_species():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total number of splice species based on the provided RT-PCR data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of species from Panel B (E1F1/E4R)\n    species_from_B = 2  # Bands at 190 bp and 159 bp\n\n    # Number of new species from Panel D (E1F2/E5R)\n    # This panel identifies a species with the 929^3465 splice.\n    species_from_D = 1  # Band at 551 bp\n\n    # Number of new species from Panel E (E1F1/L2R)\n    # This panel identifies a distinct early transcript.\n    species_from_E = 1 # Band at 1005 bp\n\n    # Number of new species from Panel G (E1F3/L2R)\n    # This panel identifies two species with the 929^3506 splice.\n    species_from_G = 2  # Bands at 1003 bp and 931 bp\n\n    # Number of new species from Panel I (E1F1/L1R)\n    # This panel identifies four distinct late transcripts.\n    species_from_I = 4  # Bands at 450, 419, 378, and 187 bp\n\n    # Total number of species is the sum of unique species from each informative experiment.\n    total_species = species_from_B + species_from_D + species_from_E + species_from_G + species_from_I\n\n    print(\"To find the total number of splice species, we sum the unique variants identified in each informative experiment:\")\n    print(f\"Panel B revealed {species_from_B} species.\")\n    print(f\"Panel D revealed {species_from_D} new species.\")\n    print(f\"Panel E revealed {species_from_E} new species.\")\n    print(f\"Panel G revealed {species_from_G} new species.\")\n    print(f\"Panel I revealed {species_from_I} new (late) species.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{species_from_B} + {species_from_D} + {species_from_E} + {species_from_G} + {species_from_I} = {total_species}\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, a total of {total_species} splice species can be found in this image.\")\n\ncount_splice_species()\n```\n<<<10>>>"
