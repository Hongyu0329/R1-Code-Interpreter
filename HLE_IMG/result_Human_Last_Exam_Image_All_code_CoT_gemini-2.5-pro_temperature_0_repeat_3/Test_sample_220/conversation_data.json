    "To solve this problem, I will first determine the expected two-dimensional (2D) projection of a three-dimensional (3D) face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal lattice when viewed along the [110] crystallographic direction. Then, I will compare this theoretical pattern with the four provided images (A, B, C, and D) to find the match.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Define the FCC Lattice:** An FCC unit cell has atoms at the eight corners and at the center of the six faces.\n2.  **Define the [110] Projection:** Viewing along the [110] direction means we are projecting the 3D atomic coordinates onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to the vector `[1, 1, 0]`.\n3.  **Determine the Projected Pattern:** When the FCC atoms are projected in this way, they form a specific, repeating 2D pattern. The unit cell of this projected pattern is a rectangle with atoms at its four corners and an additional atom at its exact center. This is known as a **centered rectangular lattice**. The side lengths of this rectangle are `a` and `aâˆš2`, where `a` is the lattice constant of the original cube.\n4.  **Analyze the Images:**\n    *   **Image A** shows a complex pattern where points appear in pairs. This is not a simple centered rectangle.\n    *   **Image B** shows a pattern of points forming a grid of rectangles (or squares), each with an atom at its center. This matches the description of a centered rectangular lattice.\n    *   **Image C** shows a pattern with clear hexagonal symmetry. This is characteristic of viewing an FCC lattice along the [111] direction.\n    *   **Image D** shows a simple rectangular lattice, with atoms only at the corners of the rectangles, but not in the center. This is characteristic of viewing an FCC lattice along the [100] direction.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, Image B is the only one that displays the centered rectangular pattern characteristic of an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n\nThe following Python code summarizes this reasoning and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_fcc_110_projection():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides a step-by-step reasoning to identify which image\n    represents an FCC crystal structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the FCC [110] Projection\")\n    print(\"A Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal has atoms at each corner and on the center of each face of a cube.\")\n    print(\"When this 3D structure is projected onto a 2D plane as viewed from the [110] direction, a specific pattern emerges.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: The Characteristic Pattern\")\n    print(\"The theoretical projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction is a 'centered rectangular' pattern.\")\n    print(\"This means the pattern is made of repeating rectangles with atoms at all four corners and one atom in the center of each rectangle.\")\n    \n    # This section addresses the \"output each number in the final equation\" requirement\n    # by describing the geometry of the projected unit cell.\n    print(\"\\nDetails of the projected unit cell (the 'equation' of the pattern):\")\n    print(\" - The shape is a rectangle.\")\n    print(\" - If the original cubic lattice constant is 'a', the side lengths of the projected rectangle are 'a' and 'a * sqrt(2)'.\")\n    print(\" - The ratio of the side lengths is sqrt(2), which is approximately 1.414.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Comparing the Theoretical Pattern with the Given Images\")\n    print(\" - Image A: Shows a complex pattern, not a simple centered rectangle.
