    "This task requires identifying a chemical compound from its structure.\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure:** The image shows a polycyclic organic molecule. I can see it has four fused rings.\n2.  **Identify functional groups and key features:** There are two nitrogen atoms within the ring system, making it a heterocyclic compound and an amine. The presence of nitrogen suggests it's likely an alkaloid. There is also a carbonyl group (C=O) as part of a six-membered ring, which makes it a lactam (a cyclic amide).\n3.  **Recognize the core skeleton:** The core structure is based on a quinolizidine skeleton, which is common in lupin alkaloids. The specific arrangement of the four rings and the position of the lactam group are characteristic of a specific compound.\n4.  **Identify the compound:** By comparing this specific structure, including the stereochemistry indicated by the wedged and dashed bonds, to a database of known alkaloids, I can identify it as Lupanine.\n5.  **Formulate the code:** As requested, I will provide a Python script that simply prints the name of the identified compound.\n\n```python\ndef identify_alkaloid():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the alkaloid from the provided image and prints its name.\n    The structure shown is that of Lupanine, a quinolizidine alkaloid.\n    \"\"\"\n    compound_name = \"Lupanine\"\n    print(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n\nidentify_alkaloid()\n```\n<<<Lupanine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
