    # Analysis of A-G
    print("A. Candidate A-G:")
    print("   - Contains an indole ring, not a simple benzene ring.")
    print("   - Has a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2), which would show as a 6H singlet. This is not observed.")
    print("   - Lacks an amide group (-NH-C=O) and ethyl groups (-CH2CH3).")
    print("   - Conclusion: Does not match the spectrum.\n")

    # Analysis of B-G
    print("B. Candidate B-G:")
    print("   - Contains an indole ring.")
    print("   - Has a dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2), which would show as a 6H singlet. This is not observed.")
    print("   - Lacks an amide group (-NH-C=O) and ethyl groups (-CH2CH3).")
    print("   - Conclusion: Does not match the spectrum.\n")

    # Analysis of C-L
    print("C. Candidate C-L (Lidocaine):")
    print("   - Amide N-H (1H): Expected as a broad singlet around 8-9 ppm. Matches the signal at ~9.0 ppm.")
    print("   - Aromatic protons (3H): The benzene ring is substituted at positions 1, 2, and 6, leaving 3 aromatic protons. Expected as a multiplet around 7-7.5 ppm. Matches the signal at ~7.1 ppm.")
    print("   - Methylene bridge (-C(=O)-CH2-N-): These 2 protons have no adjacent protons, so a singlet is expected around 3.4 ppm. Matches the signal at ~3.4 ppm.")
    print("   - Aromatic methyl group (Ar-CH3): These 3 protons have no adjacent protons, so a singlet is expected around 2.3 ppm. Matches the signal at ~2.3 ppm.")
    print("   - Diethylamino group (-N(CH2CH3)2):")
    print("     - The two CH2 groups (4H total) are adjacent to CH3 groups, so a quartet is expected. Matches the signal at ~2.8 ppm.")
    print("     - The two CH3 groups (6H total) are adjacent to CH2 groups, so a triplet is expected. Matches the signal at ~1.1 ppm.")
    print("   - Conclusion: All predicted signals for structure C-L perfectly match the observed spectrum.\n")

    # Analysis of D-L
    print("D. Candidate D-L:")
    print("   - Aromatic protons (2H): The benzene ring is substituted at positions 1, 2, 4, and 6, leaving only 2 aromatic protons. This contradicts the spectrum which suggests 3H in the aromatic region (~7.1 ppm).")
    print("   - Aromatic methyl groups: Has two non-equivalent methyl groups on the ring, which should produce two separate singlets. The spectrum only shows one singlet at ~2.3 ppm.")
    print("   - Conclusion: Does not match the spectrum due to the number of aromatic protons and methyl signals.\n")
