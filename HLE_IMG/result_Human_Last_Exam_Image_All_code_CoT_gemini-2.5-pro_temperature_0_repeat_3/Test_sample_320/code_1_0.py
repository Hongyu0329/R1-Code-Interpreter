def solve_cellular_automaton():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the cellular automaton visualization puzzle.
    
    The solution is derived by following these steps:
    1.  Identify four visually coherent evolutionary sequences of four patterns each from the sixteen visualizations.
        - Sequence A: C -> K -> F -> E
        - Sequence B: D -> I -> N -> B
        - Sequence C: G -> H -> M -> P
        - Sequence D: O -> L -> J -> A
    2.  Determine the starting pattern for each sequence: C, D, G, O.
    3.  Order these starting patterns by visual complexity, from simplest to most complex, to correspond with the increasing start times of the rules (R1 at t=2, R2 at t=3, R3 at t=4, R4 at t=5). The determined order is G < O < C < D.
    4.  Assign each sequence to a rule based on its starting pattern:
        - Rule 1 (starts t=2) must begin with G. Sequence: GHMP.
        - Rule 2 (starts t=3) must begin with O. Sequence: OLJA.
        - Rule 3 (starts t=4) must begin with C. Sequence: CKFE.
        - Rule 4 (starts t=5) must begin with D. Sequence: DINB.
    5.  Format the answer as requested.
