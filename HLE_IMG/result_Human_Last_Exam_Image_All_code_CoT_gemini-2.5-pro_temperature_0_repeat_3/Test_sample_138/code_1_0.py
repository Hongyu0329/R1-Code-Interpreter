# Step 1: Determine the sexes for Pair A.
# The left insect has a pointed abdomen (female Coelioxys bee).
# The right insect has a spiny abdominal tip (male Coelioxys bee).
# Pair A is (Female, Male), which is option 4.
index_A = 4

# Step 2: Determine the sexes for Pair B.
# Both wasps have curled antennae tips, a characteristic of male paper wasps.
# Pair B is (Male, Male), which is option 1.
index_B = 1

# Step 3: Determine the sexes for Pair C.
# The left bee has very long antennae (male long-horned bee).
# The right bee has short antennae (female bee).
# Pair C is (Male, Female), which is option 3.
index_C = 3

# Step 4: Print the final answer as a comma-separated string.
