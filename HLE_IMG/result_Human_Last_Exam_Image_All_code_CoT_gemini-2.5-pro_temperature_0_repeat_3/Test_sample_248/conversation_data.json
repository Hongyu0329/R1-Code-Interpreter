    "The image displays a typical rocky intertidal zone community. To determine whether it's from the Atlantic or Pacific coast, we need to identify a species that is exclusively or predominantly found on one coast.\n\n1.  **Identify the organisms:** The photo shows several species:\n    *   Acorn barnacles (crusts on the rock).\n    *   Two types of marine snails. The smaller, dark, conical snails are particularly important for identification.\n\n2.  **Analyze the key species:** The small, dark snails are identifiable as the common periwinkle.\n    *   **Scientific Name:** *Littorina littorea*.\n    *   **Distribution:** This species is native to the northeastern Atlantic coasts of Europe. It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the mid-19th century and has since become extremely abundant, a dominant species from Canada to Maryland.\n    *   **Pacific Presence:** While there are some small, introduced populations of *Littorina littorea* on the Pacific coast (e.g., in San Francisco Bay), it is not widespread and is not a characteristic member of the Pacific intertidal ecosystem.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The presence of the common periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*, in a typical rocky shore assemblage like the one pictured, is a definitive indicator that the photo was taken on the North American Atlantic coast, where it is ubiquitous, rather than the Pacific coast, where it is a rare and localized invasive species.\n\nThe following Python code will print the scientific name of this indicator species.\n\n```python\ndef find_indicator_species():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the species that indicates the photo was taken\n    on the Atlantic coast and prints its scientific name.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The common periwinkle, Littorina littorea, is native to Europe but is\n    # now one of the most common intertidal snails on the North American Atlantic coast.\n    # It is not native to the Pacific coast and its presence there is very limited.\n    # Therefore, its appearance in this photo is a strong indicator of the Atlantic coast.\n    scientific_name = \"Littorina littorea\"\n    print(scientific_name)\n\nfind_indicator_species()\n```\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
