    print("All three are cationic Iridium(III) complexes with a general formula [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+, where C^N is a cyclometalating ligand and N^N is a neutral bidentate ligand.")
    print("- Complex 1: Uses phenylpyridine (ppy) as the C^N ligand and bipyridine (bpy) as the N^N ligand. This is a standard, baseline complex.")
    print("- Complex 2: Uses ppy as the C^N ligand, but has a much larger, more complex N^N ligand. This primarily affects the electronic properties.")
    print("- Complex 3: Uses 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (dfppy) as the C^N ligand and 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dtbbpy) as the N^N ligand.")
    print("-" * 60)

    print("Step 2: Identifying molecular features that enhance stability in LECs.")
    print("The operational stability of an LEC is strongly tied to the chemical robustness of the emitter molecule. Two key design strategies to improve stability are:")
    print("  a) Fluorination: Adding fluorine atoms to the ligands (especially the C^N ligand) strengthens the Iridium-Carbon bond, making the complex more resistant to degradation.")
    print("  b) Steric Hindrance: Adding bulky groups (like tert-butyl) to the ligands shields the reactive metal center and ligand backbone from unwanted chemical reactions and intermolecular quenching.")
    print("-" * 60)

    print("Step 3: Comparing the complexes based on stability features.")
    print("- Complex 1 is the reference with no specific stability enhancements.")
    print("- Complex 2's large N^N ligand does not inherently add stability and its planarity might even lead to detrimental aggregation.")
    print("- Complex 3 incorporates BOTH key stability-enhancing features:")
    print("  - The 'dfppy' ligands are fluorinated, strengthening the Ir-C bonds.")
    print("  - The 'dtbbpy' ligand has bulky tert-butyl groups, providing steric protection.")
    print("-" * 60)

    print("Step 4: Conclusion.")
    print("Complex 3 is explicitly designed for superior stability compared to the other two. The combination of stronger bonds from fluorination and steric protection from bulky groups makes it the most robust candidate.")
    print("\nTherefore, LECs based on complex 3 are expected to result in more stable devices.")
