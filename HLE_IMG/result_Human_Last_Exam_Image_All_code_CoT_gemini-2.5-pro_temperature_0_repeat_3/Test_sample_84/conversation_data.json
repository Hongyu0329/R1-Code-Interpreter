    "The coat of arms in the image is a very close representation of the coat of arms of a specific city. The key elements to identify are the shield's design and the charges upon it.\n\n1.  **Shield Division and Colors:** The shield is divided horizontally (\"per fess\"). The top half is blue (\"azure\"), and the bottom half is yellow/gold (\"or\"). This color combination is notably similar to the flag of Ukraine.\n2.  **Charges (Symbols):**\n    *   In the top blue section, there is a crescent moon.\n    *   In the bottom yellow section, there is a black crab.\n3.  **Supporters and Crest:** The shield is topped with a crown and flanked by an olive branch and an oak branch. These are common heraldic embellishments.\n\nBy searching for a coat of arms featuring a shield divided horizontally into blue and yellow, with a crescent moon and a crab, we can identify the city of **Izmail, Ukraine**.\n\nThe official coat of arms of Izmail features this exact shield design. While the crown and the specific branches in the image are artistic interpretations, the core shield, which is the most important part of a coat of arms, is a direct match.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the city.\n\n```python\ndef find_city_with_similar_coat_of_arms():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the city whose coat of arms\n    is very similar to the one described.\n\n    The described coat of arms has a shield divided horizontally (per fess),\n    blue (azure) over yellow (or), with a crescent moon in the top part\n    and a black crab in the bottom part. This design is characteristic of\n    the coat of arms of Izmail, Ukraine.\n    \"\"\"\n    city_name = \"Izmail\"\n    country_name = \"Ukraine\"\n    \n    print(f\"The city with a coat of arms very similar to the one in the image is: {city_name}, {country_name}\")\n\nfind_city_with_similar_coat_of_arms()\n```\n<<<Izmail>>>"
