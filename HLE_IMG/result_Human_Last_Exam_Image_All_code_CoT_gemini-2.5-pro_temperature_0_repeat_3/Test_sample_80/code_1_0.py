# This is a conceptual problem in organic chemistry.
# The user is asked to predict the product of a complex chemical reaction.
# The provided options are different chemical structures labeled A through F.
# Based on analysis of the reaction mechanism and known chemical literature,
# the correct product is structure F.

# The task is to provide the answer in the specified format.
# No coding is required to solve the chemical problem itself, but the final
# output should be generated by a script.

product = "F"
print(f"The expected product is {product}.")
