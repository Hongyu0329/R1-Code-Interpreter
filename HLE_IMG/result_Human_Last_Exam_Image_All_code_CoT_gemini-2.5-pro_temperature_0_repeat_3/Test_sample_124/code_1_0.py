R3 = 9.0  # Resistance in Ohms
R7 = 100.0 # Resistance in Ohms
# R2 and R8 are short-circuited and thus ignored in the calculation.

# Step 1: Calculate the resistance of the first parallel branch (left side).
# R2 is short-circuited, so the resistance is the sum of R1 and R3 in series.
R_branch1 = R1 + R3

# Step 2: The resistance of the second parallel branch (right side) is R7.
# R8 is short-circuited.
R_branch2 = R7

# Step 3: Calculate the total equivalent resistance of the two parallel branches.
# The formula is R_total = 1 / (1/R_branch1 + 1/R_branch2)
R_total = (R_branch1 * R_branch2) / (R_branch1 + R_branch2)

# Step 4: Calculate the total current using Ohm's Law (I = V / R).
I_total = V2 / R_total
