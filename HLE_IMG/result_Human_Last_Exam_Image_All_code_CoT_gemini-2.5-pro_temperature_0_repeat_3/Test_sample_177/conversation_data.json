    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total relative Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) for cars in both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios and then find the percentage reduction.\n\nThe VMT for each distance category is calculated using the formula:\n`VMT = (Share of Total Trips) * (Total Car Mode Share) * (Average Trip Distance)`\n\nThe Total Car Mode Share is the sum of the mode shares for 'car, 1 occupant' and 'car, with more than 2 occupants'. We will calculate this for each distance category and for both scenarios.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  **Calculate Total Baseline Car VMT:** Sum the VMT for all distance categories using the data from Table 1.\n2.  **Calculate Total Proposed Car VMT:** Sum the VMT for all distance categories using the data from Table 2.\n3.  **Calculate Percentage Reduction:** Use the formula: `((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100`.\n\nThe Python code below will execute these steps and print the full calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Redirect stdout to capture print output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# --- Data from the tables ---\n# Common data for both scenarios\nshare_of_total_trips = [0.48, 0.22, 0.14, 0.16]\navg_trip_distance = [1, 4, 7.5, 20]\ndistance_categories = [\"0-3 miles\", \"3-5 miles\", \"5-10 miles\", \"10+ miles\"]\n\n# Baseline data (Table 1)\ncar_1_occupant_share_baseline = [0.25, 0.38, 0.40, 0.42]\ncarpool_share_baseline = [0.28, 0.43, 0.45, 0.47]\n\n# Proposed data (Table 2)\ncar_1_occupant_share_proposed = [0.01, 0.08, 0.14, 0.16]\ncarpool_share_proposed = [0.02, 0.19, 0.27, 0.33]\n\n# --- Step 1: Calculate Baseline Car VMT ---\ntotal_baseline_vmt = 0\nbaseline_vmt_parts_str = []\nfor i in range(len(share_of_total_trips)):\n    total_car_share = car_1_occupant_share_baseline[i] + carpool_share_baseline[i]\n    vmt_part = share_of_total_trips[i] * total_car_share * avg_trip_distance[i]\n    total_baseline_vmt += vmt_part\n    # Format the string for the equation part\n    part_str = f\"({share_of_total_trips[i]} * ({car_1_occupant_share_baseline[i]} + {carpool_share_baseline[i]}) * {avg_trip_distance[i]})\"\n    baseline_vmt_parts_str.append(part_str)\n\nprint(\"1.
