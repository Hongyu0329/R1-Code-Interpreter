    "To determine the longest R-R interval in seconds from the ECG rhythm strip, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the time calibration:** The ECG paper speed is given as 25 mm/sec. The grid is made of 1 mm small squares. Therefore, the time for one small square is 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n2.  **Identify the longest R-R interval:** I will visually scan the entire rhythm strip to locate the greatest distance between two consecutive R-wave peaks. The most significant pause appears in the fourth strip of the ECG.\n3.  **Measure the interval:** I will count the number of small squares for this longest interval. The R-wave before the pause is on a thick vertical line. The R-wave after the pause is 6 large squares and 2 small squares away. Since one large square is 5 small squares, the total distance is (6 * 5) + 2 = 32 small squares.\n4.  **Calculate the duration in seconds:** I will multiply the number of small squares by the time per square (0.04 seconds) to get the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rr_interval():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the longest R-R interval in seconds from an ECG strip.\n\n    The function uses the standard ECG paper speed and the measured interval\n    in small squares to compute the time duration.\n    \"\"\"\n    # ECG paper speed is 25 mm/sec.\n    # One small square on the grid is 1 mm.\n    # Time per small square = 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = 0.04 seconds.\n    time_per_small_square = 0.04  # seconds\n\n    # By visual inspection, the longest R-R interval is found in the fourth strip.\n    # It spans 6 large squares and 2 small squares.\n    # 1 large square = 5 small squares.\n    num_large_squares = 6\n    num_small_squares_extra = 2\n    total_small_squares = (num_large_squares * 5) + num_small_squares_extra\n\n    # Calculate the longest R-R interval in seconds.\n    longest_rr_interval_sec = total_small_squares * time_per_small_square\n\n    print(f\"The longest R-R interval spans {total_small_squares} small squares.\")\n    print(f\"Each small square represents {time_per_small_square} seconds.\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: {total_small_squares} squares * {time_per_small_square} sec/square = {longest_rr_interval_sec:.2f} seconds.\")\n    print(f\"The longest R-R interval is {longest_rr_interval_sec:.2f} seconds.\")\n\ncalculate_rr_interval()\n```\n<<<1.28>>>"
