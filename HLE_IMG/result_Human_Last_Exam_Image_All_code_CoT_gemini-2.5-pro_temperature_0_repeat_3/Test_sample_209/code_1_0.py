    This function identifies the matching giraffe.
    The logic is based on visual pattern recognition of the giraffe's coat.
    By comparing the unique spot patterns of the target giraffe with the options,
    we can determine the correct match.

    - Target: Has a distinct 'Y' shaped pattern on the upper torso and a specific cluster of spots below it.
    - A: Different color and pattern.
    - B: The spot pattern, including the 'Y' shape and the cluster below, is a clear match to the target.
    - C: Different color and pattern.
    - D: Different color and pattern.
    - E: Different pattern.
    - F: Different pattern.

    Therefore, the correct answer is B.
