    "Here is my thinking process for arriving at the diagnosis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clinical Information:** The patient is a 28-year-old female. The mass is located in the sella turcica. The sella turcica is the bony structure at the base of the skull that houses the pituitary gland. Therefore, the most common tumor in this location is a pituitary adenoma.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Pathological Image (Crush Smear):**\n    *   **Cellularity and Arrangement:** The image shows cohesive clusters of cells. The cell borders are indistinct, giving the clusters a syncytial appearance (meaning the cells appear to merge together).\n    *   **Cell Morphology:** The cells are relatively uniform in size and shape (monomorphic). This suggests a low-grade, well-differentiated tumor rather than a highly aggressive malignancy.\n    *   **Nuclear Features:** The nuclei are round to oval. The chromatin (the genetic material inside the nucleus) has a finely granular or stippled appearance. This is often described as a \"salt-and-pepper\" pattern, which is a classic feature of neuroendocrine tumors. Nucleoli are not prominent.\n    *   **Cytoplasmic Features:** The cytoplasm is moderately abundant, pink (eosinophilic), and granular.\n    *   **Background:** The background is somewhat fibrillary and granular, which is typical for a crush preparation of neuroendocrine or neural tissue.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Formulate a Diagnosis:**\n    *   The clinical context (sellar mass) points strongly towards a pituitary tumor.\n    *   The cytological features (monomorphic cells, syncytial arrangement, \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin, granular eosinophilic cytoplasm) are the hallmark characteristics of a pituitary adenoma.\n    *   Other possibilities in this location are less likely given the morphology. For example, a craniopharyngioma would show squamous cells and calcification, and a meningioma would typically show whorls and intranuclear inclusions, none of which are seen here.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The combination of the clinical presentation and the classic cytomorphology on the crush smear is diagnostic of a pituitary adenoma.\n\n```python\ndef provide_diagnosis():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script outlines the diagnostic reasoning based on the provided clinical and pathological data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Clinical Data\n    patient_age = 28\n    mass_location = \"sella turcica\"\n\n    print(\"Case Analysis:\")\n    print(\"--------------\")\n    print(f\"1.
