    "Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the first clue:** \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\" I will use the image and the date to identify the person and the event. The image shows a man with a beard receiving an award. A search for major award ceremonies on June 20, 2019, points to the NHL Awards. The man receiving the award is identifiable as hockey player Nikita Kucherov.\n2.  **Analyze the second clue:** \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This points to a historical process or object. Mercury salts were famously used in the process of making felt for hats, a practice called \"carroting.\" This process was dangerous and is no longer used.\n3.  **Connect the clues:** The common link between a hockey player and the historical process of making hats with mercury is the term \"Hat Trick.\" In hockey, a \"hat trick\" is when a player scores three goals in one game. The term's origin is related to the tradition of being awarded a hat for a great performance.\n4.  **Formulate the answer:** Therefore, X Y is \"Hat Trick\".\n5.  **Create the Python code:** I will write a simple Python script to define X and Y and print the final answer.\n\n```python\n# The riddle connects a modern event with a historical process.\n# The event on June 20, 2019, is the NHL Awards, where hockey player Nikita Kucherov is pictured.\n# The historical process involving toxic mercury salts was used for making felt hats.\n# The term that links hockey and hats is \"Hat Trick\".\n# X = Hat, Y = Trick\n\nx = \"Hat\"\ny = \"Trick\"\n\nprint(f\"The X Y in the riddle is: {x} {y}\")\n```\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
