    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** I will visually inspect the provided raster plot to identify the time points where a large number of electrodes fire simultaneously. These are visible as dense vertical bands. I will estimate the center timestamp for each of these bursts.\n2.  **List Burst Timestamps:** I will create a list of the identified timestamps in seconds.\n3.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** I will calculate the time difference between each consecutive pair of bursts.\n4.  **Calculate Average IBI:** I will compute the average of all the calculated inter-burst intervals.\n5.  **Format the Output:** I will present the final average rounded to two significant figures, as requested, and show the calculation steps.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_average_ibi():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies timestamps of synchronized bursts from the graph,\n    calculates the inter-burst intervals (IBIs), and computes the average IBI.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Identify and list the approximate timestamps of synchronized bursts (in seconds)\n    # These are estimated from the center of the dense vertical firing patterns in the graph.\n    burst_timestamps = [2.5, 11.5, 18.5, 26.5, 36.5, 48.5]\n    print(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs)\n    # The IBI is the difference in time between consecutive bursts.\n    inter_burst_intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\n    print(f\"Calculated inter-burst intervals (s): {list(inter_burst_intervals)}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the average IBI\n    average_ibi = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\n    \n    # Step 5: Print the final calculation and result\n    # Create the equation string\n    intervals_sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, inter_burst_intervals))\n    equation = f\"({intervals_sum_str}) / {len(inter_burst_intervals)}\"\n    \n    print(f\"\\nCalculation for the average inter-burst interval:\")\n    print(f\"Average = {equation} = {average_ibi:.2f} s\")\n    \n    # Format the final answer to two significant figures\n    final_answer = f\"{average_ibi:.1f}\"\n    print(f\"\\nThe average inter-burst interval to two significant figures is {final_answer} s.\")\n\ncalculate_average_ibi()\n```\n<<<9.2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts in this graph of firing activity of a neuronal culture and calculate the average inter-burst interval to two significant figures.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
