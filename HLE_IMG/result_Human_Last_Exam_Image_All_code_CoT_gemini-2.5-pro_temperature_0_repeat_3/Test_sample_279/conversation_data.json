    "Based on the image provided, the lesion is located in the pits and fissures of the occlusal (chewing) surface of a posterior tooth.

Black's classification and identifies the correct class for the lesion shown.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define a dictionary containing the G.V. Black classification system, with classes as keys and their descriptions as values.\n2.  Describe the location of the lesion seen in the image.\n3.
