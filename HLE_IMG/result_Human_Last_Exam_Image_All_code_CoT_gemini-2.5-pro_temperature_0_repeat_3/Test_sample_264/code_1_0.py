    Analyzes conceptual flow cytometry data to determine which antibody stained all cells.

    - The x-axis is fluorescence intensity.
    - The y-axis is the cell count.
    - The black curve is the unstained (negative) control, showing baseline fluorescence.
    - The red curve is the antibody-stained sample.
    - If an antibody stains ALL cells, the entire red curve will shift to a higher
      fluorescence compared to the black curve, with no remaining population at the
