    "Here is my plan to identify the compound from the mass spectrum:\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Peak:** Find the most intense peak in the spectrum, which is assigned a relative intensity of 100%.\n2.  **Identify the Molecular Ion (M+) Peak:** Locate the peak with the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) that corresponds to the intact molecule. This is usually the start of a cluster of peaks at the high-mass end of the spectrum.\n3.  **Analyze Isotope Patterns:** Examine the relative intensities of the peaks in the molecular ion cluster (M+, M+1, M+2, etc.). The pattern is characteristic of certain elements, especially halogens like chlorine (³⁵Cl/³⁷Cl ratio ≈ 3:1). This will help determine the number of chlorine atoms in the molecule.\n4.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:** Based on the mass of the molecular ion and the number of chlorine atoms, calculate the mass of the rest of the molecule (the CₓHᵧ part). From this mass, deduce a plausible chemical formula.\n5.  **Analyze Fragmentation:** Examine the major fragment peaks. The mass differences between the molecular ion and these fragments correspond to the loss of neutral groups (like Cl, HCl, CH₃). This provides clues about the molecule's structure. The base peak often results from a very stable fragment ion formed by a simple cleavage from the molecular ion.\n6.  **Propose a Structure and Name:** Combine all the evidence from the formula and fragmentation pattern to propose a likely chemical structure and provide its systematic IUPAC name.\n\nI will now write a Python script to formalize this analysis and print the conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_mass_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided mass spectrum data to identify the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data from the table and graph\n    spectrum_data = {\n        225: 100.0,  # Base Peak\n        227: 66.7,\n        260: 34.8,\n        262: 29.0,\n        190: 48.4,\n        223: 60.1,\n        155: 16.1,\n        118: 43.5,\n        141: 28.1,\n        35: 3.09,\n        37: 1.04,\n        47: 18.4,\n        49: 6.24\n    }\n\n    # Step 1: Identify Base Peak\n    base_peak_mz = max(spectrum_data, key=spectrum_data.get)\n    print(f\"Step 1: The base peak (most intense peak) is at m/z = {base_peak_mz}.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Identify Molecular Ion (M+)\n    # The highest significant mass cluster starts at m/z 260.\n    molecular_ion_mz = 260\n    print(f\"Step 2: The molecular ion (M+) peak is likely at m/z = {molecular_ion_mz}, the start of the highest mass cluster.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze Fragmentation to connect M+ and Base Peak\n    mass_loss = molecular_ion_mz - base_peak_mz\n    print(f\"Step 3: The mass difference between the molecular ion ({molecular_ion_mz}) and the base peak ({base_peak_mz}) is {molecular_ion_mz} - {base_peak_mz} = {mass_loss} u.\")\n    print(\"This mass loss of 35 u corresponds to the loss of a chlorine atom (Cl).
