# The overall transformation involves two sequential photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions.

# Step 1: The photochemical conversion of hexafluorobenzene to its valence isomer,
# hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene).
# This is a classic example of a valence isomerization.
reaction1 = "valence isomerization"

# Step 2: The newly formed hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene then reacts with cyclobutene.
# A pi bond from the Dewar benzene and the pi bond from cyclobutene undergo
# a cycloaddition. Since it involves two electrons from each component,
# it is a [2+2] cycloaddition. This is also allowed photochemically.
reaction2 = "[2+2] cycloaddition"

# Combine the descriptions for the final answer.
