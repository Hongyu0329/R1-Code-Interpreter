def find_unknot_indices():
    """
    Analyzes a predefined set of six knot diagrams and identifies which are isotopic to the unknot.

    The analysis is based on visual inspection and knowledge of basic knot theory:
    - K_1 is the Stevedore knot (6_1), which is not the unknot.
    - K_2 is a complex-looking diagram that can be untangled into a simple loop. It is the unknot.
    - K_3 is a diagram where the strand always passes 'under' at crossings. This type of knot is always the unknot.
    - K_4 is the figure-eight knot (4_1), which is not the unknot.
    - K_5 can be simplified using Reidemeister moves to show it is the unknot. A key step is removing a self-contained tangle on the right.
    - K_6 is another representation of the Stevedore knot (6_1) and is not the unknot.

    The function returns a list of the indices of the knots that are isotopic to the unknot.
