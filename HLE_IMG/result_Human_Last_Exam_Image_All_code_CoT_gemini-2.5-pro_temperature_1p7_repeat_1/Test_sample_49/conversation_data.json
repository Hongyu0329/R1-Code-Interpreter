    "Here is a plan to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The task is to find the cutoff frequency, which is determined by the RC time constant at node $a_0$. For a first-order low-pass filter, the angular cutoff frequency is given by $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$, where $R_{th}$ is the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen by the capacitor $C$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Thevenin Resistance ($R_{th}$):**\n    *   To find $R_{th}$, we need to calculate the equivalent resistance of the network looking into node $a_0$ with respect to ground.\n    *   According to Thevenin's theorem, we must turn off all independent sources. We assume the input `IN` is a voltage source, so we connect node $c_0$ to ground.\n    *   The problem then becomes finding the resistance between node $a_0$ and the grounded node $c_0$.\n    *   The circuit consists of a resistor `r` connecting $a_0$ to $d_1$, and an infinite resistive ladder from nodes $(c_1, d_1)$ onwards, with node $c_0$ acting as the ground reference.\n    *   This resistance can be found by modeling the infinite ladder as a discrete transmission line and solving the resulting system of linear difference equations for the node voltages. A current source is hypothetically connected at the output, and the resulting voltage is calculated to find the resistance.\n\n3.  **Solve for $R_{th}$:** The analysis of the difference equations for the node voltages shows that the Thevenin resistance at node $a_0$ is given by the expression:\n    $R_{th} = r(1 + \\sqrt{3})$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Cutoff Frequency ($\\omega_c$):**\n    *   Substitute the expression for $R_{th}$ into the cutoff frequency formula:\n        $\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(1 + \\sqrt{3})C}$\n    *   The final Python code will calculate the numerical value of the constant factor $(1 + \\sqrt{3})$ and present the complete equation for $\\omega_c$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the components symbolically.\n# We are asked to express the cutoff frequency in terms of 'r' and 'C'.\n\n# Step 2: The Thevenin resistance R_th, as derived from analyzing the\n# infinite ladder network, is r * (1 + sqrt(3)).\n# We calculate the numerical coefficient.\nsqrt_3 = math.sqrt(3)\ncoefficient = 1 + sqrt_3\n\n# Step 3: The cutoff angular frequency is w_c = 1 / (R_th * C).\n# We will print the final equation showing the breakdown of the numbers involved,\n# as requested by the user prompt.\none = 1.0\n\nprint(\"The cutoff angular frequency w_c is determined by the equation:\")\nprint(\"w_c = 1 / (R_th * C)\")\nprint(\"where the Thevenin resistance R_th = (1 + sqrt(3)) * r\")\nprint(\"\\nSubstituting the numerical value of sqrt(3):\")\nprint(f\"w_c = {one} / (({one} + {sqrt_3:.5f}) * r * C)\")\nprint(\"\\nThis simplifies to the final expression:\")\nprint(f\"w_c = {one} / ({coefficient:.5f} * r * C)\")\n```\n<<<w_c = 1 / ((1 + sqrt(3)) * r * C)>>>"
