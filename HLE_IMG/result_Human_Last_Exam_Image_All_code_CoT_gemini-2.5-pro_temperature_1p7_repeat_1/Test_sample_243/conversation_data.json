    "Here is my plan to solve this puzzle.\n\n1.  **Identify the plant in the image.** The plant has distinctive dark green leaves with a prominent network of white or pale green veins (reticulated variegation). The leaf shape and arrangement strongly suggest the plant is *Daphniphyllum macropodum*, likely the cultivar 'Variegatum'. The small, dark, berry-like fruits visible in one of the cropped images are also consistent with this identification.\n\n2.  **Investigate the plant's native range.** I will research the distribution of *Daphniphyllum macropodum* using botanical sources.\n\n3.  **Address the \"endemic to an island\" constraint.** The question states the plant \"was endemic to\" a single island. My research will show that the plant's native range includes Japan, Korea, and China. This is a wide area, not a single island, which creates a contradiction.\n\n4.  **Solve the puzzle.** The contradiction implies this is a riddle or a trivia question with a specific, non-obvious answer. I will investigate the history of the plant's discovery by Western science. The species *Daphniphyllum macropodum* was formally described based on specimens collected in Japan by the botanist Philipp Franz von Siebold. Siebold was based on Dejima, a small, artificial island in the harbor of Nagasaki, which was the sole point of contact between Japan and the Western world for over 200 years. Therefore, the plant's introduction to Western botany is uniquely linked to this single island. This is the most likely solution to the puzzle.\n\n5.  **Provide the code.** I will write a simple Python script to print the name of the island.\n\n```python\ndef solve_botanical_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle about the plant's island of origin.\n    \n    1. The plant in the image is identified as Daphniphyllum macropodum 'Variegatum'.\n    2. This plant species is native to Japan, Korea, and China, not endemic to a single island.\n    3. The question is a riddle. The solution lies in the history of the plant's discovery.\n    4. Botanist Philipp Franz von Siebold, who first collected the specimens that led to the\n       species' scientific description, was based on the small man-made island of Dejima\n       in Nagasaki, Japan. This island was the only gateway for Westerners to Japan for centuries.\n    5. Therefore, the specific island uniquely associated with this plant's introduction\n       to Western science is Dejima.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    island_name = \"Dejima\"\n    \n    print(f\"The plant, Daphniphyllum macropodum, was introduced to Western science through specimens collected in Japan.\")\n    print(f\"The botanist, Siebold, who collected them was based on a single island which served as a trading post.\")\n    print(f\"The name of that island is:\")\n    print(island_name)\n\nsolve_botanical_riddle()\n```\n<<<Dejima>>>"
