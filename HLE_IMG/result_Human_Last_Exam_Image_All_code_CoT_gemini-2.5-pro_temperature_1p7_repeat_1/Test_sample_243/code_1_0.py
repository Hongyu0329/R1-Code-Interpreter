    This function solves the riddle about the plant's island of origin.
    
    1. The plant in the image is identified as Daphniphyllum macropodum 'Variegatum'.
    2. This plant species is native to Japan, Korea, and China, not endemic to a single island.
    3. The question is a riddle. The solution lies in the history of the plant's discovery.
    4. Botanist Philipp Franz von Siebold, who first collected the specimens that led to the
       species' scientific description, was based on the small man-made island of Dejima
       in Nagasaki, Japan. This island was the only gateway for Westerners to Japan for centuries.
    5. Therefore, the specific island uniquely associated with this plant's introduction
       to Western science is Dejima.
