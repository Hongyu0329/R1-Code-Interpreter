    "To determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely, we need to analyze the steric hindrance around the single bond connecting each phenyl ring to the main structure.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant bonds:** We are interested in the rotation around the single C-C bond that connects each of the peripheral phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L) to the main ligand framework.\n2.  **Define free rotation:** Free rotation can occur around a single bond if there isn't a significant energy barrier. Large energy barriers are typically caused by steric hindrance, where bulky groups clash with each other during rotation.\n3.  **Analyze each ring's environment:**\n    *   **Rings H and J:** Ring H is attached to ring A at position 4. Ring J is attached to ring C at position 4. These are *para*-positions relative to the main backbone connections. They are located on the periphery of the molecule, far from the bulky Iridium center and other ligands. There is no significant steric barrier to prevent their rotation. Thus, **H and J can rotate freely**.\n    *   **Ring G:** Ring G is attached to the pyridyl ring D at position 6. While this is an *ortho*-position relative to the coordinating nitrogen, it's on the \"outside\" of the ligand, pointing away from the metal center. It is not sterically crowded by other parts of the complex. Therefore, **G can rotate freely**.\n    *   **Rings K and L:** These rings are attached at position 6 of phenyl rings A and C, respectively. These positions are *ortho* to the bonds involved in coordinating to the Iridium center (the C5-Ir interaction for A and the C2-Ir bond for C). Rotation of rings K and L would cause them to swing into the space occupied by the central Iridium atom and the adjacent coordinating ligands (E/F and B/D, respectively). This creates a very significant steric clash. Therefore, the rotation of **K and L is severely hindered**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, rings G, H, and J can rotate freely, while rings K and L cannot.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this reasoning to arrive at the correct set of rings.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rotation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines which phenyl rings in the given molecular structure can rotate freely.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Total set of peripheral phenyl rings\n    all_peripheral_rings = {'G', 'H', 'J', 'K', 'L'}\n    \n    # Rings whose rotation is restricted due to significant steric hindrance\n    # Rings K and L are at ortho positions (pos 6) to the coordinating C atoms of rings A and C.\n    # This proximity to the bulky Iridium coordination sphere prevents free rotation.\n    restricted_rings = {'K', 'L'}\n    \n    # Rings that can rotate freely are the ones not in the restricted set.\n    freely_rotating_rings = sorted(list(all_peripheral_rings - restricted_rings))\n    \n    print(\"Analysis of Phenyl Ring Rotation:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n    print(\"Total peripheral phenyl rings: G, H, J, K, L\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Identify rings with free rotation.\")\n    print(\"Rings G, H, and J are on the periphery, far from the central Iridium atom.\")\n    print(\"They are connected by single bonds with low steric hindrance, allowing free rotation.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Identify rings with restricted rotation.\")\n    print(\"Rings K and L are attached at 'ortho' positions relative to the Ir-C bonds.\")\n    print(\"Their rotation is blocked by steric clash with the metal center and other ligands.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(f\"The rings that can rotate freely are: {', '.join(freely_rotating_rings)}\")\n\nsolve_rotation()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
