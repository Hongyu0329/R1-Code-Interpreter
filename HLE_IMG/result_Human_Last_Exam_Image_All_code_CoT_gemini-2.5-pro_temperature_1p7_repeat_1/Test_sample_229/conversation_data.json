    "I have identified the musical piece based on its distinctive melody and chord progression. Although it is written in the key of C Major in the provided sheet music, it is a well-known jazz standard that is most commonly played in Eb Major. By transposing the melody and harmony, I was able to confirm its identity.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define a function to hold the information about the song.\n2.  Store the title, musical style, and country of origin in variables within the function.\n3.  Print each piece of information with a descriptive label.\n\n```python\ndef get_song_info():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides information about the song from the sheet music.\n  \"\"\"\n  title = \"Four\"\n  musical_style = \"Jazz (Hard Bop)\"\n  country_of_origin = \"USA\"\n\n  print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n  print(f\"Musical Style: {musical_style}\")\n  print(f\"Country of Origin: {country_of_origin}\")\n\nget_song_info()\n```\n<<<Title: Four, Musical Style: Jazz (Hard Bop), Country of Origin: USA>>>"
