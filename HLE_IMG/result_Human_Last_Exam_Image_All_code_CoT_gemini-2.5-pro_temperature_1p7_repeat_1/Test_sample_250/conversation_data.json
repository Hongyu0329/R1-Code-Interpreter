    "My plan to identify the jazz standard is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze Key and Melody:** I will first examine the key signature and the initial notes of the melody on the provided sheet music. The key signature has four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭), and the first chord is F minor, which strongly suggests the piece is in the key of F minor. The opening melodic phrase is very distinctive.\n2.  **Transcribe the Melody:** The first two measures of the melody in F minor are: C, C, E♭, D | C, B♭, A♭, G.\n3.  **Identify the Song:** This unique melodic contour is the main theme of the well-known jazz standard \"Yesterdays\".\n4.  **Identify the Composer:** I will then look up the composer of \"Yesterdays\", which is Jerome Kern.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that prints the title and composer of the song as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_jazz_standard_identity():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the title and composer of the jazz standard\n    based on the provided sheet music. The identification is made by recognizing\n    the iconic melody and chord progression.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Yesterdays\"\n    composer = \"Jerome Kern\"\n\n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nsolve_jazz_standard_identity()\n```\n<<<Title: Yesterdays, Composer: Jerome Kern>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
