Based on the provided text and diagram, the concept of 'salience' within this specific framework is defined by the properties of the simulation and its information, not by the learner's individual differences.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1.  **Framework's Focus:** The framework describes salience through four components: Access, Prominence, Simplicity, and Clarity.

2.  **Component Definitions:** The definitions of these components are based on the design of the simulation itself:
    *   **Access:** Refers to the physical availability of information within the simulation. This is a design choice.
    *   **Prominence:** Relates to how information is highlighted using cues within the simulation. This is a design choice.
    *   **Simplicity:** Describes the amount and complexity of the information presented by the simulation. This is a design choice.
    *   **Clarity:** Pertains to how unambiguous the information provided by the simulation is. This is a design choice.

3.  **Conclusion:** All four pillars of salience in this model are attributes that a simulation designer can control. The framework does not mention adjusting these attributes based on the learner's background, knowledge, or cognitive traits. Therefore, it treats salience as an objective feature of the diagnostic stimulus being presented.
