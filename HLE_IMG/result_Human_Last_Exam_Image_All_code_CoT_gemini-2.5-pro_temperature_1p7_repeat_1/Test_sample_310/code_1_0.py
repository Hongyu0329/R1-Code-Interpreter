# Step 1: Define the parameters for the missing simulation.
# The missing plot corresponds to a linear polymer.
# The initial degree of polymerization, N, is 20.
# The degradation level corresponds to m=1.
N = 20
m = 1

# Step 2: Calculate the degree of destruction, 'a'.
# a = m / 25
a = m / 25

# Step 3: Use the formula for the number-average degree of polymerization for linear polymers.
# Formula: N_n = N / (1 + (N - 1) * a)
N_n = N / (1 + (N - 1) * a)

# Step 4: Print the final calculation, showing all the numbers involved in the equation.
