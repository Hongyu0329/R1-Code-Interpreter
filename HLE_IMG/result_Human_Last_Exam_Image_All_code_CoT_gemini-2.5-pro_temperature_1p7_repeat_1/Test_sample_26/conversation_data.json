    "Here is my plan to determine the Roman numeral for measure 30:\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Signature:** The piece is Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8, \"Pathétique,\" Op. 13. The first movement is in C minor. The key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭).\n\n2.  **Locate and Analyze Measure 30:**\n    *   Looking at the score, measure 28 is marked. Measure 30 is two bars after that, the one prominently circled.\n    *   I will identify all the unique notes played in this measure across both the treble (right hand) and bass (left hand) clefs.\n\n3.  **Identify the notes:**\n    *   **Treble Clef (Right Hand):** The notes in the arpeggiated figure are C, E♭, F♯, and A.\n    *   **Bass Clef (Left Hand):** The notes played are an octave F♯ and a chord containing F♯ and C.\n    *   **Combined Notes:** The full collection of notes in this measure is F♯, A, C, and E♭.\n\n4.  **Determine the Chord and its Quality:**\n    *   I will stack these notes in thirds to build the chord and find its root.\n    *   Starting with F♯ as the root:\n        *   F♯ to A is a minor third.\n        *   F♯ to C is a diminished fifth.\n        *   F♯ to E♭ is a diminished seventh (enharmonically equivalent to D♯, but E♭ fits the key context).\n    *   This combination of root, minor third, diminished fifth, and diminished seventh forms an F-sharp diminished seventh chord (F♯°⁷).\n\n5.  **Analyze the Chord's Function in C Minor:**\n    *   The chord F♯°⁷ is not native to the C minor scale. It is a chromatic chord.\n    *   The dominant (V) chord in C minor is G major (G-B-D). The leading tone to G is F♯.\n    *   The F♯°⁷ chord is the leading-tone seventh chord of the dominant key (G). Therefore, its function is to lead strongly to the dominant chord.\n    *   This type of chord is called a secondary leading-tone chord or an applied dominant.\n\n6.  **Write the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   The Roman numeral for a leading-tone diminished seventh chord is `vii°⁷`.\n    *   Since it is applied to the dominant (V), the full Roman numeral is `vii°⁷/V`.\n\nI will now write a Python script to print this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_measure_30():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the harmony of measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, 1st mov.\n    and determines the correct Roman numeral.\n    \"\"\"\n    key = \"C minor\"\n    measure = 30\n    \n    # Notes identified from the score in measure 30\n    notes_in_chord = [\"F#\", \"A\", \"C\", \"Eb\"]\n    \n    # Chord analysis\n    root = \"F#\"\n    quality = \"diminished seventh\"\n    chord_name = f\"{root}°7\"\n    \n    # Functional analysis in the key of C minor\n    dominant_of_key = \"V (G major)\"\n    function_of_chord = \"The leading-tone chord to the dominant (G)\"\n    roman_numeral = \"vii°⁷/V\"\n    \n    # Print the step-by-step analysis and final answer\n    print(f\"Analysis of Beethoven 'Pathetique' Sonata, 1st mvt., measure {measure}:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"1.
