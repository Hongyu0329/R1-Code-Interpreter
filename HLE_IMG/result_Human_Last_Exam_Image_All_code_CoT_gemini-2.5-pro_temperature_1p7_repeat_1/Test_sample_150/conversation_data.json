    "This is a multi-step organic synthesis problem. I will track the transformation of the starting material through each reaction to identify the structure and name of each intermediate and the final product.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation.** Benzene reacts with propanoyl chloride in the presence of the Lewis acid AlCl₃. This reaction attaches the propanoyl group (-CO-CH₂-CH₃) to the benzene ring.\n    *   *Intermediate-1 is 1-phenylpropan-1-one (also known as propiophenone).*\n\n2.  **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination).** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone) is treated with Br₂ and FeBr₃. The acyl group (-COR) is an electron-withdrawing group that deactivates the ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the *meta* position.\n    *   *Intermediate-2 is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.*\n\n3.  **Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation/Hydrogenolysis.** Intermediate-2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This is a powerful reduction condition. It will reduce the ketone and also remove the halogen from the aromatic ring (hydrogenolysis). The benzylic ketone (-CO-) is reduced to a methylene group (-CH₂-), and the bromine atom is replaced by a hydrogen atom.\n    *   *Intermediate-3 is propylbenzene (C₆H₅-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃).*\n\n4.  **Step 4: Radical Bromination.** Intermediate-3 (propylbenzene) reacts with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of a radical initiator (benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂) and a non-polar solvent (CCl₄). This set of reagents is specific for brominating the benzylic position—the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring—because the resulting benzylic radical is resonance-stabilized.\n    *   A hydrogen atom on the benzylic carbon of propylbenzene is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   *The final product is 1-bromo-1-phenylpropane.*\n\nI will now generate a Python script to print this sequence and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function tracks the transformations in the given chemical reaction sequence\n    and identifies the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation ---\n    intermediate_1_name = \"1-phenylpropan-1-one (Propiophenone)\"\n    \n    # --- Step 2: Electrophilic Bromination ---\n    intermediate_2_name = \"1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\"\n    \n    # --- Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenolysis ---\n    intermediate_3_name = \"Propylbenzene\"\n    \n    # --- Step 4: Radical Benzylic Bromination ---\n    final_product_name = \"1-bromo-1-phenylpropane\"\n    \n    print(\"Tracking the reaction pathway:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Benzene reacts with propanoyl chloride and AlCl3.\")\n    print(f\"--> Intermediate-1: {intermediate_1_name}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n    \n    print(f\"Step 2: {intermediate_1_name} reacts with Br2/FeBr3.\")\n    print(f\"--> Intermediate-2: {intermediate_2_name}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n    \n    print(f\"Step 3: {intermediate_2_name} reacts with H2/Pd.\")\n    print(f\"--> Intermediate-3: {intermediate_3_name}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n    \n    print(f\"Step 4: {intermediate_3_name} reacts with NBS and a radical initiator.\")\n    print(f\"--> Final Product: {final_product_name}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 35)\n\n# Execute the function to display the result.\nsolve_reaction_sequence()\n```\n<<<1-bromo-1-phenylpropane>>>"
