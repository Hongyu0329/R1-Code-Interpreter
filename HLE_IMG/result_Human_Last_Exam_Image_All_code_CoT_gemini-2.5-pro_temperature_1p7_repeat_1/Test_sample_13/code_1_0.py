# Let the two top white squares be A (on the left) and B (on the right).
# Let the three cells in the column below A be c2, c3, and c4.

# From the puzzle clues, we establish a system of equations.

# The clue for the top row (sum of 2 cells) is 15.
# Equation 1: A + B = 15
row_sum = 15

# The clue for the leftmost column (sum of 4 cells) is 17.
# Equation 2: A + c2 + c3 + c4 = 17
col_sum_full = 17

# The clue for the column run starting at the second cell (sum of 3 cells) is 10.
# Equation 3: c2 + c3 + c4 = 10
col_sum_partial = 10

# We can find the value of A by substituting Equation 3 into Equation 2.
# This gives us the equation: A + 10 = 17.
# We can solve for A.
A = col_sum_full - col_sum_partial

# Now that we have A, we can find B using Equation 1.
# The equation becomes: 7 + B = 15.
# We can solve for B.
B = row_sum - A

# Print out the reasoning and the final answer.
