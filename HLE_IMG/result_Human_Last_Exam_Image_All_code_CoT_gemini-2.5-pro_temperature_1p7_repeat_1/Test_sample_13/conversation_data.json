    "My approach to solving this Kakuro puzzle is to deduce the values of the two top squares by setting up and solving a system of equations based on the puzzle's clues.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Let the two numbers in the top-most white squares be `A` (left) and `B` (right).\n2.  From the clue `15` to the left of the top row, establish the first equation: `A + B = 15`.\n3.  Analyze the leftmost column, which starts with `A`. There are two clues governing this column: `17` and `10`.\n4.  The clue `17` is for the entire column run, which consists of 4 cells. Let's represent this as `A + (sum of the other 3 cells in the column) = 17`.\n5.  The clue `10` is for the part of the column starting from the second cell, which is a run of 3 cells. This means `(sum of the other 3 cells in the column) = 10`.\n6.  Substitute the value from step 5 into the equation from step 4 to solve for `A`.\n7.  Once `A` is known, use the equation from step 2 to solve for `B`.\n8.  The resulting `A` and `B` are the numbers in the two top squares.\n\nThis step-by-step logical deduction can be implemented in a simple Python script.\n\n```python\n# Let the two top white squares be A (on the left) and B (on the right).\n# Let the three cells in the column below A be c2, c3, and c4.\n\n# From the puzzle clues, we establish a system of equations.\n\n# The clue for the top row (sum of 2 cells) is 15.\n# Equation 1: A + B = 15\nrow_sum = 15\n\n# The clue for the leftmost column (sum of 4 cells) is 17.\n# Equation 2: A + c2 + c3 + c4 = 17\ncol_sum_full = 17\n\n# The clue for the column run starting at the second cell (sum of 3 cells) is 10.\n# Equation 3: c2 + c3 + c4 = 10\ncol_sum_partial = 10\n\n# We can find the value of A by substituting Equation 3 into Equation 2.\n# This gives us the equation: A + 10 = 17.\n# We can solve for A.\nA = col_sum_full - col_sum_partial\n\n# Now that we have A, we can find B using Equation 1.\n# The equation becomes: 7 + B = 15.\n# We can solve for B.\nB = row_sum - A\n\n# Print out the reasoning and the final answer.\nprint(\"Step 1: Define the relationship for the column containing the left top square (A).\")\nprint(f\"The sum of the entire 4-cell column is {col_sum_full}.\")\nprint(f\"The sum of the bottom 3 cells of that column is given by another clue as {col_sum_partial}.\")\nprint(f\"This gives us the equation for A: A + {col_sum_partial} = {col_sum_full}\")\nprint(f\"Solving for A, we get A = {col_sum_full} - {col_sum_partial} = {A}.\")\n\nprint(\"\\nStep 2: Define the relationship for the row containing both squares (A and B).\")\nprint(f\"The sum of the top 2-cell row is {row_sum}.\")\nprint(f\"This gives us the equation: A + B = {row_sum}\")\nprint(f\"Substituting A = {A}, we get: {A} + B = {row_sum}\")\nprint(f\"Solving for B, we get B = {row_sum} - {A} = {B}.\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nTherefore, the two numbers in the top white squares are {A} and {B}.\")\n<<<7,8>>>\n```"
