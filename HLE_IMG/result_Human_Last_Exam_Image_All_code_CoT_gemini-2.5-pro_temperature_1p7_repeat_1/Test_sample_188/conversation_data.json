    "To compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) of the given graph G, we can use the deletion-contraction principle. The principle states that for any edge 'e' in a graph G, the chromatic polynomial is given by P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k), where G-e is the graph with edge 'e' deleted, and G/e is the graph with edge 'e' contracted.\n\nLet's outline the plan:\n1.  Let G be the graph from the figure. We'll choose an edge `e` to apply the deletion-contraction rule. A good choice is an edge within a cycle, for example, `e = (4, 5)`.\n2.  The formula becomes `P(G, k) = P(G - (4,5), k) - P(G / (4,5), k)`.\n3.  We will compute the chromatic polynomial for the two simpler graphs: `G' = G - (4,5)` and `G'' = G / (4,5)`.\n4.  The graph `G''` is simple enough to have its polynomial computed directly.\n5.  The graph `G'` is still complex, so we'll apply deletion-contraction again on it.\n6.  Finally, we will combine the results to find the polynomial for the original graph G.\n\nThe following Python code will print out the steps of this derivation and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step derivation of the chromatic polynomial\n    for the given graph and prints the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the graph G and choose an edge 'e' for Deletion-Contraction.\")\n    print(\"Let G be the graph in the figure.
