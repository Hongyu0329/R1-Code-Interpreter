    "I have identified the artwork by analyzing its distinct features: a prominent windmill set against a dramatic, stormy sky with a fire glowing in the background. This style is characteristic of 19th-century Romanticism, particularly Dutch landscape painting. A search for \"19th-century painting windmill fire\" leads to the Dutch artist Andreas Schelfhout and his work on this subject. The specific painting is often titled \"The Burning of a Windmill\" or more precisely \"The Burning of the 'De Riek' Windmill\".\n\nThe following Python code will print the title of the painting.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the title of the identified painting.\n    \"\"\"\n    painting_title = \"The Burning of a Windmill\"\n    print(f\"The title of the painting is: {painting_title}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<The Burning of a Windmill>>>"
