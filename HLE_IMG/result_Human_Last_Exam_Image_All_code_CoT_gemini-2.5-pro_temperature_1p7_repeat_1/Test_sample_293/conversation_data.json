    "This image displays a renal glomerulus with severe pathological changes. The most striking feature is the presence of a large, cellular, crescent-shaped structure occupying Bowman's space and compressing the glomerular tuft. This is known as a \"cellular crescent\" and is formed by the proliferation of parietal epithelial cells along with an influx of inflammatory cells like macrophages. The glomerular tuft itself is hypercellular and contains eosinophilic, fibrillar material suggestive of fibrin deposition (fibrinoid necrosis).\n\nThese findings—prominent cellular crescents, glomerular hypercellularity, and fibrinoid necrosis—are the classic histopathological hallmarks of **Crescentic Glomerulonephritis**. This is the morphological counterpart to the clinical syndrome of Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN).\n\nTherefore, the histopathological diagnosis is Crescentic Glomerulonephritis.\n\n<<<Crescentic Glomerulonephritis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
