    # The question asks for the theoretical stress at the tip of the wedge (point A).

    # In the framework of linear elasticity theory, a sharp re-entrant corner
    # like the tip of the wedge is a geometric singularity.
    
    # The relationship between the maximum stress (σ_max) at the notch and the
    # nominal applied stress (σ_y) is given by the stress concentration factor, K_t.
    # Equation: σ_max = K_t * σ_y

    # For a theoretically perfect sharp corner, the radius of curvature at the tip is zero.
    # This leads to a theoretical stress concentration factor (K_t) that is infinite.
