# The user wants me to solve the visual puzzle and provide the answer.
# I have analyzed the images based on the unique coat patterns of the giraffes.

# Step 1: Analyze the prominent and unique spot patterns on the target giraffe.
# I identified a key forked ('Y'-shape) pattern on the shoulder and an 'H'-like pattern on the mid-torso.

# Step 2: Compare these key patterns with each of the options (A, B, C, D, E, F).

# Step 3: Conclude which option has a pattern that matches the target.
# - Image A: Incorrect color and pattern.
# - Image B: The patterns, including the key 'Y' and 'H' shapes, are a clear match.
# - Image C: Incorrect color and pattern.
# - Image D: Incorrect color and pattern.
# - Image E: Incorrect pattern.
# - Image F: Incorrect pattern.

# The correct image is B. I will print the answer.
correct_image = 'B'
