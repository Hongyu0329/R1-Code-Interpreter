# Step 1 & 2: Determine the radii of the circles.
# The image coordinates are given in cm. Let the bottom-left corner be (0,0).
# The prompt states "Center of the first yellow circle is (4,0.5)".
# From the image, a yellow circle in the bottom row touches the bottom edge (y=0).
# The y-coordinate of its center is equal to its radius.
# Therefore, the radius of a yellow circle is 0.5 cm.
r_y = 0.5
print(f"From the provided information, the radius of a yellow circle (r_y) is {r_y} cm.")

# A yellow circle sits in the cusp between two larger white circles and the bottom boundary.
# Let's find the radius of the white circles (r_w).
# Consider a coordinate system where the center of the yellow circle is (0, r_y).
# Its neighboring white circles have centers at (r_w, r_w) and (-r_w, r_w) relative to a point between them.
# A right triangle is formed by the center of a white circle (x1, r_w), the center of the yellow circle (x2, r_y),
# and the point (x1, r_y). The sides are (x2-x1), (r_w-r_y), and the hypotenuse is (r_w+r_y) as they are tangent.
# (x2-x1) is r_w. So, by the Pythagorean theorem: r_w^2 + (r_w - r_y)^2 = (r_w + r_y)^2
# Expanding this gives: r_w^2 + r_w^2 - 2*r_w*r_y + r_y^2 = r_w^2 + 2*r_w*r_y + r_y^2
# This simplifies to: r_w^2 = 4*r_w*r_y. Since r_w is not zero, we divide by r_w.
# The relationship is: r_w = 4 * r_y
r_w = 4 * r_y
print(f"The relationship between the radii is r_w = 4 * r_y.")
print(f"The radius of a white circle (r_w) is 4 * {r_y} = {r_w} cm.")

# Step 3: Check for a gap between yellow and white circles.
print("\n--- Question 1: Is there any gap between yellow and white circles? ---")
# Let's verify this by checking the distance between a specific yellow and white circle.
# Let's use the first white circle, which touches the left edge (x=0). Its center is at (r_w, r_w).
center_w1 = (r_w, r_w)
# The first yellow circle's center is given as (4, 0.5).
center_y1 = (4, 0.5)

# Calculate the distance between their centers.
dist_wy = math.sqrt((center_w1[0] - center_y1[0])**2 + (center_w1[1] - center_y1[1])**2)

print(f"Calculated distance = {dist_wy:.4f} cm.")

# Calculate the sum of their radii.
sum_radii_wy = r_w + r_y
print(f"Equation for sum of radii: s = {r_w} + {r_y}")
print(f"Sum of radii = {sum_radii_wy} cm.")

# If distance equals the sum of radii, they are tangent (no gap).

    answer1 = "N"

    answer1 = "Y"
    print("Result: There is a gap.")

# Step 4: Check for a gap between white circles in the first and second rows.
print("\n--- Question 2: Is there any gap between white circles in the first and second row? ---")
# White circles in different rows are also tangent. Let's verify this.
# Let's use the first white circle in row 1, with center at (r_w, r_w).
center_w_row1 = (r_w, r_w)
# The first white circle in row 2 is in the dip between the first two white circles of row 1.
# Its x-coordinate is r_w + r_w = 2*r_w, however the problem states the first yellow circle is at x=4 which is between the first two white circles, meaning the second white circle is at x=r_w+2r_w = 6. So the x-coordinate of the middle row white circle is x=4. Let's calculate its y coordinate.
x_w_row2 = 4.0
# The distance between centers of two tangent white circles is r_w + r_w = 2*r_w.
# We use the distance formula to find the y-coordinate of the second row circle.
# (x_w_row2 - center_w_row1[0])^2 + (y_w_row2 - center_w_row1[1])^2 = (2*r_w)^2
# (4 - 2)^2 + (y_w_row2 - 2)^2 = (2*2)^2 -> 4 + (y_w_row2 - 2)^2 = 16 -> (y_w_row2 - 2)^2 = 12
y_w_row2 = r_w + math.sqrt(12)
center_w_row2 = (x_w_row2, y_w_row2)

# Calculate the distance between their centers.
dist_ww = math.sqrt((center_w_row1[0] - center_w_row2[0])**2 + (center_w_row1[1] - center_w_row2[1])**2)
print(f"Equation for distance between centers: d = sqrt(({center_w_row1[0]} - {center_w_row2[0]})^2 + ({center_w_row1[1]} - {center_w_row2[1]:.4f})^2)")
print(f"Calculated distance = {dist_ww:.4f} cm.")

# Calculate the sum of their radii.
sum_radii_ww = r_w + r_w
print(f"Equation for sum of radii: s = {r_w} + {r_w}")
print(f"Sum of radii = {sum_radii_ww} cm.")

# If distance equals sum of radii, they are tangent (no gap).
if math.isclose(dist_ww, sum_radii_ww):
    answer2 = "N"
    print("Result: No gap.")
else:
    answer2 = "Y"
    print("Result: There is a gap.")
