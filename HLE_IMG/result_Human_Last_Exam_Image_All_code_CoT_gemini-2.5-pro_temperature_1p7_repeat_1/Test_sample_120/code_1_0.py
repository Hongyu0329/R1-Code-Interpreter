    print("2. The methyl group is added as a lateral substituent on the mesogenic core.")
    print("3. This methyl group adds steric bulk, which prevents the molecules from packing closely together. This disruption of packing weakens the overall intermolecular attractive forces.")
    
    print("\n4. Conclusion for Part 2:")
    print("A less stable nematic phase will transition to the disordered isotropic liquid phase at a lower temperature.")
