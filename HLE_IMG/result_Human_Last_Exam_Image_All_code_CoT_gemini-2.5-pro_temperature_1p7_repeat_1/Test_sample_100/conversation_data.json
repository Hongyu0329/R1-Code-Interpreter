    "To determine the molecular formula of the product, we will follow the reaction scheme step by step, calculating the change in atoms at each stage.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material**\n\nThe starting material is N-(p-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. Let's count its atoms:\n*   Bicyclic core (2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one): This consists of 6 carbons, 5 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, and 1 oxygen (from the C=O group). Formula: C6H5NO.\n*   Trifluoromethyl group (CF3): This adds 1 carbon and 3 fluorine atoms. Formula: CF3.\n*   p-Methoxybenzyl group (PMB): This group has the formula C8H9O (a benzene ring C6H4, a methylene bridge CH2, and a methoxy group OCH3).\n\nSumming these up gives the molecular formula of the starting material:\n*   Carbons (C): 6 (core) + 1 (CF3) + 8 (PMB) = 15\n*   Hydrogens (H): 5 (core) + 9 (PMB) = 14\n*   Fluorines (F): 3 (CF3) = 3\n*   Nitrogens (N): 1 (core) = 1\n*   Oxygens (O): 1 (core) + 1 (PMB) = 2\nSo, the starting material's formula is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Reaction 1 (PMB Deprotection)**\n\n*   Reagents: CAN in ACN/H2O.\n*   This reaction removes the PMB protecting group (C8H9O) from the nitrogen atom and replaces it with a hydrogen atom.\n*   Change in atoms: -C8, -H9, -O1 (from removing PMB) and +H1 (adding to N).\n*   Net change: -C8, -H8, -O1.\n*   Formula of Intermediate 1: C(15-8)H(14-8)F3N(1)O(2-1) = **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Reaction 2 (Hydrogenation)**\n\n*   Reagents: Pd/C, H2.\n*   This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which reduces the C=C double bond in the ring.\n*   One molecule of H2 is added across the double bond.\n*   Change in atoms: +H2.\n*   Formula of Intermediate 2: C7H(6+2)F3NO = **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n**Step 4: Reaction 3 (Lactam Hydrolysis)**\n\n*   Reagents: 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n*   These are conditions for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the lactam (a cyclic amide).\n*   The hydrolysis reaction breaks the amide C-N bond by adding one molecule of water (H2O). This opens the bicyclic ring system to form an amino acid.\n*   Change in atoms: +H2, +O1.\n*   Formula of the final product: C7H(8+2)F3NO(1+1) = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\nThe following Python code performs these calculations to arrive at the final molecular formula.\n\n```python\ndef solve_molecular_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product from the given reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the molecular formula of the starting material.\n    # Starting Material: N-(p-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one\n    # C: 6(core) + 1(CF3) + 8(PMB) = 15\n    # H: 5(core) + 9(PMB) = 14\n    # F: 3(CF3) = 3\n    # N: 1(core) = 1\n    # O: 1(core) + 1(PMB) = 2\n    # Formula: C15H14F3NO2\n    initial_C = 15\n    initial_H = 14\n    initial_F = 3\n    initial_N = 1\n    initial_O = 2\n    \n    print(\"Starting Material Formula: C{}H{}F{}NO{}\".format(initial_C, initial_H, initial_F, initial_O))\n    print(\"---\")\n\n    # Step 2: Reaction 1 - PMB deprotection with CAN.\n    # This removes the PMB group (C8H9O) and adds one hydrogen (H).\n    # Net change: C: -8, H: -9 + 1 = -8, O: -1\n    C_intermediate1 = initial_C - 8\n    H_intermediate1 = initial_H - 8\n    O_intermediate1 = initial_O - 1\n    \n    print(\"After Step 1 (PMB deprotection):\")\n    print(f\"C = {initial_C} - 8 = {C_intermediate1}\")\n    print(f\"H = {initial_H} - 9 + 1 = {H_intermediate1}\")\n    print(f\"O = {initial_O} - 1 = {O_intermediate1}\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate 1 Formula: C{C_intermediate1}H{H_intermediate1}F{initial_F}NO{O_intermediate1}\")\n    print(\"---\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Reaction 2 - Hydrogenation of C=C bond with Pd/C, H2.\n    # This adds one molecule of hydrogen (H2).\n    # Net change: H: +2\n    H_intermediate2 = H_intermediate1 + 2\n\n    print(\"After Step 2 (Hydrogenation):\")\n    print(f\"H = {H_intermediate1} + 2 = {H_intermediate2}\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate 2 Formula: C{C_intermediate1}H{H_intermediate2}F{initial_F}NO{O_intermediate1}\")\n    print(\"---\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Reaction 3 - Hydrolysis of the lactam with acid.\n    # This adds one molecule of water (H2O).\n    # Net change: H: +2, O: +1\n    product_C = C_intermediate1\n    product_H = H_intermediate2 + 2\n    product_F = initial_F\n    product_N = initial_N\n    product_O = O_intermediate1 + 1\n    \n    print(\"After Step 3 (Lactam Hydrolysis):\")\n    print(f\"H = {H_intermediate2} + 2 = {product_H}\")\n    print(f\"O = {O_intermediate1} + 1 = {product_O}\")\n    print(\"---\")\n    \n    # Final Result\n    print(\"The molecular formula of the final product is:\")\n    print(f\"C{product_C}H{product_H}F{product_F}NO{product_O}\")\n\nsolve_molecular_formula()\n```\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
