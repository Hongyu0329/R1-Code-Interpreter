    "To determine the country of the viewpoint, I will analyze the astronomical information provided in the image.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Extract Data**: Note the date, time, and timezone (2024-10-22 20:07:37 CEST) from the image. Identify the visible celestial objects: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Vega, and Capella.\n2.  **Determine General Location**: The timezone CEST (Central European Summer Time, UTC+2) is used by most countries in Central Europe. This narrows down the possible location significantly.\n3.  **Select a Representative Location**: I will choose a major city within the CEST zone, such as Berlin, Germany, as a reference point for calculation. The view of the stars will be very similar across this entire region.\n4.  **Simulate the Sky**: Using Python with the `skyfield` library, I will calculate the precise positions (altitude and azimuth) of the identified stars and planets as they would appear from the representative location at the exact time specified.\n5.  **Compare and Conclude**: I will compare the calculated positions with their appearance in the image to confirm that the location is consistent with a country like Germany. For instance, objects in the eastern sky should be on the left side of a south-facing view, and objects in the western sky on the right.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the sky simulation:\n\n```python\nfrom skyfield.api import Star, load, Topos\nfrom skyfield.data import hipparcos\n\ndef find_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the sky from the image to determine the viewpoint country.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Setup libraries and load astronomical data\n    ts = load.timescale()\n    eph = load('de421.bsp')\n    with load.open(hipparcos.URL) as f:\n        stars = hipparcos.load_dataframe(f)\n\n    # 2. Define the time from the image: 2024-10-22 20:07:37 CEST (UTC+2)\n    # CEST is UTC+2, so 20:07 CEST is 18:07 UTC.\n    t = ts.utc(2024, 10, 22, 18, 7, 37)\n\n    # 3. Choose a representative location in the CEST timezone. Germany is a central example.\n    # We will use Berlin's coordinates.\n    country = \"Germany\"\n    city = \"Berlin\"\n    location = Topos('52.5200 N', '13.4050 E')\n    observer = eph['earth'] + location\n\n    # 4.
