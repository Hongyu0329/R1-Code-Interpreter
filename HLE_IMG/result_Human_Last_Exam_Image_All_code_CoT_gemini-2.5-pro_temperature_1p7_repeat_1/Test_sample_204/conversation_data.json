    "The task requires identifying four mineral specimens (A, B, C, D) and arranging them in order of increasing complexity of their silicate structures.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Identify each mineral specimen** based on its visual characteristics (color, crystal habit, cleavage).\n    *   **A:** A dark, stubby prismatic crystal, characteristic of a **pyroxene** group mineral. Pyroxenes are single-chain silicates (inosilicates).\n    *   **B:** A thin, flaky, sheet-like specimen, characteristic of a **mica** group mineral. Micas are sheet silicates (phyllosilicates).\n    *   **C:** A granular mass of olive-green crystals, characteristic of **olivine**. Olivine is an isolated tetrahedra silicate (nesosilicate).\n    *   **D:** A translucent, glassy crystal with six-sided prism habit and conchoidal fracture, characteristic of **quartz**. Quartz is a framework silicate (tectosilicate).\n2.  **Understand silicate structure complexity.** The complexity increases with the number of shared oxygen atoms per silica tetrahedron:\n    *   **Nesosilicates** (isolated tetrahedra, 0 shared oxygens): Least complex. (Olivine)\n    *   **Inosilicates** (single chains, 2 shared oxygens): More complex. (Pyroxene)\n    *   **Phyllosilicates** (sheets, 3 shared oxygens): Even more complex. (Mica)\n    *   **Tectosilicates** (frameworks, 4 shared oxygens): Most complex. (Quartz)\n3.  **Order the specimens** based on this hierarchy of complexity. The order will be: Olivine (C), Pyroxene (A), Mica (B), Quartz (D).\n4.  **Write Python code** to formalize this process, assign a complexity score to each structure, sort the specimens, and print the final ordered list.\n\n```python\ndef order_silicates():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies mineral specimens and orders them by increasing silicate structure complexity.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define mineral data with a numerical complexity score.\n    # The complexity is based on the degree of polymerization of silica tetrahedra.\n    # 1: Nesosilicate (isolated)\n    # 2: Inosilicate (single chain)\n    # 3: Phyllosilicate (sheet)\n    # 4: Tectosilicate (framework)\n    specimens = [\n        {'id': 'A', 'mineral': 'Pyroxene', 'structure': 'Inosilicate (single chain)', 'complexity': 2},\n        {'id': 'B', 'mineral': 'Mica', 'structure': 'Phyllosilicate (sheet)', 'complexity': 3},\n        {'id': 'C', 'mineral': 'Olivine', 'structure': 'Nesosilicate (isolated tetrahedra)', 'complexity': 1},\n        {'id': 'D', 'mineral': 'Quartz', 'structure': 'Tectosilicate (framework)', 'complexity': 4}\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Specimen Identification and Silicate Structure:\")\n    # Sort alphabetically for clear initial presentation\n    for spec in sorted(specimens, key=lambda x: x['id']):\n        print(f\"Specimen {spec['id']}: {spec['mineral']}, a {spec['structure']}.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Sort specimens based on their structural complexity\n    sorted_specimens = sorted(specimens, key=lambda x: x['complexity'])\n\n    # Step 4: Extract the ordered list of IDs\n    ordered_ids = [spec['id'] for spec in sorted_specimens]\n\n    print(\"\\nOrder of increasing silicate structure complexity:\")\n    # Print the final ordered list\n    print(\" -> \".join(ordered_ids))\n\norder_silicates()\n<<<C -> A -> B -> D>>>"
