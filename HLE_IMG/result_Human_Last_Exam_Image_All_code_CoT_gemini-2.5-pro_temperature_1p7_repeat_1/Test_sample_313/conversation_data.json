    "This is a two-part riddle. Let's break it down.\n\n**Part 1: The Image and the Event**\nThe image shows an awards ceremony. The date provided is June 20, 2019. A search for major awards ceremonies on this date leads to the 2019 NHL Awards in Las Vegas. The man receiving the award is identifiable as hockey player Nikita Kucherov. On that night, he won three major awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player as voted by players), and the Art Ross Trophy (top point scorer). Winning three major awards is often referred to as a \"hat trick\". The term \"hat trick\" in sports is a significant achievement, creating a link to the word \"hat\".\n\n**Part 2: The Mercury Clue**\nThe second sentence states, \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This points to the historic manufacturing process of felt hats. For centuries, mercury nitrate was used in a process called \"carroting\" to turn fur into felt for high-quality hats. The exposure to mercury vapors caused neurological damage in hat makers, a condition known as \"mad hatter disease,\" which gave rise to the phrase \"mad as a hatter.\" This dangerous process has been abandoned.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe first part of the clue points to a hockey \"hat trick,\" linking to the word \"hat.\" The second part describes the historical making of a \"felt hat\" using mercury. Therefore, X Y is a **Felt hat**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function solves the riddle by identifying the two parts of the clue\n  and printing the final answer.\n  \"\"\"\n  x = \"Felt\"\n  y = \"hat\"\n\n  print(f\"The first word, X, is: {x}\")\n  print(f\"The second word, Y, is: {y}\")\n  print(f\"The complete term X Y is: {x} {y}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Felt hat>>>"
