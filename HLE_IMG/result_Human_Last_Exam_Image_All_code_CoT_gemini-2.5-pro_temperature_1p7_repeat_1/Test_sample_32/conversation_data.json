    "The user wants to know the primary visual difference between the sporophytes of two moss species: *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. My plan is to identify this key characteristic from botanical knowledge and then present this information using a Python script as requested.\n\n1.  **Identify the key botanical difference:** The most significant and easily observable difference in the sporophytes of these two species lies in the **seta**, which is the stalk that holds the spore capsule.\n2.  **Describe *Grimmia montana*:** Its seta is short and straight. This causes the capsule to be held upright (erect), usually nestled amongst the leaves.\n3.  **Describe *Grimmia curviseta*:** Its name gives a clue. \"Curvi-\" means curved and \"-seta\" refers to the stalk. This species has a strongly curved, often S-shaped seta. This causes the capsule to hang downwards or to the side (it is described as nodding or pendent).\n4.  **Formulate the conclusion:** The orientation of the capsule, determined by the straight vs. curved seta, is the main difference to distinguish them at a glance.\n5.  **Create the Python script:** I will write a Python script that prints this explanation clearly.\n\n```python\ndef distinguish_grimmia_species():\n  \"\"\"\n  Explains the main visual difference in the sporophytes of\n  Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n  \"\"\"\n  species1_name = \"Grimmia montana\"\n  species1_feature = \"a short, straight seta, which results in an erect capsule.\"\n\n  species2_name = \"Grimmia curviseta\"\n  species2_feature = \"a strongly curved or arcuate seta, which causes the capsule to be nodding or pendent (hanging down).\"\n\n  print(\"The main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta lies in the seta (the stalk) and the resulting orientation of the capsule:\")\n  print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*70)\n  print(f\"{species1_name}:\")\n  print(f\"  - The sporophyte has {species1_feature}\")\n  print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*70)\n  print(f\"{species2_name}:\")\n  print(f\"  - The sporophyte has {species2_feature}\")\n  print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*70)\n  print(\"\\nIn summary, you can distinguish them at a glance by looking for an erect capsule (G. montana) versus a hanging or nodding capsule (G. curviseta).\")\n\ndistinguish_grimmia_species()\n```\n<<<The main difference is in the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight, holding the capsule erect. In *Grimmia curviseta*, the seta is strongly curved, causing the capsule to be nodding or hanging down.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant.
