    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine which complexes have shorter lifetimes:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structures:** All four molecules are Iridium(III) complexes with a general formula of `[Ir(C^N)₂(N^N)]⁺`. The core Iridium ion and the bidentate `N^N` ligand (di-tert-butyl bipyridine) are the same in all four complexes. The only difference is in the cyclometalating `C^N` ligands, which are all derivatives of 2-phenylpyridine (ppy).\n\n2.  **Relate Structure to Stability:** The operational lifetime of these complexes in a Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cell (LEC) is closely related to their chemical stability. A major factor governing the stability of cyclometalated ppy complexes is steric hindrance. Specifically, a substituent at the C6' position of the phenyl ring (the carbon adjacent to the inter-ring bond, but not bonded to iridium) can clash with the hydrogen atom on the C3 position of the pyridine ring. This steric strain distorts the molecule, weakens the metal-ligand bonds, and makes the complex more susceptible to degradation, thus shortening its lifetime.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Complex:**\n    *   **Complex 2** is the baseline, using an unsubstituted 2-phenylpyridine ligand. The C6' position has only a small hydrogen atom, so steric hindrance is minimal. It is considered relatively stable.\n    *   **Complex 1** has two fluorine atoms on each phenyl ring. However, by inspecting the diagram, these fluorine atoms are not at the sterically crowded C6' position. Fluorination at other positions generally increases stability by strengthening C-F bonds over C-H bonds. Therefore, Complex 1 is expected to be stable.\n    *   **Complex 3** clearly shows a fluorine atom substituted at the C6' position of the phenyl ring. This F atom will sterically clash with the hydrogen on the adjacent pyridine ring, leading to instability and a shorter lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 4** also has a fluorine atom at the C6' position, just like Complex 3. The presence of this substituent is a dominant factor that induces steric strain and destabilizes the complex, regardless of the other fluorine atoms present. Thus, Complex 4 is also expected to have a shorter lifetime.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Complexes 3 and 4 both contain a structural flaw (a substituent at the C6' position) that leads to steric hindrance and decreased stability. Therefore, they are expected to exhibit shorter lifetimes compared to Complexes 1 and 2.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_complex_stability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the stability of four Iridium complexes based on their structure.\n\n    The stability, and thus the device lifetime, of 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) based Iridium\n    complexes is highly sensitive to steric hindrance.
