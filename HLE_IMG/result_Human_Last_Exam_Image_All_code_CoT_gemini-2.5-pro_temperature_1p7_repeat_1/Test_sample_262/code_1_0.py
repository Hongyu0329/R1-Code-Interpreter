    """
    Analyzes the stability of four Iridium complexes based on their structure.

    The stability, and thus the device lifetime, of 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) based Iridium
    complexes is highly sensitive to steric hindrance. A substituent at the C6' position
    of the phenyl ring (ortho to the C-C bond with pyridine) causes steric clash with
    the C3-H of the pyridine ring, destabilizing the complex.

    This analysis identifies which complexes have this destabilizing feature.
