    # 1. Identify the key functional group in the reactant.
    # The reactant is a tertiary allylic alcohol.
    # The hydroxyl (-OH) group is on carbon 7.
    # The adjacent double bond is between carbon 1 and carbon 2.
    alcohol_carbon = 7

    # 2. Identify the reaction type and its outcome.
    # The reagent is PCC (pyridinium chlorochromate).
    # The reaction is a Babler-Dauben oxidation, which causes an oxidative rearrangement.
    # The overall transformation is: -C(OH)-Ca=Cb-  -->  -C=Ca-Cb(=O)-

    # 3. Apply the rule to the specific atoms in the molecule.
    # The alcohol is on C7. The adjacent double bond is C1=C2.
    # So, Ca is C1 and Cb is C2.
    carbonyl_position = double_bond_carbons[1]

    # 4. Print the reasoning and the result.
