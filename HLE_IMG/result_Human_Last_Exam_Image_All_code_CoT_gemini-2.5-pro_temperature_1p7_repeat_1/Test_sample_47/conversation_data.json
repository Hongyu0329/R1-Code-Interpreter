    "To find the value of the current I, we will use nodal analysis on the circuit.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Interpret the Circuit Diagram:** First, we need to establish the topology of the circuit. Based on the standard layout conventions for such diagrams, we'll make the following interpretation:\n    *   The 41 V battery is the power source for the entire circuit. The negative terminal is connected to the ground (0 V), and the positive terminal (at 41 V) is connected to the main supply lines.\n    *   We identify three key nodes with unknown potentials: `Va`, `Vb`, and `Vc`.\n        *   `Va`: The junction connecting the 8 Ω resistor and the 14 Ω resistor.\n        *   `Vb`: The junction connecting the 76 Ω, 14 Ω, and 11 Ω resistors.\n        *   `Vc`: The junction connecting the 11 Ω resistor and the 29 Ω resistor.\n    *   The positive terminal of the source (41 V) is connected to the start of the branches with resistors 76 Ω and 8 Ω. Crucially, we'll assume the wire labeled with the current `I` connects the 41 V source directly to `Node Vc`. This is a common, though sometimes confusing, way to draw such a connection.\n2.  **Apply Nodal Analysis:** With the topology defined, we can write Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) equations for the unknown nodes `Va` and `Vb`. Since the source is connected directly to `Vc`, its potential is known: `Vc = 41 V`.\n3.  **Solve the Equations:** We will solve the resulting system of two linear equations to find the values of `Va` and `Vb`.\n4.  **Calculate Current I:** Once all node potentials are known, we can find the current `I`. According to our model and KCL at `Node Vc`, the current `I` flowing from the source into `Vc` must equal the sum of the currents leaving `Vc` through the resistors connected to it (R4 = 11 Ω and R5 = 29 Ω).\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final value.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define circuit parameters from the schematic\nV_s = 41.0  # Source Voltage (V)\nR_76 = 76.0 # Resistor (Ohms)\nR_8 = 8.0   # Resistor (Ohms)\nR_14 = 14.0 # Resistor (Ohms)\nR_11 = 11.0 # Resistor (Ohms)\nR_29 = 29.0 # Resistor (Ohms)\nV_gnd = 0.0 # Ground Voltage (V)\n\nprint(\"Circuit Analysis Steps:\")\nprint(\"1.
