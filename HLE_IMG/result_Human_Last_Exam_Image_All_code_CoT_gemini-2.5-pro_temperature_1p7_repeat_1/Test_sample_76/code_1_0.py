def find_substitution_sites():
  """
  This function determines the four theoretically possible pairs of carbon atoms
  substituted with a carboxylic acid in the given double Favorskii rearrangement.
  The logic is based on two competing mechanisms for each rearrangement.

  For the top rearrangement (-CO- group between C2 and C6, Br at C2):
  - Enolate pathway leads to substitution at the enolizable carbon, C6.
  - Migration pathway leads to substitution at a migrating carbon, we consider C1.
  So, the first COOH can be at position 1 or 6.

  For the bottom rearrangement (-CO- group between C7 and C8, Br at C8):
  - Enolate pathway leads to substitution at the enolizable carbon, C7.
  - Migration pathway leads to substitution at a migrating carbon, we consider C4.
  So, the second COOH can be at position 4 or 7.

  Combining these possibilities gives 2x2 = 4 pairs.
