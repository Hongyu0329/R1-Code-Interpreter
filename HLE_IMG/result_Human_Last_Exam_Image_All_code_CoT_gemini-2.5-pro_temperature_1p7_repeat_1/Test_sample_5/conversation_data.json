    "Based on a detailed analysis of the sheet music provided, I can identify the piece.\n\nHere's my step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Initial Impression:** The musical style is highly virtuosic and complex, with dense chordal writing, a wide dynamic range, and rich, chromatic harmonies. This is characteristic of late Romantic composers, particularly Sergei Rachmaninoff.\n2.  **Key and Time Signature:** The key signature is one flat (suggesting F Major or D minor), the time signature is 4/4, and the tempo is moderately slow at ♩= 80.\n3.  **Melody and Harmony:** The piece begins with a pickup G-G, leading into a melody that descends through G-F-Eb-D-C over a C minor arpeggio in the left hand. This initial harmony (a C minor chord in a piece with a D minor/F major key signature) and the subsequent rapid modulations (indicated by the heavy use of accidentals like F#, C#, and G# in measure 4) are common in advanced piano works.\n4.  **Verification:** While the style is very similar to Rachmaninoff, a search for this exact passage in his major works (Concertos, Preludes, Études-Tableaux) does not yield a match. However, running a search for this specific musical excerpt reveals that it is not from the classical repertoire.\n5.  **Identification:** The sheet music is a perfect match for the beginning of a well-known, virtuosic piano arrangement of the song **\"Unravel,\"** which is the opening theme for the anime series **Tokyo Ghoul**. The specific arrangement that matches this sheet music is by the famous anime pianist and arranger **Animenz**. His arrangements are known for their classical, often Rachmaninoff-inspired, complexity, which explains the initial impression.\n\nThe music is **\"Unravel\"** from *Tokyo Ghoul*, arranged by **Animenz**.\n\n<<<Unravel - Tokyo Ghoul (Piano arr. by Animenz)>>>"
