    "To determine the time complexity of the given sorting algorithm, we need to analyze its behavior in the worst-case scenario.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Algorithm's Structure:** The algorithm is recursive. We will identify the base case and the recursive step.\n2.  **Formulate a Recurrence Relation:** We will describe the runtime `T(n)` for an input of size `n` as a function of the runtime for smaller inputs. We'll focus on the worst-case, which involves the maximum number of operations at each step.\n3.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:** We will solve the relation to find a closed-form expression for `T(n)`. This expression will tell us the growth rate of the algorithm's runtime, which corresponds to its time complexity.\n4.  **Present the Analysis:** I will use a Python script to print the step-by-step analysis, including the recurrence relation and its solution, as requested.\n\nThe Python code below will print out the detailed derivation of the time complexity.\n\n```python\ndef explain_complexity_analysis():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints a step-by-step analysis of the provided\n    algorithm's time complexity.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nLet's analyze the time complexity of the given `sort(a, n)` algorithm.\nLet T(n) be the time taken to run `sort` on an input of size `n`.\n\nThe pseudocode for the algorithm is:\ndef sort(a, n):\n  if n > 1:\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n    if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n      swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])\n      sort(a, n - 1)\n\n1.  **Base Case:** If n <= 1, the function does nothing and returns. This takes constant time, O(1).\n    So, T(1) = c' (a constant).\n\n2.  **Recursive Step (n > 1):** We analyze the operations:\n    - `sort(a, n - 1)`: A recursive call on a subproblem of size n-1. Time taken: T(n-1).\n    - `if a[n-1] < a[n-2]`: A comparison. Time taken: O(1).\n    - `swap(...)`: A swap. Time taken: O(1).\n    - `sort(a, n - 1)`: A second recursive call on a subproblem of size n-1. Time taken: T(n-1).\n\n3.  **Worst-Case Scenario:** The worst case occurs when the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is always true, forcing the `swap` and the second recursive call to be executed at every step of the main recursion. This happens, for example, when the input array is sorted in reverse order.\n\n4.  **Recurrence Relation:** In the worst case, the total time T(n) is the sum of the time for the two recursive calls plus the constant time for the comparison and swap.\n    This gives us the recurrence relation:\n    T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + c  (where c represents constant time work)\n    T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c\n\n5.  **Solving the Recurrence Relation:** Let's solve this by expansion (unrolling the recursion).\n\n    T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c\n    \n    Substituting T(n-1) = 2 * T(n-2) + c:\n    T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c\n         = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2*c + c\n         = 4 * T(n - 2) + 3*c\n\n    Substituting T(n-2) = 2 * T(n-3) + c:\n    T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3*c\n         = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4*c + 3*c\n         = 8 * T(n - 3) + 7*c\n    \n    We can see a pattern here:\n    T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + (2^k - 1) * c\n\n    To find the final expression, we unroll until we hit the base case T(1). Let n - k = 1, so k = n - 1.\n    T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-1) - 1) * c\n\n    Since T(1) is a constant, the expression is dominated by the 2^(n-1) term.\n    \n    This shows that the runtime grows exponentially with `n`.\n    Therefore, the time complexity is O(2^n).\n\"\"\"\n    print(explanation)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    explain_complexity_analysis()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
