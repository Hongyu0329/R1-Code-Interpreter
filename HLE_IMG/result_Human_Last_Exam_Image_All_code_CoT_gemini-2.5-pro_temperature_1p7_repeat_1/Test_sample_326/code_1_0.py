# Step 1 & 2: Define constants from the problem analysis
# omega is derived from the logarithmic derivative
omega = 17/324
# R = (v2/v1)^2 is deduced from the structure of the resulting algebraic equation
R = 4/9

# Step 3: Define coefficients for the algebraic equation for X = A^8
# The equation is (1-R^2)X^2 + RX - omega = 0
# To get integer coefficients, we multiply by 324.
a = 324 * (1 - R**2)
b = 324 * R
c = -324 * omega

# Step 4: Display the final equation for A^8, as requested
# Using f-string for formatted output. A**16 is (A**8)**2 and A**8 is X
print("The final algebraic equation for the soliton amplitude A is derived to be:")
# The formatting below ensures we print integer coefficients
print(f"{int(a)} * A**16 + {int(b)} * A**8 + {int(c)} = 0")
print("Let X = A**8, the equation is:")
print(f"{int(a)} * X**2 + {int(b)} * X + {int(c)} = 0")
print("")

# Step 5: Solve the quadratic equation for X = A**8
# Using the quadratic formula: X = (-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
# We take the positive root for X, as X = A^8 must be positive.
X = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)

print(f"Solving for the positive root of X gives X = A**8 = {X}")
print("")

# Step 6: Calculate A, the maximum amplitude
A = X**(1/8)

# Step 7: Calculate and print the final required value
result = 1 - A

print(f"The maximum soliton amplitude is A = (1/10)^(1/8) = {A:.8f}")
print(f"The final required value is (1 - max|Φ|) = 1 - A = {result:.8f}")

# Final Answer Block
# Let's verify the value of the coefficients again in the final output
# a=260, b=144, c=-17.
