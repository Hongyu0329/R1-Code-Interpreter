    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** I will visually inspect the provided raster plot. A \"synchronized burst\" is characterized by a high density of neural firings (black dots) across many electrodes (y-axis) occurring at approximately the same time (x-axis). These appear as dense vertical bands in the plot. I will estimate the center timestamp for each of these prominent bursts.\n2.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** The inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between the centers of two consecutive synchronized bursts. I will calculate the time difference for each pair of consecutive bursts identified in step 1.\n3.  **Calculate the Average IBI:** I will sum all the calculated inter-burst intervals and divide by the number of intervals to find the average.\n4.  **Format the Output:** I will round the final calculated average to two significant figures as requested.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that codifies these steps, clearly printing the identified timestamps, the calculated intervals, the final equation for the average, and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_burst_interval():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies burst timestamps from a visual analysis of the provided graph,\n    calculates the inter-burst intervals, and computes the average interval.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify timestamps of synchronized bursts from the graph.\n    # These are visually estimated from the centers of the dense vertical bands.\n    burst_timestamps = [3.5, 12.5, 24.5, 35.5, 47.5]\n    print(f\"Step 1: Identified synchronized burst timestamps (in seconds): {burst_timestamps}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (the time between consecutive bursts).\n    intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the inter-burst intervals.\")\n    for i, interval in enumerate(intervals):\n        print(f\"  Interval {i+1}: {burst_timestamps[i+1]}s - {burst_timestamps[i]}s = {interval:.1f}s\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculated intervals:\", [round(i, 1) for i in intervals], \"s\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the average inter-burst interval.\n    average_interval = np.mean(intervals)\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the average inter-burst interval.\")\n    \n    # Constructing and printing the equation for the average calculation.\n    interval_strs = [f\"{i:.1f}\" for i in intervals]\n    equation_str = f\"({ ' + '.join(interval_strs) }) / {len(intervals)}\"\n    print(f\"  Equation: Average = {equation_str}\")\n    print(f\"  Calculation: Average = {np.sum(intervals):.1f} / {len(intervals)} = {average_interval:.3f}s\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Round the result to two significant figures.\n    # The format specifier '.2g' rounds to 2 significant figures.\n    final_answer = float(f\"{average_interval:.2g}\")\n    print(f\"Step 4: Rounding the average to two significant figures gives: {final_answer}s\")\n\ncalculate_burst_interval()\n```\n<<<11>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
