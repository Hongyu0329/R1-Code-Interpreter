    "This is a fascinating illusion! Here's my plan to identify it:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The image contains two plots representing a sound. The top plot is a spectrogram (frequency vs. time), and the bottom is its corresponding waveform (amplitude vs. time).\n2.  **Interpret the Plots:**\n    *   The spectrogram starts with a single horizontal line, indicating a pure tone of a constant frequency.\n    *   This tone is interrupted by a vertical smear of blue, which represents a burst of broadband noise (containing many frequencies).\n    *   After the noise burst, the pure tone resumes.\n    *   Crucially, in the spectrogram, the line for the pure tone appears to continue *through* the noise burst, even though the waveform below clearly shows the sine wave of the tone is physically replaced by the noise.\n3.  **Identify the Phenomenon:** This discrepancy between the physical reality (tone stops, noise plays, tone starts again) and the common perception (the tone continues \"behind\" the noise) is a well-known auditory illusion. The brain perceptually \"fills in\" the missing part of the tone. This is analogous to how our brain handles visual blind spots or occluded objects.\n4.  **Determine the Name:** This effect is called the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**. It demonstrates the brain's tendency to perceive continuous sounds even when they are interrupted by other sounds, provided the interrupting sound is spectrally capable of masking the original sound.\n5.  **Code generation:** I will write a simple python script to print out the name of this phenomenon.\n\n```python\ndef identify_phenomenon():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the perceptual phenomenon shown in the image.\n\n  The image displays a classic psychoacoustic experiment:\n  1. A pure tone is played.\n  2. The tone is interrupted and replaced by a burst of noise.\n  3. The pure tone resumes after the noise.\n\n  Despite the physical gap, listeners perceive the tone as continuing uninterrupted\n  \"behind\" the noise. This is a perceptual \"filling-in\" effect.\n  \"\"\"\n  phenomenon_name = \"Auditory continuity illusion\"\n  print(f\"The name of this phenomenon is: {phenomenon_name}\")\n\nidentify_phenomenon()\n```\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion>>>"
