  This function identifies the perceptual phenomenon shown in the image.

  The image displays a classic psychoacoustic experiment:
  1. A pure tone is played.
  2. The tone is interrupted and replaced by a burst of noise.
  3. The pure tone resumes after the noise.

  Despite the physical gap, listeners perceive the tone as continuing uninterrupted
  "behind" the noise. This is a perceptual "filling-in" effect.
