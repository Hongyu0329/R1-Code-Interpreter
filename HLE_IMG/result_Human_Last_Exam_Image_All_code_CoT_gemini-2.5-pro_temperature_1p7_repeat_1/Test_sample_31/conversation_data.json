    "To determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the image, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Identify the Knot**: First, we identify the knot from the provided diagram. By counting the crossings and observing its structure, we can identify it as the knot `7₄` from the standard Rolfsen knot table.\n2.  **Use a Key Property**: Calculating the Rasmussen invariant, `s(K)`, from its definition in Khovanov homology is extremely complex. A more practical method is to use known theorems that relate `s(K)` to other, more established knot invariants. The knot `7₄` is a *quasi-alternating knot*.\n3.  **Apply the Theorem**: A fundamental theorem by Manolescu and Ozsváth states that for any quasi-alternating knot `K`, its Rasmussen invariant `s(K)` is exactly equal to its signature, `σ(K)`.\n4.  **Find the Signature**: The signature of the `7₄` knot, `σ(7₄)`, is a known value from knot theory tables, which is -2.\n5.  **Conclusion**: Based on the theorem, we can conclude that `s(7₄) = σ(7₄) = -2`.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rasmussen_invariant_7_4():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Rasmussen invariant for the knot 7_4 by using the property\n    that it is quasi-alternating.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the knot from the image.\n    knot_name = \"7_4\"\n\n    # Step 2: State the key property of this knot.\n    knot_property = \"quasi-alternating\"\n\n    # Step 3: State the known signature of the knot.\n    # The signature is a well-known invariant, and for 7_4, its value is -2.\n    signature_of_7_4 = -2\n\n    # Step 4: Apply the theorem for quasi-alternating knots.\n    # Theorem: For a quasi-alternating knot K, s(K) = sigma(K).\n    # where s(K) is the Rasmussen invariant and sigma(K) is the knot signature.\n    rasmussen_invariant_of_7_4 = signature_of_7_4\n\n    # Step 5: Print the detailed explanation and the final equation.\n    print(f\"The knot in the image is identified as {knot_name}.\")\n    print(f\"This knot is known to be {knot_property}.\")\n    print(\"\\nA key theorem states that for quasi-alternating knots, the Rasmussen invariant is equal to the knot signature.\")\n    print(\"Equation: s(K) = sigma(K)\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe signature for knot {knot_name} is known:\")\n    print(f\"sigma({knot_name}) = {signature_of_7_4}\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, we can determine the Rasmussen invariant:\")\n    print(f\"s({knot_name}) = {rasmussen_invariant_of_7_4}\")\n\ncalculate_rasmussen_invariant_7_4()\n```\n<<<-2>>>"
