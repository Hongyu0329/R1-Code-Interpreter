# Based on the analysis, the correct statements are 3 and 8.
# Statement 3: Plots 1 and 4 correspond to system (C).
# Statement 8: Plots {4, 5, 6} correspond to the lower Lewis number (more unstable behavior).

# This corresponds to option N.
# We are asked to output the final answer in the format <<<answer content>>>.
# No code execution is necessary to determine the choice.
# The analysis involves understanding chemical engineering systems and dynamical systems theory.
# The final selected answer option is 'N'.

# Printing the components of the chosen answer as requested by the prompt format instructions.
# I need to print the numbers from the final chosen statements.
# The chosen statements are 3 and 8.
