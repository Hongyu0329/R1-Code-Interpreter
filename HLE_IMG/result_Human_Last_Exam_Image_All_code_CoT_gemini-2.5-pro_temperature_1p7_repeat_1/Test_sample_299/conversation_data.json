    "This is a classic chess puzzle composed by J. G. Campbell in 1895. It's famous for being tricky, with a number of tempting but flawed solutions, and even an unintended shorter solution (`1. Re3#`) which is often debated. However, the intended and celebrated solution is a brilliant mate in two.\n\nMy plan is to identify this intended two-move sequence.\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial position:** White has a strong attack against the exposed Black king on e4. Black's key defenders are the Queen on d5 and the Rook on c6.\n2.  **Find the key first move (Move 1):** The winning move is a \"quiet\" move that doesn't check the king but puts Black in *zugzwang* (a situation where any move Black makes will worsen their position). This move is **Qa1**. The queen moves from a4 to a1.\n3.  **Analyze Black's responses:** Now, any piece Black moves creates a fatal weakness.\n    *   If Black moves the Rook from c6 (e.g., to c5, or anywhere else), it can no longer defend the c-file or other critical squares.\n    *   If Black moves the Queen from d5, it can no longer defend the c5 square.\n    *   If Black moves the King to its only flight square (d3), this also creates a new mating pattern.\n4.  **Find the second move (Move 2 - Checkmate):**\n    *   Following the line where Black moves the rook, for example, `1... Rc5`.\n    *   White can now deliver checkmate with **Qb1#**. The White Queen on b1 now attacks the king on e4, and all of its escape squares are either blocked or attacked by other White pieces. The Black Rook is no longer on c6 to block, and the Black Queen on d5 cannot block the check.\n\nI will now write Python code to print this specific two-move checkmate sequence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the 2-move checkmate solution for the given chess position.\n    \"\"\"\n    move1_white = \"1. Qa4-a1\"\n    response_black = \"1... Rc6-c5\"\n    move2_white_mate = \"2. Qa1-b1#\"\n\n    print(\"The 2-move checkmate solution is:\")\n    print(f\"White's first move: {move1_white}\")\n    print(f\"A possible response from Black: {response_black}\")\n    print(f\"White's second move (Checkmate): {move2_white_mate}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final checkmating move is Qb1. Here is the move in the final equation format:\")\n    \n    final_equation = \"Q\" + \"a\" + \"1\" + \"-\" + \"b\" + \"1\" + \"#\"\n    # Print each character of the final equation as requested\n    for char in final_equation:\n        print(char)\n\nsolve_chess_puzzle()\n<<<1. Qa1 ... 2. Qb1#>>>"
