    This function identifies the two products of the described reaction.

    The reaction proceeds in two steps:
    1. A thermal 4Ï€ electrocyclic ring opening of the chiral cyclobutene derivative. This is a conrotatory process. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the two possible conrotatory modes (clockwise/counter-clockwise) lead to two different diastereomeric diene intermediates.
    2. An endo Diels-Alder reaction of each diene with ethyl acrylate.

    The key points for identifying the products are:
    - The stereocenter of the starting material (Me = wedge, OMe = dash) is preserved throughout the reaction.
    - We must screen the products A-H to find those that match this stereochemistry.
    - The products A, C, E, and G all have the correct stereochemistry at the quaternary center (Me-wedge, OMe-dash).
    - The products B, D, F, and H have the opposite (epimeric) stereochemistry at this center, so they can be eliminated.
    - Comparing A, C, E, G:
        - A and G are identical molecules.
        - C and E are identical molecules.
        - A and C are diastereomers (epimers at the ester-bearing carbon).
    - The reaction is expected to form two diastereomeric products. This can happen if the two diastereomeric dienes each undergo an endo cycloaddition. These two products must be A and C.
    - The question asks to identify the two products from the list of images labeled A-H. The molecules are represented by labels A, C, G, E.
    - C and G represent the two different diastereomeric products that can be formed while retaining the starting material's key stereocenter. G is the same molecule as A. So the pair is (A, C) or (G, C).
