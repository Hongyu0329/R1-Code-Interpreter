# 1. Define the values of the components from the circuit diagram.
V2 = 1.0  # Volts
R1 = 3.0  # Ohms
R2 = 7.0  # Ohms
R3 = 9.0  # Ohms
R7 = 100.0 # Ohms
R8 = 100.0 # Ohms

# 2. Analyze the circuit and simplify.
# A wire connects the positive terminal to the node between R2 and R3.
# This creates a short circuit across the series combination of R1 and R2.
# Therefore, no current flows through R1 and R2.
# The circuit simplifies to two parallel branches: one with R3 and another with R7 and R8 in series.
print("Step 1: Simplify the circuit.")
print(f"Resistors R1 ({R1} Ω) and R2 ({R2} Ω) are short-circuited, so no current flows through them.")

# 3. Calculate the resistance of the series branch (R7 + R8).
R_series = R7 + R8
print(f"Step 2: Calculate the resistance of the series branch containing R7 and R8.")
print(f"R_series = R7 + R8 = {R7} Ω + {R8} Ω = {R_series} Ω")

# 4. Calculate the total equivalent resistance (Req) of the two parallel branches.
# The formula for two parallel resistors is Req = (R_a * R_b) / (R_a + R_b)
Req = (R3 * R_series) / (R3 + R_series)
print("\nStep 3: Calculate the total equivalent resistance (Req) of the parallel combination of R3 and R_series.")
print(f"Req = (R3 * R_series) / (R3 + R_series)")
print(f"Req = ({R3} * {R_series}) / ({R3} + {R_series})")
print(f"Req = {R3 * R_series} / {R3 + R_series} = {Req:.4f} Ω")


# 5. Calculate the total current (I_total) using Ohm's Law (I = V / R).
I_total = V2 / Req
print("\nStep 4: Calculate the total current using Ohm's Law (I = V / Req).")
print(f"I_total = V2 / Req = {V2} V / {Req:.4f} Ω")
print(f"The total current flowing through the circuit is {I_total:.4f} A.")
