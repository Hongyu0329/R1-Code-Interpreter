    "My plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the ECG Grid:** I will determine the time duration represented by a single small square on the ECG grid using the provided paper speed of 25 mm/sec.\n2.  **Locate the Longest Interval:** I will visually scan the entire ECG rhythm strip to find the widest gap between two consecutive R-waves (the R-R interval).\n3.  **Measure the Interval:** I will count the number of small horizontal squares that make up this longest R-R interval.\n4.  **Calculate the Duration:** I will multiply the number of small squares by the time duration of a single square to get the final R-R interval in seconds.\n5.  **Generate Code:** I will write a Python script to perform and print this calculation step-by-step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_longest_rr_interval():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the longest R-R interval from an ECG strip.\n\n    This function determines the longest R-R interval in seconds based on visual\n    analysis of the provided ECG image.\n\n    Steps:\n    1. The paper speed is given as 25 mm/sec. Each small square on the grid is 1 mm.\n       Therefore, the time for one small square is 1 sec / 25 mm = 0.04 seconds.\n    2. By visual inspection of the ECG strip, the longest pause is located on the\n       fourth tracing.\n    3. We count the number of small squares between the R-wave peaks for this interval.\n       The interval spans approximately 34 small squares.\n    4. The total time for the longest R-R interval is calculated by multiplying\n       the number of squares by the time per square.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    paper_speed_mm_per_sec = 25\n    \n    # Calculate the time represented by one small square (1 mm)\n    time_per_small_square = 1 / paper_speed_mm_per_sec\n    \n    # Count the number of small squares for the longest R-R interval from the image\n    longest_interval_in_squares = 34\n    \n    # Calculate the longest R-R interval in seconds\n    longest_rr_interval_seconds = longest_interval_in_squares * time_per_small_square\n    \n    # Print the explanation and the calculation\n    print(\"Step 1: Determine the time duration of one small square on the ECG grid.\")\n    print(f\"Given the paper speed of {paper_speed_mm_per_sec} mm/sec, each 1 mm small square represents 1 / {paper_speed_mm_per_sec} = {time_per_small_square:.2f} seconds.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Measure the longest R-R interval on the ECG strip in small squares.\")\n    print(f\"By visual inspection, the longest interval between two R-waves spans {longest_interval_in_squares} small squares.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the duration of the longest R-R interval in seconds.\")\n    print(\"The final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{longest_interval_in_squares} squares * {time_per_small_square:.2f} seconds/square = {longest_rr_interval_seconds:.2f} seconds\")\n\ncalculate_longest_rr_interval()\n```\n<<<1.36>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
