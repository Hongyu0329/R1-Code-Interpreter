def solve_airfoil_matching():
    """
    This function determines and prints the correct pairing between the airfoil shape plots (A-H)
    and the pressure coefficient plots (1-8).

    The matching is based on the following logic:
    1.  Identify symmetric airfoils (B, F) and their corresponding pressure plots (1, 2) by comparing lift (thicker F produces more lift than thinner B).
        - B (thin, symmetric) -> 1 (lowest lift)
        - F (thick, symmetric) -> 2 (higher lift than 1)
    2.  Group remaining airfoils by thickness: thin (A, C, D) and thick (E, G, H).
    3.  Rank airfoils within each group by camber:
        - Thin group: Camber A > Camber C > Camber D
        - Thick group: Camber E > Camber G > Camber H
    4.  Group remaining pressure plots by general magnitude (lift):
        - Lower lift plots for thin airfoils: {3, 4, 8}
        - Higher lift plots for thick airfoils: {5, 6, 7}
    5.  Rank pressure plots within each group by enclosed area (lift):
        - Lower lift group: Area(3) > Area(8) > Area(4)
        - Higher lift group: Area(6) > Area(7) > Area(5)
    6.  Match the ranked lists:
        - A -> 3, C -> 8, D -> 4
        - E -> 6, G -> 7, H -> 5
    7.  Combine the results in alphabetical order (A-H).
