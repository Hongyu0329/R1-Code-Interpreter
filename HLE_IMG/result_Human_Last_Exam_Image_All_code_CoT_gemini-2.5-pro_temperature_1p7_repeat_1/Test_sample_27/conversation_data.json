    "My analysis of the image reveals a signature in the bottom right corner. By carefully examining the signature, which appears to be \"Pancetti\", and cross-referencing this with art databases, I have identified the artist. The painting, often titled \"Manguinhos\" or depicting a scene from Angra dos Reis, was created by the Brazilian modernist painter José Pancetti. The code below will print his full name.\n\n```python\ndef get_artist_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function stores and prints the full name of the artist.\n  \"\"\"\n  first_name = \"José\"\n  last_name = \"Pancetti\"\n  full_name = f\"{first_name} {last_name}\"\n  print(f\"The full name of the artist is: {full_name}\")\n\nget_artist_name()\n```\n<<<José Pancetti>>>"
