    "My plan is to identify the artist of the painting by analyzing its unique surrealist style and distinctive elements. The painting combines an interior room with multiple impossible outdoor scenes, such as an ocean flowing through a doorway, a glacial landscape outside a window, and books burning in a fireplace. This style is characteristic of a specific modern surrealist painter. I will use this information to identify the artist and then write a Python script to print their name.\n\n```python\n# The painting is a famous work of surrealism.\n# Key features include:\n# - A room where the floor becomes an ocean beach.\n# - A doorway opening to a steamship on the sea.\n# - Another view showing a barren tree and a hot air balloon over a field of ice or white formations.\n# - Books are being used as fuel in the fireplace.\n# These highly imaginative and meticulously detailed scenes are the signature style of the Polish painter Jacek Yerka.\n# This specific painting is often known as \"Private Library\" or \"Bibliodame\".\n\nartist = \"Jacek Yerka\"\nprint(\"The artist of the painting is:\")\nprint(artist)\n```\n<<<Jacek Yerka>>>"
