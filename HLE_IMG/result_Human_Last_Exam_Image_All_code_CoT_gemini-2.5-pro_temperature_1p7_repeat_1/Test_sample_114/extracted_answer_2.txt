The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is caused by the asymmetry of its bicyclic Münchnone intermediate. Reactions 1 and 2 establish this principle by demonstrating that a symmetric Münchnone intermediate, formed from N-acetyl-N-methylalanine, leads to a loss of regioselectivity, as evidenced by the 1:1 scrambling of the 13C label.
