# Step 1: Define the probabilities for the identified path.
# The path is START -> Appreciation -> Solution -> END.

# Probability of transitioning from START to Appreciation, from the diagram.
p_start_to_appreciation = 0.32

# Probability of transitioning from Appreciation to Solution.
# The sum of outgoing probabilities from Appreciation must be 1.
# P(Appreciation -> END) = 0.83, so P(Appreciation -> Solution) = 1.0 - 0.83
p_appreciation_to_solution = 1.0 - 0.83

# Probability of transitioning from Solution to END.
# The problem states it has only 1 outgoing transition to END.
p_solution_to_end = 1.0

# Step 2: Calculate the total probability of the path.
# This is the product of the individual transition probabilities.
total_probability = p_start_to_appreciation * p_appreciation_to_solution * p_solution_to_end

# Step 3: Print the results.
# The output will show the path, the equation, and the final rounded answer.
