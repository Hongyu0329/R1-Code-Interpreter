    "This image shows a dental lesion that is classified based on its location. The decay is occurring on the occlusal (chewing) surface of a posterior tooth, within the pits and fissures, and is adjacent to an existing restoration. This is known as secondary or recurrent caries. According to G.V. Black's classification system, which is based on the location of the caries, this falls into a specific category.\n\nThe Python script below will explain the classification and provide the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef get_caries_classification():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides the G.V. Black classification for the lesion in the image.\n    \n    The classification is based on the location of the tooth decay.\n    - The image shows decay on the occlusal (chewing) surface of a posterior tooth.\n    - Specifically, the decay is in the anatomical pits and fissures.\n    - It is also secondary (or recurrent) decay, as it is adjacent to an existing filling.\n    \n    According to G.V.
