    "This problem requires us to determine the identity of substituents (either a hydrogen atom, H, or a methyl group, CH₃) at five specific positions in the product of an acid-catalyzed rearrangement of a triterpenoid. The reaction involves a dehydration followed by a series of [1,2] shifts, a classic transformation known as a Wagner-Meerwein or backbone rearrangement.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** The reaction is the acid-catalyzed dehydration of an alcohol, followed by a carbocation-driven backbone rearrangement.\n2.  **Trace the carbocation cascade:** We will follow the step-by-step movement of the positive charge through the molecular skeleton via a series of [1,2]-hydride and [1,2]-methyl shifts. This is the most common pathway for these molecules, leading to a thermodynamically stable oleanane-type product.\n3.  **Determine the fate of each substituent:** By tracking the migrating groups, we can determine the final substituent (H or CH₃) at each key carbon atom in the product.\n4.  **Map results to the labeled positions:** We will assign the determined substituents to the numbered positions (1 to 5) as indicated in the product structure.\n\n### Step-by-Step Mechanism and Substituent Analysis:\nThe reaction starts with the protonation of the hydroxyl group (-OH) on C-3 by HCl, followed by the loss of a water molecule (H₂O) to form a carbocation at C-3. This initiates the rearrangement cascade:\n\n*   **Initial Carbocation:** at C-3.\n*   **Step a:** A [1,2]-methyl shift occurs from C-4 to C-3. The carbocation moves to C-4. The original C-3 now bears a new methyl group.\n*   **Step b:** A [1,2]-hydride shift occurs from C-5 to C-4. The carbocation moves to C-5. The original C-4 now bears a hydrogen where the cation was.\n*   **Step c:** A [1,2]-methyl shift occurs from C-10 to C-5. The carbocation moves to C-10.\n*   **Step d:** A [1,2]-hydride shift occurs from C-9 to C-10. The carbocation moves to C-9.\n*   **Step e:** A [1,2]-methyl shift occurs from C-8 to C-9. The carbocation moves to C-8.\n*   **Step f:** A [1,2]-methyl shift occurs from C-14 to C-8. The carbocation moves to C-14.\n*   **Step g:** A [1,2]-hydride shift occurs from C-13 to C-14. The carbocation moves to C-13.\n*   **Step h:** Elimination of a proton (H⁺) from C-12 forms the stable, tetrasubstituted double bond between C-12 and C-13.\n\n### Final Substituent Identity at Labeled Positions:\n\n1.  **Position 1 (on C-4):** C-4 initially has two methyl groups. One migrates away in step (a). C-4 then accepts a hydride in step (b). Therefore, the substituent pointed to by label 1, which is the methyl group remaining at C-4, is a **CH₃**.\n2.  **Position 2 (on C-10):** C-10 loses its methyl group in step (c) and gains a hydride from C-9 in step (d). Thus, the substituent at C-10 is now a **H**.\n3.  **Position 3 (on C-8):** C-8 loses its original methyl group in step (e) but gains a new methyl group from C-14 in step (f). So, the substituent at C-8 is a **CH₃**.\n4.  **Position 4 (on C-14):** C-14 loses its methyl group in step (f) and gains a hydride from C-13 in step (g). So, the substituent at C-14 is a **H**.\n5.  **Position 5 (near C-13/C-18):** This label points to a substituent on the \"back\" of the D-ring. This corresponds to the hydrogen at C-18. This hydrogen does not participate in the rearrangement and remains in its position. Thus, the substituent is a **H**.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can provide the final answer.\n\n```python\n# This code summarizes the logical deduction of the substituents based on the\n# known backbone rearrangement mechanism for triterpenoids.\n\n# Dictionary to store the identified substituents.\n# V, W, X, Y, Z corresponding to positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\nsubstituents = {\n    '1': 'CH3', # Result for position 1 (at C-4)\n    '2': 'H',   # Result for position 2 (at C-10)\n    '3': 'CH3', # Result for position 3 (at C-8)\n    '4': 'H',   # Result for position 4 (at C-14)\n    '5': 'H'    # Result for position 5 (at C-18)\n}\n\n# Print the final answer in the required format.\nprint(f\"1 = {substituents['1']}, 2 = {substituents['2']}, 3 = {substituents['3']}, 4 = {substituents['4']}, 5 = {substituents['5']}\")\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = H, 5 = H>>>"
