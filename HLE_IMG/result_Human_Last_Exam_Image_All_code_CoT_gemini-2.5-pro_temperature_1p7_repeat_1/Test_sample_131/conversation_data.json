    "Based on the chemical structure provided, I will identify the name of the alkaloid compound.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the structure:** The image displays a complex, polycyclic organic molecule containing nitrogen atoms, which is characteristic of an alkaloid. It consists of four fused six-membered rings.\n2.  **Identify key functional groups:** One of the rings contains a carbonyl group (C=O) adjacent to a nitrogen atom, which forms a lactam functional group.\n3.  **Compare with known alkaloids:** The specific tetracyclic framework and the position of the lactam are hallmarks of a class of quinolizidine alkaloids. By comparing the exact structure, including the stereochemistry (indicated by wedges and dashes), to a database of known compounds, it can be identified.\n4.  **Final Identification:** The structure perfectly matches that of **Matrine**, an alkaloid found in plants from the *Sophora* genus.\n5.  **Code Generation:** As requested, I will provide a Python script to print out the name of the identified compound.\n\n```python\ndef identify_alkaloid():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the alkaloid from the provided image and prints its name.\n  The structure is a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid with a lactam group.\n  This specific structure corresponds to Matrine.\n  \"\"\"\n  compound_name = \"Matrine\"\n  print(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n\nidentify_alkaloid()\n```\n<<<Matrine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
