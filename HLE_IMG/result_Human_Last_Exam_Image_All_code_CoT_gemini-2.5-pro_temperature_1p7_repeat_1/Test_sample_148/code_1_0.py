    Analyzes the clinical and pathological findings to provide a diagnosis.

    Clinical Information:
    - Age: 28 years
    - Gender: Female
    - Location: Mass in the sella turcica

    Pathological Findings (Crush Smear):
    - Cellularity: High
    - Architecture: Cohesive, syncytial clusters of cells.
    - Cellular features:
        - Monomorphic cell population.
        - Round to oval nuclei.
        - Stippled ("salt-and-pepper") chromatin.
        - Eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm.
        - Indistinct cell borders.
    - Background: Granular, proteinaceous.

    Conclusion: The combination of a sellar mass in a young adult with cytological features of a
    monomorphic neuroendocrine proliferation is characteristic of a pituitary adenoma.
