# Step 1: Define parameters m and n based on visual inspection of the polyhedron.
# By tracing the path between two adjacent pentagons, we count m steps, a turn, and n steps.
# Our analysis of the image yields m=4 and n=3.
m = 4
n = 3

# Step 2: Determine the number of pentagonal and hexagonal faces.
# The number of pentagonal faces in a Goldberg polyhedron is always 12.
P = 12

# The number of hexagonal faces H is calculated using the triangulation number T.
# T = m^2 + m*n + n^2
T = m**2 + m*n + n**2
# H = 10 * (T - 1)
H = 10 * (T - 1)

# Step 3: Print the results and the calculation steps.
