    "Based on the architectural style of the skyscrapers visible in the image, particularly the prominent building on the right, I can identify the location. The building with the distinctive grid pattern of windows is the World Trade Center Seoul (Trade Tower), a well-known landmark in the Gangnam district of Seoul, South Korea. The surrounding buildings are part of the COEX complex and the surrounding business district.\n\nTherefore, the city is Seoul.\n\nHere is a Python script to output the answer.\n```python\ndef solve():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the city from the provided image.\n  The image features prominent modern skyscrapers.
