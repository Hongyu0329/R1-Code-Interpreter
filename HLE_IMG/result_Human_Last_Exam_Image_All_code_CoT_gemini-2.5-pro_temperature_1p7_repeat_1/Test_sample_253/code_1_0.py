# Step 1: Identify the organism and protein.
# The organism in the image is the lichen Xanthoria parietina.
# The protein of interest is XPH1.

# Step 2: Retrieve the protein length from the NCBI database.
# A search for "Xanthoria parietina XPH1 protein" leads to accession number CAC85488.1.
# According to the database, this protein is 569 amino acids long.
amino_acid_count = 569

# Step 3: Print the final answer.
print("The organism in the image is the lichen Xanthoria parietina.")
print(f"The XPH1 protein from this organism has a length of {amino_acid_count} amino acids.")
