    "Here is my plan to determine the IUPAC name of the compound:\n1.  **Analyze the Mass Spectrum (MS):** Determine the molecular weight and deduce a plausible molecular formula using the Nitrogen Rule.\n2.  **Analyze the Infrared (IR) Spectrum:** Identify key functional groups present in the molecule.\n3.  **Analyze the $^{13}$C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra:** Determine the number and types of carbon atoms (CH, CH₂, CH₃, C).\n4.  **Analyze the $^{1}$H NMR Spectrum:** Identify the number of different proton environments, their relative numbers (integration), and their neighboring protons (splitting pattern).\n5.  **Analyze the 2D HSQC Spectrum:** Correlate each proton signal with the carbon signal it is directly attached to, confirming the CH, CH₂, and CH₃ groups.\n6.  **Piece Together the Structure:** Combine all the spectroscopic evidence to propose a single, self-consistent molecular structure.\n7.  **Name the Structure:** Provide the systematic IUPAC name for the deduced structure.\n\nI will now execute this plan using a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided spectral data step-by-step to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Analysis of Mass Spectrum (MS)\")\n    molecular_ion = 135\n    print(f\"The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = {molecular_ion}.\")\n    print(\"According to the Nitrogen Rule, an odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms.\")\n    print(\"Let's assume one nitrogen atom (N, atomic weight ~14).\")\n    remaining_mass = molecular_ion - 14\n    print(f\"Remaining mass for Carbon and Hydrogen = {molecular_ion} - 14 = {remaining_mass}.\")\n    num_carbons = 9\n    num_hydrogens = 13\n    print(f\"A plausible molecular formula is C{num_carbons}H{num_hydrogens}N, which has a mass of (9*12 + 13*1 + 14) = {num_carbons*12 + num_hydrogens*1 + 14}.\")\n    # DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2\n    degree_of_unsaturation = num_carbons + 1 - (num_hydrogens / 2) + (1 / 2)\n    print(f\"The degree of unsaturation for C9H13N is {int(degree_of_unsaturation)}, suggesting an aromatic ring (DoU=4).\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Analysis of Infrared (IR) Spectrum\")\n    print(\"- Peaks just above 3000 cm-1: Aromatic C-H stretch.\")\n    print(\"- Peaks just below 3000 cm-1: Aliphatic C-H stretch.\")\n    print(\"- Sharp peak around 3400 cm-1: N-H stretch (likely from a primary or secondary amine).\")\n    print(\"- Peaks around 1600 & 1500 cm-1: C=C stretch, characteristic of an aromatic ring.\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: The molecule contains an aromatic ring, aliphatic groups, and an N-H bond.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Analysis of 13C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectra\")\n    c13_shifts = [145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2]\n    print(f\"There are {len(c13_shifts)} unique carbon signals, which means there is symmetry in the C9 molecule.\")\n    print(\"- Four signals are in the aromatic region (120-150 ppm), consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring (C-ipso, C-ortho, C-meta, C-para).\")\n    print(\"- Three signals are in the aliphatic region (< 60 ppm): 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\")\n    print(\"The DEPT-135 spectrum shows one negative signal (CH2) and five positive signals (CH and CH3).\")\n    print(\"- The aromatic CH groups account for 3 positive signals.\")\n    print(\"- Therefore, the 3 aliphatic carbons must consist of one CH2 group (negative), one CH group (positive), and one CH3 group (positive).\")\n    print(\"Carbon Skeleton: A monosubstituted phenyl group (C6H5-) and a C3 side chain containing one CH2, one CH, and one CH3 group.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Analysis of 1H NMR and HSQC Spectra\")\n    print(\"- Aromatic region (~7.2 ppm): A multiplet integrating to 5H, confirming the C6H5- (phenyl) group.\")\n    print(\"- Aliphatic region:\")\n    print(\"  - A multiplet at ~2.8-2.9 ppm (2H), correlated by HSQC to the carbon at 43.5 ppm.
