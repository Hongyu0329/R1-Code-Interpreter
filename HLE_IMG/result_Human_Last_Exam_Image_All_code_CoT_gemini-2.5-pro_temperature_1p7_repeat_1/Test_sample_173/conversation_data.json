    "To determine the time signature of the musical measure, we need to count the total duration of all the notes within one measure for either the treble or bass clef. The total duration must be the same for both. A time signature's top number tells us how many beats are in a measure, and the bottom number tells us what kind of note gets one beat.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Bass Clef (Bottom Staff):** This is the simpler of the two. It contains a single note, a whole note (the hollow note head with no stem). A whole note lasts for the entire measure in many common time signatures. By definition, a whole note is equivalent to four quarter notes.\n2.  **Analyze the Treble Clef (Top Staff):** The notes here are all sixteenth notes (notes with two flags or beams). We can count them. They are grouped into four sets of four notes. The total number of sixteenth notes is 4 * 4 = 16.\n3.  **Calculate the Total Duration:**\n    *   Since 4 sixteenth notes equal 1 quarter note, 16 sixteenth notes equal `16 / 4 = 4` quarter notes.\n    *   This confirms the finding from the bass clef: the total duration of the measure is equivalent to four quarter notes.\n4.  **Determine the Time Signature:** A measure that contains four quarter notes of duration is in **4/4** time. The top '4' means there are four beats, and the bottom '4' means a quarter note gets one beat.\n\nThe following Python code mathematically demonstrates this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef find_time_signature():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the time signature by analyzing the note durations in the provided musical measure.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Note Value Definitions ---\n    # We define values relative to a quarter note, which is our 'beat'.\n    # A sixteenth note is 1/4 of a quarter note.\n    # A whole note is 4 quarter notes.\n    sixteenth_note_in_beats = 1.0 / 4.0\n    whole_note_in_beats = 4.0\n\n    # --- Analysis of Treble Clef (Top Staff) ---\n    # The treble clef contains 16 sixteenth notes.\n    num_sixteenth_notes = 16\n    total_beats_treble = num_sixteenth_notes * sixteenth_note_in_beats\n\n    # --- Analysis of Bass Clef (Bottom Staff) ---\n    # The bass clef contains 1 whole note.\n    num_whole_notes = 1\n    total_beats_bass = num_whole_notes * whole_note_in_beats\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the duration of notes to find the time signature.\")\n    print(\"The beat unit is assumed to be a quarter note.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Treble Clef (Top Staff) Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"Number of sixteenth notes: {num_sixteenth_notes}\")\n    print(f\"Total beats = {num_sixteenth_notes} * (1/4) = {int(total_beats_treble)} beats\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Bass Clef (Bottom Staff) Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"Number of whole notes: {num_whole_notes}\")\n    print(f\"Total beats = {num_whole_notes} * 4 = {int(total_beats_bass)} beats\\n\")\n\n    # The top number of the time signature is the total beats per measure.\n    # The bottom number indicates the note type for one beat (4 for a quarter note).\n    top_number = int(total_beats_treble)\n    bottom_number = 4\n\n    print(\"--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(f\"The measure contains a total of {top_number} quarter-note beats.\")\n    print(\"This corresponds to a time signature where the top number is 4 and the bottom number is 4.\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Equation: The time signature is {top_number} / {bottom_number}\")\n\nfind_time_signature()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
