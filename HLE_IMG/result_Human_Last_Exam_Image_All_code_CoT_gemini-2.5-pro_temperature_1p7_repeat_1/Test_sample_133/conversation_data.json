    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to identify the unknown compound from its mass spectrum:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak:** I first look for the molecular ion peak, which is the peak corresponding to the intact molecule and usually has the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). The spectrum shows a cluster of peaks at the high-mass end, starting around m/z 258. The most significant peaks in this cluster listed in the table are m/z 260 (I=34.8%), 262 (I=29.0%), 264 (I=12.9%), and 266 (I=3.22%). The peak at m/z 260 is the one with the lowest mass in this characteristic cluster, so I'll assume this is the molecular ion peak (M⁺) corresponding to the molecule with the most common isotopes. The molecular weight (using lightest isotopes) is therefore 260 u.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Isotopic Pattern:** The cluster of peaks (M⁺, M⁺+2, M⁺+4, M⁺+6) is a strong indicator for the presence of elements with common heavy isotopes, like chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br). The observed pattern suggests the presence of multiple chlorine atoms.\n    *   For 3 chlorine atoms, the expected isotopic abundance ratio for M⁺ : M⁺+2 : M⁺+4 : M⁺+6 is approximately 1 : 0.96 : 0.31 : 0.03.\n    *   Our experimental ratio (normalizing to the peak at m/z 260) is 1 : (29.0/34.8) : (12.9/34.8) : (3.22/34.8) ≈ 1 : 0.83 : 0.37 : 0.09.\n    *   While not a perfect match (which can be common in real spectra), it resembles the pattern for three chlorine atoms more closely than any other common combination.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Fragmentation Pattern:** This is the most crucial step. I'll examine the major fragment peaks and the mass differences between them.\n    *   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** m/z = 260\n    *   **Base Peak (most intense fragment):** m/z = 225.\n    *   The mass difference is 260 - 225 = 35 u. This loss is characteristic of a single chlorine atom (³⁵Cl). This means the base peak is the [M-Cl]⁺ fragment.\n    *   **Next significant fragment:** m/z = 190. The difference from the previous fragment is 225 - 190 = 35 u. This indicates the loss of a second chlorine atom. This peak is [M-2Cl]⁺.\n    *   **Another significant fragment:** m/z = 155. The difference is 190 - 155 = 35 u, corresponding to the loss of a third chlorine atom. This peak is [M-3Cl]⁺.\n\n4.  **Deduce the Chemical Formula:**\n    *   The fragmentation pattern (consecutive losses of 35 u) provides very strong evidence that the molecule contains **three chlorine atoms**.\n    *   The fragment at m/z = 155 is what remains after all three chlorine atoms are lost. This is the non-halogenated \"backbone\" of the molecule.\n    *   The backbone has a mass of 155 u. According to the **Nitrogen Rule**, a molecule or fragment with an odd-numbered mass must contain an odd number of nitrogen atoms.\n    *   Let's find a plausible chemical formula for a backbone with mass 155 containing one nitrogen atom (assuming C, H, N, O). A composition of **C₁₁H₉N** has a mass of (11 * 12) + (9 * 1) + (1 * 14) = 132 + 9 + 14 = 155 u. This is a chemically reasonable formula (e.g., a phenylpyridine isomer).\n    *   Combining the backbone (C₁₁H₉N) with the three chlorine atoms gives a molecular formula of **C₁₁H₉NCl₃**.\n    *   Let's verify the molecular weight: (11 * 12) + (9 * 1) + (1 * 14) + (3 * 35) = 132 + 9 + 14 + 105 = 260 u. This perfectly matches our identified molecular ion peak.\n\n5.  **Identify the Compound and Name:** The determined formula is C₁₁H₉NCl₃. This indicates a trichloro- derivative of a C₁₁H₉N isomer, such as phenylpyridine. A precise IUPAC name would require knowing the exact positions of the phenyl group and the three chlorine atoms. However, based on this chemical logic, the compound class is clear. A possible systematic name for an isomer that fits this data is 3,5,6-trichloro-4-phenyl-3,4-dihydropyridine. For simplicity and as a representative of this class, I will provide a plausible name.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_mass_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided mass spectrum data to identify the compound.\n    This function demonstrates the logical steps used to deduce the compound's identity.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define key peaks from the provided table ---\n    molecular_ion_mz = 260\n    base_peak_mz = 225\n    fragment_1_mz = 190\n    fragment_2_mz = 155\n    mass_Cl = 35  # Mass of the most common isotope of Chlorine\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identifying key peaks and calculating mass losses.\")\n    print(f\"Molecular Ion Peak (M+): m/z = {molecular_ion_mz}\")\n    print(f\"Base Peak: m/z = {base_peak_mz}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate mass differences to identify fragment losses ---\n    loss_1 = molecular_ion_mz - base_peak_mz\n    print(f\"Loss from M+ to Base Peak: {molecular_ion_mz} - {base_peak_mz} = {loss_1} u\")\n    print(f\"This loss corresponds to a Chlorine atom (mass ~{mass_Cl}).
