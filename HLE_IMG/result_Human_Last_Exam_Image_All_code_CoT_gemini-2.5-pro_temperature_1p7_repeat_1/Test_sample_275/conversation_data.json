  "question": "This image is the RT-PCR result of sample A-F. The genome of 7,857 bp was linearized in the URR. Triangles denote early (AE) and late (AL) polyadenylation sites. ORFs are represented by open boxes, with primers for RT-PCR indicated below. E1F2 and E1F3 primers spanned the splice junctions nucleotides 929^3465 and 929^3506, respectively. The primers are E1F1, E4R, E5R, L2R, L1R,E1F2, and E1F3. Primer pairs and PCR cycles are indicated above each panel.The lengths of the PCR products are (B) band 1, 190 bp; band 2, 159 bp; (C) band 1, 584 bp; band 2, 553 bp; (D) 551 bp; (E) 1,005 bp; (F) 972 bp; (G) band 1, 1,003 bp; band 2, 931 bp. The intensity of band 1 in (G) increased relative to band 2. (H) Band 1, 450 bp; band 2, 419 bp; (I) bands 1–4, 450, 419, 378, and 187 bp.\n\nBased on this information, find all splice species.

    "To find and count all the unique splice species from the RT-PCR results, we will analyze each panel (B-I) and identify the distinct mRNA transcripts represented by the bands. A single splice species can be detected by different primer pairs, resulting in different-sized PCR products. We must be careful not to double-count.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze Early Transcripts:** We'll first look at panels amplifying transcripts that likely terminate at the early polyadenylation site (A_E). These are panels B, C, and D.\n2.  **Analyze Late Transcripts:** Next, we'll examine panels that use primers in the late gene region (L1, L2), indicating transcripts that terminate at the late polyadenylation site (A_L). These are panels E, F, G, H, and I.\n3.  **Identify Unique Species:** For each band or group of related bands, we will determine if it represents a new, unique splice species based on its size and the specificity of the primers used. For example, primers E1F2 and E1F3 are specific to certain splice junctions. Different sized bands from the same primer pair also represent different species.\n4.  **Count the Species:** We will tally the total number of unique species identified.\n5.  **Summarize in Code:** The process will be implemented in a Python script that explains each identified species and prints the total count as a sum.\n\n```python\ndef find_splice_species():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and counts unique splice species from the provided RT-PCR data by\n    analyzing the PCR products from each experimental panel.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step identification of unique splice species based on the provided data:\")\n\n    species_info = []\n\n    # Identification Logic:\n    # 1.
