    "To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we need to find a point on the tiling around which we can rotate the entire pattern so that it looks identical to its original position. The number of such positions during a full 360-degree turn is the order of rotational symmetry.\n\n1.  **Identify a Center of Rotation:** Let's examine the pattern to find a point of symmetry. A good candidate is the point where four of the orange rhombi meet, creating a star-like shape with the surrounding blue heptagons. Another candidate is the center of any of the yellow squares.\n\n2.  **Determine the Angle of Rotation:** If we choose the center of a yellow square as our rotation point and rotate the image, we can see that the tiling aligns with its original position after a 90-degree rotation. The central square lands on itself, and the surrounding pentagons move into the position of the next pentagon. The same is true for the entire pattern.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Order of Symmetry:** Since the smallest angle of rotation that leaves the pattern unchanged is 90 degrees, we can find the order of symmetry by dividing 360 degrees by this angle.\n\n    Order of symmetry = 360° / (minimum angle of rotation)\n    Order of symmetry = 360° / 90° = 4\n\nThis means the tiling has 4-fold rotational symmetry. It looks the same after rotations of 90°, 180°, and 270°.\n\nHere is a Python script to formalize this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rotational_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rotational symmetry of the provided tiling.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_degrees = 360\n    # By visual inspection, the smallest angle of rotation that leaves the\n    # tiling unchanged is 90 degrees. This rotation can be centered on\n    # any of the yellow squares or the point where four orange rhombi meet.\n    min_rotation_angle = 90\n\n    # The order of rotational symmetry is the total degrees in a circle\n    # divided by the minimum angle of rotation.\n    order_of_symmetry = total_degrees / min_rotation_angle\n\n    print(f\"To find the rotational symmetry, we divide the total degrees in a circle (360) by the smallest angle of rotation that leaves the pattern unchanged.\")\n    print(f\"From the image, we can see the smallest angle of rotation is {min_rotation_angle} degrees.\")\n    print(f\"The calculation is:\")\n    # The prompt requests that each number in the final equation is printed.\n    print(f\"{total_degrees} / {min_rotation_angle} = {int(order_of_symmetry)}\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the tiling has a {int(order_of_symmetry)}-fold rotational symmetry.\")\n\nsolve_rotational_symmetry()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
