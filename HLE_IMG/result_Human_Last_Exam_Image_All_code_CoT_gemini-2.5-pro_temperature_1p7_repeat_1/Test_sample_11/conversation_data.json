    "My plan to identify the country from the flag snippet is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Snippet**: I will first examine the visible portion of the flag. The image reveals the top-left section, showing three horizontal stripes in the order of Black, White, and Red from top to bottom.\n2.  **Search for Matching Flags**: I will search for national flags, both historical and current, that feature this specific Black-White-Red horizontal tricolor arrangement.\n3.  **Evaluate Candidates**: The primary candidates are the flag of the German Empire (1871-1918) and the Republic of Upper Volta (1959-1984). Since the prompt asks for a \"country,\" and these are historical, I'll consider other possibilities.\n4.  **Consider Alternative Interpretations**: A common pattern in puzzles is to alter the image. A very common flag pattern is the Red-White-Black tricolor, associated with several Arab nations (the Pan-Arab colors). If a Red-White-Black flag is displayed upside down, it appears as Black-White-Red.\n5.  **Identify the Most Likely Country**: The flag of Yemen is a plain Red-White-Black tricolor. If turned upside down, it would perfectly match the snippet shown. Other flags like Egypt's or Syria's have central emblems, making Yemen the most plausible answer under the \"upside-down\" theory.\n6.  **Final Conclusion**: Based on the evidence, the snippet most likely shows the flag of Yemen displayed upside down. I will write a Python script to print this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef guess_the_country():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a flag snippet to identify the corresponding country.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the visible colors and their arrangement.\n    colors = [\"Black\", \"White\", \"Red\"]\n    arrangement = \"Horizontal stripes from top to bottom.\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the flag snippet.\")\n    print(f\"The flag has three horizontal stripes.
