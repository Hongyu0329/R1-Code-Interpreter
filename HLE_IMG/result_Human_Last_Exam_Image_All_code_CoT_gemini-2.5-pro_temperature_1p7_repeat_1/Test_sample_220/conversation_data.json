    "Answering this question involves understanding the structure of a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice and how its atoms are arranged when projected onto a 2D plane along the [110] direction.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the FCC Structure:** Recall that an FCC unit cell has atoms at the 8 corners and the 6 face centers.\n2.  **Define the Projection:** The viewing direction is along the [110] vector. We need to project the 3D coordinates of the atoms onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to this vector. A convenient choice for the 2D plane's axes are the `[001]` and `[-110]` directions.\n3.  **Determine the Projected Pattern:** By projecting the FCC atoms, we find that they form a specific 2D repeating pattern. For the FCC [110] view, this pattern is known as a **centered rectangular lattice**. This means the pattern consists of atoms at the corners of a rectangle and an additional atom in the geometric center of that rectangle. The side lengths of this rectangle are in the ratio of `1 : sqrt(2)`.\n4.  **Analyze the Options:**\n    *   **A:** Shows two distinct rectangular grids of atoms, one nested inside the other. This pattern is characteristic of a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice viewed along the [100] direction.\n    *   **B & C:** Show skewed or parallelogram-like patterns. Projections of high-symmetry cubic structures along high-symmetry directions like [110] result in patterns with rectangular or higher symmetry (e.g., square, hexagonal). These skewed patterns are therefore incorrect.\n    *   **D:** Shows a rectangular arrangement of atoms. Although it appears complex due to multiple unit cells being shown, it is the only option that correctly depicts the topology of a centered rectangular lattice. We can identify atoms forming a rectangle and another atom at its center.\n\nThe following Python code explains these steps and logically deduces the correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef identify_fcc_110_pattern():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the process of identifying the FCC [110] projection and determines the correct image.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To identify the correct crystal lattice pattern, we follow these steps:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the expected pattern for an FCC lattice viewed along [110].\")\n    print(\"A Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice has atoms at each corner and in the center of each face of a cube.\")\n    print(\"When the 3D positions of these atoms are projected onto a 2D plane perpendicular to the [110] direction, they form a distinct pattern.\")\n    print(\"This resulting 2D pattern is a 'centered rectangular lattice'.\")\n    print(\"\\nA centered rectangular lattice unit cell has:\")\n    print(\"  - An atom at each of the four corners of a rectangle.\")\n    print(\"  - One atom precisely in the geometric center of the rectangle.\")\n    print(\"  - The ratio of the rectangle's side lengths is 1 to sqrt(2) (approximately 1.414).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the provided images based on the expected pattern.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nAnalyzing Image A:\")\n    print(\"  - Pattern: Shows two rectangular grids of atoms, one inside the other.\")\n    print(\"  - Conclusion: This represents a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) structure viewed along [100], not an FCC structure.
