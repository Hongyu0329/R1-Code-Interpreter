    This function analyzes the images of nyalas to re-identify the target individual.
    
    1.  Observe the key features of the 'Target' nyala:
        - Stripe pattern: Note the number, spacing, and faintness of the vertical white stripes.
        - Spot pattern: Critically, observe the unique constellation of white spots on the flank, just behind the shoulder. There is a prominent triangular cluster of 3-4 spots.
        - Horns: Note the length, thickness, and curvature of the horns.

    2.  Compare these features with each option:
        - A: Horns are smaller, suggesting a younger animal. Spot/stripe pattern differs.
        - B: The spot pattern on the flank is a clear match to the target, including the distinct triangular cluster. The stripes and horn shape are also consistent.
        - C: The coat color and quality are very different. Not a match.
        - D: The spot pattern is different from the target; the characteristic cluster is missing.
        - E: The spot pattern is different; the spots are more scattered.
        - F: The animal is partly obscured, but the visible markings (especially the lack of the specific spot cluster) do not match the target.

    3.  The most reliable and unique matching feature is the pattern of white spots on the flank. Image B is the only image that shares this identical 'fingerprint' with the target nyala.
    """
    # The final answer is determined by the detailed comparison of unique markings.
    # The spot pattern is the most conclusive evidence.
