    # 1. Define the parameters from the riddle.
    # A step of three hours on a 12-hour clock face.

    # 2. Set up the problem to find when the hands meet.
    # The hands meet when their positions are equal. We are looking for the
    # smallest number of ticks 'n' (where n > 0) that satisfies the condition.
    # Position of hour hand = (n * 90) % 360
    # Position of minute hand = (n * 0) % 360 = 0
    # The meeting condition is: (n * 90) % 360 = 0
    
    # This means n * 90 must be a multiple of 360.

    print(f"Let n be the number of ticks. They meet when (n * {speed_h_deg_per_tick}) is a multiple of 360.")
    print(f"The first meeting (for k=1) occurs when: n * {speed_h_deg_per_tick} = {k} * 360")
    print(f"Solving for n gives: n = {multiple_of_360} / {speed_h_deg_per_tick} = {ticks_to_meet} ticks.")

    print("The final position equation, showing each number, is:")

    # 5. Convert the final position to a time and print the final answer.
    # 0 degrees on a clock is the 12 o'clock position.
