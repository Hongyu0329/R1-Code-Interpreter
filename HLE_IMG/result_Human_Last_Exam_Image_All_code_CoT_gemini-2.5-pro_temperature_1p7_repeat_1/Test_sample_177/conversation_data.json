    "To calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the total Car VMT for the Baseline scenario.** For each distance category, we'll multiply the share of total trips by the total car mode share (sum of 'car, 1 occupant' and 'car, with more than 2 occupants') and then by the average trip distance. We sum these values across all distance categories to get the total Baseline Car VMT.\n2.  **Calculate the total Car VMT for the Proposed scenario.** We will repeat the same calculation using the data from the Proposed scenario table.\n3.  **Calculate the percentage reduction.** The reduction is calculated using the formula: `((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100`.\n\nThe following Python code performs these calculations.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_vmt_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage reduction in Car VMT from Baseline to Proposed scenarios.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Common data for both scenarios\n    share_of_total_trips = [0.48, 0.22, 0.14, 0.16]\n    avg_trip_distance = [1, 4, 7.5, 20]\n    distance_categories = [\"0-3 miles\", \"3-5 miles\", \"5-10 miles\", \"10+ miles\"]\n\n    # --- Baseline Scenario Data (Table 1) ---\n    baseline_car_1_occ = [0.25, 0.38, 0.40, 0.42]\n    baseline_car_multi_occ = [0.28, 0.43, 0.45, 0.47]\n\n    # --- Proposed Scenario Data (Table 2) ---\n    proposed_car_1_occ = [0.01, 0.08, 0.14, 0.16]\n    proposed_car_multi_occ = [0.02, 0.19, 0.27, 0.33]\n\n    # --- VMT Calculation ---\n    # VMT is calculated as a weighted average, assuming 100 total trips.\n    # Formula: sum(share_of_trips * (car_1_occ_share + car_multi_occ_share) * avg_distance)\n    \n    baseline_vmt = 0\n    proposed_vmt = 0\n    \n    print(\"Calculating Baseline Car VMT:\")\n    baseline_vmt_eq_parts = []\n    for i in range(len(distance_categories)):\n        total_car_share = baseline_car_1_occ[i] + baseline_car_multi_occ[i]\n        vmt_part = share_of_total_trips[i] * total_car_share * avg_trip_distance[i]\n        baseline_vmt += vmt_part\n        baseline_vmt_eq_parts.append(f\"({share_of_total_trips[i]} * ({baseline_car_1_occ[i]} + {baseline_car_multi_occ[i]}) * {avg_trip_distance[i]})\")\n    \n    print(\"Baseline VMT Equation:\")\n    print(\" + \".join(baseline_vmt_eq_parts))\n    print(f\"= {baseline_vmt:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Calculating Proposed Car VMT:\")\n    proposed_vmt_eq_parts = []\n    for i in range(len(distance_categories)):\n        total_car_share = proposed_car_1_occ[i] + proposed_car_multi_occ[i]\n        vmt_part = share_of_total_trips[i] * total_car_share * avg_trip_distance[i]\n        proposed_vmt += vmt_part\n        proposed_vmt_eq_parts.append(f\"({share_of_total_trips[i]} * ({proposed_car_1_occ[i]} + {proposed_car_multi_occ[i]}) * {avg_trip_distance[i]})\")\n        \n    print(\"Proposed VMT Equation:\")\n    print(\" + \".join(proposed_vmt_eq_parts))\n    print(f\"= {proposed_vmt:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Percentage Reduction Calculation ---\n    vmt_reduction = ((baseline_vmt - proposed_vmt) / baseline_vmt) * 100\n\n    print(\"Calculating Percentage Reduction:\")\n    print(f\"((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100\")\n    print(f\"Percentage Reduction = (({baseline_vmt:.4f} - {proposed_vmt:.4f}) / {baseline_vmt:.4f}) * 100\")\n    print(f\"Percentage Reduction = {vmt_reduction:.1f}%\")\n\n    return vmt_reduction\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    final_reduction = calculate_vmt_reduction()\n    print(f\"<<<{final_reduction:.1f}>>>\")\n```"
