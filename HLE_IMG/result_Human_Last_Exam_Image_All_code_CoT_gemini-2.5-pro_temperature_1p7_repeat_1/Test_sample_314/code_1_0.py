# There is a conflict in the raw data: sim 1 has both min t and max s.
# The problem implies a unique mapping (permutation). This suggests the visual
# data for plot 1 might be misleading.
# Let's assume the mappings for plots 2 and 4 are clear, and use logic to find the rest.
# Plot 4 is the only one with s < 0, so it has the unique sign.
# Plot 2 has the lowest asymmetry visually (A=2), so it most likely has min |s|.
# This leaves plots 1 and 3 for conditions 'min t' and 'max s'.
# Calculation from P1 visuals: t1 is min, s1 is max. This is the conflict.
# Calculation from P3 visuals: t3 is max, s3 is intermediate.
# To resolve the conflict and satisfy the permutation rule, one of the assignments for P1 must be incorrect.
# Given the options, it is more plausible that P1 has 'min t' and P3 has 'max s'.
# This contradicts the calculation (s1 > s3), implying the visual asymmetry of P1 is off.
# We will proceed with the most logical assignment that forms a permutation.
