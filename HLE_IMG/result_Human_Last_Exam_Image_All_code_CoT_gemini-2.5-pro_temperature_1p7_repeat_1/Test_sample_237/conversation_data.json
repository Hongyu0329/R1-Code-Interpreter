    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that identifies the animal and its scientific name.\n\nYes, there is an animal in the image. Based on its distinct markings, long antennae, and body shape, it is a species of longhorn beetle. I will provide the scientific name in the code below.\n\n```python\ndef identify_animal():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the animal in the image and prints its scientific name.\n  \"\"\"\n  animal_present = True\n  animal_type = \"insect (Longhorn Beetle)\"\n  scientific_name = \"Stictoleptura cordigera\"\n\n  if animal_present:\n    print(\"Yes, there is an animal in this image.\")\n    print(f\"The animal is an {animal_type}.\")\n    print(f\"What is the animal's scientific name? \\nIts scientific name is: {scientific_name}\")\n\nidentify_animal()\n```\n<<<Stictoleptura cordigera>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Is there an animal in this image?
