    This function determines the stereochemical assignments for the four stereocenters in the reaction.
    The analysis is as follows:
    1. Stereocenter 1 (Acyl chloride): The priorities are (1)-OCH3, (2)-COCl, (3)-CF3, (4)-Ph. The configuration is (R).
    2. Stereocenter 2 (Alcohol): The priorities are (1)-OH, (2)-CH2OCH3, (3)-CH2CH(CH3)2, (4)-H. The configuration is (R).
    3. Stereocenter 3 (Product, from alcohol): The reaction retains configuration. It is (R).
    4. Stereocenter 4 (Product, from acyl chloride): The 3D arrangement is retained, but CIP priorities change.
       New priorities: (1)-OCH3, (2)-CF3, (3)-COOR, (4)-Ph. This change flips the assignment to (S).
    The sequence is R, R, R, S.
