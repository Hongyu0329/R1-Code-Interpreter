    # Part 1: Identify the specific receptor domain for S100B.
    # The diagram shows S100B (a green triangle) binding to the extracellular part of the RAGE receptor.
    # This extracellular part is composed of domains labeled V, C1, and C2. The V-domain (variable domain)
    # is the primary binding site for ligands on immunoglobulin superfamily receptors like RAGE.
    receptor = "RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts)"
    domain = "V-domain"

    # Part 2: Determine if S100B is an adjunct or prognostic marker.
    # A prognostic marker can independently predict a disease's outcome. An adjunct marker is used with others.
    # The diagram shows that the final outcome (Neuroinflammation, Neuronal loss, Neurodegeneration)
    # is triggered by the convergence of multiple pathways. S100B-RAGE is one, but TLR4 and TNF-alpha
    # also contribute to the activation of the key molecule NFkB.
    # Since S100B is not the sole cause, it cannot be a sole prognostic marker.
    marker_type = "adjunct marker"
    justification = """The final pathological outcomes are a result of converging pathways involving not only S100B, but also TLR4 and TNF-α, all of which activate NF-κB.
