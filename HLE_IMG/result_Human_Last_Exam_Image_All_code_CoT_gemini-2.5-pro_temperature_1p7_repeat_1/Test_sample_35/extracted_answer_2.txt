Based on the diagram, the S100B protein exhibits a strong affinity for the V-domain of the RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts).

In the pathology of neurological disorders, S100B should be considered an adjunct marker, not a sole prognostic marker. The final pathological outcomes are a result of converging pathways involving not only S100B, but also TLR4 and TNF-α, all of which activate NF-κB. Because multiple signaling molecules contribute to the disease pathology, the level of S100B alone is insufficient to predict the overall course or severity of the disorder. Its utility is highest when used in combination with other clinical data and biomarkers.
