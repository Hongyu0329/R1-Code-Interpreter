    This function identifies the missing reactant in the provided chemical synthesis.
    The reaction sequence is a well-known method for creating cyclohexane-1,3-diones.
    1. A Wittig reaction forms an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.
    2. A Michael addition of a malonate ester enolate to this ketone.
    3. An intramolecular Claisen condensation to form a six-membered ring.
    4. Saponification and decarboxylation to yield the final product.
    The reactant that enables this sequence is a malonic ester. The most common and simple choice is diethyl malonate.
