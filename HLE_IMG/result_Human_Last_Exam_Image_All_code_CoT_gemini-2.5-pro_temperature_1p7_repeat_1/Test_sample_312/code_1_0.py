def solve_swnt_puzzle():
    """
    This function solves the puzzle by identifying the chiral index 'm' for each of the nine plots.
    The reasoning is based on the electronic and structural properties of SWNTs with n=4 and m=0,1,2,3,4.
    
    Summary of analysis:
    - (4,0): Semiconducting, Zigzag, n^2+nm+m^2=16 (Least bands/lines) -> Plots #9 (band structure) & #4 (oscillator)
    - (4,1): Metallic, Chiral, n^2+nm+m^2=21 -> Plots #7 (band structure) & #2 (oscillator)
    - (4,2): Semiconducting, Chiral, n^2+nm+m^2=28 -> Plots #3 (band structure) & #6 (oscillator)
    - (4,3): Semiconducting, Chiral, n^2+nm+m^2=37 -> Plots #5 (band structure) & #8 (oscillator)
    - (4,4): Metallic, Armchair, n^2+nm+m^2=48 (Most bands/lines) -> Plot #1 (band structure), oscillator plot omitted.

    This leads to the following sequence of m-values for plots 1 through 9.
