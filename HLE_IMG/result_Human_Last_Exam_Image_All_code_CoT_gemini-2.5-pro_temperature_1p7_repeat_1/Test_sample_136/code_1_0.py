  """
  Determines and prints the minimal generators for the symmetry group shown in the image.

  The analysis of the image reveals the following:
  1.  The necklace is a regular hexagon with 6 beads.
  2.  The transformations between colorings within an equivalence class (a row) include rotations and reflections.
  3.  A rotation is evident between the 1st and 3rd colorings. Since there are 6 beads, this smallest rotation must be 360/6 = 60 degrees.
  4.  A reflection is evident between the 1st and 2nd colorings.
  5.  A group containing a rotation of order 6 and a reflection is the dihedral group D6.
  6.  A minimal set of generators for D6 is a single rotation of 360/6 degrees and any single reflection.
