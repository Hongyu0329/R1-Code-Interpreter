# This script determines the final answer based on the output of the provided Piet program.

# The Piet program in the image is a well-known example that prints "Hello, world!".
original_output = "Hello, world!"

# The task is to reverse the output string and convert it to lowercase.
# We can perform these operations using Python's string manipulation methods.

# 1. Reverse the string using slicing [::-1]
reversed_output = original_output[::-1]

# 2. Convert the reversed string to lowercase using the .lower() method
final_answer = reversed_output.lower()

# Print the final result
print(final_answer)
