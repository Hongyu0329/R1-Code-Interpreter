The best move is G*31.

This move initiates a forced checkmate sequence (tsume). While not an immediate check, it creates an unstoppable threat.

The main line is as follows:
1. Sente (Black) plays G*31. (Gold drop at file 3, rank 1)
2. Gote (White) must respond, with Kx31 being the most likely move. (King takes Gold at 3, 1)
3. Sente plays B+x32+. (Promoted Bishop takes Gold at 3, 2, check)
4. Gote's only escape is K-21. (King moves to 2, 1)
5. Sente plays G*22+. (Gold drop at 2, 2, check)
6. Gote is forced to play K-12. (King moves to 1, 2)
7. Sente plays B+-22#. (Promoted Bishop moves to 2, 2, checkmate)

This is a mate in 7 moves. Therefore, G*31 is the decisive move.
