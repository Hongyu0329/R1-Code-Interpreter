  Analyzes the image sequence and identifies the biological process.
  
  The image shows a time-lapse (L -> M -> N) of a fungal hypha.
  1. Panel L: A standard hypha with a septum dividing two cells.
  2. Panel M: A small, hook-like outgrowth (indicated by the arrowhead) starts forming from the subapical cell, growing backward.
  3. Panel N: The hook-like structure, known as a clamp, has elongated and is curving back towards the cell from which it originated.
  
  This unique process is known as 'Clamp connection formation'. It is characteristic of
  dikaryotic hyphae in Basidiomycete fungi and serves to maintain the dikaryotic (n+n)
  condition during cell division by ensuring each daughter cell receives a set of differing nuclei.
