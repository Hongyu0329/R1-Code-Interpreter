    "Based on the visual evidence from the image sequence, I will identify the biological process being depicted.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the image sequence:** I will examine the three panels, L, M, and N, as a time-lapse progression. The subject is a multicellular, filamentous structure, characteristic of a fungal hypha.\n2.  **Identify key morphological changes:** I will focus on the area marked by the arrowheads. In panel L, we see a normal septum between two cells. In panel M, a small bulge forms and begins to grow backward from the cell wall. By panel N, this has developed into a distinct hook-like or clamp-like structure.\n3.  **Determine the biological process:** This specific formation of a backward-growing hook at the septum during cell division is a well-documented process in certain fungi. I will identify this process by its scientific name.\n4.  **Generate Python code:** As requested, I will create a Python script that uses the `print()` function to state the name of the identified process.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Capture original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer\nsys.stdout = buffer = io.StringIO()\n\ndef identify_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  Analyzes the image sequence and identifies the biological process.\n  \n  The image shows a time-lapse (L -> M -> N) of a fungal hypha.\n  1. Panel L: A standard hypha with a septum dividing two cells.\n  2. Panel M: A small, hook-like outgrowth (indicated by the arrowhead) starts forming from the subapical cell, growing backward.\n  3. Panel N: The hook-like structure, known as a clamp, has elongated and is curving back towards the cell from which it originated.\n  \n  This unique process is known as 'Clamp connection formation'. It is characteristic of\n  dikaryotic hyphae in Basidiomycete fungi and serves to maintain the dikaryotic (n+n)\n  condition during cell division by ensuring each daughter cell receives a set of differing nuclei.\n  \"\"\"\n  process_name = \"Clamp connection formation\"\n  print(f\"The process being depicted in the image is: {process_name}\")\n\nidentify_process()\n\n# Restore original stdout\nsys.stdout = original_stdout\n# Get the output from the buffer\noutput = buffer.getvalue()\nprint(output)\n\n# The final answer is the name of the process.\nfinal_answer = \"Clamp connection formation\"\n```\n<<<Clamp connection formation>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
