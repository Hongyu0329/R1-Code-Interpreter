    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the main carbon chain and chiral centers:** The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (-OH, alcohol) has 5 carbons. The molecule is **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**. The chiral centers are at carbons C2, C3, and C4.\n\n2.  **Address Ambiguities:** The stereochemistry at C2 is drawn ambiguously, with two groups (-OH and -CH3) on dashed bonds. This is stereochemically impossible. A common convention in drawing such complex acyclic molecules is to represent an `anti` relationship between major substituents on adjacent carbons. The substituents on C3 (Ethyl) and C4 (Methyl) are `anti` to each other (one wedge, one dash relative to the plane of the zig-zag backbone). We will assume this pattern continues, meaning the substituent at C2 (-OH or -CH3) should be `anti` to the Ethyl group on C3. Since the Ethyl group is on a wedge (forward), the major substituent on C2, the -OH group, is assumed to be on a dash (back), and the minor substituent, -CH3, is on a wedge (forward).\n\n3.  **Assign Priorities (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Rules):** For each chiral center, we will assign priorities (1=highest, 4=lowest) to the four attached groups based on atomic number.\n\n4.  **Determine R/S Configuration:**\n    *   For **C3** and **C4**, the stereochemistry is clearly drawn.\n    *   For **C2**, we use the corrected stereochemistry from step 2.\n    *   The rule is: If the lowest priority group (4) is in the back, a clockwise path from 1 -> 2 -> 3 is **R**, and a counter-clockwise path is **S**. If group 4 is in the front, the result is reversed.\n\nThe following Python script will walk through this determination for each chiral center and print the final configuration.\n\n```python\ndef determine_configuration():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines and explains the absolute configuration of the molecule shown in the image.\n    The molecule is identified as 5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Determining the absolute configuration of 5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol.\")\n    print(\"The carbon chain is numbered to give the -OH group the lowest number (C2).\\n\")\n\n    # --- Analysis of Chiral Center C2 ---\n    print(\"--- Analysis of C2 ---\")\n    print(\"The drawing at C2 is ambiguous.
