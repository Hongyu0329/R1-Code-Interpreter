    "Of course, I can help you with this task. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Identify Molecules and Their Structures:** First, I will identify the three distinct molecules depicted in the image: the two reactants and the one product. I will determine their chemical structures and represent them using SMILES strings, which is a standard format for computational chemistry.\n2.  **Filter by Crippen logP:** The problem requires us to consider only molecules with a Crippen logP greater than 1. I will use the RDKit library in Python to calculate this property for each of the three molecules.\n3.  **Calculate Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI):** For each molecule that meets the logP > 1 criterion, I will calculate its Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI). The problem specifies that this calculation must include hydrogen atoms. The ECI for a molecule is calculated with the formula:\n    ECI = Σ (degreeᵢ * eccentricityᵢ)\n    This sum is taken over all atoms *i* (including hydrogens) in the molecule.\n    *   **degreeᵢ** is the number of bonds connected to atom *i*.\n    *   **eccentricityᵢ** is the longest shortest-path distance from atom *i* to any other atom in the molecule.\n4.  **Sum the Indices:** Finally, as requested by \"Find the Sum of Eccentric Connectivity Indices\", I will sum the ECI values of all the molecules that passed the logP filter.\n5.  **Generate Output:** The Python code will be constructed to perform all these steps. Crucially, it will print the full equation used for the final sum, showing each `degree * eccentricity` term for every atom in the qualifying molecules, before printing the final total sum.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem import Descriptors\n\ndef get_eci_terms(smiles_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the terms (degree * eccentricity) for the ECI of a molecule.\n    Each term corresponds to one atom (including hydrogens).\n\n    Args:\n        smiles_string (str): The SMILES representation of the molecule.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing:\n            - int: The total Eccentric Connectivity Index value.\n            - list: A list of strings, where each string is a \"degree * eccentricity\" term.\n    \"\"\"\n    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles_string)\n    if not mol:\n        print(f\"Warning: Could not parse SMILES '{smiles_string}'\")\n        return 0, []\n\n    # The calculation must include hydrogens\n    mol_with_hs = Chem.AddHs(mol)\n    \n    # The distance matrix stores the shortest path between any two atoms\n    dist_matrix = Chem.GetDistanceMatrix(mol_with_hs)\n    num_atoms = mol_with_hs.GetNumAtoms()\n\n    eci = 0\n    terms = []\n\n    for i in range(num_atoms):\n        atom = mol_with_hs.GetAtomWithIdx(i)\n        degree = atom.GetDegree()\n        # Eccentricity is the maximum value in the atom's row of the distance matrix\n        eccentricity = int(np.max(dist_matrix[i]))\n        \n        term_value = degree * eccentricity\n        eci += term_value\n        terms.append(f\"{degree} * {eccentricity}\")\n\n    return eci, terms\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to execute the plan: identify, filter, calculate, and sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # SMILES strings for the three molecules identified from the image\n    # Reactant 1: 3-((3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)oxy)-5-fluoropyridin-2-amine\n    smiles_A = \"Nc1nc(F)cc(OOCc2cc(OC)c(OC)c(OC)c2)c1\"\n    # Reactant 2: 7-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine\n    smiles_B = \"c1ncc2c(n1)N(Cl)CC2\"\n    # Product: 4-(6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-yl)-5-fluoropyridin-2-amine\n    smiles_C = \"Nc1ncc(F)cc1N1CCc2ncncc12\"\n\n    all_molecules = [smiles_A, smiles_B, smiles_C]\n    \n    qualified_molecules_smiles = []\n    print(\"Step 1: Filtering molecules with Crippen logP > 1\")\n    for i, smiles in enumerate(all_molecules):\n        mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)\n        if mol:\n            logP = Descriptors.MolLogP(mol)\n            print(f\"  - Molecule {i+1}: logP = {logP:.3f}\", end=\"\")\n            if logP > 1:\n                qualified_molecules_smiles.append(smiles)\n                print(\" -> Qualifies\")\n            else:\n                print(\" -> Does not qualify\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculating the Sum of Eccentric Connectivity Indices for qualified molecules.\")\n\n    grand_total_eci = 0\n    all_terms = []\n\n    for smiles in qualified_molecules_smiles:\n        eci, terms = get_eci_terms(smiles)\n        grand_total_eci += eci\n        all_terms.extend(terms)\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final result is the sum of (degree * eccentricity) for every atom in every qualifying molecule.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    # Printing the full equation as requested\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(all_terms)\n    print(f\"Sum = {equation_string}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nTotal Sum of Eccentric Connectivity Indices = {grand_total_eci}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<2072>>>"
