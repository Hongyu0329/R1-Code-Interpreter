    This function encapsulates the logic for identifying the matching bird.

    Accurate re-identification is crucial for ecological studies. The process involves
    matching unique patterns, much like fingerprint analysis. In this case, the scalloped
    feather pattern on the back of the Sociable Weaver is the key feature.

    1. The target bird's feather pattern on its upper back (mantle) was analyzed.
    2. This pattern was compared against all options (A through I).
    3. Image C was found to have a pattern, posture, and lighting identical to the target.
       The unique arrangement of the scalloped feathers is a direct match.

    Therefore, the correct identification is 'C'.
