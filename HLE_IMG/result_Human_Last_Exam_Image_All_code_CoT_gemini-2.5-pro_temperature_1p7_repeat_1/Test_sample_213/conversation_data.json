    "My analysis of the sheet music leads to the identification of the opera. Here is my step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.  **Language and Context:** The instrument names (\"gr. Fl.\" for Große Flöte, \"Hob.\" for Oboe, \"engl. Horn\", \"Fag.\" for Fagott) and musical directions (\"Vorhang\" for Curtain, \"mit Dämpfer\" for with mute) are in German. This strongly suggests the opera is by a German or Austrian composer. The indication \"1 (Vorhang)\" signifies that this music is played at the very beginning of an act, before the curtain rises.\n\n2.  **Musical Style:** The music is highly chromatic and complex, lacking a traditional key signature. This style, along with the large orchestra and specific effects like `glissando`, is characteristic of the early 20th-century expressionist movement in music.\n\n3.  **Identification:** Based on these characteristics, I can narrow down the possibilities to major German/Austrian operas from that period. The distinct, angular melody and the specific orchestration are hallmarks of Alban Berg's work. A comparison confirms that this score is the exact opening of Act II of Alban Berg's groundbreaking opera, \"Wozzeck\".\n\nI will now provide a Python script to state this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef identify_opera():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the opera based on the analysis of the provided sheet music.\n    The analysis points to a specific early 20th-century German expressionist opera.\n    \"\"\"\n    opera_name = \"Wozzeck\"\n    composer = \"Alban Berg\"\n    act_number = 2\n\n    print(f\"The sheet music is from the beginning of Act {act_number} of the opera '{opera_name}' by {composer}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    identify_opera()\n```\n<<<Wozzeck>>>"
