    "This is a classic emission spectrum. Each element, when excited, emits light at specific, characteristic wavelengths, creating a unique \"fingerprint.\" The image provided shows a very dense and complex spectrum with thousands of lines spanning the entire visible range, from blue to red.\n\nMy plan to identify the element is as follows:\n1.  Analyze the key features of the provided spectrum. It is not simple, like Hydrogen (which has only four visible lines), nor is it dominated by a few colors, like Sodium (yellow) or Neon (red-orange). Its most notable feature is its complexity and richness of lines across all colors.\n2.  Compare this characteristic pattern against the known emission spectra of various elements.\n3.  The element with an exceptionally complex and line-rich spectrum across the visible range is Iron (Fe). It is often used as a wavelength calibration source in spectroscopy because of its numerous, well-defined spectral lines.\n4.  I will write a Python script that encapsulates this identification process by comparing the description of the observed spectrum with a small database of known spectral characteristics.\n\n```python\ndef identify_element_from_spectrum():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies an element by comparing the characteristics of its\n    emission spectrum to a database of known spectra.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # A simplified database of spectral characteristics for common elements.\n    spectral_database = {\n        \"Hydrogen\": \"A simple spectrum with four prominent lines in the visible range (red, blue-green, blue, violet).\",\n        \"Helium\": \"A spectrum with several bright, distinct lines spread out across the visible range.\",\n        \"Sodium\": \"A spectrum dominated by a very strong and close pair of lines in the yellow region.\",\n        \"Neon\": \"A spectrum with numerous, very bright lines in the red-orange part of the spectrum.\",\n        \"Iron\": \"A very complex spectrum with thousands of lines distributed across the entire visible range.\"\n    }\n\n    # Description of the observed spectrum from the image.\n    observed_spectrum_description = \"A very complex spectrum with thousands of lines distributed across the entire visible range.\"\n\n    # Find the element that matches the description.\n    identified_element = None\n    for element, description in spectral_database.items():\n        if description == observed_spectrum_description:\n            identified_element = element\n            break\n\n    if identified_element:\n        print(f\"The observed spectrum is characteristic of the element: {identified_element}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Could not identify the element based on the provided description.\")\n\nidentify_element_from_spectrum()\n```\n<<<Iron>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
