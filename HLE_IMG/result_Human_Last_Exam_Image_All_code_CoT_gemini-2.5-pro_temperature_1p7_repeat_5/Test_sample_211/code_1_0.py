# The user wants me to identify the correct image from a set of options.
# By carefully comparing the feather patterns, particularly the scalloped markings on the back,
# the white edges of the wing feathers, and the overall posture, I can determine the match.

# 1. Observe the 'Target' image: Note the specific scale-like pattern on the back, the pose,
#    the lighting, and a unique small dark fleck near the upper center of the back.
# 2. Compare with image 'A': The lighting is much darker, making comparison difficult. The head is turned more.
# 3. Compare with image 'B': The pattern seems finer and the bird's coloration is lighter.
# 4. Compare with image 'C': The pose is identical. The scalloped pattern is a perfect match.
#    The small dark fleck is visible in the same spot. The lighting and shadows are consistent. This is a very strong candidate.
# 5. Compare with image 'D': The bird is angled differently.
# 6. Compare with image 'E': The pattern is very similar, but the arrangement on the shoulder is slightly different.
# 7. Compare with image 'F': The image is too dark.
# 8. Compare with image 'G': This image is also a perfect match, seemingly identical to image C and the Target.
# 9. Compare with image 'H': The contrast is too high, changing the appearance of the patterns.
# 10. Compare with image 'I': The pattern seems less distinct or slightly blurred compared to the target.

# Both C and G are perfect matches. In such cases, there might be duplicate correct answers in the test set.
# I will select the first correct match found.
correct_image = 'C'
