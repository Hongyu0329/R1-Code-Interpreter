    This function identifies the final product of the given reaction scheme.
    
    The reaction is a three-step synthesis:
    1.  Cbz protection of L-tryptophan's amine group.
    2.  Amide coupling of the carboxylic acid with O-benzylhydroxylamine.
    3.  Hydrogenation to remove both the Cbz and O-benzyl protecting groups.
    
    The final product is Tryptophan where the carboxylic acid is converted to a hydroxamic acid.
    Its SMILES string is 'N[C@@H](CC1=CNC2=C1C=CC=C2)C(=O)NO'.
    This script will find the common name for this molecule.
