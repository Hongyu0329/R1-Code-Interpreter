    "Based on the visual evidence from the image sequence, I will identify the biological process being shown. My plan is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image Sequence:** I will examine the three panels (L, M, N) to observe the changes occurring to the filamentous structure over time.\n2.  **Identify Key Events:** I'll note the appearance of the new bulge in panel M and its subsequent growth in panel N, which is highlighted by the arrowheads.\n3.  **Determine the Biological Process:** Based on the observed formation of a new side-growth from the main filament, I will identify the specific biological term for this process.\n4.  **Generate a Python Script:** I will create a Python script that prints a clear, step-by-step explanation of what is happening in the images.\n5.  **Provide the Final Answer:** I will state the name of the process in the required final answer format.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef describe_process():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints an explanation of the biological process shown in the image.\n    The image sequence (L, M, N) shows a filamentous structure, likely a fungal hypha,\n    undergoing a specific type of growth.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    title = \"Analysis of the Biological Process\"\n    print(title)\n    print(\"=\" * len(title))\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\n    The images depict the process of hyphal branching, a key mechanism of growth in fungi and other filamentous organisms. This process allows the organism to expand its network (mycelium) to explore and colonize its environment.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    steps = {\n        'Image L': \"Shows the initial state of the hypha. It is a straight filament divided into cellular compartments by cross-walls (septa).\",\n        'Image M': \"A small bulge, highlighted by the arrowhead, begins to form on the lateral wall of a sub-apical cell. This is the initiation of a new branch.\",\n        'Image N': \"The bulge has grown and elongated, forming a new lateral branch. The main hypha is now visibly bent at the branching point.\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"\\nOverall Process:\")\n    print(textwrap.fill(explanation.strip(), width=80))\n\n    print(\"\\nStep-by-Step Observation:\")\n    for step, desc in steps.items():\n        print(f\"- {step}: {desc}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the description\ndescribe_process()\n```\n<<<Hyphal branching>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
