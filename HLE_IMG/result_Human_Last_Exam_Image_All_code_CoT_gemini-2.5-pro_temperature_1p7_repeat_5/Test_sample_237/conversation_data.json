    "My plan to answer your request is as follows:\n1.  First, I will analyze the image to determine if an animal is present.\n2.  Upon confirming the presence of an animal, I will identify it. The creature in the image is an insect with long antennae and a distinct red/orange band on its back, which are characteristic features of a specific type of longhorn beetle.\n3.  I will then find the scientific name for this specific beetle. The appearance strongly matches the species *Stenocorus meridianus*.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that stores this information in variables and uses the `print()` function to display the answer clearly.\n\n```python\ndef identify_animal_in_image():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the animal in the provided image and prints its scientific name.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Confirm the presence of an animal.\n    is_animal_present = True\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the animal's scientific name.\n    # The animal is a longhorn beetle, specifically identified by its black body,\n    # prominent red/orange markings on the elytra (wing covers), and long antennae.\n    # This matches the description of Stenocorus meridianus.\n    scientific_name = \"Stenocorus meridianus\"\n\n    # Step 3: Print the result.\n    if is_animal_present:\n        print(\"Yes, there is an animal in this image.\")\n        print(f\"The animal's scientific name is: {scientific_name}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No animal is visible in the image.\")\n\n# Execute the function to get the answer.\nidentify_animal_in_image()\n```\n<<<Stenocorus meridianus>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Is there an animal in this image?
