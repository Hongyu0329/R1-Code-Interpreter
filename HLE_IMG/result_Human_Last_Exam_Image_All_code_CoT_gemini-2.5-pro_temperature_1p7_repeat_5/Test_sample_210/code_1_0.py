    This function identifies the matching nyala by analyzing key features.
    
    The target nyala is characterized by:
    1. A specific, scattered pattern of white spots on its rear flank.
    2. Relatively faint vertical stripes.
    3. A smooth, single curve to its horns with light tips.
    
    Comparing these features with the options:
    - A: Different stripes and horn shape (younger).
    - B: Matches the target's unique spot pattern, stripe faintness, and horn shape.
    - C: Stripes are too prominent.
    - D: The spot pattern is different (more linear).
    - E: Horn shape is different (more twisted).
    - F: Stripes are too prominent.
    
    Therefore, the correct image is B.
