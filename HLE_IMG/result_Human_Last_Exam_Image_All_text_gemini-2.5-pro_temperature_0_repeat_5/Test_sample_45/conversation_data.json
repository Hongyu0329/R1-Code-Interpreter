    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the concept of rotational symmetry.**\nRotational symmetry describes how many times a figure or pattern can be rotated by an angle less than 360 degrees and still look identical to its original orientation. The \"order\" of rotational symmetry is the number of such rotations possible. For example, a square has 4-fold rotational symmetry because it looks the same after rotations of 90°, 180°, and 270°.\n\n**Step 2: Examine the provided image of the tiling.**\nThe image displays a periodic tiling made up of several distinct shapes:\n*   Dark blue regular hexagons.\n*   Light yellow squares.\n*   Orange rhombuses.\n*   Light yellow irregular pentagons (let's call them \"boat\" shapes).\n\n**Step 3: Identify potential centers of rotation.**\nTo find the rotational symmetry, we need to locate points in the pattern that can act as centers of rotation. The most likely candidates are the centers of the regular polygons or specific vertices where multiple tiles meet.\n\n**Step 4: Test for different orders of rotational symmetry.**\nLet's test the most prominent regular shape, the hexagon.\n*   **Center of a Hexagon:** Select the center of any dark blue hexagon. A regular hexagon has 6 equal sides and angles, so it has 6-fold rotational symmetry on its own. We need to check if the surrounding pattern also has this symmetry.\n*   **Rotation by 60° (360°/6):** If we rotate the entire tiling by 60 degrees around the center of a hexagon, the central hexagon rotates onto itself. Observe the shapes immediately surrounding the hexagon: there are six identical \"boat\" shapes. A 60° rotation perfectly maps each boat shape onto the position of its neighbor. Looking at the entire pattern, this 60° rotation leaves the tiling unchanged.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the tiling is invariant under a 60° rotation, it possesses 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n**Step 5: Check for other, lower-order symmetries (for completeness).**\n*   **Center of a Square:** If we pick the center of a light yellow square and rotate by 90° (360°/4), the square maps onto itself, and so does the surrounding arrangement of rhombuses and boat shapes. Thus, the tiling also has centers of 4-fold rotation.\n*   **Other Centers:** It is also possible to find centers of 2-fold rotation (e.g., at the center of each orange rhombus) and 3-fold rotation (e.g., at the vertices where three boat shapes meet).\n\n**Step 6: Determine the overall rotational symmetry of the tiling.**\nA tiling can have centers of different rotational symmetries. However, the question \"what is the rotational symmetry of the tiling?\" typically asks for the highest order of rotational symmetry present in the pattern. In this case, we have found centers of 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold rotation. The highest order is 6.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe highest order of rotational symmetry present in the tiling is 6-fold, with the centers of rotation located at the center of each blue hexagon.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
