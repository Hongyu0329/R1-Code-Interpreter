    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the four complexes are expected to show shorter lifetimes.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe question asks to identify which of the four iridium complexes, used as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs), are expected to have shorter operational lifetimes. A shorter lifetime implies that the complex is less stable and degrades more quickly under operating conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Structures of the Complexes**\nAll four complexes are cationic iridium(III) complexes with the general formula [Ir(C^N)₂(N^N)]⁺, where Ir is the central metal, C^N is a cyclometalating ligand, and N^N is a bidentate diimine ligand. The counter-ion is PF₆⁻.\n*   **Central Metal and Counter-ion:** The Iridium(III) center and the PF₆⁻ counter-ion are the same for all four complexes.\n*   **N^N Ligand:** The bidentate N^N ligand is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine for all four complexes. The bulky tert-butyl groups are primarily for solubility and preventing aggregation, and since this ligand is constant, it is not the differentiating factor for stability among these complexes.\n*   **C^N Ligand:** The key difference between the four complexes lies in the substitution pattern on the phenyl ring of the 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) cyclometalating ligand.\n    *   **Complex 1:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. Fluorine atoms are at the 2- (ortho) and 4- (para) positions.\n    *   **Complex 2:** The C^N ligand is 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine. A fluorine atom is at the 4- (para) position.\n    *   **Complex 3:** The C^N ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. A fluorine atom is at the 2- (ortho) position.\n    *   **Complex 4:** The C^N ligand is 2-(3,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. Fluorine atoms are at the 3- (meta) and 4- (para) positions.\n\n**Step 3: Relate Molecular Structure to Emitter Lifetime**\nThe operational lifetime of these phosphorescent emitters is strongly linked to their chemical stability. A primary degradation pathway for cyclometalated iridium complexes involves the cleavage of the Ir-C bond, which is generally the weakest bond in the coordination sphere. The stability of this bond can be enhanced by modifying the C^N ligand.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Electronic Effects of Fluorine:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom. When attached to the phenyl ring, its strong electron-withdrawing inductive effect strengthens the carbon-metal (Ir-C) bond. A stronger bond is more resistant to breaking, leading to a more stable complex and a longer lifetime.\n2.  **Steric Effects of Fluorine:** A substituent at the ortho-position of the phenyl ring (the carbon at position 2, adjacent to the Ir-C bond) can provide steric protection. This \"steric shield\" physically blocks the approach of other molecules (like solvent, ions, or impurities) that could attack and break the vulnerable Ir-C bond. This is a very effective strategy for increasing complex stability.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate Each Complex's Stability**\nLet's evaluate each complex based on the presence and position of the fluorine substituents. The presence of an ortho-fluorine is a particularly powerful stabilizing feature.\n\n*   **Complex 1 ([1]):** Has a fluorine atom at the ortho-position (2-position) and another at the para-position (4-position). It benefits from both the steric protection of the ortho-fluorine and the strong electron-withdrawing effect of two fluorines. This complex is expected to be very stable and have a **long lifetime**.\n*   **Complex 3 ([3]):** Has a fluorine atom at the ortho-position (2-position). It benefits significantly from the steric protection of the ortho-fluorine. This complex is also expected to be very stable and have a **long lifetime**.\n*   **Complex 2 ([2]):** Has a fluorine atom only at the para-position (4-position). It benefits from some electronic stabilization of the Ir-C bond but **lacks the crucial steric protection of an ortho-fluorine**. It is therefore expected to be less stable than complexes [1] and [3]. This points to a **shorter lifetime**.\n*   **Complex 4 ([4]):** Has fluorine atoms at the meta- (3-position) and para- (4-position) positions. It benefits from a strong electronic stabilization due to two fluorines, but it also **lacks the steric protection of an ortho-fluorine**. Like complex [2], it is expected to be less stable than complexes with an ortho-fluorine. This also points to a **shorter lifetime**.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude and Select the Answer**\nThe analysis shows a clear distinction: complexes with an ortho-fluorine ([1] and [3]) are expected to be significantly more stable and have longer lifetimes. Complexes without an ortho-fluorine ([2] and [4]) are expected to be less stable and thus have shorter lifetimes.\n\nTherefore, the complexes expected to show shorter lifetimes are [2] and [4].\n\nLooking at the answer choices, the option that includes both [2] and [4] is I.\n\n<<<I>>>"
