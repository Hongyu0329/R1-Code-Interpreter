    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The goal is to find the most obvious, \"at a glance\" difference in the sporophyte (the spore-producing structure, which includes the capsule and its stalk) between the moss species *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Components of a Moss Sporophyte:** A typical moss sporophyte consists of a foot (embedded in the gametophyte), a seta (the stalk), and a capsule (which contains the spores). The features of the seta and capsule are often used for species identification.\n\n3.  **Investigate the Sporophyte of *Grimmia montana*:**\n    *   **Seta:** The seta of *Grimmia montana* is known to be short and, crucially, **straight**.\n    *   **Capsule Orientation:** Because the seta is straight, the capsule is held in an erect position. It is typically described as \"emergent\" or \"shortly exserted,\" meaning it sits just at or slightly above the level of the surrounding perichaetial leaves.\n\n4.  **Investigate the Sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta*:**\n    *   **Seta:** The specific epithet *curviseta* is a major clue. It is Latin for \"curved seta.\" The seta of this species is short but distinctly **curved or arcuate** (bent like a bow).\n    *   **Capsule Orientation:** The strong curvature of the seta causes the capsule to be oriented differently. It is typically described as \"cernuous\" (nodding) or \"pendent\" (hanging down), and it is often immersed or emergent among the leaves rather than held clearly above them.\n\n5.  **Compare and Identify the Main Difference:**\n    *   The most significant and easily observable difference between the sporophytes of these two species is the **shape of the seta**.\n    *   *Grimmia montana* has a **straight seta**, leading to an **erect capsule**.\n    *   *Grimmia curviseta* has a **curved seta**, leading to a **nodding or hanging capsule**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Nomenclature as a Clue:** The scientific name *Grimmia curviseta* directly points to the key feature. This is a common practice in taxonomy.\n*   **Visibility:** The orientation of the capsule (erect vs. nodding) is a direct result of the seta's shape and is a feature that can be seen without a microscope, making it an \"at a glance\" characteristic.\n*   **Gametophyte Similarity:** While there are differences in the gametophytes (the leafy green part), they can be subtle and often require microscopic examination of leaf cells or cross-sections. The sporophyte provides a much more straightforward distinction when present.\n*   **Image Context:** The provided image shows erect, dehisced (old) capsules on what appear to be very short, straight setae, which is consistent with the morphology of *Grimmia montana* or a similar species with straight setae. It serves as a good example of the erect capsule orientation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe primary distinguishing feature between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* is the curvature of the seta. This single feature dramatically changes the orientation of the capsule and is the most reliable way to tell them apart visually when they are fertile.\n\n<<<The main difference is the shape of the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is straight, which holds the capsule in an erect position. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a distinctly curved or arcuate seta, which causes its capsule to be nodding or pendent.>>>"
