    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the substituents at the indicated positions.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reaction Type**\nThe reaction shows a complex alcohol (a triterpenoid) reacting with catalytic acid (HCl) and heat. These are classic conditions for an acid-catalyzed dehydration followed by carbocation rearrangements. The problem explicitly states that the rearrangement involves a number of [1,2] shifts. This type of multi-step rearrangement is common in terpene and steroid chemistry and is often referred to as a \"backbone rearrangement\".\n\n**Step 2: Propose the Reaction Mechanism - Initiation**\n1.  The oxygen atom of the hydroxyl (-OH) group on the starting material gets protonated by the acid (HCl). This converts the poor leaving group -OH into a good leaving group, -OH₂⁺ (water).\n2.  The water molecule departs, leaving behind a secondary carbocation at the carbon where the alcohol was attached (let's call this C-3 based on standard numbering).\n\n**Step 3: Trace the Carbocation Rearrangement Cascade**\nThe goal of the rearrangement is to move the positive charge through the molecule via a series of shifts, typically to form more stable (e.g., tertiary) carbocations at each step. We must trace the movement of methyl groups (CH₃) and hydrogen atoms (H) to determine the final structure.\n\nA crucial observation is the structure of the product. The carbon atom bearing substituent 1 has two methyl groups attached (it's a gem-dimethyl group). This is the same as in the starting material. This implies that this gem-dimethyl group at C-4 does not participate in the rearrangement. Therefore, the standard first step of a backbone rearrangement (a 1,2-methyl shift from C-4 to C-3) does not occur here.\n\nFor the C-4 gem-dimethyl group to remain intact, the initial C-3 carbocation must be resolved differently. A plausible, though less common, alternative is a [1,3]-hydride shift, where the hydrogen from C-5 migrates directly to C-3. This bypasses C-4 and directly forms a stable tertiary carbocation at C-5, initiating the cascade from there. Let's follow this path:\n\n*   **Initial Carbocation:** C-3⁺\n*   **Shift 1 (1,3-H shift):** The hydrogen atom from C-5 migrates to C-3. The positive charge is now at C-5 (a tertiary carbocation). The gem-dimethyl group at C-4 is untouched.\n*   **Shift 2 (1,2-CH₃ shift):** The methyl group at C-10 migrates to C-5. The positive charge moves to C-10. **The substituent at position 2 (C-5) is now a CH₃ group.**\n*   **Shift 3 (1,2-H shift):** The hydrogen atom at C-9 migrates to C-10. The positive charge moves to C-9. **The substituent at position 3 (C-10) is now an H atom.**\n*   **Shift 4 (1,2-CH₃ shift):** The methyl group at C-8 migrates to C-9. The positive charge moves to C-8.\n*   **Shift 5 (1,2-CH₃ shift):** The methyl group at C-14 migrates to C-8. The positive charge moves to C-14. **The substituent at position 4 (C-8) is now a CH₃ group** (the one that came from C-14).\n*   **Shift 6 (1,2-H shift):** The hydrogen atom at C-13 migrates to C-14. The positive charge moves to C-13. **The substituent at position 5 (C-14) is now an H atom.**\n\n**Step 4: Termination of the Reaction**\nThe final carbocation is at C-13. The reaction terminates by elimination of a proton (H⁺) from an adjacent carbon to form a stable alkene. Deprotonation from C-12 results in the formation of the C-12=C-13 double bond shown in the product.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Final Substituents**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the rearrangement cascade:\n*   **Position 1:** This is one of the methyl groups of the gem-dimethyl pair at C-4. This group did not participate in the rearrangement. Therefore, **1 = CH₃**.\n*   **Position 2:** This position (C-5) originally had a hydrogen, but it received a methyl group from C-10. Therefore, **2 = CH₃**.\n*   **Position 3:** This position (C-10) originally had a methyl group, but it received a hydrogen from C-9. Therefore, **3 = H**.\n*   **Position 4:** This position (C-8) originally had a methyl group, which migrated away, but it received another methyl group from C-14. Therefore, **4 = CH₃**.\n*   **Position 5:** This position (C-14) originally had a methyl group, but it received a hydrogen from C-13. Therefore, **5 = H**.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n*   1 = CH₃\n*   2 = CH₃\n*   3 = H\n*   4 = CH₃\n*   5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
