The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 arises because the münchnone intermediate formed from N-acetyl-proline has two structurally and electronically distinct substituents at its C2 (methyl) and C4 (a methylene group constrained in a ring) positions. This dissimilarity prevents the substituent-scrambling process that occurs when the substituents are identical, as demonstrated in Reaction 2. Reaction 2 shows that when the C2 and C4 substituents are both methyl groups, they become equivalent before cycloaddition, leading to a loss of overall regioselectivity. Reaction 1 demonstrates that the cycloaddition step itself is inherently regioselective. Thus, in Reaction 3, the stable, non-isomerizing münchnone undergoes this intrinsically regioselective cycloaddition to yield a single product, Product B. The results from Reactions 1 and 2 provide the necessary context: Reaction 1 proves the cycloaddition is selective, while Reaction 2 explains why this selectivity is only observed in the final product when the scrambling side-reaction is suppressed by using dissimilar substituents, as is the case in Reaction 3.
