    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) when moving from the \"Baseline\" scenario (Table 1) to the \"Proposed\" scenario (Table 2).\n\n**2. Define Car VMT Calculation**\nVMT is the total miles traveled by vehicles. For this problem, we need to calculate the total VMT for cars. The tables provide two categories for car travel: `car, 1 occupant` and `car, with more than 2 occupants`. For VMT, we simply add their contributions, as each trip in these categories corresponds to one vehicle trip.\n\nThe total VMT can be calculated as a weighted average across all distance categories. The formula for the VMT contribution of each distance category is:\n`VMT (category) = (Share of Total Trips) × (Total Car Mode Share for that category) × (Average Trip Distance)`\n\nThe total VMT is the sum of the VMT contributions from all distance categories.\n\n**3. List Careful Points**\n*   **Focus on Car VMT:** We only need the data from the two \"car\" rows. Other modes like transit, walk, bike, and micromobility are not part of the Car VMT calculation.\n*   **VMT vs. PMT:** The question asks for Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), not Person Miles Traveled (PMT). Therefore, the \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" data is not needed. A car trip is counted as one vehicle trip regardless of the number of occupants.\n*   **Use Category-Specific Data:** We must calculate the VMT for each distance category (0-3, 3-5, 5-10, 10+ miles) separately and then sum them. Using the \"Total\" column for mode share would be incorrect because it doesn't account for the different average trip distances in each category.\n*   **Weighted Calculation:** The \"share of total trips\" for each distance category acts as a weight. This is crucial for an accurate calculation.\n\n### Step-by-step Calculation\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Total Car VMT for the Baseline Scenario (VMT_Baseline)**\n\nWe sum the VMT contributions from each distance category.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 25% + 28% = 53%\n    *   VMT = 0.48 (share of trips) × 0.53 (car share) × 1 (avg distance) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   VMT = 0.22 (share of trips) × 0.81 (car share) × 4 (avg distance) = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   VMT = 0.14 (share of trips) × 0.85 (car share) × 7.5 (avg distance) = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   VMT = 0.16 (share of trips) × 0.89 (car share) × 20 (avg distance) = 2.8480\n\n*   **Total Baseline VMT:**\n    *   VMT_Baseline = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Car VMT for the Proposed Scenario (VMT_Proposed)**\n\nWe repeat the calculation using the data from Table 2.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   VMT = 0.48 (share of trips) × 0.03 (car share) × 1 (avg distance) = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   VMT = 0.22 (share of trips) × 0.27 (car share) × 4 (avg distance) = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   VMT = 0.14 (share of trips) × 0.41 (car share) × 7.5 (avg distance) = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   VMT = 0.16 (share of trips) × 0.49 (car share) × 20 (avg distance) = 1.5680\n\n*   **Total Proposed VMT:**\n    *   VMT_Proposed = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\nThe formula for percentage reduction is: `((Initial Value - Final Value) / Initial Value) × 100%`\n\n*   **VMT Reduction:**\n    *   Reduction = VMT_Baseline - VMT_Proposed = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction:**\n    *   % Reduction = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100%\n    *   % Reduction ≈ 0.52195 × 100%\n    *   % Reduction ≈ **52.2%**\n\n### Final Answer\nBy changing the composition of mode share, the Car VMT can be reduced by approximately 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
