    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Molecular Ion (M+•) Peak and Halogen Presence**\nThe molecular ion peak is typically the peak with the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) that corresponds to the intact molecule. Looking at the high mass region of the spectrum, we see a prominent cluster of peaks at m/z 258, 260, 262, and 264. The presence of multiple peaks in the molecular ion region with a spacing of 2 mass units is characteristic of compounds containing chlorine (Cl) or bromine (Br).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Number and Type of Halogen Atoms**\nLet's analyze the isotopic patterns of the clusters to determine the halogen composition.\n*   **Chlorine (Cl):** Natural abundance is ~75.8% ³⁵Cl and ~24.2% ³⁷Cl. The ratio of M to M+2 for one Cl atom is approximately 3:1 (or 100:32).\n*   **Bromine (Br):** Natural abundance is ~50.7% ⁷⁹Br and ~49.3% ⁸¹Br. The ratio of M to M+2 for one Br atom is approximately 1:1 (or 100:98).\n\nLet's examine the cluster starting at m/z 260:\n*   m/z 260: I = 34.8%\n*   m/z 262: I = 29.0%\n*   m/z 264: I = 12.9%\n\nIf we assume m/z 260 is the molecular ion peak (M), let's normalize the intensities relative to this peak:\n*   I(260) = 100\n*   I(262) = (29.0 / 34.8) * 100 ≈ 83.3\n*   I(264) = (12.9 / 34.8) * 100 ≈ 37.0\n\nNow, let's compare this observed pattern (100 : 83.3 : 37.0) to theoretical patterns:\n*   1 Cl: 100 : 32\n*   2 Cl: 100 : 64 : 10\n*   **3 Cl:** 100 : 96 : 31\n*   1 Br: 100 : 98\n*   2 Br: 100 : 196 : 95\n*   1 Br, 1 Cl: 100 : 130 : 31\n*   1 Br, 2 Cl: 100 : 161 : 72 : 10\n\nThe observed pattern (100 : 83 : 37) is the best match for a compound containing **three chlorine atoms**. The theoretical pattern is 100:96:31. While not a perfect match, it's much closer than any other combination. Therefore, we can hypothesize that the molecular ion (containing three ³⁵Cl atoms) is at m/z 260.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Base Peak and Major Fragmentation**\nThe base peak is the most intense peak in the spectrum, which is at **m/z = 225** (I = 100%).\nLet's analyze the fragmentation that leads from the molecular ion (M=260) to the base peak (m/z=225):\n*   Mass Loss = M - Base Peak = 260 - 225 = 35 u.\nThis mass loss corresponds exactly to the mass of a chlorine radical (³⁵Cl•). The loss of a halogen radical is a very common and favorable fragmentation pathway. This strongly supports our hypothesis that M=260 and the base peak is the [M-Cl]⁺ fragment.\n\nLet's verify the isotope pattern of the base peak fragment. Since it's formed by losing one Cl atom from a molecule that had three, the fragment at m/z 225 should contain two Cl atoms.\n*   Fragment peak: m/z 225, I = 100%\n*   Fragment's M+2 peak: m/z 227, I = 66.7%\nThe theoretical intensity ratio for a fragment with two Cl atoms is M' : M'+2 ≈ 100 : 64. The observed ratio of 100 : 66.7 is an excellent match. This confirms that the base peak at m/z 225 is a fragment containing two chlorine atoms, consistent with it being [M-Cl]⁺.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Molecular Formula**\n*   Molecular Weight (of the ³⁵Cl₃ isotopologue) = 260 u.\n*   The molecule contains 3 Cl atoms. Mass of 3 x ³⁵Cl = 105 u.\n*   The mass of the non-halogen part (CₓHᵧ) = 260 - 105 = 155 u.\n*   To find the formula for CₓHᵧ:\n    *   Divide by the mass of carbon (12): 155 / 12 ≈ 12.9. The maximum number of carbons is 12.\n    *   If x = 12, mass of C₁₂ = 12 * 12 = 144 u.\n    *   Remaining mass for hydrogen = 155 - 144 = 11 u. So, y = 11.\n*   The molecular formula is **C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃**.\n\n**Step 5: Propose a Structure and IUPAC Name**\nThe formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃ has a Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) of:\nDBE = C - H/2 - X/2 + 1 = 12 - (11/2) - (3/2) + 1 = 12 - 7 + 1 = 6.\nA DBE of 6 suggests the presence of a benzene ring (DBE=4) and other unsaturations (e.g., another ring and a double bond).\n\nA plausible structure that fits the formula and fragmentation pattern is an isomer of trichlorophenylcyclohexene. For example:\n*   **1-(2,4,5-trichlorophenyl)cyclohex-1-ene**\nThis structure has the correct formula (C₁₂H₁₁) and DBE (benzene ring=4, cyclohexene ring=1, double bond=1, total=6). The fragmentation by loss of a chlorine atom from the aromatic ring would lead to a stable benzylic-type cation, explaining why [M-Cl]⁺ is the base peak. Subsequent losses of the other two Cl atoms are also observed at m/z 190 ([M-2Cl]⁺) and m/z 155 ([M-3Cl]⁺).\n\nThe systematic IUPAC name for this compound is **1-(2,4,5-trichlorophenyl)cyclohex-1-ene**. (Other isomers are possible, but this is a valid structure consistent with the data).\n\nFinal Answer: Based on the detailed analysis of the molecular ion cluster, base peak, and fragmentation pattern, the compound is an isomer of trichlorophenylcyclohexene with the formula C₁₂H₁₁Cl₃.\n\n<<<1-(2,4,5-trichlorophenyl)cyclohex-1-ene>>>"
