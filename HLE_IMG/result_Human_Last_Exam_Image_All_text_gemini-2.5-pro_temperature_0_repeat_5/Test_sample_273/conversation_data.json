    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral centers and number the main carbon chain.**\n\n1.  **Identify the principal functional group:** The molecule contains a hydroxyl (-OH) group and an amino (-NH2) group. According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the amine group has higher priority than the alcohol group. Therefore, the molecule is named as an amine.\n2.  **Find the longest carbon chain containing the carbon attached to the amine group:** The longest such chain has 5 carbon atoms.\n3.  **Number the carbon chain:** We number the chain starting from the end that gives the carbon attached to the principal functional group (-NH2) the lowest possible number. The carbon in the -CH2NH2 group is C1. The chain is numbered from right to left.\n    *   C1: The carbon in the -CH2NH2 group.\n    *   C2: The carbon bonded to a methyl group.\n    *   C3: The carbon bonded to an ethyl group.\n    *   C4: The carbon bonded to a hydroxyl group and a methyl group.\n    *   C5: The terminal methyl group on the left.\n    The IUPAC name is **4-hydroxy-3-ethyl-2-methylpentan-1-amine**.\n4.  **Identify the chiral centers:** A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n    *   C1 is not chiral (bonded to two hydrogens).\n    *   C2 is bonded to -H, -CH3, -CH2NH2, and the rest of the chain (-C3...). These four groups are different. **C2 is a chiral center.**\n    *   C3 is bonded to -H, -CH2CH3, the C2-part of the chain, and the C4-part of the chain. These four groups are different. **C3 is a chiral center.**\n    *   C4 is bonded to -H, -OH, -CH3, and the rest of the chain (-C3...). These four groups are different. **C4 is a chiral center.**\n    *   C5 is not chiral (bonded to three hydrogens).\n\nSo, we need to determine the absolute configuration (R or S) for the three chiral centers: C2, C3, and C4.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the configuration of each chiral center using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules.**\n\n**Configuration at C2:**\n1.  **Assign priorities:** The groups attached to C2 are -CH2NH2, -CH(Et)CH(OH)CH3 (the C3-group), -CH3, and -H.\n    *   Priority 1: -CH2NH2 (The first atom attached is C, which is bonded to N. N has a higher atomic number than C or H).\n    *   Priority 2: -CH(Et)CH(OH)CH3 (The first atom is C, bonded to other carbons).\n    *   Priority 3: -CH3 (The first atom is C, bonded only to hydrogens).\n    *   Priority 4: -H (Lowest atomic number).\n2.  **Analyze the 3D structure:** At C2, the -CH2NH2 group is on a wedge (coming out), the -CH3 group is on a dash (going back), and the C2-C3 bond is in the plane. The implied -H atom must also be in the plane.\n3.  **Determine R/S:** To determine the configuration, we orient the molecule so the lowest priority group (-H, #4) points away from us. A simple way is to use the swap method. We swap the position of the -H group (#4) with the group that is pointing away, which is -CH3 (#3).\n    *   After the swap, -H is on the dash. The other groups are: -CH2NH2 (#1) on a wedge, the C3-group (#2) in the plane (left), and -CH3 (#3) in the plane (where H was).\n    *   Now, we trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3. The path from -CH2NH2 (wedge/front) to the C3-group (left) to the -CH3 group (up) is **clockwise**. This indicates an R configuration.\n    *   Since we performed one swap, the actual configuration is the opposite. Therefore, **C2 is (S)**.\n\n**Configuration at C3:**\n1.  **Assign priorities:** The groups attached to C3 are -CH(OH)CH3 (the C4-group), -CH(Me)CH2NH2 (the C2-group), -CH2CH3 (ethyl), and -H.\n    *   Priority 1: -CH(OH)CH3 (The C is attached to an O atom).\n    *   Priority 2: -CH(Me)CH2NH2 (The C is attached to other C atoms, one of which leads to an N).\n    *   Priority 3: -CH2CH3 (The C is attached to a C and two H's).\n    *   Priority 4: -H.\n2.  **Analyze the 3D structure:** At C3, the ethyl group is on a wedge (coming out). The C3-C2 and C3-C4 bonds are in the plane. The implied -H atom must be on a dash (going back).\n3.  **Determine R/S:** The lowest priority group (-H, #4) is already pointing away. We can directly trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3.\n    *   The path from the C4-group (#1, left) to the C2-group (#2, right) to the ethyl group (#3, wedge/front) is **counter-clockwise**.\n    *   Therefore, **C3 is (S)**.\n\n**Configuration at C4:**\n1.  **Assign priorities:** The groups attached to C4 are -OH, -CH(Et)CH(Me)CH2NH2 (the C3-group), -CH3, and -H.\n    *   Priority 1: -OH (O has the highest atomic number).\n    *   Priority 2: -CH(Et)CH(Me)CH2NH2 (C attached to other C's).\n    *   Priority 3: -CH3 (C attached to H's).\n    *   Priority 4: -H.\n2.  **Analyze the 3D structure:** The drawing at C4 is non-standard. It shows both the -OH group and the -CH3 group on dashed bonds. For a tetrahedral carbon, if two bonds are dashed and one is in the plane (the C4-C3 bond), the fourth bond (to the implied -H) must be on a wedge (coming out).\n3.  **Determine R/S:** The lowest priority group (-H, #4) is pointing towards us. We can determine the direction of the 1 -> 2 -> 3 path and then reverse the result.\n    *   Let's view the molecule looking down the H-C4 bond. The C3-group (#2) is to the right. The -OH group (#1) and the -CH3 group (#3) are both behind the plane.\n    *   The path from -OH (#1) to the C3-group (#2) to -CH3 (#3) is **clockwise**.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (-H) is pointing towards us, we reverse the result. Clockwise (R) becomes S.\n    *   Therefore, **C4 is (S)**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe absolute configuration of the molecule is determined by the configurations of its three chiral centers: C2, C3, and C4.\n*   C2 is (S)\n*   C3 is (S)\n*   C4 is (S)\n\nThe full stereochemical descriptor for the molecule is (2S, 3S, 4S).\n\n<<(2S, 3S, 4S)>>>"
