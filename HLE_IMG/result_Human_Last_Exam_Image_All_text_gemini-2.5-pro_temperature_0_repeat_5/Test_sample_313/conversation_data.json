    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\n*   The first clue states, \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows a man with a beard and dark hair, wearing a suit, receiving a trophy from an older man with white hair. The setting appears to be an awards ceremony.\n*   A search for major awards ceremonies on June 20, 2019, points to the **2019 NHL Awards** held in Las Vegas.\n*   By examining the winners of the 2019 NHL Awards and comparing their photos to the man in the image, we can identify him as **Robin Lehner**, a professional ice hockey goaltender. On that night, he won the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy.\n*   So, the person \"X Y\" pictured is related to the world of hockey.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   The second clue is, \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This clue points to a historical trade or process that involved mercury compounds and was discontinued because of health risks.\n*   The most famous example of this is the use of mercuric nitrate in the process of **carroting**, which was used to turn animal fur into felt for making hats.\n*   The workers in this trade were known as **hatters**. They often suffered from mercury poisoning, which caused neurological damage. This condition gave rise to the expression \"mad as a hatter.\"\n\n**Step 3: Connect the two clues to find \"X Y\".**\n*   We need to find a single term, \"X Y,\" that links the hockey player from the first clue to the historical trade from the second clue.\n*   The person in the picture is a hockey player. A well-known term in hockey is a **\"hat trick,\"** which is when a player scores three goals in a single game.\n*   The person who makes hats is a **\"hatter.\"**\n*   The riddle creates a link between a hockey player (associated with \"hat tricks\") and a \"hatter.\" For the purpose of this puzzle, the hockey player represents one type of \"Hatter.\"\n*   The historical tradesperson represents \"another hatter.\" This historical hatter's methods (using mercury salts) have ceased to be used.\n*   Therefore, the common term \"X Y\" that satisfies both clues is **Hatter**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The identification of the person (Robin Lehner) and the event (2019 NHL Awards) is crucial.\n*   The connection between a hockey player and a \"hatter\" is indirect (via the term \"hat trick\") and is a key part of the riddle's logic.\n*   The phrasing \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used\" is slightly awkward but refers to the trade of the hatter and its dangerous methods becoming obsolete.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe first \"X Y\" is a hockey player, who can be metaphorically called a \"Hatter\" due to the term \"hat trick.\" The \"another X Y\" is the traditional hatter, whose trade was transformed by the discontinued use of toxic mercury salts.\n\n<<<Hatter>>>"
