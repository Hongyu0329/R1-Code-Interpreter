    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the painting:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual content of the image fragment.**\nThe image shows a prominent windmill as the central subject. The sky is dark and turbulent, with dramatic clouds suggesting a storm has just passed or is ongoing. There is a patch of blue sky visible, creating a strong contrast. To the right, in the background, there appears to be a building on fire, with flames and smoke rising. The overall atmosphere is dramatic and intense. The brushwork and subject matter are characteristic of the Romanticism movement, which was prominent in the 19th century.\n\n**Step 2: Identify key features for searching.**\n*   **Subject:** Windmill, storm, fire.\n*   **Style:** Romantic, dramatic landscape.\n*   **Period:** 19th century (as specified in the question).\n\n**Step 3: Research paintings with these features.**\nA search for \"19th-century romantic painting windmill storm fire\" or similar terms leads to the work of the Russian painter Maxim Vorobiev (also spelled Maksim Vorobyov). His style perfectly matches the fragment.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific painting.**\nThe fragment is a detail from a larger painting by Maxim Vorobiev. The full painting reveals more of the scene, including a large oak tree in the foreground that has been split and shattered by a lightning strike. The fire in the background is a house that was also struck by lightning during the storm.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the title and date.**\nThe painting was created in 1842. Its most common title in English is **\"Oak Fractured by Lightning\"**. It is also known as \"The Shattered Oak\" or by its more descriptive title, \"Oak Fractured by Lightning. Windmill in the environs of Ochta in St. Petersburg\".\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe fragment is from the 1842 painting by the Russian artist Maxim Vorobiev. The title of the work is \"Oak Fractured by Lightning\".\n\n<<<Oak Fractured by Lightning>>>"
