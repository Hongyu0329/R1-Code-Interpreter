    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the musical content of the image.**\nThe image displays a \"piano roll\" visualization of the beginning of a piano piece. We can identify the notes by looking at which keys on the piano keyboard at the bottom correspond to the purple bars above.\n*   The first note played is a single note. It corresponds to the black key C-sharp (C♯).\n*   The next event is a two-note chord. The notes are G-sharp (G♯) and E.\n*   This pattern repeats: a single C♯ followed by the G♯-E chord.\n*   The notes C♯, E, and G♯ together form a C-sharp minor triad. The music consists of this chord being broken up (arpeggiated) between the hands.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the well-known piano piece.**\nThis specific opening pattern is extremely famous and is instantly recognizable as the beginning of Frédéric Chopin's **Fantaisie-Impromptu**. The key of this piece is C-sharp minor.\n\n**Step 3: Find the official opus number for Fantaisie-Impromptu.**\nThe Fantaisie-Impromptu was composed in 1834 but published after Chopin's death. Its standard catalog number is **Opus posthumous 66** (Op. posth. 66).\n\n**Step 4: Compare the correct opus number with the provided answer choices.**\nThe answer choices are:\nA. 18\nB. 16\nC. 3\nD. 23\nE. 39\n\nThe correct opus number, 66, is not listed among the options. This suggests there is a flaw in the question, where the image and the answer choices do not directly match.\n\n**Step 5: Find the most logical connection to resolve the discrepancy.**\nSince there is no direct match, we must look for a logical link between the piece shown in the image and one of the options. Let's identify the Chopin pieces associated with the given opus numbers and their keys:\n*   Op. 18: Grande valse brillante in E-flat major.\n*   Op. 16: Rondo in E-flat major.\n*   Op. 3: Introduction and Polonaise brillante in C major (for cello and piano).\n*   Op. 23: Ballade No. 1 in G minor.\n*   Op. 39: Scherzo No. 3 in **C-sharp minor**.\n\nThe key of the piece in the image (Fantaisie-Impromptu) is C-sharp minor. By examining the list of options, we find that only one piece, the Scherzo No. 3, Op. 39, shares the same key. Both the Fantaisie-Impromptu and the Scherzo No. 3 are very famous, virtuosic piano pieces by Chopin in C-sharp minor. It is highly probable that the question intends to link them through their shared key, despite using an image of the Fantaisie-Impromptu.\n\n**Step 6: Select the answer based on this logical connection.**\nBased on the shared key of C-sharp minor, the most plausible answer is the opus number for Chopin's Scherzo No. 3.\n\n**Final Answer:** The opus number associated with Chopin's Scherzo No. 3 is 39.\n\n<<<E>>>"
