    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the artist of the painting:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The goal is to find the full name of the artist who created the provided painting.\n\n2.  **Examine the Painting for Clues:** The most crucial clue in identifying an artist is often their signature on the artwork. I will carefully inspect the image, particularly the corners, for a signature.\n\n3.  **Locate the Signature:** Looking at the bottom right corner of the original image and the corresponding cropped image, a signature is clearly visible.\n\n4.  **Decipher the Signature:** The signature appears to be handwritten. The first name looks like \"Augusto\". The last name is \"Pinaud\". Following the name, there are the numbers \"'38\", which likely indicates the year the painting was created, 1938.\n\n5.  **Verify the Artist's Identity:** A search for an artist named \"Augusto Pinaud\" confirms that he was a Brazilian painter (1888-1951). His known works include landscapes painted in a similar watercolor style, and his signature matches the one seen in the painting.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the clear signature in the bottom right corner of the painting, the artist's full name is Augusto Pinaud.\n\n<<<Augusto Pinaud>>>"
