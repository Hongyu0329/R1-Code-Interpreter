**Product A:**
The structure is a tetracyclic compound. It consists of a pyrrolizidine core (two fused 5-membered rings) which is substituted on the bridgehead nitrogen with a 1-pyrroline ring. A cyclobutanone ring is fused to the pyrrolizidine core. A methoxycarbonyl group is attached to the pyrrolizidine core adjacent to the fusion with the cyclobutanone.
The molecular formula is C14H20N2O3.

**Product B:**
The structure is a tricyclic aromatic compound. It consists of a pyrrolizine core (two fused aromatic 5-membered rings) which is substituted on the nitrogen with a pyrrole ring. A methoxycarbonyl group and a hydroxyl group are attached to the pyrrolizine core.
The molecular formula is C12H14N2O3.

**Product C:**
The structure is the mixed anhydride of the starting material (1-(1-pyrrolin-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid) and acetic acid. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is converted to a mixed anhydride group (-CO-O-CO-CH3).
The molecular formula is C11H16N2O3.

A more explicit drawing: A pyrrolidine ring has a -CO-O-COCH3 group at position 2. The nitrogen at position 1 is bonded to the C2 position of a 1-pyrroline ring.

**Structure of A:**
A pyrrolizidine skeleton (fused 5,5-rings, N at bridgehead). The N is substituted with a 1-pyrroline ring. Fused to one of the 5-membered rings (at the former C=C bond from the cycloaddition) is a 4-membered cyclobutanone ring. A methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH3) group is attached to a carbon of the pyrrolizidine ring adjacent to the fusion point with the cyclobutanone.

**Structure of B:**
A pyrrolizine skeleton (fused aromatic 5,5-rings, N at bridgehead). The N is substituted with a pyrrole ring. A methoxycarbonyl (-COOCH3) group is attached to one of the carbons of the pyrrolizine skeleton. A hydroxyl (-OH) group is attached to another carbon of the pyrrolizine skeleton.
