    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens.\n\n**General Approach:**\nTo identify these rocks, we will examine their key physical properties visible in the images, primarily texture (the size, shape, and arrangement of the mineral grains or particles) and composition (inferred from the color of the rock and its constituent minerals).\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:**\n    *   **Texture:** The most prominent feature is its vesicular texture, meaning it is full of small, bubble-like cavities (vesicles). This indicates the rock formed from lava that cooled quickly, trapping dissolved gases. The rock is also aphanitic, meaning its individual mineral crystals are too small to be seen with the naked eye. This points to an extrusive (volcanic) origin.\n    *   **Color/Composition:** The rock has a reddish-brown color. This coloration is often due to the oxidation of iron-rich minerals, which is common in mafic to intermediate volcanic rocks.\n    *   **Identification:** A reddish, vesicular, extrusive igneous rock is known as **Scoria**. It is denser than pumice.\n\n2.  **Analyze Specimen J:**\n    *   **Texture:** Like specimen H, this rock is highly vesicular and aphanitic. However, its texture appears even more porous and frothy, with a very high volume of vesicles. This also points to a rapid cooling of gas-rich lava.\n    *   **Color/Composition:** The rock is very light in color (white to light gray). This suggests a felsic composition, rich in silica and poor in iron and magnesium.\n    *   **Identification:** A light-colored, extremely vesicular (frothy) volcanic rock is identified as **Pumice**. Due to its high porosity, pumice is very lightweight and can often float on water.\n\n3.  **Analyze Specimen I:**\n    *   **Texture:** This rock is composed of numerous smaller rock fragments, or clasts, that are cemented together in a finer-grained matrix. This is a clastic texture.\n    *   **Clast Shape:** The individual clasts are notably angular, not rounded.\n    *   **Identification:** A clastic rock made of angular fragments is called a **Breccia**. If the fragments were rounded, it would be a conglomerate. Breccias can form in various ways, including from volcanic explosions (volcanic breccia) or from the accumulation of rockfall debris (sedimentary breccia).\n\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:**\n    *   **Texture:** This rock displays a phaneritic (coarse-grained) texture. The individual mineral crystals are large enough to be easily seen with the naked eye and they interlock with each other. This texture indicates the rock cooled slowly deep beneath the Earth's surface, allowing large crystals to grow. This identifies it as an intrusive igneous rock.\n    *   **Color/Composition:** The rock is composed of a mixture of light-colored minerals (white, gray, and possibly pinkish feldspar and glassy quartz) and dark-colored minerals (like black biotite mica or hornblende).\n    *   **Identification:** A coarse-grained, intrusive igneous rock with a mix of light-colored felsic minerals (quartz and feldspar) and some dark mafic minerals is identified as **Granite**.\n\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria (vesicular, reddish-brown volcanic rock)\n*   **I:** Breccia (rock composed of angular fragments)\n*   **J:** Pumice (vesicular, light-colored volcanic rock)\n*   **K:** Granite (coarse-grained, crystalline intrusive igneous rock)\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Granite>>>"
