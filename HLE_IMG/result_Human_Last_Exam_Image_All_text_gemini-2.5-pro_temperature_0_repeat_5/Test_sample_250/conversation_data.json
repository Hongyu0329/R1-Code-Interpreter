    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the jazz standard.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Key Signature and Tonality**\n*   The key signature has four flats (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭). This indicates the key is either A♭ major or its relative minor, F minor.\n*   The first chord of the piece is F minor (notated as F-). The piece also resolves to an F chord at the end of major sections. This strongly suggests the piece is in the key of **F minor**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chord Progression**\nThe chord progression is one of the most distinctive features of a jazz standard. Let's break it down:\n*   **First 4 bars (A section):** `F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7`\n    *   This opening progression is highly unusual and memorable. The bass line moves chromatically downwards: F -> E -> E♭ -> D♭. This is a very strong clue.\n*   **Second 4 bars (A section):** `C7 | F- | 1. C7 :|| 2. C7`\n    *   This is a standard turnaround leading back to the F minor tonic. The C7 is the dominant (V7) chord of F minor.\n*   **Bridge (B section):** `D-7b5 | G7 | C7 | F7 | Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab | G C7`\n    *   This section consists of a series of ii-V progressions that modulate through different key centers before returning to the home key of F minor.\n        *   `D-7b5 - G7` is a ii-V leading to C.\n        *   `C7 - F7` is a V-I motion leading to B♭ (F7 is V of B♭).\n        *   `Bb-7 - Eb7 - Ab` is a classic ii-V-I progression in the key of A♭ major.\n        *   `G C7` sets up the return to F minor.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Melody**\nLet's look at the melodic contour of the first few bars:\n*   **Bar 1 (over F-):** The melody is C - A♭ - G - F. This is a descending line within the F minor scale.\n*   **Bar 2 (over E-7b5):** The melody is E♭ - D♭ - C - B♭. This continues the descending pattern.\n*   **Bar 3 (over Eb-6):** The melody is A♭ - G.\n*   **Bar 4 (over Dbmaj7 - G7):** The melody is F - B♮. The B natural over the G7 chord creates strong tension leading to the C7 chord.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Tune**\n*   The combination of the key (F minor), the unique chromatic descending bass line in the A section (`F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7`), and the modulating bridge is characteristic of a specific, well-known jazz standard.\n*   These features perfectly match **\"Nica's Dream\"**.\n*   The composer of \"Nica's Dream\" is the influential hard-bop pianist and composer **Horace Silver**. He first recorded it in 1956 with Art Blakey & the Jazz Messengers.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the detailed analysis of the key, chord progression, and melody, the piece of music is identified as the jazz standard \"Nica's Dream\" composed by Horace Silver.\n\n<<<Title: Nica's Dream, Composer: Horace Silver>>>"
