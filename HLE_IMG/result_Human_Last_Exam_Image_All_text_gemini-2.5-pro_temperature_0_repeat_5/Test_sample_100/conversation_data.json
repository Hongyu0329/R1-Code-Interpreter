    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and its molecular formula.**\nThe starting material is a bicyclic lactam. Let's break down its structure to determine its molecular formula.\n*   The core structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. This bicyclic system contains 6 carbon atoms, 1 nitrogen atom, and 1 oxygen atom.\n*   There is a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) attached to the double bond at position C6. This group adds 1 carbon and 3 fluorine atoms.\n*   The nitrogen atom is protected with a PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) group. The PMB group has the formula -CH2-C6H4-OCH3. This group consists of 8 carbon atoms, 9 hydrogen atoms, and 1 oxygen atom.\n*   Let's count the hydrogen atoms on the bicyclic core: C1(H), C4(H), C5(H), C7(H2). This gives a total of 5 hydrogen atoms.\n*   Now, let's sum up all the atoms to get the molecular formula of the starting material:\n    *   Carbons (C): 6 (core) + 1 (CF3) + 8 (PMB) = 15\n    *   Hydrogens (H): 5 (core) + 9 (PMB) = 14\n    *   Fluorines (F): 3 (CF3) = 3\n    *   Nitrogens (N): 1 (core) = 1\n    *   Oxygens (O): 1 (core carbonyl) + 1 (PMB ether) = 2\n*   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction to form Intermediate 1.**\n*   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Reaction:** CAN is a strong oxidizing agent commonly used for the deprotection of PMB groups from amines and alcohols. The PMB group is oxidatively cleaved, leaving a free amine (or in this case, an N-H bond in the lactam).\n*   **Change in molecular formula:** The PMB group (C8H9O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen.\n    *   Removal of PMB: -C8H9O\n    - Addition of H: +H\n    - Net change: -C8H8O\n*   **Molecular formula of Intermediate 1:**\n    *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   H: 14 - 8 = 6\n    *   F: 3 (no change)\n    *   N: 1 (no change)\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n*   The molecular formula of Intermediate 1 is **C7H6F3NO**. Intermediate 1 is 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction to form Intermediate 2.**\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 in MeOH.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. The palladium on carbon catalyst with hydrogen gas reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) to a single bond (C-C).\n*   **Change in molecular formula:** One molecule of hydrogen (H2) is added across the double bond.\n    *   Net change: +H2\n*   **Molecular formula of Intermediate 2:**\n    *   Starting from Intermediate 1 (C7H6F3NO):\n    *   C: 7 (no change)\n    *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n    *   F: 3 (no change)\n    *   N: 1 (no change)\n    *   O: 1 (no change)\n*   The molecular formula of Intermediate 2 is **C7H8F3NO**. Intermediate 2 is the saturated lactam, 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third reaction to form the final Product.**\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n*   **Reaction:** These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide. Since the starting material is a lactam (a cyclic amide), the reaction will open the ring. The amide bond (C-N) is cleaved.\n*   **Change in molecular formula:** Hydrolysis involves the addition of one molecule of water (H2O). The carbonyl group becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the nitrogen atom becomes an amino group (-NH2), which will be protonated to an ammonium group (-NH3+) under the acidic conditions. The molecular formula, however, represents the neutral molecule.\n    *   Net change: +H2O\n*   **Molecular formula of the final Product:**\n    *   Starting from Intermediate 2 (C7H8F3NO):\n    *   C: 7 (no change)\n    *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   F: 3 (no change)\n    *   N: 1 (no change)\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n*   The molecular formula of the final product is **C7H10F3NO2**. The product is a substituted aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n1.  Correctly identify the structure and count the atoms of the starting material, paying close attention to the PMB group.\n2.  Recognize that CAN is used for PMB deprotection, which involves removing C8H9O and adding H.\n3.  Understand that Pd/C, H2 performs hydrogenation, reducing the C=C bond and adding H2.\n4.  Identify the final step as an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of a lactam, which is a net addition of a water molecule (H2O) to the molecular formula.\n5.  Carefully track the changes in the number of each type of atom through the three-step sequence.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nStarting Material: C15H14F3NO2\nStep 1 (-C8H8O) -> Intermediate 1: C7H6F3NO\nStep 2 (+H2) -> Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO\nStep 3 (+H2O) -> Product: C7H10F3NO2\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
