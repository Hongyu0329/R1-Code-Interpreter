    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Specimen H**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a very porous, bubbly appearance. The holes, known as vesicles, are numerous and give the rock a spongy or frothy texture.\n*   **Interpretation:** The vesicular texture is a key indicator of a volcanic (extrusive igneous) rock. These holes are formed by gas bubbles that were trapped in the lava as it cooled rapidly on the Earth's surface. The reddish color is often due to the oxidation of iron-rich minerals.\n*   **Careful Point:** It is important to distinguish this from pumice (Specimen J). While both are vesicular, scoria is typically denser and darker in color (red, brown, or black) due to its more mafic (iron and magnesium-rich) composition.\n*   **Identification:** This specimen is **Scoria**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Specimen I**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is composed of various fragments cemented together. We can see smaller, angular pieces (clasts) of different colors (grey, white, a notable reddish piece) embedded in a finer-grained, light-colored matrix. The texture is clastic.\n*   **Interpretation:** This texture indicates that the rock is formed from the accumulation and lithification (cementing) of pre-existing rock fragments. The presence of what appear to be volcanic rock fragments in a fine-grained matrix (likely volcanic ash) points to a pyroclastic origin. This means it was formed from material violently ejected during a volcanic eruption.\n*   **Careful Point:** This is not an intrusive igneous rock like granite (K) because it's made of fragments, not interlocking crystals. It could be confused with a sedimentary breccia, but the nature of the clasts and fine matrix strongly suggest a volcanic source.\n*   **Identification:** This specimen is a pyroclastic rock, most accurately identified as **Tuff** or **Volcanic Breccia**. Tuff is composed primarily of consolidated volcanic ash, often with larger fragments mixed in.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Specimen J**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is very light in color (white to light grey) and, like specimen H, is highly vesicular. It appears to be low in density.\n*   **Interpretation:** The light color and vesicular texture indicate it is a felsic (silica-rich) volcanic rock. The lava that formed it was frothy with gas and cooled very quickly, trapping the bubbles.\n*   **Careful Point:** This is the classic appearance of pumice. It is distinguished from scoria (H) by its light color and typically lower density (pumice can often float on water).\n*   **Identification:** This specimen is **Pumice**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Specimen K**\n*   **Observation:** This rock is composed of large, visible, interlocking crystals of different colorsâ€”primarily light-colored (white, pinkish, translucent grey) with some dark minerals mixed in. The texture is coarse-grained (phaneritic).\n*   **Interpretation:** The coarse-grained, crystalline texture indicates that the rock cooled slowly from magma deep beneath the Earth's surface, allowing large crystals to grow. This identifies it as an intrusive (or plutonic) igneous rock. The light color suggests a felsic composition, rich in silica. The visible minerals are likely quartz (grey), feldspar (white/pink), and a dark mineral like biotite or hornblende.\n*   **Careful Point:** This texture is fundamentally different from the clastic texture of specimen I and the vesicular textures of H and J. The interlocking crystals grew together from a molten state, they were not cemented together later.\n*   **Identification:** This specimen is **Granite**.\n\n---\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria (a vesicular, mafic-to-intermediate extrusive igneous rock)\n*   **I:** Tuff (a pyroclastic rock formed from volcanic ash and fragments)\n*   **J:** Pumice (a vesicular, felsic extrusive igneous rock)\n*   **K:** Granite (a coarse-grained, felsic intrusive igneous rock)\n\n<<<\nH: Scoria\nI: Tuff (or Volcanic Breccia)\nJ: Pumice\nK: Granite\n>>>"
