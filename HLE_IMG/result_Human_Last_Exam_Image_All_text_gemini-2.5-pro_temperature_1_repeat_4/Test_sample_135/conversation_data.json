    "*   **Step 1: Initial Analysis of the Image**\n    The image displays a bas-relief sculpture set within a circular frame, known as a tondo. The subject is a religious scene: a priest, standing by an altar with a candle, is administering communion to several kneeling figures, including a young child in the foreground. The style is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance of the 15th century, notable for its graceful figures, balanced composition, and delicate carving. The entire tondo is set within a larger, ornately carved rectangular panel.\n\n*   **Step 2: Examination of the Inscription**\n    A crucial clue is the inscription on the cartouche at the bottom of the tondo. The text reads \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This appears to be a mix of languages. \"Sacramenti\" is Italian for \"sacraments\" (or Latin \"sacramenti\"). \"De l'autel\" is French for \"of the altar\". This linguistic blend suggests a connection between Italy and France, perhaps an Italian artist working in France or for a French patron. The inscription confirms the subject matter as the Sacrament of the Altar, i.e., the Eucharist.\n\n*   **Step 3: Stylistic Analysis and Artist Attribution**\n    The delicate and subtle quality of the relief carving, known as *rilievo schiacciato* (squashed relief), is strongly reminiscent of Florentine masters like Donatello and particularly his followers, such as Desiderio da Settignano. However, the French element in the inscription points towards an artist who worked in both regions or had connections to both cultures.\n\n*   **Step 4: Research and Identification**\n    Based on the style and the Italo-French inscription, research points to the work of Francesco Laurana (c. 1430 â€“ c. 1502). Laurana was a sculptor of Dalmatian origin who was active in both Italy (especially Naples) and southern France (Provence). This background perfectly explains the mix of Italian artistic style and French linguistic elements.\n    Further investigation confirms that this tondo is a detail from the predella (the base) of a large marble altarpiece known as the **Altarpiece of the Carrying of the Cross** (or *Retable du Portement de Croix*). This altarpiece was commissioned around 1477-1481 for the chapel of Saint-Jean-Baptiste in the Church of Saint-Pierre in Avignon, France. The predella of this altarpiece features four tondos depicting sacraments, and the one shown in the image represents the Eucharist.\n\n*   **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n    The artwork is a detail from the predella of the Altarpiece of the Carrying of the Cross in Avignon. The author of this work is the sculptor Francesco Laurana.\n\n<<<Francesco Laurana>>>"
