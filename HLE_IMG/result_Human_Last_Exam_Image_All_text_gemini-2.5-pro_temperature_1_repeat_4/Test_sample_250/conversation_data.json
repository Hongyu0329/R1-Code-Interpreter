    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the jazz standard:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Key and Meter:**\n    *   The key signature has four flats (Bb, Eb, Ab, Db), which indicates the key of F minor or Ab major.\n    *   The first chord is F minor (F-), and the piece resolves to F major/minor chords, strongly suggesting the key is F minor.\n    *   The time signature appears to be 4/4, which is standard for most jazz tunes.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Chord Progression:**\n    *   The first four bars feature a very distinctive chromatic descent in the bass line, implied by the chord roots: F -> E -> Eb -> Db.\n    *   The specific chords are: F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7 |.\n    *   This progression, particularly the F minor chord followed by a descending series of chords, is a well-known harmonic sequence in jazz.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Melody:**\n    *   The melody begins with pickup notes (Ab, Bb) leading to the first full measure.\n    *   The first measure consists of four quarter notes on the note C.\n    *   The melody then descends chromatically along with the harmony: C over F-, C and Bb over E-7b5, Ab and G over Eb-6, and so on.\n    *   The combination of the repeated-note opening on the fifth degree of the scale (C in the key of F minor) followed by a chromatic descent is a very strong melodic identifier.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Tune:**\n    *   The combination of the F minor key, the characteristic descending chord progression (F-, E-7b5, Eb-6...), and the specific opening melody (four repeated C's) are all hallmark features of the jazz standard **\"Nica's Dream\"**.\n\n5.  **Identify the Composer:**\n    *   \"Nica's Dream\" was composed by the influential jazz pianist and composer **Horace Silver**. It was first recorded on his 1956 album *Horace Silver and the Jazz Messengers*.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe musical evidence points conclusively to the title \"Nica's Dream\" and the composer Horace Silver.\n\n<<<Title: Nica's Dream, Composer: Horace Silver>>>"
