    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Goal:** Calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) when shifting from the Baseline (Table 1) mode share to the Proposed (Table 2) mode share.\n\n**Formula for Percentage Reduction:**\nPercentage Reduction = ( (Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT ) * 100\n\n**Methodology:**\nTo find the total VMT for each scenario, we need to calculate a weighted VMT for each distance category and then sum them up. The VMT for each category is determined by three factors:\n1.  The proportion of all trips that fall into that distance category (e.g., 48% of trips are 0-3 miles long).\n2.  The proportion of trips within that category taken by car (mode share).\n3.  The average distance of a trip in that category.\n\n**Car VMT Calculation:**\nThe VMT for cars is the sum of VMT for \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\". We will calculate a \"VMT Index\" for both scenarios, which represents the average miles traveled by car per total trip in the system.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Baseline Car VMT Index (from Table 1)**\n\n*   **0-3 miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 25% + 28% = 53%\n    *   VMT Index = (Share of total trips) × (Total car mode share) × (Avg. trip distance)\n    *   VMT Index = 0.48 × 0.53 × 1 = **0.2544**\n*   **3-5 miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   VMT Index = 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = **0.7128**\n*   **5-10 miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   VMT Index = 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = **0.8925**\n*   **10+ miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   VMT Index = 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = **2.8480**\n\n*   **Total Baseline Car VMT Index:**\n    *   0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Proposed Car VMT Index (from Table 2)**\n\n*   **0-3 miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   VMT Index = 0.48 × 0.03 × 1 = **0.0144**\n*   **3-5 miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   VMT Index = 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = **0.2376**\n*   **5-10 miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   VMT Index = 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = **0.4305**\n*   **10+ miles category:**\n    *   Total car mode share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   VMT Index = 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = **1.5680**\n\n*   **Total Proposed Car VMT Index:**\n    *   0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction in Car VMT**\n\n*   **Baseline VMT Index:** 4.7077\n*   **Proposed VMT Index:** 2.2505\n*   **VMT Reduction:** 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction:** (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100 ≈ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The calculation is for Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT), not Person Miles Traveled (PMT). Therefore, the average carpool occupancy figures are not used.\n*   Car VMT requires summing the shares of both single-occupant and multi-occupant car trips.\n*   Each distance category's VMT must be weighted by its share of total trips.\n*   The final reduction must be calculated relative to the initial (Baseline) VMT.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
