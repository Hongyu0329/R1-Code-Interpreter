    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The question asks to identify which of the peripheral phenyl rings, labeled G, H, J, K, and L, can rotate freely in solution.\n\n2.  **Underlying Principle:** The ability of a phenyl ring to rotate freely around the single bond connecting it to another ring depends on the steric hindrance it experiences. This hindrance is primarily caused by bulky groups (substituents) located at the *ortho* positions on the adjacent ring (i.e., the carbon atoms next to the point of attachment).\n    *   **Free Rotation:** Generally occurs when there are no bulky substituents at either ortho position (e.g., both are hydrogen atoms) or sometimes when only one ortho position is substituted with a moderately bulky group. The energy barrier to rotation is low.\n    *   **Restricted Rotation:** Occurs when there are bulky substituents at both ortho positions. This creates a high energy barrier, preventing free rotation at normal temperatures.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Molecular Structure:** The molecule is an Iridium (Ir) complex with three ligands.\n    *   One bipyridine ligand (rings E and F).\n    *   Two cyclometalated phenylpyridine-type ligands (A-B and C-D).\n    *   The peripheral phenyl rings G, H, J, K, L are substituents on the phenyl parts (A and C) of the cyclometalated ligands.\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Phenyl Ring's Environment:**\n\n    *   **Ring J:** It is attached to carbon C4 of ring C. To determine if it can rotate, we must look at the substituents on the carbons ortho to C4, which are C3 and C5 of ring C.\n        *   At C3, there is the pyridine ring D. This is a bulky group.\n        *   At C5, there is the phenyl ring L. This is also a bulky group.\n        *   Since ring J has two bulky substituents at its ortho positions on ring C, its rotation is **restricted**.\n\n    *   **Ring L:** It is attached to carbon C5 of ring C. The ortho positions on ring C are C4 and C6.\n        *   At C4, there is the phenyl ring J. This is a bulky group.\n        *   At C6, ring C is bonded to the Iridium (Ir) atom. The metal center with its other ligands is an extremely bulky group.\n        *   Since ring L has two very bulky substituents at its ortho positions, its rotation is **restricted**.\n\n    *   **Ring G:** It is attached to carbon C2 of ring C. The ortho positions on ring C are C1 and C3.\n        *   The diagram does not show a substituent at C1, so we assume it is a hydrogen atom, which is not bulky.\n        *   At C3, there is the pyridine ring D, which is a bulky group.\n        *   Ring G has only one bulky ortho substituent. In this case, the rotational barrier is significantly lower than for di-ortho substituted rings. Therefore, rotation is considered **free**.\n\n    *   **Ring H:** It is attached to carbon C4 of ring A. The ortho positions on ring A are C3 and C5.\n        *   At C3, there is the pyridine ring B, which is a bulky group.\n        *   The diagram does not show a substituent at C5, so we assume it is a hydrogen atom, which is not bulky.\n        *   Similar to ring G, ring H has only one bulky ortho substituent. Therefore, its rotation is also considered **free**.\n\n    *   **Ring K:** The drawing for ring K and its attachment to ring A is ambiguous. The line points to C6 of ring A, but this position is also where the cyclometalating bond to Ir is expected (by analogy to the C-D ligand and the dotted line's position). In any chemically plausible structure, ring K would be adjacent to a very bulky group (either the Ir atom itself or the bulky pyridine ring B), or the entire face of ring A would be blocked by Ir if it's an η⁶-arene ligand. Thus, the rotation of ring K is expected to be **restricted**.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Rings J and L are di-ortho substituted and their rotation is restricted.\n    *   Ring K is also in a very crowded environment and its rotation is restricted.\n    *   Rings G and H are mono-ortho substituted. They have a much lower barrier to rotation compared to J, L, and K, and are thus considered to rotate freely.\n\n6.  **Match with Answer Choices:** The rings that can rotate freely are G and H. This corresponds to answer choice J.\n\nFinal Answer is J. G, H\n\n<<<J>>>"
