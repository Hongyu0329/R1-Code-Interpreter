    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to determine its title, musical style, and country of origin.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Musical Elements**\n\n*   **Key and Time Signature:** The sheet music is in the key of C major (or A minor), as indicated by the lack of sharps or flats in the key signature. The final chord in the Coda is a C major chord, confirming the key is C major. The time signature is 4/4, common in jazz and popular music.\n*   **Tempo:** The tempo is marked \"Mod. ‚ô©=120\", which means Moderato at 120 beats per minute. This is a medium-to-up-tempo pace, often used for swing and dance music.\n*   **Melody and Rhythm:** The melody is highly syncopated, featuring many eighth notes, rests on strong beats, and off-beat accents. There are also chromatic notes (e.g., G# in the third measure over the E7 chord, F# in the F# diminished chord) that add a specific color and complexity. This rhythmic and melodic style is characteristic of jazz.\n*   **Harmony (Chords):** The chord progression is sophisticated and typical of jazz. It includes:\n    *   Standard chords: C, F, G7\n    *   Secondary dominants: E7 (acting as the V7 of A minor, though it resolves to F here, a common jazz substitution).\n    *   Minor chords: C-, D-, A-\n    *   Diminished chords: F#dim (often used as a passing chord).\n    The presence of progressions like D- to G7 to C (a ii-V-I, the most fundamental jazz cadence) strongly points to a jazz style.\n*   **Structure:** The piece uses standard musical notation for structure, including a D.S. al Coda (\"To Go Out - Take D.S. to Coda\"), indicating a repeat from the segno sign (ùÑã) to the Coda sign (‚äï), then jumping to the Coda section to finish. This is a common song form structure.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Musical Style**\n\nBased on the analysis above, the musical style is clearly **Jazz**. The specific combination of a swinging rhythm, acoustic-feeling melody, and chord choices (especially the frequent use of dominant 7th and diminished chords) is highly reminiscent of **Gypsy Jazz** (also known as Jazz Manouche or French Swing), a style popularized by guitarist Django Reinhardt in France in the 1930s and 40s.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Song Title**\n\nBy transcribing or \"sight-singing\" the first few bars of the melody, the tune can be identified:\n*   Pickup notes: G-A-B\n*   Measure 1 (on C chord): C-G-C-E\n*   Measure 3 (on E7 chord): G#-A-G#-F#\nThis distinctive, catchy, and somewhat quirky melody is the main theme of the song **\"Belleville Rendez-vous\"**. This song is the title theme for the 2003 animated film *Les Triplettes de Belleville* (The Triplets of Belleville).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Country of Origin**\n\n*   The film *Les Triplettes de Belleville* is a critically acclaimed animated feature.\n*   It was a co-production between companies in several countries, but it is predominantly a **French** production, directed by French animator Sylvain Chomet.\n*   The musical style itself, Gypsy Jazz, has its origins in **France**.\n*   The composer, Beno√Æt Charest, is French-Canadian, further strengthening the connection to the Francophone world.\nTherefore, the country of origin for the song is **France**.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n*   **Title:** \"Belleville Rendez-vous\" (from the film *Les Triplettes de Belleville*)\n*   **Musical Style:** Gypsy Jazz / French Swing\n*   **Country of Origin:** France\n\n<<<**Title:** \"Belleville Rendez-vous\" (from the film *Les Triplettes de Belleville*)\n**Musical Style:** Gypsy Jazz (or French Swing)\n**Country of Origin:** France>>>"
