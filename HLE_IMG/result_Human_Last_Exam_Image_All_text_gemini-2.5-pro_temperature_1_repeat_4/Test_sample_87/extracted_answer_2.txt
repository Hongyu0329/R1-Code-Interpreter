**Product A:** The structure is a pyrrolizidine derivative formed by the [3+2] cycloaddition of the azomethine ylide (from the starting material) with methyl propiolate, followed by C-acylation with acetic anhydride. Its molecular formula is C14H20N2O3.

A possible IUPAC name is methyl 1-acetyl-4-(4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-pyrrolizine-2-carboxylate, with the double bond rearranged upon acylation. A drawing is clearer: A pyrrolizidine skeleton where the N is substituted with a 1-pyrrolin-2-yl group. In the other 5-membered ring, there is a methoxycarbonyl group, an acetyl group, and a C=C double bond.
 

**Product B:** The structure is an oxidized version of the primary cycloaddition product. It results from the oxidation of the N-substituent to a lactam and dehydrogenation of the pyrrolizidine core. Its molecular formula is C12H14N2O3.

The structure features a pyrrolizidine core containing two double bonds (a diene system). The nitrogen atom is substituted with a 5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrol-2-yl group (a lactam). A methoxycarbonyl group is also attached to the pyrrolizidine ring system.
 

**Product C:** The structure is the mixed anhydride formed from the reaction of the carboxylic acid group of the starting material with acetic anhydride. Its molecular formula is C11H16N2O3.

The structure is the same as the starting material, but the hydroxyl group (-OH) of the carboxylic acid is replaced by an acetoxy group from the anhydride, forming a -CO-O-CO-CH3 group.
