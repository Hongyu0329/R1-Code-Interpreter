The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **V domain** of the RAGE receptor.

This protein can be used as a **prognostic marker**. The rationale is that S100B is not merely correlated with the disease state but is an upstream activator of pathways that directly cause the key pathological features of neurodegeneration. As shown in the diagram, S100B binding to RAGE initiates cascades leading to apoptosis (via JNK/JUN) and, critically, to neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration (via NFÎºB). Therefore, the level of S100B can predict the severity and rate of disease progression, which is the definition of a prognostic marker. It provides more than just supplementary information; it informs on the likely future outcome of the pathology.
