The products A and B are the two regioisomers formed from the 1,2-addition of the tert-butoxy group and the benzoyloxy group across the double bond of styrene.

**Compound A:** 2-(tert-butoxy)-1-phenylethyl benzoate
**Compound B:** 2-(benzoyloxy)-1-phenylethyl tert-butyl ether (or tert-butyl 2-(benzoyloxy)-1-phenylethyl ether)

The structures are:

**A:**
```
      O-C(=O)Ph
      |
Ph - CH - CH₂ - O-C(CH₃)₃
```

**B:**
```
      O-C(CH₃)₃
      |
Ph - CH - CH₂ - O-C(=O)Ph
```
Here are the structures drawn out:
