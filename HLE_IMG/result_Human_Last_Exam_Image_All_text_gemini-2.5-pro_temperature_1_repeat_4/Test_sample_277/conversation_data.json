    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the provided image:** The image is completely black. There are no chemical structures, diagrams, or any molecules shown in the image.\n2.  **Analyze the question:** The question asks to determine the isomeric relationship between \"the molecules mentioned above\". The term \"above\" refers to the image.\n3.  **Identify the problem:** Since the image is blank, there are no molecules presented for comparison. To determine if molecules are isomers (conformational, constitutional, stereoisomers) or identical, one must be able to see and compare their structures.\n4.  **Review the definitions of the options:**\n    *   **(a) Conformers isomers:** These are different spatial arrangements of the same molecule that can be interconverted by rotation around single bonds. We would need to see at least two structures to compare.\n    *   **(b) Constitutional isomers:** These molecules have the same molecular formula but different connectivity (different bonding sequences). We would need to see at least two structures to compare their formulas and connectivity.\n    *   **(c) Identical:** The structures are the same molecule, possibly shown in different orientations. We would need to see at least two structures to compare.\n    *   **(d) Stereoisomers:** These molecules have the same molecular formula and connectivity but differ in the 3D arrangement of atoms in space. We would need to see at least two structures to compare.\n5.  **Evaluate the situation:** Without any molecules to analyze, it is impossible to determine their molecular formulas, connectivity, or spatial arrangements. Therefore, we cannot classify their relationship as conformers, constitutional isomers, identical, or stereoisomers.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Because the necessary information (the molecules) is missing, none of the specific relationships described in options (a), (b), (c), or (d) can be confirmed. The question is unanswerable with the given information. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is (e).\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{E}$.\n\n<<<E>>>"
