    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Musical Analysis**\n*   **Instrumentation:** The music is written on a grand staff (treble and bass clefs connected by a brace), which is standard for piano music.\n*   **Tempo and Meter:** The tempo is marked as quarter note = 80 (♩ = 80), a moderate Andante tempo. The time signature is 4/4 (common time).\n*   **Key Signature:** There is one sharp (F#) in the key signature, indicating the key of G major or its relative, E minor. The piece begins and ends its first phrase on G major chords, confirming the key is likely G major.\n*   **Dynamics and Articulation:** The piece starts softly (*p*, piano) and then has a sudden dramatic shift to loud (*f*, forte) in measure 3. There are further dynamic changes to *mp* (mezzo-piano) and *mf* (mezzo-forte), indicating a piece with a wide expressive range.\n\n**Step 2: Melodic and Harmonic Analysis**\n*   **Measures 1-2:** The piece opens with a simple, lyrical melody in the right hand: G-B-A-G-D, followed by C-B-A-G. This melody is very distinct and memorable. The left hand provides a simple chordal accompaniment.\n*   **Measure 3:** The character changes completely. Both hands play loud, fast-moving sixteenth notes. The right hand plays descending arpeggios, while the left hand plays ascending broken octaves. This creates a powerful, heroic, and virtuosic sound.\n*   **Measures 4-6:** The texture shifts again to a chordal progression. The left hand plays blocked chords while the right hand plays melody notes harmonized in four parts. The harmony becomes more chromatic, moving through a sequence of seventh chords (B7, C#7, etc.), building tension.\n*   **Measures 8-10:** This section features thick, powerful chords in a steady eighth-note rhythm, creating a march-like, resolute character.\n*   **Measure 11:** An impressive, fast upward-sweeping arpeggio (marked with a squiggly line, indicating an arpeggiated chord or glissando) leads into another virtuosic section.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the Piece**\n*   The opening melody (G-B-A-G...) is the most recognizable element. This theme is widely known as the \"Main Theme\" from the popular video game series *Final Fantasy*, composed by Nobuo Uematsu.\n*   The arrangement style, with its dramatic shifts from a simple theme to complex, virtuosic piano writing, is characteristic of the official *Piano Collections Final Fantasy* albums. These albums feature sophisticated and technically demanding arrangements of the games' music.\n*   Specifically, this arrangement, with its particular sequence of textures—lyrical opening, forte arpeggiated passage, chromatic chordal section, and march-like part—is identifiable as the arrangement of the \"Main Theme of Final Fantasy IV\" from the album *Piano Collections Final Fantasy IV*.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the iconic opening melody and the virtuosic arrangement style, the piece is the \"Main Theme of Final Fantasy IV\".\n\n<<<Main Theme of Final Fantasy IV>>>"
