    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual clue.**\nThe image provided shows two men at what appears to be an awards ceremony. A man with white hair is presenting a trophy to a younger man with a beard. The event is dated June 20, 2019. A search for major awards ceremonies around this date reveals that the 2019 NHL Awards were held on June 19, 2019. By comparing the man receiving the award to photos of the winners from that event, he can be identified as Robin Lehner, a professional ice hockey goaltender. On that night, Lehner won the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to hockey.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the textual clue.**\nThe second part of the question states: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This suggests that \"X Y\" is a term with a dual meaning. One meaning is related to the person in the photo (Robin Lehner), and the other is related to a historical process or profession involving toxic mercury salts that is now obsolete.\n\n**Step 3: Connect the two clues.**\nWe need to find a term (\"X Y\") that links Robin Lehner to something involving mercury salts. Let's consider the historical uses of mercury salts. One of the most famous examples is in the manufacturing of felt hats. A process called \"carroting\" used mercury(II) nitrate to treat animal fur. The workers, known as \"hatters,\" were frequently exposed to mercury vapor, which led to severe neurological damage, a condition known as \"mad hatter disease.\" This is widely believed to be the origin of the phrase \"mad as a hatter.\" The use of mercury in hat-making has long been discontinued due to its toxicity.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the final answer.**\nNow we link this back to Robin Lehner. Lehner is famous in the hockey world for the custom artwork on his goalie masks. During the 2018-2019 season (the season for which he won the award pictured), he famously wore a mask featuring the \"Mad Hatter\" from *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*. He has openly embraced this persona.\n\nTherefore, the term \"X Y\" is \"Mad Hatter\".\n*   One \"Mad Hatter\" is the persona of Robin Lehner, pictured at the 2019 NHL awards.\n*   \"Another\" hatter (the profession) has almost ceased to exist in its historical form because of the toxic mercury salts used in the process.\n\n<<<Mad Hatter>>>"
