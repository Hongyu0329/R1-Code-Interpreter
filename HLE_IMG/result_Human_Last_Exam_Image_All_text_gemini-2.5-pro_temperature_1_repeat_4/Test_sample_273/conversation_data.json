    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral centers and number the main carbon chain.**\nFirst, we need to identify the longest carbon chain that contains the principal functional group. According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the alcohol group (-OH) has higher priority than the amine group (-NH2). Therefore, the molecule should be named as an alcohol.\n\nThe longest carbon chain containing the carbon with the -OH group is a pentane chain. We number the chain to give the -OH group the lowest possible number.\nNumbering from the left:\nC1: CH3\nC2: The carbon with the -OH group.\nC3: The carbon with the ethyl group.\nC4: The carbon with the methyl group adjacent to the CH2NH2 group.\nC5: The carbon in the -CH2NH2 group.\n\nSo, the IUPAC name is **5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol**.\n\nThe chiral centers are the carbon atoms bonded to four different groups. In this molecule, C2, C3, and C4 are chiral centers.\n*   **C2:** Bonded to -OH, -H, -CH3 (C1), and the rest of the chain (C3-group).\n*   **C3:** Bonded to an ethyl group, -H, the C2-group, and the C4-group.\n*   **C4:** Bonded to a methyl group, -H, the C3-group, and the -CH2NH2 group (C5).\n\nWe need to determine the configuration (R or S) for each of these three centers.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the 3D representation.**\nThe molecule is drawn in a common style for acyclic chains where the main backbone is represented by plain lines, and substituents are shown with wedges (coming out of the page) and dashes (going into the page). A consistent way to interpret this at each chiral center is to assume the two C-C bonds of the backbone and the C-H bond are in a single plane (this is a local simplification for analysis), with the other two substituents pointing up (wedge) and down (dash). Alternatively, and more accurately for a tetrahedral carbon, we can assume that at each center, the C-H bond and an adjacent C-C bond lie in the plane of the page, while the other two groups are wedged and dashed.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the configuration of each chiral center.**\n\n**Analysis of C2:**\n*   **Groups attached:** -OH, -H (implicit), -CH3 (C1), and the C3-group.\n*   **Drawing:** The -OH group is wedged. The -CH3 group (C1) is dashed. The C2-C3 bond is a plain line. We assume the implicit -H is also on a plain line, opposite to the C2-C3 bond.\n*   **Priorities (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog):**\n    1.  -OH (highest atomic number)\n    2.  -CH(Et)(C4...) (the C3-group)\n    3.  -CH3 (C1)\n    4.  -H (lowest priority)\n*   **Assigning configuration:** The lowest priority group (-H) is in the plane of the page. We can use the swap method. Swap the -H (4) with the group pointing away, which is -CH3 (3).\n    *   The new arrangement has -H (4) in the back (dashed). The other groups are -OH (1, wedged), C3-group (2, in the plane, right), and -CH3 (3, in the plane, left).\n    *   Now, trace the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3: -OH -> C3-group -> -CH3. This is an \"up\" -> \"right\" -> \"left\" movement, which is a **clockwise (CW)** rotation.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group is in the back, a CW path means the configuration of the *swapped* molecule is **R**.\n    *   Because we performed one swap, the original configuration is the opposite. Therefore, **C2 is S**.\n\n**Analysis of C3:**\n*   **Groups attached:** Ethyl (-CH2CH3), -H (implicit), C2-group, and C4-group.\n*   **Drawing:** The ethyl group is wedged. The C3-C2 and C3-C4 bonds are plain lines. We assume the implicit -H is dashed (pointing away).\n*   **Priorities:**\n    1.  -CH(OH)CH3 (the C2-group, because O > C)\n    2.  -CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (the C4-group)\n    3.  -CH2CH3 (ethyl group)\n    4.  -H\n*   **Assigning configuration:** The lowest priority group (-H, 4) is pointing away (dashed). This is the standard orientation.\n    *   Trace the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3: C2-group -> C4-group -> Ethyl group. This is a \"left\" -> \"right\" -> \"up/forward\" movement.\n    *   This path is **counter-clockwise (CCW)**.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group is in the back, a CCW path means the configuration is **S**. Therefore, **C3 is S**.\n\n**Analysis of C4:**\n*   **Groups attached:** -CH3, -H (implicit), C3-group, and -CH2NH2 (C5).\n*   **Drawing:** The bond to the -CH2NH2 group (C4-C5 bond) is wedged. The -CH3 group is dashed. The C4-C3 bond is a plain line. We assume the implicit -H is also on a plain line.\n*   **Priorities:**\n    1.  -CH2NH2 (because N > C)\n    2.  -CH(Et)(C2...) (the C3-group)\n    3.  -CH3\n    4.  -H\n*   **Assigning configuration:** The lowest priority group (-H, 4) is in the plane. We use the swap method. Swap -H (4) with the group pointing away, which is -CH3 (3).\n    *   The new arrangement has -H (4) in the back (dashed). The other groups are -CH2NH2 (1, wedged), C3-group (2, in the plane, left), and -CH3 (3, in the plane, right).\n    *   Trace the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3: -CH2NH2 -> C3-group -> -CH3. This is an \"up/forward\" -> \"left\" -> \"right\" movement. This is a **clockwise (CW)** rotation.\n    *   Since the lowest priority group is in the back, the configuration of the *swapped* molecule is **R**.\n    *   The original configuration is the opposite. Therefore, **C4 is S**.\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer.**\nThe absolute configurations for the chiral centers are S at C2, S at C3, and S at C4.\nThe full stereochemical descriptor for the molecule is (2S, 3S, 4S).\n\n<<(2S, 3S, 4S)>>"
