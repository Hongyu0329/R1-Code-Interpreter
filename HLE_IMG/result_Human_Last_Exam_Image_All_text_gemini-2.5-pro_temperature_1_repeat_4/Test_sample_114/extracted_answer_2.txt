The high regioselectivity observed in Reaction 3 is due to the rigid, asymmetric structure of the bicyclic münchnone intermediate formed from N-acetylproline. In this intermediate, the C2 and C4 positions of the 1,3-dipole are sterically and electronically distinct (a methyl group at C2 vs. a constrained bridgehead carbon at C4). This pronounced asymmetry dictates a single, favored orientation for the cycloaddition with methyl propiolate.

The results from Reactions 1 and 2 are critical to this rationale. They demonstrate that while the cycloaddition step itself is inherently regioselective (as shown by the single product in Reaction 1), this selectivity can be masked. For the acyclic starting material in Reactions 1 and 2, the resulting münchnone has identical methyl groups at C2 and C4. The labeling experiment in Reaction 2 reveals that these positions are scrambled via a rapid pre-equilibrium before the cycloaddition occurs. This scrambling is prevented in Reaction 3 because the C2 and C4 substituents are chemically different and locked into a bicyclic frame. Thus, Reaction 3 reveals the true, unmasked regioselectivity of the cycloaddition reaction.
