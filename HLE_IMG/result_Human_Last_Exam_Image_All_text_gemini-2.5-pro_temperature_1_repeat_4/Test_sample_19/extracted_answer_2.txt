1. The music modulates to the key of E minor.
2. The home key is C# minor, and its relative major is E major. The modulation is to E minor, which is the parallel minor of the relative major. This is a common modulation that moves to the mediant key area (a third away from the tonic) but darkens the expected major quality to minor, thus maintaining the piece's somber mood while providing harmonic contrast.
3. V7/iii
