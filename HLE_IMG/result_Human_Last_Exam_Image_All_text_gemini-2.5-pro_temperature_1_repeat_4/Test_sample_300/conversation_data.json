    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of each of the 9 works.\n\n**Analysis of each artwork:**\n\n*   **Work 1 (Top Row, Left):**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is a figure painting in ink and color on paper, depicting three women in what appears to be traditional attire of a Chinese ethnic minority. The style is realistic, especially in the rendering of the faces and hands, combined with expressive brushwork for the clothing.\n    *   **Artist Identification:** This style is characteristic of **Shi Guoliang (史国良)**, a prominent contemporary Chinese artist renowned for his realistic and evocative figure paintings, particularly of Tibetan people and other ethnic minorities.\n\n*   **Work 2 (Top Row, Middle):**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is an ink wash landscape painting. The traditional elements of mountains, trees, and houses are deconstructed into abstract forms, lines, and dots. It bridges traditional Chinese aesthetics with Western modernism.\n    *   **Artist Identification:** This distinctive style of abstracting landscapes into a rhythmic composition of points, lines, and planes is the signature of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**, a master of modern Chinese painting.\n\n*   **Work 3 (Top Row, Right):**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is a work of Chinese calligraphy in cursive script (草书). The brushwork is incredibly dynamic, energetic, and fluid, with a characteristic \"trembling\" quality to the lines.\n    *   **Artist Identification:** This powerful and expressive style is the hallmark of **Lin Sanzhi (林散之)**, one of the most revered masters of modern Chinese calligraphy, especially known for his mastery of cursive script.\n\n*   **Work 4 (Middle Row, Left):**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is another piece of cursive calligraphy. The script is flowing and simplified, yet it retains a clear structure, making it relatively legible for cursive script.\n    *   **Artist Identification:** This style is known as \"Standard Cursive Script\" (标准草书), a system developed and championed by **Yu Youren (于右任)**, a famous politician, scholar, and calligrapher of the Republic of China. His signature \"于右任\" is also recognizable.\n\n*   **Work 5 (Middle Row, Center):**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is a realist oil painting depicting a young woman in a white shirt, holding a brush or palette knife, seemingly in the act of painting. The style is a prime example of the \"Neoclassical\" movement in Chinese oil painting.\n    *   **Artist Identification:** This is a very famous and iconic painting titled \"Youth\" (青春), created by **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**. He is a leading figure in modern Chinese oil painting.\n\n*   **Work 6 (Middle Row, Right):**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is a painting of a woman, characterized by a square format, bold ink outlines, stylized and elongated facial features, and a blend of Chinese ink wash with Western-influenced use of color and form.\n    *   **Artist Identification:** This unique and highly recognizable style belongs to **Lin Fengmian (林风眠)**, a pioneering artist and educator who was instrumental in shaping modern Chinese art by synthesizing Chinese and European artistic traditions.\n\n*   **Work 7 (Bottom Row, Left):**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is a vibrant painting with heavy, bright colors. It depicts a rustic courtyard scene with growing gourds, laundry, and a chicken with its chicks. The style is cheerful, bold, and has a strong folk-art influence.\n    *   **Artist Identification:** The whimsical subject matter, the exuberant use of color, and the playful composition are trademarks of **Huang Yongyu (黄永玉)**, a renowned contemporary artist. His signature \"黄永玉\" is visible on the painting.\n\n*   **Work 8 (Bottom Row, Middle):**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is a Chinese landscape painting (shanshui) of a river gorge with boats. It is characterized by the use of dense, layered ink to create monumental and textured mountain forms, conveying a sense of weight and grandeur.\n    *   **Artist Identification:** This powerful landscape style, especially the technique of \"accumulated ink\" (积墨法), is the signature of **Li Keran (李可染)**, one of the most important masters of modern Chinese landscape painting.\n\n*   **Work 9 (Bottom Row, Right):**\n    *   **Subject and Style:** This is an ink wash painting of a single lobster. The work is notable for its simplicity, spontaneity, and the artist's ability to capture the creature's essence and vitality with very few, masterful brushstrokes.\n    *   **Artist Identification:** Painting shrimp, crabs, and other small creatures with such life and economy of means was the specialty of **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**, one of the most celebrated and influential figures in the history of Chinese painting.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the style, subject, and signatures of each artwork, the authors from left to right, top to bottom are:\n\n1.
