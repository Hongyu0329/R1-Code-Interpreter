    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks to identify which of the four depicted iridium complexes will have shorter lifetimes when used as emitters in Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs). In the context of device performance, \"lifetime\" refers to the operational stability, i.e., how long the device can function before its performance degrades significantly. A shorter lifetime implies lower chemical stability of the complex under operating conditions.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Molecular Structures:** All four complexes are cationic Iridium(III) coordination compounds with the general formula `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+`, where Ir is the central metal, C^N is a cyclometalating ligand, and N^N is a bidentate ancillary ligand. The counterion is hexafluorophosphate (PF6-).\n    *   **Central Metal and Geometry:** All complexes feature an Iridium(III) center in an octahedral coordination environment.\n    *   **Ancillary Ligand (N^N):** In all four structures, the ligand coordinated on the right side is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dtbbpy). Since this ligand is the same for all complexes, it will not be the primary factor determining the *relative* differences in their lifetimes.\n    *   **Cyclometalating Ligands (C^N):** The key difference between the four complexes lies in the substitution pattern on the two cyclometalating ligands. Let's analyze each one carefully, assuming the labels 1, 2, 3, and 4 correspond to the structures from left to right.\n        *   **Complex 1:** The C^N ligands are 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (`dfppy`). Each phenyl ring has two electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms.\n        *   **Complex 2:** The C^N ligands are 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine (`4Fppy`). Each phenyl ring has one electron-withdrawing fluorine atom at the para position relative to the Ir-C bond.\n        *   **Complex 3:** The C^N ligands are 2-phenylpyridine (`ppy`). The phenyl rings are not substituted with fluorine.\n        *   **Complex 4:** The C^N ligands are 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (`dfppy`), identical to those in Complex 1. It is likely that there is a duplication or error in the provided image, as typically four distinct but related compounds would be compared. However, for the purpose of this analysis, we will treat Complex 1 and Complex 4 as having the same structure and properties.\n\n3.  **Relate Structure to Stability (Lifetime):** The operational stability of these iridium emitters is largely dictated by the strength of the coordination bonds, particularly the Ir-C bond of the cyclometalating ligand, which is often the most labile point in the molecule. Degradation can occur through bond cleavage under electrical and thermal stress during device operation.\n    *   **Effect of Fluorination:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom and acts as a strong electron-withdrawing group (primarily through the inductive effect). When attached to the phenyl ring of the C^N ligand, fluorine atoms withdraw electron density. This withdrawal of electron density from the carbon atom involved in the Ir-C bond lowers the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the ligand, leading to a better energy match with the iridium d-orbitals. This results in a stronger, more covalent Ir-C bond.\n    *   **Stability Trend:** A stronger Ir-C bond leads to a more chemically robust complex, which is more resistant to degradation and thus has a longer operational lifetime. The stability increases with the degree of fluorination.\n    *   Therefore, we can establish a stability ranking among the complexes:\n        `ppy` (no F) < `4Fppy` (1 F) < `dfppy` (2 F)\n\n4.  **Rank the Complexes by Lifetime:** Since a longer lifetime corresponds to higher stability, we can rank the lifetimes of the complexes:\n    *   Lifetime(Complex 3) < Lifetime(Complex 2) < Lifetime(Complex 1) = Lifetime(Complex 4)\n\n5.  **Identify Complexes with Shorter Lifetimes:** The question asks for the complexes with \"shorter lifetimes\" (plural). Based on our ranking, the complexes with the shortest lifetimes are Complex 3 (the least stable) and Complex 2 (the second least stable). Compared to the di-fluorinated complexes (1 and 4), both the non-fluorinated and mono-fluorinated complexes are significantly less stable and would exhibit shorter operational lifetimes.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The complexes expected to show shorter lifetimes are Complex 2 and Complex 3.\n\n7.  **Match with Answer Choices:** The pair [2, 3] corresponds to answer choice H.\n\nFinal check of the reasoning: The principle that fluorination of cyclometalating ligands enhances the stability and operational lifetime of iridium complexes is a well-established design strategy in the field of OLEDs and LECs. The analysis is consistent with fundamental chemical principles and known experimental trends. The likely error in the image (duplication of Complex 1 and 4) does not affect the identification of the two least stable complexes in the set.\n\n<<<H>>>"
