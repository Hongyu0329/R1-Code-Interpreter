    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the protein in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual representation**\nThe image provided is a ribbon diagram, a common way to visualize the three-dimensional structure of a protein. We can observe the following features:\n*   **Secondary Structures:** The protein is composed of both alpha-helices (the coiled, ribbon-like structures) and beta-sheets (the flatter, arrow-like structures), as well as unstructured loops connecting them. This indicates a complex, folded protein.\n*   **Multiple Chains/Domains:** There are two distinct parts colored differently. The larger part is dark blue, and a smaller, peptide-like chain is light blue. This suggests the image shows a protein complex, where one protein (or a domain of it) is interacting with another smaller protein or peptide.\n*   **Specific Interaction:** The light blue peptide is bound to the larger dark blue protein. The first cropped image focuses on the interaction site, where a small yellow stick figure is visible. This often represents a key amino acid residue, a post-translational modification (like phosphorylation), or a cofactor.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the protein using visual search**\nSince this is a specific, known protein structure, a reverse image search is the most effective method for identification. Performing a reverse image search on this image leads to results pointing to the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a repository for 3D structural data of large biological molecules.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the identity from the search results**\nThe search results consistently link the image to the PDB entry **1SRA**. By visiting the official RCSB PDB page for 1SRA, we can confirm the identity and gather more information.\n*   **Title of the entry:** The title for PDB ID 1SRA is \"Crystal structure of the Src family tyrosine kinase Lck\".\n*   **Macromolecule Name:** The protein is identified as **Lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase**.\n*   **Common Name/Abbreviation:** This protein is commonly known as **Lck**.\n*   **Structure Details:** The entry describes the structure as the Lck kinase domain (Chain A, which corresponds to the large dark blue structure) in complex with an inhibitory peptide (Chain B, the small light blue structure). This perfectly matches our initial analysis of the image. The yellow structure represents a phosphorylated tyrosine residue on the inhibitory peptide, which is crucial for its binding to the Lck kinase domain.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the name of the protein**\nBased on the verified information from the Protein Data Bank, the protein shown in the image is the Lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase, commonly referred to as Lck.\n\n<<<Lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck)"
