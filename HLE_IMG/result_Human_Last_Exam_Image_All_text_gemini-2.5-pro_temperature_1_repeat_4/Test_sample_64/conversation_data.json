    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the process being depicted.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual components of the image.**\nThe image displays three microscopic views labeled L, M, and N. Each view shows a long, thin, tube-like structure. This structure is divided into segments by cross-walls, which are known as septa in organisms like fungi. The interior of the structure contains granular material, which is cytoplasm. The overall appearance is characteristic of a filamentous organism, such as a fungal hypha or a filamentous alga.\n\n**Step 2: Compare the different panels (L, M, and N).**\nThe panels appear to show different stages or examples of a specific event.\n*   **Panel L:** Shows a relatively uniform, cylindrical filament. The cells appear turgid and healthy. An arrowhead points to a septum, the junction between two cells.\n*   **Panel M:** Shows a similar filament, but there is a noticeable bulge at the septum indicated by the arrowhead. The cell wall at this junction seems to be stretching outwards.\n*   **Panel N:** Shows a more extreme version of the event in panel M. The bulge at the septum is much larger and more pronounced. The filament is bent at this point, and the cell appears to have ruptured or is on the verge of rupturing. The cell below the bulge seems to have lost its rigid shape, suggesting a loss of internal pressure.\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the observed changes.**\nThe progression from a normal cell (L) to a bulging cell (M) and finally to a bursting cell (N) indicates a process of cellular destruction. The bulging is caused by high internal pressure (turgor pressure) pushing against a weakened point in the cell wall. When the cell wall can no longer withstand this pressure, it ruptures.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the biological process.**\nThe bursting of a cell due to the rupture of its cell wall or membrane is known as **lysis**. In walled cells like those of fungi or plants, this often happens when the cell is in a hypotonic environment (the surrounding fluid has a lower solute concentration than the cell's interior). Water rushes into the cell via osmosis, increasing the turgor pressure to a point that the cell wall cannot contain, leading to **osmotic lysis**. The images specifically show lysis occurring at the septum, which is a known weak point in some filamentous fungi, especially under certain stress conditions or in specific mutants.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe image depicts the process of a cell breaking down and bursting. The key visual evidence is the progressive bulging and rupture of the cell wall at the septum. This process is called cell lysis.\n\n<<<Cell lysis>>>"
