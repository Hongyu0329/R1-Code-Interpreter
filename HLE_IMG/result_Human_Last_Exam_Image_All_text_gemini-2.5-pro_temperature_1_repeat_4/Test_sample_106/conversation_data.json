    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the substituents at the indicated positions.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction**\n\n1.  **Reaction Type:** The reaction shows a polycyclic alcohol treated with catalytic acid (HCl) and heat. This is a classic acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction, which proceeds via a carbocation intermediate. The significant structural difference between the reactant and the product indicates that a complex carbocation rearrangement has occurred. The question explicitly states this involves a number of [1,2] shifts. This type of rearrangement in triterpenoids is known as a \"backbone rearrangement\".\n\n2.  **Step 1: Formation of the Initial Carbocation.**\n    *   The acid protonates the hydroxyl (-OH) group on the reactant, turning it into a good leaving group (-OH2+).\n    *   The water molecule departs, leaving a secondary carbocation at C-3 (using standard triterpenoid numbering).\n\n3.  **Step 2: Carbocation Rearrangement Cascade.**\n    Carbocations rearrange to form more stable intermediates. The cascade of shifts aims to move the positive charge through the molecular skeleton.\n\n    *   **Initiation of the Cascade:** There are two plausible initial rearrangements from the C-3 carbocation.\n        *   **Path A (Classic Backbone):** A [1,2]-methyl shift from the adjacent quaternary C-4. This would move one of the methyl groups from C-4 to C-3, and the positive charge to the now tertiary C-4.\n        *   **Path B (Alternative):** A [1,2]-hydride shift from the adjacent tertiary C-5. This would move the hydrogen from C-5 to C-3, and the positive charge to the tertiary C-5.\n    *   **Choosing the Path:** We must examine the product structure. The product drawing shows a gem-dimethyl group (two CH3 groups on the same carbon) at the position corresponding to C-4 (one CH3 is explicitly drawn, the other is indicated by label \"1\"). If Path A had occurred, C-4 would have only one methyl group left. Since the product shows two methyls at C-4, this strongly suggests that the gem-dimethyl group at C-4 was not involved in the initial rearrangement. Therefore, **Path B is the correct mechanism**.\n\n4.  **Tracing the [1,2] Shifts (Path B):**\n    *   **Initial State:** C-3 has `+` charge. C-4 has two Me's. C-5 has one H. C-10 has one Me. C-9 has one H. C-8 has one Me. C-14 has one Me. C-13 has one H. C-18 has one H.\n    *   **Shift 1:** [1,2]-H shift from C-5 to C-3. The positive charge moves to C-5.\n        *   *Result:* `+` at C-5. C-4 remains unchanged.\n    *   **Shift 2:** [1,2]-Me shift from C-10 to C-5. The positive charge moves to C-10.\n        *   *Result:* `+` at C-10. C-5 now has a methyl group.\n    *   **Shift 3:** [1,2]-H shift from C-9 to C-10. The positive charge moves to C-9.\n        *   *Result:* `+` at C-9. C-10 now has a hydrogen.\n    *   **Shift 4:** [1,2]-Me shift from C-8 to C-9. The positive charge moves to C-8.\n        *   *Result:* `+` at C-8. C-9 now has a methyl group.\n    *   **Shift 5:** [1,2]-Me shift from C-14 to C-8. The positive charge moves to C-14.\n        *   *Result:* `+` at C-14. C-8 now has a methyl group.\n    *   **Shift 6:** [1,2]-H shift from C-13 to C-14. The positive charge moves to C-13.\n        *   *Result:* `+` at C-13. C-14 now has a hydrogen.\n\n5.  **Step 3: Elimination.**\n    *   The final carbocation is at C-13. A base (H2O) removes a proton from the adjacent C-18.\n    *   This forms a stable, tetrasubstituted double bond between C-13 and C-18, yielding the final product.\n\n**Determining the Substituents**\n\nNow we determine the final substituent (H or CH3) at each of the numbered positions by mapping the labels to the carbons in the product and checking their state after the rearrangement.\n\n*   **Position 1:** This label is on one of the methyl groups at C-4. In our chosen mechanism, the C-4 gem-dimethyl group was untouched. Therefore, the substituent is a methyl group.\n    *   **1 = CH3**\n*   **Position 2:** This label is on the substituent at the C-8 position. C-8 started with a methyl group, which migrated away to C-9. Then, it received a methyl group that migrated from C-14. Therefore, the final substituent is a methyl group.\n    *   **2 = CH3**\n*   **Position 3:** This label is on the substituent at the C-9 position. C-9 started with a hydrogen, which migrated to C-10. Then, it received a methyl group from C-8. Therefore, the final substituent is a methyl group.\n    *   **3 = CH3**\n*   **Position 4:** This label is on the substituent at the C-14 position. C-14 started with a methyl group, which migrated to C-8. Then, it received a hydrogen from C-13. Therefore, the final substituent is a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **4 = H**\n*   **Position 5:** This label is on the substituent at the C-10 position. C-10 started with a methyl group, which migrated to C-5. Then, it received a hydrogen from C-9. Therefore, the final substituent is a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **5 = H**\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1 = CH3\n2 = CH3\n3 = CH3\n4 = H\n5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = CH3, 4 = H, 5 = H>>>"
