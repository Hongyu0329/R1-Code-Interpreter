    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the main action in the image.**\n    The image, painted on a Greek vase, depicts a chaotic scene centered around a chariot. A nude male figure is shown on the ground, positioned under and behind the chariot's wheel. His body is contorted in a way that suggests a violent fall or being dragged. This figure is clearly the one who has just unintentionally \"left\" the chariot.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the figures and their roles.**\n    *   **The Fallen Figure:** A young, athletic, nude male. His dramatic pose signifies a tragic event, likely death or mortal injury. This is the subject of the question.\n    *   **Figures in the Chariot:** There are two figures remaining in the chariot. The driver wears an ornate, patterned sleeve and a distinctive headdress (often identified as a Phrygian cap), typical attire for a charioteer or a foreigner in Greek art. Behind the driver is a female figure with flowing robes, whose head is surrounded by a nimbus or halo, suggesting she is a divine or supernatural being.\n    *   **The Winged Figure:** Above the horse (partially seen on the left), a winged figure is present. This could be Nike (Victory) or another divine messenger.\n    *   **The Horse:** The horse pulling the chariot appears panicked, contributing to the sense of chaos.\n\n*   **Step 3: Connect the scene to Greek mythology.**\n    The scene of a young man being killed by his own chariot is a well-known story in Greek mythology. This specific iconography strongly points to the myth of Hippolytus.\n    *   **The Myth of Hippolytus:** Hippolytus, son of King Theseus, was a chaste follower of the goddess Artemis. He scorned Aphrodite, the goddess of love. As revenge, Aphrodite made Hippolytus's stepmother, Phaedra, fall in love with him. When he rejected her, she falsely accused him of assault to Theseus before killing herself. Enraged, Theseus used a curse given to him by his father, the sea god Poseidon, to punish his son. As Hippolytus drove his chariot by the sea, Poseidon sent a bull from the waves. The monster terrified Hippolytus's horses, which bolted. Hippolytus was thrown from the chariot, became entangled in the reins, and was dragged to his death.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude the identity of the figure.**\n    The fallen figure perfectly matches the description of Hippolytus at the moment of his tragic death. The other figures support this identification: the female figure in the chariot is often interpreted as Lyssa (the personification of Madness), sent by the gods to drive the horses wild. Therefore, the figure leaving the chariot is the protagonist of this myth.\n\n*   **Final Answer Formulation:**\n    The figure shown falling from the chariot and lying on the ground is the mythological hero Hippolytus. The scene depicts the tragic climax of his story.\n\n<<<Hippolytus>>>"
