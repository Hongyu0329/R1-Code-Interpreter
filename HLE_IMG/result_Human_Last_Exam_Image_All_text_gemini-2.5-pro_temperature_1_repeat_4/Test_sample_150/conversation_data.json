    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n    *   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride.\n    *   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a **Friedel-Crafts Acylation**. The electrophile, the propanoyl cation (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O), is generated and attacks the benzene ring.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-1):** The propanoyl group is attached to the benzene ring, forming **propiophenone** (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-1:** A phenyl group attached to a carbonyl group, which is in turn attached to an ethyl group. (Ph-CO-CH₂CH₃)\n\n2.  **Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n    *   **Reactant:** Propiophenone (Intermediate-1).\n    *   **Reagents:** Br₂ and FeBr₃ (a Lewis acid).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is an **Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**. The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group, which deactivates the ring and directs incoming electrophiles to the **meta** position.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-2):** A bromine atom is added to the meta position relative to the propanoyl group. The product is **3-bromopropiophenone** (or 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-2:** A benzene ring substituted with a propanoyl group at position 1 and a bromine atom at position 3.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n    *   **Reactant:** 3-bromopropiophenone (Intermediate-2).\n    *   **Reagents:** H₂ / Pd (Catalytic Hydrogenation).\n    *   **Reaction:** This hydrogenation can reduce multiple functional groups. The substrate has two reducible groups: a benzylic ketone and an aryl bromide.\n        *   **Ketone Reduction:** The benzylic ketone (C=O) can be reduced to an alcohol (-CHOH) or completely reduced to an alkane (-CH₂-) via hydrogenolysis.\n        *   **Aryl Bromide Reduction:** The C-Br bond can also be cleaved by catalytic hydrogenation (hydrogenolysis).\n    *   **Careful Point:** Standard catalytic hydrogenation with Pd on a substrate like this is powerful enough to reduce both functional groups. The benzylic ketone is reduced to an alkane (propyl group), and the aryl bromide is dehalogenated (the bromine is replaced by hydrogen).\n    *   **Product (Intermediate-3):** The complete reduction of 3-bromopropiophenone results in **propylbenzene**.\n    *   **Structure of Intermediate-3:** A phenyl group attached to a propyl group. (Ph-CH₂CH₂CH₃)\n\n4.  **Step 4: Intermediate-3 to Final Product**\n    *   **Reactant:** Propylbenzene (Intermediate-3).\n    *   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator), in CCl₄ (solvent).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a **radical substitution reaction**, specifically an **allylic/benzylic bromination**. NBS is a specific reagent that provides a low concentration of Br₂ and Br• radicals, which selectively substitutes a hydrogen atom at the benzylic position.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The benzylic position is the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. In propylbenzene (Ph-CH₂CH₂CH₃), this is the first carbon of the propyl chain.\n    *   **Product:** One of the two benzylic hydrogens on propylbenzene is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Structure of the Final Product:** Ph-CH(Br)-CH₂CH₃.\n    *   **Naming the Final Product:** Following IUPAC nomenclature, the longest carbon chain is propane. The substituents are a bromine atom and a phenyl group, both at position 1. Listing them alphabetically gives the name **1-bromo-1-phenylpropane**.\n\n**Summary of Transformations:**\n\n*   Benzene → Propiophenone\n*   Propiophenone → 3-Bromopropiophenone\n*   3-Bromopropiophenone → Propylbenzene\n*   Propylbenzene → 1-Bromo-1-phenylpropane\n\nThe final product is 1-bromo-1-phenylpropane.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-phenylpropane>>>"
