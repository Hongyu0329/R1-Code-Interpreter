    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the name of the given alkaloid compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the overall structure and functional groups.**\n*   The molecule is a complex organic compound containing carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.\n*   The presence of nitrogen atoms within a heterocyclic ring system, and its origin as a natural product, classifies it as an alkaloid.\n*   The structure consists of four fused rings, making it a tetracyclic compound.\n*   There are two nitrogen atoms, both of which are tertiary amines integrated into the ring system.\n*   There is a carbonyl group (C=O). This carbonyl group is adjacent to one of the nitrogen atoms within a six-membered ring. This functional group is known as a lactam (a cyclic amide).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the parent skeleton.**\n*   The core tetracyclic skeleton containing two nitrogen atoms is characteristic of a class of alkaloids known as lupin alkaloids.\n*   Specifically, this framework is derived from the parent alkaloid **sparteine**. Sparteine has the same four-ring system but lacks the carbonyl group (it has a -CH2- group instead).\n*   The given compound is an oxo-derivative of sparteine. The presence of the carbonyl group at the C-2 position (standard numbering) of the sparteine skeleton defines the compound.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the specific name.**\n*   The common name for 2-oxosparteine is **Lupanine**.\n*   Lupanine is a major quinolizidine alkaloid found in the seeds of various plants in the Lupinus genus (lupins).\n*   The diagram also shows specific stereochemistry (indicated by wedges and dashes at the chiral centers). This particular arrangement of stereocenters corresponds to the most common natural isomer, (+)-Lupanine.\n\n**Step 4: Final Verification.**\n*   Comparing the provided structure with the known chemical structure of Lupanine confirms the identity. The connectivity of the atoms, the four-ring system, the placement of the two nitrogen atoms, and the position of the lactam group all match perfectly with Lupanine.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis of its tetracyclic lactam structure derived from the sparteine skeleton, the compound is identified as the alkaloid Lupanine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
