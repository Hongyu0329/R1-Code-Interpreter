    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Determine the ECG paper speed and calibration:** The information at the top left of the ECG strip indicates a paper speed of **25 mm/sec**. This is the standard speed for ECGs. This means that every 25 millimeters on the horizontal axis represents 1 second of time.\n\n2.  **Calculate the time per square on the grid:**\n    *   The ECG paper is composed of a grid of small and large squares.\n    *   One small square is 1 mm wide. The time for one small square is 1 mm / (25 mm/sec) = **0.04 seconds**.\n    *   One large square is 5 mm wide (it contains 5 small squares). The time for one large square is 5 mm / (25 mm/sec) = **0.20 seconds**.\n\n3.  **Identify the R waves and R-R intervals:** The R waves are the tall, sharp, upward spikes of the QRS complexes. The R-R interval is the time duration between the peaks of two consecutive R waves.\n\n4.  **Visually scan the entire rhythm strip for the longest R-R interval:** By examining the entire tracing, we look for the widest gap between any two consecutive R waves. The rhythm is clearly irregular, with periods of faster heart rate and at least one significant pause. This longest pause is located in the fourth row of the tracing (which starts around the timestamp `0:06:08`). The pause occurs between the 4th and 5th QRS complexes in that row.\n\n5.  **Measure the longest R-R interval:**\n    *   We will measure the distance between the peak of the 4th R wave and the peak of the 5th R wave in that fourth row.\n    *   Let's align the peak of the 4th R wave with a major vertical grid line (the start of a large square).\n    *   From this starting point, we count the number of large squares to the peak of the 5th R wave. There are **8 full large squares**.\n    *   After the 8th large square, there are an additional **2 small squares** before reaching the peak of the 5th R wave.\n\n6.  **Calculate the duration in seconds:**\n    *   We can now convert this measurement into time.\n    *   Time for 8 large squares = 8 * 0.20 seconds = 1.60 seconds.\n    *   Time for 2 small squares = 2 * 0.04 seconds = 0.08 seconds.\n    *   Total time = 1.60 seconds + 0.08 seconds = **1.68 seconds**.\n\n    *   Alternatively, we can count the total number of small squares: (8 large squares * 5 small squares/large square) + 2 small squares = 40 + 2 = 42 small squares.\n    *   Total time = 42 small squares * 0.04 seconds/small square = **1.68 seconds**.\n\nTherefore, the longest R-R interval on this rhythm strip is 1.68 seconds.\n\n<<<1.68>>>"
