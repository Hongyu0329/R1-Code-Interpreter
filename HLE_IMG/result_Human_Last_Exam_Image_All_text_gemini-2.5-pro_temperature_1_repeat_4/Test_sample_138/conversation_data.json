    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the sex of each insect. The general rules for sexing these types of insects (Hymenoptera) involve looking at antennae, the tip of the abdomen, and facial markings.\n\n**Analysis of Pair A:**\nThese are cuckoo bees, likely of the genus *Coelioxys*. These bees are cleptoparasites, meaning the females lay eggs in the nests of other bees. Consequently, females do not collect pollen and lack scopae (specialized pollen-carrying hairs), which fits the question's description.\n*   **Insect A (Left):** The abdomen is strongly tapered to a single, sharp, conical point. This is a characteristic feature of a female *Coelioxys*, which uses this modified abdomen to pierce the host's nest cell.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** The abdomen is also tapered but ends with multiple prongs or spines. This is the characteristic genital structure of a male *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** The left insect is a female (F) and the right insect is a male (M). This corresponds to option **4 (F, M)**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair B:**\nThese are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. Wasps do not have scopae, as they typically prey on other insects to feed their young, though adults of both sexes drink nectar.\n*   **Insect B (Left):** The most telling feature is the antennae, which are distinctly curled at the tips. This is a classic characteristic of male paper wasps.\n*   **Insect B (Right):** The antennae are straight, not curled. The abdomen also appears more pointed, which is typical for a female that possesses a stinger.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** The left insect is a male (M) and the right insect is a female (F). This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair C:**\nThese appear to be long-horned bees (tribe Eucerini). In this group, sexual dimorphism is very pronounced.\n*   **Insect C (Left):** This bee has extremely long antennae, a defining characteristic of males in this group (hence the name \"long-horned bees\"). Additionally, the clypeus (the facial plate below the antennae) is bright yellow, another common male trait.\n*   **Insect C (Right):** This bee has significantly shorter antennae, which are typical for a female. While female long-horned bees do have scopae on their legs (which seems to contradict the prompt's premise), the antennae length is an unmistakable feature for sexing these bees. The prompt may be referring to the overall collection having examples of taxa without scopae (like A and B), not that every single insect shown lacks them.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** The left insect is a male (M) and the right insect is a female (F). This corresponds to option **3 (M, F)**.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n*   Pair A: Female, Male (F, M) -> Index 4\n*   Pair B: Male, Female (M, F) -> Index 3\n*   Pair C: Male, Female (M, F) -> Index 3\n\nCombining these results gives the final answer.\n\n<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
