    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to guess the country from the small part of the flag:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual information provided in the image.**\nThe image displays a small section of a flag, located in the top-left corner of a 3x2 grid. The visible part of the flag consists of three horizontal stripes. From top to bottom, the colors are black, white, and red. The other parts of the grid are greyed out, obscuring the rest of the flag.\n\n**Step 2: Search for national flags with this specific color combination and arrangement.**\nA search for current national flags that are a horizontal tricolor of black, white, and red (in that order from top to bottom) reveals no such flag for a sovereign nation. This combination was used by historical entities like the German Empire (1871-1918) and the Republic of Upper Volta (1959-1984), but these flag puzzles typically use current national flags.\n\n**Step 3: Consider common puzzle tricks, such as inversion.**\nSince no current flag matches the image directly, a common trick in such puzzles is to show the flag upside down. If we invert the order of the stripes, we get red on top, white in the middle, and black on the bottom.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the country with the inverted flag.**\nThe Red-White-Black horizontal tricolor is known as the Arab Liberation Flag and is used by several countries:\n*   **Yemen:** The flag of Yemen is a plain Red-White-Black tricolor.\n*   **Egypt:** The flag of Egypt is a Red-White-Black tricolor with the golden Eagle of Saladin in the center of the white stripe.\n*   **Syria:** The flag of Syria is a Red-White-Black tricolor with two green stars in the center of the white stripe.\n*   **Iraq:** The flag of Iraq is a Red-White-Black tricolor with the TakbÄ«r (\"Allahu Akbar\") in green Kufic script in the center of the white stripe.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the most likely answer.**\nThe image shows a section from the side of the flag, which would not contain the central emblems of Egypt, Syria, or Iraq. Therefore, the visible stripes could belong to any of these four countries. However, the most fundamental and unadorned version of the Red-White-Black tricolor is the flag of Yemen. In the context of a flag guessing game, when presented with just the plain stripes, Yemen is the most direct and common answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe flag shown in the image is an inverted version of the flag of Yemen.\n\n<<<Yemen>>>"
