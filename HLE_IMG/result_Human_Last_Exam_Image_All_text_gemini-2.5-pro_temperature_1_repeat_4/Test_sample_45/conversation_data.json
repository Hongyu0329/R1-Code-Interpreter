    "*   **Step 1: Understand the definition of rotational symmetry.**\n    Rotational symmetry describes how many times a figure or pattern can be rotated by an angle less than 360 degrees and still look exactly the same as the original. The \"order\" of rotational symmetry is the number of such rotations possible in a full 360-degree turn. For example, a square has 4-fold rotational symmetry because it looks the same after rotations of 90°, 180°, and 270°.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the components of the tiling.**\n    The image displays a periodic tiling pattern made up of three different shapes:\n    1.  Dark blue regular hexagons.\n    2.  Light yellow squares.\n    3.  Orange rhombuses (four-sided figures with equal side lengths).\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify potential centers of rotation.**\n    To find the rotational symmetry of the entire pattern, we need to find points around which the entire tiling can be rotated and remain unchanged. The most likely candidates for centers of rotation are the centers of the geometric shapes or the vertices where multiple shapes meet.\n\n*   **Step 4: Test for different orders of rotational symmetry.**\n    Let's test the most promising candidates for centers of rotation. A prominent feature in the pattern is the star-like motif formed by a central blue hexagon surrounded by six yellow squares and six orange rhombuses.\n\n    *   **Center of a blue hexagon:** Let's choose the center of one of the blue hexagons as our rotation point.\n        *   A single regular hexagon has 6-fold rotational symmetry (it can be rotated by 360°/6 = 60° and look the same).\n        *   Now, let's see if the surrounding pattern also aligns after a 60° rotation around this point.\n        *   When we rotate the pattern by 60°, the central blue hexagon rotates onto itself.\n        *   Each of the six yellow squares surrounding it moves into the exact position of the adjacent yellow square.\n        *   Each of the six orange rhombuses moves into the exact position of the adjacent orange rhombus.\n        *   Looking further out, the entire network of tiles seems to map perfectly onto itself after this 60° rotation.\n        *   Since the pattern is identical after a 60° rotation, it has at least 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n*   **Step 5: Consider other possible centers and orders of symmetry.**\n    *   **Center of a yellow square:** A square has 4-fold rotational symmetry (90° rotations). If we pick the center of a yellow square, the tiling does indeed map onto itself after a 90° rotation. So, the tiling also has points of 4-fold symmetry.\n    *   **Other points:** There are also points of 2-fold and 3-fold symmetry in this specific tiling pattern. For example, the vertex where two hexagons and two rhombuses meet is a center of 2-fold rotation.\n    *   However, the question \"what is the rotational symmetry of the tiling?\" typically asks for the highest order of rotational symmetry present in the pattern.\n\n*   **Step 6: Conclude the highest order of rotational symmetry.**\n    We have identified points of 6-fold symmetry, 4-fold symmetry, and other lower-order symmetries. The highest order of rotational symmetry present in the tiling is 6. This is consistent with the Crystallographic Restriction Theorem, which states that for a periodic crystal or tiling, only 2, 3, 4, and 6-fold rotational symmetries are possible. Since we have found 6-fold symmetry, this is the highest possible and the correct answer.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
