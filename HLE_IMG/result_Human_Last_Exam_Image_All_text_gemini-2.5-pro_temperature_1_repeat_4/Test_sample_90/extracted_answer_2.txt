The structures of the three products A, B, and C are as follows:

**Product A (C₁₄H₂₀N₂O₃):**
The structure is methyl 7-(1-acetyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolizine-6-carboxylate. It is formed via a [3+2] cycloaddition reaction involving a münchnone intermediate.

```
 

**Product B (C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₃):**
The structure is a bridged, tricyclic lactam formed from an [8π+2π] cycloaddition followed by elimination of methanol.
```
A complex bridged structure containing two fused five-membered rings and another larger ring containing a cis-C=C bond and two lactam carbonyls.
```
 

**Product C (C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₃):**
The structure is (8aS)-1-acetylhexahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine-4,7-dione. It is formed by the intramolecular cyclization of the starting material in the presence of acetic anhydride.
```
A bicyclic structure made of a five-membered pyrrolidine ring fused to a six-membered piperazine-dione ring. An acetyl group is attached to one of the nitrogen atoms.
