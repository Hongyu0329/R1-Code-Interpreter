The main difference is the shape of the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, holding the capsule erect and immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctly curved (arcuate) seta, which causes the capsule to be cernuous or nodding.
