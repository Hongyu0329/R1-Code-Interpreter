    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Molecular Ion (M⁺) and Molecular Weight (MW)**\n*   The peak with the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) that is part of a cluster representing the intact molecule is the molecular ion peak.\n*   Looking at the spectrum, the highest m/z cluster appears to start at **m/z 260**. The peaks in this region are at m/z 260, 262, 264, and 266.\n*   Therefore, the monoisotopic molecular weight of the compound is 260 u.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Presence and Number of Halogen Atoms**\n*   The presence of chlorine or bromine atoms gives a characteristic isotopic pattern due to their natural isotopes (³⁵Cl/³⁷Cl and ⁷⁹Br/⁸¹Br).\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Ion Cluster (m/z 260, 262, 264, 266):** This pattern of peaks separated by 2 mass units is characteristic of a molecule containing multiple chlorine atoms.\n*   **Analysis of Key Fragments:**\n    *   The base peak (the most intense peak, 100% relative intensity) is at **m/z 225**.\n    *   The mass difference between the molecular ion and the base peak is 260 - 225 = 35 u. This corresponds to the loss of a chlorine atom (³⁵Cl). This is a very common fragmentation for chlorinated compounds and strongly supports our identification of m/z 260 as the M⁺ peak. The base peak is therefore the [M-Cl]⁺ fragment.\n    *   Now, let's analyze the isotopic pattern of the base peak itself. We see peaks at m/z 225 (I=100%), m/z 227 (I=66.7%), and m/z 229 (I=22.2%).\n    *   For a fragment containing two chlorine atoms, the expected intensity ratio for the peaks at M', M'+2, and M'+4 is approximately 100 : 65 : 11.\n    *   Our observed ratio for the first two peaks, I(227)/I(225) = 66.7/100 ≈ 0.67, is an excellent match for the presence of **two chlorine atoms** in the fragment at m/z 225.\n*   **Conclusion on Chlorine Content:** Since the [M-Cl]⁺ fragment contains two chlorine atoms, the original molecule must have contained a total of **three chlorine atoms**.\n\n**Step 3: Propose a Molecular Formula**\n*   We know the molecule contains 3 Cl atoms and has a monoisotopic mass of 260 u.\n*   The mass contribution from three ³⁵Cl atoms is 3 × 35 = 105 u.\n*   The mass of the rest of the molecule is 260 - 105 = 155 u. This part is composed of C, H, and possibly other elements like oxygen or nitrogen.\n*   Let's analyze the peak at **m/z 229** (I=22.2%). As noted in Step 2, the expected intensity for the isotope peak [M-Cl]⁺+4 is only ~11%. The observed intensity is double this. This suggests an overlap with another fragment ion.\n*   A common fragmentation is the loss of a methoxy radical (-OCH₃), which has a mass of 31 u. Let's check if this fits: M⁺ - 31 = 260 - 31 = 229. This matches perfectly.\n*   This suggests the molecule contains a methoxy group and the peak at m/z 229 is a combination of the [M-Cl]⁺+4 isotope peak and the [M-OCH₃]⁺ fragment.\n*   If the molecule contains oxygen, the remaining mass of 155 u can be assigned to C, H, and O. Let's assume one oxygen atom (mass 16 u). The mass of the hydrocarbon part would be 155 - 16 = 139 u. A plausible formula for a C, H part with mass 139 is C₁₁H₇ (11×12 + 7×1 = 132 + 7 = 139).\n*   Thus, the proposed molecular formula is **C₁₁H₇OCl₃**. This can also be written as C₁₀H₄(OCH₃)Cl₃ to reflect the methoxy group.\n*   Let's verify the molecular weight: MW(C₁₁H₇OCl₃) = 11(12.00) + 7(1.01) + 1(16.00) + 3(34.97) ≈ 260 u. The formula is consistent.\n\n**Step 4: Propose a Structure and Verify Fragmentation**\n*   The formula C₁₁H₇OCl₃, combined with the presence of a methoxy group, strongly suggests a **trichloromethoxynaphthalene** structure. The naphthalene core (C₁₀H₈) fits the carbon count and the high degree of unsaturation required by the formula.\n*   Let's verify the main fragments with this structure type:\n    *   **m/z 260:** Molecular ion [C₁₁H₇OCl₃]⁺•.\n    *   **m/z 225:** Base peak, loss of Cl• gives the stable [C₁₁H₇OCl₂]⁺ ion.\n    *   **m/z 190:** Loss of a second Cl• from the m/z 225 fragment gives [C₁₁H₇OCl]⁺•. The high intensity (48.4%) is consistent with this sequential loss.\n    *   **m/z 155:** Loss of the third Cl• from the m/z 190 fragment gives [C₁₁H₇O]⁺•, which is the methoxynaphthyl radical cation.\n\n**Step 5: Provide the IUPAC Name**\nThe analysis consistently points to a trichloromethoxynaphthalene. There are many possible isomers for the positions of the three chlorine atoms and the methoxy group on the naphthalene ring system. Without further information (like NMR data), it's impossible to pinpoint the exact isomer. However, a valid IUPAC name for any one of these isomers would correspond to the determined formula and fragmentation pattern. A plausible example is 2,3,4-trichloro-1-methoxynaphthalene. Since the exact isomer is not specified, a more general name is also acceptable, but typically a specific name is expected.\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the mass spectrum, the compound is a trichloromethoxynaphthalene.\n\n<<<2,3,4-Trichloro-1-methoxynaphthalene>>>"
