    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe goal is to find the cutoff frequency of the circuit at node $a_0$. The circuit consists of an infinite resistive ladder network, an input source `IN` at node $c_0$, and a capacitor $C$ connected between node $a_0$ and ground.\n\nThe cutoff frequency ($f_c$ or $\\omega_c$) is typically the -3dB frequency of the transfer function from the input to the output. Here, the output is the voltage at node $a_0$. The circuit at node $a_0$ forms a low-pass filter. The cutoff frequency for such a filter is determined by the capacitor $C$ and the Thevenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, seen by the capacitor.\n\n**2. Thevenin Equivalent Circuit**\n\nThe cutoff angular frequency, $\\omega_c$, for an RC low-pass filter is given by the formula:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C}$\n\nTo find the cutoff frequency, we first need to calculate the Thevenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, of the resistive ladder network as seen from node $a_0$.\n\nTo calculate $R_{th}$, we perform two steps:\n1.  Remove the capacitor $C$.\n2.  Set the input voltage source `IN` to zero, which means node $c_0$ is connected to ground.\n3.  Calculate the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground.\n\n**3. Analyzing the Circuit for $R_{th}$**\n\nThe circuit for calculating $R_{th}$ is the infinite resistive ladder with node $c_0$ grounded. We need to find the resistance looking into node $a_0$.\n\n*   **Circuit Structure:** The ladder is composed of repeating H-sections. Each section consists of a series resistor $r$ on the top rail (e.g., between $c_{n-1}$ and $c_n$), a series resistor $r$ on the bottom rail (e.g., between $d_{n-1}$ and $d_n$), and a shunt resistor $r$ connecting the two rails (e.g., between $c_n$ and $d_n$).\n*   **Interpretation:** Node $a_0$ is the starting point of the bottom rail, and node $c_0$ is the starting point of the top rail. The ladder extends infinitely to the right, starting from the first section that connects $(c_0, a_0)$ to $(c_1, d_1)$.\n*   **Path from $a_0$:** From node $a_0$, there is a single resistor $r$ connecting to node $d_1$. Therefore, the total Thevenin resistance is the sum of this resistor and the equivalent resistance from node $d_1$ to ground.\n    $R_{th} = r + R_{d1-gnd}$\n\n**4. Using the Characteristic Impedance of the Infinite Ladder**\n\nThe part of the ladder from nodes $(c_1, d_1)$ to infinity can be replaced by its characteristic impedance, $Z_c$. This impedance is the resistance that would be measured between the two rails ($c_n$ and $d_n$) if the ladder were infinitely long.\n\n*   **Calculating Characteristic Impedance ($Z_c$):** For an infinite ladder of the given H-sections, the characteristic impedance can be calculated using transmission line theory or ABCD parameters. The result for this specific network topology is:\n    $Z_c = r\\sqrt{3}$\n*   **Simplified Circuit:** We can now replace the entire ladder to the right of $(c_1, d_1)$ with a single resistor of value $R_{inf} = Z_c = r\\sqrt{3}$ connected between nodes $c_1$ and $d_1$.\n\n**5. Calculating $R_{d1-gnd}$**\n\nNow we analyze the simplified circuit to find the resistance from node $d_1$ to ground ($R_{d1-gnd}$).\n\n1.  At node $d_1$, we have the original shunt resistor $r$ to node $c_1$ and the equivalent resistor $R_{inf} = r\\sqrt{3}$ also to node $c_1$. These two are in parallel.\n    $R_{parallel} = r \\parallel R_{inf} = \\frac{r \\cdot (r\\sqrt{3})}{r + r\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{r^2\\sqrt{3}}{r(1+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{1+\\sqrt{3}}$\n2.  Node $c_1$ is connected to ground (since $c_0$ is grounded) through a resistor $r$.\n3.  The path from $d_1$ to ground is through the parallel combination $R_{parallel}$ to $c_1$, and then through the series resistor $r$ from $c_1$ to ground.\n    $R_{d1-gnd} = R_{parallel} + r = \\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{1+\\sqrt{3}} + r$\n\n**6. Calculating the Total Thevenin Resistance $R_{th}$**\n\nNow we can calculate the total Thevenin resistance.\n\n$R_{th} = r + R_{d1-gnd} = r + \\left(\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{1+\\sqrt{3}} + r\\right) = 2r + \\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{1+\\sqrt{3}}$\n\nTo simplify this expression, we find a common denominator:\n\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r(1+\\sqrt{3}) + r\\sqrt{3}}{1+\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2r + 2r\\sqrt{3} + r\\sqrt{3}}{1+\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2r + 3r\\sqrt{3}}{1+\\sqrt{3}} = r\\frac{2 + 3\\sqrt{3}}{1 + \\sqrt{3}}$\n\nTo simplify further, we can rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $( \\sqrt{3}-1)$:\n\n$R_{th} = r\\frac{(2 + 3\\sqrt{3})(\\sqrt{3}-1)}{(\\sqrt{3}+1)(\\sqrt{3}-1)} = r\\frac{2\\sqrt{3} - 2 + 3(\\sqrt{3})^2 - 3\\sqrt{3}}{(\\sqrt{3})^2 - 1^2} = r\\frac{2\\sqrt{3} - 2 + 9 - 3\\sqrt{3}}{3-1} = r\\frac{7 - \\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n\n**7. Determining the Cutoff Frequency**\n\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $R_{th}$ into the formula for the cutoff angular frequency $\\omega_c$.\n\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C} = \\frac{1}{\\left(r\\frac{7 - \\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)C} = \\frac{2}{rC(7 - \\sqrt{3})}$\n\nThe cutoff frequency $f_c$ is $\\omega_c / (2\\pi)$:\n\n$f_c = \\frac{\\omega_c}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{\\pi rC(7 - \\sqrt{3})}$\n\nThe question asks for the \"cutoff frequency\", which can refer to either $\\omega_c$ or $f_c$. The expression for the angular frequency $\\omega_c$ is typically simpler.\n\nThe cutoff frequency (in radians per second) at node $a_0$ is $\\frac{2}{rC(7 - \\sqrt{3})}$.\n\n<<<2 / (r*C*(7 - sqrt(3)))>>>"
