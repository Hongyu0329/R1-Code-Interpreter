    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Image**\nThe image consists of two plots representing a sound over time.\n*   **Top Plot (Spectrogram):** This graph shows frequency on the y-axis and time on the x-axis. The brightness indicates the intensity of the sound at a given frequency and time. We see a strong, narrow horizontal band, which represents a pure tone of a constant frequency. In the middle of the plot, this tone is interrupted and replaced by a vertical band of diffuse color. This vertical band represents a burst of noise, which contains a wide range of frequencies. After the noise burst, the pure tone resumes.\n*   **Bottom Plot (Waveform):** This graph shows the amplitude of the sound wave on the y-axis against time on the x-axis. On the left, we see a regular, smooth sine wave, corresponding to the pure tone. In the middle, the waveform becomes irregular and chaotic, corresponding to the noise burst. On the right, the regular sine wave returns.\n\n**Conclusion from the image:** The physical stimulus presented is a pure tone that stops, is replaced by a short burst of noise, and then starts again. There is a clear discontinuity in the tone.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Textual Clues**\nThe question provides several important clues about the nature of the phenomenon:\n*   **It's an \"illusion\":** This means that the perception of the sound is different from the physical reality shown in the plots.\n*   **It's \"similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity\":** The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where a 2D drawing can be perceived as a 3D cube from two different perspectives. The brain actively constructs a 3D perception from the 2D data and can switch between the two stable interpretations. This clue suggests the auditory phenomenon also involves the brain actively constructing a coherent perception from ambiguous or incomplete sensory input.\n*   **It \"reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability\":** This indicates that the illusion demonstrates a fundamental mechanism of our auditory system that we use constantly in everyday life without realizing it. A key example of such a situation is understanding speech in a noisy environment.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Information and Identify the Illusion**\nWhen a person listens to the sound depicted in the image (tone -> noise -> tone), they typically do not perceive the tone as stopping. Instead, they experience an **auditory illusion** where the tone seems to continue seamlessly *through* the noise. The brain \"fills in\" the missing part of the tone, assuming it was merely obscured by the louder noise burst.\n\nThis perceptual \"filling-in\" or completion is the illusion. It fits the comparison to the Necker Cube because the brain resolves the ambiguity (did the tone stop, or was it just covered up?) in favor of continuity, actively constructing a complete auditory object from incomplete data.\n\n**Step 4: Name the Phenomenon**\nThis specific type of auditory completion is a well-studied phenomenon.\n*   The general principle is called the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**.\n*   A famous and powerful example of this, which perfectly matches the description of a \"common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability,\" is when the missing sound is part of speech. If a phoneme (a basic sound of speech, like /s/) in a word is replaced by a cough or static, listeners report hearing the complete word without the phoneme missing. The brain restores the phoneme. This specific application is known as the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**.\n\nGiven the clue about a \"common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability,\" which is critical for understanding speech in everyday noisy situations, the Phonemic Restoration Effect is the most fitting and specific name for the phenomenon being described.\n\n<<<Phonemic Restoration Effect>>>"
