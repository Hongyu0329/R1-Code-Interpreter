    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval from the provided graph.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph**\nThe graph is a raster plot, a common way to visualize the firing activity of multiple neurons over time.\n*   The **x-axis** represents Time, measured in seconds (s). The scale runs from 0 to 50 seconds.\n*   The **y-axis** represents the Electrode Number, from 0 to 128. Each horizontal line corresponds to a different recording electrode, which detects the activity of one or more nearby neurons.\n*   Each **black dot** represents an action potential, or \"firing,\" detected by a specific electrode at a specific time.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts**\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a period where a large number of electrodes show high firing activity simultaneously. In the plot, these appear as dense, vertical bands of black dots. We need to identify the time at which each of these bursts occurs.\n\nBy visual inspection, we can identify four major synchronized bursts in the 50-second recording period. We will estimate the time corresponding to the center of each burst.\n\n*   **Burst 1:** Occurs early in the recording. The densest part of this burst is centered at approximately **t₁ = 2.5 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The next clear, dense burst is centered at approximately **t₂ = 17 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** A very prominent burst is visible, centered at approximately **t₃ = 36 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** The last major burst is centered near the end of the recording, at approximately **t₄ = 48 s**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time elapsed between two consecutive bursts. We can calculate three such intervals from the four identified bursts.\n\n*   **IBI₁ (Interval between Burst 1 and Burst 2):**\n    IBI₁ = t₂ - t₁ = 17 s - 2.5 s = **14.5 s**\n\n*   **IBI₂ (Interval between Burst 2 and Burst 3):**\n    IBI₂ = t₃ - t₂ = 36 s - 17 s = **19 s**\n\n*   **IBI₃ (Interval between Burst 3 and Burst 4):**\n    IBI₃ = t₄ - t₃ = 48 s - 36 s = **12 s**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual IBIs and divide by the number of intervals.\n\n*   Sum of IBIs = 14.5 s + 19 s + 12 s = 45.5 s\n*   Number of intervals = 3\n*   Average IBI = (Sum of IBIs) / (Number of intervals) = 45.5 s / 3 ≈ 15.167 s\n\n**Step 5: Round to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question requires the final answer to be given to two significant figures.\n\n*   The calculated average is 15.167... s.\n*   The first two significant figures are 1 and 5.\n*   The third digit is 1, which is less than 5, so we round down (i.e., we do not change the last significant digit).\n*   The final answer is **15 s**.\n\n<<<15>>>"
