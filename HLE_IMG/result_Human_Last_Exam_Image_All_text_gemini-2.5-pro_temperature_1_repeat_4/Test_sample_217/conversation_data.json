    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Image.**\n    The image provided is a drawing of an early cuneiform sign. It has a distinct pictographic quality, meaning it looks like a picture of a real-world object. The sign consists of a rectangular base with internal lines and a triangular top structure, resembling a building with a roof.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the Context.**\n    The question asks for the meaning of the sign in its \"third-millennium form.\" The third millennium BC (3000-2001 BC) includes the Early Dynastic, Akkadian, and Ur III periods in Mesopotamia. During this time, cuneiform writing evolved from purely pictographic forms to more abstract wedge-based characters, but many signs still retained their original pictorial meaning. The form shown is typical of the Early Dynastic period (c. 2900-2350 BC).\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the Cuneiform Sign.**\n    The sign depicted is a well-known archaic Sumerian logogram. By its appearance, it is a representation of a structure. This specific sign is the pictograph for the Sumerian word **Ã‰**.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the Meaning of the Sign.**\n    The Sumerian word **Ã‰** translates to \"house,\" \"temple,\" \"household,\" or more generally, \"building.\" The pictograph itself is a schematic drawing of a house or reed hut, with the rectangle representing the floor plan and the triangular part representing the roof. Therefore, the meaning of the sign is directly related to a dwelling or building.\n\n*   **Step 5: Evaluate the Answer Choices.**\n    *   A. Tool: Signs for tools (e.g., a plow, APIN) had different appearances.\n    *   B. Guard: The sign for \"guard\" is different. This sign depicts a place, not a person or profession.\n    *   C. Bread: The sign for \"bread\" (NINDA) typically looked like a bowl or a loaf.\n    *   D. Home: This matches the meaning of the Sumerian sign **Ã‰**, which this pictograph represents. The image is clearly a depiction of a house or home.\n    *   E. Deity: The sign for \"deity\" (DINGIR) was a star-like symbol (ð’€­).\n    *   F. Beard: The sign for \"beard\" (SU) was usually part of a composite sign representing a human head with a beard.\n\n*   **Step 6: Conclude the Analysis.**\n    Based on the visual evidence and knowledge of Sumerian cuneiform, the sign is the pictograph **Ã‰**, meaning \"house\" or \"home.\" Therefore, \"Home\" is the correct answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
