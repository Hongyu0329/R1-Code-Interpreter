    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which image represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the FCC Crystal Structure\nA face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice has atoms at each of the 8 corners of a cube and at the center of each of the 6 faces. The basis atoms in a conventional unit cell (with lattice constant 'a') can be represented by coordinates:\n- Corner atoms: (0, 0, 0)\n- Face-centered atoms: (1/2, 1/2, 0), (1/2, 0, 1/2), (0, 1/2, 1/2)\nAll other atoms in the lattice can be generated by adding integer lattice vectors to these basis atoms.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the [110] Viewing Direction\nViewing a crystal structure along a specific direction, like [110], means projecting the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to this direction. The [110] vector points along a face diagonal of the cubic unit cell. The planes perpendicular to this direction are the {110} family of planes.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Projected Pattern for FCC along [110]\n1.  **Identify atomic planes:** We need to consider the layers of atoms stacked along the [110] direction. These layers correspond to the (110) crystallographic planes. The position of these planes is defined by the equation `h*x + k*y + l*z = C`, which for the (110) plane is `x + y = C`.\n2.  **Determine the stacking sequence:** In an FCC lattice, atoms are located on these (110) planes. The planes are not equally spaced. The stacking sequence along the [110] direction is an alternating ABAB... sequence.\n    *   **Layer A:** Consists of atoms from planes where `x+y` is an even integer (e.g., 0, 2, 4...). When projected, these atoms form a simple rectangular grid. The rectangle has dimensions of `a` along the [001] direction and `aâˆš2` along the [1 -1 0] direction.\n    *   **Layer B:** Consists of atoms from planes where `x+y` is an odd integer (e.g., 1, 3, 5...). When projected, these atoms also form a rectangular grid identical to that of Layer A. However, this grid is shifted relative to Layer A.\n3.  **Superimpose the layers:** The projected view is the superposition of Layer A and Layer B. The shift of Layer B relative to Layer A is such that the atoms of Layer B are located exactly in the center of the rectangles formed by the atoms of Layer A.\n4.  **Final Pattern:** The resulting 2D projection is a **centered rectangular lattice**. The characteristic repeating unit is a rectangle with atoms at its four corners and one atom in the exact center.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Given Images\nNow we must examine each image to see which one displays a centered rectangular pattern.\n\n*   **Image A:** This image shows atoms forming a rectangular grid. Let's define a rectangle by the four outermost atoms. There are no atoms at the center of this rectangle. Instead, there are atoms in the middle of the two vertical sides. This is a side-centered (or base-centered) rectangular pattern, not a body-centered one. So, A is incorrect.\n*   **Image C:** This image clearly shows a hexagonal arrangement of atoms. For example, there is a central atom surrounded by six other atoms in a hexagon. This pattern is characteristic of an FCC structure viewed along the [111] direction. So, C is incorrect.\n*   **Image D:** This image shows two interpenetrating rectangular grids that are offset from each other. If you take any rectangle formed by atoms of one grid, there is no atom at its center. This pattern is characteristic of a simple cubic (SC) lattice where two different types of atoms alternate (like in NaCl), or two offset identical SC lattices. It is not a centered rectangular lattice. So, D is incorrect.\n*   **Image B:** Let's look for a centered rectangle in this pattern.\n    *   Identify a rectangle formed by four atoms. For instance, there appear to be atoms at approximate coordinates (2.5, 4), (5.5, 4), (2.5, 7), and (5.5, 7). These four points form a rectangle.\n    *   Calculate the center of this rectangle: The x-coordinate is (2.5 + 5.5) / 2 = 4. The y-coordinate is (4 + 7) / 2 = 5.5.\n    *   Check if there is an atom at the center position (4, 5.5). Yes, the image shows an atom at this exact location.\n    *   This confirms that Image B contains the characteristic centered rectangular pattern. The other atoms in the image belong to adjacent repeating units of this pattern. The different sizes of the circles represent atoms from the different layers (A and B) which are at different depths along the viewing direction.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy elimination and direct identification, Image B is the only one that shows the centered rectangular lattice pattern, which is the correct projection of an FCC structure when viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<B>>>"
