The product A is the hexahydroxy derivative of the starting cationic compound. The reaction involves the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the three cyclic acetal-like functional groups (represented unconventionally as O= =O) into three pairs of adjacent hydroxyl (-OH) groups on the peripheral benzene rings. The core fused aromatic cation structure remains intact. The structure of compound A is as follows:
