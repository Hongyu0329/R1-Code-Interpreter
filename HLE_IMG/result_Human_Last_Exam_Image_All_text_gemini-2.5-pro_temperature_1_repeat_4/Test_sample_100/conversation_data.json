    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the starting material and its molecular formula.**\n\nThe starting material is a complex bicyclic molecule. Let's identify its key features to determine its structure and formula.\n*   The core structure is a bicyclic system. Based on the connectivity shown, it is a 7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.\n    *   The bridgeheads are the two carbons where the rings fuse.\n    *   There are three bridges connecting the bridgeheads: one containing a C=C double bond, one containing a C=O group, and one containing a nitrogen atom.\n*   Let's check the alternative possibility of it being a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative, which would be a lactam. This structure is more consistent with the final reaction step (amide hydrolysis). Let's assume this structure: 2-(p-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n*   Let's calculate its molecular formula.\n    *   **Carbon (C):** The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core has 6 carbons. The trifluoromethyl (CF3) group adds 1 carbon. The p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group (-CH2-C6H4-OCH3) has 1(CH2) + 6(ring) + 1(OCH3) = 8 carbons. Total C = 6 + 1 + 8 = 15.\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** Let's count the hydrogens on the bicyclic core: C1 (bridgehead, CH), C4 (bridgehead, CH), C6 (alkene, CH), C7 (bridge, CH2). This gives 1+1+1+2 = 5 hydrogens. The PMB group has 2(CH2) + 4(ring) + 3(OCH3) = 9 hydrogens. Total H = 5 + 9 = 14.\n    *   **Fluorine (F):** The CF3 group has 3 fluorine atoms.\n    *   **Nitrogen (N):** There is one nitrogen atom in the ring.\n    *   **Oxygen (O):** There is one oxygen in the carbonyl group (C=O) and one in the methoxy group (-OCH3) of the PMB. Total O = 2.\n*   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n    *(Note: Even if the structure was the 7-aza isomer, the molecular formula would be the same, so this calculation is robust).*\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first reaction to form Intermediate 1.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Reaction:** CAN is a common reagent for the oxidative cleavage of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting groups from nitrogen or oxygen atoms. The PMB group is removed from the nitrogen atom and replaced with a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Formula change:** We remove the PMB group (C8H9O) and add one hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Change in C: -8\n    *   Change in H: -9 + 1 = -8\n    *   Change in F: 0\n    *   Change in N: 0\n    *   Change in O: -1\n*   **Molecular formula of Intermediate 1:** C(15-8) H(14-8) F3 N(1) O(2-1) = **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second reaction to form Intermediate 2.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 in MeOH.\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. The palladium on carbon catalyst with hydrogen gas will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) to a single bond (C-C). The lactam carbonyl group (C=O) is stable under these conditions.\n*   **Formula change:** Two hydrogen atoms are added across the double bond.\n    *   Change in C: 0\n    *   Change in H: +2\n    *   Change in F: 0\n    *   Change in N: 0\n    *   Change in O: 0\n*   **Molecular formula of Intermediate 2:** C7 H(6+2) F3 N O = **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the third reaction to form the final Product.**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n*   **Reaction:** These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide. Intermediate 2 is a bicyclic lactam (a cyclic amide). The hydrolysis reaction cleaves the amide bond by adding a molecule of water (H2O). This opens the bicyclic ring system to form an amino acid.\n*   **Formula change:** One molecule of water (H2O) is added to the molecule.\n    *   Change in C: 0\n    *   Change in H: +2\n    *   Change in F: 0\n    *   Change in N: 0\n    *   Change in O: +1\n*   **Molecular formula of the final Product:** C7 H(8+2) F3 N O(1+1) = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\nThe final product is a substituted cyclopentane containing a carboxylic acid group, an amino group, and a trifluoromethyl group. Its molecular formula is C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
