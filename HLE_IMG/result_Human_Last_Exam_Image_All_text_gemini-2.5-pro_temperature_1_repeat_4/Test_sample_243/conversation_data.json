    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to answer the question.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the key features of the plant in the image.**\nThe plant shown in the image has several distinct characteristics:\n*   **Leaves:** The leaves are dark green, simple, and have an elliptical or ovate-lanceolate shape.\n*   **Venation:** The most prominent feature is the striking pattern on the leaves. There is a network of fine veins (reticulation) that are colored white or a very pale green, contrasting sharply with the dark green leaf blade. This creates a net-like or mosaic appearance.\n*   **Arrangement:** The leaves appear to be arranged in whorls or clusters around the stem.\n*   **Stem:** The petioles (leaf stalks) and young stems seem to have a purplish or reddish tint.\n*   **Habit:** The plant appears to be a woody shrub.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the plant based on its features.**\nThe unique reticulated venation is a strong diagnostic feature. This pattern is characteristic of certain species within the genus *Helwingia*. While several species exist, this particular look is strongly associated with *Helwingia taiwaniana*. This species is highly prized in horticulture for its beautiful foliage. Other plants like some *Fittonia* or *Daphniphyllum* can have prominent veins, but the specific combination of leaf shape, shrubby habit, and the exact style of reticulation in the image strongly points to *Helwingia taiwaniana*.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the native range and endemism of the identified plant.**\nThe botanical name *Helwingia taiwaniana* itself provides a major clue. The specific epithet \"taiwaniana\" means \"from Taiwan\". Botanical records and horticultural resources confirm that this species is endemic to the island of Taiwan. An endemic species is one that is found exclusively in a specific geographic area.\n\n**Step 4: Answer the question.**\nThe question asks for the name of the island to which this plant is endemic. Based on the identification of the plant as *Helwingia taiwaniana*, the island is Taiwan.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It's important not to confuse this plant with the more common \"nerve plant\" (*Fittonia*), which is a small, tropical houseplant with a different growth habit.\n*   While other *Helwingia* species exist (e.g., *H. japonica* from Japan, *H. chinensis* from China), the prominent and delicate white net-like venation is particularly characteristic of *H. taiwaniana*.\n*   The question specifically asks for an \"island,\" which helps to narrow down the possibilities among related species from mainland Asia versus those from islands like Japan or Taiwan. The visual evidence strongly supports the Taiwanese species.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the plant and its island of origin.\n\n<<<Taiwan>>>"
