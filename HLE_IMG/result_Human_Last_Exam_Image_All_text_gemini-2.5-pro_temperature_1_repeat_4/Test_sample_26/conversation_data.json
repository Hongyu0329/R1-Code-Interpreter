    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step 1: Locate Measure 30**\nFirst, we need to find the correct measure in the provided musical score. The page shown starts with measure 20. The second system (line of music) begins with measure 28. Counting from there, the third measure in that system is measure 30.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Key Signature**\nThe key signature shown has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). This indicates the key of C minor (or its relative major, E♭ major). The first movement of the \"Pathetique\" sonata is in C minor, so we will conduct our analysis within this key.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Notes in Measure 30**\nNext, we must identify all the notes being played in measure 30 across both staves.\n*   **Treble Clef (Right Hand):** The notes played are G♯, B (natural), D (natural), and F (natural). Note that the accidentals (sharp and naturals) override the key signature for these notes.\n*   **Bass Clef (Left Hand):** The notes played are an E octave (E in two different octaves).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Harmony**\nNow, we combine the notes from both hands to identify the complete chord.\n*   The notes present are: **E - G♯ - B - D - F**.\n*   The lowest note, E, is in the bass, suggesting it might be the root of the chord.\n*   Let's build a chord on E using these notes:\n    *   **E** (Root)\n    *   **G♯** (Major Third)\n    *   **B** (Perfect Fifth)\n    *   **D** (Minor Seventh)\n    *   **F** (Minor Ninth)\n*   These notes perfectly form an **E dominant seventh chord with a minor ninth**, written as E7(♭9). The chord is in root position because E is the bass note.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Chord's Function and Roman Numeral**\nThe final step is to determine the function of this E7(♭9) chord within the key of C minor.\n*   A dominant seventh chord (like E7) typically resolves to a chord whose root is a perfect fifth below (or a perfect fourth above). The root of E7 is E, so it functions as the dominant of A.\n*   We need to determine what the \"A\" chord is in the key of C minor. The diatonic sixth scale degree in C minor is A♭, making the submediant chord A♭ major (VI).\n*   However, it is very common in minor keys to \"borrow\" chords from the parallel major key. The parallel major of C minor is C major. The submediant chord (the chord on the sixth degree) in C major is A minor. This is represented by the Roman numeral **vi**.\n*   Therefore, the E7 chord is functioning as the **secondary dominant** of A minor. It is the \"dominant of the submediant\" (V of vi).\n*   To write the full Roman numeral:\n    *   **V** represents the dominant function.\n    *   The subscript **₉** indicates it's a ninth chord.\n    *   The slash \"**/**\" followed by \"**vi**\" indicates that it is the dominant of the submediant chord (borrowed from the parallel major).\n\nThe chord in measure 30 is a secondary dominant, specifically the dominant ninth of the submediant of the parallel major.\n\n<<<V₉/vi>>>"
