    # Step 1: Define the core physical principle.
    # Poisson's ratio in cellular solids (like honeycombs) is highly dependent on the
    # geometry of the unit cell.
    # - Convex cell shapes (e.g., regular hexagons) lead to positive Poisson's ratios.
    # - Re-entrant (concave) cell shapes lead to low or negative Poisson's ratios.
    # A lower Poisson's ratio is associated with a more re-entrant geometry. The "lowest"
    # value would be the most negative one.

    # Step 2: Analyze the shapes presented in the image.
    # The image shows a spectrum of tile shapes based on the ratio (a, b).
    # The progression from right to left shows an increase in the "re-entrant"
    # nature of the tile.
    #
    # The list of tilings shown, from left to right:
    # (0, 1)     - Most re-entrant, arrowhead-like shape.
    # (1, 4)     - Highly re-entrant.
    # (1, sqrt(3)) - Re-entrant.
    # (1, 1)     - Less re-entrant, more compact.
    # (sqrt(3), 1) - Even less re-entrant.
    # (4, 1)     - Approaching convex.
    # (1, 0)     - Fully convex (a hexagon).

    # Step 3: Identify the candidate with the lowest Poisson's ratio.
    # The lowest Poisson's ratio will correspond to the most re-entrant geometry.
    # Following the visual trend in the diagram, the shape becomes most re-entrant
    # as 'a' approaches 0 and 'b' is non-zero.
    # This corresponds to the tiling at the far left of the spectrum.
