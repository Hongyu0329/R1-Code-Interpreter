# The equation is: @ = r_dot / (1 - s^2 +/- 2 * s_dot)
numbers_in_equation = [1, 2]

# Now, we determine the earliest possible year the equation could have been written.
# This is determined by the most recently introduced symbol in the equation.
# Most symbols like '=', 'Â±', and derivative notations are from the 16th-17th centuries.
# The defining symbol is '@', used here as a variable.

# While the '@' symbol has existed for centuries, its use in a formal scientific context
# is modern and tied to its inclusion on computer keyboards and standard character sets.
# The key event is its inclusion in the ASCII standard.
year_of_origin = 1963

# The question asks to round this year to the nearest 10 years.
# We can use round(number, -1) to round to the nearest multiple of 10.
rounded_year = int(round(year_of_origin, -1))
