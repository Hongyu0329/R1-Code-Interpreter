    "My plan to identify the protein is as follows:\n1.  I will first perform a reverse image search on the provided image to find its source. This will likely lead to an entry in a public protein structure database.\n2.  By examining the database entry, I will identify the name of the protein shown. The structure consists of a larger protein domain (in dark blue) and a smaller peptide ligand (in light blue). The question asks for the name of the protein.\n3.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the name of this protein?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
