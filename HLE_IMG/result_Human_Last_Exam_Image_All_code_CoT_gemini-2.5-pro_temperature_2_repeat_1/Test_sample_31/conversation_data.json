    "The knot displayed in the image is the `8_19` knot, also known as the true lover's knot. The Rasmussen invariant, denoted `s(K)` for a knot `K`, is an integer-valued invariant derived from Khovanov homology.\n\nFor an alternating knot like `8_19`, the Rasmussen invariant has a special relationship with another classical knot invariant, the knot signature `σ(K)`. The formula is:\n\n`s(K) = -σ(K)`\n\nThe signature of the `8_19` knot is a known value in knot theory tables: `σ(8_19) = -2`.\n\nUsing this information, we can calculate the Rasmussen invariant. The following Python script performs this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rasmussen_invariant_8_19():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Rasmussen invariant for the 8_19 knot.\n\n    The knot in the image is the 8_19 knot.
