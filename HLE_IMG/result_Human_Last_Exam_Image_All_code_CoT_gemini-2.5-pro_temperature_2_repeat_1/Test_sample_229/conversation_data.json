    "This is a handwritten lead sheet for the famous song \"Tico-Tico no Fub치\".\n\nHere is the breakdown of the identification:\n1.  **Title**: Although partially obscured and roughly handwritten at the top left, the text appears to be an abbreviation for \"Tico-Tico\". More importantly, the melody and structure are characteristic of this piece. The second section, in particular, features the song's signature long, chromatic descending line. \"Tico-Tico no Fub치\" (which translates to \"sparrow in the cornmeal\") is the full title.\n2.  **Musical Style**: The song's original genre is **Choro**, a vibrant and virtuosic Brazilian musical style that predates Samba and Bossa Nova. Because of its catchy melody and complex harmonies, it has become a standard performed by many musicians worldwide, particularly in **Jazz** and **Gypsy Jazz** styles. This specific arrangement, with its chord choices (e.g., C, E7, F, F#dim7) and syncopated 4/4 feel, is a jazz adaptation of the original Choro.\n3.  **Country of Origin**: The composer, Zequinha de Abreu, was from **Brazil**, where he wrote the piece in 1917.\n\n```python\ndef get_song_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about the song from the sheet music.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Tico-Tico no Fub치\"\n    musical_style = \"Choro / Jazz\"\n    country_of_origin = \"Brazil\"\n\n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Musical Style: {musical_style}\")\n    print(f\"Country of Origin: {country_of_origin}\")\n\nget_song_info()\n```\n<<<Title: Tico-Tico no Fub치, Musical Style: Choro / Jazz, Country of Origin: Brazil>>>"
