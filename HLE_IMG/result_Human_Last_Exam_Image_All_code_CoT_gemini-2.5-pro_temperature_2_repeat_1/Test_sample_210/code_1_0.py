    This function identifies the matching nyala based on unique features.
    
    1.  The Target nyala has a specific horn shape and a unique pattern of spots on its flank.
    2.  The key identifier is a cluster of three white spots behind the front leg, arranged in a small triangle, with one more spot slightly above and behind them.
    3.  Image A is a younger male.
    4.  Image B is similar but the angle makes a definite horn comparison difficult.
    5.  Image C has a different stripe pattern.
    6.  Image D has an identical horn shape and an identical, unique spot pattern to the Target.
    7.  Image E has a different spot pattern.
    8.  Image F is too obscured for a definitive comparison.
    
    Therefore, Image D shows the same nyala.
