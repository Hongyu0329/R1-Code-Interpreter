    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Identify the principal functional group and the main carbon chain** according to IUPAC nomenclature rules. This allows us to correctly number the carbon atoms.\n2.  **Identify all chiral centers** in the molecule.\n3.  **Interpret the 2D stereochemical drawing**. We will assume the most common convention where the main carbon backbone lies in a zig-zag pattern in the plane of the page. Substituents with wedged bonds point out of the page, and those with dashed bonds point into the page.\n4.  **Assign priorities** to the substituents on each chiral center using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules.\n5.  **Determine the (R) or (S) configuration** for each chiral center by observing the sequence of substituents from highest to lowest priority.\n\nThe Python script below will print out this detailed analysis.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef determine_absolute_configuration():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step process of determining the absolute\n    configuration of the molecule shown in the image.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the Main Chain and Chiral Centers\")\n    explanation1 = textwrap.dedent(\"\"\"\\\n        The molecule contains both an alcohol (-OH) and an amine (-NH2) group. According to IUPAC nomenclature rules, the alcohol has higher priority and defines the main chain and numbering. The longest carbon chain containing the C-OH group has five carbons. Numbering is started from the end closest to the -OH group.\n        \n        The correct IUPAC name is: 5-amino-3-ethyl-4-methylpentan-2-ol\n        \n        Based on this, we can identify three chiral centers (carbons with four different substituents) at positions 2, 3, and 4 of the pentane chain.\n        C1H3 - C2(OH) - C3(Et) - C4(Me) - C5H2NH2\n        \"\"\")\n    print(explanation1)\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Assign Priorities and Determine Configuration for Each Center\")\n    print(\"We will use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules to assign priorities (1=highest, 4=lowest) to the substituents on each chiral center.

This is a likely drawing error. We will proceed by interpreting the stereochemistry based on the standard convention for a backbone. The diagram shows the -OH group on a dash. This implies the implied H atom (the fourth substituent) must be on a wedge.\n        - Priorities (1=highest): 1: -OH, 2: -C3(...), 3: -C1(CH3), 4: -H\n        - Orientation: The lowest priority group (-H) is on a wedge (pointing towards the viewer).\n        - Path 1 -> 2 -> 3: This traces a Counter-Clockwise (S) path.\n        - Result: Since the lowest priority group points towards the viewer, we reverse the designation.\n        \"\"\")\n    print(explanation_c2)\n    print(\"Configuration at C2 is (R).\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Analysis of C3 ---\")\n    explanation_c3 = textwrap.dedent(\"\"\"\\\n        The drawing shows the Ethyl group (-CH2CH3) on a wedge. This implies the H atom is on a dash.\n        - Priorities (1=highest): 1: -C2(...), 2: -C4(...), 3: -Ethyl, 4: -H\n        - Orientation: The lowest priority group (-H) is on a dash (pointing away from the viewer).\n        - Path 1 -> 2 -> 3: This traces a Clockwise (R) path.\n        - Result: Since the lowest priority group points away from the viewer, we keep the designation.\n        \"\"\")\n    print(explanation_c3)\n    print(\"Configuration at C3 is (R).\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Analysis of C4 ---\")\n    explanation_c4 = textwrap.dedent(\"\"\"\\\n        The drawing shows the Methyl group (-CH3) on a dash. This implies the H atom is on a wedge.\n        - Priorities (1=highest): 1: -CH2NH2, 2: -C3(...), 3: -CH3, 4: -H\n        - Orientation: The lowest priority group (-H) is on a wedge (pointing towards the viewer).\n        - Path 1 -> 2 -> 3: This traces a Counter-Clockwise (S) path.\n        - Result: Since the lowest priority group points towards the viewer, we reverse the designation.\n        \"\"\")\n    print(explanation_c4)\n    print(\"Configuration at C4 is (R).\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Final Absolute Configuration\")\n    print(\"Combining the results for each chiral center, the absolute configuration is:\")\n    print(\"The configuration at carbon 2 is R.\")\n    print(\"The configuration at carbon 3 is R.\")\n    print(\"The configuration at carbon 4 is R.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer: (2R, 3R, 4R)\")\n\ndetermine_absolute_configuration()\n```\n<<<(2R, 3R, 4R)>>>"
