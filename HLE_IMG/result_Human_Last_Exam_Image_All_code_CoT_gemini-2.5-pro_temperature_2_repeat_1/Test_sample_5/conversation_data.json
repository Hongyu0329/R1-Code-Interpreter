    "This is a famous classical piano piece. Based on the key signature (4 sharps, C-sharp minor), the slow, ominous opening chords, and the iconic three-note motif, I can identify the music.\n\nHere are the key features that lead to the identification:\n1.  **Composer and Style:** The dense chords, dramatic dynamic shifts (from *piano* to *forte*), and rich, chromatic harmony are characteristic of the Russian Romantic composer Sergei Rachmaninoff.\n2.  **Key and Opening:** The piece is in C-sharp minor. It begins with three powerful, tolling chords that set a dark, brooding mood. This opening is one of the most famous in piano literature.\n3.  **Specific Melodic/Rhythmic Patterns:** The melody that starts in the latter half of the first measure (E, D#, C#, B#...) and the rhythmic figure in the left hand of measure 3 (triplet followed by two eighth notes) are highly distinctive features of this specific work.\n\nThe piece is the **Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op. 3, No. 2** by Sergei Rachmaninoff.\n\n<<<Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op. 3, No. 2 by Sergei Rachmaninoff>>>"
