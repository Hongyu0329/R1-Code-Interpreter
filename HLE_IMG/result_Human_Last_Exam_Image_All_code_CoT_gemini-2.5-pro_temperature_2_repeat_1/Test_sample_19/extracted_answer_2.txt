1. The music modulates to the key of C major. Measure 11 contains the dominant of this new key (G major), which resolves to the new tonic (C major) at the beginning of measure 12.
2. The home key is C# minor. Harmonically, the music sets up an expectation to modulate to the relative major key, E major. Instead, Beethoven creates a deceptive and dramatic shift by moving to C major, which functions as the flat-submediant (♭VI) of the expected key of E major. This relationship (resolving to ♭VI of the expected key) provides the justification for the seemingly distant modulation.
3. The chord in measure 11 is G major. It is the dominant (V) of the C major chord. Since C major is the flat-submediant (♭VI) of the relative major (III), the complete and accurate Roman numeral marking for the chord in measure 11 is V/♭VI/III.
