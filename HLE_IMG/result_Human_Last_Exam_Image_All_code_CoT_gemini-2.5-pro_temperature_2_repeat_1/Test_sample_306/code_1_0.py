    This script determines the eccentricity for each of the 9 plots and lists them
    in ascending order of eccentricity.

    The logic is based on the provided information and standard scientific visualization practices:
    1. There are 9 plots and 9 values for the parameter 'n' (0 to 8).
    2. The eccentricity 'e' is calculated as e = n / 20.
    3. It's assumed that the plots, numbered 1 to 9, are presented in order of the
       parameter 'n'. Therefore, Plot 'i' corresponds to n = i - 1.
    4. Based on this, the eccentricity for each plot is calculated.
    5. The plots are then sorted by their calculated eccentricity to find the correct order.
