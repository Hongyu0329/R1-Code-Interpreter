    Identifies the Higgs boson decay plots and prints the result.

    The identification is based on Standard Model physics principles:
    - Kinematic thresholds: Decays into heavy particle pairs (WW, ZZ, tt) only start when M_H is twice the particle mass.
    - Mass coupling: Higgs couples strongest to the heaviest particles.
    - Dominance: At low mass (< 130 GeV), H->bb is dominant. Above ~160 GeV, H->WW takes over.

    Decay Channel -> Reasoning -> Plot Number
    -----------------------------------------------------
    b b-bar         -> Dominant at low M_H                      -> 4
    τ τ-bar         -> Weaker than c c-bar (due to color factor) -> 6
    c c-bar         -> Stronger than τ τ-bar                    -> 7
    gg              -> Second most dominant at low M_H         -> 5
    γγ              -> Rarest decay, lowest BR                 -> 8
    W+W-            -> Opens at ~161 GeV, becomes dominant     -> 1
    ZZ              -> Opens at ~182 GeV, second dominant      -> 2
    t t-bar         -> Opens at highest mass, ~346 GeV         -> 3
