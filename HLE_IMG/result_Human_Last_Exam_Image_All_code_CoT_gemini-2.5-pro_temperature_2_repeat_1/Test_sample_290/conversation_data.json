    "Based on the visual evidence in the image, I can identify features that point to a specific region and park.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Visual Clues:** I'll examine the key features of the image: the type of trees (conifers), the body of water (resembling Puget Sound), the beach where bonfires are happening, and the sunset over the water.\n2.  **Hypothesize Location:** These clues strongly suggest the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. A specific popular park in Seattle, Golden Gardens Park, is well-known for allowing bonfires on the beach and matches the scenery.\n3.  **Construct a \"Symbolic\" Script:** Since identifying a location from an image is a visual task, I cannot write functional code to perform it directly. Instead, I will create a Python script that represents the \"deduction\" process. The prompt mentions the year the photo was taken (2022) and asks for an equation, so I will create a simple, illustrative equation using this number to fulfill the request.\n4.  **Final Output:** The script will print the steps of the \"equation\" and then the final answer, which is the city's name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_location_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function uses clues to identify the city where the image was taken.\n    The process is represented symbolically through a simple calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The year the image was taken is a key piece of information.\n    year_taken = 2022\n    \n    # Let's assign numeric values to our observations as part of a symbolic process.\n    # Clue 1: Pacific Northwest conifer trees and Puget Sound scenery.\n    pacific_northwest_id = 2000\n    # Clue 2: Bonfires on a public beach are a specific local feature.\n    bonfire_beach_id = 10\n    \n    # We will create a symbolic equation to represent combining these clues.\n    # This does not calculate the location but fulfills the prompt's request for an equation.\n    location_code = year_taken - pacific_northwest_id + bonfire_beach_id\n    \n    print(f\"Solving with symbolic equation using the year and clue IDs:\")\n    print(f\"{year_taken} - {pacific_northwest_id} + {bonfire_beach_id} = {location_code}\")\n    \n    # The analysis of the visual clues points to a specific city.\n    city = \"Seattle\"\n    \n    # Print the final result.\n    print(f\"\\nThe visual clues (bonfires on a beach, Puget Sound scenery) strongly point to Golden Gardens Park.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the image was taken in: {city}\")\n\nsolve_location_riddle()\n```\n<<<Seattle>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    This image was taken in 2022.
