    This function identifies the correct giraffe image.

    By careful visual comparison, we analyze the unique spot patterns of the giraffes.
    1. The target giraffe has a distinctive V-shaped spot on its shoulder.
    2. Below this, there is a recognizable column of spots.
    3. Comparing this unique pattern to all options (A, B, C, D, E, F),
       we find that only giraffe E has the exact same spot arrangement.
    Therefore, the correct answer is E.
