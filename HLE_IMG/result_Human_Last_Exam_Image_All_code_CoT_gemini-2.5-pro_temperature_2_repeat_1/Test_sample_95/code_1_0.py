# Step 1: Define the known parameters based on the AGI's information.
r_yellow = 0.5  # Radius of a yellow circle in cm.

# Step 2: Use geometric analysis and Pythagorean triples to find the radius of the white circle (R).
# The relationship between a white circle (R), a yellow circle (r), and their positions is:
# (R + r)^2 = R^2 + (y1 - r)^2
# where y1 is the y-coordinate of the center of the bottom row of white circles.
# (R + 0.5)^2 = R^2 + (y1 - 0.5)^2
# We look for a solution where R and y1 are multiples of 0.5.
# This corresponds to the scaled Pythagorean triple (2.5, 6, 6.5), which is 0.5 * (5, 12, 13).
# From this triple, we can deduce:
R_white = 6.0
y1 = 3.0
print(f"From geometric analysis, we find the radius of a white circle, R = {R_white} cm.")
print(f"The y-coordinate of the center of the bottom row of circles is y1 = {y1} cm.")

# Step 3: Determine the horizontal and vertical spacing of the white circle grid.
# The horizontal distance between centers (d_h) is twice the radius, as they are tangent.
d_h = 2 * R_white
print(f"The horizontal distance between the centers of white circles is d_h = 2 * R = {d_h} cm.")

# The short side of a green rectangle is R. If we assume the rectangle is a square, its height is also R.
# The height of the rectangle fills the gap between rows: R = d_v - 2*R.
# This gives the vertical distance between centers (d_v).
d_v = 3 * R_white
print(f"The vertical distance between the centers of white circles is d_v = 3 * R = {d_v} cm.")

# Step 4: Calculate the coordinates of the center of the right-most white circle.
# Let's find the coordinates for the circle in the middle row, right-most column (C_2,3).

# The x-coordinate of the first column of centers (x1).
# This is determined by the width of the left green rectangle (R) plus the radius of the circle (R).
x1 = R_white + R_white
print(f"The x-coordinate of the first column of centers is x1 = R + R = {x1} cm.")

# The x-coordinate of the third (right-most) column of centers (x3).
x3 = x1 + 2 * d_h
print(f"The x-coordinate of the right-most column is x3 = x1 + 2 * d_h = {x1} + 2 * {d_h} = {x3} cm.")

# The y-coordinate of the center of the middle row (y2).
y2 = y1 + d_v
print(f"The y-coordinate of the middle row is y2 = y1 + d_v = {y1} + {d_v} = {y2} cm.")

# The final answer is the coordinate of the center of this circle.
final_x = int(x3) if x3.is_integer() else x3
final_y = int(y2) if y2.is_integer() else y2
print(f"\nThe center of the right-most white circle (middle row) is at x:{final_x}, y:{final_y}.")
# The format should be x:y
final_answer = f"{final_x}:{final_y}"
