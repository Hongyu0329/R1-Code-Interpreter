def solve_graphene_simulation_puzzle():
    """
    Solves the puzzle by matching graphene band structure simulations to physical conditions
    based on a qualitative analysis of the provided plots.

    Analysis of Parameters and Plots:
    - Hopping 't' scales the bandwidth. Plot 2 has the minimum bandwidth.
    - Overlap sign 'sign(s)' determines asymmetry direction. Plots 1, 2, 3 show
      stretched valence bands (s<0). Plot 4 shows a stretched conduction band (s>0),
      making its sign unique.
    - Overlap magnitude '|s|' scales the asymmetry. Comparing plots 1 and 3,
      Plot 1 is extremely asymmetric (maximum |s|) while Plot 3 is the least
      asymmetric of the s<0 group (minimum |s|).
    - The condition "maximum s" is interpreted as maximum magnitude |s| to ensure
      four distinct, mutually exclusive conditions.
