    "To find the value of the current I, we will use nodal analysis. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Nodes and Voltages:**\n    *   The negative terminal of the 41 V battery is connected to ground, so the bottom wire is at 0 V.\n    *   The positive terminal is connected to the wire where the current `I` is indicated. Thus, this source wire (`V_S`) is at 41 V.\n    *   The circuit diagram shows a vertical wire on the far right connecting the top wire and the junction between resistors 14, 11, and 29 (let's call this Node B) to the ground line. This means the voltage at Node B is 0 V.\n    *   There is one node with an unknown voltage, which we will call Node A. This is the junction of resistors with values 76 Ω, 8 Ω, and 14 Ω.\n\n2.  **Apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL):**\n    We will write a KCL equation for the unknown Node A. The sum of currents leaving the node is zero:\n    (V_A - V_top) / 76 + (V_A - V_S) / 8 + (V_A - V_B) / 14 = 0\n    Substituting the known voltages (V_top = 0 V as the top wire is also grounded on the right, V_S = 41 V, V_B = 0 V):\n    V_A / 76 + (V_A - 41) / 8 + V_A / 14 = 0\n    We can solve this equation to find the voltage V_A.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Current `I`:**\n    The current `I` is the total current supplied by the voltage source. This current splits and flows into the rest of the circuit through resistors R8 and R29. Therefore, `I` is the sum of the currents through R8 and R29.\n    *   Current through R8: I_R8 = (V_S - V_A) / 8\n    *   Current through R29: I_R29 = (V_S - V_B) / 29\n    *   Total Current: I = I_R8 + I_R29\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final value of `I`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_circuit():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the circuit problem based on nodal analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the given values for voltage and resistances\n    V_S = 41  # Voltage of the source in Volts\n    R76 = 76  # Resistance in Ohms\n    R8 = 8    # Resistance in Ohms\n    R14 = 14  # Resistance in Ohms\n    R29 = 29  # Resistance in Ohms\n    V_B = 0   # Voltage at Node B is 0V (grounded)\n\n    # Step 1: Solve for the voltage at Node A (V_A) using KCL.\n    # The KCL equation at Node A is: V_A/R76 + (V_A - V_S)/R8 + (V_A - V_B)/R14 = 0\n    # Rearranging to solve for V_A: V_A * (1/R76 + 1/R8 + 1/R14) = V_S/R8 + V_B/R14\n    # Since V_B = 0, the equation simplifies.\n    \n    term_vs_r8 = V_S / R8\n    coeff_va = (1/R76) + (1/R8) + (1/R14)\n    V_A = term_vs_r8 / coeff_va\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the currents flowing from the source.\n    # The total current I is the sum of the currents through R8 and R29.\n    I_R8 = (V_S - V_A) / R8\n    I_R29 = (V_S - V_B) / R29\n    \n    I_total = I_R8 + I_R29\n\n    # Step 3: Print the final equation with all the numerical values.\n    print(f\"The equation for the total current I is: I = (V_S - V_A) / R8 + (V_S - V_B) / R29\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate calculation for V_A: {V_A:.2f} V\")\n    print(\"Plugging in the values:\")\n    print(f\"I = ({V_S} - {V_A:.2f}) / {R8} + ({V_S} - {V_B}) / {R29}\")\n    print(f\"I = {I_R8:.2f} A + {I_R29:.2f} A\")\n    print(f\"I = {I_total:.2f} A\")\n\nsolve_circuit()\n```\n<<<3.04>>>"
