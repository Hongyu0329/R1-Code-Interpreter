    "Based on my analysis of the image, the distinctive wavy building is a key landmark.\n\n1.  **Identify Key Features**: The most prominent building has a unique, undulating glass facade. This is a very specific architectural feature. Other buildings are more generic modern skyscrapers.\n2.  **Search for the Landmark**: A search for \"skyscraper with wavy glass facade\" or similar terms quickly leads to images of the GT Tower East in Seoul, South Korea.\n3.  **Confirm the Location**: Comparing the image with other photographs of the GT Tower East and its surroundings in the Gangnam or Seocho districts of Seoul confirms the match. The adjacent buildings visible in the photo are consistent with those found in that area.\n4.  **Final Answer Formulation**: The city is identified as Seoul. I will now provide a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef get_city_from_image():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the city from the provided image.\n  The analysis is based on a distinctive landmark building.\n\n  The building with the wavy facade is the GT Tower East,\n  located in Seoul, South Korea.\n  \"\"\"\n  city = \"Seoul\"\n  print(f\"The city in the image is: {city}\")\n\nget_city_from_image()\n```\n<<<Seoul>>>"
