    "To determine the time signature of the musical measure, we need to count the total duration of the notes within it. The time signature tells us two things: the top number indicates how many beats are in a measure, and the bottom number indicates what type of note gets one beat. We will analyze the notes in the top staff (right hand).\n\nLet's break down the measure beat by beat. In this piece, the rhythm is grouped into four main beats.\n\n1.  **Beat 1:** An eighth-note chord followed by four 32nd notes.\n    *   An eighth note has a duration of 1/8.\n    *   Four 32nd notes have a combined duration of `4 * (1/32) = 4/32 = 1/8`.\n    *   Total duration of Beat 1 = `1/8 + 1/8 = 2/8 = 1/4`. This is equivalent to one quarter note.\n\n2.  **Beat 2:** Four 32nd notes followed by two 16th notes.\n    *   Four 32nd notes have a duration of `4 * (1/32) = 1/8`.\n    *   Two 16th notes have a duration of `2 * (1/16) = 2/16 = 1/8`.\n    *   Total duration of Beat 2 = `1/8 + 1/8 = 2/8 = 1/4`. This is equivalent to one quarter note.\n\n3.  **Beat 3:** Four 16th notes.\n    *   Four 16th notes have a duration of `4 * (1/16) = 4/16 = 1/4`. This is equivalent to one quarter note.\n\n4.  **Beat 4:** Four 16th notes.\n    *   Four 16th notes have a duration of `4 * (1/16) = 4/16 = 1/4`. This is equivalent to one quarter note.\n\nNow, let's sum the durations of all four beats to find the total duration of the measure:\nTotal Duration = (Beat 1) + (Beat 2) + (Beat 3) + (Beat 4)\nTotal Duration = `1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 4/4`\n\nThe measure contains a total duration equivalent to four quarter notes. Therefore, the time signature is 4/4.\n\n```python\n# Define note durations relative to a whole note (where a whole note = 1)\nquarter_note = 1/4\neighth_note = 1/8\nsixteenth_note = 1/16\nthirty_second_note = 1/32\n\n# --- Analysis of the Right Hand (Top Staff) ---\n\n# Beat 1 consists of one eighth note and four 32nd notes.\nbeat_1_duration = eighth_note + (4 * thirty_second_note)\n\n# Beat 2 consists of four 32nd notes and two 16th notes.\nbeat_2_duration = (4 * thirty_second_note) + (2 * sixteenth_note)\n\n# Beat 3 consists of four 16th notes.\nbeat_3_duration = 4 * sixteenth_note\n\n# Beat 4 consists of four 16th notes.\nbeat_4_duration = 4 * sixteenth_note\n\n# Calculate the total duration of the measure by summing the beats.\ntotal_duration = beat_1_duration + beat_2_duration + beat_3_duration + beat_4_duration\n\n# The numerator of the time signature is the number of beat units in the measure.\n# The denominator tells us the beat unit is a quarter note (4).\n# A total_duration of 1.0 represents a full measure of 4/4 time.\n\nprint(\"Let's calculate the total duration of the measure to find the time signature.\")\nprint(\"The measure can be broken down into four main beats.\")\nprint(f\"Beat 1: 1 eighth note (1/8) + 4 thirty-second notes (4/32) = {eighth_note:.3f} + {4*thirty_second_note:.3f} = {beat_1_duration:.3f}\")\nprint(f\"Beat 2: 4 thirty-second notes (4/32) + 2 sixteenth notes (2/16) = {4*thirty_second_note:.3f} + {2*sixteenth_note:.3f} = {beat_2_duration:.3f}\")\nprint(f\"Beat 3: 4 sixteenth notes (4/16) = {4*sixteenth_note:.3f} = {beat_3_duration:.3f}\")\nprint(f\"Beat 4: 4 sixteenth notes (4/16) = {4*sixteenth_note:.3f} = {beat_4_duration:.3f}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(\"Total duration calculation (in terms of quarter notes):\")\nprint(f\"{beat_1_duration:.2f} + {beat_2_duration:.2f} + {beat_3_duration:.2f} + {beat_4_duration:.2f} = {total_duration:.2f}\")\nprint(\"This corresponds to 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note + 1 quarter note.\")\nprint(\"The sum is 4 quarter notes.\")\nprint(\"Therefore, the time signature is 4/4.\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
