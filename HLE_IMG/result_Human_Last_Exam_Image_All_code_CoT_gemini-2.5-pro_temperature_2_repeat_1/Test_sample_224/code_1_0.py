# The Petersen graph has a known number of non-isomorphic cycle double covers,
# which can be categorized by the lengths of the cycles in the cover.

# Category 1: A single cover composed entirely of 5-cycles.
# There are 6 such cycles in this cover.
num_covers_type_1 = 1

# Category 2: A single cover composed of 5-cycles and 6-cycles.
# Specifically, three 5-cycles and three 6-cycles.
num_covers_type_2 = 1

# Category 3: Covers composed of 8-cycles and a 5-cycle.
# There are three distinct non-isomorphic covers of this type,
# each containing two 8-cycles and one 5-cycle.
num_covers_type_3 = 3

# The total number of non-isomorphic cycle double covers is the sum of
# the covers from these distinct categories.
total_non_isomorphic_covers = num_covers_type_1 + num_covers_type_2 + num_covers_type_3
