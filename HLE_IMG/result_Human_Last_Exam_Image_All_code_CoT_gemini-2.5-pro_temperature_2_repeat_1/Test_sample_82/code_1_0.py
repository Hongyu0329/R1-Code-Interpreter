# The intramolecular Heck reaction leads to the formation of a new ring and a new double bond.
# The problem asks to identify the location of the new double bond.
# From the analysis of the reaction mechanism:
# 1. Oxidative addition happens at the C9-Br bond.
# 2. Migratory insertion forms a new C5-C9 bond, placing the Palladium atom on C4.
# 3. Beta-hydride elimination occurs from a carbon adjacent to C4.
#    The adjacent carbons are C3 and C5. C5 has no hydrogens to eliminate.
#    Therefore, a hydrogen from C3 is eliminated.
# 4. This elimination creates a new double bond between C3 and C4.

carbon_atom_1 = 3
carbon_atom_2 = 4

# The question asks for the answer in the form of "CX and CY".
# We output the two carbon atom numbers involved in the new alkene.
