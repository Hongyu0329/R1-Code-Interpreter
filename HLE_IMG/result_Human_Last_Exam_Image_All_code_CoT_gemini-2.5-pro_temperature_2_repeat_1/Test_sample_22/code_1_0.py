def find_unknot_indices():
    """
    This function identifies which of the six provided knot diagrams are
    isotopic to the unknot.

    The analysis for each knot is as follows:
    - Knot 1: A complex 10-crossing knot (Perko pair), which is not the unknot.
    - Knot 2: An elaborately drawn diagram that can be untangled into a simple loop. It is the unknot.
    - Knot 3: A common 4-crossing representation of the unknot.
    - Knot 4: The figure-eight knot (4_1), a non-trivial knot.
    - Knot 5: A diagram with removable 'hooks'. Untangling these reveals a simple loop. It is the unknot.
    - Knot 6: The cinquefoil knot (5_1), a non-trivial knot.

    Based on this, knots 2, 3, and 5 are isotopic to the unknot.
