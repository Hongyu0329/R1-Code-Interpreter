    This function solves the visual identification task.

    Steps:
    1.  The target sociable weaver image is analyzed for unique features.
        The most prominent features are the specific scalloped feather patterns on the back,
        the arrangement of the white-edged wing feathers, and the posture of the bird
        (seen from behind, head turned to its right).
    2.  Each option (A-I) is compared against these features.
    3.  Option C is identified as the correct match. The posture is identical,
        and the unique 'fingerprint' of the feather pattern on the back aligns
        perfectly with the target image.
