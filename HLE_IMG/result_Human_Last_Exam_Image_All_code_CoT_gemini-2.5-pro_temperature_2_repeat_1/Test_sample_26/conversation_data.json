    "Here is my plan to determine the correct Roman numeral for the chord in measure 30:\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Signature:** First, I'll examine the key signature at the beginning of the staff. It shows three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭), which indicates the key of C minor.\n2.  **Locate Measure 30:** I will find measure 30 in the sheet music. The measure numbers are provided, so I can see measure 28 is marked, making measure 30 the second measure on that line. The circled part highlights the relevant chord.\n3.  **Identify the Notes in the Chord:** I will read the notes in both the treble and bass clefs for the first beat of measure 30.\n    *   **Treble Clef (Right Hand):** The notes are G, B-natural, and D.\n    *   **Bass Clef (Left Hand):** The note is a G octave.\n4.  **Analyze the Harmony:** Combining the notes, the chord is comprised of G, B-natural, and D. This is a G major triad.\n5.  **Relate the Chord to the Key:** In the key of C minor, G is the fifth scale degree (the dominant). A major chord built on the dominant is standard practice in minor keys (using the raised 7th degree, B-natural, from the harmonic minor scale).\n6.  **Determine the Roman Numeral:** A major triad built on the fifth scale degree is represented by the uppercase Roman numeral V. Since the bass note is G (the root), the chord is in root position.\n\nI will now generate the Python code to explain this process and print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_chord():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the specified measure of Beethoven's Pathetique Sonata\n    to determine the Roman numeral of the chord.\n    \"\"\"\n    key_signature = \"C minor\"\n    key_tonic = \"C\"\n    \n    measure_number = 30\n    \n    # Notes identified in measure 30\n    notes_in_chord = [\"G\", \"B-natural\", \"D\"]\n    bass_note = \"G\"\n    \n    # Analysis\n    chord_root = \"G\"\n    chord_quality = \"Major\"\n    chord_name = f\"{chord_root} {chord_quality}\"\n    \n    # The scale degrees of C minor are:\n    # 1=C, 2=D, 3=Eb, 4=F, 5=G, 6=Ab, 7=Bb (natural minor)\n    # The harmonic minor raises the 7th to B-natural.\n    scale_degree_of_root = 5\n    roman_numeral_base = \"V\" # Uppercase for major quality\n    inversion = \"root position\"\n\n    print(f\"Step 1: The key signature is three flats, indicating the key of {key_signature}.\")\n    print(f\"Step 2: In measure {measure_number}, the notes played are {', '.join(notes_in_chord)}.\")\n    print(f\"Step 3: These notes form a {chord_name} triad.\")\n    print(f\"Step 4: The root of the chord is {chord_root}, which is the {scale_degree_of_root}th scale degree of {key_signature} (the dominant).\")\n    print(\"Step 5: In minor keys, the dominant chord is typically made major by raising the 7th scale degree (the leading tone).\")\n    print(f\"Step 6: A major chord on the 5th degree is represented by an uppercase Roman numeral. The bass note is {bass_note}, so the chord is in {inversion}.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the correct Roman numeral is:\")\n    print(roman_numeral_base)\n\nanalyze_chord()\n<<<V>>>\n```"
