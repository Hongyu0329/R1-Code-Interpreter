The S100B protein exhibits a strong affinity for the V (variable-type immunoglobulin) domain of the RAGE receptor. It could be used as a prognostic marker because its levels directly correlate with the activation of pathways leading to apoptosis, neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration, thereby predicting the progression and severity of the neurological disorder.
