    "Based on visual analysis of the mountain ranges and vegetation, the location in the image is identified as Jamul, an unincorporated community in San Diego County, California.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will retrieve the official elevation of Jamul from the U.S. Geological Survey's Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). According to the GNIS, the elevation of Jamul is 974 feet.\n2.  The question requires the elevation in meters. I will convert feet to meters using the conversion factor where 1 foot equals 0.3048 meters.\n3.  I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the full equation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_elevation_in_meters():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the elevation of Jamul, CA in meters based on its elevation in feet from GNIS.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The elevation of Jamul, California in feet, according to the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS Feature ID: 272449).\n    elevation_in_feet = 974\n\n    # The conversion factor from feet to meters.\n    feet_to_meters_conversion_factor = 0.3048\n\n    # Calculate the elevation in meters.\n    elevation_in_meters = elevation_in_feet * feet_to_meters_conversion_factor\n\n    # Print the equation as requested.\n    print(f\"The elevation of the unincorporated community is {elevation_in_feet} feet.\")\n    print(f\"To convert this to meters, we use the calculation:\")\n    print(f\"{elevation_in_feet} * {feet_to_meters_conversion_factor} = {elevation_in_meters}\")\n\ncalculate_elevation_in_meters()\n```\n<<<296.8752>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
