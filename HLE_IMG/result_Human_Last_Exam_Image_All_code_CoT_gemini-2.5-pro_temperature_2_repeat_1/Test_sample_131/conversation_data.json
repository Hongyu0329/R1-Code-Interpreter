    "The user wants me to identify the alkaloid compound shown in the image.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Analyze the chemical structure provided in the image.\n2.  The molecule is a tetracyclic (has four rings) compound containing two nitrogen atoms, which is characteristic of an alkaloid.\n3.  The specific ring system, which includes a quinolizidine core and a lactam (a cyclic amide, or in this case, a vinylogous amide/ketone structure within a piperidone ring), is distinctive.\n4.  By comparing this structure to known alkaloids, I can identify it. This structure is characteristic of the alkaloids found in plants of the *Sophora* genus.\n5.  The compound is (+)-Matrine. Its chemical formula is C₁₅H₂₄N₂O.\n6.  I will write a Python script that prints the name of the compound and its chemical formula to fulfill the user's request for a coding solution. The script will also explicitly print the numbers from the chemical formula.\n\n```python\ndef identify_alkaloid():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the alkaloid compound from the provided structure\n    and prints its name and chemical formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    compound_name = \"Matrine\"\n    # The chemical formula is C15H24N2O\n    atoms = {\n        \"Carbon\": 15,\n        \"Hydrogen\": 24,\n        \"Nitrogen\": 2,\n        \"Oxygen\": 1\n    }\n\n    print(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe chemical formula is C15H24N2O.\")\n    print(\"The count for each element is as follows:\")\n    \n    # Printing each number from the formula as requested\n    for element, count in atoms.items():\n        print(f\"- {element}: {count}\")\n\nidentify_alkaloid()\n```\n<<<Matrine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
