    "My plan is to solve this problem by identifying the characteristic atomic projection pattern for a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal when viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n1.  **Identify the theoretical pattern:** Based on crystallographic principles, the projection of an FCC lattice along the [110] direction results in a **centered rectangular** pattern. The unit cell of this 2D pattern is a rectangle with atoms at its four corners and one atom precisely in the center. The sides of this rectangle are related to the lattice constant `a` by the dimensions `a` and `a * sqrt(2)`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the given images:**\n    *   **Image A:** Shows a simple rectangular lattice (atoms only at the corners of repeating rectangular units). This does not match.\n    *   **Image B:** Shows a hexagonal arrangement of atoms. This is typical of an FCC [111] view, not [110].\n    *   **Image C:** Shows two interlocking rectangular lattices. This is characteristic of a body-centered cubic (BCC) [100] view.\n    *   **Image D:** Clearly shows a centered rectangular pattern. One can easily spot repeating units composed of four corner atoms forming a rectangle with one atom in the center.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Image D is the only one that matches the expected centered rectangular pattern for an FCC [110] view.\n\n4.  **Code generation:** I will write a Python script to programmatically describe this expected pattern. The script will calculate and print the coordinates of the five atoms (four corners and one center) that form a single unit of the centered rectangular pattern, thereby confirming the geometry that is visually present in Image D.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# A face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, when viewed along the [110] direction,\n# projects its atomic positions into a 2D pattern known as a centered rectangle.\n# This script calculates the coordinates of the atoms forming one unit of this pattern.\n\n# The unit cell of the projected pattern is a rectangle with atoms at the four corners\n# and one atom at the center. The side lengths of this rectangle are 'a' and 'a * sqrt(2)',\n# where 'a' is the lattice constant of the 3D FCC cell.\n\n# Let's set the lattice constant 'a' for our calculation.
