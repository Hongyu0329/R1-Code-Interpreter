def solve_vortex_puzzle():
    """
    Analyzes 16 vortex trajectory plots to identify the unique vortex.

    The analysis is based on the following principles of vortex dynamics:
    - A stronger vortex (twice the strength) has more influence. Its trajectory tends to be
      simpler and more central, acting as an anchor for the system. Designated by uppercase letters (R, G, B).
    - A weaker vortex (half the strength) is more easily influenced by others. Its trajectory
      is often more complex, with tighter loops and spirals. Designated by lowercase letters (r, g, b).

    The identification for each plot is as follows:
    1:  g (Green path is a tight spiral, weaker)
    2:  r (Red path has tight inner loops, weaker)
    3:  r (Chaotic, Red path is most tangled, weaker)
    4:  b (Blue path has tight loops, weaker)
    5:  B (Blue path is a large simple circle, stronger)
    6:  g (Green path is a tight spiral, weaker)
    7:  g (Chaotic, Green path is most tangled, weaker)
    8:  r (Red path has tight inner loops, weaker)
    9:  g (Green path is convoluted and loopy, weaker)
    10: r (Red path is a tight spiral, weaker)
    11: b (Chaotic, Blue path is most tangled, weaker)
    12: B (Blue path is a smooth central circle, stronger)
    13: G (Green path is a wide, simple sweep, stronger)
    14: b (Blue path is a complex spiral, weaker)
    15: r (Chaotic, Red path is most tangled, weaker)
    16: B (Blue path is a large simple circle, stronger)
