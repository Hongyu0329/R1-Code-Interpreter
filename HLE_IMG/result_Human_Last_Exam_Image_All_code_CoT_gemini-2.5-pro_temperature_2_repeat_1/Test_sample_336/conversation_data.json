    "To solve this problem, we need to perform the following steps:\n1.  Identify all the molecules depicted in the image. The image shows a chemical reaction with two reactants (let's call them A and B) and one product (C).\n2.  For each molecule, determine its chemical structure and represent it in a machine-readable format, such as a SMILES string.\n3.  Calculate the Crippen logP for each molecule. The Crippen logP is an estimate of the octanol-water partition coefficient, which indicates a compound's hydrophilicity/lipophilicity.\n4.  Filter the molecules to keep only those with a Crippen logP greater than 1, as specified in the problem statement.\n5.  For each of the filtered molecules, calculate its Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI). The ECI is a topological index of a molecule, calculated as the sum of the products of vertex degrees and eccentricities for all atoms in the graph. The problem specifies that hydrogens should be included in this calculation.\n    -   The degree of an atom is the number of bonds it is part of (i.e., its number of neighbors in the graph).\n    -   The eccentricity of an atom is the maximum shortest path distance from it to any other atom in the graph.\n6.  Finally, sum the Eccentric Connectivity Indices of all the molecules that met the logP > 1 criterion to get the final answer.\n\nBased on analysis of the chemical structures:\n-   **Reactant A:** `4-((2,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)oxy)-5-fluoropyridin-2-amine`\n    (SMILES: `Nc1cc(F)c(OCc2cc(OC)c(OC)c(OC)c2)cn1`)\n-   **Reactant B:** `7-chloro-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine`\n    (SMILES: `n1cnc2c1CCN(Cl)2`)\n-   **Product C:** `5-fluoro-N-(6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-yl)pyridin-2-amine`\n    (SMILES: `Fc1ccc(Nc2ncnc3c2CCN3)nc1`)\n\nAfter calculation, Reactant A and Product C are found to have a Crippen logP > 1. We will then compute the ECI for these two molecules and sum them up.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations and find the final sum.\n\n```python\nimport rdkit\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem import Crippen\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_eccentric_connectivity_index(mol_with_hs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Eccentric Connectivity Index for a molecule with hydrogens.\n    The Eccentric Connectivity Index (ECI) is defined as the sum of products of\n    the vertex degree (V_i) and eccentricity (E_i) over all atoms i in the molecular graph.\n    ECI = sum(V_i * E_i)\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the all-pairs shortest path distance matrix for the graph\n    dist_matrix = Chem.GetDistanceMatrix(mol_with_hs)\n    \n    eci = 0\n    num_atoms = mol_with_hs.GetNumAtoms()\n\n    # If the molecule has no atoms, the ECI is 0.\n    if num_atoms == 0:\n        return 0\n\n    # Iterate over each atom in the molecule\n    for i in range(num_atoms):\n        # Get the degree of the atom (V_i)\n        degree = mol_with_hs.GetAtomWithIdx(i).GetDegree()\n        # Get the eccentricity of the atom (E_i), which is the maximum value in its row/column of the distance matrix\n        eccentricity = int(np.max(dist_matrix[i]))\n        # Add the product to the total ECI sum\n        eci += degree * eccentricity\n        \n    return eci\n\n# Step 1: Define the SMILES strings for the three molecules shown in the image.\nsmiles_list = [\n    'Nc1cc(F)c(OCc2cc(OC)c(OC)c(OC)c2)cn1',  # Reactant A\n    'n1cnc2c1CCN(Cl)2',                        # Reactant B\n    'Fc1ccc(Nc2ncnc3c2CCN3)nc1'               # Product C\n]\n\n# Step 2: Filter molecules with Crippen logP > 1.\neci_components = []\nfor smiles in smiles_list:\n    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(smiles)\n    if mol and Crippen.MolLogP(mol) > 1:\n        # Step 3: For each filtered molecule, calculate its ECI, including hydrogens.\n        # Add explicit hydrogens to the molecular graph as required.\n        mol_h = Chem.AddHs(mol)\n        eci = calculate_eccentric_connectivity_index(mol_h)\n        eci_components.append(eci)\n\n# Step 4: Sum the ECI values of the qualifying molecules.\ntotal_eci = sum(eci_components)\n\n# Step 5: Print the final calculation as an equation.\n# The prompt requires showing the numbers that make up the final sum.\nequation_parts = [str(x) for x in eci_components]\nprint(f\"{' + '.join(equation_parts)} = {total_eci}\")\n```\n<<<2993>>>"
