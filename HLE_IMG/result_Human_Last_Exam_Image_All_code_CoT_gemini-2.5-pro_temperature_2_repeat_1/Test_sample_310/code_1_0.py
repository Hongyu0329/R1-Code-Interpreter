# Step 1: Define the parameters for the missing simulation.
# The initial degree of polymerization, N, is 20, as seen from the plots.
N = 20

# From analyzing the plots, we deduced that the missing plot corresponds to a
# linear polymer where the degradation parameter m = 3.
m = 3

# Step 2: Calculate the degree of destruction, a.
a = m / 25.0

# Step 3: Use the formula for the number-average degree of polymerization (Nn)
# for the random scission of linear polymers.
# The formula is: Nn = N / (1 + (N-1) * a)

# Perform the calculation step-by-step and print the equation.
numerator = N
denominator_part1 = 1
denominator_part2 = (N - 1) * a
denominator = denominator_part1 + denominator_part2

Nn = numerator / denominator
