    "The image displays a classic North Atlantic rocky intertidal community. Several species are visible, including barnacles, and at least two types of snail (gastropod).\n\n1.  **Identify Key Species:** The most identifiable organisms that can help distinguish between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts are the snails. The small, dark, conical snails visible in the image are characteristic of the common periwinkle.\n\n2.  **Determine Geographic Range:** The common periwinkle's scientific name is *Littorina littorea*. This species is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean (coasts of Europe) and was introduced to the northwestern Atlantic (North American east coast) in the 19th century, where it is now abundant. Critically, *Littorina littorea* is not established on the Pacific coast of North America.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The presence of *Littorina littorea* definitively indicates that the photo was taken on a shore of the Atlantic Ocean rather than the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe following Python code will print the scientific name of this indicator species.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function prints the scientific name of the species that indicates\n  the photo was taken on the Atlantic rather than Pacific Coast.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The key indicator species is the Common Periwinkle.\n  # Its scientific name is Littorina littorea.\n  # This species is widespread on the North Atlantic coasts (both Europe and North America)\n  # but is not found on the Pacific coast of North America.\n  scientific_name = \"Littorina littorea\"\n  print(scientific_name)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
