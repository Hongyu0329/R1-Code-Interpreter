    "My plan is to determine the time complexity of the given sorting algorithm by analyzing its structure.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Recurrence Relation**: I will examine the pseudocode to understand how the function calls itself. I'll identify the base case and the recursive step.\n2.  **Determine the Worst-Case Scenario**: The algorithm's runtime depends on the `if` condition. The worst case occurs when this condition is consistently true, leading to the maximum number of recursive calls. I will identify an input array that triggers this worst-case behavior.\n3.  **Formulate and Solve the Recurrence**: Based on the worst-case analysis, I will write a recurrence relation `T(n)` that describes the time complexity for an input of size `n`. Solving this recurrence relation will give the Big O complexity.\n4.  **Provide a Python Demonstration**: I will write a Python script that implements the algorithm and includes a counter. This script will run the algorithm on worst-case inputs of increasing size (`n`) and print the number of operations. This will empirically demonstrate the exponential growth predicted by the recurrence relation, confirming the analysis.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown of the complexity analysis:\n\n*   The function `sort(a, n)` has a base case `if n <= 1`, where it stops recursing. This takes constant time, `O(1)`.\n*   For `n > 1`, the function performs the following steps:\n    1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: A recursive call on the first `n-1` elements. Let its cost be `T(n-1)`.\n    2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: A comparison, which is a constant time operation, `O(1)`.\n    3.  `swap(...)`: A swap, also a constant time operation, `O(1)`.\n    4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: A second recursive call on the first `n-1` elements. This call only happens if the `if` condition is true.\n*   **Worst-Case**: The worst case happens when the `if` condition is met as often as possible. This triggers both recursive calls. An example of a worst-case input is a reverse-sorted array (e.g., `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`), because after sorting the first `n-1` elements, the `n-1`th element will almost always be smaller than the `n-2`th element, causing a swap and a second recursive call.\n*   **Recurrence Relation**: In the worst case, the total time `T(n)` can be described as:\n    `T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + O(1)`\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where c is a constant)\n*   **Solving the Recurrence**: This is a classic recurrence relation that resolves to an exponential complexity.\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    `= 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 3c`\n    `= 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 7c`\n    ...\n    `= 2^k * T(n - k) + (2^k - 1) * c`\n    When we reach the base case `n - k = 1`, `k = n - 1`.\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-1) - 1) * c`\n    Since `T(1)` is a constant, the entire expression is dominated by the `2^(n-1)` term.\n    Therefore, the time complexity is `O(2^n)`.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this exponential growth by counting the number of function calls.\n\n```python\n# Global counter to track the number of recursive calls\ncall_counter = 0\n\ndef swap(arr, i, j):\n    \"\"\"Helper function to swap two elements in a list.\"\"\"\n    arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n\ndef sort(a, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    The sorting algorithm from the problem, instrumented with a call counter.\n    \"\"\"\n    global call_counter\n    call_counter += 1\n\n    if n > 1:\n        # First recursive call\n        sort(a, n - 1)\n        \n        # In Python, arrays are 0-indexed, so we access elements\n        # at indices n-1 and n-2.\n        if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n            swap(a, n - 1, n - 2)\n            # Second recursive call (worst-case path)\n            sort(a, n - 1)\n\ndef analyze_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs the algorithm on worst-case inputs and prints the number of calls\n    to demonstrate the O(2^n) complexity.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Analysis of the Algorithm's Time Complexity ---\")\n    print(\"The worst-case recurrence relation is T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c.\")\n    print(\"This results in an exponential time complexity of O(2^n).\")\n    print(\"\\nDemonstration using a worst-case input (reverse-sorted array):\")\n    print(\"We will count the total number of calls to the sort function.\")\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 55)\n    print(f\"{'Input Size (n)':<15} | {'Theoretical Calls (2^n - 1)':<25} | {'Actual Calls':<15}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 55)\n    \n    global call_counter\n    for n in range(1, 16):\n        # Reset the counter for each run\n        call_counter = 0\n        \n        # A reverse-sorted list is a worst-case input\n        worst_case_array = list(range(n, 0, -1))\n        \n        # Run the algorithm\n        sort(worst_case_array, n)\n        \n        # The total number of calls in the worst case is 2^n - 1\n        expected_calls = 2**n - 1\n        \n        print(f\"{n:<15} | {expected_calls:<25} | {call_counter:<15}\")\n\n# Run the analysis\nanalyze_complexity()\n\n```\n<<<E>>>"
