    "This is a fascinating historical puzzle embedded in a data visualization. To solve this, I'll analyze the patterns of the spikes for each colored line on the Google Trends graph and correlate them with major annual or one-off events in a specific country.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Yellow Line:** This line has the most prominent and identifiable spikes. I will pinpoint the dates of its largest peaks, especially the one reaching 100 on the trend scale, and search for world events of massive public interest on those dates.\n2.  **Analyze the Red Line:** This line shows a clear, repeating annual pattern. I'll identify the time of year it spikes and look for a recurring major political event or anniversary in the country identified in step 1.\n3.  **Analyze the Blue Line:** This line shows smaller but also recurring spikes. I will check its timing against other annual historical commemorations in the same country.\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** By combining the evidence from all three lines, I will confirm the country and the three distinct historical events.\n5.  **Final Code:** I will write a Python script that explains this reasoning and prints the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step-analysis:**\n\n*   **Yellow Line Analysis:** The most dramatic spike hits the maximum value of 100 just before the \"May 28, 2023\" tick. This corresponds perfectly to the Coronation of King Charles III on May 6, 2023. Another very large spike occurs in September 2022, which aligns with the death of Queen Elizabeth II. These two events strongly point to the **United Kingdom**.\n*   **Red Line Analysis:** The red line spikes consistently at the turn of the new year (late December/early January). This timing matches crucial milestones in the **Brexit** timeline. The first spike in Jan 2020 coincides with the UK formally leaving the EU. The spike at the end of Dec 2020 matches when the Brexit trade deal was agreed upon. This political event is uniquely British.\n*   **Blue Line Analysis:** The blue line has smaller, recurring annual peaks. These spikes appear to happen in the autumn of each year, specifically around early November. This pattern is highly consistent with search interest for **Guy Fawkes Night** (or Bonfire Night) on November 5th, a historical commemoration unique to Great Britain.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe three distinct historic events — matters of the Royal Family (Yellow), the politics of Brexit (Red), and the commemoration of Guy Fawkes Night (Blue) — all converge on one country.\n\n```python\ndef solve_historical_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the Google Trends data to identify the country and the corresponding historical events.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Analysis based on the provided graph\n    country = \"United Kingdom\"\n    \n    # Event corresponding to the Yellow line: Major Royal Family events\n    # Peak 1: September 2022 -> Death of Queen Elizabeth II\n    # Peak 2: May 2023 -> Coronation of King Charles III\n    yellow_line_event = \"The British Royal Family (e.g., Queen's Death & King's Coronation)\"\n    \n    # Event corresponding to the Red line: Brexit\n    # Recurring spikes align with major Brexit milestones and anniversaries.\n    # Peak 1: Jan 2020 -> UK officially leaves the EU\n    # Peak 2: Dec 2020 -> UK-EU trade deal agreed\n    red_line_event = \"Brexit\"\n\n    # Event corresponding to the Blue line: Guy Fawkes Night\n    # Small, recurring annual spikes in early November.\n    blue_line_event = \"Guy Fawkes Night (Nov 5th)\"\n\n    print(\"Based on the analysis of the Google Trends graph, the country can be identified by correlating the spikes with major national events.\")\n    print(f\"1.
