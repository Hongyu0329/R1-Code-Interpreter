    "My plan is to first research the key characteristics of the sporophytes for both *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* using botanical knowledge sources. Then, I will identify the most prominent and easily visible difference that allows for quick identification \"at a glance\". Finally, I will present this information clearly within a Python script using a print statement, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef explain_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the main distinguishing feature between the sporophytes\n    of Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the characteristics for each species' sporophyte\n    grimmia_montana_sporophyte = {\n        \"Seta (stalk)\": \"Short and straight\",\n        \"Capsule Orientation\": \"Erect and typically immersed among the leaves\"\n    }\n\n    grimmia_curviseta_sporophyte = {\n        \"Seta (stalk)\": \"Distinctly curved, often S-shaped (cygneous)\",\n        \"Capsule Orientation\": \"Nodding or hanging (cernuous to pendent)\"\n    }\n\n    # Formulate the explanation based on the key difference\n    explanation = (\n        \"The main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta, \"\n        \"which helps distinguish them at a glance, is the shape of the seta (the stalk holding the capsule).\\n\\n\"\n        \"1. Grimmia montana: Has a short, straight seta. This causes its capsule to be erect (upright).\\n\\n\"\n        \"2. Grimmia curviseta: As its name implies ('curvi-seta' means curved stalk), it has a distinctly curved or S-shaped (cygneous) seta.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
