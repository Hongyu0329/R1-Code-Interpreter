    "This coin is a French Colonial 9 Deniers, minted in 1721-1722 during the reign of Louis XV.\n\nMy plan to identify the origin is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Obverse (left image):** I will identify the monarch depicted. The bust with a laurel wreath and the visible letters point towards King Louis XV of France. The inscription would be \"LUD . XV . D . G . FR . ET . NAV . REX\".\n2.  **Analyze the Reverse (right image):** I will examine the legend and central design, which are the keys to identifying the colony. The text \"COLONIES FRANCOISES\" is partially visible at the top. The central design is not three fleurs-de-lis, but two large, interlaced, back-to-back 'L's under a crown, which is the royal cypher for Louis XV.\n3.  **Synthesize and Identify:** Combining these features—a Louis XV 9 Deniers with the reverse legend \"COLONIES FRANCOISES\" and the interlaced 'L's—pinpoints a specific issue minted for the Company of the Indies. Historical sources confirm this issue was intended primarily for the vast territory of **French Louisiana**. Although these coins may have circulated in other parts of New France, their specific target was the Louisiana colony.\n\nI will now write a Python script to present this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef identify_coin_origin():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the origin of the French colonial coin based on its visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Key features identified from the coin's image:\n    # 1.
