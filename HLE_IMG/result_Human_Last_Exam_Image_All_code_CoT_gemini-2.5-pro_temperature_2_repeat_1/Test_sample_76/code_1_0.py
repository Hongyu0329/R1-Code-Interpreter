    Determines the four theoretically possible pairs of carbon atoms
    on the cubane product that can be substituted with a carboxylic acid group,
    based on the Favorskii rearrangement mechanism.
    
    The logic is as follows:
    1. The starting material has two Î±-haloketone moieties.
    2. The top moiety has a C=O bridging C2 and C6, with Br at C2. The Favorskii
       rearrangement can theoretically place the resulting -COOH group at either C2 or C6.
    3. The bottom moiety has a C=O bridging C7 and C8, with Br at C8. The rearrangement
       can theoretically place the resulting -COOH group at either C7 or C8.
    4. Combining these independent possibilities gives 2 * 2 = 4 potential products.
