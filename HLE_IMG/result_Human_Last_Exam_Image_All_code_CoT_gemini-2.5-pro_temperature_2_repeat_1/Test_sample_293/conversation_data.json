    "Based on the histopathological features visible in the provided image, here is my analysis and diagnosis.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the microscopic image:** I will identify the key structures and abnormalities present in the kidney tissue sample.\n2.  **Identify key pathological features:** The most prominent feature is a large, crescent-shaped proliferation of cells within Bowman's space, which surrounds and compresses the glomerular tuft. This is known as a \"cellular crescent\".\n3.  **Correlate features with a diagnosis:** The presence of extensive crescents is the defining characteristic of a specific type of glomerulonephritis.\n4.  **Formulate the diagnosis:** Based on the presence of a large cellular crescent, the diagnosis is Crescentic Glomerulonephritis.\n5.  **Generate Python code:** I will write a Python script that prints this analysis and the final diagnosis.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef provide_histopathology_diagnosis():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the histopathological features of the provided image and prints the diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    analysis = \"\"\"\n    Histopathological Analysis:\n    1. The image shows a renal glomerulus, which is a key filtering unit of the kidney.\n    2. The most striking abnormality is a large, crescent-shaped proliferation of cells occupying Bowman's space (the area surrounding the glomerular capillary tuft).\n    3. This 'crescent' is composed of parietal epithelial cells and infiltrating inflammatory cells.\n    4. The crescent is compressing the central glomerular tuft, which indicates severe glomerular injury.\n    5. This pathological finding is the hallmark of a condition characterized by rapid decline in renal function.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    diagnosis = \"Crescentic Glomerulonephritis\"\n\n    print(textwrap.dedent(analysis).strip())\n    print(\"\\nBased on these findings, the histopathological diagnosis is:\")\n    print(diagnosis)\n\nprovide_histopathology_diagnosis()\n```\n<<<Crescentic Glomerulonephritis>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the histopathological diagnosis of this image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
