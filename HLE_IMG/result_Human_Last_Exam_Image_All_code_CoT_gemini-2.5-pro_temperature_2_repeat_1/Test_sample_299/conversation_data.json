    "This chess puzzle is a \"mate in 2\" problem.\n\n### Plan to solve the puzzle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial Position**: First, I will carefully examine the positions of all pieces for both White and Black as shown in the image.\n    *   White: Queen on a4, Knights on b7 and e7, pawn on b4, Rooks on f3 and h5, King on h4, and Bishops on g1 and g2.\n    *   Black: Rook on c6, Queen on d5, pawns on e5 and f4, and King on e4.\n2.  **Identify the Core Feature of the Puzzle**: I'll notice that the Black King on e4 is already in check from the White Bishop on g2. However, the prompt states it's White's turn to move. This is an \"illegal\" position in a standard game but is a common feature in composed chess puzzles.\n3.  **Deduce Black's Forced Move**: Because of this setup, any \"quiet\" (non-checking) move by White will force Black to make their only legal move to get out of the existing check. The only escape square for the Black King on e4 is d3. Therefore, Black's response to any quiet move from White is `1... Kd3`.\n4.  **Formulate the Mating Strategy**: White's goal is to find a quiet first move (`1. W1`) that prepares a checkmate for the second move (`2. W2#`), knowing Black's king will be on d3.\n5.  **Analyze the King's Position after the Forced Move**: After `1... Kd3`, the Black king will be on d3. I'll identify its potential escape squares. The key weaknesses for White are the squares c2, d2, and e2, which are initially uncovered.\n6.  **Find the Key Moves**:\n    *   **The Mating Move (W2)**: I'll look for a move that can check the king on d3 and cover as many escape squares as possible. The move `2. Nf5+` is a strong candidate, as it checks the king and also covers the e2 square.\n    *   **The Setup Move (W1)**: With `2. Nf5#` as the goal, the remaining escape squares to cover are c2 and d2. White's first quiet move must control both of these squares. The move `1. Rc2` (moving the Rook from f3) accomplishes this perfectly: the rook on c2 blocks the c2 square and attacks the d2 square.\n7.  **Verify the Solution**: I will walk through the full sequence (`1. Rc2 Kd3 2. Nf5#`) and confirm that after the final move, the Black King is in check and has no legal moves.\n\nThis step-by-step process leads to the unique solution that will be printed by the Python code.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_mate_in_2():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the provided mate-in-two chess puzzle.\n\n    The key to this puzzle is understanding the consequence of the starting\n    position being technically illegal (Black's king is in check, but it's\n    White's turn). This forces Black's response to any non-checking move\n    by White.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The first move for White. This is a \"quiet\" move that doesn't check the King,\n    # but sets up the checkmate. It moves the Rook from f3 to c2.\n    # This move prepares to cover the d2 and c2 escape squares for the black king.\n    move_1_white = \"Rc2\"\n\n    # Due to the initial check from the Bishop on g2, Black has only one legal\n    # move: moving the King from e4 to d3.\n    move_1_black = \"Kd3\"\n\n    # White's second move, which delivers checkmate. The Knight from e7 moves\n    # to f5. It checks the king on d3 and covers the e2 escape square.\n    # The first move (Rc2) covers the d2 and c2 escape squares. All other\n    # escape squares are covered by other White pieces.\n    move_2_white = \"Nf5#\"\n\n    print(\"The solution for the mate in 2 puzzle is:\")\n    print(f\"1. {move_1_white} {move_1_black}\")\n    print(f\"2. {move_2_white}\")\n\n\nsolve_chess_mate_in_2()\n\n# The final solution in algebraic notation.\n# <<<1. Rc2 Kd3 2. Nf5#>>>\n```"
