    "To solve for the total current flowing from the voltage source, we need to find the total equivalent resistance (Req) of the circuit and then apply Ohm's Law (I = V / R).\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Analyze the circuit diagram** to understand how the resistors are connected. The circuit can be simplified into parallel branches.\n2.  **Simplify Branch 1 (left side):** Resistors R1 and R2 are in series. However, there is a wire (a short circuit) connected in parallel with this R1-R2 combination. This wire bypasses R1 and R2, meaning no current will flow through them. This leaves only R3 in this branch, connected directly across the voltage source.\n3.  **Simplify Branch 2 (right side):** Resistors R7 and R8 are connected in series. Their combined resistance is the sum of their individual resistances. This series combination is also connected across the voltage source.\n4.  **Calculate Total Equivalent Resistance (Req):** The two simplified branches are in parallel with each other. We will calculate the total equivalent resistance for these parallel branches.\n5.  **Calculate Total Current (I_total):** Using the total voltage (V2) and the total equivalent resistance (Req), we will use Ohm's Law (I = V / Req) to find the total current flowing from the source.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print out each step.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_circuit():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the circuit to calculate the total current.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define component values from the circuit diagram\n    V2 = 1.0  # Volts\n    R1 = 3.0  # Ohms\n    R2 = 7.0  # Ohms\n    R3 = 9.0  # Ohms\n    R7 = 100.0 # Ohms\n    R8 = 100.0 # Ohms\n\n    # Step 2: Simplify the circuit's parallel branches\n    \n    # Branch 1 simplification: R1 and R2 are short-circuited by a bypass wire.\n    # Therefore, the resistance of the first branch is just R3.\n    R_branch1 = R3\n\n    # Branch 2 simplification: R7 and R8 are in series.\n    R_branch2 = R7 + R8\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the total equivalent resistance (Req)\n    # The two branches are in parallel.\n    # The formula for two parallel resistors is Req = 1 / (1/R_branch1 + 1/R_branch2)\n    Req = 1 / (1 / R_branch1 + 1 / R_branch2)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the total current using Ohm's Law (I = V / R)\n    I_total = V2 / Req\n    \n    # Print the detailed calculation steps\n    print(\"This script calculates the total current for the given circuit.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Circuit Analysis ---\")\n    print(\"The circuit consists of two main parallel branches connected to the 1V source.\")\n    print(\"Branch 1: R1 and R2 are short-circuited, so its resistance is just R3.\")\n    print(f\"  - R_branch1 = R3 = {R3} Ω\")\n    print(\"Branch 2: R7 and R8 are in series.\")\n    print(f\"  - R_branch2 = R7 + R8 = {R7} Ω + {R8} Ω = {R_branch2} Ω\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Calculation ---\")\n    print(\"The total equivalent resistance (Req) is the parallel combination of these two branches.\")\n    print(\"Formula: Req = 1 / (1 / R_branch1 + 1 / R_branch2)\")\n    print(f\"Req = 1 / (1 / {R_branch1} + 1 / {R_branch2}) = {Req:.4f} Ω\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe total current (I_total) is calculated using Ohm's Law: I = V / Req\")\n    print(\"Final Equation:\")\n    print(f\"I_total = {V2} V / {Req:.4f} Ω\")\n\n    # Final Answer\n    # We use more precision for the final value if it's available.\n    if sys.version_info >= (3, 8):\n        from fractions import Fraction\n        R_branch1_f = Fraction(int(R_branch1), 1)\n        R_branch2_f = Fraction(int(R_branch2), 1)\n        V2_f = Fraction(int(V2), 1)\n        \n        Req_f = 1 / (1/R_branch1_f + 1/R_branch2_f)\n        I_total_f = V2_f / Req_f\n        \n        print(f\"\\nThe total current is {I_total_f.numerator}/{I_total_f.denominator} A, which is approximately {float(I_total_f):.4f} A.\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"\\nThe total current is approximately {I_total:.4f} A.\")\n\nsolve_circuit()\n```\n<<<0.1161>>>"
