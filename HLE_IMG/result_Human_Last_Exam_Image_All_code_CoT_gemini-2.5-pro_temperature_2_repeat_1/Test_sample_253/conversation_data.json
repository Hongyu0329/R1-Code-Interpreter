    "Based on the image, the organism is a type of lichen, specifically *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the maritime sunburst lichen. This species is found in coastal regions, including Acadia National Park.\n\nTo determine the number of amino acids in its XPH1 protein, I will programmatically query the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) protein database. The Python script below uses the Biopython library to perform this task.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify Organism and Protein**: The organism is *Xanthoria parietina* and the protein is XPH1.\n2.  **Search NCBI**: Use `Bio.Entrez.esearch` to find the protein in the NCBI database.\n3.  **Fetch Protein Data**: Use `Bio.Entrez.efetch` to retrieve the protein's sequence data in FASTA format using the ID found in the search.\n4.  **Parse and Count**: Use `Bio.SeqIO` to parse the FASTA data and then calculate the length of the amino acid sequence.\n5.  **Output**: Print the final count, which represents the number of amino acids.\n\n```python\n# First, ensure you have Biopython installed:\n# pip install biopython\n\nfrom Bio import Entrez\nfrom Bio import SeqIO\nimport io\n\ndef get_protein_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Searches the NCBI database for the XPH1 protein in Xanthoria parietina\n    and returns the number of amino acids in its sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Always provide an email to NCBI\n    Entrez.email = \"user@example.com\"\n\n    # Define the search terms\n    organism = \"Xanthoria parietina\"\n    protein_name = \"XPH1\"\n    \n    print(f\"Searching NCBI for the protein '{protein_name}' from the organism '{organism}'...\")\n\n    # Construct the search query\n    search_term = f'\"{organism}\"[Organism] AND \"{protein_name}\"[Protein Name]'\n\n    # Search the protein database\n    try:\n        handle = Entrez.esearch(db=\"protein\", term=search_term, retmax=\"1\")\n        record = Entrez.read(handle)\n        handle.close()\n\n        if not record[\"IdList\"]:\n            print(\"Could not find the specified protein.\")\n            return\n\n        # Get the GI number for the protein\n        protein_id = record[\"IdList\"][0]\n        print(f\"Found protein with NCBI ID: {protein_id}\")\n\n        # Fetch the full protein record in FASTA format\n        fetch_handle = Entrez.efetch(db=\"protein\", id=protein_id, rettype=\"fasta\", retmode=\"text\")\n        fasta_string = fetch_handle.read()\n        fetch_handle.close()\n        \n        # Parse the FASTA record from the string\n        seq_record = SeqIO.read(io.StringIO(fasta_string), \"fasta\")\n        \n        # The length of the sequence is the number of amino acids\n        amino_acid_count = len(seq_record.seq)\n\n        # There's no equation, so we print the final number directly.\n        print(f\"The number of amino acids in the encoded XPH1 protein is: {amino_acid_count}\")\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        print(\"Please check your internet connection and ensure Biopython is installed.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_protein_length()\n\n```\n<<<984>>>"
