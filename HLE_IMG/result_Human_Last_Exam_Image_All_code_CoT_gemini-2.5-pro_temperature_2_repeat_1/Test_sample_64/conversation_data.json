    "The process depicted in the image is a biological one, specifically from the field of mycology (the study of fungi). I will analyze the sequence of images to identify this process.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the image sequence:** The images are labeled L, M, and N, suggesting a time series showing a change in a filamentous biological structure.\n2.  **Identify key morphological changes:** I will observe the changes occurring in the structure, particularly at the location marked by the arrowheads. The structure is a filament divided into compartments by cross-walls (septa), which is characteristic of a fungal hypha.\n3.  **Relate changes to known fungal processes:** The observed changes—a bulge forming at a septum followed by a sharp bending or \"kinking\" of the hypha—are hallmarks of a specific process in fungal cell division.\n4.  **Identify the process:** Based on the characteristic morphology, the process is the formation of a clamp connection. This is a structure unique to basidiomycete fungi used to maintain a dikaryotic state (two distinct nuclei per cell) during cell division. The images show the initial stages of this formation.\n5.  **Provide a Python script:** As requested, I will provide a simple Python script that prints the name of the identified process.\n\n```python\ndef identify_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the biological process shown in the images.\n  The image sequence (L, M, N) shows a fungal hypha.\n  - L: A septum is indicated, with a slight swelling.\n  - M: A bulge has formed at the septum, and the hypha is kinking.\n  - N: The kink is more pronounced.\n  This process of forming a lateral hook or bulge at a septum during cell division\n  is known as clamp connection formation, a characteristic of basidiomycete fungi.\n  \"\"\"\n  process_name = \"Clamp connection formation\"\n  print(f\"The process depicted in the image is: {process_name}\")\n\nidentify_process()\n```\n<<<Clamp connection formation>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
