  This function identifies and prints the biological process shown in the images.
  The image sequence (L, M, N) shows a fungal hypha.
  - L: A septum is indicated, with a slight swelling.
  - M: A bulge has formed at the septum, and the hypha is kinking.
  - N: The kink is more pronounced.
  This process of forming a lateral hook or bulge at a septum during cell division
  is known as clamp connection formation, a characteristic of basidiomycete fungi.
