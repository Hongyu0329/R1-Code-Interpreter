    # --- Analysis of Stereocenter 1: Acyl Chloride ---
    # The stereocenter is attached to: -OCH3, -C(O)Cl, -CF3, -C6H5 (Phenyl)
    # CIP Priorities:
    # 1. -OCH3 (highest, attached via O)
    # 2. -C(O)Cl (C attached to Cl(17))
    # 3. -CF3 (C attached to F(9))
    # 4. -C6H5 (lowest, C attached to C(6))
    # With -OCH3(1, dashed) and -C6H5(4, in-plane), we swap them to place #4 in the back.
    # The sequence of remaining groups 1(left), 2(up), 3(right) is clockwise -> (R) for the swapped molecule.
    # The original configuration is the opposite.
    config1 = "S"

    # --- Analysis of Stereocenter 2: Alcohol ---
    # The stereocenter is attached to: -OH, -CH2OCH3, -CH2CH(CH3)2, -H
    # CIP Priorities:
    # 1. -OH (highest, attached via O)
    # 2. -CH2OCH3 (next C is attached to O)
    # 3. -CH2CH(CH3)2 (next C is attached to C)
    # 4. -H (lowest)
    # The lowest priority group, -H, is pointing away (dashed).
    # The path from 1(wedged/front) -> 2(up) -> 3(down) is counter-clockwise.
    config2 = "S"

    # --- Analysis of Stereocenter 3: Product (from Alcohol) ---
    # The reaction does not change the stereocenter's 3D arrangement.
    # The substituents are now: -O(C=O)R', -CH2OCH3, -CH2CH(CH3)2, -H.
    # The CIP priorities are analogous to the alcohol reactant:
    # 1. -O(C=O)R', 2. -CH2OCH3, 3. -CH2CH(CH3)2, 4. -H
    # Since neither the arrangement nor the priority order has changed, the configuration remains the same.
    config3 = "S"

    # --- Analysis of Stereocenter 4: Product (from Acyl Chloride) ---
    # The 3D arrangement is retained. The -C(O)Cl group is now -C(O)OR'.
    # New substituents: -OCH3, -C(O)OR', -CF3, -C6H5
    # Re-evaluating CIP priorities:
    # 1. -OCH3 (via O)
    # Comparing C-groups based on atoms attached: -CF3(F,F,F), -C(O)OR'(O,O,O), -C6H5(C,C,C)
    # Priority based on Z: F(9)>O(8)>C(6).
    # 2. -CF3
    # 3. -C(O)OR'
    # 4. -C6H5
    # The priorities of the CF3 and Carbonyl groups have swapped.
    # With the new priorities, we re-assign. Swap #4(Ph) and #1(OMe, dashed).
    # Path 1(left) -> 2(right) -> 3(up) is counter-clockwise -> (S) for swapped.
    # Original configuration is the opposite.
