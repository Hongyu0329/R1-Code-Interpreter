    This function encapsulates the logic to determine the chiral index 'm' for each plot.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    
    1.  **Properties of (4,m) SWNTs:**
        *   (4,0): Semiconducting, Zigzag (Horizontal lines), Smallest diameter (largest gap), Fewest atoms in unit cell.
        *   (4,1): Metallic, Chiral (Tilted lines).
        *   (4,2): Semiconducting, Chiral (Tilted lines).
        *   (4,3): Semiconducting, Chiral (Tilted lines), Largest diameter (smallest gap), Most atoms in unit cell.
        *   (4,4): Metallic, Armchair (Vertical lines).
    
    2.  **Oscillator Strength Plots (2, 4, 6, 8):**
        *   Plot 8: Vertical cutting lines passing through K/K' points -> Metallic Armchair -> m=4.
        *   Plot 2: Tilted cutting lines passing through K/K' points -> Metallic Chiral -> m=1.
        *   Plot 6: Horizontal cutting lines missing K/K' points -> Semiconducting Zigzag -> m=0.
        *   Plot 4: Tilted cutting lines missing K/K' points -> Semiconducting Chiral. Must be m=2 or m=3. We can distinguish based on the density of cutting lines, which is proportional to the number of atoms in the unit cell (N). N(4,2)=28, N(4,3)=74. The density in Plot 4 is visibly much lower than would be expected for m=3 and is comparable to m=4 (N=24) and m=1 (N=42). Thus, Plot 4 corresponds to m=2. This implies the oscillator plot for m=3 is the one that is omitted.
    
    3.  **Dipole Moment Plots (1, 3, 5, 7, 9):**
        *   Plots 1 & 5 show no band gap, so they are metallic (m=1, m=4).
            *   Plot 1: Linear band crossing at the center, characteristic of an Armchair tube -> m=4.
            *   Plot 5: Much higher density of bands, characteristic of the more complex Chiral tube -> m=1.
        *   Plots 3, 7, 9 show a band gap, so they are semiconducting (m=0, m=2, m=3).
            *   We can order them by band gap size (inversely proportional to diameter) and density of bands (proportional to unit cell complexity).
            *   Band Gap: Gap(m=0) > Gap(m=2) > Gap(m=3).
            *   Density of Bands: Density(m=3) > Density(m=2) > Density(m=0).
            *   Plot 9: Largest gap, fewest bands -> m=0.
            *   Plot 7: Intermediate gap and band density -> m=2.
            *   Plot 3: Smallest gap, highest band density -> m=3.

    4.  **Final Sequence Assembly:**
        *   Plot 1: m=4
        *   Plot 2: m=1
        *   Plot 3: m=3
        *   Plot 4: m=2
        *   Plot 5: m=1
        *   Plot 6: m=0
        *   Plot 7: m=2
        *   Plot 8: m=4
        *   Plot 9: m=0
