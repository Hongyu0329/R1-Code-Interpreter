    "Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n1.  **Analyze the Image and the Date:** The image shows a man receiving an award. The prompt states this occurred on June 20, 2019. A search for major award ceremonies on or around this date leads to the 2019 NHL Awards. The recipient in the image is identifiable as hockey player Nikita Kucherov. In that 2018-2019 season, Kucherov had a historic year, winning the Art Ross Trophy (most points), the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), and the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player voted by peers). Winning these three major awards in one season is a rare accomplishment, often referred to as a \"hat-trick\" of awards.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clue:** The second part of the prompt says, \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This points towards a historical process or object involving mercury.\n\n3.  **Connect the Clues:** I will connect the two parts using the term \"Hat Trick\".\n    *   The image depicts a conceptual \"Hat Trick\" of awards for Nikita Kucherov.\n    *   The clue refers to the origin of the term \"hat trick.\" It is believed to have originated in cricket, where a player who achieved a notable feat (like taking three wickets in a row) was awarded a new hat. In that era, felt hats were common, and the process of making felt involved using mercuric nitrate (a mercury salt) to treat the fur. This process was highly toxic and caused neurological damage in hat-makers (\"mad as a hatter\"), and it has since been discontinued.\n\nTherefore, \"X Y\" is \"Hat Trick,\" as it elegantly connects the modern sporting achievement in the photo with the historical, mercury-related origin of the term. I will now write a simple Python program to print this conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer to capture the output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\ndef solve_riddle():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function solves the riddle by identifying the subject from the image and clue.\n  \"\"\"\n  x = \"Hat\"\n  y = \"Trick\"\n  \n  print(f\"The first part of the clue points to Nikita Kucherov's 'hat trick' of awards (Hart, Lindsay, Art Ross) at the 2019 NHL Awards.\")\n  print(f\"The second part of the clue refers to the historical origin of the term 'hat trick', where felt hats were given as prizes.\")\n  print(f\"The manufacturing of these felt hats used toxic mercury salts, a process that has now ceased.\")\n  print(f\"Therefore, X is '{x}' and Y is '{y}'.\")\n  print(f\"The complete term is {x} {y}.\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n\n# Restore stdout\nsys.stdout = old_stdout\n# Print the captured output to the console\nprint(captured_output.getvalue())\n\n# The final answer in the required format is provided separately below.\n# This code serves to explain and confirm the reasoning.\n```\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
