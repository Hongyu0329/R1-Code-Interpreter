    "This problem requires us to analyze a raster plot of neuronal activity to determine the timing of synchronized firing events, known as bursts, and then calculate the average time interval between these bursts.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts:** Visually inspect the provided graph to locate the time points where a large number of electrodes fire simultaneously. These appear as dense vertical bands.\n2.  **Estimate Timestamps:** Read the corresponding time value from the x-axis for the center of each identified burst.\n3.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** Compute the time difference between each consecutive pair of burst timestamps.\n4.  **Calculate Average IBI:** Find the average of all the calculated inter-burst intervals.\n5.  **Format Output:** Write a Python script to perform these calculations, display the steps clearly, and provide the final answer rounded to two significant figures.\n\n### Execution:\nBased on the graph, the synchronized bursts are centered at the following approximate times:\n*   Burst 1: 4 s\n*   Burst 2: 17 s\n*   Burst 3: 27 s\n*   Burst 4: 37 s\n*   Burst 5: 48 s\n\nNow, we can proceed with the calculations using a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_average_ibi():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies burst timestamps from the graph, calculates the inter-burst intervals,\n    and computes the average interval.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: List the identified timestamps of the synchronized bursts (in seconds).\n    burst_timestamps = [4, 17, 27, 37, 48]\n    print(f\"Identified synchronized burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs).\n    # This is the difference in time between consecutive bursts.\n    inter_burst_intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\n    print(f\"Calculated inter-burst intervals (s): {inter_burst_intervals.tolist()}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the average inter-burst interval.\n    average_ibi = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\n\n    # Step 4: Display the final calculation and the result.\n    # The final answer must be formatted to two significant figures.\n    # The calculated average is 11.0, which already has two significant figures when written as 11.\n    \n    # Building the equation string for clear output\n    interval_sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, inter_burst_intervals))\n    num_intervals = len(inter_burst_intervals)\n    \n    print(\"\\nCalculating the average inter-burst interval:\")\n    # Print the full equation with the numbers used in the calculation\n    print(f\"Average = ({interval_sum_str}) / {num_intervals}\")\n    print(f\"Average = {sum(inter_burst_intervals)} / {num_intervals}\")\n    \n    # The result 11 has two significant figures.\n    final_answer = round(average_ibi)\n    print(f\"The average inter-burst interval is {final_answer} s.\")\n\ncalculate_average_ibi()\n\n# The final numerical answer.\nfinal_answer_value = 11\n```\n<<<11>>>"
