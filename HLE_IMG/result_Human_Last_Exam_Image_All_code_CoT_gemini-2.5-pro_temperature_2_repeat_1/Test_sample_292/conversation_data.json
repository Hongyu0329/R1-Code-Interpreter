The key features are the large, sail-like roof structure supported by a network of white steel beams and the patterned glass ceiling that casts unique shadows. A quick visual search confirms this location. Therefore, the picture was taken in San Diego, California.\n\nI will provide a simple Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\n# The image shows the unique architecture of the Sails Pavilion.\n# This pavilion is a well-known part of the San Diego Convention Center.\n# The Convention Center is located in the city of San Diego.\n\ncity = \"San Diego\"\n\n# The script will now print the identified city.\nprint(f\"This picture was taken in {city}.\")\n```\n<<<San Diego>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    This picture was taken in 2024.
