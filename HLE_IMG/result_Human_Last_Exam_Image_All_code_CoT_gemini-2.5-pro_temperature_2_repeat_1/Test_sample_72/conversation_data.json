    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pericyclic reactions involved in the transformation.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Product:** The reaction starts with hexafluorobenzene and cyclobutene, under photochemical conditions (indicated by `hv`). The product is a complex tricyclic molecule. This suggests a multi-step process rather than a single concerted reaction between the initial reactants.\n\n2.  **Identify the First Reaction:** Aromatic compounds like benzene and its derivatives can undergo photochemical valence isomerization. Hexafluorobenzene is known to isomerize to its valence isomer, hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene (commonly known as hexafluoro Dewar benzene). This is the first pericyclic reaction. This type of reaction, involving the cyclization of a conjugated pi-system, is classified as an **electrocyclic reaction**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Second Reaction:** The intermediate, hexafluoro Dewar benzene, possesses two isolated double bonds. It then reacts with cyclobutene, which has one double bond. The product structure shows that a new four-membered ring has been formed by combining one double bond from hexafluoro Dewar benzene (a 2π electron system) and the double bond from cyclobutene (another 2π electron system). This type of reaction, where two π-electron systems combine to form a cyclic compound, is called a cycloaddition. Since it involves two components of 2π electrons each, it is specifically a **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n4.  **Confirm Photochemical Allowance:** Both reactions are known to be photochemically allowed. The formation of Dewar benzene from benzene is a classic photochemical process. According to Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [2+2] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed.\n\nTherefore, the two pericyclic reactions are an electrocyclic reaction followed by a [2+2] cycloaddition. The following Python code will print out this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef explain_pericyclic_reactions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the two pericyclic reactions occurring in the given transformation.\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = [\n        \"The overall transformation occurs via two sequential photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions.\",\n        \"\",\n        \"Step 1: Electrocyclic Reaction\",\n        \"The first step is the photochemical valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to form hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene (hexafluoro Dewar benzene).\",\n        \"This is an example of an electrocyclic reaction, where a conjugated π system undergoes a ring closure.\",\n        \"Reaction: Hexafluorobenzene --(hv)--> Hexafluoro Dewar benzene\",\n        \"\",\n        \"Step 2: [2+2] Cycloaddition\",\n        \"The second step is the reaction between the intermediate, hexafluoro Dewar benzene, and cyclobutene.\",\n        \"One of the 2π-electron systems (a double bond) of the Dewar benzene reacts with the 2π-electron system of cyclobutene.\",\n        \"This forms a new four-membered ring, characteristic of a [2+2] cycloaddition.\",\n        \"Reaction: Hexafluoro Dewar benzene + Cyclobutene --(hv)--> Final Product\",\n        \"\",\n        \"Conclusion:\",\n        \"The two types of pericyclic reactions involved are an Electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition.\"\n    ]\n    \n    print('\\n'.join(explanation))\n\nexplain_pericyclic_reactions()\n```\n<<<Electrocyclic reaction and [2+2] cycloaddition>>>"
