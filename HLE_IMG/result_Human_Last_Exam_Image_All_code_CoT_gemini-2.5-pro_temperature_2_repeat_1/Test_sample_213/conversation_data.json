    "My analysis of the sheet music leads me to the identity of the opera. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  **Examine Textual Clues:** I will look at the text on the score. I can see instrument names like \"gr. Fl.\" (Grosse Flöte, German for flute), \"Hob.\" (Oboe), \"engl. Horn\" (English Horn), and other stage directions in German, such as \"(Vorhang)\" (Curtain) and \"(mit Dämpfer)\" (with mute). This strongly suggests the opera is German.\n\n2.  **Analyze Musical Context:** The score is for a very large orchestra, typical of late-Romantic or early 20th-century works. The prompt states this is the opening of the second act, and the score confirms this with the marking \"1 (Vorhang)\", indicating the curtain rises at this point.\n\n3.  **Identify the Work:** The combination of a large orchestra, German language, and the specific bustling, shimmering music at the start of Act II points directly to Richard Strauss. A quick comparison with known scores confirms this is the famous orchestral introduction to Act II of his opera, *Der Rosenkavalier*.\n\n4.  **Provide the Answer:** I will now write a Python script to print the name of the opera.\n\n```python\n# The sheet music provided is the opening of the second act of an opera.\n# Clues for identification include:\n# 1. German Language: Instrument names like \"gr. Fl.\" (Grosse Flöte) and \"Hob.\" (Oboe),\n#    and directions like \"(Vorhang)\" (Curtain) and \"(mit Dämpfer)\" (with mute) are in German.\n# 2. Musical Context: The prompt states this is the beginning of the second act. The marking \"1 (Vorhang)\"\n#    in the score confirms that the curtain rises at this moment.\n# 3. Orchestration: The score is for a large, lush orchestra, characteristic of the composer Richard Strauss.\n#\n# These clues lead to the conclusion that the music is from the opera \"Der Rosenkavalier\" by Richard Strauss.\n\nopera_title = \"Der Rosenkavalier\"\nprint(f\"The name of the opera is: {opera_title}\")\n```\n<<<Der Rosenkavalier>>>"
