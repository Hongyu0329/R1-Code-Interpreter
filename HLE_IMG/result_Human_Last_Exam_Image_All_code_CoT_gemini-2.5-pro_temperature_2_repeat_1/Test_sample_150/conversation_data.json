    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the chemical transformations:\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n    *   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride.\n    *   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation. The propanoyl group from propanoyl chloride attaches to the benzene ring, forming a ketone.\n    *   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination**\n    *   **Reactant:** Propiophenone (Intermediate-1).\n    *   **Reagent:** Br₂/FeBr₃.\n    *   **Reaction:** The propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is an electron-withdrawing group and acts as a meta-director for electrophilic aromatic substitution. Therefore, a bromine atom is added to the meta position on the benzene ring.\n    *   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Reduction**\n    *   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one (Intermediate-2).\n    *   **Reagent:** H₂/Pd (Hydrogen gas over a Palladium catalyst).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. The ketone group (C=O) is reduced all the way down to a methylene group (CH₂). This is also known as hydrogenolysis of a benzylic ketone.\n    *   **Intermediate-3:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n    *   **Reactant:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene (Intermediate-3).\n    *   **Reagent:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide) with (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator) in CCl₄ (carbon tetrachloride, a solvent).\n    *   **Reaction:** This set of reagents is used for free-radical bromination specifically at the benzylic position (the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring). The benzylic hydrogen is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   **Final Product:** 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane.\n\nThe following Python code describes this process and identifies the final product.\n\n```python\ndef track_reaction_synthesis():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function tracks the transformations in the provided reaction scheme\n    to identify the name of the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation\n    # Benzene reacts with propanoyl chloride and AlCl3.\n    intermediate_1 = \"Propiophenone\"\n    print(f\"Step 1: The reaction of benzene with propanoyl chloride in the presence of AlCl3 is a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate-1 is: {intermediate_1}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination\n    # The propanoyl group is a meta-director.\n    intermediate_2 = \"1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\"\n    print(f\"Step 2: Propiophenone undergoes electrophilic aromatic bromination.
