    "My plan is to determine the structure of the unknown compound by systematically analyzing each piece of spectroscopic data provided.\n\n1.  **Mass Spectrometry (MS):** I will use the molecular ion peak (M+) to determine the molecular weight and deduce a plausible molecular formula using the Nitrogen Rule. Then, I will calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU).\n2.  **Infrared Spectroscopy (IR):** I will identify key functional groups by looking at characteristic absorption bands (e.g., N-H, C-H aromatic/aliphatic, C=C aromatic).\n3.  **¹³C NMR and DEPT-135:** I will assign the type of each carbon atom (CH₃, CH₂, CH, or quaternary C) based on its chemical shift and its phase in the DEPT-135 spectrum (positive, negative, or absent). This will allow me to count the total number of each type of carbon.\n4.  **¹H NMR:** I will analyze the proton signals, focusing on their chemical shift, integration (number of protons), and multiplicity (splitting pattern) to understand the connectivity of the atoms.\n5.  **HSQC:** I will use this 2D spectrum to correlate each proton signal with its directly attached carbon signal, confirming the assignments made in steps 3 and 4.\n6.  **Structure Elucidation:** I will piece together the identified fragments (e.g., phenyl group, amine group, aliphatic chain) into possible isomers and compare their predicted spectral properties with the experimental data to find the correct structure.\n7.  **IUPAC Nomenclature:** Finally, I will name the identified structure according to IUPAC rules.\n\nI will present this entire analysis and the final conclusion within a Python code block, using the `print()` function for the output as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_spectroscopy_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided spectroscopic data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    analysis_steps = \"\"\"\n    Step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name:\n\n    1. Molecular Formula and Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)\n    - Mass Spectrum (MS): The molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z 135 indicates a molecular weight of 135 g/mol.\n    - Nitrogen Rule: An odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. Assuming one nitrogen (N).\n    - Molecular Formula Calculation:\n        - Mass remaining after N: 135 - 14 = 121.\n        - Number of carbons (C): 121 / 12 is ~10. Let's try 9 carbons. 9 * 12 = 108.\n        - Number of hydrogens (H): 121 - 108 = 13.\n        - The molecular formula is C9H13N.\n    - Degree of Unsaturation (DoU):\n        - DoU = C - H/2 + N/2 + 1\n        - DoU = 9 - (13/2) + (1/2) + 1 = 9 - 6.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 4.\n        - A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n\n    2. Functional Group Analysis (IR and NMR)\n    - IR Spectrum: Shows key stretches for N-H (primary amine, ~3300 cm⁻¹), aromatic C-H (>3000 cm⁻¹), and aliphatic C-H (<3000 cm⁻¹).\n    - ¹³C NMR / DEPT-135: 7 total carbon signals.\n        - DEPT-135 shows one negative signal (one CH2 group) and five positive signals (CH and/or CH3 groups).\n        - δ 145.1: Quaternary C (aromatic ipso, not in DEPT).\n        - δ 128.5, 127.3, 126.3: Aromatic CH groups (positive).\n        - δ 49.6: Aliphatic CH group (positive).\n        - δ 43.5: Aliphatic CH2 group (negative).\n        - δ 19.2: Aliphatic CH3 group (positive).\n        - This confirms a C9 skeleton: 1 C(quat), 5 CH(arom), 1 CH(aliph), 1 CH2(aliph), 1 CH3(aliph).\n\n    3. Structure Assembly from 1H, 13C, and HSQC data\n    - The data points to these fragments: a C6H5- group, an -NH2 group, and a C3 aliphatic chain.\n    - The aliphatic chain consists of one CH, one CH2, and one CH3.\n    - 1H NMR signals confirm the fragments:\n        - δ ~7.2 ppm (5H): A monosubstituted phenyl group (C6H5-).\n        - δ ~1.2 ppm (3H, doublet): A -CH3 group next to a CH group.\n        - δ ~2.7-2.9 ppm (3H total): A -CH- group (1H) and a -CH2- group (2H) that are adjacent.\n    - HSQC confirms the connectivity:\n        - H(~1.2 ppm) connects to C(19.2 ppm) -> This is the CH3 group.\n        - H(~2.7 ppm) connects to C(43.5 ppm) -> This is the CH2 group.\n        - H(~2.8 ppm) connects to C(49.6 ppm) -> This is the CH group.\n    - Putting the fragments together, the structure must be C6H5-CH2-CH(NH2)-CH3.\n    - This structure (1-phenylpropan-2-amine) perfectly matches all spectral data:\n        - The benzylic CH2 protons at ~2.7 ppm are attached to the CH2 carbon at 43.5 ppm.\n        - The CH proton (alpha to the amine) at ~2.8 ppm is attached to the CH carbon at 49.6 ppm.\n        - The CH3 protons at ~1.2 ppm are attached to the CH3 carbon at 19.2 ppm and appear as a doublet due to splitting by the neighboring single CH proton.\n\n    4. IUPAC Name\n    - The parent chain is propane.\n    - Numbering gives the principal functional group (amine) the lowest number (position 2). The phenyl substituent is at position 1.\n    - The final IUPAC name is 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(analysis_steps)\n\nsolve_spectroscopy_problem()\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>\n```"
