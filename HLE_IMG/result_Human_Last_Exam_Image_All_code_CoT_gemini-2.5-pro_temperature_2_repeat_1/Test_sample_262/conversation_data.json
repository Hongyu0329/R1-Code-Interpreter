    "The user wants me to identify which of the four Iridium(III) complexes shown are expected to have shorter lifetimes when used in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs).\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the molecular structures:** All four complexes are cationic Iridium(III) emitters of the form `[Ir(C^N)₂(N^N)]PF₆`. They share the same central Ir(III) ion, the same neutral ligand (`N^N` = 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine), and the same counter-ion (PF₆⁻). The only difference between them is the substitution pattern on the phenyl ring of the cyclometalating `C^N` ligand.\n    *   **Complex 1:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has fluorine atoms at both the 2' (ortho) and 4' (para) positions relative to the Ir-C bond.\n    *   **Complex 2:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-phenylpyridine (ppy). It has no fluorine substituents.\n    *   **Complex 3:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has a fluorine atom only at the 2' (ortho) position.\n    *   **Complex 4:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has a fluorine atom only at the 4' (para) position.\n\n2.  **Relate structure to lifetime:** The operational lifetime of an LEC is determined by the chemical stability of the emitter complex under electrical bias. While fluorination is a common strategy to increase the oxidative stability and HOMO-LUMO gap of iridium complexes (which would suggest longer lifetimes for fluorinated complexes), a specific degradation pathway becomes significant. It has been well-established in the literature that iridium complexes with fluorine substituents at the 2'-position (ortho to the Ir-C bond) are susceptible to degradation via reductive C-F bond cleavage. This pathway is a major cause of device failure and leads to significantly shorter operational lifetimes.\n\n3.  **Identify complexes with the destabilizing feature:** I will screen the four complexes to see which ones contain a fluorine atom at the 2' position of the phenyl ring.\n    *   Complex 1: Has a fluorine atom at the 2'-position.\n    *   Complex 2: Has no fluorine atoms.\n    *   Complex 3: Has a fluorine atom at the 2'-position.\n    *   Complex 4: Does not have a fluorine atom at the 2'-position.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on this principle, Complexes 1 and 3 are expected to be the least stable and therefore exhibit shorter lifetimes.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to automate this analysis. The script will define the complexes, apply the rule about ortho-fluorine instability, and print out the identification of the unstable complexes.\n\n```python\ndef solve_lec_lifetime():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies which Iridium complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes in LECs.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the complexes based on the substitution pattern of their\n    # cyclometalating (C^N) ligands.
