    # 2. Analyze the distance function 'dist'.

    # 4. Synthesize the findings.
    # The shader code contains distinct logical parts for both chromatic aberration and blocky/grid-based shapes.
    # Image A is the only option that exhibits both of these specific characteristics.
    # It is highly likely that the provided shader code is a flawed version of the code meant to generate image A.
    # For example, removing the `.x` swizzle would enable chromatic aberration,
    # and changing the return value of `dist` to use the gridded coordinates would create the rectangles.

    print("Step 1: The shader calculates the Worley pattern at three different coordinates: UV, UV+offset, and UV-offset.")
    print("This is the standard method for producing a chromatic aberration effect, where color channels are displaced.")
    print("This points towards images A, B, or F.\n")

    print("Step 2: The 'dist' function uses 'floor(a*size)/size' to quantize coordinates to a 20x20 grid.")
    print("This technique is used to create blocky, grid-based graphics, not smooth gradients.")
    print("This points towards images A or D.\n")

    print("Step 3: To generate smooth circles (like in B, C, E, F), the code would use the returned Euclidean distance `sqrt(...)`.")
    print("To generate rectangles (like in A, D), it would need to use a different distance metric (like Chebyshev) or logic based on the quantized grid coordinates.\n")
    
    print("Step 4: The code as written contains contradictions. It sets up for chromatic aberration but outputs greyscale. It sets up a grid but calculates a smooth distance.")
    print("However, Image A is the only option that displays *both* key features hinted at in the code: chromatic aberration and rectangular, grid-like shapes.")
    print("Therefore, it is the most plausible result of the *intended* (but flawed) shader code.\n")
