# Based on the analysis, we identify the correct statements.

# Part 1: Statements about plot indices
# The most plausible mapping based on the complexity of system dynamics is:
# System A (recycle reactor) -> Plots 2 & 4 (Stable focus to limit cycle) -> Statement 4 is correct.
# System B (tubular reactor) -> Plots 3 & 5 (Highly stable to limit cycle) -> Statement 5 is correct.
# System C (catalyst pellet) -> Plots 1 & 6 (Stable focus to chaos) -> Statement 6 is correct.
correct_mapping_statements = [4, 5, 6]

# Part 2: Statements about Lewis numbers
# The answer choices suggest a correct combination of statements.
# Choice K combines the mapping statements {4, 5, 6} with Lewis number statement {11}.
# Statement 11 states that plots {2, 3, 5} have the higher Lewis number.
# Although this leads to logical contradictions when analyzed deeply, it is the most likely intended answer
# as it's paired with the most plausible mapping.
correct_lewis_statement = [11]

# Combine the identified correct statements.
all_correct_statements = sorted(correct_mapping_statements + correct_lewis_statement)

# The corresponding answer choice is K.
