    "The image provided shows a large, square earthwork in a desert landscape. I will first use a python script to convert the given coordinates from Degrees, Minutes, Seconds (DMS) format to Decimal Degrees (DD) for easier use in digital mapping tools. Then, I will provide the identification of the structure based on these coordinates.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the latitude and longitude coordinates in DMS format.\n2.  Create a function to convert DMS coordinates to Decimal Degrees using the formula: `DD = degrees + minutes/60 + seconds/3600`. The sign will be negative for South and West directions.\n3.  Apply this function to the given latitude (29° 06' 18.75''N) and longitude (103° 47' 50.28''W).\n4.  Print the converted coordinates.\n5.  Provide the final answer explaining what the structure is.\n\n```python\ndef dms_to_dd(degrees, minutes, seconds, direction):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts coordinates from Degrees, Minutes, Seconds (DMS) to Decimal Degrees (DD).\n    \"\"\"\n    dd = float(degrees) + float(minutes)/60 + float(seconds)/(60*60)\n    if direction in ['S', 'W']:\n        dd *= -1\n    return dd\n\n# --- Latitude ---\nlat_deg = 29\nlat_min = 6\nlat_sec = 18.75\nlat_dir = 'N'\n\n# --- Longitude ---\nlon_deg = 103\nlon_min = 47\nlon_sec = 50.28\nlon_dir = 'W'\n\n# --- Conversion ---\ndecimal_lat = dms_to_dd(lat_deg, lat_min, lat_sec, lat_dir)\ndecimal_lon = dms_to_dd(lon_deg, lon_min, lon_sec, lon_dir)\n\nprint(f\"Original Latitude: {lat_deg}° {lat_min}' {lat_sec}\\\" {lat_dir}\")\nprint(f\"Original Longitude: {lon_deg}° {lon_min}' {lon_sec}\\\" {lon_dir}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Converted to Decimal Degrees:\")\nprint(f\"Latitude: {decimal_lat}\")\nprint(f\"Longitude: {decimal_lon}\")\n\nprint(\"\\n--- Structure Identification ---\")\nprint(\"The structure at these coordinates is a large, modern earthwork, often referred to as 'The Square' or the 'Cíbolo Creek Square'.\")\nprint(\"Despite its appearance, it is not an ancient structure. It is believed to be a contemporary land art installation, a common feature in this region famous for the minimalist art scene of Marfa, Texas.\")\nprint(\"\\nIs it a historic landmark?\")\nprint(\"No, this specific square structure is not an officially recognized historic landmark. A true historic site, the ruins of the 18th-century Spanish 'Presidio de San Carlos', is located nearby but is a separate location.\")\n```\n<<<The square structure at coordinates 29° 06' 18.75''N and 103° 47' 50.28''W is a modern earthwork, most likely a piece of land art. It is not an ancient structure and it is not considered an official historic landmark.>>>"
