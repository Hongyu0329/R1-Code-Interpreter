    Solves the insect sexing puzzle based on visual identification.
    
    A: The left bee has longer antennae (male trait), the right has shorter antennae and a stouter,
       more pointed abdomen (female trait). Pair is M, F. Index is 3.
    B: The left wasp has curled antennae tips (definitive male trait in Polistes), the right has
       straight antennae (female trait). Pair is M, F. Index is 3.
    C: The left bee has extremely long antennae and a yellow face patch (male long-horned bee traits),
       the right has much shorter antennae (female trait). Pair is M, F. Index is 3.
       
    The final answer is the sequence of these indices.
