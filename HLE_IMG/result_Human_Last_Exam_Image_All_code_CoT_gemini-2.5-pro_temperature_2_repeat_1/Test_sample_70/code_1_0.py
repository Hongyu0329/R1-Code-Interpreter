    This function explains the two pericyclic reactions involved in the thermal transformation.

    explanation = """The thermal transformation proceeds through a sequence of two pericyclic reactions:

1.  **Electrocyclic Ring Opening:** The first step is a thermal electrocyclic ring-opening of the four-membered cyclobutene ring. This is a 4-pi electron process. For a thermal reaction, the Woodward-Hoffmann rules dictate that this proceeds in a **conrotatory** fashion. This step converts the initial bicyclic molecule into a monocyclic intermediate, an isomer of cyclodeca-1,3,5,7,9-pentaene ([10]annulene).

2.  **Electrocyclic Ring Closing:** The second step is a thermal electrocyclic ring-closing. A 1,3,5-hexatriene segment within the [10]annulene intermediate cyclizes to form a stable six-membered ring. This is a 6-pi electron process. The Woodward-Hoffmann rules for a thermal reaction of this type require a **disrotatory** mode of ring closure. This closure results in the formation of the final product, cis-9,10-dihydronaphthalene."""
