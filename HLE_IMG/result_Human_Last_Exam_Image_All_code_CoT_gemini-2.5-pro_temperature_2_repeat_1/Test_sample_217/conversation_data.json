    "My plan is to identify the cuneiform sign in the image and its meaning from the third millennium BCE.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The image shows a cuneiform sign that has the clear structure of a building: a rectangular base representing the floor plan and walls, topped by a triangular shape representing a roof.\n2.  **Identify the Sign:** This pictograph is the Sumerian sign **Ã‰**.\n3.  **Determine Meaning:** The primary and literal meaning of the sign Ã‰ is \"house\" or \"temple\". This meaning was well-established in the third millennium BCE.\n4.  **Evaluate Choices:** I will compare this meaning with the provided options.\n    *   A. Tool - Incorrect.\n    *   B. Guard - Incorrect.\n    *   C. Bread - Incorrect.\n    *   D. Home - Correct. \"Home\" is a synonym for \"house\".\n    *   E. Deity - Incorrect. The sign for a deity (DINGIR) is a star symbol.\n    *   F. Beard - Incorrect.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that prints this explanation and the final correct choice.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_cuneiform_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided cuneiform sign and determines its meaning.\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = \"\"\"\n    The cuneiform sign shown in the image is the Sumerian logogram 'Ã‰'.\n    \n    1.  **Visual Analysis:** The sign is a pictograph that clearly depicts a structure. It has a rectangular base, suggesting walls and a floor plan, and a gabled top, representing a roof. This is a classic representation of a building.\n    \n    2.  **Meaning in the Third Millennium:** In the third millennium BCE, this sign's primary meaning was 'house' or 'temple'. Sumerian civilization placed great importance on both domestic dwellings and religious structures, and this sign was fundamental in their writing system.\n    \n    3.  **Evaluating the Answer Choices:**\n        *   A. Tool: Incorrect. Signs for tools look different (e.g., APIN for plow).\n        *   B. Guard: Incorrect. The sign for a guard (EN.NUN) has a different composition.\n        *   C. Bread: Incorrect. The sign for bread (NINDA) is typically represented as a ration bowl.\n        *   D. Home: Correct. 'Home' is a synonym for 'house', which is the direct translation of Ã‰.\n        *   E. Deity: Incorrect. The sign for a deity (DINGIR) is a star-like symbol (ð’€­).\n        *   F. Beard: Incorrect. The sign for a beard (SU) is part of a sign representing a man's head.\n\n    Based on the analysis, the sign means 'house' or 'home'.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation).strip())\n\nsolve_cuneiform_riddle()\nprint(\"<<<D>>>\")\n```"
