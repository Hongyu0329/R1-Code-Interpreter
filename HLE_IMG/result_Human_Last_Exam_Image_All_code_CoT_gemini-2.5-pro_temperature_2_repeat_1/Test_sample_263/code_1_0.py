1.  **Analyze Complex Structures:**
    *   All three compounds are cationic Ir(III) complexes, suitable for use in Light-emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs).
    *   **Complex 1 ([Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+):** This is a standard, widely-used parent complex. It serves as a good baseline but lacks specific features to enhance stability.
    *   **Complex 2:** This complex features a very large, planar ancillary ligand. Such structures are known to promote strong intermolecular interactions (pi-pi stacking). This aggregation is often a source of luminescence quenching and can accelerate device degradation.
    *   **Complex 3 ([Ir(dfppy)2(dtbbpy)]+):** This complex has two critical modifications compared to Complex 1:
        a) **Fluorination:** The phenyl rings of the main ligands are fluorinated. The high electronegativity of fluorine makes the complex more electron-deficient. This lowers the HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) energy level, making the complex more resistant to oxidative degradation, which is a primary cause of LEC failure.
        b) **Bulky Groups:** The bipyridine ligand is substituted with two bulky tert-butyl groups. These groups act as steric shields, preventing the complex molecules from getting too close to each other. This effectively suppresses the aggregation-caused quenching that is likely to be a problem for Complex 2.

2.  **Compare for Stability:**
    *   **Complex 3 vs. Complex 1:** Complex 3 is superior due to both electronic stabilization from fluorine atoms and steric protection from tert-butyl groups.
    *   **Complex 3 vs. Complex 2:** Complex 3 is designed to prevent aggregation, while the planar ligand in Complex 2 is likely to enhance it. Therefore, Complex 3 should be much more stable.

3.  **Conclusion:**
    *   By combining electronic stabilization (fluorination) and steric hindrance (bulky groups), Complex 3 is rationally designed to have superior operational stability compared to the other two complexes.
