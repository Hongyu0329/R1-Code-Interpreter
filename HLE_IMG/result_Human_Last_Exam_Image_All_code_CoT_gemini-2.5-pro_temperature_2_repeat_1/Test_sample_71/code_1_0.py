    """
    This function identifies and prints the name of Compound A based on the reaction analysis.
    The reaction is the synthesis of Trioxatriangulenium tetrafluoroborate.
    The reagents are 1) pyridinium HCl at 200 C and 2) HBF4.
    Pyridinium HCl at high temperature is a known reagent for the demethylation of aryl methyl ethers.
    Literature search reveals that a similar reaction uses 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexamethoxytriphenylene
    as the starting material to produce the given product.
    Therefore, Compound A is 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexamethoxytriphenylene.
