    "My plan to solve this is to first visually inspect the tiling to identify points of rotational symmetry. I will look for a point around which the pattern can be rotated by some angle less than 360 degrees and still look identical.\n\n1.  **Identify a center of rotation:** I will examine the center of the geometric shapes in the tiling. A good candidate is the center of one of the dark blue regular hexagons.\n2.  **Count the repeating units:** I will count how many times the surrounding pattern repeats itself around this central point. Around the central blue hexagon, there are six identical clusters of yellow squares and orange rhombi.\n3.  **Determine the order of symmetry:** The number of times the pattern repeats in a full 360-degree rotation gives the order of rotational symmetry, denoted by 'n'. In this case, it appears to be 6.\n4.  **Calculate the angle of rotation:** The angle for this symmetry is calculated as 360 divided by the order 'n'.\n5.  **Final conclusion:** Based on this analysis, the highest order of rotational symmetry in the tiling is 6. I will use the Python code to present this logical deduction and the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the rotational symmetry of the provided tiling.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Analyze the tiling to find a center of rotation.\n    # By observing the tiling, we can choose the center of a dark blue hexagon\n    # as a center of rotation.\n    \n    # Step 2: Count the number of times the pattern repeats around this center.\n    # Around the center of a blue hexagon, we can see the pattern is built from\n    # 6 identical surrounding motifs.
