    "To determine the molecular formula of the final product, we need to analyze the reaction sequence step by step and track the changes in atomic composition.\n\n**Analysis of the Reaction Scheme:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Starting Material → Intermediate 1**\n    *   **Reaction:** Deprotection using CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate).\n    *   **Transformation:** The starting material has a PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) protecting group on the nitrogen atom. CAN is used to remove this group. The PMB group (formula: `C8H9O`) is cleaved, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Intermediate 1 → Intermediate 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C and H₂.\n    *   **Transformation:** This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond within the bicyclic ring system. This means two hydrogen atoms (`H₂`) are added to the molecule.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Intermediate 2 → Product**\n    *   **Reaction:** Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis with 4 N HCl at 70 °C.\n    *   **Transformation:** Intermediate 2 contains a lactam (a cyclic amide). Hot acid hydrolyzes the amide bond (`-C(=O)-N-`). This process consumes one molecule of water (`H₂O`), breaking the ring and forming a carboxylic acid (`-COOH`) and an amine (`-NH₂`).\n\nWe can calculate the final molecular formula by starting with the initial compound and applying these changes sequentially. The following Python script automates this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_molecular_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product of a three-step reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 0: Determine the formula of the starting material.\n    # The core structure (6-trifluoromethyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one) is C7H6F3NO.\n    # The PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) group is C8H9O.\n    # Starting Material = Core - H + PMB = C15H14F3NO2.\n    atoms = {'C': 15, 'H': 14, 'F': 3, 'N': 1, 'O': 2}\n    print(f\"The analysis begins with the starting material, which has the molecular formula C{atoms['C']}H{atoms['H']}F{atoms['F']}N{atoms['N']}O{atoms['O']}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 1: Deprotection of PMB group with CAN.\n    # This removes the PMB group (C8H9O) and adds one Hydrogen atom.\n    c_change_1 = -8\n    h_change_1 = -9 + 1\n    o_change_1 = -1\n    atoms['C'] += c_change_1\n    atoms['H'] += h_change_1\n    atoms['O'] += o_change_1\n    print(\"Step 1: CAN removes the PMB group (C8H9O) and adds one Hydrogen.\")\n    print(f\"Change in atoms: C: {c_change_1}, H: {h_change_1}, O: {o_change_1}.\")\n    print(f\"Formula of Intermediate 1: C{atoms['C']}H{atoms['H']}F{atoms['F']}N{atoms['N']}O{atoms['O']}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Hydrogenation with Pd/C, H2.\n    # This adds two Hydrogen atoms to reduce the C=C double bond.\n    h_change_2 = 2\n    atoms['H'] += h_change_2\n    print(\"Step 2: Hydrogenation with Pd/C and H2 reduces the double bond.\")\n    print(f\"Change in atoms: H: +{h_change_2}.\")\n    print(f\"Formula of Intermediate 2: C{atoms['C']}H{atoms['H']}F{atoms['F']}N{atoms['N']}O{atoms['O']}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Hydrolysis with HCl.\n    # This adds one water molecule (H2O) to break the lactam ring.\n    h_change_3 = 2\n    o_change_3 = 1\n    atoms['H'] += h_change_3\n    atoms['O'] += o_change_3\n    print(\"Step 3: Acidic hydrolysis adds one water molecule (H2O).\")\n    print(f\"Change in atoms: H: +{h_change_3}, O: +{o_change_3}.\")\n    print(f\"Final Product Formula: C{atoms['C']}H{atoms['H']}F{atoms['F']}N{atoms['N']}O{atoms['O']}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Final Answer\n    print(\"The molecular formula of the final product is composed of:\")\n    print(f\"Carbon (C): {atoms['C']}\")\n    print(f\"Hydrogen (H): {atoms['H']}\")\n    print(f\"Fluorine (F): {atoms['F']}\")\n    print(f\"Nitrogen (N): {atoms['N']}\")\n    print(f\"Oxygen (O): {atoms['O']}\")\n\nsolve_molecular_formula()\n```\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
