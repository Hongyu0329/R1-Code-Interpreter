The main difference in the sporophyte is the seta. In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is very short and straight, making the capsule appear immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctive long and curved (arcuate) seta, which exserts the capsule well above the leaves.
