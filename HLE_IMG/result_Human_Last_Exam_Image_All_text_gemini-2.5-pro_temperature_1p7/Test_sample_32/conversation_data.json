    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to distinguish the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe question asks for the primary, easily observable difference in the sporophyte generation between two moss species: *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. The sporophyte in a moss consists of the foot (which attaches it to the gametophyte), the seta (stalk), and the capsule (which contains spores).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Sporophyte of *Grimmia montana***\n*   **Seta:** In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is very short and straight.\n*   **Capsule Position:** Because the seta is so short, the capsule is either **immersed** (completely sunken within the upper leaves) or **emergent** (peeking out just slightly from the leaves).\n*   **At a Glance:** The capsules appear almost sessile (stalkless) and are nestled down amongst the tips of the leafy stems.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta***\n*   **Seta:** The name *curviseta* provides a major clue. \"Curvi\" is from Latin for 'curved' and \"seta\" is the stalk. *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by having a distinctly **curved or arcuate seta**. This seta is also relatively long.\n*   **Capsule Position:** The long, curved seta causes the capsule to be **exserted** (raised well above the leaves) and typically bent over to one side.\n*   **At a Glance:** The capsules are clearly visible, held away from the main plant on a prominent, arching stalk.\n\n**Step 4: Compare and Identify the Main Difference**\nBy comparing the two, the most striking and immediate difference is the structure and posture of the seta and the resulting position of the capsule.\n\n*   ***Grimmia montana***: Has a **short, straight seta** leading to an **immersed or emergent capsule**.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta***: Has a **long, curved (arcuate) seta** leading to an **exserted, nodding capsule**.\n\n**Conclusion: Careful Points to Note**\n*   **Focus on the Seta:** The key difference lies in the seta's length and curvature.\n*   **Look at Capsule Position:** This difference in the seta directly affects whether the capsule is hidden amongst the leaves (*G. montana*) or held up and away from them (*G. curviseta*).\n*   **Use the Name as a Hint:** The specific epithet *curviseta* literally describes the defining feature of its sporophyte.\n*   **Check for Sporophytes:** This distinction can only be made when the mosses have mature sporophytes. The provided image shows immersed capsules consistent with the description of *Grimmia montana* (or a related species in the *Schistidium* subgenus, which often have immersed capsules), but it clearly lacks the curved, exserted setae of *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation**\nThe principal difference that allows for quick visual identification is the nature of the seta. One is straight and short, while the other is curved and long.\n\n<<<The main difference in the sporophyte is the seta. In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is very short and straight, making the capsule appear immersed among the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* is named for its distinctive long and curved (arcuate) seta, which exserts the capsule well above the leaves."
