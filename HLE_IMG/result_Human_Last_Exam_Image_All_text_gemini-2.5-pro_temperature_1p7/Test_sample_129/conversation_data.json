    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the protein in the image:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The image provided is a cartoon representation of a protein's three-dimensional structure. This type of visualization is common in structural biology to show the folding pattern of the polypeptide chain, including alpha-helices (coils) and beta-sheets (arrows/flat ribbons). The protein appears to consist of a larger domain colored dark blue and a smaller, distinct domain or tail colored light blue. There is also a small yellow stick representation, which typically highlights a specific amino acid side chain of interest, such as a post-translationally modified residue or a residue in an active site.\n\n2.  **Identify the Source using Reverse Image Search:** A reverse image search is the most effective way to find the origin of this specific scientific image. Performing such a search leads to numerous results pointing to the Protein Data Bank (PDB).\n\n3.  **Locate the PDB Entry:** The search results consistently identify this image as a representation of the protein structure with the PDB ID **1JSN**. The PDB is the primary worldwide repository for the 3D structural data of large biological molecules, like proteins and nucleic acids.\n\n4.  **Examine the PDB Entry Details:** Accessing the page for PDB entry 1JSN provides the following information:\n    *   **Title:** The structural basis for the regulation of Csk by phosphorylation.\n    *   **Molecule Name:** C-Src Tyrosine Kinase.\n    *   **Abbreviation:** CSK.\n    *   **Source Organism:** *Gallus gallus* (chicken).\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Information:** The image shows the crystal structure of the C-Src Tyrosine Kinase (CSK). CSK is a crucial enzyme that acts as a negative regulator of another family of proteins called Src-family kinases. The structure shown (1JSN) is a classic example used in textbooks to illustrate how intramolecular interactions (interactions within the same molecule) can control a protein's activity. The light blue segment is the SH3 domain, and the dark blue part comprises the SH2 and kinase domains. These domains interact to hold the enzyme in an inactive, \"closed\" conformation.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the conclusive evidence from the Protein Data Bank, the protein shown in the image is C-Src Tyrosine Kinase.\n\n<<<C-Src Tyrosine Kinase (CSK)>>>"
