The final product, A, is 2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1H-isoindole-1-carbonitrile. Its structure is as follows: a benzene ring is fused to a five-membered aromatic ring (an isoindole system). The nitrogen of the isoindole ring is substituted with a pyridin-2-yl group, and a cyano group (-Câ‰¡N) is attached at the C1 position of the isoindole ring.
