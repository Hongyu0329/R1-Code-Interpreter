    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the process being depicted.\n\n**Step 1: Observation of the Image**\nThe image consists of three panels labeled L, M, and N. Each panel shows a micrograph of a filamentous, elongated structure that is divided into compartments by cross-walls (septa). This morphology is characteristic of a fungal hypha or a filamentous alga. The panels appear to show a time-series or different stages of a process.\n\n**Step 2: Detailed Analysis of Each Panel**\n*   **Panel L:** This panel shows a relatively straight and uniformly shaped filament. The cells appear turgid and intact. An arrowhead points to a septum, the cross-wall between two cells.\n*   **Panel M:** In this panel, the same type of filament is shown. However, at the location indicated by the arrowhead (again, at a septum), the cell wall is bulging outwards. The filament is no longer perfectly straight and appears slightly contorted at the site of the bulge.\n*   **Panel N:** This panel shows a more advanced stage of the process seen in M. The bulge is significantly larger, and the filament is bent at this point. The cell wall appears to have stretched considerably. The overall structure looks weakened and distorted.\n\n**Step 3: Interpretation of the Observed Changes**\nThe progression from L to M to N shows a clear sequence of events:\n1.  A healthy cell (L).\n2.  The development of a localized swelling or bulge in the cell wall (M).\n3.  The expansion of this bulge, leading to major distortion of the cell (N).\n\nThis swelling is caused by a high internal pressure pushing against the cell wall. This pressure, known as turgor pressure, is a result of water entering the cell via osmosis. Osmosis is the net movement of water across a semipermeable membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration.\n\n**Step 4: Relating the Observations to Biological Processes**\n*   **Normal Growth:** Normal growth in fungal hyphae is typically apical, meaning it occurs at the tip. The event shown here is happening in a sub-apical cell, at a septum, and involves swelling rather than directional elongation. So, it is not normal growth.\n*   **Plasmolysis:** Plasmolysis is the process where the cell membrane shrinks and pulls away from the cell wall due to water *loss* in a hypertonic environment. The image shows swelling due to water *gain*, which is the opposite of plasmolysis.\n*   **Cell Division:** Cell division involves the formation of a new septum to divide one cell into two. It does not involve the rupture or bulging of an existing cell wall.\n*   **Osmotic Lysis:** This is the bursting of a cell due to excessive water influx. When a cell with a cell wall is placed in a hypotonic solution (like pure water), water rushes in. The cell wall provides structural resistance to the resulting turgor pressure. However, if the pressure becomes too great for the cell wall to withstand, or if the wall is weakened at a certain point, it will stretch, bulge, and eventually rupture. The process shown in the images—a localized bulge that grows progressively larger under internal pressure—is a classic depiction of the stages leading up to osmotic lysis. The arrowhead highlights the weak point in the cell wall where the lysis is occurring.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the visual evidence of progressive swelling and distortion of the cell wall due to internal pressure, the process being depicted is **osmotic lysis**.\n\n<<<Osmotic lysis>>>"
