    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of splice species.\n\n**Objective:**\nThe goal is to identify all distinct splice species (i.e., unique mature mRNA molecules) revealed by the RT-PCR experiments and count them. A splice species is defined by its unique sequence of exons and its polyadenylation site.\n\n**Analytical Framework:**\n1.  **Divide and Conquer:** We can categorize the mRNAs into two main groups based on their polyadenylation site: **early species** (using the AE site, detected by reverse primers in the early region like E4R and E5R) and **late species** (using the AL site, detected by reverse primers in the late region like L2R and L1R).\n2.  **Count Distinct Bands:** For each category (early and late), we will analyze the gel panels to count the number of distinct PCR products. Each distinct product represents at least one unique splice species.\n3.  **Synthesize Results:** We will combine the counts from the early and late categories, ensuring we don't double-count species, to get the total number. We will use the results from general primers to find the total number of species and the results from splice-specific primers to characterize them.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Part 1: Identifying Early Splice Species**\n\n*   **Panel B (E1F1/E4R):** This PCR uses a general forward primer (E1F1) and an early reverse primer (E4R). Two distinct bands are visible (band 1: 190 bp, band 2: 159 bp). This provides direct evidence for **two distinct early splice species**. Let's call them Early Species 1 and Early Species 2.\n*   **Panel C (E1F1/E5R):** This PCR uses the same forward primer but a downstream early reverse primer (E5R). It also shows two bands (584 bp, 553 bp). The size difference (31 bp) is the same as in Panel B. This result confirms the existence of the first two early species and shows they extend to the E5 region, but it does not introduce new species.\n*   **Panel D (E1F2/E5R):** This PCR uses a splice-specific forward primer, E1F2, which only binds to mRNAs containing the `929^3465` splice junction. It produces a single band (551 bp). This product is generated from an mRNA with a specific splice that is different from those detected by the general E1F1 primer in panel B/C. Therefore, this represents a **third distinct early splice species**.\n*   **Conclusion for Early Species:** We have identified 2 species from Panel B and 1 additional species from Panel D. Total = **3 early splice species**.\n\n**Part 2: Identifying Late Splice Species**\n\n*   **Panel I (E1F1/L1R, 30 cycles):** This is the most informative experiment for counting total late species. It uses the general forward primer (E1F1) located in the common first exon and a reverse primer (L1R) in the last late exon (L1). This PCR setup, especially at a high cycle number (30), is designed to detect all major forms of fully spliced late transcripts. Four distinct bands are visible (band 1: 450 bp, band 2: 419 bp, band 3: 378 bp, band 4: 187 bp). This provides direct evidence for **four distinct late splice species**.\n*   **Panel H (E1F1/L1R, 20 cycles):** This is a less sensitive version of Panel I, showing the two most abundant of the four late species. It doesn't add new species.\n*   **Panel F (E1F2/L2R):** This uses the splice-specific primer E1F2 (`929^3465`). It detects one late transcript (972 bp). This experiment identifies the specific splice junction used in *one* of the four late species detected in Panel I. It does not increase the total count of late species.\n*   **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** This uses the splice-specific primer E1F3 (`929^3506`). It detects two different late transcripts (1003 bp and 931 bp). This experiment identifies the specific splice junction used in *two* more of the four late species from Panel I. It does not increase the total count.\n*   **Panel E (E1F1/L2R):** This panel shows one major band (1005 bp). This band likely corresponds to the most abundant late splice form (probably the one that gives the 1003 bp product in panel G, with the small size difference due to the different forward primer). It serves as a confirmation but doesn't identify a new species beyond the four seen in Panel I.\n*   **Conclusion for Late Species:** The comprehensive experiment in Panel I is the most reliable for the total count, revealing **4 distinct late splice species**. The other panels (E, F, G, H) provide more characterization but do not increase this total number.\n\n**Part 3: Final Calculation**\n\nThe total number of unique splice species is the sum of the distinct early species and the distinct late species.\n*   Number of Early Species = 3\n*   Number of Late Species = 4\n*   Total Splice Species = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n**Summary of Identified Species:**\n*   **Early (3 species):**\n    1.  One detected by E1F1/E4R (190 bp band).\n    2.  A second, alternatively spliced form detected by E1F1/E4R (159 bp band).\n    3.  A third form using the `929^3465` splice junction, detected by E1F2/E5R (551 bp band).\n*   **Late (4 species):**\n    4.  A late transcript detected by E1F1/L1R (450 bp band).\n    5.  A second late transcript detected by E1F1/L1R (419 bp band).\n    6.  A third late transcript detected by E1F1/L1R (378 bp band).\n    7.  A fourth late transcript detected by E1F1/L1R (187 bp band).\n\nBased on the evidence from all panels, there are a total of 7 distinct splice species.\n\n<<<7>>>"
