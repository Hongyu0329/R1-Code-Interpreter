    "Step-by-step analysis:\nThe task is to identify the author of each of the 9 artworks displayed in a 3x3 grid, proceeding from left to right and top to bottom. The identification will be based on style, subject matter, and any visible signatures or seals.\n\n**Row 1:**\n\n1.  **Top Left:** This is a Chinese ink and color painting depicting women from an ethnic minority, likely the Yi people, identifiable by their elaborate headdresses. The style combines delicate, realistic rendering of the faces with expressive, powerful brushwork for the clothing and background. The signature in the top right is faint, but the artistic style is highly characteristic of **Shi Qi (石齐)**, a contemporary master known for blending traditional techniques with modern expressionism and bold use of color.\n\n2.  **Top Middle:** This is an ink sketch of a landscape with buildings, possibly a waterside town. The style is characterized by strong, wiry, and structural lines, focusing on the abstract beauty of forms. This is a very recognizable style of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**, who was famous for his on-location sketches that captured the essence and rhythm of a scene. This specific work is a well-known sketch of Shaoxing.\n\n3.  **Top Right:** This is a piece of Chinese calligraphy in a vigorous running-cursive script. The characters are powerful, dynamic, and have a unique, unrestrained quality. This distinctive calligraphic style is known as \"Mao-style\" (毛体), and the signature at the end clearly reads \"毛泽东\" (**Mao Zedong**).\n\n**Row 2:**\n\n4.  **Middle Left:** This is another example of Chinese calligraphy. The script is energetic, and the signature at the end reads \"白石\" (Baishi). This, along with the style of the seals, identifies the artist as **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**. While famous for his paintings, he was also a master calligrapher and seal carver.\n\n5.  **Center:** This is a realist oil painting depicting a young woman in a white t-shirt, holding a paintbrush and sketchbook. The style is highly refined and academic. This is a famous portrait by **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**, a leading figure of Chinese Neo-Classicism in oil painting. The work is titled \"画家\" (The Painter), created in 1984.\n\n6.  **Middle Right:** This is a modern Chinese ink painting of a lady in traditional attire. The composition is typically square, and the style is a distinctive fusion of Chinese ink wash and Western fauvist color and form. The gentle, melancholic expression of the subject is also a common feature. These are all hallmarks of the pioneering modern artist **Lin Fengmian (林风眠)**.\n\n**Row 3:**\n\n7.  **Bottom Left:** This painting shows a vibrant scene of a courtyard with hanging loofah gourds and laundry. It is characterized by its bright colors, strong design, and the blending of Western compositional elements with Chinese brushwork to depict the beauty of rural life. The signature in the bottom right is \"吴冠中\" (**Wu Guanzhong**), and the style is unmistakably his. The work is titled \"墙上秋色\" (Autumn Colors on the Wall).\n\n8.  **Bottom Middle:** This is a Chinese landscape painting (shan-shui) of a river gorge with a fleet of boats. The style is monumental and powerful, created using layers of dark ink (a technique called 'jimo' or accumulated ink) to create a sense of depth and mass. This particular style and subject matter (scenes from the Li River or Yangtze Gorges) are the signature of the master **Li Keran (李可染)**.\n\n9.  **Bottom Right:** This is an ink painting of a spiny lobster. The depiction is incredibly lifelike and vibrant, showcasing masterful brush control to capture the creature's texture and form. Painting aquatic life, especially shrimp and lobsters, with such liveliness and skill was a specialty of **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**. The red seal in the corner further confirms his authorship.\n\n**Final list of authors:**\nBased on the analysis, the authors for the nine works, from left to right, top to bottom, are:\n1.  Shi Qi\n2.  Wu Guanzhong\n3.  Mao Zedong\n4.  Qi Baishi\n5.  Jin Shangyi\n6.  Lin Fengmian\n7.  Wu Guanzhong\n8.  Li Keran\n9.  Qi Baishi\n\n<<<Shi Qi, Wu Guanzhong, Mao Zedong, Qi Baishi, Jin Shangyi, Lin Fengmian, Wu Guanzhong, Li Keran, Qi Baishi>>>"
