    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual elements of the image.**\n    The image is from a Greek red-figure vase. We see a central scene involving a chariot.\n    *   **The Chariot and its Occupants:** A chariot is moving towards the left. In the chariot, there are two figures. The one holding the reins and a goad is actively driving. This figure wears an ornate, non-Greek headdress (often identified as a Phrygian cap) and a patterned sleeve, which in Greek art often signifies a person from the East, a \"barbarian,\" or a mythological figure of foreign origin. The second figure in the chariot is mostly draped in cloth and appears passive, being held by the driver.\n    *   **Surrounding Figures and Elements:** Large white wings are visible above the driver, suggesting the chariot is magical and capable of flight. Below the chariot, a naked male figure lies contorted on the ground, apparently dead. To the left, the rear of a horse (or a similar winged creature) pulling the chariot is visible. The decoration on the vase includes ornamental palmettes and a wave pattern below the main scene.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the mythological scene.**\n    The combination of a female figure in foreign attire, a magical flying chariot, and dead children is highly characteristic of one specific Greek myth: the story of Medea.\n    *   **Medea:** Medea was a powerful sorceress from Colchis (a kingdom on the Black Sea). In Greek art, she is often depicted in \"oriental\" or Phrygian dress to emphasize her foreign origins.\n    *   **The Story:** After being abandoned by her husband Jason in the city of Corinth, Medea enacts a terrible revenge. She murders Jason's new wife, Glauce, and then kills her own two sons to cause Jason the ultimate pain.\n    *   **The Escape:** To escape Jason's wrath, Medea flees Corinth in a flying chariot sent by her grandfather, the sun god Helios. This chariot is often shown drawn by winged dragons or serpents. She takes the bodies of her sons with her, refusing to allow Jason to bury them.\n\n*   **Step 3: Relate the visual elements to the myth and answer the question.**\n    *   The driving figure in the Phrygian cap is **Medea**.\n    *   The dead figure on the ground and the passive, draped figure in the chariot are her two murdered sons.\n    *   The scene depicts the climax of the story: Medea's departure from Corinth in Helios's chariot after committing infanticide.\n    *   The question asks, \"Who is the figure leaving the chariot?\". This phrasing is slightly ambiguous. It could refer to the dead boy on the ground who has been cast out. However, the verb \"leaving\" implies an active departure. The primary action in the scene is Medea's dramatic exit from Corinth. Therefore, the question most logically refers to the central figure who is actively leaving the scene of her revenge in the chariot. This person is Medea. She is the figure whose departure is the entire subject of the composition.\n\n*   **Final conclusion:** Based on the iconic elements of the scene—the foreign-dressed woman, the flying chariot, and the dead children—the central figure driving the chariot is Medea, escaping from Corinth. She is the \"figure leaving\" in the sense that she is departing the city.\n\n<<<Medea>>>"
