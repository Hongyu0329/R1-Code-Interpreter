    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** The reaction shows a polycyclic alcohol reacting with catalytic acid (HCl) and heat, producing an alkene and water. This is an acid-catalyzed dehydration reaction. Given the complex polycyclic nature of the starting material (a triterpenoid) and the change in the carbon skeleton, this is a classic Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, specifically known as a \"backbone rearrangement\".\n\n2.  **Propose a mechanism:** The reaction is initiated by the protonation of the hydroxyl (-OH) group by the acid, forming a good leaving group, water (-OH₂⁺).\n\n3.  **Formation of the initial carbocation:** The water molecule departs, leaving a secondary carbocation at the carbon atom originally bonded to the hydroxyl group (C-3 using standard numbering).\n\n4.  **Cascade of [1,2] shifts:** Carbocations rearrange to form more stable carbocations. In this case, a cascade of [1,2]-hydride (H⁻) and [1,2]-methide (CH₃⁻) shifts occurs, moving the positive charge across the molecular backbone. The driving force is the formation of more stable (tertiary) carbocations at each step.\n\n5.  **Trace the migrating groups:** We need to track the position of each methyl group (CH₃) and hydrogen (H) that participates in the rearrangement. Let's follow the chain of events:\n    *   **Start:** Carbocation at C-3.\n    *   **Shift 1 ([1,2]-methide):** A methyl group from the adjacent quaternary carbon C-4 migrates to C-3. The positive charge is now at C-4 (a more stable tertiary carbocation).\n    *   **Shift 2 ([1,2]-hydride):** The hydrogen atom at C-5 migrates to C-4. The positive charge moves to C-5 (tertiary carbocation).\n    *   **Shift 3 ([1,2]-methide):** The methyl group at the C-10 ring junction migrates to C-5. The positive charge moves to C-10 (tertiary carbocation).\n    *   **Shift 4 ([1,2]-hydride):** The hydrogen atom at the C-9 ring junction migrates to C-10. The positive charge moves to C-9 (tertiary carbocation).\n    *   **Shift 5 ([1,2]-methide):** The methyl group at the C-8 ring junction migrates to C-9. The positive charge moves to C-8 (tertiary carbocation).\n    *   **Shift 6 ([1,2]-methide):** The methyl group at the C-14 ring junction migrates to C-8. The positive charge moves to C-14 (tertiary carbocation).\n    *   **Shift 7 ([1,2]-hydride):** The hydrogen atom at the C-13 ring junction migrates to C-14. The positive charge moves to C-13 (tertiary carbocation).\n\n6.  **Formation of the final product (Elimination):** The rearrangement cascade stops when the cation is at C-13. To form the final alkene, a proton (H⁺) is eliminated from an adjacent carbon. The product shows a tetrasubstituted double bond between rings D and E (a Δ¹³(¹⁸)-ene), which is formed by losing a proton from C-18.\n\n7.  **Determine the substituents at positions 1-5:** Now we can determine what substituent ends up at each labeled position in the final rearranged product.\n    *   **Position 1:** This is on carbon C-4. In the reactant, C-4 had two methyl groups. During the rearrangement (Shift 1), one methyl group migrated away to C-3. The other methyl group remained at C-4. Thus, the substituent at position 1 is **CH₃**.\n    *   **Position 2 & 3:** These are on carbon C-10. In the reactant, C-10 had one methyl group (in the \"up\" or beta position). During the rearrangement (Shift 4), it accepted a hydrogen atom from C-9 (which was in the \"down\" or alpha position). Therefore, the final C-10 has the original methyl group (beta) and the migrated hydrogen atom (alpha). Position 2 is beta, and position 3 is alpha. So, 2 = **CH₃** and 3 = **H**.\n    *   **Position 4:** This is on carbon C-8. The original methyl group at C-8 migrated to C-9 (Shift 5). Later, C-8 (as a carbocation) accepted a methyl group from C-14 (Shift 6). This migrating methyl group from C-14 was in the beta position. Thus, the substituent at position 4 (beta) is **CH₃**.\n    *   **Position 5:** This is on carbon C-14. The original methyl group at C-14 migrated to C-8 (Shift 6). Later, C-14 (as a carbocation) accepted a hydrogen atom from C-13 (Shift 7). This migrating hydrogen was in the alpha position. Thus, the substituent at position 5 (alpha) is **H**.\n\n**Summary of substituents:**\n*   1 = CH₃\n*   2 = CH₃\n*   3 = H\n*   4 = CH₃\n*   5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
