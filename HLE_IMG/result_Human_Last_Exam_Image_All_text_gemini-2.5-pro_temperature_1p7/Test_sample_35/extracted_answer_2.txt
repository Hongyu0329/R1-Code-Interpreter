The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the **V-domain** of the **Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products (RAGE)**.

This protein could be used as a **prognostic marker** rather than solely an adjunct marker. Here's the explanation:

*   **Adjunct Marker Role:** S100B is involved in numerous disorders (Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, MS, cardiovascular disease), so it lacks the specificity to diagnose any single condition on its own. In this capacity, it can serve as an **adjunct marker** to indicate the presence of general neuroinflammation.
*   **Prognostic Marker Role:** More importantly, the diagram shows a direct causal relationship between S100B and the progression of pathology. The binding of S100B to RAGE activates downstream pathways (like NFκB and JNK/JUN) that lead directly to **neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration**. Therefore, the concentration of S100B is not just a side effect but a driver of the disease process. A higher level of S100B would predict a more aggressive disease course and a worse outcome, which is the precise function of a prognostic marker.
