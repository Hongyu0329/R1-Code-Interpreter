    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe circuit consists of an infinite resistor ladder network connected to an input source at `IN` (node $g_0$) and terminated by a capacitor `C` at the output node $a_0$. We need to find the cutoff frequency at this node.\n\nThe cutoff frequency of an RC filter is determined by its time constant, $\\tau = R_{eq}C$, where $R_{eq}$ is the equivalent resistance \"seen\" by the capacitor. This equivalent resistance is the Thévenin equivalent resistance ($R_{th}$) of the network looking into terminals $a_0$ and $b_0$ (ground).\n\nThe cutoff angular frequency is given by $\\omega_c = 1/\\tau = 1/(R_{th}C)$. Our primary task is to calculate $R_{th}$.\n\n**2. Calculating the Thévenin Resistance ($R_{th}$)**\n\nTo find $R_{th}$, we must deactivate all independent sources. The input `IN` is a voltage source, so we set it to zero by grounding the node $g_0$. Then, we calculate the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground.\n\nLet $u_n$ be the voltage at node $d_n$ and $v_n$ be the voltage at node $c_n$ for $n \\ge 1$. Let $u_0$ be the voltage at node $a_0$ and $v_0$ be the voltage at node $g_0$. For calculating $R_{th}$, we have $v_0=0$ since $g_0$ is grounded.\n\nWe can write the Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) equations at a generic node pair $(c_n, d_n)$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nKCL at node $c_n$ ($n \\ge 1$):\n$\\frac{v_n - v_{n-1}}{r} + \\frac{v_n - v_{n+1}}{r} + \\frac{v_n - u_n}{r} = 0$\n$3v_n - v_{n-1} - v_{n+1} - u_n = 0$  (Eq. 1)\n\nKCL at node $d_n$ ($n \\ge 1$):\n$\\frac{u_n - u_{n-1}}{r} + \\frac{u_n - u_{n+1}}{r} + \\frac{u_n - v_n}{r} = 0$\n$3u_n - u_{n-1} - u_{n+1} - v_n = 0$  (Eq. 2)\nNote that for $n=1$, $u_{n-1}$ is $u_0$ and $v_{n-1}$ is $v_0$.\n\nThese are a system of coupled linear difference equations. We seek solutions of the form $u_n = Ak^n$ and $v_n = Bk^n$. Substituting these into the equations (for $n>1$) yields:\n$A(-\\lambda) + B(1) = 0$\n$A(1) + B(-\\lambda) = 0$\nwhere $\\lambda = k + 1/k - 3$. This system has non-trivial solutions if the determinant is zero, i.e., $\\lambda^2 - 1 = 0$, so $\\lambda = \\pm 1$.\n\n*   Case $\\lambda=1$: $k + 1/k - 3 = 1 \\implies k^2 - 4k + 1 = 0 \\implies k = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}$. Also $\\lambda=1 \\implies B=A$.\n*   Case $\\lambda=-1$: $k + 1/k - 3 = -1 \\implies k^2 - 2k + 1 = 0 \\implies k = 1$ (repeated root). Also $\\lambda=-1 \\implies B=-A$. No, that's not right. Let's re-write the coefficient matrix for $(A, B)$:\n    `[ -1     3-k-1/k ]`\n    `[ 3-k-1/k  -1    ]` has determinant zero. So `(3-k-1/k)^2=1`. This gives `3-k-1/k = +/- 1`.\n    `3-k-1/k = 1 \\implies k^2 - 2k + 1 = 0 \\implies k=1$. This corresponds to `v_n = u_n`.\n    `3-k-1/k = -1 \\implies k^2 - 4k + 1 = 0 \\implies k=2\\pm\\sqrt{3}`. This corresponds to `v_n = -u_n`.\n\nLet's use summation and difference: `s_n = u_n + v_n`, `d_n = u_n - v_n`.\nAdding (1) and (2): $3(u_n+v_n) - (u_{n-1}+v_{n-1}) - (u_{n+1}+v_{n+1}) - (u_n+v_n)=0 \\implies 2s_n - s_{n-1} - s_{n+1} = 0$.\nSubtracting (1) from (2): $3(u_n-v_n) - (u_{n-1}-v_{n-1}) - (u_{n+1}-v_{n+1}) + (u_n-v_n)=0 \\implies 4d_n - d_{n-1} - d_{n+1} = 0$.\n\nThe solutions are $s_n = A(1)^n + B n(1)^n$ and $d_n = C(2-\\sqrt{3})^n + D(2+\\sqrt{3})^n$.\nFor the voltages to be finite as $n \\to \\infty$, we must have $B=0$ and $D=0$.\nSo, $u_n + v_n = A$ and $u_n - v_n = C(2-\\sqrt{3})^n$.\nLet $k = 2-\\sqrt{3}$.\n$u_n = \\frac{1}{2}(A + Ck^n)$\n$v_n = \\frac{1}{2}(A - Ck^n)$\n\nNow, we apply boundary conditions for the $R_{th}$ calculation:\n1.  $v_0=0$ (input grounded). `v_0` corresponds to `n=0`.\n    $v_0 = \\frac{1}{2}(A - Ck^0) = \\frac{1}{2}(A - C) = 0 \\implies A=C$.\nSo the solution is of the form $u_n = A'(1+k^n)$ and $v_n = A'(1-k^n)$ for some constant $A'$. This holds for $n \\ge 0$.\n\n2.  To find $R_{th}$, we imagine applying a voltage $u_0$ at node $a_0$ and finding the resulting current $I_0$ flowing into the node.\n    $I_0 = (u_0 - u_1)/r$.\n    $R_{th} = u_0/I_0 = \\frac{u_0}{(u_0-u_1)/r} = r \\frac{u_0}{u_0-u_1}$.\n\nWe use our solution to find the ratio $u_1/u_0$:\n$u_0 = A'(1+k^0) = 2A'$.\n$u_1 = A'(1+k^1) = A'(1+k)$.\nSo, $R_{th} = r \\frac{2A'}{2A' - A'(1+k)} = r \\frac{2}{1-k}$.\n\nSubstitute $k = 2 - \\sqrt{3}$:\n$R_{th} = r \\frac{2}{1 - (2 - \\sqrt{3})} = r \\frac{2}{-1 + \\sqrt{3}} = r \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}$.\nTo simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by $(\\sqrt{3} + 1)$:\n$R_{th} = r \\frac{2(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\\sqrt{3} - 1)(\\sqrt{3} + 1)} = r \\frac{2(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = r \\frac{2(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = (1+\\sqrt{3})r$.\n\n**3. Determining the Cutoff Frequency**\n\nThe node $a_0$ sees a simple RC circuit consisting of the Thévenin resistance $R_{th}$ and the capacitor $C$.\nThe time constant of this RC circuit is $\\tau = R_{th}C$.\n$\\tau = (1+\\sqrt{3})rC$.\n\nThe cutoff angular frequency, $\\omega_c$, is the frequency at which the magnitude of the transfer function is $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its DC value. For a first-order low-pass filter, this is given by:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $R_{th}$:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{(1+\\sqrt{3})rC}$.\n\nThe cutoff frequency $f_c$ is $\\omega_c/(2\\pi)$. The question asks for the \"cutoff frequency\" expressed in terms of $r$ and $C$, which is conventionally the angular frequency $\\omega_c$.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe cutoff frequency at node $a_0$ is the angular frequency $\\omega_c$ where the impedance of the capacitor matches the Thévenin equivalent resistance of the ladder network.\n$R_{th} = (1+\\sqrt{3})r$.\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{(1+\\sqrt{3})rC}$.\n\n<<<1/((1+sqrt(3))*r*C)>>>"
