    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the jazz standard from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Key and Time Signature**\n*   **Key Signature:** The key signature at the beginning of the staff shows one flat (B♭). This indicates the key of F Major or its relative minor, D minor.\n*   **Tonic Chord:** The first chord written is \"F-\", which signifies an F minor chord. This, along with the overall harmonic context, strongly suggests the piece is in the key of **F minor**.\n*   **Time Signature:** Although not explicitly written as a fraction (like 4/4), the grouping of notes within each measure (e.g., a dotted quarter, an eighth, and a half note in the first measure) adds up to four beats, indicating a **4/4** time signature, which is common for jazz standards.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Melody (The \"Head\")**\nLet's transcribe the melody for the first few bars:\n*   **Measure 1 (over F- chord):** The notes are C, B♭, A. The melody starts on the tonic's fifth (C) and descends step-by-step.\n*   **Measure 2 (over E-7♭5 chord):** The notes are A♭, G, F. The descending melodic sequence continues.\n*   **Measure 3 (over E♭-6 chord):** The notes are G, F, E♭. The pattern of stepwise descent continues.\nThis distinctive, melancholic, and sequentially descending melodic theme is a very strong clue.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Chord Progression**\nLet's examine the sequence of chords, which is crucial for identifying jazz standards.\n*   **\"A\" Section (First 8 bars):**\n    *   `F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7 | C7 | F- | 1. C7 || 2. C7`\n    *   This progression features a chromatic bass line descent (F -> E -> Eb) under minor-type chords. This is a hallmark feature of the song. The G7 to C7 to F- is a standard cadence in F minor.\n*   **\"B\" Section / Bridge (starting at measure 9):**\n    *   `D-7b5 | G7 | C7 | F7 | Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab | G C7 |`\n    *   This progression follows a common jazz pattern, moving through a series of ii-V changes that modulate temporarily. The D-7b5 to G7 resolves towards C. The C7 acts as a V of F7, which is the V of Bb-7. The Bb-7 to Eb7 is a ii-V leading to Ab. This entire harmonic journey is characteristic of this specific tune's bridge.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Song**\n*   The combination of the key (F minor), the unique stepwise descending melody (C-Bb-A | Ab-G-F | etc.), and the specific chromatic and ii-V chord progressions in both the A and B sections are all definitive characteristics of the jazz standard **\"Yesterdays\"**.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Composer**\n*   \"Yesterdays\" is a classic song from the Great American Songbook. The music was composed by **Jerome Kern** for the 1933 musical \"Roberta,\" with lyrics by Otto Harbach.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of the melody and harmony presented in the sheet music, the jazz standard is \"Yesterdays\" by Jerome Kern.\n\n<<<Title: Yesterdays, Composer: Jerome Kern>>>"
