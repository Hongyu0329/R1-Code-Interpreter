    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the subject:** The central subject of the image is an insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers.\n2.  **Observe the insect's morphology:**\n    *   **Order:** The insect has piercing-sucking mouthparts (not clearly visible but inferred from its class) and wings that are partially hardened and partially membranous (hemelytra), which are characteristic features of the order Hemiptera, commonly known as \"true bugs.\"\n    *   **Coloration:** The insect exhibits a distinct warning coloration (aposematism) of black and bright orange-red.\n    *   **Head:** The head is black with a prominent orange-red marking on top.\n    *   **Thorax (Pronotum):** The section behind the head (pronotum) is mostly orange-red with black markings.\n    *   **Wings (Hemelytra):** The wings are folded over the back, creating a pattern. The leathery part of the wings is primarily black, marked with an orange-red 'X' shape.\n    *   **Appendages:** The legs and antennae are black.\n3.  **Observe the plant:** The insect is on a plant with numerous small, bright yellow flowers clustered together on a stalk. This plant is characteristic of goldenrod (*Solidago* species). The presence on this plant can be a clue to the insect's identity.\n4.  **Identify the specific insect:** Based on the distinctive orange-red 'X' on the black wings, the coloration of the head and thorax, and its presence on a flowering plant like goldenrod (where they often feed on seeds), the insect can be identified as the Small Milkweed Bug. While they are named for their primary host plant, milkweed, they are also frequently found on other plants.\n5.  **Determine the scientific name:** The common name for this insect is the Small Milkweed Bug. Its scientific name is composed of a genus and a species. The correct scientific name for the Small Milkweed Bug is *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is important not to confuse this insect with similar-looking species like the Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*), which has a different pattern (broad orange bands instead of an 'X'), or the Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*), which has a more slender body and different markings (typically red lines outlining the wings and thorax).\n*   The question specifically asks for the \"scientific name,\" which requires providing both the genus and species name (binomial nomenclature).\n*   Verifying the insect's features against reliable entomological resources confirms the identification. The 'X' pattern is a key diagnostic feature for *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"
