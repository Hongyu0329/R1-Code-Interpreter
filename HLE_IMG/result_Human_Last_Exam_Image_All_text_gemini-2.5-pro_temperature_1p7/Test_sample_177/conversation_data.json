    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Analysis of the Question and Methodology**\n\nThe goal is to calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by comparing the Baseline scenario (Table 1) with the Proposed scenario (Table 2).\n\n1.  **Define Car VMT:** VMT stands for Vehicle Miles Traveled. It measures the total distance traveled by all vehicles. For this problem, we are interested only in cars. The distance a car travels is independent of how many people are inside it. Therefore, the `Average Carpool Occupancy` values are not needed for this calculation.\n2.  **Calculation Approach:** The total Car VMT is the sum of VMT from all trip distance categories. To get the VMT for a single category, we must multiply the number of car trips in that category by the average distance for that category.\n3.  **Relative VMT:** Since we are looking for a percentage change, we don't need the absolute total number of trips. We can calculate a \"relative VMT\" index for both scenarios. This index can be calculated as a weighted sum, where each distance category's contribution is:\n    `(Share of Total Trips) x (Total Car Mode Share for that distance) x (Average Trip Distance)`\n4.  **Formula for Percentage Reduction:**\n    `Percentage Reduction = ((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100%`\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Weighting is Crucial:** It's essential to use the `share of total trips` row to properly weight the VMT contribution from each distance category. A simple average would be incorrect.\n*   **Total Car Share:** For each distance category, the total car share must be calculated by summing the percentages for `car, 1 occupant` and `car, with more than 2 occupants`.\n*   **Irrelevant Data:** The `Average Carpool Occupancy` is distractor information for calculating VMT (it would be relevant for calculating Person Miles Traveled, or PMT). The VMT for a 10-mile trip is 10 miles, whether there is 1 occupant or 3.\n*   **Data Consistency:** The `share of total trips` and `Average trip distance` values are identical in both tables, which simplifies the comparison. The only variables that change are the mode shares within each distance bracket.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Relative Car VMT for the Baseline (Table 1)**\n\nWe will calculate the VMT contribution for each distance category and then sum them.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 25% + 28% = 53%\n    *   VMT Contribution = (48% of trips) * (53% by car) * (1 mile/trip) = 0.48 * 0.53 * 1 = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   VMT Contribution = (22% of trips) * (81% by car) * (4 miles/trip) = 0.22 * 0.81 * 4 = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   VMT Contribution = (14% of trips) * (85% by car) * (7.5 miles/trip) = 0.14 * 0.85 * 7.5 = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   VMT Contribution = (16% of trips) * (89% by car) * (20 miles/trip) = 0.16 * 0.89 * 20 = 2.8480\n\n*   **Total Baseline Relative VMT** = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Relative Car VMT for the Proposed (Table 2)**\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   VMT Contribution = (48% of trips) * (3% by car) * (1 mile/trip) = 0.48 * 0.03 * 1 = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   VMT Contribution = (22% of trips) * (27% by car) * (4 miles/trip) = 0.22 * 0.27 * 4 = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   VMT Contribution = (14% of trips) * (41% by car) * (7.5 miles/trip) = 0.14 * 0.41 * 7.5 = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   VMT Contribution = (16% of trips) * (49% by car) * (20 miles/trip) = 0.16 * 0.49 * 20 = 1.5680\n\n*   **Total Proposed Relative VMT** = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\n*   **VMT Reduction** = Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT) * 100\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100 = 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
