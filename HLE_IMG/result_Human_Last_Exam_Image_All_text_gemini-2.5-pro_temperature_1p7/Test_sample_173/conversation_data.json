    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the time signature of the provided musical measure.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Task:** The goal is to find the time signature, which tells us how many beats are in a measure and what type of note gets one beat. We need to \"count the beats\" in the given measure by summing up the durations of all the notes and rests.\n\n2.  **Analyze Both Staves:** The image shows a grand staff for piano music, with a treble clef (top) and a bass clef (bottom). We can analyze either staff to determine the total duration within the measure. Often, one staff has a rhythm that is easier to count than the other.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Bass Clef (Left Hand - Bottom Staff):**\n    *   The rhythm in the bass clef is very clear.\n    *   The first musical event is a chord (F#, A#, C#) written as a quarter note. This is **Beat 1**.\n    *   The second event is another quarter note chord (G#, B#, D#). This is **Beat 2**.\n    *   The third event is a third quarter note chord (A#, C##, E#). This is **Beat 3**.\n    *   The fourth event is a single quarter note (B). This is **Beat 4**.\n    *   **Conclusion for Bass Clef:** We have a total of four quarter notes. This means there are 4 beats in the measure, and the quarter note gets one beat.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Treble Clef (Right Hand - Top Staff):**\n    *   The rhythm here is more complex, using sixteenth notes and rests. Beaming (the horizontal lines connecting the notes) helps group the notes into beats.\n    *   **Beat 1:** This beat consists of a sixteenth rest followed by three sixteenth notes. The total duration is four sixteenth notes, which is equal to one quarter note.\n    *   **Beat 2:** This beat consists of a sixteenth note, a sixteenth rest, and two more sixteenth notes. Again, the total duration is four sixteenth notes, equal to one quarter note.\n    *   **Beat 3:** This beat is a group of four sixteenth notes. The total duration is four sixteenth notes, equal to one quarter note.\n    *   **Beat 4:** This beat is another group of four sixteenth notes. The total duration is four sixteenth notes, equal to one quarter note.\n    *   **Conclusion for Treble Clef:** We have four groups, each equal to a quarter note in duration. The total is 4 quarter notes.\n\n5.  **Synthesize and Determine the Time Signature:**\n    *   Both the bass clef and the treble clef have a total rhythmic duration equivalent to four quarter notes.\n    *   This tells us that the time signature has a '4' on top (four beats per measure) and a '4' on the bottom (the quarter note gets the beat).\n    *   Therefore, the time signature is **4/4**.\n\n6.  **Match with Answer Choices:**\n    *   A. 2/4 - Incorrect.\n    *   B. 3/4 - Incorrect.\n    *   C. 4/4 - Correct.\n    *   D. 3/8 - Incorrect.\n    *   E. 9/8 - Incorrect.\n\n**Careful points to note:**\n*   Always check both staves. Sometimes one is rhythmically much simpler to analyze.\n*   Pay close attention to beaming. Beams group notes into logical beat units. In 4/4 time, sixteenth notes are often beamed in groups of four.\n*   Correctly identify the duration of each note and rest (quarter note = 1 beat, eighth note = 1/2 beat, sixteenth note = 1/4 beat in common time).\n*   Sum the durations correctly for the entire measure.\n\nThe final analysis confirms that the measure contains four quarter beats' worth of music.\n\n<<<C>>>"
