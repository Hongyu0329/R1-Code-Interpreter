    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the fundamental shapes (tiles) in the pattern.**\nFirst, we must correctly identify the geometric shapes that make up the tiling. A close inspection reveals three distinct types of regular polygons:\n*   **Squares:** The orange-colored shapes with four equal sides and four 90° angles.\n*   **Hexagons:** The light-yellow/tan shapes are regular hexagons with six equal sides and six 120° angles.\n*   **Dodecagons:** The dark blue shapes are regular dodecagons, which have twelve equal sides and twelve 150° angles.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the vertex configuration.**\nLet's examine a point where the corners of the tiles meet (a vertex). We can see that at every vertex, one corner of a square, one corner of a hexagon, and one corner of a dodecagon meet. To confirm this is a valid tiling, we sum the interior angles of the polygons at a vertex:\n*   Angle of a square corner = 90°\n*   Angle of a hexagon corner = 120°\n*   Angle of a dodecagon corner = 150°\n*   Total angle = 90° + 120° + 150° = 360°\nSince the angles sum to 360°, they can perfectly fill the space around a point, confirming this vertex configuration. This tiling is known as a *truncated trihexagonal tiling* or an Archimedean tiling with the symbol (4.6.12).\n\n**Step 3: Look for centers of rotation.**\nRotational symmetry exists if the tiling can be rotated around a point by an angle less than 360° and appear unchanged. We should check the center of each type of polygon.\n\n*   **Center of a Square (orange):** A single square has 4-fold symmetry (can be rotated by 90°). However, in this tiling, a square is surrounded by two hexagons and two dodecagons, alternating. Rotating by 90° would move a hexagon into a dodecagon's position, so the pattern does not match. A rotation by 180° (2-fold symmetry), however, would map the hexagon onto the opposite hexagon and the dodecagon onto the opposite dodecagon. Thus, the center of each square is a point of **2-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n*   **Center of a Hexagon (light-yellow/tan):** A single hexagon has 6-fold symmetry. In the tiling, each hexagon is surrounded by three squares and three dodecagons, alternating. Rotating by 60° (6-fold) would move a square into a dodecagon's position. A rotation by 120° (3-fold) is required to map squares onto squares and dodecagons onto dodecagons. Thus, the center of each hexagon is a point of **3-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n*   **Center of a Dodecagon (dark blue):** A single dodecagon has 12-fold symmetry. In the tiling, each dodecagon is surrounded by six squares and six hexagons, alternating. If we rotate the pattern around the center of a dodecagon by 60° (which is 360°/6), each square moves to the position of another square, and each hexagon moves to the position of another hexagon. The entire tiling pattern remains unchanged under this rotation. Therefore, the center of each dodecagon is a point of **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the overall rotational symmetry.**\nThe tiling possesses points of 2-fold, 3-fold, and 6-fold rotational symmetry. When asked for \"the\" rotational symmetry of a pattern, it typically refers to the highest order of symmetry present.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe highest order of rotational symmetry found in the tiling is 6-fold, with the centers of rotation located at the center of each dark blue dodecagon.\n\n<<<6-fold rotational symmetry>>>"
