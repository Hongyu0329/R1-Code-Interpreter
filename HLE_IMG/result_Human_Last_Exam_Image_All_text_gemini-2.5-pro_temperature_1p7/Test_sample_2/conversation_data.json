    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Structure:**\n    Let's analyze the provided pseudocode for the function `sort(a, n)`.\n    ```python\n    def sort(a, n):\n      if n > 1:\n        # 1. First recursive call\n        sort(a, n - 1)\n        \n        # 2. Comparison and potential swap\n        if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n          swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])\n          \n        # 3. Second recursive call\n        sort(a, n - 1)\n    ```\n    The function is recursive. The base case for the recursion is when `n <= 1`, at which point the function does nothing and returns. An array of size 1 or 0 is inherently sorted.\n    For `n > 1`, the function performs three main steps:\n    a. It calls itself with a reduced size `n - 1`. Let's assume this call correctly sorts the prefix of the array `a[0...n-2]`.\n    b. It then compares the last two elements of the current subarray, `a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]`. If they are in the wrong order, it swaps them. This is similar to a single pass of Bubble Sort, but only on the last two elements.\n    c. It then calls itself *again* with the size `n - 1`. This is necessary because the swap in the previous step might have disrupted the sorted order of the `a[0...n-2]` subarray.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Time Complexity Recurrence Relation:**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time taken by the `sort(a, n)` function.\n    - The `if n > 1:` check is a constant time operation, `O(1)`.\n    - The first call `sort(a, n - 1)` takes `T(n-1)` time.\n    - The comparison `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` and the potential `swap` operation take constant time, `O(1)`.\n    - The second call `sort(a, n - 1)` also takes `T(n-1)` time.\n\n    Combining these, the recurrence relation for the time complexity is:\n    `T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-1) + O(1)`\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`  (where `c` is a constant representing the `O(1)` work)\n\n    The base case is `T(1) = d` (where `d` is some constant time).\n\n3.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:**\n    We can solve this recurrence relation by expansion:\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n    `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c = 2^2 * T(n-2) + (2^1 + 2^0)c`\n    `T(n) = 2^2 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c = 2^3 * T(n-3) + (2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0)c`\n\n    A general pattern emerges:\n    `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) + ... + 2^0)`\n\n    We continue until we reach the base case `T(1)`. This happens when `n - k = 1`, which means `k = n - 1`.\n    Substituting `k = n - 1` into the equation:\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-2) + 2^(n-3) + ... + 2^0)`\n\n    The sum `(2^(n-2) + ... + 2^0)` is a geometric series with sum `(2^(n-1) - 1) / (2 - 1) = 2^(n-1) - 1`.\n    So, the equation becomes:\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * d + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n    `T(n) = d * 2^(n-1) + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n    `T(n) = (d + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\n    The dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`. In Big-O notation, constant factors and lower-order terms are ignored. Therefore, the time complexity is `O(2^(n-1))`, which is equivalent to `O(2^n)`.\n\n4.  **Consider the Worst Case:**\n    The question asks for the worst-case time complexity. In this specific algorithm, the two recursive calls `sort(a, n - 1)` are always executed regardless of the input data or whether the swap is performed. The control flow does not depend on the values in the array, only on the size `n`. Thus, the best-case, average-case, and worst-case time complexities are all the same. The time complexity is always `O(2^n)`.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe algorithm's structure leads to a recurrence relation `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`. Solving this relation shows an exponential growth in the number of operations, proportional to `2^n`. Therefore, the worst-case time complexity is `O(2^n)`."
