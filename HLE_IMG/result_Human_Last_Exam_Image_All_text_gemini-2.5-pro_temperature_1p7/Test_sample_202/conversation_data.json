    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens:\n\n**Analysis of Specimen H**\n1.  **Observation:** The rock is reddish-brown and has a porous texture with many visible, small-to-medium-sized cavities or holes (called vesicles).\n2.  **Interpretation:** The vesicular texture is a strong indicator of an extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock. These holes are formed by gas bubbles escaping from lava as it cooled rapidly on the Earth's surface. The reddish color is often due to the oxidation (rusting) of iron-bearing minerals.\n3.  **Identification:** These features—vesicular texture, aphanitic (fine-grained) groundmass, and typically mafic to intermediate composition—are characteristic of **Scoria** (also known as volcanic cinder).\n\n**Analysis of Specimen J**\n1.  **Observation:** This rock is light-colored (white to light grey) and extremely porous, with a frothy appearance due to a high density of very small vesicles.\n2.  **Interpretation:** Like specimen H, this is an extrusive (volcanic) igneous rock that cooled very rapidly, trapping gas. The light color indicates a felsic composition (rich in silica). Its extremely vesicular nature gives it a very low density.\n3.  **Identification:** A light-colored, low-density, highly vesicular volcanic rock is identified as **Pumice**.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen I**\n1.  **Observation:** This specimen is composed of various angular fragments (clasts) of different colors and sizes cemented together in a finer-grained, light-colored matrix. I can see some reddish and grey fragments embedded within.\n2.  **Interpretation:** The texture is clastic, meaning it's made of pieces of other rocks. Since the fragments are angular and appear to be of volcanic origin (some resemble ash or pieces of other lavas), this rock was formed from the explosive eruption of a volcano. Material ejected during the eruption (ash, pumice, rock fragments) fell and was later consolidated or welded together.\n3.  **Identification:** A rock composed of angular volcanic fragments cemented in a matrix of volcanic ash is known as a **Volcanic Breccia** or a coarse **Tuff**.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen K**\n1.  **Observation:** This rock is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are clearly visible to the naked eye. The crystals have different colors, including light pinkish/white and darker greenish/black minerals. The texture is coarse-grained (phaneritic). There are no vesicles.\n2.  **Interpretation:** The large crystal size indicates that the rock cooled very slowly, allowing crystals time to grow large. This slow cooling occurs deep beneath the Earth's surface, making it an intrusive (plutonic) igneous rock. The light overall color suggests a felsic composition, rich in minerals like feldspar and quartz.\n3.  **Identification:** A coarse-grained, felsic, intrusive igneous rock is identified as **Granite**. The particularly large size of the crystals could also qualify it as a **Pegmatite**, which is an extremely coarse-grained variety of granite.\n\n---\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria (Extrusive igneous)\n*   **I:** Volcanic Breccia / Tuff (Pyroclastic)\n*   **J:** Pumice (Extrusive igneous)\n*   **K:** Granite / Pegmatite (Intrusive igneous)\n\n<<<\nH: Scoria\nI: Volcanic Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Granite\n>>>"
