    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Benzene to Intermediate-1**\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene (C₆H₆) and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl).\n*   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a Friedel-Crafts Acylation. The AlCl₃ coordinates with the chlorine atom of the acyl chloride, creating a highly electrophilic acylium ion (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O).\n*   **Mechanism:** The aromatic benzene ring acts as a nucleophile and attacks the acylium ion. After deprotonation, a proton on the ring is replaced by the propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃).\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is **propiophenone** (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n    *   Structure: A phenyl group (C₆H₅) attached to a carbonyl group, which is attached to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 2: Intermediate-1 to Intermediate-2**\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone.\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂ and FeBr₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS), specifically bromination.\n*   **Directing Effect:** The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group. Such groups are deactivating and act as *meta*-directors. Therefore, the incoming electrophile (Br⁺) will attach to the position *meta* to the acyl group (position 3).\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The product is **1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one**.\n    *   Structure: Propiophenone with a bromine atom at the 3-position of the phenyl ring.\n\n**Step 3: Intermediate-2 to Intermediate-3**\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd (catalytic hydrogenation).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a reduction reaction. H₂/Pd is a strong reducing agent that can reduce multiple functional groups in this molecule.\n    1.  **Reduction of the ketone:** The ketone group (C=O) is reduced. This reduction typically proceeds in two stages under these conditions: first to a secondary alcohol (-CH(OH)-), which, being a *benzylic* alcohol, is then further reduced via hydrogenolysis to a methylene group (-CH₂-). So, the C=O group is completely reduced to a CH₂ group.\n    2.  **Reduction of the aryl halide:** The carbon-bromine bond on the aromatic ring (Ar-Br) is also cleaved by hydrogenolysis and the bromine atom is replaced by a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** Both the ketone and the bromo group are reduced. The starting molecule becomes **propylbenzene**.\n    *   Structure: A phenyl group (C₆H₅) attached to a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 4: Intermediate-3 to Final Product**\n*   **Reactant:** Propylbenzene.\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator), in CCl₄ (a non-polar solvent).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a free-radical bromination. These conditions are specific for bromination at the allylic or **benzylic** position.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The benzylic position is the carbon atom of the alkyl chain that is directly attached to the benzene ring. In propylbenzene (C₆H₅-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃), this is the first carbon of the propyl group. A hydrogen atom is abstracted from this position because the resulting benzylic radical (C₆H₅-ĊH-CH₂-CH₃) is highly stabilized by resonance with the aromatic ring. Bromination then occurs at this site.\n*   **Final Product:** The product is **1-bromo-1-phenylpropane**.\n    *   Structure: A propane chain with a phenyl group and a bromo group both attached to carbon 1.\n\n**Summary of Structures:**\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-Bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n*   **Intermediate-3:** Propylbenzene\n*   **Final Product:** 1-Bromo-1-phenylpropane\n\n<<<1-Bromo-1-phenylpropane>>>"
