    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Structure and Variable Part:** All four structures are cationic Iridium(III) organometallic complexes. They share a common architecture: a central Iridium(III) ion coordinated to two cyclometalating ligands (C^N type) and one ancillary bidentate ligand (N^N type). The counter-ion is hexafluorophosphate (PF₆⁻) in all cases.\n    *   **Common Ancillary Ligand (N^N):** All four complexes use 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dtbbpy). Since this ligand is identical in all complexes, it is not the differentiating factor for their relative stability.\n    *   **Variable Cyclometalating Ligands (C^N):** The key difference between the four complexes lies in the substitution pattern on the phenyl ring of the 2-phenylpyridine-type cyclometalating ligands. The complexes vary in the number and position of fluorine substituents.\n\n2.  **Relate Structure to Lifetime:** The question asks about the expected lifetimes of these complexes when used as emitters in Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs). The operational lifetime of an LEC is largely determined by the chemical stability of the emitter complex under electrical bias. A major degradation pathway for such Ir(III) complexes involves reactions at the ligand framework, particularly at C-H bonds, which can be broken during electrochemical cycling or from the high-energy excited state.\n\n3.  **The Role of Fluorination:** Fluorination is a common strategy to improve the stability of organic electronic materials, including phosphorescent emitters. The reasons are twofold:\n    *   **Bond Strength:** The Carbon-Fluorine (C-F) bond is significantly stronger and more stable than the Carbon-Hydrogen (C-H) bond. Replacing C-H bonds with C-F bonds makes the ligand less susceptible to chemical attack and bond cleavage, thus preventing degradation of the complex.\n    *   **Electronic Effects:** Fluorine is highly electronegative and acts as an electron-withdrawing group. This stabilizes the molecular orbitals of the ligand, particularly the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) which has significant character on the cyclometalated phenyl ring and the iridium center. This stabilization can make the complex more resistant to oxidative degradation and strengthen the crucial Ir-C bond.\n\n4.  **Analyze Each Complex:** We can rank the complexes based on their degree of fluorination on the C^N ligands. A higher degree of fluorination is expected to lead to higher stability and thus a longer lifetime.\n    *   **Complex 2:** The C^N ligand is 2-phenylpyridine (ppy). There are **no fluorine atoms**. The phenyl ring has five C-H bonds, which are potential sites for degradation. This complex is expected to be the least stable.\n    *   **Complex 3:** The C^N ligand is a mono-fluorinated phenylpyridine. There is **one fluorine atom** per ligand, replacing one C-H bond. This complex is expected to be more stable than Complex 2.\n    *   **Complex 1:** The C^N ligand is a di-fluorinated phenylpyridine. There are **two fluorine atoms** per ligand. This complex is expected to be more stable than both Complex 2 and Complex 3.\n    *   **Complex 4:** The C^N ligand is also a di-fluorinated phenylpyridine. It has **two fluorine atoms** per ligand, just at different positions than in Complex 1. It is also expected to be significantly more stable than Complexes 2 and 3.\n\n5.  **Establish Stability Ranking and Determine the Answer:** Based on the number of stabilizing fluorine substituents, the order of stability (and thus operational lifetime) is expected to be:\n    **Lifetime(2) < Lifetime(3) < Lifetime(1) ≈ Lifetime(4)**\n\n    The question asks which complexes are expected to show \"shorter lifetimes\". In a relative comparison among the four options, the complexes with fewer or no fluorine atoms will be the least stable. Therefore, the non-fluorinated Complex 2 and the mono-fluorinated Complex 3 fall into the category of having shorter lifetimes compared to the di-fluorinated complexes 1 and 4.\n\n    Thus, the correct answer should include both Complex 2 and Complex 3.\n\n6.  **Select the Correct Answer Choice:** The pair [2, 3] corresponds to option H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
