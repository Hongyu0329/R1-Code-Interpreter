The regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to the rigid, cyclic structure of the N-acetylproline starting material, which funnels the reaction through a single, well-defined asymmetric Münchnone intermediate. The subsequent [3+2] cycloaddition of this conformationally locked dipole with the asymmetric alkyne is inherently regioselective due to controlling steric and electronic factors. In contrast, Reactions 1 and 2 involve an acyclic and flexible substrate (N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine). The isotopic labeling results of Reaction 2 prove that this substrate does not react via a simple asymmetric intermediate but instead forms a symmetric reactive intermediate where the two methyl groups become equivalent. The ability to form this symmetric intermediate is a direct consequence of the substrate's acyclic flexibility. The rigid pyrrolidine ring in Reaction 3's substrate prevents the formation of a similar symmetric intermediate, locking it into the classical and highly regioselective Münchnone pathway.
