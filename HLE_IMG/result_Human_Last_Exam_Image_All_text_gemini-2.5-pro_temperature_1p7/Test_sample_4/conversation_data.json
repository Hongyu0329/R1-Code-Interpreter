    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Jones polynomial of the given knot.\n\n**Step 1: Knot Identification**\n\n1.  **Count the crossings:** First, we examine the knot diagram to determine its crossing number. By carefully tracing the single continuous loop of the knot, we can count the number of times it crosses over or under itself. There are 10 such crossings.\n2.  **Check for properties:** We can trace the path of the knot's strand. Starting from any point and following the strand, we observe that the crossings alternate between \"over\" and \"under\". This means the diagram is an alternating knot diagram. For alternating knots, a reduced alternating diagram (one with no nugatory crossings, which this one appears to be) has the minimum possible number of crossings. So, this is a 10-crossing knot.\n3.  **Identify the specific knot:** The diagram is a standard projection of a well-known knot. It is the **torus knot T(5,3)**. Torus knots T(p,q) are formed by winding a string p times around the longitudinal direction and q times around the meridional direction of a torus. The number of crossings for a T(p,q) knot is `min(p(q-1), q(p-1))`. For T(5,3), the number of crossings is `min(5(3-1), 3(5-1)) = min(10, 12) = 10`, which matches our count. In Alexander-Briggs notation, this knot is cataloged as **10_124**.\n4.  **Determine the chirality:** Standard diagrams of T(p,q) knots with p and q both positive are, by convention, right-handed. We can confirm this by checking the sign of the crossings. If we orient the strands, we find that all crossings are of the same type (positive, or right-handed). The Jones polynomial is sensitive to chirality. For the mirror image (a left-handed knot), the polynomial `V(t)` would be replaced by `V(t^{-1})`. We will proceed with the calculation for the right-handed T(5,3) knot.\n\n**Step 2: Calculation of the Jones Polynomial**\n\nCalculating the Jones polynomial from its definition (the Kauffman bracket skein relations) is very complex for a 10-crossing knot. A more direct method is to use the known formula for the Jones polynomial `V(t)` of a right-handed T(p,q) torus knot:\n\n`V(T(p,q); t) = t^((p-1)(q-1)/2) * (1 - t^(p+1) - t^(q+1) + t^(p+q)) / (1 - t^2)`\n\nFor our knot, T(5,3), we set p=5 and q=3.\n\n1.  **Calculate the exponent of the pre-factor:**\n    The exponent is `(p-1)(q-1)/2 = (5-1)(3-1)/2 = (4 * 2) / 2 = 4`.\n    So, the pre-factor is `t^4`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the numerator term:**\n    The numerator is `1 - t^(p+1) - t^(q+1) + t^(p+q) = 1 - t^(5+1) - t^(3+1) + t^(5+3) = 1 - t^6 - t^4 + t^8`.\n\n3.  **Assemble the expression:**\n    `V(t) = t^4 * (1 - t^4 - t^6 + t^8) / (1 - t^2)`\n\n4.  **Simplify the fraction by polynomial division:**\n    We can factor the numerator `P(t) = 1 - t^4 - t^6 + t^8`.\n    `P(t) = (1 - t^4) - t^6(1 - t^2)`\n    `P(t) = (1 - t^2)(1 + t^2) - t^6(1 - t^2)`\n    `P(t) = (1 - t^2) * (1 + t^2 - t^6)`\n    Now, the division is straightforward:\n    `(1 - t^4 - t^6 + t^8) / (1 - t^2) = 1 + t^2 - t^6`\n\n5.  **Multiply by the pre-factor:**\n    `V(t) = t^4 * (1 + t^2 - t^6)`\n    `V(t) = t^4 + t^6 - t^{10}`\n\n**Step 3: Final Formatting**\n\nThe question asks for the polynomial, which we call `p(t)`, to be written in decreasing degree order.\n\nReordering the terms of `t^4 + t^6 - t^{10}` gives:\n`p(t) = -t^{10} + t^6 + t^4`\n\nThis is the Jones polynomial for the knot shown in the image.\n\n<<<$-t^{10} + t^6 + t^4$>>>"
