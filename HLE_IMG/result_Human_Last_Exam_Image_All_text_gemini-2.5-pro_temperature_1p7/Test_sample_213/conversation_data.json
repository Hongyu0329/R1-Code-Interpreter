    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to determine the opera's name.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Instrumentation and Language**\n*   The instrument names are written in German: `gr. Fl.` (große Flöten/Flutes), `Hob.` (Hoboe/Oboe), `engl. Horn` (English Horn), `Fag.` (Fagott/Bassoon), `Viol.` (Violinen/Violins), `Br.` (Bratschen/Violas), `Celli` (Cellos).\n*   Performance instructions are also in German: `(die übrigen)` meaning \"the rest\" (referring to the other players in a string section), `m.D.` (mit Dämpfer) meaning \"with mute\", and `(Vorhang)` meaning \"Curtain\".\n*   This strong presence of German terminology points towards an opera by a German or Austrian composer.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Musical Style**\n*   **Harmony:** The harmony is very complex and chromatic. The chords are dense, with many accidentals (sharps, double sharps, naturals). This style is characteristic of the late Romantic period, particularly the music of Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss.\n*   **Orchestration:** The orchestra is large. The string section is divided (`divisi`) into multiple parts (`1. Pult`, `2. Pult`, `die übrigen`), which creates a very rich, lush, and shimmering texture. The use of a solo viola (`Solo Br.`) and a prominent, expressive English Horn part are also key features of this style.\n*   **Dynamics and Expression:** The music starts quietly (`p`, `dim.`, `pp`) and builds to a `mf` (mezzo-forte). The instruction `gliss.` (glissando) towards the end is another expressive device common in music of this era. The overall mood is one of intense, atmospheric anticipation.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Structural Clues**\n*   The score is marked with a rehearsal number `1`.\n*   Just before rehearsal mark 1, the word `(Vorhang)` is written. This indicates that the stage curtain rises at this exact point in the music.\n*   The question states that this music \"opens the second act\". The presence of the `(Vorhang)` instruction confirms that this is the beginning of the staged action for an act. The few bars preceding this marking serve as a brief prelude before the scene is revealed to the audience.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Opera**\n*   The combination of a large orchestra, lush divided strings, highly chromatic harmony, and German text strongly points to a late-period opera by Richard Wagner.\n*   The specific musical passage, with its shimmering string textures and a poignant woodwind melody, is famous. This is the music from the introduction to Act II of Wagner's opera **Tristan und Isolde**.\n*   While the musical prelude to Act II begins with a fiery, agitated passage (representing the \"Day\" motif), that section subsides. The music in the excerpt is what is played as the hunting horns fade into the distance, night falls, and the curtain rises on Isolde in her garden, ecstatically awaiting Tristan's arrival. Therefore, this music literally \"opens\" the visible action of the second act.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe musical style, instrumentation, German markings, and the specific instruction `(Vorhang)` precisely match the score at the opening of the stage action for Act II of Richard Wagner's opera *Tristan und Isolde*.\n\n<<<Tristan und Isolde>>>"
