    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total current flowing through the circuit.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Circuit Components:**\n    The circuit consists of a DC voltage source and five resistors.\n    *   Voltage Source V2 = 1 V\n    *   Resistor R1 = 3 Ω\n    *   Resistor R2 = 7 Ω\n    *   Resistor R3 = 9 Ω\n    *   Resistor R7 = 100 Ω\n    *   Resistor R8 = 100 Ω\n\n2.  **Analyze the Circuit Layout and Identify Key Nodes:**\n    Let's identify the main nodes in the circuit.\n    *   The top horizontal wire is connected directly to the positive terminal of the 1V source. Let's call this the \"top node,\" which is at a potential of +1 V.\n    *   The bottom horizontal wire is connected directly to the negative terminal of the source and to the ground symbol. Let's call this the \"bottom node,\" which is at a potential of 0 V.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Connections of Each Resistor (Careful Points):**\n    The key to solving this circuit is to carefully examine how each resistor is connected between the top and bottom nodes.\n\n    *   **Resistor R1:** One end of R1 is connected to the top node (+1 V). The other end of R1 is connected to the point between R1 and R2. However, there is also a wire that runs directly from the top node to this point between R1 and R2. This wire effectively places both ends of R1 at the same potential (+1 V). This is a short circuit across R1. Because there is no potential difference (voltage) across it, no current flows through R1.\n\n    *   **Resistor R3:** One end of R3 is connected to the bottom node (0 V). The other end of R3 is connected to the point between R2 and R3. There is also a wire that runs directly from this point to the bottom node. This wire places both ends of R3 at the same potential (0 V). This is a short circuit across R3. No current will flow through R3.\n\n    *   **Resistor R8:** One end of R8 is connected to the top node (+1 V). The other end of R8 is connected to the point between R8 and R7. A wire also runs directly from the top node to this point. This wire places both ends of R8 at the same potential (+1 V), creating a short circuit. No current will flow through R8.\n\n4.  **Create a Simplified Circuit Diagram:**\n    Since resistors R1, R3, and R8 are short-circuited and carry no current, they can be ignored for the purpose of calculating the total current. Let's see how the remaining resistors, R2 and R7, are connected.\n\n    *   **Resistor R2:** The top of R2 is connected to the point that is shorted to the top node (+1 V). The bottom of R2 is connected to the point that is shorted to the bottom node (0 V). Therefore, R2 is connected directly across the 1V source.\n    *   **Resistor R7:** The top of R7 is connected to the point that is shorted to the top node (+1 V). The bottom of R7 is connected directly to the bottom node (0 V). Therefore, R7 is also connected directly across the 1V source.\n\n    The simplified circuit consists of two resistors, R2 and R7, connected in parallel with the 1V voltage source.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Current in Each Branch:**\n    Using Ohm's Law (I = V/R), we can calculate the current flowing through each of the active branches.\n\n    *   Current through R2 (I₂):\n        I₂ = V2 / R2 = 1 V / 7 Ω = 1/7 A\n\n    *   Current through R7 (I₇):\n        I₇ = V2 / R7 = 1 V / 100 Ω = 1/100 A = 0.01 A\n\n6.  **Calculate the Total Current:**\n    The total current flowing from the source (V2) is the sum of the currents in the parallel branches, according to Kirchhoff's Current Law.\n\n    *   Total Current (I_total) = I₂ + I₇\n    *   I_total = (1/7) A + (1/100) A\n    *   To add the fractions, we find a common denominator (700):\n    *   I_total = (100/700) A + (7/700) A\n    *   I_total = 107/700 A\n\n7.  **Final Answer Calculation:**\n    Converting the fraction to a decimal:\n    *   I_total = 107 ÷ 700 A ≈ 0.152857 A\n\n    Rounding to three significant figures, the total current is 0.153 A.\n\n<<<0.153 A>>>"
