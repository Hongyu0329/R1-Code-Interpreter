"product_A": "The structure is a tetrahydropyridinone fused to a pyrrolidine ring. An acetyl group is on the nitrogen of the pyrrolidine ring. A methyl group and a methyl carboxylate group are attached to the dihydropyridinone ring. The pyrroline from the original starting material is attached as a substituent.", "product_B": "The structure is a tricyclic lactam formed by intramolecular cyclization and rearrangement. It contains a six-membered ring fused to two five-membered rings, one of which contains an exocyclic double bond with an ester group.", "product_C": "The structure is a bicyclic product containing an imide ring fused to another five-membered ring. An acetyl group is attached to one of the nitrogen atoms."
