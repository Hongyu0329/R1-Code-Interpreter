    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**1. Identify Chiral Centers and Number the Main Chain**\n\n*   A chiral center (or stereocenter) is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.\n*   First, we need to identify the principal functional group to correctly number the longest carbon chain. According to IUPAC rules, the amine group (-NH2) has higher priority than the hydroxyl group (-OH).\n*   The longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the amine) must be identified. The numbering starts from the end that gives the lowest possible number to the carbon bearing the amine group.\n*   The carbon atom of the -CH2NH2 group is C1.\n*   The longest chain starting from C1 is a 5-carbon chain (a pentane derivative).\n    *   C1: -CH2NH2\n    *   C2: Attached to C1, a methyl group (-CH3), a hydrogen (-H), and C3.\n    *   C3: Attached to C2, an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), a hydrogen (-H), and C4.\n    *   C4: Attached to C3, a hydroxyl group (-OH), a methyl group (-CH3), and a hydrogen (-H). This methyl is C5. No, wait, let's re-examine.\n    Let's trace the chain: C(from CH2NH2) is C1. It's attached to C2. C2 is attached to C3. C3 is attached to C4. C4 is attached to a methyl group (let's call it C5). This makes a pentane chain.\n    The IUPAC name is **3-ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-methylpentan-1-amine**.\n*   The chiral centers are the carbons with four different substituents: C2, C3, and C4.\n\n**2. Determine the Absolute Configuration for Each Chiral Center**\n\nWe will use the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules to assign the configuration (R or S) for each center. The rule is to orient the molecule so the lowest priority group (4) is pointing away, and then observe the direction from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3. Clockwise is R, and counter-clockwise is S. If the lowest priority group is not pointing away, we can perform a single swap of two groups to place it away, determine the configuration, and then invert the result.\n\n**A. Configuration at C4**\n\n*   **Substituents:** -OH, -CH(Et)CH(Me)CH2NH2 (the rest of the chain), -CH3, -H.\n*   **Priorities (by atomic number):**\n    1.  -OH (Oxygen, Z=8)\n    2.  -CH(Et)CH(Me)CH2NH2 (Carbon connected to other carbons)\n    3.  -CH3 (Carbon connected to hydrogens)\n    4.  -H (Hydrogen, Z=1)\n*   **3D Arrangement & Determination:**\n    *   The -OH group (1) is on a wedge (forward).\n    *   The -CH3 group (3) is on a dash (away).\n    *   The -H group (4) is in the plane.\n    *   To simplify, we can use the swap rule. Let's swap the lowest priority group H (4) with the group that is pointing away, -CH3 (3).\n    *   After the swap: H is now on the dash (away). The order of the remaining groups is 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   Viewing the swapped molecule with H away: -OH (1) is on a wedge, the chain (2) is in the plane to the right, and the swapped -CH3 (3) is in the plane to the left. The path 1 -> 2 -> 3 is counter-clockwise.\n    *   So, the swapped configuration is S. Since we performed one swap, the original configuration is the opposite.\n    *   Therefore, C4 is **R**.\n\n**B. Configuration at C3**\n\n*   **Substituents:** -CH(OH)CH3 (chain to the left), -CH(Me)CH2NH2 (chain to the right), -CH2CH3 (ethyl), -H.\n*   **Priorities:**\n    1.  -CH(OH)CH3 (C attached to O is highest priority).\n    2.  -CH(Me)CH2NH2 (C attached to two Cs is next).\n    3.  -CH2CH3 (C attached to one C is next).\n    4.  -H\n*   **3D Arrangement & Determination:**\n    *   The ethyl group (3) is on a wedge (forward).\n    *   The implicit -H group (4) is on a dash (away).\n    *   Since the lowest priority group is already pointing away, we can directly determine the configuration.\n    *   Viewing the molecule: group 1 is up-left, group 2 is down-right, and group 3 is forward. The path 1 -> 2 -> 3 is clockwise.\n    *   Therefore, C3 is **R**.\n\n**C. Configuration at C2**\n\n*   **Substituents:** -CH2NH2, -CH(Et)CH(OH)CH3 (the rest of the chain), -CH3, -H.\n*   **Priorities:**\n    1.  -CH2NH2 (C is attached to N, which outranks the C attachments of other groups).\n    2.  -CH(Et)CH(OH)CH3 (C attached to other carbons).\n    3.  -CH3 (C attached to hydrogens).\n    4.  -H\n*   **3D Arrangement & Determination:**\n    *   The -CH2NH2 group (1) is on a wedge (forward).\n    *   The -CH3 group (3) is on a dash (away).\n    *   The -H group (4) is in the plane.\n    *   Let's swap the lowest priority group H (4) with the group pointing away, -CH3 (3).\n    *   After the swap: H is now on a dash (away). The order of the remaining groups is 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   Viewing the swapped molecule with H away: -CH2NH2 (1) is on a wedge, the chain (2) is in the plane to the left, and the swapped -CH3 (3) is in the plane to the right. The path 1 -> 2 -> 3 is counter-clockwise.\n    *   So, the swapped configuration is S. The original configuration must be the opposite.\n    *   Therefore, C2 is **R**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe absolute configuration for the chiral centers are C2 is R, C3 is R, and C4 is R.\n\nThe final answer is (2R, 3R, 4R).\n\n<<<(2R, 3R, 4R)>>>"
