    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the overall characteristics of the music.**\n*   **Instrumentation:** The music is written on a grand staff (treble and bass clefs), which is standard for piano music.\n*   **Tempo:** The tempo marking is `â™© = 80`, which is a moderate tempo (Andante).\n*   **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4 (common time).\n*   **Key Signature:** The key signature is C major / A minor (no sharps or flats). However, there are numerous accidentals (sharps and flats) throughout the piece, suggesting complex harmonies and frequent modulations.\n*   **Dynamics:** There is a wide range of dynamics, starting with `p` (piano, soft), then suddenly jumping to `f` (forte, loud), and later using `mp` (mezzo-piano) and `mf` (mezzo-forte). This indicates a piece with high emotional contrast and drama.\n\n**Step 2: Examine the opening measures in detail.**\n*   **Measure 1:** The right hand plays a distinctive arpeggiated figure (G4-B4 eighth notes, followed by E4 eighth note, then G4 quarter note) over a sustained C major chord in the left hand. This gentle, memorable opening phrase is a significant clue.\n*   **Measure 2:** The right hand plays a rapid, ascending C major scale (G-A-B-C-D-E-F-G) written an octave higher than notated (indicated by the `8` and dotted line). This creates a glittering, ethereal effect. The left hand holds a single low G note.\n*   **Measure 3:** There is an abrupt change. The dynamic shifts to `f` (forte). Both hands become much more active. The right hand plays fast, descending 16th-note arpeggios, while the left hand plays powerful, low chords. The sudden shift from the calm, high-pitched intro to this powerful, aggressive section is a very strong characteristic of the piece.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the subsequent thematic material.**\n*   **Measures 4-5:** A new, driving rhythmic pattern emerges. The right hand plays a melody built on broken chords, while the left hand plays broken octaves in a consistent 16th-note rhythm. This accompaniment figure is highly recognizable. The harmony alternates between chords like G major and C major, with chromatic notes like F# appearing, creating a sense of tension.\n*   **Measures 8-10:** The texture becomes fuller and the dynamic is `mf` (mezzo-forte). The left hand plays block chords in a steady rhythm, supporting a melodic line in the right hand. This builds intensity.\n*   **Measure 11:** An upward-sweeping arpeggiated figure with a `gliss.` (glissando) marking provides a dramatic transition into the next section.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the clues and identify the music.**\nThe combination of these elements points strongly to a specific piece:\n1.  The iconic, gentle piano opening riff.\n2.  The beautiful, high ascending scale.\n3.  The sudden, dramatic \"drop\" into a loud, fast, and aggressive section.\n4.  The specific rhythmic and harmonic patterns used in the main theme.\n\nThese features are all hallmarks of the song **\"Unravel\"**, the opening theme for the anime series *Tokyo Ghoul*, composed by Toru Kitajima (TK from Ling tosite sigure). The sheet music represents a piano arrangement of this famous song.\n\n<<<Unravel (from Tokyo Ghoul)>>>"
