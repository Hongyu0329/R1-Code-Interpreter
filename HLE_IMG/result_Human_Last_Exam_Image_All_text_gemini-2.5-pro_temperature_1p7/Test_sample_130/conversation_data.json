    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Physics behind the Image**\nThe image shows an emission spectrum. When atoms of an element are energized (for example, by heating them or passing an electric current through them), their electrons jump to higher energy levels. When these electrons fall back to lower energy levels, they emit photons of light at specific, discrete wavelengths. When this light is passed through a prism or diffraction grating, it separates into a series of bright lines of different colors. This unique pattern of lines is the emission spectrum, and it acts as a \"fingerprint\" for that specific element.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Features of the Provided Spectrum**\nLet's carefully observe the lines in the given spectrum, moving from right to left (from longer to shorter wavelengths):\n*   **Red Region:** There is a prominent bright red line, along with a few other slightly fainter red lines close to it.\n*   **Yellow/Orange Region:** There is a very distinct and bright yellow line.\n*   **Green Region:** There is a bright green line, and several other lines in the blue-green (cyan/turquoise) region.\n*   **Blue/Violet Region:** There are multiple lines in the blue and violet parts of the spectrum.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Observed Pattern with Known Spectra of Elements**\nNow, we compare this observed \"fingerprint\" with the known spectra of some common elements.\n*   **Hydrogen:** The visible spectrum of hydrogen (the Balmer series) is very simple, containing only four prominent lines: one red, one blue-green, one blue-violet, and one violet. The spectrum in the image has many more lines than this. Therefore, it is not hydrogen.\n*   **Sodium:** The most characteristic feature of sodium's spectrum is an extremely bright doublet (two lines very close together) in the yellow region. While the given spectrum has a yellow line, it also has many other strong lines across the spectrum. Sodium's spectrum is dominated by the yellow lines. Thus, it is not sodium.\n*   **Neon:** Neon is known for its bright red-orange glow. Its emission spectrum is heavily dominated by a large number of lines in the red, orange, and yellow parts of the spectrum, with very little in the blue and green. The spectrum in the image shows strong lines across all colors, including green and blue. Therefore, it is not neon.\n*   **Helium:** The emission spectrum of helium is characterized by a set of strong, distinct lines distributed across the entire visible spectrum. Its most prominent lines are a red line, a bright yellow line, a green line, a blue-green line, and several blue and violet lines. This description perfectly matches the pattern of lines we observed in the image. The number and positions of the bright lines are characteristic of Helium.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nBy comparing the pattern of spectral lines in the image with the known spectra of various elements, we can confidently identify the element. The spectrum, with its multiple strong lines distributed across the red, yellow, green, and blue/violet regions, is the unique fingerprint of Helium.\n\n<<<Helium>>>"
