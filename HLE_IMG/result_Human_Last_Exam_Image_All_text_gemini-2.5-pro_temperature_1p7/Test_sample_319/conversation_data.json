    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual information.**\n    *   The image displays two related graphs. The bottom graph is a waveform, which represents sound pressure over time. It shows a pure sine wave, which is then interrupted by a section of irregular, complex waves (representing noise), and then the pure sine wave resumes. This indicates that physically, a tone is played, it stops, noise is played, and then the tone starts again.\n    *   The top graph is a spectrogram, which visualizes the frequency content of a sound over time. It shows a thin horizontal line, representing the single frequency of the pure tone. Crucially, where the noise occurs (represented by a thick vertical smear covering many frequencies), the thin horizontal line for the tone appears to continue *unbroken* through the noise. This visualization represents the typical human *perception* of the sound, not the physical reality shown in the waveform.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the textual information.**\n    *   The phenomenon is described as an \"illusion.\" This confirms that what is perceived is different from what is physically present.\n    *   It's compared to the \"Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity.\" The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where a 2D drawing is perceived as a 3D cube, and the brain can switch between two different, equally valid, 3D interpretations. The similarity here is that the brain is presented with an ambiguous or incomplete stimulus (a tone interrupted by noise) and constructs a complete, coherent perception (a continuous tone masked by noise). It \"fills in\" the missing information.\n    *   It is said to reveal a \"surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability.\" This points to a fundamental process our brain uses constantly. This filling-in ability is critical for understanding speech in noisy environments, where parts of words may be obscured by other sounds. We unconsciously \"restore\" the missing sounds to perceive continuous speech.\n\n*   **Step 3: Synthesize the analyses to identify the phenomenon.**\n    *   The core of the illusion is the auditory system's tendency to fill in missing portions of a sound if they are replaced by another plausible masking sound (like a burst of noise).\n    *   The brain assumes it is more likely that a continuous sound was temporarily obscured than that a sound stopped precisely as another one started and then restarted precisely as the second one finished.\n    *   This perceptual \"filling-in\" of sound is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**. A specific and famous example of this, involving speech sounds (phonemes), is called the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**. Given the clue about a \"common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability,\" which most strongly relates to our ability to comprehend speech in noisy settings, the Phonemic Restoration Effect is the most fitting name for this widely-studied phenomenon, even though the image uses a non-speech tone to illustrate the basic principle.\n\n<<<Phonemic Restoration Effect>>>"
