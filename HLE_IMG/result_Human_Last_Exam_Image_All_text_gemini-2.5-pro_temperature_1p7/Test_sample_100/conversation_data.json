    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   The starting material is a complex bicyclic molecule. Let's determine its molecular formula by breaking it down into its components.\n*   **Bicyclic Core:** The core structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. Let's count the atoms in this un-substituted core ring system with an H on the nitrogen:\n    *   Bridgehead carbons (C1, C4): 2 Carbons, 2 Hydrogens (1 H on each).\n    *   Carbons of the double bond (C5, C6): 2 Carbons, 2 Hydrogens (1 H on each).\n    *   Methylene bridge (C7): 1 Carbon, 2 Hydrogens.\n    *   Carbonyl carbon (C3): 1 Carbon, 0 Hydrogens.\n    *   Nitrogen atom (N2): 1 Nitrogen, 1 Hydrogen.\n    *   Total for a simple 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one: C6H7NO.\n*   **Substituents on the Starting Material:**\n    1.  A trifluoromethyl group (CF3) replaces a hydrogen on the double bond (let's say at C6). So, we subtract one H and add one C and three F's.\n        *   Core with CF3 group: (C6H7NO) - H + CF3 = C7H6F3NO.\n    2.  A p-methoxybenzyl group (PMB) is attached to the nitrogen, replacing the hydrogen. The formula for a PMB group is C8H9O (-CH2-C6H4-OCH3).\n        *   We subtract the H from the nitrogen and add the PMB group.\n*   **Molecular Formula of the Starting Material:**\n    *   Formula of the core (C7H6F3NO) - H on N + PMB group (C8H9O).\n    *   Carbons (C): 7 + 8 = 15\n    *   Hydrogens (H): (6 - 1) + 9 = 14\n    *   Fluorines (F): 3\n    *   Nitrogens (N): 1\n    *   Oxygens (O): 1 (from carbonyl) + 1 (from PMB) = 2\n    *   So, the starting material's formula is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Reaction (Formation of Intermediate 1)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n*   **Reaction:** CAN is a strong oxidizing agent commonly used for the oxidative cleavage of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers and amines. The PMB group is removed from the nitrogen atom.\n*   **Transformation:** The PMB protecting group is removed, and a hydrogen atom (from the solvent) is added to the nitrogen.\n*   **Change in Formula:** We subtract the atoms of the PMB group (C8H9O) and add one hydrogen atom (H).\n    *   Net change: -8 C, -9 H + 1 H, -1 O  =>  -C8, -H8, -O1.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 1:**\n    *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   H: 14 - 8 = 6\n    *   F: 3 (unchanged)\n    *   N: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   The formula for Intermediate 1 is **C7H6F3NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Second Reaction (Formation of Intermediate 2)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Pd/C, H2 (Palladium on carbon with hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation. This reaction reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C) to single bonds (C-C). The lactam (amide) carbonyl group is stable under these conditions.\n*   **Transformation:** The C=C double bond within the bicyclic ring is hydrogenated. This involves the addition of one molecule of H2 (two hydrogen atoms) across the double bond.\n*   **Change in Formula:** We add two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   Net change: +H2.\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 2:**\n    *   C: 7 (unchanged)\n    *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n    *   F: 3 (unchanged)\n    *   N: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   O: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   The formula for Intermediate 2 is **C7H8F3NO**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Third Reaction (Formation of the Final Product)**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C.\n*   **Reaction:** These are conditions for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Intermediate 2 contains a lactam (a cyclic amide), which will be hydrolyzed.\n*   **Transformation:** The amide bond (C-N) within the ring is cleaved. A molecule of water (H2O) is consumed in this process, opening the ring to form a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an amine (-NH2). Under the acidic conditions, the amine will be protonated to an ammonium salt (-NH3+).\n*   **Change in Formula:** We add one molecule of water (H2O).\n    *   Net change: +H2, +O1.\n*   **Molecular Formula of the Final Product:**\n    *   C: 7 (unchanged)\n    *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   F: 3 (unchanged)\n    *   N: 1 (unchanged)\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n    *   The final product is an amino acid with the molecular formula **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\nThe final product is a substituted aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
