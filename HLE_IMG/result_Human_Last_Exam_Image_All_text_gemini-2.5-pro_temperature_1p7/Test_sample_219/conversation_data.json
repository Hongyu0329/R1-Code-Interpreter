    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval from the provided graph.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph**\nThe image is a raster plot, which displays the firing activity of a population of neurons over time.\n*   **X-axis:** Time, measured in seconds (s). The labeled ticks are at 10-second intervals (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50).\n*   **Y-axis:** Electrode Number, representing different neurons or small groups of neurons, from 0 to 128.\n*   **Data points:** Each black dot or short line segment represents a single neuronal firing event (a \"spike\").\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts**\nA \"synchronized burst\" is a short period where a large number of neurons fire at a high rate. In the raster plot, these bursts appear as dense vertical columns of black dots, indicating that many electrodes recorded spikes at nearly the same time. We can visually identify four distinct major synchronized bursts.\n\n**Step 3: Estimate the Timestamps of the Bursts**\nWe need to determine the time corresponding to the approximate center of each burst. We read these values from the x-axis.\n\n*   **Burst 1:** The first burst occurs at the beginning of the recording. Its center is approximately at **t1 ≈ 2.5 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The second burst is located between the 10 s and 20 s marks. Its densest part is centered around **t2 ≈ 17.5 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** The third burst is between the 30 s and 40 s marks. It appears to be centered at **t3 ≈ 36 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** The final major burst is located near the end of the recording. Its center is approximately at **t4 ≈ 49 s**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time duration between the centers of two consecutive bursts. We can calculate three IBIs from our four identified bursts.\n\n*   **IBI 1 (between Burst 1 and Burst 2):**\n    *   IBI₁ = t₂ - t₁ = 17.5 s - 2.5 s = **15.0 s**\n*   **IBI 2 (between Burst 2 and Burst 3):**\n    *   IBI₂ = t₃ - t₂ = 36 s - 17.5 s = **18.5 s**\n*   **IBI 3 (between Burst 3 and Burst 4):**\n    *   IBI₃ = t₄ - t₃ = 49 s - 36 s = **13 s**\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual intervals and divide by the number of intervals.\n\n*   Sum of IBIs = 15.0 s + 18.5 s + 13 s = 46.5 s\n*   Number of intervals = 3\n*   Average IBI = 46.5 s / 3 = **15.5 s**\n\n**Step 6: Round to Two Significant Figures**\nThe question asks for the final answer to be rounded to two significant figures.\n\n*   The calculated average is 15.5 s.\n*   Rounding 15.5 to two significant figures gives **16**.\n\n<<<16>>>"
