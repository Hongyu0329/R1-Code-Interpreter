    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Identify the class of the compound:** The molecule contains nitrogen atoms within a complex, fused ring system. This is a hallmark of an alkaloid, a class of naturally occurring organic compounds that mostly contain basic nitrogen atoms.\n    2.  **Analyze the functional groups:** There is a carbonyl group (C=O) which is part of a six-membered ring containing a nitrogen atom. This functional group is a cyclic amide, also known as a lactam.\n    3.  **Analyze the core carbon skeleton:** The molecule is tetracyclic (has four fused rings). The overall framework is built upon two fused quinolizidine systems. This tetracyclic C15N2 skeleton is characteristic of lupin alkaloids.\n    4.  **Compare to known alkaloids:**\n        *   The parent skeleton without the carbonyl group is known as sparteine (C15H26N2).\n        *   The compound shown is an oxidized derivative of sparteine. The introduction of a carbonyl group to the sparteine skeleton at the C-2 position (forming a lactam) results in the compound known as lupanine (C15H24N2O).\n    5.  **Examine the stereochemistry:** The use of wedges and dashes indicates a specific stereoisomer. The configuration shown is that of the naturally occurring and most common isomer, known as (-)-lupanine.\n    6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the unique tetracyclic skeleton and the lactam functional group, the compound is identified as lupanine.\n\n*   **Careful points to consider:**\n    1.  Distinguish the lactam ring from a simple piperidine ring with a ketone. The C=O group is directly attached to the nitrogen, making it an amide.\n    2.  Recognize the underlying sparteine framework to place it within the correct family of alkaloids.\n    3.  While the IUPAC name is extremely complex, the common name \"lupanine\" is universally accepted and used for this well-known alkaloid.\n    4.  The stereochemistry is important for defining the specific isomer, but the general name for this structural skeleton with the lactam is lupanine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
