The user wants me to output the final answer with step by step analysis. I will generate the structures of A, B and C.

**Step-by-step derivation of products:**

1.  **Reactants Analysis**: The starting material is 1-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid (SM, C9H14N2O2), which is an N-imidoyl derivative of proline. It reacts with excess methyl propiolate (MP, C4H4O2) in acetic anhydride (Ac2O) with catalytic triethylamine (TEA) at 70°C.

2.  **Formation of Intermediate Dipole (D)**: The reaction conditions (N-substituted amino acid + Ac2O) are characteristic for the formation of a mesoionic 1,3-dipole via cyclodehydration.
    SM (C9H14N2O2) → Dipole D (C9H12N2O) + H2O
    This dipole D is a highly reactive intermediate, specifically a derivative of hexahydro-pyrrolo[1,2-c]imidazolium-3-olate.

3.  **Formation of Product C (C11H16N2O3)**: Acetic acid (AcOH, C2H4O2) is generated as a byproduct of the dipole formation. The dipole D can be trapped by the acid.
    D (C9H12N2O) + AcOH (C2H4O2) → Product C (C11H16N2O3)
    The formula matches perfectly. This is a simple acid-base-type reaction where the acid adds across the 1,3-dipole.
     

4.  **Formation of Product B (C12H14N2O3)**: This product arises from the expected [3+2] cycloaddition of the dipole D with the dipolarophile, methyl propiolate (MP).
    D (C9H12N2O) + MP (C4H4O2) → Primary Adduct P (C13H16N2O3)
    The reaction conditions (70°C) are sufficient to cause fragmentation of the primary adduct P.
    P (C13H16N2O3) → Product B (C12H14N2O3) + "CH2"
    Product B has one CH2 unit less than the primary adduct P, which suggests a fragmentation, for example, of the N-substituent pyrroline ring.
     

5.  **Formation of Product A (C14H20N2O3)**: The formula of product A indicates the incorporation of atoms beyond a simple 1:1 adduct. This suggests a more complex pathway, possibly starting with a Michael addition of the starting material to methyl propiolate, followed by further reactions.
    SM (C9H14N2O2) + MP (C4H4O2) → Michael Adduct M_add (C13H18N2O4)
    This Michael adduct could then undergo a series of transformations (e.g., methylation of the acid from another MP molecule, cyclization, and reduction) to yield the final structure of A. The higher hydrogen content and lower degree of unsaturation compared to B and C point towards reduction steps being involved.
