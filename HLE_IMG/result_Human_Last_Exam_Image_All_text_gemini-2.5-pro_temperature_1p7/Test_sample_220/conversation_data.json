    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which crystal lattice pattern represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Structure**\nAn FCC crystal structure consists of a cubic unit cell with atoms at each of the 8 corners and at the center of each of the 6 faces.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Projection along the [110] Direction**\nViewing a crystal structure along a specific direction, like [110], means we are looking at the 2D projection of the 3D atomic positions onto a plane that is perpendicular to that direction vector.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Theoretical 2D Pattern for FCC along [110]**\nWhen the 3D FCC lattice is projected along the [110] direction, the atoms form a 2D repeating pattern. The unit cell of this 2D pattern has the following characteristics:\n*   **Pattern Type:** It is a **centered rectangular** lattice. This means there are atoms at the four corners of a rectangle and one atom in the exact center of that rectangle.\n*   **Dimensions:** The sides of this rectangular unit cell are aligned with the [001] and [1-10] directions of the original cubic lattice. The lengths of these sides are `a` and `a√2`, where `a` is the lattice constant of the original cube.\n*   **Aspect Ratio:** The ratio of the side lengths of this rectangle is (`a√2`)/`a` = `√2` ≈ **1.414**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Given Options**\nWe now examine each image to see if its pattern matches the theoretical \"centered rectangle with an aspect ratio of ≈ 1.414\". The dashed box in each figure represents a candidate for the projected unit cell.\n\n*   **Image A:** This image shows a pattern where atoms are arranged in a simple rectangular grid (a primitive rectangle). There is no atom in the center of the rectangles formed by corner atoms. This pattern is incorrect.\n\n*   **Image B:** This image shows a centered rectangular pattern. Let's check the aspect ratio of the dashed box. The width and height are nearly equal (width ≈ 6 units, height ≈ 6.5 units, from the axes). The aspect ratio is ≈ 1.08. This is very close to 1, which corresponds to a centered square. A centered square pattern is characteristic of an FCC structure viewed along the [100] direction, not [110]. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **Image C:** This image also shows a centered rectangular pattern. Similar to B, the width and height of the dashed box are nearly equal (width ≈ 7 units, height ≈ 7 units). The aspect ratio is ≈ 1.0. This also corresponds to the FCC [100] view. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.\n\n*   **Image D:** This image displays a more complex arrangement of atoms within a rectangular dashed box. Let's analyze the shape of the box itself. From the axis ticks, the width of the front face is approximately 6 units (from x=0 to x=6), and the height is approximately 10 units (from y=5 to y=15). The aspect ratio is height/width = 10/6 ≈ **1.67**. Although not perfectly matching, this value is significantly closer to the theoretical value of √2 ≈ 1.414 than the aspect ratios of the other options (which were ≈1.0). The pattern of atoms inside is consistent with a centered rectangular lattice, though it may appear complex due to the superposition of different atomic layers and perspective drawing effects.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis of the unit cell shape and aspect ratio:\n*   A has the wrong pattern type.\n*   B and C have the correct pattern type (centered rectangle) but the wrong aspect ratio (≈1.0), matching the [100] direction instead.\n*   D is the only option where the containing box has an aspect ratio (≈1.67) that is reasonably close to the theoretical value of √2 for a [110] projection.\n\nTherefore, image D is the one that indicates a face-centered cubic structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
