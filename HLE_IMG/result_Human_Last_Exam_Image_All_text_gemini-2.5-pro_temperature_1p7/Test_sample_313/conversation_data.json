    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\nThe first clue is: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\nThe image shows two men at an awards ceremony. The man on the right, with a beard, is receiving a trophy from the older man on the left.\nBy searching for major award ceremonies on or around June 20, 2019, we can identify this as the NHL Awards ceremony, which took place on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas.\nThe man receiving the award is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov, a star player for the Tampa Bay Lightning.\nOn this night, Kucherov had a historic achievement, winning three of the most prestigious individual awards in hockey: the Hart Memorial Trophy (league MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player voted by players), and the Art Ross Trophy (top point scorer).\nThis achievement of winning three major awards is commonly referred to in sports journalism as a \"hat trick\" of awards. Many headlines from that time confirm this phrasing. For example, from the official NHL website: \"Kucherov completes hat trick of trophies with Hart, Lindsay\".\nSo, the image depicts an event where a \"hat trick\" of awards was achieved. The \"X Y\" could refer to this achievement.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\nThe second clue is: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\nThis clue points to a historical or chemical context. Mercury salts, specifically mercuric nitrate, were historically used in the felt-making process for hats, a procedure known as \"carroting.\" This process was hazardous, and the mercury vapor it produced often caused severe mercury poisoning among hat makers, known as \"hatters.\"\nThe neurological symptoms of this poisoning (tremors, shyness, irritability) are believed to be the origin of the expression \"mad as a hatter.\"\nThe use of mercury in hat-making has been discontinued for safety reasons.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the clues to find \"X Y\".**\nWe need to find a two-word phrase (\"X Y\") that connects Nikita Kucherov's 2019 NHL Awards achievement with the disused, toxic process of hat-making.\nThe term \"Hat Trick\" perfectly fits both clues:\n1.  It describes Kucherov's achievement pictured in the photo â€“ winning a \"hat trick\" of three major trophies. The sentence \"Hat Trick is pictured...\" is a clever metonymy, referring to the achievement being celebrated.\n2.  It relates to the second clue. The \"trick\" of making \"hats\" with mercury salts is \"another hat trick\" that has ceased. The word \"trick\" here can refer to a specific method or craft, and it was used for making hats. The toxicity of mercury salts in this \"hat trick\" led to its decline.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The date in the clue (June 20) might be a day after the event (June 19) due to reporting time or time zones, which is common.\n*   The phrase \"X Y is pictured\" does not mean \"X Y\" is the literal name of the person or object, but rather what is being represented or celebrated in the image.\n*   The word \"another\" in the second clue is crucial, as it distinguishes the awards \"hat trick\" from the hat-making \"trick\".\n*   The solution requires connecting two very different fields: modern sports and historical industrial chemistry.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy combining the analysis of the sports event in the picture and the historical context provided in the text clue, the answer \"X Y\" is determined to be \"Hat Trick\".\n\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
