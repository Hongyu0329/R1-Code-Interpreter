    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the image:** The image shows a cuneiform sign. Cuneiform is one of the earliest systems of writing, developed by the ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia. The earliest forms were pictographic, meaning the signs were stylized drawings of the objects they represented.\n2.  **Identify the form:** The question specifies the \"third-millennium form\" of the sign. This period (3000-2001 BC) includes the Early Dynastic period of Sumer, when cuneiform signs still retained a clear pictographic appearance. The sign in the image is indeed an archaic, pictographic form, not the later, more abstract wedge-based form.\n3.  **Interpret the pictograph:** The sign visually resembles a building. It has a foundation, walls (the rectangular part), and a roof (the triangular part). The lines inside might represent bricks, mats, or the internal layout. The small protruding lines might be architectural details like wooden beams.\n4.  **Identify the specific sign and its meaning:** This well-known cuneiform sign is transliterated as **Ã‰** (or Eâ‚‚). In the Sumerian language, the word **Ã‰** means \"house.\" By extension, it could also mean \"household,\" \"estate,\" or \"temple\" (as a temple was considered the \"house of a god\").\n5.  **Evaluate the answer choices:**\n    *   A. Tool: The image does not resemble a tool. Cuneiform signs for tools, like the plow (APIN), look different.\n    *   B. Guard: This is an abstract concept or a profession. While there are signs for professions, this sign is clearly a physical structure.\n    *   C. Bread: The sign for bread (NINDA) typically looks like a bowl or a specific shape of a loaf. It does not look like this sign.\n    *   D. Home: \"Home\" is a synonym for \"house.\" This aligns perfectly with the meaning of the Sumerian sign Ã‰.\n    *   E. Deity: The sign for a deity (DINGIR) is a star symbol (ð’€­). This is clearly not a star.\n    *   F. Beard: The sign for beard (SU) is a drawing of a beard, usually attached to a representation of the lower part of a face. This does not match the image.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the pictographic evidence and established knowledge of Sumerian cuneiform, the sign represents a house. Therefore, the correct meaning among the choices is \"Home.\"\n\n<<<D>>>"
