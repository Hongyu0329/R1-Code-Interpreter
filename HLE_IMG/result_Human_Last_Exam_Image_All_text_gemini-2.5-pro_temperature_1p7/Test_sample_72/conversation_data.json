    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the transformation:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and reaction conditions.**\nThe reactants are hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆), which is an aromatic compound, and cyclobutene (C₄H₆). The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hv` (light energy). The problem states that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur.\n\n**Step 2: Propose the first pericyclic reaction.**\nUnder photochemical conditions, alkenes can undergo cycloaddition reactions. A common reaction between two alkene systems is a [2+2] cycloaddition, which is photochemically allowed. In this case, one of the double bonds of hexafluorobenzene reacts with the double bond of cyclobutene.\n\n*   **Reactants:** A 2π-electron system (from one C=C bond of hexafluorobenzene) and another 2π-electron system (from the C=C bond of cyclobutene).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an **intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition**. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a [π2s + π2s] cycloaddition is photochemically allowed.\n*   **Intermediate Product:** This reaction forms a bicyclic intermediate. The structure is a cyclobutane ring fused to a cyclohexadiene ring. Specifically, it would be a hexafluorobicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene derivative. Hexafluorobenzene loses its aromaticity in this step.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the intermediate and propose the second pericyclic reaction.**\nThe intermediate formed in Step 2 contains a 1,3-cyclohexadiene ring system. This is a conjugated diene with 4π electrons. Such systems can undergo electrocyclic reactions.\n\n*   **Reactant:** The 4π-electron system of the 1,3-cyclohexadiene moiety within the bicyclic intermediate.\n*   **Reaction Type:** Under photochemical conditions, a 4π-electron system can undergo a concerted ring closure. This is an **electrocyclic reaction** (specifically, a 4π electrocyclic ring closure). According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 4π electrocyclic reaction is photochemically allowed (proceeding via a conrotatory motion).\n*   **Final Product:** This ring closure forms another four-membered ring, resulting in a tricyclic system. The skeleton produced is tricyclo[4.2.0.0²,⁵]octane. This skeleton is consistent with the linear fusion of three four-membered rings shown in the product structure.\n\n**Step 4: Consolidate the analysis and address potential inconsistencies.**\nThe overall transformation can be explained by a sequence of two distinct pericyclic reactions: an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition followed by an intramolecular 4π electrocyclic reaction. Both are photochemically allowed.\n\n*   **Careful point:** There is a discrepancy in the number of hydrogen atoms between the starting materials (cyclobutene, C₄H₆) and the drawn product (which has only 4 hydrogens, implying the reactant was cyclobutadiene, C₄H₄, or that H₂ was eliminated). However, the question is about the *types* of pericyclic reactions involved in transforming the general reactant structures into the product skeleton. The proposed mechanism correctly predicts the formation of the tricyclic carbon skeleton and involves two well-established photochemical pericyclic reactions. The most logical conclusion based on the principles of pericyclic chemistry is that these two reactions are the ones that occur.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions are:\n1.  An intermolecular **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n2.  An intramolecular **electrocyclic reaction**.\n\n<<<A [2+2] cycloaddition and an electrocyclic reaction.>>>"
