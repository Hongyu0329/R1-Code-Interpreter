    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Image**\nThe image provided is a black and white photograph of a round bas-relief sculpture, also known as a roundel or tondo. The scene is framed by an ornate circular border with an egg-and-dart pattern, which is itself set within a larger decorative panel. The subject is clearly religious. A priest, standing at an altar with a lit candle, is administering a sacrament, likely the Eucharist (Holy Communion), to a group of kneeling figures, including a child.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying Key Textual Clues**\nAt the bottom of the roundel, there is an inscription on a small scroll or cartouche. Though partially difficult to read, the words appear to be \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\" or something very similar. This can be interpreted as \"Sacramento dell'Altare\" in old Italian, which translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar.\" This confirms the subject is the Eucharist.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Artistic Style**\nThe style of the sculpture is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance, specifically the Florentine Quattrocento (15th century). Key features include:\n*   **Realistic yet idealized figures:** The figures have naturalistic poses and drapery, but also a sense of grace and classical poise.\n*   **Low Relief (Rilievo Schiacciato):** The figures are not fully detached from the background, and the artist creates a sense of depth and perspective with very subtle variations in the carving height. This technique was mastered by artists like Donatello.\n*   **Composition:** The scene is well-organized and harmonious, typical of Renaissance ideals of order and clarity.\n\n**Step 4: Formulating a Research Strategy**\nBased on the observations, the search should focus on:\n*   Italian Renaissance sculpture\n*   The subject \"Sacrament of the Altar\" or \"Eucharist\"\n*   Artwork format: roundel, tondo, or altarpiece detail.\n\n**Step 5: Executing the Research and Identifying the Artwork**\nA search for \"Italian Renaissance sculpture Sacrament of the Altar relief\" or \"Altare del Sacramento scultura Quattrocento\" leads to a well-known masterpiece. This specific roundel is a detail from the predella (the base platform) of the **Altar of the Sacraments** located in the Salutati Chapel in the **Cathedral of Fiesole**, near Florence, Italy. The altarpiece was commissioned by Bishop Leonardo Salutati.\n\n**Step 6: Identifying the Author**\nArt historical records and museum catalogs universally attribute the Altar of the Sacraments in the Fiesole Cathedral to the Florentine sculptor **Mino da Fiesole**. He created this marble altarpiece between 1464 and 1466. Mino da Fiesole was a leading sculptor of his generation, celebrated for the delicacy, refinement, and elegance of his carving, all of which are evident in this detailed relief.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe author of this detail from the Altarpiece of the Sacraments is the 15th-century Italian sculptor Mino da Fiesole.\n\n<<<Mino da Fiesole>>>"
