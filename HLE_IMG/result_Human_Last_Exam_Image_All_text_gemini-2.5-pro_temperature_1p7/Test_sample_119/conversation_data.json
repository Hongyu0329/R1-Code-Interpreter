    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectral data to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis**\n*   **Molecular Ion Peak (M+):** The mass spectrum shows the molecular ion peak at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 135 g/mol.\n*   **Nitrogen Rule:** An odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms. Assuming one nitrogen atom (atomic weight ≈ 14), the remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** A plausible molecular formula that fits this mass is C9H13N (Carbon: 9 × 12 = 108; Hydrogen: 13 × 1 = 13; Nitrogen: 1 × 14 = 14. Total = 108 + 13 + 14 = 135).\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** For C9H13N, the DBE is calculated as: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4. A DBE of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n*   **Fragmentation:** The spectrum shows a significant peak at m/z = 91, which corresponds to the tropylium ion ([C7H7]+), indicating a benzyl-type fragment (C6H5-CH2-). There is also a noticeable peak at m/z = 44. This will be important later for distinguishing between isomers.\n\n**Step 2: Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **~3050 cm⁻¹:** Peaks in this region are characteristic of aromatic C-H stretching.\n*   **~2850-2950 cm⁻¹:** Peaks here indicate aliphatic C-H stretching.\n*   **~1605, 1495, 1455 cm⁻¹:** These absorptions are characteristic of C=C stretching in an aromatic ring.\n*   **No strong C=O peak:** The absence of a strong absorption band around 1700 cm⁻¹ suggests there is no carbonyl group (ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.).\n*   **N-H stretch:** There may be weak to medium peaks in the 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ region, consistent with an amine (N-H) group. A primary amine (-NH2) would typically show two bands, which may be present but not clearly resolved.\n\n**Step 3: ¹H NMR Spectroscopy Analysis**\n*   **δ 7.1-7.3 ppm (multiplet, integration ≈ 5H):** This signal is in the aromatic region and its integration indicates five protons. This is strong evidence for a monosubstituted benzene ring (a phenyl group, C6H5-).\n*   **δ 2.7-3.2 ppm (complex multiplet, total integration ≈ 3H):** This region contains overlapping signals from the aliphatic protons on the side chain. The given integrations (1.96 and 0.97) suggest a 2H signal and a 1H signal.\n*   **δ 1.2 ppm (doublet, integration ≈ 3H):** A 3H doublet points to a methyl group (-CH3) adjacent to a methine group (-CH).\n*   **-NH2 protons:** The two protons of a primary amine group (-NH2) are often broad and may not be clearly visible or integrated correctly, or they could be part of the complex multiplet region.\n*   **Putting it together:** We have a C6H5- group, a -CH-CH3 group, and another group that is likely a -CH2-. The total proton count in the formula C9H13N is 13. We have accounted for 5 (aromatic) + 3 (methyl) + 3 (CH and CH2) = 11 protons. The remaining 2 protons likely belong to an -NH2 group.\n\n**Step 4: ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis**\n*   **¹³C Chemical Shifts:** δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n*   **Aromatic Region (>100 ppm):** There are four signals: 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3. This is consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring, which has one quaternary carbon (ipso) and three types of CH carbons (ortho, meta, para, assuming ortho and meta pairs are equivalent). The peak at 145.1 ppm is the quaternary ipso-carbon (Cq), which does not have any attached protons.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (<100 ppm):** There are three signals: 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. These correspond to the three carbons in the side chain.\n*   **DEPT-135:** This experiment distinguishes between carbon types. CH and CH3 signals are positive, CH2 signals are negative, and Cq signals are absent.\n    *   The information states there is **one negative signal** and **five positive signals**.\n    - The negative signal must be a **CH₂** group.\n    - The five positive signals must be CH and CH₃ groups. From the structure, we have 3 aromatic CH groups, 1 aliphatic CH group, and 1 aliphatic CH₃ group. This totals 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 positive signals.\n    - This count (1 CH₂, 1 CH, 1 CH₃ on the side chain) matches our deductions perfectly.\n\n**Step 5: Proposing and Evaluating Structures**\nBased on the fragments (C6H5-, -CH2-, -CH-, -CH3, -NH2), two constitutional isomers fit the data so far:\n*   **Structure A: 1-phenylpropan-2-amine** (common name: Amphetamine)\n    C6H5-**CH₂**-**CH**(NH₂)-**CH₃**\n*   **Structure B: 2-phenylpropan-1-amine**\n    C6H5-**CH**(CH₃)-**CH₂**(NH₂)\n\nLet's distinguish them using the spectral data:\n*   **Mass Spectrometry:** The dominant fragmentation pathway for amines is α-cleavage (cleavage of the bond adjacent to the C-N bond).\n    *   For structure A, α-cleavage would produce the fragment [CH3-CH=NH₂]⁺ with m/z = 44.\n    *   For structure B, α-cleavage would produce the fragment [CH₂=NH₂]⁺ with m/z = 30.\n    *   The mass spectrum shows a significant peak at **m/z = 44**, strongly supporting **Structure A**.\n*   **¹³C and HSQC NMR:** We can assign the aliphatic ¹³C signals by combining DEPT and HSQC information.\n    *   ¹³C Signals: 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. From DEPT, one is CH₂ (negative), one is CH (positive), one is CH₃ (positive).\n    *   HSQC connects protons to their attached carbons. The provided spectrum shows correlations at (¹H ~1.2, ¹³C ~19), (¹H ~2.8, ¹³C ~43.5), and (¹H ~3.1, ¹³C ~50).\n    *   The signal at 19.2 ppm is clearly the CH₃ carbon.\n    *   Let's analyze Structure A: C6H5-**CH₂**-CH(NH₂)-CH₃. The CH₂ is at a benzylic position (~40-45 ppm) and the CH is attached to nitrogen (~45-55 ppm). This matches assigning the **CH₂ to 43.5 ppm** (which is the negative DEPT signal) and the **CH to 49.6 ppm** (a positive DEPT signal). The HSQC shows protons at ~2.8 ppm correlate with the C at 43.5 ppm (benzylic CH₂) and protons at ~3.1 ppm correlate with the C at 49.6 ppm (CH-N). This is a chemically consistent assignment for Structure A.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion and IUPAC Name**\nAll spectral data, particularly the MS fragmentation (m/z=44) and the detailed analysis of the NMR spectra, point unambiguously to the structure of 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n\n**IUPAC Naming:**\n1.  Identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the amine): a 3-carbon chain (propane).\n2.  Number the chain to give the amine group the lowest possible number: The amine is on carbon 2 (propan-2-amine).\n3.  Identify and number the substituent: A phenyl group is on carbon 1.\n4.  Combine the parts: 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
