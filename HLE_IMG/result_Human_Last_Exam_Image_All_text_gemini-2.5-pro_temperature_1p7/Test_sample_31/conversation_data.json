    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Knot Identification:**\n    *   The first step is to identify the knot shown in the diagram.\n    *   By counting the intersections where one strand crosses over another, we find there are 8 crossings.\n    *   This diagram is a standard representation of a specific knot in knot theory tables. By comparing it to well-known knot diagrams (e.g., in Rolfsen's knot table, the Knot Atlas, or the KnotInfo database), we can identify it as the knot **8₁₉**.\n    *   The knot 8₁₉ is a non-alternating knot, which can be confirmed by trying to apply a checkerboard coloring to the regions of the diagram. It's also known as the **(-2, 3, 3) pretzel knot**.\n\n2.  **Understanding the Rasmussen Invariant (s-invariant):**\n    *   The Rasmussen invariant, denoted as s(K) for a knot K, is a powerful integer-valued knot invariant introduced by Jacob Rasmussen in 2004.\n    *   It is defined using a modified version of Khovanov homology (called Lee homology).\n    *   Calculating s(K) directly from its definition is a complex procedure involving advanced algebraic techniques.\n    *   However, for certain classes of knots, the Rasmussen invariant is related to other, more classical, knot invariants.\n\n3.  **Finding a Key Property of the 8₁₉ Knot:**\n    *   The knot 8₁₉ belongs to a special class of knots called **quasi-alternating knots**.\n    *   Quasi-alternating knots are a broader category that includes all alternating knots. The fact that 8₁₉ is quasi-alternating is a known result in knot theory.\n\n4.  **Using the Formula for Quasi-alternating Knots:**\n    *   A significant theorem established by mathematicians Abhijit Champanerkar and Ilya Kofman provides a simple way to find the Rasmussen invariant for any quasi-alternating knot.\n    *   The theorem states that for a quasi-alternating knot K, its Rasmussen invariant s(K) is exactly equal to its **knot signature**, σ(K).\n    *   The formula is: **s(K) = σ(K)**.\n\n5.  **Determining the Signature of 8₁₉:**\n    *   The knot signature, σ(K), is a classical and fundamental integer invariant of a knot.\n    *   Like the Rasmussen invariant, its direct calculation can be tedious (often done using a Seifert matrix). However, the signatures of most common knots are well-documented.\n    *   Consulting standard knot theory references, such as the KnotInfo database or the Knot Atlas, we find that the signature of the 8₁₉ knot is **-2**.\n    *   So, **σ(8₁₉) = -2**.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Now we can combine the information from the previous steps.\n    *   Since 8₁₉ is quasi-alternating, we use the formula s(8₁₉) = σ(8₁₉).\n    *   Substituting the known value of the signature, we get: s(8₁₉) = -2.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Correct Knot Identification:** The entire analysis hinges on the correct identification of the knot as 8₁₉. The diagram provided is indeed the standard depiction.\n*   **Chirality (Handedness):** The sign of both the signature and the Rasmussen invariant depends on the knot's orientation (i.e., whether it's the knot or its mirror image). The diagram shown is the one conventionally labeled 8₁₉, which has a signature of -2. Its mirror image, m(8₁₉), would have a signature and an s-invariant of +2.\n*   **Reliance on Known Theorems and Data:** The solution relies on the theorem relating the s-invariant and signature for quasi-alternating knots, and on the tabulated value of the signature for 8₁₉. These are established results in the mathematical literature.\n\nThe final answer is obtained by applying the property that for the quasi-alternating knot 8₁₉, the Rasmussen invariant is equal to its signature.\n\n<<< -2 >>>"
