    "*   **Step 1: Plant Identification**\n    *   The primary feature of the plant in the image is its leaves. They are dark green, have an oblong or elliptical shape, and are distinguished by a very prominent network of white or pale green veins. This pattern is known as reticulate venation.\n    *   The leaves appear to be arranged in an opposite or whorled pattern around the stem.\n    *   A search for plants with \"dark green leaves and white net veins\" or \"reticulated leaf venation\" reveals several candidates. One of the most striking matches is a plant from the Acanthaceae family.\n    *   By comparing the image with botanical photos, the plant can be confidently identified as *Ruellia insignis*. The specific combination of leaf shape, color, and the intricate, almost geometric pattern of the veins are characteristic of this species.\n\n*   **Step 2: Determining the Endemic Location**\n    *   The question asks for the name of the island where this plant is endemic. \"Endemic\" means the species is native and restricted to a certain place.\n    *   Now that the plant is identified as *Ruellia insignis*, the next step is to research its native habitat.\n    *   Botanical sources, such as databases from botanical gardens (like Kew), academic papers, and encyclopedias of flora, list the origin of *Ruellia insignis*.\n    *   These sources consistently state that *Ruellia insignis* is endemic to the Socotra Archipelago. Socotra is the main island of this archipelago.\n\n*   **Step 3: Final Answer Formulation**\n    *   The plant is *Ruellia insignis*.\n    *   This plant is endemic to the island of Socotra.\n    *   Therefore, the name of the island is Socotra.\n\n<<<Socotra>>>"
