    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the song's title, musical style, and country of origin from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Musical Notation**\n\n*   **Key and Time Signature:** The sheet music is in the key of C major (no sharps or flats in the key signature) and is written in 4/4 time.\n*   **Tempo:** The tempo marking is \"M.M. ‚ô©=128\", which is a moderately fast tempo, often described as Moderato or Allegro.\n*   **Melody:** The melody is characterized by significant syncopation (rhythms that accent the off-beats), arpeggiated figures (e.g., the first measure is a C major arpeggio: C-E-G-C), and chromaticism (use of notes outside the C major scale, like G# and F#). These features are hallmarks of a specific musical style.\n*   **Harmony (Chords):** The circled letters above the staff are chord symbols. The progression starts with C, then moves to E7, then F. The E7 chord is a secondary dominant (the V7 of A minor), a common harmonic device in jazz. The overall harmonic language, featuring these types of chords in quick succession, points away from simple folk or classical music.\n*   **Structure:** The notation includes \"D.S. to Coda,\" which stands for *Dal Segno al Coda*. This is a standard navigational instruction indicating a repeat from a specific sign (ùÑã) and then a jump to a concluding section (Coda).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Musical Style**\n\nCombining the observations from Step 1:\n*   Syncopated, energetic melody.\n*   A moderately fast tempo suitable for dancing.\n*   A lead sheet format (melody + chords) that encourages improvisation.\n*   Harmonic progressions using secondary dominants.\n\nThese elements are all defining characteristics of **Dixieland Jazz** (also known as Traditional Jazz or New Orleans Jazz). This style flourished in the early 20th century. The \"one-step\" was a popular dance from that era, and music written for it had this energetic, 4/4 feel.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Specific Song Title**\n\nWith the style identified as Dixieland, we can try to recognize the melody.\n*   The opening melodic phrase is a C major arpeggio: C-E-G-C.\n*   This is followed by a very distinctive chromatic line over the E7 chord.\n*   The chord progression `C | E7 | F | ...` is also a clue.\nThis specific melody and harmony are instantly recognizable to those familiar with the genre as **\"Original Dixieland One-Step\"**. It was one of the very first jazz compositions ever recorded.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Country of Origin**\n\n*   **Musical Style:** Dixieland Jazz is a uniquely American musical genre that originated in **New Orleans, Louisiana**, in the early 1900s.\n*   **The Song:** \"Original Dixieland One-Step\" was composed by Nick LaRocca and first recorded in 1917 by the Original Dixieland Jass Band, a group from New Orleans.\n\nTherefore, the country of origin for both the musical style and the specific song is the **USA**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the analysis of the melody, harmony, rhythm, and historical context, the song is identified as follows:\n\n*   **Title:** Original Dixieland One-Step\n*   **Musical Style:** Dixieland Jazz\n*   **Country of Origin:** USA\n\n<<<Title: Original Dixieland One-Step, Musical Style: Dixieland Jazz, Country of Origin: USA>>>"
