    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the sex of each insect. The primary clues for determining sex in these Hymenoptera (bees and wasps) are the length and shape of the antennae, coloration of the face (clypeus), and the shape of the abdomen tip.\n\n**Analysis of Pair A**\n\n*   **Identification:** These are cuckoo bees, likely of the genus *Coelioxys*. Cuckoo bees are brood parasites and do not collect pollen, so the females lack scopae (pollen-carrying hairs), fitting the question's description.\n*   **Left Insect (A-left):** This bee has an abdomen that tapers to a very sharp, conical point. This is a characteristic feature of a female *Coelioxys*, which uses her specialized abdomen to pierce the nest cell of her host to lay an egg.\n*   **Right Insect (A-right):** This bee has a much blunter abdomen. If viewed closely, the tip has multiple short spines, which is characteristic of a male *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Female (F), Right is Male (M). This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair B**\n\n*   **Identification:** These are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. Wasps do not have scopae, as they are generally predators or scavengers, though they do feed on nectar.\n*   **Left Insect (B-left):** The most telling feature is the antennae. The tips of the antennae are distinctly hooked or curled, which is a definitive characteristic of a male paper wasp. The face also appears largely yellow, another common trait of males.\n*   **Right Insect (B-right):** The antennae on this wasp are straight, not curled at the tip. Its face has more prominent black markings compared to the male. This is a female paper wasp. Females also possess a stinger, leading to a more pointed abdominal tip.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Male (M), Right is Female (F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair C**\n\n*   **Identification:** These appear to be long-horned bees (tribe Eucerini). While females of this group do have scopae on their legs (which seems to contradict the prompt's premise), the sexual dimorphism is extremely pronounced and is the most reliable way to identify them. It is likely the premise was a general statement about the collector's focus rather than a strict rule for every single specimen shown.\n*   **Left Insect (C-left):** This bee has exceptionally long antennae that curve back over its body, the defining feature of a male long-horned bee. It also has a yellow patch on its face (the clypeus), another common male characteristic.\n*   **Right Insect (C-right):** This bee has much shorter antennae, which is typical for a female of this group. The face is dark, lacking the male's yellow clypeus.\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male (M), Right is Female (F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Final Answer Compilation**\n\n*   Pair A: F, M corresponds to index **4**.\n*   Pair B: M, F corresponds to index **3**.\n*   Pair C: M, F corresponds to index **3**.\n\nCombining the indices for A, B, and C gives the final answer.\n\n<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
