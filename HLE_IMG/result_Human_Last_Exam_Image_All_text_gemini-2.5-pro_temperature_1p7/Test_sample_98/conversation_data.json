    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Object Identification:** The image displays a medallion with a circular body and a suspension tab at the top. The central design features two profile busts facing each other.\n    2.  **Stylistic Analysis:** The style of the figures is not classical Roman or Greek. The facial features, particularly the eyes and the patterned, stylized hair, are characteristic of the art of the Migration Period in Northern Europe. This style marks a departure from the naturalism of Roman art towards a more abstract and ornamental aesthetic, often referred to as Germanic style. The depiction of facing busts is likely an imitation of late Roman imperial medallions, which often showed the emperor and his family.\n    3.  **Specific Artifact Identification:** This specific artifact is well-known in archaeology. It is the \"Skrydstrup bracteate,\" a gold medallion (a bracteate is a thin, single-sided metal disc) found in Skrydstrup, South Jutland, Denmark.\n    4.  **Archaeological Context and Dating:** Bracteates of this type are quintessential artifacts of the Northern European Migration Period. They were produced primarily in Scandinavia between the 5th and 7th centuries. Based on hoard contexts, typological series, and stylistic evolution from Roman prototypes, archaeologists have been able to establish a relatively firm chronology. The Skrydstrup bracteate, with its double-portrait motif, is a classic example from this era.\n    5.  **Conclusion on Century:** The consensus among archaeologists and art historians is that the production of this type of gold bracteate, including the Skrydstrup example, peaked during the 5th century A.D. It is dated specifically to the period between c. 450 and 500 A.D. Therefore, archaeologists ascribe the medallion to the 5th century A.D.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   Distinguish the style from earlier, more naturalistic Roman art. The stylization is the key chronological marker.\n    *   Recognize the object type as a bracteate, a specific class of artifact from the Migration Period.\n    *   Understand that while it imitates a Roman form (the medallion), the execution is distinctly Germanic.\n    *   The dating is based on comparative archaeology and stylistic analysis of a large corpus of similar finds from Northern Europe.\n\n<<<5th century A.D.>>>"
