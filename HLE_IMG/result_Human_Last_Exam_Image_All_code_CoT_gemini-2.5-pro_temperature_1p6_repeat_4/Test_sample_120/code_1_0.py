    print("1. The nematic phase requires efficient parallel packing of molecules.")
    print("2. The added methyl group is a lateral substituent, which increases the molecule's width and provides steric hindrance.")
    print("3. This steric hindrance disrupts the ordered parallel packing, destabilizing the nematic phase.")
    print("4. Conclusion: A less stable nematic phase results in a LOWER nematic-isotropic transition temperature (T_NI).")

    print("We need the answer choice that states the relaxation time DECREASES and the transition temperature DECREASES.")
    print("Let's review the remaining option E:")
    print(" - Part 1: '...decreases the correlation time... leading to a decreased relaxation time.' -> CORRECT.")
    print(" - Part 2: '...disrupts crystallinity, leading to a lower nematic-isotropic transition temperature.' -> CORRECT.")
    print("\nTherefore, option E is the correct answer.")
