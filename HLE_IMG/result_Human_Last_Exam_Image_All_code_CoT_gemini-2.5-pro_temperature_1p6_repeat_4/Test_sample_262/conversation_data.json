    "This is a chemistry problem that can be solved by analyzing the stability of the molecular structures. Here is my step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structures:** All four molecules are Iridium(III) complexes. They share a common ancillary ligand (4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine) but differ in their two cyclometalating phenylpyridine (C^N) ligands.\n2.  **Relate Structure to Lifetime:** The operational lifetime of an emitter in a light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) is strongly dependent on its chemical stability. More stable molecules will lead to longer device lifetimes.\n3.  **Identify Key Stability Factor:** For this type of iridium complex, a critical factor for stability is the substitution on the phenyl ring of the C^N ligand. Fluorine substitution is a well-known strategy to enhance stability. The electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms strengthen the crucial Ir-C bond. Furthermore, placing a fluorine atom at the position ortho to the Ir-C bond (the C-H bond adjacent to the metallated carbon) is particularly effective, as it blocks a common degradation pathway.\n4.  **Evaluate Each Complex:**\n    *   **Complex 1:** Contains one 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine ligand (`dFppy`) and one unsubstituted 2-phenylpyridine ligand (`ppy`). The `ppy` ligand lacks any fluorination and has a vulnerable C-H bond, making it the least stable type of ligand.\n    *   **Complex 2:** Contains two `dFppy` ligands. Both are fluorinated, making this complex very stable.\n    *   **Complex 3:** Contains one 2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine ligand (`Fppy`) and one `ppy` ligand. Like complex 1, the presence of the unstable `ppy` ligand is a weak point.\n    *   **Complex 4:** Contains one `dFppy` and one `Fppy` ligand. Both ligands are fluorinated and therefore stable.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Complexes that contain the least stable `ppy` ligand are expected to degrade faster and thus exhibit shorter lifetimes. Therefore, complexes 1 and 3 are the correct answer.\n\nI will now write a Python script to formalize this analysis and identify the complexes with the shorter lifetimes.\n\n```python\ndef find_unstable_complexes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies iridium complexes with shorter expected lifetimes based on ligand stability.\n\n    The lifetime of these emitters is linked to their chemical stability.\n    Fluorination of the cyclometalating phenylpyridine (C^N) ligands enhances stability.\n    The unsubstituted ligand, 2-phenylpyridine ('ppy'), is known to be less stable\n    and leads to shorter lifetimes in devices.\n\n    This script checks which complexes contain this less stable ligand.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Defining the cyclometalating (C^N) ligands for each complex.\n    # The 'ppy' ligand is identified by its chemical name '2-phenylpyridine'.\n    complex_ligands = {\n        1: ['2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine', '2-phenylpyridine'],\n        2: ['2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine', '2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine'],\n        3: ['2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine', '2-phenylpyridine'],\n        4: ['2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine', '2-(2-fluorophenyl)pyridine']\n    }\n\n    unstable_ligand_name = '2-phenylpyridine'\n    short_lifetime_complexes = []\n\n    for complex_number, ligands in complex_ligands.items():\n        if unstable_ligand_name in ligands:\n            short_lifetime_complexes.append(complex_number)\n\n    print(\"The complexes expected to show shorter lifetimes are those containing the least stable '2-phenylpyridine' ligand.\")\n    print(f\"Complex {short_lifetime_complexes[0]} contains this ligand.\")\n    print(f\"Complex {short_lifetime_complexes[1]} contains this ligand.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the final answer is [{short_lifetime_complexes[0]}, {short_lifetime_complexes[1]}].\")\n\nfind_unstable_complexes()\n```\n<<<F>>>"
