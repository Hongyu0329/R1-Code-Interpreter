    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts**: I will visually inspect the raster plot to identify the distinct, dense vertical bands of activity. These bands represent synchronized firing bursts across multiple electrodes.\n2.  **Estimate Timestamps**: For each identified burst, I will estimate the time at which it is centered by reading the corresponding value on the x-axis (Time in seconds).\n3.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**: I will calculate the time difference between each consecutive pair of burst timestamps.\n4.  **Calculate Average IBI**: I will compute the average of all the calculated inter-burst intervals.\n5.  **Format the Output**: I will write a Python script that takes the estimated timestamps, calculates the intervals and the average, prints the entire calculation process, and rounds the final answer to two significant figures.\n\nBased on my analysis of the graph, I have identified the following burst timestamps: 2 s, 13 s, 22 s, 34 s, 45 s, and 49 s.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_average_ibi():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the average inter-burst interval from a list of burst timestamps.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts from the graph.\n    # The timestamps are estimated by finding the center of each dense vertical band of activity.\n    burst_timestamps = [2, 13, 22, 34, 45, 49]\n    print(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs).\n    # IBI is the difference in time between consecutive bursts.\n    inter_burst_intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\n    \n    print(\"\\nCalculating Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):\")\n    # Using a for loop to print the calculation for each interval\n    equation_parts = []\n    for i in range(len(inter_burst_intervals)):\n      interval = burst_timestamps[i+1] - burst_timestamps[i]\n      print(f\"  Interval {i+1}: {burst_timestamps[i+1]} s - {burst_timestamps[i]} s = {interval} s\")\n      equation_parts.append(str(interval))\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the average IBI.\n    average_ibi = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\n\n    # Step 4: Display the final calculation and round to two significant figures.\n    sum_of_intervals = sum(inter_burst_intervals)\n    num_intervals = len(inter_burst_intervals)\n    \n    print(\"\\nCalculating the average IBI:\")\n    print(f\"  Average IBI = ({' + '.join(equation_parts)}) / {num_intervals}\")\n    print(f\"  Average IBI = {sum_of_intervals} / {num_intervals}\")\n    print(f\"  Average IBI = {average_ibi:.3f} s\")\n\n    # Round to two significant figures\n    # To round to 'n' significant figures, you can use a format string.\n    # For a number like 9.4, '{:.1f}' gives one decimal place, which is two sig figs.\n    # For a number like 10.5, '{:.2f}' would be needed. A general solution is more complex.\n    # For 9.4, formatting to 1 decimal place is equivalent to 2 significant figures.\n    final_answer = float(f\"{average_ibi:.1f}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe average inter-burst interval rounded to two significant figures is: {final_answer} s\")\n\ncalculate_average_ibi()\n```\n<<<9.4>>>"
