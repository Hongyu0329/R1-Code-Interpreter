    This function determines the location of the new double bond in the product of the given intramolecular Heck reaction.

    The reaction proceeds via:
    1. Oxidative addition of Pd(0) to the C9-Br bond.
    2. Intramolecular carbopalladation: C9 attacks C5, and Pd attaches to C4.
    3. Beta-hydride elimination: Pd at C4 eliminates a hydrogen from C3.

    This results in a new double bond between C3 and C4.
