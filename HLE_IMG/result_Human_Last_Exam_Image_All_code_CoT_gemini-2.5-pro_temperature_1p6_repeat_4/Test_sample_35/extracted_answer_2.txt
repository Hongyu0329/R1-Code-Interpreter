The S100B protein exhibits a strong affinity for the **V-domain of the RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products) receptor**. 

It could be used as a **prognostic marker** in the pathology of neurological disorders. The reason is that its level of expression is not just an indicator of disease presence but an active driver of its progression. As shown in the pathway, increased S100B binding to RAGE directly activates downstream signaling (via NFÎºB and JNK/JUN) that leads to apoptosis, neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration. Therefore, the concentration of S100B would directly correlate with the severity and advancement of the disease, allowing clinicians to predict the patient's future outcome, which is the primary function of a prognostic marker.
