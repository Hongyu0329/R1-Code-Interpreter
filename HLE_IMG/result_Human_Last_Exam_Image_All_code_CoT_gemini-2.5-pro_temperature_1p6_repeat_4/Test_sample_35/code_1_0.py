        "portion of RAGE, which consists of several immunoglobulin-like domains. The diagram shows S100B "

        "S100B should be considered a prognostic marker rather than solely an adjunct marker. Here's why:\n"
        "- The diagram illustrates that the binding of S100B to RAGE is not just a sign of disease presence but an active trigger of disease progression.\n"
        "- This binding activates downstream pathways like NFÎºB and JNK/JUN.\n"
        "- These pathways lead directly to pathological outcomes critical to the severity and advancement of neurological disorders: Apoptosis (cell death), production of proinflammatory cytokines, Neuroinflammation, Neuronal loss, and Neurodegeneration.\n"
        "- Therefore, the level of S100B expression would directly correlate with the extent of this pathological damage. Higher levels of S100B would predict a worse disease course and a more severe outcome for the patient. This ability to forecast the progression and severity of a disease is the definition of a prognostic marker."

        "like neuroinflammation and neuronal loss, it serves as a powerful prognostic marker for assessing the future severity "
