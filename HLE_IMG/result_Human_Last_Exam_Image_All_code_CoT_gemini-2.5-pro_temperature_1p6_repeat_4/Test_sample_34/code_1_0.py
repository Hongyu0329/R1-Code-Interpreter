Step 1: Deconstructing the Kinship Diagram

The diagram uses standard anthropological symbols:
- Triangle (Δ): Male
- Circle (o): Female
- Double Line (=): Marriage (Husband/Wife)
- Horizontal Line (―): Siblingship (Brother/Sister)
- Diagonal/Vertical Line: Descent (Parent/Child)
- Plus Sign (+): Represents a familiar, warm, or tender relationship.
- Minus Sign (-): Represents a formal, hostile, or austere relationship.

The four relationships depicted are:
1.  Brother / Sister (top right o ― Δ): Marked with a '+'. This is a FAMILIAR relationship.
2.  Husband / Wife (left Δ = o): Marked with a '-'. This is a HOSTILE/AUSTERE relationship.
3.  Father / Son (left Δ to bottom Δ): Marked with a '+'. This is a FAMILIAR relationship.
4.  Mother's Brother / Sister's Son (top right Δ to bottom Δ): Marked with a '-'. This is a HOSTILE/AUSTERE relationship.

Step 2: Identifying the Core Kinship Principle

The key to interpreting the system lies in the axis of authority.
- The Father-Son relationship is familiar (+). This implies the father is not the primary disciplinarian or source of authority.
- The Mother's Brother-Sister's Son relationship is hostile/austere (-). This implies the maternal uncle holds authority, property rights, and responsibility over his nephew.

This pattern, where the maternal uncle is the authority figure and the biological father is an affectionate friend, is the defining characteristic of a MATRILINEAL descent system.

In a PATRILINEAL system, the roles would be reversed: the Father-Son relationship would be austere (-) as the father holds authority, and the Mother's Brother-Sister's Son relationship would be familiar (+). The diagram clearly does not show a patrilineal structure.

Step 3: Evaluating the Answer Choices

The diagram represents a matrilineal system. We can now eliminate any options that include patrilineal systems.

A. Trobriand-matrilineal and Siuoi-matrilineal -> Both are matrilineal. Plausible.
B. Siuoi-matrilineal and Lake Kubutu-patrilineal -> Contains a patrilineal system. Incorrect.
C. Lake Kubutu-patrilineal and Tonga-patrilineal -> Both are patrilineal. Incorrect.
D. Tonga-patrilineal and Cherkess-patrilineal -> Both are patrilineal. Incorrect.
E. Cherkess-patrilineal and Trobiand-matrilineal -> Contains a patrilineal system. Incorrect.

Step 4: Conclusion

After eliminating all options containing patrilineal systems, only option A remains. Both the Trobriand Islanders (studied by Malinowski) and the Siuoi are classic anthropological examples of matrilineal societies. Their kinship structures are known to exhibit the key dynamic shown in the diagram: a familiar relationship with the father and a formal, authoritative relationship with the mother's brother. Therefore, the diagram correctly represents these systems.
