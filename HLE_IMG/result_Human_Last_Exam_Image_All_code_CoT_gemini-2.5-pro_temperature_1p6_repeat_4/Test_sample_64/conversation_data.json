    "This image displays a time-lapse sequence (L, M, N) of a biological process in a filamentous fungus. Here is a Python script to describe what is happening.\n\nPlan:\n1.  Identify the structure shown in the micrographs. It is a filamentous structure with cross-walls (septa), which is characteristic of a fungal hypha.\n2.  Analyze the changes occurring across the three panels, L, M, and N, paying close attention to the areas marked by arrowheads.\n3.  Panel L shows a relatively straight hypha with an arrow pointing to a septum.\n4.  In panel M, a bulge has formed on the side wall near the same septum.\n5.  In panel N, this bulge has grown into a new branch, causing the original hypha to bend.\n6.  This sequence—bulge formation from the side of an existing cell compartment leading to a new branch—is known as protoplasmic regeneration, often occurring after cell injury. The original hypha was likely cut, and the remaining living fragment is now regenerating a new growing point.\n7.  Write a Python script that prints a clear description of this entire process.\n\n```python\ndef describe_biological_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function describes the biological process shown in the provided image series.\n  \"\"\"\n  description = (\n      \"The image depicts the process of protoplasmic regeneration in a fungal hypha.\\n\"\n      \"This is a time-lapse sequence showing how a fungal cell fragment can recover from injury and initiate new growth.\\n\\n\"\n      \"The steps shown are:\\n\"\n      \"1. Panel L: An initial bulge (indicated by the arrowhead) appears on the side wall of a hyphal compartment, near a septum (cross-wall).\\n\"\n      \"2. Panel M: The bulge grows larger as protoplasm (the cell's living content) pushes against the cell wall.\\n\"\n      \"3. Panel N: The bulge has developed into a new, thin hypha (a new branch), which begins to grow and elongate, demonstrating the remarkable regenerative capacity of fungi.\"\n  )\n  print(description)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n  describe_biological_process()\n```\n<<<The process shown is the protoplasmic regeneration and branching of a fungal hypha following an injury. It begins with the formation of a lateral bulge near a septum, which then develops into a new hyphal branch.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
