    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the two-dimensional pattern formed when a three-dimensional Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal is projected along the [110] direction and match it to one of the given images.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the FCC Structure:** An FCC lattice has atoms at the corners of a cubic unit cell and at the center of each of its six faces. We can define a basis of four atoms for the conventional unit cell. Let the lattice parameter be `a`. The basis atoms are at positions `(0,0,0)`, `(a/2, a/2, 0)`, `(a/2, 0, a/2)`, and `(0, a/2, a/2)`. The entire lattice is generated by translating this basis by integer multiples of the lattice vectors `(a,0,0)`, `(0,a,0)`, and `(0,0,a)`.\n\n2.  **Define the Projection:** Viewing along the [110] direction means we are projecting the 3D atomic coordinates onto a 2D plane perpendicular to the `[1,1,0]` vector. We can set up a new coordinate system where the viewing direction is one axis. A convenient choice for the new 2D plane axes, which are orthogonal to `[1,1,0]`, is `[1,-1,0]` and `[0,0,1]`.\n\n3.  **Calculate Projected Coordinates:** We will transform the 3D coordinates of the FCC atoms into this new 2D coordinate system. An atom at `(x, y, z)` will be projected to a point `(x', y')` where `x'` is proportional to `x-y` and `y'` is proportional to `z`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Projected Pattern:** The resulting 2D pattern of projected atom positions for an FCC lattice viewed along [110] is a **centered rectangular lattice**. The side lengths of this rectangle are in the ratio `sqrt(2) : 1`.\n\n5.  **Compare with Options:**\n    *   **A:** Shows two interlocking simple rectangular lattices. This pattern corresponds to a BCC (Body-Centered Cubic) lattice viewed along [110].\n    *   **B:** Shows a centered square lattice. This corresponds to a BCC lattice viewed along [100].\n    *   **D:** Shows a pattern of a square grid with atoms on corners and edge-centers. This corresponds to an FCC lattice viewed along [100].\n    *   **C:** Shows a centered rectangular lattice. This matches the expected pattern for an FCC lattice viewed along [110]. The bounding box is also rectangular, as expected from the orthogonal projection axes. While the aspect ratio in the drawing isn't perfectly `sqrt(2)`, the topology of the lattice is correct and distinct from the other options.\n\nThe following Python code generates the theoretical coordinates for the FCC [110] projection to confirm this analysis.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef generate_fcc_projection(a=1.0, supercell_range=(-1, 2)):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates the 2D coordinates of an FCC lattice projected along the [110] direction.\n    \n    Returns:\n        A dictionary containing the coordinates of the corner and center atoms \n        of a characteristic unit rectangle in the projection.\n    \"\"\"\n    # FCC basis atoms in a conventional unit cell\n    basis = np.array([\n        [0, 0, 0],\n        [0.5, 0.5, 0],\n        [0.5, 0, 0.5],\n        [0, 0.5, 0.5]\n    ]) * a\n\n    # Generate atoms in a supercell to see the repeating pattern\n    atoms_3d = []\n    for i in range(supercell_range[0], supercell_range[1]):\n        for j in range(supercell_range[0], supercell_range[1]):\n            for k in range(supercell_range[0], supercell_range[1]):\n                translation = np.array([i, j, k]) * a\n                for b in basis:\n                    atoms_3d.append(b + translation)\n    \n    atoms_3d = np.array(atoms_3d)\n\n    # Project atoms onto the plane perpendicular to [110].\n    # The new 2D axes can be chosen along [1,-1,0] and [0,0,1].\n    # x_proj = (x - y) / sqrt(2)\n    # y_proj = z\n    atoms_2d = []\n    for p in atoms_3d:\n        x_proj = (p[0] - p[1])\n        y_proj = p[2]\n        atoms_2d.append([x_proj, y_proj])\n        \n    # Remove duplicate points resulting from projection\n    atoms_2d = np.unique(np.round(atoms_2d, decimals=5), axis=0)\n\n    # Identify the corners and center of a unit rectangle\n    # The projected lattice has basis vectors corresponding to the 3D vectors a*[1,0,0] and a/2*[0,1,1].
