    "My plan to identify the artist of the painting is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the artwork:** I will examine the style, subject matter, and unique elements within the painting. The style is clearly Surrealist, featuring a blend of realistic depiction with illogical and dreamlike scenes. Key elements include a room interior merging with various exterior landscapes (an icy sea, an ocean with a ship), a fire burning books, and a bust with leafy hair.\n2.  **Formulate a search query:** Based on the visual analysis, I will use descriptive terms for a search. A query like \"surrealist painting room ocean fire burning books\" or a reverse image search would be effective.\n3.  **Identify the artwork and artist:** The search results will likely point to the painting's title and its creator. I will cross-reference the results to confirm the artist's name. The painting is known as *Exploration of the Sources of the Orinoco River* (1959).\n4.  **Confirm the artist:** The artist associated with this work is Remedios Varo, a Spanish-Mexican surrealist painter renowned for her detailed and allegorical style.\n5.  **Generate the code:** I will write a simple Python script to print the artist's name as the final output.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the artist of the provided painting.\n    \"\"\"\n    artist_name = \"Remedios Varo\"\n    print(f\"The artist of the following painting is: {artist_name}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Remedios Varo>>>"
