    Analyzes the provided options to find the most cost-effective solution for improving video function recommendations.
    
    The problem is a classic case of imbalanced data, where the model is biased towards the majority class (audio processing).
    Let's evaluate the choices based on effectiveness and cost.
    
    A. Add more training data for video processing: Effective, but collecting and labeling data is expensive and time-consuming.
    
    B. Use resampling: This involves techniques like oversampling the minority class (video data) or undersampling the majority class (audio data). It works on the existing dataset, making it very cheap to implement while being effective at mitigating imbalance.
    
    C. Train two separate models: This doubles the maintenance and operational overhead, making it costly.
    
    D. Add specific states for audio/video: This requires a fundamental and costly redesign of the model architecture.
    
    E. Use an LLM: This is the most powerful but also by far the most expensive option in terms of computation, development, and deployment.
    
    Conclusion: Resampling (B) provides the best balance of effectiveness and low cost. It directly addresses the data imbalance issue without requiring new data or a new model architecture.
