    This function analyzes the features of the target nyala and compares them to the options.
    
    Analysis:
    1. The target nyala has several key features for identification:
        - Horn shape: Curved back, then forward, with light tips.
        - Stripe pattern: Thin, vertical white stripes.
        - Spot pattern: A very distinct cluster of three main white spots on the flank, behind the shoulder. This is the most unique identifier.
    
    2. Comparison with options:
        - A: Different stripe pattern, looks younger, no matching spots.
        - B: Shows the exact same unique cluster of white spots on the flank. Stripe pattern and general build are also consistent.
        - C: Different coloration and much thicker stripes.
        - D: Lacks the distinctive spot cluster.
        - E: Lacks the distinctive spot cluster.
        - F: Key body parts are obscured.
        
    3. Conclusion: The spot pattern is a clear match between the Target and image B.
