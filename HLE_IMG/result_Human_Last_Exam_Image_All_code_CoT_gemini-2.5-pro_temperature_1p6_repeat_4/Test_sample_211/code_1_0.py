# The user wants me to identify the sociable weaver from the set of options (A-I) 
# that matches the target image.

# Step 1: Analyze the target image.
# The target bird has a detailed scalloped feather pattern on its back and wings.
# A key feature is a small, unique dark spot or feather misalignment on the left 
# side of the bird's back, slightly below the shoulder area.

# Step 2: Compare the target with each option image.
# - A, D, H show different poses or lighting, making direct comparison difficult.
# - B, C, E, F, I have similar patterns, but upon close inspection, they lack the specific, unique marking seen on the target bird.
# - G shows the bird from an almost identical angle. The overall scalloped pattern is a strong match. 
#   Most importantly, the unique dark spot on the left side of the back is clearly visible in the same position as on the target bird.

# Step 3: Conclude the match.
# Based on the identical feather pattern and the presence of the unique identifying mark, image G is the correct match.

# Step 4: Output the answer using a print function.
correct_image = 'G'
