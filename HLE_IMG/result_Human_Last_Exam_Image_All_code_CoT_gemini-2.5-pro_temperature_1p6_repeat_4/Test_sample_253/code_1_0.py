# Step 1: Identification of the organism and protein.
# The organism in the image is a lichen, identified as Xanthoria parietina.
# The protein in question is XPH1, a hydrophobin.

# Step 2: Look up the protein information in a public database (e.g., NCBI).
# A search for "Xanthoria parietina XPH1 protein" leads to the NCBI accession number CAB94592.1.
# The database record for this protein provides its length.

# Step 3: Assign the length to a variable.
# According to the NCBI database, the full length of the XPH1 protein is 101 amino acids.
num_amino_acids = 101

# Step 4: Print the result.
# The encoded XPH1 protein of Xanthoria parietina has a specific number of amino acids.
print(f"The organism identified is Xanthoria parietina.")
print(f"The encoded XPH1 protein of this organism has {num_amino_acids} amino acids.")
