    "Based on the structural information from the image, I have identified the protein. The image displays the crystal structure of human Caspase-8 complexed with an inhibitor peptide from the CrmA protein of the cowpox virus. Caspase-8 is a critical enzyme involved in the process of apoptosis, or programmed cell death.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to output the name of the primary protein shown.\n\n```python\ndef identify_protein():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the protein from the provided image.\n  The image shows the 3D structure of human Caspase-8 (in dark blue)\n  bound to a CrmA inhibitor peptide (in light blue).\n  The PDB (Protein Data Bank) ID for this structure is 3H11.\n  \"\"\"\n  protein_name = \"Caspase-8\"\n  print(f\"The name of the main protein shown in the image is: {protein_name}\")\n\nidentify_protein()\n```\n<<<Caspase-8>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the name of this protein?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
