    "This is a tetracyclic quinolizidine alkaloid. My plan is to identify the compound from its chemical structure and then use a python script to print its name.\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure:** The molecule is a complex polycyclic system containing nitrogen atoms, characteristic of an alkaloid. It possesses a tetracyclic (four-ring) framework.\n2.  **Identify key features:** There are two nitrogen atoms integrated into the fused ring system. There is also a carbonyl group (C=O) adjacent to one of the nitrogen atoms, making this a lactam functional group.\n3.  **Search knowledge base:** Based on this specific tetracyclic lactam structure, I can identify the compound as **Matrine**. It is a common alkaloid found in plants from the genus *Sophora*.\n4.  **Create Python script:** I will now write a simple Python script to print the name of the identified compound.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the name of the alkaloid compound.\ncompound_name = \"Matrine\"\nprint(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n```\n<<<Matrine>>>"

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
