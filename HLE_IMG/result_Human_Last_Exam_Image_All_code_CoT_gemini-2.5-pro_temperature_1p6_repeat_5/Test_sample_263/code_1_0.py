# This is a conceptual problem in chemistry that does not require coding to solve.
# The reasoning is provided in the text explanation above.
#
# Summary of Reasoning:
# 1. Complex 1 is a standard benchmark molecule ([Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+).
# 2. Complex 2 improves upon Complex 1 by using a more rigid and electron-accepting ancillary ligand,
#    which enhances stability against reductive degradation.
# 3. Complex 3 improves upon Complex 1 by using two distinct strategies:
#    a) Fluorinating the cyclometalating ligands to strengthen the Ir-C bond.
#    b) Adding bulky tert-butyl groups to the ancillary ligand to provide steric protection against degradation.
# 4. Since both Complex 2 and Complex 3 are explicitly designed with features known to enhance stability
#    over the benchmark (Complex 1), the most accurate statement is that LECs based on both of these
#    complexes would be more stable.

# Let's assign stability scores for illustrative purposes based on the analysis
# (This is not a real calculation, just a way to represent the logic)
stability_complex_1 = 1.0 # Baseline
stability_complex_2 = 1.5 # Improved ancillary ligand
stability_complex_3 = 1.8 # Two strong stabilization strategies (fluorination + sterics)

# Based on this, the statement "LECs based on complex 2 and 3 are more stable"
# (implying more stable than complex 1) is the most robust conclusion.

print("Complex 1 is the baseline benchmark.")
print("Complex 2 incorporates a stabilizing rigid, electron-accepting ancillary ligand.")
print("Complex 3 incorporates two stabilizing features: fluorination of the cyclometalating ligand to strengthen the Ir-C bond and bulky groups on the ancillary ligand for steric protection.")
print("Conclusion: Both Complex 2 and Complex 3 are designed for higher stability than Complex 1.")
print("\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer is that LECs based on complex 2 and 3 are more stable.")
