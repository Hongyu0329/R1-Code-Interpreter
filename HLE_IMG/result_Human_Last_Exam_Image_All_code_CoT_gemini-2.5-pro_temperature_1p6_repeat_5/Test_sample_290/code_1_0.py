    """
    Analyzes the visual clues from the provided image to determine the city.

    The image displays several key features:
    1. A coastal scene with a dark beach.
    2. Evergreen trees, typical of the Pacific Northwest.
    3. People enjoying a bonfire, which are permitted in designated pits at certain parks.
    4. A prominent chain-link fence separating the viewing point from the beach.

    These features strongly point to Golden Gardens Park in Seattle, Washington. The park is famous
    for its beach bonfires on Puget Sound and has a railway line running alongside it,
    often separated by a fence just like the one in the picture.
