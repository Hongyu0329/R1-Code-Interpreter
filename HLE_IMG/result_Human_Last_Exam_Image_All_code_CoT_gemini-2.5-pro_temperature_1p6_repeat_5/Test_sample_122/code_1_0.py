    This function analyzes the provided three-step chemical reaction and determines the name of the final product.

    The reaction is as follows:
    1.  L-Tryptophan is reacted with CbzCl and NaOH. This protects the alpha-amino group with a Cbz group, forming N-Cbz-Tryptophan.
    2.  N-Cbz-Tryptophan is coupled with O-benzylhydroxylamine using EDC/HOBt. This converts the carboxylic acid to an O-benzyl hydroxamate, forming N-Cbz-Tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.
    3.  The product from step 2 is treated with H2 and Pd/C. This catalytic hydrogenolysis removes both the N-Cbz group and the O-benzyl group.

    The resulting molecule is L-Tryptophan with its carboxylic acid functional group (-COOH) replaced by a hydroxamic acid functional group (-CONHOH).
