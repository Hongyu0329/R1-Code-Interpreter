# Plan:
# 1. Identify the most efficient modern synthesis for the target molecule.
#    This is a 2-step process from 2,7-dibromopyrene and (2,6-dimethylphenyl)boronic acid.
# 2. Estimate the number of steps to synthesize the required precursors from the given starting materials.
#    - Synthesis of 2,7-dibromopyrene from 2-acetylnaphthalene is the longest path.
#    - A reasonable estimate for pyrene synthesis from 2-acetylnaphthalene is 3 steps.
#    - Bromination of pyrene to 2,7-dibromopyrene is 1 step.
#    - Total for this precursor: 3 + 1 = 4 steps.
# 3. The synthesis of the second precursor runs in parallel and is shorter (estimated at 3 steps), so it does not determine the total length.
# 4. The total minimum steps is the length of the longest linear path (4 steps) plus the final 2 synthesis steps.
# 5. The final equation will show the sum of steps for the longest path.

steps_to_pyrene = 3
steps_to_dibromopyrene = 1
steps_for_suzuki_coupling = 1
steps_for_final_cyclization = 1

total_steps = steps_to_pyrene + steps_to_dibromopyrene + steps_for_suzuki_coupling + steps_for_final_cyclization

# Output the equation and the final answer.
# Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!
print(f"{steps_to_pyrene} + {steps_to_dibromopyrene} + {steps_for_suzuki_coupling} + {steps_for_final_cyclization} = {total_steps}")

# The minimum number of steps is the result of the calculation.
print(f"The minimum number of steps is {total_steps}.")
