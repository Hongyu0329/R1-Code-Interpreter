    "Of course, I can help you with that.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the provided image to identify key stylistic elements. The painting is clearly in the surrealist or fantastical realism style, featuring a room where different realities collide: a wall opens to a glacial landscape, a door opens to the sea, and books are burning in a fireplace. I will use these distinctive features to search for the painting and its creator. Once the artist is identified, I will generate a Python script to print their name as requested.\n\n```python\n# The painting is identified as \"The Library is on Fire\"\n# or \"Biblio-holocaust\".\n# The artist is a well-known Polish surrealist painter.\n\nartist = \"Jacek Yerka\"\n\n# Printing the name of the artist.\nprint(f\"The artist of the painting is {artist}.\")\n```\n<<<Jacek Yerka>>>"

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
