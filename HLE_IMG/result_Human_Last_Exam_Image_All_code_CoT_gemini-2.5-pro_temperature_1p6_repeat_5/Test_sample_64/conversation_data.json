    "My analysis of the image reveals a biological process occurring in a time sequence.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n1.  **Observe the structure:** The image shows a long, thin, segmented structure characteristic of a fungal hypha. The segments are separated by cross-walls called septa.\n2.  **Follow the sequence (L -> M -> N):** The three panels, labeled L, M, and N, illustrate a progression over time.\n    *   In panel **L**, we see a relatively straight hypha. An arrowhead points to a septum, indicating a point of interest.\n    *   In panel **M**, a small, new outgrowth or bulge has appeared on the side of the hypha at the location previously marked. The arrowhead now highlights this bulge.\n    *   In panel **N**, the outgrowth has elongated and started to form a new hypha, initiating a branch from the original filament.\n3.  **Identify the process:** This sequence of events, where a new hypha emerges from the side of an existing one, is known as **hyphal branching**. This is a fundamental mechanism for the growth and spread of fungi, allowing them to form an extensive network called a mycelium.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef identify_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function analyzes the described image sequence and identifies the biological process.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The image shows three stages (L, M, N) of a developing fungal hypha.\n  # Stage L: A mature hypha is shown, with a septum indicated by an arrowhead.\n  # Stage M: A new outgrowth begins to form from the side of the hypha.\n  # Stage N: The outgrowth elongates and forms a new branch.\n  process = \"Hyphal branching\"\n  print(f\"The process being depicted in the image is: {process}\")\n\nidentify_process()\n```\n<<<Hyphal branching>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
