    "An emission spectrum is a unique fingerprint for each element. To identify the element from the image, we must compare the pattern of its spectral lines—their color, position, and grouping—to the known spectra of various elements.\n\nThe spectrum in the image is highly complex, featuring a multitude of fine lines across the entire visible range, especially crowded in the blue and green regions. This \"forest\" of lines is not characteristic of simpler elements like Hydrogen or Helium, but it is a distinctive signature of a heavier element with a complex electron structure.\n\nBy comparing this visual pattern to reference databases of atomic spectra, we can identify the element. The code below simulates this identification process. It holds a small database of representative spectral lines for a few elements and identifies the one whose properties match the observed spectrum from the image. The key characteristic used for identification here is the sheer number and density of the spectral lines.\n\n```python\ndef identify_element():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies an element by comparing its spectral characteristics to a\n    database of known elemental spectra.\n\n    The analysis is based on the visual properties of the provided spectrum image:\n    1.
