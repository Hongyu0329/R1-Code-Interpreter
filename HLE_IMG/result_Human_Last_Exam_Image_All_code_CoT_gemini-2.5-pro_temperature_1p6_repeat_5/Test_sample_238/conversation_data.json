    "Based on the visual information, especially from the cropped images, the small, black-tipped, hair-like structures growing on the surface of the larger shelf fungus are a type of mold. This kind of mold that grows on other fungi is known as a mycoparasite. A common name for this type of mold, due to its appearance, is \"pin mold\".\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print this identification.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef identify_organism():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the organisms in the provided image, focusing on the black one.\n  \"\"\"\n  primary_fungus = \"Bracket fungus (likely a Trametes species)\"\n  secondary_organism_description = \"Tiny, black-tipped, pin-like structures\"\n  secondary_organism_name = \"Pin mold (a type of mycoparasitic fungus)\"\n\n  print(f\"The image contains several organisms.\")\n  print(f\"The large, shelf-like organism is a {primary_fungus}.\")\n  print(f\"The {secondary_organism_description} growing on the larger fungus are a {secondary_organism_name}.\")\n  print(f\"\\nThe black organism in the photo is the: {secondary_organism_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n  identify_organism()\n\n```\n<<<Pin mold>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the name of the black organism in this photo?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
