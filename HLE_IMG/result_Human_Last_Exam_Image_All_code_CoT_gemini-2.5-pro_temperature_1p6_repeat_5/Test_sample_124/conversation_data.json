    "An analysis of the circuit reveals that some resistors are short-circuited due to the wiring configuration. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Short Circuits:**\n    *   **Resistors R1 and R2:** A wire runs from the top of the circuit (positive terminal of V2) directly to the junction between R2 and R3. This wire bypasses the series combination of R1 and R2. Since current follows the path of least resistance, R1 and R2 are effectively removed from the circuit (short-circuited). This places resistor R3 directly across the voltage source.\n    *   **Resistor R8:** Similarly, a wire runs from the top of the circuit directly to the junction between R7 and R8. This wire bypasses R8, effectively short-circuiting it. This places resistor R7 directly across the voltage source.\n\n2.  **Determine the Simplified Circuit:**\n    *   After removing the short-circuited resistors, the circuit simplifies to just resistor R3 and resistor R7 connected in parallel across the 1V voltage source.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Equivalent Resistance (R_eq):**\n    *   The total equivalent resistance for two resistors in parallel is calculated using the formula: `R_eq = (R3 * R7) / (R3 + R7)`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Current (I):**\n    *   Using Ohm's Law (`I = V / R`), the total current flowing from the source is the source voltage divided by the total equivalent resistance (`I = V2 / R_eq`).\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the total current.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_circuit():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided electrical circuit to find the total current.\n\n    The analysis reveals that:\n    1.
