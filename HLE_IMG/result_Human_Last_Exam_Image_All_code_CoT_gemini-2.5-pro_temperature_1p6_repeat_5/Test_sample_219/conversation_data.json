    "My plan is to analyze the provided raster plot to identify the synchronized bursts of neuronal activity and then calculate the average time interval between these bursts.\n\n1.  **Identify Burst Timestamps:** I will visually inspect the graph to find the time points where a large number of electrodes fire simultaneously. These are visible as dense vertical lines of dots. I will estimate the center time for each of these bursts.\n2.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs):** I will compute the time difference between each consecutive pair of burst timestamps identified in the previous step.\n3.  **Calculate the Average IBI:** I will sum all the calculated inter-burst intervals and divide by the total number of intervals to find the average.\n4.  **Format the Output:** The final average will be rounded to two significant figures as requested. The Python code will print all the steps, including the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# 1. Identify the timestamps of the synchronized bursts from the graph.\n# These are the approximate time points (in seconds) where dense vertical firing patterns occur.\nburst_timestamps = [3, 15, 24, 36, 49]\nprint(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\\n\")\n\n# 2. Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBIs).\n# The interval is the time difference between consecutive bursts.\ninter_burst_intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\nprint(f\"Calculated inter-burst intervals (s): {list(inter_burst_intervals)}\\n\")\n\n# 3. Calculate the average inter-burst interval.\naverage_interval = np.mean(inter_burst_intervals)\nsum_of_intervals = np.sum(inter_burst_intervals)\nnum_of_intervals = len(inter_burst_intervals)\n\n# 4. Print the calculation steps and the final result.\n# Create a string representation of the sum for the equation.\ninterval_sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, inter_burst_intervals))\n\nprint(\"Calculation of the average inter-burst interval:\")\n# Print the full equation for calculating the average\nprint(f\"({interval_sum_str}) / {num_of_intervals} = {sum_of_intervals} / {num_of_intervals} = {average_interval} s\\n\")\n\n# Round the average to two significant figures.\n# 11.5 rounds to 12 when rounding to two significant figures.\nrounded_average = float(f\"{average_interval:.2g}\")\nprint(f\"The average inter-burst interval rounded to two significant figures is: {rounded_average} s\")\n```\n<<<12>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts in this graph of firing activity of a neuronal culture and calculate the average inter-burst interval to two significant figures.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
