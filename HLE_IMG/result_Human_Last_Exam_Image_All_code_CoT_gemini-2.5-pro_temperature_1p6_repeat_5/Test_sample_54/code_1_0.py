    # Analysis of the reaction steps
    
    # Step 1: From compound 1 to 2
    # The structure of compound 1 is transformed into compound 2 by replacing an oxygen atom in the core
    # with a >N-NH2 group (an N-amino group). The reagent that provides the H2N-N< moiety is hydrazine.
    reagent_A = "Hydrazine (H2N-NH2)"

    # Step 2: From compound 2 to 3
    # Compound 2, with the >N-NH2 group, is converted into compound 3.
    # Compound 3 is a quinacridinium system containing one >NH group and one >N-propyl group.
    # This complex transformation involves a cyclization and rearrangement. Reagent B must provide the propyl group.
    # Propylamine acts as a nucleophile that participates in the formation of the quinacridinium skeleton
    # and provides the propyl group.
    reagent_B = "Propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)"
