    "My analysis indicates that the animal in the image is an insect, specifically a species of longhorn beetle. Based on its distinct coloration—a black body with a prominent reddish-orange band across the top of its wing cases—and long, banded antennae, it can be identified as the Bloody Longhorn Beetle. I will now provide the Python code to output this information.\n\n```python\ndef identify_animal():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the animal in the image and provides its scientific name.\n    The animal is identified as a Bloody Longhorn Beetle based on its physical characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    is_animal_present = True\n    scientific_name = \"Anastrangalia sanguinolenta\"\n\n    if is_animal_present:\n        print(\"Yes, there is an animal in this image.\")\n        print(f\"The animal's scientific name is: {scientific_name}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No animal was identified in the image.\")\n\nidentify_animal()\n```\n<<<Anastrangalia sanguinolenta>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Is there an animal in this image?
