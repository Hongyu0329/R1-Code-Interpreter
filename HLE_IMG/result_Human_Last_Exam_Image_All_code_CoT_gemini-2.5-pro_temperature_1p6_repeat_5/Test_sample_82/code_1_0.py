# The intramolecular Heck reaction involves several steps.
# 1. Oxidative addition of Pd(0) into the C9-Br bond.
# 2. Migratory insertion: The C9-Pd complex adds across the C4=C5 double bond.
#    The product shows a new bond between C9 and C5, so the Pd atom becomes attached to C4.
# 3. Beta-hydride elimination: A hydrogen from a carbon adjacent to C4 is eliminated
#    along with the Pd catalyst to form a new double bond.
#    The carbons adjacent to C4 are C3 and C5.
#    C5 is now quaternary (bonded to C4, C6, C7, C9) and has no hydrogens.
#    C3 has hydrogens.
#    Therefore, a hydrogen is eliminated from C3, and a new double bond forms between C3 and C4.

carbon_atom_1 = 3
carbon_atom_2 = 4

# Printing the final answer in the requested format.
# Final Equation: A new alkene is formed between C3 and C4.
