The protein S100B binds to the V and C1 domains of the RAGE receptor. It can be used as a prognostic marker because its overexpression directly activates pathways (JNK/JUN and NF-κβ) that lead to apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration, allowing its levels to predict the severity and progression of neurological disorders.
