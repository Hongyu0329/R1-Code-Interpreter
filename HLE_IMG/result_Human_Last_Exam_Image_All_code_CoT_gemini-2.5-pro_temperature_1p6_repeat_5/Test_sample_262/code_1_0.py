    Analyzes the stability of four Iridium complexes to determine which have shorter lifetimes.

    print("Step 1: Analyze the chemical structures of the four complexes.")
    print("All four complexes are cationic Iridium(III) emitters. The key difference is the fluorine substitution pattern on the cyclometalating phenylpyridine ligands.")
    print("  - Complex 1: Fluorine at ortho and para positions (2,4-difluoro).")
    print("  - Complex 2: Fluorine at meta and para positions (3,4-difluoro).")
    print("  - Complex 3: Fluorine at the ortho position (2-fluoro).")
    print("  - Complex 4: Fluorine at ortho and meta positions (2,3-difluoro).")
    print("\nStep 2: Identify the key factors affecting the lifetime (stability) of these complexes.")
    print("  - Factor A (Steric Protection): A substituent at the ortho position of the phenyl ring (next to the Ir-C bond) sterically shields this bond from degradation. This is a dominant factor for increasing lifetime.")
    print("  - Factor B (Electronic Stabilization): Fluorine atoms are electron-withdrawing, which strengthens the Ir-C bond and makes the complex harder to oxidize. More fluorine atoms generally lead to higher stability.")
    print("\nStep 3: Evaluate each complex based on these factors.")
    print("  - Complex 2 is the only complex WITHOUT an ortho-fluorine. It lacks the critical steric protection (Factor A) and is therefore expected to be the least stable and have the shortest lifetime.")
    print("  - Complexes 1, 3, and 4 all possess an ortho-fluorine, giving them significant stability.")
    print("  - Comparing the more stable group, Complexes 1 and 4 each have two fluorine atoms per ligand, while Complex 3 only has one. The additional electronic stabilization (Factor B) in Complexes 1 and 4 makes them more stable than Complex 3.")
    print("\nStep 4: Establish the stability ranking.")
    print("The predicted stability order from most stable (longest lifetime) to least stable (shortest lifetime) is:")
    print("  Complex 1 and 4 (most stable) > Complex 3 > Complex 2 (least stable).")
    print("\nStep 5: Conclude which complexes have shorter lifetimes.")
    print("The complexes with shorter lifetimes are the least stable ones in the series. Based on the ranking, these are Complex 2 and Complex 3.")
    print("\nFinal Answer: The complexes expected to show shorter lifetimes are [2] and [3].")
