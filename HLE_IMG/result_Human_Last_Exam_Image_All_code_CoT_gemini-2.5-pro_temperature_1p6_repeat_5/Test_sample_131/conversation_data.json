    "This is a chemical identification task. The image provided shows the skeletal structure of a molecule. My plan is to analyze the structure, identify its key functional groups and ring systems, and use this information to determine its common name.\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure:** The molecule is polycyclic, containing four fused rings.\n2.  **Identify heteroatoms:** There are two nitrogen (N) atoms integrated into the ring system and one oxygen (O) atom.\n3.  **Identify functional groups:** The nitrogen atoms make this an amine, and because it's a naturally derived compound of this type, it's an alkaloid. The C=O group adjacent to a nitrogen atom in a ring forms a lactam functional group.\n4.  **Identify the parent ring system:** The core structure is characteristic of quinolizidine alkaloids, specifically the lupin alkaloids.\n5.  **Name the compound:** This specific tetracyclic structure with a lactam group is known as **Lupanine**.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that prints this name.\n\n```python\ndef identify_alkaloid():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the chemical compound from the provided image.\n\n    The structure analysis reveals:\n    - A tetracyclic (four-ring) system.\n    - Two nitrogen atoms, making it a diamine.\n    - An oxygen atom as part of a carbonyl group (C=O).\n    - The carbonyl group is adjacent to a nitrogen atom within a ring, forming a lactam.\n    - This specific skeleton is characteristic of lupin alkaloids.\n\n    Based on these features, the compound is identified as Lupanine.\n    \"\"\"\n    compound_name = \"Lupanine\"\n    print(f\"The name of the alkaloid compound is: {compound_name}\")\n\nidentify_alkaloid()\n```\n<<<Lupanine>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Name this alkaloid compound.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
