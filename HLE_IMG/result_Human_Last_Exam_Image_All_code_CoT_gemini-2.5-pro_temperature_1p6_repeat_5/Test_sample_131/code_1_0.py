    This function identifies the chemical compound from the provided image.

    The structure analysis reveals:
    - A tetracyclic (four-ring) system.
    - Two nitrogen atoms, making it a diamine.
    - An oxygen atom as part of a carbonyl group (C=O).
    - The carbonyl group is adjacent to a nitrogen atom within a ring, forming a lactam.
    - This specific skeleton is characteristic of lupin alkaloids.

    Based on these features, the compound is identified as Lupanine.
