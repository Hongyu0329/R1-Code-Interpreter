    "The phenomenon illustrated by the image and the user's description is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion** or **Temporal Induction**.\n\nThis auditory illusion occurs when a sound, such as a tone, is interrupted for a short period and that gap is filled with another sound, typically noise. The listener's brain perceptually restores the missing portion of the original sound, leading to the experience of a continuous, uninterrupted tone. The image provided visualizes this: the top spectrogram and bottom waveform show a pure tone being physically replaced by a burst of noise, yet it is often perceived as continuous.\n\nSeveral factors influence the strength of this illusion. The interrupting noise must be loud enough to effectively mask the gap where the tone is absent. If the gap is silent instead of filled with noise, the illusion does not occur, and the sound is correctly perceived as discontinuous. This effect is not limited to simple tones but can also occur with more complex and time-varying sounds like musical melodies and speech. A well-known example involving speech is the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**, where a missing phoneme in a sentence is replaced by a sound like a cough, yet the word is heard as complete.\n\nThe comparison to the Necker Cube is apt because the auditory continuity illusion can be seen as a form of perceptual bistability, where the listener's perception can alternate between two possible interpretations: a continuous tone obscured by noise, or a tone that stops and is replaced by noise. This demonstrates the brain's active role in interpreting ambiguous sensory information and its tendency to assume continuity based on context, a principle described by Gestalt psychology. The auditory system essentially makes a \"best guess\" that the tone continued behind the interrupting sound.\n\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion"
