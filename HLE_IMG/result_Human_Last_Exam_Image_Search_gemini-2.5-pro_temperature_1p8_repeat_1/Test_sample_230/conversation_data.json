    "**The title of the 19th-century painting is \"Burning Windmill at Stege\".**\n\nThe artwork was painted in 1856 by the Norwegian artist Johan Christian Dahl. A visual comparison of the provided fragment with Dahl's full painting confirms the match. Key details such as the structure of the windmill, the turbulent and expressive sky, and the fire emanating from a nearby building are consistent with Dahl's work.\n\nThe painting depicts a dramatic scene of a windmill and a fire under a dark, cloudy sky. \"Burning Windmill at Stege\" is considered an example of a \"brandje,\" a sub-genre of landscape painting that focuses on fires, a theme that was also popular during the Dutch Golden Age. The artwork is housed in the National Museum in Oslo, Norway.\n\nInitially, another potential artist considered was the Dutch painter Hendrik Gerrit ten Cate, who was known for his cityscapes, often featuring nocturnal scenes and fires. However, a detailed comparison revealed that the style and specific elements in the provided fragment more closely align with Johan Christian Dahl's \"Burning Windmill at Stege\".\n\n<<<Burning Windmill at Stege>>>"
