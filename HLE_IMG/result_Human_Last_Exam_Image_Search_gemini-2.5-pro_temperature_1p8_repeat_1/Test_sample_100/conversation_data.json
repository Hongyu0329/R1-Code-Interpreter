    "To determine the molecular formula of the final product, we will analyze the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is N-(p-methoxybenzyl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. Let's determine its molecular formula by counting the atoms:\n*   **Carbon (C):** There are 6 carbons in the bicyclic core, 1 carbon in the trifluoromethyl (CF₃) group, and 8 carbons in the p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group (1 in -CH₂-, 6 in the benzene ring, and 1 in -OCH₃). This gives a total of 6 + 1 + 8 = 15 carbons.\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** There are 5 hydrogens on the bicyclic core (1 at C1, 1 at C4, 1 at C5, and 2 at C7), and 9 hydrogens on the PMB group (2 in -CH₂-, 4 on the benzene ring, and 3 in -OCH₃). This gives a total of 5 + 9 = 14 hydrogens.\n*   **Fluorine (F):** There are 3 fluorine atoms in the CF₃ group.\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** There is 1 nitrogen atom in the bicyclic lactam ring.\n*   **Oxygen (O):** There is 1 oxygen in the carbonyl group (C=O) of the lactam and 1 oxygen in the methoxy group (-OCH₃) of the PMB protector. This gives a total of 2 oxygens.\n\nThe molecular formula of the starting material is **C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Intermediate 1**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) in acetonitrile/water (ACN/H₂O).\n*   **Reaction:** CAN is a common oxidizing agent used to remove the p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting group from nitrogen atoms. The PMB group is cleaved, and the nitrogen becomes an N-H group.\n*   **Change in Molecular Formula:** We remove the PMB group (C₈H₉O) and add a hydrogen atom to the nitrogen.\n    *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n    *   H: 14 - 9 + 1 = 6\n    *   F: 3 (no change)\n    *   N: 1 (no change)\n    *   O: 2 - 1 = 1 (the oxygen from the methoxy group is removed)\n*   The molecular formula of **Intermediate 1** is **C₇H₆F₃NO**.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Intermediate 2**\n\n*   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) with hydrogen gas (H₂) in methanol (MeOH).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, which reduces the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) in the ring to a single bond (C-C).\n*   **Change in Molecular Formula:** Two hydrogen atoms are added across the double bond.\n    *   C: 7 (no change)\n    *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n    *   F: 3 (no change)\n    *   N: 1 (no change)\n    *   O: 1 (no change)\n*   The molecular formula of **Intermediate 2** is **C₇H₈F₃NO**.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of the Final Product**\n\n*   **Reagents:** 4 N Hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 70 °C.\n*   **Reaction:** These conditions correspond to the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the lactam (a cyclic amide). The amide bond is cleaved by the addition of a water molecule, opening the ring to form a carboxylic acid and an amine.\n*   **Change in Molecular Formula:** One molecule of water (H₂O) is added to the structure.\n    *   C: 7 (no change)\n    *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n    *   F: 3 (no change)\n    *   N: 1 (no change)\n    *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n*   The molecular formula of the final neutral product is **C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂**. This product is an amino acid, specifically a substituted aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the final product is C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂.\n<<<C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂>>>"
