    "The time complexity of this sorting algorithm is determined by its recursive structure.\n\n### Analyzing the Algorithm\n\nLet's break down the provided pseudocode:\n```python\ndef sort(a, n):\n  if n > 1:\n    sort(a, n - 1)              # First recursive call\n    if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n      swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])  # Constant time operation\n    sort(a, n - 1)              # Second recursive call (conditional)\n```\n1.  **Base Case**: The recursion stops when it receives a list of size 1 or less (`n <= 1`).\n2.  **Recursive Step**: For a list of size `n`, the algorithm first makes a recursive call to sort the first `n-1` elements: `sort(a, n - 1)`.\n3.  **Comparison and Swap**: It then compares the last two elements of the now partially sorted `n-1` subarray. If they are in the wrong order, it swaps them.\n4.  **Second Recursive Call**: Crucially, it then calls `sort(a, n - 1)` *again*.\n\n### Worst-Case Scenario\n\nThe worst-case scenario for many sorting algorithms occurs when the input array is sorted in reverse order. In this case, the `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` condition will frequently be true, triggering the second recursive call.\n\n### Recurrence Relation\n\nLet T(n) be the time taken by the algorithm for an input of size `n`. We can express this using a recurrence relation.\n\nIn the worst case, the function performs two recursive calls on a subproblem of size `n-1`, plus a constant amount of work for the comparison and swap. This gives us the following recurrence relation:\n\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c` (where `c` is a constant)\n\n### Solving the Recurrence Relation\n\nWe can solve this by expansion:\n*   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n*   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n-2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c = 2^2 * T(n-2) + 3c`\n*   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n-3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 3c = 2^3 * T(n-3) + 7c`\n\nA pattern emerges: `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + (2^k - 1) * c`\n\nThe recursion stops at the base case, let's say `T(1) = 1`. This occurs when `n-k = 1`, or `k = n-1`. Substituting this back into the equation:\n\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-1) - 1) * c`\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n\nThe dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`. In Big O notation, this is simplified to `O(2^n)`. This type of complexity is known as exponential time. The solution to the recurrence `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + C` is O(2^n).\n\n<<<E>>>"
