    "To determine the biological sexes of the insects in each pair, we must look for key sexually dimorphic traits. The provided context that these are pollinators from taxa without scopae on their legs is a crucial clue.\n\n### Pair A: Cuckoo Bees (*Coelioxys*)\nThese bees are cuckoo bees, which are cleptoparasites, meaning they lay their eggs in the nests of other bees. Consequently, the females do not collect pollen and lack scopae (pollen-collecting hairs).\n\n*   **Individual A (Left):** This bee has long antennae and the tip of its abdomen is armed with multiple spines or teeth. This is characteristic of a male *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Individual A (Right):** This beeâ€™s abdomen tapers to a single, sharp, conical point. This pointed abdomen is a feature of females, used to pierce the nests of their hosts to lay eggs.\n\nTherefore, the pair is **Male, Female (3)**.\n\n### Pair B: Paper Wasps (*Polistes*)\nThese are paper wasps. Wasps do not have scopae as they typically do not provision their nests with pollen. Several features distinguish males and females.\n\n*   **Individual B (Left):** This wasp has relatively short and straight antennae. The abdomen tapers to a point, which houses the stinger, a feature exclusive to females.\n*   **Individual B (Right):** This wasp displays antennae that are noticeably longer and curled at the tips, a classic feature of male paper wasps. Male wasps also lack a stinger.\n\nTherefore, the pair is **Female, Male (4)**.\n\n### Pair C: Long-horned and Leafcutter Bees\nThis pair illustrates two different types of bees that fit the \"no leg scopae\" description in different ways.\n\n*   **Individual C (Left):** This is a male long-horned bee, likely from the genus *Melissodes*. The most prominent features are the extremely long antennae, which give the group its name, and the pale marking on its face (clypeus). Male bees do not collect pollen and therefore lack scopae.\n*   **Individual C (Right):** This is a female leafcutter bee from the family Megachilidae. A key characteristic of this family is that females carry pollen on a dense brush of hairs on the underside of their abdomen (the ventral scopa), rather than on their legs. The bright yellow pollen visible on the abdomen confirms it is a female actively foraging. Her antennae are also much shorter than the male's on the left.\n\nTherefore, the pair is **Male, Female (3)**.\n\n<<<3, 4, 3>>>"
