    "Based on the provided image, the lesion corresponds to the G.V. Black Class I classification.\n\nThe image displays a molar tooth with a lesion on its occlusal (chewing) surface. According to the widely used G.V. Black classification system, Class I caries are defined as those occurring in the pits and fissures of the occlusal surfaces of posterior teeth (molars and premolars).\n\nThe image also shows an existing restoration (filling), with decay appearing around its margins. This is known as secondary or recurrent caries. Regardless of it being a primary or secondary lesion, its location on the occlusal surface places it within the Class I category.\n\n<<<G.V. Black Class I>>>"
