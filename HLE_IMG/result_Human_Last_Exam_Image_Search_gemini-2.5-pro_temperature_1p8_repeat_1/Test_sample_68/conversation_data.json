    "This coin is a 9 Deniers piece minted for the French American colonies.\n\nThe coin was struck under the authority of King Louis XV, as indicated by the crowned double \"L\" monogram on the obverse. The reverse explicitly states \"COLONIES FRANÃ‡OISES\" and dates from either 1721 or 1722.\n\nThis particular issue, a copper coin also referred to as a \"Sou,\" was intended for circulation in all of France's colonies in the New World. This included New France (which encompassed areas of modern-day Canada), the French West Indies, and Louisiana.\n\nInitially, many of these coins were sent to Canada but were not well-received by the colonists. Subsequently, a large quantity of these coins was redirected to the colony of Louisiana, where they saw more successful circulation. For this reason, these coins are often specifically referred to as \"Louisiana Coppers\".\n\nThe coins were produced at the mints in La Rochelle (with the mint mark \"H\") and Rouen (mint mark \"B\"). The inscription on the obverse, \"SIT NOMEN DOMINI BENEDICTUM,\" translates to \"Blessed be the name of the Lord.\"\n\n<<<French American Colonies (specifically associated with Louisiana)>>>"
