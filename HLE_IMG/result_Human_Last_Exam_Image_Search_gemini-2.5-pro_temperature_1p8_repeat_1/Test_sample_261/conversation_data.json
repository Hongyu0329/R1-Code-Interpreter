    "The image fragment is from the cover of the book *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*.\n\nThis particular illustration was created by Mary GrandPré for the original U.S. edition of the book. The cover art depicts several elements from the story, and the fragment shown is of a unicorn running near what appears to be the Forbidden Forest. The complete cover features Harry Potter on his broomstick, reaching for the Golden Snitch, with Hogwarts castle in the background. GrandPré was the illustrator for the covers and interior chapters of all seven *Harry Potter* books in the U.S.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
