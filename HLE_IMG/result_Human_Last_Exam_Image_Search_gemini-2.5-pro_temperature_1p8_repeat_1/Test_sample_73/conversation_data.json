    "Based on the principles of organic chemistry, the stereochemical assignments for the four stereocenters in the reaction from left to right are determined as (R), (S), (S), and (R).\n\nHere is the step-by-step determination:\n\n1.  **First Stereocenter (Acyl Chloride Reactant):** This chiral center is part of a molecule known as Mosher's acid chloride. According to its IUPAC name, (2R)-3,3,3-trifluoro-2-methoxy-2-phenylpropanoyl chloride, the configuration is (R). To determine this using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) rules, we assign priorities to the groups attached to the stereocenter:\n    *   **Priority 1:** -OMe (methoxy group, highest atomic number of attached atom).\n    *   **Priority 2:** -COCl (carbonyl chloride group).\n    *   **Priority 3:** -CF₃ (trifluoromethyl group).\n    *   **Priority 4:** -Ph (phenyl group).\n    With the methoxy group (priority 1) pointing away from the viewer (dashed bond) and the trifluoromethyl group (priority 3) pointing towards the viewer (wedged bond), we can determine the configuration. By swapping the lowest priority group (-Ph) with the group pointing away (-OMe), the path from the new priority 1 to 2 to 3 is counter-clockwise, indicating an (S) configuration. Because we performed a swap, the original configuration is the opposite, which is **(R)**.\n\n2.  **Second Stereocenter (Alcohol Reactant):** For the alcohol, we assign priorities to the groups on its chiral carbon:\n    *   **Priority 1:** -OH (hydroxyl group).\n    *   **Priority 2:** -CH₂OMe (methoxymethyl group).\n    *   **Priority 3:** -CH₂CH(Me)₂ (isobutyl group).\n    *   **Priority 4:** -H (hydrogen, implied).\n    The -OH group (priority 1) is shown pointing towards the viewer, meaning the hydrogen (priority 4) points away. Tracing the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3 reveals a counter-clockwise direction. Since the lowest priority group is in the back, this corresponds to an **(S)** configuration.\n\n3.  **Third and Fourth Stereocenters (Product):** The reaction is an esterification, where an alcohol reacts with an acyl chloride to form an ester. This type of reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution that does not break any of the bonds to the chiral centers of the reactants. Therefore, the stereochemistry of both centers is retained in the product.\n    *   **Third Stereocenter (left, from the alcohol):** Since it originated from the (S) alcohol and the reaction does not affect this center, its configuration remains **(S)**.\n    *   **Fourth Stereocenter (right, from the acyl chloride):** Similarly, this center came from the (R) acyl chloride, so its configuration is retained as **(R)**.\n\nThe final sequence of stereochemical assignments from left to right across the reaction scheme is (R), (S), (S), (R).\n\n>>><(R), (S), (S), (R)>>>"
