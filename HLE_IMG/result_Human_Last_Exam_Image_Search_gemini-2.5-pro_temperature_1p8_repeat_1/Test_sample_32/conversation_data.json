    "The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that allows for distinction at a glance is the **seta**, which is the stalk that supports the capsule.\n\nIn ***Grimmia montana***, the sporophyte has a **straight seta**. This means the capsule is held up on a straight stalk.\n\nIn contrast, ***Grimmia curviseta*** is characterized by an **arcuate seta**, which means it is curved or bent like a bow. The species name itself, *curviseta*, alludes to this curved stalk. While capsules can be rare, when present, this feature is a key diagnostic tool.\n\n<<<The most prominent distinguishing feature of the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* is that *Grimmia montana* possesses a straight seta, whereas *Grimmia curviseta* has a curved (arcuate) seta.>>>"
