    "Based on the provided reaction scheme, the reagents A and B are as follows:\n\n**Reagent A: Hydrazine (NH₂NH₂) **\n\nThe transformation from compound **1** to compound **2** involves the replacement of a ring oxygen atom in a pyrylium-like ether linkage with an N-NH₂ group. This is a characteristic reaction of pyrylium salts (or their derivatives, as shown in structure **1**) with hydrazine. The hydrazine acts as a nitrogen nucleophile, leading to a ring-opening and subsequent ring-closing sequence to form the N-aminopyridinium derivative **2**.\n\n**Reagent B: Butyraldehyde (CH₃CH₂CH₂CHO)**\n\nThe reaction from compound **2** to compound **3** is a more complex transformation that results in an N-propyl substituted quinacridinium salt. This type of reaction, a condensation followed by cyclization and rearrangement, is known to occur between N-amino heterocycles and aldehydes. To obtain the N-propyl (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) group seen in product **3**, the required aldehyde is butyraldehyde (also known as butanal). In this reaction, the N-amino group of **2** condenses with butyraldehyde, initiating a cascade that leads to the formation of the new heterocyclic ring and the incorporation of the propyl group onto the nitrogen atom.\n\n<<<**Reagent A**: Hydrazine, **Reagent B**: Butyraldehyde>>>"
