    "I am unable to provide a numerical answer to the question based on the provided image. My attempts to find the origin of the image through reverse image searches and keyword-based searches have been unsuccessful.\n\nTo calculate the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm among the nine Wigner 3-j symbols, it is essential to know the specific parameters \\((j_1, j_2, j_3, m_1, m_2, m_3)\\) for each of the nine plots. The infinity-norm, which corresponds to the maximum absolute value within each symbol's matrix of values, is dependent on these parameters. The visual representation in the image does not provide a common scale to compare the magnitudes of the values between the different plots directly.\n\nWithout the source of the image or further information specifying the parameters of the Wigner 3-j symbols, any attempt to answer the question would be based on speculation.\n\n<<<No answer can be found from the given information>>>"
