    "This protein is the **human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-25K (UBE2K)**, also known as Huntingtin-interacting protein 2 (HIP-2). The image shows the crystal structure of this enzyme in complex with ubiquitin.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what you see in the image:\n*   **Dark Blue Domain**: This is the main body of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-25K. Like other E2 enzymes, it has a highly conserved core domain of about 150 amino acids that contains the active site.\n*   **Light Blue Domain**: This represents the ubiquitin molecule that is bound to the enzyme. The interaction between E2-25K and ubiquitin is crucial for the synthesis of polyubiquitin chains.\n*   **Yellow Stick**: This highlights a specific and important amino acid residue at the active site, Cysteine-92 (Cys-92). This cysteine forms a temporary bond with ubiquitin before transferring it to a target protein.\n\nE2-25K is a unique enzyme because it can create specific types of ubiquitin chains (K48-linked) on its own, without the need for an E3 ligase enzyme, which is typically required. It is also significant in the study of neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington's disease and Alzheimer's disease. The original image can be traced back to the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the entry ID 1YH6, which has since been superseded by entry 2Z5D.\n\n<<<human ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-25K (UBE2K)>>>"
