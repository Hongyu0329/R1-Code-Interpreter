    "The term \"X Y\" refers to a **Silver Mirror**. This answer is based on a dual interpretation of the clues provided.\n\nThe first clue, \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019,\" refers to the physical object in the image. The man in the picture is receiving a trophy that is highly reflective and has the appearance of a **silver mirror**.\n\nThe second clue, \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts,\" refers to a historical industrial process. For centuries, from the 16th to the early 20th, mirrors were manufactured using a tin-mercury amalgam. This method involved applying liquid mercury to tin foil on a glass plate, creating the reflective surface. This process was extremely hazardous due to the high toxicity of mercury and its vapors, leading to severe health problems and a short life expectancy for mirror-makers.\n\nThis toxic mercury-based method has been almost entirely replaced by a modern technique invented by German chemist Justus von Liebig in 1835. The modern process, often called the \"silver mirror reaction,\" uses a chemical reduction of silver nitrate (often with a sugar in a solution known as Tollens' reagent) to deposit a thin, uniform layer of metallic silver onto a glass surface, creating a clear and highly reflective mirror without the use of toxic mercury.\n\nTherefore, \"Silver Mirror\" fits both clues: it is descriptive of the trophy pictured at the event, and it is the common name for an item whose earlier manufacturing process involving mercury salts has been abandoned due to toxicity.\n\n<<<Silver Mirror>>>"
