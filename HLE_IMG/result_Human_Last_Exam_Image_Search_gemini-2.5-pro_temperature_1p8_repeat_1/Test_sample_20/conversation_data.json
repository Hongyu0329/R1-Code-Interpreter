    "This image was taken in the Netherlands.\n\nThe architectural style of the buildings, particularly the one with the stepped gable, is characteristically Dutch. The presence of a canal flowing through the city, cobblestone paths, and numerous bicycles are all strong indicators of a Dutch city.\n\nSpecifically, the scene is of the Vismarkt (Fish Market) in Leiden. The prominent building with the red-and-white detailed gabled roof is a historic landmark, and the white, colonnaded structure is a covered gallery where fish was once sold. This area is a well-known market square in Leiden that hosts markets on Wednesdays and Saturdays.<<<The Netherlands>>>"
