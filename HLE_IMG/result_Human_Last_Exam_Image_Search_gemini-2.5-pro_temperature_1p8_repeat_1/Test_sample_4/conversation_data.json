    "The Jones polynomial, denoted as $p(t)$, for the given knot, which is identified as the 9_42 knot, has been determined through knot theory resources. The polynomial is notable for being identical to that of its mirror image.\n\nThe Jones polynomial for the 9_42 knot is:\n$p(t) = t^3 - t^2 + t - 1 + t^{-1} - t^{-2} + t^{-3}$\n\nThis polynomial is presented in decreasing degree order as requested.\n\n<<<$t^3 - t^2 + t - 1 + t^{-1} - t^{-2} + t^{-3}$>>>"
