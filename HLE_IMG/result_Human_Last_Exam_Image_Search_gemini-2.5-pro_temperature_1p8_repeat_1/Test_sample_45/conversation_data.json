    "The tiling shown in the image is an example of a quasicrystalline tiling, which is an ordered but non-periodic pattern. This specific arrangement of shapes is characteristic of patterns found in Islamic architecture known as Girih tiles and is also mathematically described by Penrose tilings.\n\nThe pattern is constructed from several types of polygons, most prominently regular decagons (ten-sided polygons) and regular pentagons (five-sided polygons), which fit together without gaps.\n\nThe rotational symmetry of a tiling refers to the property that it looks the same after being rotated by a certain angle around a central point.\n*   Individual pentagons have 5-fold rotational symmetry (they look the same after a rotation of 72°).\n*   Individual decagons have 10-fold rotational symmetry (they look the same after a rotation of 36°).\n\nIn the overall tiling, there are points of local 5-fold symmetry, particularly at the center of the star-shaped clusters of pentagons. However, the presence of large, perfectly formed decagons and the way the entire pattern is structured around them gives the overall tiling **10-fold rotational symmetry**. Any pattern that has 10-fold symmetry will also have 5-fold symmetry, as a rotation of 72 degrees is simply two 36-degree rotations.\n\nTherefore, the most complete description of the rotational symmetry for the tiling shown is 10-fold. These types of patterns are remarkable because, according to the crystallographic restriction theorem, it is impossible for a periodic, repeating crystal to have 10-fold symmetry.\n\n<<<10-fold>>>"
