    "The reaction shown is the acid-catalyzed \"backbone rearrangement\" of a friedelane-type triterpene (the reactant) to an oleanane-type triterpene (the product). This is a well-documented chemical transformation in organic chemistry, particularly in the study of natural products. The rearrangement proceeds through a series of concerted or stepwise-hydride (H⁻) and-methyl (CH₃⁻) shifts.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the substituent changes at the numbered positions, following the established mechanism for the friedelane to oleanane rearrangement:\n\n1.  **Initiation:** The reaction begins with the protonation of the hydroxyl (-OH) group at C-3 by the acid catalyst (HCl), forming a good leaving group (-OH₂⁺). This group departs as water (H₂O), leaving behind a carbocation at C-3.\n2.  **Carbocation Cascade:** This initial carbocation triggers a cascade of shifts, moving the positive charge across the carbon skeleton. The key migrations that affect the numbered positions are:\n    *   The methyl group (CH₃) on C-9 shifts to C-10.\n    *   The hydrogen atom (H) on C-8 shifts to C-9.\n    *   The methyl group (CH₃) on C-14 shifts to C-8.\n    *   The hydrogen atom (H) that was originally on C-10 moves to C-5 in a preceding step.\n\nBy tracing the fate of the original substituents based on these shifts, we can determine what is at each numbered position in the final product:\n\n*   **Position 1:** This methyl group is located at C-4 of the skeleton. The backbone rearrangement cascade, which primarily involves rings C, D, and E, does not alter the substituents at C-4. Therefore, position 1 remains a methyl group.\n*   **Position 2:** This is at position C-10. It originally holds a methyl group and a hydrogen. The methyl group that was on C-9 migrates here. Therefore, position 2 in the product is a **methyl group (CH₃)**.\n*   **Position 3:** This is at position C-5. The hydrogen atom that was on C-10 moves to this position. Therefore, position 3 in the product is a **hydrogen atom (H)**.\n*   **Position 4:** This is at position C-9. The hydrogen atom that was on C-8 migrates to this position. Therefore, position 4 in the product is a **hydrogen atom (H)**.\n*   **Position 5:** This is at position C-8. The methyl group that was on C-14 moves to this position. Therefore, position 5 in the product is a **methyl group (CH₃)**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the final substitution pattern is:\n\n1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = H, 5 = CH3\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = H, 5 = CH3>>>"
