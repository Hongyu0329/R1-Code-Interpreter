    "The knot in the picture is known as the 8₁₉ knot.\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant, denoted as s(K) for a knot K, is an integer value derived from a branch of mathematics called Khovanov homology. It provides important information about the knot, including a lower bound for its smooth 4-genus.\n\nFor the specific knot 8₁₉, the Rasmussen s-invariant is -6.\n\n<<<−6>>>"
