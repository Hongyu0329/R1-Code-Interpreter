    "The correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Path√©tique\" Sonata is **V7**.\n\nThe sonata is in the key of C minor. Measure 30 contains the notes G, B-natural, D, and F, which form a G dominant seventh chord (G7). In the key of C minor, the G major chord is the dominant, represented by the Roman numeral V. The addition of the seventh (F) makes it a dominant seventh chord, or V7. This chord resolves to the tonic chord (C minor) in the following measure, creating a perfect cadence.\n\nInterestingly, one analysis points out the use of an augmented 6th chord in this measure, which is another valid interpretation of the harmony present. However, the more common and foundational analysis identifies it as a V7 chord, which clearly defines its function of leading to the tonic.\n\n<<<V7>>>"
