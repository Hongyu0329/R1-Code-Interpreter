    "Based on the visual characteristics of the four rock specimens labeled H, I, J, and K, here are their identifications:\n\n**H: Scoria**\nThis specimen is reddish-brown and highly vesicular, meaning it is full of bubble-like cavities. These features are characteristic of scoria, a type of volcanic rock that forms when gas-rich lava erupts and cools quickly. The reddish color is often due to the oxidation of iron. Scoria has thicker vesicle walls compared to pumice, which makes it denser.\n\n**I: Volcanic Breccia or Tuff**\nThis rock is composed of various angular fragments of different sizes cemented together in a light-colored, fine-grained matrix. This texture is known as pyroclastic. Such rocks, formed from the explosive eruption of a volcano that blasts rock, ash, and other materials, are known as tuff or volcanic breccia. Tuff is made of consolidated volcanic ash and can contain larger fragments, while volcanic breccia is composed predominantly of angular volcanic fragments larger than 2 mm.\n\n**J: Pumice**\nThis specimen is light-colored and has a frothy, porous appearance due to a high concentration of very fine vesicles. This texture results from gas-rich, highly pressurized lava being violently ejected from a volcano and cooling rapidly. Pumice is typically light-colored (white to light-gray) and has a very low density, often allowing it to float on water.\n\n**K: Pegmatite**\nThis rock displays a coarse-grained crystalline texture, with large, interlocking mineral crystals that are easily visible. This phaneritic texture is indicative of an intrusive igneous rock that cooled slowly deep within the Earth's crust. The very large size of the crystals, typically greater than 1 cm, identifies it as a pegmatite. Pegmatites often have a composition similar to granite, consisting mainly of quartz, feldspar, and mica.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Volcanic Breccia/Tuff, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
