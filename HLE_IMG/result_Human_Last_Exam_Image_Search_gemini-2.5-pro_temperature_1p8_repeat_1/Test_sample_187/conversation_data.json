    "The reaction shown involves a münchnone, which is a mesoionic heterocyclic compound, reacting with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) at 100 °C to form a substituted pyrrole. This transformation proceeds through a sequence of two pericyclic reactions.\n\nThe two types of pericyclic reactions involved are:\n*   **1,3-Dipolar Cycloaddition**: The first step is a [3+2] cycloaddition reaction. The münchnone acts as a 1,3-dipole (specifically, an azomethine ylide type), which reacts with the alkyne (DMAD), a dipolarophile. This concerted reaction forms an unstable bicyclic intermediate.\n*   **Cheletropic Extrusion (Retro-[4+2] Cycloaddition)**: The bicyclic adduct formed in the initial step undergoes a subsequent pericyclic reaction to eliminate a small, stable molecule. This specific type of cycloreversion is a cheletropic extrusion, where two sigma bonds to a single atom are broken.\n\nThe stoichiometric byproduct of this reaction sequence is **carbon dioxide (CO₂)**. After the initial cycloaddition, the bicyclic intermediate readily loses the C=O group and the oxygen atom from the original münchnone ring as CO₂ to form the stable, aromatic pyrrole product.\n\n<<<The two pericyclic reactions are 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and cheletropic extrusion. The stoichiometric byproduct is carbon dioxide (CO₂).>>>"
