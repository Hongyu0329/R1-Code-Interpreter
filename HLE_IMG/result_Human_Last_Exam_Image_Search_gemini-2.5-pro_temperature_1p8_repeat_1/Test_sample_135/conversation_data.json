The work, a glazed terracotta piece measuring 270 x 240 cm, was made in 1512 and is housed in the Church of Santi Apostoli in Florence.\n\nAndrea della Robbia was the nephew of Luca della Robbia, an influential Italian Renaissance sculptor who invented and perfected the technique of tin-glazed terracotta statuary. After Luca, Andrea took over the large and successful family workshop in 1470, which produced numerous altars, reliefs, and other decorative pieces known for their brilliant and luminous glazes.<<<Andrea della Robbia>>>"
