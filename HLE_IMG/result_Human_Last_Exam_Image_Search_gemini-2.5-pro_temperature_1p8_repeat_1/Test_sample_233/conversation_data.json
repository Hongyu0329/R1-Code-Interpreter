    "The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image fragment is identified as **Sö 281**.\n\nThis specific runestone is one of the 26 known Ingvar runestones, which were erected to commemorate those who died in a Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled. The expedition took place between 1036 and 1041.\n\nThe image shows a detail of the runic inscription on Sö 281. The visible grid-like pattern and the style of the runes are characteristic of this monument. One of the clearest words on the stone is a dative form of the name Ingvar (`ikuari`). These particular runes are noted in scholarly works and online resources about the Ingvar runestones. There are roughly 26 runestones that refer to Swedish warriors who joined Ingvar on his expedition to the Saracen lands (Serkland).\n\nThe content of the inscriptions and the particular style of this stone have been a subject of interest for runologists and historians studying the Viking Age. <<<Sö 281>>>"
