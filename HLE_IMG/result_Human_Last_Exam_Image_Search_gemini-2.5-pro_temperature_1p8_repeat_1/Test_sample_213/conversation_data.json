    "The provided sheet music is the opening of the second act of the opera **Wozzeck** by the Austrian composer **Alban Berg**.\n\nThis identification is based on several key features present in the score:\n\n*   **Musical Style:** The music is atonal, employing a whole-tone scale in the first violin part, a characteristic feature of early 20th-century music and specifically of Alban Berg's compositions.\n*   **Instrumentation and Markings:** The orchestration and the German-language markings such as \"2 gr. Fl.\" (2 Grosse Flöten / 2 large flutes), \"engl. Horn\" (English Horn), \"(Vorhang)\" (Curtain), and \"(mit Dämpfer)\" (with mute) are all consistent with the published scores of *Wozzeck*.\n*   **Structural Context:** The music corresponds to the beginning of Act II, Scene 1 of the opera. This scene takes place in Marie's room, and the musical structure for this scene is a sonata-allegro movement.\n\nComposed between 1914 and 1922, *Wozzeck* is considered a masterpiece of operatic expressionism and is based on the incomplete play *Woyzeck* by Georg Büchner.\n\n<<<Wozzeck>>>"
