    "Here is the step-by-step solution for the checkmate in two moves:\n\n**The Position:**\n\n*   **White:** Queen on a4, Knight on b7, Knight on e7, Pawn on b4, Rook on f3, Rook on h5, King on h4, Bishop on g1, Bishop on g2.\n*   **Black:** Rook on c6, Queen on d5, Pawn on e5, Pawn on f4, King on e4.\n\nIt is White's turn to move.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\nThe Black king on e4 is heavily restricted and has no legal moves. White must find a sequence of two moves that leads to an unavoidable checkmate. The key is to find a quiet first move that places Black in *zugzwang* (a situation where any move weakens their position), leading to a checkmate on the second move.\n\n---\n\n### **The Solution:**\n\n**Move 1: Rff4**\n\nWhite moves the rook from f3 to f4. This is a \"quiet\" move that does not deliver an immediate check. Instead, it critically adjusts White's position and puts all the pressure on Black, who must now make a move. This move defends the d4 square from the King and prepares for the final blow.\n\nBlack has no way to stop the coming mate. Any legal move by Black (moving the queen or the rook, as the king and pawns are immobile) will be met with the same devastating response.\n\n**Move 2: Ng6#**\n\nWhite moves the knight from e7 to g6. This move results in a **double check** and checkmate.\n\n*   **Check 1:** The knight on g6 directly checks the king on e4.\n*   **Check 2:** By moving, the knight reveals a discovered check from the bishop on g2, which now also attacks the king.\n\nA double check is impossible to block or capture both checking pieces at once; the king must move. However, all of the king's potential escape squares are controlled:\n*   **e3** is controlled by the Bishop on g1.\n*   **d3** is controlled by the Rook on f4.\n*   **d4** is controlled by the Queen on a4.\n*   **d5** is controlled by the Knight on b7.\n*   **f3** is controlled by the Bishop on g2.\n*   **f5** is controlled by the Rook on h5.\n*   The squares **e5** and **f4** are blocked by Black's own pawns.\n\nThe black king has no escape and is therefore checkmated.\n\n<<<1. Rff4, 2. Ng6#>>>"
