    "This musical excerpt is from the third movement of Frédéric Chopin's Piano Sonata No. 2 in B-flat minor, Op. 35. This movement is famously known as the \"Marche funèbre,\" or Funeral March.\n\nComposed primarily in 1839, the sonata is one of the most renowned works in the classical piano literature. The Funeral March itself was actually written two years earlier, in 1837. The movement is iconic and has become an archetypal representation of death, often performed at funerals worldwide, including at Chopin's own burial.\n\nWhile the sonata as a whole is in B-flat minor, this third movement begins in the parallel key of B-flat minor, although the excerpt provided is transposed to C-minor. This is a common practice in many sheet music editions and arrangements to simplify the key signature for students or for specific publications. The solemn, dirge-like opening melody, followed by a powerful and dramatic middle section, is characteristic of the piece.\n\n<<<Frédéric Chopin - Piano Sonata No. 2, 3rd Movement (\"Funeral March\")>>>"
