    "Based on a thorough analysis of the provided chess position, there is a contradiction in the user's request.\n\n### Analysis of the Board\n*   **White's Pieces:** King on h1, Bishop on c1, Pawns on h2, g3, and e5.\n*   **Black's Pieces:** King on g8, Rook on f8, Bishop on h3, Knight on f1, Queen on b1, Queen on a2, and Pawns on h7, g7, g6, b6, d4, and c2.\n\n### The Problem\nThe user states that it is \"Black to move\" and asks for a mate-in-2 sequence. However, the White King on h1 is currently in a **double check** from two black pieces simultaneously:\n1.  The Black Knight on f1.\n2.  The Black Queen on b1.\n\nWhen a king is in double check, the only legal move is to move the king. Let's examine the White King's escape squares:\n*   **g1:** Attacked by the Black Queen on b1.\n*   **g2:** Attacked by the Black Bishop on h3.\n*   **h2:** Blocked by its own pawn.\n\nSince the White King is in check and has no legal moves, the position on the board is already **checkmate**. Therefore, it is not possible for it to be Black's turn to move, nor is it possible to find a \"mate in 2.\"\n\nIt appears the puzzle is presented with a flawed or impossible premise according to the standard rules of chess.\n\n<<<The position as presented is already checkmate.>>>"
