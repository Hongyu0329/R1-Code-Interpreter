    "The piano piece that starts with the notes shown in the image is Ludwig van Beethoven's Bagatelle No. 25 in A minor, more commonly known as \"Für Elise.\"\n\nThis piece, however, was not assigned an opus number. Works published after a composer's death and without an opus number are often designated \"WoO,\" which stands for \"Werk ohne Opuszahl\" (work without opus number). \"Für Elise\" is catalogued as WoO 59.\n\nSince \"Für Elise\" does not have an opus number and none of the choices align with its WoO designation, the question is likely flawed, mistakenly combining an image of one piece with opus numbers corresponding to other famous works.\n\nIf we examine the choices, several refer to well-known piano compositions by Sergei Rachmaninoff:\n*   **Opus 3:** *Morceaux de fantaisie*, which includes the famous Prelude in C-sharp minor.\n*   **Opus 23:** Ten Preludes, featuring the very famous Prelude in G minor (No. 5).\n*   **Opus 39:** The *Études-Tableaux*.\n\nGiven these options, the question may have intended to ask about a famous Rachmaninoff prelude. The Prelude in G minor, Op. 23, No. 5, is one of the most recognizable and celebrated pieces in the entire piano repertoire. Assuming the image is an error and the question refers to a well-known piece from the given opus numbers, this is a strong possibility.\n\n<<<D>>>"
