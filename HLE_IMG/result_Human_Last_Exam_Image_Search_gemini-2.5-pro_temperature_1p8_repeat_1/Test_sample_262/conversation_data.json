    "An evaluation of the structures and the principles governing the stability of light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) is required to answer this question.\n\n### Analysis of the Molecular Structures\n\nAll four compounds are cationic iridium(III) complexes with a 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (dtbbpy) ligand and a hexafluorophosphate (PF₆⁻) counter-ion. The key difference between them lies in the two cyclometalating (C^N) ligands, specifically the number and position of fluorine substituents. Fluorine atoms are strong electron-withdrawing groups and the C-F bond is significantly stronger than the C-H bond.\n\nA careful examination of the drawings for each complex reveals the number of fluorine atoms on the C^N ligands:\n*   **Complex 1:** The two C^N ligands appear to be identical, and each is a 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (dfppy). This gives a total of **four fluorine atoms** per complex on the C^N ligands.\n*   **Complex 2:** The two C^N ligands are 2-phenylpyridine (ppy), which have no fluorine substituents. The total is **zero fluorine atoms**.\n*   **Complex 3:** The drawing appears to be heteroleptic, with one 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligand (no fluorine) and one 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine (dfppy) ligand (two fluorines). This gives a total of **two fluorine atoms** per complex.\n*   **Complex 4:** The two C^N ligands are identical, each being a 5-fluoro-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine. Each ligand has three fluorine atoms, giving a total of **six fluorine atoms** per complex.\n\n### Effect of Fluorination on LEC Lifetime\n\nIn organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), fluorination of the cyclometalating ligands is a common strategy to increase the stability and tune the emission color of the iridium complex. The strong C-F bonds are less susceptible to chemical attack than C-H bonds, and the electron-withdrawing nature of fluorine can make the complex more resistant to oxidative degradation.\n\nHowever, the operational environment of a light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) is chemically harsher than that of an OLED, involving mobile ions and intense internal electric fields. Studies have shown that for cationic iridium complexes in LECs, the expected stabilization from fluorination does not always hold true. In fact, an inverse correlation between the fluorine content and the device lifetime is often observed. It is proposed that the highly electron-deficient fluorinated phenyl rings become susceptible to degradation pathways such as nucleophilic attack, which are more pronounced in the ion-rich LEC environment. One key study demonstrated that increasing the number of fluorine substituents on the emitter leads to a shorter device lifetime.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on this evidence, the stability and lifetime of the four complexes in an LEC device are expected to decrease as the number of fluorine atoms increases. We can rank the complexes by their fluorine content:\n\n1.  **Complex 2** (0 fluorine atoms)\n2.  **Complex 3** (2 fluorine atoms)\n3.  **Complex 1** (4 fluorine atoms)\n4.  **Complex 4** (6 fluorine atoms)\n\nTherefore, the expected order of lifetime from longest to shortest is: ** > > >**.\n\nThe question asks which complexes are expected to show **shorter** lifetimes. The two complexes with the most fluorine atoms, **Complex 1** and **Complex 4**, are consequently expected to be the least stable and exhibit the shortest operational lifetimes.\n\n<<<G>>>"
