    "The molecule depicted is **cyclocarbon**.\n\nThis molecule is an allotrope of carbon, meaning it is a substance made up only of carbon atoms. Its chemical formula is C₁₈. The structure consists of a ring of 18 carbon atoms that are connected by alternating single and triple bonds. This arrangement classifies it as a cyclocarbon and a polyyne.\n\nCyclocarbon is notable for being the first cyclocarbon to be synthesized and characterized, a feat accomplished in 2019 by researchers at the University of Oxford and IBM Research. The synthesis involved starting with a larger precursor molecule, C₂₄O₆, and using atomic manipulation at very low temperatures (5 Kelvin) to remove carbon monoxide groups.\n\nDue to its high reactivity, it had been a long-sought-after molecule that scientists had been attempting to create for decades. Its successful synthesis and characterization confirmed its polyynic structure with alternating single and triple bonds, rather than a structure with consecutive double bonds. This structure gives the molecule semiconducting properties. The stability of cyclocarbon is attributed to its double aromaticity.\n\n<<<cyclocarbon>>>"
