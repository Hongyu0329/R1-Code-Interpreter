    "### Ancient Structure Identified as Part of Historic El Polvo Settlement\n\nThe square ancient structure visible at the coordinates 29° 06' 18.75''N and 103° 47' 50.28''W is located within the historic settlement of El Polvo, near the present-day community of Redford in Presidio County, Texas. This archeological site is a registered historic landmark.\n\nThe location is part of a historically significant area known as La Junta de los Ríos, the confluence of the Rio Grande and the Río Conchos. The El Polvo site (41PS21) encompasses the remains of the Native American Tapacolmes pueblo, a Spanish colonial mission, and a later Mexican-American settlement that was established in the 1870s. The name El Polvo is Spanish for \"the dust.\"\n\nWhile the specific identity of the faint square outline is not definitively named in search results, it is likely the ruins of a significant structure within the settlement, such as an adobe cavalry fort and customs station mentioned in historical accounts of the area.\n\n**A Designated Historic Landmark**\n\nThe Polvo site is recognized for its deep historical and prehistoric significance. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 25, 1976, and was designated a Texas State Archeological Landmark on November 7, 1983. The area contains numerous old buildings and ruins, drawing interest from historians, archeologists, and descendants of the original settlers. There are multiple historical markers in Presidio County commemorating its rich history, including several forts and missions.\n\n<<<The square structure is part of the El Polvo archaeological site, a registered historic landmark in Presidio County, Texas.>>>"
