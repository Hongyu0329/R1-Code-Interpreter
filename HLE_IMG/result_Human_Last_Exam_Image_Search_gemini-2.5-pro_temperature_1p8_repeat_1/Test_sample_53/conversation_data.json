    "The figure leaving the chariot is Iphigenia.\n\nThe scene depicted on this Apulian red-figured pelike, dated to approximately 360â€“350 B.C., illustrates a dramatic moment from Greek mythology, specifically a scene from Euripides' play *Iphigenia in Tauris*.\n\nIn the play, Iphigenia has been saved from sacrifice at Aulis by the goddess Artemis and made a priestess at her temple in Tauris. Her brother, Orestes, arrives in Tauris with his friend Pylades. After they recognize each other, they plot to escape from the local king, Thoas, taking with them a sacred statue of Artemis.\n\nThe vase painting captures their escape. The figure driving the chariot, identifiable by the ornate, Eastern-style clothing and Phrygian cap, is Orestes. He is guiding the horses away from Tauris. The figure being helped out of or ascending from the chariot is his sister, Iphigenia. The nude figure on the ground represents the defeated King Thoas, who attempted to prevent their escape. The winged figure above is a divine being, possibly Nike (Victory) or another deity, signifying the gods' assistance in their successful flight. Such complex narrative scenes drawn from Greek tragedies were common on Apulian vases of this period.\n\n<<<Iphigenia>>>"
