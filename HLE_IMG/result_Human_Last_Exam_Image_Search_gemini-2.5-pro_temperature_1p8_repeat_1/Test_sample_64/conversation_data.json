    "The process depicted in the image is **hyphal anastomosis**, which is the fusion of cells between fungal hyphae. This is a fundamental process in many filamentous fungi.\n\nThe three panels, labeled L, M, and N, show the progression of this cell fusion event:\n*   In panel **L**, two adjacent hyphal cells are in contact. The arrowhead points to the septum, the cross-wall separating the two cells.\n*   In panel **M**, the process of septal dissolution has begun. The arrowhead indicates the area where the cell wall is breaking down, leading to the formation of a fusion pore.\n*   In panel **N**, the fusion is complete. The septum has been entirely degraded, allowing the cytoplasm and organelles to mix freely between the two formerly separate cells, creating a continuous, interconnected network.\n\nThis process of anastomosis is crucial for various functions in fungi, including the development of a mycelial network for nutrient and signal transport, the exchange of genetic material, and maintaining the integrity of the fungal colony.\n\n<<<hyphal anastomosis>>>"
