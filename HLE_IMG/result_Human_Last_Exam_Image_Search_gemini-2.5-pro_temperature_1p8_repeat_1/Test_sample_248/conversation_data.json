    "The image displays several species of invertebrates common to a rocky intertidal habitat. The most prominent and identifiable organisms are the two large snails, which are Common Periwinkles (*Littorina littorea*). This species definitively indicates the photo was taken on the Atlantic Coast.\n\nThe Common Periwinkle is native to the northeastern Atlantic coasts of Europe. It was introduced to the Atlantic coast of North America in the mid-19th century and has since become widespread and abundant, ranging from Labrador, Canada, down to New Jersey in the United States.\n\nWhile *Littorina littorea* has been occasionally found on the Pacific Coast of North America, these introductions have not resulted in established, self-sustaining populations. Reports on the West Coast consist of small numbers of adult snails, likely introduced through the seafood trade, which have failed to reproduce and establish a permanent presence. Therefore, the high density of various life stages of organisms, typical of a thriving intertidal community as shown in the photograph, combined with the presence of the Common Periwinkle, makes an Atlantic coast location conclusive.\n\nOther organisms typical of the North Atlantic rocky intertidal zone, such as acorn barnacles and smaller periwinkles, are also visible in the photograph, further supporting this conclusion.\n\n<<<*Littorina littorea*>>>"
