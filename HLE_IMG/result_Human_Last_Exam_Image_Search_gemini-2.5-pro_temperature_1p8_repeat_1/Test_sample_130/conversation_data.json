    "The spectral lines shown in the image are characteristic of the **Sun**.\n\nThis pattern is known as the solar absorption spectrum, or Fraunhofer lines. It is not the spectrum of a single element but is created by numerous chemical elements present in the Sun's atmosphere.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what the image represents:\n\n*   **Continuous Spectrum:** The colorful background from violet to red is the continuous spectrum of light emitted by the Sun's hot, dense core (the photosphere).\n*   **Absorption Lines:** The dark vertical lines are called absorption lines or Fraunhofer lines. They are formed when cooler gases in the Sun's outer atmosphere (the chromosphere) absorb specific wavelengths of light.\n*   **Elemental Fingerprints:** Each element absorbs light at unique wavelengths, creating a distinct pattern of lines that acts as a \"fingerprint\". By analyzing these lines, astronomers can determine the chemical composition of the Sun's atmosphere.\n\nWhile many elements contribute to the thousands of Fraunhofer lines, some of the most prominent ones are caused by elements like hydrogen, sodium, and iron. For example, specific lines in the red, blue-green, and violet correspond to hydrogen (the Balmer series), while a well-known pair of lines in the yellow-orange region is from sodium.\n\n<<<The Sun>>>"
