This ink wash painting of a chrysanthemum and a rock is characteristic of the work of Pan Tianshou (1897–1971). He was an outstanding artist who, along with masters like Qi Baishi and Huang Binhong, significantly influenced the development of modern Chinese painting.\n\n*   **Top Right:** **Jin Shangyi**.
