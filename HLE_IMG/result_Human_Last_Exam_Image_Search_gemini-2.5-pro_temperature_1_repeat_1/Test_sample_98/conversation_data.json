    "Archaeologists ascribe the bronze, two-sided medallion from Veliki Preslav to the late 10th to early 11th century.\n\nThe pendant was discovered during archaeological excavations at a site named \"Street,\" located south of the Bishop's Residence in the historical Bulgarian city. The artifact is made of bronze with a high zinc content, giving it a golden hue.\n\nOne side of the medallion features a relief of the Crucifixion of Jesus, while the reverse depicts the Virgin Mary in a prayerful orant pose. The style of the representations is described as schematic and somewhat coarse, with unnaturally enlarged details. The medallion was found along with other items, including an encolpion cross, a small bell, and an appliqu√©, which collectively support the dating to the late 10th or early 11th century.\n\nVeliki Preslav was the capital of the First Bulgarian Empire from 893 to 970. The numerous archaeological finds from this area, including the famous Preslav Gold Treasure, highlight the city's importance as a major political, cultural, and artistic center during the Middle Ages.\n\n<<<10th-11th century A.D.>>>"
