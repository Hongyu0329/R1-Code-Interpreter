    "Based on a detailed analysis of the provided electron ionization mass spectrum, the following conclusions can be drawn:\n\n1.  **Molecular Ion (M⁺˙):** The peak at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) is 262. The presence of isotope peaks at m/z 264 (relative intensity to 262 is 12.9/29.0 ≈ 44%) suggests the presence of at least one chlorine atom. A detailed analysis points towards the presence of two chlorine atoms in the molecule.\n\n2.  **Molecular Formula:** Assuming the peak at m/z 262 is the molecular ion containing two ³⁵Cl atoms, the mass of the non-chlorine portion of the molecule is 262 - (2 * 35) = 192 u. A plausible elemental composition for this mass that fits chemical rules is C₁₅H₁₂, leading to a molecular formula of **C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂**. The exact mass of this formula matches the observed molecular weight.\n\n3.  **Fragmentation Pattern:**\n    *   The **base peak** (the most intense peak) is at **m/z 225**.\n    *   There is a significant peak at **m/z 227**. The intensity of this peak is too high to be solely the isotope peak of m/z 225. It is best explained as an overlap of two different fragments: the loss of a chlorine radical from the molecular ion ([M-Cl]⁺, 262-35=227) and the isotope peak of the m/z 225 fragment.\n    *   The formation of the base peak at m/z 225 can be explained by the loss of a molecule of hydrogen chloride (HCl, mass 36) followed by the loss of a hydrogen radical (H, mass 1) from the molecular ion. This pathway ([M-HCl-H]⁺) is common for chlorinated compounds that can form a stable, aromatic ion upon fragmentation.\n    *   The ion at m/z 225 therefore has the formula [C₁₅H₁₀Cl]⁺.\n    *   A significant peak at **m/z 190** corresponds to the loss of a chlorine atom from the base peak ion ([C₁₅H₁₀Cl]⁺ -> [C₁₅H₁₀]⁺), further confirming this fragmentation pathway.\n\n4.  **Compound Identification:** The molecular formula is determined to be C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂. While multiple isomers with this formula exist, a known compound that matches this is **(E)-1-(2,4-Dichlorophenyl)-3-phenylpropene**.\n\nTherefore, the compound corresponding to the mass spectrum is an isomer of dichlorophenyl-phenylpropene.\n\n**IUPAC Name:** (E)-1-(2,4-Dichlorophenyl)-3-phenylprop-1-ene\n\n<<<**(E)-1-(2,4-Dichlorophenyl)-3-phenylprop-1-ene**>>>"
