    "The tiling in the image exhibits multiple rotational symmetries, with the highest order being 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n\nA shape or pattern has rotational symmetry if it looks the same after being rotated by some angle less than 360 degrees around a central point. The \"order\" of the rotation is the number of times the figure matches its original orientation in a full 360-degree turn.\n\nBy closely examining the provided tiling, we can identify several points that act as centers for different orders of rotation:\n*   **6-fold symmetry:** There are points where the acute-angled vertices of six orange rhombi meet. Rotating the pattern by 60 degrees (360/6) around these points leaves the entire tiling unchanged.\n*   **4-fold symmetry:** The center of each tan square is a point of 4-fold rotational symmetry. A rotation of 90 degrees (360/4) around these centers maps the pattern onto itself.\n*   **3-fold symmetry:** Points exist where three of the dark blue hexagons meet. Rotating the tiling by 120 degrees (360/3) around these vertices preserves the pattern.\n*   **2-fold symmetry:** The midpoint of the boundary between any two adjacent hexagons serves as a center for 2-fold rotational symmetry (a 180-degree turn).\n\nSince the tiling is a periodic pattern that can cover an infinite plane without gaps or overlaps, it must adhere to the crystallographic restriction theorem. This theorem states that any periodic crystal lattice can only have rotational symmetries of order 2, 3, 4, or 6. The presence of 6-fold and 4-fold symmetries in this tiling is consistent with this principle.\n\nWhile the tiling has multiple rotational symmetries, the conventional way to describe \"the\" rotational symmetry of a pattern is to state the highest order it possesses. In this case, that is 6-fold symmetry.\n\n<<<6-fold rotational symmetry>>>"
