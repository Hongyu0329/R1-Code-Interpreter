    "The circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, form an A major chord. In the context of the piece's home key of D minor, this chord functions as the dominant.\n\nTo determine the correct Roman numeral, the following aspects are considered:\n\n*   **Key Signature:** The piece is in D minor. The D natural minor scale consists of the notes D, E, F, G, A, B♭, and C.\n*   **The Chord:** The notes circled in measure 8 are A, C♯, and E. These notes constitute an A major triad.\n*   **Harmonic Function:** In a minor key, the dominant chord is built on the fifth scale degree. In D minor, the fifth degree is A. To create a stronger pull towards the tonic (D minor), the third of the dominant chord is commonly raised. This raised third is called the leading tone. In this case, the C natural from the natural minor scale is raised to a C♯. This alteration changes the diatonic minor dominant chord (A-C-E) to a major dominant chord (A-C♯-E).\n*   **Roman Numeral:** The Roman numeral for a dominant chord is V. Because the chord is major, an uppercase \"V\" is used. The chord is in root position as the note A is in the bass.\n\nTherefore, the accurate Roman numeral for the circled notes is V.\n\n<<<V>>>"
