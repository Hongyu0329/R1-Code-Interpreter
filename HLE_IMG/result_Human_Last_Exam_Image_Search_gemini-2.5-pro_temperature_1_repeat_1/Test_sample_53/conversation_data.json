    "The figure leaving the chariot is a goddess, likely Athena, participating in the Gigantomachy, the mythical battle between the Olympian gods and the Giants.\n\nThe scene depicted on this red-figure oinochoe (a wine jug) is a common one in Greek art: the Gigantomachy. Several elements in the image support this identification. A winged figure, the goddess of victory Nike, acts as the charioteer, a role she often plays in depictions of this great battle. Below the chariot lies a fallen figure, representing one of the defeated Giants.\n\nThe figure dismounting the chariot is a goddess, identified by her elaborate attire and regal bearing. While several goddesses fought in the Gigantomachy, the specific rendering, particularly the style of the vase, points towards this being a depiction of one of the major Olympian deities going into battle. In many similar scenes, Zeus is accompanied by Nike in his chariot. However, other gods and goddesses are also shown in victorious chariot scenes, frequently driven by Nike. The elaborate, patterned clothing and crown are characteristic of goddesses like Hera or Athena in such triumphant depictions.\n\n<<<A goddess, likely Athena, in a Gigantomachy scene>>>"
