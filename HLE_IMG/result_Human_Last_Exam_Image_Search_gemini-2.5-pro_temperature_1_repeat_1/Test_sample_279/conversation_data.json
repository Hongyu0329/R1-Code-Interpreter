    "Based on the location of the lesion, this corresponds to a G.V. Black Class I caries classification.\n\nThe image displays a molar tooth with a restoration (filling). The decay, known as recurrent or secondary caries, is located in the pits and fissures of the occlusal (chewing) surface, surrounding the existing filling.\n\nAccording to G.V. Black's classification system, one of the most widely used systems in dentistry, Class I caries are defined as those occurring in the pits and fissures of the occlusal surfaces of molars and premolars. Even when decay reoccurs around a pre-existing filling, its classification is determined by its anatomical location. Since the caries in the picture are confined to the occlusal pits and fissures, it is classified as Class I.\n\n<<<Class I>>>"
