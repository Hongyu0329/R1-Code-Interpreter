    "The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image fragment is known as the **Gripsholm Runestone**, and its ID is **Sö 179**.\n\nThis famous runestone is one of approximately 26 Ingvar runestones, which were raised to commemorate those who died in a Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled. The expedition, which took place between 1036 and 1041, was a disastrous failure, with few, if any, participants returning.\n\nThe inscription on Sö 179 was commissioned by a woman named Tóla in memory of her son Harald, who was the brother of Ingvar. The text reads: \"Tóla had this stone raised in memory of her son Haraldr, Ingvarr's brother. They travelled valiantly far for gold, and in the east gave (food) to the eagle. (They) died in the south in Serkland.\" The phrase \"gave food to the eagle\" is a kenning, or poetic metaphor, for killing enemies in battle.\n\nDiscovered in the early 1820s, the stone was being used as a threshold in the cellar of Gripsholm Castle. It is now located outside the castle in Mariefred, Sweden, alongside another runestone, Sö 178.\n\n<<<Sö 179>>>"
