    "This piece of music is \"The Promised Land\" from the movie *Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children*. The song was originally composed by Nobuo Uematsu, whose music is a cornerstone of the *Final Fantasy* series.\n\nThe sheet music displays several characteristic features of this piece:\n*   It begins with a gentle piano melody in A minor.\n*   There is a sudden shift in dynamics to a loud and dramatic section featuring rapid arpeggios (broken chords).\n*   The piece has a complex and emotional character, which is typical of Uematsu's compositions for the *Final Fantasy* series.\n\nVarious arrangements for piano solo are available, and this appears to be one of them.\n\n<<<The Promised Land>>>"
