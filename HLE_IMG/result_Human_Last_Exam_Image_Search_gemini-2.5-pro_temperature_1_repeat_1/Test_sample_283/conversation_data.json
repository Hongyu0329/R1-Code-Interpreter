    "Based on the recurring annual peaks in the Google Trends graph, the country in question is the United States. The graph illustrates search interest for three significant historical events commemorated annually in the U.S.\n\nThe patterns in the graph can be interpreted as follows:\n*   **The red line,** with its consistent peaks in early December, corresponds to National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. This day, observed annually on December 7, commemorates the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.\n*   **The yellow line** shows prominent spikes in late May each year. This timing aligns with Memorial Day, a U.S. federal holiday observed on the last Monday of May to honor military personnel who have died while serving.\n*   **The blue line** shows smaller peaks that often coincide with the Memorial Day spikes. This represents the anniversary of D-Day, the Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944. Its proximity to Memorial Day and thematic connection as a major World War II event likely causes a related increase in public interest and searches around the same time.\n\nA historian would recognize this combined pattern of annual remembrance for Pearl Harbor, Memorial Day, and D-Day as distinctly characteristic of the United States.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
