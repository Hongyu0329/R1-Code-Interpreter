    "To determine the molecular formula of the final product, we must analyze the reaction sequence step by step.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Starting Material → Intermediate 1**\n    *   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is 2-(p-methoxybenzyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. Its molecular formula is C₁₅H₁₄F₃NO₂.\n    *   **Reaction:** The reagent is Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in acetonitrile and water (ACN/H₂O). CAN is a strong oxidizing agent commonly used for the cleavage of p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting groups from amines. This reaction removes the PMB group (C₈H₉O) and adds a hydrogen to the nitrogen atom.\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. The molecular formula changes by -C₈H₈O, resulting in **C₇H₆F₃NO**.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Intermediate 1 → Intermediate 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** The reagents are Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H₂) in methanol (MeOH). This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. These conditions are standard for the reduction of a carbon-carbon double bond. The C=C bond in the bicyclic ring is reduced to a C-C single bond.\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** The product is 5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one. The reaction involves the addition of one molecule of H₂, so two hydrogen atoms are added to the molecular formula of Intermediate 1. The resulting formula is C₇H(₆+₂)F₃NO, which is **C₇H₈F₃NO**.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Intermediate 2 → Product**\n    *   **Reaction:** Intermediate 2 is treated with 4 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 70 °C. Intermediate 2 is a bicyclic lactam (a cyclic amide). Under strong acidic conditions and heat, lactams undergo hydrolysis.\n    *   **Product:** The hydrolysis reaction cleaves the amide bond (the N-C=O bond) within the ring. This process incorporates one molecule of water (H₂O), opening the ring to form a compound containing both an amino group (-NH₂) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The product is 4-amino-2-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid. The molecular formula of the final product is determined by adding H₂O to the formula of Intermediate 2: C₇H₈F₃NO + H₂O → C₇H(₈+₂)F₃N(O+₁), which results in **C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂**.\n\n<<<C₇H₁₀F₃NO₂>>>"
