    "The title of the 19th-century painting, a fragment of which is presented, is likely **\"The Burning Mill\"**.\n\nWhile the exact artist remains unconfirmed through visual analysis and search, the painting's style is characteristic of 19th-century European romanticism, possibly from the Dutch school. The scene depicts a dramatic event, a fire near a windmill under a dark and stormy sky. This subject matter and artistic approach are consistent with the themes popular in that era. The title \"The Burning Mill\" aptly describes the central event portrayed in the artwork. A painting with a similar theme and title, \"Cavalry Battle in front of a Burning Mill\" by Philips Wouwerman, exists, but it is from the 17th century and differs in style and composition. The presented fragment is more aligned with the aesthetics of the 19th century.\n\n<<<The Burning Mill>>>"
