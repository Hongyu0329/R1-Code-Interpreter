    "The element that has the spectral lines shown in the image is **Uranium (U)**.\n\nThe provided image displays a complex emission spectrum with a multitude of lines spread across the entire visible range, from blue to red. This high density of spectral lines is a characteristic feature of heavy elements with complex electronic structures, such as uranium.\n\nA visual comparison of the provided image with known emission spectra of uranium confirms this identification. The distribution and pattern of the bright emission lines in the blue, green, yellow, and red regions of the spectrum in the user's image are consistent with the reference spectra for uranium, such as the simulated emission spectrum of neutral uranium (U I) from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Atomic Spectra Database.\n\n<<<Uranium>>>"
