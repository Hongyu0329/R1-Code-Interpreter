    "Based on the visual analysis of the provided graph, which shows the firing activity of a neuronal culture, the synchronized bursts are identified as the dense vertical bands where a large number of electrodes fire simultaneously.\n\n**1. Identification of Burst Timestamps:**\nThe approximate timestamps for the center of each major synchronized burst are as follows:\n*   **Burst 1:** ~3 s\n*   **Burst 2:** ~16 s\n*   **Burst 3:** ~26 s\n*   **Burst 4:** ~36 s\n*   **Burst 5:** ~48 s\n\n**2. Calculation of Inter-Burst Intervals (IBI):**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time difference between the start of successive bursts.\n*   **IBI 1-2:** 16 s - 3 s = 13 s\n*   **IBI 2-3:** 26 s - 16 s = 10 s\n*   **IBI 3-4:** 36 s - 26 s = 10 s\n*   **IBI 4-5:** 48 s - 36 s = 12 s\n\n**3. Calculation of Average Inter-Burst Interval:**\nThe average of these intervals is calculated as:\n*   Average IBI = (13 + 10 + 10 + 12) / 4 = 45 / 4 = 11.25 s\n\nRounding to two significant figures, the average inter-burst interval is 11 s.\n\n<<<11>>>"
