    "The correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Path√©tique\" sonata is **V7**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the analysis:\n*   **Key Signature:** The sonata is in C minor.\n*   **Notes in Measure 30:** The notes played in both the right and left hands combined are G, B-natural, D, and F.\n*   **Chord Identification:** These notes form a G dominant seventh chord (G7).\n*   **Roman Numeral:** In the key of C minor, the dominant chord is built on the fifth scale degree, which is G. The G7 chord functions as the dominant seventh. Therefore, it is represented by the Roman numeral V7. The B-natural is the raised leading tone, which is standard for a dominant chord in a minor key.\n\nSome musical analyses note the use of an augmented 6th chord in this measure, specifically on the last beat leading into measure 31. However, the primary and defining harmony of the measure is the V7 chord.\n\n<<<V7>>>"
