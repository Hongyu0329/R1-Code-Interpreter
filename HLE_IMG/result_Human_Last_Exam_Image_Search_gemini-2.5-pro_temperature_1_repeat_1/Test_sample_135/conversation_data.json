    "The detail of the altarpiece presented in the image, titled \"Sacrament de l'autel,\" is a work by the French Renaissance sculptor **Jean Goujon**.\n\nThis relief is one of several works Goujon created for the rood screen (a screen separating the nave from the chancel) of the church of Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois in Paris around 1544. The rood screen was dismantled in the 18th century, and its surviving elements are now housed in the Louvre Museum. This specific roundel depicts the sacrament of the Eucharist.\n\nJean Goujon (c. 1510 â€“ c. 1568) was a leading sculptor of the French Renaissance. He was appointed \"sculptor to the king\" Henry II of France in 1547 and is known for his elegant and fluid Mannerist style. His most famous works include the decorations for the Fontaine des Innocents in Paris and sculptural work for the Louvre Palace, where he collaborated with architect Pierre Lescot. As a Huguenot (French Protestant), Goujon likely fled Paris around 1562 to escape religious persecution.\n\n<<<Jean Goujon>>>"
