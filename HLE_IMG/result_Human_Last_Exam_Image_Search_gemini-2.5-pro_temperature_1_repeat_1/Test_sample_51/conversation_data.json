    "The word in the manuscript is a form of the common Greek word **μισθός** (misthos), which means \"wage,\" \"pay,\" or \"reward.\" The specific form written is **μισθόν** (misthon), the accusative singular case, meaning it would be used as the direct object of a verb.\n\nThe scribe has written the word as **μισθό̅ν**. The individual letters and features in the Byzantine minuscule script are:\n*   **μ (mu)**: The first letter.\n*   **ι (iota)**: The second letter.\n*   **σ (sigma)**: The third letter, in its lunate form (C-shaped), which was common in the medieval period.\n*   **θ (theta)**: The fourth letter.\n*   **ο (omicron) with a line above it**: The fifth letter is an omicron. The horizontal line above it is a common scribal abbreviation called a *nomen sacrum* or suspension, used here to indicate the omission of the final letter(s) of a common word. In this context, it stands for the final **ν (nu)**.\n*   **Accent**: The mark above the theta is an acute accent (´) which belongs to the preceding sigma, indicating the stress on that syllable: μίσθον. Scribes sometimes shifted the placement of accents over the correct syllable.\n\nTherefore, the fully transcribed word, including the resolution of the abbreviation and correct placement of the accent, is **μίσθον**.\n\n<<<μίσθον>>>"
