    "The correct sequence for a forced mate in two is:\n\n1.  **... Bg4**\n2.  **... Ng3#**\n\nHere is the step-by-step explanation:\n\n*   **Initial Position Analysis:** The white king on g1 is already heavily restricted. All of its potential escape squares are either blocked or attacked by black's pieces:\n    *   **f1:** Attacked by the black king on g8 and the black queen on b1.\n    *   **f2:** Attacked by the black queen on a2.\n    *   **g2:** Attacked by the black queen on a2 and the black bishop on h3.\n    *   **h1:** Attacked by the black queen on b1.\n    *   **h2:** Blocked by its own pawn and also attacked by the black queen on a2.\n\n*   **Black's First Move (1. ... Bg4):** The key to the puzzle is to find a move that forces a checkmate regardless of white's response. White's main defensive idea is to play `hxg3` if black tries to check with the knight on g3. The move `Bg4` cleverly prevents this by pinning the h2-pawn to the king. With the bishop on g4, the h2-pawn cannot legally capture the knight on g3.\n\n*   **White's Possible Moves:** After `Bg4`, white has a few possible moves, but none of them can stop the impending checkmate. White can move the c-pawn (`c4`), the e-pawn (`e6`), or the bishop on c1 (`Bd2`, `Bxb2`, `Bxa3`).\n\n*   **Black's Second Move (2. ... Ng3#):** Regardless of which legal move white makes, black follows up with `Ng3#`. This is checkmate because:\n    *   The white king is in check from the knight on g3.\n    *   The knight cannot be captured because the pawn on h2 is pinned by the bishop on g4.\n    *   The check cannot be blocked.\n    *   The king cannot move to any of its adjacent squares, as they are all still under attack or blocked.\n\n<<<Bg4, Ng3#>>>"
