    "The transformation shown involves two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions. The overall reaction is the addition of hexafluorobenzene to cyclobutene to form a complex polycyclic product under the influence of light (hv). This process occurs in two distinct steps:\n\n1.  **Photochemical Electrocyclization:** The first step is the photochemical valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene into its highly strained isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar benzene. This type of reaction is an electrocyclic reaction, which involves the concerted formation of a sigma bond within a conjugated π-electron system to create a ring. Specifically, it is a 4π-electron electrocyclic ring-closing reaction. Under photochemical conditions, this reaction is allowed by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. The resulting Dewar benzene is a bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene structure.\n\n2.  **[2+2] Photocycloaddition:** The second step is a cycloaddition reaction between the photochemically generated hexafluoro-Dewar benzene and cyclobutene. A cycloaddition is a reaction where two unsaturated molecules combine to form a cyclic compound. In this case, one of the double bonds of hexafluoro-Dewar benzene reacts with the double bond of cyclobutene in a [2+2] cycloaddition. This reaction is also photochemically allowed and results in the formation of a new four-membered ring, fusing the two reactant molecules and yielding the final tricyclic product.\n\nTherefore, the two pericyclic reactions involved are an electrocyclic reaction followed by a [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\n<<<An electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition>>>"
