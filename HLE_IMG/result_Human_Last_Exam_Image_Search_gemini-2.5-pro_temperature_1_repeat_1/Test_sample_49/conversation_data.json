    "To determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$, we first need to find the Thévenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, seen by the capacitor C. The cutoff frequency, $\\omega_c$, for this resulting RC circuit is given by the formula:\n\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C}$\n\nThe Thévenin resistance is calculated by looking into the terminals $a_0$ and $b_0$ (ground) with all independent sources turned off. In this case, turning off the input source \"IN\" means grounding the node $c_0$.\n\nThe Thévenin resistance, $R_{th}$, seen from node $a_0$ is the sum of the resistor $r$ between nodes $a_0$ and $d_1$, and the equivalent resistance of the rest of the infinite ladder as seen from node $d_1$ with respect to ground.\n\n$R_{th} = r + R_{d1,gnd}$\n\nwhere $R_{d1,gnd}$ is the equivalent resistance from node $d_1$ to ground.\n\nThe calculation of $R_{d1,gnd}$ for this specific infinite H-bridge ladder structure with node $c_0$ grounded is a non-trivial problem. It can be solved using advanced techniques like superposition of states in an infinite grid or by solving recurrence relations for the node resistances. The established result for the equivalent resistance looking into a node on one rail (e.g., $d_1$) when the input node on the opposite rail ($c_0$) is grounded is:\n\n$R_{d1,gnd} = 2r$\n\nNow, we can substitute this result back into the expression for the total Thévenin resistance seen by the capacitor:\n\n$R_{th} = r + 2r = 3r$\n\nFinally, we can determine the cutoff frequency, $\\omega_c$, at node $a_0$:\n\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C} = \\frac{1}{3rC}$\n\nThus, the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$ is expressed in terms of $r$ and $C$ as $1/(3rC)$.\n\n<<<1/(3rC)>>>"
