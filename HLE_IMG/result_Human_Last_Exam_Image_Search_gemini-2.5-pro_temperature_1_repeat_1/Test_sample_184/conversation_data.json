    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the two products of the reaction sequence.\n\n**Step 1: 4π Electrocyclic Ring Opening**\n\nThe first step is a thermal (indicated by Δ) 4π electrocyclic ring opening of the cyclobutene derivative. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a thermal 4π electrocyclic reaction proceeds via a **conrotatory** ring opening.\n\n1.  **Stereochemistry of the Starting Material:** The starting cyclobutene has two substituents on the breaking sigma bond (at C3 and C4). We can see that the methoxy (MeO) group at C3 and the methyl (Me) group at C4 are both shown with wedges, indicating they are `cis` to each other.\n2.  **Conrotatory Opening Rule:** For a cyclobutene, when the two substituents on the breaking bond are `cis`, a conrotatory opening leads to a 1,3-diene with one double bond having (E)-geometry and the other having (Z)-geometry.\n3.  **Formation of Two Dienes:** Since conrotatory motion can occur in two different ways (both groups rotating clockwise or both rotating counter-clockwise), two different diastereomeric dienes are formed. Let's denote the stereochemistry at the first carbon of the diene (from C3 of the cyclobutene) and the fourth carbon (from C4 of the cyclobutene).\n    *   **Diene 1:** One mode of opening will result in a diene with (E)-geometry for the MeO-substituted double bond and (Z)-geometry for the C4-substituted double bond.\n    *   **Diene 2:** The other mode of opening will result in a diene with (Z)-geometry for the MeO-substituted double bond and (E)-geometry for the C4-substituted double bond.\n\n**Step 2: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n\nThe second step is a Diels-Alder reaction between the generated dienes and ethyl acrylate. The problem specifies that the reaction occurs in an **endo** fashion. The endo rule states that the electron-withdrawing group of the dienophile (the -CO₂Et group) is positioned under the π system of the diene in the transition state. This has a direct consequence on the stereochemistry of the final product.\n\n*   **Stereochemical Rule:** The endo substituent (CO₂Et) will end up on the same side of the newly formed ring as the \"inward-pointing\" substituents of the diene in its s-cis conformation, and on the opposite side of the \"outward-pointing\" substituents.\n\nLet's analyze the reaction for each diene:\n\n**Reaction of Diene 1 ((1E, 4Z)-diene):**\n*   In the required s-cis conformation for the Diels-Alder reaction, the (E)-substituent at C1 (MeO) points \"outward\".\n*   At C4, which has (Z)-geometry, the higher priority substituent (OMe) points \"inward\", while the lower priority substituent (Me) points \"outward\".\n*   According to the endo rule, the incoming CO₂Et group will be *cis* to the inward-pointing OMe group and *trans* to the outward-pointing Me group.\n*   Therefore, the product from Diene 1 will have the methyl group at the quaternary center and the ester group (-CO₂Et) in a **trans** relationship. This corresponds to structures **A** or **D**.\n\n**Reaction of Diene 2 ((1Z, 4E)-diene):**\n*   In the s-cis conformation, the (Z)-substituent at C1 (MeO) points \"inward\".\n*   At C4, which has (E)-geometry, the higher priority substituent (OMe) points \"outward\", while the lower priority substituent (Me) points \"inward\".\n*   According to the endo rule, the incoming CO₂Et group will be *cis* to the inward-pointing Me group.\n*   Therefore, the product from Diene 2 will have the methyl group at the quaternary center and the ester group (-CO₂Et) in a **cis** relationship. This corresponds to structures **B** or **C**.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the Two Products**\n\nThe reaction starts from a single enantiomer of the cyclobutene, and the reactions are stereospecific. This means that two specific diastereomeric products will be formed: one from the {A, D} pair and one from the {B, C} pair.\n\nLet's examine the proposed pairs of products.\n*   **Pair (C, D):**\n    *   **Product C:** The Me group (wedge) and the CO₂Et group (wedge) are *cis*. This product would arise from Diene 2.\n    *   **Product D:** The Me group (dash) and the CO₂Et group (wedge) are *trans*. This product would arise from Diene 1.\n*   The pair (C, D) consists of two diastereomers, one of which has a *cis*-Me/CO₂Et relationship and the other a *trans*-Me/CO₂Et relationship. This is consistent with our analysis of the two reaction pathways.\n\nThe specific selection of C and D from their respective enantiomeric pairs {B, C} and {A, D} depends on the absolute configuration of the starting material and the specific face of attack in the Diels-Alder reaction. However, the pair (C, D) represents a valid diastereomeric outcome of the described reaction sequence. Both products C and D show the CO₂Et group with a wedged bond, suggesting a consistent facial selectivity in the Diels-Alder step for both diene intermediates.\n\nTherefore, the two products of the reaction are C and D.\n\n<<<C and D>>>"
