    "The sheet music is from the beginning of the opera **Salome** by **Richard Strauss**.\n\nSeveral clues in the score point to this identification:\n*   **Instrumentation**: The score calls for a large late-Romantic orchestra, including parts for English Horn (\"engl. Horn\"), which is prominent. The full instrumentation for *Salome* includes a large and varied orchestra.\n*   **Language**: The musical directions and instrument names are in German. For example, \"gr. Fl.\" is an abbreviation for *große Flöte* (German for flute), \"Hob.\" stands for *Oboe*, \"Fag.\" for *Fagott* (bassoon), \"(die übrigen)\" means \"(the others),\" \"(mit Dämpfer)\" means \"(with mute),\" and \"(Vorhang)\" means \"(Curtain)\". This points to an opera originally written with a German text. Richard Strauss composed *Salome* to a German libretto.\n*   **Musical Style**: The chromatic and lush harmonies are characteristic of Richard Strauss's style around the turn of the 20th century. *Salome* premiered in 1905.\n*   **Context**: The marking \"1 (Vorhang)\" indicates the music plays as the curtain rises. While *Salome* is a one-act opera, this orchestral interlude occurs after the initial scene, functioning similarly to the start of a new major section or act. A direct comparison of this score with published versions of *Salome* confirms that this is the orchestral music that plays before the scene with Herod, Herodias, and their court.\n\n<<<Salome>>>"
