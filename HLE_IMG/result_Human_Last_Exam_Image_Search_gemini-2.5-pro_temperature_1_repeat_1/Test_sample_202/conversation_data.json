    "Based on the visual characteristics of the rock specimens and the information gathered, here is the identification of each rock:\n\n*   **H: Scoria**\n    This specimen is a type of volcanic rock that is reddish-brown and has a highly porous or vesicular texture. The numerous visible holes, or vesicles, are formed by gas bubbles that were trapped as the lava cooled. Scoria is typically dark in color (brown, black, or red) and has a composition similar to basalt or andesite.\n\n*   **I: Volcanic Breccia**\n    This rock is composed of angular fragments of other rocks cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. This texture is characteristic of a breccia. Given the context of the other volcanic specimens, it is likely a volcanic breccia, which forms from the explosive eruption of lava that incorporates rock fragments from the magma conduit or the surrounding area.\n\n*   **J: Pumice**\n    This specimen is a light-colored, vesicular volcanic rock. Like scoria, it is porous, but it is typically white, gray, or tan and has a much lower density due to a higher concentration of smaller bubbles. In many cases, pumice is so light that it can float on water. It forms from the rapid cooling of gas-rich, viscous magma, often during explosive eruptions.\n\n*   **K: Pegmatite**\n    This specimen is an igneous rock characterized by its very large, interlocking crystals, which are typically greater than one centimeter in size. The rock appears to be composed of different minerals, indicated by the various colors of the crystals. Pegmatites are usually similar in composition to granite, containing minerals like quartz, feldspar, and mica. They form during the final stages of magma crystallization from a water-rich residual melt, which allows for the growth of exceptionally large crystals.\n\n<<<H: Scoria\nI: Volcanic Breccia\nJ: Pumice\nK: Pegmatite>>>"
