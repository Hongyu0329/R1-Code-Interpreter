    "The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*, which allows for distinguishing the two species at a glance, is the seta.\n\nIn *Grimmia montana*, the sporophyte features a capsule held on a **straight seta**. This results in an erect, exserted capsule.\n\nConversely, *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by a capsule borne on an **arcuate, or curved, seta**. The species name itself, *curviseta*, refers to this prominent feature. This curvature of the seta is a key diagnostic trait for identification when the sporophyte is present.\n\n<<<The primary distinguishing feature of the sporophyte is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a curved (arcuate) seta.>>>"
