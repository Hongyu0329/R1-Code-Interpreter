    "The product with a French-derived name is **Bourjois**.\n\nThe advertisement in the image is for the French cosmetics company Bourjois, which was sold in British stores like Boots and Woolworth's during World War II. The ad campaign, which included the slogan \"Women are winning the War - of Freedom,\" promoted the idea that using makeup, such as their \"Evening in Paris\" (Soir de Paris) line, helped women maintain their femininity and morale.\n\nDuring the war, as women took on industrial jobs traditionally held by men, these advertisements suggested that personal care and beauty were ways for them to overcome the hardships of their new roles and contribute to the war effort with confidence. The use of cosmetics was framed not as a vanity but as a vital tool for self-expression and empowerment during a challenging time.\n\n<<<Bourjois>>>"
