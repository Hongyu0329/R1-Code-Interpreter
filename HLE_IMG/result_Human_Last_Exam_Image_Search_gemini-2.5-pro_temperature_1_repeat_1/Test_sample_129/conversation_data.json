    "The image displays the protein complex between **Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 G2 (UBE2G2)** and the **UBA domain of Ubiquilin-1**.\n\nThe larger, dark blue structure is the UBE2G2 protein, and the smaller, light blue structure is the UBA (Ubiquitin-Associated) domain of Ubiquilin-1. This complex is involved in a cellular process called endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), which is a quality control pathway that targets misfolded proteins for degradation.\n\nUBE2G2 is a member of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family, which plays a crucial role in ubiquitination, a process that tags proteins with ubiquitin for various cellular functions, including degradation by the proteasome. The protein has a molecular weight of approximately 18.6 kDa. The structure shown is the result of X-ray diffraction and has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB).\n\nThe interaction between UBE2G2 and the UBA domain of Ubiquilin-1 is important for its function. For instance, the accessory protein AUP1 recruits UBE2G2 from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum via its G2BR segment to facilitate ubiquitination. Structural analyses of this and similar complexes have revealed how these interactions can allosterically enhance the ubiquitination process.\n\n<<<Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 G2 (UBE2G2) in complex with the UBA domain of Ubiquilin-1>>>"
