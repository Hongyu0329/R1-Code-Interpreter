    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. The organism is a colonial tunicate, and its scientific name is *Botryllus schlosseri*.\n\nThis marine invertebrate is commonly known as the star tunicate or golden star tunicate. It forms colonies that can vary in color, including yellow, dark purple, red, brown, or black. These colonies consist of many small, individual animals called zooids, which are arranged in star-shaped systems. Each zooid is about 1 to 5 mm long.\n\n*Botryllus schlosseri* is a filter-feeder that attaches to various submerged surfaces like rocks, boat hulls, and even other marine organisms. The colonies have a smooth, leathery appearance, with numerous small pores (buccal siphons) for taking in water and fewer, larger openings (atrial siphons) for expelling it. This species is considered an invasive species in many parts of the world, having spread from its native range in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It is the most common colonial tunicate in North America.\n\nThese tunicates are also of scientific interest because they are the only chordates capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction and have robust stem cell-mediated regeneration capabilities.\n\n<<<*Botryllus schlosseri*>>>"
