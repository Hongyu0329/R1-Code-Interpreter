    "To determine the stereochemical assignments, we will apply the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules to each of the four stereocenters in the reaction scheme, moving from left to right. This reaction is an esterification where the stereochemistry of the reacting centers is retained because the bonds to the chiral carbons are not broken.\n\n**1. Stereocenter of the Acyl Chloride (Leftmost Reactant)**\n\nThis molecule is a derivative of Mosher's acid, specifically (R)-(−)-α-Methoxy-α-(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetyl chloride. Let's verify this assignment.\n*   **Chiral Carbon Attachments:** The central carbon is bonded to a phenyl group (-C6H5), a methoxy group (-OCH3), a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3), and an acyl chloride group (-COCl).\n*   **Assigning Priorities:**\n    1.  **-OCH3:** Highest priority due to the oxygen atom (atomic number 8).\n    2.  **-COCl:** The carbon is treated as bonded to (O, O, Cl). This has a higher priority than -CF3 because Cl (17) > F (9).\n    3.  **-CF3:** The carbon is bonded to (F, F, F). This has a higher priority than -C6H5 because F (9) > C (6).\n    4.  **-C6H5:** Lowest priority.\n*   **Determining Configuration:** The lowest priority group (#4, -C6H5) is in the plane of the drawing. To correctly assign the configuration, we can mentally rotate the molecule to place the #4 group in the back. If we rotate around the vertical C-COCl bond so that the phenyl group moves to the back, the methoxy group (-OCH3, #1) moves to the front-left, and the trifluoromethyl group (-CF3, #3) moves further to the front-right. The acyl chloride group (-COCl, #2) remains pointing up. With the lowest priority group in the back, we trace the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3. This path is clockwise, which corresponds to an **(R)** configuration.\n\n**2. Stereocenter of the Alcohol (Second Reactant)**\n\n*   **Chiral Carbon Attachments:** The chiral carbon is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a hydrogen atom (-H, implied, pointing away), a methoxymethyl group (-CH2OCH3), and an isobutyl group (-CH2CH(CH3)2).\n*   **Assigning Priorities:**\n    1.  **-OH:** Highest priority (O, atomic number 8).\n    2.  **-CH2OCH3:** The next atom out is oxygen, which has a higher atomic number than the carbon in the isobutyl group.\n    3.  **-CH2CH(CH3)2:** The next atom out is carbon.\n    4.  **-H:** Lowest priority.\n*   **Determining Configuration:** The lowest priority group (#4, -H) is pointing away from the viewer. We trace the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3. This path (from -OH to -CH2OCH3 to -CH2CH(CH3)2) is counter-clockwise. Therefore, the configuration is **(S)**.\n\n**3. Left Stereocenter of the Product**\n\nThis stereocenter originates from the alcohol reactant. Since the esterification reaction occurs at the oxygen atom of the alcohol and does not break any bonds to the chiral carbon, the configuration is retained. Thus, this stereocenter remains **(S)**.\n\n**4. Right Stereocenter of the Product**\n\nThis stereocenter originates from the acyl chloride reactant. The reaction occurs at the carbonyl carbon, where the chloride is replaced by the oxygen from the alcohol. None of the bonds to the adjacent chiral carbon are affected, so its configuration is also retained. Thus, this stereocenter remains **(R)**.\n\nMoving from left to right across the entire reaction scheme, the stereochemical assignments are (R), (S), (S), and (R).\n\n<<<(R), (S), (S), (R)>>>"
