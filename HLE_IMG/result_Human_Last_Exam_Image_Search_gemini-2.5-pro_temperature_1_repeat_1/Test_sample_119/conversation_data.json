    "### Analysis of Spectroscopic Data\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)**\nThe mass spectrum shows a molecular ion (M+) peak at an m/z of 135. Applying the nitrogen rule, the odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule.\n\n**2. Elemental Formula and Degree of Unsaturation**\nAssuming one nitrogen atom (mass ≈ 14), the remaining mass is 121. The ¹H and ¹³C NMR data strongly indicate a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅, mass = 77). The remaining mass is 121 - 77 = 44, which corresponds to a C₃H₈ fragment. Combining these fragments (C₆H₅ + C₃H₈ + N) gives a molecular formula of C₉H₁₃N.\n\nThe degree of unsaturation for C₉H₁₃N is calculated as:\nDoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 4.\nA benzene ring accounts for all four degrees of unsaturation.\n\n**3. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**\n*   **~3050 cm⁻¹:** Aromatic C-H stretching.\n*   **~2850-2950 cm⁻¹:** Aliphatic C-H stretching.\n*   **~1600, 1495, 1450 cm⁻¹:** Aromatic C=C ring stretching.\n*   The absence of a strong peak around 1700 cm⁻¹ confirms the lack of a carbonyl (C=O) group.\n*   Broad signals typical for N-H stretches (around 3300-3500 cm⁻¹) are not clearly visible but may be weak or overlapping.\n\n**4. ¹H NMR Spectroscopy**\nThe ¹H NMR spectrum reveals the following signals:\n*   **δ 7.1-7.3 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** A monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n*   **δ ~2.8 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** A -CH₂- (methylene) group.\n*   **δ ~2.5 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** A -CH- (methine) group.\n*   **δ 1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H):** A -CH₃ (methyl) group coupled to a single proton (the -CH- group).\n\nThe total proton count is 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 11. This leaves two protons from the formula C₉H₁₃N unaccounted for, which are attributed to a primary amine (-NH₂) group.\n\n**5. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectroscopy**\nThe ¹³C NMR spectrum shows 7 distinct carbon signals:\n*   **Aromatic region:** δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3.\n*   **Aliphatic region:** δ 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n\nThe DEPT-135 data clarifies the carbon types:\n*   **One negative signal:** Corresponds to a CH₂ group. This must be the signal at **δ 43.5**.\n*   **Five positive signals:** Correspond to CH and CH₃ groups. These are the three aromatic CH carbons (δ 128.5, 127.3, 126.3), the aliphatic CH (methine) carbon, and the CH₃ (methyl) carbon.\n*   **No signal in DEPT:** The quaternary aromatic carbon (ipso-carbon) does not appear, which corresponds to the **δ 145.1** signal.\n\nBased on the signals and their types, we can make the following assignments:\n*   **δ 19.2:** CH₃ group.\n*   **δ 43.5:** CH₂ group.\n*   **δ 49.6:** CH group.\n\n**6. HSQC Spectroscopy**\nThe HSQC spectrum correlates the proton signals with their directly attached carbon signals:\n*   The aromatic protons (δ ~7.2 ppm) correlate with the aromatic carbons (δ 126-129 ppm).\n*   The CH₃ protons (δ ~1.2 ppm) correlate with the CH₃ carbon (**δ 19.2 ppm**).\n*   The CH₂ protons (δ ~2.8 ppm) correlate with the CH₂ carbon (**δ 43.5 ppm**).\n*   The CH proton (δ ~2.5 ppm) correlates with the CH carbon (**δ 49.6 ppm**).\n\n### Structure Determination\n\nThe combined spectral data allows for the unambiguous determination of the molecular structure.\n1.  The presence of a C₆H₅- group is confirmed by NMR and IR.\n2.  The aliphatic fragment is -CH₂-CH-CH₃.\n3.  The -NH₂ group is present to satisfy the molecular formula.\n4.  The ¹H NMR shows a methyl doublet, confirming a -CH-CH₃ arrangement.\n5.  The ¹³C and HSQC data identify the signal at δ 43.5 ppm as a CH₂ group, and its ¹H NMR shift (~2.8 ppm) is characteristic of a benzylic methylene group (C₆H₅-CH₂-).\n6.  The remaining fragment is -CH(NH₂)-CH₃. The carbon of this CH group is attached to the nitrogen, accounting for its downfield shift to δ 49.6 ppm.\n\nAssembling these pieces (C₆H₅-CH₂- and -CH(NH₂)-CH₃) yields the structure of **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n### IUPAC Name\nThe principal functional group is the amine. The longest carbon chain containing this group is a three-carbon chain (propane). Numbering starts from the end closest to the phenyl group to give the substituent the lowest possible number, while the amine defines the parent chain name.\n*   Parent chain: Propane\n*   Amine position: 2 (propan-2-amine)\n*   Substituent: Phenyl group at position 1\n\nTherefore, the IUPAC name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**. This is consistent with literature data for the compound, which is also commonly known as amphetamine.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
