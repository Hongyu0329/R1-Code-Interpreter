    "The molecule shown is a member of a class of compounds known as cycloparaphenyleneethynylenes (CPPEs). These are macrocycles composed of alternating para-phenylene (benzene rings linked at opposite ends) and ethynylene (-Câ‰¡C-) units.\n\nSpecifically, the molecule in the image contains six phenylene units and six ethynylene units. Therefore, it is the hexamer of this series.\n\nThe name of the molecule is **Cycloparaphenylene ethynylene**.\n\n<<<Cycloparaphenylene ethynylene>>>"
