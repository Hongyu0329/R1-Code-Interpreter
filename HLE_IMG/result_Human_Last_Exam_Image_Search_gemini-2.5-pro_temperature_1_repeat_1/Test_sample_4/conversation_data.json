    "The knot depicted in the image is identified as the 9₄₂ knot in the Alexander-Briggs notation. The Jones polynomial, denoted as V(t), for this knot is:\n\n$t^4 - t^3 + t^2 - 2t + 2 - 2t^{-1} + t^{-2} - t^{-3} + t^{-4}$\n\nThis can be rewritten in the requested format as:\n\n$t^4 - t^3 + t^2 - 2t + 2 - 2t^{-1} + t^{-2} - t^{-3} + t^{-4}$\n\nAn interesting characteristic of the 9₄₂ knot is that its Jones polynomial is the same as that of its mirror image, which is not always the case for knots. This means the standard Jones polynomial cannot distinguish the 9₄₂ knot from its reflection. However, more advanced invariants, such as those derived from Chern-Simons theory, are able to detect its chirality.\n\n<<<t^4 - t^3 + t^2 - 2t + 2 - 2t^{-1} + t^{-2} - t^{-3} + t^{-4}>>>"
