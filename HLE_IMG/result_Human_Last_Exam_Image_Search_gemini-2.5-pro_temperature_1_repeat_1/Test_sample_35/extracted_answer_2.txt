Based on the provided information and image, the S100B protein exhibits a strong affinity for the V-domain of the RAGE receptor. It can be utilized as both an adjunct and a prognostic marker. However, given its direct role in driving downstream pathological processes such as neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and neurodegeneration, its utility as a prognostic marker to predict disease severity and progression is more significant.
