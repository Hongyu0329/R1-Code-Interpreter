    "To calculate the total current flowing from the voltage source in the provided circuit, we must first determine the total equivalent resistance of the circuit. The total current can then be found using Ohm's Law.\n\n### Circuit Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the left branch (R1, R2, R3):**\n    *   A wire connects the top of the circuit (positive terminal) to the node between R1 and R2. This creates a path of zero resistance around R1. When both terminals of a resistor are connected to the same point, it is considered short-circuited and can be removed for analysis. Therefore, R1 (3 Ω) is shorted out.\n    *   Similarly, a wire connects the bottom of the circuit (ground) to the node between R2 and R3. This shorts out R3 (9 Ω), as all the current will bypass it through the wire.\n    *   This leaves only resistor R2 (7 Ω) active in this branch, connected directly across the 1V source.\n\n2.  **Analyze the right branch (R7, R8):**\n    *   Resistors R7 (100 Ω) and R8 (100 Ω) are connected in series.\n    *   The total resistance for resistors in series is the sum of their individual resistances.\n    *   Equivalent resistance of the right branch (R_right) = R7 + R8 = 100 Ω + 100 Ω = 200 Ω.\n\n3.  **Analyze the overall circuit:**\n    *   The simplified circuit consists of the resistance from the left branch (R2 = 7 Ω) in parallel with the equivalent resistance of the right branch (R_right = 200 Ω).\n\n### Calculation\n\nThe total current is the sum of the currents flowing through each parallel branch.\n\n1.  **Current through the left branch (I_left):**\n    *   Using Ohm's Law (I = V/R):\n    *   I_left = 1 V / 7 Ω ≈ 0.1429 A\n\n2.  **Current through the right branch (I_right):**\n    *   Using Ohm's Law:\n    *   I_right = 1 V / 200 Ω = 0.005 A\n\n3.  **Total Current (I_total):**\n    *   The total current from the source is the sum of the currents in the parallel branches.\n    *   I_total = I_left + I_right\n    *   I_total = (1/7) A + (1/200) A\n    *   I_total = (200/1400) A + (7/1400) A\n    *   I_total = 207 / 1400 A\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n\n*   I_total ≈ 0.1479 A\n\nThus, the total current flowing through the circuit is approximately 0.1479 Amperes.\n\n<<<0.1479 A>>>"
