    "The two-move checkmate for White is as follows:\n\n**1. Qa8**\n\nThis quiet move places Black in a state of *zugzwang*, where any move leads to a checkmate. The black king and pawns are unable to move. Black must move either their queen or their rook.\n\nHere are the possible responses from Black and the corresponding checkmating move from White:\n\n*   If Black moves the queen to d4 (1... Qd4), White delivers checkmate with **2. Re3#**. This is a double check from the rook and the bishop on g1. The black queen on d4 blocks the king's only escape square.\n*   If the black queen moves to any other square, White checkmates with **2. Nd6#**. The black rook on c6 is pinned by the white queen on a8 and cannot capture the knight.\n*   If the black rook moves along the c-file (e.g., 1... Rc5), White checkmates with **2. Nd6#**. The black queen on d5 is pinned by the white queen on a8.\n*   If the black rook moves along the 6th rank (e.g., 1... Ra6), White checkmates with **2. Nc5#**, as the black queen is pinned.\n\n<<<1. Qa8, 2. Re3# / Nd6# / Nc5#>>>"
