    "The knot in the image is the **(5,3)-torus knot**, also known as the knot `10_124` in the Rolfsen table. For a positive torus knot denoted as T(p,q), the Rasmussen invariant, `s(K)`, can be calculated with the formula `(p-1)(q-1)`.\n\nGiven that the knot is the T(5,3) torus knot, its Rasmussen invariant is:\n\ns(T(5,3)) = (5-1)(3-1) = 4 * 2 = 8\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant `s(K)` is an integer invariant of a knot K derived from Khovanov homology. It provides a lower bound for the slice genus of a knot. For torus knots, the Rasmussen invariant is instrumental in proving the Milnor conjecture, which relates the unknotting number to the genus of the knot. The invariant for the T(5,3) knot, also designated as 10_124, is listed as -8 in the Knot Atlas. This sign difference is due to a different orientation convention. The knot in the image has all positive crossings, leading to a positive Rasmussen invariant.\n\n<<<8>>>"
