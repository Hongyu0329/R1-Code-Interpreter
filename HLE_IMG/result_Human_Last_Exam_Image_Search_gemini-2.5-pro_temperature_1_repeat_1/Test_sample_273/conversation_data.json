    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, each of the three chiral centers must be analyzed using the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules. A chiral center is a carbon atom attached to four different groups. The molecule is interpreted using a standard convention for acyclic molecules where the main carbon backbone is drawn as a zig-zag in the plane of the paper, and wedges and dashes represent substituents pointing out of or into the page, respectively. An implicit hydrogen atom is assumed to be in the opposite position of the drawn substituent.\n\nThe molecule has three chiral centers. Let's label them from left to right as Center 1, Center 2, and Center 3.\n\n### **Center 1: Carbon with the Hydroxyl (-OH) group**\n\n1.  **Identify Substituents and Assign Priorities:**\n    *   **Priority 1:** -OH (Oxygen has the highest atomic number).\n    *   **Priority 2:** The rest of the molecule to the right (-CH(CH₂CH₃)-...). This carbon is bonded to two other carbons.\n    *   **Priority 3:** The methyl group (-CH₃) to the left. This carbon is bonded only to hydrogens.\n    *   **Priority 4:** -H (Hydrogen, implicit).\n\n2.  **Determine Configuration:**\n    *   The hydroxyl group (-OH) is on a wedge (pointing out).\n    *   The bonds to the rest of the chain and the methyl group are in the plane.\n    *   This representation implies the lowest priority group (-H) is on a dash (pointing away).\n    *   Viewing the molecule with the hydrogen atom in the back, the sequence from priority 1 to 2 to 3 (OH → chain → CH₃) traces a **clockwise** direction.\n    *   Therefore, the absolute configuration of Center 1 is **(R)**.\n\n### **Center 2: Carbon with the Ethyl (-CH₂CH₃) group**\n\n1.  **Identify Substituents and Assign Priorities:**\n    *   **Priority 1:** The portion of the chain to the left (-CH(OH)CH₃). The carbon here is bonded to an oxygen, giving it higher priority.\n    *   **Priority 2:** The portion of the chain to the right (-CH(CH₃)CH₂NH₂). This carbon is bonded to other carbons and a nitrogen down the line.\n    *   **Priority 3:** The ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n    *   **Priority 4:** -H (Hydrogen, implicit).\n\n2.  **Determine Configuration:**\n    *   The ethyl group is on a wedge, so the implicit hydrogen is on a dash.\n    *   With the hydrogen in the back, the sequence from priority 1 to 2 to 3 traces a **clockwise** direction.\n    *   Therefore, the absolute configuration of Center 2 is **(R)**.\n\n### **Center 3: Carbon with the Methyl (-CH₃) and Aminomethyl (-CH₂NH₂) groups**\n\n1.  **Identify Substituents and Assign Priorities:**\n    *   **Priority 1:** The aminomethyl group (-CH₂NH₂). The carbon is bonded to a nitrogen, which outranks the carbons of the other groups.\n    *   **Priority 2:** The rest of the molecule to the left (-CH(CH₂CH₃)CH(OH)CH₃).\n    *   **Priority 3:** The methyl group (-CH₃).\n    *   **Priority 4:** -H (Hydrogen, implicit).\n\n2.  **Determine Configuration:**\n    *   The methyl group is on a dash, so the implicit hydrogen is on a wedge (pointing out).\n    *   When the lowest priority group points toward the viewer, the configuration is the reverse of the direction traced by priorities 1, 2, and 3.\n    *   The sequence from priority 1 to 2 to 3 traces a **counter-clockwise** direction.\n    *   Since the hydrogen is in the front, the configuration is reversed to **(R)**.\n\nThus, the absolute configuration for all three chiral centers, from left to right, is (R).\n\n<<<(R,R,R)>>>"
