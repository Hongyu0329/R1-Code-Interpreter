The difference in regioselectivity is due to the structure of the m端nchnone intermediate. In Reactions 1 and 2, the acyclic m端nchnone can undergo a rapid isomerization, likely via a bicyclic cyclopropanone intermediate, that scrambles the positions of the two methyl substituents (from the acetyl and alanine groups). This is proven by the 13C labeling experiment in Reaction 2. This scrambling happens before the regioselective cycloaddition takes place. In Reaction 3, the starting material (N-acetylproline) forms a bicyclic m端nchnone. The fused ring structure prevents this isomerization from occurring. The substituents are locked in place, and the single, stable m端nchnone intermediate reacts with high regioselectivity in the cycloaddition to give only Product B. The results of Reactions 1 and 2 are critical because they reveal the existence of the scrambling mechanism, which explains why the rigid system in Reaction 3 gives a single, non-scrambled product.
