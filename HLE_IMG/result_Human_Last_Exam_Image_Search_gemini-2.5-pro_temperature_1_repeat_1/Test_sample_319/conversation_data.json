    "This phenomenon is an auditory illusion where the brain perceptually \"fills in\" missing portions of a sound when they are replaced by another sound, such as a burst of noise. The image displays a spectrogram (top) and waveform (bottom) of a continuous tone that is interrupted by a brief segment of noise. Under these conditions, a listener is likely to perceive the tone as being uninterrupted and continuing *through* the noise.\n\nThere are two common names for this effect:\n\n*   **Auditory Continuity Illusion:** This is the more general term for when a disconnected sound is perceived as continuous if the gap is filled with another sound, such as noise. This illusion demonstrates the auditory system's tendency to maintain perceptual continuity when faced with sudden changes. The effect is strongest when the interrupting noise is loud enough to plausibly mask the original sound.\n*   **Phonemic Restoration Effect:** This is a specific type of the auditory continuity illusion that applies to speech. In this case, if a phoneme (a basic unit of speech sound) within a word is removed and replaced by a non-speech sound like a cough or a burst of noise, listeners often perceive the word as being complete and may not even notice the missing sound. This effect is a powerful demonstration of how context and prior knowledge influence perception, as the brain actively reconstructs the missing information.\n\nBoth terms describe the same fundamental process of perceptual completion, or \"filling-in,\" which is an unconscious ability of the brain to create a stable and continuous representation of the world from incomplete sensory information.\n\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion>>>"
