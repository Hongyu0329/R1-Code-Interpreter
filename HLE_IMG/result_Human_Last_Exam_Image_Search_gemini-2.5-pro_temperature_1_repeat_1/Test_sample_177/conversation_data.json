    "To determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we first need to calculate a representative VMT for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios. This can be done by calculating a weighted VMT index for each scenario.\n\nThe formula for the VMT index for each scenario is:\nVMT Index = Σ [ (Share of total trips for category *i*) × (Total car mode share for category *i*) × (Average trip distance for category *i*) ]\n\nThe \"Total car mode share\" is the sum of the shares for \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n\n### **Step 1: Calculate the Baseline Car VMT Index**\n\nWe calculate the VMT contribution for each distance category and then sum them up.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total car share = 25% + 28% = 53%\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.48 (share of trips) × 0.53 (car share) × 1 (avg distance) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total car share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.22 × 0.81 × 4 = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total car share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.14 × 0.85 × 7.5 = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total car share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.16 × 0.89 × 20 = 2.8480\n\n**Total Baseline VMT Index** = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n### **Step 2: Calculate the Proposed Car VMT Index**\n\nWe repeat the calculation using the data from Table 2.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total car share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.48 × 0.03 × 1 = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total car share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.22 × 0.27 × 4 = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total car share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.14 × 0.41 × 7.5 = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total car share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   VMT contribution = 0.16 × 0.49 × 20 = 1.5680\n\n**Total Proposed VMT Index** = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\nNow, we calculate the reduction and express it as a percentage of the baseline VMT.\n\n*   **VMT Reduction** = Baseline VMT Index - Proposed VMT Index = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT Index) × 100\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100 ≈ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
