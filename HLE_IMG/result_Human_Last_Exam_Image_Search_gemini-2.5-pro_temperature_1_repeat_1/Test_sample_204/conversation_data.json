    "Based on the visual characteristics of the specimens and their underlying atomic arrangements, the minerals can be identified and ordered by increasing silicate structure complexity.\n\n*   **Specimen C: Olivine.** This mineral is identified by its characteristic olive-green color and granular crystal habit. Olivine is a nesosilicate, meaning its structure consists of isolated silica tetrahedra linked by other metal ions. This represents the simplest silicate structure.\n*   **Specimen A: Tourmaline.** This specimen is a dark, prismatic crystal with a somewhat rounded, triangular cross-section, which is a distinguishing feature of tourmaline. Tourmaline is a cyclosilicate, or ring silicate, where the silica tetrahedra link together to form six-membered rings. This structure is more complex than the isolated tetrahedra of olivine.\n*   **Specimen B: Mica.** The flaky, layered appearance of this greenish mineral is characteristic of the mica group. Micas are phyllosilicates, or sheet silicates. In this structure, each tetrahedron shares three of its four oxygen atoms to form extensive two-dimensional sheets. This represents a higher degree of polymerization than ring silicates.\n*   **Specimen D: Quartz.** This glassy, translucent crystal is identifiable as quartz. Quartz is a tectosilicate, or framework silicate, which has the most complex structure. In a framework silicate, every tetrahedron shares all four of its oxygen atoms with neighboring tetrahedra, creating a strong, three-dimensional network.\n\nThe order of increasing silicate structure complexity is determined by the degree to which the silica tetrahedra are linked together (polymerized). The order from simplest to most complex is isolated tetrahedra, rings, sheets, and finally, frameworks.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of the specimens is:\n**C (Olivine) → A (Tourmaline) → B (Mica) → D (Quartz)**\n\n<<<C, A, B, D>>>"
