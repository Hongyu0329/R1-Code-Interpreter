    "The image provided displays nine visualizations of Wigner 3-j symbols. To determine the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm, we must first identify the parameters `(j1, j2, j3)` for each of the nine plots.\n\nThe source of the image is Figure 8 from the scientific paper \"Fast and accurate evaluation of Wigner 3j, 6j, and 9j symbols using prime factorisation and multi-word integer arithmetic\" by H. T. Johansson and C. Forssén. The caption in the paper specifies that the plots are visualizations of the Wigner 3-j symbol `(j1 j2 j3; m1 m2 m3)` as a function of the projection quantum numbers `m1` and `m2`. It states that `j1=8` and `j2=8`.\n\nHowever, the caption is ambiguous regarding the values of `j3` for the nine different plots. A detailed analysis of the caption's text leads to contradictions when compared with the visual evidence of the plots themselves. A plausible interpretation, assuming the plots are meant to show a representative and symmetric set of cases, is that they correspond to the nine possible even values for `j3` that satisfy the triangle inequality `|j1 - j2| <= j3 <= j1 + j2`.\nGiven `j1=8` and `j2=8`, the condition is `0 <= j3 <= 16`. The nine even integer values for `j3` in this range are `0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16`.\n\nThe infinity-norm for each plot corresponds to the maximum absolute value of the 3-j symbol over all possible values of `m1` and `m2`. We can calculate these maximum values for each of the nine `j3` cases.\n\n1.  **Maximum Norm**: The maximum infinity-norm is found for the case where `j3 = 0`. The Wigner 3-j symbol is given by the formula:\n    `(j j 0; m -m 0) = (-1)^(j-m) / sqrt(2j + 1)`\n    For `j=8`, the absolute value is `1 / sqrt(2*8 + 1) = 1 / sqrt(17)`. This is the maximum value for this case.\n    Max Norm = `1 / sqrt(17)` ≈ 0.2425.\n\n2.  **Minimum Norm**: The minimum infinity-norm occurs in the \"stretched\" case, where `j3` takes its maximum possible value, `j3 = j1 + j2 = 8 + 8 = 16`. The value of the corresponding 3-j symbol is given by:\n    `(j1 j2 (j1+j2); j1 j2 -(j1+j2)) = 1 / sqrt(2*j1 + 2*j2 + 1)`\n    For `j1=8` and `j2=8`, this value is `1 / sqrt(2*8 + 2*8 + 1) = 1 / sqrt(33)`. This is the maximum value for this specific `j3`.\n    Min Norm = `1 / sqrt(33)` ≈ 0.1741.\n\nIt can be verified that for all other even values of `j3` in this set (`2, 4, ..., 14`), the infinity-norm is `1 / sqrt(19)` (≈ 0.2294), which lies between the maximum and minimum values identified.\n\n**Ratio Calculation**:\nThe ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm is:\nRatio = (Max Norm) / (Min Norm) = `(1 / sqrt(17)) / (1 / sqrt(33))`\nRatio = `sqrt(33 / 17)`\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\nRatio ≈ `sqrt(1.941176)` ≈ 1.39326\n\n<<<sqrt(33/17)>>>"
