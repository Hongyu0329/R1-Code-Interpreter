    "Based on the visible snippet, the flag has horizontal stripes of black, white, and red.\n\nThis specific color combination and order was historically used by a few entities:\n*   **The German Empire** (1871-1918) used a black-white-red horizontal tricolor.\n*   **The Republic of Upper Volta** (1959-1984), now known as Burkina Faso, also used this flag.\n\nHowever, in the context of modern country flag quizzes, this image often represents the inverted flag of Yemen. The official flag of Yemen features horizontal stripes of red, white, and black. Flipping it upside down results in the black, white, and red arrangement seen in the image. This is a common trick used in guessing games.\n\nOther Arab nations, like Egypt and Syria, also use a red-white-black tricolor, but their flags include a central emblem (the Eagle of Saladin for Egypt and two green stars for Syria). Since the snippet is from a corner, it could also be one of these, but the flag of Yemen is a simple tricolor with no emblem, making it the most direct match for an inverted flag.\n\nTherefore, the most probable answer is Yemen.\n\n<<<Yemen>>>"
