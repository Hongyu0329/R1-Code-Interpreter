    "The species that definitively indicates this photo was taken on the Atlantic rather than the Pacific Coast is the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*.\n\nThe striped snail in the photograph is the Common Periwinkle. This species is native to the northeastern coasts of the Atlantic Ocean in Europe. It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the mid-19th century and has since become abundant on rocky shores from Labrador, Canada, to New Jersey, USA.\n\nWhile there have been scattered reports and introductions of *Littorina littorea* on the Pacific coast, it has failed to establish widespread, sustained populations there. Therefore, its presence as a common, established organism, as depicted in the photo among other typical intertidal species, is a strong indicator of an Atlantic coastal location.\n\nAlso visible in the photo are Northern Rock Barnacles, likely *Semibalanus balanoides*. This species is common on both the North American Atlantic and Pacific coasts, so it is not a definitive indicator of one coast over the other.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
