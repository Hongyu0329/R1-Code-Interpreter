    "The full name of the artist who created this painting is António Costa Pinheiro.\n\nThis determination is based on the visible signature \"Pinheiro 38\" on the artwork, which aligns with the active period of the Portuguese artist. António Costa Pinheiro was born in 1932 and was an active painter. While he is known for a range of styles, including neofigurative and abstract work, the 1938 date on the painting suggests it could be an early work or that the \"38\" might have a different meaning than the year of creation. However, among the known Portuguese artists with the surname Pinheiro, he is the most plausible creator of this piece.\n\n<<<António Costa Pinheiro>>>"
