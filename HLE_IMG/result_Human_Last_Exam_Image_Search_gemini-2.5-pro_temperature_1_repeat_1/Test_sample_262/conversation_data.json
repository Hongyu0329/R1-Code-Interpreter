    "The lifetimes of iridium(III) complexes in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) are intrinsically linked to their chemical stability under operational conditions. A common degradation pathway for these types of complexes involves the Câ€“F bond, particularly when fluorine atoms are present on the cyclometalating (C^N) ligands.\n\nBased on the provided structures, the four complexes differ in the fluorination pattern of their phenylpyridine (ppy) ligands:\n*   **Complex 1:** Two fluorines on each ppy ligand (2,4-difluoro).\n*   **Complex 2:** One fluorine at the para-position on each ppy ligand (4-fluoro).\n*   **Complex 3:** One fluorine at the ortho-position on each ppy ligand (2-fluoro).\n*   **Complex 4:** No fluorine atoms on the ppy ligands.\n\nWhile fluorination is often used to tune the emission color (typically blue-shifting it) and increase the photoluminescence quantum yield, it can also introduce a pathway for degradation. The C-F bond can be inherently unstable under the electrical bias in an operating LEC, with defluorination being a known degradation mechanism. Some studies have shown that the lifetime of LECs can decrease as the number of fluorine substituents on the emitter increases. This suggests that complexes with more C-F bonds are more susceptible to this degradation pathway, leading to shorter operational lifetimes.\n\nFollowing this trend, the expected order of lifetime would be:\n**Longest lifetime > Shortest lifetime**\nComplex 4 (no F) > Complex 2 (two F atoms total) > Complex 3 (two F atoms total) > Complex 1 (four F atoms total)\n\nTherefore, the complexes with fluorine substituents are expected to have shorter lifetimes than the non-fluorinated analogue. Complex 1, having the highest number of fluorine atoms (four in total), would be expected to have the shortest lifetime, followed by complexes 2 and 3, which each have two fluorine atoms. Consequently, the group of complexes expected to show shorter lifetimes would include 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<K>>>"
