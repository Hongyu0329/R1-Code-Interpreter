    "The presented fragment is from the cover of the book \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\" which is the title of the US edition. The original UK title is \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.\"\n\nThe image shows a unicorn, which is featured on the rear cover of the original US edition illustrated by Mary GrandPr√©. Unicorns are significant creatures in the wizarding world created by J.K. Rowling, and their blood has magical properties. The Gryffindor house, to which Harry Potter belongs, is also associated with the unicorn, symbolizing purity and courage. Various international editions of the book have also depicted unicorns on their covers.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
