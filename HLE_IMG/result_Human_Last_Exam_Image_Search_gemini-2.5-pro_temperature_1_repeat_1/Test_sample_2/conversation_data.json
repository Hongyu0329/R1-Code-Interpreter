    "To determine the time complexity of the given algorithm, we first need to analyze its structure and how the number of operations grows with the input size `n`.\n\nThe provided pseudocode is a recursive function:\n```python\ndef sort(a, n):\n  if n > 1:\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n    if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n      swap(a[n - 1], a[n - 2])\n    sort(a, n - 1)\n```\n\nLet's define T(n) as the time taken by the function `sort(a, n)`.\n\n1.  **Base Case:** If `n` is 1 or less, the function does nothing and returns. This takes a constant amount of time, which we can denote as O(1).\n2.  **Recursive Step:** If `n` is greater than 1, the function performs the following steps:\n    *   It calls itself with `n - 1`. The time taken for this is T(n - 1).\n    *   It performs a comparison and an optional swap. These are constant time operations, O(1).\n    *   It calls itself again with `n - 1`. The time taken for this second call is also T(n - 1).\n\nThis gives us the following recurrence relation for the time complexity:\nT(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + O(1)\nT(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c (where 'c' is a constant)\n\nTo solve this recurrence relation, we can expand it:\n*   T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c\n*   T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c\n*   T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c\n*   ...\n*   T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)\n\nThis can be generalized to:\nT(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)\n\nSince T(1) is a constant, the entire expression is dominated by the `2^(n-1)` term. Therefore, the time complexity is proportional to 2^n. This is an exponential time complexity.\n\nThe algorithm will always terminate because the input size `n` is decreased by 1 at each recursive call until it reaches the base case of `n <= 1`. Therefore, it does not run forever.\n\nBased on this analysis, the worst-case time complexity is O(2^n).\n\nFinal check of the answer choices:\n*   A. O(n) - Incorrect.\n*   B. O(n log n) - Incorrect.\n*   C. O(n^2) - Incorrect.\n*   D. O(n^3) - Incorrect.\n*   E. O(2^n) - Correct.\n*   F. does not terminate - Incorrect.\n\n<<<E>>>"
