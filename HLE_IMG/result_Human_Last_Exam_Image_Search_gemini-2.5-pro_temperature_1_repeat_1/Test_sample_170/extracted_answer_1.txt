The solution to the non-linear optimization problem yields the following results:

*   **Optimal Reactive Power Injection ($Q_{opt}$):** The minimum reactive power required from the MMCC STATCOM to restore the voltage at Bus B to its nominal value is **16.7 MVAR** (0.167 pu).

*   **System Real Power Losses:** Considering the 4% increase due to harmonic distortion, the total real power losses in the system are **0.976 MW** (0.00976 pu).
