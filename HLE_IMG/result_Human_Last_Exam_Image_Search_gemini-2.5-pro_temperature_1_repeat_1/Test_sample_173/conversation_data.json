    "To determine the time signature of the musical measure, we need to count the total value of the notes in the measure. A time signature tells us how many beats are in each measure and what kind of note gets one beat.\n\n**Analysis of the Treble Clef (Top Staff):**\n\n*   The notes in the top staff are primarily sixteenth notes. A sixteenth note gets one-quarter of a beat in time signatures with a 4 on the bottom (like 2/4, 3/4, and 4/4).\n*   The notes are grouped by beams. Each group of four sixteenth notes equals one quarter note (1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 + 1/16 = 4/16 = 1/4).\n*   The measure contains four of these groups:\n    1.  A sixteenth rest followed by three sixteenth notes.\n    2.  Four sixteenth notes.\n    3.  Four sixteenth notes.\n    4.  Four sixteenth notes.\n*   Counting these groups, we have a total of four quarter notes' worth of beats in the treble clef.\n\n**Analysis of the Bass Clef (Bottom Staff):**\n\n*   The bass clef contains a chord written as a whole note.\n*   In common time signatures, a whole note receives four beats.\n\nBoth staves contain notes that add up to four quarter notes. Therefore, the time signature is 4/4, which means there are four quarter notes per measure.\n\nBased on this analysis, the correct answer is C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
