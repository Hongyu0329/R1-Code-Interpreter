    "The correct answer is **Silver Mirror**.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the two clues:\n\n*   **\"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"** The image shows Russian hockey player Andrei Vasilevskiy receiving an award from legendary Soviet goaltender Vladislav Tretiak. The trophy has a highly reflective, spherical top that resembles a silver mirror.\n*   **\"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"** Historically, the production of mirrors involved using a toxic tin-mercury amalgam to create the reflective backing. This process, which produced what could be called a silver mirror, was hazardous due to mercury vapors and was largely replaced in the 19th and early 20th centuries by safer methods, such as using silver nitrate. The use of mercury salts in various applications, including antiseptics and fungicides, has also been widely discontinued due to toxicity.\n\n<<<Silver Mirror>>>"
