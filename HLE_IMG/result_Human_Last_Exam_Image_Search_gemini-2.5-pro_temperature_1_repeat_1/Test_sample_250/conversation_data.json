    "The title of the jazz standard is \"Minor's Holiday,\" and the composer is Kenny Dorham.\n\nThis piece is recognizable by its distinctive A-section chord progression, which features a chromatic descent from the tonic minor chord (Fm7 to Em7b5 to Ebm6). The bridge, or B-section, follows a common harmonic sequence based on the changes from George Gershwin's \"I Got Rhythm,\" beginning on the VI chord of the relative major key. The tune was notably recorded by trumpeter and composer Kenny Dorham with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers.\n\n<<<Minor's Holiday by Kenny Dorham>>>"
