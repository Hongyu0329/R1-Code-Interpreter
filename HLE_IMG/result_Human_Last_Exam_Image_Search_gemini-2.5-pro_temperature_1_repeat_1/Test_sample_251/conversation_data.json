    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip, one must analyze the paper speed and measure the greatest distance between two consecutive R-waves.\n\n**ECG Analysis:**\n*   **Paper Speed:** The strip indicates a speed of 25 mm/sec.\n*   **Grid a:** At this speed, each small 1 mm square on the horizontal axis represents 0.04 seconds.\n*   **Grid b:** Each large 5 mm square represents 0.2 seconds.\n*   **R-wave:** The R-wave is the prominent upward spike in each heartbeat complex. The R-R interval is the time between two successive R-waves.\n\n**Measurement:**\nUpon visual inspection of the entire rhythm strip, the longest pause between heartbeats occurs in the fourth row of the tracing, which starts near the timestamp 0:06:08.\n\nBy counting the squares between the R-wave preceding this pause and the R-wave ending it:\n*   There are 8 full large squares.\n*   There are an additional 3 small squares.\n\n**Calculation:**\nThe total duration can be calculated as follows:\n*   (8 large squares × 0.2 seconds/large square) + (3 small squares × 0.04 seconds/small square) = 1.6 seconds + 0.12 seconds = 1.72 seconds.\n\nAlternatively, converting everything to small squares:\n*   (8 large squares × 5 small squares/large square) + 3 small squares = 43 small squares.\n*   43 small squares × 0.04 seconds/small square = 1.72 seconds.\n\n<<<1.72>>>"
