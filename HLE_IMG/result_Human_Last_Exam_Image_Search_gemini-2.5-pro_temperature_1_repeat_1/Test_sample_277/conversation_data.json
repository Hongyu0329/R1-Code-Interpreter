    "I am sorry, but the image you are referring to is not visible. It appears to be a black square. To determine the relationship between the molecules, I need to see their chemical structures.\n\nPlease provide the image or describe the molecules in question. Once I have that information, I can help you determine if they are constitutional isomers, stereoisomers, conformers, or identical."
