    "The epiphytic species in the image appears to be a type of liverwort, specifically from the genus ***Radula***.\n\nThe dark, intricate, and branching pattern growing flat against the tree bark is characteristic of some thalloid liverworts. Liverworts are non-vascular plants, and many grow as epiphytes on trees. They come in two main forms: leafy and thalloid. The growth in the image resembles a thalloid liverwort, which has a flattened, branching structure.\n\nWhile it could also be mistaken for a type of crustose or fruticose lichen, which also grow on trees, the specific pattern is very similar to images of certain liverworts. For example, species within the *Radula* genus, which are liverworts, can exhibit this type of growth. Specifically, *Radula holtii*, also known as Holt's Scalewort, is noted for its dark appearance and growth habit, though it is often found in very wet, shaded environments. Another possibility could be a species from the genus *Metzgeria*, which are also thalloid liverworts found on tree bark.\n\nWithout microscopic examination, a definitive identification to the species level is difficult. However, based on the visible morphology of a dark, dichotomously branched thallus pressed closely to the bark, the genus *Radula* is a strong candidate.\n\n<<<Radula>>>"
