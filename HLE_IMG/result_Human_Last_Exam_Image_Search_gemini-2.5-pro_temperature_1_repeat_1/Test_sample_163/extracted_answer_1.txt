The two major products, A and B, are regioisomers resulting from the iron-catalyzed oxy-benzoyloxylation of styrene. The tert-butyl peroxybenzoate provides both a *tert*-butoxy group and a benzoyloxy group, which add across the double bond of styrene.

The two products are:

*   **Product A:** 2-tert-butoxy-1-phenylethyl benzoate

*   **Product B:** 1-tert-butoxy-2-benzoyloxy-1-phenylethane (the regioisomer)
      *(A representative structure for the regioisomer, as a direct public source image is not available)*
