    "The epiphytic species in the image is characterized by a black, net-like growth that spreads across the tree bark. This pattern is highly indicative of the rhizomorphs of a fungus belonging to the genus ***Armillaria***, commonly known as honey mushrooms.\n\nRhizomorphs are thread-like structures, similar to roots, that are composed of a dense mass of fungal hyphae. In the case of *Armillaria*, these rhizomorphs are often black and grow in a distinctive fan-like or net-like pattern underneath the bark of trees. This fungus is parasitic and can cause significant damage to the host tree.\n\nWhile some black lichens exist, their growth forms typically do not match the intricate and uniform net-like pattern seen in the photograph. For instance, \"black tree lichen\" (*Bryoria* spp.) has a hair-like, filamentous appearance, and other crustose lichens with dark features do not form this specific reticulated structure. Another possibility could be certain species of the lichen genus *Dictyonema*, some of which have filamentous thalli. However, the visual evidence in the image strongly aligns with the known appearance of *Armillaria* rhizomorphs. Sooty mold, another black fungal growth on trees, is caused by fungi that feed on insect honeydew and generally appears as a powdery or crusty black coating without a defined network pattern.\n\nTherefore, based on the distinct morphological characteristics visible in the image, the genus is most likely *Armillaria*.\n\n<<<Armillaria>>>"
