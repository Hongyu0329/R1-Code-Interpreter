    "Based on the microscopic images provided, the process being depicted is **lateral branch formation in a filamentous fungus**.\n\nThe three panels, labeled L, M, and N, show the stages of how a new hypha (a long, branching filament that is the primary mode of growth for fungi) emerges from the side of an existing one.\n\nHere is a breakdown of what is likely happening in each panel:\n*   **Panel L:** This image displays a mature section of a fungal hypha, which is divided into compartments by cross-walls called septa. The arrowhead points to one of these septa.\n*   **Panel M and N:** The arrowheads in these panels point to the initiation of a new branch. A bulge forms on the side wall of a subapical cell (a cell located behind the growing tip). This is the first visible stage of lateral branching, where the fungal cell machinery is reorganizing to create a new point of growth. This process is fundamental to how fungi develop into a complex, networked mycelium to explore and colonize their environment. The organism shown is likely a model fungus used in research, such as *Aspergillus nidulans*.<<<Lateral branch formation in a filamentous fungus>>>"
