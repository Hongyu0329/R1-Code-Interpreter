    "Based on the highly complex pattern of absorption lines across the visible spectrum, the element shown is **Uranium**.\n\nUranium, particularly in its uranyl(VI) ion (UO₂²⁺) form in solutions, exhibits a very distinctive and complex absorption spectrum in the visible light region. Heavier elements, like uranium, have much more intricate atomic structures than lighter elements such as hydrogen or helium, resulting in a significantly larger number of possible electronic transitions. This complexity leads to the dense and numerous spectral lines seen in the image. The pattern shown, with multiple vibronic bands, is characteristic of uranium and is used for its spectroscopic analysis.\n\n<<<Uranium>>>"
