    "Based on the analysis of the image, the protein depicted is **Tankyrase 2**.\n\nSpecifically, the image shows the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of human Tankyrase 2. Tankyrase 2, also known as TNKS2 or PARP5B, is a member of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) family of enzymes.\n\nKey functions and characteristics of Tankyrase 2 include:\n*   **Cellular Processes:** It is involved in various essential cellular activities, including the Wnt signaling pathway, maintenance of telomere length, and vesicle trafficking.\n*   **Wnt Signaling:** Tankyrase 2 acts as an activator of the Wnt signaling pathway by modifying key components like AXIN1 and AXIN2, which leads to their degradation and stabilization of Î²-catenin.\n*   **Telomere Maintenance:** The protein interacts with the telomeric protein TRF1, playing a role in regulating the length and stability of telomeres.\n*   **Structure:** Tankyrase 2 has a multi-domain structure, which includes an ankyrin repeat domain for protein-protein interactions, a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain involved in polymerization, and a C-terminal PARP catalytic domain. The image provided showcases this catalytic domain.\n\nDue to its role in cellular processes like Wnt signaling, which is often deregulated in cancer, Tankyrase 2 is being investigated as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment. The provided image is often used in scientific literature and databases to represent the structure of this protein, frequently in complex with various inhibitors.\n\n<<<Tankyrase 2>>>"
