    "The plant in the image is most likely *Ficus villosa*, also known as the shaggy-leaf fig or villous fig. This identification is based on the distinctively patterned leaves with sunken venation.\n\nThis climbing fig is not endemic to a single island but has a broader native range across Southeast Asia. It can be found from northeastern India and southern China, south through Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines, to the Indonesian islands of Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Sulawesi, and the Maluku Islands. One source specifically mentions that a variant, *Ficus Villosa* Silver, is an endemic plant from Kalimantan, which is the Indonesian portion of the island of Borneo.\n\n<<<Borneo>>>"
