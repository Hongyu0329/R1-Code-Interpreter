    "Based on the analysis of the provided reaction scheme:\n\n**Reagent A:**\n\nThe transformation from compound **1** to compound **2** involves the replacement of an oxygen atom in the central heterocyclic ring with an N-amino group (-NH₂). This is a characteristic reaction of pyrylium or xanthenylium salts (like structure **1**) with hydrazine. The hydrazine molecule acts as a nitrogen nucleophile, leading to the formation of an N-amino pyridinium or acridinium derivative (structure **2**).\n\n*   Therefore, **Reagent A is Hydrazine (N₂H₄)**.\n\n**Reagent B:**\n\nThe transformation from compound **2** to compound **3** is a more complex reaction involving a cyclization.\n1.  A new six-membered ring is formed at the top of the molecule.\n2.  This new ring incorporates a nitrogen atom substituted with a propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃).\n3.  The formation of this N-propyl group indicates that the reagent must be the source of this group.\n4.  The overall reaction converts the acridinium core of **2** into a pentacyclic quinacridinium core in **3**. This is achieved through a ring-closing reaction on one of the dimethoxy-substituted rings of compound **2**.\n\nThe most plausible reagent to provide the N-propyl group and participate in this type of heterocyclic ring formation is a primary amine.\n\n*   Therefore, **Reagent B is n-Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) or 1-aminopropane**.\n\n<<<A: Hydrazine, B: n-Propylamine>>>"
