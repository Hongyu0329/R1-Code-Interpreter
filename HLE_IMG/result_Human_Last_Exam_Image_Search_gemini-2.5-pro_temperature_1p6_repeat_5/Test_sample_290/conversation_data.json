    "The image provided was taken in Shoreline, Washington, at Richmond Beach Saltwater Park.\n\nThis conclusion is based on the distinct features of the park visible in the photograph. The view is from an upper park area, looking down through a characteristic chain-link fence onto the beach. Richmond Beach Saltwater Park is located in the city of Shoreline, just north of Seattle. It is known for its beautiful sunsets over Puget Sound, multi-level layout with overlooks, and a pedestrian bridge that crosses over railroad tracks to get to the beach. The park offers spectacular views and is a popular spot for beach strolls and picnics. While beach bonfires are a popular activity in the Pacific Northwest, they are generally restricted to designated fire pits in specific parks like Alki and Golden Gardens in Seattle. The presence of a bonfire in the image aligns with the recreational activities common to the area's beaches.\n\n<<<Shoreline, Washington>>>"
