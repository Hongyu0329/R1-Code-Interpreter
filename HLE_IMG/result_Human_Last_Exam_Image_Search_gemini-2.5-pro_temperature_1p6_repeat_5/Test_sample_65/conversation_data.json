    "The bryophyte in the image belongs to the genus *Ptilidium*.\n\nThis is a leafy liverwort, not a moss. Its distinctive appearance comes from its leaves, which are deeply divided into 3-5 portions. The edges of these leaf divisions are fringed with fine, hair-like cilia, giving the plant a feathery or \"flossy\" look and leading to the common name ciliated fringewort. The genus name *Ptilidium* comes from the Greek word *ptilidion*, which means \"small feather,\" referencing this unique leaf structure. The densely packed, overlapping leaves create the characteristic braided or plaited appearance seen in the photograph.\n\n<<<Ptilidium>>>"
