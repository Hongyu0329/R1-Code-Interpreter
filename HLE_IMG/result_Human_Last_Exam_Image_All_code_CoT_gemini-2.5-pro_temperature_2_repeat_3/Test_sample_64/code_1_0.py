This process is a specialized method of cell division that maintains the dikaryotic (n+n) state in growing hyphae. The sequence (L-M-N) depicts the fusion of the small, hook-like 'clamp' cell with the subapical cell, which is indicated by the growing bulge at the septum (arrowhead). This fusion allows a nucleus to be transferred from the clamp back into the subapical cell."
