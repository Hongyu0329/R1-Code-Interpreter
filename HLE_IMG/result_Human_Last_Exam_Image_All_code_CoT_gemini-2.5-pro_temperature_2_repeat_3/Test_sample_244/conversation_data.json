    "My plan to identify the genus of the epiphytic species is as follows:\n1.  I will first carefully examine the provided image and its cropped versions to identify the key morphological characteristics of the organism.\n2.  The organism is growing on the bark of a tree, making it an epiphyte. It has a very distinctive appearance: a dark, blackish, filamentous mat that forms an intricate web or net-like pattern. The structure is appressed to the bark.\n3.  I will use these visual cues to determine the type of organism. The web-like structure composed of dark filaments is characteristic of a specific type of sterile lichen, where the fungal partner's hyphae create a network that envelops the algal photobiont.\n4.  Based on this morphology, the organism can be identified as belonging to the genus *Cystocoleus*. This lichen is commonly known as \"black webbing lichen\" or \"black cobweb lichen,\" which accurately describes its appearance in the photo.\n5.  Finally, I will create a Python script to print this identified genus as the solution.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef identify_genus():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the genus of the black, web-like epiphyte shown in the image.\n    Based on the distinct filamentous and reticulated (net-like) morphology,\n    the organism is a sterile lichen. This growth form is characteristic of\n    the genus Cystocoleus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The genus is identified based on visual characteristics.\n    genus_name = \"Cystocoleus\"\n    \n    # Print the result.\n    print(f\"The genus of the epiphytic species is: {genus_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    identify_genus()\n```\n<<<Cystocoleus>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
