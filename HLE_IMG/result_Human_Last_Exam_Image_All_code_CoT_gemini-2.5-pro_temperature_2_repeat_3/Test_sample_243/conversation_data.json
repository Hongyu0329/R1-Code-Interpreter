    "Based on the unique reticulated vein pattern on the leaves, the plant is identified as *Psydrax vaccinoides*. My plan is to first identify this plant and then use online botanical resources to find the specific location to which it is endemic. Finally, I will write a Python script to print the name of this location.\n\n```python\ndef find_endemic_island():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the plant in the image and finds its endemic location.\n  The plant with dark green leaves and prominent white, web-like veins is Psydrax vaccinoides.\n  This plant is endemic to a specific island.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The name of the island where Psydrax vaccinoides is endemic\n  island_name = \"Socotra\"\n  print(island_name)\n\nfind_endemic_island()\n```\n<<<Socotra>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
