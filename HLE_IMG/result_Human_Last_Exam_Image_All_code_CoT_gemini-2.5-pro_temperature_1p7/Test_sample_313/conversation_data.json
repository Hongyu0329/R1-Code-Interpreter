    "Here is my plan to solve this puzzle:\n1.  **Analyze the image and the first clue:** \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\" I will first identify the person and the context of the event in the image. This will give me potential candidates for the phrase \"X Y\". The man pictured is star hockey player Nikita Kucherov. In 2019, he had a historic season, winning the three most prestigious individual NHL awards: the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (MVP voted by players), and the Art Ross Trophy (leading scorer). This rare accomplishment is widely referred to as a \"hat trick\" of awards. This makes \"Hat Trick\" a strong candidate for \"X Y\".\n2.  **Analyze the second clue:** \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\" This is a riddle. I need to find a two-word phrase \"X Y\" that fits this description.\n3.  **Connect the two clues:** The most famous use of mercury salts that has now ceased is in the manufacturing of felt hats. The process, known as \"carroting,\" used mercury nitrate and was notoriously toxic, leading to the expression \"mad as a hatter.\"\n4.  **Synthesize the solution:** The phrase \"Hat Trick\" connects both clues.\n    *   It describes the achievement of the person pictured (the first \"X Y\").\n    *   The word \"hat\" within \"Hat Trick\" points to the historical use of mercury in making felt hats (the \"another X Y\" or a different context for the term).\nThe phrase \"Hat Trick\" is the answer that links the hockey achievement to the history of mercury poisoning in hatters. I will write a Python script to print out this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves the puzzle by identifying the two-word phrase 'X Y'\n    that connects the image context with the riddle.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The person in the image is Nikita Kucherov, a hockey player.\n    # In 2019, he won three major awards, an achievement called a \"hat trick\".\n    # This provides the first context for \"X Y\".\n    first_word = \"Hat\"\n    second_word = \"Trick\"\n    achievement = f\"{first_word} {second_word}\"\n\n    # The riddle describes something made with toxic mercury salts.\n    # This refers to old felt hats, connecting to the \"hat\" in \"hat trick\".\n    riddle_subject = \"felt hats\"\n    toxic_substance = \"mercury salts\"\n\n    # The solution is the phrase that connects both clues.\n    solution = achievement\n\n    print(f\"The image context points to a '{achievement}'.\")\n    print(f\"The riddle about '{toxic_substance}' points to the process of making {riddle_subject}.\")\n    print(\"The connecting phrase, 'X Y', is 'Hat Trick'.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the final answer:\")\n    print(f\"The first word of the answer is: {first_word}\")\n    print(f\"The second word of the answer is: {second_word}\")\n\nsolve_puzzle()\n<<<Hat Trick>>>\n```"
