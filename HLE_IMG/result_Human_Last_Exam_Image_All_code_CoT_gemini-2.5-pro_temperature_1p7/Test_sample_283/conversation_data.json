    "Based on the analysis of the Google Trends graph, the country can be identified by the dates of the recurring peaks in search interest, which correspond to major national holidays and anniversaries.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Red Line:** This line shows a distinct peak every year around late January or early February. This pattern strongly corresponds to **Black History Month**, which is observed annually in February in the United States.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Blue Line:** This line shows a consistent, smaller peak every year in late May. This timing perfectly matches **Memorial Day**, a US federal holiday observed on the last Monday of May to honor military personnel who have died in service.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Yellow Line:** This line is more complex but shows consistent peaks in late August/early September each year. This timing aligns with the anniversary of the **March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom** (August 28, 1963), where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech. The very large peaks in June of 2022 and 2023 likely correspond to other major events or anniversaries that renewed interest in civil rights history, such as the new federal observance of Juneteenth (June 19th).\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The combination of these three specific timelines—Black History Month (February), Memorial Day (May), and a major Civil Rights anniversary (August)—are uniquely characteristic of the United States' calendar of historical remembrances. To a historian, this pattern would clearly point to one country.\n\n```python\ndef solve_country_mystery():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the patterns in the Google Trends graph to identify the country.\n    \n    1.
