    "This task requires a step-by-step music theory analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for the specified measure. Here is the plan:\n\n1.  **Establish Context**: Identify the key signature and location in the piece. The sonata is in C minor. We need to analyze the chord in measure 30.\n2.  **Identify Notes**: Determine the specific notes played in measure 30 and the measure it resolves to, measure 31.\n    *   Measure 30: The main harmony consists of the notes C#, E (natural), and G#. This forms a C-sharp minor triad.\n    *   Measure 31: The chord is D, F, and A, which is a D minor triad.\n3.  **Functional Analysis**: Analyze the relationship between these two chords within the home key of C minor.\n    *   The chord in measure 31 (D minor) is built on the second scale degree of C minor, making it the **ii** chord.\n    *   The chord in measure 30 (C# minor) leads directly to the **ii** chord. Therefore, it functions as a secondary or \"applied\" chord.\n4.  **Determine Roman Numeral**: Construct the Roman numeral based on this function.\n    *   The root of the C# minor chord is C#, which is the leading tone to D (the root of the **ii** chord).\n    *   A chord built on the leading tone is represented by the Roman numeral **vii**. Since it is applied to **ii**, it is a \"vii of ii\".\n    *   Typically, a leading-tone triad is diminished (vii째). Beethoven alters it to minor (C#-E-G# instead of C#-E-G) for expressive purposes, but its function remains that of a leading-tone chord.\n    *   The final Roman numeral combines these elements: **vii째/ii**.\n\nThe following Python code will print this step-by-step analysis and provide the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef analyze_beethoven_chord():\n    \"\"\"\n    Provides a music theory analysis of the chord in measure 30\n    of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" Sonata, 1st movement, and prints\n    the correct Roman numeral.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if sys.stdout.encoding != 'utf-8':\n        sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8')\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identifying the musical context.\")\n    print(\"The piece is Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8, 'Pathetique'.\")\n    print(\"The first movement is in the key of C minor.\")\n    print(\"We are analyzing the chord in measure 30.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Identifying the notes and chords.\")\n    print(\"The chord in measure 30 is composed of the notes C-sharp, E-natural, and G-sharp.
