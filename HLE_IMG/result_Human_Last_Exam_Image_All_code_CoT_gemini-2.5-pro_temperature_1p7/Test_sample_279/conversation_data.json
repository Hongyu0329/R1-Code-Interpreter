    "To determine the caries classification for the lesion in the image, I will follow these steps:\n1.  **Analyze the image:** I will examine the provided image of the tooth to identify the location of the carious lesion. The lesion appears on the biting surface of a posterior tooth.\n2.  **Apply a standard classification system:** I will use the most common system for classifying cavities, G.V. Black's classification, which categorizes lesions based on their location on the tooth surface.\n3.  **Determine the classification:** Based on the location identified in step 1, I will match it to the corresponding class in G.V. Black's system and provide the result. The lesion is in the pits and fissures of the occlusal surface, which corresponds to a specific class.\n\n```python\ndef classify_caries():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the location of a dental lesion and classifies it\n    using G.V.
