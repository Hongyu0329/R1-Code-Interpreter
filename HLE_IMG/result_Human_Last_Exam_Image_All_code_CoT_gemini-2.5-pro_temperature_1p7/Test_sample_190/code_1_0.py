    """
    Analyzes different strategies to improve a biased HMM for media processing
    and identifies the most cost-effective option.

    The problem: The provided HMM is heavily biased towards audio processing,
    as seen in the initial state probabilities (Ï€) and the emission probabilities
    within states (e.g., setAudioSource: 0.82 vs. setVideoSource: 0.17). This
    imbalance leads to poor recommendation accuracy for video processing functions.

    The goal: Find the MOST COST-EFFECTIVE solution. This requires balancing
    implementation cost (time, resources, complexity) with effectiveness.
