    "Based on my analysis, the runestone fragment shown in the image can be identified by its unique characteristics.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Clues:** The prompt states this is an \"Ingvar runestone\". The image displays a very distinctive style of runic inscription arranged in a grid. This grid is a form of cryptic runes, known as *lönnrunor* in Old Norse.\n2.  **Identify the Runestone:** Combining these clues—an Ingvar runestone with a cryptic grid cipher—points to a specific artifact. This inscription is from the famous **Sö 320** runestone fragment, which was found in Åsa, Södermanland, Sweden. The \"Sö\" is the code for the province of Södermanland, and \"320\" is its number in the official catalogue, *Sveriges runinskrifter*.\n3.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script to present this identification. To comply with the instruction to \"output each number\", the code will explicitly define the numerical part of the ID before printing the complete designation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_runestone_id():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Ingvar runestone from the provided image\n    and prints its official catalog ID.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The runestone is identified as Sö 320 from Södermanland, Sweden.\n    # It is a famous Ingvar runestone known for its cryptic grid cipher.\n\n    province_code = \"Sö\"\n    \n    # The number associated with this runestone in the catalog.\n    # The individual numbers that make up the ID are 3, 2, and 0.\n    stone_number = 320\n\n    # The final ID is a combination of the province code and the number.\n    final_id = f\"{province_code} {stone_number}\"\n    \n    print(f\"The ID of the Ingvar runestone depicted is: {final_id}\")\n\nsolve_runestone_id()\n```\n<<<Sö 320>>>"
