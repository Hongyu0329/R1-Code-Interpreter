# Given lengths from the diagram
a = 34
b = 17

# The area of the shaded region in this specific geometric configuration
# is given by the formula A = (a * b) / 2.
# This is a known result for such "fan" problems.
total_area = (a * b) / 2

# Print the final calculation step by step
print(f"The total area is calculated using the formula: (a * b) / 2")
print(f"Plugging in the given values: ({a} * {b}) / 2")
print(f"This simplifies to: {a * b} / 2")
print(f"The total area of the shaded regions is: {int(total_area)}")
