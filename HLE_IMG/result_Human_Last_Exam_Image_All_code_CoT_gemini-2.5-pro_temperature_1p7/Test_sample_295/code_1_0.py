    Analyzes the connectivity patterns of the PGp brain area based on the provided image
    and determines the correct answer from the given choices.

    The image contains five polar plots for different Inferior Parietal Lobule (IPL) areas.
    The task is to identify the areas most strongly connected to the PGp area.

    1. Locate the polar plot for 'PGp' (bottom right).
    2. Identify the longest wedges, which indicate the strongest connections. These are the
       connections that extend furthest from the center and well beyond the black circle.
    3. The PGp plot shows three very prominent connections in the 'Insula' region.
    4. By tracing the axes of these connections, we identify them as:
       - Id1 (Insular area)
       - Ig1 (Insular area)
       - Ig2 (Insular area)
    5. Match this set of three areas with the provided answer choices.
