def solve_nanotube_plots():
    """
    This function determines the chiral index 'm' for each of the nine plots
    based on the physical properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes.

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  Determine the metallicity of each (4, m) nanotube (for m=0,1,2,3,4).
    2.  Identify the oscillator strength plots (colored) based on nanotube type:
        - (4,0) is semiconducting, zigzag -> Plot #2 (horizontal lines, misses K)
        - (4,1) is metallic, chiral -> Plot #4 (tilted lines, through K)
        - (4,2) is semiconducting, chiral -> Plot #6 (less tilted lines, misses K)
        - (4,3) is semiconducting, chiral -> Plot #8 (more tilted lines, misses K)
        - (4,4) is metallic, armchair -> Plot is missing.
    3.  Identify the band structure plots (black/white) based on metallicity and band gap:
        - Metallic tubes (zero gap): (4,4) is armchair (Plot #1, linear dispersion), (4,1) is chiral (Plot #7).
        - Semiconducting tubes (non-zero gap): Identified by gap size (Gap(4,0)>Gap(4,2)>Gap(4,3)).
            - (4,0) has the largest gap -> Plot #9.
            - (4,3) has the smallest gap (and most bands) -> Plot #5.
            - (4,2) is the intermediate case -> Plot #3.
    4.  Assemble the sequence of 'm' values.
