    This function simulates the corrected shader logic to identify the image.
    The logic is as follows:
    1. The `dist` function is interpreted as a binary check creating a shape.
       It returns 0 if a pixel's grid cell is a neighbor of a feature point's
       grid cell, and a large value otherwise. This creates blocky shapes.
    2. The `.x` swizzle in the `COLOR` assignment is treated as a typo,
       enabling the chromatic aberration effect.
