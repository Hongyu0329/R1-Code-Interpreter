# The user wants to identify the opera from a provided musical score.
#
# Based on analysis of the score:
# - The language is German (e.g., "Vorhang" for "Curtain", "mit DÃ¤mpfer" for "with mute").
# - The musical style is atonal, characteristic of the early 20th century.
# - The marking "(Vorhang)" corresponds to the curtain rising on Act II.
#
# These clues strongly point to the opera "Wozzeck" by the Austrian composer Alban Berg.
# This script will print the identified name of the opera.
