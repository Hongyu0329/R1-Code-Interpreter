    "This task requires identifying an opera from its musical score. The process doesn't involve calculation but rather analysis of the provided image.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  **Analyze the Sheet Music:** I'll examine the details in the score, such as the instrumentation, musical style, and any text present.\n2.  **Identify Key Clues:** The instrument names are in German (`gr. Fl.` for Grosse Flöte, `Hob.` for Oboe, `Br.` for Bratsche). There are also German performance directions, most notably `(Vorhang)`, which means \"(Curtain)\" and indicates the beginning of a scene or act. The prompt specifies this is the opening of the second act.\n3.  **Characterize the Music:** The music itself is highly chromatic and appears atonal, which points towards composers of the early 20th century, specifically the Second Viennese School.\n4.  **Deduce the Opera:** Combining these clues—German origin, early 20th-century atonal style, and the specific score for the opening of Act 2—leads to a specific opera. A search for these features confirms that this is the opening of Act 2 of Alban Berg's opera *Wozzeck*.\n5.  **Provide the Answer via Code:** As requested, I will provide a simple Python script to print the name of the opera.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to identify the opera from a provided musical score.\n#\n# Based on analysis of the score:\n# - The language is German (e.g., \"Vorhang\" for \"Curtain\", \"mit Dämpfer\" for \"with mute\").\n# - The musical style is atonal, characteristic of the early 20th century.\n# - The marking \"(Vorhang)\" corresponds to the curtain rising on Act II.\n#\n# These clues strongly point to the opera \"Wozzeck\" by the Austrian composer Alban Berg.\n# This script will print the identified name of the opera.\n\ndef identify_opera():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the name of the opera based on the visual evidence.\n    \"\"\"\n    opera_name = \"Wozzeck\"\n    print(f\"The sheet music is from the beginning of Act II of the opera: {opera_name}\")\n\nidentify_opera()\n```\n<<<Wozzeck>>>"
