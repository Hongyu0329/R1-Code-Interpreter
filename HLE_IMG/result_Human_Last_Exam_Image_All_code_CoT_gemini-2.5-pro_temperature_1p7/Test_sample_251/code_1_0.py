# Plan:
# 1. Define the paper speed from the ECG which is 25 mm/sec.
# 2. Define the size of a small square, which is 1 mm.
# 3. Calculate the time it takes for the stylus to cross one small square.
# 4. Count the number of small squares in the longest R-R interval identified from the ECG strip.
# 5. Calculate the total duration of the longest R-R interval in seconds.
# 6. Print the calculation steps and the final result.

# Step 1-3: Define constants and calculate time per small square.
paper_speed_mm_per_sec = 25
small_square_mm = 1
time_per_small_square_s = small_square_mm / paper_speed_mm_per_sec

# Step 4: Count the squares in the longest interval.
# The longest R-R interval is found to be 7 large squares and 3 small squares.
# Since 1 large square = 5 small squares, this is (7 * 5) + 3 = 38 small squares.
num_small_squares_in_longest_interval = 38

# Step 5: Calculate the final R-R interval time in seconds.
longest_rr_interval_s = num_small_squares_in_longest_interval * time_per_small_square_s

# Step 6: Print the explanation and the result.
print("To find the longest R-R interval in seconds:")
print("1. The paper speed is 25 mm/sec, and each small square on the grid is 1 mm.")
print(f"2. The time for one small square is 1 mm / {paper_speed_mm_per_sec} mm/sec = {time_per_small_square_s:.2f} seconds.")
print(f"3. The longest R-R interval on the strip spans {num_small_squares_in_longest_interval} small squares.")
print("4. Therefore, the duration of the longest R-R interval is calculated as:")
print(f"{num_small_squares_in_longest_interval} squares * {time_per_small_square_s:.2f} s/square = {longest_rr_interval_s:.2f} seconds")
