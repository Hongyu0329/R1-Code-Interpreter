    Analyzes the necklace colorings to determine the symmetry group and prints its minimal generators.

    The analysis reveals two fundamental operations that define the equivalence between colorings:

    1. Rotational Symmetry: In any given row, some colorings are simple rotations of others.
       For instance, in the first row, the third necklace is the first necklace rotated by 60 degrees.
       The fifth is the first rotated by 120 degrees. This implies that rotation is a symmetry operation.
       For a 6-bead necklace, the minimal rotation is 360 / 6 = 60 degrees.

    2. Color Swap Symmetry: Purely geometric symmetries are insufficient. A reflection across the
       vertical axis would map the pattern of Row 2 (beads at positions 1 and 3) to the pattern of
       Row 4 (beads at positions 1 and 5). Since they are presented as different equivalence classes,
       simple reflection is not a symmetry.
       However, within Row 1, the second necklace can be obtained from the first by rotating it
       60 degrees clockwise and then swapping the two colors (Blue and Green).
       This indicates that an operation combining rotation and color swapping is a valid symmetry.
       If both rotation `r` and color-swapped rotation `cr` map a coloring to an equivalent one,
       it implies that the color swap `c` itself must be a generator of the symmetry group.

    Conclusion: The group of symmetries is the direct product of the cyclic group C6 (rotations)
    and the cyclic group C2 (color swap), denoted as C6 x C2. Its minimal generators are a
    single rotation and a single color swap.
