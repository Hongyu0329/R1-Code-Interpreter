# This script derives and prints the formula for the cylinder's height 'h'.
# The derivation steps are outlined in the text above.

# The final derived relation is: h / (2 * r * theta) = cot(theta)
# Solving for h gives: h = 2 * r * theta * cot(theta)

# We will now print this final formula. The problem asks to ensure
# that any numbers in the final equation are explicitly outputted.
# The number in our formula is 2.
