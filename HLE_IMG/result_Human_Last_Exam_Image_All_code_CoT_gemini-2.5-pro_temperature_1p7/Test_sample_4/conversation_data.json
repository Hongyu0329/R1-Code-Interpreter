    "This knot is the 9_42 knot in the Rolfsen knot table. It is a non-alternating knot with 9 crossings. I will provide a Python script to print its Jones polynomial in the standard `V(t)` normalization.\n\nThe Jones polynomial for the 9_42 knot is:\n$V(t) = t - 1 + t^{-1} - 2t^{-2} + 2t^{-3} - 2t^{-4} + 2t^{-5} - t^{-6} + t^{-7}$\n\nThe plan for the code is as follows:\n1.  Represent the polynomial's terms (coefficients and powers) in a dictionary.\n2.  Sort the terms by power in descending order.\n3.  Iterate through the sorted terms and build the output string.\n4.  Handle formatting rules for signs, coefficients of 1, and powers of 0 and 1.\n5.  Print the final formatted polynomial string.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef format_jones_polynomial(poly_dict):\n    \"\"\"\n    Formats a dictionary of polynomial terms into a human-readable string.\n    The dictionary keys are the powers and values are the coefficients.\n    The output is ordered by decreasing power.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Sort the polynomial terms by power in descending order\n    sorted_terms = sorted(poly_dict.items(), key=lambda item: item[0], reverse=True)\n    \n    # Filter out terms with zero coefficients\n    sorted_terms = [term for term in sorted_terms if term[1] != 0]\n\n    if not sorted_terms:\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n\n    result_parts = []\n    \n    # Process the first term separately to handle the leading sign\n    first_power, first_coeff = sorted_terms[0]\n    \n    # Coefficient part\n    coeff_str = \"\"\n    if abs(first_coeff) != 1 or first_power == 0:\n        coeff_str = str(abs(first_coeff))\n    \n    if first_coeff < 0:\n        coeff_str = \"-\" + coeff_str\n\n    # Variable part\n    var_str = \"\"\n    if first_power != 0:\n        if first_power == 1:\n            var_str = \"t\"\n        else:\n            var_str = f\"t^{{{first_power}}}\"\n\n    result_parts.append(coeff_str + var_str)\n    \n    # Process the remaining terms\n    for power, coeff in sorted_terms[1:]:\n        # Sign part\n        sign_str = \" + \" if coeff > 0 else \" - \"\n        \n        # Coefficient part\n        coeff_str = \"\"\n        if abs(coeff) != 1 or power == 0:\n            coeff_str = str(abs(coeff))\n        \n        # Variable part\n        var_str = \"\"\n        if power != 0:\n            if power == 1:\n                var_str = \"t\"\n            else:\n                var_str = f\"t^{{{power}}}\"\n\n        result_parts.append(sign_str + coeff_str + var_str)\n\n    # Join all parts and format curly braces for exponents\n    final_string = \"\".join(result_parts).replace(\"^{\", \"^\").replace(\"}\", \"\")\n    print(final_string)\n\n# The Jones polynomial for the 9_42 knot\n# V(t) = t - 1 + t^{-1} - 2t^{-2} + 2t^{-3} - 2t^{-4} + 2t^{-5} - t^{-6} + t^{-7}\njones_poly = {\n    1: 1,\n    0: -1,\n    -1: 1,\n    -2: -2,\n    -3: 2,\n    -4: -2,\n    -5: 2,\n    -6: -1,\n    -7: 1\n}\n\nformat_jones_polynomial(jones_poly)\n```\n<<<t - 1 + t^-1 - 2t^-2 + 2t^-3 - 2t^-4 + 2t^-5 - t^-6 + t^-7>>>"
