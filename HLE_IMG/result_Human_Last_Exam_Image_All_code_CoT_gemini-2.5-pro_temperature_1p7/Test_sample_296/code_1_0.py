    This function solves the visual riddle to identify a Russian idiom.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The first drawing (in red) depicts a literal interpretation: someone is
       "shattering" ("крушить") the "foundations" ("устои").
    2. The second drawing (in color) depicts the figurative meaning: a radical
       change where the new (taxi) replaces the old (horse-drawn carriage),
       thus breaking the established order.
    3. The idiom that fits both drawings is "Крушить устои".
