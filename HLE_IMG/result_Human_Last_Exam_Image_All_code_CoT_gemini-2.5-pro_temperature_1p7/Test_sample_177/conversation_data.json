    "Here is a step-by-step plan to calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT:\n\n1.  **Define Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT):** VMT is the total miles traveled by vehicles. For this problem, we need to calculate the VMT for cars in both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios.\n2.  **Calculate Total Car VMT for Each Scenario:** We'll calculate a relative VMT for each scenario. For each distance category, the VMT contribution is calculated by multiplying three factors:\n    *   The share of total trips for that distance category.\n    *   The total mode share for cars (sum of 'car, 1 occupant' and 'car, with more than 2 occupants') in that category.\n    *   The average trip distance for that category.\n    We will sum the VMT contributions from all four distance categories to get the total relative VMT for each scenario.\n3.  **Calculate the Percentage Reduction:** Once we have the total VMT for the Baseline (`VMT_baseline`) and Proposed (`VMT_proposed`) scenarios, we will use the following formula to find the percentage reduction:\n    `Percentage Reduction = ((VMT_baseline - VMT_proposed) / VMT_baseline) * 100`\n\nLet's execute this plan using Python.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef calculate_vmt_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage reduction in Car VMT based on the provided data tables.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data from the tables\n    # Common data for both scenarios\n    share_of_total_trips = [0.48, 0.22, 0.14, 0.16]\n    average_trip_distance = [1, 4, 7.5, 20]\n    distance_categories = [\"0-3 miles\", \"3-5 miles\", \"5-10 miles\", \"10+ miles\"]\n\n    # Baseline scenario data\n    baseline_car1_share = [0.25, 0.38, 0.40, 0.42]\n    baseline_carpool_share = [0.28, 0.43, 0.45, 0.47]\n\n    # Proposed scenario data\n    proposed_car1_share = [0.01, 0.08, 0.14, 0.16]\n    proposed_carpool_share = [0.02, 0.19, 0.27, 0.33]\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate Baseline VMT ---\n    baseline_vmt = 0\n    print(\"Calculating Baseline Car VMT:\")\n    for i in range(len(distance_categories)):\n        total_car_share = baseline_car1_share[i] + baseline_carpool_share[i]\n        vmt_contribution = share_of_total_trips[i] * average_trip_distance[i] * total_car_share\n        baseline_vmt += vmt_contribution\n        print(f\"  - Category '{distance_categories[i]}': {share_of_total_trips[i]:.2f} (trip share) * {average_trip_distance[i]:.1f} (miles) * ({baseline_car1_share[i]:.2f} + {baseline_carpool_share[i]:.2f}) (car share) = {vmt_contribution:.4f}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nTotal Baseline Relative Car VMT = {baseline_vmt:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate Proposed VMT ---\n    proposed_vmt = 0\n    print(\"Calculating Proposed Car VMT:\")\n    for i in range(len(distance_categories)):\n        total_car_share = proposed_car1_share[i] + proposed_carpool_share[i]\n        vmt_contribution = share_of_total_trips[i] * average_trip_distance[i] * total_car_share\n        proposed_vmt += vmt_contribution\n        print(f\"  - Category '{distance_categories[i]}': {share_of_total_trips[i]:.2f} (trip share) * {average_trip_distance[i]:.1f} (miles) * ({proposed_car1_share[i]:.2f} + {proposed_carpool_share[i]:.2f}) (car share) = {vmt_contribution:.4f}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nTotal Proposed Relative Car VMT = {proposed_vmt:.4f}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate Percentage Reduction ---\n    if baseline_vmt == 0:\n        reduction_percentage = 0\n    else:\n        reduction_percentage = ((baseline_vmt - proposed_vmt) / baseline_vmt) * 100\n    \n    print(\"Calculating Percentage Reduction:\")\n    print(f\"Formula: ((Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT) / Baseline VMT) * 100\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: (({baseline_vmt:.4f} - {proposed_vmt:.4f}) / {baseline_vmt:.4f}) * 100 = {reduction_percentage:.1f}%\")\n    \n    # Return the final numerical answer for the platform\n    return reduction_percentage\n\n# Run the calculation and store the final answer\nfinal_answer = calculate_vmt_reduction()\n# The final answer format is handled outside the function for clarity.\n# <<<52.2>>>\n```"
