    "Of course, here is the answer to your question.\n\nThe main difference lies in the seta, which is the stalk that supports the spore-containing capsule. The Python code below will print a detailed explanation of this key difference.\n\n```python\ndef print_moss_difference():\n  \"\"\"\n  Explains the main difference in the sporophyte between Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta.\n  \"\"\"\n  main_point = \"The key distinguishing feature between the sporophytes of Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule).\"\n  g_montana = \"In Grimmia montana, the seta is very short and straight. This results in the capsule being held erect and either immersed within or just barely emergent from the leaves.\"\n  g_curviseta = \"In contrast, Grimmia curviseta, as its name suggests (curvi-seta meaning 'curved stalk'), has a longer and conspicuously curved or S-shaped seta. This causes the capsule to be cernuous (nodding or hanging).\"\n  conclusion = \"Therefore, at a glance, you can distinguish them by the orientation of the capsule: erect and almost stalkless in G. montana versus nodding on a curved stalk in G. curviseta.\"\n\n  print(main_point)\n  print(\"\\n- Grimmia montana:\")\n  print(f\"  {g_montana}\")\n  print(\"\\n- Grimmia curviseta:\")\n  print(f\"  {g_curviseta}\")\n  print(f\"\\n{conclusion}\")\n\nprint_moss_difference()\n```\n<<<The main difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). *Grimmia montana* has a very short, straight seta, which holds the capsule erect and close to the leaves.
