The main difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). *Grimmia montana* has a very short, straight seta, which holds the capsule erect and close to the leaves. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a longer, distinctly curved seta, causing its capsule to nod or hang downwards.
