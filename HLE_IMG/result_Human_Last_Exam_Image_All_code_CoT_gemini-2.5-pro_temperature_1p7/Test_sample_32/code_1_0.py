  main_point = "The key distinguishing feature between the sporophytes of Grimmia montana and Grimmia curviseta is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule)."
  g_montana = "In Grimmia montana, the seta is very short and straight. This results in the capsule being held erect and either immersed within or just barely emergent from the leaves."
  g_curviseta = "In contrast, Grimmia curviseta, as its name suggests (curvi-seta meaning 'curved stalk'), has a longer and conspicuously curved or S-shaped seta. This causes the capsule to be cernuous (nodding or hanging)."
