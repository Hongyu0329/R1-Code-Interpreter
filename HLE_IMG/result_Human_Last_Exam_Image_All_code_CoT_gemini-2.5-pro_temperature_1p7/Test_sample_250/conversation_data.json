    "Based on the melody and chord progression provided in the sheet music, I can identify the jazz standard. The piece is in the key of F minor. The characteristic descending chord progression in the first few bars (Fm, Em7b5, Eâ™­6...) and the melodic contour are signatures of a well-known composition.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that will print the title and composer of this piece.\n\n```python\ndef identify_jazz_standard():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the title and composer of the jazz standard from the provided sheet music.\n    \"\"\"\n    title = \"Nica's Dream\"\n    composer = \"Horace Silver\"\n    \n    print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n    print(f\"Composer: {composer}\")\n\nidentify_jazz_standard()\n```\n<<<Title: Nica's Dream\nComposer: Horace Silver>>>"
