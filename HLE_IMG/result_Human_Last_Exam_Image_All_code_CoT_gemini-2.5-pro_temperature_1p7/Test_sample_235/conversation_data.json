    "To determine the metric pattern of the erasure poem, I will write a Python script that programmatically analyzes its structure.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Extract Text**: First, I'll consolidate the words from the image into a single line of text: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\".\n2.  **Syllable and Stress Analysis**: I will use the `pronouncing` library in Python, which utilizes the Carnegie Mellon University Pronouncing Dictionary. This library can determine the number of syllables and the stress pattern (which syllables are stressed vs. unstressed) for each word.\n3.  **Calculate Totals**: The script will then calculate the total number of syllables for the entire line and construct the complete stress pattern. The \"final equation\" for the syllable count will be displayed.\n4.  **Evaluate Patterns**: Finally, the script will systematically compare the poem's total syllables and stress pattern against the definitions of the metric forms provided in the answer choices (Iambic Pentameter, Alexandrine, Sapphic, etc.).\n5.  **Conclusion**: The script will print its analysis for each option and conclude which metric pattern the poem follows.\n\nThis approach provides a data-driven and replicable method for poetic scansion. You will need to install the `pronouncing` library to run the code: `pip install pronouncing`.\n\n```python\nimport re\ntry:\n    import pronouncing\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Please install the 'pronouncing' library to run this script: pip install pronouncing\")\n    exit()\n\ndef analyze_poem_meter():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the metric pattern of the given erasure poem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
