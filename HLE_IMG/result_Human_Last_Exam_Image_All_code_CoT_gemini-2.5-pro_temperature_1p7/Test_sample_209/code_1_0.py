    This function identifies the correct giraffe image.

    The analysis involves comparing the unique spot patterns of the target giraffe
    with the options provided. The pattern on a giraffe's coat is like a fingerprint.

    1. Target Analysis: A key pattern on the shoulder consists of a large top spot,
       two smaller spots below it, and an elongated spot underneath those.
    2. Comparison:
       - A & C: Incorrect color and pattern.
       - D & F: Incorrect patterns.
       - E: Close, but the shoulder pattern doesn't quite match.
       - B: The shoulder pattern is a perfect match to the target.

    The correct answer is B.
