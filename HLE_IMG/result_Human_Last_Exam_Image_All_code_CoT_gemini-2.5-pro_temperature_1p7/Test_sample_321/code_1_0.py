    # Initialize the solution array for the 9 plots.
    # p[i] will store the parameter ID for plot (i+1).
    p = [0] * 9

    # Step 1: Identify quarantine-related plots (4 and 7).
    # These plots show curves that are identical until the quarantine start date.
    # Plot 4: Decreasing function (S(t)), shows varying kink duration. This matches q_l.
    p[3] = 14  # Plot 4 is q_l
    # Plot 7: Increasing function (C_l(t)), shows varying slope during the kink. This matches q_f.
    p[6] = 15  # Plot 7 is q_f

    # Step 2: Identify the plot primarily affecting epidemic timing (2).
    # Plot 2: Decreasing function (S(t)), curves have different timing but converge to a similar final value.
    # This is the characteristic signature of varying the incubation period, a_i.
    p[1] = 5   # Plot 2 is a_i

    # Step 3: Identify plots with unique cost curve (C_l) behaviors (5 and 9).
    # Plot 9: Shows a crossover. This complex dynamic in C_l(t) = integral(D' + I_n + I_s) is caused by a parameter that creates a tradeoff between early deaths (high D') and overall epidemic size (integral of I). Varying f_s (fraction severe) does this by shifting people between I_n and the more fatal I_s track.
    p[8] = 6   # Plot 9 is f_s
    # Plot 5: Shows large, consistent separation in an increasing function (C_l(t)). This corresponds to a parameter that directly scales the epidemic size. Increasing the contact rate of hospitalized patients, beta_h, does this.
    p[4] = 9   # Plot 5 is beta_h

    # Step 4: Identify the remaining decreasing plots (S(t)) for mortality parameters.
    # Plots {1, 3, 6, 8} correspond to {mu, mu_n, mu_s, mu_h}.
    # We rank them by the expected visual magnitude of their effect on S(t).
    # Effect of mu_n > mu_s > mu_h > mu.
    # mu_n's effect is largest as it acts on the largest infected pool (I_n).
    # mu_s's effect is next, on the smaller I_s pool.
    # mu_h's effect is smaller still, acting only on the hospitalized subset H.
    # mu's effect is the weakest as the baseline mortality rate is very small.
    # Visual inspection of the plots gives a strength ranking: Plot 1 > Plot 3 > Plot 6 > Plot 8.
    
    # Plot 1 (strongest effect) -> mu_n
    p[0] = 3
    # Plot 3 (strong effect) -> mu_s
