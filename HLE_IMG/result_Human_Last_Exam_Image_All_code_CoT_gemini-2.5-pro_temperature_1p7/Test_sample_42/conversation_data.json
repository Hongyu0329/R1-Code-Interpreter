    "An analysis of the icon reveals several key features for identification. The figure is an elderly, bearded monastic saint holding a scroll. The artistic style is characteristic of the work of Dionisius, a renowned Russian iconographer. This specific image is a fresco from the Ferapontov Monastery, dating to around 1502.\n\nThe text on the scroll is written in Old Church Slavonic and begins with words related to conquering the heart and thoughts. This text is a well-known quote attributed to Saint Macarius of Egypt, a prominent Desert Father whose teachings focused on internal spiritual warfare. Therefore, the figure depicted is Saint Macarius of Egypt.\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the saint depicted in the icon and provides the reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    saint_name = \"Saint Macarius\"\n    option = \"B\"\n\n    # Explanation based on iconographic analysis\n    explanation = [\n        \"1.
