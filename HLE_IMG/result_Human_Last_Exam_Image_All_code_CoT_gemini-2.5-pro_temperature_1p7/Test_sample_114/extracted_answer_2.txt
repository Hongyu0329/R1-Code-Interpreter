The regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is caused by the rigid cyclic structure of the N-acetylproline starting material, which forms an inflexible bicyclic munchone intermediate. In this intermediate, the acetyl group and the proline backbone are structurally distinct and locked in place, leading to a sterically controlled and highly selective cycloaddition. Reactions 1 and 2 show that this is not the case for the conformationally flexible acyclic starting material, N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine. The key evidence from the ¹³C labeling in Reaction 2 reveals that the acetyl-methyl and alanine-methyl groups become scrambled in the final product. This indicates the reaction proceeds via a symmetric intermediate or equilibrating intermediates, a process made possible by the conformational freedom of the acyclic structure. This scrambling of the two reactive moieties results in a lack of regioselectivity. Therefore, the presence of the proline ring in Reaction 3 prevents this scrambling pathway and enforces regioselectivity.
