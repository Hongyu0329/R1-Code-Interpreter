    """
    This function explains the reasoning to determine the stereochemistry of the product
    in the given alkene metathesis cascade reaction.
    """
    
    # Step 1: Analyze the starting material and reaction type.
    # The reaction is a Grubbs II catalyzed alkene metathesis cascade.
    # The starting material has two methyl groups. Their stereochemistry needs to be determined.
    # Me_top is shown with a wedge, so it's UP.
    # Me_bot is on the exo face for favorable reaction, so it's also considered UP.
    # Conclusion 1: Both Me groups in the starting material are UP.
    
    # Step 2: Map the starting material components to the product rings.
    # The short side chain `-(C=O)-CH=CH2` belongs to the same carbon as Me_top. It forms the 5-membered ring.
    # The long side chain `-(CH2)2-C(=O)-CH=CH2` belongs to the same carbon as Me_bot. It forms the 7-membered ring.
    
    # Step 3: Map the methyl groups to the product positions (R1, R2, R3, R4).
    # Since Me_top is associated with the 5-ring formation, it will end up at the 5/6 ring junction (positions R2 or R4).
    # Since Me_bot is associated with the 7-ring formation, it will end up at the 6/7 ring junction (positions R1 or R3).
    
    # Step 4: Combine the stereochemistry and position information.
    # We have one 'Me UP' at position R1 or R3.
    # We have one 'Me UP' at position R2 or R4.
    # The other two R groups are hydrogens.
    
    # Step 5: Evaluate the answer choices based on the deductions.
    # Choice B: R1 = Me UP, R2 = Me UP, R3 = H DOWN, R4 = H DOWN.
    # This choice places one 'Me UP' at R1 (from the R1/R3 set).
    # It places the second 'Me UP' at R2 (from the R2/R4 set).
    # This is consistent with our mapping.
    
    # Step 6: Analyze the stereochemistry of the hydrogens.
    # The remaining R groups, R3 and R4, are hydrogens.
    # Ring-closing metathesis typically results in thermodynamically stable cis-fused rings.
    # This means the hydrogens at the new bridgeheads should be on the same face.
    # Choice B shows both R3 and R4 as H DOWN, which is a cis relationship.
    # This cis-down orientation is common for the resulting bridgehead protons in these cascades.
    
    # Final conclusion based on the step-by-step analysis.
    R1 = "Me UP"
    R2 = "Me UP"
    R3 = "H DOWN"
    R4 = "H DOWN"
    
    print("The final deduced structure has the following substituents:")
    print(f"R1 = {R1}")
    print(f"R2 = {R2}")
    print(f"R3 = {R3}")
    print(f"R4 = {R4}")
    print("This corresponds to answer choice B.")
