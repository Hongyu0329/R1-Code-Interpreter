    This function identifies the city where the photo was taken.
    The image shows the interior of the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center (BCEC).
    Key features include:
    1.  A white, lattice-like steel truss roof structure.
    2.  A glass ceiling with a pattern of dots (fritted glass) that creates unique circular shadow patterns.
    These architectural elements are signature features of the BCEC.
