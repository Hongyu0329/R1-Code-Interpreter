    """
    This function provides the solution to the four-part manuscript analysis question.
    1. Vowel-marking system: Babylonian (supralinear pointing).
    2. Time span: The Babylonian system was used c. 7th-13th centuries. A 7-century span is 07-13.
    3. Material: The appearance is consistent with prepared animal skin, i.e., parchment.
    4. Verse identification: The presence of city names Gezer, Kibzaim, and Beth-horon points to Joshua 21.
       The first verse of the specified column (right page, left column) is Joshua 21:20.
       Format: jos (Joshua) .021 (chapter) :020 (verse).
