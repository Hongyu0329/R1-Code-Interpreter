    This function identifies the products of the given reaction sequence.

    The reaction proceeds in two steps:
    1. A thermal 4Ï€ electrocyclic ring opening of a trans-3,4-disubstituted cyclobutene.
       This conrotatory opening produces two diastereomeric dienes: (1E,3E) and (1Z,3Z).
    2. A Diels-Alder cycloaddition of each diene with ethyl acrylate.
       The reaction follows the 'endo' rule for stereoselectivity.

    - The reaction of the (1E,3E)-diene leads to Product G.
    - The reaction of the (1Z,3Z)-diene leads to Product C.
