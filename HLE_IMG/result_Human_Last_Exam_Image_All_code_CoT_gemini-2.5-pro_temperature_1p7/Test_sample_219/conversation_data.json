    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Identify Synchronized Bursts**: I will visually inspect the provided raster plot to locate the time points where a large number of electrodes fire simultaneously. These appear as dense vertical bands in the plot.\n2.  **Estimate Timestamps**: For each identified burst, I will estimate its central timestamp by reading the corresponding value from the x-axis (Time in seconds).\n3.  **Calculate Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**: I will calculate the time difference between each consecutive pair of burst timestamps.\n4.  **Calculate Average IBI**: I will sum all the calculated IBIs and divide by the total number of intervals to find the average.\n5.  **Format the Output**: I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the result formatted to two significant figures, as requested. The script will also explicitly show the numbers used in the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_average_ibi():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies timestamps of synchronized bursts from the provided graph,\n    calculates the inter-burst intervals (IBIs), and computes the average IBI.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the timestamps of the major synchronized bursts from the graph.\n    # These are the dense vertical bands where many electrodes fire at once.\n    # From visual inspection, the bursts occur at approximately these times (in seconds).\n    burst_timestamps = [3, 14, 19, 25, 35, 46]\n    print(f\"Identified burst timestamps (s): {burst_timestamps}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)\n    # The IBI is the time difference between consecutive bursts.\n    intervals = np.diff(burst_timestamps)\n    print(\"Calculating the inter-burst intervals (IBIs):\")\n    for i in range(len(intervals)):\n        t1 = burst_timestamps[i]\n        t2 = burst_timestamps[i+1]\n        print(f\"  Interval {i+1}: {t2} s - {t1} s = {intervals[i]} s\")\n    print(f\"\\nCalculated IBIs (s): {list(intervals)}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the average IBI\n    average_interval = np.mean(intervals)\n    \n    # Step 4: Display the final calculation and result\n    # We construct the string for the final equation to show all numbers.\n    interval_sum_str = \" + \".join(map(str, intervals))\n    num_intervals = len(intervals)\n    total_sum = sum(intervals)\n\n    print(\"Final average IBI calculation:\")\n    print(f\"  Average = ({interval_sum_str}) / {num_intervals}\")\n    print(f\"  Average = {total_sum} / {num_intervals}\")\n    \n    # Format the final result to two significant figures.\n    formatted_average = \"{:.2g}\".format(average_interval)\n    print(f\"\\nThe average inter-burst interval is {average_interval:.2f} s.\")\n    print(f\"Rounded to two significant figures, the average inter-burst interval is {formatted_average} s.\")\n\ncalculate_average_ibi()\n```\n<<<8.6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
