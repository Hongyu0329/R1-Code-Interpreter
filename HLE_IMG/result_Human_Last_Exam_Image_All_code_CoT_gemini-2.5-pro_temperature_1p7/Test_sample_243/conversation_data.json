    "This plant is identified as *Debregeasia heveloi*, a species known for its beautifully reticulated leaves. It is a critically endangered plant from the nettle family (Urticaceae). My task is to identify the specific, remote island to which this unique plant is endemic. I will use a simple Python script to output the name of this island.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function prints the name of the island where the plant Debregeasia heveloi is endemic.\n  \"\"\"\n  island_name = \"Gough Island\"\n  print(f\"The plant, Debregeasia heveloi, was endemic to: {island_name}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<Gough Island>>>"
