    "This image displays a typical North Atlantic rocky intertidal community. To determine which species indicates an Atlantic vs. a Pacific coast location, we need to identify the organisms and check their geographic distributions.\n\n1.  **Identify the Organisms:** The photo shows several marine invertebrates:\n    *   **Acorn Barnacles:** These are the numerous small, cone-shaped crustaceans encrusting the rock. They appear to be *Semibalanus balanoides* (Northern Rock Barnacle), which is found on *both* the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America. Therefore, the barnacles are not a definitive indicator.\n    *   **Periwinkle Snails:** There are several snails visible. The most prominent one is the larger, striped snail. This is the **Common Periwinkle**, scientific name *Littorina littorea*. There are also smaller, darker periwinkles, likely *Littorina saxatilis* (Rough Periwinkle).\n\n2.  **Analyze Geographic Distribution:**\n    *   ***Littorina littorea* (Common Periwinkle):** This species is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean (Europe). It was introduced to the North American Atlantic coast in the 19th century and is now extremely common from Canada down to Maryland. Critically, it is **not established on the Pacific Coast** of North America.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The presence of the Common Periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*, is a definitive indicator that this photo was taken on a shoreline of the Atlantic Ocean (either in North America or Europe), and not the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe following Python code will print the scientific name of this indicator species.\n\n```python\ndef find_indicator_species():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the species from the image that is native or\n  well-established on the Atlantic Coast but not on the Pacific Coast.\n  \n  The key organism for this identification is the Common Periwinkle.\n  - Scientific Name: Littorina littorea\n  - Distribution: Native to the Northeast Atlantic. A very common\n    introduced species on the Northwest Atlantic coast. It is not\n    established on the Pacific Coast of North America.\n\n  Therefore, its presence is a clear sign of an Atlantic coastal location.\n  \"\"\"\n  \n  indicator_species_name = \"Littorina littorea\"\n  print(indicator_species_name)\n\nfind_indicator_species()\n```\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
