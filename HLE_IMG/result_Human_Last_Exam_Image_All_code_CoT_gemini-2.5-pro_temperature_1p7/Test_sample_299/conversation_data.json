    "This is a mate-in-two puzzle. My plan is to analyze the board, identify the black king's current situation, and then find a sequence of two moves for white that leads to an unavoidable checkmate, regardless of black's response.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking:**\n1.  **Analyze the Initial Position:** I'll first identify the positions of all pieces for both white and black based on the provided image. The black king is at `e4`.\n2.  **Assess the Black King's Mobility:** I will check all the squares adjacent to the black king (`d3, d4, d5, f5, f4, f3, e3`) to see if it has any legal moves.\n    *   `d4` is attacked by the White Queen on `a4` and the White Bishop on `g1`.\n    *   `d3` is attacked by the White Rook on `f3`.\n    *   `e3` is attacked by the White Bishop on `g1` and the White Rook on `f3`.\n    *   `f5` is attacked by the White Rook on `h5`.\n    *   `f3` is occupied by a White Rook.\n    *   `d5`, `e5`, and `f4` are occupied by black's own pieces.\n    Conclusion: The black king is completely trapped and has no legal moves. This is a strong indicator that White should look for a check that cannot be legally resolved by Black.\n3.  **Find a Forcing Move for White:** Since the king is immobile, White needs to deliver a check. I will look for checks that Black cannot escape from.\n    *   Let's consider `1. Qe8+`. This move checks the black king along the e-file.\n4.  **Analyze Black's Response:** Black must get out of check. The king cannot move. The checking piece (Queen on `e8`) cannot be captured. The only remaining option is to block the check.\n    *   The check is on the e-file. Black can only block at `e6` with the rook from `c6`. So, Black's only legal move is `1... Re6`.\n5.  **Deliver the Final Checkmate:** After black's forced move `1... Re6`, White can play the second move.\n    *   White plays `2. Qxe6#`. The queen captures the rook on `e6` and delivers check.\n6.  **Verify the Checkmate:**\n    *   The black king is attacked by the white queen on `e6`.\n    *   The white queen is protected by the white knight on `e7`, so the king cannot capture it.\n    *   All escape squares for the king remain controlled, as analyzed in Step 2.\n    *   The check cannot be blocked.\n    *   This is a valid checkmate.\n\nThe solution is `1. Qe8+ Re6` followed by `2. Qxe6#`. I will now generate the Python code to print this solution.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Backup original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function prints the solution to the mate-in-2 chess puzzle.\n  The solution is based on the analysis that the black king is initially trapped,\n  and a forcing check leads to an unavoidable mate.\n  \"\"\"\n  \n  # The first move for White is Queen to e8, giving a check.\n  # The number '1' indicates the move number, and '8' is the rank.\n  white_move_1 = \"Qe8+\"\n  \n  # Black's only legal response is to block with the rook.\n  # The number '6' is the rank for the rook's move.\n  black_move_1 = \"Re6\"\n  \n  # The second move for White is to capture the rook, delivering checkmate.\n  # The number '2' indicates the move number, and '6' is the rank of the capture.\n  white_move_2 = \"Qxe6#\"\n\n  print(\"The two-move checkmate solution is:\")\n  print(f\"1. {white_move_1} {black_move_1}\")\n  print(f\"2. {white_move_2}\")\n\nsolve_chess_puzzle()\n\n# Restore original stdout\nsys.stdout = original_stdout\n# Get the captured output\noutput = captured_output.getvalue()\n\n# I am a helpful AI assistant.\n# As requested, I have created a Python script to solve the task.\n# Below is the code block for you to execute.\n# The code will print the checkmate sequence.\nprint(\"```python\")\nprint(output.strip())\nprint(\"```\")\nprint(\"<<<1. Qe8+ Re6 2. Qxe6#>>>\")\n```"
