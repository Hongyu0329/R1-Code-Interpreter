    print("Step 1: Understanding Poisson's Ratio and Auxetic Materials")
    print("Poisson's ratio measures a material's tendency to expand or contract in directions perpendicular to an applied force.")
    print("A low, especially negative, Poisson's ratio is the goal. Materials with a negative Poisson's ratio are called 'auxetic'.")
    print("Auxetic materials contract laterally when compressed, unlike ordinary materials which expand.")
    print("This property is often caused by 're-entrant' structures, meaning the unit cells have concave or inward-pointing angles.\n")

    print("Step 2: Examining the Geometry of the Tiling Series")
    print("The image shows a series of honeycombs based on tiles parameterized by (a, b).")
    print("We can analyze the extreme cases to understand the trend.\n")
    
    print("Case G: Tiling (1, 0)")
    print("On the far right of the series, the tile with parameters (a, b) = (1, 0) forms a regular hexagonal tiling.")
    print("Regular hexagonal honeycombs are known to have a positive Poisson's ratio (approximately +1). They bulge outwards when compressed. This is the highest Poisson's ratio in the set.\n")
    
    print("Case A: Tiling (0, 1)")
    print("On the far left, the tile with parameters (a, b) = (0, 1) is a chevron or V-shape.")
    print("This shape is fundamentally re-entrant (concave). When used in a tiling, it creates a classic auxetic structure.")
    print("When this structure is compressed, the V-shapes fold inward, causing the entire structure to contract laterally. This results in a negative Poisson's ratio.\n")
    
    print("Step 3: Conclusion")
    print("As we move from right to left in the diagram (from (1, 0) to (0, 1)), the tile's geometry transitions from convex to increasingly concave and re-entrant.")
    print("This geometric change leads to a decrease in Poisson's ratio, from positive to negative.")
    print("The tiling with the most pronounced re-entrant shape will have the lowest (most negative) Poisson's ratio.\n")
    
    print("Final Answer:")
    print("The tiling that will have the lowest Poisson's ratio is A, corresponding to the parameters (0, 1).")
