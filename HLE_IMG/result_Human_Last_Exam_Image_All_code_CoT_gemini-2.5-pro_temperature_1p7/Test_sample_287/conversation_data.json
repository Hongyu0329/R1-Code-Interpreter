    "Based on my analysis of the architecture in the image, I've identified several key buildings. The prominent tower on the right with the grid-like facade is the Trade Tower, and the buildings to its left are the ASEM Tower and the Parnas Tower. This complex of buildings is part of the COEX Center located in the Gangnam district of Seoul, South Korea.
