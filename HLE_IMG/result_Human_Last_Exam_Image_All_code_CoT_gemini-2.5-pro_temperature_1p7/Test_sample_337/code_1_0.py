def solve_chemical_reactor_plots():
    """
    This function analyzes the provided plots and statements to determine the correct answer.

    The reasoning is as follows:

    1.  **Analyze Plot Stability and Lewis Number:**
        - The Lewis number (Le) relates thermal diffusivity to mass diffusivity. A higher Le implies faster heat removal and thus greater stability.
        - The six plots represent three systems, each at a high Le and a low Le.
        - Plots 1, 2, and 3 depict stable or damped behavior (spiraling or settling to a steady state). These correspond to the high-Le simulations.
        - Plots 4, 5, and 6 depict unstable behavior (sustained oscillations or chaos). These correspond to the low-Le simulations.
        - The question about the set of plots with "a Lewis number twice as large" asks to identify the high-Le set.
        - The high-Le set is {1, 2, 3}. This matches **statement 12**.

    2.  **Evaluate Answer Choices based on Lewis Number:**
        - Since statement 12 must be correct, we can eliminate all answer choices that do not include it. This leaves us with choices F ({4, 6, 12}) and L ({1, 12}).

    3.  **Evaluate System-to-Plot Mappings for Remaining Choices:**
        - **Choice L ({1, 12})**: This implies statement 1 is true ("Plots 2 and 5 correspond to system (A)"). This would force the other systems (B and C) to be mapped to the remaining plots {(1,3), (4,6)}, {(1,4), (3,6)}, or {(1,6), (3,4)}. System (B), the simplest reactor, would be mapped to a pair showing either two stable states or a jump from stability to chaos, which is physically less plausible than other available pairings.
        - **Choice F ({4, 6, 12})**: This implies statements 4 and 6 are true.
            - Statement 4: "Plots 2 and 4 correspond to system (A)".
            - Statement 6: "Plots 1 and 6 correspond to system (C)".
            - By elimination, the remaining plots, 3 and 5, must correspond to system (B).

    4.  **Verify the Plausibility of the Mapping from Choice F:**
        - The resulting mapping is:
            - **System (A) -> Plots (2, 4)** (Recycle Reactor: Damped Oscillation to Chaos). Plausible.
            - **System (B) -> Plots (3, 5)** (Tubular Reactor: Stable to Simple Limit Cycle). Plausible, as the simplest system exhibits the simplest dynamics.
            - **System (C) -> Plots (1, 6)** (Catalyst Particle: Stable to Complex Chaos). Plausible.
        - This mapping is consistent and physically plausible.

    5.  **Conclusion:**
        - The mapping derived from choice F is sound.
        - Let's check the statements in choice F ({4, 6, 12}) against this mapping.
            - Statement 4 is true by definition of the mapping.
            - Statement 6 is true by definition of the mapping.
            - Statement 12 is true, as verified in step 1.
        - All statements in choice F are correct.
