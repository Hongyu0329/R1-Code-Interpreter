    "Here is my plan to determine the molecular formula of the product.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:** The initial molecule is a complex bicyclic lactam. I will first determine its structure and count the number of atoms of each element (Carbon, Hydrogen, Fluorine, Nitrogen, Oxygen) to find its molecular formula.\n    *   The structure is a derivative of `2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one`.\n    *   Substituents are:\n        *   A PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) group on the nitrogen atom (N2). The formula for PMB is C8H9O.\n        *   A trifluoromethyl (CF3) group on the double bond (at C6).\n    *   By summing the atoms of the core structure and the substituents, I will find the starting formula.\n\n2.  **Analyze Step 1 (CAN treatment):** The reagent CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) is a standard reagent used to remove the PMB protecting group from a nitrogen atom. This reaction replaces the PMB group (C8H9O) with a single hydrogen (H) atom. I will adjust the atom counts accordingly to find the formula of Intermediate 1.\n\n3.  **Analyze Step 2 (Hydrogenation):** The reaction with Pd/C and H2 is a catalytic hydrogenation. This will reduce the carbon-carbon double bond (`C=C`) in the bicyclic ring to a single bond (`C-C`). This transformation adds two hydrogen (H) atoms to the molecule. I will update the atom counts to find the formula of Intermediate 2.\n\n4.  **Analyze Step 3 (Acid Hydrolysis):** Treating the lactam (a cyclic amide) with strong acid (HCl) and heat causes hydrolysis. This reaction breaks the amide bond (`C-N`) within the ring by adding one molecule of water (H2O). This opens the ring and converts the amide into a carboxylic acid (-COOH) and an amine (-NH2). The amine will be protonated in acid, but for the molecular formula, we typically consider the neutral parent molecule. So, I will add the atoms of one water molecule (H2O) to the formula of Intermediate 2 to get the final product's formula.\n\n5.  **Final Output:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations step-by-step and then print the resulting molecular formula of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef solve_molecular_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular formula of the product through a three-step reaction.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the molecular formula of the starting material.\n    # The structure is N-PMB-6-trifluoromethyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    # Core (6-trifluoromethyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one): C7H5F3NO\n    # PMB group (para-methoxybenzyl): C8H9O\n    atoms_start = {\n        'C': 7 + 8,  # 7 from core, 8 from PMB\n        'H': 5 + 9,  # 5 from core, 9 from PMB\n        'F': 3,      # 3 from CF3 group\n        'N': 1,      # 1 from the ring nitrogen\n        'O': 1 + 1   # 1 from core carbonyl, 1 from PMB ether\n    }\n    # So, starting material is C15H14F3NO2.\n\n    # Step 2: Reaction with CAN to form Intermediate 1.\n    # This step removes the PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) protecting group and replaces it with H.\n    # We subtract the atoms of the PMB group (C8H9O) and add one H.\n    atoms_intermediate_1 = atoms_start.copy()\n    atoms_intermediate_1['C'] -= 8\n    atoms_intermediate_1['H'] -= 9\n    atoms_intermediate_1['O'] -= 1\n    atoms_intermediate_1['H'] += 1\n    # Intermediate 1 is 6-trifluoromethyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one (C7H6F3NO).\n\n    # Step 3: Reaction with Pd/C, H2 to form Intermediate 2.\n    # This is a hydrogenation reaction that reduces the C=C double bond to a C-C single bond.\n    # This adds 2 Hydrogen atoms to the molecule.\n    atoms_intermediate_2 = atoms_intermediate_1.copy()\n    atoms_intermediate_2['H'] += 2\n    # Intermediate 2 is 6-trifluoromethyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one (C7H8F3NO).\n\n    # Step 4: Reaction with 4N HCl to form the final Product.\n    # This is an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the lactam (cyclic amide).\n    # This reaction adds one molecule of water (H2O) across the amide bond, opening the ring.\n    atoms_product = atoms_intermediate_2.copy()\n    atoms_product['H'] += 2\n    atoms_product['O'] += 1\n    # The final product is an amino acid (C7H10F3NO2).\n\n    # Format the final molecular formula string\n    formula = \"\"\n    for atom in ['C', 'H', 'F', 'N', 'O']:\n        count = atoms_product[atom]\n        formula += atom\n        if count > 1:\n            formula += str(count)\n\n    print(f\"The molecular formula of the starting material is C{atoms_start['C']}H{atoms_start['H']}F{atoms_start['F']}N{atoms_start['N']}O{atoms_start['O']}.\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate 1 (after PMB deprotection) is C{atoms_intermediate_1['C']}H{atoms_intermediate_1['H']}F{atoms_intermediate_1['F']}N{atoms_intermediate_1['N']}O{atoms_intermediate_1['O']}.\")\n    print(f\"Intermediate 2 (after hydrogenation) is C{atoms_intermediate_2['C']}H{atoms_intermediate_2['H']}F{atoms_intermediate_2['F']}N{atoms_intermediate_2['N']}O{atoms_intermediate_2['O']}.\")\n    print(f\"The final product (after hydrolysis) has the molecular formula: {formula}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final formula is built from the following atom counts:\")\n    print(f\"Carbon (C): {atoms_product['C']}\")\n    print(f\"Hydrogen (H): {atoms_product['H']}\")\n    print(f\"Fluorine (F): {atoms_product['F']}\")\n    print(f\"Nitrogen (N): {atoms_product['N']}\")\n    print(f\"Oxygen (O): {atoms_product['O']}\")\n    # As requested, outputting the final formula in the specified way, which I interpret as\n    # printing each part of the formula string.\n    print(f\"Final equation for the product is: C{atoms_product['C']} H{atoms_product['H']} F{atoms_product['F']} N{atoms_product['N']} O{atoms_product['O']}\")\n\n\nsolve_molecular_formula()\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>\n```"
