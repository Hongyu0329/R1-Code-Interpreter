    "My analysis of the image leads to the following conclusion:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image Sequence:** The image provides a series of three micrographs labeled L, M, and N, which appear to show a biological process over time. The subject is a filamentous structure, likely a fungal hypha, which is made of a chain of cells separated by cross-walls called septa.\n2.  **Observe Frame-by-Frame Changes:**\n    *   In frame **L**, we see a healthy, straight section of the filament. The cells are turgid and have a defined shape. An arrowhead points to a septum.\n    *   In frame **M**, a significant change is visible. At the septum previously indicated, the cell wall has started to bulge outward. This suggests that the cell wall is stretching and weakening under high internal pressure.\n    *   In frame **N**, the process has culminated in the complete rupture of the cell wall at the point of the bulge. The cell has burst open, and its structural integrity is lost, causing the filament to bend.\n3.  **Identify the Biological Process:** This sequence of bulging followed by rupture is a classic example of **cell lysis** driven by osmotic pressure. Water enters the cell due to a higher solute concentration inside than outside (a hypotonic environment), building up turgor pressure. When this pressure exceeds the strength of the cell wall, the cell bursts. Given that the structure is a hypha, this process is specifically called **hyphal bursting** or **turgor-induced lysis**. This is the opposite of plasmolysis, which involves cell shrinkage in a hypertonic solution.\n\nBased on this plan, I will now generate the Python code to present the answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_process():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function analyzes the described image sequence and identifies the biological process.\n  The image shows a time-lapse of a filamentous cell (likely a fungal hypha).\n  - Image L: A healthy cell with a clear septum (cross-wall).\n  - Image M: The cell wall bulges at the septum.\n  - Image N: The cell wall has ruptured at the bulge, causing the cell to burst.\n  This bursting is due to high internal turgor pressure.\n  \"\"\"\n  process_name = \"Hyphal bursting (or turgor-induced cell lysis)\"\n  explanation = \"The image sequence depicts the lysis (bursting) of a fungal hyphal cell. High internal turgor pressure causes the cell wall to first bulge at a weak point (a septum) and then rupture, releasing the cell's contents.\"\n\n  print(f\"Process Name: {process_name}\")\n  print(f\"Explanation: {explanation}\")\n\nidentify_process()\n```\n<<<Hyphal bursting (turgor-induced cell lysis)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What process is being depicted in the image?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
