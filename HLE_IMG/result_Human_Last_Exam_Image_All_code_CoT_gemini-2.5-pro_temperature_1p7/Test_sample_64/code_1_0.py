  This function analyzes the described image sequence and identifies the biological process.
  The image shows a time-lapse of a filamentous cell (likely a fungal hypha).
  - Image L: A healthy cell with a clear septum (cross-wall).
  - Image M: The cell wall bulges at the septum.
  - Image N: The cell wall has ruptured at the bulge, causing the cell to burst.
  This bursting is due to high internal turgor pressure.
