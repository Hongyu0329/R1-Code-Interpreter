    "This mass spectrum puzzle requires a step-by-step analysis to deduce the chemical structure.\n\n### My Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Ion (M⁺) Peak Cluster:**\n    *   The highest mass peaks are in a cluster around m/z 258-268. Let's look at the peaks at m/z 262, 264, and 266, which are likely the molecular ion (M), M+2, and M+4 peaks.\n    *   The intensities are I(262) = 29.0%, I(264) = 12.9%, I(266) = 3.22%.\n    *   The ratio of I(M+4)/I(M) is 3.22 / 29.0 ≈ 0.11. The theoretical intensity ratio for a compound with two chlorine atoms (Cl₂) is M:M+2:M+4 ≈ 9:6:1. The M+4 peak relative to the M peak would be 1/9 ≈ 0.11. This is a perfect match.\n    *   The ratio of I(M+2)/I(M) is 12.9 / 29.0 ≈ 0.44. The theoretical ratio for Cl₂ is 6/9 ≈ 0.67. While not a perfect match, it's plausible, and the M+4 match is very strong evidence for the presence of **two chlorine atoms**.\n\n2.  **Determine the Molecular Formula:**\n    *   Assuming the peak at m/z 262 represents the molecule with two ³⁵Cl isotopes, the molecular weight is 262.\n    *   Mass of 2 x ³⁵Cl = 70.\n    *   Remaining mass = 262 - 70 = 192.\n    *   This remaining mass of 192 must be composed of carbon and hydrogen (and possibly other elements like O or N).\n    *   Let's find a combination of C and H that sums to 192. A likely candidate is C₁₅H₁₂ (15 * 12 + 12 = 180 + 12 = 192).\n    *   This gives a molecular formula of **C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂**. The \"rings plus double bonds\" value for this formula is 9, indicating a highly unsaturated/aromatic structure.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Fragmentation Pattern:**\n    *   **Base Peak (most intense):** The base peak is at **m/z 225** (Intensity = 100%).\n    *   **Major Fragment at m/z 227:** There is a very strong peak at m/z 227 (Intensity = 66.7%). Let's investigate its origin. A very common fragmentation is the loss of a chlorine radical (Cl•, mass 35) from the molecular ion.\n        *   M⁺ (m/z 262) - Cl• (mass 35) → Fragment⁺ (m/z 227)\n        *   This creates the fragment ion [C₁₅H₁₂Cl]⁺.\n    *   **Formation of the Base Peak (m/z 225):** The base peak at m/z 225 is likely formed from the m/z 227 fragment by losing two hydrogen atoms (H₂).\n        *   [C₁₅H₁₂Cl]⁺ (m/z 227) - H₂ (mass 2) → [C₁₅H₁₀Cl]⁺ (m/z 225)\n        *   The loss of H₂ is common when it leads to a more stable, fully aromatized system.\n    *   **Isotope Confirmation:** The fragment at m/z 227 ([C₁₅H₁₂Cl]⁺) has one chlorine atom, so it should have an isotope peak at m/z 229 with an intensity of about one-third of its own. Let's check the table: I(227) = 66.7, I(229) = 22.2. The ratio is 22.2 / 66.7 ≈ 0.333, a perfect match for one chlorine atom. This confirms our fragmentation pathway is highly likely.\n\n4.  **Propose a Structure:**\n    *   We need a structure for **C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂** that would readily lose Cl• and then H₂.\n    *   The formula suggests two chlorophenyl groups (2 x C₆H₄Cl) linked by a C₃H₄ group.\n    *   A structure that fits this is `1,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)cyclopropane`.\n    *   This structure is not fully aromatic due to the cyclopropane ring. The proposed fragmentation (loss of Cl•, then loss of H₂) would lead to the formation of a very stable, aromatic indenyl-type cation, which explains why this pathway is so dominant.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The compound is **1,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)cyclopropane**.\n\nI will now write a Python script to verify the mass calculations for this proposed fragmentation pathway.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mass_spec():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided mass spectrum data to identify the compound.\n    The logic is based on interpreting the molecular ion and key fragmentation peaks.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Atomic Masses (integer mass for main isotopes) ---\n    mass_C = 12\n    mass_H = 1\n    mass_Cl35 = 35\n    mass_Cl37 = 37\n\n    # --- Step 1: Propose Molecular Formula based on M+ peak ---\n    # From spectrum, M+ peak cluster suggests MW=262 and two Cl atoms.\n    # Proposed formula: C15H12Cl2\n    num_C = 15\n    num_H = 12\n    num_Cl = 2\n    \n    molecular_ion_mass = (num_C * mass_C) + (num_H * mass_H) + (num_Cl * mass_Cl35)\n    \n    print(\"--- Analysis of the Mass Spectrum ---\")\n    print(f\"Proposed Molecular Formula: C{num_C}H{num_H}Cl{num_Cl}\")\n    print(f\"Calculated Molecular Ion (M+) mass (with 2 x 35Cl):\")\n    print(f\"{num_C} * {mass_C} + {num_H} * {mass_H} + {num_Cl} * {mass_Cl35} = {molecular_ion_mass}\")\n    print(f\"This matches the observed peak at m/z = {molecular_ion_mass}.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Analyze Major Fragmentation Pathway ---\n    print(\"--- Proposed Fragmentation Pathway ---\")\n    \n    # Pathway Part 1: Loss of a Chlorine radical (Cl) from the molecular ion\n    fragment_1_mass = molecular_ion_mass - mass_Cl35\n    print(\"1.
