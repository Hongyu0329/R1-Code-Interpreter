x = symbols('x')
# Based on the visual analysis of the blue curve (asymptotes at x=2, y=x;
# local max at (0, -2); local min at (4, 6)), f(x) can be modeled as:
f_x = x + 4 / (x - 2)

f_double_prime_x = diff(f_x, x, 2)

# Step 3: Apply the transformations to get g(x) = -0.5 * f''(3x-2) + 1
# Let's define the transformation parameters from the problem
A = -0.5
k = 3
p = -2
D = 1
# The argument of f'' is (k*x + p) = (3*x - 2)
argument = k*x + p

# Substitute the argument into f''(x)
f_double_prime_transformed = f_double_prime_x.subs(x, argument)

# Construct the final function g(x)
g_x = A * f_double_prime_transformed + D

# Step 4: Analyze the target function g(x)
# Find the vertical asymptote by finding the singularity in g(x)
# The denominator of f_double_prime_transformed will be based on (argument - 2)
# (3x - 2 - 2) = (3x - 4)
# So, the vertical asymptote is at 3x - 4 = 0 => x = 4/3
va = 4.0/3.0

# The horizontal asymptote is the limit of g(x) as x -> infinity.
# Since f''(x) -> 0 as x -> infinity, the horizontal asymptote of g(x) is D.
