    "To determine the reagents A and B, we need to analyze the chemical transformations in each step.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the reaction from 1 to 2 (Reagent A):**\n    *   Compound **1** is a complex heterocyclic cation containing oxygen atoms in its fused ring system. Specifically, the bottom part of the molecule resembles a pyrylium salt, which is a six-membered aromatic ring containing an oxygen atom with a positive charge.\n    *   Compound **2** is formed from **1**. Comparing their structures, the key change is at the bottom of the molecule. The pyrylium ring in **1** is converted into an N-aminopyridinium ring in **2**. In this transformation, the ring oxygen atom is replaced by a nitrogen atom which is bonded to an amino group (`-NH2`).\n    *   This specific conversion, from a pyrylium salt to an N-aminopyridinium salt, is a well-known chemical reaction. It is achieved by reacting the pyrylium salt with **hydrazine** (`H2N-NH2`). The hydrazine acts as a nucleophile, attacks the pyrylium ring, leading to a ring-opening and subsequent ring-closing sequence that replaces the oxygen with the `N-NH2` group.\n    *   Therefore, **Reagent A is hydrazine (`N2H4`)**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the reaction from 2 to 3 (Reagent B):**\n    *   This step involves two transformations starting from compound **2**.\n    *   **Transformation 1 (Top of the molecule):** The top ring of compound **2** is a dimethoxybenzene derivative fused to the core structure. In compound **3**, this ring is converted into a new heterocyclic ring containing a nitrogen atom substituted with a propyl group (`-CH2CH2CH3`). This indicates that the two methoxy groups have been displaced and a new ring has been formed with an N-propyl group. The source of the N-propyl group must be **propylamine** (`CH3CH2CH2NH2`). The reaction is a double nucleophilic aromatic substitution (`S_NAr`) where propylamine attacks the electron-deficient aromatic ring, displacing the two methoxy groups to form the new N-propyl heterocyclic ring.\n    *   **Transformation 2 (Bottom of the molecule):** The N-aminopyridinium group (`-N+-NH2`) in compound **2** is converted to a pyridinium group (`-N+-H`) in compound **3**. This process is a deamination (loss of the `-NH2` group). This reaction can often be promoted by heat and basic conditions. Since propylamine (Reagent B) is a base and these reactions are typically performed at elevated temperatures, it is plausible that propylamine facilitates both the formation of the N-propyl ring at the top and the deamination at the bottom.\n    *   Therefore, **Reagent B is n-propylamine (`CH3CH2CH2NH2`)**.\n\n### Conclusion:\n*   Reagent A is **hydrazine**.\n*   Reagent B is **n-propylamine**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the reagents A and B in the given reaction scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    reagent_A = \"Hydrazine (H2N-NH2)\"\n    reagent_B = \"n-Propylamine (CH3CH2CH2NH2)\"\n\n    print(\"Reagent A is responsible for the conversion of the pyrylium salt (1) to the N-aminopyridinium salt (2).\")\n    print(f\"Reagent A: {reagent_A}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Reagent B is responsible for the formation of the N-propyl ring and the deamination of the N-amino group to form the final product (3).\")\n    print(f\"Reagent B: {reagent_B}\")\n\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n```\n<<<Reagent A is Hydrazine and Reagent B is n-Propylamine.>>>"
