    "Of course. Here is my plan to identify the alkaloid compound and generate the Python code.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Structure:** I will examine the provided chemical structure to identify its key functional groups and ring system. The molecule is polycyclic and contains two nitrogen atoms, characteristic of an alkaloid. It also features a carbonyl group (C=O) as part of a six-membered ring.\n2.  **Identify the Compound:** Based on the distinctive tetracyclic framework with two nitrogen atoms and a lactam (cyclic amide) functional group, I will identify the specific name of this well-known alkaloid. The structure shown is (+)-Lupanine.\n3.  **Determine Chemical Properties:** I will find the chemical formula by counting the carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms (C15H24N2O). I will then calculate its molar mass.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that stores the compound's name, formula, and atomic composition. The script will then calculate and print the molecular weight, showing the full calculation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef identify_alkaloid():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the alkaloid compound from its structure, calculates its molecular\n    weight, and prints the information.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Name of the identified alkaloid\n    compound_name = \"Lupanine\"\n\n    # Chemical formula based on the structure\n    chemical_formula = \"C15H24N2O\"\n\n    # Atomic masses (g/mol)\n    atomic_mass = {\n        'C': 12.011,\n        'H': 1.008,\n        'N': 14.007,\n        'O': 15.999\n    }\n    \n    # Number of atoms for each element in the molecule\n    atom_counts = {\n        'C': 15,\n        'H': 24,\n        'N': 2,\n        'O': 1\n    }\n\n    # Calculate molecular weight\n    molecular_weight = (atom_counts['C'] * atomic_mass['C'] +\n                        atom_counts['H'] * atomic_mass['H'] +\n                        atom_counts['N'] * atomic_mass['N'] +\n                        atom_counts['O'] * atomic_mass['O'])\n\n    print(f\"The name of the alkaloid is: {compound_name}\")\n    print(f\"The chemical formula is: {chemical_formula}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Molecular Weight Calculation:\")\n    \n    # Print the equation with each number as requested\n    c_term = f\"{atom_counts['C']} * {atomic_mass['C']}\"\n    h_term = f\"{atom_counts['H']} * {atomic_mass['H']}\"\n    n_term = f\"{atom_counts['N']} * {atomic_mass['N']}\"\n    o_term = f\"{atom_counts['O']} * {atomic_mass['O']}\"\n\n    print(f\"Equation: ({c_term}) + ({h_term}) + ({n_term}) + ({o_term})\")\n    \n    print(f\"Result: {molecular_weight:.3f} g/mol\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    identify_alkaloid()\n```\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
