# Step 1: Define the unit system
# 1 unit (u) = 0.5 cm
u_cm = 0.5

# Radius of yellow circle in units
r_y_cm = 0.5
r_y_u = r_y_cm / u_cm

print(f"The radius of a yellow circle is {r_y_cm} cm, which is {r_y_u} units.")

# Step 2 & 3: Determine the white circle radius (R) and row offsets (dx, dy)
# The relationship between tangent white circles in offset rows requires their
# center offsets (dx, dy) and diameter (2R) to form a Pythagorean triple: dx^2 + dy^2 = (2R)^2.
# We test integer values for R to find a suitable triple.
# The (3,4,5) triple and its multiples are candidates.
# 2 * (3,4,5) -> (6,8,10). This gives 2R=10, so R=5.
R_u = 5
D_u = 2 * R_u
dx_u = 8  # Larger offset is horizontal, based on image
dy_u = 6  # Smaller offset is vertical

print(f"Based on geometric constraints, the radius of a white circle R = {R_u} units.")
print(f"This implies a diameter D = {D_u} units.")
print(f"The Pythagorean triple for offsets is ({dx_u}, {dy_u}, {D_u}), satisfying {dx_u}^2 + {dy_u}^2 = {dx_u**2 + dy_u**2} and {D_u}^2 = {D_u**2}.")

R_w_cm = R_u * u_cm
print(f"The radius of a white circle is {R_w_cm} cm.")

# Step 4: Calculate the Y-coordinate of the target circle
# The bottom row of white circles is lifted by a yellow circle's diameter.
# Bottom yellow circle center y-coordinate: r_y_u = 1
# Bottom white circle lowest point: 2 * r_y_u = 2
# Bottom white circle center y-coordinate:
y_bottom_row_u = 2 + R_u
# The target circle is in the middle row.
y_middle_row_u = y_bottom_row_u + dy_u

print(f"\nThe y-coordinate of the center of the bottom row of white circles is {y_bottom_row_u} units.")
print(f"The y-coordinate of the center of the middle row of white circles is {y_bottom_row_u} + {dy_u} = {y_middle_row_u} units.")

# Step 5: Calculate the X-coordinate of the target circle
# The green rectangle on the left has width = R_w = R_u = 5 units.
# Assuming it starts at x=0, it ends at x=5.
green_rect_width_u = R_u
# The first white circle in the middle row is tangent to it.
x_first_circle_u = green_rect_width_u + R_u
# The target is the 4th circle in that row. Centers are spaced by a diameter (D_u).
# Circle centers are at x_1, x_1 + D, x_1 + 2D, x_1 + 3D
x_target_circle_u = x_first_circle_u + 3 * D_u

print(f"\nThe x-coordinate of the center of the first middle-row white circle is {green_rect_width_u} + {R_u} = {x_first_circle_u} units.")
print(f"The x-coordinate of the center of the target (right-most) white circle is {x_first_circle_u} + 3 * {D_u} = {x_target_circle_u} units.")

# Step 6: Final Answer
x_final_cm = x_target_circle_u * u_cm
y_final_cm = y_middle_row_u * u_cm

print(f"\nThe final coordinates are ({x_target_circle_u}u, {y_middle_row_u}u).")
print(f"In centimeters, this is x = {x_final_cm} cm, y = {y_final_cm} cm.")
print(f"\nThe final answer is in the format x:y")
print(f"{x_final_cm}:{y_final_cm}")
