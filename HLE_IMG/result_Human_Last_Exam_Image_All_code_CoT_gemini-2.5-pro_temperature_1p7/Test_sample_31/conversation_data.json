    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve this problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Identify the Knot:** The first step is to identify the knot shown in the picture. By examining its structure, we can count its properties.\n    *   **Crossing Number:** We can count the number of times the knot crosses over itself. Following the strand, we can count 5 distinct crossings.\n    *   **Knot Type:** The diagram has a characteristic braided structure. It appears to be a torus knot. A torus knot, denoted T(p,q), is a knot that lies on the surface of an unknotted torus. The parameters `p` and `q` are coprime integers that represent the number of times the knot wraps around the meridian and longitude of the torus, respectively.\n    *   In the given diagram, we can see two parallel strands (p=2) that twist around each other. If we follow one of these strands, it makes 5 crossings before it rejoins its starting point. This indicates that it winds five times (q=5) around the main axis of the torus.\n    *   All the crossings in the diagram are positive (using the right-hand rule), which means this is a diagram of the positive T(2,5) torus knot. This knot is also known as the cinquefoil knot or the 5₁ knot in the Rolfsen notation.\n\n2.  **Find the Rasmussen Invariant Formula:** The Rasmussen s-invariant is an integer-valued knot invariant. For a positive torus knot T(p,q) (where p, q > 0), there is a simple formula to calculate its Rasmussen invariant:\n    `s(T(p,q)) = (p - 1) * (q - 1)`\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula:** Now we apply this formula to the knot we identified, T(2,5).\n    *   p = 2\n    *   q = 5\n    *   s(T(2,5)) = (2 - 1) * (5 - 1)\n    *   s(T(2,5)) = 1 * 4\n    *   s(T(2,5)) = 4\n\n4.  **Construct the Python Code:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the result, explaining each step as requested. The script will define `p` and `q`, calculate the result using the formula, and print the equation with all the numbers.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rasmussen_invariant_T25():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Rasmussen invariant for the knot in the image.\n    The knot is identified as the T(2,5) torus knot.\n    The formula for the Rasmussen invariant of a positive torus knot T(p,q)\n    is s = (p-1)*(q-1).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Parameters for the T(2,5) torus knot\n    p = 2\n    q = 5\n\n    print(\"The knot shown in the image is the positive torus knot T(p,q) with p=2 and q=5.\")\n    print(\"The formula for the Rasmussen s-invariant for a positive torus knot is:\")\n    print(\"s = (p - 1) * (q - 1)\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculating for the T(2,5) knot:\")\n\n    # Perform the calculation step by step\n    p_minus_1 = p - 1\n    q_minus_1 = q - 1\n    invariant = p_minus_1 * q_minus_1\n\n    # Print the equation with the values substituted\n    print(f\"s = ({p} - 1) * ({q} - 1)\")\n    print(f\"s = {p_minus_1} * {q_minus_1}\")\n    print(f\"s = {invariant}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe Rasmussen invariant of the knot is {invariant}.\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the result\ncalculate_rasmussen_invariant_T25()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
