    "An analysis of the algorithm's time complexity is required. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Algorithm's Structure:** The provided code defines a recursive function `sort(a, n)`. The base case for the recursion is when `n <= 1`. For `n > 1`, the function performs the following steps:\n    *   It makes a recursive call: `sort(a, n - 1)`.\n    *   It performs a comparison and an optional swap between `a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]`. This is a constant time operation, `O(1)`.\n    *   If the swap occurs, it makes a *second* recursive call: `sort(a, n - 1)`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Worst-Case Scenario:** The time complexity depends on the number of recursive calls. The worst-case scenario occurs when the `if` condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is true for every call of `sort(a,n)` on the recursion path. This triggers both recursive `sort(a, n - 1)` calls, maximizing the total number of operations. An array sorted in reverse order (e.g., `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`) is a perfect example of a worst-case input.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation:** Let `T(n)` be the time taken by the algorithm for an input of size `n` in the worst case. The work done by a single call `sort(a, n)` consists of the work from its subproblems plus the constant-time work for the comparison and swap. In the worst case, this gives the following recurrence relation:\n    `T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + c`  (where `c` represents the constant time for the `if` and `swap`)\n    This simplifies to:\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n\n4.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:** This is a linear recurrence relation. We can solve it by expansion:\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 4 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 4 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 3c = 8 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    *   ...after `k` steps...\n    *   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + (2^k - 1) * c`\n\n    To reach the base case `T(1)`, we set `k = n - 1`:\n    *   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + (2^(n-1) - 1) * c`\n    Since `T(1)` is a constant, the entire expression is dominated by the `2^(n-1)` term.\n\n    Therefore, the time complexity `T(n)` is `O(2^n)`.\n\nThe following Python script implements and analyzes the algorithm, counting the number of recursive calls on a worst-case input to demonstrate this exponential growth.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef analyze_sorting_algorithm():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided recursive sorting algorithm by instrumenting it to count\n    calls and running it on worst-case inputs.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The recursion limit might be hit for n > ~20, so we can increase it if needed.\n    # sys.setrecursionlimit(2000) \n    \n    # A dictionary is used as a mutable counter object to be passed through recursion.\n    counter = {'calls': 0}\n\n    def sort_instrumented(a, n):\n        \"\"\"\n        The provided sorting algorithm, instrumented to count recursive calls.\n        \"\"\"\n        counter['calls'] += 1\n        if n > 1:\n            sort_instrumented(a, n - 1)\n            # The comparison is a constant time operation.\n            if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:\n                # The swap is also a constant time operation.\n                a[n - 1], a[n - 2] = a[n - 2], a[n - 1]\n                sort_instrumented(a, n - 1)\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the worst-case time complexity of the algorithm.\")\n    print(\"The recurrence relation for the number of calls, C(n), is:\")\n    \n    # Outputting the numbers in the final equation as requested\n    coefficient = 2\n    n_minus_1_val = \"n - 1\"\n    constant = 1 # for the call itself\n    print(f\"C(n) = {coefficient} * C({n_minus_1_val}) + {constant}\")\n    print(\"This recurrence solves to O(2^n).
