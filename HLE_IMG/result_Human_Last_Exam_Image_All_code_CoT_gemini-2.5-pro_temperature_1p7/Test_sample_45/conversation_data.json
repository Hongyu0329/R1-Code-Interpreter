    "The task is to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling shown in the image.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n1.  **Analyze the tiling:** I will visually inspect the geometric pattern to identify the component shapes and potential centers of rotation. The pattern appears to be constructed from blue hexagons, tan squares, yellow pentagons, and orange rhombi.\n2.  **Identify Potential Symmetries:** The presence of regular-looking hexagons suggests a possible 6-fold symmetry, while the squares suggest a possible 4-fold symmetry.\n3.  **Test the Symmetries:** According to the crystallographic restriction theorem, a periodic pattern cannot simultaneously have both 4-fold and 6-fold rotational symmetry. I must critically evaluate both possibilities to determine which one is correct.\n    *   **6-fold test:** I will mentally rotate the pattern by 360/6 = 60 degrees around the center of a blue hexagon and check if the entire tiling maps onto itself.\n    *   **4-fold test:** I will mentally rotate the pattern by 360/4 = 90 degrees around the center of a tan square and verify if the arrangement of its neighboring tiles is preserved.\n4.  **Conclude the Highest Symmetry Order:** The highest order of rotational symmetry that leaves the entire tiling unchanged will be the answer.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script to formalize this reasoning and present the result. The script will state the final order of symmetry and show the calculation for the minimum rotation angle, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_rotational_symmetry():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the rotational symmetry of the provided tiling image.\n    \n    Step-by-step reasoning:\n    1.  The tiling consists of several repeating shapes, notably blue hexagons and tan squares.\n        These regular-looking polygons are candidates for centers of rotational symmetry.\n\n    2.  Hypothesis 1: 6-fold symmetry based on the blue hexagons.\n        A full circle is 360 degrees. For 6-fold symmetry, the minimum rotation angle that\n        leaves the pattern unchanged would be 360 / 6 = 60 degrees.\n        Visually inspecting the pattern, a 60-degree rotation around the center of any\n        blue hexagon maps the hexagon and all its surrounding tiles perfectly onto\n        the positions of identical tiles. This symmetry appears to hold true for the entire pattern.\n\n    3.  Hypothesis 2: 4-fold symmetry based on the tan squares.\n        For 4-fold symmetry, the rotation angle would be 360 / 4 = 90 degrees.\n        Let's test this. A 90-degree rotation around the center of a square maps the square\n        onto itself. However, looking closely at the tiles meeting at the square's corners reveals\n        that the arrangement is not 4-fold symmetric. Each corner of a square adjoins one\n        yellow pentagon and one orange rhombus. A 90-degree rotation would require a\n        pentagon to be mapped onto a rhombus, which is not the case.\n        Therefore, the tiling does not have 4-fold rotational symmetry.\n\n    4.  Conclusion: The highest order of rotational symmetry present in the tiling is 6-fold.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The order of rotational symmetry is the number of times the tiling maps\n    # onto itself during a 360-degree rotation.\n    order_of_symmetry = 6\n    \n    # A full rotation is 360 degrees.\n    full_circle_degrees = 360\n    \n    # Calculate the minimum angle of rotation for this symmetry.\n    min_rotation_angle = full_circle_degrees / order_of_symmetry\n    \n    print(\"The rotational symmetry of the tiling is 6-fold.\")\n    print(\"This conclusion is reached by observing that the pattern repeats every 60 degrees when rotated around the center of a blue hexagon.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe mathematical relationship between the order of symmetry (n), and the minimum angle of rotation is:\")\n    print(\"Angle = 360 / n\")\n    print(\"\\nFor this tiling, the equation with its numbers is:\")\n    # Printing each number in the final equation\n    print(f\"{full_circle_degrees} / {order_of_symmetry} = {int(min_rotation_angle)}\")\n\nsolve_rotational_symmetry()\n```\n<<<6>>>"
