    "My analysis of the image on the ancient Greek vase leads me to identify the mythological scene and the central figure.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking:**\n1.  **Analyze the scene:** The vase painting depicts a dramatic event involving multiple figures. There is a chariot with a driver and a prominent female passenger. Above them flies a winged figure, identifiable as Nike, the goddess of Victory. On the ground, beneath the chariot, lies the body of a man. The driver is wearing clothing with a patterned sleeve and a headdress, often used by Greek artists to denote a non-Greek, or \"barbarian,\" origin.\n2.  **Interpret the narrative:** The combination of a woman escaping in a chariot, the presence of a dead body, and the figure of Victory points to a specific myth. This is not a simple procession or abduction but rather a triumphant escape following a violent act.\n3.  **Identify the myth:** This scene aligns with the myth of Medea's escape from Corinth. After her husband Jason left her for the princess of Corinth, Medea enacted a terrible revenge, killing the princess and, in most versions of the myth, her own children. To escape Jason's wrath, she fled in a magical chariot provided by her grandfather, the sun-god Helios.\n4.  **Identify the figure:** The central female figure being carried away in the chariot is Medea. The man on the ground represents her victims (either Creon, the king of Corinth, or one of her sons, often depicted as a young man). Nike flying overhead symbolizes the \"success\" of Medea's revenge and her safe escape. Therefore, the figure leaving the chariot is the sorceress Medea.\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the figure leaving the chariot in the provided image of a Greek vase.\n    The analysis of the iconography points to a specific mythological scene.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The scene depicted is Medea's escape from Corinth.\n    # The central figure is a woman in a chariot, a dead man is on the ground below,\n    # and Nike (Victory) is flying overhead.\n    # This combination of elements identifies the passenger as Medea.\n    figure = \"Medea\"\n    print(f\"The figure leaving the chariot is identified as {figure}.\")\n\nsolve_task()\n```\n<<<Medea>>>"
