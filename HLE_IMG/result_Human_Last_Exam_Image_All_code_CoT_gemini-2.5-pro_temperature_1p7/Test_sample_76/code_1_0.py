    This function determines the possible substitution patterns on the cubane product
    based on the double Favorskii rearrangement mechanism.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  The reaction involves two independent Favorskii rearrangements.
    2.  Rearrangement 1 involves carbons 2, 3, and 4. The resulting carboxylic acid
        (from C3) can theoretically attach to either C2 or C4.
    3.  Rearrangement 2 involves carbons 6, 7, and 8. The resulting carboxylic acid
        (from C7) can theoretically attach to either C6 or C8.
    4.  Combining these possibilities gives four potential pairs of substituted carbons.
