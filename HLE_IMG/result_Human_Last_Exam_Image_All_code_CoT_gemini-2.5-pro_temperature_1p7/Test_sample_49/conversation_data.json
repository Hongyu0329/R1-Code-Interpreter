    "Of course, I can help with this circuit analysis problem. Here is a step-by-step derivation followed by the Python code to present the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Understanding the Goal:** The task is to find the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$. This node is part of an RC filter, where the capacitor is $C$ and the resistor is the Thévenin equivalent resistance ($R_{th}$) of the infinite ladder network connected to it. The angular cutoff frequency, $\\omega_c$, is given by the formula:\n    \n    $$ \\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C} $$\n    \n    Our main task is to calculate $R_{th}$.\n\n2.  **Calculating Thévenin Resistance ($R_{th}$):** To find $R_{th}$, we look for the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground ($b_0$). According to the Thévenin theorem, all independent sources must be turned off. This means the input source `IN` at node $g_0$ is grounded.\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Infinite Ladder:** The circuit is an infinite ladder. The key to solving such circuits is to use their self-similar nature. Let's analyze the ladder portion that starts from nodes $c_1$ and $d_1$. We can define a characteristic resistance, $R_{eq}$, as the equivalent resistance looking into the infinite ladder between its two rails (the 'c' rail and the 'd' rail).\n    \n    Looking into the ladder from any pair of nodes ($c_n$, $d_n$), the resistance must be the same, i.e., $R_{eq}$. This resistance is composed of the horizontal resistor 'r' between $c_n$ and $d_n$, in parallel with the path through the next stage. This next-stage path consists of two vertical resistors 'r' in series with the rest of the ladder ($R_{eq}$). So, we get the equation:\n    \n    $$ R_{eq} = r \\parallel (r + R_{eq} + r) = \\frac{r (2r + R_{eq})}{r + (2r + R_{eq})} $$\n    \n    Simplifying this gives a quadratic equation for $R_{eq}$:\n    \n    $$ R_{eq}^2 + 2r R_{eq} - 2r^2 = 0 $$\n    \n    Solving for $R_{eq}$ and taking the physically meaningful positive solution, we get:\n    \n    $$ R_{eq} = r(\\sqrt{3} - 1) $$\n\n4.  **Calculating $R_{th}$ for the whole circuit:** Now we can replace the entire infinite ladder starting from ($c_1, d_1$) with this single equivalent resistance $R_{eq}$ connected between nodes $c_1$ and $d_1$.\n    \n    The resistance $R_{th}$ seen from $a_0$ is the total resistance of the path from $a_0$ to ground. With $g_0$ grounded, this path is a simple series connection:\n    \n    *   The resistor `r` from $a_0$ to $d_1$.\n    *   The equivalent resistance $R_{eq}$ from $d_1$ to $c_1$.\n    *   The resistor `r` from $c_1$ to $g_0$ (which is grounded).\n    \n    So, the total Thévenin resistance is:\n    \n    $$ R_{th} = r + R_{eq} + r = 2r + R_{eq} $$\n    \n    Substituting the value of $R_{eq}$:\n    \n    $$ R_{th} = 2r + r(\\sqrt{3} - 1) = r(1 + \\sqrt{3}) $$\n\n5.  **Finding the Cutoff Frequency:** Finally, we substitute this $R_{th}$ back into the cutoff frequency formula:\n    \n    $$ \\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th} C} = \\frac{1}{r(1 + \\sqrt{3}) C} $$\n\nThis is the final expression for the cutoff frequency. The following Python code will print this result clearly.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The derived expression for the cutoff angular frequency wc is:\n# wc = 1 / ( (1 + sqrt(3)) * r * C )\n# This script prints the formula with the numerical coefficients evaluated,\n# as requested by the prompt.\n\n# Define the constants from the derived formula\nnumerator = 1\nconstant_in_denominator_1 = 1\nconstant_in_denominator_2 = 3\nsymbolic_r = 'r'\nsymbolic_C = 'C'\n\n# Calculate the numerical value of the coefficient for (r * C)\nnumerical_coefficient = 1 + math.sqrt(3)\n\nprint(\"The determined cutoff angular frequency (wc) at node a0 is:\")\n# Print the final equation with symbolic and numerical values\nprint(f\"wc = {numerator} / (({constant_in_denominator_1} + sqrt({constant_in_denominator_2})) * {symbolic_r} * {symbolic_C})\")\nprint(\"\\nNumerically, this is approximately:\")\nprint(f\"wc = {numerator} / ({numerical_coefficient:.5f} * {symbolic_r} * {symbolic_C})\")\n\n```\n<<<$1/(r*(1 + sqrt(3))*C)$>>>"
