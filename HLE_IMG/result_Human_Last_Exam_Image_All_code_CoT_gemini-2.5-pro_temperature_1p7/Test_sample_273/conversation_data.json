    "To determine the absolute configuration of the molecule, we will follow the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priority rules for each of the three chiral centers.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Identify Chiral Centers and Naming**: First, I will identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the alcohol, -OH) to properly number the carbons. This will allow us to refer to each chiral center by its position number (C2, C3, C4). The molecule is identified as a derivative of pentan-2-ol, specifically `5-amino-4-methyl-3-ethylpentan-2-ol`.\n2.  **Assign Priorities**: For each chiral center, I will assign priorities (1-4) to the four attached groups based on atomic number.\n3.  **Determine R/S Configuration**: I will determine the spatial arrangement of the groups based on the wedged and dashed bonds in the drawing.\n    *   For centers **C3** and **C4**, the stereochemistry is unambiguously drawn.\n    *   For center **C2**, the drawing shows two dashed bonds, which is a chemical impossibility in this type of projection. I will assume this is a common typo where one bond should be wedged. I will proceed assuming the -OH group is wedged and the -CH3 group is dashed.\n4.  **Synthesize Final Answer**: I will combine the configurations of the three centers into a final designation (e.g., 2S, 3R, 4R).\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: Finally, I will encapsulate this step-by-step analysis in a Python script that prints the reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Python script to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\ndef determine_configuration():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function outlines the step-by-step determination of the absolute\n    configuration for each chiral center in the provided molecule.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Naming and Identification of Chiral Centers\n    # The molecule's connectivity is identified as 5-amino-4-methyl-3-ethylpentan-2-ol.\n    # This numbering gives the principal functional group (alcohol) the lowest locant (2).\n    # The chiral centers are at positions C2, C3, and C4.\n\n    print(\"Analysis of the molecule's absolute configuration:\")\n    print(\"=\"*50)\n    print(\"The molecule is named 5-amino-4-methyl-3-ethylpentan-2-ol.\")\n    print(\"The chiral centers are identified at carbons 2, 3, and 4.\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analysis of Stereocenter C3\n    print(\"--- Analysis of C3 ---\")\n    print(\"Groups: -CH(OH)CH3 (from C2), -CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (from C4), -CH2CH3 (ethyl), -H.\")\n    print(\"CIP Priorities: 1: -CH(OH)CH3, 2: -CH(CH3)CH2NH2, 3: -CH2CH3, 4: -H.\")\n    print(\"Geometry: The ethyl group is wedged (forward), so the implicit -H is dashed (away).\")\n    print(\"Determination: With the lowest priority group (-H) away, the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3 is clockwise.\")\n    c3_config = \"R\"\n    print(f\"Result for C3: {c3_config}\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Step 3: Analysis of Stereocenter C4\n    print(\"--- Analysis of C4 ---\")\n    print(\"Groups: -CH2NH2, -CH(Et)R (from C3), -CH3, -H.\")\n    print(\"CIP Priorities: 1: -CH2NH2 (due to N), 2: -CH(Et)R, 3: -CH3, 4: -H.\")\n    print(\"Geometry: The methyl group is dashed (away), so the implicit -H is wedged (forward).\")\n    print(\"Determination: The path from 1 -> 2 -> 3 is counter-clockwise.
