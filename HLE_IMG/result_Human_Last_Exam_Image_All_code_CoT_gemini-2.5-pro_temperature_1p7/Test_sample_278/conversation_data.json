    "My plan is to analyze the provided micrograph to identify the key features of the microorganism. I will observe its shape, structure, and reproductive forms. Based on these morphological characteristics, I will classify the microorganism's type and probable genus. I will then write a Python script to print this detailed classification, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef classify_microorganism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided micrograph and prints a classification of the observed microorganism.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Analysis based on visual evidence in the image:\n    # 1. Stain: The image displays structures stained bright pink/magenta against a blue/green background.\n    #    This is characteristic of a Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain, which highlights fungal elements.\n    # 2. Microorganism Type: The organism is a fungus.\n    # 3. Morphology: Two distinct morphological forms are present:\n    #    - Budding Yeast Cells: These are the individual round and oval-shaped structures.\n    #      Budding is a form of asexual reproduction visible here.\n    #    - Pseudohyphae: These are the filament-like structures. They are not true hyphae but rather chains\n    #      of elongated yeast cells that remain attached after budding.\n\n    classification = \"\"\"\nClassification Report:\n----------------------\nMicroorganism Type: Fungus (specifically, a Yeast)\nObserved Morphology:\n - Budding Yeast Cells: Round to oval unicellular forms.\n - Pseudohyphae: Filamentous chains of elongated yeast cells.\n\nConclusion: The simultaneous presence of both budding yeast cells and pseudohyphae is a hallmark characteristic of the genus Candida.\n\"\"\"\n    print(classification)\n\nclassify_microorganism()\n```\n<<<The image shows a fungus, characteristic of *Candida* species, exhibiting both budding yeast cells and pseudohyphae.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Based on the image of a stain viewed under a light microscope, classify what is observed in terms of morphology and type of microorganism\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
