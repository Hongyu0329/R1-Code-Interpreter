  Solves the multi-step riddle to find the value of 'Y'.

  The logic is as follows:
  1. The crater in the image is Muller crater on Mars.
  2. It is named after Hermann Joseph Muller, who studied the effects of X-rays.
  3. X-rays are also known as "Röntgen rays".
  4. This phrase, "Rays of Röntgen", fits the "X of Y" format.
  5. The metaphor connects to Carl Sagan's view of Earth photos as a revealing, penetrating insight, much like a Röntgen ray.
  6. The question asks for Y, which in our phrase is "Röntgen".
  """
  X = "Rays"
  Y = "Röntgen"

  # The problem asks for the value of Y.
  print(Y)
