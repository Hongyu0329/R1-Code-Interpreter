    # The problem is about reversing the 3-SAT to Independent Set reduction.
    # The key is to analyze the graph's properties based on the reduction rules.

    # 1. The graph has 12 vertices. In the 3-SAT to IS reduction, each of the 'k'
    #    clauses corresponds to a triangle of 3 vertices.
    #    So, 3 * k = 12, which means the original formula had k = 4 clauses.

    # 2. The edges in the graph are of two types:
    #    a) Edges within a clause-triangle.
    #    b) "Conflict edges" connecting vertices that represent a literal and its negation (e.g., x and ~x).

    # 3. By inspecting the graph, we can find a triangle of three vertices, let's call them A, B, and C,
    #    which belong to three DIFFERENT clause-triangles.
    #    - Let A be the bottom vertex of the leftmost triangle.
    #    - Let B be the bottom vertex of the rightmost triangle.
    #    - Let C be the leftmost vertex of the central triangle.
    #    The edges (A,B), (B,C), and (C,A) are all present in the graph. Since A, B, and C
    #    are in different clauses, these must all be conflict edges.

    # 4. Let's analyze the implication of this "conflict triangle".
    #    - Edge (A, B) is a conflict edge => literal(A) is the negation of literal(B).
    #    - Edge (B, C) is a conflict edge => literal(B) is the negation of literal(C).
    #    - Edge (C, A) is a conflict edge => literal(C) is the negation of literal(A).

    # 5. This leads to a logical contradiction.
    #    From the first two points: literal(A) = ~literal(B) = ~(~literal(C)) = literal(C).
    #    So, literal(A) must be the same as literal(C).
    #    But the third point states that literal(C) = ~literal(A).
    #    Combining these findings gives: literal(A) = ~literal(A).
    #    This is a fundamental contradiction.

    # 6. Conclusion: It is impossible to assign literals to this graph's vertices
    #    in a way that is consistent with the reduction rules. Therefore, no valid
    #    3-CNF formula could have generated this graph. Any attempt to construct such a
    #    formula would result in an inherently unsatisfiable set of constraints.

    # 7. An unsatisfiable formula has 0 models. Since any possible formula derived
    #    from this graph would be unsatisfiable, the number of models is always 0.
    min_models = 0
    max_models = 0
