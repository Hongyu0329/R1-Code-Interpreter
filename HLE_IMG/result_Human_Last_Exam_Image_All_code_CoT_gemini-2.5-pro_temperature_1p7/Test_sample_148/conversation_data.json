    "Based on the clinical information and the cytomorphological features seen in the provided images, the diagnosis is a pituitary adenoma.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Clinical Context:** A mass in the sella turcica in a 28-year-old female is highly suggestive of a pituitary tumor. Pituitary adenomas are the most common tumors in this location.\n\n2.  **Cytological Findings:**\n    *   The crush smear shows cohesive clusters and scattered single cells.\n    *   The tumor cells are relatively uniform (monotonous).\n    *   The nuclei are round to oval with a finely stippled or \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin pattern, which is characteristic of neuroendocrine tumors, including pituitary adenomas.\n    *   The cytoplasm is eosinophilic (pink) and granular, and the cell borders are ill-defined, forming syncytial-like aggregates.\n    *   The background is fibrillary and granular, which is typical for the fragile cytoplasm of adenoma cells that gets smeared during the crush preparation.\n    *   There is an absence of features that would suggest other common sella turcica lesions like craniopharyngioma (no squamous cells, wet keratin, or cholesterol clefts) or meningioma (no whorls or psammoma bodies).\n\nThese findings are classic for a pituitary adenoma.\n\nSince this is a medical diagnosis question and doesn't require any calculation or coding, I will provide the final answer directly.\n\n<<<Pituitary adenoma>>>"
