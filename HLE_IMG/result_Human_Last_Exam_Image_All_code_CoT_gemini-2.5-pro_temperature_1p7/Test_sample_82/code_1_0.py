    Identifies the location of the new double bond in the product of the given intramolecular Heck reaction.
    
    The reaction mechanism involves:
    1. Oxidative addition of Pd(0) to the C9-Br bond.
    2. Migratory insertion (carbopalladation): The C4=C5 double bond adds to the Pd, forming a new C5-C9 bond and a C4-Pd bond.
    3. Beta-hydride elimination: A hydrogen from C3 and the Pd from C4 are eliminated, forming a new double bond between C3 and C4.
