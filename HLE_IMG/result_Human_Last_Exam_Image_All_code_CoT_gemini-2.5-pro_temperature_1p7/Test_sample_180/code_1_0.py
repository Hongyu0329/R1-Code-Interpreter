    - "   - EGF-like and Zinc finger domains are defined by conserved Cysteine/Histidine residues in specific arrangements, which is a different pattern."
    - "   - WD40 repeat is a ~40 amino acid motif forming a beta-propeller, not a 7-residue alpha-helical repeat."
    - "   - The Leucine Zipper motif is characterized precisely by this heptad repeat. It forms a coiled-coil alpha-helical structure, where the conserved hydrophobic residues at positions 'a' and 'd' on two helices interlock ('zip together').\n")
