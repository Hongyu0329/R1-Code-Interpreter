    "Based on the characteristic pattern of emission lines in the spectrum, the element can be identified. The spectrum displays several bright lines across the visible range, including distinct lines in the blue, a very prominent line in the green, a pair of lines in the yellow-orange, and lines in the red region. This specific \"fingerprint\" is characteristic of the element Mercury (Hg).\n\nThe Python code below confirms this by listing the prominent visible spectral lines of Mercury, which correspond to the lines seen in the image.\n\n```python\ndef identify_element():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the element based on its known spectral lines\n    that match the provided image.\n    The image displays the emission spectrum of Mercury (Hg).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The element identified based on the spectral pattern\n    element_name = \"Mercury\"\n    element_symbol = \"Hg\"\n\n    # Known prominent visible spectral lines for Mercury (wavelengths in nanometers)\n    spectral_lines = {\n        \"Violet\": 404.7,\n        \"Blue-Violet\": 435.8,\n        \"Green\": 546.1,\n        \"Yellow 1\": 577.0,\n        \"Yellow 2\": 579.1\n    }\n\n    print(f\"The spectrum shown belongs to the element: {element_name} ({element_symbol})\")\n    print(\"\\nThis is identified by its unique pattern of spectral lines.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which element has these spectral lines?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
