    "I can help with that. First, I need to identify the animal in the image. The insect shown is a Small Milkweed Bug, commonly found on plants like goldenrod (as pictured) and milkweed. I will now provide a Python script to print its scientific name.\n\n```python\n# The insect in the image is a Small Milkweed Bug.\n# This script will print its scientific name.\nscientific_name = \"Lygaeus kalmii\"\nprint(scientific_name)\n```\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
