def find_unknot_indices():
    """
    Identifies the indices of knots that are isotopic to the unknot from the provided image.

    The analysis for each knot is as follows:
    - K_1: Figure-eight knot (4_1). Not an unknot.
    - K_2: Is an unknot. It can be simplified to a simple loop by applying two Reidemeister Type II moves and one Type I move.
    - K_3: Is an unknot. It is a simple loop with one twist, removable by a single Reidemeister Type I move.
    - K_4: 6_2 knot (related to the granny/square knot). Not an unknot.
    - K_5: Is an unknot. It can be simplified to a simple loop by applying two Reidemeister Type II moves.
    - K_6: Cinquefoil knot (5_1). Not an unknot.

    The indices of the unknots are therefore 2, 3, and 5.
