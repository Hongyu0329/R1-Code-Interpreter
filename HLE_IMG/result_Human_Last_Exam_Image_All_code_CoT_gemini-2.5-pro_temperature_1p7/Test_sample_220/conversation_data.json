    "To determine which pattern represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction, we need to understand what the projection of the FCC lattice looks like from this viewpoint.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Define the FCC Structure:** An FCC lattice has atoms at the corners of a cubic unit cell and at the center of each face.\n2.  **Define the Projection:** Viewing along the [110] direction means projecting the 3D atomic coordinates onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to the `[1, 1, 0]` vector. We can choose basis vectors for this plane, such as `[0, 0, 1]` and `[1, -1, 0]`.\n3.  **Calculate Projected Coordinates:** For any atom at a 3D position (x, y, z), its projected 2D coordinates `(x_proj, y_proj)` can be calculated.\n    *   `y_proj = z`\n    *   `x_proj = (x - y) / sqrt(2)`\n4.  **Analyze the Resulting Pattern:** The resulting 2D pattern for an FCC lattice viewed along [110] is a **centered rectangular lattice**. This means the atoms form a grid of rectangles, with an additional atom located precisely in the center of each rectangle.\n5.  **Compare with Images:** We will compare this expected pattern with the given images A, B, C, and D.\n    *   **Image A:** Shows two offset rectangular lattices. This is characteristic of a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n    *   **Image B:** Appears disordered and does not show a clear, repeating crystallographic pattern like a centered rectangle.\n    *   **Image C:** Clearly shows atoms arranged in a rectangular fashion with other atoms located in the centers. For instance, the atoms at approximately (2, 7.5), (9, 7.5), (2, 14), and (9, 14) form a rectangle, and there is an atom at (5.5, 12) close to the center. While the drawing may not be perfectly to scale, its topology matches the centered rectangular pattern.\n    *   **Image D:** Shows two interpenetrating rectangular lattices, which is often characteristic of hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structures.\n\nBased on this analysis, Image C is the only one that displays the correct topology for an FCC [110] projection.\n\nThe following Python code mathematically demonstrates that the FCC [110] projection yields a centered rectangular pattern by calculating the projected coordinates of atoms in a unit cell. It identifies four atoms that form a rectangle and one atom that lies at its geometric center.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_fcc_atoms(a=1.0):\n    \"\"\"Returns the 14 atoms in a conventional FCC unit cell.\"\"\"\n    # Corners\n    corners = [\n        [0, 0, 0], [a, 0, 0], [0, a, 0], [0, 0, a],\n        [a, a, 0], [a, 0, a], [0, a, a], [a, a, a]\n    ]\n    # Face centers\n    faces = [\n        [a/2, a/2, 0], [a/2, 0, a/2], [0, a/2, a/2],\n        [a/2, a, a/2], [a, a/2, a/2], [a/2, a/2, a]\n    ]\n    return corners + faces\n\ndef project_110(points_3d):\n    \"\"\"Projects 3D points onto a plane perpendicular to the [110] direction.\"\"\"\n    projected_points = []\n    for p in points_3d:\n        x, y, z = p\n        # Projection is onto a plane defined by [0,0,1] and [1,-1,0] axes\n        x_proj = (x - y) / np.sqrt(2)\n        y_proj = z\n        projected_points.append((round(x_proj, 4), round(y_proj, 4)))\n    \n    # Return unique projected points\n    return sorted(list(set(projected_points)))\n\ndef find_centered_rectangle(points_2d):\n    \"\"\"Finds a rectangle and a centering atom in the projected points.\"\"\"\n    a = 1.0 # Lattice constant\n    \n    # Define corners of a potential unit rectangle in the projection\n    # These correspond to projections of (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,0,1), (1,0,1)\n    c1 = (0.0, 0.0)\n    c2 = (round(a / np.sqrt(2), 4), 0.0)\n    c3 = (0.0, a)\n    c4 = (round(a / np.sqrt(2), 4), a)\n    \n    corners = [c1, c2, c3, c4]\n    \n    # Calculate the geometric center of this rectangle\n    center_x = (c1[0] + c2[0]) / 2\n    center_y = (c1[1] + c3[1]) / 2\n    calculated_center = (round(center_x, 4), round(center_y, 4))\n    \n    # Find the atom at the center.
