# Plan:
# 1. Identify the reaction based on the provided image. The reactant is interpreted
#    as a polycyclic cation with three acetonide bridges. The text description
#    is considered inconsistent with the drawn structure.
# 2. The reaction with aqueous HCl under reflux is the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis
#    of the three acetonide groups.
# 3. Each acetonide bridge (-O-C(CH3)2-O-) hydrolyzes to two hydroxyl (-OH) groups
#    and one molecule of acetone (CH3COCH3).
# 4. Determine the chemical formulas for the reactant cation, product cation (A),
#    water, and the acetone byproduct.
# 5. Use Python to calculate molar masses and print the balanced chemical equation,
#    including the stoichiometric numbers.
