The reaction involves an unusual, chelation-controlled reductive cleavage of the benzodioxole (or methylenedioxy) group. The correct option is E, and the mechanism proceeds as follows:

Step 1: Deprotonation
The Grignard reagent, methylmagnesium bromide (CH3MgBr), is a very strong base. It first reacts with the most acidic proton in compound 1, which belongs to the tertiary alcohol (-OH). This acid-base reaction forms a magnesium alkoxide (R-OMgBr) and releases one molecule of methane.
Equation for this step: R-OH + CH3MgBr -> R-OMgBr + CH4

Step 2: Chelation Control
The magnesium atom in the newly formed alkoxide is Lewis acidic and coordinates with the closest lone pair donor, which is the adjacent oxygen atom (at position C4) of the benzodioxole ring. This forms a stable five-membered chelate intermediate. This chelation is crucial for the reaction's selectivity.

Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack and Ring Cleavage
The chelation activates the methylene carbon (-CH2-) of the benzodioxole bridge, making it susceptible to nucleophilic attack. A methyl anion (CH3-) from another molecule of the excess Grignard reagent attacks this electrophilic carbon. This attack forms a new carbon-carbon bond. The overall result is that the methyl group combines with the methylene bridge to form an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).
Equation for this step: CH3- + Ar-O-CH2-O-Ar -> [Attack]

Simultaneously, this attack causes the cleavage of the C-O bond on the opposite side of the bridge (the C5-O bond). This C5-O bond breaks, and the electron pair moves to the oxygen, forming a magnesium phenoxide at C5.

Step 4: Regiochemistry and Final Product
The regioselectivity is dictated by the chelation in Step 2. The oxygen atom involved in the chelate (C4-O) is retained and becomes part of the new ethoxy group. The other oxygen atom's bond (C5-O) is cleaved to form the phenoxide. After acidic workup, the phenoxide is protonated to a phenol (-OH).

The final product is therefore (2R,3S)-3-((benzyloxy)methyl)-4-ethoxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)-2-(1-((4-methoxybenzyl)oxy)-2-methylpropan-2-yl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-5-ol.

Summary:
The benzodioxole group Ar-O-CH2-O-Ar is converted into an ethoxy group at C4 and a hydroxyl group at C5. This transformation consumes two equivalents of CH3MgBr: one as a base and one as a methyl nucleophile. The excess reagent ensures the reaction goes to completion. This outcome precisely matches the description in answer choice E.
