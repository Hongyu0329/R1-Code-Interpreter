    "This is a multistep photochemical reaction. To determine the pericyclic reactions involved, we need to break down the transformation into plausible elementary steps.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants and Product:** We start with hexafluorobenzene, an aromatic compound, and cyclobutene, a strained alkene. The product is a complex tricyclic molecule. A direct cycloaddition is unlikely to form this product.\n2.  **Propose a Reactive Intermediate:** Aromatic compounds like benzene are known to undergo photochemical valence isomerization. Specifically, hexafluorobenzene can isomerize to its Dewar isomer, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This type of reaction is the first pericyclic reaction.\n3.  **Identify the First Pericyclic Reaction:** The isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene can be classified as an intramolecular **[2+2] cycloaddition**. This involves 4 π-electrons and is photochemically allowed.\n4.  **Analyze the Second Step:** The resulting hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene is highly strained and contains reactive double bonds. It can then react with cyclobutene in a second pericyclic reaction. Looking at the product, this second step is an intermolecular **[2+2] cycloaddition** between one of the double bonds of hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene and the double bond of cyclobutene. This is also a 4 π-electron process and is photochemically allowed.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The overall transformation involves two sequential [2+2] cycloaddition reactions.\n\nThe following Python code will print the detailed explanation and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the pericyclic reactions involved in the transformation\n    and prints the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Explanation of the reaction steps\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nThe transformation occurs in two sequential photochemically allowed pericyclic steps:\n\nStep 1: Valence Isomerization of Hexafluorobenzene\nUnder photochemical conditions (hv), hexafluorobenzene first undergoes an intramolecular reaction to form hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene. This is the first pericyclic reaction.\nReaction Type: Intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition. This is a 4-electron process which is allowed photochemically.\nReactant: Hexafluorobenzene\nIntermediate: Hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene)\n\nStep 2: Intermolecular Cycloaddition\nThe highly strained hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene intermediate then reacts with cyclobutene. This is the second pericyclic reaction.\nReaction Type: Intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition. This reaction occurs between a double bond of the Dewar-benzene intermediate and the double bond of cyclobutene. It is also a 4-electron process, allowed under photochemical conditions.\nReactants: Hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene + Cyclobutene\nProduct: The final tricyclic compound.\n\nConclusion:\nBoth pericyclic reactions involved in this transformation are of the same kind.\n\"\"\"\n    \n    # Print the explanation\n    print(explanation)\n    \n    # Define the final answer\n    reaction1 = \"[2+2] cycloaddition (intramolecular)\"\n    reaction2 = \"[2+2] cycloaddition (intermolecular)\"\n    \n    # Print the final answer\n    print(\"The two pericyclic reactions are:\")\n    print(f\"1. {reaction1}\")\n    print(f\"2. {reaction2}\")\n\n    # Final answer in the required format\n    final_answer_text = \"An intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition followed by an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition.\"\n    print(f\"\\n<<< {final_answer_text} >>>\")\n\n# Execute the function to solve the problem\nsolve_chemistry_problem()\n```"
