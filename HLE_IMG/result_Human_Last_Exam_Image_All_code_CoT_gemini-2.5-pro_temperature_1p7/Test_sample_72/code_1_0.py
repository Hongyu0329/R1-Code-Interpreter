The transformation occurs in two sequential photochemically allowed pericyclic steps:

Step 1: Valence Isomerization of Hexafluorobenzene
Under photochemical conditions (hv), hexafluorobenzene first undergoes an intramolecular reaction to form hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene. This is the first pericyclic reaction.
Reaction Type: Intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition. This is a 4-electron process which is allowed photochemically.
Reactant: Hexafluorobenzene
Intermediate: Hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene)

Step 2: Intermolecular Cycloaddition
The highly strained hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene intermediate then reacts with cyclobutene. This is the second pericyclic reaction.
Reaction Type: Intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition. This reaction occurs between a double bond of the Dewar-benzene intermediate and the double bond of cyclobutene. It is also a 4-electron process, allowed under photochemical conditions.
Reactants: Hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene + Cyclobutene
Product: The final tricyclic compound.

Conclusion:
Both pericyclic reactions involved in this transformation are of the same kind.
