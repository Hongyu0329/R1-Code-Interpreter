Step-by-step analysis:
1.  The image is described as a "lost small deity of the past." This directly points to the theme of forgotten or 'fading religious beliefs'. The visual style, showing a ghostly, semi-transparent figure and an aged, weathered photo effect, evokes a sense of something ephemeral and not fully present.

2.  The poem extract, "Velvet fades / like a photochromic lens," uses the metaphor of fading to describe change and decay. This reinforces the theme of impermanence and the 'transient, passing nature of existence'.

3.  The series title, 'Phantasmagoria', refers to a sequence of dreamlike or ghostly images. This title supports the themes of ghosts, the past, and things that are not solid or permanent.

4.  Combining these elements, the two most prominent themes are the passing of time and existence, and the specific fading of old spiritual or religious beliefs.

5.  Comparing this with the answer choices:
    - A. Loss of memory and death: Plausible, but "fading religious beliefs" is more specific and directly mentioned.
    - B. The transient, passing nature of existence and the fading of religious beliefs: This choice perfectly aligns with both key themes identified in the analysis.
    - C. Impermanence of material objects and memory loss: A good fit, but it misses the explicit religious component.
    - D. Lost or obsolete technologies and the ghosts of the past: The technology reference is minor; the core subject is the deity, not the technology.
    - E. the fading of old religious beliefs and earthly death: "Transient nature" is a better description of the ethereal mood than the finality of "earthly death."

Conclusion: Option B provides the most accurate and complete summary of the themes presented.
