  This function solves the visual identification task.

  To re-identify the nyala, we focus on unique, unchanging features.
  The most reliable features for individual identification in nyalas are the stripe and spot patterns on their flanks, which are unique like a fingerprint.

  1.  **Target Analysis:** The target nyala has a specific pattern of white spots on its side. There is a dense cluster of spots towards the rear and another separate, looser group of spots located more towards the middle of the body. The horn shape, with its distinct curvature and yellow tips, is also a key feature.

  2.  **Comparison with Options:**
      - A: A younger individual with smaller horns. Incorrect.
      - B: The pattern of white spots on the flank is a precise match to the target. It has both the rear cluster and the forward, looser group of spots. The horn shape is also consistent. This is a very strong match.
      - C: Stripes are much bolder, and the spot pattern does not match. Incorrect.
      - D: Has spots on the flank, but the pattern is different. It lacks the forward group of spots seen on the target. Incorrect.
      - E: This animal has a white marking on its front leg that the target does not have. Incorrect.
      - F: The body is partially obscured, but the visible pattern does not appear to match the target.

  3.  **Conclusion:** The spot pattern on animal B is a unique and exact match to the target animal.
