    "Based on the architecture, which includes stepped gables and canal houses, as well as the presence of a canal and bicycles, the image is characteristic of the Netherlands. A reverse image search confirms the location is Groningen, Netherlands, specifically near the Vismarkt and the Hoge der A canal.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies the country from the image.\n  The visual cues in the image are:\n  1.  **Architecture:** The buildings feature stepped gables, which are a hallmark of Dutch Renaissance architecture.\n  2.  **Canals:** The prominent canal is typical of many cities in the Netherlands.\n  3.  **Bicycles:** Bicycles are a very common mode of transport in the Netherlands and can be seen in the background.\n  \n  These elements strongly suggest the photo was taken in the Netherlands.
