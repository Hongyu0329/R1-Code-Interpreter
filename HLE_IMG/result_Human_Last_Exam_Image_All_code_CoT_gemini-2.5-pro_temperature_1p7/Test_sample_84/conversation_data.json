    "My plan to identify the city is as follows:\n1.  First, I will analyze the provided image of the coat of arms to identify its key heraldic elements. The most distinctive features are the charges on the shield and its colors.\n2.  The shield is divided horizontally (per fess). The top field is blue (azure) and contains a yellow/gold crescent moon. The bottom field is yellow/gold (or) and features a black crab.\n3.  I will use these key elements—crab, crescent moon, blue and gold shield—as my primary search terms to find a matching or similar real-world coat of arms.\n4.  My research indicates that these elements precisely match the heraldic description (blazon) of the coat of arms of Ilfov County in Romania. It also matches the historical (interwar period) coat of arms of Constanța County, also in Romania.\n5.  The prompt asks for a *city*. While the emblem officially belongs to a county, the symbolism strongly connects to a city. The crab is a very fitting symbol for the major port city of Constanța, which is the seat of Constanța County. The connection to the landlocked Ilfov County is less symbolic and more administrative (they adopted the old, unused design).\n6.  Therefore, I'll conclude that the city with the most similar and historically relevant coat of arms is Constanța.\n7.  I will write a Python script to present this analysis and print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coat_of_arms_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the provided coat of arms and identifies the city\n    with a very similar emblem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the key features of the coat of arms from the image.\n    shield_division = \"Horizontally divided (per fess)\"\n    top_half_color = \"Blue (azure)\"\n    top_half_charge = \"Crescent moon (gold)\"\n    bottom_half_color = \"Gold (or)\"\n    bottom_half_charge = \"Crab (black)\"\n\n    print(\"Analysis of the Coat of Arms:\")\n    print(f\"- Shield Division: {shield_division}\")\n    print(f\"- Top Half: A {top_half_charge} on a {top_half_color} field.\")\n    print(f\"- Bottom Half: A {bottom_half_charge} on a {bottom_half_color} field.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the corresponding real-world emblem.\n    print(\"Identification:\")\n    print(\"The combination of these elements is very specific.\")\n    print(\"It matches the blazon (formal description) of the coat of arms for Ilfov County in Romania.\")\n    print(\"Historically, this same design was the coat of arms for Constanța County, Romania.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Connect the emblem to a specific city as requested.\n    print(\"Connecting to a City:\")\n    print(\"The prompt asks for a city, not a county.\")\n    print(\"The symbol of a crab is highly relevant to a coastal or port city.\")\n    print(\"Constanța is a major port city on the Black Sea and was the historical user of this county-level emblem.\")\n    print(\"The symbolism is much more strongly tied to Constanța than to the landlocked Ilfov County.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 4: Conclude and print the answer.\n    final_city = \"Constanța\"\n    print(f\"Conclusion: The city with a coat of arms very similar to the one in the image is Constanța.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer:\")\n    print(final_city)\n\n# Run the solver\nsolve_coat_of_arms_riddle()\n```\n<<<Constanța>>>"
