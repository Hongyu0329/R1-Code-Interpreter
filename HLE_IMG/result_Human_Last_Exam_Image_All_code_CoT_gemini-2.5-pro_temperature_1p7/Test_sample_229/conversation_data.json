    "This appears to be a lead sheet for a musical piece. Based on the musical style, chord progressions, and clues in the notation, I can identify the song.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Sheet Music:** I will examine the key signature, time signature, chord symbols (C, E7, F, G7, etc.), and melodic contour.\n2.  **Identify Stylistic Clues:** The syncopated rhythm, jazzy harmony (especially the use of dominant 7th chords like E7 as a secondary dominant), and the tempo marking (approx. 120 bpm) are characteristic of a specific genre.\n3.  **Interpret Notation:** The partially visible title at the top appears to be \"MODINHA\". Modinha is a genre of Brazilian sentimental ballad. However, the musical style of this piece is more aligned with Bossa Nova, a style that evolved from samba and jazz. The composer AntÃ´nio Carlos Jobim, a key figure in Bossa Nova, wrote a famous piece with this title.\n4.  **Confirm the Song:** I will compare the melody and chord progression on the sheet music with Jobim's \"Modinha\". The progression C -> E7 -> F -> F- -> C... is highly characteristic of this song.\n5.  **Formulate the Answer:** Based on the evidence, I will determine the title, musical style, and country of origin.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a simple Python script to print the final answer as requested.\n\n```python\ndef get_song_info():\n  \"\"\"\n  Provides information about the song based on analysis of the sheet music.\n  \"\"\"\n  title = \"Modinha\"\n  musical_style = \"Bossa Nova / Brazilian Jazz\"\n  country_of_origin = \"Brazil\"\n\n  print(f\"Title: {title}\")\n  print(f\"Musical Style: {musical_style}\")\n  print(f\"Country of Origin: {country_of_origin}\")\n\nget_song_info()\n```\n<<<Title: Modinha, Musical Style: Bossa Nova, Country of Origin: Brazil>>>"
