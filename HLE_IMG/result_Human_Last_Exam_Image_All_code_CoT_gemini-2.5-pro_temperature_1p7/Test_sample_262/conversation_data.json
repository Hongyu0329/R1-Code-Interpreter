    "The task is to determine which of the four Iridium(III) complexes are expected to have shorter lifetimes when used as emitters in Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs).\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n1.  **Analyze the Structures:** All four molecules are cationic Iridium(III) complexes. They share the same central Iridium ion and the same bidentate neutral ligand (4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine). The difference lies in the two cyclometalating ligands, which are variously fluorinated 2-phenylpyridine derivatives.\n2.  **Identify the Key Structural Difference:** The critical difference is the position of the fluorine (F) atoms on the phenyl ring of the cyclometalating ligand, specifically relative to the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond.\n    *   Let's inspect the carbon atom adjacent (ortho) to the Ir-C bond.\n    *   **Complex 1:** The two F atoms are in positions *meta* to the Ir-C bond. There is no *ortho*-fluorine.\n    *   **Complex 2:** The two F atoms are in positions *meta* and *para* to the Ir-C bond. There is no *ortho*-fluorine.\n    *   **Complex 3:** This complex has one F atom, and it is in the *ortho* position relative to the Ir-C bond.\n    *   **Complex 4:** This complex has three F atoms, one of which is in the *ortho* position relative to the Ir-C bond.\n3.  **Relate Structure to Lifetime in LECs:** The operational stability (and thus lifetime) of these emitters depends on their resistance to degradation under LEC operating conditions, which include high electric fields. While fluorination is often used to stabilize emitters in Organic LEDs (OLEDs), its effect can be different in LECs. For this class of complexes, a specific degradation mechanism has been identified that is dependent on the fluorine position.\n4.  **Apply Scientific Principle:** Research has shown that for these types of Ir(III) complexes in LECs, the presence of a fluorine atom *ortho* to the Ir-C bond is detrimental to the device lifetime. The high electric field in an operating LEC induces a geometric distortion in the excited state of the ortho-fluorinated complexes. This distorted structure provides a rapid, non-radiative pathway for the molecule to return to the ground state. This process not only quenches the desired light emission (lowering efficiency) but also facilitates chemical degradation, leading to a shorter operational lifetime.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Complexes that possess an ortho-fluorine atom are therefore expected to have shorter lifetimes in LEC applications. Based on our analysis in step 2, these are **Complex 3** and **Complex 4**.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this analysis to identify the correct complexes.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_complex_lifetimes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes four iridium complexes to determine which ones are expected\n    to have shorter lifetimes in Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Represent the key structural feature of each complex: the presence of an ortho-fluorine.\n    # True = has ortho-fluorine; False = does not.\n    complex_features = {\n        1: {'name': 'Complex 1', 'has_ortho_fluorine': False},\n        2: {'name': 'Complex 2', 'has_ortho_fluorine': False},\n        3: {'name': 'Complex 3', 'has_ortho_fluorine': True},\n        4: {'name': 'Complex 4', 'has_ortho_fluorine': True}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identifying the key structural difference.\")\n    print(\"The primary difference between the four complexes is the position of fluorine atoms on the phenylpyridine ligands.\")\n    print(\"Specifically, we check for a fluorine atom 'ortho' to the Iridium-Carbon bond.\\n\")\n    print(f\"Complex 3 has an ortho-fluorine: {complex_features[3]['has_ortho_fluorine']}\")\n    print(f\"Complex 4 has an ortho-fluorine: {complex_features[4]['has_ortho_fluorine']}\\n\")\n\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Applying the relevant scientific principle for LECs.\")\n    print(\"In Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells (LECs), complexes with an ortho-fluorine atom exhibit shorter lifetimes.\")\n    print(\"This is due to an electric-field-induced excited-state distortion that opens a pathway for non-radiative decay and chemical degradation.\\n\")\n\n    # Identify the complexes with shorter lifetimes based on the principle.\n    shorter_lifetime_complexes = []\n    for number, properties in complex_features.items():\n        if properties['has_ortho_fluorine']:\n            shorter_lifetime_complexes.append(number)\n    \n    shorter_lifetime_complexes.sort()\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Conclusion.\")\n    print(\"The complexes with the ortho-fluorine feature are expected to have shorter lifetimes.\")\n    # As requested, output the numbers in the final conclusion statement\n    print(f\"The identified complexes are: {shorter_lifetime_complexes[0]} and {shorter_lifetime_complexes[1]}.\")\n\nanalyze_complex_lifetimes()\n<<<J>>>"
