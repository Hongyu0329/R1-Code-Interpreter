    # Step 1: Transcription of the Hebrew phrase from the manuscript.
    # The Arabic text `بيوم השני שלח اذها عام` is transcribed to Hebrew.
    # بيوم -> ביום (on the day)
    # השני -> השני (the second)
    # שלח -> שלח (he sent)
    # اذها -> את ה (et ha-, "the", accusative direct object marker + definite article)
    # عام -> העם (the people)

    # Step 2: Identification of the biblical verse.
    # The phrase "שלח את העם" (he sent the people) is found in 2 Chronicles 7:10.
    # The author of the manuscript quotes this part of the verse but changes the date
    # from "the twenty-third day of the seventh month" to "the second day".
