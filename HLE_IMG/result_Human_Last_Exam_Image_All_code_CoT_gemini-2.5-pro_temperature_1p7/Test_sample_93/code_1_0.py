Step 1: Identify the key functional groups for fluorescence control.
Fluorescein's fluorescence is primarily controlled by its two phenolic hydroxyl (-OH) groups. Modifying these groups is the most effective way to "cage" the molecule by locking it in a non-fluorescent state. Modifying the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group has a minimal effect on fluorescence.

Step 2: Evaluate the caging and uncaging strategy.
The goal is cell-type specific uncaging using a genetically expressed enzyme.
- Caging: A good caging group should be attached to the -OH groups and render the molecule non-fluorescent. Acetyl groups are excellent for this, forming esters. Fluorescein diacetate is a well-known non-fluorescent, cell-permeable compound.
- Uncaging: The chemical bond formed during caging must be cleavable by a specific enzyme. Ester bonds are readily cleaved by esterase enzymes. By having cells genetically express a specific esterase, the uncaging can be confined to just those cells.

Step 3: Evaluate the given options.
- A: Chemically flawed. EDC/NHS chemistry is for COOH groups, not OH groups.
- B: Chemically and biologically sound. Describes the classic strategy of forming fluorescein diacetate (modifying OH groups with acetyl moieties) and using an esterase for uncaging. This is a proven method for cell-type specific labeling.
- C: Impractical. C-H functionalization is complex and enzymatic C-C cleavage for uncaging is not a standard method.
- D: Ineffective. Modifying the COOH group will not quench the fluorescence.
- E: Plausible but less common. Enzymatic cleavage of a cyclopropyl ether is much less common than ester hydrolysis.
- F: Ineffective and complex. Targets the wrong functional group (COOH) for caging.

Conclusion: Option B provides the most robust, well-established, and effective strategy.
