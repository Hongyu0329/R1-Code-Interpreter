    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the identity of the substituents (either H or CH3) at the five numbered positions in the product molecule. The problem provides the starting material and the reaction conditions, indicating a complex acid-catalyzed dehydration and rearrangement. However, the most direct way to answer the question is to carefully inspect the provided chemical structure of the product. We will interpret the standard conventions for drawing organic molecules (skeletal structures).\n\n1.  **Analyze Position 1:** The label '1' points to a substituent on the leftmost ring. This substituent is explicitly written as 'H3C', which represents a methyl group (CH3).\n2.  **Analyze Position 2:** The label '2' points to a wedged bond at a ring junction. In skeletal structures, a line extending from a saturated carbon, with no atom specified at its end, represents a methyl group (CH3).\n3.  **Analyze Position 3:** The label '3' points to a dashed bond at a ring junction. In skeletal structures, when a bond is shown from a saturated carbon but no atom is specified, it is assumed to be a hydrogen atom (H), especially when indicating stereochemistry.\n4.  **Analyze Position 4:** Similar to position 2, the label '4' points to a wedged bond at a ring junction, which represents a methyl group (CH3).\n5.  **Analyze Position 5:** Similar to position 3, the label '5' points to a dashed bond at a ring junction, representing a hydrogen atom (H).\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis of the product's structure, we can determine the identity of each substituent. The following Python code will print the result.\n\n```python\ndef find_substituents():\n  \"\"\"\n  Identifies the substituents at the numbered positions in the product molecule\n  based on standard chemical structure notation.\n  \"\"\"\n  substituents = {\n      1: \"CH3\",\n      2: \"CH3\",\n      3: \"H\",\n      4: \"CH3\",\n      5: \"H\"\n  }\n\n  # Print the result in the specified format\n  # We use a list to ensure the output order is as requested.\n  output_list = []\n  for i in range(1, 6):\n      output_list.append(f\"{i} = {substituents[i]}\")\n\n  print(\", \".join(output_list))\n\nfind_substituents()\n```\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
