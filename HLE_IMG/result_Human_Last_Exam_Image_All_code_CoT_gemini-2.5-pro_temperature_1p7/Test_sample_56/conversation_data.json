    "My plan is to first analyze the distinctive style and elements within the painting. The artwork is clearly surreal, featuring a room that opens into multiple contradictory environments: a glacial landscape, a stormy sea, and a city at night. Key motifs include a fireplace burning books, a picture of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, and a figure with leafy hair. I will use these specific descriptive elements to perform a reverse image search and a keyword-based search to identify the painting and its creator. Once the artist is identified, I will generate a Python script to print the name as requested.\n\n```python\n# This script will print the name of the artist of the painting.\nartist_name = \"Jacek Yerka\"\nprint(f\"The artist of the painting is: {artist_name}\")\n```\n<<<Jacek Yerka>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Please name the artist of the following painting:\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
