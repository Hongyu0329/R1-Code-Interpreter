# Here is the plan:
# 1. Determine the status of the species in image pair A. The left image shows a diverse understory, characteristic of a native habitat. The right image shows a dense monoculture of garlic mustard, a classic sign of invasion. Thus, A corresponds to option 3 (right invaded).
# 2. Determine the status of the species in image pair B. The left image shows a dense, aggressive stand of lupine along a roadside, typical of its invasive behavior. The right image shows sparser growth in a disturbed area, more akin to its role as a pioneer species in its native range. Thus, B corresponds to option 4 (left invaded).
# 3. Determine the status of the species in image pair C. The plant is papaya, a pioneer species native to the American tropics. Both the young plant in the open, gravelly area (left) and the mature plant in the lusher area (right) represent plausible scenarios within its native range. Neither depicts a problematic invasion. Thus, C corresponds to option 1 (both native).
# 4. Combine the indices for A, B, and C into the final answer string.
# 5. Print the final answer sequence.

# The identified index for image A
answer_for_A = 3

# The identified index for image B
answer_for_B = 4

# The identified index for image C
answer_for_C = 1

# Print the final result in the format "A, B, C"
print(f"{answer_for_A}, {answer_for_B}, {answer_for_C}")
