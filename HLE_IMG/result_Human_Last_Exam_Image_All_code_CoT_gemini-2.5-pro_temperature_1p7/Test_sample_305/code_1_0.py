    This function identifies the product based on the historical clues provided.
    
    Clues:
    1. Audience: Women war workers in Britain during WWII.
    2. Claim: Helped overcome "inherent limitations".
    3. Name: Must be French-derived.

    Reasoning:
    The French cosmetics company "Bourjois" ran advertising campaigns during WWII
    targeting women workers. The ads suggested that using their products helped
    women maintain their femininity (e.g., avoiding 'mannish hands') while
    performing 'a man's job', which fits the theme of overcoming a limitation.
    The name "Bourjois" is authentically French.
