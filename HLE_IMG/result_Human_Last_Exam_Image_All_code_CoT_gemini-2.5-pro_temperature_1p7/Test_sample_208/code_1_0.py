    Solves the riddle by simulating the strange clock hands.

    The riddle's rules are interpreted as follows:
    1.  The clock is a "twisted sight", so we test counter-clockwise (CCW) motion.
    2.  The clock face has 12 positions (0-11).
    3.  Hour hand moves 3 positions CCW per tick (velocity = -3).
    4.  Minute hand "gains" a quarter turn (3 positions), meaning its relative
        speed is 3 positions/tick faster in the direction of motion.
        So its velocity is -6 positions/tick CCW.
    5.  A "tick" is assumed to be one hour.
