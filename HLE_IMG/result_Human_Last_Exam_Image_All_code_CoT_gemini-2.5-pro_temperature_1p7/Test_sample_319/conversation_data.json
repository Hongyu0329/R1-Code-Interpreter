    "My thinking process to identify the phenomenon shown in the image is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visuals**: The image consists of two plots.\n    *   The top plot is a spectrogram, which shows the intensity of different frequencies over time. Time is on the x-axis, frequency on the y-axis, and intensity is shown by color (brighter means more intense).\n    *   The bottom plot is a waveform, showing the amplitude of a sound signal over time.\n2.  **Interpret the Plots**:\n    *   **Initial State (Left side)**: The spectrogram shows a single, strong horizontal line, indicating a pure tone of constant frequency. The waveform below confirms this with a regular, clean sine wave shape.\n    *   **Interruption (Middle)**: A vertical blur appears in the spectrogram. This represents a sound with a wide range of frequencies lasting for a very short time, which is characteristic of a burst of noise (like a click, static, or a cough). The waveform at this point becomes complex and irregular.\n    *   **Final State (Right side)**: After the noise burst, the spectrogram shows two distinct horizontal lines, indicating that the sound is now a combination of two different pure tones. The corresponding waveform is more complex than the initial sine wave, which is consistent with the superposition of two frequencies.\n3.  **Identify the Illusion**: The user's prompt mentions that this is an illusion similar to the Necker Cube, related to a common perceptual ability. This suggests the brain is \"filling in\" or misinterpreting some part of the sensory information.\n    *   The setup (a continuous sound interrupted by noise) is the classic experiment demonstrating the **auditory continuity illusion**.\n    *   In this illusion, when a sound is interrupted by a short burst of a different sound (typically noise), listeners perceive the original sound as continuing uninterrupted *through* the noise. The brain essentially \"fills in\" the missing piece of the first sound.\n    *   This is a fundamental aspect of auditory perception that helps us hear continuous sounds, like speech or music, in noisy environments. A specific form of this related to speech is called the **phonemic restoration effect**. Given the use of pure tones, \"auditory continuity illusion\" is the more general and accurate term here.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will provide the name of the phenomenon using a simple Python script to meet the output requirements.\n\n```python\ndef solve_phenomenon_puzzle():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the name of the perceptual phenomenon\n  depicted in the provided image (spectrogram and waveform).\n\n  The image shows a continuous tone that is interrupted by a burst of noise.\n  Listeners typically perceive the tone as continuing through the noise,\n  an auditory illusion that demonstrates the brain's ability to \"fill in\"\n  missing sensory information.\n  \"\"\"\n  phenomenon_name = \"Auditory continuity illusion\"\n  print(f\"The name of the phenomenon shown in the image is: {phenomenon_name}\")\n\nsolve_phenomenon_puzzle()\n```\n<<<Auditory continuity illusion>>>"
