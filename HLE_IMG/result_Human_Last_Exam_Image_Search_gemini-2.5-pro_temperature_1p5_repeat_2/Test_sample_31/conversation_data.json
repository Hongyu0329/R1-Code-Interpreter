    "The knot depicted in the image is known as the 8₁₈ knot. The Rasmussen invariant, often denoted as s(K), is a tool in knot theory that provides information about the topology of a knot. For the 8₁₈ knot, the Rasmussen s-invariant is 0.\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant is a significant development in knot theory, derived from Khovanov homology. It serves as a homomorphism from the knot concordance group to the integers and gives a lower bound for the smooth 4-genus of a knot. For alternating knots like 8₁₈, the Rasmussen invariant is equal to the knot signature, which is also 0 in this case.\n\nThe 8₁₈ knot is also known by other names, including the Carrick mat, and it is recognized for its appearance as a decorative knot.\n\n<<<0>>>"
