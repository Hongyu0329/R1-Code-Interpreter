    "The image provided is of the Martin Woldson Theater at The Fox in Spokane, Washington.\n\nOn October 12, 2023, the venue hosted a chamber soir√©e by the Spokane Symphony. A concert calendar also shows that the musical group The Mountain Goats played at the same venue a few days prior on October 9, 2023.\n\nThere appears to be no record of a single, named musical artist performing on the specific date of October 12, 2023, but rather a performance by the resident symphony orchestra.\n\n<<<Spokane Symphony>>>"
