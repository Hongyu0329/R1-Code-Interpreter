    "The circled notes in measure 8 of Mozart's Fantasy in D minor, K. 397, form a **vii°⁷** chord.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the harmonic analysis:\n*   **Key Signature:** The piece is in D minor.\n*   **Notes in Measure 8:** The notes played by both hands are C-sharp, E, G, and B-flat.\n*   **Chord Identification:** When stacked in thirds, these notes (C♯-E-G-B♭) create a C-sharp fully diminished seventh chord, commonly written as C♯°⁷.\n*   **Roman Numeral Analysis:** In the key of D minor, C-sharp is the leading tone (the seventh scale degree, raised). A fully diminished seventh chord built on the leading tone functions as a dominant harmony, creating a strong pull to the tonic (D minor). The Roman numeral for a leading-tone fully diminished seventh chord in a minor key is **vii°⁷**. The chord is in root position as the bass note is C-sharp, the root of the chord.\n\nTherefore, the accurate Roman numeral for the chord in measure 8 is vii°⁷.\n\n<<<vii°⁷>>>"
