    "To determine the total current flowing through the circuit, a step-by-step analysis of the circuit's configuration is necessary. This involves calculating the equivalent resistance of the different branches and then applying Ohm's Law.\n\n### Circuit Analysis\n\nFirst, the provided circuit diagram needs to be broken down into its fundamental components and connections:\n*   A voltage source (V2) supplies 1 Volt to the entire circuit.\n*   The circuit consists of two main branches connected in parallel to the voltage source.\n\n**Left Branch Analysis:**\nThis branch contains resistors R1 (3 Ω), R2 (7 Ω), and R3 (9 Ω). These three resistors are arranged vertically. Crucially, there is a wire that connects the positive terminal of the voltage source directly to the node between resistor R2 and resistor R3. This wire acts as a short circuit across the series combination of R1 and R2. Current follows the path of least resistance, and an ideal wire has zero resistance. Consequently, the current will bypass R1 and R2 entirely, flowing through the shorting wire and then through R3.\n\nTherefore, the total resistance of the left branch is simply the resistance of R3, which is **9 Ω**.\n\n**Right Branch Analysis:**\nThis branch consists of resistors R7 (100 Ω) and R8 (100 Ω) connected in series. The total resistance of resistors in series is the sum of their individual resistances.\n\n*   Resistance of the right branch = R7 + R8 = 100 Ω + 100 Ω = **200 Ω**.\n\n### Calculation of Total Current\n\nNow that the resistance of each parallel branch is known, the total equivalent resistance of the circuit can be calculated. For two parallel resistors, the formula for equivalent resistance (R_eq) is:\n\n1/R_eq = 1/R_left + 1/R_right\n\nPlugging in the values:\n1/R_eq = 1/9 Ω + 1/200 Ω\n1/R_eq = (200 + 9) / (9 * 200) = 209 / 1800 Ω\nR_eq = 1800 / 209 Ω ≈ 8.61 Ω\n\nWith the total equivalent resistance, the total current (I_total) flowing from the voltage source can be calculated using Ohm's Law (V = IR), which can be rearranged to I = V/R.\n\n*   I_total = V2 / R_eq\n*   I_total = 1 V / (1800 / 209 Ω)\n*   I_total = 209 / 1800 A\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n\n*   I_total ≈ 0.1161 amperes, or 116.1 milliamperes.\n\nAlternatively, the total current can be found by calculating the current in each branch separately and then adding them together, as the total current in a parallel circuit is the sum of the currents in each branch.\n\n*   Current in the left branch (I_left) = V2 / R_left = 1 V / 9 Ω ≈ 0.1111 A\n*   Current in the right branch (I_right) = V2 / R_right = 1 V / 200 Ω = 0.005 A\n*   Total current (I_total) = I_left + I_right ≈ 0.1111 A + 0.005 A = 0.1161 A\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<0.1161 A>>>"
