    "The correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata is **vii°/V**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the harmonic analysis:\n*   **Key Signature:** The movement is in C minor.\n*   **Notes in Measure 30:** The notes that make up the chord in measure 30 are F-sharp, A, and C, which form an F-sharp diminished triad.\n*   **Function of the Chord:** The F-sharp diminished chord functions as a secondary leading-tone chord. In the key of C minor, the dominant chord is G major (V). The leading tone to G is F-sharp. Therefore, the F-sharp diminished chord (vii°) resolves to the G major chord (V).\n*   **Roman Numeral:** This relationship is notated as **vii°/V**, which is read as \"seven diminished of five.\" This indicates the leading-tone chord of the dominant key area.\n\nThe use of secondary dominants and leading-tone chords is a common characteristic of Beethoven's music, adding harmonic interest and tension.\n\n<<<vii°/V>>>"
