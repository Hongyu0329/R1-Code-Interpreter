    "The provided image displays the emission spectrum of Uranium. This is confirmed by multiple scientific sources that show and discuss the emission spectra of uranium and its compounds. For instance, one source explicitly mentions the emission spectra of atomic uranium. Others delve into detailed studies of uranium's spectral properties and its use in identifying uranium species. The complex line spectrum shown in the image is characteristic of heavy elements like uranium.\n\n<<<Uranium>>>"
