    "The figure leaving the chariot is the mythological Greek princess Hippodamia. This red-figure Apulian loutrophoros, a type of vase used for bath water before a wedding, depicts a famous scene from Greek mythology: the chariot race between Pelops and Hippodamia's father, King Oenomaus.\n\nThe key elements in the vase painting that lead to this identification are:\n*   **The Chariot Race for Marriage:** King Oenomaus, Hippodamia's father, declared that any suitor who wished to marry his daughter must defeat him in a chariot race. Those who lost would be put to death. Pelops accepted the challenge.\n*   **The Figures:** The driver of the chariot is Pelops, who is identifiable by his Eastern-style attire, including an embroidered chiton and a Phrygian cap. He is carrying away Hippodamia after his victory. The figure lying on the ground is the defeated and killed King Oenomaus. The winged figure above is Nike, the goddess of victory, signifying Pelops's triumph.\n*   **Artistic Style:** The vase is attributed to the White Sakkos Painter (c. 320â€“310 B.C.), an artist known for this ornate style and use of added colors like white. The style is characteristic of Apulian vase painting from Southern Italy.\n\nHippodamia's role in the myth varies. In some versions, she is a willing partner who helps Pelops win by persuading her father's charioteer, Myrtilus, to sabotage the king's chariot. In the vase's depiction, her gesture of unveiling herself before Pelops signifies her acceptance as his bride.<<<Hippodamia>>>"
