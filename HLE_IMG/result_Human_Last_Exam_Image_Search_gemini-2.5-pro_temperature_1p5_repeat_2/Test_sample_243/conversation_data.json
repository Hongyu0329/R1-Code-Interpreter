    "The plant shown in the image is a cultivar of Buerger's holly known as *Ilex buergeri 'Okinoshima'*. This specific variety, distinguished by its prominent white, net-like veins on the leaves, originates from the Japanese island of Okinoshima.\n\nThe island of Okinoshima is located about 60 kilometers off the coast of Kyushu, Japan, and is part of the Munakata region. It is considered a sacred site and has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The entire island is regarded as a kami, or a divine being in the Shinto religion, and access is strictly restricted, with women being entirely forbidden from setting foot on it. Only a small number of Shinto priests reside there to maintain the shrine.\n\n<<<Okinoshima>>>"
