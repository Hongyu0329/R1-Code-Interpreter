    "Based on a paleographic analysis of the Byzantine Greek manuscript, the word is transcribed as **ἐθάλουν**.\n\nThis word is the third-person plural imperfect active indicative of the common Ancient Greek verb *θάλλω* (thállō), which means \"to bloom,\" \"to thrive,\" or \"to flourish.\" Therefore, the word translates to **\"they were blooming\"** or **\"they were thriving.\"**\n\nThe transcription is arrived at by interpreting the initial letter, which resembles a \"μ\" (mu), as a stylized or cursive form of \"ε\" (epsilon) common in Byzantine-era manuscripts. The rest of the letters—θ (theta), α (alpha), λ (lambda), ου (a ligature for omicron and upsilon), and ν (nu)—are more straightforward to identify. The accent mark is an acute accent, and the mark above the alpha is a smooth breathing, though its placement on a non-initial vowel is likely a scribal peculiarity. The ending \"-ουν\" is a later form of the classical \"-ον\" for this verb tense."
