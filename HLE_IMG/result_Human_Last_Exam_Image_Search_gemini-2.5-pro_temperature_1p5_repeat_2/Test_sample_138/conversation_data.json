    "Based on the visual evidence and knowledge of insect anatomy, here is the identification of the sexes for each pair.\n\n**Pair A: *Coelioxys* (Cuckoo Bees)**\n\nThe key feature for distinguishing the sexes in *Coelioxys* bees is the shape of the abdomen.\n*   **A (Left):** This bee has a distinctly pointed, cone-shaped abdomen. This is characteristic of a female *Coelioxys*, which uses this specialized abdomen to pierce the nests of its host bees (like leafcutter bees) to lay her eggs.\n*   **A (Right):** This bee has a blunter abdomen, which appears to end in multiple spines or teeth. This is characteristic of a male *Coelioxys*.\n\nTherefore, the pair is **Female, Male (F, M)**.\n\n**Pair B: *Polistes* (Paper Wasps)**\n\nIn many *Polistes* species, males can be distinguished from females by their curled or hooked antennae tips.\n*   **B (Left):** This wasp has distinctly curled antennae tips. This identifies it as a male.\n*   **B (Right):** This wasp's antennae are straight at the tips. This identifies it as a female.\n\nTherefore, the pair is **Male, Female (M, F)**.\n\n**Pair C: *Megachile* (Leafcutter Bees)**\n\nThese bees belong to the family Megachilidae, a group where females carry pollen on hairs on the underside of their abdomen (abdominal scopa) rather than on their legs. This fits the prompt's description. Sexual differences are found in the antennae and abdomen.\n*   **C (Left):** This bee has very long antennae and a hairier face. Male leafcutter bees are noted to have longer antennae than females.\n*   **C (Right):** This bee has shorter antennae. The bright yellow underside of the abdomen indicates a full scopa of pollen, a feature exclusive to females. The abdomen tip is also more pointed, another female trait.\n\nTherefore, the pair is **Male, Female (M, F)**.\n\nCombining the answers for A, B, and C:\n\n*   A: F, M (4)\n*   B: M, F (3)\n*   C: M, F (3)\n\nThe correct sequence of indices is 4, 3, 3.\n\n<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
