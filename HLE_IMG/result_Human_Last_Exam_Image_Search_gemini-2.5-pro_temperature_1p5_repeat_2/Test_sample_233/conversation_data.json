    "The Ingvar runestone depicted in the image fragment is identified as the Gripsholm Runestone, which has the Rundata ID **Sö 179**.\n\nThis specific runestone is one of approximately 26 Ingvar runestones, which were raised to commemorate those who died during a Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled. The Gripsholm Runestone is notable for its inscription, which mentions Harald, Ingvar's brother. The stone is located at Gripsholm Castle in Mariefred, Södermanland, Sweden.\n\nThe inscription on the stone is carved in the Younger Futhark runic alphabet. A partial transliteration of the visible runes in the image fragment confirms its identity as Sö 179. The full inscription tells the story of Tóla, who raised the stone in memory of her son Harald, Ingvar's brother, who died in Serkland (likely the area around the Caspian Sea). The carving style is classified as Pr2 (Ringerike style).\n\nThe stone was discovered in the early 1820s and was used as a threshold in the cellar of the Gripsholm Castle tower before being retrieved and fully deciphered.\n\n<<<Sö 179>>>"
