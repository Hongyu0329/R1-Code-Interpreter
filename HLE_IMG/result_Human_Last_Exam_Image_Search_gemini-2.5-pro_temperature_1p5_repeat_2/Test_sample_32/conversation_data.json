    "The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that helps distinguish them at a glance is the curvature of the seta.\n\nIn *Grimmia montana*, the sporophyte features a straight seta, which holds the capsule in an erect position. Descriptions consistently note that the capsules are on short, straight or erect setae.\n\nConversely, *Grimmia curviseta* is characterized by a curved or arcuate seta. The species name itself, *curviseta*, points to this feature. This curvature gives the capsule a bent or arching appearance relative to the stem.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward way to differentiate the two species when they have sporophytes is to observe the seta: it is straight in *Grimmia montana* and curved in *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n<<<The key difference is the seta: straight in *Grimmia montana* and curved (arcuate) in *Grimmia curviseta*.>>>"
