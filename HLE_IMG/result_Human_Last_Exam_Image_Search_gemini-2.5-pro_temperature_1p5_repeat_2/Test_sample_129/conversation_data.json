    "Based on the analysis of the image, the protein depicted is **Cathepsin K**.\n\nThis identification is confirmed by multiple sources showing the same crystal structure. Specifically, the image corresponds to the crystal structure of human Cathepsin K.\n\nCathepsin K is a lysosomal cysteine protease, a type of enzyme that degrades proteins. It is predominantly expressed in osteoclasts, which are cells responsible for bone resorption, the process of breaking down bone tissue. Due to its crucial role in degrading type I collagen, the main protein component of the bone matrix, Cathepsin K is a significant area of study in understanding bone remodeling. Its ability to break down collagen and gelatin allows it to degrade bone and cartilage.\n\nThe expression of Cathepsin K can be stimulated by inflammatory cytokines released after tissue injury. Imbalances in its activity are associated with several diseases. For instance, a deficiency in Cathepsin K causes pycnodysostosis, a rare genetic disorder characterized by brittle bones and short stature, while its overexpression is linked to conditions like osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. Because of its role in bone resorption, it has been a major target for the development of drugs to treat osteoporosis.\n\n<<<Cathepsin K>>>"
