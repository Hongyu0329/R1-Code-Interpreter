    "The bryophyte shown in the image belongs to the genus ***Ptychomnion***.\n\nThis distinctive moss is easily identified by its unique foliage. The leaves are strongly pleated or folded (rugose) and wrap around the stems, giving the shoots a \"braided\" or \"pipe-cleaner\" appearance. The name *Ptychomnion* itself comes from the Greek words *ptychios* (folded) and *mnion* (moss), directly referencing this key feature.\n\nA very common and widespread species within this genus is *Ptychomnion aciculare*, which is commonly known as pipe-cleaner moss or springy turf-moss. This species is known to form extensive, springy mats on the ground, fallen logs, and tree bases in wet forests. While the plant appears bright green when wet, it often takes on a yellow-brown hue as it dries out. The genus *Ptychomnion* is the only one in the family Ptychomniaceae.\n\n<<<Ptychomnion>>>"
