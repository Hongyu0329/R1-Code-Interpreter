    "To find the longest R-R interval on the provided ECG rhythm strip, one must first understand the standard measurements of ECG paper. The paper speed is noted as 25 mm/sec. This means:\n*   Each small square (1 mm) on the horizontal axis represents 0.04 seconds.\n*   Each large square (5 mm) on the horizontal axis represents 0.20 seconds.\n\nThe R-R interval is the time between consecutive R-waves, which are the highest peaks in the QRS complex. By visually inspecting the entire rhythm strip, the longest pause between heartbeats can be identified. This pause is most prominent in the fourth row of the strip, beginning just after the timestamp \"0:06:08\".\n\nTo calculate the duration of this interval in seconds:\n1.  **Identify the R-waves** on either side of the long pause.\n2.  **Count the number of squares** between the peaks of these two R-waves. The interval spans approximately 7 large squares plus 2 additional small squares.\n3.  **Calculate the time:**\n    *   7 large squares = 7 x 0.20 seconds = 1.40 seconds\n    *   2 small squares = 2 x 0.04 seconds = 0.08 seconds\n    *   Total time = 1.40 seconds + 0.08 seconds = 1.48 seconds.\n\nAlternatively, one can count the total number of small squares (1 mm boxes) within the interval. There are 37 small squares. Multiplying this by the time per small square gives the interval in seconds: 37 squares x 0.04 seconds/square = 1.48 seconds.\n\n<<<1.48>>>"
