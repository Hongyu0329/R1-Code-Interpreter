    "Based on the visual analysis and the information from the search results, the rock specimens can be identified as follows:\n\n*   **H is Scoria:** This specimen is reddish-brown and highly vesicular (porous with bubble-like cavities). Scoria is a volcanic rock known for these characteristics, typically dark in color (brown, black, or reddish) and can be a product of lava flows or explosive eruptions. Its appearance is consistent with scoria, which forms when gas-rich magma erupts and cools rapidly.\n\n*   **I is Breccia:** This rock is composed of large, angular fragments of other rocks cemented together in a finer-grained matrix. This texture is characteristic of breccia, a clastic sedimentary rock. The angularity of the fragments indicates they were not transported far from their source before being lithified.\n\n*   **J is Pumice:** This specimen is light-colored and has a very high porosity with small vesicles, giving it a frothy appearance. Pumice is a low-density, extrusive volcanic rock that forms from gas-rich, viscous magma. Its light color distinguishes it from the typically darker scoria.\n\n*   **K is Pegmatite:** This rock is characterized by its very large, interlocking crystals, which are easily visible. Pegmatite is an igneous rock known for its exceptionally coarse-grained texture, with crystals often larger than 1 cm. It commonly has a composition similar to granite, consisting of minerals like quartz, feldspar, and mica. The large crystal size is due to very slow cooling from a water-rich magma.\n\n<<<H is Scoria, I is Breccia, J is Pumice, and K is Pegmatite.>>>"
