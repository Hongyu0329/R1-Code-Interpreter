    "### Determining the Molecular Formula of the Product\n\nTo determine the molecular formula of the final product, we will analyze the reaction sequence step by step, identifying the starting material, intermediates, and the transformations occurring at each stage.\n\n#### **Step 1: Starting Material Analysis**\n\nThe starting material is a complex bicyclic lactam. Its structure can be identified as a derivative of 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one. It has two substituents: a para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group on the nitrogen atom and a trifluoromethyl (CF3) group on the carbon-carbon double bond.\n\nLet's calculate its molecular formula:\n*   The core bicyclic structure, 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one, consists of C7H5F3NO (C1(CH), C4(CH), C5(CH), C6(C-CF3), C7(CH2), N2(N), C3(C=O)).\n*   The PMB group (-CH2C6H4OCH3) has a formula of C8H9O.\n*   Combining these parts, the starting material's molecular formula is C(7+8)H(5+9)F3N1O(1+1) = **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n#### **Step 2: Formation of Intermediate 1**\n\nThe first reaction uses Ceric Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) in an acetonitrile/water mixture. CAN is a common reagent used for the oxidative cleavage of para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) protecting groups from amines and alcohols. In this step, the PMB group is removed from the nitrogen atom, which then becomes an N-H bond.\n\n*   **Transformation:** Removal of the PMB group (C8H9O) and addition of a hydrogen atom.\n*   **Change in Formula:** -C8H9O + H = -C8, -H8, -O1\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 1:** C(15-8)H(14-8)F3NO(2-1) = **C7H6F3NO**. This corresponds to 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n\n#### **Step 3: Formation of Intermediate 2**\n\nThe second reaction is a catalytic hydrogenation using Palladium on carbon (Pd/C) and hydrogen gas (H2) in methanol (MeOH). This reaction is a standard method for the reduction of carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. The C=C double bond in the bicyclic ring system is reduced, while the lactam (cyclic amide) functional group remains unaffected under these conditions.\n\n*   **Transformation:** Addition of two hydrogen atoms (H2) across the double bond.\n*   **Change in Formula:** +H2\n*   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 2:** C7H(6+2)F3NO = **C7H8F3NO**. This corresponds to 6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n\n#### **Step 4: Formation of the Final Product**\n\nThe final step involves heating Intermediate 2 with 4 N hydrochloric acid (HCl). These conditions (strong acid and heat) cause the hydrolysis of the lactam ring. The cyclic amide bond (C-N) is cleaved, consuming one molecule of water (H2O) in the process. This opens the ring to form a molecule containing both an amino group (-NH2, which will be protonated to -NH3+ in acid) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n\n*   **Transformation:** Hydrolysis (addition of H2O) of the lactam ring.\n*   **Change in Formula:** +H2O\n*   **Molecular Formula of Final Product:** C7H(8+2)F3NO(1+1) = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n\nThe final product is a substituted aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid, specifically a derivative of 3-amino-5-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the molecular formula of the final product is C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
