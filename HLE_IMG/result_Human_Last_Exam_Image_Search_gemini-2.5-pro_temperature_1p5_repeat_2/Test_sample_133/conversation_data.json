    "Based on the detailed analysis of the provided mass spectrum, the compound is identified as a chlorinated propene derivative with two phenyl groups.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Molecular Ion Peak:** The mass spectrum shows a cluster of peaks at the highest mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) at 262, 264, and 266. This pattern is characteristic of a compound containing two chlorine atoms, due to the natural isotopic abundance of ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl (approximately 3:1 ratio). The peak at m/z 262 represents the molecular ion (M⁺) containing two ³⁵Cl atoms.\n\n*   **Determination of the Chemical Formula:** The monoisotopic molecular weight of the compound is 262 u. Subtracting the mass of two ³⁵Cl atoms (2 * 35 = 70 u) leaves a mass of 192 u for the rest of the molecule. This corresponds to a hydrocarbon skeleton of C₁₅H₁₂ (15 * 12 + 12 * 1 = 192). Therefore, the molecular formula of the compound is C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂. This molecular weight has been confirmed for a compound with this formula in the chemical literature.\n\n*   **Analysis of Fragmentation:**\n    *   The **base peak** (the most intense peak) is at m/z 225. This corresponds to a loss of 37 u from the molecular ion. This is not a simple fragmentation. The most plausible pathway is the initial loss of a chlorine radical ([M-Cl]⁺), which forms the significant peak at m/z 227, followed by the loss of a hydrogen molecule (H₂) to form a more stable, aromatized ion at m/z 225.\n    *   A prominent peak at m/z 227 corresponds to the loss of a chlorine radical (³⁵Cl) from the molecular ion, forming the [C₁₅H₁₂Cl]⁺ fragment.\n    *   The peak at m/z 190 results from the subsequent loss of the second chlorine atom from one of the major fragment ions.\n\n*   **Structure and IUPAC Name:** The formula C₁₅H₁₂Cl₂ and the fragmentation pattern strongly suggest a structure based on a propene backbone with two chlorinated phenyl groups attached. This leads to the identification of the compound as **1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)prop-1-ene**.\n\nThus, the compound corresponding to the presented mass spectrum is:\n**1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)prop-1-ene**\n\n<<<1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)prop-1-ene>>>"
