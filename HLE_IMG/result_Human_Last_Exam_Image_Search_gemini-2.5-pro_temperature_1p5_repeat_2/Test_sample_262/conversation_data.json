    "### Non-fluorinated Complexes Exhibit Shorter Lifetimes\n\nBased on the analysis of the provided chemical structures, complexes and are expected to exhibit shorter lifetimes as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). This is attributed to the lack of fluorine substituents on their cyclometalating ligands.\n\n**Detailed Analysis of the Complexes:**\n\n*   **Complex 1 and Complex 2:** These two complexes are structurally identical, representing `[Ir(ppy)2(dtbpy)]+`, where 'ppy' is 2-phenylpyridine and 'dtbpy' is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine. Critically, the ppy ligands in these complexes are not fluorinated.\n*   **Complex 3:** This complex is `[Ir(4',5'-F2ppy)2(dtbpy)]+`. The cyclometalating ligands are substituted with two fluorine atoms each at the 4' and 5' positions of the phenyl ring.\n*   **Complex 4:** This complex is `[Ir(2',4'-F2ppy)2(dtbpy)]+`. The cyclometalating ligands are substituted with two fluorine atoms each at the 2' and 4' positions of the phenyl ring.\n\n**The Role of Fluorination in LEC Stability:**\n\nThe operational stability and lifetime of iridium(III) complexes in LECs are significantly influenced by the strength of the bonds within the complex, particularly the iridium-carbon (Ir-C) bond of the cyclometalating ligand. This bond is often the most labile and a primary site for degradation during device operation.\n\nFluorination of the phenyl ring on the cyclometalating ligand has a profound stabilizing effect due to the high electronegativity of fluorine. This electron-withdrawing effect strengthens the Ir-C bond, making the complex more resistant to thermal and electrochemical degradation.\n\nConversely, complexes lacking these fluorine substituents, such as complexes and, possess a comparatively weaker Ir-C bond. This makes them more susceptible to degradation pathways, which in turn leads to a shorter operational lifetime for the LEC device. While it was once a common belief that any fluorine content compromised lifetime, recent studies have shown that strategically placed fluorine can be beneficial. However, the fundamental principle remains that the non-fluorinated `[Ir(ppy)2(dtbpy)]+` is less stable than its fluorinated counterparts. For green-emitting complexes, it has been observed that increasing the fluorine content can sometimes lead to shorter lifetimes, but the non-fluorinated versions are generally less stable than modestly fluorinated ones. Studies have shown that devices using tetra-fluorinated complexes can degrade faster than bis-fluorinated ones, but both are typically more stable than their non-fluorinated analogues.\n\nTherefore, the non-fluorinated complexes, and, are predicted to have the shortest lifetimes among the four options.\n\n<<<E>>>"
