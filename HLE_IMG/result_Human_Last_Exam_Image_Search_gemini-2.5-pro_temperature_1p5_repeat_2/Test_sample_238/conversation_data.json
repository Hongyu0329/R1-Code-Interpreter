    "The small, black, pin-like organisms growing on the surface of the larger shelf fungus are a type of parasitic fungus, commonly known as a pin mold.\n\nBased on the appearance of erect stalks with tiny black heads, this organism is likely a species from the order Mucorales. A common example that parasitizes other fungi in this manner is *Spinellus fusiger*, also known as Bonnet Mould. These types of fungi are referred to as mycoparasites, meaning they are fungi that prey on other fungi.\n\nThe process involves the parasitic fungus, often called a pin mold, growing its fungal threads (hyphae) into the host mushroom to draw nutrients. It then produces the visible hair-like reproductive stalks, called sporangiophores, which have small, spherical, black structures at the top called sporangia that contain spores. When the sporangial wall breaks down, spores are released to be dispersed by elements like wind and water.\n\nThe larger host fungus appears to be a species of bracket fungus, possibly from the *Trametes* genus, like Turkey Tail, given its shape and concentric zones. Various pin molds, including those from the *Rhizopus* and *Mucor* genera, are known to grow on a wide variety of fungi and other organic materials.\n\nWhile visually interesting, the presence of pin mold is often a sign of decay in the host mushroom.\n\n<<<Spinellus fusiger (Pin Mold)>>>"
