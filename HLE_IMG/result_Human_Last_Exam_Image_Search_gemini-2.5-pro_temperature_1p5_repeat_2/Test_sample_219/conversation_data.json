    "Based on the analysis of the provided graph, the synchronized bursts, which appear as vertical bands of high firing activity across many electrodes, occur at the following approximate timestamps (taking the center of the burst):\n\n*   **Burst 1:** 3 s\n*   **Burst 2:** 18 s\n*   **Burst 3:** 36 s\n*   **Burst 4:** 49 s\n\nThe inter-burst interval (IBI) is the time between consecutive bursts. The calculation is as follows:\n\n*   **IBI 1:** 18 s - 3 s = 15 s\n*   **IBI 2:** 36 s - 18 s = 18 s\n*   **IBI 3:** 49 s - 36 s = 13 s\n\nTo calculate the average inter-burst interval, we sum these intervals and divide by the number of intervals:\n\nAverage IBI = (15 s + 18 s + 13 s) / 3 = 46 s / 3 â‰ˆ 15.33 s\n\nRounding this to two significant figures results in an average inter-burst interval of 15 seconds.\n\n<<<15>>>"
