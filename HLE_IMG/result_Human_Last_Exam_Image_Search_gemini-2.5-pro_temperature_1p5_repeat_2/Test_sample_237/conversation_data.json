    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. It is an insect, specifically a species of longhorn beetle.\n\nBased on its appearance—a narrow black body with long antennae and a distinct reddish-orange band across the upper portion of its wing cases—it is identified as the Black-striped Longhorn Beetle. The scientific name for this beetle is *Stenurella melanura*.\n\nThis species is common throughout most of Europe. The coloration can vary between sexes, with females having reddish elytra (wing cases) while males have yellow-brown elytra. They are often found on flowers from May through September, where they feed on pollen and nectar. The larvae of this beetle develop in the decaying wood of both deciduous and coniferous trees.\n\n<<<Stenurella melanura>>>"
