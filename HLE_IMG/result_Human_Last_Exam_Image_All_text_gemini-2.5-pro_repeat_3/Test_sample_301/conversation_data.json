The composition is bold, with strong contrasts and powerful brushwork in the rock formation.\n    *   **Artist Identification:** The forceful, angular brushwork and dramatic composition are characteristic of **Pan Tianshou (潘天寿)**, a 20th-century master known for his monumental and powerful flower-and-bird and landscape paintings.\n\n3.  **Top-Right:**\n    *   **Style:** This is a realist oil portrait of a young woman from the Yi ethnic group, identifiable by her attire. The painting displays a high level of technical skill, with a focus on capturing the subject's personality and the texture of her clothing.\n    *   **Artist Identification:** This is a well-known work by **Pang Maokun (庞茂琨)**, a leading figure in Chinese contemporary realist painting. The painting is titled \"A Glimpse of the Yi Girl\" (《彝女的顾盼》).\n\n4.  **Middle-Left:**\n    *   **Style:** This is a work of Chinese calligraphy in a fluid and expressive cursive script (草书). The strokes are connected and flow with a continuous, graceful rhythm.\n    *   **Artist Identification:** This elegant and flowing cursive script is representative of the style of **Lin Sanzhi (林散之)**, a celebrated 20th-century calligrapher often hailed as the \"sage of cursive script.\"\n\n5.  **Center:**\n    *   **Style:** This is a modern painting that combines abstract elements with traditional Chinese aesthetics. It features two large circles (red and orange, suggesting suns or moons) above a minimalist landscape rendered in an ink wash style.\n    *   **Artist Identification:** This unique fusion of Western abstraction and Eastern lyricism is the signature style of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**. He excelled at deconstructing landscapes into geometric forms, lines, and color blocks while preserving their spiritual essence. This work is his famous \"Reminiscence of Jiangnan\" (《忆江南》).\n\n6.  **Middle-Right:**\n    *   **Style:** This is a piece of calligraphy written in an archaic seal script (篆书). The characters are uniform, stable, and possess a solid, powerful structure.

While best known for his paintings of shrimp, crabs, and flowers, he was also a master calligrapher and seal carver.\n\n7.  **Bottom-Left:**\n    *   **Style:** This calligraphy is in a very dynamic and powerful \"wild cursive\" script (狂草). The strokes are sweeping, energetic, and dominate the page with a sense of grandeur and unrestrained momentum.\n    *   **Artist Identification:** This iconic and highly recognizable calligraphic style belongs to **Mao Zedong (毛泽东)**. His calligraphy is famous for its immense scale, power, and revolutionary spirit.\n\n8.  **Bottom-Middle:**\n    *   **Style:** This is a realist oil painting depicting a young woman with a pensive, melancholic expression, set against a background of dark leaves.
