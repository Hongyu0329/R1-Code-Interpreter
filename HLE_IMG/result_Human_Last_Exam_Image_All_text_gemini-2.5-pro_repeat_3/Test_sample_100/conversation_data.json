    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    *   The starting material is a bicyclic molecule. It has a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane core structure, which is also known as a norbornane skeleton.\n    *   Specifically, it's a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one derivative. This means one carbon in the six-membered ring is replaced by a nitrogen atom (position 2), and there's a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 3, forming a lactam (cyclic amide). There is a double bond between positions 5 and 6.\n    *   The nitrogen atom is protected with a PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) group. The formula of a PMB group is C8H9O (-CH2-C6H4-OCH3).\n    *   There is a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) attached to the double bond at position 5.\n    *   Let's determine the molecular formula of the starting material.\n        *   The core bicyclic structure without substituents except the CF3 is C7H5F3NO. (C atoms: C1, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7 and the C of CF3; H atoms: 1H at C1, 1H at C4, 1H at C6, 2H at C7; F atoms: 3; N atom: 1; O atom: 1).\n        *   Adding the PMB group (C8H9O) to the nitrogen.\n        *   Total C = 7 + 8 = 15\n        *   Total H = 5 + 9 = 14\n        *   Total F = 3\n        *   Total N = 1\n        *   Total O = 1 (carbonyl) + 1 (PMB ether) = 2\n        *   Starting Material Formula: C15H14F3NO2.\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Reaction: CAN, ACN/H2O**\n    *   **Reagents:** CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) is a strong oxidizing agent.\n    *   **Transformation:** In the presence of functional groups like PMB ethers or PMB-protected amines, CAN selectively cleaves the PMB group. This is a standard deprotection method. The PMB group is oxidized and removed, and the nitrogen atom gets a hydrogen atom.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate 1):** The PMB group is replaced by a hydrogen atom. The rest of the molecule remains unchanged.\n    *   **Change in Formula:** We remove the PMB group (-C8H9O) and add a hydrogen atom (+H). The net change is the loss of a C8H8O fragment.\n    *   **Formula of Intermediate 1:**\n        *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n        *   H: 14 - 9 + 1 = 6\n        *   F: 3\n        *   N: 1\n        *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   Formula of Intermediate 1: C7H6F3NO.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Reaction: Pd/C, H2, MeOH**\n    *   **Reagents:** Palladium on carbon with hydrogen gas is a standard catalyst for hydrogenation.\n    *   **Transformation:** This reaction reduces carbon-carbon double bonds to single bonds. The C=C double bond in the bicyclic ring will be hydrogenated. Amide carbonyls and C-F bonds are generally stable under these conditions.\n    *   **Product (Intermediate 2):** The double bond between C5 and C6 is saturated by the addition of two hydrogen atoms.\n    *   **Change in Formula:** Addition of one molecule of H2.\n    *   **Formula of Intermediate 2:**\n        *   C: 7\n        *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n        *   F: 3\n        *   N: 1\n        *   O: 1\n        *   Formula of Intermediate 2: C7H8F3NO.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Third Reaction: 4 N HCl, 70 Â°C**\n    *   **Reagents:** Strong aqueous acid (HCl) with heat.\n    *   **Transformation:** These are conditions for the hydrolysis of an amide (or in this case, a lactam). The amide bond (N-C=O) is cleaved by the addition of a water molecule. The lactam ring opens up.\n    *   **Product:** The nitrogen atom becomes an amino group (-NH2), and the carbonyl carbon becomes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). The product is an amino acid. Under the acidic conditions, the amino group will be protonated to an ammonium salt (-NH3+), but the molecular formula is conventionally written for the neutral molecule.\n    *   **Change in Formula:** Addition of one molecule of H2O across the amide bond.\n    *   **Formula of the Final Product:**\n        *   C: 7\n        *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n        *   F: 3\n        *   N: 1\n        *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n        *   Final Product Formula: C7H10F3NO2.\n\n**Summary of the transformations and formulas:**\n*   **Starting Material:** C15H14F3NO2\n*   **Step 1 (PMB Deprotection):** -> **Intermediate 1:** C7H6F3NO (Loss of C8H8O)\n*   **Step 2 (Hydrogenation):** -> **Intermediate 2:** C7H8F3NO (Addition of H2)\n*   **Step 3 (Hydrolysis):** -> **Final Product:** C7H10F3NO2 (Addition of H2O)\n\nThe structure of the final product is a substituted cyclopentane carboxylic acid with an amino group and a trifluoromethyl group, confirming the calculated molecular formula.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
