    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular structure and identify chiral centers.**\nFirst, we need to understand the connectivity of the atoms to identify the main carbon chain and the chiral centers. By inspecting the drawing, we can trace the carbon skeleton. The molecule contains an amine group (-NH2), a hydroxyl group (-OH), an ethyl group (-CH2CH3), and several methyl groups (-CH3).\n\nThe most plausible structure that fits the drawing is `3-ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-methylpentan-1-amine`.\nLet's number the carbon chain according to IUPAC nomenclature, where the carbon attached to the principal functional group (the amine) gets the lowest possible number.\n*   **C1**: The carbon in the -CH2NH2 group.\n*   **C2**: The carbon bonded to C1, which also has a methyl group. This is a chiral center.\n*   **C3**: The carbon bonded to C2, which has an ethyl group. This is a chiral center.\n*   **C4**: The carbon bonded to C3, which has a hydroxyl group and is also bonded to C5. This is a chiral center.\n*   **C5**: The terminal methyl group bonded to C4.\n\nSo, we have three chiral centers to analyze: C2, C3, and C4.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the absolute configuration of each chiral center (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules).**\n\n**Analysis of C3 (the middle chiral center):**\n1.  **Identify groups:** The groups attached to C3 are:\n    *   The chain towards C4: -CH(OH)CH3\n    *   The chain towards C2: -CH(CH3)CH2NH2\n    *   An ethyl group: -CH2CH3\n    *   A hydrogen atom: -H (implied)\n2.  **Assign priorities:**\n    1.  -CH(OH)CH3 (The carbon is bonded to O, C, H. Highest priority due to the oxygen atom).\n    2.  -CH(CH3)CH2NH2 (The carbon is bonded to C, C, H).\n    3.  -CH2CH3 (The carbon is bonded to C, H, H).\n    4.  -H (Lowest priority).\n3.  **Determine configuration:**\n    *   In the drawing, the C2-C3-C4 backbone is in the plane of the paper.\n    *   The ethyl group (priority 3) is on a wedge (pointing out).\n    *   The implied hydrogen (priority 4) must be on a dash (pointing in).\n    *   With the lowest priority group pointing away, we trace the path from priority 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   The path goes from the left (group 1) to the right (group 2) to the top/wedge (group 3). This is a counter-clockwise direction.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C3 is **S**.\n\n**Analysis of C2 (the rightmost chiral center):**\n1.  **Identify groups:** The groups attached to C2 are:\n    *   -CH2NH2\n    *   The rest of the chain: -CH(Et)CH(OH)CH3\n    *   A methyl group: -CH3\n    *   A hydrogen atom: -H (implied)\n2.  **Assign priorities:**\n    1.  -CH2NH2 (The carbon is bonded to N, H, H. Highest priority due to the nitrogen atom).\n    2.  -CH(Et)CH(OH)CH3 (The carbon is bonded to C, C, H).\n    3.  -CH3 (The carbon is bonded to H, H, H).\n    4.  -H (Lowest priority).\n3.  **Determine configuration:**\n    *   In the drawing, the bond to C3 (group 2) is in the plane. The implied bond to H (group 4) is also in the plane.\n    *   The -CH2NH2 group (priority 1) is on a wedge (pointing out).\n    *   The -CH3 group (priority 3) is on a dash (pointing in).\n    *   Since the lowest priority group (H) is in the plane, we can use the swap rule. We mentally swap the H (group 4) with the group pointing away, which is -CH3 (group 3).\n    *   After the swap, H is dashed. Now we trace the path 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   The path goes from the wedged -CH2NH2 (group 1) -> the in-plane chain (group 2) -> the now in-plane -CH3 (group 3). This traces a counter-clockwise circle.\n    *   A counter-clockwise direction means S. Since we performed one swap, we must reverse the result.\n    *   Therefore, the original configuration at C2 is **R**.\n\n**Analysis of C4 (the leftmost chiral center):**\n1.  **Identify groups:** The groups attached to C4 are:\n    *   -OH\n    *   The rest of the chain: -CH(Et)CH(Me)CH2NH2\n    *   A methyl group: -CH3\n    *   A hydrogen atom: -H (implied)\n2.  **Assign priorities:**\n    1.  -OH (Highest priority due to oxygen).\n    2.  -CH(Et)CH(Me)CH2NH2 (The rest of the chain).\n    3.  -CH3\n    4.  -H (Lowest priority).\n3.  **Determine configuration:**\n    *   The drawing for this center is unconventional, showing both the -OH group (priority 1) and the -CH3 group (priority 3) on dashes. The bond to C3 (priority 2) is in the plane. For the carbon to be tetrahedral, the implied hydrogen (priority 4) must be on a wedge (pointing out).\n    *   With the lowest priority group (H) pointing towards the viewer, we trace the path 1 -> 2 -> 3.\n    *   The path goes from the dashed -OH (group 1) -> the in-plane C3 (group 2) -> the dashed -CH3 (group 3). This traces a clockwise circle.\n    *   A clockwise direction means R. However, since the lowest priority group is pointing towards us, we must reverse the result.\n    *   Therefore, the configuration at C4 is **S**.\n\n**Step 3: Combine the results.**\nCombining the configurations for all chiral centers in the order of the IUPAC numbering (C2, C3, C4), we get the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n*   C2 is **R**\n*   C3 is **S**\n*   C4 is **S**\n\nThe full absolute configuration is (2R, 3S, 4S).\n\n<<(2R, 3S, 4S)>>>"
