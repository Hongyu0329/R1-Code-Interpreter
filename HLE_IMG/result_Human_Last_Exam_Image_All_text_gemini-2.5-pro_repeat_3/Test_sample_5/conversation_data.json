    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the piece.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observations**\n1.  **Instrumentation:** The music is written on a grand staff (a treble clef staff and a bass clef staff joined by a brace), which is standard for piano music.\n2.  **Tempo:** The tempo marking at the top left is a quarter note = 80, which indicates a moderate tempo (Andante or Moderato).\n3.  **Key Signature:** There are two sharps (F# and C#) in the key signature. This corresponds to the key of D major or its relative minor, B minor.\n4.  **Time Signature:** The time signature is 4/4, also known as common time.\n\n**Step 2: Analyzing the Musical Content**\n1.  **Measures 1-2 (The Opening):**\n    *   **Dynamics:** The piece begins softly, marked with a *p* (piano).\n    *   **Left Hand (Harmony):** The left hand plays a C major chord (C-E-G) in the first half of measure 1, followed by a G major chord (G-B-D). This progression (C-G) in the key of D major is a â™­VII - IV progression, a common and evocative harmonic choice often found in film and video game music.\n    *   **Right Hand (Melody):** The melody starts on the note A and ascends through B, C#, D, E, F#, G (natural), and A. This is an A Mixolydian scale (a major scale with a flattened 7th degree), which creates a distinctive, slightly melancholic yet hopeful sound against the C major chord. This specific melodic and harmonic combination is a very strong clue.\n\n2.  **Measure 3 (The Shift):**\n    *   **Dynamics:** There is a sudden and dramatic shift to *f* (forte).\n    *   **Texture:** The musical texture changes completely. The right hand plays rapid sixteenth-note block chords, while the left hand plays broken octaves. This creates a feeling of intensity and urgency, contrasting sharply with the gentle opening. This dramatic shift is a key characteristic of the piece.\n\n3.  **Subsequent Measures (Development):**\n    *   **Measures 4-7:** The dynamic level changes to *mp* (mezzo-piano) and the sixteenth-note chordal pattern continues, developing the harmony. Accidentals like A# and G# appear, suggesting modulations and leaning heavily into the B minor side of the key.\n    *   **Measure 8:** The dynamic increases to *mf* (mezzo-forte) as the intense, chord-heavy texture continues, building tension.\n    *   **Measure 11:** A notable feature is the upward glissando (marked *gliss.*) on a C# diminished seventh chord, which is a highly virtuosic and dramatic flourish.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesis and Identification**\n*   The combination of a gentle, melodic piano opening featuring the A Mixolydian mode over a C major chord is highly characteristic of the main theme for the character Roxas from the *Kingdom Hearts* video game series.\n*   The immediate, drastic shift to a fast, powerful, and virtuosic section with dense chords matches the structure of Roxas's battle theme.\n*   This specific piece, which combines the melancholic elements of \"Roxas's Theme\" with a more intense battle arrangement, is known as \"The Other Promise\". It was composed by Yoko Shimomura for the game *Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix*.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the key signature, the unique opening melody and harmony, the dramatic structural shift from quiet to intense, and the virtuosic piano writing, the piece is \"The Other Promise\" from the *Kingdom Hearts* series.\n\n<<<The Other Promise (from Kingdom Hearts)>>>"
