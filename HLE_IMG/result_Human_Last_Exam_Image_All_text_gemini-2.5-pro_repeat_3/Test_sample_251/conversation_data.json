    "*   **Step 1: Understand the ECG Paper Calibration**\n    *   The ECG is recorded at a standard speed of 25 mm/sec, as indicated at the top left of the strip.\n    *   The ECG paper has a grid where each small square is 1 mm and each large square is 5 mm.\n    *   To calculate the time for a given distance, we use the formula: Time (s) = Distance (mm) / Speed (mm/s).\n    *   Time for one small square (1 mm) = 1 mm / 25 mm/s = 0.04 seconds.\n    *   Time for one large square (5 mm) = 5 mm / 25 mm/s = 0.2 seconds.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the R-waves and R-R Intervals**\n    *   The R-waves are the tall, sharp, upward spikes of the QRS complexes.\n    *   The R-R interval is the time duration (horizontal distance) between the peaks of two consecutive R-waves.\n    *   We need to scan the entire rhythm strip to find the longest R-R interval.\n\n*   **Step 3: Locate the Longest R-R Interval**\n    *   Visually scanning the strip reveals that the rhythm is mostly regular, but there are several distinct pauses where a beat seems to be dropped. These pauses represent the longest R-R intervals.\n    *   One of these long pauses is clearly visible in the fourth row of the ECG, between the 4th and 5th QRS complexes. Other similar pauses exist elsewhere on the strip (e.g., at the junction of the second and third rows, and in the fifth row). We will measure one of these as they all appear to be of similar length.\n\n*   **Step 4: Measure the Longest R-R Interval**\n    *   Let's focus on the pause in the fourth row.\n    *   The peak of the R-wave just before the pause aligns almost perfectly with a thick vertical grid line.\n    *   The peak of the R-wave immediately after the pause also aligns almost perfectly with another thick vertical grid line.\n    *   Counting the number of large squares between these two R-wave peaks, we can see there are exactly 7 large squares.\n\n*   **Step 5: Calculate the Time in Seconds**\n    *   Since one large square represents 0.2 seconds, we can calculate the duration of the interval.\n    *   Longest R-R interval = (Number of large squares) × (Time per large square)\n    *   Longest R-R interval = 7 × 0.2 seconds\n    *   Longest R-R interval = 1.4 seconds.\n\n<<<1.4>>>"
