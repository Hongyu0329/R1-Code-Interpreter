The high regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to the pronounced asymmetry of the bicyclic Münchnone intermediate formed from N-acetylproline. In this intermediate, the two reactive termini of the 1,3-dipole, C2 and C4, are sterically and electronically distinct—C2 bears a methyl group while C4 is a bridgehead carbon in a fused ring system. This significant asymmetry directs the cycloaddition with the asymmetric alkyne to proceed via a single, highly favored transition state, resulting in the formation of only one regioisomer (Product B).

Reactions 1 and 2 provide the rationale for this conclusion by demonstrating the outcome in a contrasting, nearly symmetric system. The Münchnone intermediate from the acyclic N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine has identical methyl groups at both C2 and C4. The labeling experiment in Reaction 2 shows that there is "no regioselectivity observed," which indicates that these two nearly identical termini are indistinguishable to the incoming alkyne, leading to a non-regioselective cycloaddition and a 1:1 mixture of regioisomeric products (Product A). Therefore, the results from Reactions 1 and 2 establish that the symmetry of the Münchnone intermediate dictates the regioselectivity of the reaction. This highlights that the enforced, rigid asymmetry of the proline-derived intermediate in Reaction 3 is the key factor responsible for its high regioselectivity.
