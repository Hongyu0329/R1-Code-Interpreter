    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe goal is to calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by comparing the \"Baseline\" scenario (Table 1) with the \"Proposed\" scenario (Table 2).\n\nThe formula for percentage reduction is:\n`((VMT_Baseline - VMT_Proposed) / VMT_Baseline) * 100%`\n\nTo solve this, we need to calculate the total VMT for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **VMT vs. PMT:** The question asks for **Vehicle** Miles Traveled (VMT), not Person Miles Traveled (PMT). This means we are concerned with the miles traveled by the car itself, regardless of how many people are inside. Therefore, the \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" figures (2.8 and 3) are not relevant to this specific calculation.\n2.  **Car Modes:** \"Car VMT\" includes both categories of car travel shown: 'car, 1 occupant' and 'car, with more than 2 occupants'. We must sum the shares of these two modes.\n3.  **Weighted Calculation:** The VMT from each distance category must be weighted by the 'share of total trips' for that category. For example, the 0-3 mile category represents 48% of all trips, so its contribution to the total VMT is significant.\n4.  **Using Average Distance:** For each distance category, we must use the provided 'Average trip distance' (1, 4, 7.5, and 20 miles) to calculate the miles for that segment.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\nTo calculate the total VMT for each scenario, we will compute a VMT index. The VMT for each distance category is found by:\n`(Share of Total Trips) x (Average Trip Distance) x (Total Share of Car Trips for that category)`\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Total Car VMT for the Baseline Scenario (Table 1)**\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 25% + 28% = 53%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.48 (share of trips) * 1 (avg. distance) * 0.53 (car share) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 38% + 43% = 81%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.22 * 4 * 0.81 = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 40% + 45% = 85%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.14 * 7.5 * 0.85 = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 42% + 47% = 89%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.16 * 20 * 0.89 = 2.8480\n\n*   **Total Baseline VMT Index:** 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = **4.7077**\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Total Car VMT for the Proposed Scenario (Table 2)**\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 1% + 2% = 3%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.48 (share of trips) * 1 (avg. distance) * 0.03 (car share) = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 8% + 19% = 27%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.22 * 4 * 0.27 = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 14% + 27% = 41%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.14 * 7.5 * 0.41 = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    *   Total Car Share = 16% + 33% = 49%\n    *   VMT Contribution = 0.16 * 20 * 0.49 = 1.5680\n\n*   **Total Proposed VMT Index:** 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = **2.2505**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction in Car VMT**\n\n*   **VMT Reduction:** 4.7077 (Baseline) - 2.2505 (Proposed) = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction:** (2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100% = 0.52195... * 100% â‰ˆ 52.2%\n\nThe percentage of Car VMT that can be reduced is approximately 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
