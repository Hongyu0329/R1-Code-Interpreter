    "*   **Step 1: Identify the components of the molecule and the question being asked.**\n    The image shows a coordination complex with a central Iridium (Ir) cation. This cation is coordinated by three ligands. There are several phenyl rings attached as substituents to the main ligand framework. These substituent phenyl rings are labeled G, H, J, K, and L. The question asks which of these phenyl rings can rotate freely in solution.\n\n*   **Step 2: Understand the principle of free rotation for chemical groups.**\n    Rotation around a single bond (in this case, the carbon-carbon single bond connecting the substituent phenyl ring to the main ligand) is considered \"free\" if the energy barrier to rotation is low. High energy barriers are typically caused by steric hindrance, which is the repulsive interaction between bulky groups that are brought close to each other during rotation. To determine which rings can rotate freely, we must analyze the steric environment around the bond for each ring.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the steric environment of each substituent phenyl ring.**\n    We need to look at the groups attached to the atoms adjacent (ortho) to the point of attachment for each phenyl ring.\n\n    *   **Ring H:** It is attached to position C4 of ring A. The adjacent positions on ring A are C3 and C5.\n        *   Position C3 is attached to pyridine ring B.\n        *   Position C5 is attached to the bulky phenyl ring K.\n        The presence of the large phenyl group K immediately adjacent to ring H will cause significant steric clash, preventing free rotation.\n\n    *   **Ring K:** It is attached to position C5 of ring A. The adjacent positions on ring A are C4 and C6.\n        *   Position C4 is attached to the bulky phenyl ring H.\n        *   Position C6 is directly bonded to the very large Iridium center, which is part of a crowded coordination sphere.\n        Ring K is \"sandwiched\" between two very bulky groups (phenyl ring H and the Ir center). Its rotation will be severely restricted.\n\n    *   **Ring J:** It is attached to position C4 of ring C. The adjacent positions on ring C are C3 and C5.\n        *   Position C3 is attached to pyridine ring D.\n        *   Position C5 is attached to the bulky phenyl ring L.\n        Similar to ring H, the adjacent phenyl group L will create a large steric barrier, preventing free rotation of ring J.\n\n    *   **Ring L:** It is attached to position C5 of ring C. The adjacent positions on ring C are C4 and C6.\n        *   Position C4 is attached to the bulky phenyl ring J.\n        *   Position C6 is directly bonded to the Iridium center.\n        Similar to ring K, ring L is flanked by a bulky phenyl group (J) and the very bulky Ir center. Its rotation will be severely restricted.\n\n    *   **Ring G:** It is attached to position C2 of ring C. The adjacent positions on ring C are C1 (which is unsubstituted and thus has a small hydrogen atom) and C3.\n        *   Position C1 has a hydrogen atom.\n        *   Position C3 is attached to the pyridine ring D.\n        Ring G is flanked by a small hydrogen atom on one side and the pyridine ring D on the other. While the pyridine ring D does cause some steric hindrance, the presence of a small hydrogen atom on the other side provides a region of low steric repulsion. Compared to rings H, J, K, and L, which are all flanked by at least one other bulky phenyl group or the Ir center, ring G experiences significantly less steric hindrance.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclude based on the comparative analysis.**\n    By comparing the steric environments, we can rank the rotational freedom of the rings:\n    *   Rings K and L are the most hindered.\n    *   Rings H and J are also highly hindered.\n    *   Ring G is the least hindered by a significant margin.\n    Therefore, in the context of the question, \"free rotation\" applies to the ring with the lowest rotational barrier. Ring G is the only one that fits this description.\n\n*   **Step 5: Select the corresponding answer choice.**\n    The analysis concludes that only ring G can rotate freely. This corresponds to option K.\n\n<<<K>>>"
