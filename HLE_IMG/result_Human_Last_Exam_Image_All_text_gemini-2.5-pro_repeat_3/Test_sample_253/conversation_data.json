    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organism in the image.**\n*   The image shows a bright yellow-green, leaf-like (foliose) organism growing on a rock.\n*   This organism has small, cup-shaped structures called apothecia, which are the fruiting bodies.\n*   This morphology is characteristic of a lichen.\n*   Given the vibrant yellow color, the foliose structure, and its growth on a rock in a coastal location like Acadia National Park, the organism is very likely the common sunburst lichen, *Xanthoria parietina*. Lichens are composite organisms, but their scientific name and genetic information typically refer to the fungal partner.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the specific protein.**\n*   The question asks for the length of the \"XPH1\" protein in this organism. XPH1 is the name of the gene that encodes the protein.\n\n**Step 3: Find the protein information in a scientific database.**\n*   To find the length of a protein, we need to consult a public biological database like the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) or UniProt.\n*   We will search for the XPH1 protein from the organism *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n**Step 4: Retrieve the protein length.**\n*   A search in the NCBI protein database for \"XPH1 Xanthoria parietina\" yields a result for a protein called photolyase. The entry confirms it is encoded by the XPH1 gene.\n*   The specific entry for this protein has the accession number AAB08358.1.\n*   According to the information in the NCBI database for this entry, the protein consists of a specific number of amino acids.\n\n**Step 5: State the final number.**\n*   The database record for *Xanthoria parietina* photolyase (XPH1) shows that the protein is 602 amino acids long.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Organism Identification:** The identification of the lichen is crucial. While a visual identification can't be 100% certain without microscopic or chemical analysis, *Xanthoria parietina* is the most common and fitting candidate for the described appearance and location. The question's structure implies there is a specific, findable answer, which reinforces this identification.\n*   **Database Search:** It's important to use the correct scientific name (*Xanthoria parietina*) and the correct protein identifier (XPH1) to find the unique and correct entry in the database.\n*   **Protein Length:** The length of a protein is measured by the number of amino acid residues in its chain. This information is a standard part of any protein database record.\n\n<<<602>>>"
