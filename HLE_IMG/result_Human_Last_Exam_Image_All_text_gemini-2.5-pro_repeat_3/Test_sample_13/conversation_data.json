    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and Rules of Kakuro**\nThe goal is to fill the white squares with digits from 1 to 9. The numbers in the black squares are clues. A clue above a diagonal line is the sum for the vertical run of cells below it (\"down\"). A clue below a diagonal line is the sum for the horizontal run of cells to its right (\"across\"). A key rule is that within any single run (one sum), all digits must be unique.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Key Clues and the Cells They Apply To**\nThe question asks for the numbers in the two top-most white squares. Let's call these squares A (left) and B (right).\n\n1.  **Across clue for A and B:** The clue to the left of A and B is 15. This is for a run of two cells. So, `A + B = 15`.\n2.  **Down clue for the column containing A:** The clue above A is 17. By visually inspecting the grid, this column consists of 5 white squares. So, the sum of 5 unique digits in this column is 17.\n3.  **Down clue for the column containing B:** The clue above B is 29. This column consists of 4 white squares. So, the sum of 4 unique digits in this column is 29.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Constraints from the Clues**\nWe analyze the possible combinations of unique digits for these sums.\n\n*   **For the column with sum 17 (5 cells):** The minimum sum of 5 unique digits is 1+2+3+4+5 = 15. To get a sum of 17, the combinations are limited:\n    *   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 17\n    *   1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 17\n    This means the digits in this column must be from one of these two sets. Therefore, cell A must be one of the digits: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}.\n\n*   **For the column with sum 29 (4 cells):** The maximum sum of 4 unique digits is 9+8+7+6 = 30. To get a sum of 29, there is only one possible combination:\n    *   9 + 8 + 7 + 5 = 29\n    This means the digits in this column must be {5, 7, 8, 9}. Therefore, cell B must be one of these digits.\n\n*   **For the row with sum 15 (2 cells, A and B):** The possible pairs for {A, B} are:\n    *   {6, 9}\n    *   {7, 8}\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Constraints to Find A and B**\nNow we test the possible pairs for {A, B} against the constraints we found for their respective columns.\n\n*   **Test Pair {7, 8}:**\n    *   If A=7, B=8: A=7 is in the possible set for its column ({1,2,3,4,5,6,7}). B=8 is in the possible set for its column ({5,7,8,9}). This seems possible.\n    *   If A=8, B=7: A=8 is NOT in the possible set for its column ({1,2,3,4,5,6,7}). So, this case is impossible.\n\n*   **Test Pair {6, 9}:**\n    *   If A=6, B=9: A=6 is in the possible set for its column ({1,2,3,4,5,6,7}). B=9 is in the possible set for its column ({5,7,8,9}). This also seems possible.\n    *   If A=9, B=6: A=9 is NOT in the possible set for its column ({1,2,3,4,5,6,7}). So, this case is impossible.\n\nWe are left with two potential solutions for (A, B): (7, 8) or (6, 9). We need more information to decide.\n\n**Step 5: Use Intersecting Clues to Eliminate a Possibility**\nLet's look at the row below A and B.\n*   The clue for this horizontal run is 22. It spans 3 cells. Let's call them X, D, and E, where D is in the same column as A, and E is in the same column as B. So `X + D + E = 22`.\n*   The possible unique digit sets for a sum of 22 in 3 cells are {5, 8, 9} and {6, 7, 9}.\n*   Cell D is in the column with sum 17, and E is in the column with sum 29. So, `A ≠ D` and `B ≠ E`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the two remaining possibilities for (A, B):\n\n*   **Scenario 1: (A, B) = (7, 8)**\n    *   `A=7`. The set of digits for A's column must contain 7, so it is {1, 2, 3, 4, 7}.\n    *   `D` must be one of the other digits in this set, so `D` ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4}.\n    *   The set of digits for the row containing D, {X, D, E}, must be {5, 8, 9} or {6, 7, 9}.\n    *   `D` must be in {1, 2, 3, 4} AND in ({5, 8, 9} or {6, 7, 9}). There are no common digits between these sets. This creates a contradiction.\n    *   Therefore, (A, B) cannot be (7, 8).\n\n*   **Scenario 2: (A, B) = (6, 9)**\n    *   `A=6`. The set of digits for A's column must contain 6, so it is {1, 2, 3, 5, 6}.\n    *   `D` must be one of the other digits in this set, so `D` ∈ {1, 2, 3, 5}.\n    *   `B=9`. The set of digits for B's column is {5, 7, 8, 9}.\n    *   `E` must be one of the other digits in this set, so `E` ∈ {5, 7, 8}.\n    *   The set for the row {X, D, E} must be {5, 8, 9} or {6, 7, 9}.\n    *   `D` must be in {1, 2, 3, 5} AND in ({5, 8, 9} or {6, 7, 9}). The only possibility is `D=5`, which means the set for the row is {5, 8, 9}.\n    *   If `D=5`, then `E` must be in {5, 7, 8} AND {5, 8, 9}. Since `E ≠ D`, `E` must be 8.\n    *   If `D=5` and `E=8`, then `X` must be 9 to sum to 22.\n    *   This gives a consistent solution: A=6, B=9, D=5, E=8, X=9. All constraints are satisfied.\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer**\nThe only possibility that works is {A, B} = {6, 9}. The two numbers in the top white squares are 6 and 9.\n\n<<<6,9>>>"
