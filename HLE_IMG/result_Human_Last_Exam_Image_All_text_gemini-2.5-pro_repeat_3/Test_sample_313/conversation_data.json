    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\n*   The first clue states: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows a man with a beard (on the right) receiving a trophy from an older man (on the left) at what appears to be an awards ceremony.\n*   A search for major awards ceremonies around June 20, 2019, reveals the NHL Awards were held in Las Vegas on June 19, 2019. The date in the clue is likely the date the photo was published or a day after the event.\n*   The man receiving the award is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov, a Russian professional ice hockey player.\n*   At the 2019 NHL Awards, Nikita Kucherov had an exceptional night, winning three major individual trophies: the Hart Memorial Trophy (league MVP), the Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player voted by peers), and the Art Ross Trophy (top point scorer).\n*   In sports, achieving three notable feats in one game or season is commonly known as a \"hat trick\". Kucherov's accomplishment of winning these three prestigious awards is widely referred to as an \"awards hat trick\".\n*   Therefore, the image depicts the person who achieved a \"hat trick\". The clue \"X Y is pictured...\" can be interpreted metaphorically as the achievement itself being pictured, represented by the person who accomplished it. This makes \"Hat Trick\" a strong candidate for \"X Y\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   The second clue states: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   We need to see if \"Hat Trick\" fits this description.\n*   Historically, mercury nitrate was used in the process of making felt for hats. This process, called \"carroting,\" involved treating animal fur with a mercury solution to make the fibers mat together more easily.\n*   This was the \"trick of the trade\" for hat makers (hatters). So, this industrial process can be described as a \"hatter's trick\" or, more concisely, a \"hat trick\".\n*   The prolonged exposure to mercury vapors caused severe neurological damage in hatters, a condition known as erethism or \"Mad Hatter's disease.\" This is the origin of the phrase \"mad as a hatter.\"\n*   Due to the extreme toxicity of mercury salts, this process has been abandoned and is no longer used in modern hat making.\n*   This perfectly matches the second clue: \"Another Hat Trick\" (the hatter's method) has ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the findings.**\n*   The term \"Hat Trick\" successfully links the sports achievement depicted in the image with the obsolete, toxic industrial process mentioned in the second clue.\n*   Clue 1: Nikita Kucherov achieved a \"hat trick\" of awards at the 2019 NHL Awards, the event pictured.\n*   Clue 2: The \"hat trick\" (method) of using mercury salts to make felt hats is no longer used because of its toxicity.\n*   Therefore, X Y is \"Hat Trick\".\n\n<<<Hat Trick>>>"
