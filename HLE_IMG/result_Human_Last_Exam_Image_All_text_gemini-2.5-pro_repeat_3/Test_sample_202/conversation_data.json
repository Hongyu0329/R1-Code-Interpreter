    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the rock specimens:\n\n**Analysis of Specimen H**\n1.  **Observation of Characteristics:**\n    *   **Color:** Reddish-brown.\n    *   **Texture:** Highly vesicular (full of holes or gas bubbles). The surface is rough and appears porous.\n    *   **Composition:** It seems to be a single type of rock material, not made of fragments cemented together. The color suggests the presence of iron that has been oxidized.\n2.  **Interpretation and Identification:**\n    *   The vesicular texture is a key feature of extrusive (volcanic) igneous rocks, which cool rapidly at the Earth's surface, trapping gases.\n    *   A reddish-brown, highly vesicular volcanic rock is known as **scoria** (also called cinder). It is typically associated with Strombolian eruptions and the tops of lava flows. It is denser than pumice.\n    *   **Identification:** Scoria.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen I**\n1.  **Observation of Characteristics:**\n    *   **Color:** The overall color is light gray, but it is composed of many different colored fragments.\n    *   **Texture:** It is a clastic rock, meaning it is made of fragments (clasts) of other rocks.\n    *   **Composition:** The clasts are angular, not rounded. They are of various sizes and are cemented together by a fine-grained material (matrix).\n2.  **Interpretation and Identification:**\n    *   A clastic sedimentary rock composed of large, angular fragments is called a **breccia**. If the fragments were rounded, it would be a conglomerate. The angularity of the clasts indicates they were not transported far from their source.\n    *   This could also be a volcanic breccia, formed from an explosive eruption. Without further context, breccia is the most accurate name.\n    *   **Identification:** Breccia.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen J**\n1.  **Observation of Characteristics:**\n    *   **Color:** Very light-colored (white to light gray).\n    *   **Texture:** Extremely vesicular, giving it a frothy or spongy appearance. The holes are generally small and numerous. It appears to be very lightweight. The underlying rock material is aphanitic (fine-grained) or glassy.\n2.  **Interpretation and Identification:**\n    *   Like scoria, this is a vesicular, extrusive igneous rock. However, its light color indicates a felsic (silica-rich) composition.\n    *   This combination of light color, high vesicularity, and low density is characteristic of **pumice**. Pumice is often able to float on water.\n    *   **Identification:** Pumice.\n\n**Analysis of Specimen K**\n1.  **Observation of Characteristics:**\n    *   **Color:** A mix of colors, including light pink, white/clear, and black/dark green.\n    *   **Texture:** Phaneritic (coarse-grained). Individual mineral crystals are large and clearly visible, interlocking with each other. There is no matrix or cement holding them.\n    *   **Composition:** The visible minerals appear to be pinkish potassium feldspar, whitish plagioclase feldspar, glassy gray quartz, and dark biotite mica or hornblende.\n2.  **Interpretation and Identification:**\n    *   The coarse-grained, interlocking crystalline texture indicates it is an intrusive (plutonic) igneous rock that cooled slowly deep within the Earth's crust.\n    *   The mineral assemblage (quartz, feldspar, and mafic minerals) is characteristic of **granite**. The pink feldspar is particularly common in many granites.\n    *   **Identification:** Granite.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n*   **H:** Scoria\n*   **I:** Breccia\n*   **J:** Pumice\n*   **K:** Granite\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Granite>>>"
