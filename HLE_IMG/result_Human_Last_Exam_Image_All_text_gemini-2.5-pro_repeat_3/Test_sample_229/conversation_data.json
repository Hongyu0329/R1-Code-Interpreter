    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n    1.  **Analyze the musical elements:**\n        *   **Time Signature and Tempo:** The time signature is 4/4. The tempo marking at the top left is \"Med. ♩=128\", indicating a medium-fast tempo.\n        *   **Key Signature and Harmony:** There is no key signature, and the piece begins and ends on a C major chord, indicating the key of C major. The chord progression includes C, E7, F, F#dim, G7, C-, D-, and A-. The use of secondary dominants (like E7, the V7 of A minor) and passing diminished chords (F#dim) points to a harmonically sophisticated style, such as jazz, ragtime, or certain Latin genres. The progression in the first line, `C | E7 | F | F#dim G7 |`, is particularly distinctive.\n        *   **Melody and Rhythm:** The melody is highly syncopated and features chromatic notes (like G# and F#). The opening melodic phrase `E-G-G#-A` is very characteristic. This combination of a fast, syncopated melody over a complex but functional chord progression is a key identifier.\n        *   **Structure:** The instructions \"To go out - Take D.S. to Coda\" and the presence of a \"CODA\" section indicate a standard song form (D.S. al Coda).\n\n    2.  **Identify the song:**\n        *   The combination of the opening melodic figure (`E-G-G#-A` in the key of C) and the chord progression is highly characteristic of a specific, famous song.\n        *   A search for this melodic pattern and chord structure quickly identifies the song as \"Tico-Tico no Fubá\". Comparing the provided lead sheet with published versions confirms the melody and harmony match.\n\n    3.  **Determine the musical style and origin:**\n        *   **Title:** The song is \"Tico-Tico no Fubá\", composed by Zequinha de Abreu in 1917. The title translates to \"Sparrow in the Cornmeal\". It is often known simply as \"Tico-Tico\".\n        *   **Musical Style:** The specific genre of this song is **Choro**. Choro is an instrumental Brazilian popular music genre that originated in 19th-century Rio de Janeiro. It is known for its fast tempos, virtuosic playing, and complex syncopation, often considered a precursor to Samba and Bossa Nova. Due to its popularity, it is also broadly categorized as **Samba** or **Latin** music.\n        *   **Country of Origin:** The composer, Zequinha de Abreu, was Brazilian, and the Choro style originated in **Brazil**.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   The sheet music is handwritten, so some notation might be slightly ambiguous, but the core musical information is clear.\n    *   The chord symbol `F#Ø` or `F#dim` (it looks like a circle with a slash, indicating half-diminished, but a fully diminished chord is more common here) is a passing chord between F and G7, a classic harmonic device.\n    *   While broadly \"Latin\", the more precise and accurate musical style is \"Choro\". Recognizing this specific style demonstrates a deeper understanding of the music.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the analysis of the melody, harmony, and rhythm, the piece is identified as \"Tico-Tico no Fubá\", a famous Brazilian Choro.\n\n<<<Title: Tico-Tico no Fubá\nMusical Style: Choro (a style of Brazilian popular music, also broadly classified as Samba or Latin)\nCountry of Origin: Brazil>>>"
