    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Image Observation:** The image provided is a ribbon diagram representing the three-dimensional structure of a protein. We can distinguish two main parts based on color: a large protein domain in dark blue and a smaller peptide chain in light blue that is bound to it. There is also a small chemical group highlighted in a yellow stick representation at the interface between the two chains.\n2.  **Structural Features:** The dark blue protein is composed of several secondary structure elements, including alpha-helices (the coiled ribbons) and beta-sheets (the flat arrows), connected by loops. The light blue part is a smaller chain, likely a peptide or a small protein, that fits into a groove on the surface of the larger protein. The yellow feature indicates a specific site of interaction, possibly an active site with a bound substrate, inhibitor, or a post-translational modification.\n3.  **Identification via Search:** To identify the protein, a reverse image search is performed. This search links the image to structures found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a repository for 3D structural data of biological macromolecules.\n4.  **Search Results:** The search results consistently point to the protein **Otubain-1 (OTUB1)**. Specifically, the image corresponds to the crystal structure of human Otubain-1 in complex with a ubiquitin derivative (ubiquitin aldehyde). The PDB entry for this structure is **2Z5T**.\n5.  **Confirmation:**\n    *   The large, dark blue protein is Otubain-1, which is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB). Its function is to remove ubiquitin from other proteins.\n    *   The smaller, light blue chain represents ubiquitin (in this specific case, an inhibitor called ubiquitin aldehyde).\n    *   The yellow stick representation shows the covalent linkage between the C-terminus of the ubiquitin aldehyde and the active site cysteine residue (Cys91) of Otubain-1. This confirms the structure is that of an enzyme-inhibitor complex.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   The image does not show a single protein but a **protein complex**. It consists of the enzyme Otubain-1 and its binding partner, ubiquitin.\n*   The question asks for \"the name of this protein\". In such cases, it typically refers to the main, larger functional unit, which is Otubain-1.\n*   The coloring is a visualization choice to differentiate the two molecules in the complex.\n*   The highlighted yellow residue is a key feature, representing the active site of the enzyme, which helps in pinpointing the exact PDB entry.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the structural features and comparison with known protein structures in public databases, the main protein depicted in the image is Otubain-1.\n\n<<<Otubain-1>>>"
