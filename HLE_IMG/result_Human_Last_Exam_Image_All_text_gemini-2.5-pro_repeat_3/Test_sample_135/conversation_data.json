    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual evidence.**\n    The image provided is a black-and-white photograph of a sculptural relief. It depicts a religious scene within a circular frame (a roundel). The scene is the administration of the Eucharist (Communion), with a priest giving the Host to a group of kneeling figures, including a child. The style is clearly that of the Italian Renaissance, specifically Florence in the mid-15th century, characterized by naturalistic figures, graceful poses, and a sense of order and harmony. The roundel is set within a larger, richly decorated square panel featuring floral and foliate motifs. At the bottom of the roundel, a cartouche bears the inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\", which appears to be an archaic spelling of the Italian \"Sacramento dell'Altare\" or French \"Sacrement de l'autel\" (Sacrament of the Altar).\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify stylistic characteristics and potential artists.**\n    The delicate, low-relief carving (known as *rilievo schiacciato*), combined with the sweet and gentle expressions on the faces of the figures, points to a master sculptor of the Florentine Quattrocento. The primary candidates known for this style are:\n    *   **Luca della Robbia (c. 1400-1482):** Famous for his serene, classical compositions, often in glazed terracotta. The ornate garland frame is a hallmark of his workshop.\n    *   **Desiderio da Settignano (c. 1430-1464):** Renowned for his extraordinary sensitivity and delicacy in marble carving, creating figures with a subtle, sweet melancholy. His work is considered the epitome of grace in 15th-century sculpture.\n\n*   **Step 3: Research the specific artwork.**\n    A search for this specific composition, particularly using the inscription, leads to some confusion. However, major art historical archives, such as the Fondazione Zeri and the Alinari Archives, have historically cataloged this exact image. These archives attribute the work to **Desiderio da Settignano**. They identify it as a detail from the predella (the base) of his masterpiece, the *Tabernacle of the Sacrament* (c. 1461), located in the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Florence.\n\n*   **Step 4: Address conflicting information and conclude.**\n    There is a complication: if one looks at the Tabernacle in San Lorenzo today, the central predella panel shows a *Pietà* (Lamentation over the Dead Christ), not this Communion scene. However, art historical research has established that the *Pietà* is a later, likely 17th-century, replacement. The original predella relief carved by Desiderio is lost. The persistent attribution of this Communion scene to Desiderio's Tabernacle in historical archives suggests a strong tradition that this was, in fact, the original lost relief. The style of the carving, with its extreme delicacy and the gentle, emotive quality of the figures, aligns perfectly with Desiderio da Settignano's known works, such as the *Tomb of Carlo Marsuppini*. Therefore, despite the object not being in its original location, the authorship is confidently attributed to him.\n\n*   **Final Conclusion:**\n    Based on strong stylistic evidence and historical attributions, the author of this relief is Desiderio da Settignano. It is believed to be the original, now-lost, predella panel for his Tabernacle of the Sacrament in San Lorenzo, Florence.\n\n<<<Desiderio da Settignano>>>"
