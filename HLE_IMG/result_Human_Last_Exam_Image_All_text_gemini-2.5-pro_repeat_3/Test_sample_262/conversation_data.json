    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the general structure of the complexes:** All four compounds are cationic octahedral Iridium(III) complexes. They have the general formula `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+[PF6]⁻`.\n    *   The central metal ion is Iridium(III).\n    *   There are two identical cyclometalating ligands, denoted as `C^N`. These are phenylpyridine derivatives that bind to the iridium center through a covalent Ir-C bond and a dative Ir-N bond.\n    *   There is one neutral bidentate ligand, denoted as `N^N`. This is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine, which binds through two dative Ir-N bonds.\n    *   The counterion is hexafluorophosphate, `[PF6]⁻`.\n\n2.  **Identify the differences between the four complexes:** The `N^N` ligand (4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine) and the central Ir(III) ion are the same in all four complexes. The only difference lies in the substitution pattern on the phenyl ring of the `C^N` ligands.\n    *   **Complex 1:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-(2',4'-difluorophenyl)pyridine. It has fluorine atoms at the 2' (ortho to Ir-C bond) and 4' (para to Ir-C bond) positions.\n    *   **Complex 2:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-(4'-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has a fluorine atom at the 4' (para) position.\n    *   **Complex 3:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-(2'-fluorophenyl)pyridine. It has a fluorine atom at the 2' (ortho) position.\n    *   **Complex 4:** The `C^N` ligand is 2-phenylpyridine. It has no substituents on the phenyl ring.\n\n3.  **Relate the structural differences to the operational lifetime in LECs:** The operational lifetime of an LEC is largely dependent on the chemical stability of the emitter complex. Degradation of the complex leads to a loss of luminescence and device failure. A crucial factor for the stability of these cyclometalated iridium complexes is the strength of the Ir-C bond. A stronger Ir-C bond makes the complex more robust and less prone to degradation pathways that involve bond cleavage.\n\n4.  **Analyze the effect of fluorine substitution on the Ir-C bond strength and overall stability:**\n    *   Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom. When attached to the phenyl ring, it acts as an electron-withdrawing group through the inductive effect.\n    *   This electron withdrawal lowers the energy of the molecular orbitals, in particular the HOMO, which has significant character on the phenyl ring and the iridium d-orbitals. This makes the complex more resistant to oxidation, a common degradation pathway.\n    *   Crucially, a fluorine atom at the 2'-position (ortho to the Ir-C bond) provides significant steric and electronic stabilization, which substantially strengthens the Ir-C bond. This is a well-established strategy in the design of stable phosphorescent emitters.\n    *   A fluorine atom at the 4'-position (para) also provides electronic stabilization by withdrawing electron density, but its effect on strengthening the Ir-C bond is much less pronounced than that of an ortho-substituent.\n\n5.  **Compare the expected stability of the four complexes:**\n    *   **Complexes 1 and 3:** Both have a fluorine atom at the 2'-position. This will lead to a significantly strengthened Ir-C bond. These complexes are therefore expected to be the most chemically stable and exhibit the **longest** lifetimes. Complex 1, with an additional fluorine at the 4'-position, might be even more stable than Complex 3.\n    *   **Complexes 2 and 4:** Neither of these complexes has a fluorine atom at the stabilizing 2'-position.\n        *   **Complex 4** has no fluorine atoms at all. Its Ir-C bond is the weakest among the four, making it the most susceptible to degradation. It is expected to have the **shortest** lifetime.\n        *   **Complex 2** has a fluorine at the 4'-position. This offers some electronic stabilization compared to Complex 4, but it lacks the critical Ir-C bond strengthening provided by the 2'-fluorine. Therefore, its stability and lifetime are expected to be better than Complex 4, but significantly worse than Complexes 1 and 3.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The question asks which complexes are expected to show **shorter** lifetimes. Based on the analysis, the complexes lacking the 2'-fluoro substitution (Complexes 2 and 4) are less stable and will degrade faster than the complexes that have it (Complexes 1 and 3). Therefore, Complexes 2 and 4 are expected to have shorter lifetimes.\n\n7.  **Select the correct answer choice:** The complexes with shorter lifetimes are [2] and [4]. This corresponds to answer choice I.\n\n<<<I>>>"
