    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to answer the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the plant in the image.**\nThe image shows a plant with very distinctive leaves. The key characteristics are:\n*   **Leaf Color and Texture:** The leaves are a deep, glossy green and appear to be thick and leathery.\n*   **Venation:** The most prominent feature is the intricate network of pale green or creamy-white veins that stand out against the dark green leaf surface. This pattern is known as reticulate venation.\n*   **Leaf Shape and Arrangement:** The leaves are simple, elliptical, and have smooth margins (edges). They appear to be arranged alternately or in clusters near the ends of the stems.\n*   **Habit:** The plant appears to be a woody shrub or a small tree.\n\nBased on these features, the plant is identified as ***Pennantia baylisiana***, commonly known as the **Three Kings Kaikōmako**. This plant is famous for its beautiful foliage and its story of survival from the brink of extinction.\n\n**Step 2: Research the endemic location of *Pennantia baylisiana*.**\nThe term \"endemic\" means that a species is native and restricted to a specific geographic area.\n*   The common name, \"Three Kings Kaikōmako,\" provides a direct clue to its origin.\n*   Historical and botanical records confirm that this species is one of the rarest plants in the world.\n*   A single tree was discovered in 1945 by Professor Geoff Baylis on the Three Kings Islands (Manawa-tawhi), an archipelago about 55 kilometers northwest of Cape Reinga, New Zealand.\n*   For many years, this single female tree was the only one known to exist in the wild. All *Pennantia baylisiana* plants in cultivation today are descendants of this one individual.\n\n**Step 3: Conclude the name of the island.**\nThe plant *Pennantia baylisiana* was found on, and is endemic to, the **Three Kings Islands**. Specifically, the single wild specimen was located on **Great Island**, which is the largest of the group. The name \"Three Kings Islands\" is the correct and standard answer for the endemic location of the species.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The primary identification clue is the unique and highly pronounced reticulated vein pattern on the leaves.\n*   It is important to understand the definition of \"endemic\" to correctly answer the question about the plant's native and restricted habitat.\n*   While the plant was found on \"Great Island,\" this is part of the \"Three Kings Islands\" archipelago, which is the name used to describe the species' endemic range.\n\n<<<Three Kings Islands>>>"
