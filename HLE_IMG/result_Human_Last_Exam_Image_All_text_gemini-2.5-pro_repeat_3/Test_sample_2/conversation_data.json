    "### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm:**\n    The given pseudocode defines a recursive sorting function `sort(a, n)`. Let's break down its logic for `n > 1`:\n    *   `sort(a, n - 1)`: This is the first recursive call. It aims to sort the first `n-1` elements of the array `a`, i.e., the subarray `a[0...n-2]`.\n    *   `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: After the first `n-1` elements are presumably sorted, this line checks if the last element, `a[n-1]`, is smaller than the element just before it, `a[n-2]`. Since `a[0...n-2]` is sorted, `a[n-2]` is the largest element in that subarray.\n    *   `swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`: If the condition is true, it means `a[n-1]` is out of order. The `swap` places the larger element (`a[n-2]`) at the end of the current subarray (`a[n-1]`).\n    *   `sort(a, n - 1)`: This is the second recursive call. After the swap, the element that was originally at `a[n-1]` is now at `a[n-2]`, potentially disrupting the sorted order of the `a[0...n-2]` subarray. This call is made to re-sort the first `n-1` elements.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation:**\n    To find the time complexity, we can define a recurrence relation `T(n)` that represents the number of operations for an input of size `n`.\n    *   **Base Case:** If `n <= 1`, the function does nothing or a constant amount of work. So, `T(1) = O(1)`.\n    *   **Recursive Step:** For `n > 1`, the function performs:\n        1.  One recursive call: `sort(a, n - 1)`, which takes `T(n - 1)` time.\n        2.  A comparison and a potential swap, which take constant time, `O(1)`.\n        3.  A second recursive call `sort(a, n - 1)` in the worst case. This call takes another `T(n - 1)` time.\n\n    The **worst case** occurs when the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is always true, forcing the second recursive call to be executed at every step. This leads to the following recurrence relation for the worst-case time complexity:\n    `T(n) = T(n - 1) + T(n - 1) + O(1)`\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant)\n\n3.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:**\n    We need to solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`. We can do this by expansion:\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 2^2 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n    *   `T(n) = 2^2 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 2c + c = 2^3 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    *   ... After `k` steps ...\n    *   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^(k-1) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n\n    The sum is a geometric series: `(2^k - 1) / (2 - 1) = 2^k - 1`.\n    So, `T(n) = 2^k * T(n - k) + c * (2^k - 1)`.\n\n    We expand until we reach the base case `T(1)`. Let `n - k = 1`, so `k = n - 1`.\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n    Since `T(1)` is a constant, let's call it `c'`.\n    `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c' + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n    `T(n) = (c' + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\n    The dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`.\n\n4.  **Determine the Big-O Complexity:**\n    The time complexity `T(n)` is proportional to `2^n`. Therefore, the worst-case time complexity of the algorithm is `O(2^n)`.\n\n### Careful Points:\n\n*   **Worst-Case Input:** The worst-case scenario happens when the `if` condition is met at every level of the recursion. This happens, for example, with a reverse-sorted array (e.g., `[n, n-1, ..., 2, 1]`). In this case, the smallest element is always at the end of the subarray being considered, triggering the swap and the expensive second recursive call.\n*   **Termination:** The algorithm always terminates because the recursive calls are made with a smaller value of `n` (`n-1`), and there is a base case for `n <= 1`.\n*   **Comparison with other sorting algorithms:** This algorithm is extremely inefficient. A standard recursive implementation of Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort would have a recurrence like `T(n) = T(n-1) + O(n)`, leading to `O(n^2)` complexity. This algorithm's recurrence `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + O(1)` grows much faster, resulting in an exponential `O(2^n)` complexity.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis of the recurrence relation `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`, the worst-case time complexity is exponential.\n\nFinal Answer Selection:\n*   A. O(n) - Incorrect.\n*   B. O(n log n) - Incorrect.\n*   C. O(n^2) - Incorrect.\n*   D. O(n^3) - Incorrect.\n*   E. O(2^n) - Correct.\n*   F. does not terminate - Incorrect.\n\nThe final answer is O(2^n).\n\n<<<E>>>"
