    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the total current flowing through the circuit.\n\n**1. Analyze the Circuit's Structure**\nThe circuit consists of a 1V DC voltage source (V2) connected to two parallel branches. The total current flowing from the source will be the sum of the currents in these two branches. To find the total current, we can calculate the total equivalent resistance of the circuit and then use Ohm's Law.\n\n**2. Analyze the Left Branch (Resistors R1, R2, R3)**\n*   This branch contains three resistors: R1 = 3 Ω, R2 = 7 Ω, and R3 = 9 Ω.\n*   **Careful Point:** Observe the wiring around resistor R2. There is a wire that directly connects the node between R1 and R2 to the node between R2 and R3.\n*   A wire with no components is assumed to have zero resistance. This wire creates a \"short circuit\" across resistor R2.\n*   Since current follows the path of least resistance, all the current flowing from R1 will bypass R2 and go through the shorting wire to R3.\n*   This means no current flows through R2, and it can be effectively ignored for the calculation of the branch's resistance.\n*   Therefore, the left branch simplifies to R1 and R3 being connected in series.\n*   The equivalent resistance of the left branch (R_left) is:\n    R_left = R1 + R3 = 3 Ω + 9 Ω = 12 Ω\n\n**3. Analyze the Right Branch (Resistors R7, R8)**\n*   This branch contains two resistors: R7 = 100 Ω and R8 = 100 Ω.\n*   These two resistors are connected one after another, which is a series connection.\n*   The equivalent resistance of the right branch (R_right) is the sum of their individual resistances:\n    R_right = R7 + R8 = 100 Ω + 100 Ω = 200 Ω\n\n**4. Calculate the Total Equivalent Resistance (R_eq)**\n*   The left branch (R_left) and the right branch (R_right) are connected in parallel across the voltage source.\n*   The formula for the total equivalent resistance of two parallel resistors is:\n    1 / R_eq = 1 / R_left + 1 / R_right\n*   Plugging in the values:\n    1 / R_eq = 1 / 12 Ω + 1 / 200 Ω\n*   To add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 600.\n    1 / R_eq = (50 / 600) + (3 / 600)\n    1 / R_eq = 53 / 600\n*   Now, we invert the fraction to find R_eq:\n    R_eq = 600 / 53 Ω ≈ 11.32 Ω\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Current (I_total)**\n*   The question asks for the total current flowing through the circuit, which is the current supplied by the voltage source V2.\n*   Using Ohm's Law: V = I × R, or I = V / R.\n*   The total voltage (V_total) is 1 V.\n*   The total resistance (R_eq) is 600 / 53 Ω.\n*   I_total = V_total / R_eq\n    I_total = 1 V / (600 / 53 Ω)\n    I_total = 53 / 600 A\n*   Converting this fraction to a decimal:\n    I_total ≈ 0.08833 A\n\nThe total current flowing through the circuit is approximately 0.0883 Amperes, or 88.3 milliamperes (mA).\n\n<<<0.0883 A>>>"
