    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to find the rotational symmetry of the tiling shown in the image. Rotational symmetry of order 'n' (or n-fold rotational symmetry) means that the tiling looks identical after being rotated by an angle of 360/n degrees around a specific point called a center of rotation. We are looking for the highest order 'n' that applies to the entire periodic pattern. For any periodic 2D tiling, the crystallographic restriction theorem states that 'n' can only be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Centers of Rotation**\nThe tiling is constructed from several types of polygons: dark blue hexagons, light yellow squares, orange rhombi, and light yellow irregular pentagons. The most likely centers of rotation are the centers of the most regular shapes, such as the hexagons and squares.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Center of a Blue Hexagon**\nLet's choose the center of one of the blue hexagons as a potential center of rotation.\n*   **Test for 6-fold symmetry (60° rotation):**\n    *   A regular hexagon itself has 6-fold symmetry. However, we must check if the entire surrounding pattern also has this symmetry.\n    *   Let's trace a path radially outward from the center of the hexagon through the midpoint of one of its sides. We pass through the hexagon, then a yellow pentagon, and then we encounter a yellow square.\n    *   Now, let's trace a path radially outward from the center through one of its vertices. We pass through the hexagon vertex (where it meets two pentagons), and then we encounter a point where two pentagons and two orange rhombi meet.\n    *   A 60° rotation would have to map a path through a side-midpoint to a path through a vertex. Since what we encounter along these paths is different (a square vs. a rhombus/pentagon junction), the pattern does not map onto itself.\n    *   Therefore, the tiling does **not** have 6-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   **Test for 3-fold symmetry (120° rotation):**\n    *   A 120° rotation maps a path through a side-midpoint to another path through a side-midpoint (two sides away). The features along these paths are identical (Hexagon -> Pentagon -> Square).\n    *   Similarly, a 120° rotation maps a path through a vertex to another path through a vertex (two vertices away). The features along these paths are also identical.\n    *   Looking closely at the surrounding tiles, such as the ring of 6 squares slightly further out, we can see they exist in alternating orientations. A 120° rotation maps each square to another square with the *same* orientation.\n    *   Therefore, the tiling **does** have 3-fold rotational symmetry about the center of each hexagon.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Center of a Yellow Square**\nLet's choose the center of one of the yellow squares as another potential center of rotation.\n*   **Test for 4-fold symmetry (90° rotation):**\n    *   A square itself has 4-fold symmetry. Let's examine the surrounding pattern.\n    *   Trace a path radially outward from the square's center, passing through the middle of its top side. We go through the square, an orange rhombus, a yellow pentagon, and eventually reach a blue hexagon. Let's observe the orientation of this hexagon; its sides are vertical.\n    *   Now, rotate our viewpoint by 90° and trace a path outward from the center through the middle of the right side. We again pass through a square, a rhombus, a pentagon, and reach a hexagon. However, if we look closely at the orientation of *this* hexagon, its sides are horizontal.\n    *   Since a 90° rotation results in reaching a tile (the hexagon) with a different orientation, the entire pattern does not map onto itself.\n    *   Therefore, the tiling does **not** have 4-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   **Test for 2-fold symmetry (180° rotation):**\n    *   A 180° rotation maps the path going \"up\" to the path going \"down\". The hexagon at the end of the \"up\" path and the one at the end of the \"down\" path both have the same orientation (vertical sides). The same holds for the \"left\" and \"right\" paths (horizontal sides).\n    *   Therefore, the tiling **does** have 2-fold rotational symmetry about the center of each square.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nWe have found centers of 3-fold rotation (at the centers of hexagons) and centers of 2-fold rotation (at the centers of squares and other locations). The highest order of rotational symmetry present in the tiling is 3.\n\n<<<3-fold>>>"
