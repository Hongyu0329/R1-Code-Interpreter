    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Graph's Structure**\n    The image provided is a Google Trends graph, which illustrates the relative search interest of one or more terms over a specific period.\n    *   **X-axis (Time):** The time range is from December 1, 2019, to sometime after May 28, 2023.\n    *   **Y-axis (Interest):** This shows relative search interest, with 100 representing the peak popularity for the term(s) during the given time.\n    *   **Lines (Search Terms):** There are three colored linesâ€”red, blue, and yellow. The prompt states these represent three different historic events that all occurred in one country.\n    *   **Key Feature:** The graph shows recurring annual spikes for each color, suggesting that the search terms are related to anniversaries of historical events that are commemorated or searched for each year.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the Timing of the Spikes for Each Color**\n    We need to examine when the peaks of interest occur for each line, as these dates are the primary clues.\n    *   **Red Line:** Shows consistent, strong spikes every year in late January or early February. We can see these peaks around early Feb 2020, early Feb 2021, early Feb 2022, and early Feb 2023.\n    *   **Yellow Line:** Shows annual spikes in mid-to-late September. There is an exceptionally large spike, hitting the maximum value of 100, in September 2022. The \"Note\" on the graph also points to this period, often indicating a major real-world event that influenced search traffic.\n    *   **Blue Line:** Shows smaller, but still distinct, annual spikes. These appear to occur around late April or early May each year, for instance in 2022 and 2023.\n\n*   **Step 3: Correlate the Timings with Historical Events of a Single Country**\n    The challenge is to find one country that has three significant historical events or anniversaries corresponding to these three distinct times of the year.\n    *   **Hypothesis for the Red Line (Early February):** An annual event in early February. A very prominent event celebrated at this time is the anniversary of the **Iranian Revolution**, which culminated on February 11, 1979. The preceding \"Ten Days of Dawn\" are heavily commemorated in Iran from Feb 1st to 11th. This matches the red line's pattern perfectly.\n    *   **Hypothesis for the Yellow Line (Mid-September):** An annual event in mid-September, with a massive event in September 2022. On September 16, 2022, **Mahsa Amini died in Iran**, which sparked massive, prolonged nationwide protests against the government and its policies. This historic event caused a global surge in interest and news coverage, which would explain the massive spike to 100 on the Google Trends chart. The smaller annual spikes could be related to the anniversary of the start of the Iran-Iraq War (September 22, 1980), another major event in Iranian history, or subsequent anniversaries of the protest movement. The Mahsa Amini event is the key identifier here.\n    *   **Hypothesis for the Blue Line (Late April/Early May):** An annual event in late April. In Iranian history, this period marks the anniversary of **Operation Eagle Claw** (April 24-25, 1980), the failed US military mission to rescue American hostages held in Tehran. The event is commemorated in Iran as a significant victory and a symbol of American defeat. This timing aligns with the smaller blue spikes.\n\n*   **Step 4: Conclusion**\n    All three sets of dates point convincingly to significant events in the modern history of a single country:\n    1.  **February:** The Iranian Revolution.\n    2.  **September:** The Mahsa Amini protests (a major historical event) and/or the start of the Iran-Iraq war.\n    3.  **April/May:** The failure of Operation Eagle Claw.\n\n    The combination of these three specific, annually recurring points of interest makes it evident to a historian that the country in question is Iran.\n\n<<<Iran>>>"
