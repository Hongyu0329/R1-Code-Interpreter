    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the main difference between the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The goal is to find the most prominent and easily observable feature of the sporophyte that distinguishes *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta*. The phrase \"at a glance\" suggests a macroscopic character.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Sporophyte Structure:** A moss sporophyte typically consists of a foot, a seta (stalk), and a capsule (which contains the spores). Key features used for identification include the length and curvature of the seta, and the shape, orientation, and surface texture (e.g., smooth or ribbed) of the capsule.\n\n3.  **Examine the Characteristics of *Grimmia montana*:**\n    *   **Seta (stalk):** The seta of *Grimmia montana* is characteristically short and **straight**.\n    *   **Capsule Orientation:** Because the seta is straight, the capsule is held erect and is symmetrical. It is typically emergent, meaning it sits just above the surrounding perichaetial leaves, as seen in the provided image.\n    *   **Capsule Shape:** The capsule is generally ovoid to cup-shaped and smooth when moist, sometimes becoming slightly furrowed when dry.\n\n4.  **Examine the Characteristics of *Grimmia curviseta*:**\n    *   **Seta (stalk):** The species name itself, *curviseta*, provides a major clue. \"Curvi-\" means curved, and \"seta\" is the stalk. This species is defined by its distinctly **curved, arcuate, or cygneous (swan-necked) seta** when moist.\n    *   **Capsule Orientation:** The strong curvature of the seta causes the capsule to be cernuous (nodding) or pendent (hanging down). This orientation makes the capsule appear asymmetrical relative to the seta.\n    *   **Capsule Shape:** The capsule is often ribbed (striate or plicate) when dry, which is another distinguishing feature, but the seta curvature is more primary and striking.\n\n5.  **Compare the Two Species:**\n    *   **Seta:** *G. montana* has a **straight seta**. *G. curviseta* has a **curved seta**.\n    *   **Capsule Position:** The capsule of *G. montana* is **erect**. The capsule of *G. curviseta* is **nodding or pendent**.\n\n6.  **Conclusion on the Main Difference:** The most significant and easily recognizable difference between the sporophytes of these two species is the curvature of the seta. A straight seta holding an erect capsule points to *Grimmia montana*, while a strongly curved, swan-necked seta causing the capsule to nod or hang down is the defining characteristic of *Grimmia curviseta*. This single feature allows for a confident distinction \"at a glance\" when the mosses have mature sporophytes.\n\n***\n\n<<<The main difference in the sporophyte that distinguishes *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the **seta (stalk)**. In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is **short and straight**, holding the capsule in an erect position. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a **distinctly curved or cygneous (swan-necked) seta**, which causes its capsule to be nodding or pendent.>>>"
