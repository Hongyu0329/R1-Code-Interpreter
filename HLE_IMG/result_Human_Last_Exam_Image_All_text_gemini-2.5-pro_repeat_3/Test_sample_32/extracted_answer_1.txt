The main difference in the sporophyte that distinguishes *Grimmia montana* from *Grimmia curviseta* at a glance is the **seta (stalk)**. In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is **short and straight**, holding the capsule in an erect position. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a **distinctly curved or cygneous (swan-necked) seta**, which causes its capsule to be nodding or pendent.
