**Product A (C14H20N2O3):**
The structure is 2-(3-oxobutyl)-1-(4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid. It is formed by the Michael addition of the starting material's α-carbon to a C4H6O fragment (e.g., methyl vinyl ketone).

(A more precise drawing would show the pyrrolidine and pyrroline rings properly)
 

**Product B (C12H14N2O3):**
The structure is 2-acetyl-1-(4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid. It is formed by the addition of a C2O fragment to the starting material, likely involving acylation by ketene followed by oxidation.

**Product C (C11H16N2O3):**
The structure is 2-(hydroxymethyl)-1-(4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid. It is formed by the addition of a CH2O (formaldehyde) fragment to the starting material at the α-carbon.
