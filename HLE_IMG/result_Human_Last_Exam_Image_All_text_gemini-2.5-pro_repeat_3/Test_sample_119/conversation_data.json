    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound from the provided spectra.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrum (MS) Analysis:**\n*   The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 135.\n*   An odd molecular weight strongly suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms, according to the Nitrogen Rule. Let's assume there is one nitrogen atom (N).\n*   Let's propose a molecular formula. The presence of an aromatic ring is suggested by other spectra. A benzene ring is C₆.\n*   Let's try to find a formula for CₓHᵧN with a mass of 135. If we assume a C₉ skeleton (e.g., a benzene ring C₆ plus a C₃ side chain), the formula would be C₉H₁₃N.\n*   Let's check the mass: (9 × 12) + (13 × 1) + (1 × 14) = 108 + 13 + 14 = 135. This matches perfectly.\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C₉H₁₃N.\n*   **Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** DBE = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4. A DBE of 4 is consistent with a benzene ring.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectrum Analysis:**\n*   **~3300-3400 cm⁻¹:** A broad absorption indicates an N-H stretch, characteristic of an amine.\n*   **> 3000 cm⁻¹ (e.g., ~3030 cm⁻¹):** Sharp peaks indicate C-H stretches from sp² hybridized carbons (aromatic ring).\n*   **< 3000 cm⁻¹ (e.g., ~2850-2960 cm⁻¹):** Peaks indicate C-H stretches from sp³ hybridized carbons (aliphatic chain).\n*   **~1450-1600 cm⁻¹:** Multiple peaks in this region are characteristic of C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   **Summary:** The IR spectrum confirms the presence of an amine group, an aromatic ring, and aliphatic C-H bonds.\n\n**3. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis:**\n*   **¹³C NMR signals:** There are 7 signals at δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. This means there are 7 types of non-equivalent carbons.\n*   **DEPT-135:** Shows one negative signal and five positive signals.\n    *   Negative signal: Indicates one CH₂ group.\n    *   Positive signals: Indicate five CH or CH₃ groups.\n    *   Quaternary Carbon (Cq): The total number of ¹³C signals is 7, and the total number of signals in DEPT-135 is 1+5=6. The missing signal (7-6=1) corresponds to a quaternary carbon (no attached protons).\n*   **Carbon Type Assignment:**\n    *   **Cq (1 signal):** δ 145.1 (downfield, typical for an aromatic carbon attached to a substituent).\n    *   **CH₂ (1 signal):** δ 43.5 (this will be the negative peak in DEPT-135).\n    *   **CH/CH₃ (5 signals):** δ 128.5, 127.3, 126.3 (aromatic CH region), δ 49.6 (aliphatic CH/CH₃), δ 19.2 (aliphatic CH/CH₃).\n\n**4. ¹H NMR and HSQC Analysis:**\n*   The ¹H NMR spectrum shows four main groups of signals. The HSQC spectrum correlates each proton signal to the carbon it is attached to.\n*   **Signal 1: δ ~7.1-7.3 ppm.**\n    *   **¹H:** A complex multiplet with an integration of 5.00, indicating 5 protons. This is a classic signature for a monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-).\n    *   **HSQC:** These protons correlate to the ¹³C signals at δ 128.5, 127.3, and 126.3. This confirms these three carbons are aromatic CH groups.\n*   **Signal 2: δ ~2.8-3.0 ppm (overlapping signals).**\n    *   **¹H:** The integrations show two overlapping signals: one integrating to ~2 protons (1.96) and another to ~1 proton (0.97).\n    *   **HSQC:** The 2H signal correlates to the ¹³C signal at δ 43.5. Since this carbon is a CH₂ (from DEPT), this signal corresponds to a -CH₂- group.\n    *   **HSQC:** The 1H signal correlates to the ¹³C signal at δ 49.6. This must be a -CH- group.\n*   **Signal 3: δ ~1.15 ppm.**\n    *   **¹H:** A signal integrating to ~3 protons (3.24) that is split into a doublet. A 3H doublet indicates a -CH₃ group adjacent to a -CH group.\n    *   **HSQC:** This proton signal correlates to the ¹³C signal at δ 19.2. This confirms δ 19.2 is a CH₃ group.\n*   **N-H Protons:** The formula C₉H₁₃N requires 13 protons. We have accounted for 5 (aromatic) + 2 (CH₂) + 1 (CH) + 3 (CH₃) = 11 protons attached to carbon. The remaining 2 protons must be on the nitrogen atom, confirming a primary amine (-NH₂). The -NH₂ signal is often broad and may be hidden under other peaks (like the solvent peak at ~2.5 ppm).\n\n**5. Structure Elucidation and IUPAC Name:**\n*   **Fragments:** We have identified the following pieces:\n    1.  A phenyl group (C₆H₅-)\n    2.  A primary amine group (-NH₂)\n    3.  An aliphatic chain consisting of -CH₂-, -CH-, and -CH₃.\n*   **Assembly:** The only way to connect these fragments that is consistent with the NMR data (especially the coupling) is:\n    *   The CH₃ group is a doublet, so it must be next to the CH group: -CH(CH₃).\n    *   The phenyl group and the -CH(NH₂)-CH₃ fragment must be connected by the -CH₂- group.\n    *   This gives the structure: C₆H₅-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃.\n*   **Verification:** This structure (1-phenyl-2-propanamine) is consistent with all the data.\n    *   The -CH₂- group at ~2.8 ppm is benzylic (next to C₆H₅).\n    *   The -CH- group at ~2.9 ppm is next to the -NH₂, the -CH₂-, and the -CH₃, explaining its multiplet splitting.\n    *   The -CH₃ group at ~1.15 ppm is a doublet because it's coupled only to the adjacent -CH- proton.\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    1.  Identify the parent chain containing the principal functional group (the amine). The longest carbon chain is three carbons long: propane.\n    2.  The amine group (-NH₂) is the principal functional group. The \"-e\" of propane is replaced with \"-amine\". We number the chain to give the amine the lowest possible number. Numbering from either end places the amine at carbon 2. So, the parent name is **propan-2-amine**.\n    3.  Identify and number the substituents. There is a phenyl group (-C₆H₅) on the chain.\n    4.  To assign the locant for the phenyl group, we number the chain such that the substituents get the lowest possible set of numbers. Since the amine is at C2 regardless of direction, we number from the end that gives the phenyl group the lower number. This puts the phenyl group at carbon 1.\n    5.  Combine the parts: The substituent is **1-phenyl**.\n    6.  The full IUPAC name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
