**Product A:** A molecule containing a pyrrolidine ring fused to a dihydropyridone ring. The nitrogen of the pyrrolidine ring is substituted with a 4-acetamidobutyl group. A methoxycarbonyl group is attached to the dihydropyridone ring. Its IUPAC name is methyl 1-(4-acetamidobutyl)-4-oxo-1,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroindolizine-3-carboxylate.

**Product B:** A complex tricyclic molecule containing a pyrrolizidine core fused to a seven-membered ring that contains an imide functionality. It also features a cis-double bond within the fused ring system.

**Product C:** A tricyclic molecule containing a central piperazine-2,5-dione (diketopiperazine) ring formed from the intramolecular condensation of the starting material. One of the nitrogens of the diketopiperazine is acetylated. The structure is an acetylated derivative of octahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrolo[1,2-d]pyrazine-5,10-dione.
