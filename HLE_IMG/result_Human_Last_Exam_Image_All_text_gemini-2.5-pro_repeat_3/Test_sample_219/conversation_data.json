    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Graph and the Task**\nThe image provided is a raster plot.\n*   The **Y-axis** represents the \"Electrode Number,\" from 0 to 128, indicating recordings from 128 different locations in a neuronal culture.\n*   The **X-axis** represents \"Time (s),\" showing a 50+ second recording interval.\n*   Each **black dot** represents a single neuronal firing event (a \"spike\").\nThe task is to:\n1.  Identify \"synchronized bursts,\" which are periods when many neurons fire together in a short time. Visually, these are dense vertical columns of dots.\n2.  Estimate the timestamp for each of these bursts.\n3.  Calculate the time intervals between consecutive bursts (inter-burst intervals or IBIs).\n4.  Calculate the average of these IBIs.\n5.  Round the final answer to two significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synchronized Bursts and Their Timestamps**\nBy visually inspecting the raster plot, we can identify four major, distinct synchronized bursts. We will estimate the time at the center of each burst's densest activity.\n*   **Burst 1 (B1):** A very dense burst occurs near the beginning of the recording. Its center is approximately at **t₁ = 2 s**.\n*   **Burst 2 (B2):** The next major burst is located between 10 s and 20 s. Its center appears to be at approximately **t₂ = 17 s**.\n*   **Burst 3 (B3):** A clear, strong burst is centered exactly on the tick mark for 35 s. So, **t₃ = 35 s**.\n*   **Burst 4 (B4):** The last major burst in the recording window is just before the 50 s mark. Its center is estimated to be at **t₄ = 49 s**.\n\nThe timestamps of the synchronized bursts are approximately: 2 s, 17 s, 35 s, and 49 s.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Inter-Burst Intervals (IBIs)**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time difference between the timestamps of consecutive bursts. We have four bursts, which gives us three intervals.\n*   **IBI₁ (between B1 and B2):** t₂ - t₁ = 17 s - 2 s = **15 s**\n*   **IBI₂ (between B2 and B3):** t₃ - t₂ = 35 s - 17 s = **18 s**\n*   **IBI₃ (between B3 and B4):** t₄ - t₃ = 49 s - 35 s = **14 s**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Average Inter-Burst Interval**\nTo find the average IBI, we sum the individual intervals and divide by the number of intervals.\n*   Sum of IBIs = 15 s + 18 s + 14 s = 47 s\n*   Number of intervals = 3\n*   Average IBI = (Sum of IBIs) / (Number of intervals) = 47 s / 3 ≈ 15.666... s\n\n**Step 5: Round the Answer to Two Significant Figures**\nThe calculated average is 15.666... s. The question requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures.\n*   The first two significant figures are 1 and 5.\n*   The third digit is 6, which is 5 or greater, so we round up the second digit (5 becomes 6).\n*   The rounded average inter-burst interval is **16 s**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Defining a Burst:** It is important to consistently identify what constitutes a \"synchronized burst.\" In this plot, the four chosen events are clearly the most prominent network-wide firings, distinguishing them from smaller, less synchronized activity.\n*   **Timestamp Estimation:** The estimation of the burst's center time is a visual approximation. However, small variations in these estimates (e.g., ±0.5 s) do not significantly alter the final rounded answer. For instance, using starting times (1s, 16s, 34s, 48s) yields the same intervals and the same final answer.\n*   **Significant Figures:** Adhering to the specified precision (two significant figures) is a crucial final step.\n\n<<<16>>>"
